The story follows a hapless florist shop worker who raises a plant that feeds on human blood and flesh.  The musical is based on the low-budget 1960 [[black comedy]] film ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]''.  The music, composed by Menken in the style of early 1960s [[rock and roll]], [[doo-wop]] and early [[Motown Records|Motown]], includes several well-known tunes, including the title song, \"Skid Row (Downtown)\", \"Somewhere That's Green\", and \"Suddenly, Seymour\".\n\nThe musical premiered [[Off-Off-Broadway]] in 1982 before moving to the [[Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan)|Orpheum Theatre]] [[Off-Broadway]], where it had a five-year run.  It later received numerous productions in the U.S. and abroad, and a subsequent [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production. Because of its small cast, it has become popular with [[community theatre]], school and other amateur groups.<ref>''[[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]]'' reported in its May 26, 2008 issue, p. 51, that this musical ranked as the most frequently produced musical by U.S. high schools in 2007.</ref>  The musical was also made into a 1986 [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film of the same name]], directed by [[Frank Oz]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nAn offstage voice recalls a time when the human race \"suddenly encountered a deadly threat to its very existence\". A trio of 1960s street urchins named Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon set the scene (\"Little Shop of Horrors\") and comment on the action throughout the show. Seymour Krelborn is a poor young man, an orphan living in an urban [[skid row]]. Audrey is a pretty blonde with a fashion sense that leans towards the tacky. They lament their stations in life and the urban blight in their neighborhood (\"Skid Row (Downtown)\"). They are co-workers at Mushnik's Skid Row Florists, a run-down flower shop owned and operated by the cranky Mr. Mushnik. Seymour has recently obtained a mysterious plant that looks like a large [[venus flytrap]]. While he was browsing the wholesale flower district, a sudden eclipse of the sun occurred, and when the light returned, the weird plant had appeared (\"Da-Doo\"). Seymour, who is secretly in love with Audrey, names the plant Audrey II in her honor.\n\nThe plant does not thrive in its new environment and appears to be dying. Seymour questions why it should be doing poorly, since he takes such good care of it. He accidentally pricks his finger on a rose thorn, which draws blood, and Audrey II's pod opens thirstily. Seymour realizes that Audrey II requires blood to survive and allows the plant to suckle from his finger (\"Grow For Me\"). As Audrey II grows, it becomes an attraction and starts generating brisk business for Mushnik. As the caretaker of the plant, the timid Seymour is suddenly regarded as a hero (\"Ya Never Know\"), while Audrey secretly longs to leave her abusive boyfriend. Her dream is to lead an ideal suburban life with Seymour, complete with a tract home, frozen dinners, and plastic on the furniture (\"Somewhere That's Green\").\n\nMeanwhile, the employees at Mushnik's are sprucing up the flower shop because of the popularity of the rapidly growing Audrey II and the revenue that it is bringing in (\"Closed for Renovation\"). Orin Scrivello, a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[Dentistry|dentist]], is Audrey's abusive boyfriend. Modeled after the \"Leader of the pack\" characters of the 1950s, Orin drives a motorcycle, wears leather, and enjoys bringing other people pain (\"Dentist!\"). Orin encourages Seymour to take the plant and get out of Skid Row. Realizing that his store's sudden profitability is completely dependent on the plant (and therefore on Seymour), Mushnik takes advantage of Seymour's innocence by offering to adopt him and make him a full partner in the business. Having always wanted a family, Seymour accepts, even though Mushnik has always yelled at him and treated him poorly (\"Mushnik and Son\"). However, Seymour is having difficulty providing enough blood to keep Audrey II healthy. When Seymour stops feeding the plant, Audrey II reveals that it can speak. It demands blood and promises that, if fed, it will make sure that all of Seymour's dreams come true. Seymour initially refuses, but he then witnesses Orin abusing Audrey. The plant presents this as a justification for killing Orin. Not realizing that he is being manipulated again, Seymour gives in to his baser instincts and agrees (\"Feed Me (Git It)\"). \n\nHe sets up a late-night appointment with Orin, intending to kill him. However, Seymour loses his nerve and decides not to commit the crime. Unfortunately for Orin, who is getting high on [[nitrous oxide]], the gas device is stuck in the \"on\" position, and he suffocates while asking Seymour to save him. Seymour cannot bring himself to shoot Orin but lets him die of asphyxiation (\"Now (It's Just The Gas)\"). Seymour feeds Orin's body to the now huge Audrey II, and the plant consumes it with ravenous glee (\"Act I Finale\").\n\n===Act II===\n{{Listen\n|filename=Suddenly, Seymour - 2003 revival.ogg\n|title=\"Suddenly, Seymour\"\n|description=The beginning of the last chorus of \"Suddenly, Seymour\", performed by Kerry Butler and Hunter Foster on the 2003 Broadway revival cast recording.}}\n\nThe flower shop is much busier, and Seymour and Audrey have trouble keeping up with the onslaught of orders (\"Call Back in the Morning\"). Audrey confides to Seymour that she feels guilty about Orin's disappearance, because she secretly wished it. The two admit their feelings for one another, and Seymour promises that he will protect and care for Audrey from now on (\"Suddenly, Seymour\"). The two plan to leave together and start a new life, although Seymour mistakenly attributes Audrey's feelings to his newfound fame, not realizing that she loved him even before he found the plant.\n\nBefore they can go, Mushnik confronts Seymour about Orin's death. Mushnik has put two and two together: the bloody dentist's uniform, the drops of blood on the floor, and he has seen Seymour and Audrey kissing. Seymour denies killing Orin, but Mushnik wants him to give a statement to the police, who have begun investigating. Audrey II tells Seymour that he has to be rid of Mushnik or he will lose everything, including Audrey (\"Suppertime\"). Seymour tells Mushnik that he put the days' receipts inside Audrey II for safekeeping. Mushnik climbs inside the plant's gaping maw to search for the money, realizing the deception too late, and screams as he is devoured. Seymour now runs the flower shop, and reporters, salesmen, lawyers and agents approach him, promising him fame and fortune. Although tempted by the trappings of his success, Seymour realizes that it is only a matter of time before Audrey II will kill again and that he is morally responsible. He considers destroying the plant but believing that his fame is the only thing that is earning him Audrey's love, he is unable to do so (\"The Meek Shall Inherit\").\n\nAs Seymour works on his speech for a lecture tour, Audrey II again squalls for blood.  Seymour threatens to kill it just as Audrey walks in asking when Mushnik will return from visiting his \"sick sister\". Seymour learns that Audrey would still love him without the fame and decides that Audrey II must die after the scheduled [[LIFE magazine|''LIFE'' magazine]] interview at the shop. Audrey is confused and frightened by Seymour's ramblings, but she runs home by his order.  That night, unable to sleep and distressed by Seymour's strange behavior, Audrey goes to the flower shop to talk with him.  He is not there, and Audrey II begs her to water him. Not sensing the mortal danger, she approaches to water it, and a vine wraps around her and pulls her into the plant's gaping maw (\"[[Sominex]]/Suppertime II\"). Seymour arrives and attacks the plant in an attempt to save Audrey. He pulls her out, but Audrey is mortally wounded.  Her dying wish is for Seymour to feed her to the plant after she dies so that they can always be together. She dies in his arms, and he reluctantly honors her request (\"Somewhere That's Green\" (reprise)). Seymour falls asleep as Audrey II grows small red flower buds.\n\nThe next day, Patrick Martin from the World Botanical Enterprises tells Seymour that his company wishes to take leaf [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of Audrey II and sell them across America. Seymour realizes the plant's evil plan: during the [[solar eclipse]], Audrey II came from an unknown planet to conquer Earth. He tries shooting, cutting, and poisoning the plant, but it has grown too hardy to kill.  Seymour, in desperation, runs into its open jaws with a [[machete]] planning to kill it from the inside, but he is quickly eaten. Patrick, Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon search for Seymour. Not finding him, Patrick tells the girls to take the cuttings.\n\nCrystal, Ronette, and Chiffon relate that, following these events, other plants appeared across America, tricking innocent people into feeding them blood in exchange for fame and fortune. Out of the fog, Audrey II, bigger than ever, appears with opened new flowers revealing the faces of Seymour, Audrey, Mushnik and Orin, who beg that, no matter how persuasive the plants may be, they must not be fed (\"Finale Ultimo: Don't Feed the Plants\"). Audrey II slithers towards the audience threateningly (In the original Off-Broadway production, plant tendrils fell all over the audience, as if each audience member were to be pulled into the plant, while in the Broadway production, a monstrously huge Audrey II was projected out over the fifth row and the balcony seats, as if it would eat the audience members).\n\n==Original production==\n===Off-Broadway===\nThe [[musical theater|musical]] had its world premiere [[Off-Off-Broadway]] on May 6, 1982 at the Workshop of the Players Art Foundation (WPA\u00a0Theatre), playing there until June 6, 1982.<ref>[http://howardashman.com/theatre.html \"Theater: ''Little Shop of Horrors''\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209054052/http://howardashman.com/theatre.html |date=2015-02-09 }}, Howard Ashman website, accessed April 21, 2014</ref>  It opened [[Off-Broadway]] at the [[Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan)|Orpheum Theatre]] in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] on July 27, 1982.

PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS! -->\n\nIn the musical, the sadistic dentist, Orin Scrivello, is killed by suffocation from [[laughing gas]] instead of being stabbed with a dental instrument as in the film.  His abusive relationship with Audrey is added to the musical to give Seymour a motive to kill him.  In the film, Seymour murders several innocent bystanders, and Mushnik tricks a thief into looking for money inside the plant, which eats the thief.  In the musical, Seymour tricks Mushnik in the same way when Mushnik plans to turn Seymour over to the police.  The two neighborhood girls in the film are replaced in the musical by a chorus of three street urchins: [[The Crystals|Crystal]], [[The Chiffons|Chiffon]] and [[The Ronettes|Ronette]], named after (and reminiscent of) [[girl group]]s of the 1960s.  The plant is named \"Audrey II\" in the musical, rather than the film's \"Audrey Junior\", and instead of being a crossbreed of a [[butterwort]] and a [[Venus Flytrap]], in the musical it is a creature from [[outer space]] intent on taking over the world.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference is the ending.  The musical ends with Orin, Mushnik, Audrey and Seymour all eaten by the plant, and the three girls report that Audrey II's progeny continues to consume people.  In the 1960 film, Mushnik and Audrey survive,  and the plant's carnivorous activities are discovered when its flowers bloom with the faces of its victims, including Seymour, imprinted on them.  The musical references this ending in its finale, in which the Plant's four victims' faces are seen in its blooming flowers. \n\nThe change in ending of the musical contributes to its portrayal of class struggles and moral values. While the 1986 film shows Seymour and Audrey escaping to the dream suburban house, encapsulating ideals of the 1950s [[American Dream]], the musical hints to a metaphorical portrayal of Seymour's greed as the plant.<ref>Jensen, Marc. \"Feed me!: Power struggles and the portrayal of race in ''Little Shop of Horrors''\", ''Cinema Journal'' 48, no. 1 (2008): 51\u201367</ref> Seymour's greed gradually consumes himself and Audrey. The musical engages with ideas relating to human values in the face of capitalist culture, disempowering those who are enveloped with motivations of personal monetary gain and overlook moral values. It serves as a social commentary of commodity fetishism.<ref>Leigh, Mary K., and Kevin K. Durand, eds. Marxism and the Movies: Critical Essays on Class Struggle in the Cinema.

A pre-Broadway production debuted at the Miracle Theatre in [[Coral Gables, Florida]] on May 16, 2003. Lee Wilkof, who originated the role of Seymour in 1982, was cast as Mr. Mushnik.

The second puppet is slightly larger than the first and is operated by Seymour during the song \"You Never Know\".  A fake arm in a sleeve matching Seymour's jacket is attached to the plant's pot, while the actor's real arm operates the plant.  The third puppet sits on the floor and is large enough to hide a person inside, who moves the plant's mouth in sync with Audrey II's voice, which is supplied by an offstage actor on a microphone.  The puppeteer's legs are clad in green tights with \"leaf\" shoes that serve as part of the plant's tendrils.  In Act II, the largest puppet again hides an actor inside, who manipulates the puppet's mouth and often some of its branches.  By this point, the head is at least six feet long and capable of \"swallowing\" characters.  For the finale, additions can be made to make the plant appear taller and even bigger.<ref name=MTI/> Actors and stage hands are often used to move larger branches and roots, which, in the original off-Broadway production, spilled off the stage and into the audience. In some productions, dangling vines over the house enhance the effect of Audrey II menacing the audience.\n\nAmateur productions of ''Little Shop of Horrors'' receive designs for building the puppets from [[Music Theatre International|MTI]], as part of the rental scripts and scores, based on the original Martin P. Robinson designs.  Some companies who have produced the show in the past and built their own puppets rent them out to other companies to recoup some of their construction costs.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.prattsburgh.wnyric.org/audrey_ii_rental.htm \"Prattsburgh Central School, Audrey II Rental\"]</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===1986 feature film===\n{{main|Little Shop of Horrors (film)}}\nA [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film version]] of the musical was made in 1986.  Directed by [[Frank Oz]] and noted as the only film written by [[Howard Ashman]], it starred [[Rick Moranis]] as Seymour, [[Ellen Greene]] as Audrey, [[Vincent Gardenia]] as Mr. Mushnik, [[Steve Martin]] as Orin Scrivello, DDS, and the voice of [[Levi Stubbs]] as Audrey II. [[Bill Murray]] played the small comic role of the masochist, Arthur Denton.  The 1986 film follows the plot of the musical closely but omits the songs \"Ya Never Know\" (rewritten as \"Some Fun Now,\" a trio for Crystal, Ronette and Chiffon), \"Mushnik and Son\", \"Now (It's Just the Gas)\", \"Sudden Changes,\" \"Closed for Renovation\" and \"Call Back in the Morning\"; the [[Final cut (film editing)|final cut]] ending also omits \"Finale Ultimo (Don't Feed The Plants)\".  Other changes include the removal of Mr. Mushnik's adoption proposition and a new ending, in which Seymour is able to save Audrey from Audrey II and then electrocutes the plant after it has destroyed the shop. Seymour and Audrey marry and move to the tract home of her dreams, but a small Audrey II-type bud is seen in their garden, which portends a possible spread of the alien plants.  An ending more faithful to the stage version was filmed, in which the plant eats Audrey and Seymour and then, having grown to massive size and reproduced, goes on a [[King Kong]]-style rampage through New York City.  It was received poorly by test audiences, and the upbeat alternate ending was used for the theatrical cut. In October 2012, the original ending was restored and released with the film as \"The Director's Cut\" on DVD and Blu-ray. A new song for Audrey II, \"Mean Green Mother from Outer Space\", was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for Best Original Song.\n\n===Planned feature film===\nA remake of the musical for feature film is planned by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], with [[Greg Berlanti]] directing.

The story follows a hapless florist shop worker who raises a plant that feeds on human blood and flesh.  The musical is based on the low-budget 1960 [[black comedy]] film ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]''.  The music, composed by Menken in the style of early 1960s [[rock and roll]], [[doo-wop]] and early [[Motown Records|Motown]], includes several well-known tunes, including the title song, \"Skid Row (Downtown)\", \"Somewhere That's Green\", and \"Suddenly, Seymour\".\n\nThe musical premiered [[Off-Off-Broadway]] in 1982 before moving to the [[Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan)|Orpheum Theatre]] [[Off-Broadway]], where it had a five-year run.  It later received numerous productions in the U.S. and abroad, and a subsequent [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production. Because of its small cast, it has become popular with [[community theatre]], school and other amateur groups.<ref>''[[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]]'' reported in its May 26, 2008 issue, p. 51, that this musical ranked as the most frequently produced musical by U.S. high schools in 2007.</ref>  The musical was also made into a 1986 [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film of the same name]], directed by [[Frank Oz]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nAn offstage voice recalls a time when the human race \"suddenly encountered a deadly threat to its very existence\". A trio of 1960s street urchins named Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon set the scene (\"Little Shop of Horrors\") and comment on the action throughout the show. Seymour Krelborn is a poor young man, an orphan living in an urban [[skid row]]. Audrey is a pretty blonde with a fashion sense that leans towards the tacky. They lament their stations in life and the urban blight in their neighborhood (\"Skid Row (Downtown)\"). They are co-workers at Mushnik's Skid Row Florists, a run-down flower shop owned and operated by the cranky Mr. Mushnik. Seymour has recently obtained a mysterious plant that looks like a large [[venus flytrap]]. While he was browsing the wholesale flower district, a sudden eclipse of the sun occurred, and when the light returned, the weird plant had appeared (\"Da-Doo\"). Seymour, who is secretly in love with Audrey, names the plant Audrey II in her honor.\n\nThe plant does not thrive in its new environment and appears to be dying. Seymour questions why it should be doing poorly, since he takes such good care of it. He accidentally pricks his finger on a rose thorn, which draws blood, and Audrey II's pod opens thirstily. Seymour realizes that Audrey II requires blood to survive and allows the plant to suckle from his finger (\"Grow For Me\"). As Audrey II grows, it becomes an attraction and starts generating brisk business for Mushnik. As the caretaker of the plant, the timid Seymour is suddenly regarded as a hero (\"Ya Never Know\"), while Audrey secretly longs to leave her abusive boyfriend. Her dream is to lead an ideal suburban life with Seymour, complete with a tract home, frozen dinners, and plastic on the furniture (\"Somewhere That's Green\").\n\nMeanwhile, the employees at Mushnik's are sprucing up the flower shop because of the popularity of the rapidly growing Audrey II and the revenue that it is bringing in (\"Closed for Renovation\"). Orin Scrivello, a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[Dentistry|dentist]], is Audrey's abusive boyfriend. Modeled after the \"Leader of the pack\" characters of the 1950s, Orin drives a motorcycle, wears leather, and enjoys bringing other people pain (\"Dentist!\"). Orin encourages Seymour to take the plant and get out of Skid Row. Realizing that his store's sudden profitability is completely dependent on the plant (and therefore on Seymour), Mushnik takes advantage of Seymour's innocence by offering to adopt him and make him a full partner in the business. Having always wanted a family, Seymour accepts, even though Mushnik has always yelled at him and treated him poorly (\"Mushnik and Son\"). However, Seymour is having difficulty providing enough blood to keep Audrey II healthy. When Seymour stops feeding the plant, Audrey II reveals that it can speak. It demands blood and promises that, if fed, it will make sure that all of Seymour's dreams come true. Seymour initially refuses, but he then witnesses Orin abusing Audrey. The plant presents this as a justification for killing Orin. Not realizing that he is being manipulated again, Seymour gives in to his baser instincts and agrees (\"Feed Me (Git It)\"). \n\nHe sets up a late-night appointment with Orin, intending to kill him. However, Seymour loses his nerve and decides not to commit the crime. Unfortunately for Orin, who is getting high on [[nitrous oxide]], the gas device is stuck in the \"on\" position, and he suffocates while asking Seymour to save him. Seymour cannot bring himself to shoot Orin but lets him die of asphyxiation (\"Now (It's Just The Gas)\"). Seymour feeds Orin's body to the now huge Audrey II, and the plant consumes it with ravenous glee (\"Act I Finale\").\n\n===Act II===\n{{Listen\n|filename=Suddenly, Seymour - 2003 revival.ogg\n|title=\"Suddenly, Seymour\"\n|description=The beginning of the last chorus of \"Suddenly, Seymour\", performed by Kerry Butler and Hunter Foster on the 2003 Broadway revival cast recording.}}\n\nThe flower shop is much busier, and Seymour and Audrey have trouble keeping up with the onslaught of orders (\"Call Back in the Morning\"). Audrey confides to Seymour that she feels guilty about Orin's disappearance, because she secretly wished it. The two admit their feelings for one another, and Seymour promises that he will protect and care for Audrey from now on (\"Suddenly, Seymour\"). The two plan to leave together and start a new life, although Seymour mistakenly attributes Audrey's feelings to his newfound fame, not realizing that she loved him even before he found the plant.\n\nBefore they can go, Mushnik confronts Seymour about Orin's death. Mushnik has put two and two together: the bloody dentist's uniform, the drops of blood on the floor, and he has seen Seymour and Audrey kissing. Seymour denies killing Orin, but Mushnik wants him to give a statement to the police, who have begun investigating. Audrey II tells Seymour that he has to be rid of Mushnik or he will lose everything, including Audrey (\"Suppertime\"). Seymour tells Mushnik that he put the days' receipts inside Audrey II for safekeeping. Mushnik climbs inside the plant's gaping maw to search for the money, realizing the deception too late, and screams as he is devoured. Seymour now runs the flower shop, and reporters, salesmen, lawyers and agents approach him, promising him fame and fortune. Although tempted by the trappings of his success, Seymour realizes that it is only a matter of time before Audrey II will kill again and that he is morally responsible. He considers destroying the plant but believing that his fame is the only thing that is earning him Audrey's love, he is unable to do so (\"The Meek Shall Inherit\").\n\nAs Seymour works on his speech for a lecture tour, Audrey II again squalls for blood.  Seymour threatens to kill it just as Audrey walks in asking when Mushnik will return from visiting his \"sick sister\". Seymour learns that Audrey would still love him without the fame and decides that Audrey II must die after the scheduled [[LIFE magazine|''LIFE'' magazine]] interview at the shop. Audrey is confused and frightened by Seymour's ramblings, but she runs home by his order.  That night, unable to sleep and distressed by Seymour's strange behavior, Audrey goes to the flower shop to talk with him.  He is not there, and Audrey II begs her to water him. Not sensing the mortal danger, she approaches to water it, and a vine wraps around her and pulls her into the plant's gaping maw (\"[[Sominex]]/Suppertime II\"). Seymour arrives and attacks the plant in an attempt to save Audrey. He pulls her out, but Audrey is mortally wounded.  Her dying wish is for Seymour to feed her to the plant after she dies so that they can always be together. She dies in his arms, and he reluctantly honors her request (\"Somewhere That's Green\" (reprise)). Seymour falls asleep as Audrey II grows small red flower buds.\n\nThe next day, Patrick Martin from the World Botanical Enterprises tells Seymour that his company wishes to take leaf [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of Audrey II and sell them across America. Seymour realizes the plant's evil plan: during the [[solar eclipse]], Audrey II came from an unknown planet to conquer Earth. He tries shooting, cutting, and poisoning the plant, but it has grown too hardy to kill.  Seymour, in desperation, runs into its open jaws with a [[machete]] planning to kill it from the inside, but he is quickly eaten. Patrick, Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon search for Seymour. Not finding him, Patrick tells the girls to take the cuttings.\n\nCrystal, Ronette, and Chiffon relate that, following these events, other plants appeared across America, tricking innocent people into feeding them blood in exchange for fame and fortune. Out of the fog, Audrey II, bigger than ever, appears with opened new flowers revealing the faces of Seymour, Audrey, Mushnik and Orin, who beg that, no matter how persuasive the plants may be, they must not be fed (\"Finale Ultimo: Don't Feed the Plants\"). Audrey II slithers towards the audience threateningly (In the original Off-Broadway production, plant tendrils fell all over the audience, as if each audience member were to be pulled into the plant, while in the Broadway production, a monstrously huge Audrey II was projected out over the fifth row and the balcony seats, as if it would eat the audience members).\n\n==Original production==\n===Off-Broadway===\nThe [[musical theater|musical]] had its world premiere [[Off-Off-Broadway]] on May 6, 1982 at the Workshop of the Players Art Foundation (WPA\u00a0Theatre), playing there until June 6, 1982.<ref>[http://howardashman.com/theatre.html \"Theater: ''Little Shop of Horrors''\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209054052/http://howardashman.com/theatre.html |date=2015-02-09 }}, Howard Ashman website, accessed April 21, 2014</ref>  It opened [[Off-Broadway]] at the [[Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan)|Orpheum Theatre]] in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] on July 27, 1982.

The setting is moved from [[Skid Row, Los Angeles]] to Skid Row in New York. Seymour's [[hypochondriac]]al [[Jewish mother stereotype|Jewish mother]] is omitted in the musical, and Seymour becomes an orphan in the care of Mushnik. Also dropped is the subplot involving the two investigating police officers.  The characters of Mrs. Siddie Shiva and Burson Fouch are also omitted, although Mrs. Shiva is mentioned as being the shop's biggest funeral account. The gleefully [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]] dental patient, originally played by [[Jack Nicholson]], is not in the musical but is in the 1986 film, played by [[Bill Murray]].<!-- MURRAY PLAYED THE MASOCHIST.  STEVE MARTIN WAS THE DENTIST.  PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS! -->\n\nIn the musical, the sadistic dentist, Orin Scrivello, is killed by suffocation from [[laughing gas]] instead of being stabbed with a dental instrument as in the film.  His abusive relationship with Audrey is added to the musical to give Seymour a motive to kill him.  In the film, Seymour murders several innocent bystanders, and Mushnik tricks a thief into looking for money inside the plant, which eats the thief.  In the musical, Seymour tricks Mushnik in the same way when Mushnik plans to turn Seymour over to the police.  The two neighborhood girls in the film are replaced in the musical by a chorus of three street urchins: [[The Crystals|Crystal]], [[The Chiffons|Chiffon]] and [[The Ronettes|Ronette]], named after (and reminiscent of) [[girl group]]s of the 1960s.  The plant is named \"Audrey II\" in the musical, rather than the film's \"Audrey Junior\", and instead of being a crossbreed of a [[butterwort]] and a [[Venus Flytrap]], in the musical it is a creature from [[outer space]] intent on taking over the world.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference is the ending.  The musical ends with Orin, Mushnik, Audrey and Seymour all eaten by the plant, and the three girls report that Audrey II's progeny continues to consume people.  In the 1960 film, Mushnik and Audrey survive,  and the plant's carnivorous activities are discovered when its flowers bloom with the faces of its victims, including Seymour, imprinted on them.  The musical references this ending in its finale, in which the Plant's four victims' faces are seen in its blooming flowers. \n\nThe change in ending of the musical contributes to its portrayal of class struggles and moral values. While the 1986 film shows Seymour and Audrey escaping to the dream suburban house, encapsulating ideals of the 1950s [[American Dream]], the musical hints to a metaphorical portrayal of Seymour's greed as the plant.<ref>Jensen, Marc. \"Feed me!: Power struggles and the portrayal of race in ''Little Shop of Horrors''\", ''Cinema Journal'' 48, no. 1 (2008): 51\u201367</ref> Seymour's greed gradually consumes himself and Audrey. The musical engages with ideas relating to human values in the face of capitalist culture, disempowering those who are enveloped with motivations of personal monetary gain and overlook moral values. It serves as a social commentary of commodity fetishism.<ref>Leigh, Mary K., and Kevin K. Durand, eds. Marxism and the Movies: Critical Essays on Class Struggle in the Cinema.

It has a huge, nasty-looking pod that gains a shark-like aspect when open and snapping at food. The creature is played by a series of increasing[ly] large puppets\".<ref name=MTI>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtishows.com/show_detail.asp?showid=000188|title=\"Little Shop of Horrors\", Casting \u2013 Character Breakdown|accessdate=25 December 2008|author=Music Theatre International}}</ref>\n\nIn productions, the first puppet is a small potted plant \"less than one foot tall\" held by the actor portraying Seymour.<ref name=MTI/>  He manipulates the plant himself with his hand and then sets it down, where it is moved by an unseen hand from beneath a shelf.  The second puppet is slightly larger than the first and is operated by Seymour during the song \"You Never Know\".  A fake arm in a sleeve matching Seymour's jacket is attached to the plant's pot, while the actor's real arm operates the plant.  The third puppet sits on the floor and is large enough to hide a person inside, who moves the plant's mouth in sync with Audrey II's voice, which is supplied by an offstage actor on a microphone.  The puppeteer's legs are clad in green tights with \"leaf\" shoes that serve as part of the plant's tendrils.  In Act II, the largest puppet again hides an actor inside, who manipulates the puppet's mouth and often some of its branches.  By this point, the head is at least six feet long and capable of \"swallowing\" characters.  For the finale, additions can be made to make the plant appear taller and even bigger.<ref name=MTI/> Actors and stage hands are often used to move larger branches and roots, which, in the original off-Broadway production, spilled off the stage and into the audience. In some productions, dangling vines over the house enhance the effect of Audrey II menacing the audience.\n\nAmateur productions of ''Little Shop of Horrors'' receive designs for building the puppets from [[Music Theatre International|MTI]], as part of the rental scripts and scores, based on the original Martin P. Robinson designs.  Some companies who have produced the show in the past and built their own puppets rent them out to other companies to recoup some of their construction costs.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.prattsburgh.wnyric.org/audrey_ii_rental.htm \"Prattsburgh Central School, Audrey II Rental\"]</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===1986 feature film===\n{{main|Little Shop of Horrors (film)}}\nA [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film version]] of the musical was made in 1986.  Directed by [[Frank Oz]] and noted as the only film written by [[Howard Ashman]], it starred [[Rick Moranis]] as Seymour, [[Ellen Greene]] as Audrey, [[Vincent Gardenia]] as Mr. Mushnik, [[Steve Martin]] as Orin Scrivello, DDS, and the voice of [[Levi Stubbs]] as Audrey II. [[Bill Murray]] played the small comic role of the masochist, Arthur Denton.  The 1986 film follows the plot of the musical closely but omits the songs \"Ya Never Know\" (rewritten as \"Some Fun Now,\" a trio for Crystal, Ronette and Chiffon), \"Mushnik and Son\", \"Now (It's Just the Gas)\", \"Sudden Changes,\" \"Closed for Renovation\" and \"Call Back in the Morning\"; the [[Final cut (film editing)|final cut]] ending also omits \"Finale Ultimo (Don't Feed The Plants)\".  Other changes include the removal of Mr. Mushnik's adoption proposition and a new ending, in which Seymour is able to save Audrey from Audrey II and then electrocutes the plant after it has destroyed the shop. Seymour and Audrey marry and move to the tract home of her dreams, but a small Audrey II-type bud is seen in their garden, which portends a possible spread of the alien plants.  An ending more faithful to the stage version was filmed, in which the plant eats Audrey and Seymour and then, having grown to massive size and reproduced, goes on a [[King Kong]]-style rampage through New York City.  It was received poorly by test audiences, and the upbeat alternate ending was used for the theatrical cut. In October 2012, the original ending was restored and released with the film as \"The Director's Cut\" on DVD and Blu-ray. A new song for Audrey II, \"Mean Green Mother from Outer Space\", was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for Best Original Song.\n\n===Planned feature film===\nA remake of the musical for feature film is planned by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], with [[Greg Berlanti]] directing. [[Billy Porter (entertainer)|Billy Porter]] has been cast as the voice of Audrey II.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/chris-evans-talks-star-little-shop-horrors-1280781 | title = Chris Evans in Talks to Star in Greg Berlanti's 'Little Shop of Horrors' | first = Borys | last = Kit | date = February 24, 2020 | accessdate = February 24, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Ganzl, Kurt.

The Gangsta Walk is commonly performed to [[crunk]] music due to the particular 'bounce' in the beat and the movement the dancers make to keep with it. Though Gangsta Walking has been around for many years, much of the dance is still exclusive to the city and surrounding areas.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nGangsta walk was created in Memphis. Originated by the group G-Style who released the first Gangsta walk video ever titled \u201cG-Style Gangsta\" that consisted of Romeo, Wolf, and Hurricane, who went on to land a production deal with [[Dallas Austin]] behind the groups Boyz II Men, Monica, Another Bad Creation and TLC to name a few. They went on to land a major record deal with P. Diddy's Bad Boy entertainment and the first group to launch Bad Boy South. From the group success and their early video release from the song G-Style \u201dGangsta\".

The group continues to be a major part on the Memphis music scene with Romeo's latest business venture Romeo Franklin Productions that focus on training dancers, choreography and video and music productions. This unsung group as quiet as kept has been one of the major forces in getting Memphis music on the map.\n\n==Development==\nDue to video streaming websites like [[YouTube]] and social networks like [[myspace.com]] and others, \"gangsta walking\", \"jookin', \"choppin\", \"buckin\" or whatever it may be called, has spread in popularity. In 2007, Memphis rapper\u2013director\u2013producer [[Young Jai]], of Jai Productions / Black Star Enterprisers, released ''Memphis Jookin Vol 1'' DVD.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0B343DA3B7F543C3</ref>  This DVD featured the new generation of jookers/Gangsta Walkers.

This DVD helped springboard the Jookin/ Gangsta Walking movement. In November 2007, Jookin was featured on Channel 3 [[WREG-TV]] news in Memphis and also on Channel 5 [[WMC-TV]]. There are several videos on Jookin on memphisjookin.com <ref>[http://www.memphisjookin.com memphisjookin.com]</ref> and Youtube.com, with some videos receiving millions of views.

Jai Productions has also released the entire Memphis Jookin Vol 2. 3-part series, which showcases more of the Jookin community that is involved in the movement to help get this dance on the map. Nowadays our youth have somewhere to go and learn the Memphis style. Memphian [http://udigdance.com/faculty/ Tarrik Moore] And Marico Flake (Dr Rico) originally opened [http://udigdance.com U-Dig Jookin Academy] in the once [[Raleigh Springs Mall]], but have since renamed to [https://www.mjurbanballet.com Memphis Jookin Urban Ballet] after the mall was closed.\n\n==Perception of Gangsta Walking==\nAlong with being a popular street dance, the Gangsta Walk is often viewed as a form of self-expression and relief from the hardships of living within the inner city. Some have even considered Gangsta Walking as being a less extreme kin of [[Krumping]] due to it steering many of the youth away from street violence and exacting their energy into something positive and constructive. The dance can commonly be found in urban areas of Memphis like [[North Memphis]], [[South Memphis]], [[Orange Mound]], [[Whitehaven, Memphis|Whitehaven]], [[West Memphis]]  etc.\n\n==Types of Gangsta Walk==\nThere are variations of styles for the Gangsta Walk:\n\n* One particular style requires the dancer to take (in a jerking motion) quick steps, stomp, twists and throwing their arms around all while moving to a beat, the best example being [[Crunchy Black]]'s style, referred to as ''G-Walking''.<ref>[http://www.memphisrap.com/category/videos/ MemphisRap.com]</ref> The style is considered the basis of all Gangsta Walking done in Memphis since the 1980s.\n* Another style requires three or more people hopping around in a circle in a rhythmic motion, while throwing their hands into the air and yelling \"Get Buck\" or the lyrics to a Buck song. This style of the Gangsta Walk is more commonly referred to as the ''G-Train''. It is said that this style was banned from the clubs shortly after being created due to the wildness it invoked in performers as well as onlookers. Reminders of its existence are still left behind in older clubs or closed down night spots around the city.<ref>[http://www.beerandrap.com/wp/ Beer and Rap]</ref>\n* The most known style of Gangsta Walking is within the standard crunk atmosphere, involving a crowd of people slamming and pushing off one another on the dance floor.\n* The most famous and practiced style of Gangsta Walking around the city takes bits and pieces from other street dance styles like [[liquid dancing]] (the [[Waving (dance)|wave]], tutting, tracing, contours and hand flowing), the [[The Robot (dance)|robot]], locking, popping, gliding and even breakdancing all merged with the traditional dance. The most recognizable moves in the dance are the dancers doing moves similar to the [[Two-step (dance move)|two-step]] between making another motion and spinning or walking on the tips of their toes. This style of the Gangsta Walk is mostly done by the younger generation and the generation behind them who grew up shortly after the invention of Buck music, thus titling it ''Buckin''.\n* Jookin' took the classic steps and combined a much smoother look caused by the music change in Memphis Music during the early 1990s. Jookin is most noted for not only its smooth steps, but its heavy introduction of pantomiming into the dance styles. Jookin' emphasized footwork in a way that focused the crowds attention on the feet. Jookin is especially characterized by the dancers' abilities in sliding and stepping movements.\n* Buckin' brought in the exaggerated movements of Gangsta walkin and Jookin.  The movements were made to appear more expansive due to the buckness (exaggerated style) of the dancer \u2013  the most explosive style of Gangsta walking. Buckers began to lift the slide (of the feet) off the ground, creating even higher glides than ever seen before.\n* Choppin' came in the mid 1990s as dancers in Memphis started to add the animated effect of Gangsta walkin, jookin, and buckin to the dance floor.  Choppin' consisted of stiffening the muscles until they began to vibrate and then moving while trying to create a very unreal stiff Gangsta walk.\n* Icin', the newest form of Gansta walkin', is most known for the ability to slide with one foot while gliding with the other. Icers give the illusions of ice skating through the explosiveness of the movements they applied while gliding across the floor. Some nickname it \"Blazing.\" Icin' also included different ways of freezing the body parts while carrying oneself around the floor.\n* Basics of all the styles include stepping, pacmans,<ref>[http://makeup.wonderhowto.com/how-to/do-pacman-arm-wave-dance-move-368868/ \"How to Do the PacMan arm wave dance move\" (2010) WonderHowTo]</ref> and buck jumps.<ref>[http://www.genconnect.com/aspen-ideas-festival-2014/dance-sensation-lil-buck-teaches-us-how-to-buck-jump/ \"Dance Sensation Lil Buck Teaches Us How to 'Buck Jump{{'\"}} (June 29, 2014) genConnect]</ref>\n\n==Music videos ==\n* [[Al Kapone]] - \"Buckin' and Jookin{{'\"}}<ref>{{YouTube | id=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEhCzfl79CQ | title= Buckin' and Jookin'}}</ref>\n* [[Three 6 Mafia]] feat.[[Chamillionaire]] - \"[[Doe Boy Fresh]]\"\n* Three 6 Mafia feat.

There are several videos on Jookin on memphisjookin.com <ref>[http://www.memphisjookin.com memphisjookin.com]</ref> and Youtube.com, with some videos receiving millions of views. Jai Productions and The Memphis Jookin community was also featured in the December 2007 issue of the French magazine ''[[Juste Debout]]'' as the Dance of the Month.<ref>[http://www.commercialappeal.com/lifestyle/memphis-jookin \"Jookin' is tough to master, but it is catching the world's attention\" (Aug 23, 2008) ''The Commercial Appeal'', Memphis]</ref> Jai productions also released a solo Jookin DVD on G-Nerd entitled \"Truth Be Told\" and Tutorial entitled \"Memphis Jookin wit G-Nerd\". Jai Productions has also released the entire Memphis Jookin Vol 2. 3-part series, which showcases more of the Jookin community that is involved in the movement to help get this dance on the map. Nowadays our youth have somewhere to go and learn the Memphis style. Memphian [http://udigdance.com/faculty/ Tarrik Moore] And Marico Flake (Dr Rico) originally opened [http://udigdance.com U-Dig Jookin Academy] in the once [[Raleigh Springs Mall]], but have since renamed to [https://www.mjurbanballet.com Memphis Jookin Urban Ballet] after the mall was closed.\n\n==Perception of Gangsta Walking==\nAlong with being a popular street dance, the Gangsta Walk is often viewed as a form of self-expression and relief from the hardships of living within the inner city. Some have even considered Gangsta Walking as being a less extreme kin of [[Krumping]] due to it steering many of the youth away from street violence and exacting their energy into something positive and constructive. The dance can commonly be found in urban areas of Memphis like [[North Memphis]], [[South Memphis]], [[Orange Mound]], [[Whitehaven, Memphis|Whitehaven]], [[West Memphis]]  etc.\n\n==Types of Gangsta Walk==\nThere are variations of styles for the Gangsta Walk:\n\n* One particular style requires the dancer to take (in a jerking motion) quick steps, stomp, twists and throwing their arms around all while moving to a beat, the best example being [[Crunchy Black]]'s style, referred to as ''G-Walking''.<ref>[http://www.memphisrap.com/category/videos/ MemphisRap.com]</ref> The style is considered the basis of all Gangsta Walking done in Memphis since the 1980s.\n* Another style requires three or more people hopping around in a circle in a rhythmic motion, while throwing their hands into the air and yelling \"Get Buck\" or the lyrics to a Buck song. This style of the Gangsta Walk is more commonly referred to as the ''G-Train''. It is said that this style was banned from the clubs shortly after being created due to the wildness it invoked in performers as well as onlookers. Reminders of its existence are still left behind in older clubs or closed down night spots around the city.<ref>[http://www.beerandrap.com/wp/ Beer and Rap]</ref>\n* The most known style of Gangsta Walking is within the standard crunk atmosphere, involving a crowd of people slamming and pushing off one another on the dance floor.\n* The most famous and practiced style of Gangsta Walking around the city takes bits and pieces from other street dance styles like [[liquid dancing]] (the [[Waving (dance)|wave]], tutting, tracing, contours and hand flowing), the [[The Robot (dance)|robot]], locking, popping, gliding and even breakdancing all merged with the traditional dance. The most recognizable moves in the dance are the dancers doing moves similar to the [[Two-step (dance move)|two-step]] between making another motion and spinning or walking on the tips of their toes. This style of the Gangsta Walk is mostly done by the younger generation and the generation behind them who grew up shortly after the invention of Buck music, thus titling it ''Buckin''.\n* Jookin' took the classic steps and combined a much smoother look caused by the music change in Memphis Music during the early 1990s. Jookin is most noted for not only its smooth steps, but its heavy introduction of pantomiming into the dance styles. Jookin' emphasized footwork in a way that focused the crowds attention on the feet. Jookin is especially characterized by the dancers' abilities in sliding and stepping movements.\n* Buckin' brought in the exaggerated movements of Gangsta walkin and Jookin.  The movements were made to appear more expansive due to the buckness (exaggerated style) of the dancer \u2013  the most explosive style of Gangsta walking. Buckers began to lift the slide (of the feet) off the ground, creating even higher glides than ever seen before.\n* Choppin' came in the mid 1990s as dancers in Memphis started to add the animated effect of Gangsta walkin, jookin, and buckin to the dance floor.  Choppin' consisted of stiffening the muscles until they began to vibrate and then moving while trying to create a very unreal stiff Gangsta walk.\n* Icin', the newest form of Gansta walkin', is most known for the ability to slide with one foot while gliding with the other. Icers give the illusions of ice skating through the explosiveness of the movements they applied while gliding across the floor. Some nickname it \"Blazing.\" Icin' also included different ways of freezing the body parts while carrying oneself around the floor.\n* Basics of all the styles include stepping, pacmans,<ref>[http://makeup.wonderhowto.com/how-to/do-pacman-arm-wave-dance-move-368868/ \"How to Do the PacMan arm wave dance move\" (2010) WonderHowTo]</ref> and buck jumps.<ref>[http://www.genconnect.com/aspen-ideas-festival-2014/dance-sensation-lil-buck-teaches-us-how-to-buck-jump/ \"Dance Sensation Lil Buck Teaches Us How to 'Buck Jump{{'\"}} (June 29, 2014) genConnect]</ref>\n\n==Music videos ==\n* [[Al Kapone]] - \"Buckin' and Jookin{{'\"}}<ref>{{YouTube | id=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEhCzfl79CQ | title= Buckin' and Jookin'}}</ref>\n* [[Three 6 Mafia]] feat.[[Chamillionaire]] - \"[[Doe Boy Fresh]]\"\n* Three 6 Mafia feat.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] era. Schumann left the study of law, intending to pursue a career as a [[virtuoso]] pianist. His teacher, [[Friedrich Wieck]], a German pianist, had assured him that he could become the finest pianist in Europe, but a hand injury ended this dream. Schumann then focused his musical energies on composing.\n\nIn 1840, after a long and acrimonious legal battle with Wieck, who opposed the marriage, Schumann married Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]]. A lifelong partnership in music began, as Clara herself was an established pianist and music prodigy. Clara and Robert also maintained a close relationship with German composer [[Johannes Brahms]].\n\nUntil 1840, Schumann wrote exclusively for the piano. Later, he composed piano and orchestral works, and many [[Lied]]er (songs for voice and piano). He composed four [[Symphony|symphonies]], one [[opera]], and other orchestral, [[choral]], and [[chamber music|chamber]] works. His best-known works include ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', ''[[Kinderszenen]]'', ''[[Kreisleriana]]'', and the ''[[Fantasie in C (Schumann)|Fantasie in C]]''. Schumann was known for infusing his music with characters through motifs, as well as references to works of literature. These characters bled into his editorial writing in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik]]'' (New Journal for Music), a [[Leipzig]]-based publication that he co-founded.\n\nSchumann suffered from a [[mental disorder]] that first manifested in 1833 as a severe [[melancholic depression|melancholic depressive]] episode\u2014which recurred several times alternating with phases of \"exaltation\" and increasingly also delusional ideas of being poisoned or threatened with metallic items. What is now thought to have been a combination of [[bipolar disorder]] and perhaps [[mercury poisoning]] led to \"manic\" and \"depressive\" periods in Schumann's compositional productivity. After a suicide attempt in 1854, Schumann was admitted at his own request to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] in [[Endenich]] near [[Bonn]]. Diagnosed with ''psychotic [[melancholia]]'', he died of pneumonia two years later at the age of 44, without recovering from his mental illness.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Schumannhaus ALT.JPG|thumb|left|Schumann's birth house, now the [[Robert Schumann House]], after an anonymous colourized lithograph]]\n[[File:Rob.Schumann.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] of Robert Schumann in the museum of [[Zwickau]]]]\n\nSchumann was born in [[Zwickau]], in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] (today [[Central Germany (cultural area)|Central Germany]]), the fifth and last child of Johanna Christiane (n\u00e9e Schnabel) and August Schumann.<ref>{{harvnb|Ostwald|1985|p=11}}</ref> Schumann began to compose before the age of seven, but his boyhood was spent in the cultivation of literature as much as music\u2014undoubtedly influenced by his father, a bookseller, publisher, and novelist.<ref>{{harvnb|Schumann|1982}}</ref>\n\nAt age seven, Schumann began studying general music and piano with Johann Gottfried Kuntzsch, a teacher at the Zwickau high school. The boy immediately developed a love of music, and worked on his own compositions, without the aid of Kuntzsch. Even though he often disregarded the principles of musical composition, he created works regarded as admirable for his age. The ''Universal Journal of Music'' 1850 supplement included a biographical sketch of Schumann that noted, \"It has been related that Schumann, as a child, possessed rare taste and talent for portraying feelings and characteristic traits in melody,\u2014ay, he could sketch the different dispositions of his intimate friends by certain figures and passages on the piano so exactly and comically that everyone burst into loud laughter at the similitude of the portrait.\"<ref>[[Eric Himy]], pianist, Recording ''Homage to Schumann'', CD Notes, (Centaur, 2006), CEN 2858, chosen by BBC December 2007 as CD of the month, includes \"Kinderscenen\", \"Tr\u00e4umerei\"</ref>\n\nAt age 12, Schumann wrote an essay on the aesthetics of music and also contributed to a volume, edited by his father, titled ''Portraits of Famous Men''. While still at school in Zwickau, he read the works of the German poet-philosophers [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], as well as [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and the [[Tragedy#Ancient Greek tragedy|Greek tragedians]]. His most powerful and permanent literary inspiration was [[Jean Paul]], a German writer whose influence is seen in Schumann's youthful novels ''Juniusabende'', completed in 1826, and ''Selene''.\n\nSchumann's interest in music was sparked by attending a performance of [[Ignaz Moscheles]] playing at [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]], and he later developed an interest in the works of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]. His father, who had encouraged his musical aspirations, died in 1826 when Schumann was 16. Thereafter, neither his mother nor his guardian encouraged him to pursue a music career. In 1828, Schumann left high school, and after a trip during which he met the poet [[Heinrich Heine]] in Munich, he left to study law at the University of Leipzig under family pressure. But in Leipzig Schumann instead focused on improvisation, song composition, and writing novels. He also began to seriously study piano with Friedrick Wieck, a well-known piano teacher. In 1829, he continued his law studies in [[Heidelberg]], where he became a lifelong member of [[Corps Saxo-Borussia Heidelberg]].\n\n{{See also|German Student Corps|Corps}}\n\n===1830\u201334===\n[[File:Robert-Schumann-Haus.JPG|thumb|upright|Schumann's music room in Zwickau]]\n\nDuring [[Eastertide]] 1830, he heard the Italian violinist, violist, guitarist, and composer [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]] play in [[Frankfurt]]. In July he wrote to his mother, \"My whole life has been a struggle between Poetry and Prose, or call it Music and Law.\" With her permission, by Christmas he was back in Leipzig, at age 20 taking piano lessons from his old master [[Friedrich Wieck]], who assured him that he would be a successful concert pianist after a few years' study with him.<ref>{{harvnb|Perrey|2007|p=11}}</ref> During his studies with Wieck, some stories claim that Schumann permanently injured a finger on his right hand. Wieck claimed that Schumann damaged his finger by using a mechanical device that held back one finger while he exercised the others\u2014which was supposed to strengthen the weakest fingers.<ref name=\":0\">{{harvnb|Jensen|2001}}</ref> [[Clara Schumann]] discredited the story, saying the disability was not due to a mechanical device, and Robert Schumann himself referred to it as \"an affliction of the whole hand.\" Some argue that, as the disability appeared to have been chronic and have affected the hand, and not just a finger, it was not likely caused by a finger strengthening device.<ref>{{cite journal| jstor= 954772 | first= Eric| last= Sams | title= Schumann's hand injury| journal= The Musical Times| volume= 112| pages= 1156\u20131159| number= 1546 |date= December 1971| doi= 10.2307/954772}}</ref>\n\nSchumann abandoned the idea of a concert career and devoted himself instead to composition. To this end he began a study of music theory under [[Heinrich Dorn]], a German composer six years his senior and, at that time, conductor of the [[Leipzig Opera]].\n\n====''Papillons''====\nSchumann's fusion of literary ideas with musical ones\u2014known as [[program music]]\u2014may have first taken shape in ''[[Papillons]]'', Op. 2 (''Butterflies''), a musical portrayal of events in [[Jean Paul]]'s novel ''Die Flegeljahre''. In a letter from Leipzig dated April 1832, Schumann bids his brothers, \"Read the last scene in Jean Paul's ''Flegeljahre'' as soon as possible, because the ''Papillons'' are intended as a musical representation of that masquerade.\" This inspiration is foreshadowed to some extent in his first written criticism\u2014an 1831 essay on [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]'s [[Variations on \"L\u00e0 ci darem la mano\" (Chopin)|variations on a theme]] from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', published in the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]''. In it, Schumann\ncreates imaginary characters who discuss Chopin's work: Florestan (the embodiment of Schumann's passionate, voluble side) and Eusebius (his dreamy, introspective side)\u2014the counterparts of Vult and Walt in ''Flegeljahre.'' They call on a third, Meister Raro, for his opinion. Raro may represent either the composer himself, Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]], or the combination of the two (Cla'''ra''' + '''Ro'''bert).\n\nIn the winter of 1832, at age 20, Schumann visited relatives in Zwickau and [[Schneeberg, Saxony|Schneeberg]], where he performed the first movement of his ''Symphony in G minor'' (without opus number, known as the \"Zwickauer\"). In Zwickau, the music was performed at a concert given by Clara Wieck, who was then just 13 years old. On this occasion Clara played bravura Variations by [[Henri Herz]], a composer whom Schumann was already deriding as a philistine.<ref>Robert Schumann, musical Journal</ref> Schumann's mother said to Clara, \"You must marry my Robert one day.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Litzmann|1913}}</ref> The ''Symphony in G minor'' was not published during Schumann's lifetime but has been played and recorded in recent times.\n\nThe 1833 deaths of Schumann's brother Julius and his sister-in-law Rosalie in the [[Second cholera pandemic (1829-1851)|worldwide cholera pandemic]] brought on a [[Major depressive disorder|severe depressive]] episode.\n\n[[File:Robert Schumann in youth.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A youthful Robert Schumann]]\n\n====''Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik''====\nBy spring 1834, Schumann had sufficiently recovered to inaugurate ''[[Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik|Die Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik]]'' (\"New Journal for Music\"), first published on 3 April 1834. In his writings, Schumann created a fictional music society based on people in his life, called the ''[[Davidsb\u00fcndler]]'', named after the biblical King David who fought against the Philistines. Schumann published most of his critical writings in the journal, and often lambasted the popular taste for flashy technical displays from figures whom Schumann perceived as inferior composers, or \"philistines\". Schumann campaigned to revive interest in major composers of the past, including [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]. He also promoted the work of some contemporary composers, including [[Chopin]] (about whom Schumann famously wrote, \"Hats off, Gentlemen! A genius!\")<ref>[[Vladimir Ashkenazy]]'s notes, Favourite Chopin</ref> and [[Hector Berlioz]], whom he praised for creating music of substance. On the other hand, Schumann disparaged the school of [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner]]. Among Schumann's associates at this time were composers [[Norbert Burgm\u00fcller]] and [[Ludwig Schuncke]] (to whom Schumann dedicated his ''Toccata in C'').\n\nDuring the summer of 1834 Schumann became engaged to 16-year-old Ernestine von Fricken, the adopted daughter of a rich Bohemian-born noble. In August 1835, he learned that Ernestine von Fricken was born illegitimate, which meant that she would have no dowry. Fearful that her limited means would force him to earn his living like a \"day-labourer,\" Schumann made a complete break with her toward the end of the year. He felt a growing attraction to 15-year-old Clara Wieck. They made mutual declarations of love in December in Zwickau, where Clara appeared in concert. His budding romance with Clara was disrupted when her father learned of their trysts during the Christmas holidays. He summarily forbade them further meetings, and ordered all their correspondence burnt.\n\n====''Carnaval''====\n''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', Op. 9 (1834) is one of Schumann's most characteristic piano works. Schumann begins nearly every section of ''Carnaval'' with a [[musical cryptogram]], the musical notes signified in German by the letters that spell [[A\u0161|Asch]] (A, E-flat, C, and B, or alternatively A-flat, C, and B; in German these are A, Es, C and H, and As, C and H respectively), the [[Bohemia]]n town in which Ernestine was born, and the notes are also the musical letters in Schumann's own name. Eusebius and Florestan, the imaginary figures appearing so often in his critical writings, also appear, alongside brilliant imitations of Chopin and Paganini. To each of these characters he devotes a section of ''Carnaval''. The work comes to a close with a march of the ''Davidsb\u00fcndler''\u2014the league of [[King David]]'s men against the [[Philistines]]\u2014in which may be heard the clear accents of truth in contest with the dull clamour of falsehood embodied in a [[Musical quotation|quotation]] from the seventeenth century ''[[Grossvatertanz|Grandfather's Dance]]''. The march, a step nearly always in duple meter, is here in 3/4 time (triple meter). The work ends in joy and a degree of mock-triumph. In ''Carnaval'', Schumann went further than in ''Papillons'', by conceiving the story as well as the musical representation (and also displaying a maturation of compositional resource).\n\n===1835\u201339===\nOn 3 October 1835, Schumann met [[Felix Mendelssohn]] at Wieck's house in Leipzig, and his enthusiastic appreciation of that artist<ref>{{harvnb|Daverio|1997|p=134}}</ref> was shown with the same generous freedom that distinguished his acknowledgement of the greatness of Chopin and other colleagues, and later prompted him to publicly pronounce the then-unknown [[Johannes Brahms]] a genius.\n[[File:Andreas Staub - Clara Wieck (Lithographie 1839, cropped).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|[[Clara Wieck]] in an idealized lithograph by [[Andreas Staub]], c. 1839]]\n[[File:Friedrich Wieck um 1838.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Wieck]] in a sketch by [[Pauline Viardot-Garcia]], around 1838]]\n\nIn 1837 Schumann published his ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', a complex set of ''\u00e9tude''-like variations written in 1834\u20131835, which demanded a finished piano technique. These variations were based on a theme by the adoptive father of Ernestine von Fricken. The work\u2014described as \"one of the peaks of the piano literature, lofty in conception and faultless in workmanship\" [Hutcheson]\u2014was dedicated to the young English composer [[William Sterndale Bennett]], for whom Schumann had had a high regard when they worked together in Leipzig.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ''[[Davidsb\u00fcndlert\u00e4nze]]'', Op.&nbsp;6, (also published in 1837 despite the low opus number) literally \"Dances of the League of David\", is an embodiment of the struggle between enlightened Romanticism and musical philistinism. Schumann credited the two sides of his character with the composition of the work (the more passionate numbers are signed F. (Florestan) and the more dreamy signed E. (Eusebius)). The work begins with the \"motto of C.&nbsp;W.\" (Clara Wieck) denoting her support for the ideals of the ''Davidsbund''. The ''Bund'' was a music society of Schumann's imagination, members of which were kindred spirits (as he saw them) such as Chopin, Paganini and Clara, as well as the personalized Florestan and Eusebius.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''[[Kinderszenen]]'', Op. 15, completed in 1838 and a favourite of Schumann's piano works, depicts the innocence and playfulness of childhood. The \"Tr\u00e4umerei\" in F major, No. 7 of the set, is one of the most famous piano pieces ever written, and has been performed in myriad forms and transcriptions. It has been the favourite [[Encore (concert)|encore]] of several great pianists, including [[Vladimir Horowitz]]. Melodic and deceptively simple, the piece is \"complex\" in its harmonic structure.<ref>[[Alban Berg]], replying to charges that modern music was overly complex, pointed out that ''Kinderszenen'' is constructed on a complex base.</ref>\n\n{{listen\n| header   = [[Kreisleriana]], Op. 16 (1838)\n| filename    = Robert Schumann Kreisleriana Op. 16 N3 Giorgi Latsabidze.ogg\n| title       = N8.

[[Johannes Kreisler]] was a fictional musician created by poet [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], and characterized as a \"romantic brought into contact with reality.\" Schumann used the figure to express \"fantastic and mad\" emotional states. According to [[Ernest Hutcheson#Works|Hutcheson (\"The Literature of the Piano\")]], this work is \"among the finest efforts of Schumann's genius. He never surpassed the searching beauty of the slow movements (Nos. 2, 4, 6) or the urgent passion of others (Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7) [\u2026] To appreciate it a high level of aesthetic intelligence is required [\u2026] This is no facile music, there is severity alike in its beauty and its passion.\"\n\nThe ''[[Fantasie in C (Schumann)|Fantasie in C]]'', Op. 17, composed in the summer of 1836, is a work of passion and deep pathos, imbued with the spirit of the late Beethoven. Schumann intended to use proceeds from sales of the work toward the construction of [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|a monument to Beethoven]], who had died in 1827. The first movement of the ''Fantasie'' contains a [[Musical quotation|musical quote]] from Beethoven's song cycle, ''[[An die ferne Geliebte]]'', Op. 98 (at the Adagio coda, taken from the last song of the cycle). The original titles of the movements were ''Ruins'', ''Triumphal Arch'', and ''The Starry Crown''. According to [[Franz Liszt]],<ref>Strelezki: ''Personal Recollections of Chats with Liszt''</ref> who played the work for Schumann and to whom it was dedicated, the ''Fantasie'' was apt to be played too heavily, and should have a dreamier (''tr\u00e4umerisch'') character than vigorous German pianists tended to impart. Liszt also said: \"It is a noble work, worthy of Beethoven, whose career, by the way, it is supposed to represent\".<ref>Anton Strelezki: ''Personal Recollections of Chats with Liszt''. London, 1893.</ref> Again, according to Hutcheson: \"No words can describe the Phantasie, no quotations set forth the majesty of its genius. It must suffice to say that it is Schumann's greatest work in large form for piano solo.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n{{listen\n| header   = [[Arabeske (Schumann)|Arabeske in C major, Op. 18 (1839)]]\n| filename    = Schumann-arabeske-andrea-valori.ogg\n| title       = Arabeske (Schumann)\n| description = [[Mario Andrea Valori]], piano, 2011\n| format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nAfter a visit to [[Vienna]], during which he discovered [[Franz Schubert]]'s previously unknown [[Symphony No. 9 (Schubert)|Symphony No. 9 in C]], in 1839 Schumann wrote the ''[[Faschingsschwank aus Wien]]'' (''Carnival Prank from Vienna''). Most of the joke is in the central section of the first movement, which makes a thinly veiled reference to ''[[La Marseillaise]]''. (Vienna had banned the song due to harsh memories of [[Napoleon]]'s invasion.) The festive mood does not preclude moments of melancholic introspection in the Intermezzo.\n\n===1840\u201349===\nFrom 1832 to 1839, Schumann wrote almost exclusively for piano, but in 1840 alone he wrote at least 138 songs. Indeed, 1840 (the ''Liederjahr'' or ''year of song'') is highly significant in Schumann's musical legacy, despite his earlier deriding of works for piano and voice as inferior.\n\nAfter a long and acrimonious legal battle with her father, Schumann married Clara Wieck on 12 September 1840, at [[Leipzig-Sch\u00f6nefeld|Sch\u00f6nefeld]], the day before her 21st birthday. Had they waited another day, they would no longer have required her father's consent. Their marriage supported a remarkable business partnership, with Clara  acting as an inspiration, critic, and confidante to her husband. Despite her delicate appearance, she was an extremely strong-willed and energetic woman, who kept up a demanding schedule of concert tours in between bearing several children. Two years after their marriage, Friedrich Wieck at last reconciled himself with the couple, eager to see his grandchildren.\n\nPrior to the legal case and subsequent marriage, the lovers exchanged love letters and rendezvoused in secret. Robert often waited for hours in a cafe in a nearby city just to see Clara for a few minutes after one of her concerts. The strain of this long courtship and its consummation may have led to this great outpouring of Lieder (vocal songs with piano accompaniment). This is evident in ''Widmung'', for example, where he uses the melody from [[Franz Schubert|Schubert's]] [[Ave Maria (Schubert)|''Ave Maria'']] in the postlude in homage to Clara. Schumann's biographers attribute the sweetness, doubt, and despair of these songs to the emotions aroused by his love for Clara and the uncertainties of their future together.\n\nRobert and Clara had eight children, Emil (1846\u20131847), who died at 1 year; Marie (1841\u20131929); Elise (1843\u20131928); Julie (1845\u20131872); Ludwig (1848\u20131899); Ferdinand (1849\u20131891); [[Eugenie Schumann|Eugenie]] (1851\u20131938); and Felix (1854\u20131879).\n\n[[File:Robert and Clara Schumann.jpg|thumb|The stylized profiles of Clara and Robert Schumann]]\n\nHis chief song-cycles in this period were settings of the ''[[Liederkreis, Op. 39|Liederkreis]]'' of [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff|Joseph von Eichendorff]], Op. 39 (depicting a series of moods relating to or inspired by nature); the ''[[Frauenliebe und -leben]]'' of [[Adelbert von Chamisso|Chamisso]], Op. 42 (relating the tale of a woman's marriage, childbirth and widowhood); the ''[[Dichterliebe]]'' of [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], Op. 48 (depicting a lover rejected, but coming to terms with his painful loss through renunciation and forgiveness); and ''Myrthen'', a collection of songs, including poems by Goethe, [[Friedrich R\u00fcckert|R\u00fcckert]], Heine, Byron, [[Robert Burns|Burns]] and Moore. The songs ''Belsatzar'', Op. 57 and ''Die beiden Grenadiere'', Op. 49, both to Heine's words, show Schumann at his best as a ballad writer, although the dramatic ballad is less congenial to him than the introspective lyric. The Op. 35, 40 and 98a sets (words by [[Justinus Kerner]], Chamisso and Goethe respectively), although less well known, also contain songs of lyric and dramatic quality.\n\n{{listen\n | header       = Andante and Variations, Op. 46 (1843)<br />Performed by Neal and Nancy O'Doan (pianos), Carter Enyeart and Toby Saks (cellos) and Christopher Leuba (horn)\n | filename     = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Introduction, Theme and Variations 01-05.ogg\n | title        = Introduction, Theme and Variations 1\u20135\n | format       = [[ogg]]\n | description  =\n | filename2    = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Variations 06-10.ogg\n | title2       = Variations 6\u201310\n | format2      = [[ogg]]\n | description2 =\n | filename3    = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Variations 11-15.ogg\n | title3       = Variations 11\u201315\n | format3      = [[ogg]]\n | description3 =\n | image        = none\n}}\n\nIn 1841 he wrote two of his four symphonies, [[Symphony No. 1 (Schumann)|No. 1 in B-flat]], Op. 38, ''Spring'' and [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|No. 4 in D minor]] (the latter a pioneering work in \"cyclic form\", was performed that year but published only much later after revision and extensive re-orchestration as Op. 120). He devoted 1842 to composing chamber music, including the [[Piano Quintet (Schumann)|Piano Quintet in E-flat]], Op. 44, now one of his best known and most admired works; the [[Piano Quartet (Schumann)|Piano Quartet]] and [[String Quartets (Schumann)|three string quartets]]. In 1843 he wrote ''[[Paradise and the Peri]]'', his first attempt at concerted vocal music, an [[oratorio]] style work based on ''[[Lalla-Rookh]]'' by [[Thomas Moore]]. After this, his compositions were not confined to any one form during any particular period.\n\nThe stage in his life when he was deeply engaged in setting Goethe's ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' to music (1844\u201353) was a turbulent one for his health. He spent the first half of 1844 with Clara on tour in Russia, and his depression grew worse as he felt inferior to Clara as a musician. On returning to Germany, he abandoned his editorial work and left Leipzig for [[Dresden]], where he suffered from persistent \"[[nervous prostration]]\". As soon as he began to work, he was seized with fits of shivering and an apprehension of death, experiencing an abhorrence of high places, all metal instruments (even keys), and drugs. Schumann's diaries also state that he suffered perpetually from imagining that he had the [[A (musical note)#Designation by octave|note A5]] sounding in his ears.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHis state of unease and [[neurasthenia]] is reflected in his [[Symphony No. 2 (Schumann)|Symphony in C]], numbered second but third in order of composition, in which the composer explores states of exhaustion, obsession, and depression, culminating in Beethovenian spiritual triumph. Also published in 1845 was his [[Piano Concerto (Schumann)|Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 54]], originally conceived and performed as a one-movement ''Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra'' in 1841. It is one of the most popular and oft-recorded of all piano concertos; according to Hutcheson \"Schumann achieved a masterly work and we inherited the finest piano concerto since Mozart and Beethoven\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Robert u Clara Schumann 1847.jpg|thumb|left|Robert and Clara Schumann in 1847, lithograph with a personal dedication]]\n\nIn 1846, he felt he had recovered. In the winter, the Schumanns revisited Vienna, traveling to [[Prague]] and Berlin in the spring of 1847 and in the summer to Zwickau, where he was received with enthusiasm. This pleased him, since until that time he was famous in only Dresden and Leipzig.\n\nHis only opera, ''[[Genoveva]]'', Op. 81, premiered in Spring 1850.<ref>{{harvnb|Daverio|1997|p=334}}</ref> In it, Schumann attempted to abolish [[recitative]], which he regarded as an interruption to the musical flow (an influence on [[Richard Wagner]]; Schumann's consistently flowing melody can be seen as a forerunner to Wagner's ''Melos''). The subject of ''Genoveva''\u2014based on [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[Christian Friedrich Hebbel]]'s plays\u2014was not seen an ideal choice. The text is often considered to lack dramatic qualities; the work has not remained in the repertoire. As early as 1842 the possibilities of German opera had been keenly realized by Schumann, who wrote, \"Do you know my prayer as an artist, night and morning? It is called 'German Opera.' Here is a real field for enterprise ... something simple, profound, German\". And in his notebook of suggestions for the text of operas are found amongst others: ''[[Nibelung]]en'', ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' and ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]''.\n\nThe music to [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s ''[[Manfred]]'' was written in 1849, the overture of which is one of Schumann's most frequently performed orchestral works. The [[May Uprising in Dresden|insurrection of Dresden]] caused Schumann to move to [[Kreischa]], a little village a few miles outside the city. In August 1849, on the occasion of the centenary of Goethe's birth, completed scenes of Schumann's ''[[Scenes from Goethe's Faust]]'' were performed in Dresden, Leipzig and [[Weimar]]. Liszt gave him assistance and encouragement. The rest of the work was written later in 1849, and the overture (which Schumann described as \"one of the sturdiest of [his] creations\") in 1853.\n\n===After 1850===\n[[File:Schumann-photo1850.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Schumann in an 1850 [[daguerreotype]]]]\n\nFrom 1850 to 1854, Schumann composed in a wide variety of genres. Critics have disputed the quality of his work at this time; a widely held view has been that his music showed signs of mental breakdown and creative decay. More recently, critics have suggested that the changes in style may be explained by \"lucid experimentation\".<ref name=\":1\">{{harvnb|Daverio|Sams|2001|p=19}}</ref>\n\nIn 1850, Schumann succeeded [[Ferdinand Hiller]] as musical director at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], but he was a poor conductor and quickly aroused the opposition of the musicians. According to [[Harold C. Schonberg]], in his 1967 ''The Great Conductors'': \"The great composer was impossible on the platform ... There is something heartrending about poor Schumann's epochal inefficiency as a conductor.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/greatconductors0000unse |url-access=registration |author=[[Harold C. Schonberg]] |title=The Great Conductors |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1967 |page=[https://archive.org/details/greatconductors0000unse/page/126 126]}}</ref> His contract was eventually terminated. By the end of that year he completed his [[Symphony No. 3 (Schumann)|Symphony No. 3, \"Rhenish\"]] (a work containing five movements and whose 4th movement is apparently intended to represent an episcopal coronation ceremony). In 1851 he revised what would be published as his [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|fourth symphony]]. From 1851 to 1853 he visited Switzerland, Belgium and Leipzig.\n\nOn 30 September 1853, the 20-year-old composer [[Johannes Brahms]] arrived unannounced at the door of the Schumanns carrying a letter of introduction from violinist [[Joseph Joachim]]. (Schumann was not at home, and would not meet Brahms until the next day.) Brahms amazed Clara and Robert with his music, stayed with them for several weeks, and became a close family friend. (He later worked closely with Clara to popularize Schumann's compositions during her long widowhood.)\n\nDuring this time Schumann, Brahms and Schumann's pupil [[Albert Dietrich]] collaborated on the composition of the ''[[F-A-E Sonata|''F-A-E'' Sonata]]'' for Joachim; Schumann also published an article, \"Neue Bahnen\" (\"New Paths\") in the ''Neue Zeitschrift'' (his first article in many years), hailing the unknown young Brahms from Hamburg, a man who had published nothing, as \"the Chosen One\" who \"was destined to give ideal expression to the times.\"<ref>Robert Schumann's \"Artikel Neue Bahnen\", 28 October 1853</ref> It was an extraordinary way to present Brahms to the musical world, setting up great expectations that he did not fulfill for many years.<ref>Brahms' [[A German Requiem (Brahms)|''A German Requiem'']], published in 1868, brought the first widespread recognition of his talent.</ref> In January 1854, Schumann went to [[Hanover]], where he heard a performance of his ''Paradise and the Peri'' organized by Joachim and Brahms. Two years later at Schumann's request, the work received its first English performance conducted by [[William Sterndale Bennett]].\n[[File:Bonn graveyard robert schumann 20080509.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Robert and Clara Schumann at [[Bonn]]]]\n\nSchumann returned to D\u00fcsseldorf and began to edit his complete works and make an anthology on the subject of music. He suffered a renewal of the symptoms that had threatened him earlier. Besides the single note sounding in his ear (possibly evidence of [[tinnitus]],<ref name=\":0\" />) he imagined that voices sounded in his ear and he heard angelic music.<ref name=\":0\" /> One night he suddenly left his bed, having dreamt or imagined that a ghost (purportedly the spirit of either Schubert or Mendelssohn) had dictated a \"spirit theme\" to him. The theme was one he had used several times before: in his Second String Quartet, again in his ''Lieder-Album f\u00fcr die Jugend'', and finally in the slow movement of his [[Violin Concerto (Schumann)|Violin Concerto]]. In the days leading up to his suicide attempt, Schumann wrote five variations on this theme for the piano, his last completed work, today known as the ''[[Geistervariationen]]'' (Ghost Variations).<ref>{{cite web |first=Joseph |last=Stevenson |title=Robert Schumann: Variations on an original theme, for piano in E flat major (\"Geister-Variationen\"), WoO 24 |work=AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/composition/variations-on-an-original-theme-for-piano-in-e-flat-major-geister-variationen-woo-24-mc0002377594 |accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref> Brahms published it in a supplementary volume to the complete edition of Schumann's piano music. In 1861 Brahms published his ''Variations for Piano Four Hands'', Op. 23, based on this theme.\n\n[[File:Robertschumann.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Schumann monument at his birthplace [[Zwickau]], Germany]]\n\n===Final illness and death===\nIn late February 1854, Schumann's symptoms increased, the angelic visions sometimes being replaced by demonic ones. He warned Clara that he feared he might do her harm. On 27 February, he attempted suicide by throwing himself from a bridge into the [[Rhine]] River (his elder sister Emilie had committed suicide in 1825, possibly by drowning herself). Rescued by boatmen and taken home, he asked to be taken to an asylum for the insane. He entered Dr. Franz Richarz's [[sanatorium]] in [[Endenich]], a quarter of [[Bonn]], and remained there until he died on 29 July 1856 at the age of 46.

Another possibility is that his neurological problems were the result of an intracranial mass.

From mid-career on, she mainly performed music by leading composers. A hired cook and housekeeper tended to the children while she traveled. In 1856, she first visited England. The critics received Robert's music coolly, with [[Henry Fothergill Chorley]] being particularly harsh. She returned to London in 1865 and made regular appearances there in later years, often performing chamber music with the violinist [[Joseph Joachim]] and others. She became the authoritative editor of her husband's works for [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]]. It was rumoured that she and Brahms destroyed many of Schumann's later works, which they thought were tainted by his madness, but only the ''Five Pieces for Cello and Piano'' are known to have been destroyed. Most of Schumann's late works, particularly the [[Violin Concerto (Schumann)|Violin Concerto]], the ''Fantasy for Violin and Orchestra'' and the Violin Sonata No. 3, all from 1853, have entered the repertoire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Zwickau Robert Schumann Birth House.jpg|thumb|left|Birthplace of Robert Schumann in Zwickau in 2005]]\n[[File:GDR stamp Robert Schumann 1956-vertical.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[East Germany]] 1956 Schumann/Schubert error: Schubert's music is on the top stamp, and Schumann's on the bottom]]\n[[File:1960 CPA 2422.jpg|thumb|upright|1960 [[Russian Post#Soviet Union|Post of the USSR]] stamp marking the 150th anniversary of Schumann's birth.]]\n\nSchumann had considerable influence in the nineteenth century and beyond, despite his adoption of more conservative modes of composition after his marriage. He left an array of acclaimed music in virtually all the forms then known. Partly through his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Brahms, Schumann's ideals and musical vocabulary became widely disseminated. Composer Sir [[Edward Elgar]] called Schumann \"my ideal.\"\n\nSchumann has often been confused with Austrian composer [[Franz Schubert]]; one well-known example occurred in 1956, when [[East Germany]] issued a pair of postage stamps featuring Schumann's picture against an open score that featured Schubert's music.

({{IPA-de|\u02c8\u0283u\u02d0man|lang}}; 8 June 1810{{spaced ndash}}29 July 1856) was a German composer, pianist, and influential music critic. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] era. Schumann left the study of law, intending to pursue a career as a [[virtuoso]] pianist. His teacher, [[Friedrich Wieck]], a German pianist, had assured him that he could become the finest pianist in Europe, but a hand injury ended this dream. Schumann then focused his musical energies on composing.\n\nIn 1840, after a long and acrimonious legal battle with Wieck, who opposed the marriage, Schumann married Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]]. A lifelong partnership in music began, as Clara herself was an established pianist and music prodigy. Clara and Robert also maintained a close relationship with German composer [[Johannes Brahms]].\n\nUntil 1840, Schumann wrote exclusively for the piano. Later, he composed piano and orchestral works, and many [[Lied]]er (songs for voice and piano). He composed four [[Symphony|symphonies]], one [[opera]], and other orchestral, [[choral]], and [[chamber music|chamber]] works. His best-known works include ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', ''[[Kinderszenen]]'', ''[[Kreisleriana]]'', and the ''[[Fantasie in C (Schumann)|Fantasie in C]]''. Schumann was known for infusing his music with characters through motifs, as well as references to works of literature. These characters bled into his editorial writing in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik]]'' (New Journal for Music), a [[Leipzig]]-based publication that he co-founded.\n\nSchumann suffered from a [[mental disorder]] that first manifested in 1833 as a severe [[melancholic depression|melancholic depressive]] episode\u2014which recurred several times alternating with phases of \"exaltation\" and increasingly also delusional ideas of being poisoned or threatened with metallic items. What is now thought to have been a combination of [[bipolar disorder]] and perhaps [[mercury poisoning]] led to \"manic\" and \"depressive\" periods in Schumann's compositional productivity. After a suicide attempt in 1854, Schumann was admitted at his own request to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] in [[Endenich]] near [[Bonn]]. Diagnosed with ''psychotic [[melancholia]]'', he died of pneumonia two years later at the age of 46, without recovering from his mental illness.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Schumannhaus ALT.JPG|thumb|left|Schumann's birth house, now the [[Robert Schumann House]], after an anonymous colourized lithograph]]\n[[File:Rob.Schumann.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] of Robert Schumann in the museum of [[Zwickau]]]]\n\nSchumann was born in [[Zwickau]], in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] (today [[Central Germany (cultural area)|Central Germany]]), the fifth and last child of Johanna Christiane (n\u00e9e Schnabel) and August Schumann.<ref>{{harvnb|Ostwald|1985|p=11}}</ref> Schumann began to compose before the age of seven, but his boyhood was spent in the cultivation of literature as much as music\u2014undoubtedly influenced by his father, a bookseller, publisher, and novelist.<ref>{{harvnb|Schumann|1982}}</ref>\n\nAt age seven, Schumann began studying general music and piano with Johann Gottfried Kuntzsch, a teacher at the Zwickau high school. The boy immediately developed a love of music, and worked on his own compositions, without the aid of Kuntzsch. Even though he often disregarded the principles of musical composition, he created works regarded as admirable for his age. The ''Universal Journal of Music'' 1850 supplement included a biographical sketch of Schumann that noted, \"It has been related that Schumann, as a child, possessed rare taste and talent for portraying feelings and characteristic traits in melody,\u2014ay, he could sketch the different dispositions of his intimate friends by certain figures and passages on the piano so exactly and comically that everyone burst into loud laughter at the similitude of the portrait.\"<ref>[[Eric Himy]], pianist, Recording ''Homage to Schumann'', CD Notes, (Centaur, 2006), CEN 2858, chosen by BBC December 2007 as CD of the month, includes \"Kinderscenen\", \"Tr\u00e4umerei\"</ref>\n\nAt age 14, Schumann wrote an essay on the aesthetics of music and also contributed to a volume, edited by his father, titled ''Portraits of Famous Men''. While still at school in Zwickau, he read the works of the German poet-philosophers [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], as well as [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and the [[Tragedy#Ancient Greek tragedy|Greek tragedians]]. His most powerful and permanent literary inspiration was [[Jean Paul]], a German writer whose influence is seen in Schumann's youthful novels ''Juniusabende'', completed in 1826, and ''Selene''.\n\nSchumann's interest in music was sparked by attending a performance of [[Ignaz Moscheles]] playing at [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]], and he later developed an interest in the works of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]. His father, who had encouraged his musical aspirations, died in 1826 when Schumann was 16. Thereafter, neither his mother nor his guardian encouraged him to pursue a music career. In 1828, Schumann left high school, and after a trip during which he met the poet [[Heinrich Heine]] in Munich, he left to study law at the University of Leipzig under family pressure. But in Leipzig Schumann instead focused on improvisation, song composition, and writing novels. He also began to seriously study piano with Friedrick Wieck, a well-known piano teacher. In 1829, he continued his law studies in [[Heidelberg]], where he became a lifelong member of [[Corps Saxo-Borussia Heidelberg]].\n\n{{See also|German Student Corps|Corps}}\n\n===1830\u201334===\n[[File:Robert-Schumann-Haus.JPG|thumb|upright|Schumann's music room in Zwickau]]\n\nDuring [[Eastertide]] 1830, he heard the Italian violinist, violist, guitarist, and composer [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]] play in [[Frankfurt]]. In July he wrote to his mother, \"My whole life has been a struggle between Poetry and Prose, or call it Music and Law.\" With her permission, by Christmas he was back in Leipzig, at age 20 taking piano lessons from his old master [[Friedrich Wieck]], who assured him that he would be a successful concert pianist after a few years' study with him.<ref>{{harvnb|Perrey|2007|p=11}}</ref> During his studies with Wieck, some stories claim that Schumann permanently injured a finger on his right hand. Wieck claimed that Schumann damaged his finger by using a mechanical device that held back one finger while he exercised the others\u2014which was supposed to strengthen the weakest fingers.<ref name=\":0\">{{harvnb|Jensen|2001}}</ref> [[Clara Schumann]] discredited the story, saying the disability was not due to a mechanical device, and Robert Schumann himself referred to it as \"an affliction of the whole hand.\" Some argue that, as the disability appeared to have been chronic and have affected the hand, and not just a finger, it was not likely caused by a finger strengthening device.<ref>{{cite journal| jstor= 954772 | first= Eric| last= Sams | title= Schumann's hand injury| journal= The Musical Times| volume= 112| pages= 1156\u20131159| number= 1546 |date= December 1971| doi= 10.2307/954772}}</ref>\n\nSchumann abandoned the idea of a concert career and devoted himself instead to composition. To this end he began a study of music theory under [[Heinrich Dorn]], a German composer six years his senior and, at that time, conductor of the [[Leipzig Opera]].\n\n====''Papillons''====\nSchumann's fusion of literary ideas with musical ones\u2014known as [[program music]]\u2014may have first taken shape in ''[[Papillons]]'', Op. 2 (''Butterflies''), a musical portrayal of events in [[Jean Paul]]'s novel ''Die Flegeljahre''. In a letter from Leipzig dated April 1832, Schumann bids his brothers, \"Read the last scene in Jean Paul's ''Flegeljahre'' as soon as possible, because the ''Papillons'' are intended as a musical representation of that masquerade.\" This inspiration is foreshadowed to some extent in his first written criticism\u2014an 1831 essay on [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]'s [[Variations on \"L\u00e0 ci darem la mano\" (Chopin)|variations on a theme]] from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', published in the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]''. In it, Schumann\ncreates imaginary characters who discuss Chopin's work: Florestan (the embodiment of Schumann's passionate, voluble side) and Eusebius (his dreamy, introspective side)\u2014the counterparts of Vult and Walt in ''Flegeljahre.'' They call on a third, Meister Raro, for his opinion. Raro may represent either the composer himself, Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]], or the combination of the two (Cla'''ra''' + '''Ro'''bert).\n\nIn the winter of 1832, at age 22, Schumann visited relatives in Zwickau and [[Schneeberg, Saxony|Schneeberg]], where he performed the first movement of his ''Symphony in G minor'' (without opus number, known as the \"Zwickauer\"). In Zwickau, the music was performed at a concert given by Clara Wieck, who was then just 13 years old. On this occasion Clara played bravura Variations by [[Henri Herz]], a composer whom Schumann was already deriding as a philistine.<ref>Robert Schumann, musical Journal</ref> Schumann's mother said to Clara, \"You must marry my Robert one day.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Litzmann|1913}}</ref> The ''Symphony in G minor'' was not published during Schumann's lifetime but has been played and recorded in recent times.\n\nThe 1833 deaths of Schumann's brother Julius and his sister-in-law Rosalie in the [[Second cholera pandemic (1829-1851)|worldwide cholera pandemic]] brought on a [[Major depressive disorder|severe depressive]] episode.\n\n[[File:Robert Schumann in youth.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A youthful Robert Schumann]]\n\n====''Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik''====\nBy spring 1834, Schumann had sufficiently recovered to inaugurate ''[[Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik|Die Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik]]'' (\"New Journal for Music\"), first published on 3 April 1834. In his writings, Schumann created a fictional music society based on people in his life, called the ''[[Davidsb\u00fcndler]]'', named after the biblical King David who fought against the Philistines. Schumann published most of his critical writings in the journal, and often lambasted the popular taste for flashy technical displays from figures whom Schumann perceived as inferior composers, or \"philistines\". Schumann campaigned to revive interest in major composers of the past, including [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]. He also promoted the work of some contemporary composers, including [[Chopin]] (about whom Schumann famously wrote, \"Hats off, Gentlemen! A genius!\")<ref>[[Vladimir Ashkenazy]]'s notes, Favourite Chopin</ref> and [[Hector Berlioz]], whom he praised for creating music of substance. On the other hand, Schumann disparaged the school of [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner]]. Among Schumann's associates at this time were composers [[Norbert Burgm\u00fcller]] and [[Ludwig Schuncke]] (to whom Schumann dedicated his ''Toccata in C'').\n\nDuring the summer of 1834 Schumann became engaged to 16-year-old Ernestine von Fricken, the adopted daughter of a rich Bohemian-born noble. In August 1835, he learned that Ernestine von Fricken was born illegitimate, which meant that she would have no dowry. Fearful that her limited means would force him to earn his living like a \"day-labourer,\" Schumann made a complete break with her toward the end of the year. He felt a growing attraction to 15-year-old Clara Wieck. They made mutual declarations of love in December in Zwickau, where Clara appeared in concert. His budding romance with Clara was disrupted when her father learned of their trysts during the Christmas holidays. He summarily forbade them further meetings, and ordered all their correspondence burnt.\n\n====''Carnaval''====\n''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', Op. 9 (1834) is one of Schumann's most characteristic piano works. Schumann begins nearly every section of ''Carnaval'' with a [[musical cryptogram]], the musical notes signified in German by the letters that spell [[A\u0161|Asch]] (A, E-flat, C, and B, or alternatively A-flat, C, and B; in German these are A, Es, C and H, and As, C and H respectively), the [[Bohemia]]n town in which Ernestine was born, and the notes are also the musical letters in Schumann's own name. Eusebius and Florestan, the imaginary figures appearing so often in his critical writings, also appear, alongside brilliant imitations of Chopin and Paganini. To each of these characters he devotes a section of ''Carnaval''. The work comes to a close with a march of the ''Davidsb\u00fcndler''\u2014the league of [[King David]]'s men against the [[Philistines]]\u2014in which may be heard the clear accents of truth in contest with the dull clamour of falsehood embodied in a [[Musical quotation|quotation]] from the seventeenth century ''[[Grossvatertanz|Grandfather's Dance]]''. The march, a step nearly always in duple meter, is here in 3/4 time (triple meter). The work ends in joy and a degree of mock-triumph. In ''Carnaval'', Schumann went further than in ''Papillons'', by conceiving the story as well as the musical representation (and also displaying a maturation of compositional resource).\n\n===1835\u201339===\nOn 3 October 1835, Schumann met [[Felix Mendelssohn]] at Wieck's house in Leipzig, and his enthusiastic appreciation of that artist<ref>{{harvnb|Daverio|1997|p=134}}</ref> was shown with the same generous freedom that distinguished his acknowledgement of the greatness of Chopin and other colleagues, and later prompted him to publicly pronounce the then-unknown [[Johannes Brahms]] a genius.\n[[File:Andreas Staub - Clara Wieck (Lithographie 1839, cropped).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|[[Clara Wieck]] in an idealized lithograph by [[Andreas Staub]], c. 1839]]\n[[File:Friedrich Wieck um 1838.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Wieck]] in a sketch by [[Pauline Viardot-Garcia]], around 1838]]\n\nIn 1837 Schumann published his ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', a complex set of ''\u00e9tude''-like variations written in 1834\u20131835, which demanded a finished piano technique. These variations were based on a theme by the adoptive father of Ernestine von Fricken. The work\u2014described as \"one of the peaks of the piano literature, lofty in conception and faultless in workmanship\" [Hutcheson]\u2014was dedicated to the young English composer [[William Sterndale Bennett]], for whom Schumann had had a high regard when they worked together in Leipzig.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ''[[Davidsb\u00fcndlert\u00e4nze]]'', Op.&nbsp;6, (also published in 1837 despite the low opus number) literally \"Dances of the League of David\", is an embodiment of the struggle between enlightened Romanticism and musical philistinism. Schumann credited the two sides of his character with the composition of the work (the more passionate numbers are signed F. (Florestan) and the more dreamy signed E. (Eusebius)). The work begins with the \"motto of C.&nbsp;W.\" (Clara Wieck) denoting her support for the ideals of the ''Davidsbund''. The ''Bund'' was a music society of Schumann's imagination, members of which were kindred spirits (as he saw them) such as Chopin, Paganini and Clara, as well as the personalized Florestan and Eusebius.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''[[Kinderszenen]]'', Op. 15, completed in 1838 and a favourite of Schumann's piano works, depicts the innocence and playfulness of childhood. The \"Tr\u00e4umerei\" in F major, No. 7 of the set, is one of the most famous piano pieces ever written, and has been performed in myriad forms and transcriptions. It has been the favourite [[Encore (concert)|encore]] of several great pianists, including [[Vladimir Horowitz]]. Melodic and deceptively simple, the piece is \"complex\" in its harmonic structure.<ref>[[Alban Berg]], replying to charges that modern music was overly complex, pointed out that ''Kinderszenen'' is constructed on a complex base.</ref>\n\n{{listen\n| header   = [[Kreisleriana]], Op. 16 (1838)\n| filename    = Robert Schumann Kreisleriana Op. 16 N3 Giorgi Latsabidze.ogg\n| title       = N8.

[[Johannes Kreisler]] was a fictional musician created by poet [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], and characterized as a \"romantic brought into contact with reality.\" Schumann used the figure to express \"fantastic and mad\" emotional states. According to [[Ernest Hutcheson#Works|Hutcheson (\"The Literature of the Piano\")]], this work is \"among the finest efforts of Schumann's genius. He never surpassed the searching beauty of the slow movements (Nos. 2, 4, 6) or the urgent passion of others (Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7) [\u2026] To appreciate it a high level of aesthetic intelligence is required [\u2026] This is no facile music, there is severity alike in its beauty and its passion.\"\n\nThe ''[[Fantasie in C (Schumann)|Fantasie in C]]'', Op. 17, composed in the summer of 1836, is a work of passion and deep pathos, imbued with the spirit of the late Beethoven. Schumann intended to use proceeds from sales of the work toward the construction of [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|a monument to Beethoven]], who had died in 1827. The first movement of the ''Fantasie'' contains a [[Musical quotation|musical quote]] from Beethoven's song cycle, ''[[An die ferne Geliebte]]'', Op. 98 (at the Adagio coda, taken from the last song of the cycle). The original titles of the movements were ''Ruins'', ''Triumphal Arch'', and ''The Starry Crown''. According to [[Franz Liszt]],<ref>Strelezki: ''Personal Recollections of Chats with Liszt''</ref> who played the work for Schumann and to whom it was dedicated, the ''Fantasie'' was apt to be played too heavily, and should have a dreamier (''tr\u00e4umerisch'') character than vigorous German pianists tended to impart. Liszt also said: \"It is a noble work, worthy of Beethoven, whose career, by the way, it is supposed to represent\".<ref>Anton Strelezki: ''Personal Recollections of Chats with Liszt''. London, 1893.</ref> Again, according to Hutcheson: \"No words can describe the Phantasie, no quotations set forth the majesty of its genius. It must suffice to say that it is Schumann's greatest work in large form for piano solo.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n{{listen\n| header   = [[Arabeske (Schumann)|Arabeske in C major, Op. 18 (1839)]]\n| filename    = Schumann-arabeske-andrea-valori.ogg\n| title       = Arabeske (Schumann)\n| description = [[Mario Andrea Valori]], piano, 2011\n| format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nAfter a visit to [[Vienna]], during which he discovered [[Franz Schubert]]'s previously unknown [[Symphony No. 9 (Schubert)|Symphony No. 9 in C]], in 1839 Schumann wrote the ''[[Faschingsschwank aus Wien]]'' (''Carnival Prank from Vienna''). Most of the joke is in the central section of the first movement, which makes a thinly veiled reference to ''[[La Marseillaise]]''. (Vienna had banned the song due to harsh memories of [[Napoleon]]'s invasion.) The festive mood does not preclude moments of melancholic introspection in the Intermezzo.\n\n===1840\u201349===\nFrom 1832 to 1839, Schumann wrote almost exclusively for piano, but in 1840 alone he wrote at least 138 songs. Indeed, 1840 (the ''Liederjahr'' or ''year of song'') is highly significant in Schumann's musical legacy, despite his earlier deriding of works for piano and voice as inferior.\n\nAfter a long and acrimonious legal battle with her father, Schumann married Clara Wieck on 12 September 1840, at [[Leipzig-Sch\u00f6nefeld|Sch\u00f6nefeld]], the day before her 21st birthday. Had they waited another day, they would no longer have required her father's consent. Their marriage supported a remarkable business partnership, with Clara  acting as an inspiration, critic, and confidante to her husband. Despite her delicate appearance, she was an extremely strong-willed and energetic woman, who kept up a demanding schedule of concert tours in between bearing several children. Two years after their marriage, Friedrich Wieck at last reconciled himself with the couple, eager to see his grandchildren.\n\nPrior to the legal case and subsequent marriage, the lovers exchanged love letters and rendezvoused in secret. Robert often waited for hours in a cafe in a nearby city just to see Clara for a few minutes after one of her concerts. The strain of this long courtship and its consummation may have led to this great outpouring of Lieder (vocal songs with piano accompaniment). This is evident in ''Widmung'', for example, where he uses the melody from [[Franz Schubert|Schubert's]] [[Ave Maria (Schubert)|''Ave Maria'']] in the postlude in homage to Clara. Schumann's biographers attribute the sweetness, doubt, and despair of these songs to the emotions aroused by his love for Clara and the uncertainties of their future together.\n\nRobert and Clara had eight children, Emil (1846\u20131847), who died at 1 year; Marie (1841\u20131929); Elise (1843\u20131928); Julie (1845\u20131872); Ludwig (1848\u20131899); Ferdinand (1849\u20131891); [[Eugenie Schumann|Eugenie]] (1851\u20131938); and Felix (1854\u20131879).\n\n[[File:Robert and Clara Schumann.jpg|thumb|The stylized profiles of Clara and Robert Schumann]]\n\nHis chief song-cycles in this period were settings of the ''[[Liederkreis, Op. 39|Liederkreis]]'' of [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff|Joseph von Eichendorff]], Op. 39 (depicting a series of moods relating to or inspired by nature); the ''[[Frauenliebe und -leben]]'' of [[Adelbert von Chamisso|Chamisso]], Op. 42 (relating the tale of a woman's marriage, childbirth and widowhood); the ''[[Dichterliebe]]'' of [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], Op. 48 (depicting a lover rejected, but coming to terms with his painful loss through renunciation and forgiveness); and ''Myrthen'', a collection of songs, including poems by Goethe, [[Friedrich R\u00fcckert|R\u00fcckert]], Heine, Byron, [[Robert Burns|Burns]] and Moore. The songs ''Belsatzar'', Op. 57 and ''Die beiden Grenadiere'', Op. 49, both to Heine's words, show Schumann at his best as a ballad writer, although the dramatic ballad is less congenial to him than the introspective lyric. The Op. 35, 40 and 98a sets (words by [[Justinus Kerner]], Chamisso and Goethe respectively), although less well known, also contain songs of lyric and dramatic quality.\n\n{{listen\n | header       = Andante and Variations, Op. 46 (1843)<br />Performed by Neal and Nancy O'Doan (pianos), Carter Enyeart and Toby Saks (cellos) and Christopher Leuba (horn)\n | filename     = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Introduction, Theme and Variations 01-05.ogg\n | title        = Introduction, Theme and Variations 1\u20135\n | format       = [[ogg]]\n | description  =\n | filename2    = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Variations 06-10.ogg\n | title2       = Variations 6\u201310\n | format2      = [[ogg]]\n | description2 =\n | filename3    = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Variations 11-15.ogg\n | title3       = Variations 11\u201315\n | format3      = [[ogg]]\n | description3 =\n | image        = none\n}}\n\nIn 1841 he wrote two of his four symphonies, [[Symphony No. 1 (Schumann)|No. 1 in B-flat]], Op. 38, ''Spring'' and [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|No. 4 in D minor]] (the latter a pioneering work in \"cyclic form\", was performed that year but published only much later after revision and extensive re-orchestration as Op. 120). He devoted 1842 to composing chamber music, including the [[Piano Quintet (Schumann)|Piano Quintet in E-flat]], Op. 44, now one of his best known and most admired works; the [[Piano Quartet (Schumann)|Piano Quartet]] and [[String Quartets (Schumann)|three string quartets]]. In 1843 he wrote ''[[Paradise and the Peri]]'', his first attempt at concerted vocal music, an [[oratorio]] style work based on ''[[Lalla-Rookh]]'' by [[Thomas Moore]]. After this, his compositions were not confined to any one form during any particular period.\n\nThe stage in his life when he was deeply engaged in setting Goethe's ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' to music (1844\u201353) was a turbulent one for his health. He spent the first half of 1844 with Clara on tour in Russia, and his depression grew worse as he felt inferior to Clara as a musician. On returning to Germany, he abandoned his editorial work and left Leipzig for [[Dresden]], where he suffered from persistent \"[[nervous prostration]]\". As soon as he began to work, he was seized with fits of shivering and an apprehension of death, experiencing an abhorrence of high places, all metal instruments (even keys), and drugs. Schumann's diaries also state that he suffered perpetually from imagining that he had the [[A (musical note)#Designation by octave|note A5]] sounding in his ears.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHis state of unease and [[neurasthenia]] is reflected in his [[Symphony No. 2 (Schumann)|Symphony in C]], numbered second but third in order of composition, in which the composer explores states of exhaustion, obsession, and depression, culminating in Beethovenian spiritual triumph. Also published in 1845 was his [[Piano Concerto (Schumann)|Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 54]], originally conceived and performed as a one-movement ''Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra'' in 1841. It is one of the most popular and oft-recorded of all piano concertos; according to Hutcheson \"Schumann achieved a masterly work and we inherited the finest piano concerto since Mozart and Beethoven\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Robert u Clara Schumann 1847.jpg|thumb|left|Robert and Clara Schumann in 1847, lithograph with a personal dedication]]\n\nIn 1846, he felt he had recovered. In the winter, the Schumanns revisited Vienna, traveling to [[Prague]] and Berlin in the spring of 1847 and in the summer to Zwickau, where he was received with enthusiasm. This pleased him, since until that time he was famous in only Dresden and Leipzig.\n\nHis only opera, ''[[Genoveva]]'', Op. 81, premiered in Spring 1850.<ref>{{harvnb|Daverio|1997|p=334}}</ref> In it, Schumann attempted to abolish [[recitative]], which he regarded as an interruption to the musical flow (an influence on [[Richard Wagner]]; Schumann's consistently flowing melody can be seen as a forerunner to Wagner's ''Melos''). The subject of ''Genoveva''\u2014based on [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[Christian Friedrich Hebbel]]'s plays\u2014was not seen an ideal choice. The text is often considered to lack dramatic qualities; the work has not remained in the repertoire. As early as 1842 the possibilities of German opera had been keenly realized by Schumann, who wrote, \"Do you know my prayer as an artist, night and morning? It is called 'German Opera.' Here is a real field for enterprise ... something simple, profound, German\". And in his notebook of suggestions for the text of operas are found amongst others: ''[[Nibelung]]en'', ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' and ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]''.\n\nThe music to [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s ''[[Manfred]]'' was written in 1849, the overture of which is one of Schumann's most frequently performed orchestral works. The [[May Uprising in Dresden|insurrection of Dresden]] caused Schumann to move to [[Kreischa]], a little village a few miles outside the city. In August 1849, on the occasion of the centenary of Goethe's birth, completed scenes of Schumann's ''[[Scenes from Goethe's Faust]]'' were performed in Dresden, Leipzig and [[Weimar]]. Liszt gave him assistance and encouragement. The rest of the work was written later in 1849, and the overture (which Schumann described as \"one of the sturdiest of [his] creations\") in 1853.\n\n===After 1850===\n[[File:Schumann-photo1850.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Schumann in an 1850 [[daguerreotype]]]]\n\nFrom 1850 to 1854, Schumann composed in a wide variety of genres. Critics have disputed the quality of his work at this time; a widely held view has been that his music showed signs of mental breakdown and creative decay. More recently, critics have suggested that the changes in style may be explained by \"lucid experimentation\".<ref name=\":1\">{{harvnb|Daverio|Sams|2001|p=19}}</ref>\n\nIn 1850, Schumann succeeded [[Ferdinand Hiller]] as musical director at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], but he was a poor conductor and quickly aroused the opposition of the musicians. According to [[Harold C. Schonberg]], in his 1967 ''The Great Conductors'': \"The great composer was impossible on the platform ... There is something heartrending about poor Schumann's epochal inefficiency as a conductor.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/greatconductors0000unse |url-access=registration |author=[[Harold C. Schonberg]] |title=The Great Conductors |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1967 |page=[https://archive.org/details/greatconductors0000unse/page/126 126]}}</ref> His contract was eventually terminated. By the end of that year he completed his [[Symphony No. 3 (Schumann)|Symphony No. 3, \"Rhenish\"]] (a work containing five movements and whose 4th movement is apparently intended to represent an episcopal coronation ceremony). In 1851 he revised what would be published as his [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|fourth symphony]]. From 1851 to 1853 he visited Switzerland, Belgium and Leipzig.\n\nOn 30 September 1853, the 20-year-old composer [[Johannes Brahms]] arrived unannounced at the door of the Schumanns carrying a letter of introduction from violinist [[Joseph Joachim]]. (Schumann was not at home, and would not meet Brahms until the next day.) Brahms amazed Clara and Robert with his music, stayed with them for several weeks, and became a close family friend. (He later worked closely with Clara to popularize Schumann's compositions during her long widowhood.)\n\nDuring this time Schumann, Brahms and Schumann's pupil [[Albert Dietrich]] collaborated on the composition of the ''[[F-A-E Sonata|''F-A-E'' Sonata]]'' for Joachim; Schumann also published an article, \"Neue Bahnen\" (\"New Paths\") in the ''Neue Zeitschrift'' (his first article in many years), hailing the unknown young Brahms from Hamburg, a man who had published nothing, as \"the Chosen One\" who \"was destined to give ideal expression to the times.\"<ref>Robert Schumann's \"Artikel Neue Bahnen\", 28 October 1853</ref> It was an extraordinary way to present Brahms to the musical world, setting up great expectations that he did not fulfill for many years.<ref>Brahms' [[A German Requiem (Brahms)|''A German Requiem'']], published in 1868, brought the first widespread recognition of his talent.</ref> In January 1854, Schumann went to [[Hanover]], where he heard a performance of his ''Paradise and the Peri'' organized by Joachim and Brahms. Two years later at Schumann's request, the work received its first English performance conducted by [[William Sterndale Bennett]].\n[[File:Bonn graveyard robert schumann 20080509.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Robert and Clara Schumann at [[Bonn]]]]\n\nSchumann returned to D\u00fcsseldorf and began to edit his complete works and make an anthology on the subject of music. He suffered a renewal of the symptoms that had threatened him earlier. Besides the single note sounding in his ear (possibly evidence of [[tinnitus]],<ref name=\":0\" />) he imagined that voices sounded in his ear and he heard angelic music.<ref name=\":0\" /> One night he suddenly left his bed, having dreamt or imagined that a ghost (purportedly the spirit of either Schubert or Mendelssohn) had dictated a \"spirit theme\" to him. The theme was one he had used several times before: in his Second String Quartet, again in his ''Lieder-Album f\u00fcr die Jugend'', and finally in the slow movement of his [[Violin Concerto (Schumann)|Violin Concerto]]. In the days leading up to his suicide attempt, Schumann wrote five variations on this theme for the piano, his last completed work, today known as the ''[[Geistervariationen]]'' (Ghost Variations).<ref>{{cite web |first=Joseph |last=Stevenson |title=Robert Schumann: Variations on an original theme, for piano in E flat major (\"Geister-Variationen\"), WoO 24 |work=AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/composition/variations-on-an-original-theme-for-piano-in-e-flat-major-geister-variationen-woo-24-mc0002377594 |accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref> Brahms published it in a supplementary volume to the complete edition of Schumann's piano music. In 1861 Brahms published his ''Variations for Piano Four Hands'', Op. 23, based on this theme.\n\n[[File:Robertschumann.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Schumann monument at his birthplace [[Zwickau]], Germany]]\n\n===Final illness and death===\nIn late February 1854, Schumann's symptoms increased, the angelic visions sometimes being replaced by demonic ones. He warned Clara that he feared he might do her harm. On 27 February, he attempted suicide by throwing himself from a bridge into the [[Rhine]] River (his elder sister Emilie had committed suicide in 1825, possibly by drowning herself). Rescued by boatmen and taken home, he asked to be taken to an asylum for the insane. He entered Dr. Franz Richarz's [[sanatorium]] in [[Endenich]], a quarter of [[Bonn]], and remained there until he died on 29 July 1856 at the age of 46. During his confinement, he was not allowed to see Clara, although Brahms was free to visit him. Clara finally visited him two days before his death. He appeared to recognize her, but was able to speak only a few words.<ref>{{harvnb|Daverio|Sams|2001|p=20}}</ref>\n\nGiven his reported symptoms, one modern view is that he died from [[syphilis]], which he could have contracted during his student days, and which could have remained latent during most of his marriage.<ref>Reich, Nancy B., ''Clara Schumann: The Artist and the Woman,'' Cornell University Press, 1985, p. 151.</ref> According to studies by the musicologist and literary scholar [[Eric Sams]], Schumann's symptoms during his terminal illness and death appear consistent with those of [[mercury poisoning]]; mercury was a common treatment for syphilis and other conditions. Another possibility is that his neurological problems were the result of an intracranial mass. A report by Janisch and Nauhaus on Schumann's autopsy indicates that he had a \"gelatinous\" tumor at the base of the brain; it may have represented a [[colloid cyst]], a [[craniopharyngioma]], a [[chordoma]], or a chordoid [[meningioma]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = J\u00e4nisch | first1 = W | last2 = Nauhaus | first2 = G | year = 1986 | title = Autopsy report of the corpse of the composer Robert Schumann: publication and interpretation of a rediscovered document | url = | journal = Zentralbl Allg Pathol | volume = 132 | issue = 2| pages = 129\u201336 | pmid = 3538703 }}</ref> In particular, meningiomas are known to produce musical auditory hallucinations such as Schumann reported.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Scott | first1 = M | year = 1979 | title = Musical hallucinations from meningioma | url = | journal = [[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] | volume = 241 | issue = 16| page = 1683 | pmid = 430721 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1979.03290420011006 }}</ref> It has also been hypothesised that he suffered from [[schizophrenia]], or [[schizoaffective disorder]]; bipolar type,<ref>Yasmeen Cooper and Mark Agius, [http://www.psychiatria-danubina.com/UserDocsImages/pdf/dnb_vol30_noSuppl%207/dnb_vol30_noSuppl%207_559.pdf \"Does Schizoaffective Disorder Explain the Mental Illness of Robert Schumann and Vincent Van Gogh?\"], Psychiatria Danubina, 2018; Vol. 30, Suppl. 7, pp 559-562</ref> or [[bipolar disorder]] and [[bipolar II disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/196/4/325 |title=Robert Schumann's contribution to the genetics of psychosis |first=Katharina |last=Domschke |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=196 |issue=4 |page=325 |date=March 2010 |accessdate=17 June 2015|doi=10.1192/bjp.196.4.325 |pmid=20357311 }}</ref>\n\nSchumann heard a persistent A-note at the end of his life.

From mid-career on, she mainly performed music by leading composers. A hired cook and housekeeper tended to the children while she traveled. In 1856, she first visited England. The critics received Robert's music coolly, with [[Henry Fothergill Chorley]] being particularly harsh. She returned to London in 1865 and made regular appearances there in later years, often performing chamber music with the violinist [[Joseph Joachim]] and others. She became the authoritative editor of her husband's works for [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]]. It was rumoured that she and Brahms destroyed many of Schumann's later works, which they thought were tainted by his madness, but only the ''Five Pieces for Cello and Piano'' are known to have been destroyed. Most of Schumann's late works, particularly the [[Violin Concerto (Schumann)|Violin Concerto]], the ''Fantasy for Violin and Orchestra'' and the Violin Sonata No. 3, all from 1853, have entered the repertoire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Zwickau Robert Schumann Birth House.jpg|thumb|left|Birthplace of Robert Schumann in Zwickau in 2005]]\n[[File:GDR stamp Robert Schumann 1956-vertical.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[East Germany]] 1956 Schumann/Schubert error: Schubert's music is on the top stamp, and Schumann's on the bottom]]\n[[File:1960 CPA 2422.jpg|thumb|upright|1960 [[Russian Post#Soviet Union|Post of the USSR]] stamp marking the 150th anniversary of Schumann's birth.]]\n\nSchumann had considerable influence in the nineteenth century and beyond, despite his adoption of more conservative modes of composition after his marriage. He left an array of acclaimed music in virtually all the forms then known. Partly through his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Brahms, Schumann's ideals and musical vocabulary became widely disseminated. Composer Sir [[Edward Elgar]] called Schumann \"my ideal.\"\n\nSchumann has often been confused with Austrian composer [[Franz Schubert]]; one well-known example occurred in 1956, when [[East Germany]] issued a pair of postage stamps featuring Schumann's picture against an open score that featured Schubert's music. The stamps were soon replaced by a pair featuring music written by Schumann.\n{{Clear left}}\n\n==Compositions==\n* [[List of compositions by Robert Schumann]]\n* [[:Category:Compositions by Robert Schumann]]\n\n==Media portrayals==\n* ''[[Dreaming (1944 German film)|Dreaming]]'' (1944) is a [[Universum Film AG|UFA]] movie starring [[Mathias Wieman]] as Schumann, [[Hilde Krahl]] as Clara Wieck, [[Ullrich Haupt (Jr.)|Ullrich Haupt]] as [[Johannes Brahms]], and [[Emil Lohkamp]] as [[Franz Liszt]].\n* ''[[Song of Love (1947 film)|Song of Love]]'' (1947) is an [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] film starring [[Paul Henreid]] as Schumann, [[Katharine Hepburn]] as Clara Wieck, [[Robert Walker (actor, born 1918)|Robert Walker]] as [[Johannes Brahms]], and [[Henry Daniell]] as [[Franz Liszt]].<ref>{{AFI film|25359|Song of Love}}</ref>\n* Peter Schamoni's 1983 movie ''Fr\u00fchlingssinfonie'' (''Spring Symphony'') tells the story of Schumann and Wieck's romance, against her father's opposition.
