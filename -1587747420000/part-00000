The term \"belt\" is sometimes mistakenly described as the use of chest voice in the higher part of the [[voice]]. The chest voice is a general term for the sound and muscular functions of the speaking voice, singing in the lower range, and the voice used to shout.  Each of those functions requires a thicker closure of the vocal folds and the support of the muscles surrounding them. The term \"chest voice\" is therefore a misunderstanding when it describes muscular work in the chest-area of the body, or a resonance therein.  Proper production of the belt voice, according to some vocal methods, involves minimizing tension in the throat and a change of typical placement of the voice sound in the [[mouth]], bringing it forward into the hard [[palate]], although techniques vary by pedagogical style.\n\nIt is possible to learn classical vocal methods like ''[[bel canto]]'' and also to be able to belt; in fact, many roles now require it.  Vocalists trained in a wide berth of styles describe vastly varying experiences in learning belt technique.  Some claim that it comes naturally, while others struggle to access chest register other than while speaking.  Style of music does not seem to be a related factor, other than in a singer's exposure to material.\n\nBelt technique requires muscle coordination not readily used in classically trained singers as the thyroarytenoid muscle is dominant (as opposed to head register singing where the [[Cricothyroid_muscle | ''cricothyroid muscle'']] is dominant), which may be why some opera singers find learning to belt challenging.\n\n==Physiology==\nThere are many explanations as to how the belting voice quality is produced. Under a scope, the vocal folds visibly shorten and thicken, and they undulate along more of their vertical surface area than in head register when a smaller segment of their edge must undulate to produce sound.\n\nOne researcher, [[Jo Estill]], has conducted research on the belting voice,<ref name=\"Estill1988\">[[Jo Estill|Estill J]] (1988).

With the out set of colonial rule in the [[Indian Ocean]], Sri Lanka was occupied by several major colonial empires that from time-to-time became the dominant power in the Indian Ocean. The colonists built several western styled forts, mostly in and round the cost of the island. The first to build colonial forts in Sri Lanka were the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], these forts were captured and later expanded by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]. The [[United Kingdom|British]] occupied these  Dutch forts during the [[Napoleonic wars]].\n\nMost of colonial forts were garrisoned up until the early 20th century. The coastal forts had [[coastal artillery]] manned by the [[Ceylon Garrison Artillery]] during the two world wars. Most of these were abandoned by the military, but retained civil administrative officers, while others retained military garrisons, which were more administrative than operational. Some were reoccupied by military units with the escalation of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], Jaffna fort for example came under siege several times.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Ancient forts ==\n{| style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

With the out set of colonial rule in the [[Indian Ocean]], Sri Lanka was occupied by several major colonial empires that from time-to-time became the dominant power in the Indian Ocean. The colonists built several western styled forts, mostly in and round the cost of the island. The first to build colonial forts in Sri Lanka were the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], these forts were captured and later expanded by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]. The [[United Kingdom|British]] occupied these  Dutch forts during the [[Napoleonic wars]].\n\nMost of colonial forts were garrisoned up until the early 20th century. The coastal forts had [[coastal artillery]] manned by the [[Ceylon Garrison Artillery]] during the two world wars. Most of these were abandoned by the military, but retained civil administrative officers, while others retained military garrisons, which were more administrative than operational. Some were reoccupied by military units with the escalation of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], Jaffna fort for example came under siege several times.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Ancient forts ==\n{| style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
