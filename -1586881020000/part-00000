He is the [[protagonist]] of the [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime]] and certain [[Pok\u00e9mon (manga)|manga]] series as well as on various merchandise related to the franchise. In Japanese, the character is voiced by [[Rica Matsumoto]]. In the English dub, he was voiced by [[Veronica Taylor]] in the first eight seasons and has been voiced by [[Sarah Natochenny]] since season 9.\n\nHis English name is derived from the Japanese name (as the letters 'ash' are included in 'S'''a'''to'''sh'''i') and his English motto, \"Gotta Catch 'Em All\". Ash's dream is to become a [[Pok\u00e9mon Master]]. He is loosely based on [[Red (Pok\u00e9mon)|Red]], the player character from the Generation I games  ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|Pok\u00e9mon Red, Green, Blue]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Yellow|Yellow]]'' as well as the Generation III games [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pok\u00e9mon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']] versions. The character's first official appearance in a game was in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle League]]''. [[Satoshi Tajiri]], the creator of Pok\u00e9mon, with whom Ash shares his Japanese name, has stated that Ash represents the 'human aspect' of the series, and that Ash reflects what he himself was like as a kid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501090040/http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview2.html|title=TIMEasia.com {{!}} Pok\u00e9mon: The Ultimate Game Freak - Page 2 {{!}} 11/22/99|date=2010-05-01|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\nAs the protagonist of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime, Ash has appeared in all episodes of the anime, all the films and several of the television specials.\n\nDue to the huge popularity, success, and longevity of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime series around the world since its debut,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215035736/http://www.chanpon.org/archive/manionthesis.pdf|title=Discovering Japan: Anime and Learning Japanese Culture|last=Manion|first=Annie|date=2017-12-15|website=web.archive.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref> Ash has gone on to become one of the most well-known and recognizable fictional characters of all-time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wegotthiscovered.com/tv/pokmon-anime-rid-ash-ketchum/|title=Is The Pok\u00e9mon Anime Getting Rid Of Ash Ketchum?|last=Pring|first=Joe|date=2019-09-02|website=We Got This Covered|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://poly.rpi.edu/features/2019/02/veronica-taylor-shares-life-experiences-with-fans/|website=poly.rpi.edu|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> due to his status as the protagonist of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gamerant.com/why-is-ash-ketchum-trending/|title=Why Is Ash Ketchum Trending?|date=2019-09-16|website=Game Rant|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref> However, he is often overshadowed in series representation by the franchise mascot, [[Pikachu]].

Ash received a redesign in the ''Best Wishes!'' series, which included larger brown irises. In the ''XY'' series, he received minor changes, such as a decrease in the size of the 'birthmarks' on his cheeks. Ash received a major design overhaul for the ''Sun'' and ''Moon'' anime series, which started airing in Japan on November 17, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2016/09/19/ash-looks-very-different-in-the-new-pokemon-sun-and-moon-anime/#6b9abdeb317b|title=Ash Looks Very Different In The New 'Pok\u00e9mon Sun And Moon' Anime|last=Barder|first=Ollie|access-date=2016-09-20}}</ref>\n\n===Voice Actors===\nIn Japan throughout the anime media, [[Rica Matsumoto]] has always provided the original Japanese voice of Ash. For the English dubbing, [[Veronica Taylor]] provided the voice of Ash in the first eight seasons of the English adaption of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime, which was dubbed by [[4Kids Entertainment]]. At the time of her audition, Taylor stated that the character was temporarily named Casey, which was the name later given to a recurring character in Johto. After the script was translated from Japanese, the lines were adapted to fit the movements of the character's mouth (called ''lip flap''). All the voices were recorded separately, so Taylor was the only one in the booth when she recorded her lines, which took approximately six to eight hours per episode. Taylor was often the first person to record, so she had to \"imagine how the previous line will be said\". \"Luckily, I work with a great director who helps with the interpretation of the line, matching of the lip flap, and consistency of the voice\". Taylor enjoyed playing Ash because of his \"low, husky voice\" and \"energy and excitement\".<ref name=\"Animerica\">{{cite journal|date=August 2000 |title=Veronica Taylor interview |work=[[Animerica]] |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |volume=8 |issue=6 |url=http://www.veronicataylor.net/faqs.html |accessdate=December 10, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124054857/http://www.veronicataylor.net/faqs.html |archivedate=November 24, 2009 |url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nTaylor commented that Ash and the other characters \"loosened up\" after the first ten episodes of the anime; she believed the writers were more relaxed and no longer felt the pressure of making sure everything was done correctly. Taylor commented: \"I enjoy playing Ash now much more than I did in the very beginning because I can have fun with him more, and we kind of know him and can work out how he really would react.

However, during the trip in the woods, it started to rain, and Ash got lost and was so scare to the point of bursting into tears. Ash was forced to take shelter under a hollow tree. However, he noticed a group of Pok\u00e9mon who were also seeking shelter from the rain. So, he invited them inside the tree and the Pok\u00e9mon kept him safe and warm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/19_28-seeing-the-forest-for-the-trees/|title=Seeing the Forest for the Trees! - Watch Pok\u00e9mon TV|author=|date=|website=www.pokemon.com}}</ref> This experience is what inspired Ash into becoming a Pok\u00e9mon trainer.\n\nIn the first episode of the twenty-third season ([[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Sword and Shield]]), Ash at the age of six asked his mother if he can go to Professor Oak's Pok\u00e9mon Summer Camp which she happily signed him up. However, Ash missed the camp due to breaking his alarm clock and overslept.\n\nIn episode 7 of the seventeenth season ([[Pok\u00e9mon the Series: XY|XY series]]), 'Giving Chase at the Rhyhorn Race!,'&nbsp; Ash attend another one Professor Oak's Pok\u00e9mon Summer Camp, where he had previously met childhood friend [[Serena (Pok\u00e9mon)|Serena]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-episodes/17_07-giving-chase-at-the-rhyhorn-race/|title=Giving Chase at the Rhyhorn Race! {{!}} Watch Pok\u00e9mon TV|website=www.pokemon.com|access-date=2017-03-19}}</ref> At one point during the camp, Serena had hurt her knee from falling over after being startled by a [[Poliwag]]. Ash had used his handkerchief to wrap up her injury, which she had kept, and returns to Ash in this episode.\n\nIn episode 58 of the fifth season ([[Pok\u00e9mon: Master Quest|Master Quest]]), 'The Ties That Bind!,' Ash started his rivalry with Gary, Professor Oak grandson, after they both fished out an old Pok\u00e9Ball then broke it in half. After that, Ash and Gary kept both half as a reminder of the day they started their rivalry.\n\n===In the anime===\nThe series starts with the episode '[[Pok\u00e9mon, I Choose You!]]', with Ash's tenth birthday, which according to Pok\u00e9mon trainer registration bylaws allowed him to become a full-fledged Pok\u00e9mon trainer and obtain a starter Pok\u00e9mon. As a ten-year-old hailing from Pallet Town in the Kanto region, Ash was offered a choice between three Pok\u00e9mon as his starter: Bulbasaur, Squirtle and Charmander. While he was planning to choose Squirtle, he received the electric type Pok\u00e9mon [[Pikachu]] from [[Professor Oak]] instead in this episode, because he woke up late and all the other starter Pok\u00e9mon had been taken by other trainers. After receiving Pikachu and a Pok\u00e9dex, Ash left Pallet Town to start his journey.<!-- episode 1 --> Since then Ash has traveled the world of Pok\u00e9mon, competed in many challenges and caught newer Pok\u00e9mon. He has met many companions, such as [[Misty (Pok\u00e9mon)|Misty]] and [[Brock (Pok\u00e9mon)|Brock]].\n\nThroughout the series, Ash's primary enemies are a criminal organization called [[Team Rocket (anime)|Team Rocket]], specifically the two comical and bumbling members, Jessie and James, and their talking [[Meowth]], who is essentially the third member of the group. Ever since being defeated by Ash's [[Pikachu]] in the second episode, \"Pok\u00e9mon Emergency!\", the three of them have obsessively never stopped chasing after them to steal Ash's Pikachu, maintaining the delusion that Pikachu is abnormally powerful and presenting it to their criminal boss would make them very rich. As the enduring comical villains of the series, the Team Rocket trio occasionally show signs of goodness, such as care and friendship with their Pok\u00e9mon and each other, and despite their constant [[antagonist|antagonism]], they occasionally put their differences aside and work together with Ash against a common threat, such as in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: The Movie 2000]]'', where they aid Ash in retrieving the three treasures in order to save the world.\n\nDuring his travels, Ash still had a lot to learn as a trainer. He caught his Pok\u00e9mon by merely befriending them, knew absolutely nothing about battling, and many of his gym badges were earned rather controversially. In fact, the only legitimate victories were over Lt. Surge, Koga, and Blaine, while the others were earned on technical convenience or given to him out of gratitude. Ash also shows a deep love for Pok\u00e9mon in the series, protecting wild Pok\u00e9mon or his own from getting injured or trying to help them, despite getting significantly hurt himself. He honed his skill as a Pok\u00e9mon trainer and was able to get all 8 badges, enabling him to compete in the Indigo League. Ash was able to go to the 5th round, and achieve the Top 16 \u2014 one round further than his competitive rival Gary, who finished in the Top 32. However, due to his inexperience in handling his more powerful Pok\u00e9mon, Ash was eliminated from his first Pok\u00e9mon League competition in a very unflattering manner, which greatly disappointed him but he got over it and vowed to not make the same mistake in a league again.\n\nAsh traveled to the Orange Islands with [[Misty (Pok\u00e9mon)|Misty]] and [[List of characters in the Pok\u00e9mon anime series|Tracey Sketchit]], a Pok\u00e9mon watcher, obtained all 4 badges and competed in the Orange League to battle Drake, the Orange League Champion. Ash was able to win his battle against Drake, giving him his first League Championship as a Pok\u00e9mon trainer. This particular Pok\u00e9mon League exists only in the anime series, and not adapted from the video game series.\n\nHe then traveled on to the Johto region with Brock and Misty, hoping to meet with Gary and finally defeat him in the Johto League. He won 8 badges and competed in the Johto Conference. Ash beat Gary again, in the 1st round of the conference, and was able to make it to the quarter-finals, and achieve Top 8. However, he lost against his new rival Harrison in the 2nd round. Ash then moved on and traveled through the Hoenn region, along with Brock and two new characters: May, an aspiring Pok\u00e9mon coordinator, and her younger brother Max, and together they ended up bringing down the rival teams [[Team Magma]] and [[Team Aqua]]. He was able to get all 8 badges and then competed in the Hoenn Conference. Ash was able to defeat his 1st new rival Morrison, in the 2nd round, also entering in the quarter-finals, and achieving Top 8 again. However, he lost in the 3rd round against his 2nd new rival Tyson.\n\nHaving gone through several leagues and gotten a lot stronger, Ash decided to challenge the Kanto \"Battle Frontier\" and its 7 Brains (leaders). Ash defeated all of the Brains and acquired all the 7 Battle Frontier symbols, becoming a \"Strong Battle Frontier champion\" and qualifying for becoming a Frontier Brain himself. However, Ash, wanting to learn more about Pok\u00e9mon and get even stronger, decided to continue his journey, not as a Frontier Brain, but as a trainer. However, having acquired all 7 symbols, he left with the privilege of becoming a Frontier Brain if and when he wants in the future.\n\nAsh, along with Brock, traveled to Sinnoh, befriended a new traveling companion, [[Dawn (Pok\u00e9mon)|Dawn]], and also found a brutal new rival in [[Paul (Pok\u00e9mon)|Paul]]; and through their journey they encountered and defeated [[Team Galactic]]. Ash won all 8 Sinnoh gym badges and competed in the Sinnoh conference at the Lily of the Valley Island. He eventually faced Paul in the quarter-finals of the Sinnoh League Festival and finally defeated him, marking the first time Ash has ever made it into the semi-finals in a Pok\u00e9mon League. Afterwards, however, Ash was matched against Tobias, a trainer who famously swept all eight Sinnoh League gyms and all other opponents with only his legendary Pok\u00e9mon [[Darkrai]]. Ash was eventually defeated by Tobias, but not without having defeated his Darkrai, as well as his [[Latios]], which is also a legendary Pok\u00e9mon, whom Ash also defeated in a draw with his final Pok\u00e9mon, making Ash the only known trainer to have defeated two of Tobias' legendary Pok\u00e9mon, something that not even Tobias' opponent in the finals could achieve. Ash concluded his participation in the Sinnoh League with an impressive new ranking. He bade farewell with Dawn in Twinleaf Town, and parted ways with Brock for the last time.\n\nOnce again, Ash continued his journey to the Unova region, with only his Pikachu. Here, he met and traveled with two new companions: a female trainer named [[Iris (Pok\u00e9mon anime)|Iris]], and a Pok\u00e9mon Connoisseur named [[Cilan (Pok\u00e9mon anime)|Cilan]], who, like Brock before him, is a [[gym leader]]. Throughout Unova, Ash met and competed against more rivals than before, including Trip, Bianca, Stephan, Cameron, and Virgil, most of whom he befriended. Unlike previous seasons, Ash notoriously displayed a drop in skill and competence, and instead regressed back to a beginner, showing little of his previous expertise and relearned many of the basics of catching Pok\u00e9mon (though this may have been due to over-excitement of entering a new region with exclusive Pok\u00e9mon, and slowly wore off as the seasons went on). However, Ash still managed to win all eight gym badges in Unova and then entered the Unova League, where he defeated his arrogant rival, Trip, in the first match, but was defeated by Cameron in the quarter-finals, one match below his previous Pok\u00e9mon League ranking. Cameron was then defeated by Virgil, who went on to win the League with his team of Eevee evolutions.\n\nAlso unlike previous seasons, Ash battled against a much more malevolent Team Rocket, as well as the evil [[Team Plasma]]. After his latest attempt to compete in the Unova League, and foiling both Team Rocket and Team Plasma's attempts to enslave Pok\u00e9mon to conquer the world, Ash's friends traveled with him back to Kanto, where they parted to go own their ways and bade each other farewell.\n\nAsh then ventured to the Kalos region to challenge the Kalos League, as well as learn more about Mega Evolution, a transformation that can take certain fully evolved Pok\u00e9mon to a more powerful temporary form. While there, he began traveling with the siblings Clemont and Bonnie, along with Serena, whom he had met during a Pok\u00e9mon summer camp in Pallet Town when they were much younger. They met new rivals like Sawyer, Shauna, Tierno, Trevor, and Alain. While in Kalos, Ash befriended and acquired new Pok\u00e9mon, including Froakie, which later evolved into a powerful [[Greninja]]. Although Ash did not yet have a Pok\u00e9mon that can mega-evolve (at least not in his current party), the group discovered that his Greninja was capable of \"Bond Phenomenon\", a transformation where Ash and Greninja connect mentally and Greninja's body changes to a color scheme resembling Ash. Like Mega Evolution, the transformation is temporary and makes \"Ash-Greninja\" much more powerful and well capable of defeating mega-evolved Pok\u00e9mon. Currently, no other known Pok\u00e9mon in existence is capable of Bond Phenomenon, and several rivals took great interest in competing with it in the Kalos League with their own mega-evolving Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nIn a stark contrast to the Unova seasons (at least in the beginning), Ash displayed a greater deal of maturity and skill throughout the Kalos seasons, even becoming something of a mentor to his traveling companions. Like before, Ash earned all eight gym badges qualifying him to compete in the Kalos League, and with his newest Pok\u00e9mon, Ash defeated many opponents and their mega-evolved Pok\u00e9mon, advancing all the way to the finals, breaking his previous highest ranking, but was defeated by Alain.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=Ash From Pok\u00e9mon Just Had The Battle Of His Life|url=http://kotaku.com/ash-from-pokemon-just-had-the-battle-of-his-life-1785441421|accessdate=August 19, 2016|date=August 18, 2016}}</ref> After the tournament, Ash and his friends got involved in [[Team Flare]], the local evil organization, final operation to take over Kalos. During the crisis, Ash and his Pok\u00e9mon were captured by Team Flare, who unlike Team Rocket and the previous evil organizations, Team Magma and Team Galactic, he dealt with in the past who captured him so he wouldn't meddle in their plans or used him as a hostage, as their leader, Lysandre, wanted to use him alongside Greninja for his plans. Ash's other Pok\u00e9mon were used by Team Flare as hostages in an attempt to get Ash and Greninja to cooperate. Team Flare used a mini version of their device, capable of controlling Zygarde, in an attempt to control Ash along with Greninja for their Bond Phenomenon while Pikachu and the rest of Ash's Kalos Pok\u00e9mon watched in shock. However, Ash, who was able to hear Pikachu's voice, and Greninja resisted Team Flare's control as they couldn't break their fighting spirit and the bond they share for their friends and each other then used Bond Phenomenon to break free from their restraints. After Alain freed Ash's Pok\u00e9mon from their restraints, Ash and his Pok\u00e9mon were ready to stop Team Flare once and for all with Alain, who was once a Team Flare member,  but decided to help stop them as he saw through his mistakes and due to his friendship with Ash as well, helping. Once Team Flare was stopped, Ash released Greninja to help protect Kalos from other threats. Ash and Greninja also wanted to keep themselves and their friends, especially Pikachu and the rest of the Kalos members, out of harm ways knowing that someone like Team Flare would not only try to use their abilities for evil, but would also use anyone close to them as hostages in an attempt to get what they want. Ash then bade farewell to his friends, before returning to Pallet Town once again.\n\nDuring a vacation with his mother on Melemele Island in the Alola Region, Ash had an encounter with [[Tapu Koko]], one of the local Island Guardian Pok\u00e9mon, who gave him a Z-Ring, an item that allows a Trainer to bring forth super-powered attacks from their Pok\u00e9mon. When Ash used the Z-Ring for the first time with Pikachu, it produced a massive surge of energy that overloaded and shattered the Z-Crystal that powered it, making Ash realize that he needed to learn to control it. In order to master the power of the Z-Ring, Ash then decided to stay in Alola and enrolls at the Pok\u00e9mon School, living with Professor Kukui and studying with his new classmates: Lana, Mallow, Lillie, Sophocles and Kiawe while battling against Team Rocket & [[Team Skull]]. During his stay in Alola, Ash not only encountered many new varieties of Pok\u00e9mon, some of which became part of his new Pok\u00e9mon team, but also competed in the Alolan Island Challenges, each of which led to a Grand Trial against each of the Island Kahunas; emerging victorious in both the Challenges and Trials, Ash received different Z-Crystals. With the discovery of Pok\u00e9mon from other dimensions, known as Ultra Beasts, emerging through wormholes, Ash and his classmates became part of the Ultra Guardians team, charged with capturing the Ultra Beasts and returning them to their own dimensions. Ash later participated in the Alola League, resulting in his first Pok\u00e9mon League conference championship win in his career as a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer and breaking his last League ranking.<ref name = \"Alola win\">{{Cite web |url=https://uproxx.com/gaming/pokemon-ash-ketchum-league-champion/ |title=Ash Ketchum Is Finally Pokemon League Champion After Two Decades Of \u2019Pokemon\u2019 |last=Barnewall |first=Chris |date=2019-09-15 |website=UPROXX |language=en-US |access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref> After the League was done, Ash decided to go back to Pallet Town once again to continue his journey then bid farewell to his friends before setting off to his hometown.\n\nAsh went to a grand opening of a new research facility in Vermilion City with Professor Oak and his mom. After meeting Lugia and befriending a new Trainer named Go, Ash accepted the head professor of the new research facility's offer to be a special assistant alongside his new friend. After accepting the offer, Ash decided to stay in Vermilion City as he and Go will be traveling all over the world to gather information on Pok\u00e9mon. During his journey, Ash learns about Dynamax and even received a Dynamax band from the current world champion Leon, who is also the Galar Region champion. After seeing that his Pikachu can Gigantamax and losing an unofficial battle against Leon, Ash decided to compete in the World Championships so he can climb up the ranks and have an official battle against the current world champion one day.\n\nAsh has considerably improved his abilities as a trainer over the course of the series. However, his earnestness and determination remain the same. During the first season of the series, Ash trained to catch more Pok\u00e9mon than his childhood rival, [[Gary Oak]], although he was always shown to be the stronger trainer. He soon began to focus more on each of his Pok\u00e9mon's abilities. Ash has shown to have the ability to sense and control Aura, which was mainly used with either with Rioul or Lucario. Also, Ash can use Bond Phenomenon, which he used with one of his Pok\u00e9mon. Through his love for Pok\u00e9mon, Ash seems to understand the feelings of them as he sometimes shares a link with them as he senses their pain, see their thoughts, memories, have them appear in his dream as a way of asking for his help for various reasons and hear what they are saying, although the abilities are usually shown mainly with Legendary Pok\u00e9mon but it was once shown with a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon. Also, Ash has shown to sometimes sense a Pok\u00e9mon presences or when one is coming. Although he got involved and ended up getting captured by Team Rocket and an evil organization from his past journeys for various reasons, Ash did avoid getting captured or gotten away from a couple of evil organizations, Team Aqua, Team Plasma and Team Skull.\n\n===Achievements===\n\n====Badges Obtained====\nOver his journey so far, Ash has collected 8 badges from each of the major regions of Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova and Kalos. In addition, he has also obtained 4 badges from the Orange Archipelago and defeated the Orange Islands Champion to gain the Winners' Trophy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://screenrant.com/pokemon-facts-trivia-things-never-knew-about-ash-ketchum-pikachu/?view=all|title=Pok\u00e9mon: 15 Facts You Didn't Know About Ash Ketchum|date=2016-11-12|work=Screen Rant|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en-US}}</ref> He has also collected all 7 Frontier Symbols from Generation III's Battle Frontier, and has been offered a position as a future Frontier Brain, which he declined. In the Alola region, he has completed all the Island Grand Trials, Melemele, Akala, Ula'Ula and Poni Island.\n\n==== Pok\u00e9mon League Rankings ====\nAsh has generally improved in his Pok\u00e9mon League Performances over time, placing in: \n* Indigo Plateau Conference (Kanto) - Top 16\n* Silver Conference (Johto) - Top 8\n* Ever Grande Conference (Hoenn) - Top 8\n* Lily of the Valey Conference (Sinnoh) - Top 4\n* Vertress Conference (Unova) - Top 8\n* Lumiose Conference (Kalos) - Runner-up\n* Manalo Conference (Alola) - Winner\n\n==== Championship Tournament ====\nAsh also participated in other championships, ash ranking in other championships are:\n* Orange League - Winner \n* Kanto Battle Frontier - Winner\n\n===In the video games===\nThe only video game Ash has truly appeared in to date is ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle League]]'', where he tries to become a Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle Master. This game was never released in Japan.\n\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Blue'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Yellow|''Yellow'']], and [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|the remakes of ''Red'' and ''Blue'']], a character very similar to Ash (named [[List of Pok\u00e9mon characters|Red]]) appears as a playable character as well as in cameos in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2|''Pok\u00e9mon Black 2'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2|''White 2'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Gold'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Silver'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|their remakes]], [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Sun'']] and [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Moon'']]. The anime re-imagined Red as Ash Ketchum, the same way it re-imagined Red's rival Blue as Gary Oak and Ethan (the protagonist of the second generation Pok\u00e9mon games as well as their remakes) as Jimmy. Although they are counterparts, they are not the same characters because they originate from different [[canon (fiction)|canons]] and thus developed from different experiences.\nThough ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Yellow]]'' has certain plot aspects that were inspired by the anime series, the player character is still named Red rather than Ash.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']]'s demo, the player character, Sun, receives a letter from Ash, along with his Greninja, which is capable of assuming its \"Ash-Greninja\" form through its ability Battle Bond. Ash also makes a cameo in Ghost Trial of the full game, where one may see a blurry photo of him and his Pikachu in the back room.\n\n===Printed adaptations===\nThe portrayals of Ash in the manga ''[[The Electric Tale of Pikachu]]'', and ''[[Ash & Pikachu]]'', are very similar to the one in the anime. There are key differences in the manga, though. ''The Electric Tale of Pikachu'' is based on Ash's journey up until the end of the Orange Islands travel. Ash is usually seen traveling by himself during the course of this manga although he is joined by [[Misty (Pok\u00e9mon)|Misty]] and [[Brock (Pok\u00e9mon)|Brock]] in Indigo sometimes. Misty is the only one to join Ash in the Orange Islands. The ''Ash & Pikachu'' manga is similar, although it has the episodes from the anime like \"The Fortune Hunters\" and \"A Goldenrod Opportunity\" combined, but with a couple of changes. Manga author [[Toshihiro Ono]] cited Ash as one of his favorite characters to draw for the series, stating, \"I want to go on a trip with Misty just like him! (And forget about job, rent, etc.)\".<ref name=\"Onointerview\">{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000510020712/http://www.vizkids.com/pokemon/news_interview.shtml |title=Animerica Interview Toshihiro Ono |url=http://www.vizkids.com/pokemon/news_interview.shtml |archivedate=May 10, 2000 |publisher=[[VIZ Media]] |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}</ref>\nIn ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Adventures]]'', Red depicts his appearance from what he wore in the games.\n\n=== In other media ===\nAlthough not parodied quite as frequently as the franchise mascot Pikachu, Ash still has many parodies and appearances in various other media, ranging from an [[Pok\u00e9mon Apok\u00e9lypse|unofficial fan-made film]] to several representations in web media, including many parodies on the YouTube channel [[Smosh]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Smosh 2nd Channel|title=I'M ASH KETCHUM!

Bart remarks \"Wow, how does this show stay so fresh?\", which is both a reference to the length of the anime, as well as referencing the length of ''The Simpsons'' itself in an ironic way. In the episode \"The Perspiration Implementation\" of the TV show ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', Ash is mentioned by the character [[Sheldon Cooper]] when he attempts to ask a girl out by saying \"And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, I choose you.\",<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com/series-9-episode-05-the-perspiration-implementation/|title=Series 09 Episode 05 \u2013 The Perspiration Implementation|date=2016-01-26|work=Big Bang Theory Transcripts|access-date=2017-05-17|language=en-US}}</ref> which specifically references how Pikachu was Ash's first Pok\u00e9mon.

He is the [[protagonist]] of the [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime]] and certain [[Pok\u00e9mon (manga)|manga]] series as well as on various merchandise related to the franchise. In Japanese, the character is voiced by [[Rica Matsumoto]]. In the English dub, he was voiced by [[Veronica Taylor]] in the first eight seasons and has been voiced by [[Sarah Natochenny]] since season 9.\n\nHis English name is derived from the Japanese name (as the letters 'ash' are included in 'S'''a'''to'''sh'''i') and his English motto, \"Gotta Catch 'Em All\". Ash's dream is to become a [[Pok\u00e9mon Master]]. He is loosely based on [[Red (Pok\u00e9mon)|Red]], the player character from the Generation I games  ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|Pok\u00e9mon Red, Green, Blue]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Yellow|Yellow]]'' as well as the Generation III games [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pok\u00e9mon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']] versions. The character's first official appearance in a game was in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle League]]''.

At the time of her audition, Taylor stated that the character was temporarily named Casey, which was the name later given to a recurring character in Johto. After the script was translated from Japanese, the lines were adapted to fit the movements of the character's mouth (called ''lip flap''). All the voices were recorded separately, so Taylor was the only one in the booth when she recorded her lines, which took approximately six to eight hours per episode. Taylor was often the first person to record, so she had to \"imagine how the previous line will be said\". \"Luckily, I work with a great director who helps with the interpretation of the line, matching of the lip flap, and consistency of the voice\".

As a ten-year-old hailing from Pallet Town in the Kanto region, Ash was offered a choice between three Pok\u00e9mon as his starter: Bulbasaur, Squirtle and Charmander. While he was planning to choose Squirtle, he received the electric type Pok\u00e9mon [[Pikachu]] from [[Professor Oak]] instead in this episode, because he woke up late and all the other starter Pok\u00e9mon had been taken by other trainers. After receiving Pikachu and a Pok\u00e9dex, Ash left Pallet Town to start his journey.<!-- episode 1 --> Since then Ash has traveled the world of Pok\u00e9mon, competed in many challenges and caught newer Pok\u00e9mon. He has met many companions, such as [[Misty (Pok\u00e9mon)|Misty]] and [[Brock (Pok\u00e9mon)|Brock]].\n\nThroughout the series, Ash's primary enemies are a criminal organization called [[Team Rocket (anime)|Team Rocket]], specifically the two comical and bumbling members, Jessie and James, and their talking [[Meowth]], who is essentially the third member of the group. Ever since being defeated by Ash's [[Pikachu]] in the second episode, \"Pok\u00e9mon Emergency!\", the three of them have obsessively never stopped chasing after them to steal Ash's Pikachu, maintaining the delusion that Pikachu is abnormally powerful and presenting it to their criminal boss would make them very rich. As the enduring comical villains of the series, the Team Rocket trio occasionally show signs of goodness, such as care and friendship with their Pok\u00e9mon and each other, and despite their constant [[antagonist|antagonism]], they occasionally put their differences aside and work together with Ash against a common threat, such as in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: The Movie 2000]]'', where they aid Ash in retrieving the three treasures in order to save the world.\n\nDuring his travels, Ash still had a lot to learn as a trainer. He caught his Pok\u00e9mon by merely befriending them, knew absolutely nothing about battling, and many of his gym badges were earned rather controversially. In fact, the only legitimate victories were over Lt. Surge, Koga, and Blaine, while the others were earned on technical convenience or given to him out of gratitude. Ash also shows a deep love for Pok\u00e9mon in the series, protecting wild Pok\u00e9mon or his own from getting injured or trying to help them, despite getting significantly hurt himself. He honed his skill as a Pok\u00e9mon trainer and was able to get all 8 badges, enabling him to compete in the Indigo League. Ash was able to go to the 5th round, and achieve the Top 16 \u2014 one round further than his competitive rival Gary, who finished in the Top 32. However, due to his inexperience in handling his more powerful Pok\u00e9mon, Ash was eliminated from his first Pok\u00e9mon League competition in a very unflattering manner, which greatly disappointed him but he got over it and vowed to not make the same mistake in a league again.\n\nAsh traveled to the Orange Islands with [[Misty (Pok\u00e9mon)|Misty]] and [[List of characters in the Pok\u00e9mon anime series|Tracey Sketchit]], a Pok\u00e9mon watcher, obtained all 4 badges and competed in the Orange League to battle Drake, the Orange League Champion. Ash was able to win his battle against Drake, giving him his first League Championship as a Pok\u00e9mon trainer. This particular Pok\u00e9mon League exists only in the anime series, and not adapted from the video game series.\n\nHe then traveled on to the Johto region with Brock and Misty, hoping to meet with Gary and finally defeat him in the Johto League. He won 8 badges and competed in the Johto Conference. Ash beat Gary again, in the 1st round of the conference, and was able to make it to the quarter-finals, and achieve Top 8. However, he lost against his new rival Harrison in the 2nd round. Ash then moved on and traveled through the Hoenn region, along with Brock and two new characters: May, an aspiring Pok\u00e9mon coordinator, and her younger brother Max, and together they ended up bringing down the rival teams [[Team Magma]] and [[Team Aqua]]. He was able to get all 8 badges and then competed in the Hoenn Conference. Ash was able to defeat his 1st new rival Morrison, in the 2nd round, also entering in the quarter-finals, and achieving Top 8 again. However, he lost in the 3rd round against his 2nd new rival Tyson.\n\nHaving gone through several leagues and gotten a lot stronger, Ash decided to challenge the Kanto \"Battle Frontier\" and its 7 Brains (leaders). Ash defeated all of the Brains and acquired all the 7 Battle Frontier symbols, becoming a \"Strong Battle Frontier champion\" and qualifying for becoming a Frontier Brain himself. However, Ash, wanting to learn more about Pok\u00e9mon and get even stronger, decided to continue his journey, not as a Frontier Brain, but as a trainer. However, having acquired all 7 symbols, he left with the privilege of becoming a Frontier Brain if and when he wants in the future.\n\nAsh, along with Brock, traveled to Sinnoh, befriended a new traveling companion, [[Dawn (Pok\u00e9mon)|Dawn]], and also found a brutal new rival in [[Paul (Pok\u00e9mon)|Paul]]; and through their journey they encountered and defeated [[Team Galactic]]. Ash won all 8 Sinnoh gym badges and competed in the Sinnoh conference at the Lily of the Valley Island. He eventually faced Paul in the quarter-finals of the Sinnoh League Festival and finally defeated him, marking the first time Ash has ever made it into the semi-finals in a Pok\u00e9mon League. Afterwards, however, Ash was matched against Tobias, a trainer who famously swept all eight Sinnoh League gyms and all other opponents with only his legendary Pok\u00e9mon [[Darkrai]]. Ash was eventually defeated by Tobias, but not without having defeated his Darkrai, as well as his [[Latios]], which is also a legendary Pok\u00e9mon, whom Ash also defeated in a draw with his final Pok\u00e9mon, making Ash the only known trainer to have defeated two of Tobias' legendary Pok\u00e9mon, something that not even Tobias' opponent in the finals could achieve. Ash concluded his participation in the Sinnoh League with an impressive new ranking. He bade farewell with Dawn in Twinleaf Town, and parted ways with Brock for the last time.\n\nOnce again, Ash continued his journey to the Unova region, with only his Pikachu. Here, he met and traveled with two new companions: a female trainer named [[Iris (Pok\u00e9mon anime)|Iris]], and a Pok\u00e9mon Connoisseur named [[Cilan (Pok\u00e9mon anime)|Cilan]], who, like Brock before him, is a [[gym leader]]. Throughout Unova, Ash met and competed against more rivals than before, including Trip, Bianca, Stephan, Cameron, and Virgil, most of whom he befriended. Unlike previous seasons, Ash notoriously displayed a drop in skill and competence, and instead regressed back to a beginner, showing little of his previous expertise and relearned many of the basics of catching Pok\u00e9mon (though this may have been due to over-excitement of entering a new region with exclusive Pok\u00e9mon, and slowly wore off as the seasons went on). However, Ash still managed to win all eight gym badges in Unova and then entered the Unova League, where he defeated his arrogant rival, Trip, in the first match, but was defeated by Cameron in the quarter-finals, one match below his previous Pok\u00e9mon League ranking. Cameron was then defeated by Virgil, who went on to win the League with his team of Eevee evolutions.\n\nAlso unlike previous seasons, Ash battled against a much more malevolent Team Rocket, as well as the evil [[Team Plasma]]. After his latest attempt to compete in the Unova League, and foiling both Team Rocket and Team Plasma's attempts to enslave Pok\u00e9mon to conquer the world, Ash's friends traveled with him back to Kanto, where they parted to go own their ways and bade each other farewell.\n\nAsh then ventured to the Kalos region to challenge the Kalos League, as well as learn more about Mega Evolution, a transformation that can take certain fully evolved Pok\u00e9mon to a more powerful temporary form. While there, he began traveling with the siblings Clemont and Bonnie, along with Serena, whom he had met during a Pok\u00e9mon summer camp in Pallet Town when they were much younger. They met new rivals like Sawyer, Shauna, Tierno, Trevor, and Alain. While in Kalos, Ash befriended and acquired new Pok\u00e9mon, including Froakie, which later evolved into a powerful [[Greninja]]. Although Ash did not yet have a Pok\u00e9mon that can mega-evolve (at least not in his current party), the group discovered that his Greninja was capable of \"Bond Phenomenon\", a transformation where Ash and Greninja connect mentally and Greninja's body changes to a color scheme resembling Ash. Like Mega Evolution, the transformation is temporary and makes \"Ash-Greninja\" much more powerful and well capable of defeating mega-evolved Pok\u00e9mon. Currently, no other known Pok\u00e9mon in existence is capable of Bond Phenomenon, and several rivals took great interest in competing with it in the Kalos League with their own mega-evolving Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nIn a stark contrast to the Unova seasons (at least in the beginning), Ash displayed a greater deal of maturity and skill throughout the Kalos seasons, even becoming something of a mentor to his traveling companions. Like before, Ash earned all eight gym badges qualifying him to compete in the Kalos League, and with his newest Pok\u00e9mon, Ash defeated many opponents and their mega-evolved Pok\u00e9mon, advancing all the way to the finals, breaking his previous highest ranking, but was defeated by Alain.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=Ash From Pok\u00e9mon Just Had The Battle Of His Life|url=http://kotaku.com/ash-from-pokemon-just-had-the-battle-of-his-life-1785441421|accessdate=August 19, 2016|date=August 18, 2016}}</ref> After the tournament, Ash and his friends got involved in [[Team Flare]], the local evil organization, final operation to take over Kalos. During the crisis, Ash and his Pok\u00e9mon were captured by Team Flare, who unlike Team Rocket and the previous evil organizations, Team Magma and Team Galactic, he dealt with in the past who captured him so he wouldn't meddle in their plans or used him as a hostage, as their leader, Lysandre, wanted to use him alongside Greninja for his plans. Ash's other Pok\u00e9mon were used by Team Flare as hostages in an attempt to get Ash and Greninja to cooperate. Team Flare used a mini version of their device, capable of controlling Zygarde, in an attempt to control Ash along with Greninja for their Bond Phenomenon while Pikachu and the rest of Ash's Kalos Pok\u00e9mon watched in shock. However, Ash, who was able to hear Pikachu's voice, and Greninja resisted Team Flare's control as they couldn't break their fighting spirit and the bond they share for their friends and each other then used Bond Phenomenon to break free from their restraints. After Alain freed Ash's Pok\u00e9mon from their restraints, Ash and his Pok\u00e9mon were ready to stop Team Flare once and for all with Alain, who was once a Team Flare member,  but decided to help stop them as he saw through his mistakes and due to his friendship with Ash as well, helping. Once Team Flare was stopped, Ash released Greninja to help protect Kalos from other threats. Ash and Greninja also wanted to keep themselves and their friends, especially Pikachu and the rest of the Kalos members, out of harm ways knowing that someone like Team Flare would not only try to use their abilities for evil, but would also use anyone close to them as hostages in an attempt to get what they want. Ash then bade farewell to his friends, before returning to Pallet Town once again.\n\nDuring a vacation with his mother on Melemele Island in the Alola Region, Ash had an encounter with [[Tapu Koko]], one of the local Island Guardian Pok\u00e9mon, who gave him a Z-Ring, an item that allows a Trainer to bring forth super-powered attacks from their Pok\u00e9mon. When Ash used the Z-Ring for the first time with Pikachu, it produced a massive surge of energy that overloaded and shattered the Z-Crystal that powered it, making Ash realize that he needed to learn to control it. In order to master the power of the Z-Ring, Ash then decided to stay in Alola and enrolls at the Pok\u00e9mon School, living with Professor Kukui and studying with his new classmates: Lana, Mallow, Lillie, Sophocles and Kiawe while battling against Team Rocket & [[Team Skull]]. During his stay in Alola, Ash not only encountered many new varieties of Pok\u00e9mon, some of which became part of his new Pok\u00e9mon team, but also competed in the Alolan Island Challenges, each of which led to a Grand Trial against each of the Island Kahunas; emerging victorious in both the Challenges and Trials, Ash received different Z-Crystals. With the discovery of Pok\u00e9mon from other dimensions, known as Ultra Beasts, emerging through wormholes, Ash and his classmates became part of the Ultra Guardians team, charged with capturing the Ultra Beasts and returning them to their own dimensions. Ash later participated in the Alola League, resulting in his first Pok\u00e9mon League conference championship win in his career as a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer and breaking his last League ranking.<ref name = \"Alola win\">{{Cite web |url=https://uproxx.com/gaming/pokemon-ash-ketchum-league-champion/ |title=Ash Ketchum Is Finally Pokemon League Champion After Two Decades Of \u2019Pokemon\u2019 |last=Barnewall |first=Chris |date=2019-09-15 |website=UPROXX |language=en-US |access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref> After the League was done, Ash decided to go back to Pallet Town once again to continue his journey then bid farewell to his friends before setting off to his hometown.\n\nAsh went to a grand opening of a new research facility in Vermilion City with Professor Oak and his mom. After meeting Lugia and befriending a new Trainer named Go, Ash accepted the head professor of the new research facility's offer to be a special assistant alongside his new friend. After accepting the offer, Ash decided to stay in Vermilion City as he and Go will be traveling all over the world to gather information on Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nAsh has considerably improved his abilities as a trainer over the course of the series. However, his earnestness and determination remain the same. During the first season of the series, Ash trained to catch more Pok\u00e9mon than his childhood rival, [[Gary Oak]], although Gary was always shown to be the stronger trainer. He soon began to focus more on each of his Pok\u00e9mon's abilities. Ash has some unusual abilities such as to sense and control Aura, Bond Phenomenon and to understand the feelings of Pok\u00e9mon. Through his ability to understand the feelings of Pok\u00e9mon, Ash has shown the ability to share a link with Pok\u00e9mon such as he senses their pain, see their thoughts, memories, have them appear in his dream as a way of asking for his help for various reasons and hear what they are saying, although the abilities are usually shown mainly with Legendary Pok\u00e9mon but it was once shown with a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon. Also, Ash has shown to sometimes sense a Pok\u00e9mon presences or when one is coming. Although he got involved and ended up getting captured by Team Rocket and an evil organization from his past journeys for various reasons, Ash did avoid getting captured or gotten away from a couple of evil organizations, Team Aqua, Team Plasma and Team Skull.\n\n===Achievements===\n\n====Badges Obtained====\nOver his journey so far, Ash has collected 8 badges from each of the major regions of Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova and Kalos. In addition, he has also obtained 4 badges from the Orange Archipelago and defeated the Orange Islands Champion to gain the Winners' Trophy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://screenrant.com/pokemon-facts-trivia-things-never-knew-about-ash-ketchum-pikachu/?view=all|title=Pok\u00e9mon: 15 Facts You Didn't Know About Ash Ketchum|date=2016-11-12|work=Screen Rant|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en-US}}</ref> He has also collected all 7 Frontier Symbols from Generation III's Battle Frontier, and has been offered a position as a future Frontier Brain, which he declined. In the Alola region, he has completed all the Island Grand Trials, Melemele, Akala, Ula'Ula and Poni Island.\n\n==== Pok\u00e9mon League Rankings ====\nAsh has generally improved in his Pok\u00e9mon League Performances over time, placing in: \n* Indigo Plateau Conference (Kanto) - Top 16\n* Silver Conference (Johto) - Top 8\n* Ever Grande Conference (Hoenn) - Top 8\n* Lily of the Valey Conference (Sinnoh) - Top 4\n* Vertress Conference (Unova) - Top 8\n* Lumiose Conference (Kalos) - Runner-up\n* Manalo Conference (Alola) - Winner\n\n==== Championship Tournament ====\nAsh also participated in other championships, ash ranking in other championships are:\n* Orange League - Winner \n* Kanto Battle Frontier - Winner\n\n===In the video games===\nThe only video game Ash has truly appeared in to date is ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle League]]'', where he tries to become a Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle Master. This game was never released in Japan.\n\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Blue'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Yellow|''Yellow'']], and [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|the remakes of ''Red'' and ''Blue'']], a character very similar to Ash (named [[List of Pok\u00e9mon characters|Red]]) appears as a playable character as well as in cameos in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2|''Pok\u00e9mon Black 2'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2|''White 2'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Gold'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Silver'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|their remakes]], [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Sun'']] and [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Moon'']]. The anime re-imagined Red as Ash Ketchum, the same way it re-imagined Red's rival Blue as Gary Oak and Ethan (the protagonist of the second generation Pok\u00e9mon games as well as their remakes) as Jimmy. Although they are counterparts, they are not the same characters because they originate from different [[canon (fiction)|canons]] and thus developed from different experiences.\nThough ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Yellow]]'' has certain plot aspects that were inspired by the anime series, the player character is still named Red rather than Ash.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']]'s demo, the player character, Sun, receives a letter from Ash, along with his Greninja, which is capable of assuming its \"Ash-Greninja\" form through its ability Battle Bond. Ash also makes a cameo in Ghost Trial of the full game, where one may see a blurry photo of him and his Pikachu in the back room.\n\n===Printed adaptations===\nThe portrayals of Ash in the manga ''[[The Electric Tale of Pikachu]]'', and ''[[Ash & Pikachu]]'', are very similar to the one in the anime. There are key differences in the manga, though. ''The Electric Tale of Pikachu'' is based on Ash's journey up until the end of the Orange Islands travel. Ash is usually seen traveling by himself during the course of this manga although he is joined by [[Misty (Pok\u00e9mon)|Misty]] and [[Brock (Pok\u00e9mon)|Brock]] in Indigo sometimes. Misty is the only one to join Ash in the Orange Islands. The ''Ash & Pikachu'' manga is similar, although it has the episodes from the anime like \"The Fortune Hunters\" and \"A Goldenrod Opportunity\" combined, but with a couple of changes. Manga author [[Toshihiro Ono]] cited Ash as one of his favorite characters to draw for the series, stating, \"I want to go on a trip with Misty just like him! (And forget about job, rent, etc.)\".<ref name=\"Onointerview\">{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000510020712/http://www.vizkids.com/pokemon/news_interview.shtml |title=Animerica Interview Toshihiro Ono |url=http://www.vizkids.com/pokemon/news_interview.shtml |archivedate=May 10, 2000 |publisher=[[VIZ Media]] |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}</ref>\nIn ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Adventures]]'', Red depicts his appearance from what he wore in the games.\n\n=== In other media ===\nAlthough not parodied quite as frequently as the franchise mascot Pikachu, Ash still has many parodies and appearances in various other media, ranging from an [[Pok\u00e9mon Apok\u00e9lypse|unofficial fan-made film]] to several representations in web media, including many parodies on the YouTube channel [[Smosh]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Smosh 2nd Channel|title=I'M ASH KETCHUM!

Bart remarks \"Wow, how does this show stay so fresh?\", which is both a reference to the length of the anime, as well as referencing the length of ''The Simpsons'' itself in an ironic way.

[[Sweden]] on 31 January 2020, when a woman returning from [[Wuhan]] tested positive. On 26 February, following outbreaks [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Italy|in Italy]] and [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Iran|in Iran]], multiple travel-related clusters appeared in Sweden. [[Transmission (medicine)#Definition and related terms|Community transmission]] was confirmed on 9 March in the [[Stockholm Regional Council|Stockholm region]].

Government also helped those under loans.\n\n=== Low Productivity ===\nIn the context of India's rapidly growing population, the country's traditional agricultural practices yielded insufficient food production. By the 1960s, this low productivity led India to experience food grain shortages that were more severe than those of other developing countries. Agricultural technological advancements offered opportunities to increase productivity.<ref name=\":22\"/>\n\n== Criticisms of the Green Revolution ==\nThe Green Revolution yielded great economic prosperity during its early years. In Punjab, where it was first introduced, the Green Revolution led to significant increases in the state's agricultural output, supporting India\u2019s overall economy. By 1970, Punjab was producing 70 percent of the country's total food grains,<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Sandhu|first=Jashandeep Singh|date=2014|title=Green Revolution: A Case Study of Punjab|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress|volume=75|pages=1192\u20131199|via=JSTOR}}</ref> and farmers' incomes were increasing by over 70 percent.<ref name=\":02\" /> Punjab's prosperity following the Green Revolution became a model to which other states aspired to reach.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/violenceofgreen00shiv|title=The Violence of the green revolution : ecological degredation and political conflict|last=Shiva, Vandana.|date=1991|publisher=Zed|isbn=0-86232-964-7|oclc=24740968|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nHowever, despite the initial prosperity experienced in Punjab, the Green Revolution was met with much controversy throughout India.\n\n=== Indian Economic Sovereignty ===\nCriticism of the effects of the green revolution include the cost for many small farmers using HYV seeds, with their associated demands of increased irrigation systems and pesticides. A case study is found in India, where farmers are buying [[Monsanto]] BT cotton seeds\u2014sold on the idea that these seeds produced 'natural insecticides'. In reality, they need to still pay for expensive pesticides and irrigation systems, which might lead to increased borrowing to finance the change from traditional seed varieties. Many farmers have difficulty in paying for the expensive technologies, especially if they have a bad harvest. These high costs of cultivation push rural farmers to take out loans\u2014typically at high interest rates.<ref name=\":12\"/> Over-borrowing commonly entraps farmers into a cycle of debt.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nOn top of this, India's liberalized economy further exacerbates the farmers's economic conditions. Indian environmentalist [[Vandana Shiva]] writes that this is the \"second Green Revolution\". The first Green Revolution, she suggests, was mostly publicly funded (by the Indian Government). This new Green Revolution, she says, is driven by private (and foreign) interest \u2013 notably MNCs like Monsanto\u2014as encourage by the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] context. Ultimately, this is leading to foreign ownership over most of India's farmland, undermining farmers' interests.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nFarmer's financial issues have become especially apparent in Punjab, where its rural areas have witnessed an alarming rise in suicide rates.<ref name=\":12\" /> Excluding the countless unreported cases, there has been estimated to be a 51.97 per cent increase in the number of suicides in Punjab in 1992-93, compared to the recorded 5.11 per cent increase in the country as a whole.<ref name=\":12\" /> According to a 2019 Indian newspaper, indebtedness continues to be a grave issue affecting Punjabi people today, demonstrated by the more than 900 recorded farmer suicided in Punjab in the last two years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farm-suicides-unabated-in-punjab-over-900-in-2-years/727671.html|title=Farm suicides unabated in Punjab, over 900 in 2 years|last=Bharti|first=Vishav|date=Feb 12, 2019|work=The Tribune|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Environmental Damage ===\nExcessive and inappropriate use of fertilizers and pesticides polluted waterways and killed beneficial insects and wild life. It has caused [[overexploitation|over-use]] of soil and rapidly depleted its nutrients. The rampant irrigation practices led to eventual [[soil degradation]]. Groundwater practices have fallen dramatically. Further, heavy dependence on few major crops has led to [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] of farmers. These problems were aggravated due to absence of training to use modern technology and vast illiteracy leading to excessive use of chemicals.[https://sol.du.ac.in/mod/book/view.php?id=1735&chapterid=1695]\n\n=== Increased Regional disparities ===\nThe green revolution spread only in irrigated and high-potential rainfed areas. The villages or regions without the access of sufficient water were left out that widened the regional disparities between adopters and non-adopters. Since, the HYV seeds technically can be applied only in a land with assured water supply and availability of other inputs like chemicals, fertilizers etc. The application of the new technology in the dry-land areas is simply ruled out.\n\nThe states like Punjab, Haryana, Western UP etc. having good irrigation and other infrastructure facilities were able to derive the benefits of the green revolution and achieve faster economic development while other states have recorded slow growth in agriculture production.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{India topics}}\n{{Agriculture in India}}\n\n[[Category:Agricultural revolutions]]\n[[Category:History of agriculture in India]]\n[[Category:Intensive farming]]\n[[Category:History of the Republic of India]]\n[[Category:Economic history of India]]\n[[Category:Indira Gandhi administration]]\n[[Category:History of Punjab, India (1947\u2013present)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=March 2018}}\n{{More citations needed|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:Punjab Monsoon.jpg|thumbnail|250px|The state of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] led India's [[Green Revolution]] and earned the distinction of being the country's wheat basket.<ref>{{cite report |url=http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/stateplan/sdr_pdf/shdr_pun04.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2004, Punjab |date=2004 |author=[[Government of Punjab, India|The Government of Punjab]] |accessdate=9 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110708073911/http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/stateplan/sdr_pdf/shdr_pun04.pdf| archivedate= 8 July 2011 | url-status= live}} Section: \"The Green Revolution\", pp. 17\u201320.</ref>]]\n\nThe '''Green Revolution in India''' refers to a period when Indian [[agriculture in India|agriculture]] was converted into an industrial system due to the adoption of modern methods and technology such as the use of [[High-yielding variety|high yielding variety (HYV) seeds]], tractors, irrigation facilities, pesticides, and fertilizers.

By 1970, Punjab was producing 70 percent of the country's total food grains,<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Sandhu|first=Jashandeep Singh|date=2014|title=Green Revolution: A Case Study of Punjab|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress|volume=75|pages=1192\u20131199|via=JSTOR}}</ref> and farmers' incomes were increasing by over 70 percent.<ref name=\":02\" /> Punjab's prosperity following the Green Revolution became a model to which other states aspired to reach.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/violenceofgreen00shiv|title=The Violence of the green revolution : ecological degredation and political conflict|last=Shiva, Vandana.|date=1991|publisher=Zed|isbn=0-86232-964-7|oclc=24740968|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nHowever, despite the initial prosperity experienced in Punjab, the Green Revolution was met with much controversy throughout India.\n\n=== Indian Economic Sovereignty ===\nCriticism of the effects of the green revolution include the cost for many small farmers using HYV seeds, with their associated demands of increased irrigation systems and pesticides. A case study is found in India, where farmers are buying [[Monsanto]] BT cotton seeds\u2014sold on the idea that these seeds produced 'natural insecticides'. In reality, they need to still pay for expensive pesticides and irrigation systems, which might lead to increased borrowing to finance the change from traditional seed varieties. Many farmers have difficulty in paying for the expensive technologies, especially if they have a bad harvest. These high costs of cultivation push rural farmers to take out loans\u2014typically at high interest rates.<ref name=\":12\"/> Over-borrowing commonly entraps farmers into a cycle of debt.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nOn top of this, India's liberalized economy further exacerbates the farmers's economic conditions. Indian environmentalist [[Vandana Shiva]] writes that this is the \"second Green Revolution\". The first Green Revolution, she suggests, was mostly publicly funded (by the Indian Government). This new Green Revolution, she says, is driven by private (and foreign) interest \u2013 notably MNCs like Monsanto\u2014as encourage by the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] context. Ultimately, this is leading to foreign ownership over most of India's farmland, undermining farmers' interests.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nFarmer's financial issues have become especially apparent in Punjab, where its rural areas have witnessed an alarming rise in suicide rates.<ref name=\":12\" /> Excluding the countless unreported cases, there has been estimated to be a 51.97 per cent increase in the number of suicides in Punjab in 1992-93, compared to the recorded 5.11 per cent increase in the country as a whole.<ref name=\":12\" /> According to a 2019 Indian newspaper, indebtedness continues to be a grave issue affecting Punjabi people today, demonstrated by the more than 900 recorded farmer suicided in Punjab in the last two years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farm-suicides-unabated-in-punjab-over-900-in-2-years/727671.html|title=Farm suicides unabated in Punjab, over 900 in 2 years|last=Bharti|first=Vishav|date=Feb 12, 2019|work=The Tribune|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Environmental Damage ===\nExcessive and inappropriate use of fertilizers and pesticides polluted waterways and killed beneficial insects and wild life. It has caused [[overexploitation|over-use]] of soil and rapidly depleted its nutrients. The rampant irrigation practices led to eventual [[soil degradation]]. Groundwater practices have fallen dramatically. Further, heavy dependence on few major crops has led to [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] of farmers. These problems were aggravated due to absence of training to use modern technology and vast illiteracy leading to excessive use of chemicals.[https://sol.du.ac.in/mod/book/view.php?id=1735&chapterid=1695]\n\n=== Increased Regional disparities ===\nThe green revolution spread only in irrigated and high-potential rainfed areas. The villages or regions without the access of sufficient water were left out that widened the regional disparities between adopters and non-adopters. Since, the HYV seeds technically can be applied only in a land with assured water supply and availability of other inputs like chemicals, fertilizers etc. The application of the new technology in the dry-land areas is simply ruled out.\n\nThe states like Punjab, Haryana, Western UP etc. having good irrigation and other infrastructure facilities were able to derive the benefits of the green revolution and achieve faster economic development while other states have recorded slow growth in agriculture production.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{India topics}}\n{{Agriculture in India}}\n\n[[Category:Agricultural revolutions]]\n[[Category:History of agriculture in India]]\n[[Category:Intensive farming]]\n[[Category:History of the Republic of India]]\n[[Category:Economic history of India]]\n[[Category:Indira Gandhi administration]]\n[[Category:History of Punjab, India (1947\u2013present)]]\n", "name_user": "Priyadarshi Mukhopadhyay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor important edit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution_in_India"}

The white fur caused by a lack of the pigment [[pheomelanin]], which is found in Bengal tigers with orange color fur. When compared to Bengal tigers, the white Bengal tigers tend to grow faster and heavier than the orange Bengal tiger. They also tend to be somewhat bigger at birth, and as fully grown adults. White Bengal tigers are fully grown when they are 2\u20133 years of age. White male tigers reach weights of {{convert|200|to|230|kg|lb}} and can grow up to {{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} in length. As with all tigers, the white Bengal tiger\u2019s stripes are like fingerprints, with no two tigers having the same pattern. The stripes of the tiger are a pigmentation of the skin; if an individual were to be shaved, its distinctive coat pattern would still be visible.<ref name=\"animalcorner.co.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://www.animalcorner.co.uk/rainforests/bengalwhite.html |title=White Bengal Tiger |website=Animal Corner |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401075203/http://www.animalcorner.co.uk/rainforests/bengalwhite.html |archive-date=2008-04-01}}</ref>\n\nFor a white Bengal tiger to be born, both parents must carry the unusual gene for white colouring, which only happens naturally about once in 10,000 births.<ref name=\"animalcorner.co.uk\"/> Dark-striped white individuals are well-documented in the Bengal tiger subspecies (''Panthera tigris tigris'') as well as having been reported historically in several other subspecies.<ref name=\"animalcorner.co.uk\"/> Currently, several hundred white tigers are in captivity worldwide, with about one hundred being found in India. Their unique white color fur has made them popular in entertainment showcasing exotic animals, and at zoos.\n\n== Stripeless tigers ==\n[[File:Whitetigermirage.jpg|thumb|A tiger with almost no stripes at [[The Mirage]] in [[Las Vegas]], the [[United States]] of America]]\n\nAn additional genetic condition can result in near-complete absence of stripes, making the tiger almost pure white. One such specimen was exhibited at Exeter Change in England in 1820, and described by Georges Cuvier as \"A white variety of Tiger is sometimes seen, with the stripes very opaque, and not to be observed except in certain angles of light.\"<ref name=\"cuvier\">{{cite book |last=Cuvier |first=Georges |authorlink=Georges Cuvier |title=The Animal Kingdom they can grow to as tall as |publisher=G & C & H Carvill |year=1832}}</ref> Naturalist [[Richard Lydekker]] said that, \"a white tiger, in which the fur was of a creamy tint, with the usual stripes faintly visible in certain parts, was exhibited at the old menagerie at Exeter Change about the year 1820.\"<ref name=\"lydekker1\">{{cite book |author=Lydekker, R. |authorlink=Richard Lydekker |title=The Royal Natural History |url=https://archive.org/details/royalnaturalhist06lyde |publisher=Frederick Warne |year=1893}}</ref> Hamilton Smith said, \"A wholly white tiger, with the stripe-pattern visible only under reflected light, like the pattern of a white tabby cat, was exhibited in the Exeter Change Menagerie in 1820.\", and [[John George Wood]] stated that, \"a creamy white, with the ordinary tigerine stripes so faintly marked that they were only visible in certain lights.\" [[Edwin Henry Landseer]] also drew this tigress in 1824.\n\nThe modern strain of snow white tigers came from repeated brother\u2013sister matings of Bhim and Sumita at [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]]. The gene involved may have come from a [[Siberian tiger]], their part-Siberian ancestor Tony. Continued inbreeding appears to have caused a recessive gene for stripelessness to show up. About one fourth of Bhim and Sumita's offspring were stripeless. Their striped white offspring, which have been sold to zoos around the world, may also carry the stripeless gene. Because Tony's genome is present in many white tiger pedigrees, the gene may also be present in other captive white tigers. As a result, stripeless white tigers have appeared in zoos as far afield as the [[Czech Republic]] ([[Liberec#Zoo and botanical garden|Liberec]]), [[Spain]] and [[Mexico]].

Siamese cats and albinos of every species which have been studied all exhibit the same visual pathway abnormality found in white tigers. Siamese cats are also sometimes cross-eyed, as are some albino [[ferret]]s. The visual pathway abnormality was first documented in white tigers in the brain of a white tiger called Moni after he died, although his eyes were of normal alignment. The abnormality is that there is a disruption in the [[optic chiasm]]. The examination of Moni's brain suggested the disruption is less severe in white tigers than it is in Siamese cats. Because of the visual pathway abnormality, by which some [[optic nerve]]s are routed to the wrong side of the brain, white tigers have a problem with spatial orientation, and bump into things until they learn to compensate. Some tigers compensate by crossing their eyes. When the neurons pass from the retina to the brain and reach the optic chiasma, some cross and some do not, so that visual images are projected to the wrong hemisphere of the brain. White tigers cannot see as well as normal tigers and suffer from photophobia, like albinos.<ref name=\"Gorham\">Gorham, Mary Ellen, DVM.

Reduced fertility and miscarriages, noted by \"tiger man\" Kailash Sankhala in pure-Bengal white tigers, were attributed to [[inbreeding depression]].<ref name=\"sankhala1977\"/> A condition known as \"star-gazing\" (the head and neck are raised almost straight up, as if the affected animal is gazing at the stars), which is associated with inbreeding in big cats, has also been reported in white tigers.<ref name=\"Gorham\"/> Some white tigers born to North American lines have ''bulldog'' faces with a snub nose, jutting jaw, domed head and wide-set eyes with an indentation between the eyes. However, some of these traits may be linked to poor diet rather than inbreeding.\n\nThere was a {{convert|450|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} male cross-eyed white tiger at the [[Pana'ewa Rainforest Zoo]] in [[Hawaii]], which was donated to the zoo by [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] magician Dirk Arthur.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hilo Area Attractions |website=tripsavvy |date=12 December 2017 |url=https://www.tripsavvy.com/hilo-area-attractions-1532636 |author=Fischer, John |access-date=2018-05-25}}</ref> There is a picture of a white tiger which appears to be cross-eyed on just one side in Siegfried & Roy's book ''Mastering The Impossible''.

Cincinnati Zoo director Ed Maruska said: \"We have not experienced premature death among our white tigers. Forty-two animals born in our collection are still alive. Mohan, a large white tiger, died just short of his 20th birthday, an enviable age for a male of any subspecies, since most males live shorter captive lives. Premature deaths in other collections may be artifacts of captive environmental conditions...in 52 births we had four stillbirths, one of which was an unexplained loss. We lost two additional cubs from viral pneumonia, which is not excessive. Without data from non-inbred tiger lines, it is difficult to determine whether this number is high or low with any degree of accuracy.\"<ref name=\"Maruska\"/> Ed Maruska also addressed the issue of deformities: \"Other than a case of hip dysplasia that occurred in a male white tiger, we have not encountered any other body deformities or any physiological or neurological disorders.

A white Amur tiger may have been born at Center Hill and has given rise to a strain of white Amur tigers.

The white tigers Ranjit, Bharat, Priya and Bhim were all outcrossed, in some instances to more than one tiger. Bharat was bred to an unrelated orange tiger named Jack from the [[San Francisco Zoo]] and had an orange daughter named Kanchana.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tongren|first=Sally|title=To keep them alive|location=New York|publisher=Dembner Books: Distributed by Norton|year=1985|isbn=978-0934878661|url=https://archive.org/details/tokeepthemalivew0000tong}}</ref> Bharat and Priya were also bred with an unrelated orange tiger from [[Knoxville Zoo]], and Ranjit was bred to this tiger's sister, also from Knoxville Zoo.

Rajiv, Pretoria Zoo's white tiger, who was born in the Cincinnati Zoo, was also outcrossed and sired at least two litters of orange cubs at Pretoria Zoo. Outcrossing is not necessarily done with the intent of producing more white cubs by resuming inbreeding further down the line. Outcrossing is a way of bringing fresh blood into the white strain.

The first person to speak out against the displaying of white tigers was [[William G. Conway]], General Director of the New York Zoological Society, which later became known as the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] when he said, \"White tigers are freaks.  It's not the role of a zoo to show two headed calves and white tigers.\"  He warned AZA in 1983 of the harm to the zoo's credibility in catering to the public's fascination with freaks, but went unheeded until 2008 when AZA issued a request to their members to stop breeding white tigers and then later in July 2011 when the AZA formally adopted that stance as policy.

The white fur caused by a lack of the pigment [[pheomelanin]], which is found in Bengal tigers with orange color fur. When compared to Bengal tigers, the white Bengal tigers tend to grow faster and heavier than the orange Bengal tiger. They also tend to be somewhat bigger at birth, and as fully grown adults. White Bengal tigers are fully grown when they are 2\u20133 years of age. White male tigers reach weights of {{convert|200|to|230|kg|lb}} and can grow up to {{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} in length. As with all tigers, the white Bengal tiger\u2019s stripes are like fingerprints, with no two tigers having the same pattern. The stripes of the tiger are a pigmentation of the skin; if an individual were to be shaved, its distinctive coat pattern would still be visible.<ref name=\"animalcorner.co.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://www.animalcorner.co.uk/rainforests/bengalwhite.html |title=White Bengal Tiger |website=Animal Corner |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401075203/http://www.animalcorner.co.uk/rainforests/bengalwhite.html |archive-date=2008-04-01}}</ref>\n\nFor a white Bengal tiger to be born, both parents must carry the unusual gene for white colouring, which only happens naturally about once in 10,000 births.<ref name=\"animalcorner.co.uk\"/> Dark-striped white individuals are well-documented in the Bengal tiger subspecies (''Panthera tigris tigris'') as well as having been reported historically in several other subspecies.<ref name=\"animalcorner.co.uk\"/> Currently, several hundred white tigers are in captivity worldwide, with about one hundred being found in India. Their unique white color fur has made them popular in entertainment showcasing exotic animals, and at zoos.\n\n== Stripeless tigers ==\n[[File:Whitetigermirage.jpg|thumb|A tiger with almost no stripes at [[The Mirage]] in [[Las Vegas]], the [[United States]] of America]]\n\nAn additional genetic condition can result in near-complete absence of stripes, making the tiger almost pure white. One such specimen was exhibited at Exeter Change in England in 1820, and described by Georges Cuvier as \"A white variety of Tiger is sometimes seen, with the stripes very opaque, and not to be observed except in certain angles of light.\"<ref name=\"cuvier\">{{cite book |last=Cuvier |first=Georges |authorlink=Georges Cuvier |title=The Animal Kingdom they can grow to as tall as |publisher=G & C & H Carvill |year=1832}}</ref> Naturalist [[Richard Lydekker]] said that, \"a white tiger, in which the fur was of a creamy tint, with the usual stripes faintly visible in certain parts, was exhibited at the old menagerie at Exeter Change about the year 1820.\"<ref name=\"lydekker1\">{{cite book |author=Lydekker, R. |authorlink=Richard Lydekker |title=The Royal Natural History |url=https://archive.org/details/royalnaturalhist06lyde |publisher=Frederick Warne |year=1893}}</ref> Hamilton Smith said, \"A wholly white tiger, with the stripe-pattern visible only under reflected light, like the pattern of a white tabby cat, was exhibited in the Exeter Change Menagerie in 1820.\", and [[John George Wood]] stated that, \"a creamy white, with the ordinary tigerine stripes so faintly marked that they were only visible in certain lights.\" [[Edwin Henry Landseer]] also drew this tigress in 1824.\n\nThe modern strain of snow white tigers came from repeated brother\u2013sister matings of Bhim and Sumita at [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]]. The gene involved may have come from a [[Siberian tiger]], their part-Siberian ancestor Tony. Continued inbreeding appears to have caused a recessive gene for stripelessness to show up. About one fourth of Bhim and Sumita's offspring were stripeless. Their striped white offspring, which have been sold to zoos around the world, may also carry the stripeless gene. Because Tony's genome is present in many white tiger pedigrees, the gene may also be present in other captive white tigers. As a result, stripeless white tigers have appeared in zoos as far afield as the [[Czech Republic]] ([[Liberec#Zoo and botanical garden|Liberec]]), [[Spain]] and [[Mexico]]. Stage magicians [[Siegfried & Roy]] were the first to attempt to selectively breed tigers for stripelessness; they owned snow-white Bengal tigers taken from [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]] (Tsumura, Mantra, Mirage and Akbar-Kabul) and [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]] (Vishnu and Jahan), as well as a stripeless Siberian tiger called Apollo.<ref name=\"providing2007\">{{Cite news |title=Litter of white tigers debuts in Mexico |date=6 July 2007 |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19627911 |website=NBC News }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, a blue-eyed, stripeless white tiger was born in a wildlife refuge in [[Alicante]], [[Spain]].

Siamese cats and albinos of every species which have been studied all exhibit the same visual pathway abnormality found in white tigers. Siamese cats are also sometimes cross-eyed, as are some albino [[ferret]]s. The visual pathway abnormality was first documented in white tigers in the brain of a white tiger called Moni after he died, although his eyes were of normal alignment. The abnormality is that there is a disruption in the [[optic chiasm]]. The examination of Moni's brain suggested the disruption is less severe in white tigers than it is in Siamese cats. Because of the visual pathway abnormality, by which some [[optic nerve]]s are routed to the wrong side of the brain, white tigers have a problem with spatial orientation, and bump into things until they learn to compensate. Some tigers compensate by crossing their eyes. When the neurons pass from the retina to the brain and reach the optic chiasma, some cross and some do not, so that visual images are projected to the wrong hemisphere of the brain. White tigers cannot see as well as normal tigers and suffer from photophobia, like albinos.<ref name=\"Gorham\">Gorham, Mary Ellen, DVM. ''Genetic defects do little to mar beauty of India's rare white tigers''. March 1986</ref>\n\nOther genetic problems include shortened tendons of the forelegs, [[club foot]], kidney problems, arched or crooked backbone and twisted neck. Reduced fertility and miscarriages, noted by \"tiger man\" Kailash Sankhala in pure-Bengal white tigers, were attributed to [[inbreeding depression]].<ref name=\"sankhala1977\"/> A condition known as \"star-gazing\" (the head and neck are raised almost straight up, as if the affected animal is gazing at the stars), which is associated with inbreeding in big cats, has also been reported in white tigers.<ref name=\"Gorham\"/> Some white tigers born to North American lines have ''bulldog'' faces with a snub nose, jutting jaw, domed head and wide-set eyes with an indentation between the eyes. However, some of these traits may be linked to poor diet rather than inbreeding.\n\nThere was a {{convert|450|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} male cross-eyed white tiger at the [[Pana'ewa Rainforest Zoo]] in [[Hawaii]], which was donated to the zoo by [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] magician Dirk Arthur.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hilo Area Attractions |website=tripsavvy |date=12 December 2017 |url=https://www.tripsavvy.com/hilo-area-attractions-1532636 |author=Fischer, John |access-date=2018-05-25}}</ref> There is a picture of a white tiger which appears to be cross-eyed on just one side in Siegfried & Roy's book ''Mastering The Impossible''. A white tiger, named Scarlett O'Hara, who was Tony's sister, was cross-eyed only on the right side.\n\nA male tiger named 'Cheytan', a son of Bhim and Sumita who was born at the Cincinnati Zoo, died at the San Antonio Zoo in 1992, from anaesthesia complications during [[root canal therapy]]. It appears that white tigers also react strangely to anaesthesia. The best drug for immobilizing a tiger is CI 744, but a few tigers, white ones in particular, undergo a re-sedation effect 24\u201336 hours later.<ref>Bush, Mitchell; Phillips, Lindsay G.; & Montali, Richard J.

However, the infant mortality rate for white tigers is no higher than it is for normal orange tigers bred in captivity. Cincinnati Zoo director Ed Maruska said: \"We have not experienced premature death among our white tigers. Forty-two animals born in our collection are still alive. Mohan, a large white tiger, died just short of his 20th birthday, an enviable age for a male of any subspecies, since most males live shorter captive lives. Premature deaths in other collections may be artifacts of captive environmental conditions...in 52 births we had four stillbirths, one of which was an unexplained loss. We lost two additional cubs from viral pneumonia, which is not excessive. Without data from non-inbred tiger lines, it is difficult to determine whether this number is high or low with any degree of accuracy.\"<ref name=\"Maruska\"/> Ed Maruska also addressed the issue of deformities: \"Other than a case of hip dysplasia that occurred in a male white tiger, we have not encountered any other body deformities or any physiological or neurological disorders. Some of these reported maladies in mutant tigers in other collections may be a direct result of inbreeding or improper rearing management of tigers generally.\"<ref name=\"Maruska\"/>\n\n== Inbreeding and outcrossing == <!-- This section is linked from [[Cat]] -->\n[[File:White Tiger 6 (3865790598).jpg|thumb|A captive tiger in [[Birmingham]], the [[United Kingdom]]]]\n[[File:Siberian Tiger, Yerevan Zoo (2).jpg|thumb|A captive tiger in [[Yerevan Zoo]], [[Armenia]]]]\nBecause of the extreme rarity of the white tiger allele in the wild,<ref name=\"sankhala1977\"/> the breeding pool was limited to the small number of white tigers in captivity.

A white Amur tiger may have been born at Center Hill and has given rise to a strain of white Amur tigers. A man named Robert Baudy realized that his tigers had white genes when a tiger he sold to [[Marwell Wildlife|Marwell Zoo]] in England developed white spots, and bred them accordingly.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mutant Big Cats-White Tiger (Page 2) |url=http://www.messybeast.com/genetics/tigers-white2.htm |website=Hybrid and Mutant Animals}}</ref> The Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa Bay had four of these white Amur tigers, descended from Robert Baudy's stock.\n\nIt has also been possible to expand the white-gene pool by [[outcrossing]] white tigers with unrelated orange tigers and then using the cubs to produce more white tigers. The white tigers Ranjit, Bharat, Priya and Bhim were all outcrossed, in some instances to more than one tiger. Bharat was bred to an unrelated orange tiger named Jack from the [[San Francisco Zoo]] and had an orange daughter named Kanchana.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tongren|first=Sally|title=To keep them alive|location=New York|publisher=Dembner Books: Distributed by Norton|year=1985|isbn=978-0934878661|url=https://archive.org/details/tokeepthemalivew0000tong}}</ref> Bharat and Priya were also bred with an unrelated orange tiger from [[Knoxville Zoo]], and Ranjit was bred to this tiger's sister, also from Knoxville Zoo. Bhim fathered several litters with an unrelated orange tigress named Kimanthi at the Cincinnati Zoo. ankam Ranjeeth had several mates at the Omaha Zoo.<ref name=\"Iverson\"/>\n\nThe last descendants of [[Bristol Zoo]]'s white tigers were a group of orange tigers from outcrosses which were bought by a Pakistani senator and shipped to Pakistan. Rajiv, Pretoria Zoo's white tiger, who was born in the Cincinnati Zoo, was also outcrossed and sired at least two litters of orange cubs at Pretoria Zoo. Outcrossing is not necessarily done with the intent of producing more white cubs by resuming inbreeding further down the line. Outcrossing is a way of bringing fresh blood into the white strain. The New Delhi Zoo loaned out white tigers to some of India's better zoos for outcrossing, and the government had to impose a [[Whip (politics)|whip]] to force zoos to return either the white tigers or their orange offspring.\n\n[[File:WhiteTiger25.jpg|thumb|left|A Bengal tiger at the [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]]]]\nSiegfried & Roy performed at least one outcross.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|last=Fischbacher|first=Siegfried|author2=Horn, Roy Uwe Ludwig|author3=Tapert, Annette|title=Siegfried and Roy: mastering the impossible|isbn=978-0688105518|location=New York|publisher=W.

The first person to speak out against the displaying of white tigers was [[William G. Conway]], General Director of the New York Zoological Society, which later became known as the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] when he said, \"White tigers are freaks.  It's not the role of a zoo to show two headed calves and white tigers.\"  He warned AZA in 1983 of the harm to the zoo's credibility in catering to the public's fascination with freaks, but went unheeded until 2008 when AZA issued a request to their members to stop breeding white tigers and then later in July 2011 when the AZA formally adopted that stance as policy.  Conway was attacked by Ed Maruska of the Cincinnati Zoo for his observation, but in the end Conway's belief was validated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welfare and Conservation Implications of Intentional Breeding for the Expression of Rare Recessive Alleles|url=http://bigcatrescue.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/AZAbansBreedingWhiteTigersLions2011from2008.pdf|publisher=Association of Zoos & Aquariums|date=June 2011|accessdate=21 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[File:Panthera tigris tigris, Liberec.jpg|thumb|A White tiger in [[Liberec]] Zoo]]\nWhite tigers appear frequently in literature, video games, television, and comic books.

A [[superhero]] named White Tiger appears in \"The Justice Friends\" in ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]''. A white tiger named White Blaze is frequently shown in the anime ''[[Ronin Warriors]]''. Tigatron from the [[animated]] TV series ''[[Transformers: Beast Wars]]'' is based on the white tiger.

CBeebies Radio, however, has continued as a feature on the channel's website since 2013, and as a station on [[BBC Sounds]] broadcasting from 6am to 10pm. A magazine called ''CBeebies Weekly'' (now called CBeebies Magazine) was first published in 2006.\n\nSince 27 March 2013, CBeebies has been carried by the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]], sharing a channel with BFBS Extra.<ref>[http://www.bfbs.com/tv/node/823536 BFBS TV IS CHANGING] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017201105/http://www.bfbs.com/tv/node/823536 |date=17 October 2012 }}</ref> The UK channel is also available in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n==International and Non-English versions==\n[[BBC Studios]] owns and operates the international CBeebies feeds, with most of them operating on a 24-hour schedule.\n\nThe first international launch for the CBeebies channel was in India in May 2007, although the channel was withdrawn at the end of November 2012 due to \"commercial considerations\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/11/02/bbc-pulls-plug-on-two-india-channels/|title=BBC Pulls Plug on Two India Channels|author=Will Davies|work=WSJ}}</ref>.  The Polish CBeebies channel was launched in December 2007, while feeds in [[Latin America]], Asia, South Africa and Australia were launched in 2008.\nIn March 2011, the [[Video on demand|on demand]] version of the network was launched in the US and is available on [[Xfinity|Xfinity]].\n\nOn 13 May 2011, CBeebies was launched as a programme block on the channel [[BBC Kids]] in Canada, available on weekdays between 9:00&nbsp;am and 3:00&nbsp;pm. It is serving a similar schedule to the main channel. The block ceased alongside its main channel on 31 December 2018, with some programmes moving to [[Knowledge Network]].\n\nIn April 2015, BBC Worldwide signed with South Korean broadcaster [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] and Japanese broadcaster [[Kids Station]] to launch CBeebies blocks on both channels.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldwide/2015/cbeebies-programming-blocks</ref>\n\nIn April 2016, a channel for the [[MENA]] region was launched.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, CBeebies Asia was launched in Taiwan, replacing [[BBC Entertainment]]. CBeebies Asia has already launched in Hong Kong, South Korea, Myanmar, the Philippines, Mongolia, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} On 13 April 2017, the localised CBeebies feed for Latin America ceased transmissions along with [[BBC Earth]] and BBC Entertainment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nOn 5 April 2018, a feed was launched on [[Digiturk]] in Turkey.\n\nIn September 2018 as part of a branding strategy, the unbranded 2 hour children's block on BBC Alba was split into CBeebies Alba and [[CBBC (TV channel)#CBBC_Alba|CBBC Alba]], with the former airing during the first hour and the latter airing during the second hour. This block features its own presentation, presenters and shows all dubbed into [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nOn 1 December 2019, The Australian feed launched in New Zealand on [[Sky (New Zealand)|Sky]].\n\n==Management==\nIn the UK, CBeebies is operated by the BBC Children's division and part of [[BBC North]]. The division is also responsible for CBBC and overall strategic responsibility for all of the BBC's domestic services for children rests with the Director of Children's, Alice Webb (since 2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/alice-webb|title=BBC - Alice Webb named as Director, BBC Children's - Media Centre|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The direction of the domestic CBeebies channel itself rested with [[Kay Benbow]], the last Controller of the channel commissioning all CBeebies content across BBC television, online, interactive TV, and radio.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography \u2013 Kay Benbow|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/controllers/kay_benbow.shtml|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref> She took over from the first controller [[Michael Carrington (television executive)|Michael Carrington]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/27/cbeebies-michael-carrington-bbc-turner |title=Carrington Leaves BBC |date=27 January 2010|work= by Mark Sweney, guardian.co.uk }}</ref> In 2017 it was announced that the CBeebies controller post will close in December 2017 and all content for the CBeebies brand would be commissioned by a new, pan BBC Children's role entitled Head of Content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tbivision.com/news/2017/07/benbow-exiting-bbc-childrens-shake/776711/|title=Benbow exiting in BBC Children's shake-up - TBI Vision - Page 776711|website=tbivision.com}}</ref>\n\nInternationally, CBeebies is owned by [[BBC Studios]], who operate the brand.\n\n==Presentation==\nThe links between programmes on CBeebies are primarily achieved through the use of [[Continuity (broadcasting)|in-vision continuity]], using presenters to interact with the children. In the UK, links are pre-recorded rather than broadcast live, as is the case on sister channel [[CBBC]]. They were originally pre-recorded from studio TC0 at [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]] in London, however, moved out in 2008 to [[Teddington Studios]], and returned briefly in 2010. From September 2011, the links have been based at the BBC's Northern base at [[Dock10 (television facility)|Dock10]], [[MediaCityUK]], following the move of the BBC Children's department there. International variants feature broadcast links produced either in the corresponding country or from a central base.\n\n===Logo and idents===\n{{main|CBBC idents}}\n\n{{see also|History of BBC television idents}}\n\n===Presenters===\n\nAs well as hosting some of the shows, a number of presenters fill the gaps between the CBeebies shows, speaking directly to the child, leading activities based on a topic from the CBeebies website, showing viewers' birthday cards, and introducing the shows. Many of the presenters have histories as characters on other services or on children's programmes.\n\nIn the UK, presenters seen on the channel and the stranded service are:\n* [[Andy Day]] (2007\u2013present)\n* [[Katy Ashworth]] (2011\u2013present)\n* [[Cat Sandion]] (2013\u2013present)\n*   Rebecca Keatley (2014\u2013present)\n*   Ben Cajee (2015\u2013present)\n* [[Warrick Brownlow-Pike|Dodge T.

Includes programmes such as ''[[Something Special (TV series)|Something Special]]'', ''[[Baby Jake]]'', ''[[Twirlywoos]]'', ''[[Raa Raa the Noisy Lion]]'', ''[[Postman Pat]]'', ''[[Bing (TV series)|Bing]]'', ''[[Hey Duggee]]'', ''[[Tinpo]]'', ''[[Biggleton]]'', ''[[Justin's House]]'', ''[[Octonauts]]'' and ''[[Go Jetters]]''. \n* '''Discover and Do''' \u2013 Late morning and early afternoon, weekdays between 9:00&nbsp;am and 3:00&nbsp;pm. The strand is aimed at young children who would not be attending school or pre-school. It often contains programmes that give a learning opportunity to viewers, such as ''[[Show Me Show Me]]'', ''[[Let's Play (TV series)|Let's Play]], ''[[Andy's Baby Animals]]'', ''[[Teletubbies]]'', ''[[My First]]'', ''[[Alphablocks]]'', ''[[Numberblocks]]'' & ''[[Yakka Dee]]''. The hour between 12:00&nbsp;pm and 1:00&nbsp;pm is branded as Lunch Time and features shows such as ''[[My World Kitchen]]'', ''[[Molly and Mack]]'' & [[Patchwork Pals]].\n* '''Big Fun Time''' \u2013 Late afternoon weekdays between 3:00&nbsp;pm and 5:45&nbsp;pm. This strand is notable for aiming at the higher end of its remit, airing programming for children who have recently returned from school. Programmes include ''[[Swashbuckle]]'', ''[[Do You Know? (TV series)|Do You Know?]]'', ''[[Andy's Safari Adventures]]'', ''[[Apple Tree House]]'', ''[[Catie's Amazing Machines]]'', ''[[Bitz & Bob]]'', ''[[Waffle the Wonder Dog]]'' & ''[[Gigglebiz]]''. \n* '''Bedtime''' \u2013 The final hour and 15 minutes of CBeebies broadcasting between 5:45&nbsp;pm and 7:00&nbsp;pm. The original stranded section of the channel (and the only to still air to this day), Bedtime helps to prepare children for bed and features calm-natured programming. Programmes include ''[[Clangers]]'',  ''[[Moon & Me]]'',  ''[[Charlie and Lola (TV series)|Charlie and Lola]]'', ''[[Tee and Mo]]'' and ''[[In the Night Garden...]]'' Story-telling is often told during the programmes. The final programme is always the ''Bedtime Stories'' slot (see below) and is followed by a final song, \"The Time Has Come to Say Goodnight\", before the channel closes for the day and [[BBC Four]] starts up. CBeebies Bedtime was renamed from Bedtime Hour as of 4 February 2019.\n\nWhen these segments were initially introduced, each segment featured its own presenting team and set, with [[Chris Jarvis (presenter)|Chris Jarvis]] and [[Pui Fan Lee]] ([[Alex Winters]] and [[Cerrie Burnell]] after they left in January 2009) presenting '''Discover and Do''' in the CBeebies \"living room\"; '''Lunch Time''' in the \"kitchen\"; '''Bedtime Hour''' in the \"bedroom\"; [[Sidney Sloane]] (plus [[Andy Day]] when he joined the channel later in 2007) presenting '''Get, Set, Go!''' in the \"living room\" and '''Big Fun Time''' in the \"garage\". However, since moving production to Manchester this is no longer the case, with the exception of '''Bedtime Hour''' which is presented from the area nearest the house's bed.\n\n[[File:Bedtime Hour.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|The Bedtime Hour on-screen ident from March 2003 to March 2016.]]\n\n===Storytimes===\nWhile the lunchtime story is usually read by one of the regular presenters, the final show of each day, the ''Bedtime Story'' (known as ''St\u00f2iridh'' in Gaelic) is read by a guest storyteller, including well known actors, comedians, and past presenters of BBC children's television (Like [[Derek Jacobi|Sir Derek Jacobi]] who Narrated all 100 episodes of 2007's ''[[In the Night Garden...]]'' when he appeared in April 2018 and again in June 2018).

It is aimed at young children aged 3 + and was launched on 11 February 2002. It manages an international network supported by subscription services.\n\n==History==\n===Launch===\nThe CBeebies channel launched on 11 February 2002, with the first show to air being ''[[Teletubbies]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/feb/11/broadcasting.bbc|title=What Auntie did next|author=Maggie Brown|date=11 February 2002|access-date=4 April 2016|work=The Guardian}}</ref> The domestic CBeebies channel broadcasts from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 7:00&nbsp;pm each day<ref>{{cite web|title=CBeebies - what we do|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/tv/articles/cbeebies|publisher=BBC|access-date=4 April 2016}}</ref>\u2013 a result of the channel sharing [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] with the channel [[BBC Four]] on the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] platform.

CBeebies Radio, however, has continued as a feature on the channel's website since 2013, and as a station on [[BBC Sounds]] broadcasting from 6am to 10pm. A magazine called ''CBeebies Weekly'' (now called CBeebies Magazine) was first published in 2006.\n\nSince 27 March 2013, CBeebies has been carried by the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]], sharing a channel with BFBS Extra.<ref>[http://www.bfbs.com/tv/node/823536 BFBS TV IS CHANGING] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017201105/http://www.bfbs.com/tv/node/823536 |date=17 October 2012 }}</ref> The UK channel is also available in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n==International and Non-English versions==\n[[BBC Studios]] owns and operates the international CBeebies feeds, with most of them operating on a 24-hour schedule.\n\nThe first international launch for the CBeebies channel was in India in May 2007, although the channel was withdrawn at the end of November 2012 due to \"commercial considerations\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/11/02/bbc-pulls-plug-on-two-india-channels/|title=BBC Pulls Plug on Two India Channels|author=Will Davies|work=WSJ}}</ref>.  The Polish CBeebies channel was launched in December 2007, while feeds in [[Latin America]], Asia, South Africa and Australia were launched in 2008.\nIn March 2011, the [[Video on demand|on demand]] version of the network was launched in the US and is available on [[Xfinity|Xfinity]].\n\nOn 13 May 2011, CBeebies was launched as a programme block on the channel [[BBC Kids]] in Canada, available on weekdays between 9:00&nbsp;am and 3:00&nbsp;pm. It is serving a similar schedule to the main channel. The block ceased alongside its main channel on 31 December 2018, with some programmes moving to [[Knowledge Network]].\n\nIn April 2015, BBC Worldwide signed with South Korean broadcaster [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] and Japanese broadcaster [[Kids Station]] to launch CBeebies blocks on both channels.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldwide/2015/cbeebies-programming-blocks</ref>\n\nIn April 2016, a channel for the [[MENA]] region was launched.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, CBeebies Asia was launched in Taiwan, replacing [[BBC Entertainment]]. CBeebies Asia has already launched in Hong Kong, South Korea, Myanmar, the Philippines, Mongolia, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} On 13 April 2017, the localised CBeebies feed for Latin America ceased transmissions along with [[BBC Earth]] and BBC Entertainment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nOn 5 April 2018, a feed was launched on [[Digiturk]] in Turkey.\n\nIn September 2018 as part of a branding strategy, the unbranded 2 hour children's block on BBC Alba was split into CBeebies Alba and [[CBBC (TV channel)#CBBC_Alba|CBBC Alba]], with the former airing during the first hour and the latter airing during the second hour. This block features its own presentation, presenters and shows all dubbed into [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nOn 1 December 2019, The Australian feed launched in New Zealand on [[Sky (New Zealand)|Sky]].\n\n==Management==\nIn the UK, CBeebies is operated by the BBC Children's division and part of [[BBC North]]. The division is also responsible for CBBC and overall strategic responsibility for all of the BBC's domestic services for children rests with the Director of Children's, Alice Webb (since 2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/alice-webb|title=BBC - Alice Webb named as Director, BBC Children's - Media Centre|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The direction of the domestic CBeebies channel itself rested with [[Kay Benbow]], the last Controller of the channel commissioning all CBeebies content across BBC television, online, interactive TV, and radio.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography \u2013 Kay Benbow|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/controllers/kay_benbow.shtml|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref> She took over from the first controller [[Michael Carrington (television executive)|Michael Carrington]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/27/cbeebies-michael-carrington-bbc-turner |title=Carrington Leaves BBC |date=27 January 2010|work= by Mark Sweney, guardian.co.uk }}</ref> In 2017 it was announced that the CBeebies controller post will close in December 2017 and all content for the CBeebies brand would be commissioned by a new, pan BBC Children's role entitled Head of Content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tbivision.com/news/2017/07/benbow-exiting-bbc-childrens-shake/776711/|title=Benbow exiting in BBC Children's shake-up - TBI Vision - Page 776711|website=tbivision.com}}</ref>\n\nInternationally, CBeebies is owned by [[BBC Studios]], who operate the brand.\n\n==Presentation==\nThe links between programmes on CBeebies are primarily achieved through the use of [[Continuity (broadcasting)|in-vision continuity]], using presenters to interact with the children. In the UK, links are pre-recorded rather than broadcast live, as is the case on sister channel [[CBBC]]. They were originally pre-recorded from studio TC0 at [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]] in London, however, moved out in 2008 to [[Teddington Studios]], and returned briefly in 2010. From September 2011, the links have been based at the BBC's Northern base at [[Dock10 (television facility)|Dock10]], [[MediaCityUK]], following the move of the BBC Children's department there. International variants feature broadcast links produced either in the corresponding country or from a central base.\n\n===Logo and idents===\n{{main|CBBC idents}}\n\n{{see also|History of BBC television idents}}\n\n===Presenters===\n\nAs well as hosting some of the shows, a number of presenters fill the gaps between the CBeebies shows, speaking directly to the child, leading activities based on a topic from the CBeebies website, showing viewers' birthday cards, and introducing the shows. Many of the presenters have histories as characters on other services or on children's programmes.\n\nIn the UK, presenters seen on the channel and the stranded service are:\n* [[Andy Day]] (2007\u2013present)\n* [[Katy Ashworth]] (2011\u2013present)\n* [[Cat Sandion]] (2013\u2013present)\n*   Rebecca Keatley (2014\u2013present)\n*   Ben Cajee (2015\u2013present)\n* [[Warrick Brownlow-Pike|Dodge T.

Each was given a core theme (for instance Sid's segment included \"building and making\" programmes such as ''[[Bob the Builder]]'', Sue's included arts and crafts theme programmes and so on).

Includes programmes such as ''[[Something Special (TV series)|Something Special]]'', ''[[Baby Jake]]'', ''[[Twirlywoos]]'', ''[[Raa Raa the Noisy Lion]]'', ''[[Postman Pat]]'', ''[[Bing (TV series)|Bing]]'', ''[[Hey Duggee]]'', ''[[Tinpo]]'', ''[[Biggleton]]'', ''[[Justin's House]]'', ''[[Octonauts]]'' and ''[[Go Jetters]]''. \n* '''Discover and Do''' \u2013 Late morning and early afternoon, weekdays between 9:00&nbsp;am and 3:00&nbsp;pm. The strand is aimed at young children who would not be attending school or pre-school. It often contains programmes that give a learning opportunity to viewers, such as ''[[Show Me Show Me]]'', ''[[Let's Play (TV series)|Let's Play]], ''[[Andy's Baby Animals]]'', ''[[Teletubbies]]'', ''[[My First]]'', ''[[Alphablocks]]'', ''[[Numberblocks]]'' & ''[[Yakka Dee]]''. The hour between 12:00&nbsp;pm and 1:00&nbsp;pm is branded as Lunch Time and features shows such as ''[[My World Kitchen]]'', ''[[Molly and Mack]]'' & [[Patchwork Pals]].\n* '''Big Fun Time''' \u2013 Late afternoon weekdays between 3:00&nbsp;pm and 5:45&nbsp;pm. This strand is notable for aiming at the higher end of its remit, airing programming for children who have recently returned from school. Programmes include ''[[Swashbuckle]]'', ''[[Do You Know? (TV series)|Do You Know?]]'', ''[[Andy's Safari Adventures]]'', ''[[Apple Tree House]]'', ''[[Catie's Amazing Machines]]'', ''[[Bitz & Bob]]'', ''[[Waffle the Wonder Dog]]'' & ''[[Gigglebiz]]''. \n* '''Bedtime''' \u2013 The final hour and 15 minutes of CBeebies broadcasting between 5:45&nbsp;pm and 7:00&nbsp;pm. The original stranded section of the channel (and the only to still air to this day), Bedtime helps to prepare children for bed and features calm-natured programming. Programmes include ''[[Clangers]]'',  ''[[Moon & Me]]'',  ''[[Charlie and Lola (TV series)|Charlie and Lola]]'', ''[[Tee and Mo]]'' and ''[[In the Night Garden...]]'' Story-telling is often told during the programmes. The final programme is always the ''Bedtime Stories'' slot (see below) and is followed by a final song, \"The Time Has Come to Say Goodnight\", before the channel closes for the day and [[BBC Four]] starts up. CBeebies Bedtime was renamed from Bedtime Hour as of 4 February 2019.\n\nWhen these segments were initially introduced, each segment featured its own presenting team and set, with [[Chris Jarvis (presenter)|Chris Jarvis]] and [[Pui Fan Lee]] ([[Alex Winters]] and [[Cerrie Burnell]] after they left in January 2009) presenting '''Discover and Do''' in the CBeebies \"living room\"; '''Lunch Time''' in the \"kitchen\"; '''Bedtime Hour''' in the \"bedroom\"; [[Sidney Sloane]] (plus [[Andy Day]] when he joined the channel later in 2007) presenting '''Get, Set, Go!''' in the \"living room\" and '''Big Fun Time''' in the \"garage\". However, since moving production to Manchester this is no longer the case, with the exception of '''Bedtime Hour''' which is presented from the area nearest the house's bed.\n\n[[File:Bedtime Hour.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|The Bedtime Hour on-screen ident from March 2003 to March 2016.]]\n\n===Storytimes===\nWhile the lunchtime story is usually read by one of the regular presenters, the final show of each day, the ''Bedtime Story'' (known as ''St\u00f2iridh'' in Gaelic) is read by a guest storyteller, including well known actors, comedians, and past presenters of BBC children's television (Like [[Derek Jacobi|Sir Derek Jacobi]] who Narrated all 100 episodes of 2007's ''[[In the Night Garden...]]'' when he appeared in April 2018 and again in June 2018).
