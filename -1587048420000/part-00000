AD 1460, makes a detailed account for the Creation Era. Although unrefined in style, the history of Doukas is both judicious and trustworthy, and it is the most valuable source for the closing years of the Byzantine empire.\n\n<blockquote>From Adam, the first man created by God, to Noah, at whose time the flood took place, there were ten generations. The first, which was from God, was that of Adam. The second, after 230 years, was that of Seth begotten of Adam. The third, 205 years after Seth, was that of [[Enos (Bible)|Enos]] begotten of Seth. The fourth, 190 years after Enos, was that of Kainan begotten of Enos. The fifth, 170 years after Kainan, was that of [[Mahalalel|Mahaleel]] begotten of Kainan. The sixth, 165 years after Mahaleel, was that of Jared begotten of Mahaleel. The seventh, 162 years after Jared, was that of Enoch begotten of Jared. The eighth, 165 years after Enoch, was that of Methuselah begotten of Enoch. The ninth, 167 years after Methuselah, was that of Lamech begotten of Methuselah. The tenth, 188 years after Lamech, was that of Noah. Noah was 600 years old when the flood of water came upon the earth. Thus 2242 years may be counted from Adam to the flood.\n\nThere are also ten generations from the flood to Abraham numbering 1121 years. Abraham was seventy-five years old when he moved to the land of Canaan from Mesopotamia, and having resided there twenty-five years he begat [[Isaac]]. Isaac begat two sons, Esau and Jacob. When Jacob was 130 years old he went to Egypt with his twelve sons and grandchildren, seventy-five in number. And Abraham with his offspring dwelt in the land of Canaan 433 years, and having multiplied they numbered twelve tribes; a multitude of 600,000 were reckoned from the twelve sons of Jacob whose names are as follows: Ruben, Symeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Dan, Joseph, and Benjamin.\n\nThe descendants of Levi were Moses and Aaron; the latter was the first of the priesthood while Moses was appointed to govern. In the eightieth year of his life, he walked through the Red Sea and led his people out of Egypt. This Moses flourished in the time of Inachos [son of Oceanus and King of Argos] who was the first [Greek] king to reign. Thus the Jews are more ancient than the Greeks.\n\nRemaining in the wilderness forty years they were governed for twenty-five years by Joshua, son of Nun, and by the Judges for 454 years to the reign of Saul, the first king installed by them. During the first year of his reign, the great David was born. Thus from Abraham to David fourteen generations are numbered for a total of 1024 years. From David to the deportation to Babylon [586 BC] there are fourteen generations totaling 609 years. From the Babylonian Captivity to Christ there are fourteen generations totaling 504 years.\n\nBy the sequence of Numbers we calculate the number of 5,500 years from the time of the first Adam to Christ.<ref>Doukas (c. 1460).

Kyriake was seen as the day of resurrection of Christ and as both the first and eighth day of the week, in the same way that [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] was the [[Alpha and Omega|alpha and omega]] of the cosmos, existing both before and after time. The second day of the week recognized [[angels]], \"the secondary luminaries as the first reflections of the primal outpouring of light\", just as the sun and the moon had been observed during the Roman week. [[John the Forerunner|John the Baptist]], the forerunner (Prodromos) of Christ, was honored on the third day. Both the second and third days were viewed as occasions for penitence. The fourth and sixth days were dedicated to the [[Cross]]. The fourth day to the [[Theotokos]] and her mourning of the loss of her son and the sixth day (the Paraskeue) as the day of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] of the Lord, with holy songs sung and fasting in remembrance of these events. [[St. Nicholas]] was honored on the fifth day of the week, while the Sabatton day was set aside for the saints and all the deceased faithful.

The physical-scientific side of the origins of mankind, though important, is really quite secondary in significance to the Church's message. The central image of [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] as [[God]]'s image and likeness, who also represents fallen and sinful humanity, and the new Adam, [[Jesus Christ]], who is the \"beginning\", the first-born of the dead (Colossians 1:18) and the \"[[First Fruits#Christian perspective|first-fruits]]\" of those who were dead, and are now alive (1 Corinthians 15:20\u201323), is what is really important.<ref>Fr.

Light & Life Publishing, Minneapolis, 1988. pp.&nbsp;88,91.</ref>\n\n* [[Protopresbyter]] Dr. Doru Costache affirms in ''\"The Orthodox Doctrine of Creation in the Age of Science\"'' (2019), that Orthodox Christianity has never issued a dogma of creation that establishes in normative terms its relevant convictions, even though it does possess a strong sense of the cosmos, developing a theology of the world. While not specifically discussing the chronology of the Byzantine Calendar as such, he explains that the Orthodox doctrine of creation is largely compatible with the contemporary scientific representation of reality, also suggesting that the Christian doctrine of creation should preserve its capacity to be redrafted when the cultural environment changes. He states that [[Creation science|modern creationism]] has originated in [[Social environment|milieus]] that are foreign to the Orthodox worldview, and there is no record of a wholesale rejection of culture in the [[Patristics|patristic tradition]]. Rather, from the outset of its historical emergence, Orthodox theology has traditionally interacted with the available sciences and the cultural frameworks of the past. The ongoing contextualization, particularly in relation to scientific culture, remained the norm for most of the Byzantine era, which was a time of prodigious research, cultural cross pollination, and innovation. In contrast with contemporary creationism, which construes a [[Young Earth creationism|recently made world]], molded exclusively by God out of an [[Chemically inert|inert matter]] deprived of natural energy and capacity for movement, the Orthodox theology of creation traditionally advocates a distinction between the divine acts of creation, and organization. He argues that the supernaturalist worldview of creationism was discarded indirectly by the Orthodox Church in the seventh century as [[monoenergism]]. Thus he aligns with the view of an expanding universe whose history began billions of years ago, a universe characterized by homogeneity, movement, change, and complexity.<ref>Costache, Doru.

However, if we look instead at the problem from the point of view of [[Church_Fathers#Greek_Fathers|Greek patristic thought]], we see a very different way of fitting evolution into Christian belief. By referring to the writings of the Church Fathers including [[Gregory of Nyssa]] and [[Gregory of Nazianzus|Gregory the Theologian]], he states that what matters most is not the <em>process</em> of creation, but rather how the Church Fathers understood its <em>result</em>. The basic premise described is that God did not create humans in their present bodily condition; but rather prelapsarian human beings (i.e. before the [[Fall of man]]) had spiritual bodies and lived a kind of angelic life; humans entered the organismic life and entered 'time' itself only after the Fall, which happened before the beginning of the empirically known universe. Therefore it is entirely reasonable to suppose that evolution itself started in the fallen world; and Theistic evolutionists have no warrant to equate the earliest members of Homo sapiens with those humans who were created by God on the sixth day for life in paradise. The [[Genesis creation narrative|six days of creation]] and other events preceding the expulsion from Paradise simply lie beyond what science can discover. So \"[[Book of Genesis|Moses's Book]]\" possesses its own truth, independent of what scientists can say about the observable world. There can be no reason for conflict.<ref name=KHRAMOV/>\n\n* Professor Fr. Arsenius John Baptist Vuibert ([[Society of Saint-Sulpice|S.S.]]), a 19th-century historian, observed that [[Chronology of the Bible|Biblical Chronologies]] are uncertain due to discrepancies in the figures in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and other methodological factors, accounting for hundreds of different chronologies being assigned by historians.

These are calculated from the genealogies in two versions of the Bible, with most of the difference arising from two versions of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. The older dates of the [[Church Fathers]] in the Byzantine Era and in its precursor, the [[Byzantine calendar#Alexandrian Era|Alexandrian Era]], are based on the Greek [[Septuagint]]. The later dates of the [[Ussher chronology]] and the [[Hebrew Calendar#Epoch year|Hebrew Calendar]] are based on the Hebrew [[Masoretic Text]].\n\nThe [[Church Fathers|Fathers]] were well aware of the discrepancy of some hundreds of years between the Greek and Hebrew [[Old Testament]] chronology,{{#tag:ref|Note that according to Wacholder, [[Josephus|Josephus']] chronology for the antediluvian period (pre-flood) conforms with the [[Septuagint|LXX]], but for the [[Noachite]]s (post-flood) he used the Hebrew text. He chose this method to resolve the problem of the two chronological systems.<ref>Ben Zion Wacholder. \"Biblical Chronology in the Hellenistic World Chronicles\". in ''The Harvard Theological Review'', Vol.61, No.3 (Jul., 1968).</ref>|group=note}} and it did not bother them; they did not quibble over years or worry that the standard calendar was precise \"to the very year\"; it is sufficient that what is involved is beyond any doubt a matter of some few thousands of years, involving the lifetimes of specific men, and it can in no way be interpreted as millions of years or whole ages and races of men.<ref>Fr. [[Seraphim Rose]]. ''GENESIS, CREATION and EARLY MAN: The Orthodox Christian Vision''. St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood, Platina, California, 2000. pp.&nbsp;602\u2013603.</ref>\n\nTo this day, traditional Orthodox Christians will use the Byzantine calculation of the ''World Era'' in conjunction with the [[Anno Domini]] (AD) year. Both dates appear on Orthodox cornerstones, ecclesiastical calendars and formal documents. The ecclesiastical new year is still observed on September 1 (or on the Gregorian Calendar's September 14 for those churches which follow the [[Julian Calendar]]). September 2019 marked the beginning of the year 7528 of this era.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Book of Genesis]]\n* [[Byzantine time]]\n* [[Chronology of the Bible]]\n* [[Dating creation]]\n* [[Ex nihilo]]\n* [[Hexameron]]\n\n'''Other Judeo-Christian eras'''\n* [[Coptic calendar]] <small>(Note that the '''\"''Alexandrian Era''\"''' (March 25, 5493 BC), is totally distinct from the Coptic \"Alexandrian Calendar\", which is derived from the ancient [[Egyptian calendar]] and based on another era, the ''' ''Era of the Martyrs'' ''' (August 29, 284).)</small>\n* [[Enoch calendar]]\n* [[Ethiopian calendar]] <small>(Derived from the Coptic \"Alexandrian Calendar\", and based on the ''' ''Incarnation Era'' ''' (August 29, AD 8).)</small>\n* [[Hebrew calendar]]\n* [[Ussher chronology]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web | url = https://oca.org/fs/icons-of-church-year | title = Main feasts and commemorations | website = Orthodox Church of America | archive-url = https://archive.today/20181009215353/https://oca.org/fs/icons-of-church-year# | archive-date = 2018-10-09 | url-status=live | access-date = 2018-10-09 | df =  }}\n* [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Labyrinth/2398/bginfo/trade/time.html&date=2009-10-25+11:27:32 Byzantine ways of reckoning time]\n* [http://www.smso.net/Calendar_era#Christian_era Calendar Era: Late Antiquity and Middle Ages: Christian era] at SMSO Encyclopedia (''Saudi Medical Site Online'').\n* Howlett, J.

AD 1460, makes a detailed account for the Creation Era. Although unrefined in style, the history of Doukas is both judicious and trustworthy, and it is the most valuable source for the closing years of the Byzantine empire.\n\n<blockquote>From Adam, the first man created by God, to Noah, at whose time the flood took place, there were ten generations. The first, which was from God, was that of Adam. The second, after 230 years, was that of Seth begotten of Adam. The third, 205 years after Seth, was that of [[Enos (Bible)|Enos]] begotten of Seth. The fourth, 190 years after Enos, was that of Kainan begotten of Enos. The fifth, 170 years after Kainan, was that of [[Mahalalel|Mahaleel]] begotten of Kainan. The sixth, 165 years after Mahaleel, was that of Jared begotten of Mahaleel. The seventh, 162 years after Jared, was that of Enoch begotten of Jared. The eighth, 165 years after Enoch, was that of Methuselah begotten of Enoch. The ninth, 167 years after Methuselah, was that of Lamech begotten of Methuselah. The tenth, 188 years after Lamech, was that of Noah. Noah was 600 years old when the flood of water came upon the earth. Thus 2242 years may be counted from Adam to the flood.\n\nThere are also ten generations from the flood to Abraham numbering 1121 years. Abraham was seventy-five years old when he moved to the land of Canaan from Mesopotamia, and having resided there twenty-five years he begat [[Isaac]]. Isaac begat two sons, Esau and Jacob. When Jacob was 130 years old he went to Egypt with his twelve sons and grandchildren, seventy-five in number. And Abraham with his offspring dwelt in the land of Canaan 433 years, and having multiplied they numbered twelve tribes; a multitude of 600,000 were reckoned from the twelve sons of Jacob whose names are as follows: Ruben, Symeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Dan, Joseph, and Benjamin.\n\nThe descendants of Levi were Moses and Aaron; the latter was the first of the priesthood while Moses was appointed to govern. In the eightieth year of his life, he walked through the Red Sea and led his people out of Egypt. This Moses flourished in the time of Inachos [son of Oceanus and King of Argos] who was the first [Greek] king to reign. Thus the Jews are more ancient than the Greeks.\n\nRemaining in the wilderness forty years they were governed for twenty-five years by Joshua, son of Nun, and by the Judges for 454 years to the reign of Saul, the first king installed by them. During the first year of his reign, the great David was born. Thus from Abraham to David fourteen generations are numbered for a total of 1024 years. From David to the deportation to Babylon [586 BC] there are fourteen generations totaling 609 years. From the Babylonian Captivity to Christ there are fourteen generations totaling 504 years.\n\nBy the sequence of Numbers we calculate the number of 5,500 years from the time of the first Adam to Christ.<ref>Doukas (c. 1460).

Kyriake was seen as the day of resurrection of Christ and as both the first and eighth day of the week, in the same way that [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] was the [[Alpha and Omega|alpha and omega]] of the cosmos, existing both before and after time. The second day of the week recognized [[angels]], \"the secondary luminaries as the first reflections of the primal outpouring of light\", just as the sun and the moon had been observed during the Roman week. [[John the Forerunner|John the Baptist]], the forerunner (Prodromos) of Christ, was honored on the third day. Both the second and third days were viewed as occasions for penitence. The fourth and sixth days were dedicated to the [[Cross]]. The fourth day to the [[Theotokos]] and her mourning of the loss of her son and the sixth day (the Paraskeue) as the day of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] of the Lord, with holy songs sung and fasting in remembrance of these events. [[St. Nicholas]] was honored on the fifth day of the week, while the Sabatton day was set aside for the saints and all the deceased faithful.

The physical-scientific side of the origins of mankind, though important, is really quite secondary in significance to the Church's message. The central image of [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] as [[God]]'s image and likeness, who also represents fallen and sinful humanity, and the new Adam, [[Jesus Christ]], who is the \"beginning\", the first-born of the dead (Colossians 1:18) and the \"[[First Fruits#Christian perspective|first-fruits]]\" of those who were dead, and are now alive (1 Corinthians 15:20\u201323), is what is really important.<ref>Fr.

Light & Life Publishing, Minneapolis, 1988. pp.&nbsp;88,91.</ref>\n\n* [[Protopresbyter]] Dr. Doru Costache affirms in ''\"The Orthodox Doctrine of Creation in the Age of Science\"'' (2019), that Orthodox Christianity has never issued a dogma of creation that establishes in normative terms its relevant convictions, even though it does possess a strong sense of the cosmos, developing a theology of the world. While not specifically discussing the chronology of the Byzantine Calendar as such, he explains that the Orthodox doctrine of creation is largely compatible with the contemporary scientific representation of reality, also suggesting that the Christian doctrine of creation should preserve its capacity to be redrafted when the cultural environment changes. He states that [[Creation science|modern creationism]] has originated in [[Social environment|milieus]] that are foreign to the Orthodox worldview, and there is no record of a wholesale rejection of culture in the [[Patristics|patristic tradition]]. Rather, from the outset of its historical emergence, Orthodox theology has traditionally interacted with the available sciences and the cultural frameworks of the past. The ongoing contextualization, particularly in relation to scientific culture, remained the norm for most of the Byzantine era, which was a time of prodigious research, cultural cross pollination, and innovation. In contrast with contemporary creationism, which construes a [[Young Earth creationism|recently made world]], molded exclusively by God out of an [[Chemically inert|inert matter]] deprived of natural energy and capacity for movement, the Orthodox theology of creation traditionally advocates a distinction between the divine acts of creation, and organization. He argues that the supernaturalist worldview of creationism was discarded indirectly by the Orthodox Church in the seventh century as [[monoenergism]]. Thus he aligns with the view of an expanding universe whose history began billions of years ago, a universe characterized by homogeneity, movement, change, and complexity.<ref>Costache, Doru.

However, if we look instead at the problem from the point of view of [[Church_Fathers#Greek_Fathers|Greek patristic thought]], we see a very different way of fitting evolution into Christian belief. By referring to the writings of the Church Fathers including [[Gregory of Nyssa]] and [[Gregory of Nazianzus|Gregory the Theologian]], he states that what matters most is not the <em>process</em> of creation, but rather how the Church Fathers understood its <em>result</em>. The basic premise described is that God did not create humans in their present bodily condition; but rather prelapsarian human beings (i.e. before the [[Fall of man]]) had spiritual bodies and lived a kind of angelic life; humans entered the organismic life and entered 'time' itself only after the Fall, which happened before the beginning of the empirically known universe. Therefore it is entirely reasonable to suppose that evolution itself started in the fallen world; and Theistic evolutionists have no warrant to equate the earliest members of Homo sapiens with those humans who were created by God on the sixth day for life in paradise. The [[Genesis creation narrative|six days of creation]] and other events preceding the expulsion from Paradise simply lie beyond what science can discover. So \"[[Book of Genesis|Moses's Book]]\" possesses its own truth, independent of what scientists can say about the observable world. There can be no reason for conflict.<ref name=KHRAMOV/>\n\n* Professor Fr. Arsenius John Baptist Vuibert ([[Society of Saint-Sulpice|S.S.]]), a 19th-century historian, observed that [[Chronology of the Bible|Biblical Chronologies]] are uncertain due to discrepancies in the figures in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and other methodological factors, accounting for hundreds of different chronologies being assigned by historians. In the case of the Fathers of the [[Third Council of Constantinople|Sixth Ecumenical Council]], who assigned 5509 BC. as the date of the [[Genesis creation myth|creation of man]], he writes that it was in response to the emperor's wishes to fix an era or convenient starting point for historical computation.

The older dates of the [[Church Fathers]] in the Byzantine Era and in its precursor, the [[Byzantine calendar#Alexandrian Era|Alexandrian Era]], are based on the Greek [[Septuagint]]. The later dates of the [[Ussher chronology]] and the [[Hebrew Calendar#Epoch year|Hebrew Calendar]] are based on the Hebrew [[Masoretic Text]].\n\nThe [[Church Fathers|Fathers]] were well aware of the discrepancy of some hundreds of years between the Greek and Hebrew [[Old Testament]] chronology,{{#tag:ref|Note that according to Wacholder, [[Josephus|Josephus']] chronology for the antediluvian period (pre-flood) conforms with the [[Septuagint|LXX]], but for the [[Noachite]]s (post-flood) he used the Hebrew text.
