This [[Ascomycete]] fungus affects citrus plants throughout subtropical climates, causing a reduction in both fruit quantity and quality. Symptoms include both fruit and leaf lesions, the latter being critical to inter-tree dispersal. Strict regulation and management is necessary to control this disease since there are currently no citrus varieties that are resistant.\n\n{{Taxobox\n| name = ''Guignardia citricarpa''\n| regnum = [[Fungi]]\n| phylum = [[Ascomycota]]\n| classis = [[Dothideomycetes]]\n| subclassis = [[Incertae sedis]]\n| ordo = [[Botryosphaeriales]]\n| familia = [[Botryosphaeriaceae]]\n| genus = ''[[Guignardia]]''\n| species = '''''G. citricarpa'''''\n| binomial = ''Guignardia citricarpa''\n| binomial_authority = Kiely, (1948)\n| synonyms = \n*''Phoma citricarpa'' <small>McAlpine, (1899)</small>\n*''Phoma citricarpa var. mikan'' <small>Hara</small>\n*''Phyllosticta citricarpa'' <small>(McAlpine) Aa, (1973)</small>\n*''Phyllostictina citricarpa'' <small>(McAlpine) Petr., (1953)</small>\n}}\n\n==Fungus==\n''Guignardia citricarpa'' is a [[Plant pathology|plant pathogen]], some strains of which cause a [[leaf]] condition called ''black spot'' on [[citrus]] plants.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.doacs.state.fl.us/pi/pest_alerts/pdf/citrus-black-spot-pest-alert.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202072828/http://www.doacs.state.fl.us/pi/pest_alerts/pdf/citrus-black-spot-pest-alert.pdf |archive-date=2010-12-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  As a result, such strains are subject to phytosanitary legislation in the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]].<ref name=\"pmid18943020\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Baayen RP, Bonants PJ, Verkley G, etal |title=Nonpathogenic Isolates of the Citrus Black Spot Fungus, Guignardia citricarpa, Identified as a Cosmopolitan Endophyte of Woody Plants, G. mangiferae (Phyllosticta capitalensis) |journal=Phytopathology |volume=92 |issue=5 |pages=464\u201377 |date=May 2002 |pmid=18943020 |doi=10.1094/PHYTO.2002.92.5.464 |url=|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n[[Metabolite]] secreted by ''G. citricarpa'' have an inhibitory growth effect on some [[endophytic]] bacterial species, and stimulatory growth effect on others.<ref name=\"pmid11315114\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ara\u00fajo WL, Maccheroni W, Aguilar-Vildoso CI, Barroso PA, Saridakis HO, Azevedo JL |title=Variability and interactions between endophytic bacteria and fungi isolated from leaf tissues of citrus rootstocks |journal=Can.

These countries include: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Ghana, Mozambique, Philippines, South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Taiwan, The United States and Uruguay. Whether or not Citrus Black Spot is present in Japan and New Zealand is controversial. In both countries the fungus was thought to have been found, but after further testing it was identified as the [[Pathogenic fungus|non-pathogenic strain]], ''Guignardia mangiferae'', rather than the pathogenic strain ''Guignardia citricarpa'' which causes Citrus Black Spot.<ref name=dissertation>[http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-11192008-091812/unrestricted/dissertation.pdf]</ref> This disease is relatively new to North America; it was first seen in Southern Florida March, 2010.

[[Lemon]] and late maturing citrus such as [[Valencia orange]] are the most susceptible hosts. Moderately susceptible hosts are Hamlin sweet oranges, tangerine/ mandarin type fruit, and [[grapefruit]]. Though there are some hosts that are more susceptible to Citrus Black Spot than others, any citrus plant that is nutritionally stressed increases its chances of infection.<ref name=aphis>{{cite web | url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/citrus/black_spot.shtml | title=USDA APHIS &#124; Plant Pests and Diseases}}</ref>\n\n==Fruit Symptoms and Signs==\n\n===Hard Spot Lesions===\n[[File:Citrus Black Spot.jpg|thumb|left|Hard spot lesions on an orange host]]\nHard spots are the most common lesions.

This can be difficult, as culturing of the fruit lesions takes up to 14 days with an efficacy of less than 10%.

Both federal and state governments{{Where|date=February 2020}} have recommended the following preventative measures.\nTo control ''Guignardia citriparpa'' fungicides like copper and/or strobilurins should be applied monthly from early May to the middle of September (in the northern hemisphere).  Applications of the fungicides are recommended in early April (northern hemisphere) if that month has experienced more rainfall than usual resulting in the ideal conditions for citrus black spot to form.\n\nTable 1.

Accelerating this decomposition reduces the chance for ascospore inoculation which generally takes place in the middle of March. There are three possible methods to hasten this decomposition. One method is to increase the mircrosprinkler irrigation in the grove to half an hour for at least five days of the week. This form of control should continue for about a month and a half. The second method is to apply urea or ammonium to the leaf litter. The last and final method to accelerate leaf decomposition is to apply lime or calcium carbonate to the litter.  Urea, lime, and calcium carbonate reduce the number of fungal structures and spore production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/cg088|title=PP279/CG088: 2014 Florida Citrus Pest Management Guide: Citrus Black Spot|author1=Megan M.

Peres |work=ufl.edu|date=2016-05-06}}</ref> Since the fungus requires wet conditions to thrive, air flow in the citrus grove should be maximized to reduce leaf wetness.<ref name=\"Citrus Black Spot\"/>\n\nAlong with these methods it is also important to get rid of debris such as fallen fruit or twigs in a manner that reduces the chances of infecting other plants. Citrus Black Spot can colonize and reproduce on dead twigs. To dispose of citrus debris it should either be heated to a minimum of 180\u2109 for two hours, incinerated, buried in a landfill, or fed to livestock. Plant trash should be moved with caution if at all to avoid spreading the infectious ascospores.  Any trees that are infected with citrus black spot should be removed from the grove and disposed of. These trees must be removed because those that are declining and stressed will often have off season bloom. If there is more than one age of fruit present on the tree, it is possible for the asexual spores on the older fruits to be transferred to young fruits, thereby intensifying the disease. This off season blooming is often more problematic with Valencia oranges when old and new crops overlap; therefore fruits should be harvested before blooming commences.\n\n==Importance==\nCitrus Black Spot has a large economic impact on many countries because the black blemishes make it undesirable for human consumption and therefore the infected fruit cannot be sold. This type of economic impact is felt most in Australia and South Africa where the disease has been present for a number of years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.today/Nkr48|title=Guignardia citricarpa {{!}} Datasheet {{!}} Plantwise|date=2013-04-15|website=archive.vn|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> In Australia, South Africa, and China citrus is of particular importance due to the large role it plays in international trade. A few black spots on as little as one piece of fruit can cause the entire shipment to be rejected. When this happens the shipment usually has to be repackaged and resold to a less sensitive market which leads to large financial losses.<ref name=dissertation/> Along with making fruit unsuitable for sale Citrus Black Spot also causes early fruit drop and reduces crop yield.<ref name=aphis /> The reduction in fruit value due to Citrus Black Spot is estimated at 20-30%.<ref>[http://irrec.ifas.ufl.edu/postharvest/pdfs/past_events/2010_presentations/Feichtenberger-CBS.pdf]</ref>\n\nAt the end of 2013, the [[European Commission]] announced a ban on most imports of citrus fruit from South Africa because of concerns about the possible transmission of Citrus Black Spot to the EU. This ban was justified by a study by the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) on the risk of transmission. However, a specially convened panel of eminent scientists from Brazil, Argentina, the USA, Uruguay, Australia and South Africa concluded that there is no risk of transmission through fruit to European climates. It argued that Citrus Black Spot has never spread to new areas with fruit as the cause and citrus fruit has never been shown to be the cause of the spread of the disease. The panel pointed out that it is known to occur only in summer rainfall citrus production areas and that the only way it has been spread to new areas has been through infected propagation material moved to areas where the climate is suitable for its establishment.<ref>{{cite web|last=Agritrade|title=Debate on Citrus Black Spot continues|url=http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Commodities/Horticulture/Debate-on-Citrus-Black-Spot-continues|publisher=CTA|accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of citrus diseases]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{citrus}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q5615694}}\n\n[[Category:Fungal citrus diseases]]\n[[Category:Botryosphaeriaceae]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Fungal disease that affects citrus fruit}}\n{{Infobox plant disease\n| name            = Citrus black spot\n| image           = Citrus Black Spot lesions.jpg\n| caption         = Citrus black spot lesions\n| common_names    = \n| causal_agents   = ''Phyllosticta citricarpa''<ref name=renamed_from_2_on_20150203132126>Wikee, S., Udayanga, D., Crous, P.W., Chukeatirote, E., McKenzie, E.H., Bahkali, A.H., Dai, D. & Hyde, K.D. 2011, \"Phyllosticta\u2014an overview of current status of species recognition\", Fungal Diversity, vol. 51, no. 1, pp. 43-61</ref>  \n| hosts           = Citrus\n| vectors         = \n| EPPO_codes      = GUIGCI\n| distribution    = \n}}\n'''Citrus black spot''' is a fungal disease caused by '''''Guignardia citricarpa'''''.

Strict regulation and management is necessary to control this disease since there are currently no citrus varieties that are resistant.\n\n{{Taxobox\n| name = ''Guignardia citricarpa''\n| regnum = [[Fungi]]\n| phylum = [[Ascomycota]]\n| classis = [[Dothideomycetes]]\n| subclassis = [[Incertae sedis]]\n| ordo = [[Botryosphaeriales]]\n| familia = [[Botryosphaeriaceae]]\n| genus = ''[[Guignardia]]''\n| species = '''''G. citricarpa'''''\n| binomial = ''Guignardia citricarpa''\n| binomial_authority = Kiely, (1948)\n| synonyms = \n*''Phoma citricarpa'' <small>McAlpine, (1899)</small>\n*''Phoma citricarpa var. mikan'' <small>Hara</small>\n*''Phyllosticta citricarpa'' <small>(McAlpine) Aa, (1973)</small>\n*''Phyllostictina citricarpa'' <small>(McAlpine) Petr., (1953)</small>\n}}\n\n==Fungus==\n''Guignardia citricarpa'' is a [[Plant pathology|plant pathogen]], some strains of which cause a [[leaf]] condition called ''black spot'' on [[citrus]] plants.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.doacs.state.fl.us/pi/pest_alerts/pdf/citrus-black-spot-pest-alert.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202072828/http://www.doacs.state.fl.us/pi/pest_alerts/pdf/citrus-black-spot-pest-alert.pdf |archive-date=2010-12-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  As a result, such strains are subject to phytosanitary legislation in the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]].<ref name=\"pmid18943020\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Baayen RP, Bonants PJ, Verkley G, etal |title=Nonpathogenic Isolates of the Citrus Black Spot Fungus, Guignardia citricarpa, Identified as a Cosmopolitan Endophyte of Woody Plants, G. mangiferae (Phyllosticta capitalensis) |journal=Phytopathology |volume=92 |issue=5 |pages=464\u201377 |date=May 2002 |pmid=18943020 |doi=10.1094/PHYTO.2002.92.5.464 |url=|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n[[Metabolite]] secreted by ''G. citricarpa'' have an inhibitory growth effect on some [[endophytic]] bacterial species, and stimulatory growth effect on others.<ref name=\"pmid11315114\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ara\u00fajo WL, Maccheroni W, Aguilar-Vildoso CI, Barroso PA, Saridakis HO, Azevedo JL |title=Variability and interactions between endophytic bacteria and fungi isolated from leaf tissues of citrus rootstocks |journal=Can.

It can be found in many countries around the world. These countries include: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Ghana, Mozambique, Philippines, South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Taiwan, The United States and Uruguay. Whether or not Citrus Black Spot is present in Japan and New Zealand is controversial. In both countries the fungus was thought to have been found, but after further testing it was identified as the [[Pathogenic_fungus|non-pathogenic strain]], ''Guignardia mangiferae'', rather than the pathogenic strain ''Guignardia citricarpa'' which causes Citrus Black Spot.<ref name=dissertation>[http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-11192008-091812/unrestricted/dissertation.pdf]</ref> This disease is relatively new to North America; it was first seen in Southern Florida March, 2010.

[[Lemon]] and late maturing citrus such as [[Valencia orange]] are the most susceptible hosts. Moderately susceptible hosts are Hamlin sweet oranges, tangerine/ mandarin type fruit, and [[grapefruit]]. Though there are some hosts that are more susceptible to Citrus Black Spot than others, any citrus plant that is nutritionally stressed increases its chances of infection.<ref name=aphis>{{cite web | url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/citrus/black_spot.shtml | title=USDA APHIS &#124; Plant Pests and Diseases}}</ref>\n\n==Fruit Symptoms and Signs==\n\n===Hard Spot Lesions===\n[[File:Citrus Black Spot.jpg|thumb|left|Hard spot lesions on an orange host]]\nHard spots are the most common lesions.

This can be difficult, as culturing of the fruit lesions takes up to 14 days with an efficacy of less than 10%. Diagnosis is also complicated by the morphological similarities of the fungal structures to the non-pathogenic strain ''Guignarida mangiferae''. The two species can be distinguished by molecular testing using [[PCR]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Guignardia citricarpa|journal=EPPO Bulletin|volume=39|issue=3|pages=318\u2013327|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2338.2009.02319.x|year=2009}}</ref>\n\n==Life Cycle==\nAfter overwintering in leaf debris, ascostroma begin producing [[ascospores]].

Both federal and state governments{{Where|date=February 2020}} have recommended the following preventative measures.\nTo control ''Guignardia citriparpa'' fungicides like copper and/or strobilurins should be applied monthly from early May to the middle of September (in the northern hemisphere).  Applications of the fungicides are recommended in early April (northern hemisphere) if that month has experienced more rainfall than usual resulting in the ideal conditions for citrus black spot to form.\n\nTable 1.

Accelerating this decomposition reduces the chance for ascospore inoculation which generally takes place in the middle of March. There are three possible methods to hasten this decomposition. One method is to increase the mircrosprinkler irrigation in the grove to half an hour for at least five days of the week. This form of control should continue for about a month and a half. The second method is to apply urea or ammonium to the leaf litter. The last and final method to accelerate leaf decomposition is to apply lime or calcium carbonate to the litter.  Urea, lime, and calcium carbonate reduce the number of fungal structures and spore production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/cg088|title=PP279/CG088: 2014 Florida Citrus Pest Management Guide: Citrus Black Spot|author1=Megan M. Dewdney |author2=Timothy S. Schubert |author3=Mark R. Estes |author4=Natalia A. Peres |work=ufl.edu|date=2016-05-06}}</ref> Since the fungus requires wet conditions to thrive, air flow in the citrus grove should be maximized to reduce leaf wetness.<ref name=\"Citrus Black Spot\"/>\n\nAlong with these methods it is also important to get rid of debris such as fallen fruit or twigs in a manner that reduces the chances of infecting other plants. Citrus Black Spot can colonize and reproduce on dead twigs. To dispose of citrus debris it should either be heated to a minimum of 180\u2109 for two hours, incinerated, buried in a landfill, or fed to livestock. Plant trash should be moved with caution if at all to avoid spreading the infectious ascospores.  Any trees that are infected with citrus black spot should be removed from the grove and disposed of. These trees must be removed because those that are declining and stressed will often have off season bloom. If there is more than one age of fruit present on the tree, it is possible for the asexual spores on the older fruits to be transferred to young fruits, thereby intensifying the disease. This off season blooming is often more problematic with Valencia oranges when old and new crops overlap; therefor fruits should be harvested before blooming commences.\n\n==Importance==\nCitrus Black Spot has a large economic impact on many countries because the black blemishes make it undesirable for human consumption and therefore the infected fruit cannot be sold. This type of economic impact is felt most in Australia and South Africa where the disease has been present for a number of years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.today/Nkr48|title=Guignardia citricarpa {{!}} Datasheet {{!}} Plantwise|date=2013-04-15|website=archive.vn|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> In Australia, South Africa, and China citrus is of particular importance due to the large role it plays in international trade. A few black spots on as little as one piece of fruit can cause the entire shipment to be rejected. When this happens the shipment usually has to be repackaged and resold to a less sensitive market which leads to large financial losses.<ref name=dissertation/> Along with making fruit unsuitable for sale Citrus Black Spot also causes early fruit drop and reduces crop yield.<ref name=aphis /> The reduction in fruit value due to Citrus Black Spot is estimated at 20-30%.<ref>[http://irrec.ifas.ufl.edu/postharvest/pdfs/past_events/2010_presentations/Feichtenberger-CBS.pdf]</ref>\n\nAt the end of 2013, the [[European Commission]] announced a ban on most imports of citrus fruit from South Africa because of concerns about the possible transmission of Citrus Black Spot to the EU. This ban was justified by a study by the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) on the risk of transmission. However, a specially convened panel of eminent scientists from Brazil, Argentina, the USA, Uruguay, Australia and South Africa concluded that there is no risk of transmission through fruit to European climates. It argued that Citrus Black Spot has never spread to new areas with fruit as the cause and citrus fruit has never been shown to be the cause of the spread of the disease. The panel pointed out that it is known to occur only in summer rainfall citrus production areas and that the only way it has been spread to new areas has been through infected propagation material moved to areas where the climate is suitable for its establishment.<ref>{{cite web|last=Agritrade|title=Debate on Citrus Black Spot continues|url=http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Commodities/Horticulture/Debate-on-Citrus-Black-Spot-continues|publisher=CTA|accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of citrus diseases]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{citrus}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q5615694}}\n\n[[Category:Fungal citrus diseases]]\n[[Category:Botryosphaeriaceae]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo/generalfixes, replaced: therefor \u2192 therefore", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrus_black_spot"}

She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing, timing, [[Intonation (music)|intonation]], and a \"horn-like\" improvisational ability, particularly in her [[scat singing]].\n\nAfter a tumultuous adolescence, Fitzgerald found stability in musical success with the [[Chick Webb]] Orchestra, performing across the country but most often associated with the [[Savoy Ballroom]] in Harlem. Her rendition of the nursery rhyme \"[[A-Tisket, A-Tasket]]\" helped boost both her and Webb to national fame. After taking over the band when Webb died, Fitzgerald left it behind in 1942 to start her solo career.\n\nHer manager was Moe Gale, co-founder of the Savoy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/the-savoy-ballroom-opens|title=The Savoy Ballroom opens {{!}} African American Registry|website=Aaregistry.org|access-date=October 29, 2016}}</ref> until she turned the rest of her career over to [[Norman Granz]], who founded [[Verve Records]] to produce new records by Fitzgerald. With Verve she recorded some of her more widely noted works, particularly her interpretations of the [[Great American Songbook]].\n\nWhile Fitzgerald appeared in movies and as a guest on popular television shows in the second half of the twentieth century, her musical collaborations with [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Duke Ellington]], and [[The Ink Spots]] were some of her most notable acts outside of her solo career. These partnerships produced some of her best-known songs such as \"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]\", \"[[Cheek to Cheek]]\", \"[[Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall]]\", and \"[[It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)]]\".\n\nIn 1993, after a career of nearly 60 years, she gave her last public performance. Three years later, she died at the age of 79 after years of declining health. Her accolades included fourteen [[Grammy Awards]], the [[National Medal of Arts]], and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].\n\n==Early life==\nFitzgerald was born on April 25, 1917, in Newport News, Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ellafitzgerald.com/about/biography|title=Biography|date=March 11, 2015|website=Ella Fitzgerald|accessdate=December 21, 2018}}</ref> She was the daughter of William Fitzgerald and Temperance \"Tempie\" Henry.{{sfn|Nicholson|1996|p=4}} Her parents were unmarried but lived together for at least two and a half years after she was born.

The advent of [[bebop]] led to new developments in Fitzgerald's vocal style, influenced by her work with [[Dizzy Gillespie]]'s big band.

She later described the period as strategically crucial, saying, \"I had gotten to the point where I was only singing be-bop. I thought be-bop was 'it', and that all I had to do was go some place and sing bop. But it finally got to the point where I had no place to sing.

The composers and lyricists spotlighted on each set, taken together, represent the greatest part of the cultural canon known as the ''[[Great American Songbook]]''. Her song selections ranged from standards to rarities and represented an attempt by Fitzgerald to cross over into a non-jazz audience. The sets are the most well-known items in her discography.\n[[File:Ella Fitzgerald 1968.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Fitzgerald in 1968, courtesy of the [[Fraser MacPherson]] estate]]\n\n''[[Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Song Book]]'' was the only Song Book on which the composer she interpreted played with her. [[Duke Ellington]] and his longtime collaborator [[Billy Strayhorn]] both appeared on exactly half the set's 38 tracks and wrote two new pieces of music for the album: \"The E and D Blues\" and a four-movement musical portrait of Fitzgerald. The Song Book series ended up becoming the singer's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful work, and probably her most significant offering to American culture. ''The New York Times'' wrote in 1996, \"These albums were among the first pop records to devote such serious attention to individual songwriters, and they were instrumental in establishing the pop album as a vehicle for serious musical exploration.\"<ref name=\"nyobit\"/>\n\nDays after Fitzgerald's death, ''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[Frank Rich]] wrote that in the Song Book series Fitzgerald \"performed a cultural transaction as extraordinary as [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]' contemporaneous integration of white and [[African American]] soul. Here was a black woman popularizing urban songs often written by immigrant Jews to a national audience of predominantly white Christians.\"<ref name=\"rich\"/> [[Frank Sinatra]], out of respect for Fitzgerald, prohibited [[Capitol Records]] from re-releasing his own recordings in separate albums for individual composers in the same way.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nFitzgerald also recorded albums exclusively devoted to the songs of Porter and [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]] in 1972 and 1983; the albums being, respectively, ''[[Ella Loves Cole]]'' and ''[[Nice Work If You Can Get It (album)|Nice Work If You Can Get It]]''. A later collection devoted to a single composer was released during her time with [[Pablo Records]], ''[[Ella Abra\u00e7a Jobim]]'', featuring the songs of [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]].\n\nWhile recording the Song Books and the occasional studio album, Fitzgerald toured 40 to 45 weeks per year in the United States and internationally, under the tutelage of Norman Granz. Granz helped solidify her position as one of the leading live jazz performers.<ref name=\"nyobit\"/> In 1961 Fitzgerald bought a house in the [[Klampenborg]] district of Copenhagen, Denmark, after she began a relationship with a Danish man. Though the relationship ended after a year, Fitzgerald regularly returned to Denmark over the next three years, and even considered buying a jazz club there. The house was sold in 1963, and Fitzgerald permanently returned to the United States.{{sfn|Nicholson|1996|p=198}}\n\nThere are several live albums on Verve that are highly regarded by critics. ''[[At the Opera House]]'' shows a typical Jazz at the Philharmonic set from Fitzgerald. ''[[Ella in Rome: The Birthday Concert|Ella in Rome]]'' and ''[[Twelve Nights in Hollywood]]'' display her vocal jazz canon. ''[[Ella in Berlin: Mack the Knife|Ella in Berlin]]'' is still one of her best-selling albums; it includes a Grammy-winning performance of \"[[Mack the Knife]]\" in which she forgets the lyrics but improvises magnificently to compensate.\n\nVerve Records was sold to [[MGM Records|MGM]] in 1963 for $3 million and in 1967 MGM failed to renew Fitzgerald's contract. Over the next five years she flitted between [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] and [[Reprise Records|Reprise]]. Her material at this time represented a departure from her typical jazz repertoire. For Capitol she recorded ''[[Brighten the Corner]]'', an album of [[hymn]]s, ''[[Ella Fitzgerald's Christmas]]'', an album of traditional [[Christmas carol]]s, ''[[Misty Blue (album)|Misty Blue]]'', a [[country and western]]-influenced album, and ''[[30 by Ella]]'', a series of six medleys that fulfilled her obligations for the label. During this period, she had her last US chart single with a cover of [[Smokey Robinson]]'s \"[[Get Ready (The Temptations song)|Get Ready]]\", previously a hit for [[the Temptations]], and some months later a top-five hit for [[Get Ready (The Temptations song)#Rare Earth version|Rare Earth]].\n\nThe surprise success of the 1972 album ''[[Jazz at Santa Monica Civic '72]]'' led Granz to found [[Pablo Records]], his first record label since the sale of Verve. Fitzgerald recorded some 20 albums for the label. ''[[Ella in London]]'' recorded live in 1974 with pianist [[Tommy Flanagan]], guitarist Joe Pass, bassist Keter Betts and drummer Bobby Durham, was considered by many to be some of her best work. The following year she again performed with Joe Pass on German television station [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] in [[Hamburg]]. Her years with Pablo Records also documented the decline in her voice. \"She frequently used shorter, stabbing phrases, and her voice was harder, with a wider vibrato\", one biographer wrote.<ref name=Nicholson>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2004}} ''\"For many years Fitzgerald's birthdate was thought to be on the same date one year later in 1918 \u2013 and it is still listed as such in some sources \u2013 but research by Nicholson and another biographer, Tanya Lee Stone, established 1917 as the correct year of birth.\"''</ref> Plagued by health problems, Fitzgerald made her last recording in 1991 and her last public performances in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1506681/Sir-Johnny-up-there-with-the-Count-and-the-Duke.html|title=Sir Johnny up there with the Count and the Duke|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Hugh|last=Davies|date=December 31, 2005|accessdate=March 16, 2007|location=London}}</ref>\n\n==Film and television==\n[[File:Ronald Reagan Ella Fitzgerald.jpg|thumb|right|Fitzgerald shakes hands with [[President the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] after performing in the [[White House]], 1981]]\n\nIn her most notable screen role, Fitzgerald played the part of singer Maggie Jackson in [[Jack Webb]]'s 1955 jazz film ''[[Pete Kelly's Blues (film)|Pete Kelly's Blues]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Movie of the week: Pete Kelly's Blues|magazine=Jet|date=August 25, 1955|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vbEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62|accessdate=February 23, 2014|issn=0021-5996}}</ref> The film costarred [[Janet Leigh]] and singer [[Peggy Lee]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Capua|first=Michelangelo|title=Janet Leigh: A Biography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRlfe8948H4C&pg=PA176|accessdate=February 23, 2014|date=March 8, 2013 |publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-7022-8|page=176}}</ref> Even though she had already worked in the movies (she had sung briefly in the 1942 [[Abbott and Costello]] film ''[[Ride 'Em Cowboy (1942 film)|Ride 'Em Cowboy]]''),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Furia|first1=Philip|last2=Patterson|first2=Laurie|title=The Songs of Hollywood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1NVcYC2cHk4C&pg=PA174 |accessdate=February 23, 2014|date=March 10, 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-979266-5|page=174}}</ref> she was \"delighted\" when Norman Granz negotiated the role for her, and, \"at the time ... considered her role in the [[Warner Brothers]] movie the biggest thing ever to have happened to her.\"<ref name=\"Nicholson\"/> Amid ''The New York Times'' pan of the film when it opened in August 1955, the reviewer wrote, \"About five minutes (out of ninety-five) suggest the picture this might have been.

It was directed by Leslie Woodhead and produced by Reggie Nadelson. It was released in the UK in 2019. <ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://jazzjournal.co.uk/2019/03/21/ella-fitzgerald-just-one-of-those-things/|title=Ella Fitzgerald: Just One of Those Things &#124; Jazz Journal|first=Sally|last=Evans-Darby}}</ref>\n\n==Collaborations==\n{{unref|section|date=April 2020}}\nFitzgerald's most famous collaborations were with the vocal quartet [[Bill Kenny (singer)|Bill Kenny]] & [[the Ink Spots]], trumpeter [[Louis Armstrong]], the guitarist [[Joe Pass]], and the bandleaders [[Count Basie]] and [[Duke Ellington]].\n* From 1943 to 1950, Fitzgerald recorded seven songs with the Ink Spots featuring [[Bill Kenny (singer)|Bill Kenny]]. Of the seven, four reached the top of the pop charts, including \"[[I'm Making Believe]]\" and \"[[Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall]],\" which both reached #1.\n* Fitzgerald recorded three Verve studio albums with Louis Armstrong, two albums of standards (1956's ''[[Ella and Louis]]'' and 1957's ''[[Ella and Louis Again]]''), and a third album featured music from the [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]] opera ''[[Porgy and Bess (Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong album)|Porgy and Bess]]''. Fitzgerald also recorded a number of sides with Armstrong for Decca in the early 1950s.\n* Fitzgerald is sometimes referred to as the quintessential swing singer, and her meetings with Count Basie are highly regarded by critics. Fitzgerald features on one track on Basie's 1957 album ''[[One O'Clock Jump (album)|One O'Clock Jump]]'', while her 1963 album ''[[Ella and Basie!]]'' is remembered as one of her greatest recordings. With the 'New Testament' Basie band in full swing, and arrangements written by a young [[Quincy Jones]], this album proved a respite from the 'Song Book' recordings and constant touring that Fitzgerald was engaged in during this period. Fitzgerald and Basie also collaborated on the 1972 album ''[[Jazz at Santa Monica Civic '72]]'', and on the 1979 albums ''[[Digital III at Montreux]]'', ''[[A Classy Pair]]'' and ''[[A Perfect Match (Ella Fitzgerald album)|A Perfect Match]]''.\n* Fitzgerald and Joe Pass recorded four albums together toward the end of Fitzgerald's career. She recorded several albums with piano accompaniment, but a guitar proved the perfect melodic foil for her. Fitzgerald and Pass appeared together on the albums ''[[Take Love Easy]]'' (1973), ''[[Easy Living (Ella Fitzgerald album)|Easy Living]]'' (1986), ''[[Speak Love]]'' (1983) and ''[[Fitzgerald and Pass... Again]]'' (1976).\n* Fitzgerald and Duke Ellington recorded two live albums and two studio albums. Her ''Duke Ellington Song Book'' placed Ellington firmly in the canon known as the Great American Songbook, and the 1960s saw Fitzgerald and the 'Duke' meet on the [[C\u00f4te d'Azur]] for the 1966 album ''[[Ella and Duke at the Cote D'Azur]]'', and in [[Sweden]] for ''[[The Stockholm Concert, 1966]]''. Their 1965 album ''[[Ella at Duke's Place]]'' is also extremely well received.\n\nFitzgerald had a number of famous jazz musicians and soloists as sidemen over her long career. The trumpeters [[Roy Eldridge]] and Dizzy Gillespie, the guitarist [[Herb Ellis]], and the pianists Tommy Flanagan, [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Lou Levy (pianist)|Lou Levy]], [[Paul Smith (pianist)|Paul Smith]], [[Jimmy Rowles]], and [[Ellis Larkins]] all worked with Fitzgerald mostly in live, small group settings.\n\nPossibly Fitzgerald's greatest unrealized collaboration (in terms of popular music) was a studio or live album with [[Frank Sinatra]].

She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing, timing, [[Intonation (music)|intonation]], and a \"horn-like\" improvisational ability, particularly in her [[scat singing]].\n\nAfter a tumultuous adolescence, Fitzgerald found stability in musical success with the [[Chick Webb]] Orchestra, performing across the country but most often associated with the [[Savoy Ballroom]] in Harlem. Her rendition of the nursery rhyme \"[[A-Tisket, A-Tasket]]\" helped boost both her and Webb to national fame. After taking over the band when Webb died, Fitzgerald left it behind in 1942 to start her solo career.\n\nHer manager was Moe Gale, co-founder of the Savoy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/the-savoy-ballroom-opens|title=The Savoy Ballroom opens {{!}} African American Registry|website=Aaregistry.org|access-date=October 29, 2016}}</ref> until she turned the rest of her career over to [[Norman Granz]], who founded [[Verve Records]] to produce new records by Fitzgerald. With Verve she recorded some of her more widely noted works, particularly her interpretations of the [[Great American Songbook]].\n\nWhile Fitzgerald appeared in movies and as a guest on popular television shows in the second half of the twentieth century, her musical collaborations with [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Duke Ellington]], and [[The Ink Spots]] were some of her most notable acts outside of her solo career. These partnerships produced some of her best-known songs such as \"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]\", \"[[Cheek to Cheek]]\", \"[[Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall]]\", and \"[[It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)]]\".\n\nIn 1993, after a career of nearly 60 years, she gave her last public performance. Three years later, she died at the age of 79 after years of declining health. Her accolades included fourteen [[Grammy Awards]], the [[National Medal of Arts]], and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].\n\n==Early life==\nFitzgerald was born on April 25, 1917, in Newport News, Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ellafitzgerald.com/about/biography|title=Biography|date=March 11, 2015|website=Ella Fitzgerald|accessdate=December 21, 2018}}</ref> She was the daughter of William Fitzgerald and Temperance \"Tempie\" Henry.{{sfn|Nicholson|1996|p=4}} Her parents were unmarried but lived together for at least two and a half years after she was born.

The composers and lyricists spotlighted on each set, taken together, represent the greatest part of the cultural canon known as the ''[[Great American Songbook]]''. Her song selections ranged from standards to rarities and represented an attempt by Fitzgerald to cross over into a non-jazz audience. The sets are the most well-known items in her discography.\n[[File:Ella Fitzgerald 1968.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Fitzgerald in 1968, courtesy of the [[Fraser MacPherson]] estate]]\n\n''[[Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Song Book]]'' was the only Song Book on which the composer she interpreted played with her. [[Duke Ellington]] and his longtime collaborator [[Billy Strayhorn]] both appeared on exactly half the set's 38 tracks and wrote two new pieces of music for the album: \"The E and D Blues\" and a four-movement musical portrait of Fitzgerald. The Song Book series ended up becoming the singer's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful work, and probably her most significant offering to American culture. ''The New York Times'' wrote in 1996, \"These albums were among the first pop records to devote such serious attention to individual songwriters, and they were instrumental in establishing the pop album as a vehicle for serious musical exploration.\"<ref name=\"nyobit\"/>\n\nDays after Fitzgerald's death, ''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[Frank Rich]] wrote that in the Song Book series Fitzgerald \"performed a cultural transaction as extraordinary as [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]' contemporaneous integration of white and [[African American]] soul. Here was a black woman popularizing urban songs often written by immigrant Jews to a national audience of predominantly white Christians.\"<ref name=\"rich\"/> [[Frank Sinatra]], out of respect for Fitzgerald, prohibited [[Capitol Records]] from re-releasing his own recordings in separate albums for individual composers in the same way.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nFitzgerald also recorded albums exclusively devoted to the songs of Porter and [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]] in 1972 and 1983; the albums being, respectively, ''[[Ella Loves Cole]]'' and ''[[Nice Work If You Can Get It (album)|Nice Work If You Can Get It]]''. A later collection devoted to a single composer was released during her time with [[Pablo Records]], ''[[Ella Abra\u00e7a Jobim]]'', featuring the songs of [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]].\n\nWhile recording the Song Books and the occasional studio album, Fitzgerald toured 40 to 45 weeks per year in the United States and internationally, under the tutelage of Norman Granz. Granz helped solidify her position as one of the leading live jazz performers.<ref name=\"nyobit\"/> In 1961 Fitzgerald bought a house in the [[Klampenborg]] district of Copenhagen, Denmark, after she began a relationship with a Danish man. Though the relationship ended after a year, Fitzgerald regularly returned to Denmark over the next three years, and even considered buying a jazz club there. The house was sold in 1963, and Fitzgerald permanently returned to the United States.{{sfn|Nicholson|1996|p=198}}\n\nThere are several live albums on Verve that are highly regarded by critics. ''[[At the Opera House]]'' shows a typical Jazz at the Philharmonic set from Fitzgerald. ''[[Ella in Rome: The Birthday Concert|Ella in Rome]]'' and ''[[Twelve Nights in Hollywood]]'' display her vocal jazz canon. ''[[Ella in Berlin: Mack the Knife|Ella in Berlin]]'' is still one of her best-selling albums; it includes a Grammy-winning performance of \"[[Mack the Knife]]\" in which she forgets the lyrics but improvises magnificently to compensate.\n\nVerve Records was sold to [[MGM Records|MGM]] in 1963 for $3 million and in 1967 MGM failed to renew Fitzgerald's contract. Over the next five years she flitted between [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] and [[Reprise Records|Reprise]]. Her material at this time represented a departure from her typical jazz repertoire. For Capitol she recorded ''[[Brighten the Corner]]'', an album of [[hymn]]s, ''[[Ella Fitzgerald's Christmas]]'', an album of traditional [[Christmas carol]]s, ''[[Misty Blue (album)|Misty Blue]]'', a [[country and western]]-influenced album, and ''[[30 by Ella]]'', a series of six medleys that fulfilled her obligations for the label. During this period, she had her last US chart single with a cover of [[Smokey Robinson]]'s \"[[Get Ready (The Temptations song)|Get Ready]]\", previously a hit for [[the Temptations]], and some months later a top-five hit for [[Get Ready (The Temptations song)#Rare Earth version|Rare Earth]].\n\nThe surprise success of the 1972 album ''[[Jazz at Santa Monica Civic '72]]'' led Granz to found [[Pablo Records]], his first record label since the sale of Verve. Fitzgerald recorded some 20 albums for the label. ''[[Ella in London]]'' recorded live in 1974 with pianist [[Tommy Flanagan]], guitarist Joe Pass, bassist Keter Betts and drummer Bobby Durham, was considered by many to be some of her best work. The following year she again performed with Joe Pass on German television station [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] in [[Hamburg]]. Her years with Pablo Records also documented the decline in her voice. \"She frequently used shorter, stabbing phrases, and her voice was harder, with a wider vibrato\", one biographer wrote.<ref name=Nicholson>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2004}} ''\"For many years Fitzgerald's birthdate was thought to be on the same date one year later in 1918 \u2013 and it is still listed as such in some sources \u2013 but research by Nicholson and another biographer, Tanya Lee Stone, established 1917 as the correct year of birth.\"''</ref> Plagued by health problems, Fitzgerald made her last recording in 1991 and her last public performances in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1506681/Sir-Johnny-up-there-with-the-Count-and-the-Duke.html|title=Sir Johnny up there with the Count and the Duke|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Hugh|last=Davies|date=December 31, 2005|accessdate=March 16, 2007|location=London}}</ref>\n\n==Film and television==\n[[File:Ronald Reagan Ella Fitzgerald.jpg|thumb|right|Fitzgerald shakes hands with [[President the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] after performing in the [[White House]], 1981]]\n\nIn her most notable screen role, Fitzgerald played the part of singer Maggie Jackson in [[Jack Webb]]'s 1955 jazz film ''[[Pete Kelly's Blues (film)|Pete Kelly's Blues]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Movie of the week: Pete Kelly's Blues|magazine=Jet|date=August 25, 1955|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vbEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62|accessdate=February 23, 2014|issn=0021-5996}}</ref> The film costarred [[Janet Leigh]] and singer [[Peggy Lee]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Capua|first=Michelangelo|title=Janet Leigh: A Biography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRlfe8948H4C&pg=PA176|accessdate=February 23, 2014|date=March 8, 2013 |publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-7022-8|page=176}}</ref> Even though she had already worked in the movies (she had sung briefly in the 1942 [[Abbott and Costello]] film ''[[Ride 'Em Cowboy (1942 film)|Ride 'Em Cowboy]]''),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Furia|first1=Philip|last2=Patterson|first2=Laurie|title=The Songs of Hollywood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1NVcYC2cHk4C&pg=PA174 |accessdate=February 23, 2014|date=March 10, 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-979266-5|page=174}}</ref> she was \"delighted\" when Norman Granz negotiated the role for her, and, \"at the time ... considered her role in the [[Warner Brothers]] movie the biggest thing ever to have happened to her.\"<ref name=\"Nicholson\"/> Amid ''The New York Times'' pan of the film when it opened in August 1955, the reviewer wrote, \"About five minutes (out of ninety-five) suggest the picture this might have been.

It was directed by Leslie Woodhead and produced by Reggie Nadelson. It was released in the UK in 2019. <ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://jazzjournal.co.uk/2019/03/21/ella-fitzgerald-just-one-of-those-things/|title=Ella Fitzgerald: Just One of Those Things &#124; Jazz Journal|first=Sally|last=Evans-Darby}}</ref>\n\n==Collaborations==\n{{unref|section|date=April 2020}}\nFitzgerald's most famous collaborations were with the vocal quartet [[Bill Kenny (singer)|Bill Kenny]] & [[the Ink Spots]], trumpeter [[Louis Armstrong]], the guitarist [[Joe Pass]], and the bandleaders [[Count Basie]] and [[Duke Ellington]].\n* From 1943 to 1950, Fitzgerald recorded seven songs with the Ink Spots featuring [[Bill Kenny (singer)|Bill Kenny]]. Of the seven, four reached the top of the pop charts, including \"[[I'm Making Believe]]\" and \"[[Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall]],\" which both reached #1.\n* Fitzgerald recorded three Verve studio albums with Louis Armstrong, two albums of standards (1956's ''[[Ella and Louis]]'' and 1957's ''[[Ella and Louis Again]]''), and a third album featured music from the [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]] opera ''[[Porgy and Bess (Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong album)|Porgy and Bess]]''. Fitzgerald also recorded a number of sides with Armstrong for Decca in the early 1950s.\n* Fitzgerald is sometimes referred to as the quintessential swing singer, and her meetings with Count Basie are highly regarded by critics. Fitzgerald features on one track on Basie's 1957 album ''[[One O'Clock Jump (album)|One O'Clock Jump]]'', while her 1963 album ''[[Ella and Basie!]]'' is remembered as one of her greatest recordings. With the 'New Testament' Basie band in full swing, and arrangements written by a young [[Quincy Jones]], this album proved a respite from the 'Song Book' recordings and constant touring that Fitzgerald was engaged in during this period. Fitzgerald and Basie also collaborated on the 1972 album ''[[Jazz at Santa Monica Civic '72]]'', and on the 1979 albums ''[[Digital III at Montreux]]'', ''[[A Classy Pair]]'' and ''[[A Perfect Match (Ella Fitzgerald album)|A Perfect Match]]''.\n* Fitzgerald and Joe Pass recorded four albums together toward the end of Fitzgerald's career. She recorded several albums with piano accompaniment, but a guitar proved the perfect melodic foil for her. Fitzgerald and Pass appeared together on the albums ''[[Take Love Easy]]'' (1973), ''[[Easy Living (Ella Fitzgerald album)|Easy Living]]'' (1986), ''[[Speak Love]]'' (1983) and ''[[Fitzgerald and Pass... Again]]'' (1976).\n* Fitzgerald and Duke Ellington recorded two live albums and two studio albums. Her ''Duke Ellington Song Book'' placed Ellington firmly in the canon known as the Great American Songbook, and the 1960s saw Fitzgerald and the 'Duke' meet on the [[C\u00f4te d'Azur]] for the 1966 album ''[[Ella and Duke at the Cote D'Azur]]'', and in [[Sweden]] for ''[[The Stockholm Concert, 1966]]''. Their 1965 album ''[[Ella at Duke's Place]]'' is also extremely well received.\n\nFitzgerald had a number of famous jazz musicians and soloists as sidemen over her long career. The trumpeters [[Roy Eldridge]] and Dizzy Gillespie, the guitarist [[Herb Ellis]], and the pianists Tommy Flanagan, [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Lou Levy (pianist)|Lou Levy]], [[Paul Smith (pianist)|Paul Smith]], [[Jimmy Rowles]], and [[Ellis Larkins]] all worked with Fitzgerald mostly in live, small group settings.\n\nPossibly Fitzgerald's greatest unrealized collaboration (in terms of popular music) was a studio or live album with [[Frank Sinatra]]. The two appeared on the same stage only periodically over the years, in television specials in 1958 and 1959, and again on 1967's ''[[A Man and His Music + Ella + Jobim]]'', a show that also featured [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]]. Pianist Paul Smith has said, \"Ella loved working with [Frank]. Sinatra gave her his dressing-room on ''A Man and His Music'' and couldn't do enough for her.\" When asked, Norman Granz would cite \"complex contractual reasons\" for the fact that the two artists never recorded together.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/Humanities/pschmid1/essays/sinatra/sinatra2.html|title=On Frank Sinatra's Hair|website=Swarthmore.edu|access-date=April 26, 2017}}</ref> Fitzgerald's appearance with Sinatra and Count Basie in June 1974 for a series of concerts at [[Caesars Palace|Caesars Palace, Las Vegas]], was seen as an important incentive for Sinatra to return from his self-imposed retirement of the early 1970s.

Together they adopted a child born to Fitzgerald's half-sister, Frances, whom they christened [[Ray Brown Jr.]] With Fitzgerald and Brown often busy touring and recording, the child was largely raised by his mother's aunt, Virginia. Fitzgerald and Brown divorced in 1953, bowing to the various career pressures both were experiencing at the time, though they would continue to perform together.<ref name=\"nyobit\"/>\n\nIn July 1957, [[Reuters]] reported that Fitzgerald had secretly married [[Thor Einar Larsen]], a young Norwegian, in [[Oslo]].

She was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] four times throughout her career.\n\nIn addition to her success as a comedic lead, Russell was known for playing dramatic  characters as well, especially wealthy, dignified, ladylike women, being one of the few actresses of her time who regularly played professional women, such as judges, reporters, and psychiatrists.<ref>{{cite book|last=Basinger|first=Jeanine|title=A Woman's View: How Hollywood Spoke to Women, 1930-1960|year=1993|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Hanover|isbn=0-8195-6291-2|pages=178|edition=Reprinted.}}</ref> She had a wide career span from the 1930s to the 1970s, and attributed her long career to the fact that, although usually playing classy and glamorous roles, she never became a [[sex symbol]].<ref>\"Rosalind Russell Dies, Fought 15-Year Battle\", ''[[Reading Eagle]]'', November 29, 1976, p. 34</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nCatherine Rosalind Russell was one of seven children born in Waterbury, Connecticut to James Edward, a lawyer,<ref>1910 United States Federal Census</ref> and Clara A.

Her parents thought Russell was studying to become a teacher, and were unaware that she was planning to become an actress.<ref name=\"showgirl\">\"Show Girls Get Training in Colleges\", ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'', December 3, 1930, p. 24</ref> Upon graduation from the performing arts school, Russell acted in [[Summer stock theatre|summer stock]] and joined a repertory company in Boston.\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nRussell began her career as a fashion model and was in many Broadway shows. Against parental objections, she took a job at a stock company for seven months at Saranac Lake, New York and then Hartford, Connecticut.<ref name=\"showgirl\"/> Afterwards, she moved to Boston, where she acted for a year at a theater group for [[Edward E. Clive]]. Later, she appeared in a revue in New York (''[[The Garrick Gaieties]]''). There, she took voice lessons and built a career in the opera, which was short-lived due to her difficulty in reaching high notes.<ref name=\"showgirl\"/>\n\nIn the early 1930s, Russell went west to Los Angeles, where she was hired as a contract player for [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]]. When she first arrived on the lot, she was ignored by most of the crew and later told the press she felt terrible and humiliated at Universal, which affected her self-confidence.<ref name=\"stand\">\"Take the Stand, Rosalind Russell\" by Ed Sullivan, ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'', July 14, 1939, p. 27</ref> Unhappy with Universal's leadership, and second-class studio status at the time, Russell set her sights on [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], and was able to get out of her Universal contract on her own terms. When MGM first approached her for a screen test, Russell was wary, remembering her experience at Universal. However, when she met MGM's [[Benny Thau]] and Ben Piazza, she was surprised, as they were \"the soul of understanding\".<ref name=\"stand\" /> Her screen test was directed by [[Harold S. Bucquet]], and she later recalled that she was hired because of a closeup he took of her.<ref name=\"stand\" />\n\n[[File:RozRussell&NormaShearer.jpg|right|thumb|In ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939) with [[Norma Shearer]] ]]\n\nUnder contract to MGM, Russell debuted in ''[[Evelyn Prentice]]'' (1934). Although the role was small, she received good notices, with one critic saying that she was \"convincing as the woman scorned\".<ref>\"William Powell, Myrna Loy Score on Capitol Screen\", ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', November 19, 1934, p. 12</ref> She starred in many comedies such as ''[[Forsaking All Others]]'' (1934) and ''[[Four's a Crowd]]'' (1938), as well as dramas, including ''[[Craig's Wife (film)|Craig's Wife]]'' (1936) (which would be the film's second of three remakes; [[Joan Crawford]] did the third) and ''[[The Citadel (1938 film)|The Citadel]]'' (1938). Russell was acclaimed when she co-starred with [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]] in the MGM drama ''[[West Point of the Air]]'' (1935). One critic wrote: \"Rosalind Russell as the 'other woman' in the story gives an intelligent and deft handling to her scenes with [[Robert Young (actor)|Young]].\"<ref>\"Amusements\", ''The Daily Times: Rochester and Beaver'', August 11, 1935, p. 9</ref> She quickly rose to fame, and by 1935, was seen as a replacement for actress [[Myrna Loy]], as she took many roles for which Loy initially was set.<ref>\"For Your Amusement\" by Miriam Bell, ''[[The Miami News]]'', October 30, 1935, p. 11</ref>\n\nIn her first years in Hollywood, Russell was characterized, both in her personal life and film career, as a sophisticated lady. This dissatisfied Russell, who claimed in a 1936 interview:\n\n<blockquote>Being typed as a lady is the greatest misfortune possible to a motion picture actress. It limits your characterizations, confines you to play feminine sops and menaces and the public never highly approves of either. An impeccably dressed lady is always viewed with suspicion in real life and when you strut onto the screen with beautiful clothes and charming manners, the most naive of theatergoers senses immediately that you are in a position to do the hero no good. I earnestly want to get away from this. First, because I want to improve my career and professional life and, secondly because I am tired of being a clothes horse - a sort of hothouse orchid in a stand of wild flowers.<ref name=\"sock\">\"Rosalind Russell Yearns To Be Socked on Her Chin\", ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', March 3, 1936, p. 16</ref></blockquote>\n\nRussell approached director [[Frank Lloyd]] for help changing her image, but instead of helping her, Lloyd cast her as a wealthy aristocrat in ''[[Under Two Flags (1936 film)|Under Two Flags]]'' (1936).<ref name=\"sock\"/> She was cast as catty gossip Sylvia Fowler in the all-female comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939), directed by [[George Cukor]]. The film was a major hit, boosting her career and establishing her reputation as a comedian.\n\n[[File:hgf3.jpg|thumb|left|With [[Cary Grant]] and [[Ralph Bellamy]] in ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940)]]\nRussell continued to display her talent for comedy in the classic [[screwball comedy]] ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940), directed by [[Howard Hawks]]. In the film, a reworking of Ben Hecht's story ''The Front Page'', Russell played quick-witted ace reporter Hildy Johnson, who was also the ex-wife of her newspaper editor Walter Burns ([[Cary Grant]]). Russell had been, as she put it, \"Everyone's fifteenth choice\" for the role of Hildy in the film. Before her being cast, Howard Hawks had asked [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Irene Dunne]], [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Jean Arthur]], [[Margaret Sullavan]], and [[Ginger Rogers]] if they would like to play the brash, fast-talking reporter in his film. All of them refused.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/206/His-Girl-Friday/articles.html|title=His Girl Friday (1940) - Articles - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref> Russell found out about this while riding on a train to New York, when she read an article in ''The New York Times'' stating that she had been cast in the film and listing all the actresses who had turned the part down.\n{{-}}\n\n===Later career===\nIn the 1940s, she made comedies such as ''[[The Feminine Touch (1941 film)|The Feminine Touch]]'' (1941), ''[[Take a Letter, Darling]]'' and ''[[My Sister Eileen (1942 film)|My Sister Eileen]]'' (both 1942), dramas including ''[[Sister Kenny]]'' (1946) and ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra (film)|Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' (1947), and a murder mystery: ''[[The Velvet Touch]]'' (1948).\n\n[[File:Rosalind-Russell-TIME-1953.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rosalind Russell in ''[[Wonderful Town]]'', on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (March 30, 1953)]]\n\nRussell scored a big hit on Broadway with her [[Tony Award]]-winning performance in ''Wonderful Town'' (1953), a musical version of her successful film of a decade earlier, ''My Sister Eileen''. Russell reprised her starring role for a 1958 television special.\n\n[[File:RozRussellAuntieMame.jpg|thumb|upright|Rosalind Russell (left) and [[Polly Rowles]] in the original Broadway production of ''Auntie Mame'' (1957)]]\n\nPerhaps her most memorable performance was in the title role of the long-running stage comedy ''[[Auntie Mame#Adaptations|Auntie Mame]]'' (based on a [[Patrick Dennis]] novel) as well as the [[Auntie Mame (film)|1958 film version]], in which she played an eccentric aunt whose orphaned nephew comes to live with her. When asked with which role she was most closely identified, she replied that strangers who spotted her still called out, \"Hey, Auntie Mame!\" She received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Play in 1957 for her performance. Patrick Dennis dedicated his second Auntie Mame novel ''[[Around the World with Auntie Mame]]'' to \"the one and only Rosalind Russell\" in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Passafiume|first1=Andrea|title=Pop Culture 101: Auntie Mame|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/615715%7C0/Pop-Culture-101-Auntie-Mame.html|website=TCM.com|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=28 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nShe continued to appear in movies through the mid-1960s, including ''[[Picnic (1955 film)|Picnic]]'' (1955), ''[[A Majority of One]]'' (1961), ''[[Five Finger Exercise (film)|Five Finger Exercise]]'' (1962), ''[[Gypsy (1962 film)|Gypsy]]'' (1962), and ''[[The Trouble with Angels (film)|The Trouble with Angels]]'' (1966). Russell was the logical choice for reprising her role as Auntie Mame when the musical version ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'' was set for a production on Broadway in 1966, but she declined for health reasons. In addition to her acting career, Russell also wrote the story (under the name C.A. McKnight) for the film ''[[The Unguarded Moment (film)|The Unguarded Moment]]'' (1956), a story of sexual harassment starring [[Esther Williams]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stafford|first1=Jeff|title=The Unguarded Moment|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/382966%7C382074/The-Unguarded-Moment.html|website=TCM.com|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=28 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\nOver the course of her career, Russell earned four Academy Award nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]: ''[[My Sister Eileen (1942 film)|My Sister Eileen]]'' (1942); ''Sister Kenny'' (1946); ''Mourning Becomes Electra'' (1947); and ''[[Auntie Mame (film)|Auntie Mame]]'' (1958), the film version of her Broadway comedy hit. She received a Special Academy Award, the [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]], in 1972, which came with an Oscar statuette.\n\n==Personal life==\nOn October 25, 1941, Russell married Danish-American producer Frederick Brisson (1912-84), son of actor [[Carl Brisson]].<ref>{{cite journal|date=1941-11-10|title=People|journal=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|publisher=Time, Inc.|page=51|issn=0024-3019}}</ref> [[Cary Grant]] was responsible for the couple's having met, and was the best man at Frederick and Rosalind's wedding. Brisson had been traveling from England to the United States by ship in 1939, and ''The Women'' was playing on an endless loop during the voyage. After hearing the audio for the film day after day while traveling, Brisson decided he had better sit down and watch the whole film. He became so enamored with Russell's performance as Sylvia Fowler that he turned to his friends and proclaimed: \"I'm either gonna kill that girl, or I'm gonna marry her\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|title=Life Is a Banquet|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeisbanquet00russ|url-access=registration|last=Russell|first=Rosalind|author2=Chase, Chris |year=1977|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-394-42134-6|oclc=3017310}}</ref>\n\nBrisson stayed with Cary Grant in his guest house while Grant was filming ''His Girl Friday''. Upon hearing that Grant was making the movie with Russell, Brisson asked his friend if he could meet her.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Cary Grant then spent weeks greeting Russell each morning on set with the question \"Have you met Freddie Brisson?\" in an effort to pique the actress's curiosity. One night, when Russell opened her door to let Grant in before they went dancing, as they often did, she found him standing next to a stranger. Grant sheepishly explained that the odd fellow was Freddie Brisson, the man whom he had mentioned so often, and they set off for dinner, with Freddie in tow.\n\nRussell and Brisson's marriage lasted 35 years, ending with her death.

Her parents thought Russell was studying to become a teacher, and were unaware that she was planning to become an actress.<ref name=\"showgirl\">\"Show Girls Get Training in Colleges\", ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'', December 3, 1930, p. 24</ref> Upon graduation from the performing arts school, Russell acted in [[Summer stock theatre|summer stock]] and joined a repertory company in Boston.\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nRussell began her career as a fashion model and was in many Broadway shows. Against parental objections, she took a job at a stock company for seven months at Saranac Lake, New York and then Hartford, Connecticut.<ref name=\"showgirl\"/> Afterwards, she moved to Boston, where she acted for a year at a theater group for [[Edward E. Clive]]. Later, she appeared in a revue in New York (''[[The Garrick Gaieties]]''). There, she took voice lessons and built a career in the opera, which was short-lived due to her difficulty in reaching high notes.<ref name=\"showgirl\"/>\n\nIn the early 1930s, Russell went west to Los Angeles, where she was hired as a contract player for [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]]. When she first arrived on the lot, she was ignored by most of the crew and later told the press she felt terrible and humiliated at Universal, which affected her self-confidence.<ref name=\"stand\">\"Take the Stand, Rosalind Russell\" by Ed Sullivan, ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'', July 14, 1939, p. 27</ref> Unhappy with Universal's leadership, and second-class studio status at the time, Russell set her sights on [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], and was able to get out of her Universal contract on her own terms. When MGM first approached her for a screen test, Russell was wary, remembering her experience at Universal. However, when she met MGM's [[Benny Thau]] and Ben Piazza, she was surprised, as they were \"the soul of understanding\".<ref name=\"stand\" /> Her screen test was directed by [[Harold S. Bucquet]], and she later recalled that she was hired because of a closeup he took of her.<ref name=\"stand\" />\n\n[[File:RozRussell&NormaShearer.jpg|right|thumb|In ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939) with [[Norma Shearer]] ]]\n\nUnder contract to MGM, Russell debuted in ''[[Evelyn Prentice]]'' (1934). Although the role was small, she received good notices, with one critic saying that she was \"convincing as the woman scorned\".<ref>\"William Powell, Myrna Loy Score on Capitol Screen\", ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', November 19, 1934, p. 12</ref> She starred in many comedies such as ''[[Forsaking All Others]]'' (1934) and ''[[Four's a Crowd]]'' (1938), as well as dramas, including ''[[Craig's Wife (film)|Craig's Wife]]'' (1936) (which would be the film's second of three remakes; [[Joan Crawford]] did the third) and ''[[The Citadel (1938 film)|The Citadel]]'' (1938). Russell was acclaimed when she co-starred with [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]] in the MGM drama ''[[West Point of the Air]]'' (1935). One critic wrote: \"Rosalind Russell as the 'other woman' in the story gives an intelligent and deft handling to her scenes with [[Robert Young (actor)|Young]].\"<ref>\"Amusements\", ''The Daily Times: Rochester and Beaver'', August 11, 1935, p. 9</ref> She quickly rose to fame, and by 1935, was seen as a replacement for actress [[Myrna Loy]], as she took many roles for which Loy initially was set.<ref>\"For Your Amusement\" by Miriam Bell, ''[[The Miami News]]'', October 30, 1935, p. 11</ref>\n\nIn her first years in Hollywood, Russell was characterized, both in her personal life and film career, as a sophisticated lady. This dissatisfied Russell, who claimed in a 1936 interview:\n\n<blockquote>Being typed as a lady is the greatest misfortune possible to a motion picture actress. It limits your characterizations, confines you to play feminine sops and menaces and the public never highly approves of either. An impeccably dressed lady is always viewed with suspicion in real life and when you strut onto the screen with beautiful clothes and charming manners, the most naive of theatergoers senses immediately that you are in a position to do the hero no good. I earnestly want to get away from this. First, because I want to improve my career and professional life and, secondly because I am tired of being a clothes horse - a sort of hothouse orchid in a stand of wild flowers.<ref name=\"sock\">\"Rosalind Russell Yearns To Be Socked on Her Chin\", ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', March 3, 1936, p. 16</ref></blockquote>\n\nRussell approached director [[Frank Lloyd]] for help changing her image, but instead of helping her, Lloyd cast her as a wealthy aristocrat in ''[[Under Two Flags (1936 film)|Under Two Flags]]'' (1936).<ref name=\"sock\"/> She was cast as catty gossip Sylvia Fowler in the all-female comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939), directed by [[George Cukor]]. The film was a major hit, boosting her career and establishing her reputation as a comedian.\n\n[[File:hgf3.jpg|thumb|left|With [[Cary Grant]] and [[Ralph Bellamy]] in ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940)]]\nRussell continued to display her talent for comedy in the classic [[screwball comedy]] ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940), directed by [[Howard Hawks]]. In the film, a reworking of Ben Hecht's story ''The Front Page'', Russell played quick-witted ace reporter Hildy Johnson, who was also the ex-wife of her newspaper editor Walter Burns ([[Cary Grant]]). Russell had been, as she put it, \"Everyone's fifteenth choice\" for the role of Hildy in the film. Before her being cast, Howard Hawks had asked [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Irene Dunne]], [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Jean Arthur]], [[Margaret Sullavan]], and [[Ginger Rogers]] if they would like to play the brash, fast-talking reporter in his film. All of them refused.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/206/His-Girl-Friday/articles.html|title=His Girl Friday (1940) - Articles - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref> Russell found out about this while riding on a train to New York, when she read an article in ''The New York Times'' stating that she had been cast in the film and listing all the actresses who had turned the part down.\n{{-}}\n\n===Later career===\nIn the 1940s, she made comedies such as ''[[The Feminine Touch (1941 film)|The Feminine Touch]]'' (1941), ''[[Take a Letter, Darling]]'' and ''[[My Sister Eileen (1942 film)|My Sister Eileen]]'' (both 1942), dramas including ''[[Sister Kenny]]'' (1946) and ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra (film)|Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' (1947), and a murder mystery: ''[[The Velvet Touch]]'' (1948).\n\n[[File:Rosalind-Russell-TIME-1953.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rosalind Russell in ''[[Wonderful Town]]'', on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (March 30, 1953)]]\n\nRussell scored a big hit on Broadway with her [[Tony Award]]-winning performance in ''Wonderful Town'' (1953), a musical version of her successful film of a decade earlier, ''My Sister Eileen''. Russell reprised her starring role for a 1958 television special.\n\n[[File:RozRussellAuntieMame.jpg|thumb|upright|Rosalind Russell (left) and [[Polly Rowles]] in the original Broadway production of ''Auntie Mame'' (1957)]]\n\nPerhaps her most memorable performance was in the title role of the long-running stage comedy ''[[Auntie Mame#Adaptations|Auntie Mame]]'' (based on a [[Patrick Dennis]] novel) as well as the [[Auntie Mame (film)|1958 film version]], in which she played an eccentric aunt whose orphaned nephew comes to live with her. When asked with which role she was most closely identified, she replied that strangers who spotted her still called out, \"Hey, Auntie Mame!\" She received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Play in 1957 for her performance. Patrick Dennis dedicated his second Auntie Mame novel ''[[Around the World with Auntie Mame]]'' to \"the one and only Rosalind Russell\" in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Passafiume|first1=Andrea|title=Pop Culture 101: Auntie Mame|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/615715%7C0/Pop-Culture-101-Auntie-Mame.html|website=TCM.com|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=28 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nShe continued to appear in movies through the mid-1960s, including ''[[Picnic (1955 film)|Picnic]]'' (1955), ''[[A Majority of One]]'' (1961), ''[[Five Finger Exercise (film)|Five Finger Exercise]]'' (1962), ''[[Gypsy (1962 film)|Gypsy]]'' (1962), and ''[[The Trouble with Angels (film)|The Trouble with Angels]]'' (1966). Russell was the logical choice for reprising her role as Auntie Mame when the musical version ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'' was set for a production on Broadway in 1966, but she declined for health reasons. In addition to her acting career, Russell also wrote the story (under the name C.A.

Brisson had been traveling from England to the United States by ship in 1939, and ''The Women'' was playing on an endless loop during the voyage. After hearing the audio for the film day after day while traveling, Brisson decided he had better sit down and watch the whole film. He became so enamored with Russell's performance as Sylvia Fowler that he turned to his friends and proclaimed: \"I'm either gonna kill that girl, or I'm gonna marry her\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|title=Life Is a Banquet|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeisbanquet00russ|url-access=registration|last=Russell|first=Rosalind|author2=Chase, Chris |year=1977|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-394-42134-6|oclc=3017310}}</ref>\n\nBrisson stayed with Cary Grant in his guest house while Grant was filming ''His Girl Friday''. Upon hearing that Grant was making the movie with Russell, Brisson asked his friend if he could meet her.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Cary Grant then spent weeks greeting Russell each morning on set with the question \"Have you met Freddie Brisson?\" in an effort to pique the actress's curiosity. One night, when Russell opened her door to let Grant in before they went dancing, as they often did, she found him standing next to a stranger. Grant sheepishly explained that the odd fellow was Freddie Brisson, the man whom he had mentioned so often, and they set off for dinner, with Freddie in tow.\n\nRussell and Brisson's marriage lasted 35 years, ending with her death.
