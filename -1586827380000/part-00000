He is also Professor (Emeritus) at Stanford University and National Institute of Informatics (Tokyo). \n\n== Biography ==\nYamamoto was born in [[Tokyo]] on November 21, 1950. In 1973 he received his B.S. degree from [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]]. He continued his studies at [[the University of Tokyo]] where he received his M.S. in 1975 and Ph.D. in 1978. From 1978 to 1992, he worked at NTT Basic Research Laboratories in Tokyo. Since 1992, he has been a professor of applied physics and electrical engineering at [[Stanford University]] in the United States and currently a professor (emeritus). Since 2003, he also has been a professor at [[National Institute of Informatics]] in Tokyo and currently a professor (emeritus). In 2019, he became a founding director of NTT PHI Labs in Silicon Valley, California, the United States.\n\n== Work ==\n\nYamamoto's scientific focuses in the 1980s were [[fiber-optic communication|coherent optical fiber communications]], [[squeezing|photon number squeezing in semiconductor lasers]], [[Quantum nondemolition measurement|quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements]] and other experimental [[Quantum optics| quantum optics]] subjects. One of Yamamoto's key works from this era is arguably the first proposal for how to physically realize photon number squeezing,<ref name=\"Yamamoto1986 Machida1987\"/> QND measurement<ref name=\"Imoto1985\"/> and a quantum computer.<ref name=\"qc1988\">K.
