The varieties of English people, as opposed to the other peoples on the British Isles, were the overwhelming majority ethnic group in the 17th century (population of the colonies in 1700 was 250,000) and were 47.9% of percent of the total population  of 3. 9 million. They constituted 60% of the whites at the first census in 1790 (%: 3.5 Welsh, 8.5 [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]], 4.3 Scots, 4.7 Southern Irish, 7.2 German, 2.7 Dutch, 1.7 French and 2 Swedish), The American Revolution, Colin Bonwick, 1991, p.&nbsp;254. The English ethnic group contributed the major cultural and social mindset and attitudes that evolved into the American character. Of the total population in each colony they numbered from 30% in Pennsylvania to 85% in Massachusetts, Becoming America, Jon Butler, 2000, pp.&nbsp;9\u201311. Large non-English immigrant populations from the 1720s to 1775, such as the Germans (100,000 or more), Scotch Irish (250,000), added enriched and modified the English cultural substrate, The Encyclopedia of Colonial and Revolutionary America, Ed. John Mack Faragher, 1990, pp.&nbsp;200\u2013202. The religious outlook was some versions of Protestantism (1.6% of the population were English, German and Irish Catholics ).\n\n[[Jeffersonian democracy]] was a foundational American cultural innovation, which is still a core part of the country's identity.<ref name=MJ>[https://books.google.com/books?id=nf22_zMVdqsC&dq \"Mr. Jefferson and the giant moose: natural history in early America\"], Lee Alan Dugatkin.

[[Latin American culture]] is especially pronounced in former Spanish areas but has also been introduced by immigration, as has [[Asian American culture]]s (especially on the West Coast). \n\nNative culture remains strong in areas with large undisturbed or relocated populations, including traditional government and communal organization of property now legally managed by [[Indian reservations]] (large reservations are mostly in the West, especially [[Arizona]] and [[South Dakota]]).  The fate of native culture after contact with Europeans is quite varied.  For example, [[Ta\u00edno]] culture in U.S. Caribbean territories is nearly extinct and like most Native American languages, the [[Ta\u00edno language]] is no longer spoken.  In contrast the [[Hawaiian language]] and [[culture of the Native Hawaiians]] has survived in [[Hawaii]] and mixed with that of immigrants from the mainland U.S. (starting before the [[Newlands Resolution|1898 annexation]]) and to some degree Japanese immigrants. It occasionally influences mainstream American culture with notable exports like [[surfing]] and [[Hawaiian shirt]]s.  Most languages native to what is now U.S. territory have gone extinct, and the economic and mainstream cultural dominance of English threatens the surviving ones in most places.  The most common native languages include [[Samoan language|Samoan]], [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Navajo language]], [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]], [[Sioux language|Sioux]], and a spectrum of [[Inuit languages]].

Despite certain consistent ideological principles (e.g. [[individualism]], [[egalitarianism]], and faith in [[freedom]] and [[democracy]]), American culture has a variety of expressions due to its geographical scale and demographic diversity.

The later eighteenth century was a time when the United States was just an infant as a nation and was far away from the phenomenon where artists would receive training as craftsmen by apprenticeship and later seeking a fortune as a professional, ideally getting a patron: Many artists benefited from the patronage of Grand Tourists eager to procure mementos of their travels. There were no temples of Rome or grand nobility to be found in the Thirteen Colonies. Later developments of the 19th century brought America one of its earliest native home grown movements, like the [[Hudson River School]] and portrait artists with a unique American flavor like [[Winslow Homer]].\n\nA parallel development taking shape in rural America was the [[American craft]] movement, which began as a reaction to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. As the nation grew wealthier, it had patrons able to buy the works of European painters and attract foreign talent willing to teach methods and techniques from Europe to willing students as well as artists themselves; photography became a very popular medium for both journalism and in time as a medium in its own right with America having a great deal of open spaces of natural beauty and growing cities in the East teeming with new arrivals and new buildings. Museums in [[Chicago]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] began to have a booming business in acquisitions, competing for works as diverse as the then more recent work of the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] to pieces from [[Ancient Egypt]], all of which captured the public imaginations and further influenced fashion and architecture.  Developments in modern art in Europe came to America from exhibitions in New York City such as the [[Armory Show]] in 1913. After World War II, New York emerged as a center of the art world. Painting in the United States today covers a vast range of styles. American painting includes works by [[Jackson Pollock]], [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], and [[Norman Rockwell]], among many others.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture of the United States}}\n[[File:Empire State Building from the Top of the Rock.jpg|alt=Empire State building, seen from the neighboring Rockafeller Center|thumb|upright|The [[Art Deco]] [[architectural style]] of the [[Empire State Building]] was typical of such buildings of the period]]\n\nArchitecture in the United States is regionally diverse and has been shaped by many external forces.

This culminated in cultural milestones such as the [[Apollo program|Apollo moon landings]], the creation of the Personal Computer, and the sequencing effort called the [[Human Genome Project]].\n\nThroughout its history, American culture has made significant gains through the open immigration of accomplished scientists. Accomplished scientists include: Scottish-American scientist [[Alexander Graham Bell]], who developed and patented the telephone and other devices; German scientist [[Charles Steinmetz]], who developed new alternating-current electrical systems in 1889; Russian scientist [[Vladimir Zworykin]], who invented the motion camera in 1919; Serb scientist [[Nikola Tesla]] who patented a brushless electrical [[induction motor]] based on rotating magnetic fields in 1888. With the rise of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] party in Germany, a large number of Jewish scientists fled Germany and immigrated to the country, including theoretical physicist [[Albert Einstein]] in 1933.\n\nIn the years during and following WWII, several innovative scientists immigrated to the U.S. from Europe, such as [[Enrico Fermi]], who came from [[Italy]] in 1938 and led the work that produced the world's first self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]]. Post-war Europe saw many of its scientists, such as rocket scientist [[Wernher von Braun]], recruited by the United States as part of [[Operation Paperclip]].{{Relevance inline|date=October 2012}}\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Education in the United States|Educational attainment in the United States}}\n[[File:Higher education in the US by race.svg|thumb|Higher education in the US by race as of 2003|188x188px]]\n\nEducation in the United States is and has historically been provided mainly by government. Control and funding come from three levels: [[Federal government of the United States|federal]], [[State government|state]], and [[Local government|local]]. School attendance is mandatory and nearly universal at the elementary and high school levels (often known outside the United States as the primary and secondary levels).\n\nStudents have the options of having their education held in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s, private schools, or [[homeschooling|home school]]. In most public and private schools, education is divided into three levels: [[Primary education in the United States|elementary school]], [[Middle school|junior high school]] (also often called middle school), and [[Secondary education in the United States|high school]]. In almost all schools at these levels, children are divided by age groups into [[Grade levels|grades]]. [[Post-secondary education]], better known as \"college\" in the United States, is generally governed separately from the elementary and high school system.\n\nIn the year 2000, there were 76.6&nbsp;million students enrolled in schools from [[kindergarten]] through [[graduate school]]s. Of these, 72 percent aged 12 to 17 were judged academically \"on track\" for their age (enrolled in school at or above grade level). Of those enrolled in compulsory education, 5.2&nbsp;million (10.4 percent) were attending private schools. Among the country's adult population, over 85 percent have completed high school and 27 percent have received a [[bachelor's degree]] or higher.<ref>{{cite web|title=US High school census data|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/censusandstatistics/a/highschool.htm|accessdate=September 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709223701/http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/censusandstatistics/a/highschool.htm|archive-date=July 9, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{Main|Religion in the United States}}\n{{See also|American civil religion|Ceremonial deism|In God We Trust|Puritans}}\n[[File:Mission-Concepcion.jpg|thumb|left|Completed in 1716, [[San Antonio Missions National Historical Park]] is one of numerous surviving colonial [[List of Spanish missions|Spanish missions]] in the United States.

Examples are popular culture obsessions with confession and forgiveness, which extends from [[reality television]] to [[twelve-step meeting]]s. Americans expect public figures to confess and have public [[penitence]] for any sins or moral wrongdoings they may have caused.

It evolved from the English [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrim's]] custom of giving thanks for one's welfare. Thanksgiving is generally celebrated as a family reunion with a large afternoon feast. [[Christmas Day]], celebrating the birth of [[Jesus Christ]], is widely celebrated and a federal holiday, though a fair amount of its current cultural importance is due to secular reasons. [[British colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] has led to some other Christian holidays such as [[Easter]] and [[St. Patrick's Day]] to be observed, though with varying degrees of religious fidelity.\n\n[[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] (also known as the Fourth of July) celebrates the anniversary of the country's [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] from Great Britain. It is generally observed by parades throughout the day and the shooting of fireworks at night.\n\n[[Halloween]] is thought to have evolved from the ancient Celtic/Gaelic festival of [[Samhain]], which was introduced in the American colonies by Irish settlers. It has become a holiday that is celebrated by children and teens who traditionally dress up in costumes and go door to door trick-or-treating for candy. It also brings about an emphasis on eerie and frightening [[urban legends]] and movies.\n\nAdditionally, [[Mardi Gras]], which evolved from the Catholic tradition of [[Carnival]], is observed in New Orleans, [[St. Louis]], [[Mobile, Alabama]], and numerous other towns.\n\nFederally recognized holidays are as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

The states of Louisiana and Mississippi, for example, is known for their [[Cajun cuisine|Cajun]] and [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole cooking]]. Cajun and Creole cooking are influenced by French, Acadian, and Haitian cooking, although the dishes themselves are original and unique. Examples include Crawfish Etouffee, Red Beans and Rice, Seafood or Chicken Gumbo, Jambalaya, and Boudin. Italian, German, Hungarian and Chinese influences, traditional Native American, Caribbean, Mexican and Greek dishes have also diffused into the general American repertoire. It is not uncommon for a \"middle-class\" family from \"middle America\" to eat, for example, restaurant pizza, home-made pizza, enchiladas con carne, chicken paprikas, beef stroganof and bratwurst with sauerkraut for dinner throughout a single week.\n\n[[Soul food]], mostly the same as food eaten by white southerners, developed by southern African slaves, and their free descendants, is popular around the South and among many [[African-Americans]] elsewhere. [[Syncretism|Syncretic]] cuisines such as Louisiana creole, Cajun, [[Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine|Pennsylvania Dutch]], and [[Tex-Mex cuisine|Tex-Mex]] are regionally important. Iconic American dishes such as [[apple pie]], [[fried chicken]], [[pizza]], [[hamburger]]s, and [[hot dog]]s derive from the recipes of various immigrants and domestic innovations.

Although the [[nuclear family]] concept (two-married adults with biological children) holds a special place in the mindset of Americans, it is single-parent families, [[childless]] couples, and fused families which now constitute the majority of families.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  A person may grow up in a single-parent family, go on to marry and live in childless couple arrangement, then get divorced, live as a single for a couple of years, remarry, have children and live in a nuclear family arrangement.<ref name=\"Society in Focus\"/><ref name=\"Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships\"/>\n\n<blockquote>The nuclear family... is the idealized version of what most people think when they think of \"family...\" The old definition of what a family is... the nuclear family- no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today, according to many social scientists (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). Thus has arisen the term ''postmodern family'', which is meant to describe the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families and child-free couples.- Brian K.

In the single-parent household, one parent typically raises the children with little to no help at all, from the other. This parent is the sole \"breadwinner\" of the family and thus, these households are particularly vulnerable economically. They have higher rates of [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]], and children of these households are more likely to have educational problems.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n===Youth dependence===\nOther changes to the landscape of American family arrangements include dual-income earner households and delayed independence among American youths. Whereas most families in the 1950s and 1960s relied on one income earner, most commonly the husband, the vast majority of family households now have two-income earners.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}{{clarify|reason=how does two incomes affect youth dependence?|date=August 2013}}\n\nAnother change is the increasing age at which young Americans leave their parental home. Traditionally, a person past \"college age\" who lived with their parent(s) was viewed negatively, but today it is not uncommon for children to live with their parents until their mid-twenties. This trend can be mostly attributed to rising [[Real estate pricing|living costs]] that are more expensive compared to those in decades past. Thus, many young adults now remain with their parents well past their mid-twenties. This topic was a cover article of TIME magazine in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nExceptions to the custom of leaving home in one's mid-twenties can occur especially among Italian and Hispanic Americans, and in expensive urban real estate markets such as New York City,<ref>[http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/NY-New-York-Pricing.html New York apartments pricing and New York NY apartment reviews] Apartment Ratings</ref> California,<ref>[http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/CA-San-Francisco-Pricing.html San Francisco apartments pricing and San Francisco CA apartment reviews] Apartment Ratings</ref> and [[Honolulu]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/HI-Honolulu-Pricing.html |title=Honolulu apartments pricing and Honolulu HI apartment reviews |website=Apartmentratings.com |accessdate=2012-06-03}}</ref> where monthly rents commonly exceed $1,000 a month.\n\n==Housing==\n{{Expand section|material about housing pre-World War II|date=August 2016}}\n{{See also|White flight}}\n[[File:831Richland.jpg|thumb|left|The [[American Foursquare]] was a popular house style from the late 19th century until the 1930s]]\nHistorically, Americans mainly lived in a rural environment, with a few important cities of moderate size. \n\nAmerican cities with housing prices near the national median have also been losing the [[Household income in the United States|middle income]] neighborhoods, those with median income between 80% and 120% of the metropolitan area's median household income. Here, the more affluent members of the middle-class, who are also often referred to as being professional or upper middle-class, have left in search of larger homes in more exclusive suburbs. This trend is largely attributed to the ''[[American middle class#Middle class squeeze|Middle-class squeeze]]'', which has caused a starker distinction between the [[American middle class#statistical middle class|statistical middle class]] and the more privileged members of the [[American middle class|middle class]].<ref name=\"Washington Post, America is losing its middle income neighborhoods\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/21/AR2006062101735.html|title=Washington Post, America is losing its middle income neighborhoods|accessdate=2006-07-25 | work=The Washington Post | first=Blaine | last=Harden | date=June 22, 2006}}</ref> In more expensive areas such as California, however, another trend has been taking place where an influx of more affluent middle-class households has displaced those in the actual middle of society and converted former [[American middle class#statistical middle class|middle-middle-class]] neighborhoods into [[Upper middle class#American upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] neighborhoods.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/21/AR2006062101735.html|title=Washington Post, America is losing its middle income neighborhoods.|accessdate=2006-07-25 | work=The Washington Post | first=Blaine | last=Harden | date=June 22, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe population of rural areas has been declining over time as more and more people migrate to cities for work and entertainment. The great exodus from the farms came in the 1940s; in recent years fewer than 2% of the population lives on farms (though others live in the countryside and commute to work). Electricity and telephones, and sometimes cable and Internet services are available to all but the most remote regions.\n\n[[File:Cincinnati-suburbs-tract-housing.jpg|thumb|Suburban [[tract housing]] in [[Northern Kentucky]] near [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]]]\nAbout half of Americans now live in what is known as the suburbs. The suburban nuclear family has been identified as part of the \"[[American Dream]]\": a married couple with children owning a house in the suburbs. This archetype is reinforced by mass media, religious practices, and government policies and is based on traditions from Anglo-Saxon cultures. One of the biggest differences in suburban living as compared to urban living; is the housing occupied by the families. The suburbs are filled with single-family homes separated from retail districts, industrial areas, and sometimes even public schools. However, many American suburbs are incorporating these districts on smaller scales, attracting more people to these communities.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nHousing in urban areas may include more [[apartment]]s and semi-attached homes than in the suburbs or small towns. Aside from housing, the major differences from suburban living are the density and diversity of many different subcultures, and retail and manufacturing buildings mixed with housing in urban areas.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n==Transport==\n{{main|Transportation in the United States}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| header = \n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background = \n| footer_background = \n| width = \n| image1 = Plot of Numbers of Registered Vehicles in the United States by Year.png\n| width1 = 500\n| caption1 = Plot of Numbers of Automobiles in the United States by Year\n| alt1 = \n| image2 = NorthAmericanPublicTransport.png\n| width2 = 500\n| caption2 = NorthAmericanPublicTransport}}\n===Automobiles and commuting===\n{{Main|Technological and industrial history of the United States|Passenger vehicles in the United States}}\n[[File:1965 Ford Mustang Fastback (15595256971).jpg|thumb|\"[[Pony car]]\": 1965 [[Ford Mustang]] \"fastback\", introduced in September 1964 for the 1965 model year]]\nThere is low overall population density and [[urban sprawl]], [[Marchetti's constant|because]] the United States is one of the few developed nations where most people commute by car.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe rise of suburbs and the need for workers to commute to cities brought about the popularity of automobiles.

The funeral ceremony varies according to religion and culture. American Catholics typically hold a [[Catholic funeral|funeral mass]] in a church, which sometimes takes the form of a [[Requiem]] mass. Jewish Americans may hold a service in a synagogue or temple. [[Pallbearer]]s carry the coffin of the deceased to the [[hearse]], which then proceeds in a [[procession]] to the place of final repose, usually a cemetery.

Rows of [[grave (burial)|grave]]s are covered by [[lawn]]s and are interspersed with trees and flowers. [[Headstone]]s, [[mausoleum]]s, statuary or simple plaques typically mark off the individual graves. [[Cremation]] is another common practice in the United States, though it is frowned upon by various religions. The ashes of the deceased are usually placed in an [[urn]], which may be kept in a private house, or they are interred. Sometimes the ashes are released into the atmosphere. The \"sprinkling\" or \"scattering\" of the ashes may be part of an informal ceremony, often taking place at a scenic natural feature (a cliff, lake or mountain) that was favored by the deceased.\n\nA so-called [[death industry]] has developed in the United States that has replaced earlier, more informal traditions. Before the popularity of funeral homes, people usually held wakes in the [[parlour]] rooms of private houses.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n==Sociological issues==\n\n===Marriage and divorce===\n{{Main|Marriage in the United States|Divorce in the United States}}\n{{See also|Cohabitation in the United States}}\n[[File:Marilyn Monroe and Jerry Giesler 3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marilyn Monroe]] signing divorce papers with celebrity attorney [[Jerry Giesler]]]]\nMarriage laws are established by individual states. The typical wedding involves a couple proclaiming their commitment to one another in front of their close relatives and friends, often presided over by a religious figure such as a minister, priest, or rabbi, depending upon the faith of the couple. In traditional Christian ceremonies, the bride's father will \"give away\" (hand off) the bride to the groom. Secular weddings are also common, often presided over by a judge, [[Justice of the Peace]], or other municipal official. [[Same-sex marriage]] is legal in all states.\n\n[[Divorce]] is the province of state governments, so divorce law varies from state to state. Prior to the 1970s, divorcing spouses had to allege that the other spouse was guilty of a crime or [[sin]] like abandonment or adultery; when spouses simply could not get along, lawyers were forced to manufacture \"uncontested\" divorces. The [[no-fault divorce]] revolution began in 1969 in California; New York and South Dakota were the [[No-fault divorce#The adoption of no-fault divorce laws by the other states|last states to begin allowing no-fault divorce]]. No-fault divorce on the grounds of \"irreconcilable differences\" is now available in all states. However, many states have recently required separation periods prior to a formal divorce decree.\n\nState law provides for [[child support]] where children are involved, and sometimes for [[alimony]]. \"Married adults now divorce two-and-a-half times as often as adults did 20 years ago and four times as often as they did 50 years ago... between 40% and 60% of ''new'' marriages will eventually end in divorce.

This relationship has historically been the most important one since the founding of the United States. Currently, most African-Americans are descendants of African slaves imported to the United States, though some are more recent immigrants or their descendants. Slavery existed in the United States at the time of the country's formation in the 1770s. The U.S. banned importation of slaves in 1808. Slavery was partially abolished by the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] issued by president [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1862 for slaves in the Southeastern United States during the Civil War. Slavery was rendered illegal by the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. [[Jim Crow Laws]] prevented full use of African American citizenship until the 20th century. The [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] outlawed official or legal segregation in public places or limited access to minorities.\n\nRelations between white Americans and other racial or ethnic groups have been a source of tension at various times in U.S. history. With the advent of European colonization, and continuing into the early years of the republic, relations between whites and Native American was a significant issue. In 1882, in response to Chinese immigration due to the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] and the labor needed for the Transcontinental Railroad, the U.S. signed into law the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] which banned immigration by Chinese people into the U.S. In the late 19th century, the growth of the Hispanic population in the U.S., fueled largely by Mexican immigration, generated debate over policies such as English as the official language and reform to immigration policies.\n\nA huge majority of Americans of all races disapprove of racism. Nevertheless, some Americans continue to hold negative racial/ethnic [[Stereotypes of groups within the United States|stereotypes]] about various racial and ethnic groups. Professor Imani Perry, of [[Princeton University]], has argued that contemporary [[racism]] in the United States \"is frequently unintentional or unacknowledged on the part of the actor\",<ref>Imani Perry, More Beautiful More Terrible: The Embrace and Transcendence of Racial Inequality in the United States, New York University Press: 2011, p7</ref> believing that racism mostly stems unconsciously from below the level of cognition.<ref>Perry, 21</ref>\n\n===Drugs and alcohol===\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}\n{{Further|History of United States drug prohibition}}\n[[File:Just Say No.jpg|thumb|\"Just Say No\" paraphernalia at the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library|Reagan Library]] display]]\n\nAmerican attitudes towards drugs and alcoholic beverages have evolved considerably throughout the country's history. In the 19th century, alcohol was readily available and consumed, and no laws restricted the use of other drugs. Attitudes on drug addiction started to change, resulting in the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act|Harrison Act]], which eventually became proscriptive.\n\nA movement to ban alcoholic beverages, called the [[Temperance movement|Temperance]] movement, emerged in the late 19th century. Several American Protestant religious groups and women's groups, such as the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]], supported the movement. In 1919, Prohibitionists succeeded in [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|amending the Constitution]] to prohibit the sale of alcohol. Although the Prohibition period did result in lowering alcohol consumption overall,{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} banning alcohol outright proved to be unworkable, as the previously legitimate distillery industry was replaced by criminal gangs that trafficked in alcohol. Prohibition [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|was repealed]] in 1933. States and localities retained the right to remain \"dry\", and to this day, [[dry county|a handful]] still do.\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]] era, attitudes swung well away from prohibition. Commentators noted that an 18-year-old could be [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] to war but could not buy a beer.\n\nSince 1980, the trend has been toward greater restrictions on alcohol and drug use. The focus this time, however, has been to criminalize behaviors associated with alcohol, rather than attempt to prohibit consumption outright. New York was the first state to enact tough [[drunk-driving]] laws in 1980; since then all other states have followed suit. All states have also banned the purchase of alcoholic beverages by individuals under 21.\n\nA \"[[Just Say No]] to Drugs\" movement replaced the more liberal ethos of the 1960s.

A sense of national unity and identity was forged out of the victorious [[First Barbary War]], [[Second Barbary War]], and the [[War of 1812]]. Even so, the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]] were suspicious of a permanent military force and not until the outbreak of [[World War II]] did a large standing army become officially established. The [[National Security Act of 1947]], adopted following World War II and during the onset of the Cold War, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level [[United States Department of War|Department of War]] and the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] into the [[United States Department of Defense|National Military Establishment]] (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]] and National Security Council.\n\nThe U.S. military is one of the largest militaries in terms of number of personnel. It draws its manpower from a large pool of paid [[Volunteer military|volunteers]]; although [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] has been used in the past in various times of both war and peace, it has not been used since 1972.

The varieties of English people, as opposed to the other peoples on the British Isles, were the overwhelming majority ethnic group in the 17th century (population of the colonies in 1700 was 250,000) and were 47.9% of percent of the total population  of 3. 9 million. They constituted 60% of the whites at the first census in 1790 (%: 3.5 Welsh, 8.5 [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]], 4.3 Scots, 4.7 Southern Irish, 7.2 German, 2.7 Dutch, 1.7 French and 2 Swedish), The American Revolution, Colin Bonwick, 1991, p.&nbsp;254. The English ethnic group contributed the major cultural and social mindset and attitudes that evolved into the American character. Of the total population in each colony they numbered from 30% in Pennsylvania to 85% in Massachusetts, Becoming America, Jon Butler, 2000, pp.&nbsp;9\u201311. Large non-English immigrant populations from the 1720s to 1775, such as the Germans (100,000 or more), Scotch Irish (250,000), added enriched and modified the English cultural substrate, The Encyclopedia of Colonial and Revolutionary America, Ed. John Mack Faragher, 1990, pp.&nbsp;200\u2013202.

[[Latin American culture]] is especially pronounced in former Spanish areas but has also been introduced by immigration, as has [[Asian American culture]]s (especially on the West Coast). \n\nNative culture remains strong in areas with large undisturbed or relocated populations, including traditional government and communal organization of property now legally managed by [[Indian reservations]] (large reservations are mostly in the West, especially [[Arizona]] and [[South Dakota]]).  The fate of native culture after contact with Europeans is quite varied.  For example, [[Ta\u00edno]] culture in U.S. Caribbean territories is nearly extinct and like most Native American languages, the [[Ta\u00edno language]] is no longer spoken.  In contrast the [[Hawaiian language]] and [[culture of the Native Hawaiians]] has survived in [[Hawaii]] and mixed with that of immigrants from the mainland U.S. (starting before the [[Newlands Resolution|1898 annexation]]) and to some degree Japanese immigrants. It occasionally influences mainstream American culture with notable exports like [[surfing]] and [[Hawaiian shirt]]s.  Most languages native to what is now U.S. territory have gone extinct, and the economic and mainstream cultural dominance of English threatens the surviving ones in most places.  The most common native languages include [[Samoan language|Samoan]], [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Navajo language]], [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]], [[Sioux language|Sioux]], and a spectrum of [[Inuit languages]].

The later eighteenth century was a time when the United States was just an infant as a nation and was far away from the phenomenon where artists would receive training as craftsmen by apprenticeship and later seeking a fortune as a professional, ideally getting a patron: Many artists benefited from the patronage of Grand Tourists eager to procure mementos of their travels. There were no temples of Rome or grand nobility to be found in the Thirteen Colonies. Later developments of the 19th century brought America one of its earliest native home grown movements, like the [[Hudson River School]] and portrait artists with a unique American flavor like [[Winslow Homer]].\n\nA parallel development taking shape in rural America was the [[American craft]] movement, which began as a reaction to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. As the nation grew wealthier, it had patrons able to buy the works of European painters and attract foreign talent willing to teach methods and techniques from Europe to willing students as well as artists themselves; photography became a very popular medium for both journalism and in time as a medium in its own right with America having a great deal of open spaces of natural beauty and growing cities in the East teeming with new arrivals and new buildings. Museums in [[Chicago]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] began to have a booming business in acquisitions, competing for works as diverse as the then more recent work of the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] to pieces from [[Ancient Egypt]], all of which captured the public imaginations and further influenced fashion and architecture.  Developments in modern art in Europe came to America from exhibitions in New York City such as the [[Armory Show]] in 1913. After World War II, New York emerged as a center of the art world. Painting in the United States today covers a vast range of styles. American painting includes works by [[Jackson Pollock]], [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], and [[Norman Rockwell]], among many others.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture of the United States}}\n[[File:Empire State Building from the Top of the Rock.jpg|alt=Empire State building, seen from the neighboring Rockafeller Center|thumb|upright|The [[Art Deco]] [[architectural style]] of the [[Empire State Building]] was typical of such buildings of the period]]\n\nArchitecture in the United States is regionally diverse and has been shaped by many external forces.

However, in recent years, suburbanization and mass migration to the [[Sun Belt]] has allowed architecture to reflect a [[Mediterranean Revival architecture|Mediterranean]] style as well.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n===Theater===\n{{Main|Theater of the United States}}\n{{Expand section|date=October 2012}}\n[[File:Palace theatre NYC.JPG|left|thumb|170x170px|The [[Palace Theatre (New York City)|Palace Theatre]] is part of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], one of the highest levels of commercial theatre in the English-speaking world]]\n[[File:Frank Sinatra and Ronald Reagan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frank Sinatra]] is awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Ronald Reagan]]|171x171px]]Theater of the United States is based in the Western tradition and did not take on a unique dramatic identity until the emergence of [[Eugene O'Neill]] in the early twentieth century, now considered by many to be the father of American drama. O'Neill is a four-time winner of the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for drama and the only American playwright to win the [[Nobel Prize]] for '''literature.''' After O'Neill, American drama came of age and flourished with the likes of [[Arthur Miller]], [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Lillian Hellman]], [[William Inge]], and [[Clifford Odets]] during the first half of the twentieth century. After this fertile period, American theater broke new ground, artistically, with the absurdist forms of [[Edward Albee]] in the 1960s.\n[[File:Elvis Presley 1970-2.jpg|left|thumb|251x251px|[[Elvis Presley]] was an American singer regarded as [[Cultural impact of Elvis Presley|one of the most significant cultural icons]] of the 20th century]]\n[[File:Jay-Z Beyonce.jpg|thumb|205x205px|The Singer Beyonc\u00e9 has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making her one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]].

Writers such as [[Lorraine Hansbury]], [[August Wilson]], [[David Mamet]] and [[Tony Kushner]] have all won [[Pulitzer Prizes]] for their polemical plays on American society. The [[United States]] is also the home and largest exporter of modern [[musical theater]], producing such musical talents as [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]], [[Lerner and Loewe]], [[Cole Porter]], [[Irving Berlin]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Kander and Ebb]], and [[Stephen Sondheim]].

The great American inventors include [[Robert Fulton]] (the [[steamboat]]); [[Samuel Morse]] (the [[telegraph]]); [[Eli Whitney]] (the [[cotton gin]], [[interchangeable parts]]); [[Cyrus McCormick]] (the [[reaper]]); and [[Thomas Edison]] (with more than a thousand inventions credited to his name). Most of the new technological innovations over the 20th and 21st centuries were either first invented in the United States, first widely adopted by Americans, or both. Examples include the [[lightbulb]], the [[airplane]], the [[transistor]], the [[atomic bomb]], [[nuclear power]], the [[personal computer]], the [[iPod]], [[video games]], [[e-commerce|online shopping]], and the development of the [[Internet]].\n\n[[File:Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg|thumb|A replica of the first working transistor|187x187px]]\nThis propensity for application of scientific ideas continued throughout the 20th century with innovations that held strong international benefits. The twentieth century saw the arrival of the [[Space Age]], the [[Information Age]], and a renaissance in the [[health sciences]]. This culminated in cultural milestones such as the [[Apollo program|Apollo moon landings]], the creation of the Personal Computer, and the sequencing effort called the [[Human Genome Project]].\n\nThroughout its history, American culture has made significant gains through the open immigration of accomplished scientists. Accomplished scientists include: Scottish-American scientist [[Alexander Graham Bell]], who developed and patented the telephone and other devices; German scientist [[Charles Steinmetz]], who developed new alternating-current electrical systems in 1889; Russian scientist [[Vladimir Zworykin]], who invented the motion camera in 1919; Serb scientist [[Nikola Tesla]] who patented a brushless electrical [[induction motor]] based on rotating magnetic fields in 1888. With the rise of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] party in Germany, a large number of Jewish scientists fled Germany and immigrated to the country, including theoretical physicist [[Albert Einstein]] in 1933.\n\nIn the years during and following WWII, several innovative scientists immigrated to the U.S. from Europe, such as [[Enrico Fermi]], who came from [[Italy]] in 1938 and led the work that produced the world's first self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]]. Post-war Europe saw many of its scientists, such as rocket scientist [[Wernher von Braun]], recruited by the United States as part of [[Operation Paperclip]].{{Relevance inline|date=October 2012}}\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Education in the United States|Educational attainment in the United States}}\n[[File:Higher education in the US by race.svg|thumb|Higher education in the US by race as of 2003|188x188px]]\n\nEducation in the United States is and has historically been provided mainly by government. Control and funding come from three levels: [[Federal government of the United States|federal]], [[State government|state]], and [[Local government|local]]. School attendance is mandatory and nearly universal at the elementary and high school levels (often known outside the United States as the primary and secondary levels).\n\nStudents have the options of having their education held in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s, private schools, or [[homeschooling|home school]]. In most public and private schools, education is divided into three levels: [[Primary education in the United States|elementary school]], [[Middle school|junior high school]] (also often called middle school), and [[Secondary education in the United States|high school]]. In almost all schools at these levels, children are divided by age groups into [[Grade levels|grades]]. [[Post-secondary education]], better known as \"college\" in the United States, is generally governed separately from the elementary and high school system.\n\nIn the year 2000, there were 76.6&nbsp;million students enrolled in schools from [[kindergarten]] through [[graduate school]]s. Of these, 72 percent aged 12 to 17 were judged academically \"on track\" for their age (enrolled in school at or above grade level). Of those enrolled in compulsory education, 5.2&nbsp;million (10.4 percent) were attending private schools.

Examples are popular culture obsessions with confession and forgiveness, which extends from [[reality television]] to [[twelve-step meeting]]s. Americans expect public figures to confess and have public [[penitence]] for any sins or moral wrongdoings they may have caused.

A few restrictions do exist. Restrictions vary by state, but most are for the sake of practicality (for example: limiting the number of characters due to limitations in record keeping software). This freedom, along with the cultural diversity in the United States has given rise to a wide variety of names and naming trends.

Mainstream [[Cuisine of the United States|American culinary arts]] are similar to those in other Western countries. Wheat and corn are the primary cereal grains. Traditional American cuisine uses ingredients such as [[turkey (bird)|turkey]], potatoes, [[sweet potato]]es, [[maize|corn]] (maize), [[squash (plant)|squash]], and [[maple syrup]], indigenous foods employed by American Indians and early European settlers, African slaves and their descendants.\n\nThe types of food served at home vary greatly and depend upon the region of the country and the family's own cultural heritage. Recent immigrants tend to eat food similar to that of their country of origin, and [[Americanization|Americanized]] versions of these cultural foods, such as [[American Chinese cuisine]] or [[Italian-American cuisine]] often eventually appear. [[Vietnamese cuisine]], [[Korean cuisine]] and [[Thai cuisine]] in authentic forms are often readily available in large cities. [[German cuisine]] has a profound impact on American cuisine, especially mid-western cuisine; potatoes, noodles, roasts, stews, cakes, and other pastries are the most iconic ingredients in both cuisines.<ref name=\"Dealing with Diversity\"/> Dishes such as the hamburger, pot roast, baked ham, and hot dogs are examples of American dishes derived from German cuisine.<ref name=\"History of the hot dog\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hot-dog.org/hd/hd_history.htm|title=History of the hot dog|accessdate=2006-11-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061018070129/http://www.hot-dog.org/hd/hd_history.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = October 18, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"History of the Hamburger\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ahamburgertoday.com/archives/2005/08/the_history_of.php|title=History of the Hamburger|accessdate=2006-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121121752/http://www.ahamburgertoday.com/archives/2005/08/the_history_of.php|archive-date=November 21, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Motherhood and apple pie.jpg|thumb|right|[[Apple pie]] is one of a number of American cultural icons]]\nDifferent regions of the United States have their own cuisine and styles of cooking. The states of Louisiana and Mississippi, for example, is known for their [[Cajun cuisine|Cajun]] and [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole cooking]]. Cajun and Creole cooking are influenced by French, Acadian, and Haitian cooking, although the dishes themselves are original and unique. Examples include Crawfish Etouffee, Red Beans and Rice, Seafood or Chicken Gumbo, Jambalaya, and Boudin. Italian, German, Hungarian and Chinese influences, traditional Native American, Caribbean, Mexican and Greek dishes have also diffused into the general American repertoire. It is not uncommon for a \"middle-class\" family from \"middle America\" to eat, for example, restaurant pizza, home-made pizza, enchiladas con carne, chicken paprikas, beef stroganof and bratwurst with sauerkraut for dinner throughout a single week.\n\n[[Soul food]], mostly the same as food eaten by white southerners, developed by southern African slaves, and their free descendants, is popular around the South and among many [[African-Americans]] elsewhere. [[Syncretism|Syncretic]] cuisines such as Louisiana creole, Cajun, [[Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine|Pennsylvania Dutch]], and [[Tex-Mex cuisine|Tex-Mex]] are regionally important. Iconic American dishes such as [[apple pie]], [[fried chicken]], [[pizza]], [[hamburger]]s, and [[hot dog]]s derive from the recipes of various immigrants and domestic innovations. [[French fries]], Mexican dishes such as [[burrito]]s and [[taco]]s, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are consumed.<ref name=\"IFT\">{{cite web| url=http://www.ift.org/cms/?pid=1000496| author=Klapthor, James N.| title=What, When, and Where Americans Eat in 2003| publisher=Institute of Food Technologists| date=August 23, 2003| accessdate=2007-06-19| archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AVv1NInf?url=http://www.ift.org/cms/?pid=1000496| archive-date=September 8, 2012| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAmericans generally prefer coffee to tea, and more than half the adult population drinks at least one cup a day.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/guatemala.mexico/facts.html#02| title=Coffee Today| publisher=PBS|work=Coffee Country|date=May 2003| accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref> Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making [[orange juice]] and milk (now often fat-reduced) ubiquitous breakfast beverages.<ref>Smith, Andrew F.

Although the [[nuclear family]] concept (two-married adults with biological children) holds a special place in the mindset of Americans, it is single-parent families, [[childless]] couples, and fused families which now constitute the majority of families.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  A person may grow up in a single-parent family, go on to marry and live in childless couple arrangement, then get divorced, live as a single for a couple of years, remarry, have children and live in a nuclear family arrangement.<ref name=\"Society in Focus\"/><ref name=\"Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships\"/>\n\n<blockquote>The nuclear family... is the idealized version of what most people think when they think of \"family...\" The old definition of what a family is... the nuclear family- no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today, according to many social scientists (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996).

In the single-parent household, one parent typically raises the children with little to no help at all, from the other. This parent is the sole \"breadwinner\" of the family and thus, these households are particularly vulnerable economically. They have higher rates of [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]], and children of these households are more likely to have educational problems.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n===Youth dependence===\nOther changes to the landscape of American family arrangements include dual-income earner households and delayed independence among American youths. Whereas most families in the 1950s and 1960s relied on one income earner, most commonly the husband, the vast majority of family households now have two-income earners.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}{{clarify|reason=how does two incomes affect youth dependence?|date=August 2013}}\n\nAnother change is the increasing age at which young Americans leave their parental home. Traditionally, a person past \"college age\" who lived with their parent(s) was viewed negatively, but today it is not uncommon for children to live with their parents until their mid-twenties. This trend can be mostly attributed to rising [[Real estate pricing|living costs]] that are more expensive compared to those in decades past. Thus, many young adults now remain with their parents well past their mid-twenties.

The suburban nuclear family has been identified as part of the \"[[American Dream]]\": a married couple with children owning a house in the suburbs. This archetype is reinforced by mass media, religious practices, and government policies and is based on traditions from Anglo-Saxon cultures. One of the biggest differences in suburban living as compared to urban living; is the housing occupied by the families. The suburbs are filled with single-family homes separated from retail districts, industrial areas, and sometimes even public schools. However, many American suburbs are incorporating these districts on smaller scales, attracting more people to these communities.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nHousing in urban areas may include more [[apartment]]s and semi-attached homes than in the suburbs or small towns.

The unique [[Jazz funeral]] of New Orleans features joyous and raucous music and dancing during the procession.\n\n[[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] (founded in 1831) is known as \"America's first garden cemetery.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Old Cambridge |last=Bunting |first=Bainbridge |author2=Robert H.

Rows of [[grave (burial)|grave]]s are covered by [[lawn]]s and are interspersed with trees and flowers. [[Headstone]]s, [[mausoleum]]s, statuary or simple plaques typically mark off the individual graves. [[Cremation]] is another common practice in the United States, though it is frowned upon by various religions. The ashes of the deceased are usually placed in an [[urn]], which may be kept in a private house, or they are interred. Sometimes the ashes are released into the atmosphere. The \"sprinkling\" or \"scattering\" of the ashes may be part of an informal ceremony, often taking place at a scenic natural feature (a cliff, lake or mountain) that was favored by the deceased.\n\nA so-called [[death industry]] has developed in the United States that has replaced earlier, more informal traditions. Before the popularity of funeral homes, people usually held wakes in the [[parlour]] rooms of private houses.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n==Sociological issues==\n\n===Marriage and divorce===\n{{Main|Marriage in the United States|Divorce in the United States}}\n{{See also|Cohabitation in the United States}}\n[[File:Marilyn Monroe and Jerry Giesler 3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marilyn Monroe]] signing divorce papers with celebrity attorney [[Jerry Giesler]]]]\nMarriage laws are established by individual states. The typical wedding involves a couple proclaiming their commitment to one another in front of their close relatives and friends, often presided over by a religious figure such as a minister, priest, or rabbi, depending upon the faith of the couple. In traditional Christian ceremonies, the bride's father will \"give away\" (hand off) the bride to the groom. Secular weddings are also common, often presided over by a judge, [[Justice of the Peace]], or other municipal official. [[Same-sex marriage]] is legal in all states.\n\n[[Divorce]] is the province of state governments, so divorce law varies from state to state. Prior to the 1970s, divorcing spouses had to allege that the other spouse was guilty of a crime or [[sin]] like abandonment or adultery; when spouses simply could not get along, lawyers were forced to manufacture \"uncontested\" divorces. The [[no-fault divorce]] revolution began in 1969 in California; New York and South Dakota were the [[No-fault divorce#The adoption of no-fault divorce laws by the other states|last states to begin allowing no-fault divorce]]. No-fault divorce on the grounds of \"irreconcilable differences\" is now available in all states. However, many states have recently required separation periods prior to a formal divorce decree.\n\nState law provides for [[child support]] where children are involved, and sometimes for [[alimony]]. \"Married adults now divorce two-and-a-half times as often as adults did 20 years ago and four times as often as they did 50 years ago... between 40% and 60% of ''new'' marriages will eventually end in divorce. The probability within... the first five years is 20%, and the probability of its ending within the first 10 years is 33%... Perhaps 25% of children ages 16 and under live with a stepparent.\"<ref>Brian K. Williams, Stacy C. Sawyer, Carl M.

This relationship has historically been the most important one since the founding of the United States. Currently, most African-Americans are descendants of African slaves imported to the United States, though some are more recent immigrants or their descendants. Slavery existed in the United States at the time of the country's formation in the 1770s. The U.S. banned importation of slaves in 1808. Slavery was partially abolished by the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] issued by president [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1862 for slaves in the Southeastern United States during the Civil War. Slavery was rendered illegal by the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. [[Jim Crow Laws]] prevented full use of African American citizenship until the 20th century. The [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] outlawed official or legal segregation in public places or limited access to minorities.\n\nRelations between white Americans and other racial or ethnic groups have been a source of tension at various times in U.S. history. With the advent of European colonization, and continuing into the early years of the republic, relations between whites and Native American was a significant issue. In 1882, in response to Chinese immigration due to the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] and the labor needed for the Transcontinental Railroad, the U.S. signed into law the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] which banned immigration by Chinese people into the U.S. In the late 19th century, the growth of the Hispanic population in the U.S., fueled largely by Mexican immigration, generated debate over policies such as English as the official language and reform to immigration policies.\n\nA huge majority of Americans of all races disapprove of racism. Nevertheless, some Americans continue to hold negative racial/ethnic [[Stereotypes of groups within the United States|stereotypes]] about various racial and ethnic groups. Professor Imani Perry, of [[Princeton University]], has argued that contemporary [[racism]] in the United States \"is frequently unintentional or unacknowledged on the part of the actor\",<ref>Imani Perry, More Beautiful More Terrible: The Embrace and Transcendence of Racial Inequality in the United States, New York University Press: 2011, p7</ref> believing that racism mostly stems unconsciously from below the level of cognition.<ref>Perry, 21</ref>\n\n===Drugs and alcohol===\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}\n{{Further|History of United States drug prohibition}}\n[[File:Just Say No.jpg|thumb|\"Just Say No\" paraphernalia at the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library|Reagan Library]] display]]\n\nAmerican attitudes towards drugs and alcoholic beverages have evolved considerably throughout the country's history. In the 19th century, alcohol was readily available and consumed, and no laws restricted the use of other drugs. Attitudes on drug addiction started to change, resulting in the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act|Harrison Act]], which eventually became proscriptive.\n\nA movement to ban alcoholic beverages, called the [[Temperance movement|Temperance]] movement, emerged in the late 19th century. Several American Protestant religious groups and women's groups, such as the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]], supported the movement. In 1919, Prohibitionists succeeded in [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|amending the Constitution]] to prohibit the sale of alcohol. Although the Prohibition period did result in lowering alcohol consumption overall,{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} banning alcohol outright proved to be unworkable, as the previously legitimate distillery industry was replaced by criminal gangs that trafficked in alcohol. Prohibition [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|was repealed]] in 1933. States and localities retained the right to remain \"dry\", and to this day, [[dry county|a handful]] still do.\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]] era, attitudes swung well away from prohibition. Commentators noted that an 18-year-old could be [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] to war but could not buy a beer.\n\nSince 1980, the trend has been toward greater restrictions on alcohol and drug use. The focus this time, however, has been to criminalize behaviors associated with alcohol, rather than attempt to prohibit consumption outright. New York was the first state to enact tough [[drunk-driving]] laws in 1980; since then all other states have followed suit. All states have also banned the purchase of alcoholic beverages by individuals under 21.\n\nA \"[[Just Say No]] to Drugs\" movement replaced the more liberal ethos of the 1960s. This led to stricter drug laws and greater police latitude in drug cases. Drugs are, however, widely available, and 16% of Americans 12 and older used an illicit drug in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Survey of Drug Use and Health|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/national-survey-drug-use-health|accessdate=November 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1990s, [[marijuana]] use has become increasingly tolerated in America, and a number of states allow the [[Medical cannabis in the United States|use of marijuana for medical purposes]]. In most states marijuana is still illegal without medical prescription. Since the 2012 general election, voters in the District of Columbia and the states of [[Alaska]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] approved the legalization of marijuana for recreational use. Marijuana is classified as illegal under federal law.\n\n==Volunteerism==\n[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] first noted, in 1835, the American attitude towards helping others in need. A 2011 [[Charities Aid Foundation]] study found that Americans were the first most willing to help a stranger and donate time and money in the world at 60%. Many low-level crimes are punished by assigning hours of \"[[community service]]\", a requirement that the offender perform volunteer work;<ref>{{Cite news| first=David | last=Crary | title=Study finds Americans in generous mood | url=http://silentrebellion.newsvine.com/_news/2010/09/09/5079433-11-most-generous-countries-of-2010| publisher=Burlington Free Press | location=Burlington, Vermont | pages= 1A | date=September 9, 2010 | id=}}</ref><!---note that location of soft copy and hard copy differ.

A sense of national unity and identity was forged out of the victorious [[First Barbary War]], [[Second Barbary War]], and the [[War of 1812]]. Even so, the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]] were suspicious of a permanent military force and not until the outbreak of [[World War II]] did a large standing army become officially established. The [[National Security Act of 1947]], adopted following World War II and during the onset of the Cold War, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level [[United States Department of War|Department of War]] and the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] into the [[United States Department of Defense|National Military Establishment]] (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]] and National Security Council.\n\nThe U.S. military is one of the largest militaries in terms of number of personnel. It draws its manpower from a large pool of paid [[Volunteer military|volunteers]]; although [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] has been used in the past in various times of both war and peace, it has not been used since 1972. As of 2011, the United States spends about $550&nbsp;billion annually to fund its military forces,<ref name=\"Budget FY2011\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-BUD-7.pdf |title=Federal Government Outlays by Function and Subfunction: 1962\u20132015 Fiscal Year 2011 (Table 3.2) |authorlink=[[United States Department of Defense]] |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]] |accessdate=December 21, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330224158/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-BUD-7.pdf |archivedate=March 30, 2012  }}</ref> and appropriates approximately $160&nbsp;billion to fund [[War on Terrorism|Overseas Contingency Operations]].

The largest ethnic group, the [[Fang people|Fang]], are indigenous to the mainland, but substantial migration to [[Bioko Island]] has resulted in Fang dominance over the earlier Bubi inhabitants. The Fang constitute 80% of the population and are themselves divided into 67 clans. Those in the northern part of Rio Muni speak Fang-Ntumu, while those in the south speak Fang-Okah; the two dialects are [[mutually unintelligible]]. The [[Bubi people|Bubi]], who constitute 15% of the population, are indigenous to Bioko Island.\n\nIn addition, there are coastal ethnic groups, collectively referred to as ''Ndowe'' or \"Playeros\" (\"''Beach People''\" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]): [[Combe people|Combes]], [[Bujeba people|Bujebas]], [[Balengue people|Balengues]] and [[Benga people|Bengas]] on the mainland and small islands and a [[Fernandinos|Fernandino]] community of [[Sierra Leone Krio people|Krio]] descended people on Bioko.

Most Spaniards left after independence. There is a growing number of foreigners from neighboring [[Cameroon]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Gabon]]. Equatorial Guinea received [[Asians]] and black Africans from other countries as workers on [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coffee]] plantations. In the late 20th century, Equatorial Guinea became home to more than 80,000 Hispanics from Mexico, Central America, and other Spanish speaking nations in the Americas. 17,000<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Equatorial-Guinea</ref> Spanish people and 5,000<ref>https://www.fastcompany.com/849690/chinas-new-oil-supplier</ref> Chinese people also live in Equatorial Guinea. The non-Africans living in [[Equatorial Guinea]] represent almost 10% of the nation's total population. Other black Africans came from [[Liberia]], [[Angola]], and [[Mozambique]], and Asians are mostly [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] with small numbers of [[India]]ns. Equatorial Guinea also allowed many fortune-seeking European settlers of other nationalities, including [[British people|British]], [[French people|French]] and [[Germans]]. After independence, thousands of Equatorial Guineans went to Spain. Another 100,000 Equatorial Guineans went to Cameroon, Gabon, and Nigeria because of dictatorship of [[Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema]].

The Fang constitute 80% of the population and are themselves divided into 67 clans. Those in the northern part of Rio Muni speak Fang-Ntumu, while those in the south speak Fang-Okah; the two dialects are [[mutually unintelligible]]. The [[Bubi people|Bubi]], who constitute 15% of the population, are indigenous to Bioko Island.\n\nIn addition, there are coastal ethnic groups, collectively referred to as ''Ndowe'' or \"Playeros\" (\"''Beach People''\" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]): [[Combe people|Combes]], [[Bujeba people|Bujebas]], [[Balengue people|Balengues]] and [[Benga people|Bengas]] on the mainland and small islands and a [[Fernandinos|Fernandino]] community of [[Sierra Leone Krio people|Krio]] descended people on Bioko.

Equatorial Guinea received [[Asians]] and black Africans from other countries as workers on [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coffee]] plantations. In the late 20th century, Equatorial Guinea became home to more than 80,000 Hispanics from Mexico, Central America, and other Spanish speaking nations in the Americas. 17,000<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Equatorial-Guinea</ref> Spanish people and 5,000<ref>https://www.fastcompany.com/849690/chinas-new-oil-supplier</ref> Chinese people also live in Equatorial Guinea.

Other black Africans came from [[Liberia]], [[Angola]], and [[Mozambique]], and Asians are mostly [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] with small numbers of [[India]]ns. Equatorial Guinea also allowed many fortune-seeking European settlers of other nationalities, including [[British people|British]], [[French people|French]] and [[Germans]]. After independence, thousands of Equatorial Guineans went to Spain. Another 100,000 Equatorial Guineans went to Cameroon, Gabon, and Nigeria because of dictatorship of [[Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema]].

A physician turned international [[espionage|spy]], he was sent to infiltrate a chemical refinery and was accidentally doused with a chemical that turned his hair and skin purple. Though he was caught and questioned, offering a weak alibi, he was released. Several more incidents like this demonstrated that the nerve gas had given Killgrave the ability to command the wills of other people. Calling himself the Purple Man, Killgrave embarked on a criminal career. \n\nEarly in his criminal career, he used his mind-control powers to force a woman to become his wife. Before she recovered and left him, she became pregnant with his daughter, Kara Killgrave.<ref>''[[Alpha Flight]]'' #41. Marvel Comics</ref>  Kara inherited his discoloration and powers and became the [[Alpha Flight]]-affiliated superhero called the Purple Girl,<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #48. Marvel Comics.</ref> and later [[Persuasion (comics)|Persuasion]] in ''Alpha Flight'' issue #41.\n\nThe character largely disappeared from comic books during the 1980s although he did face Spider-Man, Moon Knight, Daredevil, Power Man and Iron Fist in ''Marvel Team-Up'' Annual #4. He also appeared in the [[Marvel Graphic Novel|graphic novel]] ''Emperor Doom'' in which [[Doctor Doom]] uses Killgrave to power a machine called the \"psycho-prism\" that allowed Doom to control the minds of everyone on Earth. During the process, Purple Man finds out that he cannot control Doctor Doom's mind even at close range, as Doom's mental fortitude is too great.\n\nHe later reappeared in the pages of ''[[Nate Grey|X-Man]]'', as the mastermind behind Nate Grey's rise to super-celebrity status as a miracle worker in New York City.{{issue|date=January 2013}} He had been subtly manipulating both the population of Manhattan and Nate himself into accepting and embracing the young exile from the \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" storyline as a modern [[messiah|messianic figure]], who would then become so psychologically empowered by hero worship that he could and would literally change the reality of the world, using the full potential of his mutant power. The plan ultimately failed when Nate learns the truth and loses his confidence, thus reducing his power.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Killgrave goes once more into hiding.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nAs detailed in the series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'', the Purple Man has since been revealed to be linked to the history of [[Jessica Jones]].<ref>{{Cite comic|title=Alias|issue=#24-28|date=2004}}</ref> When she was the superhero Jewel, he used his mind-control powers to subdue her, forcing her to live with him while psychologically torturing her for several months.

The incident with Purple Man leaves her so traumatized that she leaves her life as a superhero behind and becomes a private investigator.<ref>''Alias'' #26-28</ref> Later, the Purple Man escapes again and tries controlling Jessica to kill the Avengers, but she is able to resist and knocks him out. Daredevil later has the Purple Man imprisoned in the Raft, a jail designed for super-powered criminals.<ref>''Alias'' #28</ref>\n\nHe escapes briefly, when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] creates a riot at the Raft. Purple Man then attempts to use the opportunity to mind control [[Luke Cage]] into killing the then soon-to-be-Avengers, and threatens Jones, who is pregnant with Cage's child. Unknown to the Purple Man, drugs had been put into his food to negate his powers during his imprisonment, so he is unable to control Cage, who subsequently beats him to a pulp in response to his demands.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 1 #01-03 (Jan-Mar 2005). Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nLater, the Purple Man returned shortly before (and during) the \"[[House of M]]\" storyline and manipulated the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], while being manipulated himself by [[Baron Zemo]], who used the moonstones he had recently acquired to free Kilgrave from prison, leaving an illusion in his place so that the authorities would not be aware of his escape. With his pheromones distributed through the New York City water system and Zemo's moonstones used to project his voice wherever necessary the Purple Man enslaved the entire city. Under Zemo's direction he used the city's superhumans as his personal army to attack the Thunderbolts, whom he had worked to turn against each other. Eventually, he was defeated by the Thunderbolts member [[Genis-Vell]], after which Zemo [[Teleportation|teleport]]ed the Purple Man back and [[torture]]d him for his failure before sending him back to prison once more.<ref>{{Cite comic|title=New Thunderbolts|issue=#10-12|date=2005}}</ref>\n\nDuring the ''Scared Straight'' crossover between ''Thunderbolts'' and ''Avengers Academy'', the Purple Man is revealed to be incarcerated in the Raft Maximum Security Penitentiary, as [[Tigra]] warns her Academy students not to look at his face or read his lips.<ref>''[[Avengers Academy]]'' #3. Marvel Comics</ref> During a subsequent [[power outage]] caused by Academy-member Hazmat, the Purple Man, at the head of a small gang of mind-controlled inmates, again crosses paths with a lone Luke Cage, now supervisor of a Thunderbolts team composed of Raft prisoners. Cage makes short work of the Purple Man and his \"recruits\", revealing that the [[nanorobotics|nanites]] that maintain control over his Thunderbolts also shield him from Killgrave's influence.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #147. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Purple Man and a majority of inmates are freed after the Raft is severely damaged by the transformation of the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] into Kuurth: Breaker of Stone and the subsequent damage caused by Kuurth's escape.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Home Front'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> Before escaping the Raft, the Purple Man attempts to kill a comatose [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]] in the prison infirmary, and makes statements indicating that he was behind the Puppet Master's manipulation of [[Misty Knight]]'s [[Heroes for Hire#Heroes for Hire (2010)|Heroes for Hire]] organization, using them to establish a criminal organization by proxy while incarcerated. He is prevented from killing the Puppet Master by Heroes for Hire operatives [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] and the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]], but Killgrave attacks the pair with a mob of mind-controlled inmates driven into a frenzy. When the heroes hold their own against the assault, the Purple Man changes tactics and turns them against each other.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' (2010)# 9-10. Marvel Comics</ref> He subsequently escapes the Raft via the Hudson River.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Home Front'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nPurple Man later began to form a new criminal empire with the help of [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], [[Headhunter (comics)|Headhunter]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], a new [[Death-Stalker]], and a new Scourge.<ref>''Villains for Hire'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nDuring Daredevil's time in San Francisco after the exposure of his secret identity, he encountered the Purple Man's children, who had inherited their father's powers. After Matt saved the children from a mob and their father, they use a machine their father had created to enhance his powers to boost their own and erase the world's knowledge of Matt's identity as Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil Vol. 5 #20</ref>\n\nEventually, after tracking down Jessica Jones and taking control of Carol Danvers, Purple Man is killed by a gunshot wound and his body thrown into the sun.<ref>''Jessica Jones'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Purple Man's body produces chemical pheromones which, when inhaled or absorbed through the skin, allow Killgrave to control others' actions, as long as he is physically present. These abilities can overwhelm most, but sufficiently strong-willed people, such as [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], have been able to resist its influence, and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] has been able to resist Killgrave as the powers rely on full sensory manipulation, Daredevil's blindness hindering the amount of input he receives and making it easier for him to resist what he picks up. [[Moon Knight]] defeated the Purple Man by wearing earplugs that prevented him from hearing the villain's commands; he, Daredevil, and other heroes gagged the Purple Man before giving him to the police to prevent him from commanding others.\n\n==Other versions==\n*In the alternate future of the series 2003 ''[[Marvel 1602]]'', Killgrave becomes [[President for Life]] of the United States. The story is touched off by him accidentally sending Captain America into the past when he intended for the hero to be killed, so that no one would be inspired to overthrow him.\n*In the 2005 \"[[House of M]]\" storyline, Zebediah Killgrave (nicknamed \"Zeb\") is a powerless human who works as a lobbyist for the mutant-controlled government, but is secretly an agent of the Human Resistance.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' {{issue|date=October 2015}} Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Zebediah Killgrave appeared in the animated ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' episode \"No Mutant Is an Island\", voiced by [[Cedric Smith (actor)|Cedric Smith]]. This version uses a face cream to hide his purple complexion in public.\n\n* Purple Man appears in the animated series ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Brent Spiner]]. In the episode \"The Breakout\" Pt. 1, Purple Man was shown as an inmate of the Raft. In the episode \"Emperor Stark\", Purple Man controls most of the Avengers in his plans to take over the world until Vision freed the Avengers in order to defeat Purple Man.\n\n[[File:David Tennant as Kilgrave.jpg|thumb|[[David Tennant]] as Kilgrave in the [[Netflix]] television series ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''.]]\n\n* '''Kilgrave''' is the main antagonist of season 1 of ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'', portrayed by [[David Tennant]] as an adult<ref name=\"AKAJJ\">{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/tv/23978/david_tennant_joins_marvels_aka_jessica_jones_for_netflix|title=David Tennant Joins Marvel's A.K.A.

He has several differences from the comic book character. Instead of the purple skin of the comics, this version affects a purple wardrobe and his real name is '''Kevin Thompson'''. He does not secrete pheromones, but infects the people around him with a virus to control them. Unlike his comic book counterpart, this version of Kilgrave can control any number of people by simply giving oral commands and can order anyone to do anything he tells them without being physically present. However, his commands can only be followed within one day before it wears off.

Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nLater, the Purple Man returned shortly before (and during) the \"[[House of M]]\" storyline and manipulated the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], while being manipulated himself by [[Baron Zemo]], who used the moonstones he had recently acquired to free Kilgrave from prison, leaving an illusion in his place so that the authorities would not be aware of his escape. With his pheromones distributed through the New York City water system and Zemo's moonstones used to project his voice wherever necessary the Purple Man enslaved the entire city. Under Zemo's direction he used the city's superhumans as his personal army to attack the Thunderbolts, whom he had worked to turn against each other. Eventually, he was defeated by the Thunderbolts member [[Genis-Vell]], after which Zemo [[Teleportation|teleport]]ed the Purple Man back and [[torture]]d him for his failure before sending him back to prison once more.<ref>{{Cite comic|title=New Thunderbolts|issue=#10-12|date=2005}}</ref>\n\nDuring the ''Scared Straight'' crossover between ''Thunderbolts'' and ''Avengers Academy'', the Purple Man is revealed to be incarcerated in the Raft Maximum Security Penitentiary, as [[Tigra]] warns her Academy students not to look at his face or read his lips.<ref>''[[Avengers Academy]]'' #3. Marvel Comics</ref> During a subsequent [[power outage]] caused by Academy-member Hazmat, the Purple Man, at the head of a small gang of mind-controlled inmates, again crosses paths with a lone Luke Cage, now supervisor of a Thunderbolts team composed of Raft prisoners. Cage makes short work of the Purple Man and his \"recruits\", revealing that the [[nanorobotics|nanites]] that maintain control over his Thunderbolts also shield him from Killgrave's influence.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #147. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Purple Man and a majority of inmates are freed after the Raft is severely damaged by the transformation of the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] into Kuurth: Breaker of Stone and the subsequent damage caused by Kuurth's escape.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Home Front'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> Before escaping the Raft, the Purple Man attempts to kill a comatose [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]] in the prison infirmary, and makes statements indicating that he was behind the Puppet Master's manipulation of [[Misty Knight]]'s [[Heroes for Hire#Heroes for Hire (2010)|Heroes for Hire]] organization, using them to establish a criminal organization by proxy while incarcerated. He is prevented from killing the Puppet Master by Heroes for Hire operatives [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] and the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]], but Killgrave attacks the pair with a mob of mind-controlled inmates driven into a frenzy. When the heroes hold their own against the assault, the Purple Man changes tactics and turns them against each other.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' (2010)# 9-10. Marvel Comics</ref> He subsequently escapes the Raft via the Hudson River.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Home Front'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nPurple Man later began to form a new criminal empire with the help of [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], [[Headhunter (comics)|Headhunter]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], a new [[Death-Stalker]], and a new Scourge.<ref>''Villains for Hire'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nDuring Daredevil's time in San Francisco after the exposure of his secret identity, he encountered the Purple Man's children, who had inherited their father's powers. After Matt saved the children from a mob and their father, they use a machine their father had created to enhance his powers to boost their own and erase the world's knowledge of Matt's identity as Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil Vol. 5 #20</ref>\n\nEventually, after tracking down Jessica Jones and taking control of Carol Danvers, Purple Man is killed by a gunshot wound and his body thrown into the sun.<ref>''Jessica Jones'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Purple Man's body produces chemical pheromones which, when inhaled or absorbed through the skin, allow Killgrave to control others' actions, as long as he is physically present. These abilities can overwhelm most, but sufficiently strong-willed people, such as [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], have been able to resist its influence, and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] has been able to resist Killgrave as the powers rely on full sensory manipulation, Daredevil's blindness hindering the amount of input he receives and making it easier for him to resist what he picks up. [[Moon Knight]] defeated the Purple Man by wearing earplugs that prevented him from hearing the villain's commands; he, Daredevil, and other heroes gagged the Purple Man before giving him to the police to prevent him from commanding others.\n\n==Other versions==\n*In the alternate future of the series 2003 ''[[Marvel 1602]]'', Killgrave becomes [[President for Life]] of the United States. The story is touched off by him accidentally sending Captain America into the past when he intended for the hero to be killed, so that no one would be inspired to overthrow him.\n*In the 2005 \"[[House of M]]\" storyline, Zebediah Killgrave (nicknamed \"Zeb\") is a powerless human who works as a lobbyist for the mutant-controlled government, but is secretly an agent of the Human Resistance.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' {{issue|date=October 2015}} Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Zebediah Killgrave appeared in the animated ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' episode \"No Mutant Is an Island\", voiced by [[Cedric Smith (actor)|Cedric Smith]]. This version uses a face cream to hide his purple complexion in public.\n\n* Purple Man appears in the animated series ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Brent Spiner]]. In the episode \"The Breakout\" Pt. 1, Purple Man was shown as an inmate of the Raft. In the episode \"Emperor Stark\", Purple Man controls most of the Avengers in his plans to take over the world until Vision freed the Avengers in order to defeat Purple Man.\n\n[[File:David Tennant as Kilgrave.jpg|thumb|[[David Tennant]] as Kilgrave in the [[Netflix]] television series ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''.]]\n\n* '''Kilgrave''' is the main antagonist of season 1 of ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'', portrayed by [[David Tennant]] as an adult<ref name=\"AKAJJ\">{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/tv/23978/david_tennant_joins_marvels_aka_jessica_jones_for_netflix|title=David Tennant Joins Marvel's A.K.A.

He has several differences from the comic book character. Instead of the purple skin of the comics, this version affects a purple wardrobe and his real name is '''Kevin Thompson'''. He does not secrete pheromones, but infects the people around him with a virus to control them. Unlike his comic book counterpart, this version of Kilgrave can control any number of people by simply giving oral commands and can order anyone to do anything he tells them without being physically present. However, his commands can only be followed within one day before it wears off. His powers came from the experiments done by his scientist parents Louise and Albert Thompson.<ref>{{cite episode|title=AKA Sin Bin|series=Marvel's Jessica Jones|credits=Dahl, John (director); Jamie King & Dana Baratta (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=November 20, 2015|season=1|number=9}}</ref> Ever since using her to kill Reva Connors, Kilgrave has been obsessed with Jessica while he has had her in his control, and spends the show's first season trying to prove his love to her by creating chaos for her to solve.<ref>{{cite episode|title=AKA It's Called Whiskey|series=Marvel's Jessica Jones|credits=Petrarca, David (director); Liz Friedman and Scott Reynolds (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=November 20, 2015|season=1|number=3}}</ref> In the season finale, Jessica kills Kilgrave by snapping his neck.
