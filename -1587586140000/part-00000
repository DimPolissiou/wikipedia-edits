For example, a Yoruba [[Yoruba religion|traditionalist]] might look at a conjugal visit from a dream-based lover in much the same way as the aforementioned Ewe and Baule do, whereas a [[Muslim]] or [[Christians|Christian]] tribesman in the same situation would most likely look at it as a grave misfortune and seek the mystic aid of a spiritual counsellor to rectify what he would see as a probably dangerous connection to an otherworldly ''demon''.\n\n=== Neopaganism ===\nThe controversial, self-proclaimed [[Contemporary witchcraft#Traditional Witchcraft|traditional witch]] Robin Artisson includes a variation of the Norse [[fetch (folklore)|fetch]] concept in his book ''The Witching Way of the Hollow Hill''.<ref>Artisson, R.

The latter practice (of opposite-gender spirit-possession mediumship) is attested in, e.g., Okinawa, Siam, and Burma, in each of which areas it would appear to be mainly (if not entirely) based on non-remembered (putatively non-conscious) trance. \n\nThe practice of dream-based spirit-marriage would appear likewise to exclude and be excluded by shallower trances involving some partial degree of control (but permanently and continuously, instead of merely intermittently as was the case in non-remembered trance) of the practitioner by a spirit-entity of opposite gender from that of the practitioner; which is attested not only among the [[Two-Spirit|berdache]] in tribes of the Great Plains of North America, but also among the manang in Borneo, and perhaps also among numerous other persons and geographic regions (including European practitioners of homosexual magic, etc.).\n\n===Asia===\nThai\u2014For a male spirit-medium, \"female spirits possess the medium on Saturdays\";<ref>Morris 2000, p. 297</ref> for which occasions the male medium is attired in feminine garments<ref>Morris 2000, p. 301</ref>\u2014these are events of spirit-possession by the medium's \"losing consciousness\".<ref>Morris 2000, p. 89</ref> However, dreaming is not significant for T'ai spirit-mediumship.<ref>Morris 2000, p. 290; referring to Gananath Obeyesekere: ''Medusa's Hair'', p. 180.</ref> (There is, nevertheless, some degree of similarity between this practice of becoming possessed by an opposite-gender spirit regularly on a particular day of the week; and the custom in Haitian spirit-marriage of regularly devoting a particular day of the week to one's marital duty to that spirit.)<ref>\"Once the ceremony is complete, the spouse will abstain from sexual relations on his or her Lwa's day of the week, reserving that time for visits from his or her divine mate.\" [https://books.google.com/books?id=4YnCr4N0i88C&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=Haiti+%22spirit+marriage%22+%22day+of+the+week%22&source=bl&ots=YayyPicGl4&sig=XYJ4YhNxVD-Sv3lQkZ-w-8KMpxQ&hl=en&ei=WHV0S9_VCtGXtgekqNy3Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Haiti%20%22spirit%20marriage%22%20%22day%20of%20the%20week%22&f=false Lilith Dorsey: ''Voodoo and Afro-Caribbean Paganism''.

For example, a Yoruba [[Yoruba religion|traditionalist]] might look at a conjugal visit from a dream-based lover in much the same way as the aforementioned Ewe and Baule do, whereas a [[Muslim]] or [[Christians|Christian]] tribesman in the same situation would most likely look at it as a grave misfortune and seek the mystic aid of a spiritual counsellor to rectify what he would see as a probably dangerous connection to an otherworldly ''demon''.\n\n=== Neopaganism ===\nThe controversial, self-proclaimed [[Contemporary witchcraft#Traditional Witchcraft|traditional witch]] Robin Artisson includes a variation of the Norse [[fetch (folklore)|fetch]] concept in his book ''The Witching Way of the Hollow Hill''.<ref>Artisson, R. (2009). [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0982031882 Witching Way of the Hollow Hill]. Pendraig Publishing.</ref> He supports this with the thesis that the questing/rescuing heroes in myths, legends, and fairy tales can be seen as the soul, and rescued maidens as the fetch bride. However, he does not make it clear if this occurs in dreams, [[Shamanism#Practice|shamanic journey]]s in a [[trance]] state, or both\u2014though trance work is an important part of his theology and recommended practice. Some other Neopagan authors from very different traditions have also hinted at the possibility spiritual-sexual union of some sort with divine or spirit being.\n\n==Contrast against opposite-gender spirit-mediumship==\nThe practice of dream-based spirit-marriage would appear to exclude and be excluded by (i.e., not be practiced by the same practitioners, nor perhaps even ever known in the same ethnic culture, as) the practice of opposite-gender spirit-possession mediumship. The latter practice (of opposite-gender spirit-possession mediumship) is attested in, e.g., Okinawa, Siam, and Burma, in each of which areas it would appear to be mainly (if not entirely) based on non-remembered (putatively non-conscious) trance. \n\nThe practice of dream-based spirit-marriage would appear likewise to exclude and be excluded by shallower trances involving some partial degree of control (but permanently and continuously, instead of merely intermittently as was the case in non-remembered trance) of the practitioner by a spirit-entity of opposite gender from that of the practitioner; which is attested not only among the [[Two-Spirit|berdache]] in tribes of the Great Plains of North America, but also among the manang in Borneo, and perhaps also among numerous other persons and geographic regions (including European practitioners of homosexual magic, etc.).\n\n===Asia===\nThai\u2014For a male spirit-medium, \"female spirits possess the medium on Saturdays\";<ref>Morris 2000, p. 297</ref> for which occasions the male medium is attired in feminine garments<ref>Morris 2000, p. 301</ref>\u2014these are events of spirit-possession by the medium's \"losing consciousness\".<ref>Morris 2000, p. 89</ref> However, dreaming is not significant for T'ai spirit-mediumship.<ref>Morris 2000, p. 290; referring to Gananath Obeyesekere: ''Medusa's Hair'', p. 180.</ref> (There is, nevertheless, some degree of similarity between this practice of becoming possessed by an opposite-gender spirit regularly on a particular day of the week; and the custom in Haitian spirit-marriage of regularly devoting a particular day of the week to one's marital duty to that spirit.)<ref>\"Once the ceremony is complete, the spouse will abstain from sexual relations on his or her Lwa's day of the week, reserving that time for visits from his or her divine mate.\" [https://books.google.com/books?id=4YnCr4N0i88C&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=Haiti+%22spirit+marriage%22+%22day+of+the+week%22&source=bl&ots=YayyPicGl4&sig=XYJ4YhNxVD-Sv3lQkZ-w-8KMpxQ&hl=en&ei=WHV0S9_VCtGXtgekqNy3Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Haiti%20%22spirit%20marriage%22%20%22day%20of%20the%20week%22&f=false Lilith Dorsey: ''Voodoo and Afro-Caribbean Paganism''.

As governor of Arkansas, Donaghey oversaw the construction of the state capitol building in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] and implemented founding of the state health unit and its agricultural colleges.\n\nHaving long felt a kinship to both states, after his gubernatorial tenure Donaghey commissioned a park on the border land and a monument. The monument is known for its intricate carvings and [[Art Deco]] style. It includes  references to different modes of transportation in 1831 and 1931 and mentions Louisiana Governor [[Huey P. Long, Jr.]], whose educational program Donaghey admired. The land was not registered with the state parks offices in either state, timber companies cut trees thereabouts, and the monument was forgotten.

As governor of Arkansas, Donaghey oversaw the construction of the state capitol building in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] and implemented founding of the state health unit and its agricultural colleges.\n\nHaving long felt a kinship to both states, after his gubernatorial tenure Donaghey commissioned a park on the border land and a monument. The monument is known for its intricate carvings and [[Art Deco]] style. It includes  references to different modes of transportation in 1831 and 1931 and mentions Louisiana Governor [[Huey P. Long, Jr.]], whose educational program Donaghey admired. The land was not registered with the state parks offices in either state, timber companies cut trees thereabouts, and the monument was forgotten.

He was the mentor and elder brother of film director [[John Ford]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=Mary|title=100 People who Changed 20th-century America|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610690850|page=145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVBS79mK7bUC&pg=PA145&dq=%22Francis+Feeney%22+actor&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj9g_i2rKfTAhWD8YMKHZmeAcgQ6AEIOTAE#v=onepage&q=%22Francis%20Feeney%22%20actor&f=false|accessdate=15 April 2017|language=en}}</ref> He also appeared in many of the latter's movies, including ''[[Young Mr. Lincoln]]'' (1939) and ''[[The Quiet Man]]'' (1952).\n\n== Biography ==\n[[File:Broken Coin 1915.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Production still of the cast and crew of the Universal silent serial ''[[The Broken Coin]]'' (1915).

A cameraman, likely Harry McGuire Stanley, is  sitting (front right) with a Path\u00e9 film camera between his feet.]]\nFrancis Ford was born in [[Portland, Maine]]. He was the son of John Augustine Feeney, who was born in the village of [[Spiddal]], [[County Galway]], Ireland, on June 15, 1854. His mother was Barbara \"Abbey\" Curran. By 1878, John had moved to Portland, Maine, and opened a saloon, at 42 Center Street, that used a false front to pose as grocery store. John opened four others in following years.\n\nAfter service in the [[United States Army]] in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] (In ''Pappy: The Life Of John Ford'', Dan Ford wrote about Francis Ford and the war, \"The Army soon discovered that he was only fifteen and sent him home.\"),<ref name=\"p\">{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=Dan|title=Pappy: The Life Of John Ford|date=1998|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=0306808757|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wLwE0gubL_wC&pg=PA6&dq=%22Francis+Feeney%22+actor&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj9g_i2rKfTAhWD8YMKHZmeAcgQ6AEIPjAF#v=onepage&q=%22Francis%20Feeney%22%20actor&f=false|accessdate=15 April 2017|language=en}}</ref> Francis left home. He drifted into the film business in New York City, working for [[David Horsley]], [[Al Christie]] and the [[Star Film Company]]'s San Antonio operation under [[Gaston M\u00e9li\u00e8s]]. He adopted the name Ford from the automobile.<ref>Scott Eyman, ''Print the Legend'', page 40</ref> From San Antonio, Francis began his Hollywood career working for [[Thomas H. Ince]] at [[Thomas H. Ince#Inceville|Ince's Bison studio]], directing and appearing in westerns.\n\nFrancis Ford's younger brother, John M. Feeney, nicknamed \"Bull,\" was a successful fullback and defensive tackle on a Portland High state championship [[American football|football]] team. In 1914, \"Bull\" followed Francis to Hollywood, changed his name to [[John Ford]] and eventually surpassed his elder brother's considerable reputation.\n\nFrancis Ford's son, [[Philip Ford (film director)|Philip Ford]], was also a film actor/director. Ford died after being diagnosed with cancer.\n\n== Work ==\n[[File:A Study in Scarlet 1914.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for ''A Study in Scarlet'', directed by and starring Francis Ford 1914]]\n[[File:Francis ford 1915.png.jpg|165px|right|thumb|1915 in Universal post cards]]\nFord may have acted in over 400 films, with many of his early credits poorly documented and probably lost.\n\nAmbitious and prolific, in Ford's early work he cast himself as [[George Armstrong Custer]], [[Sherlock Holmes]] (with his younger brother as Dr. Watson) and [[Abraham Lincoln]], a role in which he specialized. By 1912, Ford was directing alongside Thomas Ince. It rapidly became clear that Ince was routinely taking credit for Ford's work,<ref>Scott Eyman, ''Print the Legend'', page 43</ref> so Ford moved to Universal in early 1913. His 1913 ''[[Lucille Love, Girl of Mystery]]'' was Universal's first serial, and the first of a string of very popular serials starring Ford's collaborator and lover [[Grace Cunard]]. The 1915 serial ''[[The Broken Coin]]'' was expanded from 15 to 22 episodes by popular demand, probably the height of Ford's career.\n\nIn 1917, Ford founded a short-lived independent company, Fordart Films, which released the 1918 ''Berlin via America'' with Phil Kelly, and briefly opened his own studio at Sunset Boulevard and [[Gower Street (Hollywood)|Gower Street]]. At the same time, Ford mentored his younger brother, collaborating frequently as writers, directors and actors in each other's projects, but as early as 1917, it was clear that John's star was on the rise. Frank's directorial style remained suitable for serials, but failed to evolve.<ref>Joseph McBride, ''Searching for John Ford'', page 94</ref> Ford's final known directoral credit is for the 1928 ''The Call of the Heart'', a 50-minute vehicle for \"Dynamite the Devil Dog\".\n\nThe Ford brothers were, at the best of times, critical of each other and sometimes sharply antagonistic. Ford wrote an unpublished memoir in 1934 called ''Up and Down the Ladder'' which is \"filled with bitter and sometimes heartrending complaints about how old-timers who had helped create the industry had been shunted aside by younger men.\"<ref>Joseph McBride, ''Searching for John Ford'', pages 94\u201395</ref> \nFrom the late 1920s, and for the next two decades, Ford sustained a career as a grizzled character actor and bit player. He is often uncredited, as in his appearance in [[James Whale]]'s 1931 ''Frankenstein''. Among his most memorable roles was that of the demented old man in ''[[The Ox-Bow Incident]]'' (1943).\n\n==Selected filmography==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*''[[The Immortal Alamo]]'' (1911, Short) - Navarre\n*''[[The Deserter (1912 film)|The Deserter]]'' (actor, 1912, Short) - The Deserter\n*''[[Custer's Last Fight]]'' (actor and director, 1912) - General George A.

A cameraman, likely Harry McGuire Stanley, is  sitting (front right) with a Path\u00e9 film camera between his feet.]]\nFrancis Ford was born in [[Portland, Maine]]. He was the son of John Augustine Feeney, who was born in the village of [[Spiddal]], [[County Galway]], Ireland, on June 15, 1854. His mother was Barbara \"Abbey\" Curran. By 1878, John had moved to Portland, Maine, and opened a saloon, at 42 Center Street, that used a false front to pose as grocery store. John opened four others in following years.  \n\nAfter service in the [[United States Army]] in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] (In ''Pappy: The Life Of John Ford'', Dan Ford wrote about Francis Ford and the war, \"The Army soon discovered that he was only fifteen and sent him home.\")<ref name=\"p\">{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=Dan|title=Pappy: The Life Of John Ford|date=1998|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=0306808757|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wLwE0gubL_wC&pg=PA6&dq=%22Francis+Feeney%22+actor&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj9g_i2rKfTAhWD8YMKHZmeAcgQ6AEIPjAF#v=onepage&q=%22Francis%20Feeney%22%20actor&f=false|accessdate=15 April 2017|language=en}}</ref>, Francis left home. He drifted into the film business in New York City, working for [[David Horsley]], [[Al Christie]] and the [[Star Film Company]]'s San Antonio operation under [[Gaston M\u00e9li\u00e8s]]. He adopted the name Ford from the automobile.<ref>Scott Eyman, ''Print the Legend'', page 40</ref> From San Antonio, Francis began his Hollywood career working for [[Thomas H. Ince]] at [[Thomas H. Ince#Inceville|Ince's Bison studio]], directing and appearing in westerns.\n\nFrancis Ford's younger brother, John M. Feeney, nicknamed \"Bull,\" was a successful fullback and defensive tackle on a Portland High state championship [[American football|football]] team. In 1914, \"Bull\" followed Francis to Hollywood, changed his name to [[John Ford]] and eventually surpassed his elder brother's considerable reputation.\n\nFrancis Ford's son, [[Philip Ford (film director)|Philip Ford]], was also a film actor/director. Ford died after being diagnosed with cancer.\n\n== Work ==\n[[File:A Study in Scarlet 1914.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for ''A Study in Scarlet'', directed by and starring Francis Ford 1914]]\n[[File:Francis ford 1915.png.jpg|165px|right|thumb|1915 in Universal post cards]]\nFord may have acted in over 400 films, with many of his early credits poorly documented and probably lost.  \n\nAmbitious and prolific, in Ford's early work he cast himself as [[George Armstrong Custer]], [[Sherlock Holmes]] (with his younger brother as Dr. Watson) and [[Abraham Lincoln]], a role in which he specialized. By 1912, Ford was directing alongside Thomas Ince. It rapidly became clear that Ince was routinely taking credit for Ford's work,<ref>Scott Eyman, ''Print the Legend'', page 43</ref> so Ford moved to Universal in early 1913. His 1913 ''[[Lucille Love, Girl of Mystery]]'' was Universal's first serial, and the first of a string of very popular serials starring Ford's collaborator and lover [[Grace Cunard]]. The 1915 serial ''[[The Broken Coin]]'' was expanded from 15 to 22 episodes by popular demand, probably the height of Ford's career.\n\nIn 1917, Ford founded a short-lived independent company, Fordart Films, which released the 1918 ''Berlin via America'' with Phil Kelly, and briefly opened his own studio at Sunset Boulevard and [[Gower Street (Hollywood)|Gower Street]]. At the same time, Ford mentored his younger brother, collaborating frequently as writers, directors and actors in each other's projects, but as early as 1917, it was clear that John's star was on the rise. Frank's directorial style remained suitable for serials, but failed to evolve.<ref>Joseph McBride, ''Searching for John Ford'', page 94</ref> Ford's final known directoral credit is for the 1928 ''The Call of the Heart'', a 50-minute vehicle for \"Dynamite the Devil Dog\".      \n\nThe Ford brothers were, at the best of times, critical of each other and sometimes sharply antagonistic. Ford wrote an unpublished memoir in 1934 called ''Up and Down the Ladder'' which is \"filled with bitter and sometimes heartrending complaints about how old-timers who had helped create the industry had been shunted aside by younger men.\"<ref>Joseph McBride, ''Searching for John Ford'', pages 94\u201395</ref> \nFrom the late 1920s, and for the next two decades, Ford sustained a career as a grizzled character actor and bit player. He is often uncredited, as in his appearance in [[James Whale]]'s 1931 ''Frankenstein''. Among his most memorable roles was that of the demented old man in ''[[The Ox-Bow Incident]]'' (1943).\n\n==Selected filmography==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*''[[The Immortal Alamo]]'' (1911, Short) - Navarre\n*''[[The Deserter (1912 film)|The Deserter]]'' (actor, 1912, Short) - The Deserter\n*''[[Custer's Last Fight]]'' (actor and director, 1912) - General George A.

In 2004, the editorial board voted to endorse Democratic US Senator [[John Kerry]]; after publisher Alex Machaskee overruled it, ordering the board to write an endorsement of Republican [[George W.

Editor Doug Clifton defended the paper's decision, sparking a feud with a pro-carry lobbyist group. State Senator Steve Austria called it abuse of the media access privilege, saying publishing these names would threaten the safety of the men and women who obtain these permits.

Wilson was a prominent critic of the administration. The decision to compel the reporters to reveal sources was seen in the news media as a license to go after reporters and newspapers in the courtroom for not revealing confidential informants. It was considered a violation of the trust between reporter and said informants. Clifton was vilified in the news media as \"having no backbone\" and he admitted that people could refer to him as \"chickenshit\". Clifton told the national press that while he and the reporters involved in the story were willing to be jailed for not revealing sources, the legal department of the Plain Dealer Publishing Company was worried that the newspaper itself would be sued and strongly opposed the printing of the stories. \"Talking isn't an option and jail is too high a price to pay\", Clifton said.<ref name=\"clifton2\">\"WHO HAS YOUR BACK? Journalism in the Corporate Age\", ''Columbia Journalism Review'', September 2005.</ref>\n\nThe controversy ended when the ''[[Cleveland Scene]]'', an [[alternative weekly]] Cleveland newspaper, published a similar story. ''The Plain Dealer'' then printed the withheld story. It was a report of a federal corruption probe of former [[List of mayors of Cleveland|Mayor]] [[Michael R.

In 2004, the editorial board voted to endorse Democratic US Senator [[John Kerry]]; after publisher Alex Machaskee overruled it, ordering the board to write an endorsement of Republican [[George W.

Wilson was a prominent critic of the administration. The decision to compel the reporters to reveal sources was seen in the news media as a license to go after reporters and newspapers in the courtroom for not revealing confidential informants. It was considered a violation of the trust between reporter and said informants. Clifton was vilified in the news media as \"having no backbone\" and he admitted that people could refer to him as \"chickenshit\". Clifton told the national press that while he and the reporters involved in the story were willing to be jailed for not revealing sources, the legal department of the Plain Dealer Publishing Company was worried that the newspaper itself would be sued and strongly opposed the printing of the stories. \"Talking isn't an option and jail is too high a price to pay\", Clifton said.<ref name=\"clifton2\">\"WHO HAS YOUR BACK?

A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes, and the team that scores more goals wins.\n\nModern handball is played on a court of {{convert|40|by|20|m|ft}}, with a goal in the middle of each end. The goals are surrounded by a {{Convert|6|meter|adj=on}} zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed; goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while \"diving\" into it. The sport is usually played indoors, but outdoor variants exist in the forms of [[field handball]], [[Czech handball]] (which were more common in the past) and [[beach handball]]. The game is fast and high-scoring: professional teams now typically score between 20 and 35 goals each, though lower scores were not uncommon until a few decades ago. Some players may score [[hat tricks]]. Body contact is permitted: the defenders trying to stop the attackers from approaching the goal. No protective equipment is mandated, but players may wear soft protective bands, pads and mouth guards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.handbal.nl/userfiles/Scheidsrechters/170801_Clarifications_equipment_IHF.pdf |title=IHF Rules of the Game: Regulations on Protective Equipment and Accessories |publisher=Nederlands Handbal Verbond |access-date=3 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe game was codified at the end of the 19th century in Denmark.

Although detailed textual reference is rare, there are numerous descriptions of ball games being played where players throw the ball to one another; sometimes this is done in order to avoid interception by a player on the opposing team. Such games were played widely and served as both a form of exercise and a social event.<ref>Gardiner, E. Norman, 'Ball play' in ''Athletics of the Ancient World'', Oxford: OUP, 1967, pp.230-238</ref>\n\nThere is evidence of ancient Roman women playing a version of handball called ''expulsim ludere''.<ref>John Anthony Cuddon, ''The Macmillan Dictionary of Sports and Games'', p.393, Macmillan, 1980, {{ISBN|0-333-19163-3}}</ref> There are records of handball-like games in medieval [[France]], and among the [[Inuit]] in [[Greenland]], in the [[Middle Ages]]. By the 19th century, there existed similar games of ''h\u00e5ndbold'' from [[Denmark]], ''[[Czech handball|h\u00e1zen\u00e1]]'' in the [[Czech Republic]], ''handbol'' in [[Ukraine]], and ''[[torball]]'' in [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Serinex.NET|first1=SegaAlex in|title=Handball History : HAND-BALL.ORG|url=http://www.hand-ball.org/historia/|website=www.hand-ball.org|accessdate=28 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe team handball game of today was codified at the end of the 19th century in northern [[Europe]]: primarily in [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]. The first written set of team handball rules was published in 1906 by the Danish gym teacher, [[lieutenant]] and Olympic medalist [[Holger Nielsen]] from [[Ordrup]] grammar school, north of [[Copenhagen]]. The modern set of rules was published on 29 October 1917 by Max Heiser, [[Karl Schelenz]], and Erich Konigh from [[Berlin]], Germany. 29 October 1917 is therefore seen as the \"date of birth\" of the sport.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> The first ever official handball match was played on 2 December 1917 in Berlin.<ref name=\":2\" /> After 1919 the rules were improved by Karl Schelenz. The first international games were played under these rules, between [[Germany national handball team|Germany]] and [[Belgium national handball team|Belgium]] by men in 1925 and between [[Germany women's national handball team|Germany]] and [[Austria women's national handball team|Austria]] by women in 1930.\n\nIn 1926, the Congress of the [[International Association of Athletics Federations|International Amateur Athletics Federation]] nominated a committee to draw up international rules for field handball. The [[International Amateur Handball Federation]] was formed in 1928 and later the [[International Handball Federation]] was formed in 1946.\n\nMen's field handball was played at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin. During the next several decades, indoor handball flourished and evolved in the Scandinavian countries. The sport re-emerged onto the world stage as team handball for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]]. Women's team handball was added at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]]. Due to its popularity in the region, the Eastern European countries that refined the event became the dominant force in the sport when it was reintroduced.\n\nThe [[International Handball Federation]] organised the men's world championship in 1938 and every four (sometimes three) years from World War II to 1995. Since the 1995 world championship in Iceland, the competition has been held every two years. The women's world championship has been held since 1957. The IHF also organizes women's and men's junior world championships. By July 2009, the IHF listed 166 member federations - approximately 795,000 teams and 19 million players.\n\n==Rules==\nThe rules are laid out in the IHF's set of rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ihf.info/upload/Manual/IHF_STATUTS_CHAP_9A_GB.pdf |title=The official Handball rules (PDF) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Summary===\n\nTwo teams of seven players (six field players plus one goalkeeper) take the field and attempt to score points by putting the game ball into the opposing team's goal. In handling the ball, players are subject to the following restrictions:\n\n* After receiving the ball, players can pass, keep possession, or shoot the ball.\n* If possessing the ball, players must dribble (similar to a [[Dribbling#Basketball|basketball dribble]]), or can take up to three steps for up to three seconds at a time without dribbling.\n* No attacking or defending players other than the defending goalkeeper are allowed to touch the floor of the goal area (within six metres of the goal). A shot or pass in the goal area is valid if completed ''before touching the floor''. Goalkeepers are allowed outside the goal area, but are not allowed to cross the goal area boundary with the ball in their hands.\n* The ball may not be passed back to the goalkeeper when they are positioned in the goal area.\n\nNotable scoring opportunities can occur when attacking players jump into the goal area. For example, an attacking player may catch a pass while launching inside the goal area, and then shoot or pass before touching the floor. ''Doubling'' occurs when a diving attacking player passes to another diving teammate.\n\n===Playing court===\n[[File:Handball field en.svg|thumb|Schematic diagram of a handball playing field]]\n[[File:Rukometno igrali\u0161te kod Macanovog doma, \u010cakovec.2.jpg|thumb|An outdoor handball playing field]]\nHandball is played on a court {{convert|40|x|20|m|ft}}, with a goal in the centre of each end. The goals are surrounded by a near-semicircular area, called the zone or the crease, defined by a line six meters from the goal. A dashed near-semicircular line nine metres from the goal marks the free-throw line. Each line on the court is part of the area it encompasses. This implies that the middle line belongs to both halves at the same time.\n\n====Goals====\nThe goals are two meters high and three meters wide. They must be securely bolted either to the floor or the wall behind.\n\nThe goal posts and the crossbar must be made out of the same material (e.g., [[wood]] or [[aluminium]]) and feature a quadratic cross section with sides of {{convert|8|cm|0|abbr=on}}. The three sides of the beams visible from the playing field must be painted alternatingly in two contrasting colors which both have to contrast against the background. The colors on both goals must be the same.\n\nEach goal must feature a net. This must be fastened in such a way that a ball thrown into the goal does not leave or pass the goal under normal circumstances. If necessary, a second net may be clasped to the back of the net on the inside.\n\n====D-Zone====\nThe goals are surrounded by the crease. This area is delineated by two quarter circles with a radius of six metres around the far corners of each goal post and a connecting line parallel to the goal line. Only the defending goalkeeper is allowed inside this zone. However, the court players may catch and touch the ball in the air within it as long as the player starts his jump outside the zone and releases the ball before he lands (landing inside the perimeter is allowed in this case as long as the ball has been released).\n\nIf a player without the ball contacts the ground inside the goal perimeter, or the line surrounding the perimeter, he must take the most direct path out of it. However, should a player cross the zone in an attempt to gain an advantage (e.g., better position) their team cedes the ball. Similarly, violation of the zone by a defending player is penalized only if they do so in order to gain an advantage in defending.\n\n====Substitution area====\nOutside of one long edge of the court to both sides of the middle line are the substitution areas for each team. Team officials, substitutes, and suspended players must wait within this area. A team's area is the same side as the goal the team is defending; during halftime, substitution areas are swapped. Any player entering or leaving the play must cross the substitution line which is part of the side line and extends {{convert|4.5|m|ft}} from the middle line to the team's side.\n\n===Duration===\n[[File: Team Time Out Handball.jpg|thumb|Team timeout]] A standard match has two 30-minute halves with a 10- or 15-minute (major Championships/Olympics) halftime intermission. At half-time, teams switch sides of the court as well as benches. For youths, the length of the halves is reduced\u201425 minutes at ages 12 to 15, and 20 minutes at ages 8 to 11; though national federations of some countries may differ in their implementation from the official guidelines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ihf.info/files/Uploads/NewsAttachments/0_New-Rules%20of%20the%20Game_GB.pdf|title=Rules of the Game}}</ref>\n\nIf a decision must be reached in a particular match (e.g., in a tournament) and it ends in a draw after regular time, there are at maximum two overtimes, each consisting of two straight 5-minute periods with a one-minute break in between. Should these not decide the game either, the winning team is determined in a penalty shootout (best-of-five rounds; if still tied, extra rounds are added until one team wins).\n\nThe referees may call ''[[Time-out (sport)|timeout]]'' according to their sole discretion; typical reasons are injuries, suspensions, or court cleaning. Penalty throws should trigger a timeout only for lengthy delays, such as a change of the goalkeeper.\n\nSince 2012, teams can call 3 ''team timeouts'' per game (up to two per half), which last one minute each. This right may only be invoked by the team in possession of the ball. Team representatives must show a green card marked with a black ''T'' on the timekeeper's desk. The timekeeper then immediately interrupts the game by sounding an acoustic signal to stop the clock. Before 2012,  teams were allowed only one timeout per half. For the purpose of calling timeouts, overtime and shootouts are extensions of the second half.\n\n===Referees===\nA handball match is adjudicated by two equal referees. Some national bodies allow games with only a single referee in special cases like illness on short notice. Should the referees disagree on any occasion, a decision is made on mutual agreement during a short timeout; or, in case of punishments, the more severe of the two comes into effect. The referees are obliged to make their decisions \"on the basis of their observations of facts\".<ref>Official rules, rule 17:11</ref> Their judgements are final and can be appealed against only if not in compliance with the rules.\n\n[[File:Kronau-Oestringen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The referees (blue shirts) keep both teams between them.]]\n\nThe referees position themselves in such a way that the team players are confined between them. They stand diagonally aligned so that each can observe one side line. Depending on their positions, one is called ''field referee'' and the other ''goal referee''. These positions automatically switch on ball turnover. They physically exchange their positions approximately every 10 minutes (long exchange), and change sides every five minutes (short exchange).\n\nThe IHF defines 18 hand signals for quick visual communication with players and officials. The signal for warning is accompanied by a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]].<ref>Official rules, hand signal 16:2</ref> A disqualification for the game is indicated by a [[Penalty card#Red card|red card]],<ref>Official rules 16:7</ref> followed by a [[Penalty card#Blue card|blue card]] if the disqualification will be accompanied by a report.<ref>Official rules 16:8</ref> The referees also use whistle blows to indicate infractions or to restart the play.\n\nThe referees are supported by a ''scorekeeper'' and a ''timekeeper'' who attend to formal things such as keeping track of goals and suspensions, or starting and stopping the clock, respectively. They also keep an eye on the benches and notify the referees on substitution errors. Their desk is located between the two substitution areas.\n\n===Team players, substitutes, and officials===\nEach team consists of seven players on court and seven substitute players on the bench. One player on the court must be the designated goalkeeper, differing in his clothing from the rest of the field players. Substitution of players can be done in any number and at any time during game play. An exchange takes place over the substitution line. A prior notification of the referees is not necessary.\n\nSome national bodies, such as the Deutsche Handball Bund (DHB, \"German Handball Federation\"), allow substitution in junior teams only when in ball possession or during timeouts. This restriction is intended to prevent early specialization of players to offence or defence.\n\n====Field players====\nField players are allowed to touch the ball with any part of their bodies above and including the knee. As in several other team sports, a distinction is made between catching and [[dribbling]]. A player who is in possession of the ball may stand stationary for only three seconds, and may take only three steps. They must then either shoot, pass, or dribble the ball. Taking more than three steps at any time is considered travelling, and results in a turnover. A player may dribble as many times as they want (though, since passing is faster, it is the preferred method of attack), as long as during each dribble the hand contacts only the top of the ball. Therefore, [[Carrying (basketball)|carrying]] is completely prohibited, and results in a turnover. After the dribble is picked up, the player has the right to another three seconds or three steps. The ball must then be passed or shot, as further holding or dribbling will result in a ''double dribble'' turnover and a free throw for the other team. Other offensive infractions that result in a turnover include charging and setting an illegal screen. Carrying the ball into the six-meter zone results either in ball possession by the goalkeeper (by attacker) or turnover (by defender).\n\n====Goalkeeper====\nOnly the [[Handball goalkeeper|goalkeepers]] are allowed to move freely within the goal perimeter, although they may not cross the goal perimeter line while carrying or dribbling the ball. Within the zone, they are allowed to touch the ball with all parts of their bodies, including their feet, with a defensive aim (for other actions, they are subject to the same restrictions as the field players). The goalkeepers may participate in the normal play of their teammates. They may be substituted by a regular field player if their team elects to use this scheme in order to outnumber the defending players. Earlier, this field player become the designated goalkeeper on the court; and had to wear some vest or bib to be identified as such. That shirt had to be equal in colour and form to the goalkeeper's shirt, to avoid confusion. A rule change meant to make the game more offensive now allows any player to substitute with the goalkeeper. The new rule resembles the one used in ice hockey. This rule was first used in the women's world championship in December 2015 and has since been used by the men's European championship in January 2016 and by both genders in the Olympic tournament in Rio in 2016.\n\nIf either goalkeeper deflects the ball over the outer goal line, their team stays in possession of the ball, in contrast to other sports like [[Association football|football]]. The goalkeeper resumes the play with a throw from within the zone (\"goalkeeper throw\"). Passing to one's own goalkeeper results in a turnover. In a penalty shot, throwing the ball against the head of a goalkeeper who is not moving risks a direct disqualification (\"red card\").\n\nOutside of own D-zone, the goalkeeper is treated as a current field player, and has to follow field players' rules; holding or tackling an opponent player outside the area risks a direct disqualification.{{clarify|date=August 2016}} The goalkeeper may not return to the area with the ball.\n\n====Team officials====\nEach team is allowed to have a maximum of four team officials seated on the benches. An official is anybody who is neither player nor substitute. One official must be the designated representative who is usually the [[Coach (sport)|team manager]]. Since 2012, representatives can call up to 3 team timeouts (up to twice per half), and may address the scorekeeper, timekeeper, and referees (before that, it was once per half); overtime and shootouts are considered extensions of the second half. Other officials typically include [[physician]]s or managers. Neither official is allowed to enter the playing court without the permission of the referees.\n\n===Ball===\n[[File:Handball the ball.jpg|thumb|A size III handball]] The ball is spherical and must be made either of leather or a synthetic material. It is not allowed to have a shiny or slippery surface. As the ball is intended to be operated by a single hand, its official sizes vary depending on age and gender of the participating teams.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"column\"| Size\n!scope=\"column\"| Class\n!scope=\"column\"| Circumference <br /> (cm)\n!scope=\"column\"| Circumference <br /> (in)\n!scope=\"column\"| Weight <br /> (g)\n!scope=\"column\"| Weight <br /> (oz)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| III\n| Male over-16s\n|{{convert|58|\u2013|60|cm|in|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|425|\u2013|475|g|oz|disp=table}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| II\n| Women, male over-12s, and female over-14s\n| {{convert|54|\u2013|56|cm|in|disp=table}}\n| {{convert|325|\u2013|375|g|oz|disp=table}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| I\n| Over-8s\n| {{convert|50|\u2013|52|cm|in|disp=table}}\n| {{convert|290|\u2013|330|g|oz|disp=table}}\n|}\n\n===Awarded throws===\nThe referees may award a special throw to a team. This usually happens after certain events such as scored goals, off-court balls, turnovers and timeouts. All of these special throws require the thrower to obtain a certain position, and pose restrictions on the positions of all other players. Sometimes the execution must wait for a whistle blow by the referee.\n\n;Throw-off: A throw-off takes place from the center of the court. The thrower must touch the middle line with one foot, and all the other offensive players must stay in their half until the referee restarts the game. The defending players must keep a distance of at least three meters from the thrower until the ball leaves his hand. A throw-off occurs at the beginning of each period and after the opposing team scores a goal. It must be cleared by the referees.\n\n:Modern handball introduced the \"fast throw-off\" concept; i.e., the play will be immediately restarted by the referees as soon as the executing team fulfills its requirements. Many teams leverage this rule to score easy goals before the opposition has time to form a stable defense line.\n\n;Throw-in: The team which did not touch the ball last is awarded a throw-in when the ball fully crosses the side line or touches the ceiling. If the ball crosses the outer goal line, a throw-in is awarded only if the defending field players touched the ball last. Execution requires the thrower to place one foot on the nearest outer line to the cause. All defending players must keep a distance of {{Convert|3|m|spell=in}}. However, they are allowed to stand immediately outside their own goal area even when the distance is less than three meters.\n\n;Goalkeeper-throw: If the ball crosses the outer goal line without interference from the defending team or when deflected by the defending team's goalkeeper, or when the attacking team violates the D-zone as described above, a goalkeeper-throw is awarded to the defending team. This is the most common turnover. The goalkeeper resumes the play with a throw from anywhere within the goal area.\n\n;Free-throw: A free-throw restarts the play after an interruption by the referees. It takes places from the spot where the interruption was caused, as long as this spot is outside of the free-throw line of the opposing team. In the latter case, the throw is deferred to the nearest spot on the free-throw line. Free-throws are the equivalent to [[Direct free kick|free-kicks]] in association football; however, conceding them is typically not seen as poor sportsmanship for the defending side, and in itself, they carry no major disadvantages. (In particular, being awarded a free throw while being on warning for passive play will not reset the warning, whereas a shot on goal will.)  The thrower may take a direct attempt for a goal which, however, is rarely feasible if the defending team has organised a defense. However, if a free throw is awarded and the half or game ends, a direct throw at the goal is typically attempted, which occasionally goes in.\n\n[[File:Kr-Oe-Siebenmeter.jpg|thumb|A seven-metre throw]]\n;Seven-meter throw: A seven-meter throw is awarded when a clear chance of scoring is illegally prevented anywhere on the court by an opposing team player, official, or spectator. It is awarded also when the referees have interrupted a legitimate scoring chance for any reason. The thrower steps with one foot behind the {{Convert|7|m|adj=on|spell=in}} line with only the defending goalkeeper between him and the goal. The goalkeeper must keep a distance of {{Convert|3|m|spell=in}}, which is marked by a short tick on the floor. All other players must remain behind the free-throw line until execution and the defending field players must keep a distance of three meters. The thrower must await the whistle blow of the referee. A seven-meter throw is the equivalent to a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] in association football; however, it is far more common and typically occurs several times in a single game.\n\n===Penalties===\n[[File:Yellow card handball.jpg|thumb|right|Yellow card shown in a handball match]]\nPenalties are given to players, in progressive format, for fouls that require more punishment than just a free-throw. Actions directed mainly at the opponent and not the ball (such as reaching around, holding, pushing, tripping, and jumping into opponent) as well as contact from the side, from behind a player or impeding the opponent's counterattack are all considered illegal and are subject to penalty. Any infraction that prevents a clear scoring opportunity will result in a seven-meter penalty shot.\n\nTypically the referee will give a warning yellow card for an illegal action; but, if the contact was particularly dangerous, like striking the opponent in the head, neck or throat, the referee can forego the warning for an immediate two-minute suspension. Players are warned once before given a yellow card; they risk being red-carded if they draw three yellows.\n\nA red card results in an ejection from the game and a two-minute penalty for the team. A player may receive a red card directly for particularly rough penalties. For instance, any contact from behind during a fast break is now being treated with a red card; as does any deliberate intent to injure opponents. A red-carded player has to leave the playing area completely. A player who is disqualified may be substituted with another player after the two-minute penalty is served. A coach or official can also be penalized progressively. Any coach or official who receives a two-minute suspension will have to pull out one of their players for two minutes; however, the player is not the one punished, and can be substituted in again, as the penalty consists of the team playing with one fewer player than the opposing team.\n\nAfter referees award the ball to the opponents for whatever reason, the player currently in possession of the ball has to lay it down quickly, or risk a two-minute suspension. Also, gesticulating or verbally questioning the referee's order, as well as arguing with the officials' decisions, will normally risk a yellow card. If the suspended player protests further, does not walk straight off the field to the bench, or if the referee deems the tempo deliberately slow, that player risks a double yellow card. Illegal substitution (outside of the dedicated area, or if the replacement player enters too early) is prohibited; if they do, they risk a yellow card.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Formations===\n[[File:5-1-Deckung.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Positions of attacking (red) and defending players (blue), in a 5-1 defense formation]]\n[[File:6-0-Deckung.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Positions of attacking (red) and defending players (blue), in a 6-0 defense formation]]\nPlayers are typically referred to by the positions they are playing. The positions are always denoted from the view of the respective goalkeeper, so that a defender on the right opposes an attacker on the left. However, not all of the following positions may be occupied depending on the formation or potential suspensions.\n\n====Offense====\n* Left and right wingman.These typically are fast players who excel at ball control and wide jumps from the outside of the goal perimeter in order to get into a better shooting angle at the goal. Teams usually try to occupy the left position with a right-handed player and vice versa.\n* Left and right backcourt. Goal attempts by these players are typically made by jumping high and shooting over the defenders. Thus, it is usually advantageous to have tall players with a powerful shot for these positions.\n* Centre backcourt. A player with experience is preferred on this position who acts as playmaker and the handball equivalent of a basketball [[point guard]].\n* Pivot (left and right, if applicable). This player tends to intermingle with the defence, setting picks and attempting to disrupt the defence's formation. This position requires the least jumping skills; but ball control and physical strength are an advantage.\n\nSometimes, the offense uses formations with two pivot players.\n\n====Defense====\nThere are many variations in defensive formations. Usually, they are described as ''n:m'' formations, where ''n'' is the number of players defending at the goal line and ''m'' the number of players defending more offensive. Exceptions are the 3:2:1 defense and n+m formation (e.g. 5+1), where m players defend some offensive player in man coverage (instead of the usual zone coverage).\n* Far left and far right. The opponents of the wingmen.\n* Half left and half right. The opponents of the left and right backcourts.\n* Back center (left and right). Opponent of the pivot.\n* Front center. Opponent of the center backcourt, may also be set against another specific backcourt player.\n\n===Offensive play===\nAttacks are played with all field players on the side of the defenders. Depending on the speed of the attack, one distinguishes between three attack ''waves'' with a decreasing chance of success:\n\n[[File:Mara Friton Handball.jpg|thumb|Women's handball - a jump shot completes a fast-break]]\n[[File:Kiril Lazarov 09.jpg|thumb|Men's handball - a jump shot ([[Kiril Lazarov]], world record-holder for the number of goals scored in one world championship) ]]\n;First wave: ''First wave'' attacks are characterised by the absence of defending players around their goal perimeter. The chance of success is very high, as the throwing player is unhindered in his scoring attempt. Such attacks typically occur after an intercepted pass or a steal, and if the defending team can switch fast to offence. The far left or far right will usually try to run the attack, as they are not as tightly bound in the defence. On a turnover, they immediately sprint forward and receive the ball halfway to the other goal. Thus, these positions are commonly held by quick players.\n;Second wave: If the first wave is not successful and some defending players have gained their positions around the zone, the second wave comes into play: the remaining players advance with quick passes to locally outnumber the retreating defenders. If one player manages to step up to the perimeter or catches the ball at this spot, he becomes unstoppable by legal defensive means. From this position, the chance of success is naturally very high. Second wave attacks became much more important with the \"fast throw-off\" rule.\n\n;Third wave: The time during which the second wave may be successful is very short, as then the defenders closed the gaps around the zone. In the ''third wave'', the attackers use standardised attack patterns usually involving crossing and passing between the back court players who either try to pass the ball through a gap to their pivot, take a jumping shot from the backcourt at the goal, or lure the defence away from a wingman.\n\nThe third wave evolves into the normal offensive play when all defenders not only reach the zone, but gain their accustomed positions. Some teams then substitute specialised offence players. However, this implies that these players must play in the defence should the opposing team be able to switch quickly to offence. The latter is another benefit for fast playing teams.\n\nIf the attacking team does not make sufficient progress (eventually releasing a shot on goal), the referees can call '''passive play''' (since about 1995, the referee gives a passive warning some time before the actual call by holding one hand up in the air, signalling that the attacking team should release a shot soon), turning control over to the other team. A shot on goal or an infringement leading to a yellow card or two-minute penalty will mark the start of a new attack, causing the hand to be taken down; but a shot blocked by the defense or a normal free throw will not. If it were not for this rule, it would be easy for an attacking team to stall the game indefinitely, as it is difficult to intercept a pass without at the same time conceding dangerous openings towards the goal.\n\n===Defensive play===\nThe usual formations of the defense are 6\u20130, when all the defense players line up between the {{Convert|6|m|adj=on}} and {{Convert|9|m|adj=on}} lines to form a wall; the 5\u20131, when one of the players cruises outside the {{Convert|9|m|adj=on}} perimeter, usually targeting the center forwards while the other 5 line up on the {{Convert|6|m|adj=on}} line; and the less common 4\u20132 when there are two such defenders out front. Very fast teams will also try a 3\u20133 formation which is close to a switching man-to-man style. The formations vary greatly from country to country, and reflect each country's style of play. 6\u20130 is sometimes known as \"flat defense\", and all other formations are usually called \"offensive defense\".\n\n==Organization==\nHandball teams are usually organised as [[sports club|clubs]]. On a national level, the clubs are associated in federations which organize matches in leagues and tournaments.\n\n===International body===\nThe [[International Handball Federation]] (IHF) is the administrative and controlling body for international handball.

A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes, and the team that scores more goals wins.\n\nModern handball is played on a court of {{convert|40|by|20|m|ft}}, with a goal in the middle of each end. The goals are surrounded by a {{Convert|6|meter|adj=on}} zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed; goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while \"diving\" into it. The sport is usually played indoors, but outdoor variants exist in the forms of [[field handball]], [[Czech handball]] (which were more common in the past) and [[beach handball]]. The game is fast and high-scoring: professional teams now typically score between 20 and 35 goals each, though lower scores were not uncommon until a few decades ago. Some players may score [[hat tricks]]. Body contact is permitted: the defenders trying to stop the attackers from approaching the goal. No protective equipment is mandated, but players may wear soft protective bands, pads and mouth guards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.handbal.nl/userfiles/Scheidsrechters/170801_Clarifications_equipment_IHF.pdf |title=IHF Rules of the Game: Regulations on Protective Equipment and Accessories |publisher=Nederlands Handbal Verbond |access-date=3 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe game was codified at the end of the 19th century in Denmark.

Women's team handball was added at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]].\n\nThe [[International Handball Federation]] was formed in 1946 and, {{as of|2016|lc=1}}, has 197 member federations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ihf.info/TheIHF/MemberFederations/tabid/161/Default.aspx |title=Member Federations |publisher=International Handball Federation}}</ref> The sport is most popular in Europe, and European countries have won all medals but one in the [[IHF World Men's Handball Championship|men's world championships]] since 1938. In the [[IHF World Women's Handball Championship|women's world championships]], only two non-European countries have won the title: South Korea and Brazil. The game also enjoys popularity in [[East Asia]], [[North Africa]] and parts of [[South America]].\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n== Origins and development ==\n[[File:Handball pick-a-back Ancient Greece.jpg|thumb|A picture copied from an amphora shows youths play a version of handball, circa 500 B.C.]]\n[[File:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1972, MiNr 1757.jpg|thumb|A postage stamp from East Germany depicting handball at the 1972 Olympics]]\nGames similar to handball were played in [[Ancient Greece]] and are represented on amphoras and stone carvings. Although detailed textual reference is rare, there are numerous descriptions of ball games being played where players throw the ball to one another; sometimes this is done in order to avoid interception by a player on the opposing team. Such games were played widely and served as both a form of exercise and a social event.<ref>Gardiner, E. Norman, 'Ball play' in ''Athletics of the Ancient World'', Oxford: OUP, 1967, pp.230-238</ref>\n\nThere is evidence of ancient Roman women playing a version of handball called ''expulsim ludere''.<ref>John Anthony Cuddon, ''The Macmillan Dictionary of Sports and Games'', p.393, Macmillan, 1980, {{ISBN|0-333-19163-3}}</ref> There are records of handball-like games in medieval [[France]], and among the [[Inuit]] in [[Greenland]], in the [[Middle Ages]]. By the 19th century, there existed similar games of ''h\u00e5ndbold'' from [[Denmark]], ''[[Czech handball|h\u00e1zen\u00e1]]'' in the [[Czech Republic]], ''handbol'' in [[Ukraine]], and ''[[torball]]'' in [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Serinex.NET|first1=SegaAlex in|title=Handball History : HAND-BALL.ORG|url=http://www.hand-ball.org/historia/|website=www.hand-ball.org|accessdate=28 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe team handball game of today was codified at the end of the 19th century in northern [[Europe]]: primarily in [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]. The first written set of team handball rules was published in 1906 by the Danish gym teacher, [[lieutenant]] and Olympic medalist [[Holger Nielsen]] from [[Ordrup]] grammar school, north of [[Copenhagen]]. The modern set of rules was published on 29 October 1917 by Max Heiser, [[Karl Schelenz]], and Erich Konigh from [[Berlin]], Germany. 29 October 1917 is therefore seen as the \"date of birth\" of the sport.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> The first ever official handball match was played on 2 December 1917 in Berlin.<ref name=\":2\" /> After 1919 the rules were improved by Karl Schelenz. The first international games were played under these rules, between [[Germany national handball team|Germany]] and [[Belgium national handball team|Belgium]] by men in 1925 and between [[Germany women's national handball team|Germany]] and [[Austria women's national handball team|Austria]] by women in 1930.\n\nIn 1926, the Congress of the [[International Association of Athletics Federations|International Amateur Athletics Federation]] nominated a committee to draw up international rules for field handball. The [[International Amateur Handball Federation]] was formed in 1928 and later the [[International Handball Federation]] was formed in 1946.\n\nMen's field handball was played at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin. During the next several decades, indoor handball flourished and evolved in the Scandinavian countries. The sport re-emerged onto the world stage as team handball for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]]. Women's team handball was added at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]]. Due to its popularity in the region, the Eastern European countries that refined the event became the dominant force in the sport when it was reintroduced.\n\nThe [[International Handball Federation]] organised the men's world championship in 1938 and every four (sometimes three) years from World War II to 1995. Since the 1995 world championship in Iceland, the competition has been held every two years. The women's world championship has been held since 1957. The IHF also organizes women's and men's junior world championships. By July 2009, the IHF listed 166 member federations - approximately 795,000 teams and 19 million players.\n\n==Rules==\nThe rules are laid out in the IHF's set of rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ihf.info/upload/Manual/IHF_STATUTS_CHAP_9A_GB.pdf |title=The official Handball rules (PDF) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Summary===\n\nTwo teams of seven players (six field players plus one goalkeeper) take the field and attempt to score points by putting the game ball into the opposing team's goal. In handling the ball, players are subject to the following restrictions:\n\n* After receiving the ball, players can pass, keep possession, or shoot the ball.\n* If possessing the ball, players must dribble (similar to a [[Dribbling#Basketball|basketball dribble]]), or can take up to three steps for up to three seconds at a time without dribbling.\n* No attacking or defending players other than the defending goalkeeper are allowed to touch the floor of the goal area (within six metres of the goal). A shot or pass in the goal area is valid if completed ''before touching the floor''. Goalkeepers are allowed outside the goal area, but are not allowed to cross the goal area boundary with the ball in their hands.\n* The ball may not be passed back to the goalkeeper when they are positioned in the goal area.\n\nNotable scoring opportunities can occur when attacking players jump into the goal area. For example, an attacking player may catch a pass while launching inside the goal area, and then shoot or pass before touching the floor. ''Doubling'' occurs when a diving attacking player passes to another diving teammate.\n\n===Playing court===\n[[File:Handball field en.svg|thumb|Schematic diagram of a handball playing field]]\n[[File:Rukometno igrali\u0161te kod Macanovog doma, \u010cakovec.2.jpg|thumb|An outdoor handball playing field]]\nHandball is played on a court {{convert|40|x|20|m|ft}}, with a goal in the centre of each end. The goals are surrounded by a near-semicircular area, called the zone or the crease, defined by a line six meters from the goal. A dashed near-semicircular line nine metres from the goal marks the free-throw line. Each line on the court is part of the area it encompasses. This implies that the middle line belongs to both halves at the same time.\n\n====Goals====\nThe goals are two meters high and three meters wide. They must be securely bolted either to the floor or the wall behind.\n\nThe goal posts and the crossbar must be made out of the same material (e.g., [[wood]] or [[aluminium]]) and feature a quadratic cross section with sides of {{convert|8|cm|0|abbr=on}}. The three sides of the beams visible from the playing field must be painted alternatingly in two contrasting colors which both have to contrast against the background. The colors on both goals must be the same.\n\nEach goal must feature a net. This must be fastened in such a way that a ball thrown into the goal does not leave or pass the goal under normal circumstances. If necessary, a second net may be clasped to the back of the net on the inside.\n\n====D-Zone====\nThe goals are surrounded by the crease. This area is delineated by two quarter circles with a radius of six metres around the far corners of each goal post and a connecting line parallel to the goal line. Only the defending goalkeeper is allowed inside this zone. However, the court players may catch and touch the ball in the air within it as long as the player starts his jump outside the zone and releases the ball before he lands (landing inside the perimeter is allowed in this case as long as the ball has been released).\n\nIf a player without the ball contacts the ground inside the goal perimeter, or the line surrounding the perimeter, he must take the most direct path out of it. However, should a player cross the zone in an attempt to gain an advantage (e.g., better position) their team cedes the ball. Similarly, violation of the zone by a defending player is penalized only if they do so in order to gain an advantage in defending.\n\n====Substitution area====\nOutside of one long edge of the court to both sides of the middle line are the substitution areas for each team. Team officials, substitutes, and suspended players must wait within this area. A team's area is the same side as the goal the team is defending; during halftime, substitution areas are swapped. Any player entering or leaving the play must cross the substitution line which is part of the side line and extends {{convert|4.5|m|ft}} from the middle line to the team's side.\n\n===Duration===\n[[File: Team Time Out Handball.jpg|thumb|Team timeout]] A standard match has two 30-minute halves with a 10- or 15-minute (major Championships/Olympics) halftime intermission. At half-time, teams switch sides of the court as well as benches. For youths, the length of the halves is reduced\u201425 minutes at ages 12 to 15, and 20 minutes at ages 8 to 11; though national federations of some countries may differ in their implementation from the official guidelines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ihf.info/files/Uploads/NewsAttachments/0_New-Rules%20of%20the%20Game_GB.pdf|title=Rules of the Game}}</ref>\n\nIf a decision must be reached in a particular match (e.g., in a tournament) and it ends in a draw after regular time, there are at maximum two overtimes, each consisting of two straight 5-minute periods with a one-minute break in between. Should these not decide the game either, the winning team is determined in a penalty shootout (best-of-five rounds; if still tied, extra rounds are added until one team wins).\n\nThe referees may call ''[[Time-out (sport)|timeout]]'' according to their sole discretion; typical reasons are injuries, suspensions, or court cleaning. Penalty throws should trigger a timeout only for lengthy delays, such as a change of the goalkeeper.\n\nSince 2012, teams can call 3 ''team timeouts'' per game (up to two per half), which last one minute each. This right may only be invoked by the team in possession of the ball. Team representatives must show a green card marked with a black ''T'' on the timekeeper's desk. The timekeeper then immediately interrupts the game by sounding an acoustic signal to stop the clock. Before 2012,  teams were allowed only one timeout per half. For the purpose of calling timeouts, overtime and shootouts are extensions of the second half.\n\n===Referees===\nA handball match is adjudicated by two equal referees. Some national bodies allow games with only a single referee in special cases like illness on short notice. Should the referees disagree on any occasion, a decision is made on mutual agreement during a short timeout; or, in case of punishments, the more severe of the two comes into effect. The referees are obliged to make their decisions \"on the basis of their observations of facts\".<ref>Official rules, rule 17:11</ref> Their judgements are final and can be appealed against only if not in compliance with the rules.\n\n[[File:Kronau-Oestringen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The referees (blue shirts) keep both teams between them.]]\n\nThe referees position themselves in such a way that the team players are confined between them. They stand diagonally aligned so that each can observe one side line. Depending on their positions, one is called ''field referee'' and the other ''goal referee''. These positions automatically switch on ball turnover. They physically exchange their positions approximately every 10 minutes (long exchange), and change sides every five minutes (short exchange).\n\nThe IHF defines 18 hand signals for quick visual communication with players and officials. The signal for warning is accompanied by a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]].<ref>Official rules, hand signal 16:2</ref> A disqualification for the game is indicated by a [[Penalty card#Red card|red card]],<ref>Official rules 16:7</ref> followed by a [[Penalty card#Blue card|blue card]] if the disqualification will be accompanied by a report.<ref>Official rules 16:8</ref> The referees also use whistle blows to indicate infractions or to restart the play.\n\nThe referees are supported by a ''scorekeeper'' and a ''timekeeper'' who attend to formal things such as keeping track of goals and suspensions, or starting and stopping the clock, respectively. They also keep an eye on the benches and notify the referees on substitution errors. Their desk is located between the two substitution areas.\n\n===Team players, substitutes, and officials===\nEach team consists of seven players on court and seven substitute players on the bench. One player on the court must be the designated goalkeeper, differing in his clothing from the rest of the field players. Substitution of players can be done in any number and at any time during game play. An exchange takes place over the substitution line. A prior notification of the referees is not necessary.\n\nSome national bodies, such as the Deutsche Handball Bund (DHB, \"German Handball Federation\"), allow substitution in junior teams only when in ball possession or during timeouts. This restriction is intended to prevent early specialization of players to offence or defence.\n\n====Field players====\nField players are allowed to touch the ball with any part of their bodies above and including the knee. As in several other team sports, a distinction is made between catching and [[dribbling]]. A player who is in possession of the ball may stand stationary for only three seconds, and may take only three steps. They must then either shoot, pass, or dribble the ball. Taking more than three steps at any time is considered travelling, and results in a turnover. A player may dribble as many times as they want (though, since passing is faster, it is the preferred method of attack), as long as during each dribble the hand contacts only the top of the ball. Therefore, [[Carrying (basketball)|carrying]] is completely prohibited, and results in a turnover. After the dribble is picked up, the player has the right to another three seconds or three steps. The ball must then be passed or shot, as further holding or dribbling will result in a ''double dribble'' turnover and a free throw for the other team. Other offensive infractions that result in a turnover include charging and setting an illegal screen. Carrying the ball into the six-meter zone results either in ball possession by the goalkeeper (by attacker) or turnover (by defender).\n\n====Goalkeeper====\nOnly the [[Handball goalkeeper|goalkeepers]] are allowed to move freely within the goal perimeter, although they may not cross the goal perimeter line while carrying or dribbling the ball. Within the zone, they are allowed to touch the ball with all parts of their bodies, including their feet, with a defensive aim (for other actions, they are subject to the same restrictions as the field players). The goalkeepers may participate in the normal play of their teammates. They may be substituted by a regular field player if their team elects to use this scheme in order to outnumber the defending players. Earlier, this field player become the designated goalkeeper on the court; and had to wear some vest or bib to be identified as such. That shirt had to be equal in colour and form to the goalkeeper's shirt, to avoid confusion. A rule change meant to make the game more offensive now allows any player to substitute with the goalkeeper. The new rule resembles the one used in ice hockey. This rule was first used in the women's world championship in December 2015 and has since been used by the men's European championship in January 2016 and by both genders in the Olympic tournament in Rio in 2016.\n\nIf either goalkeeper deflects the ball over the outer goal line, their team stays in possession of the ball, in contrast to other sports like [[Association football|football]]. The goalkeeper resumes the play with a throw from within the zone (\"goalkeeper throw\"). Passing to one's own goalkeeper results in a turnover. In a penalty shot, throwing the ball against the head of a goalkeeper who is not moving risks a direct disqualification (\"red card\").\n\nOutside of own D-zone, the goalkeeper is treated as a current field player, and has to follow field players' rules; holding or tackling an opponent player outside the area risks a direct disqualification.{{clarify|date=August 2016}} The goalkeeper may not return to the area with the ball.\n\n====Team officials====\nEach team is allowed to have a maximum of four team officials seated on the benches. An official is anybody who is neither player nor substitute. One official must be the designated representative who is usually the [[Coach (sport)|team manager]]. Since 2012, representatives can call up to 3 team timeouts (up to twice per half), and may address the scorekeeper, timekeeper, and referees (before that, it was once per half); overtime and shootouts are considered extensions of the second half. Other officials typically include [[physician]]s or managers. Neither official is allowed to enter the playing court without the permission of the referees.\n\n===Ball===\n[[File:Handball the ball.jpg|thumb|A size III handball]] The ball is spherical and must be made either of leather or a synthetic material. It is not allowed to have a shiny or slippery surface. As the ball is intended to be operated by a single hand, its official sizes vary depending on age and gender of the participating teams.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"column\"| Size\n!scope=\"column\"| Class\n!scope=\"column\"| Circumference <br /> (cm)\n!scope=\"column\"| Circumference <br /> (in)\n!scope=\"column\"| Weight <br /> (g)\n!scope=\"column\"| Weight <br /> (oz)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| III\n| Male over-16s\n|{{convert|58|\u2013|60|cm|in|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|425|\u2013|475|g|oz|disp=table}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| II\n| Women, male over-12s, and female over-14s\n| {{convert|54|\u2013|56|cm|in|disp=table}}\n| {{convert|325|\u2013|375|g|oz|disp=table}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| I\n| Over-8s\n| {{convert|50|\u2013|52|cm|in|disp=table}}\n| {{convert|290|\u2013|330|g|oz|disp=table}}\n|}\n\n===Awarded throws===\nThe referees may award a special throw to a team. This usually happens after certain events such as scored goals, off-court balls, turnovers and timeouts. All of these special throws require the thrower to obtain a certain position, and pose restrictions on the positions of all other players. Sometimes the execution must wait for a whistle blow by the referee.\n\n;Throw-off: A throw-off takes place from the center of the court. The thrower must touch the middle line with one foot, and all the other offensive players must stay in their half until the referee restarts the game. The defending players must keep a distance of at least three meters from the thrower until the ball leaves his hand. A throw-off occurs at the beginning of each period and after the opposing team scores a goal. It must be cleared by the referees.\n\n:Modern handball introduced the \"fast throw-off\" concept; i.e., the play will be immediately restarted by the referees as soon as the executing team fulfills its requirements. Many teams leverage this rule to score easy goals before the opposition has time to form a stable defense line.\n\n;Throw-in: The team which did not touch the ball last is awarded a throw-in when the ball fully crosses the side line or touches the ceiling. If the ball crosses the outer goal line, a throw-in is awarded only if the defending field players touched the ball last. Execution requires the thrower to place one foot on the nearest outer line to the cause. All defending players must keep a distance of {{Convert|3|m|spell=in}}. However, they are allowed to stand immediately outside their own goal area even when the distance is less than three meters.\n\n;Goalkeeper-throw: If the ball crosses the outer goal line without interference from the defending team or when deflected by the defending team's goalkeeper, or when the attacking team violates the D-zone as described above, a goalkeeper-throw is awarded to the defending team. This is the most common turnover. The goalkeeper resumes the play with a throw from anywhere within the goal area.\n\n;Free-throw: A free-throw restarts the play after an interruption by the referees. It takes places from the spot where the interruption was caused, as long as this spot is outside of the free-throw line of the opposing team. In the latter case, the throw is deferred to the nearest spot on the free-throw line. Free-throws are the equivalent to [[Direct free kick|free-kicks]] in association football; however, conceding them is typically not seen as poor sportsmanship for the defending side, and in itself, they carry no major disadvantages. (In particular, being awarded a free throw while being on warning for passive play will not reset the warning, whereas a shot on goal will.)  The thrower may take a direct attempt for a goal which, however, is rarely feasible if the defending team has organised a defense. However, if a free throw is awarded and the half or game ends, a direct throw at the goal is typically attempted, which occasionally goes in.\n\n[[File:Kr-Oe-Siebenmeter.jpg|thumb|A seven-metre throw]]\n;Seven-meter throw: A seven-meter throw is awarded when a clear chance of scoring is illegally prevented anywhere on the court by an opposing team player, official, or spectator. It is awarded also when the referees have interrupted a legitimate scoring chance for any reason. The thrower steps with one foot behind the {{Convert|7|m|adj=on|spell=in}} line with only the defending goalkeeper between him and the goal. The goalkeeper must keep a distance of {{Convert|3|m|spell=in}}, which is marked by a short tick on the floor. All other players must remain behind the free-throw line until execution and the defending field players must keep a distance of three meters. The thrower must await the whistle blow of the referee. A seven-meter throw is the equivalent to a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] in association football; however, it is far more common and typically occurs several times in a single game.\n\n===Penalties===\n[[File:Yellow card handball.jpg|thumb|right|Yellow card shown in a handball match]]\nPenalties are given to players, in progressive format, for fouls that require more punishment than just a free-throw. Actions directed mainly at the opponent and not the ball (such as reaching around, holding, pushing, tripping, and jumping into opponent) as well as contact from the side, from behind a player or impeding the opponent's counterattack are all considered illegal and are subject to penalty. Any infraction that prevents a clear scoring opportunity will result in a seven-meter penalty shot.\n\nTypically the referee will give a warning yellow card for an illegal action; but, if the contact was particularly dangerous, like striking the opponent in the head, neck or throat, the referee can forego the warning for an immediate two-minute suspension. Players are warned once before given a yellow card; they risk being red-carded if they draw three yellows.\n\nA red card results in an ejection from the game and a two-minute penalty for the team. A player may receive a red card directly for particularly rough penalties. For instance, any contact from behind during a fast break is now being treated with a red card; as does any deliberate intent to injure opponents. A red-carded player has to leave the playing area completely. A player who is disqualified may be substituted with another player after the two-minute penalty is served. A coach or official can also be penalized progressively. Any coach or official who receives a two-minute suspension will have to pull out one of their players for two minutes; however, the player is not the one punished, and can be substituted in again, as the penalty consists of the team playing with one fewer player than the opposing team.\n\nAfter referees award the ball to the opponents for whatever reason, the player currently in possession of the ball has to lay it down quickly, or risk a two-minute suspension. Also, gesticulating or verbally questioning the referee's order, as well as arguing with the officials' decisions, will normally risk a yellow card. If the suspended player protests further, does not walk straight off the field to the bench, or if the referee deems the tempo deliberately slow, that player risks a double yellow card. Illegal substitution (outside of the dedicated area, or if the replacement player enters too early) is prohibited; if they do, they risk a yellow card.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Formations===\n[[File:5-1-Deckung.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Positions of attacking (red) and defending players (blue), in a 5-1 defense formation]]\n[[File:6-0-Deckung.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Positions of attacking (red) and defending players (blue), in a 6-0 defense formation]]\nPlayers are typically referred to by the positions they are playing. The positions are always denoted from the view of the respective goalkeeper, so that a defender on the right opposes an attacker on the left. However, not all of the following positions may be occupied depending on the formation or potential suspensions.\n\n====Offense====\n* Left and right wingman.These typically are fast players who excel at ball control and wide jumps from the outside of the goal perimeter in order to get into a better shooting angle at the goal. Teams usually try to occupy the left position with a right-handed player and vice versa.\n* Left and right backcourt. Goal attempts by these players are typically made by jumping high and shooting over the defenders. Thus, it is usually advantageous to have tall players with a powerful shot for these positions.\n* Centre backcourt. A player with experience is preferred on this position who acts as playmaker and the handball equivalent of a basketball [[point guard]].\n* Pivot (left and right, if applicable). This player tends to intermingle with the defence, setting picks and attempting to disrupt the defence's formation. This position requires the least jumping skills; but ball control and physical strength are an advantage.\n\nSometimes, the offense uses formations with two pivot players.\n\n====Defense====\nThere are many variations in defensive formations. Usually, they are described as ''n:m'' formations, where ''n'' is the number of players defending at the goal line and ''m'' the number of players defending more offensive. Exceptions are the 3:2:1 defense and n+m formation (e.g. 5+1), where m players defend some offensive player in man coverage (instead of the usual zone coverage).\n* Far left and far right. The opponents of the wingmen.\n* Half left and half right. The opponents of the left and right backcourts.\n* Back center (left and right). Opponent of the pivot.\n* Front center. Opponent of the center backcourt, may also be set against another specific backcourt player.\n\n===Offensive play===\nAttacks are played with all field players on the side of the defenders. Depending on the speed of the attack, one distinguishes between three attack ''waves'' with a decreasing chance of success:\n\n[[File:Mara Friton Handball.jpg|thumb|Women's handball - a jump shot completes a fast-break]]\n[[File:Kiril Lazarov 09.jpg|thumb|Men's handball - a jump shot ([[Kiril Lazarov]], world record-holder for the number of goals scored in one world championship) ]]\n;First wave: ''First wave'' attacks are characterised by the absence of defending players around their goal perimeter. The chance of success is very high, as the throwing player is unhindered in his scoring attempt. Such attacks typically occur after an intercepted pass or a steal, and if the defending team can switch fast to offence. The far left or far right will usually try to run the attack, as they are not as tightly bound in the defence. On a turnover, they immediately sprint forward and receive the ball halfway to the other goal. Thus, these positions are commonly held by quick players.\n;Second wave: If the first wave is not successful and some defending players have gained their positions around the zone, the second wave comes into play: the remaining players advance with quick passes to locally outnumber the retreating defenders. If one player manages to step up to the perimeter or catches the ball at this spot, he becomes unstoppable by legal defensive means. From this position, the chance of success is naturally very high. Second wave attacks became much more important with the \"fast throw-off\" rule.\n\n;Third wave: The time during which the second wave may be successful is very short, as then the defenders closed the gaps around the zone. In the ''third wave'', the attackers use standardised attack patterns usually involving crossing and passing between the back court players who either try to pass the ball through a gap to their pivot, take a jumping shot from the backcourt at the goal, or lure the defence away from a wingman.\n\nThe third wave evolves into the normal offensive play when all defenders not only reach the zone, but gain their accustomed positions. Some teams then substitute specialised offence players. However, this implies that these players must play in the defence should the opposing team be able to switch quickly to offence. The latter is another benefit for fast playing teams.\n\nIf the attacking team does not make sufficient progress (eventually releasing a shot on goal), the referees can call '''passive play''' (since about 1995, the referee gives a passive warning some time before the actual call by holding one hand up in the air, signalling that the attacking team should release a shot soon), turning control over to the other team. A shot on goal or an infringement leading to a yellow card or two-minute penalty will mark the start of a new attack, causing the hand to be taken down; but a shot blocked by the defense or a normal free throw will not. If it were not for this rule, it would be easy for an attacking team to stall the game indefinitely, as it is difficult to intercept a pass without at the same time conceding dangerous openings towards the goal.\n\n===Defensive play===\nThe usual formations of the defense are 6\u20130, when all the defense players line up between the {{Convert|6|m|adj=on}} and {{Convert|9|m|adj=on}} lines to form a wall; the 5\u20131, when one of the players cruises outside the {{Convert|9|m|adj=on}} perimeter, usually targeting the center forwards while the other 5 line up on the {{Convert|6|m|adj=on}} line; and the less common 4\u20132 when there are two such defenders out front. Very fast teams will also try a 3\u20133 formation which is close to a switching man-to-man style. The formations vary greatly from country to country, and reflect each country's style of play. 6\u20130 is sometimes known as \"flat defense\", and all other formations are usually called \"offensive defense\".\n\n==Organization==\nHandball teams are usually organised as [[sports club|clubs]]. On a national level, the clubs are associated in federations which organize matches in leagues and tournaments.\n\n===International body===\nThe [[International Handball Federation]] (IHF) is the administrative and controlling body for international handball.
