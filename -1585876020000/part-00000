Chaves]].\n\nHe amassed [[Primeira Liga]] totals of 205 matches and 25 goals during 13 seasons, representing in the competition [[C.F. Os Belenenses|Belenenses]], [[FC Porto|Porto]], [[Vit\u00f3ria S.C.|Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es]], [[S.C. Braga|Braga]], [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] and [[Gil Vicente F.C.|Gil Vicente]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Belenenses===\nAfter playing his first two professional seasons at lowly Clube Ca\u00e7adores das Taipas (based on [[Caldas das Taipas]] near [[Guimar\u00e3es]], where he was born), Peixoto's ability as a [[Midfielder#Winger|left winger]] allowed him to jump from the [[Portuguese Third Division|fourth division]] straight into the [[Primeira Liga]] with [[C.F. Os Belenenses]], thanks to former player Jo\u00e3o Cardoso.\n\nHe would score seven goals in [[2001\u201302 Primeira Liga|his debut season]], one of them a long range shot closing a 3\u20130 win against [[FC Porto]] at the ''[[Est\u00e1dio do Restelo]]''.

Finn, Rey, and BB-8 escape Jakku in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', and are soon intercepted by the ship's former owner, [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]]), and his co-pilot [[Chewbacca]] ([[Peter Mayhew]]).\n\nIt is revealed that Ren is the son of Han and Leia, originally named Ben,<ref>{{cite web|last=Dennis|first=Catrina|title=Legacy of My Mother: 5 Women Who Changed the ''Star Wars'' Galaxy|date=May 6, 2016|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/legacy-of-my-mother-5-women-who-changed-the-star-wars-galaxy|website=StarWars.com|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref> and was once one of Luke's [[Jedi]] pupils. He was corrupted to the [[dark side (Star Wars)|dark side]] of [[Force (Star Wars)|the Force]] by the First Order's [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] ([[Andy Serkis]]), and helped destroy Luke's new Jedi Academy. However, Ren still feels the pull of the light side of the Force and seeks the strength to overcome it from his grandfather [[Darth Vader]], whose burnt helmet is in Ren's possession. Arriving at [[Maz Kanata]]'s ([[Lupita Nyong'o]]) castle on [[Takodana]], Ren captures Rey, who he senses has seen the map. While interrogating her, he realizes that she is strong with the Force, though unaware of it. Rey finds herself able to resist his powers and experience Ren's emotions, and confronts him over his fear that he will never be as powerful as his grandfather. She later uses the \"[[Jedi mind trick]]\" to compel her stormtrooper guard to let her escape. Han arrives at the First Order's superweapon, [[Starkiller Base]], as part of the Resistance's plan to destroy it.\n\nAfter Han plants explosives to destroy the base, he confronts Ren\u2014calling him by his real name, Ben\u2014and implores him to abandon the dark side, warning him that Snoke will kill him once he has control of the galaxy. Ren tells Han he feels conflicted, and asks his father for help, which Han promises to give; Ren then ignites his lightsaber, impaling and killing Han. An enraged Chewbacca fires at Ren, wounding him. As Finn and Rey flee the damaged base, Ren follows and confronts them. Finn fights Ren with [[Anakin Skywalker]]'s recovered lightsaber, but Ren overpowers and severely wounds him. Rey then takes up the lightsaber and, using the Force, begins to overcome Ren, striking him on the face with the lightsaber. Before the duel is finished, they are separated by a seismic fissure created by the collapsing base. Rey and the others escape as Snoke orders [[General Hux]] ([[Domnhall Gleeson]]) to evacuate the base and bring Ren to him to complete his training.\n\n====''The Last Jedi'' (2017)====\n{{main|Star Wars: The Last Jedi}}\nRen's inner conflict continues into ''The Last Jedi'', particularly through his conversations with Rey, with whom he connects through the Force. Rey learns from Luke why Ben Solo turned to the dark side: Luke had seen a vision of the destruction Ben would cause and was briefly tempted to kill him in his sleep; when Ben awoke to see Luke with his lightsaber drawn, he turned on his uncle and destroyed the Jedi Temple. Rey believes that there is still good in Ren, and resolves to bring him back to the light side.\n\nMeanwhile, Ren is reproached by Snoke for his failure to defeat Rey, and Ren tries to prove himself by leading an attack on a lead Resistance starship. He hesitates to destroy it after sensing his mother's presence, but his wingmen destroy the ship's bridge, almost killing Leia. Upon Rey's arrival, Ren captures her and brings her to Snoke, who tortures her for Luke's location before ordering Ren to kill her. Instead of complying, Ren uses the Force to ignite Luke's lightsaber at Snoke's side and cut him in half, and subsequently slays Snoke's royal guard with Rey's assistance. After the guards are slain, Ren reveals to Rey his goal to create a new order in the galaxy, separate from the legacies created by Snoke and Luke, and beseeches Rey to join him. He forces her to acknowledge that her parents abandoned her, and tells her that he is the only one who truly cares about her. Rey refuses to join him, realizing that Ren will not turn back to the light side; the two briefly struggle over Anakin's lightsaber with the Force, resulting in the weapon breaking in half and knocking both warriors unconscious.\n\nAfter Rey escapes, Ren frames her for Snoke's assassination, uses the Force to choke Hux until he acknowledging Ren as the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, and orders his forces to attack the Resistance base on Crait. When Luke appears during the attack, Ren orders his men to fire on him, to no effect; Luke remains standing, revealing that he is only present as a Force projection, serving as a distraction to allow the Resistance to escape from the First Order. After Luke vanishes, the First Order storms the base, but the Resistance has already evacuated. Ren shares a final look with Rey through the Force before Rey slams the door to the ''Millennium Falcon'' and escapes with the Resistance.\n\n====''The Rise of Skywalker'' (2019)====\n{{main|Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker}}\nIn ''The Rise of Skywalker'', Ren has been ruling as the Supreme Leader of the First Order for a year. In the film's beginning, Ren searches for a Sith wayfinder to lead him to the Sith planet [[Exegol]], with the hopes of killing the resurrected [[Emperor Palpatine]] ([[Ian McDiarmid]]) as a show of his power. When Ren finds the wayfinder and arrives on Exegol, Palpatine reveals that he has been manipulating Ren and the First Order, having created Snoke as a means of turning Ren to the dark side. Palpatine unveils the Final Order, a massive armada of planet-killing Star Destroyers. Palpatine offers the armada to Ren in a bid to form a new Empire\u2014with Ren as Emperor\u2014on the condition that he kill Rey.\n\nRen searches the galaxy for Rey and continues corresponding with her through the Force to discern her location. Rey has been searching for a second wayfinder; Ren tries to stop her from finding it. Eventually, Ren informs Rey that she is Palpatine's granddaughter, and furthermore, they are a dyad in the Force with extremely powerful potential when joined together. He urges her once more to take his hand, and to overthrow Palpatine together. Rey refuses, but Ren is unwilling to kill her and follows her to [[Kef Bir]], the location of the second wayfinder. Meeting her on the wreckage of the [[second Death Star]], Ren destroys Rey's wayfinder and duels her. The duel ends with Rey impaling Ren, who had been distracted by his dying mother, Leia, reaching out to him through the Force. A guilt-ridden Rey uses the Force to heal Ren and leaves aboard his ship, after telling him that she wanted to take Ben Solo's hand, but not Kylo Ren's. Alone on the wreckage, Ren converses with a memory of his father, Han Solo; he throws away his lightsaber, renouncing his role as Supreme Leader and reclaiming his old identity of Ben Solo.\n\nBen rushes to help Rey defeat Palpatine on Exegol. Rey senses his presence and uses their Force connection to give him Anakin's lightsaber, which Ben uses to defeat the Knights of Ren. Palpatine then senses Rey and Ben's connection as a dyad of the Force, and absorbs their energy to restore his full power, before casting Ben into an abyss. However, Rey manages to defeat and kill Palpatine before dying from the effort. Ben climbs out of the abyss and finds Rey's inert body. Ben manages to transfer all of his life essence into her, successfully resuscitating her but sacrificing his own life in the process. They share a passionate kiss before Ben dies peacefully in Rey's arms. His body fades away simultaneously with his mother's, becoming one with the Force.\n\n===Related works and promotional material===\nKylo is a playable character in the 2015 ''The Force Awakens'' add-on to the ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]'' video game, with an ''Infinity'' character figurine available separately.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyrobertson/2015/10/12/the-force-awakens-kylo-ren-poe-dameron/ |title=''Disney Infinity: The Force Awakens'' Dated, Adds Kylo Ren And Poe Dameron |work=Forbes |first=Andy |last=Robertson |date=October 12, 2015 |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/12/09/disney-infinitys-star-wars-the-force-awakens-lets-john-boyega-play-with-himself/ |title=Disney Infinity's ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' lets John Boyega play with himself |publisher=[[VentureBeat]] |first=Giancarlo |last=Valdes |date=December 9, 2015 |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-force-awakens-play-set-for-disney-infinity-3-0-edition-now-available |title=''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' Play Set for ''Disney Infinity 3.0'' Edition Now Available |publisher=StarWars.com |date=December 18, 2015 |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/gaming/2015/12/16/disney-infinity-star-wars-the-force-awakens-game/77412314/ |title=''Infinity'' adds to ''Force Awakens'' experience |work=[[USA Today]] |first=Brian |last=Truitt |date=December 16, 2015 |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref> He is also a character in the [[strategy video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Force Arena]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Compendio|first1=Chris|title=Kylo Ren and Rey Finally Join Mobile Game ''Star Wars: Force Arena''|url=https://screenrant.com/kylo-ren-rey-star-wars-force-arena/|publisher=Screen Rant|date=November 9, 2017|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Hasbro]] has released a {{convert|3+3/4|in|cm|adj=on}} Kylo Ren action figure,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blastr.com/2015-8-14/leaked-peek-hasbros-kylo-ren-captain-phasma-and-10-more-force-awakens-action-figures |title=Leaked peek at Hasbro's Kylo Ren, Captain Phasma and 10 more ''The Force Awakens'' action figures |publisher=[[Blastr]] |first=Jeff |last=Spry |date=August 14, 2015 |accessdate=January 3, 2016}}</ref> and a {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} figure in their Black Series line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rebelscum.com/03-Kylo-Ren-The-Black-Series-Star-Wars-Hasbro-2015.asp |title=03 Kylo Ren from Hasbro's The Black Series |publisher=Rebelscum.com |first=D.

After arriving at [[Jakku]] to retrieve a map containing the coordinates where [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Mark Hamill]]) is to be found, Ren kills an old priest named Lor San Tekka ([[Max von Sydow]]), and captures Resistance pilot [[Poe Dameron]] ([[Oscar Isaac]]), who has also been sent to recover the map by General [[Princess Leia|Princess Leia Organa]] ([[Carrie Fisher]]). Ren soon learns that the pilot had entrusted his [[astromech droid]], [[BB-8]], with the map. Poe flees with the help of rogue stormtrooper [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]] ([[John Boyega]]), who later finds BB-8, and the scavenger [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] ([[Daisy Ridley]]). Finn, Rey, and BB-8 escape Jakku in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', and are soon intercepted by the ship's former owner, [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]]), and his co-pilot [[Chewbacca]] ([[Peter Mayhew]]).\n\nIt is revealed that Ren is the son of Han and Leia, originally named Ben,<ref>{{cite web|last=Dennis|first=Catrina|title=Legacy of My Mother: 5 Women Who Changed the ''Star Wars'' Galaxy|date=May 6, 2016|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/legacy-of-my-mother-5-women-who-changed-the-star-wars-galaxy|website=StarWars.com|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref> and was once one of Luke's [[Jedi]] pupils. He was corrupted to the [[dark side (Star Wars)|dark side]] of [[Force (Star Wars)|the Force]] by the First Order's [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] ([[Andy Serkis]]), and helped destroy Luke's new Jedi Academy. However, Ren still feels the pull of the light side of the Force and seeks the strength to overcome it from his grandfather [[Darth Vader]], whose burnt helmet is in Ren's possession. Arriving at [[Maz Kanata]]'s ([[Lupita Nyong'o]]) castle on [[Takodana]], Ren captures Rey, who he senses has seen the map. While interrogating her, he realizes that she is strong with the Force, though unaware of it. Rey finds herself able to resist his powers and experience Ren's emotions, and confronts him over his fear that he will never be as powerful as his grandfather. She later uses the \"[[Jedi mind trick]]\" to compel her stormtrooper guard to let her escape. Han arrives at the First Order's superweapon, [[Starkiller Base]], as part of the Resistance's plan to destroy it.\n\nAfter Han plants explosives to destroy the base, he confronts Ren\u2014calling him by his real name, Ben\u2014and implores him to abandon the dark side, warning him that Snoke will kill him once he has control of the galaxy. Ren tells Han he feels conflicted, and asks his father for help, which Han promises to give; Ren then ignites his lightsaber, impaling and killing Han. An enraged Chewbacca fires at Ren, wounding him. As Finn and Rey flee the damaged base, Ren follows and confronts them. Finn fights Ren with [[Anakin Skywalker]]'s recovered lightsaber, but Ren overpowers and severely wounds him. Rey then takes up the lightsaber and, using the Force, begins to overcome Ren, striking him on the face with the lightsaber. Before the duel is finished, they are separated by a seismic fissure created by the collapsing base. Rey and the others escape as Snoke orders [[General Hux]] ([[Domnhall Gleeson]]) to evacuate the base and bring Ren to him to complete his training.\n\n====''The Last Jedi'' (2017)====\n{{main|Star Wars: The Last Jedi}}\nRen's inner conflict continues into ''The Last Jedi'', particularly through his conversations with Rey, with whom he connects through the Force. Rey learns from Luke why Ben Solo turned to the dark side: Luke had seen a vision of the destruction Ben would cause and was briefly tempted to kill him in his sleep; when Ben awoke to see Luke with his lightsaber drawn, he turned on his uncle and destroyed the Jedi Temple. Rey believes that there is still good in Ren, and resolves to bring him back to the light side.\n\nMeanwhile, Ren is reproached by Snoke for his failure to defeat Rey, and Ren tries to prove himself by leading an attack on a lead Resistance starship. He hesitates to destroy it after sensing his mother's presence, but his wingmen destroy the ship's bridge, almost killing Leia. Upon Rey's arrival, Ren captures her and brings her to Snoke, who tortures her for Luke's location before ordering Ren to kill her. Instead of complying, Ren uses the Force to ignite Luke's lightsaber at Snoke's side and cut him in half, and subsequently slays Snoke's royal guard with Rey's assistance. After the guards are slain, Ren reveals to Rey his goal to create a new order in the galaxy, separate from the legacies created by Snoke and Luke, and beseeches Rey to join him. He forces her to acknowledge that her parents abandoned her, and tells her that he is the only one who truly cares about her. Rey refuses to join him, realizing that Ren will not turn back to the light side; the two briefly struggle over Anakin's lightsaber with the Force, resulting in the weapon breaking in half and knocking both warriors unconscious.\n\nAfter Rey escapes, Ren frames her for Snoke's assassination, uses the Force to choke Hux until he acknowledging Ren as the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, and orders his forces to attack the Resistance base on Crait. When Luke appears during the attack, Ren orders his men to fire on him, to no effect; Luke remains standing, revealing that he is only present as a Force projection, serving as a distraction to allow the Resistance to escape from the First Order. After Luke vanishes, the First Order storms the base, but the Resistance has already evacuated. Ren shares a final look with Rey through the Force before Rey slams the door to the ''Millennium Falcon'' and escapes with the Resistance.\n\n====''The Rise of Skywalker'' (2019)====\n{{main|Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker}}\nIn ''The Rise of Skywalker'', Ren has been ruling as the Supreme Leader of the First Order for a year. In the film's beginning, Ren searches for a Sith wayfinder to lead him to the Sith planet [[Exegol]], with the hopes of killing the resurrected [[Emperor Palpatine]] ([[Ian McDiarmid]]) as a show of his power. When Ren finds the wayfinder and arrives on Exegol, Palpatine reveals that he has been manipulating Ren and the First Order, having created Snoke as a means of turning Ren to the dark side. Palpatine unveils the Final Order, a massive armada of planet-killing Star Destroyers. Palpatine offers the armada to Ren in a bid to form a new Empire\u2014with Ren as Emperor\u2014on the condition that he kill Rey.\n\nRen searches the galaxy for Rey and continues corresponding with her through the Force to discern her location. Rey has been searching for a second wayfinder; Ren tries to stop her from finding it. Eventually, Ren informs Rey that she is Palpatine's granddaughter, and furthermore, they are a dyad in the Force with extremely powerful potential when joined together. He urges her once more to take his hand, and to overthrow Palpatine together. Rey refuses, but Ren is unwilling to kill her and follows her to [[Kef Bir]], the location of the second wayfinder. Meeting her on the wreckage of the [[second Death Star]], Ren destroys Rey's wayfinder and duels her. The duel ends with Rey impaling Ren, who had been distracted by his dying mother, Leia, reaching out to him through the Force. A guilt-ridden Rey uses the Force to heal Ren and leaves aboard his ship, after telling him that she wanted to take Ben Solo's hand, but not Kylo Ren's. Alone on the wreckage, Ren converses with a memory of his father, Han Solo; he throws away his lightsaber, renouncing his role as Supreme Leader and reclaiming his old identity of Ben Solo.\n\nBen rushes to help Rey defeat Palpatine on Exegol. Rey senses his presence and uses their Force connection to give him Anakin's lightsaber, which Ben uses to defeat the Knights of Ren. Palpatine then senses Rey and Ben's connection as a dyad of the Force, and absorbs their energy to restore his full power, before casting Ben into an abyss. However, Rey manages to defeat and kill Palpatine before dying from the effort. Ben climbs out of the abyss and finds Rey's inert body.
