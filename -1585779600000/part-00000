Early Christians regarded themselves as partaking in a new covenant with God, open to both Jews and gentiles, due to the sacrificial death and subsequent exaltation of Jesus Christ.\n\nEarly Christian notions of the person and sacrificial role of Jesus in human salvation were further elaborated by the Church Fathers, medieval writers and modern scholars in various atonement theories, such as the [[Ransom theory of atonement|ransom theory]], [[Christus Victor|Christus Victor theory]], the [[Recapitulation theory of atonement|recapitulation theory]], the [[Satisfaction theory of atonement|satisfaction theory]], the [[Penal substitution|penal substitution theory]], and the [[Moral influence theory of atonement|moral influence theory]].\n\nVariant views on [[salvation]] are among the main fault lines dividing the various [[Christian denominations]], including conflicting definitions of sin and [[Total depravity|depravity]] (the sinful nature of humankind), [[Justification (theology)|justification]] (God's means of removing the consequences of sin), and [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] (the [[Forgiveness#Christianity|forgiving]] or pardoning of sin through the suffering, death and [[resurrection of Jesus]]).\n\n==Definition and scope==\nSalvation in Christianity, or deliverance or redemption, is the \"saving [of] human beings from death and separation from God\" by [[Christ]]'s death and resurrection.<ref name=CDOS /><!-- **START OF NOTES** -->{{efn|name=\"definition\"|Definition of salvation in Christianity:[[OED|Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd ed. 1989: \"The saving of the soul; the deliverance from sin and its consequences\"}}{{efn|\"Traditional Christianity maintains that human beings are subject to death and eternal separation from God as a result of their sinfulness, but that they can be saved from this condition somehow as a result of what we might refer to as \u201cthe work of Jesus\u201d, which work includes at least his suffering and death on the cross, and perhaps also his sinless life, resurrection, and ascension. We have used the term \u2018theories of the atonement\u2019 here because that is the term most commonly used in the philosophical literature on this topic, and it is a term often enough used in theology as well. But it is not a neutral term. Rather, it already embodies a partial theory about what human salvation involves and about what the work of Christ accomplishes. In particular, it presupposes that saving human beings from death and separation from God primarily involves atoning for sin rather than (say) delivering human beings from some kind of bondage, repairing human nature, or something else. In the New Testament we find various terms and phrases (in addition to \u2018salvation\u2019) used to characterize or describe what the work of Jesus accomplished on behalf of humanity\u2014e.g., justification, redemption or ransom, reconciliation, deliverance from sin, re-creation or rebirth, the offering of an atoning sacrifice, abundant life, and eternal life. Obviously these terms are not all synonymous; so part of the task of an overall theology of salvation\u2014a soteriology\u2014is to sort out the relations among these various terms and phrases (is salvation simply to be identified with eternal life, for example?), to determine which are to be taken literally and which are mere metaphors, and to explain which effects have been brought about by Jesus' life, which by his death, which by his resurrection, and so on.  In light of all this, some theologians and philosophers deliberately avoid talking about \u2018theories of the atonement\u2019 and talk instead about (e.g.) \u2018the theology of reconciliation\u2019 or theories about \u2018the redemption\u2019, etc.\"{{harvnb|Murray|Rea|2012}} }}{{efn|\"At the heart of Christian faith is the reality and hope of salvation in Jesus Christ.

As a process of transformation, ''theosis'' is brought about by the effects of ''[[catharsis]]'' (purification of mind and body) and ''[[Theoria#Eastern Orthodox Catholic and Eastern Catholic Churches|theoria]]'' ('illumination' with the 'vision' of God). According to [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] teaching, ''theosis'' is very much the purpose of human life. It is considered achievable only through a synergy (or cooperation) between human activity and God's uncreated energies (or operations).{{sfn|Bartos|1999|p=253}}{{sfn|Kapsanis|2006}} The synonymous term ''[[Divinization (Christian)|divinization]]'' is the transforming effect of [[divine grace]],{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005c|p=700|loc=grace}} the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|spirit]] of [[God in Christianity|God]], or the atonement of [[Christ]]. ''Theosis'' and ''divinization'' are to be distinguished from [[sanctification]], \"being made holy,\" which can also apply to objects;{{sfn|Abraham|2019|p=224}} and from ''[[apotheosis]]'', also \"divinization,\" lit. \"making divine\").\n\nCatholics believe faith as is active in charity and good works (''fides caritate formata'') can justify man.

Over the centuries, Christians have held different ideas about how Jesus saved people, and different views still exist within different [[Christian denominations]]. According to C. Marvin Pate, \"there are three aspects to Christ's atonement according to the early Church: [[vicarious atonement]] [substitutionary atonement],{{efn|In Christianity, vicarious atonement, also called substitutionary atonement, is the idea that Jesus died \"for us.\"{{sfn|Flood|2012|p=53}}}} the eschatological defeat of Satan [Christ the Victor], and the imitation of Christ [participation in Jesus' death and resurrection].\"{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250-254}} Pate further notes that these three aspects were intertwined in the earliest Christian writings, but that this intertwining was lost since the Patristic times.{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=261}} Due to the influence of [[Gustaf Aulen|Gustaf Aul\u00e9n]]'s (1879\u20131978) ''Christus Victor'', the various theories or paradigms of atonement which developed after the New Testamentical writings are often grouped as \"classic paradigm,\" \"objective paradigm,\" and the \"subjective paradigm\":{{sfn|Weaver|2001|p=2}}{{sfn|Beilby|Eddy|2009|p=11-20}}{{sfn|Aul\u00e9n|1931|p=}}{{efn|[[Karl Barth]] notes a range of alternative themes: ''forensic'' (we are guilty of a crime, and Christ takes the punishment), ''financial'' (we are indebted to God, and Christ pays our debt) and ''cultic'' (Christ makes a sacrifice on our behalf). For various cultural reasons, the oldest themes (honor and sacrifice) prove to have more depth than the more modern ones (payment of a debt, punishment for a crime). But in all these alternatives, the understanding of atonement has the same structure. Human beings owe something to God that we cannot pay. Christ pays it on our behalf. Thus God remains both perfectly just (insisting on a penalty) and perfectly loving (paying the penalty himself). A great many Christians would define such a substitutionary view of the atonement as simply part of what orthodox Christians believe.{{sfn|Placher|2009|}} }}\n\n===Judaism===\nIn the Hebrew writings, God is absolute righteousness, and only pure and sinless persons can approach him.{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}} Reconciliation is achieved by an act of God, namely by his appointment of the sacrificial system,{{efn|name=\"sacrifice\"}} or, in the Prophetic view, \"by the future Divine gift of a new covenant to replace the old covenant which sinful Israel has broken.\"{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}} The Jewish scriptures describe three types of vicarious atonement which result in pureness or sinlesssness: the [[Korban Pesach|Paschal Lamb]];{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}} \"the [[Korban|sacrificial system]] as a whole,\" with the [[Day of Atonement]] as the most essential element;{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}}{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}} and the idea of the [[suffering servant]] (Isaiah 42:1\u20139, 49:1\u20136, 50:4\u201311, 52:13\u201353:12),{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}}<ref group=web name=\"Gandi\">Herald Gandi (2018), [https://www.tms.edu/blog/resurrection-according-to-scriptures/ ''The Resurrection: \u201cAccording to the Scriptures\u201d?'']</ref> \"the action of a Divinely sent [[Servant of the Lord]] who was 'wounded for our transgressions' and 'bare the sin of many'.\"{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}} The [[Old Testament Apocrypha]] adds a fourth idea, namely the righteous martyr (2 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees, Wisdom 2\u20135).{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}}{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}}\n\nThese traditions of atonement offer only temporary forgiveness,{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}} and ''korbanot'' (offerings) could only be used as a means of atoning for the lightest type of sin, that is sins committed in ignorance that the thing was a sin.<ref name=\"jewfaq.org1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/qorbanot.htm|title=Judaism 101: Qorbanot: Sacrifices and Offerings|website=www.jewfaq.org}}</ref>{{efn|name=\"grades of sin\"|Sins in [[Judaism]] consist of different grades of severity:<ref group=web name=\"JE.SIN\"/>\n* The lightest is the ''\u1e25e\u1e6d'', ''\u1e25a\u1e6d\u1e6da'ah'', or ''\u1e25a\u1e6d\u1e6dat''  (lit. \"fault,\" \"shortcoming,\" \"misstep\"), an infraction of a commandment committed in ignorance of the existence or meaning of that command.\n* The second kind is the ''awon'', a breach of a minor commandment committed with a full knowledge of the existence and nature of that commandment (''bemezid''). \n* The gravest kind is the ''pesha'' or ''mered'', a presumptuous and rebellious act against God.

It entails the idea that God deceived the devil,{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5}} and that Satan, or death, had \"legitimate rights\"{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5}} over sinful [[soul]]s in the [[afterlife]], due to the fall of man and [[Original sin|inherited sin]]. During the first millennium CE, the ransom theory of atonement was the dominant metaphor for atonement, both in eastern and western Christianity, until it was replaced in the west by Anselmus' satisfaction theory of atonement.{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|p=114}}\n\nIn one version of the idea of deception, Satan attempted to take Jesus' soul after he had died, but in doing so over-extended his authority, as Jesus had never sinned. As a consequence, Satan lost his authority completely, and all humanity gained freedom. In another version, God entered into a deal with Satan, offering to trade Jesus' soul in exchange for the souls of all people, but after the trade, God [[Resurrection of Jesus|raised Jesus from the dead]] and left Satan with nothing. Other versions held that Jesus' [[divinity]] was masked by his human form, so Satan tried to take Jesus\u2019 soul without realizing that his divinity would destroy Satan's power. Another idea is that Jesus came to teach how not to sin and Satan, in anger with this, tried to take his soul.\n\nThe ransom theory was first clearly enunciated by [[Irenaeus]] (c.130\u2013c.202),{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|p=xliv,114}} who was an outspoken critic of [[Gnosticism]], but borrowed ideas from their dualistic worldview.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}} In this worldview, humankind is under the power of the [[Demiurge|Demiurg]], a lesser God who has created the world. Yet, humans have a spark of the true divine nature within them, which can be liberated by [[gnosis]] (knowledge) of this divine spark. This knowledge is revealed by the [[Logos]], \"the very mind of the supreme God,\" who entered the world in the person of Jesus. Nevertheless, the Logos could not simply undo the power of the Demiurg, and had to hide his real identity, appearing as a physical form, thereby misleading the Demiurg, and liberating humankind.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}} In Irenaeus' writings, the Demiurge is replaced by the devil, while Justin Martyr had already eqauted Jesus and the Logos.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}}\n\n[[Origen]] (184\u2013253) introduced the idea that the devil held legitimate rights over humans, who were bought free by the blood of Christ.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5-6}} He also introduced the notion that the devil was deceived in thinking that he could master the human soul.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=6}}\n\n[[Gustaf Aul\u00e9n]] reinterpreted the ransom theory in his study ''[[Christus Victor]]'' (1931),{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=8}} calling it the [[Christus Victor]] doctrine, arguing that Christ's death was not a payment to the Devil, but defeated the powers of evil, particularly [[Satan]], which had held humankind in their dominion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> According to Pugh, \"Ever since [Aul\u00e9n's] time, we call these patristic ideas the ''Christus Victor'' way of seeing the cross.\"{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=1}}\n\n====Recapitulation theory====\n{{Main|Recapitulation theory of atonement}}\n\nThe recapitulation view, first comprehensively expressed by [[Irenaeus]],{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|p=114-118}} went \"hand-in-hand\" with the ransom theory.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=1}} It says that Christ succeeds where [[Adam]] [[fall of man|failed]],{{sfn|Bethune-Baker|1903|p=334|ps=: Just as mankind in Adam lost its birthright, so in Christ mankind recovers its original condition}} undoing the wrong that Adam did and, because of his union with humanity, leads humanity on to [[immortality|eternal life]], including [[christian ethics|moral perfection]].{{sfn|Franks|n.d.|pp=37-38}} [[Divinization (Christian)|Theosis]] (\"divinisation\") is a \"corollary\" of the recapitulation.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=31}}\n\n===Objective paradigm===\n\n====Satisfaction====\n{{Main|Satisfaction theory of atonement}}\n\nIn the 11th century, [[Anselm of Canterbury]] rejected the ransom view and proposed the [[satisfaction theory of atonement]].

In this view, people needed salvation from the [[divine retribution|divine punishment]] that these offences would bring, since nothing they could do could repay the honor debt. Anselm held that Christ had infinitely honored God through his life and death and that Christ could repay what humanity owed God, thus satisfying the offence to God's honor and doing away with the need for punishment.

In the legal system, offences required punishment, and no satisfaction could be given to avert this need. They proposed a theory known as [[penal substitution]], in which Christ takes the penalty of people's sin as their substitute, thus saving people from [[Divine retribution|God's wrath]] against sin. Penal substitution thus presents Jesus saving people from the divine punishment of their past wrongdoings. However, this salvation is not presented as automatic. Rather, a person must have [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] in order to receive this free gift of salvation. In the penal substitution view, salvation is not dependent upon human effort or deeds.{{sfn|Pugh|2015}}\n\nThe penal substitution paradigm of salvation is widely held among Protestants, who often consider it central to Christianity.

Yet, the real story is not that the world rejected Him; the real story is that He was willing to let the world reject Him. Divine self-emptying, divine servanthood, and divine crucifixion are powerful themes that shock the philosophy of religion. Nietzsche called the greatest of all sins to be the murder of God (deicide). There was nothing more sinful than that. On the reverse, the greatest of all righteousness fulfilled was in the self-giving of the Son of God. This self-giving brought an end to the history of hostility between man and God. It cancelled all debts. Man had committed the greatest of all crimes, and God had allowed it to be done to Him in the ultimate divine sacrifice. The Cross was where Justice and Love met vis-\u00e0-vis. It was where man affirmed his estrangement and God affirmed His belongedness. It was where God accepted man as he was. The one act of righteousness by the Son of God nullified forever the writ of accusation against all humanity.\"<ref name=\"Marbaniang\"/>}}\n\n====Shared atonement theory====\nIn the \"shared atonement\" theory the atonement is spoken of as shared by all.

This restores the relation with God, who is loving and reaches out to humanity, and offers the possibility of ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'' c.q. [[Divinization (Christian)|divinization]], becoming the kind of humans God wants us to be.\n\nIn [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholicism]] salvation is seen as participation in the renewal of human nature itself by way of the eternal [[Logos (Christianity)|Word of God]] assuming the human nature in its fullness. In contrast to [[Western Christianity|Western branches]] of theology, Orthodox Christians tend to use the word \"expiation\" with regard to what is accomplished in the sacrificial act. In [[Orthodox theology]], expiation is an act of offering that seeks to change the one making the offering. The [[Koine Greek|Biblical Greek]] word which is translated both as \"[[propitiation]]\" and as \"expiation\" is ''hilasmos'', which means \"to make acceptable and enable one to draw close to God\".  Thus the Orthodox emphasis would be that Christ died, not to appease an angry and vindictive Father or to avert the [[Divine retribution|wrath of God]] upon sinners, but to defeat and secure the destruction of sin and death, so that those who are [[ancestral sin|fallen]] and in spiritual bondage may become divinely [[Transfiguration (religion)|transfigured]], and therefore fully human, as their Creator intended; that is to say, human creatures become God in his [[Essence-Energies distinction (Eastern Orthodox theology)|energies or operations but not in his essence or identity]], conforming to the image of Christ and reacquiring the divine likeness (see ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'').<ref>Fr.

Broadly speaking, [[Protestants]] hold to the [[Five solae|five ''solae'']] of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], which declare that salvation is attained by ''[[grace alone]]'' in ''[[Christ alone]]'' through ''[[faith alone]]'' for the ''[[Soli Deo gloria|Glory of God alone]]'' as told in ''[[Scripture alone]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nMost Protestants believe that salvation is achieved through God's grace alone, and once salvation is secured in the person, good works will be a result of this, allowing good works to often operate as a signifier for salvation. Some Protestants, such as [[Lutherans]] and the [[Reformed]], understand this to mean that God saves solely by grace, and that works follow as a necessary consequence of saving grace. Others, such as [[Methodists]] (and other Arminians), believe that salvation is by faith alone, but that salvation can be forfeited if it is not accompanied by continued faith, and the works that naturally follow from it.

In Lutheranism, it is a message relevant to people of all races and social levels, of all times and places, for \"the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men\" (Romans 5:18).

All of the elect necessarily [[perseverance of the saints|persevere in faith]] because God keeps them from falling away. Calvinists understand the doctrines of salvation to include the [[Calvinism#Five points of Calvinism|five points of Calvinism]], typically arranged in English to form the [[acrostic]] \"TULIP\".<ref>The TULIP acrostic first appeared in Loraine Boettner's ''The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination.'' The names appearing in parentheses, while not forming an acrostic, are offered by Theologian Roger Nicole in Steele's book cited herein, ''The Five Points of Calvinism: Defined.''</ref>\n\n* \"[[Total depravity]]\", also called \"total inability\", asserts that as a consequence of the [[Fall of Man|fall of man into sin]], every person born into the world is enslaved to the service of [[sin]]. People are not by nature inclined to love God with their whole heart, mind, or strength, but rather all are inclined to serve their own interests over those of their neighbor and to reject the rule of God. Thus, all people by their own faculties are morally unable to choose to follow God and be saved because they are unwilling to do so out of the necessity of their own natures. (The term \"total\" in this context refers to sin affecting every part of a person, not that every person is as evil as possible.)<ref>David Steele and Curtis Thomas, \"The Five Points of Calvinism Defined, Defended, Documented,\" pg.25, \"The adjective 'total' does not mean that each sinner is as totally or completely corrupt in his actions and thoughts as it is possible for him to be. Instead, the word 'total' is used to indicate that the \"whole\" of man's being has been affected by sin.\"</ref> This doctrine is derived from [[Augustine]]'s explanation of [[Original Sin]].\n* \"[[Unconditional election]]\" asserts that God has chosen from [[eternity]] those whom he will bring to himself not based on foreseen virtue, merit, or faith in those people; rather, it is unconditionally grounded in God's mercy alone. God has chosen from [[eternity]] to extend mercy to those he has chosen and to withhold mercy from those not chosen. Those chosen receive salvation through Christ alone.

This implies that only the sins of [[the elect]] were [[penal substitution|atoned]] for by Jesus's death. Calvinists do not believe, however, that the atonement is limited in its value or power, but rather that the atonement is limited in the sense that it is designed for some and not all. Hence, Calvinists hold that the atonement is sufficient for all and efficient for the elect.<ref>[http://www.calvinistcorner.com/tulip.htm The Five Points of Calvinism]. The Calvinist Corner.

This means that when God sovereignly purposes to save someone, that individual certainly will be saved. The doctrine holds that this purposeful influence of God's [[Holy Spirit]] cannot be resisted, but that the Holy Spirit, \"graciously causes the elect sinner to cooperate, to believe, to repent, to come freely and willingly to Christ.\"<ref>[http://www.the-highway.com/compare.html Comparison of Calvinism and Arminianism].

Those who apparently fall away either never had true faith to begin with or will return. The word \"saints\" is used to refer to all who are set apart by God, and not only those who are exceptionally [[holy]], [[Canonization|canonized]], or in [[heaven]]).<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/boettner/predest.iv.vi.html |chapter=The Perseverance of the Saints |title=The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination |author=[[Loraine Boettner]] |accessdate=2009-03-25}}</ref>\n\n===Arminianism===\n{{Main|Arminianism}}\nArminianism is a school of soteriological thought within Protestant Christianity, held by Christian denominations such as the [[Methodist Church]]. It is based on the theological ideas of the Dutch Reformed theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]] (1560\u20131609). Like Calvinists, [[Arminians]] agree that all people are born sinful and are in need of salvation. Classical Arminians emphasize that God's free grace (or [[prevenient grace]]) enables humans to freely respond to or to reject the salvation offered through Christ. Classical Arminians believe that a person's saving relationship with Christ is conditional upon faith, and thus, a person can sever their saving relationship with Christ through persistent unbelief.\n\nThe [[Five Articles of Remonstrance]] that Arminius's followers formulated in 1610 state the beliefs regarding (I) conditional election, (II) unlimited atonement, (III) total depravity, (IV) total depravity and resistible grace, and (V) possibility of apostasy. However, the fifth article did not completely deny the perseverance of the saints; Arminius said that \"I never taught that a true believer can\u2026 fall away from the faith\u2026 yet I will not conceal, that there are passages of Scripture which seem to me to wear this aspect; and those answers to them which I have been permitted to see, are not of such as kind as to approve themselves on all points to my understanding.\"<ref>Arminius ''Writings'', I:254</ref> Further, the text of the Articles of Remonstrance says that no believer can be plucked from Christ's hand, and the matter of falling away, \"loss of salvation\" required further study before it could be taught with any certainty.\n\n====Methodism====\n[[Methodism]] falls squarely in the tradition of [[substitutionary atonement]], though it is linked with Christus Victor and [[Moral influence theory of atonement|moral influence]] theories.<ref name=\"Wood2007\">{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Darren Cushman|year=2007|title=John Wesley's Use of Atonement|journal=The Asbury Journal|volume=62|issue=2|pages=55\u201370|language=English}}</ref>  Methodism also emphasizes a participatory nature in atonement, in which the Methodist believer spiritually dies with Christ as He dies for humanity.<ref name=\"Wood2007\"/>\n\nMethodism affirms the doctrine of justification by faith, but in [[Wesleyan theology]], justification refers to \"pardon, the forgiveness of sins\", rather than \"being made actually just and righteous\", which Methodists believe is accomplished through [[Sanctification#Methodism|sanctification]].{{sfn|Elwell|2001|p=1268}}{{efn|Elwell (2001): \"This balance is most evident in Wesley's understanding of faith ''and'' works, justification ''and'' sanctification [...] Wesley himself in a sermon entitled \"Justification by Faith\" makes an attempt to define the term accurately. First, he states what justification is not. It is not being made actually just and righteous (that is sanctification). It is not being cleared of the accusations of Satan, nor of the law, nor even of God. We have sinned, so the accusation stands. Justification implies pardon, the forgiveness of sins. ... Ultimately for the true Wesleyan salvation is completed by our return to original righteousness. This is done by the work of the Holy Spirit. ... The Wesleyan tradition insists that grace is not contrasted with law but with the works of the law. Wesleyans remind us that Jesus came to fulfill, not destroy the law. God made us in his perfect image, and he wants that image restored. He wants to return us to a full and perfect obedience through the process of sanctification [...] Good works follow after justification as its inevitable fruit.

Christ's atonement completely resolved the consequence from the fall of Adam of [[spiritual death]] for infants, young children and those of innocent mental capacity who die before an age of self-accountability, hence all these are resurrected to eternal life in the resurrection.

Early Christians regarded themselves as partaking in a new covenant with God, open to both Jews and gentiles, due to the sacrificial death and subsequent exaltation of Jesus Christ.\n\nEarly Christian notions of the person and sacrificial role of Jesus in human salvation were further elaborated by the Church Fathers, medieval writers and modern scholars in various atonement theories, such as the [[Ransom theory of atonement|ransom theory]], [[Christus Victor|Christus Victor theory]], the [[Recapitulation theory of atonement|recapitulation theory]], the [[Satisfaction theory of atonement|satisfaction theory]], the [[Penal substitution|penal substitution theory]], and the [[Moral influence theory of atonement|moral influence theory]].\n\nVariant views on [[salvation]] are among the main fault lines dividing the various [[Christian denominations]], including conflicting definitions of sin and [[Total depravity|depravity]] (the sinful nature of humankind), [[Justification (theology)|justification]] (God's means of removing the consequences of sin), and [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] (the [[Forgiveness#Christianity|forgiving]] or pardoning of sin through the suffering, death and [[resurrection of Jesus]]).\n\n==Definition and scope==\nSalvation in Christianity, or deliverance or redemption, is the \"saving [of] human beings from death and separation from God\" by [[Christ]]'s death and resurrection.<ref name=CDOS /><!-- **START OF NOTES** -->{{efn|name=\"definition\"|Definition of salvation in Christianity:[[OED|Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd ed. 1989: \"The saving of the soul; the deliverance from sin and its consequences\"}}{{efn|\"Traditional Christianity maintains that human beings are subject to death and eternal separation from God as a result of their sinfulness, but that they can be saved from this condition somehow as a result of what we might refer to as \u201cthe work of Jesus\u201d, which work includes at least his suffering and death on the cross, and perhaps also his sinless life, resurrection, and ascension. We have used the term \u2018theories of the atonement\u2019 here because that is the term most commonly used in the philosophical literature on this topic, and it is a term often enough used in theology as well. But it is not a neutral term. Rather, it already embodies a partial theory about what human salvation involves and about what the work of Christ accomplishes. In particular, it presupposes that saving human beings from death and separation from God primarily involves atoning for sin rather than (say) delivering human beings from some kind of bondage, repairing human nature, or something else. In the New Testament we find various terms and phrases (in addition to \u2018salvation\u2019) used to characterize or describe what the work of Jesus accomplished on behalf of humanity\u2014e.g., justification, redemption or ransom, reconciliation, deliverance from sin, re-creation or rebirth, the offering of an atoning sacrifice, abundant life, and eternal life. Obviously these terms are not all synonymous; so part of the task of an overall theology of salvation\u2014a soteriology\u2014is to sort out the relations among these various terms and phrases (is salvation simply to be identified with eternal life, for example?), to determine which are to be taken literally and which are mere metaphors, and to explain which effects have been brought about by Jesus' life, which by his death, which by his resurrection, and so on.  In light of all this, some theologians and philosophers deliberately avoid talking about \u2018theories of the atonement\u2019 and talk instead about (e.g.) \u2018the theology of reconciliation\u2019 or theories about \u2018the redemption\u2019, etc.\"{{harvnb|Murray|Rea|2012}} }}{{efn|\"At the heart of Christian faith is the reality and hope of salvation in Jesus Christ. Christian faith is faith in the God of salvation revealed in Jesus of Nazareth. The Christian tradition has always equated this salvation with the transcendent, eschatological fulfillment of human existence in a life freed from sin, finitude, and mortality and united with the triune God.

[[Divinization (Christian)|divinization]]).{{sfn|O'Kelley|2014|p=43|ps=: =Fourth, justification is connected to the sacramental system, particularly the sacraments of baptism and penance.

As a process of transformation, ''theosis'' is brought about by the effects of ''[[catharsis]]'' (purification of mind and body) and ''[[Theoria#Eastern Orthodox Catholic and Eastern Catholic Churches|theoria]]'' ('illumination' with the 'vision' of God). According to [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] teaching, ''theosis'' is very much the purpose of human life. It is considered achievable only through a synergy (or cooperation) between human activity and God's uncreated energies (or operations).{{sfn|Bartos|1999|p=253}}{{sfn|Kapsanis|2006}} The synonymous term ''[[Divinization (Christian)|divinization]]'' is the transforming effect of [[divine grace]],{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005c|p=700|loc=grace}} the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|spirit]] of [[God in Christianity|God]], or the atonement of [[Christ]]. ''Theosis'' and ''divinization'' are to be distinguished from [[sanctification]], \"being made holy,\" which can also apply to objects;{{sfn|Abraham|2019|p=224}} and from ''[[apotheosis]]'', also \"divinization,\" lit. \"making divine\").\n\nCatholics believe faith as is active in charity and good works (''fides caritate formata'') can justify man. Forgiveness of sin exists and is infused, but justification can be lost by mortal sin.{{sfn|Pohle|1910}}<ref name=\"vatican.va\">{{cite book|title=Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_31101999_cath-luth-joint-declaration_en.html|accessdate=November 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the Protestant doctrine, sin is merely \"covered\", and righteousness imputed. In [[Lutheranism]] and [[Calvinism]], righteousness from God is viewed as being credited to the sinner's account through [[Sola fide|faith alone]], without [[Good works|works]]. Protestants believe faith without works can justify man because Christ died for sinners, but anyone who truly has faith will produce good works as a product of faith, as a good tree produces good fruit.

Over the centuries, Christians have held different ideas about how Jesus saved people, and different views still exist within different [[Christian denominations]]. According to C. Marvin Pate, \"there are three aspects to Christ's atonement according to the early Church: [[vicarious atonement]] [substitutionary atonement],{{efn|In Christianity, vicarious atonement, also called substitutionary atonement, is the idea that Jesus died \"for us.\"{{sfn|Flood|2012|p=53}}}} the eschatological defeat of Satan [Christ the Victor], and the imitation of Christ [participation in Jesus' death and resurrection].\"{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250-254}} Pate further notes that these three aspects were intertwined in the earliest Christian writings, but that this intertwining was lost since the Patristic times.{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=261}} Due to the influence of [[Gustaf Aulen|Gustaf Aul\u00e9n]]'s (1879\u20131978) ''Christus Victor'', the various theories or paradigms of atonement which developed after the New Testamentical writings are often grouped as \"classic paradigm,\" \"objective paradigm,\" and the \"subjective paradigm\":{{sfn|Weaver|2001|p=2}}{{sfn|Beilby|Eddy|2009|p=11-20}}{{sfn|Aul\u00e9n|1931|p=}}{{efn|[[Karl Barth]] notes a range of alternative themes: ''forensic'' (we are guilty of a crime, and Christ takes the punishment), ''financial'' (we are indebted to God, and Christ pays our debt) and ''cultic'' (Christ makes a sacrifice on our behalf). For various cultural reasons, the oldest themes (honor and sacrifice) prove to have more depth than the more modern ones (payment of a debt, punishment for a crime). But in all these alternatives, the understanding of atonement has the same structure. Human beings owe something to God that we cannot pay. Christ pays it on our behalf. Thus God remains both perfectly just (insisting on a penalty) and perfectly loving (paying the penalty himself). A great many Christians would define such a substitutionary view of the atonement as simply part of what orthodox Christians believe.{{sfn|Placher|2009|}} }}\n\n===Judaism===\nIn the Hebrew writings, God is absolute righteousness, and only pure and sinless persons can approach him.{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}} Reconciliation is achieved by an act of God, namely by his appointment of the sacrificial system,{{efn|name=\"sacrifice\"}} or, in the Prophetic view, \"by the future Divine gift of a new covenant to replace the old covenant which sinful Israel has broken.\"{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}} The Jewish scriptures describe three types of vicarious atonement which result in pureness or sinlesssness: the [[Korban Pesach|Paschal Lamb]];{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}} \"the [[Korban|sacrificial system]] as a whole,\" with the [[Day of Atonement]] as the most essential element;{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}}{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}} and the idea of the [[suffering servant]] (Isaiah 42:1\u20139, 49:1\u20136, 50:4\u201311, 52:13\u201353:12),{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}}<ref group=web name=\"Gandi\">Herald Gandi (2018), [https://www.tms.edu/blog/resurrection-according-to-scriptures/ ''The Resurrection: \u201cAccording to the Scriptures\u201d?'']</ref> \"the action of a Divinely sent [[Servant of the Lord]] who was 'wounded for our transgressions' and 'bare the sin of many'.\"{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}} The [[Old Testament Apocrypha]] adds a fourth idea, namely the righteous martyr (2 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees, Wisdom 2\u20135).{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}}{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}}\n\nThese traditions of atonement offer only temporary forgiveness,{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}} and ''korbanot'' (offerings) could only be used as a means of atoning for the lightest type of sin, that is sins committed in ignorance that the thing was a sin.<ref name=\"jewfaq.org1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/qorbanot.htm|title=Judaism 101: Qorbanot: Sacrifices and Offerings|website=www.jewfaq.org}}</ref>{{efn|name=\"grades of sin\"|Sins in [[Judaism]] consist of different grades of severity:<ref group=web name=\"JE.SIN\"/>\n* The lightest is the ''\u1e25e\u1e6d'', ''\u1e25a\u1e6d\u1e6da'ah'', or ''\u1e25a\u1e6d\u1e6dat''  (lit. \"fault,\" \"shortcoming,\" \"misstep\"), an infraction of a commandment committed in ignorance of the existence or meaning of that command.\n* The second kind is the ''awon'', a breach of a minor commandment committed with a full knowledge of the existence and nature of that commandment (''bemezid''). \n* The gravest kind is the ''pesha'' or ''mered'', a presumptuous and rebellious act against God.

It entails the idea that God deceived the devil,{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5}} and that Satan, or death, had \"legitimate rights\"{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5}} over sinful [[soul]]s in the [[afterlife]], due to the fall of man and [[Original sin|inherited sin]]. During the first millennium CE, the ransom theory of atonement was the dominant metaphor for atonement, both in eastern and western Christianity, until it was replaced in the west by Anselmus' satisfaction theory of atonement.{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|p=114}}\n\nIn one version of the idea of deception, Satan attempted to take Jesus' soul after he had died, but in doing so over-extended his authority, as Jesus had never sinned. As a consequence, Satan lost his authority completely, and all humanity gained freedom. In another version, God entered into a deal with Satan, offering to trade Jesus' soul in exchange for the souls of all people, but after the trade, God [[Resurrection of Jesus|raised Jesus from the dead]] and left Satan with nothing. Other versions held that Jesus' [[divinity]] was masked by his human form, so Satan tried to take Jesus\u2019 soul without realizing that his divinity would destroy Satan's power. Another idea is that Jesus came to teach how not to sin and Satan, in anger with this, tried to take his soul.\n\nThe ransom theory was first clearly enunciated by [[Irenaeus]] (c.130\u2013c.202),{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|p=xliv,114}} who was an outspoken critic of [[Gnosticism]], but borrowed ideas from their dualistic worldview.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}} In this worldview, humankind is under the power of the [[Demiurge|Demiurg]], a lesser God who has created the world. Yet, humans have a spark of the true divine nature within them, which can be liberated by [[gnosis]] (knowledge) of this divine spark. This knowledge is revealed by the [[Logos]], \"the very mind of the supreme God,\" who entered the world in the person of Jesus. Nevertheless, the Logos could not simply undo the power of the Demiurg, and had to hide his real identity, appearing as a physical form, thereby misleading the Demiurg, and liberating humankind.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}} In Irenaeus' writings, the Demiurge is replaced by the devil, while Justin Martyr had already eqauted Jesus and the Logos.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}}\n\n[[Origen]] (184\u2013253) introduced the idea that the devil held legitimate rights over humans, who were bought free by the blood of Christ.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5-6}} He also introduced the notion that the devil was deceived in thinking that he could master the human soul.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=6}}\n\n[[Gustaf Aul\u00e9n]] reinterpreted the ransom theory in his study ''[[Christus Victor]]'' (1931),{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=8}} calling it the [[Christus Victor]] doctrine, arguing that Christ's death was not a payment to the Devil, but defeated the powers of evil, particularly [[Satan]], which had held humankind in their dominion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> According to Pugh, \"Ever since [Aul\u00e9n's] time, we call these patristic ideas the ''Christus Victor'' way of seeing the cross.\"{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=1}}\n\n====Recapitulation theory====\n{{Main|Recapitulation theory of atonement}}\n\nThe recapitulation view, first comprehensively expressed by [[Irenaeus]],{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|p=114-118}} went \"hand-in-hand\" with the ransom theory.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=1}} It says that Christ succeeds where [[Adam]] [[fall of man|failed]],{{sfn|Bethune-Baker|1903|p=334|ps=: Just as mankind in Adam lost its birthright, so in Christ mankind recovers its original condition}} undoing the wrong that Adam did and, because of his union with humanity, leads humanity on to [[immortality|eternal life]], including [[christian ethics|moral perfection]].{{sfn|Franks|n.d.|pp=37-38}} [[Divinization (Christian)|Theosis]] (\"divinisation\") is a \"corollary\" of the recapitulation.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=31}}\n\n===Objective paradigm===\n\n====Satisfaction====\n{{Main|Satisfaction theory of atonement}}\n\nIn the 11th century, [[Anselm of Canterbury]] rejected the ransom view and proposed the [[satisfaction theory of atonement]].

In this view, people needed salvation from the [[divine retribution|divine punishment]] that these offences would bring, since nothing they could do could repay the honor debt. Anselm held that Christ had infinitely honored God through his life and death and that Christ could repay what humanity owed God, thus satisfying the offence to God's honor and doing away with the need for punishment. When Anselm proposed the satisfaction view, it was immediately criticized by [[Peter Abelard]].\n\n====Penal substitution====\n{{Main|Penal substitution}}\n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant Reformers]] reinterpreted Anselm's satisfaction theory of salvation within a legal paradigm. In the legal system, offences required punishment, and no satisfaction could be given to avert this need. They proposed a theory known as [[penal substitution]], in which Christ takes the penalty of people's sin as their substitute, thus saving people from [[Divine retribution|God's wrath]] against sin. Penal substitution thus presents Jesus saving people from the divine punishment of their past wrongdoings. However, this salvation is not presented as automatic. Rather, a person must have [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] in order to receive this free gift of salvation. In the penal substitution view, salvation is not dependent upon human effort or deeds.{{sfn|Pugh|2015}}\n\nThe penal substitution paradigm of salvation is widely held among Protestants, who often consider it central to Christianity.

The Cross was where Justice and Love met vis-\u00e0-vis. It was where man affirmed his estrangement and God affirmed His belongedness. It was where God accepted man as he was.

This restores the relation with God, who is loving and reaches out to humanity, and offers the possibility of ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'' c.q. [[Divinization (Christian)|divinization]], becoming the kind of humans God wants us to be.\n\nIn [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholicism]] salvation is seen as participation in the renewal of human nature itself by way of the eternal [[Logos (Christianity)|Word of God]] assuming the human nature in its fullness. In contrast to [[Western Christianity|Western branches]] of theology, Orthodox Christians tend to use the word \"expiation\" with regard to what is accomplished in the sacrificial act. In [[Orthodox theology]], expiation is an act of offering that seeks to change the one making the offering. The [[Koine Greek|Biblical Greek]] word which is translated both as \"[[propitiation]]\" and as \"expiation\" is ''hilasmos'', which means \"to make acceptable and enable one to draw close to God\".  Thus the Orthodox emphasis would be that Christ died, not to appease an angry and vindictive Father or to avert the [[Divine retribution|wrath of God]] upon sinners, but to defeat and secure the destruction of sin and death, so that those who are [[ancestral sin|fallen]] and in spiritual bondage may become divinely [[Transfiguration (religion)|transfigured]], and therefore fully human, as their Creator intended; that is to say, human creatures become God in his [[Essence-Energies distinction (Eastern Orthodox theology)|energies or operations but not in his essence or identity]], conforming to the image of Christ and reacquiring the divine likeness (see ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'').<ref>Fr.

Broadly speaking, [[Protestants]] hold to the [[Five solae|five ''solae'']] of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], which declare that salvation is attained by ''[[grace alone]]'' in ''[[Christ alone]]'' through ''[[faith alone]]'' for the ''[[Soli Deo gloria|Glory of God alone]]'' as told in ''[[Scripture alone]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nMost Protestants believe that salvation is achieved through God's grace alone, and once salvation is secured in the person, good works will be a result of this, allowing good works to often operate as a signifier for salvation. Some Protestants, such as [[Lutherans]] and the [[Reformed]], understand this to mean that God saves solely by grace, and that works follow as a necessary consequence of saving grace. Others, such as [[Methodists]] (and other Arminians), believe that salvation is by faith alone, but that salvation can be forfeited if it is not accompanied by continued faith, and the works that naturally follow from it. A minority rigidly believe that salvation is accomplished by [[Sola fide|faith alone]] without any reference to works whatsoever, including the works that may follow salvation (see [[Free Grace theology]]).\n\n===Lutheranism===\n{{Main|Lutheranism}}\nLutherans believe that God has [[Unlimited atonement|justified all sinners]], that is, he has declared them \"[[Justification (theology)|not guilty]]\" for the sake of Christ. Lutheran churches believe that this is the central message in the [[Bible]] upon which the very existence of the churches depends. In Lutheranism, it is a message relevant to people of all races and social levels, of all times and places, for \"the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men\" (Romans 5:18). All need forgiveness of sins before God, and Scripture proclaims that all have been justified, for \"the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men\" (Romans 5:18).<ref>[https://wels.net/about-wels/what-we-believe/this-we-believe/justification/ This We Believe \u2013 IV.

People are not by nature inclined to love God with their whole heart, mind, or strength, but rather all are inclined to serve their own interests over those of their neighbor and to reject the rule of God. Thus, all people by their own faculties are morally unable to choose to follow God and be saved because they are unwilling to do so out of the necessity of their own natures. (The term \"total\" in this context refers to sin affecting every part of a person, not that every person is as evil as possible.)<ref>David Steele and Curtis Thomas, \"The Five Points of Calvinism Defined, Defended, Documented,\" pg.25, \"The adjective 'total' does not mean that each sinner is as totally or completely corrupt in his actions and thoughts as it is possible for him to be. Instead, the word 'total' is used to indicate that the \"whole\" of man's being has been affected by sin.\"</ref> This doctrine is derived from [[Augustine]]'s explanation of [[Original Sin]].\n* \"[[Unconditional election]]\" asserts that God has chosen from [[eternity]] those whom he will bring to himself not based on foreseen virtue, merit, or faith in those people; rather, it is unconditionally grounded in God's mercy alone. God has chosen from [[eternity]] to extend mercy to those he has chosen and to withhold mercy from those not chosen. Those chosen receive salvation through Christ alone.

This implies that only the sins of [[the elect]] were [[penal substitution|atoned]] for by Jesus's death. Calvinists do not believe, however, that the atonement is limited in its value or power, but rather that the atonement is limited in the sense that it is designed for some and not all. Hence, Calvinists hold that the atonement is sufficient for all and efficient for the elect.<ref>[http://www.calvinistcorner.com/tulip.htm The Five Points of Calvinism]. The Calvinist Corner.

This means that when God sovereignly purposes to save someone, that individual certainly will be saved. The doctrine holds that this purposeful influence of God's [[Holy Spirit]] cannot be resisted, but that the Holy Spirit, \"graciously causes the elect sinner to cooperate, to believe, to repent, to come freely and willingly to Christ.\"<ref>[http://www.the-highway.com/compare.html Comparison of Calvinism and Arminianism].

Those who apparently fall away either never had true faith to begin with or will return. The word \"saints\" is used to refer to all who are set apart by God, and not only those who are exceptionally [[holy]], [[Canonization|canonized]], or in [[heaven]]).<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/boettner/predest.iv.vi.html |chapter=The Perseverance of the Saints |title=The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination |author=[[Loraine Boettner]] |accessdate=2009-03-25}}</ref>\n\n===Arminianism===\n{{Main|Arminianism}}\nArminianism is a school of soteriological thought within Protestant Christianity, held by Christian denominations such as the [[Methodist Church]]. It is based on the theological ideas of the Dutch Reformed theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]] (1560\u20131609). Like Calvinists, [[Arminians]] agree that all people are born sinful and are in need of salvation. Classical Arminians emphasize that God's free grace (or [[prevenient grace]]) enables humans to freely respond to or to reject the salvation offered through Christ. Classical Arminians believe that a person's saving relationship with Christ is conditional upon faith, and thus, a person can sever their saving relationship with Christ through persistent unbelief.\n\nThe [[Five Articles of Remonstrance]] that Arminius's followers formulated in 1610 state the beliefs regarding (I) conditional election, (II) unlimited atonement, (III) total depravity, (IV) total depravity and resistible grace, and (V) possibility of apostasy. However, the fifth article did not completely deny the perseverance of the saints; Arminius said that \"I never taught that a true believer can\u2026 fall away from the faith\u2026 yet I will not conceal, that there are passages of Scripture which seem to me to wear this aspect; and those answers to them which I have been permitted to see, are not of such as kind as to approve themselves on all points to my understanding.\"<ref>Arminius ''Writings'', I:254</ref> Further, the text of the Articles of Remonstrance says that no believer can be plucked from Christ's hand, and the matter of falling away, \"loss of salvation\" required further study before it could be taught with any certainty.\n\n====Methodism====\n[[Methodism]] falls squarely in the tradition of [[substitutionary atonement]], though it is linked with Christus Victor and [[Moral influence theory of atonement|moral influence]] theories.<ref name=\"Wood2007\">{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Darren Cushman|year=2007|title=John Wesley's Use of Atonement|journal=The Asbury Journal|volume=62|issue=2|pages=55\u201370|language=English}}</ref>  Methodism also emphasizes a participatory nature in atonement, in which the Methodist believer spiritually dies with Christ as He dies for humanity.<ref name=\"Wood2007\"/>\n\nMethodism affirms the doctrine of justification by faith, but in [[Wesleyan theology]], justification refers to \"pardon, the forgiveness of sins\", rather than \"being made actually just and righteous\", which Methodists believe is accomplished through [[Sanctification#Methodism|sanctification]].{{sfn|Elwell|2001|p=1268}}{{efn|Elwell (2001): \"This balance is most evident in Wesley's understanding of faith ''and'' works, justification ''and'' sanctification [...] Wesley himself in a sermon entitled \"Justification by Faith\" makes an attempt to define the term accurately.

It is not being cleared of the accusations of Satan, nor of the law, nor even of God. We have sinned, so the accusation stands. Justification implies pardon, the forgiveness of sins. ... Ultimately for the true Wesleyan salvation is completed by our return to original righteousness. This is done by the work of the Holy Spirit. ... The Wesleyan tradition insists that grace is not contrasted with law but with the works of the law. Wesleyans remind us that Jesus came to fulfill, not destroy the law. God made us in his perfect image, and he wants that image restored. He wants to return us to a full and perfect obedience through the process of sanctification [...] Good works follow after justification as its inevitable fruit.

Swedenborg's account of atonement has much in common with the Christus Victor doctrine, which refers to a [[Christianity|Christian]] understanding of the Atonement which views  [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's death]] as the means by which the powers of [[evil]], which held humanity under their dominion, were defeated.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Leon Morris, 'Theories of the Atonement' in ''Elwell Evangelical Dictionary''.</ref> It is a model of the atonement that is dated to the [[Church Fathers]],<ref name=Oxenham>H.

In the [[Book of Mormon]] the prophet [[Amulek]] teaches that the \"great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal. And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.14-16?lang=eng|title=Alma 34:14\u201316}}</ref> There are two parts of salvation, conditional and unconditional. Unconditional salvation means that the atonement of Jesus Christ redeems all humanity from the chains of death and they are resurrected to their perfect frames.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40.23?lang=eng|title=Alma 40:23}}</ref> Conditional salvation of the righteous comes by grace coupled with strict obedience to Gospel principles, in which those who have upheld the highest standards and are committed to the [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenants]] and [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] of God, will inherit the [[Celestial kingdom|highest heaven]]. There is no need for infant baptism. Christ's atonement completely resolved the consequence from the fall of Adam of [[spiritual death]] for infants, young children and those of innocent mental capacity who die before an age of self-accountability, hence all these are resurrected to eternal life in the resurrection. However, baptism is required of those who are deemed by God to be accountable for their actions ([https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.10-22?lang=eng Moroni 8:10\u201322])\n\n===The United Pentecostal Church===\n[[Oneness Pentecostals]] teach that the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ are the only means by which atonement can be obtained for dying humanity, and which makes the free gift of God's salvation possible.  They believe that all must put faith in the propitiatory work of Christ to gain everlasting life.  According to United Pentecostal theology, this saving faith is more than just mental assent or intellectual acceptance, or even verbal profession, but must include trust, appropriation, application, action, and obedience.  They contend that [[water baptism]] is one of the works of faith and obedience necessary for Christ's sacrificial atonement to be efficacious.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110612115253/http://upci.org/about-us/beliefs/21-about-us/beliefs/91 Our Doctrinal Foundation] \u2013 United Pentecostal Church International.

Several Carthaginian generals used its port during the [[Punic Wars]] of 264-146 BC - such as [[Hamilcar Barca]], [[Mago (Barcid)|Mago]], [[Hasdrubal (Barcid)|Hasdrubal]] and [[Hannibal]].\n* In 149 BC the first Roman raids occurred. During the ascendancy of [[Julius Caesar]] the  [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] occupied the city, calling it Hippo Diarrhytus. The city regained its prosperity and progress from the reign of [[Augustus]] (Emperor from 27 BC to 14 AD) and  maintained maritime relations with [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], as shown by a mosaic decorating its commercial representation in the square of [[Piazzale delle Corporazioni|Forum of Corporations]]. Christianity spread in the city under the Empire.\n* In 439 AD [[Genseric]], the king of the [[Vandals]] ([[Germanic peoples|East Germanic tribes]]) and his followers invaded the city and used the port as a base for invasions into other parts of the [[Western Roman Empire]]: the city of Rome and the islands of [[Sardinia]], [[Malta]], [[Corsica]] and [[Sicily]]. The town appears on the medieval [[Peutinger Map]].\n* From 534 AD to 642 AD the city came under the control of the [[Byzantine Empire]] after a defeat of the Vandals in 534; they{{who|date=July 2019}} build the Fort of Bizerte (now the Fort of Kasba).\n\n[[File:BizerteKasba.jpg|thumb|right|Old Port of Bizerte]]\n[[File:Pilsum leaving Bizerte.jpg|thumb|right|The moveable bridge of the Bizerte canal]]\n\n===Later history===\n[[Rashidun Caliphate|Arab]] armies took Bizerte in 647 in their first invasion of the area, but the city reverted to control from Constantinople until the Byzantines were defeated and finally driven from North Africa in 695\u201398. The troops of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] captured the city in 1535; the [[Conquest of Tunis (1574)|Turks took it in 1574]]. The city then became a [[Barbary Pirate|corsair]] harbour and struggled against the French and the Venetians.\n\nWith its occupation of Tunisia in 1881, [[French Third Republic|France]] gained control of Bizerte and built a large naval harbour in the city.\n\nIn 1924, after the French government officially recognized the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR), [[Wrangel's fleet|the western military fleet of White Russia]] that had been kept in the port of Bizerte was returned to the Soviet government. The ships were never moved from the port and finally were sold there as scrap metal.\n\nIn March 1939, towards the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[Spanish Republican Navy]] Commander [[Miguel Buiza Fern\u00e1ndez-Palacios|Miguel Buiza]] ordered the evacuation of the bulk of the Republican fleet. Three cruisers, eight destroyers and two submarines left [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] harbor and reached Bizerte, where the French authorities impounded them.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink= Hugh Thomas (writer) |last= Thomas |first= Hugh |title= The Spanish Civil War\n| publisher = [[Penguin Books]] |year= 2001 |location= London |page= 877}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German]] and [[Royal Italian Army|Italian armies]] occupied Bizerte until [[Tunisian Campaign|Allied troops defeated them]] on 7 May 1943. During the fighting between the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] and the German Army, many of the city's inhabitants fled to the countryside or to [[Tunis]].

The face-off turned nasty when a French helicopter took off and drew fire.   The French brought in reinforcements; when these were fired upon, France took decisive military action against the Tunisian forces. Using state-of-the-art weapons and decisive force the French took Bizerte and [[Menzel Bourguiba]].  During three days in July 1961, 700 Tunisians died (1200 wounded); the French lost 24 dead (100 wounded).{{citation needed|date= July 2014}}\n\nMeetings at the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] and other international pressure moved France to agreement; the French military finally abandoned Bizerte on 15 October 1963.{{citation needed|date= July 2014}}\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\nBizerte is on a section of widened inlet and east-facing coast of the north coast of Tunisia, 15 kilometres from [[Ras ben Sakka]] (the northernmost point in Africa on the [[Mediterranean Sea]]), 20 kilometers northeast of the [[Ichkeul lake]] (a World Heritage Site), 30 kilometers (18 miles) north of the archaeological site of [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and 65 kilometers north of [[Tunis]].\n\nit has to the west coastal hills forming an outcrop of the [[Tell Atlas]] with well-conserved woods and vantage points.  Its associated beaches include Sidi Salem, La Grotte, Rasenjela, and Al Rimel.  It is on a section of Mediterranean climate coastline, close to [[Sardinia]] and [[Sicily]], as opposed to coasts in the south of the country which have a year-round dry desert climate.\n\nThe city is centered on the north shore of the canal of Bizerte linking the Mediterranean Sea to a tidal lake, the [[Lac de Bizerte]] which is larger than all parts of the town combined, to the immediate south.  Built-up areas are in three directions:\n*South-west along the widening canal with jetties at Pecherie and Jarrouba, the latter associated with [[Bizerte-Sidi Ahmed Air Base]] adjoining the opening of the lake and military/rescue heliport.  \n*North are Sidi Salam and Corniche. They are within meters of the coast and on coast-facing slopes of the Ain Berda, a range of hills toward Cap Blanc, a small headland in the Ain Damou Plage natural conservation area. \n*Zarzouna, [[Menzel Jemil]] and [[Menzel Abderrahmane]] are on the south shore of the canal, formed by the locality of Zarzouna and the towns of [[Menzel Jemil]] and [[Menzel Abderrahmane]], by a moveable bridge and both Menzels face the lake itself.  The rest of the [[isthmus]] on which they stand is the gently rising Foret de Remel, reaching a high point east of its forest area at [[Cap Zebib]].\n\n===Transport===\nThe bridge leads to [[A4 motorway (Tunisia)|the motorway A4]] leading to [[Tunis\u2013Carthage International Airport]] and the capital. On the town side the P11 passes semi-rural Louata, hugs Ichkeul Lake and branches into a western route, the P7, leading directly to [[Tabarka]] on the coast next to the Algerian border.  The P11 leads south-west to [[B\u00e9ja]], a governorate center, in the foothills of the [[Tell Atlas]], forks into several roads at [[Bou Salem]], a small town in a broad fertile plain, and climbs to Firnanah passing two high-altitude lakes and also approaching the north-west border with Algeria.\n\n===Climate===\nBizerte enjoys a [[Mediterranean climate#Hot-summer Mediterranean climate|hot-summer mediterranean]] climate, with mild rainy winters and hot dry summers. The Mediterranean Sea breeze makes summers less hot and more humid.<ref name=\"Climate\u2013Data.Eu\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.climatedata.eu/climate.php?loc=tsxx0001&lang=en |title=Climate Bizerte

There are several military bases and year-round tourism. As a tourist centre the region is however not as popular as the eastern coast of Tunisia. There is manufacturing (textile, auto parts, cookware), fishing, fruits and vegetables, and wheat.\n\n==Miscellaneous==\n\n[[File:Jebel A\u00efn Chouna.jpg|thumb|right|Jebel A\u00efn Chouna]]\n* The port of Bizerte is being developed into a significant Mediterranean yachting marina that was scheduled to open in May 2012. The superyacht section of the marina will be called Goga Superyacht Marina, and will have berths for yachts of up to 110m in length. It is expected that this will give a significant boost to the local economy as the yacht owners and also the hundreds of professional crew will become year-round consumers. The service industries supplying the yachts will gradually develop and bring additional employment.<ref>{{cite web |author=Morley Yachts |url=http://www.GogaMarina.com |title=Goga Superyacht Marina |publisher=Gogamarina.com |date=2009-07-29 |accessdate=2012-08-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605024331/http://gogamarina.com/ |archivedate=2013-06-05 }}</ref>\n* The actor [[Abdelmajid Lakhal]] was born in Bizerte.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n* The Teapacks song \"Lo haya lano klum\" is about how bandleader [[Kobi Oz]]' family were expelled from Bizerte by the Nazis in 1942.\n\n==Titular see==\nHippo Diarrhytus is a [[titular see]] of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].

Serbian soldiers, and a small number of civilians, arrived in Bizerte on three occasions. In December 1915 and early 1916, after the Albanian Golgotha, then later in 1916 after the first clashes on the [[Salonica Front]] in [[Greece]] and in the early 1917 when Serbian volunteers began to gather in Bizerte. During the entire war, the soldiers were transported to the Salonica Front while the wounded were transported back to Tunisia. It is estimated that over 60,000 Serbian soldiers passed through the camp. The training of the volunteers was organized in the camp, education of the disabled but also the cultural events.<ref name=vojska>{{cite web|url= http://www.istorijskabiblioteka.com/art:srpska-vojska-u-bizerti |author= |title= Srpska vojska u Bizerti |date=|publisher=Istorijska biblioteka|language=Serbian}}</ref> French-Serbian dictionary was compiled and published by [[Veselin \u010cajkanovi\u0107]] in Bizerte.

Several Carthaginian generals used its port during the [[Punic Wars]] of 264-146 BC - such as [[Hamilcar Barca]], [[Mago (Barcid)|Mago]], [[Hasdrubal (Barcid)|Hasdrubal]] and [[Hannibal]].\n* In 149 BC the first Roman raids occurred. During the ascendancy of [[Julius Caesar]] the  [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] occupied the city, calling it Hippo Diarrhytus. The city regained its prosperity and progress from the reign of [[Augustus]] (Emperor from 27 BC to 14 AD) and  maintained maritime relations with [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], as shown by a mosaic decorating its commercial representation in the square of [[Piazzale delle Corporazioni|Forum of Corporations]]. Christianity spread in the city under the Empire.\n* In 439 AD [[Genseric]], the king of the [[Vandals]] ([[Germanic peoples|East Germanic tribes]]) and his followers invaded the city and used the port as a base for invasions into other parts of the [[Western Roman Empire]]: the city of Rome and the islands of [[Sardinia]], [[Malta]], [[Corsica]] and [[Sicily]]. The town appears on the medieval [[Peutinger Map]].\n* From 534 AD to 642 AD the city came under the control of the [[Byzantine Empire]] after a defeat of the Vandals in 534; they{{who|date=July 2019}} build the Fort of Bizerte (now the Fort of Kasba).\n\n[[File:BizerteKasba.jpg|thumb|right|Old Port of Bizerte]]\n[[File:Pilsum leaving Bizerte.jpg|thumb|right|The moveable bridge of the Bizerte canal]]\n\n===Later history===\n[[Rashidun Caliphate|Arab]] armies took Bizerte in 647 in their first invasion of the area, but the city reverted to control from Constantinople until the Byzantines were defeated and finally driven from North Africa in 695-98. The troops of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] captured the city in 1535; the [[Conquest of Tunis (1574)|Turks took it in 1574]]. The city then became a [[Barbary Pirate|corsair]] harbour and struggled against the French and the Venetians.\n\nWith its occupation of Tunisia in 1881, [[French Third Republic|France]] gained control of Bizerte and built a large naval harbour in the city.\n\nIn 1924, after the French government officially recognized the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR), [[Wrangel's fleet|the western military fleet of White Russia]] that had been kept in the port of Bizerte was returned to the Soviet government. The ships were never moved from the port and finally were sold there as scrap metal.\n\nIn March 1939, towards the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[Spanish Republican Navy]] Commander [[Miguel Buiza Fern\u00e1ndez-Palacios|Miguel Buiza]] ordered the evacuation of the bulk of the Republican fleet. Three cruisers, eight destroyers and two submarines left [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] harbor and reached Bizerte, where the French authorities impounded them.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink= Hugh Thomas (writer) |last= Thomas |first= Hugh |title= The Spanish Civil War\n| publisher = [[Penguin Books]] |year= 2001 |location= London |page= 877}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German]] and [[Royal Italian Army|Italian armies]] occupied Bizerte until [[Tunisian Campaign|Allied troops defeated them]] on 7 May 1943.

The face-off turned nasty when a French helicopter took off and drew fire.   The French brought in reinforcements; when these were fired upon, France took decisive military action against the Tunisian forces. Using state-of-the-art weapons and decisive force the French took Bizerte and [[Menzel Bourguiba]].  During three days in July 1961, 700 Tunisians died (1200 wounded); the French lost 24 dead (100 wounded).{{citation needed|date= July 2014}}\n\nMeetings at the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] and other international pressure moved France to agreement; the French military finally abandoned Bizerte on 15 October 1963.{{citation needed|date= July 2014}}\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\nBizerte is on a section of widened inlet and east-facing coast of the north coast of Tunisia, 15 kilometres from [[Ras ben Sakka]] (the northernmost point in Africa on the [[Mediterranean Sea]]), 20 kilometers northeast of the [[Ichkeul lake]] (a World Heritage Site), 30 kilometers (18 miles) north of the archaeological site of [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and 65 kilometers north of [[Tunis]].\n\nit has to the west coastal hills forming an outcrop of the [[Tell Atlas]] with well-conserved woods and vantage points.  Its associated beaches include Sidi Salem, La Grotte, Rasenjela, and Al Rimel.  It is on a section of Mediterranean climate coastline, close to [[Sardinia]] and [[Sicily]], as opposed to coasts in the south of the country which have a year-round dry desert climate.\n\nThe city is centered on the north shore of the canal of Bizerte linking the Mediterranean Sea to a tidal lake, the [[Lac de Bizerte]] which is larger than all parts of the town combined, to the immediate south.  Built-up areas are in three directions:\n*South-west along the widening canal with jetties at Pecherie and Jarrouba, the latter associated with [[Bizerte-Sidi Ahmed Air Base]] adjoining the opening of the lake and military/rescue heliport.  \n*North are Sidi Salam and Corniche. They are within meters of the coast and on coast-facing slopes of the Ain Berda, a range of hills toward Cap Blanc, a small headland in the Ain Damou Plage natural conservation area. \n*Zarzouna, [[Menzel Jemil]] and [[Menzel Abderrahmane]] are on the south shore of the canal, formed by the locality of Zarzouna and the towns of [[Menzel Jemil]] and [[Menzel Abderrahmane]], by a moveable bridge and both Menzels face the lake itself.  The rest of the [[isthmus]] on which they stand is the gently rising Foret de Remel, reaching a high point east of its forest area at [[Cap Zebib]].\n\n===Transport===\nThe bridge leads to [[A4 motorway (Tunisia)|the motorway A4]] leading to [[Tunis\u2013Carthage International Airport]] and the capital. On the town side the P11 passes semi-rural Louata, hugs Ichkeul Lake and branches into a western route, the P7, leading directly to [[Tabarka]] on the coast next to the Algerian border.  The P11 leads south-west to [[B\u00e9ja]], a governorate center, in the foothills of the [[Tell Atlas]], forks into several roads at [[Bou Salem]], a small town in a broad fertile plain, and climbs to Firnanah passing two high-altitude lakes and also approaching the north-west border with Algeria.\n\n===Climate===\nBizerte enjoys a [[Mediterranean climate#Hot-summer Mediterranean climate|hot-summer mediterranean]] climate, with mild rainy winters and hot dry summers. The Mediterranean Sea breeze makes summers less hot and more humid.<ref name=\"Climate\u2013Data.Eu\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.climatedata.eu/climate.php?loc=tsxx0001&lang=en |title=Climate Bizerte

The inhabitants speak [[Sonsorolese language|Sonsorolese]], a local [[Trukic languages|Trukic]] language, and [[Palauan language|Palauan]].\n\nThe islands of the state of Sonsorol, together with the islands of [[Hatohobei]], form the [[Southwest Islands (Palau)|Southwest Islands]] of Palau.\n\nThe state is subdivided into four [[municipality|municipalities]], which correspond to the four individual islands, that were previously inhabited.

The island is thickly wooded with coconut palms and other trees. The island is referenced as a [[municipality]]. Mariano Carlos was serving as chief from 2000 until the [[Typhoon Bopha]] evacuation. Fanna Island and nearby Sonsorol Island 1.6&nbsp;km further south together form the Sonsorol Islands.\n\n===Sonsorol===\nSonsorol Island, also called ''Dongosaro'' or Dongosaru, is encircled by a coral reef extending 160 to 480 m offshore. It is 2&nbsp;km long north south, and up to 890 m wide in the north. It is located 1.6&nbsp;km south of Fanna Island. The village of Dongosaro, which is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the state, is located on the west coast. The island is thickly wooded with coconut palms and other trees. Together with Fanna, it forms the Sonsorol Islands.\n\nSonsorol was probably the first of Palau islands visited by a European - the Jesuit expedition of [[Francisco Padilla]] on 30 November 1710.\nA year after [[Typhoon Bopha]], Palau government issued a reconstruction plan to this island, and also built a small dock.\n\n===Pulo Anna===\nPulo Anna or ''Puro'' is fringed by a coral reef extending beyond 460 m offshore. The island itself is about elliptical and measures 800 meters northeast-southwest, and is up to 550 meters wide. A village named Puro was once on the northwest side of the island. Pulo Anna lies in the flow of the [[Equatorial Countercurrent]] throughout the year.\n\n===Merir===\nMerir Island, or ''Melieli'', is fringed by reef which extends beyond 1100 m offshore in the south and 160 m in the north. The edges of the reef are steep-to, except at the northern end where a spit, with a depth of 12.8 meters at its outer end, extends about 1300 meters northward. The island itself is 2.200 meters north south, and up to 600 meters wide. A village named Melieli, which had a radio station, was located on the northwest side of the island.\n\n==History==\nThe first sighting by Europeans of the Sonsorols, was that of Sonsorol and Fanna by the Spanish ship [[Trinidad (ship)|''Trinidad'']] then commanded by Gonzalo G\u00f3mez de Espinosa on 6 May 1522.<ref>Brand, Donald D. ''The Pacific Basin: A History of its Geographical Explorations'' The American Geographical Society, New York, 1967, p.119.</ref><ref>Sharp, Andrew ''The discovery of the Pacific Islands'' Oxford, 1960, p.10.</ref> These two were collectively charted as ''San Juan'' islands (St.John) as they were sighted on the day of its festivity. A Spanish missionary expedition commanded by [[Sargento Mayor]] [[Francisco Padilla]] arrived to Sonsorol on 30 November 1710, coming from [[Manila]] on board of [[patache]] ''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad''. In 1712 they were explored by an expedition commanded by Spanish naval officer Bernardo de Egoy.<ref>Coello, Francisco \"Conflicto hispano-alem\u00e1n\" ''Bolet\u00edn de Sociedad Geogr\u00e1fica de Madrid'', t.XIX. 2\u00ba semestre 1885, Madrid, p.247</ref>\n\nDuring December 2012, the state suffered severely from [[Typhoon Bopha]] and people were evacuated to Akebesang in [[Koror]].

The administrative center, and only village, is [[Dongosaru]] on Sonsorol island. The inhabitants speak [[Sonsorolese language|Sonsorolese]], a local [[Trukic languages|Trukic]] language, and [[Palauan language|Palauan]].\n\nThe islands of the state of Sonsorol, together with the islands of [[Hatohobei]], form the [[Southwest Islands (Palau)|Southwest Islands]] of Palau.\n\nThe state is subdivided into four [[municipality|municipalities]], which correspond to the four individual islands, that were previously inhabited.

The island is thickly wooded with coconut palms and other trees. The island is referenced as a [[municipality]]. Mariano Carlos was serving as chief from 2000 until the [[Typhoon Bopha]] evacuation. Fanna Island and nearby Sonsorol Island 1.6&nbsp;km further south together form the Sonsorol Islands.\n\n===Sonsorol===\nSonsorol Island, also called ''Dongosaro'' or Dongosaru, is encircled by a coral reef extending 160 to 480 m offshore. It is 2&nbsp;km long north south, and up to 890 m wide in the north. It is located 1.6&nbsp;km south of Fanna Island. The village of Dongosaro, which is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the state, is located on the west coast. The island is thickly wooded with coconut palms and other trees. Together with Fanna, it forms the Sonsorol Islands.\n\nSonsorol was probably the first of Palau islands visited by a European - the Jesuit expedition of [[Francisco Padilla]] on 30 November 1710.\nA year after [[Typhoon Bopha]], Palau government issued a reconstruction plan to this island, and also built a small dock. \n\n===Pulo Anna===\nPulo Anna or ''Puro'' is fringed by a coral reef extending beyond 460 m offshore. The island itself is about elliptical and measures 800 meters northeast-southwest, and is up to 550 meters wide. A village named Puro was once on the northwest side of the island. Pulo Anna lies in the flow of the [[Equatorial Countercurrent]] throughout the year.\n\n===Merir===\nMerir Island, or ''Melieli'', is fringed by reef which extends beyond 1100 m offshore in the south and 160 m in the north. The edges of the reef are steep-to, except at the northern end where a spit, with a depth of 12.8 meters at its outer end, extends about 1300 meters northward. The island itself is 2.200 meters north south, and up to 600 meters wide. A village named Melieli, which had a radio station, was located on the northwest side of the island.\n\n==History==\nThe first sighting by Europeans of the Sonsorols, was that of Sonsorol and Fanna by the Spanish ship [[Trinidad (ship)|''Trinidad'']] then commanded by Gonzalo G\u00f3mez de Espinosa on 6 May 1522.<ref>Brand, Donald D. ''The Pacific Basin: A History of its Geographical Explorations'' The American Geographical Society, New York, 1967, p.119.</ref><ref>Sharp, Andrew ''The discovery of the Pacific Islands'' Oxford, 1960, p.10.</ref> These two were collectively charted as ''San Juan'' islands (St.John) as they were sighted on the day of its festivity. A Spanish missionary expedition commanded by [[Sargento Mayor]] [[Francisco Padilla]] arrived to Sonsorol on 30 November 1710, coming from [[Manila]] on board of [[patache]] ''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad''. In 1712 they were explored by an expedition commanded by Spanish naval officer Bernardo de Egoy.<ref>Coello, Francisco \"Conflicto hispano-alem\u00e1n\" ''Bolet\u00edn de Sociedad Geogr\u00e1fica de Madrid'', t.XIX. 2\u00ba semestre 1885, Madrid, p.247</ref>\n\nDuring December 2012, the state suffered severely from [[Typhoon Bopha]] and people were evacuated to Akebesang in [[Koror]]. There were 37 people from Sonsorol, 19 from Pulo Anna and 2 from Merir. A couple of months later, and due to government decision, only Sonsorol was re-inhabited (cheaper and closer to get to and send supplies). 42 people have returned to the island, and it is the only inhabited island in the state (as of 2014).\n\n== Education==\nThe [[Ministry of Education (Palau)|Ministry of Education]] operates two public schools in the state:\n* Pulo Anna Elementary School - Built in 1972, it has one classroom and one teacher, with facilities for its students (five, as of September 2018) to stay on the otherwise deserted island<ref>{{cite web |title=Pulo Anna Elementary School |url=http://www.palaumoe.net/puloanna/ |date=2018-09-21 |url-status=dead |work=Ministry of Education, Republic of Palau |location=[[Koror City]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209183529/http://www.palaumoe.net/puloanna/ |archivedate=2018-12-09 |access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n* Sonsorol Elementary School - Established in 1972, it has one classroom and one teacher, to serve the students (thirteen, as of September 2018) who already live on the island<ref>{{cite web |title=Sonsorol Elementary School |url=http://www.palaumoe.net/sonsorol/ |date=2018-09-21 |url-status=dead |work=Ministry of Education, Republic of Palau |location=[[Koror City]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209183614/http://www.palaumoe.net/sonsorol/ |archivedate=2018-12-09 |access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\nIn 1962, the country opened its only public high school, [[Palau High School]] in [[Koror City]], which is {{convert|300|km|mi}} across the water from Sonsorol; children from Sonsorol state make arrangements to live in Koror City if they choose to continue their grade school education.<ref>{{cite web |title=Palau High School |url=http://www.palaumoe.net/phs/ |date=2016 |url-status=dead |work=Ministry of Education, Republic of Palau |location=[[Koror City]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181124210822/http://www.palaumoe.net/phs/ |archivedate=2018-11-24 |access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sonsorol.com/ Sonsorol Island]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023108/http://www.sonsorol.com/history/index_eng.htm Municipalities with Chiefs mentioned]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311045822/http://www.satelliteviews.net/cgi-bin/w.cgi?c=ps&UF=-3738292&UN=-5116154&DG=ADMD Satellite views]\n*[http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/websites/pollux/pollux.nss.nima.mil/NAV_PUBS/SD/pub126/126sec10.pdf Sailing Directions]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060913105005/http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/duffy/arb/260-272/267.pdf Atoll Research Bulletin 267]\n*[http://palauconsulate.org.uk/ Honorary Consulate of the Republic of Palau to the UK &NI]\n\n{{States of Palau}}\n\n[[Category:States of Palau]]\n[[Category:Islands of Palau]]\n[[Category:Sonsorol| ]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonsorol"}

The town was given a charter as a town in 1263 in a document mentioning \"terrum Zomothor.\" The current Hungarian name of Szomotor was adopted in the late 1800s and even after the partitioning of Hungary, leaving Szomotor now in the new country of Czechoslovakia. The name remained Szomotor until 1927 when the Czech government changed it to Somotor to conform with Czech and Slovak spelling.\n[Historical records state that] Slavic linguists say that the name of the town comes from the word \"cmotr\" (to look) however when the town was founded there was no evidence of Slavic inhabitants.

The town was given a charter as a town in 1263 in a document mentioning \"terrum Zomothor.\" The current Hungarian name of Szomotor was adopted in the late 1800s and even after the partitioning of Hungary, leaving Szomotor now in the new country of Czechoslovakia. The name remained Szomotor until 1927 when the Czech government changed it to Somotor to conform with Czech and Slovak spelling.\n[Historical records state that] Slavic linguists say that the name of the town comes from the word \"cmotr\" (to look) however when the town was founded there was no evidence of Slavic inhabitants.
