Because of the pejorative nature of the word, the identification of particular examples are usually subject to political dispute and different [[definitions of terrorism]].\n\n==Definition==\nOne possible definition is the US [[State Sponsors of Terrorism (U.S. list)|State Department's List of  State Sponsors of Terrorism]].<ref name=grant>{{Cite web |last=Grant |first=John P. |title=Lockerbie Trial |accessdate=2018-07-10 |url=http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e60|doi=10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e60 |doi-broken-date=2020-01-08 }}</ref> The US State Department designation is authorized by three laws: the [[Export Administration Act of 1979]], the [[Arms Export Control Act]], and the [[Foreign Assistance Act]]. {{As of|July 2018}} there are four countries on this list: [[North Korea]], [[Iran]], [[Sudan]] and [[Syria]]. According to the State Department there are four types of sanctions imposed on countries who are designated state-sponsors of terrorism under these statutes: restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance, a ban on defense exports and sales, certain controls over exports of dual use items; and miscellaneous financial and other restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web |title=State Sponsors of Terrorism |accessdate=2018-07-10 |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/ct/list/c14151.htm}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe use of terrorist organizations as proxies in armed conflicts between state actors became more attractive in the mid-20th century as a result of post [[World War II]] developments  like the increasing costs of traditional warfare and the risk of [[nuhhhhhclear war]]. Speaking about the effect of nuclear capability on traditional military conflict [[KGB]] agent Alexander Sakharovsky said that \"In today's world, when nuclear arms have made military force obsolete, terrorism should become our main weapon.\" Though state-sponsored terrorism persists in the post-9/11 era, some scholars have argued that it has become less significant in the age of global jihadism. On the other hand, [[Daniel Byman]] believes its importance has increased. Organizations like [[Hamas]], [[Hezbollah]] and [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]] are heavily dependent on state support. According to the US Counter-Terrorism Coordinator's Office this support can include \"funds, weapons, materials and the secure areas\" that organizations use for \"planning and conducting operations\".<ref name=ganor>{{Cite book |publisher=Columbia University Press |last=Boaz Ganor |title=Global Alert: The Rationality of Modern Islamist Terrorism and the Challenge to the Liberal Democratic World |journal=Global Alert |pages=64\u201372 |chapter=State Involvement in Terrorism |date=2015 |jstor=10.7312/gano17212.8 |doi=10.7312/gano17212 |isbn=9780231538916 }}</ref>\n\nThe ''Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law'' notes that international legal institutions currently lack a mechanism to prosecute terrorist leaders who \"instruct, support or succour\" terrorism. At the conclusion of the [[Lockerbie trial]], some commentators continued to harbor doubts about the legitimacy of the only conviction secured during the trial, and thus also about [[Libya]]{{'}}s involvement. The domestic trial proved to be insufficient to identify those who had given the instructions.<ref name=grant />\n\n==Types of support==\n===Ideological support===\nIdeological support is when a terrorist organization is used to spread a state's ideology. Examples of countries who have used this tactic include the Soviet Union and Iran; terrorist organizations founded by these two countries helped spread their respective revolutionary ideologies of communism and Islamic fundamentalism in different countries. {{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} Hezbollah is one such organization. [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]], on the other hand, courted Iran's sponsorship by adopting their ideology in exchange for material aid. These organizations receive some form of indoctrination from the sponsor state, whether it be political, religious, or ideological.<ref name=ganor />\n\n==By country==\n===Afghanistan===\nAfghanistan's [[KHAD]] is one of four secret service agencies accused of terrorist bombing in Pakistan North-west during the early 1980s;<ref name=\"autogenerated1987\">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963894-2,00.html|work=Time|title=Pakistan Knocking at the Nuclear Door|date=March 30, 1987|accessdate=May 24, 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109171126/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963894-2,00.html|archivedate=January 9, 2011}}</ref> then by late 1980s U.S state department blamed WAD (a [[KGB]] created Afghan secret intelligence agency) for terrorist bombing Pakistani cities.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/23/opinion/how-zia-s-death-helped-the-us.html?pagewanted=1|work=The New York Times|title=How Zia's Death Helped the U.S|first1=Robert D.|last1=Kaplan|date=August 23, 1989|accessdate=May 24, 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109155701/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/23/opinion/how-zia-s-death-helped-the-us.html?pagewanted=1|archivedate=January 9, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/25/world/fbi-allowed-to-investigate-crash-that-killed-zia.html|work=The New York Times|title=F.B.I.

According to the State Department there are four types of sanctions imposed on countries who are designated state-sponsors of terrorism under these statutes: restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance, a ban on defense exports and sales, certain controls over exports of dual use items; and miscellaneous financial and other restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web |title=State Sponsors of Terrorism |accessdate=2018-07-10 |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/ct/list/c14151.htm}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe use of terrorist organizations as proxies in armed conflicts between state actors became more attractive in the mid-20th century as a result of post [[World War II]] developments  like the increasing costs of traditional warfare and the risk of [[nuclear war]]. Speaking about the effect of nuclear capability on traditional military conflict [[KGB]] agent Alexander Sakharovsky said that \"In today's world, when nuclear arms have made military force obsolete, terrorism should become our main weapon.\" Though state-sponsored terrorism persists in the post-9/11 era, some scholars have argued that it has become less significant in the age of global jihadism. On the other hand, [[Daniel Byman]] believes its importance has increased. Organizations like [[Hamas]], [[Hezbollah]] and [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]] are heavily dependent on state support. According to the US Counter-Terrorism Coordinator's Office this support can include \"funds, weapons, materials and the secure areas\" that organizations use for \"planning and conducting operations\".<ref name=ganor>{{Cite book |publisher=Columbia University Press |last=Boaz Ganor |title=Global Alert: The Rationality of Modern Islamist Terrorism and the Challenge to the Liberal Democratic World |journal=Global Alert |pages=64\u201372 |chapter=State Involvement in Terrorism |date=2015 |jstor=10.7312/gano17212.8 |doi=10.7312/gano17212 |isbn=9780231538916 }}</ref>\n\nThe ''Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law'' notes that international legal institutions currently lack a mechanism to prosecute terrorist leaders who \"instruct, support or succour\" terrorism. At the conclusion of the [[Lockerbie trial]], some commentators continued to harbor doubts about the legitimacy of the only conviction secured during the trial, and thus also about [[Libya]]{{'}}s involvement.

[[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]], on the other hand, courted Iran's sponsorship by adopting their ideology in exchange for material aid.

If the attacking team successfully protects the Spike and it detonates, they get a point. If the defending team successfully defuses the Spike, or the 100-second round timer expires, the defending team gets a point. If the attackers eliminate all defending team members they earn a point. After twelve rounds, each the attacking team switches to the defending team and vice versa. The first team to win the best of 24 rounds wins the match.<ref name=\"Goslin 2020b\" /><ref name=\"Shea 2020\" /><ref name=\"First Announced 1\" />\n\nThere are currently ten known agents in ''Valorant''.

[[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[first-person shooter]] developed and published by [[Riot Games]]. The game was first announced with the codename ''Project A'' in October 2019. It is set to be released for [[Microsoft Windows]]  in the summer of 2020, with a [[closed beta]] that launched on April 7, 2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Valorant'' is a team-based [[tactical shooter]] and [[first-person shooter]]  set in the near-future.<ref name=\"Goslin 2020a\" /><ref name=\"Goslin 2020b\" /><ref name=\"Goslin 2020c\" /><ref name=\"First Announced 1\" /> Players assume the control of \"agents\", characters who come from a plethora of countries and cultures around the world.<ref name=\"First Announced 1\" /> In the main game mode, players join either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. \"Agents\" have unique abilities and use an economic system to purchase their abilities and weapons. The game has an assortment of weapons including  [[Sidearm (weapon)|sidearms]], [[submachine guns]], [[shotguns]], [[machine guns]], [[assault rifles]], [[sniper rifles]].<ref name=\"Geddes 2020\" /><ref name=\"Toms 2020\" /> Each weapon has a [[Recoil|recoil pattern]] which has to be controlled by the player in order to be able to shoot accurately.<ref name=\"Geddes 2020\" /><ref name=\"Toms 2020\" /> The attacking team has a bomb, called the Spike, that they need to plant on a site. If the attacking team successfully protects the Spike and it detonates, they get a point. If the defending team successfully defuses the Spike, or the 100-second round timer expires, the defending team gets a point. If the attackers eliminate all defending team members they earn a point. After twelve rounds, each the attacking team switches to the defending team and vice versa. The first team to win the best of 24 rounds wins the match.<ref name=\"Goslin 2020b\" /><ref name=\"Shea 2020\" /><ref name=\"First Announced 1\" />\n\nThere are currently ten known agents in ''Valorant''. Agents each have special abilities, that are either bought before rounds or earned throughout elimination in the game.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Valorant_logo.svg|thumb|300x300px|The logo for

During the period from 1924&ndash;1929, Travel Air produced more aircraft than any other American manufacturer, including over 1,000 biplanes. While an exact number is almost impossible to ascertain due to the number of conversions and rebuilds, some estimates for Travel Air as a whole range from 1,200 to nearly 2,000 aircraft.\n<ref name=Prairie>Phillips, 1982, pp.?</ref><ref name=wichita_4>Bissionette, 1999, pp.?</ref><ref name=WichitaFokker>Wilkinson, 28 February 2014, pp.?</ref><ref name=Stars>Cooper, 2008, pp.?</ref>\n\n==Design and development==\n===Design and development===\nThe Travel Air Model A was engineered chiefly by [[Lloyd Stearman]], with input from Travel Air co-founders [[Walter Beech]], [[Clyde Cessna]], and [[Bill Snook]] and could trace its ancestry back to the [[Swallow New Swallow]] biplane, with the primary difference being the replacement of the wooden [[fuselage]] structure on the New Swallow being replaced with welded steel tube. \nAn interim design, the [[Winstead Special]] was developed by the Winstead brothers from a metal fuselage frame developed at Swallow by Stearman and [[Walter Beech]], but subsequently rejected by Swallow president [[Jake Moellendick]], a decision which triggered the departure of both Stearman and Beech, and the creation of Travel Air.<ref name=Prairie/><ref name=wichita_4/> Until the appearance of the all new [[Curtiss-Wright CW-12|12/14/16 series]], all subsequent Travel Air biplanes would be derived from the Model A.<ref name=Prairie/><ref name=wichita_4/> \n\nThe Travel Air biplanes were conventional [[Biplane#Bays|single-bay biplanes]] with [[Stagger (aeronautics)|staggered wings]] braced by N-struts. The fuselage was [[Aircraft fabric covering|fabric-covered]] [[welded]] [[41xx steel|chromium-molybdenum alloy steel]] tubes, faired with wooden battens and they had two open cockpits in [[tandem]], with the forward cockpit carrying two passengers side-by-side.\n\nIn common with the [[Fokker D.VII]] that they resembled, the rudder and ailerons of the first Travel Air biplanes had an overhanging \"horns\" to counterbalance the aerodynamic loads on the controls, helping to reduce control forces and making for a more responsive aircraft. These were the distinctive Travel Air \"elephant ear\" ailerons which lead to the airplane's popular nicknames of '''Old Elephant Ears''' and '''Wichita Fokker.''' Some subsequent models were offered without the counterbalance, providing a cleaner, more conventional appearance with less drag. Pitch forces could be trimmed out with an inflight-adjustable horizontal stabilizer.<ref name=Prairie/><ref name=wichita_4/><ref name=WichitaFokker/>\n\nDifferent, interchangeable wings were offered, including a shorter and thinner wing known as the \"Speedwing\" which improved speed. \n\nA considerable number of engines were installed, including nearly every mass produced engine in the {{cvt|90-300|hp}} range available at the time, and a number of more obscure prototype engines, as can be seen in the list of designation prefixes.\n\nTravel Air entered the specially-modified Model '''4000-T''' in the [[Guggenheim Safe Aircraft Competition]] of 1930, but it was disqualified, as were all production aircraft entered during the qualification trials. The Travel Air biplanes were noted for their good flying qualities which may have helped Travel Air outsell all rivals by 1929.<ref name=wichita_4/>\n\n===Steam-powered===\nIn 1933, [[Doble steam car#Besler Brothers|George and William Besler]] replaced the  usual gasoline powered piston engine in a Travel Air 2000 with an oil-fired, reversible V-twin [[Compound steam engine#Compounding engines|compounding steam engine]], which would become the first airplane to successfully fly using a [[Steam aircraft|steam engine]].<ref name=Steam>Fitzgerald, 1933, pp.9-11</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\nIn addition to a wide range of normal aircraft applications, the Travel Air biplanes saw extensive use in early motion pictures, where they often stood in for the increasingly scarce [[Fokker D.VII]].\n\nAside from surplus military aircraft such as the [[Curtiss JN-4 Jenny]], during the late 1920s and very early 1930s, Travel Air biplanes were, along with their chief competitor, [[Waco Aircraft Company|WACO]], were the most widely used civilian biplanes in America.<ref name=Prairie/><ref name=wichita_4/>\n\nTravel Air biplanes were popular as executive transports, and many were purchased by wealthy-sportsmen adventurers who entered them in the competitions and [[air racing|air races]] that were frequently held during that era.<ref name=Prairie/>ref name=wichita_4/> Like many aircraft of the period, they also operated as [[air taxi]]s and provided [[air charter]] services, carrying passengers and light [[air cargo]], and some would find their way north where they worked as [[bush flying|bushplanes]].<ref name=Prairie/><ref name=wichita_4/>\nAs the supply of war-surplus aircraft declined and they became available on the used aircraft market, many were also used for [[barnstorming]], which included exhibition and stunt flying, and selling rides. <ref name=Prairie/><ref name=wichita_4/>\nCommercial operators found the Travel Air biplanes to be versatile, owing to their useful payload, rugged construction and (for the times) speed and efficiency.<ref name=Prairie/>\n\nTowards the end of their career elsewhere, from the late-1930s through the early 1960s, they were increasingly used for the harsh work of bush flying and [[cropdusting]], and Travel Air biplanes were among the most commonly used cropdusters, perhaps second only to surplus [[Stearman Kaydet]] biplanes.<ref name=Prairie/><ref name=Stars/>\n\nMost remaining Travel Air biplanes have been restored, and are in museums, while a small number continue to be used for personal recreation or selling rides and flying at [[airshow]]s.<ref name=Prairie/><ref name=WichitaFokker/><ref name=\"travel_air_restorers_whats_new\">[http://www.travelair.org/html/whats_new/whats_new_frame.html \"What's New,\"] page, [[Travel Air Restorers Association]] website, retrieved January 28, 2017</ref>\n\nAs the 2000/3000/4000 series was nearing the end of its development cycle, a pair of new designs, the [[Curtiss-Wright CW-12|Travel Air 12]] and [[Curtiss-Wright CW-14|14]] were developed to replace it - the 12 as a slightly smaller two-seat trainer, and the larger 14 as a direct replacement, even to continuing some of the marketing names. Both would fly while Travel Air retained its identity, but would be incorporated into the Curtiss-Wright line with the same numbers. \n\n===Movie Industry===\nTravel Air biplanes were widely used in 1920s/1930s war movies, particularly to represent the airplanes they were patterned after:  Germany's [[Fokker D-VII]] fighter, the top fighter of [[World War I]]. In the motion picture industry, they were known as \"Wichita Fokkers.\" In fact, Hollywood's demand for Travel Air biplanes was so intense that Travel Air's California salesman, [[Fred Hoyt]], coaxed Travel Air co-founder and principal airplane designer, [[Lloyd Stearman]], to come to [[Venice, California]] in 1926 to exploit the movie industry demand for his aircraft by starting the short-lived independent [[Stearman Aircraft Company]] (re-opened back in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] in 1927).<ref name=Prairie/><ref name=WichitaFokker/><ref name=Film>Harris, 2017</ref>\n\nSome of the many movies using Travel Air biplanes (2000 and 4000, in particular) included:<ref name=Film/><ref name=AerofilesFilms>{{cite web|last=Eckland|first=K.

Redesignated CW-4000\n\n===Numerical designation sequences===\nVariants were distinguished with prefixes and suffixes in a particular order, and denoting different fittings.\nThe prefix '''S''', preceding all other prefixes meant it was a '''Seaplane''' and was fitted with floats.\nNext it was wings. '''B''' was the '''Standard wing''', not to be confused with the original basic elephant ear wing, and '''D''' indicated the aircraft was fitted with a '''Speedwing'''.\nThe engine code followed this, and due to the long service period when considerable experimentation occurred, a wide variety of engines were installed in production airplane as follows:\n:*'''A''' - {{cvt|150|hp}} [[Axelson (company)|Axelson B engine]] 7-cylinder radial engine\n:*'''B''' - {{cvt|220|hp}} [[Wright J-5 Whirlwind]] 9-cylinder radial engine\n:*'''C''' - {{cvt|170-185|hp}} [[Curtiss Challenger]] 6-cylinder radial, or Curtiss C-6 inline engine\n:*'''D''' - {{cvt|150|hp}} [[Aeromarine B-90|Aeromarine B]] 6-cylinder inline engine\n:*'''E''' - {{cvt|165|hp}} [[Wright J-6-5 Whirlwind]] 5-cylinder radial engine\n:*'''J4''' - {{cvt|200|hp}} [[Wright J-4 Whirlwind]] 9-cylinder radial engine\n:*'''K''' - {{cvt|100|hp}} [[Kinner K-5]] 5-cylinder radial engine\n:*'''W''' - {{cvt|110|hp}} [[Warner Scarab]] 7-cylinder radial engine\n:*'''L''' - {{cvt|225|hp}} [[Lycoming R-680]] 9-cylinder radial engine\n:*'''V''' - {{cvt|180|hp}} [[Velie |Velie ML-9]] 9-cylinder radial engine\n:*'''W''' - {{cvt|125|hp}} [[Warner Scarab|Warner Scarab S-50]] radial 7-cylinder  engine\n:*'''9''' - {{cvt|300|hp}} [[Wright J-6-9 Whirlwind]] 9-cylinder radial engine\nFollowing the engine code in a very small number of cases, '''M''', indicated that it was a single seater configured as a '''Mailplane''', and then the model number. The same system was also used with the later numerical desigation sequence. The sole example of the mailplane seems to have been the BM-4000, a [[Wright J-5]] powered mailplane, of which 7 were built.

During the period from 1924&ndash;1929, Travel Air produced more aircraft than any other American manufacturer, including over 1,000 biplanes. While an exact number is almost impossible to ascertain due to the number of conversions and rebuilds, some estimates for Travel Air as a whole range from 1,200 to nearly 2,000 aircraft.\n<ref name=Prairie>Phillips, 1982, pp.?</ref><ref name=wichita_4>Bissionette, 1999, pp.?</ref><ref name=WichitaFokker>Wilkinson, 28 February 2014, pp.?</ref><ref name=Stars>Cooper, 2008, pp.?</ref>\n\n==Design and development==\n===Design and development===\nThe Travel Air Model A was engineered chiefly by [[Lloyd Stearman]], with input from Travel Air co-founders [[Walter Beech]], [[Clyde Cessna]], and [[Bill Snook]] and could trace its ancestry back to the [[Swallow New Swallow]] biplane, with the primary difference being the replacement of the wooden [[fuselage]] structure on the New Swallow being replaced with welded steel tube. \nAn interim design, the [[Winstead Special]] was developed by the Winstead brothers from a metal fuselage frame developed at Swallow by Stearman and [[Walter Beech]], but subsequently rejected by by Swallow president [[Jake Moellendick]], a decision which triggered the departure of both Stearman and Beech, and the creation of Travel Air.<ref name=Prairie/><ref name=wichita_4/> Until the appearance of the all new [[Curtiss-Wright CW-12|12/14/16 series]], all subsequent Travel Air biplanes would be derived from the Model A.<ref name=Prairie/><ref name=wichita_4/> \n\nThe Travel Air biplanes were conventional [[Biplane#Bays|single-bay biplanes]] with [[Stagger (aeronautics)|staggered wings]] braced by N-struts. The fuselage was [[Aircraft fabric covering|fabric-covered]] [[welded]] [[41xx steel|chromium-molybdenum alloy steel]] tubes, faired with wooden battens and they had two open cockpits in [[tandem]], with the forward cockpit carrying two passengers side-by-side.\n\nIn common with the [[Fokker D.VII]] that they resembled, the rudder and ailerons of the first Travel Air biplanes had an overhanging \"horns\" to counterbalance the aerodynamic loads on the controls, helping to reduce control forces and making for a more responsive aircraft. These were the distinctive Travel Air \"elephant ear\" ailerons which lead to the airplane's popular nicknames of '''Old Elephant Ears''' and '''Wichita Fokker.''' Some subsequent models were offered without the counterbalance, providing a cleaner, more conventional appearance with less drag. Pitch forces could be trimmed out with an inflight-adjustable horizontal stabilizer.<ref name=Prairie/><ref name=wichita_4/><ref name=WichitaFokker/>\n\nDifferent, interchangeable wings were offered, including a shorter and thinner wing known as the \"Speedwing\" which improved speed. \n\nA considerable number of engines were installed, including nearly every mass produced engine in the {{cvt|90-300|hp}} range available at the time, and a number of more obscure prototype engines, as can be seen in the list of designation prefixes.\n\nTravel Air entered the specially-modified Model '''4000-T''' in the [[Guggenheim Safe Aircraft Competition]] of 1930, but it was disqualified, as were all production aircraft entered during the qualification trials. The Travel Air biplanes were noted for their good flying qualities which may have helped Travel Air outsell all rivals by 1929.<ref name=wichita_4/>\n\n===Steam-powered===\nIn 1933, [[Doble steam car#Besler Brothers|George and William Besler]] replaced the  usual gasoline powered piston engine in a Travel Air 2000 with an oil-fired, reversible V-twin [[Compound steam engine#Compounding engines|compounding steam engine]], which would become the first airplane to successfully fly using a [[Steam aircraft|steam engine]].<ref name=Steam>Fitzgerald, 1933, pp.9-11</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\nIn addition to a wide range of normal aircraft applications, the Travel Air biplanes saw extensive use in early motion pictures, where they often stood in for the increasingly scarce [[Fokker D.VII]].\n\nAside from surplus military aircraft such as the [[Curtiss JN-4 Jenny]], during the late 1920s and very early 1930s, Travel Air biplanes were, along with their chief competitor, [[Waco Aircraft Company|WACO]], were the most widely used civilian biplanes in America.<ref name=Prairie/><ref name=wichita_4/>\n\nTravel Air biplanes were popular as executive transports, and many were purchased by wealthy-sportsmen adventurers who entered them in the competitions and [[air racing|air races]] that were frequently held during that era.<ref name=Prairie/>ref name=wichita_4/> Like many aircraft of the period, they also operated as [[air taxi]]s and provided [[air charter]] services, carrying passengers and light [[air cargo]], and some would find their way north where they worked as [[bush flying|bushplanes]].<ref name=Prairie/><ref name=wichita_4/>\nAs the supply of war-surplus aircraft declined and they became available on the used aircraft market, many were also used for [[barnstorming]], which included exhibition and stunt flying, and selling rides. <ref name=Prairie/><ref name=wichita_4/>\nCommercial operators found the Travel Air biplanes to be versatile, owing to their useful payload, rugged construction and (for the times) speed and efficiency.<ref name=Prairie/>\n\nTowards the end of their career elsewhere, from the late-1930s through the early 1960s, they were increasingly used for the harsh work of bush flying and [[cropdusting]], and Travel Air biplanes were among the most commonly used cropdusters, perhaps second only to surplus [[Stearman Kaydet]] biplanes.<ref name=Prairie/><ref name=Stars/>\n\nMost remaining Travel Air biplanes have been restored, and are in museums, while a small number continue to be used for personal recreation or selling rides and flying at [[airshow]]s.<ref name=Prairie/><ref name=WichitaFokker/><ref name=\"travel_air_restorers_whats_new\">[http://www.travelair.org/html/whats_new/whats_new_frame.html \"What's New,\"] page, [[Travel Air Restorers Association]] website, retrieved January 28, 2017</ref>\n\nAs the 2000/3000/4000 series was nearing the end of its development cycle, a pair of new designs, the [[Curtiss-Wright CW-12|Travel Air 12]] and [[Curtiss-Wright CW-14|14]] were developed to replace it - the 12 as a slightly smaller two-seat trainer, and the larger 14 as a direct replacement, even to continuing some of the marketing names. Both would fly while Travel Air retained its identity, but would be incorporated into the Curtiss-Wright line with the same numbers. \n\n===Movie Industry===\nTravel Air biplanes were widely used in 1920s/1930s war movies, particularly to represent the airplanes they were patterned after:  Germany's [[Fokker D-VII]] fighter, the top fighter of [[World War I]]. In the motion picture industry, they were known as \"Wichita Fokkers.\" In fact, Hollywood's demand for Travel Air biplanes was so intense that Travel Air's California salesman, [[Fred Hoyt]], coaxed Travel Air co-founder and principal airplane designer, [[Lloyd Stearman]], to come to [[Venice, California]] in 1926 to exploit the movie industry demand for his aircraft by starting the short-lived independent [[Stearman Aircraft Company]] (re-opened back in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] in 1927).<ref name=Prairie/><ref name=WichitaFokker/><ref name=Film>Harris, 2017</ref>\n\nSome of the many movies using Travel Air biplanes (2000 and 4000, in particular) included:<ref name=Film/><ref name=AerofilesFilms>{{cite web|last=Eckland|first=K.

Redesignated as 3000.\n:;Model BW:1926 Model B with a {{cvt|200|hp}} [[Wright J-4]] 9-cylinder [[radial engine]]. Redesignated CW-4000\n\n===Numerical designation sequences===\nVariants were distinguished with prefixes and suffixes in a particular order, and denoting different fittings.\nThe prefix '''S''', preceding all other prefixes meant it was a '''Seaplane''' and was fitted with floats.\nNext it was wings. '''B''' was the '''Standard wing''', not to be confused with the original basic elephant ear wing, and '''D''' indicated the aircraft was fitted with a '''Speedwing'''.\nThe engine code followed this, and due to the long service period when considerable experimentation occurred, a wide variety of engines were installed in production airplane as follows:\n:*'''A''' - {{cvt|150|hp}} [[Axelson (company)|Axelson B engine]] 7-cylinder radial engine\n:*'''B''' - {{cvt|220|hp}} [[Wright J-5 Whirlwind]] 9-cylinder radial engine\n:*'''C''' - {{cvt|170-185|hp}} [[Curtiss Challenger]] 6-cylinder radial, or Curtiss C-6 inline engine\n:*'''D''' - {{cvt|150|hp}} [[Aeromarine B-90|Aeromarine B]] 6-cylinder inline engine\n:*'''E''' - {{cvt|165|hp}} [[Wright J-6-5 Whirlwind]] 5-cylinder radial engine\n:*'''J4''' - {{cvt|200|hp}} [[Wright J-4 Whirlwind]] 9-cylinder radial engine\n:*'''K''' - {{cvt|100|hp}} [[Kinner K-5]] 5-cylinder radial engine\n:*'''W''' - {{cvt|110|hp}} [[Warner Scarab]] 7-cylinder radial engine\n:*'''L''' - {{cvt|225|hp}} [[Lycoming R-680]] 9-cylinder radial engine\n:*'''V''' - {{cvt|180|hp}} [[Velie |Velie ML-9]] 9-cylinder radial engine\n:*'''W''' - {{cvt|125|hp}} [[Warner Scarab|Warner Scarab S-50]] radial 7-cylinder  engine\n:*'''9''' - {{cvt|300|hp}} [[Wright J-6-9 Whirlwind]] 9-cylinder radial engine\nFollowing the engine code in a very small number of cases, '''M''', indicated that it was a single seater configured as a '''Mailplane''', and then the model number. The same system was also used with the later numerical desigation sequence. The sole example of the mailplane seems to have been the BM-4000, a [[Wright J-5]] powered mailplane, of which 7 were built. Not all possible variations were built.\nSuffixes were also added that were specific to modifications made and often referred to conversions or post-production versions.\n\n====1000 series Designations====\n:;1000:Formerly Model A with {{cvt|90|hp}} [[Curtiss OX-5]] [[Water-cooled engine|water-cooled]] [[V-8 engine]]\n:;2000:Formerly Model B with {{cvt|90|hp}} Curtiss OX-5 engine\n:::C-2000 -
