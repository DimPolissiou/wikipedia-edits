Attempting to compete with established Canadian brands like [[Woolco]] and [[Zeller's]] during a downturn in the market, it was T. Eaton's attempt to court \"buyers\", as opposed to \"shoppers\" at its Eaton's stores. Instead, the chain was generally unprofitable, cannibalizing sales from its sister stores, and misplaced, according to analysts. Intended to be a 122-store chain, it only reached 18 locations.

The barn is made from wood sourced from the Gorge. The frame is made from oak, ash and elm whilst the roof is covered with chestnut shingles and the wall panels are woven hazel and sweet chestnut.

A heated main runs the length of the site heating all four main buildings. The boiler is situated in a boiler house attached to the Cruck Barn. The boiler burns around one wheelbarrow's worth of logs a day during early spring and autumn but the load varies between summer and winter.\n\nHot water passes through the burn chamber and is stored in a buffer tank in the Cruck Barn. The well-insulated water can stay hot for a week. The water travels along the pipes to the buildings where the thermostatic controls have been switched on. The logs are sourced from local coppiced woods that are currently being restored by Small Woods volunteers.\n\nThe system was installed in December 2005 and since then has not only reduced considerably the amount of electricity used on site but also has helped the restoration of local woodlands and improved conditions for biodiversity and timber production.

Childbirth is divided into four stages. \n \n:'''First stage of labor''' The first stage of labour involves the opening of the cervix.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thewomens.org.au/health-information/pregnancy-and-birth/labour-birth/stages-of-labour/|title=Stages of Labour|last=|first=|date=|website=The women's: The Royal Women's Hospital|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2016}}</ref> In the early parts of this stage the cervix will become soft and thin thus preparing for the delivery of the baby.<ref name=\":0\" /> The first stage of labour is complete when the cervix has dilated the full 10cm.<ref name=\":0\" /> During the first stage of labor the mother begins to feel strong and regular contractions that come every 5 to 20 minutes and last 30 to 60 seconds.  Contractions gradually become stronger, more frequent, and longer lasting.\n\n:'''Second stage of labor''' During the second stage the baby begins to move down the birth canal.  As the baby moves to the opening of the vagina it \"crowns\", meaning the top of the head can be seen at the vaginal entrance. At one time an \"episiotomy\", (an incision in the tissue at the opening of the vagina) was done routinely because it was believed that it prevented excessive tearing and healed more readily than a natural tear.<ref name=\"Mayo Clinic\" />   However, more recent research shows that a surgical incision may be more extensive than a natural tear, and is more likely to contribute to later incontinence and pain during sex than a natural tear would have.<ref name=\"Mayo Clinic\">{{cite web | url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/episiotomy/ART-20047282?p=1 | title=Labor and delivery, postpartum care | publisher=Mayo Clinic | date=30 July 2015 | accessdate=15 August 2015 | author=Mayo Clinic staff}}</ref>\n\n:The [[midwife]] assists the baby as needed and when fully emerged, cuts the umbilical cord.

The [[midwife]] also monitors the baby's pulse rate, palpates the mother's abdomen to monitor the baby's position, and does vaginal checks as needed.  If the birth deviates from the norm at any stage, the [[midwife]] requests assist from a more highly trained health care provider.\n\n==== Birthing positions ====\n{{Main|Childbirth positions}}\n\nUntil the last century most women have used both the upright position and alternative positions to give birth.  The [[lithotomy position]] was not used until the advent of forceps in the seventeenth century and since then childbirth has progressively moved from a woman supported experience in the home to a medical intervention within the hospital.\nThere are significant advantages to assuming an upright position in labor and birth, such as stronger and more efficient uterine contractions aiding cervical dilatation, increased pelvic inlet and outlet diameters and improved uterine contractility.<ref name=\"Factors influencing maternal positions during labor\">{{cite web | url=http://www.instituteofmidwifery.org/MSFinalProj.nsf/a9ee58d7a82396768525684f0056be8d/45f9de25c6ca395e85257715003dad3f?OpenDocument | title=Factors influencing maternal positions during labor | date=April 2010 | accessdate=10 August 2015 | author=Searle, Lorraine | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222212343/http://www.instituteofmidwifery.org/MSFinalProj.nsf/a9ee58d7a82396768525684f0056be8d/45f9de25c6ca395e85257715003dad3f?OpenDocument | archive-date=22 February 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>  Upright positions in the second stage include sitting, squatting, kneeling, and being on hands and knees.<ref name=\"Gelis122-134\">Gelis, Jacues. History of Childbirth. Boston: Northern University Press, 1991: 122-134</ref>\n\n===Postpartum period===\n{{Main|Postpartum period}}\n\nFor women who have a hospital birth, the minimum hospital stay is six hours. Women who leave before this do so against medical advice. Women may choose when to leave the hospital. Full postnatal assessments are conducted daily whilst inpatient, or more frequently if needed. A postnatal assessment includes the woman's observations, general well being, breasts (either a discussion and assistance with breastfeeding or a discussion about lactation suppression), abdominal palpation (if she has not had a caesarean section) to check for involution of the uterus, or a check of her caesarean wound (the dressing doesn't need to be removed for this), a check of her perineum, particularly if she tore or had stitches, reviewing her lochia, ensuring she has passed urine and had her bowels open and checking for signs and symptoms of a DVT. The baby is also checked for jaundice, signs of adequate feeding, or other concerns. The baby has a nursery exam between six and seventy two hours of birth to check for conditions such as heart defects, hip problems, or eye problems.\n\nIn the community, the community midwife sees the woman at least until day ten. This does not mean she sees the woman and baby daily, but she cannot discharge them from her care until day ten at the earliest. Postnatal checks include neonatal screening test (NST, or heel prick test) around day five. The baby is weighed and the [[midwife]] plans visits according to the health and needs of mother and baby. They are discharged to the care of the health visitor.\n\n===Care of the newborn===\n{{Further|Newborn}}\n\nAt birth, the baby receives an [[Apgar score]] at, at the least, one minute and five minutes of age. This is a score out of 10 that assesses the baby on five different areas\u2014each worth between 0 and 2 points. These areas are: colour, respiratory effort, tone, heart rate, and response to stimuli. The [[midwife]] checks the baby for any obvious problems, weighs the baby, and measure head circumference. The [[midwife]] ensures the cord has been clamped securely and the baby has the appropriate name tags on (if in hospital). Babies lengths are not routinely measured. The [[midwife]] performs these checks as close to the mother as possible and returns the baby to the mother quickly. Skin-to-skin is encouraged, as this regulates the baby's heart rate, breathing, oxygen saturation, and temperature\u2014and promotes bonding and breastfeeding.\n\nIn some countries, such as Chile, the midwife is the professional who can direct neonatal intensive care units. This is an advantage for these professionals, because this professionals can use the knowledge in perinatology to bring a high quality care of the newborn, with medical or surgical conditions.\n\n==Midwifery-led continuity of care==\n[[File:Australian Clinical Midwifery Facilitator Florence West teaches training midwives at the Pacific Adventist University PAU, outskirts of Port Moresby, PNG.

Five columns of this papyrus deal with [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrics and gynecology]], especially concerning the acceleration of parturition (the action or process of giving birth to offspring) and the birth prognosis of the newborn. The [[Westcar Papyrus|Westcar papyrus]], dated to 1700 BCE, includes instructions for calculating the expected date of confinement and describes different styles of birth chairs. Bas reliefs in the royal birth rooms at Luxor and other temples also attest to the heavy presence of midwifery in this culture.<ref name=\"TowlerBramall-9\">Jean Towler and Joan Bramall, ''Midwives in History and Society'' (London: Croom Helm, 1986), p. 9</ref>\n\nMidwifery in [[Greco-Roman]] antiquity covered a wide range of women, including old women who continued folk medical traditions in the villages of the [[Roman Empire]], trained midwives who garnered their knowledge from a variety of sources, and highly trained women who were considered physicians.<ref name=\"Flemming-359\">Rebecca Flemming, ''Medicine and the Making of Roman Women'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2000), p. 359</ref> However, there were certain characteristics desired in a \u201cgood\u201d [[midwife]], as described by the physician [[Soranus of Ephesus]] in the 2nd century. He states in his work, ''Gynecology'', that \u201ca suitable person will be literate, with her wits about her, possessed of a good memory, loving work, respectable and generally not unduly handicapped as regards her senses [i.e., sight, smell, hearing], sound of limb, robust, and, according to some people, endowed with long slim fingers and short nails at her fingertips.\u201d Soranus also recommends that the [[midwife]] be of sympathetic disposition (although she need not have borne a child herself) and that she keep her hands soft for the comfort of both mother and child.<ref name=\"French-69-84\">Valerie French, \"Midwives and Maternity Care in the Roman World\" (Helios, New Series 12(2), 1986), pp. 69-84</ref> [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], another physician from this time, valued nobility and a quiet and inconspicuous disposition in a [[midwife]].<ref name=\"Jackson-97\">Ralph Jackson, ''Doctors and Diseases in the Roman Empire'' (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1988), p. 97</ref>  There appears to have been three \u201cgrades\u201d of midwives present:   The first was technically proficient; the second may have read some of the texts on obstetrics and gynecology; but the third was highly trained and reasonably considered a [[medical specialist]] with a concentration in midwifery.<ref name=\"Jackson-97\" />\n\n[[Agnodice]] or Agnodike (Gr. \u1f08\u03b3\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b7) was the earliest historical, and likely apocryphal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/artifacts/antiqua/women.cfm |title=Women in Medicine |publisher=www.hsl.virginia.edu |accessdate=2012-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403130301/http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/artifacts/antiqua/women.cfm |archive-date=2013-04-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[midwife]] mentioned among the ancient Greeks.<ref>{{Cite book  | last = Greenhill  | first = William Alexander  | author-link =   | contribution = Agnodice  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology  | volume = 1  | page = 74  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0083.html  | postscript = <!--None--> | title-link = Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology }}</ref>\n\nMidwives were known by many different titles in antiquity, ranging from ''iatrin\u0113'' (Gr. [[nurse]]), ''maia'' (Gr., midwife), ''obstetrix'' (Lat., [[obstetrician]]), and ''medica'' (Lat., [[physician|doctor]]).<ref name=\"Flemming-421-424\">Rebecca Flemming, Medicine and the Making of Roman Women (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 421-424</ref> It appears as though midwifery was treated differently in the Eastern end of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean basin]] as opposed to the West. In the East, some women advanced beyond the profession of [[midwife]] (''maia'') to that of gynaecologist (''iatros gynaikeios'', translated as ''women's doctor''), for which formal training was required. Also, there were some gynecological tracts circulating in the medical and educated circles of the East that were written by women with Greek names, although these women were few in number. Based on these facts, it would appear that midwifery in the East was a respectable profession in which respectable women could earn their livelihoods and enough esteem to publish works read and cited by male physicians. In fact, a number of Roman legal provisions strongly suggest that midwives enjoyed status and remuneration comparable to that of male doctors.<ref name=\"French-69-84\" /> One example of such a [[midwife]] is [[Salpe|Salpe of Lemnos]], who wrote on women's diseases and was mentioned several times in the works of Pliny.<ref name=\"Jackson-97\" />\n\n[[File:Ancient Roman relief carving of a midwife Wellcome M0003964.jpg|thumb|Ancient Roman relief carving of a [[midwife]]]]\n\nHowever, in the Roman West, information about practicing midwives comes mainly from funerary epitaphs. Two hypotheses are suggested by looking at a small sample of these epitaphs. The first is the midwifery was not a profession to which freeborn women of families that had enjoyed free status of several generations were attracted; therefore it seems that most midwives were of servile origin. Second, since most of these funeral epitaphs describe the women as freed, it can be proposed that midwives were generally valued enough, and earned enough income, to be able to gain their freedom. It is not known from these epitaphs how certain slave women were selected for training as midwives. [[Slave]] girls may have been apprenticed, and it is most likely that mothers taught their daughters.<ref name=\"French-69-84\" />\n\nThe actual duties of the [[midwife]] in antiquity consisted mainly of assisting in the birthing process, although they may also have helped with other medical problems relating to women when needed. Often, the [[midwife]] would call for the assistance of a [[physician]] when a more difficult birth was anticipated. In many cases the [[midwife]] brought along two or three assistants.<ref name=\"Towler-Bramall-12\">Towler and Bramall, p.12</ref> In antiquity, it was believed by both midwives and physicians that a normal delivery was made easier when a woman sat upright. Therefore, during parturition, midwives brought a stool to the home where the delivery was to take place. In the seat of the birthstool was a crescent-shaped hole through which the baby would be delivered. The birthstool or chair often had armrests for the mother to grasp during the delivery. Most birthstools or chairs had backs which the patient could press against, but Soranus suggests that in some cases the chairs were backless and an assistant would stand behind the mother to support her.<ref name=\"French-69-84\" /> The [[midwife]] sat facing the mother, encouraging and supporting her through the birth, perhaps offering instruction on breathing and pushing, sometimes massaging her vaginal opening, and supporting her perineum during the delivery of the baby. The assistants may have helped by pushing downwards on the top of the mother's abdomen.\n\nFinally, the [[midwife]] received the infant, placed it in pieces of cloth, cut the [[umbilical cord]], and cleansed the baby.<ref name=\"Jackson-97\" /> The child was sprinkled with \u201cfine and powdery salt, or natron or aphronitre\u201d to soak up the birth residue, rinsed, and then powdered and rinsed again. Next, the midwives cleared away any and all mucus present from the nose, mouth, ears, or anus. Midwives were encouraged by Soranus to put [[olive oil]] in the baby's eyes to cleanse away any birth residue, and to place a piece of wool soaked in olive oil over the umbilical cord. After the delivery, the [[midwife]] made the initial call on whether or not an infant was healthy and fit to rear. She inspected the newborn for [[Congenital disorder|congenital deformities]] and testing its cry to hear whether or not it was robust and hearty. Ultimately, midwives made a determination about the chances for an infant's survival and likely recommended that a newborn with any severe deformities be exposed.<ref name=\"French-69-84\" />\n\nA 2nd-century terracotta relief from the Ostian tomb of Scribonia Attice, wife of physician-surgeon M. Ulpius Amerimnus, details a childbirth scene. Scribonia was a [[midwife]] and the relief shows her in the midst of a delivery. A patient sits in the birth chair, gripping the handles and the [[midwife]]\u2019s assistant stands behind her providing support.

However, at the beginning of the 21st century, the medical perception of pregnancy and childbirth as potentially pathological and dangerous still dominates Western culture. Midwives who work in hospital settings also have been influenced by this view, although by and large they are trained to view birth as a normal and healthy process. While midwives play a much larger role in the care of pregnant mothers in Europe than in America, the medicalized model of birth still has influence in those countries, even though the World Health Organization recommends a natural, normal and humanized birth.<ref name=\"Fortaleza declaration\">{{cite web|title= Fortaleza Declaration: Appropriate Use of Technology for Birth |url=http://www.weikert.de/alexandra/who1.html |publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=2015}}</ref>\n\nThe midwifery model of pregnancy and childbirth as a normal and healthy process plays a much larger role in Sweden and the Netherlands than the rest of Europe, however. Swedish midwives stand out, since they administer 80 percent of prenatal care and more than 80 percent of family planning services in Sweden. Midwives in Sweden attend all normal births in public hospitals and Swedish women tend to have fewer interventions in hospitals than American women. The Dutch infant mortality rate in 1992 was the tenth-lowest rate in the world, at 6.3 deaths per thousand births, while the United States ranked twenty-second.

Women who leave before this do so against medical advice. Women may choose when to leave the hospital. Full postnatal assessments are conducted daily whilst inpatient, or more frequently if needed. A postnatal assessment includes the woman's observations, general well being, breasts (either a discussion and assistance with breastfeeding or a discussion about lactation suppression), abdominal palpation (if she has not had a caesarean section) to check for involution of the uterus, or a check of her caesarean wound (the dressing doesn't need to be removed for this), a check of her perineum, particularly if she tore or had stitches, reviewing her lochia, ensuring she has passed urine and had her bowels open and checking for signs and symptoms of a DVT. The baby is also checked for jaundice, signs of adequate feeding, or other concerns. The baby has a nursery exam between six and seventy two hours of birth to check for conditions such as heart defects, hip problems, or eye problems.\n\nIn the community, the community midwife sees the woman at least until day ten. This does not mean she sees the woman and baby daily, but she cannot discharge them from her care until day ten at the earliest. Postnatal checks include neonatal screening test (NST, or heel prick test) around day five. The baby is weighed and the [[midwife]] plans visits according to the health and needs of mother and baby. They are discharged to the care of the health visitor.\n\n===Care of the newborn===\n{{Further|Newborn}}\n\nAt birth, the baby receives an [[Apgar score]] at, at the least, one minute and five minutes of age. This is a score out of 10 that assesses the baby on five different areas\u2014each worth between 0 and 2 points. These areas are: colour, respiratory effort, tone, heart rate, and response to stimuli. The [[midwife]] checks the baby for any obvious problems, weighs the baby, and measure head circumference. The [[midwife]] ensures the cord has been clamped securely and the baby has the appropriate name tags on (if in hospital). Babies lengths are not routinely measured. The [[midwife]] performs these checks as close to the mother as possible and returns the baby to the mother quickly. Skin-to-skin is encouraged, as this regulates the baby's heart rate, breathing, oxygen saturation, and temperature\u2014and promotes bonding and breastfeeding.\n\nIn some countries, such as Chile, the midwife is the professional who can direct neonatal intensive care units. This is an advantage for these professionals, because this professionals can use the knowledge in perinatology to bring a high quality care of the newborn, with medical or surgical conditions.\n\n==Midwifery-led continuity of care==\n[[File:Australian Clinical Midwifery Facilitator Florence West teaches training midwives at the Pacific Adventist University PAU, outskirts of Port Moresby, PNG.

Five columns of this papyrus deal with [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrics and gynecology]], especially concerning the acceleration of parturition (the action or process of giving birth to offspring) and the birth prognosis of the newborn. The [[Westcar Papyrus|Westcar papyrus]], dated to 1700 BCE, includes instructions for calculating the expected date of confinement and describes different styles of birth chairs. Bas reliefs in the royal birth rooms at Luxor and other temples also attest to the heavy presence of midwifery in this culture.<ref name=\"TowlerBramall-9\">Jean Towler and Joan Bramall, ''Midwives in History and Society'' (London: Croom Helm, 1986), p. 9</ref>\n\nMidwifery in [[Greco-Roman]] antiquity covered a wide range of women, including old women who continued folk medical traditions in the villages of the [[Roman Empire]], trained midwives who garnered their knowledge from a variety of sources, and highly trained women who were considered physicians.<ref name=\"Flemming-359\">Rebecca Flemming, ''Medicine and the Making of Roman Women'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2000), p. 359</ref> However, there were certain characteristics desired in a \u201cgood\u201d [[midwife]], as described by the physician [[Soranus of Ephesus]] in the 2nd century. He states in his work, ''Gynecology'', that \u201ca suitable person will be literate, with her wits about her, possessed of a good memory, loving work, respectable and generally not unduly handicapped as regards her senses [i.e., sight, smell, hearing], sound of limb, robust, and, according to some people, endowed with long slim fingers and short nails at her fingertips.\u201d Soranus also recommends that the [[midwife]] be of sympathetic disposition (although she need not have borne a child herself) and that she keep her hands soft for the comfort of both mother and child.<ref name=\"French-69-84\">Valerie French, \"Midwives and Maternity Care in the Roman World\" (Helios, New Series 12(2), 1986), pp. 69-84</ref> [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], another physician from this time, valued nobility and a quiet and inconspicuous disposition in a [[midwife]].<ref name=\"Jackson-97\">Ralph Jackson, ''Doctors and Diseases in the Roman Empire'' (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1988), p. 97</ref>  There appears to have been three \u201cgrades\u201d of midwives present:   The first was technically proficient; the second may have read some of the texts on obstetrics and gynecology; but the third was highly trained and reasonably considered a [[medical specialist]] with a concentration in midwifery.<ref name=\"Jackson-97\" />\n\n[[Agnodice]] or Agnodike (Gr. \u1f08\u03b3\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b7) was the earliest historical, and likely apocryphal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/artifacts/antiqua/women.cfm |title=Women in Medicine |publisher=www.hsl.virginia.edu |accessdate=2012-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403130301/http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/artifacts/antiqua/women.cfm |archive-date=2013-04-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[midwife]] mentioned among the ancient Greeks.<ref>{{Cite book  | last = Greenhill  | first = William Alexander  | author-link =   | contribution = Agnodice  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology  | volume = 1  | page = 74  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0083.html  | postscript = <!--None--> | title-link = Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology }}</ref>\n\nMidwives were known by many different titles in antiquity, ranging from ''iatrin\u0113'' (Gr. [[nurse]]), ''maia'' (Gr., midwife), ''obstetrix'' (Lat., [[obstetrician]]), and ''medica'' (Lat., [[physician|doctor]]).<ref name=\"Flemming-421-424\">Rebecca Flemming, Medicine and the Making of Roman Women (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 421-424</ref> It appears as though midwifery was treated differently in the Eastern end of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean basin]] as opposed to the West. In the East, some women advanced beyond the profession of [[midwife]] (''maia'') to that of gynaecologist (''iatros gynaikeios'', translated as ''women's doctor''), for which formal training was required. Also, there were some gynecological tracts circulating in the medical and educated circles of the East that were written by women with Greek names, although these women were few in number. Based on these facts, it would appear that midwifery in the East was a respectable profession in which respectable women could earn their livelihoods and enough esteem to publish works read and cited by male physicians. In fact, a number of Roman legal provisions strongly suggest that midwives enjoyed status and remuneration comparable to that of male doctors.<ref name=\"French-69-84\" /> One example of such a [[midwife]] is [[Salpe|Salpe of Lemnos]], who wrote on women's diseases and was mentioned several times in the works of Pliny.<ref name=\"Jackson-97\" />\n\n[[File:Ancient Roman relief carving of a midwife Wellcome M0003964.jpg|thumb|Ancient Roman relief carving of a [[midwife]]]]\n\nHowever, in the Roman West, information about practicing midwives comes mainly from funerary epitaphs. Two hypotheses are suggested by looking at a small sample of these epitaphs. The first is the midwifery was not a profession to which freeborn women of families that had enjoyed free status of several generations were attracted; therefore it seems that most midwives were of servile origin. Second, since most of these funeral epitaphs describe the women as freed, it can be proposed that midwives were generally valued enough, and earned enough income, to be able to gain their freedom. It is not known from these epitaphs how certain slave women were selected for training as midwives. [[Slave]] girls may have been apprenticed, and it is most likely that mothers taught their daughters.<ref name=\"French-69-84\" />\n\nThe actual duties of the [[midwife]] in antiquity consisted mainly of assisting in the birthing process, although they may also have helped with other medical problems relating to women when needed. Often, the [[midwife]] would call for the assistance of a [[physician]] when a more difficult birth was anticipated. In many cases the [[midwife]] brought along two or three assistants.<ref name=\"Towler-Bramall-12\">Towler and Bramall, p.12</ref> In antiquity, it was believed by both midwives and physicians that a normal delivery was made easier when a woman sat upright. Therefore, during parturition, midwives brought a stool to the home where the delivery was to take place. In the seat of the birthstool was a crescent-shaped hole through which the baby would be delivered. The birthstool or chair often had armrests for the mother to grasp during the delivery. Most birthstools or chairs had backs which the patient could press against, but Soranus suggests that in some cases the chairs were backless and an assistant would stand behind the mother to support her.<ref name=\"French-69-84\" /> The [[midwife]] sat facing the mother, encouraging and supporting her through the birth, perhaps offering instruction on breathing and pushing, sometimes massaging her vaginal opening, and supporting her perineum during the delivery of the baby. The assistants may have helped by pushing downwards on the top of the mother's abdomen.\n\nFinally, the [[midwife]] received the infant, placed it in pieces of cloth, cut the [[umbilical cord]], and cleansed the baby.<ref name=\"Jackson-97\" /> The child was sprinkled with \u201cfine and powdery salt, or natron or aphronitre\u201d to soak up the birth residue, rinsed, and then powdered and rinsed again. Next, the midwives cleared away any and all mucus present from the nose, mouth, ears, or anus. Midwives were encouraged by Soranus to put [[olive oil]] in the baby's eyes to cleanse away any birth residue, and to place a piece of wool soaked in olive oil over the umbilical cord. After the delivery, the [[midwife]] made the initial call on whether or not an infant was healthy and fit to rear. She inspected the newborn for [[Congenital disorder|congenital deformities]] and testing its cry to hear whether or not it was robust and hearty. Ultimately, midwives made a determination about the chances for an infant's survival and likely recommended that a newborn with any severe deformities be exposed.<ref name=\"French-69-84\" />\n\nA 2nd-century terracotta relief from the Ostian tomb of Scribonia Attice, wife of physician-surgeon M. Ulpius Amerimnus, details a childbirth scene. Scribonia was a [[midwife]] and the relief shows her in the midst of a delivery. A patient sits in the birth chair, gripping the handles and the [[midwife]]\u2019s assistant stands behind her providing support. Scribonia sits on a low stool in front of the woman, modestly looking away while also assisting the delivery by dilating and massaging the vagina, as encouraged by Soranus.<ref name=\"Jackson-97\" />\n\nThe services of a [[midwife]] were not inexpensive; this fact that suggests poorer women who could not afford the services of a professional [[midwife]] often had to make do with female relatives. Many wealthier families had their own midwives. However, the vast majority of women in the Greco-Roman world very likely received their maternity care from hired midwives. They may have been highly trained or possessed only a rudimentary knowledge of obstetrics. Also, many families had a choice of whether or not they wanted to employ a [[midwife]] who practiced the [[traditional medicine|traditional folk medicine]] or the newer methods of professional parturition.<ref name=\"French-69-84\" /> Like a lot of other factors in antiquity, quality gynecological care often depended heavily on the socioeconomic status of the patient.\n\n===Post-classical history===\n[[File:\"Dr. William Hunter at a confinement\" Wellcome L0015724.jpg|alt=A man looking through a gap between curtains, a chest with medicines to right.|thumb|421x421px|18th-century etching of [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]] attending a pregnant woman.

However, at the beginning of the 21st century, the medical perception of pregnancy and childbirth as potentially pathological and dangerous still dominates Western culture. Midwives who work in hospital settings also have been influenced by this view, although by and large they are trained to view birth as a normal and healthy process. While midwives play a much larger role in the care of pregnant mothers in Europe than in America, the medicalized model of birth still has influence in those countries, even though the World Health Organization recommends a natural, normal and humanized birth.<ref name=\"Fortaleza declaration\">{{cite web|title= Fortaleza Declaration: Appropriate Use of Technology for Birth |url=http://www.weikert.de/alexandra/who1.html |publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=2015}}</ref>\n\nThe midwifery model of pregnancy and childbirth as a normal and healthy process plays a much larger role in Sweden and the Netherlands than the rest of Europe, however. Swedish midwives stand out, since they administer 80 percent of prenatal care and more than 80 percent of family planning services in Sweden. Midwives in Sweden attend all normal births in public hospitals and Swedish women tend to have fewer interventions in hospitals than American women. The Dutch infant mortality rate in 1992 was the tenth-lowest rate in the world, at 6.3 deaths per thousand births, while the United States ranked twenty-second.

He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985.

May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.

While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built. It was named \"The Spade\", as the shape of the body resembled the form shown on playing cards. However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".<ref name=\"The Spade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/the-spade-guitar.html|title=The 'Spade' guitar|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay commented on the Red Special:\n\n{{quote|I like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide.

''Queen in Their Own Words''. p.62. Omnibus Press, 1992</ref>}}\n\nIn addition to using his home-made guitar he prefers to use coins (especially [[Sixpence (British coin)|a sixpence]] from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic [[plectrum]], because he feels their rigidity gives him more control in playing.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.<ref name=\"Jackson\">Laura Jackson (2011).

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up.

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well.

From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].

Harold May''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist. He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.  The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/brian-may-guide-queen-guitarists-eccentricities-obessions/|first=Adam|last=White|title=From badgers to flamboyant alter egos: a guide to the strange obsessions of Queen's Brian May|date=19 July 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\nIn May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the [[Guns N' Roses]] song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/07/brian-may-chinese-democracy|title=Brian May dropped from Guns N' Roses album|last=Anthony|first=James|date=7 November 2008|website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132010===\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|May performing in Frankfurt in 2005.]]\nFrom his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor.

While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built. It was named \"The Spade\", as the shape of the body resembled the form shown on playing cards. However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".<ref name=\"The Spade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/the-spade-guitar.html|title=The 'Spade' guitar|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay commented on the Red Special:\n\n{{quote|I like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide.

''Queen in Their Own Words''. p.62. Omnibus Press, 1992</ref>}}\n\nIn addition to using his home-made guitar he prefers to use coins (especially [[Sixpence (British coin)|a sixpence]] from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic [[plectrum]], because he feels their rigidity gives him more control in playing.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.<ref name=\"Jackson\">Laura Jackson (2011).

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

Some of the non-RS electric guitars he used in the studio included:\n*[[Burns London|Burns]] Double Six on \"Long Away\" (1976)<ref name=\"MR\"/> and \"Under Pressure\" (1981).\n*Fender Telecaster on \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" (1979).<ref name=\"MR\"/> It was used for the video (but not the recordings) of \"Back Chat\" (1982).\n*Gibson Firebird on \"Hammer to Fall\" and \"Tear It Up\" (album versions only, not on stage).\n*[[Ibanez JS Series|Ibanez JS]] on \"Nothing But Blue\" (1991).\n*[[Parker Fly]] on \"Mother Love\" (1993\u20131995).\n\nFor acoustic, he favoured Ovation,<ref name=\"MR\"/> Martin, [[T\u014dkai Guitars|T\u014dkai]] Hummingbird, Godin and Guild. On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] plastic piano in \"[[Teo Torriatte]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/queen/songs/a-day-at-the-races.htm |title=A Day At The Races |website=ultimatequeen.co.uk |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and a toy mini [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] in [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"The Prophet's Song\"]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=gZ5ZCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=may+mini+koto+prophets+song&source=bl&ots=Q2wEPJDBsB&sig=ACfU3U0yjtTueqXty7NPHUjjdkv2NJqqUw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiG3Lu70t7oAhVWG80KHSjiCoYQ6AEwCXoECBIQKw#v=onepage&q=may%20mini%20koto%20prophets%20song&f=false |title=The Bible in Music: A Dictionary of Songs, Works, and More |last=Long |first= Siobh\u00e1n Dowling  |last2=Sawyer |first2=John F.A. |website=books.google.ca |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] |page=189 |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Vocals====\nMay is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].  On-screen, it was performed entirely by puppets.\n\n==Scientific career==\n[[File:Rock Star and Astrophysicist Brian May Visits Paranal.jpg|thumbnail|May in 2015 at [[Paranal Observatory]]]]\n{{See also|List of celebrities with advanced degrees}}\nMay studied physics and mathematics at [[Imperial College London]], graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and [[Associate of the Royal College of Science|ARCS]] in physics with [[Second-class honours|Upper Second-Class Honours]]. From 1970 to 1974, he studied for a [[PhD]]<ref name=mayphd/> degree at Imperial College, studying reflected light from [[interplanetary dust]] and the velocity of dust in the plane of the Solar System.

As well as writing up the previous work he had done, May had to review the work on zodiacal dust undertaken during the intervening 33 years, which included the discovery of the zodiacal dust bands by [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]'s [[IRAS]] satellite. After a [[Oral exam|viva voce]], the revised thesis (titled \"A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud\")<ref name=mayphd/> was approved in September 2007, some 37 years after it had been commenced.<ref name=buzzcocksphd>{{cite episode| series=Never Mind The Buzzcocks| station=BBC| seriesno=21| number=10| minutes=25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmay.com/brian/biog.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120525083058/http://www.brianmay.com/brian/biog.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 May 2012 |title=BRIAN MAY \u2013 Official Biography |work=Brianmay.com |accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last =May| first =Brian| title =News| url =http://www.brianmay.com/brian/briannews/briannewsjul07.html| archive-url =https://archive.is/20120720094841/http://www.brianmay.com/brian/briannews/briannewsjul07.html| url-status=dead| archive-date =20 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Queen star hands in science PhD\"/><ref>{{cite news| title=Queen star celebrates doctorate |work=BBC News |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6961171.stm |accessdate=25 August 2007 | date=23 August 2007 }}</ref> He was able to submit his thesis only because of the minimal amount of research on the topic during the intervening years and has described the subject as one that became \"trendy\" again in the 2000s.

Brand and Ross called Sachs to interview him on-air; when he did not answer, they left a series of lewd messages on his answering machine, including comments about Brand's relationship with Sachs' granddaughter, Georgina Baillie. After initially receiving little attention, a 26 October article in ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' led to widespread criticism of Brand, Ross and the editorial decisions of the [[BBC]], with the event becoming known as \"'''Sachsgate'''\" or \"'''Manuelgate'''\" (a reference to Sachs' [[Manuel (Fawlty Towers)|character]] in ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'').<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/sachsgate-obscene-prank-calls-russell-9376380|title=Andrew Sachs was 'haunted' by obscene calls from Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross|last=Rutter|first=Claire|date=2016-12-02|work=mirror|access-date=2017-08-12}}</ref>\n\nBrand and Ross were criticised by a number of [[Members of Parliament]], including [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]], and the BBC received a record number of complaints. The BBC suspended Ross while it and [[Ofcom]] launched investigations. Both Brand and Radio 2 controller [[Lesley Douglas]] resigned from the BBC. On 30 October, the BBC suspended Ross without pay for 12 weeks. The BBC was fined \u00a3150,000 by Ofcom.<ref>{{cite news|last=Holmwood|first=Leigh|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/apr/03/russell-brand-jonathan-ross-bbc-fine|title=BBC fined \u00a3150,000 over Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross phone prank scandal|work=The Guardian|accessdate=3 April 2009|location=London, UK}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nFrom April 2006 through to October 2008, [[Russell Brand]] presented the weekly BBC radio show [[The Russell Brand Show (radio show)|''The Russell Brand Show'']]. In most episodes Brand was joined by his co-host [[Matt Morgan (comedian)|Matt Morgan]] who would often steer him in certain directions regarding what to talk about. Brand sometimes called in a variety of his celebrity friends as well, including [[Noel Fielding]], [[Jonah Hill]] and [[Morrissey]], to talk on the show each week.\n\nOn 11 October 2008, [[David Baddiel]] co-hosted Brand's show. Baddiel recalled having met Georgina Baillie at Brand's home and being told that her grandfather was actor [[Andrew Sachs]]. According to Baddiel, Baillie said \"Don't tell him I was here!\"<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC apologises for lewd phone calls by Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross|date=28 October 2008|work=[[The Times]]|author=Patrick Foster|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5022840.ece | location=London}}</ref>\n\n==Prank calls==\n\nOn Thursday 16 October 2008, Sachs, who famously portrayed [[Manuel (Fawlty Towers)|Manuel]] in television comedy ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', was scheduled to be a phone-in guest on Brand's evening radio show.  The show was to be pre-recorded due to Brand's work commitments.<ref name=\"bbcApology\"/>\n\nAfter being unable to reach Sachs on his home telephone, Brand and his co-host of the week, fellow Radio 2 DJ [[Jonathan Ross]], left Sachs four voice messages. In the first message, Brand joked about ''Fawlty Towers'' and the fact that both he and Sachs had appeared in ''[[The Bill]]'', but was interrupted by Ross shouting out \"he fucked your granddaughter\". The rest of the message and the following three messages were all characterised by Brand and Ross attempting to apologise for Ross' outburst, but each quickly descended into farce, with, for example, Brand singing to Sachs: \"It was consensual and she wasn't menstrual\" and Ross asking to marry him.<ref name=\"bbcApology\"/>  Brand later said that listening to those calls is like hearing \"two idiots dancing towards a canyon\"; however no complaints were received.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4289499/Russell-Brand-jokes-about-Andrew-Sachs-scandal-in-new-comedy-gig.html |title=Russell Brand jokes about Andrew Sachs scandal in new comedy gig |work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London |first=Aislinn |last=Simpson |date=19 January 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Complaints==\nOn 25 October, Brand presented his last edition of his radio show with co-host [[Simon Amstell]], which they performed live. Shortly before going on air, Brand was informed that ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' would be running a story about the phone calls. During the show, Brand apologised to Sachs, but also devoted much of the show to deriding the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' for its support of [[Nazism]] in the run up to [[World War II]]. Even in his apology to Sachs, Brand stated \"what's worse \u2013 leaving a swearword on [[Andrew Sachs]]' answerphone or tacitly supporting [[Adolf Hitler]] when he took charge of the [[Third Reich]]?\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/27/russell-brand-daily-mail-fawlty-towers |title=Russell Brand highlights Mail Hitler links in apology to Fawlty Towers star |date=27 October 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=John |last=Plunkett}}</ref>\n\nThe incident escalated into a media and political storm that, in much of the British media, eclipsed news of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|global financial crisis]], the [[2008 United States presidential election|US Presidential election]], and [[2008 Nord-Kivu fighting|fighting in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]].<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC suspends top stars in media storm|date=29 October 2008|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|url=http://currentaffairs.ninemsn.com.au./article.aspx?id=657414}}</ref>\n\nSachs later stated he had not given permission for the messages to be broadcast.<ref name=\"Telegraph29Oct08\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/3278635/Jonathan-Ross-and-Russell-Brand-suspended-by-BBC-over-Andrew-Sachs-calls.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand suspended by BBC over Andrew Sachs calls|date=29 October 2008|accessdate=29 October 2008|author=Anita Singh | location=London}}</ref> The BBC originally stated that they were \"not aware of any complaint by Mr Sachs\", but later confirmed a complaint had been received, and apologised.<ref name=\"bbcApology\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7692911.stm|title=BBC apologises over Brand prank|date=27 October 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 October 2008}}</ref> Brand issued an apology for making the calls<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7691641.stm|title=Brand 'sorry' for telephone stunt|publisher=BBC|date=26 October 2008}}</ref> but stated it was \"funny\" during his last radio show, before the ''Mail'' had printed the story.<ref name=\"bbcApology\" /> [[Ofcom]], the telecommunications regulator, announced its own investigation.<ref>{{cite news|author=Rob Shepherd|title= Pressure mounts over Ross and Brand phone prank|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2008/10/pressure_mounts_over_ross_and_brand_phone_prank.html|work= [[Broadcast Now]]|date=28 October 2008|accessdate=28 October 2008}}</ref> On 28 October 2008, the BBC said that it had received 4,700 complaints,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7694921.stm|title=Ofcom to launch BBC Brand inquiry|date=28 October 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=28 October 2008}}</ref> after the calls became international news.<ref name=\"NME29Oct08\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-killers/40721|title=Killers and Glasvegas caught-up in Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand's BBC ban|date=29 October 2008|work=[[NME]]|accessdate=29 October 2008}}</ref><ref name=Times2 /> Later the same day, this number had passed 10,000.<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7694989.stm|title=Timeline: Russell Brand prank calls|publisher=BBC|date=30 October 2008}}</ref> The same afternoon, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] called the incident \"clearly inappropriate and unacceptable\".<ref name=\"sack\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7696714.stm|title=BBC pressured to sack presenters|date=29 October 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 October 2008}}</ref> The following day the number of complaints was said to have topped 18,000.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\nThis incident resulted in the second-highest number of complaints to the BBC in recent years, second only to its airing of ''[[Jerry Springer: The Opera]]''.<ref name=Times2>{{cite news|title=Tories demand Commons debate on BBC 'Manuelgate'|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=30 October 2008|author=Philippe Naughton|url=http://timesonline.co.uk./tol/news/uk/article5047594.ece|publisher=News International Limited}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Offence record: The most complained-about shows|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=29 October 2008|url=http://guardian.co.uk./media/2008/oct/29/russell-brand-jonathan-ross-complaints|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=This could spell the end for the comedy of cruelty|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=30 October 2008|url=http://telegraph.co.uk./opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/10/30/dl3001.xml}}</ref>\n\nIn reaction to the telephone calls, Baillie said that her relationship with Brand had been brief and she now felt betrayed that he had revealed it to her grandfather.

Some were amazed at the comments of the Prime Minister, with one person observing that \"[t]he financial markets are wrecked and all he can do is talk about a petty joke.\"  Others stated that people should \"calm down\", \"get a grip\", and that the subject had been \"blown out of all proportion\". McKenzie also characterised the reaction from the news media as containing \"anger: some genuine, some of it synthetic. Some of it comes from the BBC's usual critics.\"  He stated that for the people who worked in the media \"profile and salary-envy and [[:wikt:schadenfreude|schadenfreude]] may play a part in all this.

He went on to say that the attitude displayed by the complainants and the BBC's backing down would have, in earlier times, precluded the production of much of what was at the time edgy comedy and made culture poorer for it (citing ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', ''[[The Day Today]]'' and ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' amongst others as shows that would have not been commissioned owing to their controversial content). While pouring scorn on those who had complained without seeing the programme, and attacking newspapers that attempted to stir up further controversy (in particular the ''[[Daily Mail]]''), he did not appear to defend Brand and Ross in particular, stating that the possibility of people being offended by some misjudged humour is \"the price you pay for freedom of speech.\" In a further column in ''[[The Guardian]]'', he reiterated this point as well as saying that \"people who retrospectively complain to Ofcom about material they've only read about second-hand are, in essence, a bunch of sanctimonious crybabies indulging in a wretched form of masturbation.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Charlie Brooker's screen burn|date=29 November 2008|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/nov/29/charlie-brooker-screen-burn-tv | location=London | accessdate=23 May 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC website\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7698477.stm|title= Prank row: Georgina Baillie's reaction|date=29 October 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 November 2008}}</ref><ref name ='publicityparadox'>{{cite news|author=Matthew Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/30/russell-brand-ross-baillie-sachs |title=Georgina Baillie: the Satanic Slut at the centre of the Ross-Brand controversy |work=The Guardian |date= 30 October 2008|accessdate=22 August 2010 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=\"BroadcastFiveTV\">{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2008/10/five_to_air_doc_on_russell_and_ross.html|title=Five to air doc on Russell and Ross|work=Broadcast|date=31 October 2008|accessdate =2 November 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7710341.stm|title=Radio 2 row 'out of proportion'|publisher=BBC News|date=7 November 2008|accessdate =7 November 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Reaction from Georgina Baillie===\n\n====Interviews====\nReacting to the suspension of [[Russell Brand]] and [[Jonathan Ross]] on 29 October, Baillie remarked: \"I'm thrilled because justice has been done...It's despicable.

Asked by Neil if receiving an apology from Brand and Ross had mattered to her, she said yes, as she had been \"publicly offended and humiliated\", and her grandfather \"had been humiliated too\". When asked by Abbott if all the publicity surrounding the Brand row had helped her career, she responded \"not necessarily ... one would think so, but not really.\" Neil further asked if the apology she received had helped, she replied yes, stating \"definitely\" to the follow-up comment from Neil of \"better to get it than not get it?\" When asked finally on the row by Neil if she thought the apologies from Brand and Ross were genuine, she replied that she thought Ross' was, but the fact that Brand had joked about the row on his later tour negated his apology.\n\n{{section move from|date=January 2020}}\n====Songwriting====\nIn 2010, Baillie teamed up with singer [[Adam Ant]] (whose drummer Hayley Leggs had been a member, alongside Baillie, of [[burlesque]] troupe The Satanic Sluts) to compose the song Gun in Your Pocket, about Ross, Brand and the entire affair, which he intended to release as the lead single for his ninth album ''[[Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner's Daughter]]'' (with a rerecording of early 1980s outtake Who's A Goofy Bunny Then? as the B-side in tribute to the recently deceased [[Malcolm McLaren]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/04165-adam-ant-interview-oasis-lady-gaga-madonna-punk |title=Features &#124; A Wild Nobility: An Adam Ant Exclusive By Simon Price |publisher=The Quietus |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref> The project was put on hold when Ant (who has a history of [[bipolar disorder]] and was widely suspected around this time to have been undergoing a fresh [[Bipolar disorder#Manic episodes|manic]] episode)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holymoly.com/celebrity-news/adam-ants-comeback-all-delusion45650 |title=Adam Ant's comeback \"all delusion\" &#124; Celebrity News |publisher=Holy Moly! |date=21 April 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712214236/http://www.holymoly.com/celebrity-news/adam-ants-comeback-all-delusion45650 |archivedate=12 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> was once again [[involuntary commitment|sectioned]] on 18 May 2010 However he soon resumed his comeback and Gun in Your Pocket was finally released in October 2012 as the B-side to Cool Zombie, the eventual first single from the album (which finally emerged in January 2013).  \n\nBaillie and Ant composed a second track about the Ross-Brand affair, Rubber Medusa, a song focussed mainly on Brand and written from Baillie's perspective.

The rest of the message and the following three messages were all characterised by Brand and Ross attempting to apologise for Ross' outburst, but each quickly descended into farce, with, for example, Brand singing to Sachs: \"It was consensual and she wasn't menstrual\" and Ross asking to marry him.<ref name=\"bbcApology\"/>  Brand later said that listening to those calls is like hearing \"two idiots dancing towards a canyon\"; however no complaints were received.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4289499/Russell-Brand-jokes-about-Andrew-Sachs-scandal-in-new-comedy-gig.html |title=Russell Brand jokes about Andrew Sachs scandal in new comedy gig |work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London |first=Aislinn |last=Simpson |date=19 January 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Complaints==\nOn 25 October, Brand presented his last edition of his radio show with co-host [[Simon Amstell]], which they performed live.

Some were amazed at the comments of the Prime Minister, with one person observing that \"[t]he financial markets are wrecked and all he can do is talk about a petty joke.\"  Others stated that people should \"calm down\", \"get a grip\", and that the subject had been \"blown out of all proportion\". McKenzie also characterised the reaction from the news media as containing \"anger: some genuine, some of it synthetic. Some of it comes from the BBC's usual critics.\"  He stated that for the people who worked in the media \"profile and salary-envy and [[:wikt:schadenfreude|schadenfreude]] may play a part in all this.

He went on to say that the attitude displayed by the complainants and the BBC's backing down would have, in earlier times, precluded the production of much of what was at the time edgy comedy and made culture poorer for it (citing ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', ''[[The Day Today]]'' and ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' amongst others as shows that would have not been commissioned owing to their controversial content). While pouring scorn on those who had complained without seeing the programme, and attacking newspapers that attempted to stir up further controversy (in particular the ''[[Daily Mail]]''), he did not appear to defend Brand and Ross in particular, stating that the possibility of people being offended by some misjudged humour is \"the price you pay for freedom of speech.\" In a further column in ''[[The Guardian]]'', he reiterated this point as well as saying that \"people who retrospectively complain to Ofcom about material they've only read about second-hand are, in essence, a bunch of sanctimonious crybabies indulging in a wretched form of masturbation.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Charlie Brooker's screen burn|date=29 November 2008|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/nov/29/charlie-brooker-screen-burn-tv | location=London | accessdate=23 May 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC website\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7698477.stm|title= Prank row: Georgina Baillie's reaction|date=29 October 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 November 2008}}</ref><ref name ='publicityparadox'>{{cite news|author=Matthew Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/30/russell-brand-ross-baillie-sachs |title=Georgina Baillie: the Satanic Slut at the centre of the Ross-Brand controversy |work=The Guardian |date= 30 October 2008|accessdate=22 August 2010 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=\"BroadcastFiveTV\">{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2008/10/five_to_air_doc_on_russell_and_ross.html|title=Five to air doc on Russell and Ross|work=Broadcast|date=31 October 2008|accessdate =2 November 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7710341.stm|title=Radio 2 row 'out of proportion'|publisher=BBC News|date=7 November 2008|accessdate =7 November 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Reaction from Georgina Baillie===\n\n====Interviews====\nReacting to the suspension of [[Russell Brand]] and [[Jonathan Ross]] on 29 October, Baillie remarked: \"I'm thrilled because justice has been done...It's despicable.

On 1 September 1930, she joined the party to do some volunteer work, although not characterized before as politically active, and '''more amazing''', regardless her  partly Jewish parental decent, and her obvious positive attitude towards others' religion and culture.  From the local branch, Magda moved to the party headquarters in Berlin and for a brief period became secretary to Hans Meinshausen, Goebbels' deputy, before being invited to take charge of Goebbels' own private papers.{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=82}} She and Goebbels became romantically involved while on a short trip with friends to Weimar in February 1931.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=152}} A relationship began and by April they began making plans for their future together.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=153}} Goebbels wrote in his diary, \"We have made a solemn vow to each other: When we have conquered the [[Reich]], we will become man and wife.

Goebbels was often jealous, and had some concern over the fact that Hitler had grown fond of Magda.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=153, 157, 158}} Magda decided to move forward their wedding date,{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=153}} and the couple were married on 19 December 1931, with Hitler as a witness.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=167}}  [[Otto Wagener]] claims that Magda's marriage to Goebbels was somewhat arranged; since Hitler intended to remain unmarried, it was suggested that as the wife of a leading and highly visible Nazi official she might eventually act as \"first lady of the [[Third Reich]]\".  Magda was a very ambitious woman with social connections and upper class bearing that may have influenced Goebbels' own enthusiasm.<ref name=wagener>Wagener, Otto, ''Hitler: Memoirs of a Confidant''</ref> Goebbels biographer [[Peter Longerich]] concurred with this \"plausible\" conclusion as.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=159, 160}} Meissner contends that Hitler (though undoubtedly impressed by Magda) was an exceptionally close friend of the couple in the early days.

Privately, however, Magda expressed doubts, especially after the war began to go badly on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. On 9 November 1942, during a gathering with friends listening to a speech by Hitler, she switched off the radio exclaiming, \"My God, what a lot of rubbish.\"{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=219}} In 1944, she reportedly said of Hitler, \"He no longer listens to voices of reason.

She joined the party on 1 September 1930, and did some volunteer work, although she has not been characterized as politically active.

Privately, however, Magda expressed doubts, especially after the war began to go badly on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. On 9 November 1942, during a gathering with friends listening to a speech by Hitler, she switched off the radio exclaiming, \"My God, what a lot of rubbish.\"{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=219}} In 1944, she reportedly said of Hitler, \"He no longer listens to voices of reason.

Though his fate has not been established, it is widely assumed that he perished in the camps.

He later qualified this by stating that the children would support the decision [to commit suicide] if they were old enough to speak for themselves.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=686}}\n\nMagda was among the last to see both Hitler and [[Eva Braun]] before they [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]] on the afternoon of 30 April.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|pp=827\u2013828}} On the following day, 1&nbsp;May, Magda and Joseph arranged for SS dentist [[Helmut Kunz]] to inject [[Goebbels children|their six children]] with [[morphine]] so that when they were unconscious, an ampule of [[cyanide]] could be then crushed in each of their mouths. Kunz later stated he gave the children morphine injections, but it was Magda and SS-''[[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Ludwig Stumpfegger]] (Hitler's personal doctor) who administered the cyanide.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=380, 381}} Author [[James P.

He surmises that witnesses blamed the deaths on Stumpfegger because he was a convenient target, having died the following day. Moreover, as O'Donnell states, Stumpfegger may have been too intoxicated at the time of the deaths to have played a reliable role.{{sfn|O'Donnell|2001}}\n\nMagda appears to have contemplated and talked about killing her children a month in advance.{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=242}} According to her friend and sister-in-law (from her first marriage) Ello Quandt, she told her that they were all going to take poison.\n{{quote|We have demanded monstrous things from the German people, treated other nations with pitiless cruelty.
