She became involved in performing arts at a young age, singing in the youth choir at her church and performing in a city dance team.

Previously signed to [[Atlantic Records]], Mon\u00e9t released her debut EP ''Nightmares & Lullabies: Act 1'' in 2014 and her follow-up EP ''Nightmares & Lullabies: Act 2'' in 2015. \n\nMon\u00e9t has written songs for a number of artists including [[Nas]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[Fifth Harmony]], [[T.I.]], [[GOOD Music]], [[Lupe Fiasco]], [[Chrisette Michele]], [[Coco Jones]], [[Chris Brown]], [[Diddy Dirty Money]], [[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]], and [[Jasmine V]].

Her first onstage experience came when she sang in her [[Catholic school]] holiday plays. She also sang in the youth choir at her local church but it was dance that initially gave her a sense of herself as a performer. By the time she became a student at the local performing arts high school, Mon\u00e9t had developed a grueling rehearsal schedule. She taught at two different dance studios and rehearsed with a local dance group, Boogie Monstarz, at Step One Dance Studios in Sacramento, while working at a local bank.\n\n== Career ==\n\n===2012\u20132015: Songwriting and ''Nightmares & Lullabies''===\nOutside of dance rehearsals, Mon\u00e9t began exchanging poetry with an older cousin and found a new passion. This soon translated into her writing her own music. Meanwhile, she had been educating herself on the production world, learning about producers and making music at local recording studio. She learned about [[Rodney Jerkins]] (aka Darkchild) and decided to add him on [[Myspace]].<ref name=\"IGotSoul\">{{cite web|last1=YKIGS|title=Interview: Victoria Mon\u00e9t Talks Nightmares & Lullabies Project, Working With Ariana Grande, & Signing With Atlantic Records|url=http://youknowigotsoul.com/interview-victoria-monet-talks-nightmares-lullabies-project-working-with-ariana-grande-signing-with-atlantic-records|website=YouKnowIGotSoul.com|accessdate=13 April 2015}}</ref> Shortly after that, he invited her to come to [[Los Angeles]] and audition for a new girl group he was forming, Purple Reign.<ref name=\"SoulTrain\">{{cite journal|date=December 12, 2014|title=Profile: Victoria Monet |journal=[[Soul Train]]|url=http://soultrain.com/2014/12/12/profile-victoria-monet/}}</ref> The group landed a record deal with [[Motown]] a year later.

She became involved in performing arts at a young age, singing in the youth choir at her church and performing in a city dance team. She soon took to writing and began working with producer [[Rodney Jerkins]]. Previously signed to [[Atlantic Records]], Mon\u00e9t released her debut EP ''Nightmares & Lullabies: Act 1'' in 2014 and her follow-up EP ''Nightmares & Lullabies: Act 2'' in 2015. \n\nMon\u00e9t has written songs for a number of artists including [[Nas]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[Fifth Harmony]], [[T.I.]], [[GOOD Music]], [[Lupe Fiasco]], [[Chrisette Michele]], [[Coco Jones]], [[Chris Brown]], [[Diddy Dirty Money]], [[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]], and [[Jasmine V]].

Her first onstage experience came when she sang in her [[Catholic school]] holiday plays. She also sang in the youth choir at her local church but it was dance that initially gave her a sense of herself as a performer. By the time she became a student at the local performing arts high school, Mon\u00e9t had developed a grueling rehearsal schedule. She taught at two different dance studios and rehearsed with a local dance group, Boogie Monstarz, at Step One Dance Studios in Sacramento, while working at a local bank.\n\n== Career ==\n\n===2012\u20132015: Songwriting and ''Nightmares & Lullabies''===\nOutside of dance rehearsals, Mon\u00e9t began exchanging poetry with an older cousin and found a new passion. This soon translated into her writing her own music. Meanwhile, she had been educating herself on the production world, learning about producers and making music at local recording studio. She learned about [[Rodney Jerkins]] (aka Darkchild) and decided to add him on [[Myspace]].<ref name=\"IGotSoul\">{{cite web|last1=YKIGS|title=Interview: Victoria Mon\u00e9t Talks Nightmares & Lullabies Project, Working With Ariana Grande, & Signing With Atlantic Records|url=http://youknowigotsoul.com/interview-victoria-monet-talks-nightmares-lullabies-project-working-with-ariana-grande-signing-with-atlantic-records|website=YouKnowIGotSoul.com|accessdate=13 April 2015}}</ref> Shortly after that, he invited her to come to [[Los Angeles]] and audition for a new girl group he was forming, Purple Reign.<ref name=\"SoulTrain\">{{cite journal|date=December 12, 2014|title=Profile: Victoria Monet |journal=[[Soul Train]]|url=http://soultrain.com/2014/12/12/profile-victoria-monet/}}</ref> The group landed a record deal with [[Motown]] a year later.

[[World War III]] has devastated most of the populated world, polluting the atmosphere with [[nuclear fallout]], and killing all human and animal life in the Northern Hemisphere. The war began with a nuclear attack by [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] on [[Italy]], and then escalated with the bombing of the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Egypt]]. Because the aircraft used in these attacks were obtained from the [[Soviet Union]], the Soviets were mistakenly blamed, triggering a retaliatory strike on the Soviet Union by [[NATO]].\n\nThere is also an attack by the Soviets on the [[People's Republic of China]], which may have been a response to a Chinese attack aimed at occupying Soviet industrial areas near the Chinese border. Most, if not all, of the bombs [[cobalt bomb|included cobalt]] to enhance their radioactive properties.\n\nGlobal air currents are slowly carrying the lethal nuclear fallout across the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], to the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The only parts of the planet still habitable are Australia, [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], and the southern parts of [[South America]], although they are slowly succumbing to [[radiation poisoning]] as well. Life in Melbourne continues reasonably normally, although the near-complete lack of motor fuels makes traveling difficult.\n\nPeople in Australia detect a mysterious and incomprehensible [[Morse code]] radio signal originating from the American city of [[Seattle, Washington]]. With hope that someone has survived in the contaminated regions, one of the last American nuclear submarines, USS ''Scorpion'', placed by its captain, Commander Dwight Towers, under Australian naval command, is ordered to sail north from its port of refuge in Melbourne (Australia's southernmost major mainland city) to contact whoever is sending the signal. In preparation for this journey, the submarine makes a shorter trip to port cities in northern Australia, including [[Cairns, Queensland]], and [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]; no survivors are found. Two Australians sail with the American crew: Lieutenant Commander Peter Holmes, naval liaison officer to the Americans, and a scientist, Professor John Osborne.\n\nCommander Towers has become attached to a young Australian woman distantly related to Osborne, named Moira Davidson, who tries to cope with the impending end of human life through heavy drinking. Despite his attraction to Davidson, Towers remains loyal to his wife and children in the United States. He buys his children gifts and imagines their growing older. At one point, however, he makes it clear to Moira that he knows his family is almost certainly dead, and he asks her if she thinks he is insane for acting as if they were still alive. She replies that she does not think he is crazy.\n\nThe Australian government provides citizens with free suicide pills and injections so they can avoid prolonged suffering from radiation poisoning. Periodic reports show the steady southward progression of the deadly radiation. As communications are lost with a city, it is referred to as being \"out.\"\n\nOne of the novel's poignant dilemmas is that of Peter Holmes, who has a baby daughter and a naive wife, Mary, who is in denial about the impending disaster. Because he has been assigned to travel north with the Americans, Peter tries to explain, to Mary's fury and disbelief, how to kill their baby and herself, by taking the suicide pill should he not return from his mission in time to help. The bachelor Osborne spends much of his time restoring and subsequently racing a [[Ferrari]] racing car that he had purchased (along with a fuel supply) for a nominal amount following the war's outbreak.\n\nThe submarine travels to the [[Gulf of Alaska]] in the northern [[Pacific Ocean]], where the crew determines that radiation levels are not decreasing. This finding discredits the \"Jorgensen Effect\", a scientific theory positing that radiation levels will decrease at a much greater rate than previously thought, aided by the weather effects, and potentially allow for human life to continue in southern Australia or at least [[Antarctica]].\n\nThe submarine approaches [[San Francisco]], observing through the [[periscope]] that the city had been devastated and the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] has fallen. In contrast, the [[Puget Sound]] area, from which the strange radio signals are emanating, is found to have avoided destruction because of missile defences. One crew member, who is from [[Edmonds, Washington]], which the expedition visits, jumps ship to spend his last days in his home town.\n\nThe expedition members then sail to an abandoned navy communications school south of [[Seattle]]. A crewman sent ashore with oxygen tanks and protective gear discovers that although the city's residents have long since perished, some of the region's hydroelectric power is still working due to primitive automation technology. He finds that the mysterious radio signal is the result of a broken window sash swinging in the breeze and occasionally hitting a telegraph key. After a brief stop at [[Pearl Harbor]], the remaining submariners return to Australia to live out what little time they have left.\n\nOsborne takes his suicide pill while sitting in his beloved racing car. When Mary Holmes becomes very ill, Peter administers a lethal injection to their daughter. Even though he still feels relatively well, he and Mary take their pills simultaneously so they can die as a family. Towers and his remaining crew choose to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] the ''Scorpion'' in the open ocean, fulfilling a naval duty to not leave the unmanned vessel \"floating about in a foreign port\", after her crew succumbs to suicide or radiation poisoning. Moira watches the submarine's departure in her car, parked atop an adjacent hilltop, as she takes her suicide pill, imagining herself together with Towers as she dies.\n\n==Characterization==\nThe characters make their best efforts to enjoy what time remains to them, speaking of small pleasures and continuing their customary activities. The Holmeses plant a garden that they will never see; Moira initially acts as a [[socialite]] \u2013 drinking and partying excessively \u2013 but upon meeting Towers takes classes in typing and shorthand; Osborne and others organize a dangerous motor race that results in the violent deaths of several participants; elderly members of a \"gentlemen's club\" drink up the wine in the club's cellar, debate over whether or not to move the fishing season up, and fret about whether or not agriculturally destructive [[European rabbit|rabbits]] will survive human beings. Towers goes on a fishing trip with Davidson, but they do not become sexually involved, as he wants to remain loyal to his dead wife, a decision Moira accepts.\n\nGovernment services and the economy gradually grind to a halt. In the end, Towers chooses not to remain and die with Moira, but rather to lead his crew on a final mission to scuttle the submarine outside of Australian territorial waters. He refuses to allow his imminent demise to turn him aside from his duty to the US Navy, and he acts as a pillar of strength to his crew.\n\nTypically for a Shute novel, the characters avoid expressing intense emotions and do not indulge in self-pity. The Australians do not, for the most part, flee southward as refugees but rather accept their fate once the lethal radiation levels reach the latitudes at which they live; most of them opt for the government-promoted alternative of suicide when the symptoms of radiation sickness appear.

[[World War III]] has devastated most of the populated world, polluting the atmosphere with [[nuclear fallout]], and killing all human and animal life in the Northern Hemisphere. The war began with a nuclear attack by [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] on [[Italy]], and then escalated with the bombing of the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Egypt]]. Because the aircraft used in these attacks were obtained from the [[Soviet Union]], the Soviets were mistakenly blamed, triggering a retaliatory strike on the Soviet Union by [[NATO]].\n\nThere is also an attack by the Soviets on the [[People's Republic of China]], which may have been a response to a Chinese attack aimed at occupying Soviet industrial areas near the Chinese border. Most, if not all, of the bombs [[cobalt bomb|included cobalt]] to enhance their radioactive properties.\n\nGlobal air currents are slowly carrying the lethal nuclear fallout across the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], to the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The only parts of the planet still habitable are Australia, [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], and the southern parts of [[South America]], although they are slowly succumbing to [[radiation poisoning]] as well. Life in Melbourne continues reasonably normally, although the near-complete lack of motor fuels makes traveling difficult.\n\nPeople in Australia detect a mysterious and incomprehensible [[Morse code]] radio signal originating from the American city of [[Seattle, Washington]]. With hope that someone has survived in the contaminated regions, one of the last American nuclear submarines, USS ''Scorpion'', placed by its captain, Commander Dwight Towers, under Australian naval command, is ordered to sail north from its port of refuge in Melbourne (Australia's southernmost major mainland city) to contact whoever is sending the signal. In preparation for this journey, the submarine makes a shorter trip to port cities in northern Australia, including [[Cairns, Queensland]], and [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]; no survivors are found. Two Australians sail with the American crew: Lieutenant Commander Peter Holmes, naval liaison officer to the Americans, and a scientist, Professor John Osborne.\n\nCommander Towers has become attached to a young Australian woman distantly related to Osborne, named Moira Davidson, who tries to cope with the impending end of human life through heavy drinking. Despite his attraction to Davidson, Towers remains loyal to his wife and children in the United States. He buys his children gifts and imagines their growing older. At one point, however, he makes it clear to Moira that he knows his family is almost certainly dead, and he asks her if she thinks he is insane for acting as if they were still alive. She replies that she does not think he is crazy.\n\nThe Australian government provides citizens with free suicide pills and injections so they can avoid prolonged suffering from radiation poisoning. Periodic reports show the steady southward progression of the deadly radiation. As communications are lost with a city, it is referred to as being \"out.\"\n\nOne of the novel's poignant dilemmas is that of Peter Holmes, who has a baby daughter and a naive wife, Mary, who is in denial about the impending disaster. Because he has been assigned to travel north with the Americans, Peter tries to explain, to Mary's fury and disbelief, how to kill their baby and herself, by taking the suicide pill should he not return from his mission in time to help. The bachelor Osborne spends much of his time restoring and subsequently racing a [[Ferrari]] racing car that he had purchased (along with a fuel supply) for a nominal amount following the war's outbreak.\n\nThe submarine travels to the [[Gulf of Alaska]] in the northern [[Pacific Ocean]], where the crew determines that radiation levels are not decreasing. This finding discredits the \"Jorgensen Effect\", a scientific theory positing that radiation levels will decrease at a much greater rate than previously thought, aided by the weather effects, and potentially allow for human life to continue in southern Australia or at least [[Antarctica]].\n\nThe submarine approaches [[San Francisco]], observing through the [[periscope]] that the city had been devastated and the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] has fallen. In contrast, the [[Puget Sound]] area, from which the strange radio signals are emanating, is found to have avoided destruction because of missile defences. One crew member, who is from [[Edmonds, Washington]], which the expedition visits, jumps ship to spend his last days in his home town.\n\nThe expedition members then sail to an abandoned navy communications school south of [[Seattle]]. A crewman sent ashore with oxygen tanks and protective gear discovers that although the city's residents have long since perished, some of the region's hydroelectric power is still working due to primitive automation technology. He finds that the mysterious radio signal is the result of a broken window sash swinging in the breeze and occasionally hitting a telegraph key. After a brief stop at [[Pearl Harbor]], the remaining submariners return to Australia to live out what little time they have left.\n\nOsborne takes his suicide pill while sitting in his beloved racing car. When Mary Holmes becomes very ill, Peter administers a lethal injection to their daughter. Even though he still feels relatively well, he and Mary take their pills simultaneously so they can die as a family. Towers and his remaining crew choose to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] the ''Scorpion'' in the open ocean, fulfilling a naval duty to not leave the unmanned vessel \"floating about in a foreign port\", after her crew succumbs to suicide or radiation poisoning. Moira watches the submarine's departure in her car, parked atop an adjacent hilltop, as she takes her suicide pill, imagining herself together with Towers as she dies.\n\n==Characterization==\nThe characters make their best efforts to enjoy what time remains to them, speaking of small pleasures and continuing their customary activities. The Holmeses plant a garden that they will never see; Moira initially acts as a [[socialite]] \u2013 drinking and partying excessively \u2013 but upon meeting Towers takes classes in typing and shorthand; Osborne and others organize a dangerous motor race that results in the violent deaths of several participants; elderly members of a \"gentlemen's club\" drink up the wine in the club's cellar, debate over whether or not to move the fishing season up, and fret about whether or not agriculturally destructive [[European rabbit|rabbits]] will survive human beings. Towers goes on a fishing trip with Davidson, but they do not become sexually involved, as he wants to remain loyal to his dead wife, a decision Moira accepts.\n\nGovernment services and the economy gradually grind to a halt. In the end, Towers chooses not to remain and die with Moira, but rather to lead his crew on a final mission to scuttle the submarine outside of Australian territorial waters. He refuses to allow his imminent demise to turn him aside from his duty to the US Navy, and he acts as a pillar of strength to his crew.\n\nTypically for a Shute novel, the characters avoid expressing intense emotions and do not indulge in self-pity. The Australians do not, for the most part, flee southward as refugees but rather accept their fate once the lethal radiation levels reach the latitudes at which they live; most of them opt for the government-promoted alternative of suicide when the symptoms of radiation sickness appear. In any case, as is made clear within the text, radiation poisoning is also starting to appear as far south as [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, so any such flight would have been pointless.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[The New York Times]]'' called ''On the Beach'' \"the most haunting evocation we have of a world dying of radiation after an atomic war.\" ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' called it \"the most shocking fiction I have read in years.
