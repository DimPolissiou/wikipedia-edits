According to the traditional literature, Ragnar Lodbrok distinguished himself by many raids against the [[British Isles]] and [[Holy Roman Empire]] during the 9th century. According to the sagas Ragnar Lodbrok's father was the [[Legendary Kings of Sweden|legendary Swedish king]] [[Sigurd Ring]]. <ref>https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/Ragnar-Lothbrok/</ref>\n\n== Accounts ==\n=== The Icelandic Sagas ===\nAccording to the ''[[Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok]]'', ''[[Tale of Ragnar's sons]]'', ''[[Heimskringla]]'', ''[[Hervarar Saga]]'', ''[[S\u00f6gubrot]]'', and many other Icelandic sources, Ragnar was the son of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] king [[Sigurd Ring]]. Nearly all of the sagas agree that [[Randver]] was Sigurd's father, with the ''[[Hervarar saga]]'' citing his wife as \u00c5sa, the daughter of King [[Harald Granraude|Harald of the Red Moustache]] from Norway. The accounts further tell that Randver was a grandson of the legendary Scandinavian king [[Ivar Vidfamne]] by his daughter Aud (whom the ''[[Hervarar saga]]'' calls Alfhild).<ref>Tolkien, Christopher, & Turville-Petre, G. (eds) (1956) ''Hervarar Saga ok Heidreks''. London: Viking Society for Northern Research, p. 68-9. [http://www.vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/Text%20Series/Hervarar%20saga%20ok%20heidreks.pdf]\n</ref> After the death of king [[Ivar Vidfamne]], Aud's eldest son by the [[Danes|Danish]] king [[Hr\u0153rekr Ringslinger]], Harald, conquered all of his grandfather's territory and became known as [[Harald Wartooth]]. Harald's nephew [[Sigurd Ring]] became the chief king of Sweden after Randver's death (Denmark according to ''Hervarar saga''), presumably as the subking of Harald. Sigurd and Harald fought the Battle of the Br\u00e1vellir ([[Br\u00e5valla]]) on the plains of [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]], where Harald and many of his men died. Sigurd then ruled Sweden and Denmark (being sometimes identified with a Danish king [[Sigfred]] who ruled from about 770 until his death prior to 804). He sired a son with the Norwegian princess Alfhild of the semi-mythical \u00c1lfar people, Ragnar Lodbrok, who succeeded him.<ref>''S\u00f6gubrot'', Chapter 10 [https://web.archive.org/web/20100908081803/http://www.oe.eclipse.co.uk/nom/Fragment.htm]</ref> [[Eysteinn Beli]], who according to the ''[[Hervarar Saga]]'' was Harald Wartooth's son, ruled Sweden sometime after Sigurd until he was slain by the sons of Ragnar and [[Aslaug]].<ref>''The Tale of Ragnar's Sons'', Chapter 2 [http://www.germanicmythology.com/FORNALDARSAGAS/ThattrRagnarsSonar.html]</ref> \n\nIn their accounts of his reign, the Icelandic sagas tell more about Ragnar's marriages than about feats of warfare. According to the ''[[Sogubrot|S\u00f6gubrot]]'', \"he was the biggest and fairest of men that human eyes have seen, and he was like his mother in appearance and took after her kin\".<ref>''S\u00f6gubrot'', Chapter 10 [[https://web.archive.org/web/20100908081803/http://www.oe.eclipse.co.uk/nom/Fragment.htm]</ref> He first killed a giant snake that guarded the abode of the [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland|East Geatic]] jarl's daughter [[Thora Borgarhjort]], thereby winning her as his wife. The unusual protective clothes that Ragnar wore, when attacking the serpent, earned him the nickname Lodbrok (\"shaggy breeches\"). His sons with Thora were [[Erik Weatherhat|Erik]] and Agnar. After Thora died, he discovered [[Aslaug|Kr\u00e1ka]], a woman of outstanding beauty and wisdom living with a poor peasant couple in [[Norway]], and married her. This marriage resulted in the sons [[Ivar the Boneless]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Ironside]], [[Hvitserk]], Ragnvald and [[Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye]].<ref>''Ragnars Saga Lodbrokar'', Chapters 4 and 7 [https://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/ragnar.htm]</ref> Kr\u00e1ka was later revealed to actually be [[Aslaug]], a secret daughter of the renowned hero [[Sigurd|Sigurd Fafnesbane]]. As the sons grew up to become renowned warriors, Ragnar, not wishing to be outdone, resolved to conquer [[England]] with merely two ships. He was however defeated by superior English forces and was thrown into a snake pit to die in agony.<ref>''Ragnars Saga Lodbrokar'', Chapter 15 [https://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/ragnar.htm]</ref> The ''[[Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok]]'', ''[[Tale of Ragnar's Sons]]'', and ''[[Heimskringla]]'' all tell of the [[Great Heathen Army]] that invaded England at around 866, led by the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok to wreak revenge against King [[\u00c6lla of Northumbria]] who is told to have captured and executed Ragnar.\n\n=== Danish sources ===\nThe ''[[Chronicon Roskildense]]'' (c. 1138) mentions Lodbrok (Lothpardus) as father to the utterly cruel Norse King Ywar (rex crudelissimus Normannorum Ywar) and his brothers, Inguar (a double of Ywar), Ubbi, Byorn and Ulf, who rule the northern peoples. They call on the various Danish petty kings to help them ruin the realm of the [[Franks]]. Ywar successfully attacks the kingdoms of [[Great Britain|Britain]], though not as an act of revenge as in the Icelandic sagas.<ref>''Chronicon Roskildense'', p. 16[https://archive.org/stream/scriptoresminore112gert#page/16/mode/2up]</ref> The chronicle of [[Sven Aggesen]] (c. 1190) is the first Danish text that mentions the full name, Regnerus Lothbrogh. His son Sigurd invades Denmark and kills its king, whose daughter he marries as he takes over the throne. Their son in turn is [[Hardeknud I|Knut]], ancestor of the later Danish kings.<ref>Sven Aggeson, p. 106[https://archive.org/stream/scriptoresminore112gert#page/106/mode/2up]</ref> \n\nNeither of these sources mentions Ragnar Lodbrok as a Danish ruler. The first to do so is [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in his work ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' (c. 1200). This work mixes Norse legend with data about Danish history derived from the chronicle of [[Adam of Bremen]] (c. 1075).<ref>Storm (1877), p. 387-9 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639&view=1up&seq=399] </ref> Here Ragnar's father Sigurd Ring is a Norwegian prince married to a Danish princess, and different from the victor of Br\u00e1vellir (who had flourished about thirteen generations earlier). Sigurd Ring and his cousin and rival Ring (that is, [[Sigfred (Danish king 812)|Sigfred]] and [[Anulo]] of recorded history, d. 812) are both killed in battle, whereupon Ragnar is elevated to the Danish kingship (identified by Saxo with [[Reginfrid|Ragnfred]], d. 814<ref>Storm (1877), p. 399 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639&view=1up&seq=411]</ref>).<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 539-41 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/541]</ref>  His first deed is the defeat of the Swedish king Fr\u00f6, who has killed Ragnar's grandfather. Ragnar is assisted in this by the ferocious shield-maiden [[Ladgerda]], whom he forces to marry him. In this marriage he sires the son Fridleif and two daughters.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 542-3 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/543]</ref>  He later repudiates the unreliable Ladgerda and instead wins the daughter of the Swedish king [[Herrau\u00f0r]], [[Thora Borgarhjort|Thora]], after killing two venomous giant snakes that guard her residence. His sons with Thora are Radbard, Dunvat, [[Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Ironside]], Agnar and [[Ivar the Boneless]]. From a non-marital affair with the daughter of one Esbj\u00f8rn, Ragnar begets [[Ubba|Ubbe]], while his last marriage with Svanlaug produces another three sons, Ragnvald, [[Eric Weatherhat]] and [[Hvitserk]].<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 545, 550 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/550]</ref> \n\nThe sons were installed as sub-kings in various conquered territories. Ragnar led a Viking expedition to England and slew its king Hama, proceeding to kill the earls of [[Scotland]] and install Sigurd Snake-in-the Eye and Radbard as governors. Norway was also subjugated, and Fridleif was made ruler there and in [[Orkney]]. Later on, Ragnar with three sons invaded Sweden where a new king called S\u00f6rle had appeared and withheld the heritage of Thora's sons. S\u00f6rle and his army were massacred and Bj\u00f6rn Ironside was installed on the throne.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 551 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/551]</ref>  Some time later Bj\u00f6rn was put in charge of Norway, while Ragnar appointed another son, Eric Weatherhat, as ruler in Sweden; he was subsequently killed by a certain [[Eysteinn Beli|Eysteinn]]. One of the sons, Ubbe, revolted against his father at the instigation of his maternal grandfather Esbj\u00f8rn, and could only be defeated and captured with utmost effort.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 557 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/557]</ref> Saxo moreover tells of repeated expeditions to the [[British Isles]], one of which cost the lives of Dunvat and Radbard. \u00c6lla, son of Hama, expelled Ragnar's sub-ruler Ivar the Boneless from England with the help of the Galli (Gaill, Hiberno-Norse?<ref>Smyth (1977).</ref>) and remained a persistent enemy.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 560-1 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/560]</ref> Finally, the [[Scythians]] were forced to accept Hvitserk as their ruler. In the end Hvitserk was treacherously captured by the [[Hellespontus (province)|Hellespontian]] prince Daxon and burnt alive with his own admission. Hearing this, Ragnar led an expedition to [[Kievan Rus']] and captured Daxon who was curiously spared and exiled.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 558-9 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/558]</ref> \n\nUnlike the Icelandic sources, Saxo's account of Ragnar Lodbrok's reign is largely a catalog of successful Viking invasions over an enormous geographical area. Among the seaborne expeditions was one against the [[Bjarmians]] and [[Finns]] ([[Sami people|Saami]]) in the Arctic north. The Bjarmian use of magic spells caused foul weather and the sudden death of many Danish invaders, and the Finnish archers on skis turned out to be a formidable foe. Eventually these two tribes were put to flight and the Bjarmian king was slain.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 558-9 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/554]</ref> The historical king [[Harald Klak]] is by Saxo (based on a passage in Adam's chronicle) made into another persistent enemy of Ragnar, who several times incited the [[Jutes]] and [[Sk\u00e5ne|Scanians]] to rebel, but was regularly defeated. After the last victory over Harald, Ragnar learned that King \u00c6lla had massacred Ragnar's men on [[Ireland]]. Incensed, he attacked the English king with his fleet but was captured and thrown into the snake pit, similar to the Icelandic sagas. In spite of all his praise for Ragnar Lodbrok, Saxo also considers his fate as God's rightful vengeance for the contempt he had shown the Christian religion.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 562-3 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/563]</ref>\n\n=== Poetic and epigraphic sources ===\nWhile the narrative Norse sources date from the 12th and 13th centuries, there are also many older poems that mention him and his kin. The ''[[Ragnarsdr\u00e1pa]]'', ostensibly composed by [[Bragi Boddason]] in the 9th century, praises a Ragnar, son of Sigurd, for a richly decorated shield that the poet has received. The shield depicts the assault on [[Ermanaric|J\u00f6rmunrek]], the [[Hja\u00f0ningav\u00edg]] tale, the ploughing of [[Gefjon]], and [[Thor]]'s struggle with the [[Midgard Serpent]]. Recent scholarship has suggested that the poem is in fact from c. 1000 and celebrates the Norse reconquest of England. The four tales depicted on the shield would then symbolize four aspects of the Lodbrok saga (the initial defeat of the sons of Lodbrok in England due to recklessness, Ivar the Boneless's deceitful approach to King \u00c6lla, Ivar's cunning snatching of land from \u00c6lla, Ragnar's struggle against the giant serpent in order to win Thora).<ref>\"Ragnarsdr\u00e1pa\", ''Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde'', Vol. 24, p. 115.</ref> The ''Knutsdrapa'' of [[Sigvat Thordarson]] (c. 1038) mentions the death of \u00c6lla at the hands of Ivar in [[York]], who \"carved the eagle on \u00c6lla's back\".<ref>Smyth (1977), p. 193-4.</ref> From this the story of the atrocious revenge of Lodbrok's sons already seems to be present. The reference to a \"[[blood eagle]]\" punishment has however been much debated by modern scholars.<ref>[[Rory McTurk]], \"Kings and kingship in Viking Northumbria\", [https://web.archive.org/web/20080926171200/http://www.dur.ac.uk/medieval.www/sagaconf/mcturk.htm]</ref> Another lay, ''[[Krakumal]]'', put in the mouth of the dying Ragnar in the snake pit, recounts the exploits of Ragnar and mentions battles over a wide geographical area, several relating to the British isles. The poem's name, \"Kr\u00e1ka's lay\", alludes to Ragnar's wife's [[Aslaug|Kr\u00e1ka]],<ref>\"Kr\u00e1kum\u00e1l\", ''Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde'', Vol. 17 (2001), p. 299-300.</ref> though modern philologists commonly date it to the 12th century in its present form.<ref>Smyth (1977), p. 73-80.</ref> \n\nThere is one runic inscription mentioning Lodbrok, carved on the prehistorical tumulus of [[Maeshowe]] on [[Orkney]] in the early 12th century. It reads: \"This howe was built a long time before Lodbrok's. Her sons, they were bold; scarcely ever were there such tall men of their hands\".<ref>Smyth (1977), p. 81.</ref> The expression \"her sons\" has given rise to the theory that Lodbrok was originally thought of as a woman,<ref>Gustav Storm (1877), \"Ragnar Lodbrok og Lodbrokss\u00f8nnerne; studie i dansk oldhistorie og nordisk sagnhistorie\", ''Historisk Tidskrift'' II:1 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639;view=1up;seq=419]</ref> mother of the historically known sons.<ref>[[Rory McTurk]], \"Kings and kingship in Viking Northumbria\", [https://web.archive.org/web/20080926171200/http://www.dur.ac.uk/medieval.www/sagaconf/mcturk.htm]; </ref>\n\n=== Frankish accounts of a 9th-century Viking leader named Ragnar ===\nThe [[Siege of Paris (845)|Siege of Paris]] and the Sack of Paris of 845 was the culmination of a Viking invasion of the kingdom of the [[West Francia|West Franks]]. The Viking forces were led by a Norse chieftain named \"Reginherus\", or Ragnar.{{Sfn | Kohn | 2006 | p = 588}}  This Ragnar has often been tentatively identified with the legendary saga figure Ragnar Lodbrok,<ref>''Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde'', Vol. 24, p. 111, 113, 116.</ref> but the accuracy of this is disputed by historians.{{Sfn | Jones | 2001 | p = 212}}{{Sfn | Sprague | 2007 | p = 225}} Ragnar Lodbrok is also sometimes identified with a Ragnar who was awarded land in [[Torhout]], [[Flanders]], by [[Charles the Bald]] in about 841 but eventually lost the land as well as the favour of the King.{{Sfn | Sawyer | 2001 | p = 40}}  Ragnar's Vikings raided [[Rouen]] on their way up the Seine in 845  and in response to the invasion, determined not to let the royal [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of Saint-Denis]] (near Paris) be destroyed, Charles assembled an army which he divided into two parts, one for each side of the river.{{Sfn | Duckett | 1988 | p = 181}}{{Sfn | Jones | 2001 |  p = 212}} Ragnar attacked and defeated one of the divisions of the smaller Frankish army, took 111 of their men as prisoners and hanged them on an island on the Seine to honour the [[Norse religion|Norse god]] [[Odin]], as well as to incite terror in the remaining Frankish forces.{{Sfn | Kohn | 2006 | p = 588}}{{Sfn | Jones | 2001 | p = 212}} Ragnar's fleet made it back to his overlord, the Danish King [[Horik I]], but Ragnar soon died from a violent illness that also spread in Denmark.<ref>Storm (1877), p. 438 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639&view=1up&seq=450]</ref>\n\n=== Later continental accounts ===\nAmong the oldest texts to mention the name Lodbrok is the Norman history of [[William of Jumi\u00e8ges]] from c. 1070. According to William, the Danish kings of old had the custom to expel the younger sons from the kingdom to have them out of the way. At a time it happened that King [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Lodbrok]] succeeded his unnamed father on the Danish throne. After gaining power he honoured the said custom and ordered his junior son [[Bj\u00f6rn Ironside]] to leave his realm. Bj\u00f6rn thus left Denmark with a considerable fleet and started to ravage in [[West Francia]] and later the [[Mediterranean]].<ref>Guillaume de Jumi\u00e8ges, ''Histoire des ducs de Normandie'', p. 11-3 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015013753564;view=1up;seq=23]</ref> Roughly contemporary with William is [[Adam of Bremen]] whose history of the [[Archbishopric of Hamburg|Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen]] contains many traditions about Viking Age Scandinavia. In a passage referring to the Viking raids of the late 9th century, he mentions the Danish or Norse pirates Horich, Orwig, Gotafrid, Rudolf and Inguar (Ivar). This Ivar is in particular seen as a cruel persecutor of Christians, and a son of Lodbrok (Inguar, filius Lodparchi).<ref>Adam von Bremen, ''Hamburgische Kirchengeschichte'', p. 39-40[https://archive.org/stream/adamvonbremenham00adam#page/40/mode/2up]</ref>\n\n=== Anglo-Saxon and Irish accounts of the father of Ivar and Halfdan ===\nAccording to the contemporary ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' and [[Asser]]'s ''Life of Alfred'', in 878 the \"brother of Hingwar and Healfden\", with a naval fleet, a contingent of the [[Great Heathen Army]] invaded [[Devon]] in England and fought the [[Battle of Cynwit]]. There the Vikings lost, their king slain and many dead, with few escaping to their ships. After the battle the [[Saxons]] took great plunder, and among other things the banner called \"Raven\".<ref>Garmonsway, G.N. (1972), ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''. London: Dent, p. 75-7.</ref> The early 12th century ''[[Annals of St Neots]]'' further state that ''\"they say that the three sisters of Hingwar and Hubba, daughters of Lodebroch (Lodbrok), wove that flag and got it ready in one day. They say, moreover, that in every battle, wherever the flag went before them, if they were to gain the victory a live crow would appear flying on the middle of the flag; but if they were doomed to be defeated it would hang down motionless, and this was often proved to be so.\"''<ref>Garmonsway, G.N. (1972), ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''. London: Dent, p. 77.</ref>\nThis is among the earlier references to the legendary hero Ragnar Lodbrok.\n\nThe Irish ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]]'' from the 12th century, with information deriving from earlier annals, mentions king Halfdan (d. 877) under the name \"mac Ragnaill\".<ref>James Todd (1867), ''Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh'', London: Longman, p. 27 [https://archive.org/details/cogadhgaedhelreg00todd/page/26/mode/2up]</ref> The form Ragnall may refer to either Ragnvald or Ragnar, and the entry is a strong indication that the name of Ivar's and Halfdan's father was really Ragnar or a similar name.<ref>Smyth, Alfred P. (1977) ''Scandinavian kings in the British Isles 850-880''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 263, 279.</ref> The early 11th century ''[[Three Fragments]]'' contains a passage that gives a semi-legendary background to the capture of York by the Vikings in 866. The two younger sons of Halfdan, King of [[Lochlann]], expelled the eldest son Ragnall who sailed to the [[Orkney islands]] with his three sons and settled there. Two of the sons later raided the English and [[Franks]], proceeding to plunder in the Mediterranean. One of them learnt from a vision that Ragnall had fought a battle where the third son had been slain and in which he himself had most likely perished. The two Viking sons then returned home with a lot of dark-skinned captives.<ref>Smyth, Alfred P. (1977) ''Scandinavian kings in the British Isles 850-880''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 62.</ref> It has been hypothesized that this is an Irish version of ''[[Ragnar Lodbrok's saga]]'', the Mediterranean expedition being a historical event taking place in 859-61.<ref>Smyth, Alfred P.

Modern academia regards most of the stories about him to be fiction. According to [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]], writing in 1979,\n\n<blockquote>Certain scholars in recent years have come to accept at least part of Ragnar's story as based on historical fact.<ref>Davidson p. 277</ref></blockquote> A generation later, however, Katherine Holman wrote in 2003: <blockquote>Although his sons are historical figures, there is no evidence that Ragnar himself ever lived and he seems to be an amalgam of historical figures and literary invention.<ref name=\"Z\">Holman 2003 p. 220</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe most significant medieval sources that mention Ragnar include:\n* Book IX of the ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', a 12th-century work by the Christian Danish chronicler [[Saxo Grammaticus]]\n* the ''[[Tale of Ragnar's Sons|Tale of Ragnar's sons]]'' (''Ragnarssona \u00fe\u00e1ttr''), a [[legendary saga]]\n* the ''[[Tale of Ragnar Lothbrok ]]'', another saga, a sequel to the ''[[V\u00f6lsunga saga]]''\n* the ''[[Ragnarsdr\u00e1pa]]'', a [[skaldic poem]] of which only fragments remain, attributed to the 9th-century poet [[Bragi Boddason]]\n* the ''[[Kr\u00e1kum\u00e1l]]'', Ragnar's death-song, an old and mysterious skaldic poem\n\nIn her commentary on Saxo's ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', Davidson notes that Saxo's coverage of Ragnar's legend in book IX of the ''Gesta'' appears to be an attempt to consolidate many of the confusing and contradictory events and stories known to the chronicler into the reign of one king, Ragnar. That is why many acts ascribed to Ragnar in the ''Gesta'' can be associated, through other sources, with various figures, some of whom are more historically tenable.<ref>Davidson p. 277</ref>\n\nThe candidates scholars like to associate with the \"historical Ragnar\" include:\n* the ''Reginherus'' or ''Ragnar'' who [[Siege of Paris (845)|besieged Paris]] in 845\n* the Danish King [[Horik I]] (d. 854)\n* King [[Reginfrid]] (d. 814), a king who ruled part of Denmark in tandem with his brother [[Harald Klak]], but was expelled by Horik I and his brothers and later fell in a battle against them\n* possibly the [[Rognvald Eysteinsson|Ragnall]] (Ragnvald or Ragnar) of the [[Irish Annals]]{{sfn|Davidson|1980|p=277}}\n\nAttempts to reliably associate the legendary Ragnar with one or several of those men have failed because of the difficulty in reconciling the various accounts and their chronology. But the tradition of a Viking hero named Ragnar (or similar) who wreaked havoc in mid-[[9th-century]] Europe and who fathered many famous sons is remarkably persistent, and some aspects of it are strengthened by relatively reliable sources, such as Irish historical tradition and, indirectly, the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''.<ref>Smyth (1977).</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n{{in popular culture|date=January 2020}}\nRagnar Lodbrok features prominently in the following works:\n* [[Edwin Atherstone]]'s 1830 novel ''Sea-Kings in England''.\n* [[Edison Marshall]]'s 1951 novel ''The Viking''.<ref>Historical Novels.info [http://www.historicalnovels.info/Viking.html]</ref>\n* \"[[:fr:Ragnar le Viking|Ragnar le Viking]]\", a 1955 comic book feature written by Jean Ollivier with art by Eduardo Teixeira Coelho, that ran in the French ''[[Pif Gadget|Vaillant]]'' magazine up to 1969.<ref>BD oubli\u00e9es [https://www.bdoubliees.com/vaillantpif/series5/ragnar.htm]</ref>\n* Richard Parker's 1957 historical novel ''The Sword of [[Ganelon]]'' explores the character of Ragnar, his sons, and Viking raiding culture.<ref>Kirkus Review [https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/richard-parker-4/the-sword-of-ganelon/]</ref>\n* The 1958 film ''[[The Vikings (1958 film)|The Vikings]]'' based on Marshall's novel, in which Ragnar, played by [[Ernest Borgnine]], is captured by King \u00c6lla and cast into a pit of wolves; a son named Einar {{sic}}, played by [[Kirk Douglas]], vows revenge and conquers [[Northumbria]] with help from half-brother (and sworn enemy) Eric (played by [[Tony Curtis]]), who also had much to avenge upon King Aella.\n* [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s 1993 alternative history novel ''[[The Hammer and the Cross]]'' depicts Ragnar being shipwrecked, captured and executed, as well as his sons' revenge.<ref>Publisher's Weekly, review [https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-312-85439-3]</ref>\n* [[History (Canadian TV network)|History]]'s popular 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]''.

According to the traditional literature, Ragnar Lodbrok distinguished himself by many raids against the [[British Isles]] and [[Holy Roman Empire]] during the 9th century. According to the sagas Ragnar Lodbrok's father was the [[Legendary Kings of Sweden|legendary Swedish king]] [[Sigurd Ring]]. <ref>https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/Ragnar-Lothbrok/</ref>\n\n== Accounts ==\n=== The Icelandic Sagas ===\nAccording to the ''[[Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok]]'', ''[[Tale of Ragnar's sons]]'', ''[[Heimskringla]]'', ''[[Hervarar Saga]]'', ''[[S\u00f6gubrot]]'', and many other Icelandic sources, Ragnar was the son of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] king [[Sigurd Ring]]. Nearly all of the sagas agree that [[Randver]] was Sigurd's father, with the ''[[Hervarar saga]]'' citing his wife as \u00c5sa, the daughter of King [[Harald Granraude|Harald of the Red Moustache]] from Norway. The accounts further tell that Randver was a grandson of the legendary Scandinavian king [[Ivar Vidfamne]] by his daughter Aud (whom the ''[[Hervarar saga]]'' calls Alfhild).<ref>Tolkien, Christopher, & Turville-Petre, G. (eds) (1956) ''Hervarar Saga ok Heidreks''. London: Viking Society for Northern Research, p. 68-9. [http://www.vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/Text%20Series/Hervarar%20saga%20ok%20heidreks.pdf]\n</ref> After the death of king [[Ivar Vidfamne]], Aud's eldest son by the [[Danes|Danish]] king [[Hr\u0153rekr Ringslinger]], Harald, conquered all of his grandfather's territory and became known as [[Harald Wartooth]]. Harald's nephew [[Sigurd Ring]] became the chief king of Sweden after Randver's death (Denmark according to ''Hervarar saga''), presumably as the subking of Harald. Sigurd and Harald fought the Battle of the Br\u00e1vellir ([[Br\u00e5valla]]) on the plains of [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]], where Harald and many of his men died. Sigurd then ruled Sweden and Denmark (being sometimes identified with a Danish king [[Sigfred]] who ruled from about 770 until his death prior to 804). He sired a son with the Norwegian princess Alfhild of the semi-mythical \u00c1lfar people, Ragnar Lodbrok, who succeeded him.<ref>''S\u00f6gubrot'', Chapter 10 [https://web.archive.org/web/20100908081803/http://www.oe.eclipse.co.uk/nom/Fragment.htm]</ref> [[Eysteinn Beli]], who according to the ''[[Hervarar Saga]]'' was Harald Wartooth's son, ruled Sweden sometime after Sigurd until he was slain by the sons of Ragnar and [[Aslaug]].<ref>''The Tale of Ragnar's Sons'', Chapter 2 [http://www.germanicmythology.com/FORNALDARSAGAS/ThattrRagnarsSonar.html]</ref> \n\nIn their accounts of his reign, the Icelandic sagas tell more about Ragnar's marriages than about feats of warfare. According to the ''[[Sogubrot|S\u00f6gubrot]]'', \"he was the biggest and fairest of men that human eyes have seen, and he was like his mother in appearance and took after her kin\".<ref>''S\u00f6gubrot'', Chapter 10 [[https://web.archive.org/web/20100908081803/http://www.oe.eclipse.co.uk/nom/Fragment.htm]</ref> He first killed a giant snake that guarded the abode of the [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland|East Geatic]] jarl's daughter [[Thora Borgarhjort]], thereby winning her as his wife. The unusual protective clothes that Ragnar wore, when attacking the serpent, earned him the nickname Lodbrok (\"shaggy breeches\"). His sons with Thora were [[Erik Weatherhat|Erik]] and Agnar. After Thora died, he discovered [[Aslaug|Kr\u00e1ka]], a woman of outstanding beauty and wisdom living with a poor peasant couple in [[Norway]], and married her. This marriage resulted in the sons [[Ivar the Boneless]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Ironside]], [[Hvitserk]], Ragnvald and [[Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye]].<ref>''Ragnars Saga Lodbrokar'', Chapters 4 and 7 [https://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/ragnar.htm]</ref> Kr\u00e1ka was later revealed to actually be [[Aslaug]], a secret daughter of the renowned hero [[Sigurd|Sigurd Fafnesbane]]. As the sons grew up to become renowned warriors, Ragnar, not wishing to be outdone, resolved to conquer [[England]] with merely two ships. He was however defeated by superior English forces and was thrown into a snake pit to die in agony.<ref>''Ragnars Saga Lodbrokar'', Chapter 15 [https://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/ragnar.htm]</ref> The ''[[Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok]]'', ''[[Tale of Ragnar's Sons]]'', and ''[[Heimskringla]]'' all tell of the [[Great Heathen Army]] that invaded England at around 866, led by the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok to wreak revenge against King [[\u00c6lla of Northumbria]] who is told to have captured and executed Ragnar.\n\n=== Danish sources ===\nThe ''[[Chronicon Roskildense]]'' (c. 1138) mentions Lodbrok (Lothpardus) as father to the utterly cruel Norse King Ywar (rex crudelissimus Normannorum Ywar) and his brothers, Inguar (a double of Ywar), Ubbi, Byorn and Ulf, who rule the northern peoples. They call on the various Danish petty kings to help them ruin the realm of the [[Franks]]. Ywar successfully attacks the kingdoms of [[Great Britain|Britain]], though not as an act of revenge as in the Icelandic sagas.<ref>''Chronicon Roskildense'', p. 16[https://archive.org/stream/scriptoresminore112gert#page/16/mode/2up]</ref> The chronicle of [[Sven Aggesen]] (c. 1190) is the first Danish text that mentions the full name, Regnerus Lothbrogh. His son Sigurd invades Denmark and kills its king, whose daughter he marries as he takes over the throne. Their son in turn is [[Hardeknud I|Knut]], ancestor of the later Danish kings.<ref>Sven Aggeson, p. 106[https://archive.org/stream/scriptoresminore112gert#page/106/mode/2up]</ref> \n\nNeither of these sources mentions Ragnar Lodbrok as a Danish ruler. The first to do so is [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in his work ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' (c. 1200). This work mixes Norse legend with data about Danish history derived from the chronicle of [[Adam of Bremen]] (c. 1075).<ref>Storm (1877), p. 387-9 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639&view=1up&seq=399] </ref> Here Ragnar's father Sigurd Ring is a Norwegian prince married to a Danish princess, and different from the victor of Br\u00e1vellir (who had flourished about thirteen generations earlier). Sigurd Ring and his cousin and rival Ring (that is, [[Sigfred (Danish king 812)|Sigfred]] and [[Anulo]] of recorded history, d. 812) are both killed in battle, whereupon Ragnar is elevated to the Danish kingship (identified by Saxo with [[Reginfrid|Ragnfred]], d. 814<ref>Storm (1877), p. 399 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639&view=1up&seq=411]</ref>).<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 539-41 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/541]</ref>  His first deed is the defeat of the Swedish king Fr\u00f6, who has killed Ragnar's grandfather. Ragnar is assisted in this by the ferocious shield-maiden [[Ladgerda]], whom he forces to marry him. In this marriage he sires the son Fridleif and two daughters.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 542-3 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/543]</ref>  He later repudiates the unreliable Ladgerda and instead wins the daughter of the Swedish king [[Herrau\u00f0r]], [[Thora Borgarhjort|Thora]], after killing two venomous giant snakes that guard her residence. His sons with Thora are Radbard, Dunvat, [[Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Ironside]], Agnar and [[Ivar the Boneless]]. From a non-marital affair with the daughter of one Esbj\u00f8rn, Ragnar begets [[Ubba|Ubbe]], while his last marriage with Svanlaug produces another three sons, Ragnvald, [[Eric Weatherhat]] and [[Hvitserk]].<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 545, 550 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/550]</ref> \n\nThe sons were installed as sub-kings in various conquered territories. Ragnar led a Viking expedition to England and slew its king Hama, proceeding to kill the earls of [[Scotland]] and install Sigurd Snake-in-the Eye and Radbard as governors. Norway was also subjugated, and Fridleif was made ruler there and in [[Orkney]]. Later on, Ragnar with three sons invaded Sweden where a new king called S\u00f6rle had appeared and withheld the heritage of Thora's sons. S\u00f6rle and his army were massacred and Bj\u00f6rn Ironside was installed on the throne.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 551 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/551]</ref>  Some time later Bj\u00f6rn was put in charge of Norway, while Ragnar appointed another son, Eric Weatherhat, as ruler in Sweden; he was subsequently killed by a certain [[Eysteinn Beli|Eysteinn]]. One of the sons, Ubbe, revolted against his father at the instigation of his maternal grandfather Esbj\u00f8rn, and could only be defeated and captured with utmost effort.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 557 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/557]</ref> Saxo moreover tells of repeated expeditions to the [[British Isles]], one of which cost the lives of Dunvat and Radbard. \u00c6lla, son of Hama, expelled Ragnar's sub-ruler Ivar the Boneless from England with the help of the Galli (Gaill, Hiberno-Norse?<ref>Smyth (1977).</ref>) and remained a persistent enemy.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 560-1 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/560]</ref> Finally, the [[Scythians]] were forced to accept Hvitserk as their ruler. In the end Hvitserk was treacherously captured by the [[Hellespontus (province)|Hellespontian]] prince Daxon and burnt alive with his own admission. Hearing this, Ragnar led an expedition to [[Kievan Rus']] and captured Daxon who was curiously spared and exiled.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 558-9 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/558]</ref> \n\nUnlike the Icelandic sources, Saxo's account of Ragnar Lodbrok's reign is largely a catalog of successful Viking invasions over an enormous geographical area. Among the seaborne expeditions was one against the [[Bjarmians]] and [[Finns]] ([[Sami people|Saami]]) in the Arctic north. The Bjarmian use of magic spells caused foul weather and the sudden death of many Danish invaders, and the Finnish archers on skis turned out to be a formidable foe. Eventually these two tribes were put to flight and the Bjarmian king was slain.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 558-9 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/554]</ref> The historical king [[Harald Klak]] is by Saxo (based on a passage in Adam's chronicle) made into another persistent enemy of Ragnar, who several times incited the [[Jutes]] and [[Sk\u00e5ne|Scanians]] to rebel, but was regularly defeated. After the last victory over Harald, Ragnar learned that King \u00c6lla had massacred Ragnar's men on [[Ireland]]. Incensed, he attacked the English king with his fleet but was captured and thrown into the snake pit, similar to the Icelandic sagas. In spite of all his praise for Ragnar Lodbrok, Saxo also considers his fate as God's rightful vengeance for the contempt he had shown the Christian religion.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 562-3 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/563]</ref>\n\n=== Poetic and epigraphic sources ===\nWhile the narrative Norse sources date from the 12th and 13th centuries, there are also many older poems that mention him and his kin. The ''[[Ragnarsdr\u00e1pa]]'', ostensibly composed by [[Bragi Boddason]] in the 9th century, praises a Ragnar, son of Sigurd, for a richly decorated shield that the poet has received. The shield depicts the assault on [[Ermanaric|J\u00f6rmunrek]], the [[Hja\u00f0ningav\u00edg]] tale, the ploughing of [[Gefjon]], and [[Thor]]'s struggle with the [[Midgard Serpent]]. Recent scholarship has suggested that the poem is in fact from c. 1000 and celebrates the Norse reconquest of England. The four tales depicted on the shield would then symbolize four aspects of the Lodbrok saga (the initial defeat of the sons of Lodbrok in England due to recklessness, Ivar the Boneless's deceitful approach to King \u00c6lla, Ivar's cunning snatching of land from \u00c6lla, Ragnar's struggle against the giant serpent in order to win Thora).<ref>\"Ragnarsdr\u00e1pa\", ''Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde'', Vol. 24, p. 115.</ref> The ''Knutsdrapa'' of [[Sigvat Thordarson]] (c. 1038) mentions the death of \u00c6lla at the hands of Ivar in [[York]], who \"carved the eagle on \u00c6lla's back\".<ref>Smyth (1977), p. 193-4.</ref> From this the story of the atrocious revenge of Lodbrok's sons already seems to be present. The reference to a \"[[blood eagle]]\" punishment has however been much debated by modern scholars.<ref>[[Rory McTurk]], \"Kings and kingship in Viking Northumbria\", [https://web.archive.org/web/20080926171200/http://www.dur.ac.uk/medieval.www/sagaconf/mcturk.htm]</ref> Another lay, ''[[Krakumal]]'', put in the mouth of the dying Ragnar in the snake pit, recounts the exploits of Ragnar and mentions battles over a wide geographical area, several relating to the British isles. The poem's name, \"Kr\u00e1ka's lay\", alludes to Ragnar's wife's [[Aslaug|Kr\u00e1ka]],<ref>\"Kr\u00e1kum\u00e1l\", ''Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde'', Vol. 17 (2001), p. 299-300.</ref> though modern philologists commonly date it to the 12th century in its present form.<ref>Smyth (1977), p. 73-80.</ref> \n\nThere is one runic inscription mentioning Lodbrok, carved on the prehistorical tumulus of [[Maeshowe]] on [[Orkney]] in the early 12th century.

The Viking forces were led by a Norse chieftain named \"Reginherus\", or Ragnar.{{Sfn | Kohn | 2006 | p = 588}}  This Ragnar has often been tentatively identified with the legendary saga figure Ragnar Lodbrok,<ref>''Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde'', Vol. 24, p. 111, 113, 116.</ref> but the accuracy of this is disputed by historians.{{Sfn | Jones | 2001 | p = 212}}{{Sfn | Sprague | 2007 | p = 225}} Ragnar Lodbrok is also sometimes identified with a Ragnar who was awarded land in [[Torhout]], [[Flanders]], by [[Charles the Bald]] in about 841 but eventually lost the land as well as the favour of the King.{{Sfn | Sawyer | 2001 | p = 40}}  Ragnar's Vikings raided [[Rouen]] on their way up the Seine in 845  and in response to the invasion, determined not to let the royal [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of Saint-Denis]] (near Paris) be destroyed, Charles assembled an army which he divided into two parts, one for each side of the river.{{Sfn | Duckett | 1988 | p = 181}}{{Sfn | Jones | 2001 |  p = 212}} Ragnar attacked and defeated one of the divisions of the smaller Frankish army, took 111 of their men as prisoners and hanged them on an island on the Seine to honour the [[Norse religion|Norse god]] [[Odin]], as well as to incite terror in the remaining Frankish forces.{{Sfn | Kohn | 2006 | p = 588}}{{Sfn | Jones | 2001 | p = 212}} Ragnar's fleet made it back to his overlord, the Danish King [[Horik I]], but Ragnar soon died from a violent illness that also spread in Denmark.<ref>Storm (1877), p. 438 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639&view=1up&seq=450]</ref>\n\n=== Later continental accounts ===\nAmong the oldest texts to mention the name Lodbrok is the Norman history of [[William of Jumi\u00e8ges]] from c. 1070. According to William, the Danish kings of old had the custom to expel the younger sons from the kingdom to have them out of the way. At a time it happened that King [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Lodbrok]] succeeded his unnamed father on the Danish throne. After gaining power he honoured the said custom and ordered his junior son [[Bj\u00f6rn Ironside]] to leave his realm. Bj\u00f6rn thus left Denmark with a considerable fleet and started to ravage in [[West Francia]] and later the [[Mediterranean]].<ref>Guillaume de Jumi\u00e8ges, ''Histoire des ducs de Normandie'', p. 11-3 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015013753564;view=1up;seq=23]</ref> Roughly contemporary with William is [[Adam of Bremen]] whose history of the [[Archbishopric of Hamburg|Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen]] contains many traditions about Viking Age Scandinavia. In a passage referring to the Viking raids of the late 9th century, he mentions the Danish or Norse pirates Horich, Orwig, Gotafrid, Rudolf and Inguar (Ivar). This Ivar is in particular seen as a cruel persecutor of Christians, and a son of Lodbrok (Inguar, filius Lodparchi).<ref>Adam von Bremen, ''Hamburgische Kirchengeschichte'', p. 39-40[https://archive.org/stream/adamvonbremenham00adam#page/40/mode/2up]</ref>\n\n=== Anglo-Saxon and Irish accounts of the father of Ivar and Halfdan ===\nAccording to the contemporary ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' and [[Asser]]'s ''Life of Alfred'', in 878 the \"brother of Hingwar and Healfden\", with a naval fleet, a contingent of the [[Great Heathen Army]] invaded [[Devon]] in England and fought the [[Battle of Cynwit]]. There the Vikings lost, their king slain and many dead, with few escaping to their ships. After the battle the [[Saxons]] took great plunder, and among other things the banner called \"Raven\".<ref>Garmonsway, G.N. (1972), ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''. London: Dent, p. 75-7.</ref> The early 12th century ''[[Annals of St Neots]]'' further state that ''\"they say that the three sisters of Hingwar and Hubba, daughters of Lodebroch (Lodbrok), wove that flag and got it ready in one day. They say, moreover, that in every battle, wherever the flag went before them, if they were to gain the victory a live crow would appear flying on the middle of the flag; but if they were doomed to be defeated it would hang down motionless, and this was often proved to be so.\"''<ref>Garmonsway, G.N. (1972), ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''. London: Dent, p. 77.</ref>\nThis is among the earlier references to the legendary hero Ragnar Lodbrok.\n\nThe Irish ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]]'' from the 12th century, with information deriving from earlier annals, mentions king Halfdan (d. 877) under the name \"mac Ragnaill\".<ref>James Todd (1867), ''Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh'', London: Longman, p. 27 [https://archive.org/details/cogadhgaedhelreg00todd/page/26/mode/2up]</ref> The form Ragnall may refer to either Ragnvald or Ragnar, and the entry is a strong indication that the name of Ivar's and Halfdan's father was really Ragnar or a similar name.<ref>Smyth, Alfred P. (1977) ''Scandinavian kings in the British Isles 850-880''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 263, 279.</ref> The early 11th century ''[[Three Fragments]]'' contains a passage that gives a semi-legendary background to the capture of York by the Vikings in 866. The two younger sons of Halfdan, King of [[Lochlann]], expelled the eldest son Ragnall who sailed to the [[Orkney islands]] with his three sons and settled there. Two of the sons later raided the English and [[Franks]], proceeding to plunder in the Mediterranean. One of them learnt from a vision that Ragnall had fought a battle where the third son had been slain and in which he himself had most likely perished. The two Viking sons then returned home with a lot of dark-skinned captives.<ref>Smyth, Alfred P. (1977) ''Scandinavian kings in the British Isles 850-880''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 62.</ref> It has been hypothesized that this is an Irish version of ''[[Ragnar Lodbrok's saga]]'', the Mediterranean expedition being a historical event taking place in 859-61.<ref>Smyth, Alfred P.

Modern academia regards most of the stories about him to be fiction. According to [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]], writing in 1979,\n\n<blockquote>Certain scholars in recent years have come to accept at least part of Ragnar's story as based on historical fact.<ref>Davidson p. 277</ref></blockquote> A generation later, however, Katherine Holman wrote in 2003: <blockquote>Although his sons are historical figures, there is no evidence that Ragnar himself ever lived and he seems to be an amalgam of historical figures and literary invention.<ref name=\"Z\">Holman 2003 p. 220</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe most significant medieval sources that mention Ragnar include:\n* Book IX of the ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', a 12th-century work by the Christian Danish chronicler [[Saxo Grammaticus]]\n* the ''[[Tale of Ragnar's Sons|Tale of Ragnar's sons]]'' (''Ragnarssona \u00fe\u00e1ttr''), a [[legendary saga]]\n* the ''[[Tale of Ragnar Lothbrok ]]'', another saga, a sequel to the ''[[V\u00f6lsunga saga]]''\n* the ''[[Ragnarsdr\u00e1pa]]'', a [[skaldic poem]] of which only fragments remain, attributed to the 9th-century poet [[Bragi Boddason]]\n* the ''[[Kr\u00e1kum\u00e1l]]'', Ragnar's death-song, an old and mysterious skaldic poem\n\nIn her commentary on Saxo's ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', Davidson notes that Saxo's coverage of Ragnar's legend in book IX of the ''Gesta'' appears to be an attempt to consolidate many of the confusing and contradictory events and stories known to the chronicler into the reign of one king, Ragnar. That is why many acts ascribed to Ragnar in the ''Gesta'' can be associated, through other sources, with various figures, some of whom are more historically tenable.<ref>Davidson p. 277</ref>\n\nThe candidates scholars like to associate with the \"historical Ragnar\" include:\n* the ''Reginherus'' or ''Ragnar'' who [[Siege of Paris (845)|besieged Paris]] in 845\n* the Danish King [[Horik I]] (d. 854)\n* King [[Reginfrid]] (d. 814), a king who ruled part of Denmark in tandem with his brother [[Harald Klak]], but was expelled by Horik I and his brothers and later fell in a battle against them\n* possibly the [[Rognvald Eysteinsson|Ragnall]] (Ragnvald or Ragnar) of the [[Irish Annals]]{{sfn|Davidson|1980|p=277}}\n\nAttempts to reliably associate the legendary Ragnar with one or several of those men have failed because of the difficulty in reconciling the various accounts and their chronology. But the tradition of a Viking hero named Ragnar (or similar) who wreaked havoc in mid-[[9th-century]] Europe and who fathered many famous sons is remarkably persistent, and some aspects of it are strengthened by relatively reliable sources, such as Irish historical tradition and, indirectly, the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''.<ref>Smyth (1977).</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n{{in popular culture|date=January 2020}}\nRagnar Lodbrok features prominently in the following works:\n* [[Edwin Atherstone]]'s 1830 novel ''Sea-Kings in England''.\n* [[Edison Marshall]]'s 1951 novel ''The Viking''.<ref>Historical Novels.info [http://www.historicalnovels.info/Viking.html]</ref>\n* \"[[:fr:Ragnar le Viking|Ragnar le Viking]]\", a 1955 comic book feature written by Jean Ollivier with art by Eduardo Teixeira Coelho, that ran in the French ''[[Pif Gadget|Vaillant]]'' magazine up to 1969.<ref>BD oubli\u00e9es [https://www.bdoubliees.com/vaillantpif/series5/ragnar.htm]</ref>\n* Richard Parker's 1957 historical novel ''The Sword of [[Ganelon]]'' explores the character of Ragnar, his sons, and Viking raiding culture.<ref>Kirkus Review [https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/richard-parker-4/the-sword-of-ganelon/]</ref>\n* The 1958 film ''[[The Vikings (1958 film)|The Vikings]]'' based on Marshall's novel, in which Ragnar, played by [[Ernest Borgnine]], is captured by King \u00c6lla and cast into a pit of wolves; a son named Einar {{sic}}, played by [[Kirk Douglas]], vows revenge and conquers [[Northumbria]] with help from half-brother (and sworn enemy) Eric (played by [[Tony Curtis]]), who also had much to avenge upon King Aella.\n* [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s 1993 alternative history novel ''[[The Hammer and the Cross]]'' depicts Ragnar being shipwrecked, captured and executed, as well as his sons' revenge.<ref>Publisher's Weekly, review [https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-312-85439-3]</ref>\n* [[History (Canadian TV network)|History]]'s popular 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]''.
