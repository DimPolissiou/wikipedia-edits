The fact that French words are to be found in the ''Book of the Pious'' and that it reflects French conditions caused Gr\u00e4tz also to attribute its authorship to Judah Sir Leon He\u1e24asid. But the reasons given by Gr\u00e4tz are not tenable.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n===Legends of his life===\nLegend describes Judah as an excellent bowman who at the age of eighteen was ignorant of the daily prayers. When, however, enlightenment suddenly came upon him he performed many miracles. He restored fertility to a young married woman. The prophet Elijah is said to have partaken of his \"Seder\" meal and to have been seen by him in a synagogue. He miraculously prevented a Jewish child from being baptized, and knew the exact year of Israel's redemption. He maintained communications with the Bishop of Salzburg and acted as seer for the Duke of Regensburg.<ref>Jellinek, ''B. H.'' vi. 139; Gr\u00fcnbaum, ''J\u00fcdisch-Deutsche Chrestomathie'', p. 385; Br\u00fcll's ''Jahrb.'' ix. 20</ref>\n\n==Writings==\n{{Eras of the Halakha}}\nIt is rather difficult to determine in what the new and important departure ascribed to him by legend consisted, since the obscurity spread over his works is as impenetrable as that surrounding his life. The study of the Talmud, especially as it was treated by his contemporaries, seemed to him fruitless. Still, occasionally a halakhic writing, ''Gan Bosem'', is quoted as his;<ref>comp. Zunz, ''Z. G.'' p. 162</ref> a decision of his is found in ''[[TaSHBa\u1e92]]'', \u00a7 219,<ref>Zunz, l.c. p. 566</ref> in R. [[Isaac ben Moses of Vienna|Isaac]]'s ''Or Zarua' '', and in [[Me\u00efr Rothenburg]]'s collection of responsa;<ref>Zunz, ''Literaturgesch.'' p. 298</ref> and he is found in correspondence with celebrated halakists of his age.\n\nHis commentary on the [[Pentateuch]], written down by his pupils after his lectures, was known only by citations in later commentaries.<ref>Zunz, ''Z. G.'' p. 76 et passim; Luzzatto, ''Kerem \u1e24emed'', vii. 71; ''O\u1e93ar \u1e6cob'', 1878, p. 045</ref> Yet, in 1975, Rabbi I. S. Langa has published Judah's commentary on the [[Pentateuch]], but he was forced to publish a second censored edition, due to revolutionary commentaries of Judah (on Gen. 48:20; Lev. 2:13; Deu. 2:8).<ref>\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05de. \u05ea\u05d0-\u05e9\u05de\u05e2, \u05e2\u05dc \u05d1\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d1\u05d0\u05e9\u05db\u05e0\u05d6 \u05d1\u05d9\u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd, \u05e2\u05de' 273, \u05db\u05e0\u05e1\u05ea \u05de\u05d7\u05e7\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd: \u05e2\u05d9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e8\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1\u05d9\u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd, \u05db\u05e8\u05da \u05d0 : \u05d0\u05e9\u05db\u05e0\u05d6</ref>\n\n===Liturgy===\nHe composed liturgical songs, but the authenticity of those attributed to him is uncertain. As regards his ''Shir Hayichud'' (seven parts; the eighth is called ''Shir HaKavod''), printed in Tiengen, 1560,<ref>Steinschneider, ''Cat. Bodl.'' No. 3313; translated into German in S. Heller's ''Die Echten Hebr\u00e4ischen Melodien'' (ed. Kaufmann)</ref> there is very great divergence of opinion, and the question of its authorship is still undecided. According to Zunz,<ref>''Literaturgesch.'' p. 300</ref> it seems to be genuine, as do also his prayer ''Yechabeh Dim`ati'' and his [[selichot|selicha]] ''Gadol Yichudcha Elohim Beyisrael''. More probably, according to the sources,<ref>see ''Siddur Hegyon Lev'', p. 529, K\u00f6nigsberg, 1845</ref> his father, or a certain Samuel \u1e24azzan, who died as a martyr at [[Erfurt]] in 1121, composed the ''Shir ha-Yi\u1e25ud'', and Judah himself wrote a commentary on it.<ref>Landshuth, '' 'Ammude Ha'Abodah'', p. 77; Epstein, in ''Ha-Goren'', iv. 98</ref> Several prayers are erroneously attributed to Judah; e.g., Zunz wrongly ascribes to him the alphabetical ''te\u1e25innah'' ''Ezkera Yom Moti''.<ref>Steinschneider, l.c.; Landshuth, l.c.</ref> He wrote also commentaries on several parts of the daily prayers and on the Ma\u1e25zor.<ref>Zunz, l.c. p. 301; comp. also Epstein, l.c. pp. 91, 95 et seq.</ref>\n\nJudah collected the notes of travel of his fellow citizen [[Petachiah of Regensburg]], though incompletely and without any order.<ref>Zunz, in Asher's ''Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela'', ii. 253</ref> His chief literary work was an ethical and mystical one. Undoubtedly genuine is his ''Sefer HaKavod'', which is mentioned by his pupils. Although there is some doubt,<ref>comp. Moses Br\u00fcck, ''Rabbinische Ceremonialgebr\u00e4uche in Ihrer Entstehung'', pp. 68 et seq., Breslau, 1837; Abrahams, Ethical Wills, in ''J. Q. R.'' iii. 472</ref> it is generally accepted that the person who wrote  [[ethical will]] ''Tzava'at Rabbi Yehudah Hechasid'', printed in 1583 and translated into Jud\u00e6o-German, Prague, seventeenth to eighteenth century was Harav Yehuda HeChasid Shapiro.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.thehalacha.com/attach/Volume3/Issue7.pdf|author=Moishe Dovid Lebovits|title=The Will of Rav Yehuda Hachasid|magazine=Halachically Speaking|volume=3|issue=7|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110708115422/http://www.thehalacha.com/attach/Volume3/Issue7.pdf|archive-date=July 8, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> This testament contained regulations regarding the dead (\u00a7\u00a7 1-15), the building of houses (\u00a7\u00a7 16-21), matrimony (\u00a7\u00a7 22-32), prohibited marriages between stepbrothers and stepsisters and between cousins, and various customs and superstitious prescriptions (\u00a7\u00a7 33-end).\n\nHe was also a student, of one of the authors of [[Tosafot]], and was the teacher of the [[Maharam of Rothenburg]].<ref name=\"Shivim\">Shivim Temarim ppg. 1-1b, Toldot Rabbeinu Yehuda HeChasid</ref> He also taught [[Isaac ben Moses of Vienna]] (author of ''Or Zarua'') and [[Moses ben Jacob of Coucy]] (author of ''Semag'').<ref name=\"Shivim\" /> Some say all the items in the will were written through ''[[Holy Spirit in Judaism|Ruach hakodesh]]''.<ref>Milei D'chasiduta, p. 39</ref> Some commentaries go so far as to say that none of the [[Timeline of the Hebrew prophets|Biblical prophets]] came to his level.<ref name=\"Shulchan\" /> Many people are very careful with all the items listed in the will.<ref>Yufei Leleiv 3:Y.D. 240, and others</ref> Some say one who is not careful with the items in the tzavaah will have to give a ''din'' and ''cheshbon'' (account).<ref name=\"Shulchan\">Shulchan Hatohar 260:3</ref> The reason why the will is generally not really brought in [[Shulchan Aruch]] is because the dangers mentioned in the Shulchan Aruch and [[Gemarah]] are real dangers, while the items in the will are not real dangers, but things which one must distance himself from.<ref>Shiva Enayim Ein 3</ref>\n\nThere are also ascribed to Judah an astrological work, ''Gema\u1e6driot'',<ref>Azulai, ''Shem HaGedolim'', ii., No. 27</ref> handed down by his pupils and seen by [[Chaim Azulai|Azulai]], and ''Sefer ha-\u1e24okhmah'', on prayers and customs and the writing of scrolls of the Law.\n\n===Sefer Hasidim===\n{{main|Sefer Hasidim}}\n\nThe principal work with which Judah's name is connected is ''Sefer Hasidim''. The book contains ethical, ascetic, and mystical teachings, intermingled with elements of German popular belief. ''Sefer Hasidim'' is not a uniform work, nor is it the product of one author. Parts of it have been attributed to [[Samuel of Speyer]] and [[Eleazar of Worms]], as well as to Judah himself.\n\n==Mysticism==\nThe precise importance of Judah ben Samuel is somewhat difficult to determine. Side by side with the official, dogmatic religion of the Church or the Synagogue there has always existed a mysticism dealing more largely and more intimately with the personal relation of the individual to God, which at times was in opposition to the religion of the Synagogue. Judah's mysticism was in such a stage of opposition; he therefore undervalued the study of the Halakhah and indulged in marked departures from the accepted religious practises. He endeavored to deepen the feeling of devotion and piety and emphasized the importance of studying the Bible rather than studying the Talmud.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} He deals mystically with prayer, regarding it as more important than study. It was really he who introduced [[Theosophy (history of philosophy)|theosophy]] among the Jews of Germany. The occasional quotations from his ''Sefer HaKavod'' present the salient points of his views.\n\nThe conception of a personal relation to the Lord was long since felt by Jewish thinkers to be inconsistent with His spiritual nature. Judah and his school, therefore, though not the first ones, distinguished between the Divine Being ('' 'E\u1e93em'') and the Divine Majesty (''Kavod''). The Divine Being, called also ''\u1e32edushshah'', dwells in the west, invisible to men and angels. The Divine Being is superior to all human perception. When God reveals Himself to men and angels, He appears in the form of the Divine Majesty. The Divine Majesty, then, dwelling in the east and created out of divine fire, holds the divine throne, true to its nature of representing to human eyes the Divine Being. The throne is draped on the south, east, and north, while it is open to the west in order to allow the reflection of the Divine Being dwelling in the west to shine upon it. It is surrounded by the heavenly legions of angels, chanting to the glory of the Creator.<ref>Epstein, in ''Ha-\u1e24o\u1e33er'', ii. 37 et seq.</ref>\n\nLacking the philosophic training common among the Spanish Jews \u2013 although he was acquainted with [[Abraham Ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]], [[Saadia Gaon|Saadia]], some of the [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]], and perhaps [[Maimonides]] \u2013 Judah did not reduce his mystic-theosophical theories to a system, and they are therefore difficult to survey. His intellectual importance is on the whole not clear.<ref>comp. G\u00fcdemann, ''Gesch.'' pp. 153 et seq., 167 et seq.; Jew. Encyc. iii. 465, s.v. Cabala</ref> Zunz  says of him: \"To vindicate whatever is noble in human endeavors, and the highest aspirations of the Israelite, and to discover the inmost truths alluded to in the Sacred Books, seemed to be the ultimate purpose of a mind in which poetic, moral, and divine qualities were fused.\"<ref>Zunz, ''Z.

When, however, enlightenment suddenly came upon him he performed many miracles. He restored fertility to a young married woman. The prophet Elijah is said to have partaken of his \"Seder\" meal and to have been seen by him in a synagogue. He miraculously prevented a Jewish child from being baptized, and knew the exact year of Israel's redemption. He maintained communications with the Bishop of Salzburg and acted as seer for the Duke of Regensburg.<ref>Jellinek, ''B. H.'' vi. 139; Gr\u00fcnbaum, ''J\u00fcdisch-Deutsche Chrestomathie'', p. 385; Br\u00fcll's ''Jahrb.'' ix. 20</ref>\n\n==Writings==\n{{Eras of the Halakha}}\nIt is rather difficult to determine in what the new and important departure ascribed to him by legend consisted, since the obscurity spread over his works is as impenetrable as that surrounding his life. The study of the Talmud, especially as it was treated by his contemporaries, seemed to him fruitless. Still, occasionally a halakhic writing, ''Gan Bosem'', is quoted as his;<ref>comp. Zunz, ''Z. G.'' p. 162</ref> a decision of his is found in ''[[TaSHBa\u1e92]]'', \u00a7 219,<ref>Zunz, l.c. p. 566</ref> in R. [[Isaac ben Moses of Vienna|Isaac]]'s ''Or Zarua' '', and in [[Me\u00efr Rothenburg]]'s collection of responsa;<ref>Zunz, ''Literaturgesch.'' p. 298</ref> and he is found in correspondence with celebrated halakists of his age.\n\nHis commentary on the [[Pentateuch]], written down by his pupils after his lectures, was known only by citations in later commentaries.<ref>Zunz, ''Z. G.'' p. 76 et passim; Luzzatto, ''Kerem \u1e24emed'', vii. 71; ''O\u1e93ar \u1e6cob'', 1878, p. 045</ref> Yet, in 1975, Rabbi I. S. Langa has published Judah's commentary on the [[Pentateuch]], but he was forced to publish a second censored edition, due to revolutionary commentaries of Judah (on Gen. 48:20; Lev. 2:13; Deu. 2:8).<ref>\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05de. \u05ea\u05d0-\u05e9\u05de\u05e2, \u05e2\u05dc \u05d1\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d1\u05d0\u05e9\u05db\u05e0\u05d6 \u05d1\u05d9\u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd, \u05e2\u05de' 273, \u05db\u05e0\u05e1\u05ea \u05de\u05d7\u05e7\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd: \u05e2\u05d9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e8\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1\u05d9\u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd, \u05db\u05e8\u05da \u05d0 : \u05d0\u05e9\u05db\u05e0\u05d6</ref>\n\n===Liturgy===\nHe composed liturgical songs, but the authenticity of those attributed to him is uncertain. As regards his ''Shir Hayichud'' (seven parts; the eighth is called ''Shir HaKavod''), printed in Tiengen, 1560,<ref>Steinschneider, ''Cat. Bodl.'' No. 3313; translated into German in S. Heller's ''Die Echten Hebr\u00e4ischen Melodien'' (ed. Kaufmann)</ref> there is very great divergence of opinion, and the question of its authorship is still undecided. According to Zunz,<ref>''Literaturgesch.'' p. 300</ref> it seems to be genuine, as do also his prayer ''Yechabeh Dim`ati'' and his [[selichot|selicha]] ''Gadol Yichudcha Elohim Beyisrael''. More probably, according to the sources,<ref>see ''Siddur Hegyon Lev'', p. 529, K\u00f6nigsberg, 1845</ref> his father, or a certain Samuel \u1e24azzan, who died as a martyr at [[Erfurt]] in 1121, composed the ''Shir ha-Yi\u1e25ud'', and Judah himself wrote a commentary on it.<ref>Landshuth, '' 'Ammude Ha'Abodah'', p. 77; Epstein, in ''Ha-Goren'', iv. 98</ref> Several prayers are erroneously attributed to Judah; e.g., Zunz wrongly ascribes to him the alphabetical ''te\u1e25innah'' ''Ezkera Yom Moti''.<ref>Steinschneider, l.c.; Landshuth, l.c.</ref> He wrote also commentaries on several parts of the daily prayers and on the Ma\u1e25zor.<ref>Zunz, l.c. p. 301; comp. also Epstein, l.c. pp. 91, 95 et seq.</ref>\n\nJudah collected the notes of travel of his fellow citizen [[Petachiah of Regensburg]], though incompletely and without any order.<ref>Zunz, in Asher's ''Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela'', ii. 253</ref> His chief literary work was an ethical and mystical one. Undoubtedly genuine is his ''Sefer HaKavod'', which is mentioned by his pupils. Although there is some doubt,<ref>comp.

The book contains ethical, ascetic, and mystical teachings, intermingled with elements of German popular belief. ''Sefer Hasidim'' is not a uniform work, nor is it the product of one author. Parts of it have been attributed to [[Samuel of Speyer]] and [[Eleazar of Worms]], as well as to Judah himself.\n\n==Mysticism==\nThe precise importance of Judah ben Samuel is somewhat difficult to determine. Side by side with the official, dogmatic religion of the Church or the Synagogue there has always existed a mysticism dealing more largely and more intimately with the personal relation of the individual to God, which at times was in opposition to the religion of the Synagogue. Judah's mysticism was in such a stage of opposition; he therefore undervalued the study of the Halakhah and indulged in marked departures from the accepted religious practises. He endeavored to deepen the feeling of devotion and piety and emphasized the importance of studying the Bible rather than studying the Talmud.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} He deals mystically with prayer, regarding it as more important than study. It was really he who introduced [[Theosophy (history of philosophy)|theosophy]] among the Jews of Germany. The occasional quotations from his ''Sefer HaKavod'' present the salient points of his views.\n\nThe conception of a personal relation to the Lord was long since felt by Jewish thinkers to be inconsistent with His spiritual nature. Judah and his school, therefore, though not the first ones, distinguished between the Divine Being ('' 'E\u1e93em'') and the Divine Majesty (''Kavod''). The Divine Being, called also ''\u1e32edushshah'', dwells in the west, invisible to men and angels. The Divine Being is superior to all human perception. When God reveals Himself to men and angels, He appears in the form of the Divine Majesty. The Divine Majesty, then, dwelling in the east and created out of divine fire, holds the divine throne, true to its nature of representing to human eyes the Divine Being. The throne is draped on the south, east, and north, while it is open to the west in order to allow the reflection of the Divine Being dwelling in the west to shine upon it. It is surrounded by the heavenly legions of angels, chanting to the glory of the Creator.<ref>Epstein, in ''Ha-\u1e24o\u1e33er'', ii. 37 et seq.</ref>\n\nLacking the philosophic training common among the Spanish Jews \u2013 although he was acquainted with [[Abraham Ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]], [[Saadia Gaon|Saadia]], some of the [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]], and perhaps [[Maimonides]] \u2013 Judah did not reduce his mystic-theosophical theories to a system, and they are therefore difficult to survey. His intellectual importance is on the whole not clear.<ref>comp. G\u00fcdemann, ''Gesch.'' pp. 153 et seq., 167 et seq.; Jew. Encyc. iii. 465, s.v. Cabala</ref> Zunz  says of him: \"To vindicate whatever is noble in human endeavors, and the highest aspirations of the Israelite, and to discover the inmost truths alluded to in the Sacred Books, seemed to be the ultimate purpose of a mind in which poetic, moral, and divine qualities were fused.\"<ref>Zunz, ''Z.

Although each series is set within a different period of British history, each character is part of the same familial [[dynasty]] and is usually called Edmund Blackadder. Each character also shares notable personality traits and characteristics throughout each incarnation. In a 2001 poll [[Conducting|conducted]] by [[Channel 4]], Edmund Blackadder was ranked third on their list of the [[100 Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest TV Characters]].<ref name=\"GreatestTVcharacters\">{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_characters/results.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531160558/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_characters/results.html |archivedate=31 May 2009 |title=100 Greatest TV Characters |accessdate=26 May 2019 |publisher=[[Channel 4]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itnsource.com/en/shotlist/ITVProgs/2001/05/05/Y22090001/ |title=100 Greatest ...

He moves from a prince (''[[The Black Adder]]'') to a lord (''[[Blackadder II]]''), a knight (''[[Blackadder: The Cavalier Years]]''), a royal attendant (''[[Blackadder the Third]]''), a shopkeeper (''[[Blackadder's Christmas Carol]]''), to an army captain (''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]''). Throughout each series, Blackadder is a self-serving, cynical opportunist concerned solely with increasing his own influence, status and wealth. His character is symbolized by the [[Vipera berus|adder]], the United Kingdom's only native venomous snake,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/adder | title = Adder | publisher = Forestry Commission | accessdate = 29 June 2015}}</ref> which sometimes appears in the series as a visual motif.\n\nWith the exception of the first Blackadder incarnation, Prince Edmund, each is generally [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]], charismatic and intelligent. While he is haunted by bad luck, he is usually very capable of manipulating his way out of a crisis and in securing for himself some degree of prestige and fortune. Blackadder is also usually one of the few intelligent people present at any given time and is usually surrounded by incompetent, slow-witted servants, equals and superiors. As a result, he possesses an acerbic wit and is usually prepared with numerous quick put-downs, which are often wasted on those at whom they are directed.\n\nHe is frequently present at some of the defining moments of British history, but usually views his contemporaries with unbridled contempt, regardless of their historical importance or interest. He is also generally dismissive of the contemporary arts and culture in the various eras in which he lives, such as medieval folk pageants, [[Shakespeare]], [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] poetry, and [[Charlie Chaplin]] films.\n\nEach Blackadder is also surrounded by various other figures who reappear over the series. These include his manservant [[Baldrick]] ([[Tony Robinson]]) and the various imbecilic aristocrats with whose company he is lumbered, such as [[Lord Percy Percy]] ([[Tim McInnerny]]) and [[George (Blackadder)|George]] ([[Hugh Laurie]]).\n\n==Main Blackadders==\nIn this section, brief descriptions of the various Edmund Blackadders who have appeared in their own series or in another notable ''Blackadder'' production are provided.\n\n===Prince Edmund, Duke of Edinburgh/The Black Adder (Medieval England)===\nPrince Edmund (1461-1498) is the first man in the dynasty to refer to himself as 'The Black Adder'. He appears in the first series, set shortly after [[The Wars of the Roses]]. He is the second son of the fictional [[Richard IV of England (Blackadder)|King Richard IV of England]] ([[Brian Blessed]]), who, we are told at the beginning, was cast from all historical references by his successor, [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] ([[Peter Benson (actor)|Peter Benson]]). Prince Edmund is a very different character from his descendants: he is slow-witted, cowardly, and the butt of the other characters' jokes. While he is as devious and amoral as his descendants, his [[Machiavellianism (psychology)|Machiavellian]] schemes are usually spurred on by other characters. -For all this he is determined and driven to power: his primary concern is to seize the English throne and become king. After the death of Richard IV and Edmund's older brother [[Prince Harry (Blackadder)|Harry]] ([[Robert East (actor)|Robert East]]), he is briefly King of England; a lyric one of the [[closing credits]] for ''[[Head (Blackadder)|Black Adder II]]'' describes him as \"a king / Although for only thirty seconds\". Prince Edmund is one of the many Blackadders to be killed on screen: he dies after accidentally drinking poisoned wine, although he had already been severely mutilated by his childhood nemesis, the Duke of Burgundy ([[Patrick Allen]]).\n\n[[Image:BA2adder.jpg|thumb|Edmund, [[Lord Blackadder]] (Series 2)]]\n\n===Edmund, Lord Blackadder (Elizabethan England)===\nEdmund, Lord Blackadder is the next-seen member of the dynasty, appearing in [[Elizabethan England]]. He is the central character of ''Black Adder II'', and is a [[aristocracy|nobleman]] in the court of [[Elizabeth I of England]]. Although his 'great-grandfather' was Prince Edmund, he is much more intelligent, charismatic, acerbic, handsome and respected than his ancestor. Despite that fact, Edmund's aristocratic title has lowered; he is now simply a lord, rather than a Prince. His main concerns are pleasing his [[Queenie (Blackadder)|Queen]] ([[Miranda Richardson]]), depicted here as a childish, spoiled tyrant, and in outwitting his various contemporary rivals, usually in the form of [[List of Blackadder characters#Melchett|Lord Melchett]] ([[Stephen Fry]]), for her favour. At the end of his series, this Edmund was murdered by Prince Ludwig the Indestructible of Germany (Laurie). Blackadder thought he had murdered Ludwig but at the end of the credits, Ludwig comes back and murders Edmund, Queenie and the rest of the court. He then poses as Queenie after the assassination.\n\nThe character shift from Prince Edmund in the first series to Lord Blackadder in the second is credited to the involvement of [[Ben Elton]], who joined as the show's co-writer alongside [[Richard Curtis]]. The latter Edmund became the ''de facto'' archetype; nearly all subsequent Blackadders in the series were modelled after Edmund, Lord Blackadder - the exception being Ebenezer Blackadder, who initially began as the nicest man in England to the point of naivete but who gradually fell back into the standard persona after being abused by almost everyone around him.\n\n===Sir Edmund Blackadder (English Civil War)===\nSir Edmund Blackadder appears in the [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] special ''[[Blackadder: The Cavalier Years]]''. Set after the [[English Civil War]], Sir Edmund is (apparently) a loyal [[Cavalier|royalist]] and friend of [[Charles I of England]], played by [[Stephen Fry]]. This Blackadder also appeared in an introductory sequence for  [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]' fiftieth birthday Gala Performance, in which he was supposedly organising a birthday show for Charles II (also Fry).\n\n===Edmund Blackadder Esq. (Regency Britain)===\nEdmund Blackadder, [[Esquire|Esq.]], is the Blackadder appearing in the [[British Regency|Regency]] period of British history. His family having fallen on hard times, he is reduced to a life of servitude, a fall made even more insufferable by his position as [[butler]] to the oafish and uncouth [[George (Blackadder)|George]] (Laurie), the [[Prince Regent]]. Despite this, he remains keenly intelligent (by far sharper than most of the people he associates with), and is usually found stealing from his employer. This is the only one of the main four incarnations not to be killed onscreen (the first two are murdered, whilst the fourth dies in battle); while history records this version of Blackadder as having been shot dead by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] (Fry), in actuality Prince George is masquerading as Blackadder and vice versa, which results in Blackadder assuming his identity and later becoming [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]].\n\n===Ebenezer Blackadder (Victorian London)===\nEbenezer Blackadder, the Victorian Blackadder, appears in ''[[Blackadder's Christmas Carol]]''. Unlike his cold-hearted, [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] ancestors, he is by repute the nicest man in [[Victorian England]]. Unfortunately, this only serves to make him a target for the cynical crooks and cheats he is surrounded by, and a ''[[A Christmas Carol|Christmas Carol]]''-like encounter with the \"Ghost of Christmas\" sees him greatly inspired by his snide-yet-triumphant ancestors; he learns that if he reverts to their ways his descendants will rule the universe, if not they will end up as Baldrick's slaves in the same time period. Upon the departure of the Ghost, Blackadder renounces his compassion and reverts to type on the spot.\n\n===Captain Edmund Blackadder (World War I)===<!-- Anchor from redirect of [Captain Edmund Blackadder]; caution -->\n[[File:Captain Edmund Backadder promo.jpg|thumb|165px|rt|Captain Blackadder in the Suffolk Regiment]]\n[[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] Edmund Blackadder appears in ''Blackadder Goes Forth'', set during [[World War I]].  A long-time soldier, early in his career Blackadder was \"The Hero of Umboto Gorge\", a (fictional) battle that took place in [[Burkina Faso|Upper Volta]] in 1892, during which he saved the life of Douglas Haig.  He also served in the 1898 [[Sudan War]], and makes reference to having spent most of his career away from Britain.\n\nPrior to the outbreak of World War I, Blackadder found life in the British Army agreeable, as he had enjoyed a relatively danger-free existence. His main responsibility was to uphold [[colonialism]] in the [[British Empire]], or as he personally put it; fighting natives who were usually \"two feet tall and armed with dried grass.\" However, now that [[World War I]] is on, Blackadder is astute to the gravity and slaughter of [[trench warfare]], and unlike his superior officers; realizes that the earlier colonial battles produced wildly unrealistic expectations about future conflict. Characteristically reluctant to meet his end in the mud of the trenches of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], this Blackadder's sole goal is to escape his inevitable fate. Blackadder's attempts to escape are thwarted by the idiotic [[General Melchett]] (Fry), and Melchett's assistant Captain [[Kevin Darling]] (McInnerny), Blackadder's nemesis.\n\nBlackadder shares his trench with [[Baldrick|Private S. Baldrick]] (Robinson), and [[George (Blackadder)|Lt. The Hon. George Colthurst St Barleigh]] (Laurie). Also shown from afar is [[Sir Douglas Haig]] ([[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]]), who had such a large moustache he wears tiny hairnets to protect it.\n\nIn the series finale, \"[[Goodbyeee]]\", Captain Blackadder and his company are sent to the [[Battle of the Somme]]. After trying and failing to get out of the battle, Blackadder's company charges, then only gunpowder clouds are seen; implying the entire company goes to their deaths.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nIn the series, Captain Blackadder is seen wearing the following ribbons:\n<center>\n{| style=\"margin: 1em auto;\"\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Queen's South Africa Medal.png|width=100}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=King's South Africa Medal.png|width=100}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Ribbon - 1914 Star.png|width=110}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Croix de Guerre 1914-1918 ribbon.svg|width=100}}\n|}\n</center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 40%; margin: 1em auto; text-align: center;\"\n|[[Queen's South Africa Medal|Queen's South<br>Africa Medal]]\n|[[King's South Africa Medal|King's South<br>Africa Medal]]\n|[[1914 Star]]\n|[[Croix de guerre 1914\u20131918 (France)|Croix de Guerre<br>(France)]]\n|}\n\n===Lord Edmund Blackadder / King Edmund III (Turn-of-the-Millennium)===\nLord Edmund Blackadder is the modern representative of the Blackadder family. He intends to play a turn-of-the-[[3rd millennium|millennium]]-prank on his friends by claiming that he has a [[Time travel in fiction|time machine]] \u2013 only to be unpleasantly surprised that the device that Baldrick has actually built (following [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s instructions to the letter, except for marking values on the instrument display) actually ''is'' a working time machine. He manages to alter time by:\n# Beating up [[William Shakespeare]] ([[Colin Firth]]) and telling him that his plays are just people \"wearing stupid tights\" who are \"talking total crap\". When Blackadder also leaves his [[ballpoint pen]] behind, he causes Shakespeare to be viewed by history not as the great playwright, but as the pen's \"inventor\". \n# Convincing [[Robin Hood]]'s ([[Rik Mayall]]) men that robbing from the rich is fine, but giving to the poor makes them look like complete lunatics, causing them to shoot Robin full of arrows.\n# Causing the time machine to land on top of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] (Fry) during the [[Battle of Waterloo]], allowing [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] to win the battle and conquer the United Kingdom.\n\nHe restores history but then has the idea of changing history in his favour. In the present day, a news report shows the popular King Edmund III and his queen, Marion of Sherwood ([[Kate Moss]]), being greeted by the prime minister, Baldrick. With Baldrick working as his prime minister and [[British Parliament|Parliament]] dissolved, the Blackadder and Baldrick families have finally triumphed and become rulers of the UK.\n\n==Other Blackadders==\nAlthough not appearing within their own series or one-off special, various other Blackadders have appeared or been alluded to over the course of the series.\n\nSeveral relatives of the Blackadder family include the [[Puritan]] Whiteadders, and the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlander]] clan of MacAdder. Various one-off specials have introduced other Blackadders throughout history, from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] '''[[Centurion Blaccadicus]]''', to a '''Grand Admiral Blackadder''' in the distant future who becomes ruler of the universe.\n\nAt the 2000 [[Royal Variety Performance]], Atkinson performed a short monologue called \"Blackadder: The Army Years\" as Captain Lord Edmund Blackadder of Her Royal Highness's Regiment of Shirkers. It is possible that Captain Lord Blackadder is the same modern day Lord Blackadder seen in \"Back and Forth\", although no mention of military rank is made there.\n\nIn 2002, during the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II]] trailers for the [[Party at the Palace]] featured the Keeper of Her Majesty's Lawn Sprinklers, '''Sir Osmond Darling-Blackadder''', who was against the idea. Sir Osmond also co-hosted the light-hearted documentary on the celebrations ''Jubilee Girl''. He is notable for being one of the few members of the family not to be named Edmund, and also for his double barrelled name, suggesting a family connection to [[Kevin Darling]].\n\nAt the 2012 charity event ''[[We Are Most Amused]]'', Atkinson appeared in a sketch parodying the then current [[2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package|banking crisis]] as Sir Edmund Blackadder, CEO of the Melchett, Melchett and Darling Bank.\n\nIn the Blackadder script book ''The Whole Damn Dynasty'', a number of Blackadders are mentioned, beginning with a Druid by the name of Edmun, who is later succeeded by the Duc d'Blackadder, who is believed to have been the man who shot [[Harold II]] at [[The Battle of Hastings]].\n\n==Blackadder dynasty==\n* Edmun, a [[druid]] who helped construct [[Stonehenge]] \u2013 (referred to in ''Blackadder: The Whole Damn Dynasty'')\n* Blaccadda, who insulted [[Boadicea]] of the [[Iceni]] \u2013 (referred to in ''Blackadder: The Whole Damn Dynasty'')\n* [[Centurion Blaccadicus]] \u2013 [[Roman Britain]] (''Blackadder Back And Forth'')\n* Duc D'Blackadder \u2013 [[Norman Conquest]] (referred to in ''Blackadder \u2013 The Whole Damn Dynasty'')\n* Blackadder the Chickenheart \u2013 during the reign of [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] (referred to in ''Blackadder \u2013 The Whole Damn Dynasty'')\n* Baron de Blackadder \u2013 during the reign of [[John I of England|King John]]\n* Lord Blackadder \u2013 [[Medieval]] \u2013 first name unknown, a contemporary of [[Robin Hood]] (time period visited in ''Blackadder Back And Forth'')\n* [[Prince Edmund (Blackadder)|Prince Edmund, Duke of Edinburgh \"The Black Adder\"]] \u2013 Middle Ages (''The Black Adder'')\n* [[Prince Edmund (Blackadder Pilot)|Prince Edmund, Duke of York \"The Black Adder\"]] \u2013 400 years ago (''The Black Adder'' - unaired pilot)\n* Cardinal Blackadder \u2013 Tudor (referred to in ''Blackadder \u2013 The Whole Damn Dynasty'', father of [[Edmund, Lord Blackadder]])\n* Nathaniel Whiteadder \u2013 Elizabethan \u2013 apparent uncle to Prince Edmund.\n* Osric Blackadder \u2013 Elizabethan (referred to in ''Blackadder II'')\n* [[Lord Blackadder|Edmund, Lord Blackadder]] \u2013 Elizabethan (''Blackadder II'')\n* Blackadder (Shakespeare's agent) \u2013 Elizabethan\n* Sir Edmund Blackadder \u2013 Stuart, English Civil War (''Blackadder: The Cavalier Years'')\n* Lord Edmund Blackadder, Privy Counsellor \u2013 Stuart, 1680 (''Blackadder And The King's Birthday '')\n* Duke of Blackadder \u2013 reign of [[Anne I of England|Queen Anne]] (referred to in ''Blackadder \u2013 The Whole Damn Dynasty'')\n* [[Mr. E.

The name is thought to be mostly Scottish [[genealogy|in origin]], which is not contradicted in the series, as the [[Prince Edmund (Blackadder)|first Blackadder]] begins as the [[Duke of Edinburgh]]. In the third series it is revealed that a branch of the Blackadder family is a significant [[Scottish clan|clan in Scotland]], although they have become known by the name MacAdder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surnamedb.com/surname.aspx?name=Blackadder |title=Blackadder surname meaning |publisher=SurnameDB |date=2007-02-24 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> There is a [[Clan Blackadder]] in reality.

Although each series is set within a different period of British history, each character is part of the same familial [[dynasty]] and is usually called Edmund Blackadder. Each character also shares notable personality traits and characteristics throughout each incarnation. In a 2001 poll [[Conducting|conducted]] by [[Channel 4]], Edmund Blackadder was ranked third on their list of the [[100 Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest TV Characters]].<ref name=\"GreatestTVcharacters\">{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_characters/results.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531160558/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_characters/results.html |archivedate=31 May 2009 |title=100 Greatest TV Characters |accessdate=26 May 2019 |publisher=[[Channel 4]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itnsource.com/en/shotlist/ITVProgs/2001/05/05/Y22090001/ |title=100 Greatest ...

He moves from a prince (''[[The Black Adder]]'') to a lord (''[[Blackadder II]]''), a knight (''[[Blackadder: The Cavalier Years]]''), a royal attendant (''[[Blackadder the Third]]''), a shopkeeper (''[[Blackadder's Christmas Carol]]''), to an army captain (''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]''). Throughout each series, Blackadder is a self-serving, cynical opportunist concerned solely with increasing his own influence, status and wealth. His character is symbolized by the [[Vipera berus|adder]], the United Kingdom's only native venomous snake,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/adder | title = Adder | publisher = Forestry Commission | accessdate = 29 June 2015}}</ref> which sometimes appears in the series as a visual motif.\n\nWith the exception of the first Blackadder incarnation, Prince Edmund, each is generally [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]], charismatic and intelligent. While he is haunted by bad luck, he is usually very capable of manipulating his way out of a crisis and in securing for himself some degree of prestige and fortune. Blackadder is also usually one of the few intelligent people present at any given time and is usually surrounded by incompetent, slow-witted servants, equals and superiors. As a result, he possesses an acerbic wit and is usually prepared with numerous quick put-downs, which are often wasted on those at whom they are directed.\n\nHe is frequently present at some of the defining moments of British history, but usually views his contemporaries with unbridled contempt, regardless of their historical importance or interest. He is also generally dismissive of the contemporary arts and culture in the various eras in which he lives, such as medieval folk pageants, [[Shakespeare]], [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] poetry, and [[Charlie Chaplin]] films.\n\nEach Blackadder is also surrounded by various other figures who reappear over the series. These include his manservant [[Baldrick]] ([[Tony Robinson]]) and the various imbecilic aristocrats with whose company he is lumbered, such as [[Lord Percy Percy]] ([[Tim McInnerny]]) and [[George (Blackadder)|George]] ([[Hugh Laurie]]).\n\n==Main Blackadders==\nIn this section, brief descriptions of the various Edmund Blackadders who have appeared in their own series or in another notable ''Blackadder'' production are provided.\n\n===Prince Edmund, Duke of Edinburgh/The Black Adder (Medieval England)===\nPrince Edmund (1461-1498) is the first man in the dynasty to refer to himself as 'The Black Adder'. He appears in the first series, set shortly after [[The Wars of the Roses]]. He is the second son of the fictional [[Richard IV of England (Blackadder)|King Richard IV of England]] ([[Brian Blessed]]), who, we are told at the beginning, was cast from all historical references by his successor, [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] ([[Peter Benson]]). Prince Edmund is a very different character from his descendants: he is slow-witted, cowardly, and the butt of the other characters' jokes. While he is as devious and amoral as his descendants, his [[Machiavellian]] schemes are usually spurred on by other characters. -For all this he is determined and driven to power: his primary concern is to seize the English throne and become king. After the death of Richard IV and Edmund's older brother [[Prince Harry (Blackadder)|Harry]] ([[Robert East]]), he is briefly King of England; a lyric one of the [[closing credits]] for ''[[Head (Blackadder)|Black Adder II]]'' describes him as \"a king / Although for only thirty seconds\". Prince Edmund is one of the many Blackadders to be killed on screen: he dies after accidentally drinking poisoned wine, although he had already been severely mutilated by his childhood nemesis, the Duke of Burgundy ([[Patrick Allen]]).\n\n[[Image:BA2adder.jpg|thumb|Edmund, [[Lord Blackadder]] (Series 2)]]\n\n===Edmund, Lord Blackadder (Elizabethan England)===\nEdmund, Lord Blackadder is the next-seen member of the dynasty, appearing in [[Elizabethan England]]. He is the central character of ''Black Adder II'', and is a [[aristocracy|nobleman]] in the court of [[Elizabeth I of England]]. Although his 'great-grandfather' was Prince Edmund, he is much more intelligent, charismatic, acerbic, handsome and respected than his ancestor. Despite that fact, Edmund's aristocratic title has lowered; he is now simply a lord, rather than a Prince. His main concerns are pleasing his [[Queenie (Blackadder)|Queen]] ([[Miranda Richardson]]), depicted here as a childish, spoiled tyrant, and in outwitting his various contemporary rivals, usually in the form of [[List of Blackadder characters#Melchett|Lord Melchett]] ([[Stephen Fry]]), for her favour. At the end of his series, this Edmund was murdered by Prince Ludwig the Indestructible of Germany (Laurie). Blackadder thought he had murdered Ludwig but at the end of the credits, Ludwig comes back and murders Edmund, Queenie and the rest of the court. He then poses as Queenie after the assassination.\n\nThe character shift from Prince Edmund in the first series to Lord Blackadder in the second is credited to the involvement of [[Ben Elton]], who joined as the show's co-writer alongside [[Richard Curtis]]. The latter Edmund became the ''de facto'' archetype; nearly all subsequent Blackadders in the series were modelled after Edmund, Lord Blackadder - the exception being Ebenezer Blackadder, who initially began as the nicest man in England to the point of naivete but who gradually fell back into the standard persona after being abused by almost everyone around him.\n\n===Sir Edmund Blackadder (English Civil War)===\nSir Edmund Blackadder appears in the [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] special ''[[Blackadder: The Cavalier Years]]''. Set after the [[English Civil War]], Sir Edmund is (apparently) a loyal [[Cavalier|royalist]] and friend of [[Charles I of England]], played by [[Stephen Fry]]. This Blackadder also appeared in an introductory sequence for  [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]' fiftieth birthday Gala Performance, in which he was supposedly organising a birthday show for Charles II (also Fry).\n\n===Edmund Blackadder Esq. (Regency Britain)===\nEdmund Blackadder, [[Esquire|Esq.]], is the Blackadder appearing in the [[British Regency|Regency]] period of British history. His family having fallen on hard times, he is reduced to a life of servitude, a fall made even more insufferable by his position as [[butler]] to the oafish and uncouth [[George (Blackadder)|George]] (Laurie), the [[Prince Regent]]. Despite this, he remains keenly intelligent (by far sharper than most of the people he associates with), and is usually found stealing from his employer. This is the only one of the main four incarnations not to be killed onscreen (the first two are murdered, whilst the fourth dies in battle); while history records this version of Blackadder as having been shot dead by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] (Fry), in actuality Prince George is masquerading as Blackadder and vice versa, which results in Blackadder assuming his identity and later becoming [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]].\n\n===Ebenezer Blackadder (Victorian London)===\nEbenezer Blackadder, the Victorian Blackadder, appears in ''[[Blackadder's Christmas Carol]]''. Unlike his cold-hearted, [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] ancestors, he is by repute the nicest man in [[Victorian England]]. Unfortunately, this only serves to make him a target for the cynical crooks and cheats he is surrounded by, and a ''[[A Christmas Carol|Christmas Carol]]''-like encounter with the \"Ghost of Christmas\" sees him greatly inspired by his snide-yet-triumphant ancestors; he learns that if he reverts to their ways his descendants will rule the universe, if not they will end up as Baldrick's slaves in the same time period. Upon the departure of the Ghost, Blackadder renounces his compassion and reverts to type on the spot.\n\n===Captain Edmund Blackadder (World War I)===<!-- Anchor from redirect of [Captain Edmund Blackadder]; caution -->\n[[File:Captain Edmund Backadder promo.jpg|thumb|165px|rt|Captain Blackadder in the Suffolk Regiment]]\n[[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] Edmund Blackadder appears in ''Blackadder Goes Forth'', set during [[World War I]].  A long-time soldier, early in his career Blackadder was \"The Hero of Umboto Gorge\", a (fictional) battle that took place in [[Burkina Faso|Upper Volta]] in 1892, during which he saved the life of Douglas Haig.  He also served in the 1898 [[Sudan War]], and makes reference to having spent most of his career away from Britain.\n\nPrior to the outbreak of World War I, Blackadder found life in the British Army agreeable, as he had enjoyed a relatively danger-free existence. His main responsibility was to uphold [[colonialism]] in the [[British Empire]], or as he personally put it; fighting natives who were usually \"two feet tall and armed with dried grass.\" However, now that [[World War I]] is on, Blackadder is astute to the gravity and slaughter of [[trench warfare]], and unlike his superior officers; realizes that the earlier colonial battles produced wildly unrealistic expectations about future conflict. Characteristically reluctant to meet his end in the mud of the trenches of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], this Blackadder's sole goal is to escape his inevitable fate. Blackadder's attempts to escape are thwarted by the idiotic [[General Melchett]] (Fry), and Melchett's assistant Captain [[Kevin Darling]] (McInnerny), Blackadder's nemesis.\n\nBlackadder shares his trench with [[Baldrick|Private S. Baldrick]] (Robinson), and [[George (Blackadder)|Lt. The Hon. George Colthurst St Barleigh]] (Laurie). Also shown from afar is [[Sir Douglas Haig]] ([[Geoffrey Palmer]]), who had such a large moustache he wears tiny hairnets to protect it.\n\nIn the series finale, \"[[Goodbyeee]]\", Captain Blackadder and his company are sent to the [[Battle of the Somme]]. After trying and failing to get out of the battle, Blackadder's company charges, then only gunpowder clouds are seen; implying the entire company goes to their deaths.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nIn the series, Captain Blackadder is seen wearing the following ribbons:\n<center>\n{| style=\"margin: 1em auto;\"\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Queen's South Africa Medal.png|width=100}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=King's South Africa Medal.png|width=100}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Ribbon - 1914 Star.png|width=110}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Croix de Guerre 1914-1918 ribbon.svg|width=100}}\n|}\n</center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 40%; margin: 1em auto; text-align: center;\"\n|[[Queen's South Africa Medal|Queen's South<br>Africa Medal]]\n|[[King's South Africa Medal|King's South<br>Africa Medal]]\n|[[1914 Star]]\n|[[Croix de guerre 1914\u20131918 (France)|Croix de Guerre<br>(France)]]\n|}\n\n===Lord Edmund Blackadder / King Edmund III (Turn-of-the-Millennium)===\nLord Edmund Blackadder is the modern representative of the Blackadder family. He intends to play a turn-of-the-[[3rd millennium|millennium]]-prank on his friends by claiming that he has a [[Time travel in fiction|time machine]] \u2013 only to be unpleasantly surprised that the device that Baldrick has actually built (following [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s instructions to the letter, except for marking values on the instrument display) actually ''is'' a working time machine. He manages to alter time by:\n# Beating up [[William Shakespeare]] ([[Colin Firth]]) and telling him that his plays are just people \"wearing stupid tights\" who are \"talking total crap\". When Blackadder also leaves his [[ballpoint pen]] behind, he causes Shakespeare to be viewed by history not as the great playwright, but as the pen's \"inventor\". \n# Convincing [[Robin Hood]]'s ([[Rik Mayall]]) men that robbing from the rich is fine, but giving to the poor makes them look like complete lunatics, causing them to shoot Robin full of arrows.\n# Causing the time machine to land on top of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] (Fry) during the [[Battle of Waterloo]], allowing [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] to win the battle and conquer the United Kingdom.\n\nHe restores history but then has the idea of changing history in his favour. In the present day, a news report shows the popular King Edmund III and his queen, Marion of Sherwood ([[Kate Moss]]), being greeted by the prime minister, Baldrick. With Baldrick working as his prime minister and [[British Parliament|Parliament]] dissolved, the Blackadder and Baldrick families have finally triumphed and become rulers of the UK.\n\n==Other Blackadders==\nAlthough not appearing within their own series or one-off special, various other Blackadders have appeared or been alluded to over the course of the series.\n\nSeveral relatives of the Blackadder family include the [[Puritan]] Whiteadders, and the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlander]] clan of MacAdder. Various one-off specials have introduced other Blackadders throughout history, from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] '''[[Centurion Blaccadicus]]''', to a '''Grand Admiral Blackadder''' in the distant future who becomes ruler of the universe.\n\nAt the 2000 [[Royal Variety Performance]], Atkinson performed a short monologue called \"Blackadder: The Army Years\" as Captain Lord Edmund Blackadder of Her Royal Highness's Regiment of Shirkers. It is possible that Captain Lord Blackadder is the same modern day Lord Blackadder seen in \"Back and Forth\", although no mention of military rank is made there.\n\nIn 2002, during the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II]] trailers for the [[Party at the Palace]] featured the Keeper of Her Majesty's Lawn Sprinklers, '''Sir Osmond Darling-Blackadder''', who was against the idea. Sir Osmond also co-hosted the light-hearted documentary on the celebrations ''Jubilee Girl''. He is notable for being one of the few members of the family not to be named Edmund, and also for his double barrelled name, suggesting a family connection to [[Kevin Darling]].\n\nAt the 2012 charity event ''[[We Are Most Amused]]'', Atkinson appeared in a sketch parodying the then current [[2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package|banking crisis]] as Sir Edmund Blackadder, CEO of the Melchett, Melchett and Darling Bank.\n\nIn the Blackadder script book ''The Whole Damn Dynasty'', a number of Blackadders are mentioned, beginning with a Druid by the name of Edmun, who is later succeeded by the Duc d'Blackadder, who is believed to have been the man who shot [[Harold II]] at [[The Battle of Hastings]].\n\n==Blackadder dynasty==\n* Edmun, a [[druid]] who helped construct [[Stonehenge]] \u2013 (referred to in ''Blackadder: The Whole Damn Dynasty'')\n* Blaccadda, who insulted [[Boadicea]] of the [[Iceni]] \u2013 (referred to in ''Blackadder: The Whole Damn Dynasty'')\n* [[Centurion Blaccadicus]] \u2013 [[Roman Britain]] (''Blackadder Back And Forth'')\n* Duc D'Blackadder \u2013 [[Norman Conquest]] (referred to in ''Blackadder \u2013 The Whole Damn Dynasty'')\n* Blackadder the Chickenheart \u2013 during the reign of [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] (referred to in ''Blackadder \u2013 The Whole Damn Dynasty'')\n* Baron de Blackadder \u2013 during the reign of [[John I of England|King John]]\n* Lord Blackadder \u2013 [[Medieval]] \u2013 first name unknown, a contemporary of [[Robin Hood]] (time period visited in ''Blackadder Back And Forth'')\n* [[Prince Edmund (Blackadder)|Prince Edmund, Duke of Edinburgh \"The Black Adder\"]] \u2013 Middle Ages (''The Black Adder'')\n* [[Prince Edmund (Blackadder Pilot)|Prince Edmund, Duke of York \"The Black Adder\"]] \u2013 400 years ago (''The Black Adder'' - unaired pilot)\n* Cardinal Blackadder \u2013 Tudor (referred to in ''Blackadder \u2013 The Whole Damn Dynasty'', father of [[Edmund, Lord Blackadder]])\n* Nathaniel Whiteadder \u2013 Elizabethan \u2013 apparent uncle to Prince Edmund.\n* Osric Blackadder \u2013 Elizabethan (referred to in ''Blackadder II'')\n* [[Lord Blackadder|Edmund, Lord Blackadder]] \u2013 Elizabethan (''Blackadder II'')\n* Blackadder (Shakespeare's agent) \u2013 Elizabethan\n* Sir Edmund Blackadder \u2013 Stuart, English Civil War (''Blackadder: The Cavalier Years'')\n* Lord Edmund Blackadder, Privy Counsellor \u2013 Stuart, 1680 (''Blackadder And The King's Birthday '')\n* Duke of Blackadder \u2013 reign of [[Anne I of England|Queen Anne]] (referred to in ''Blackadder \u2013 The Whole Damn Dynasty'')\n* [[Mr. E.

MacAdder is the Scottish Cousin of Mr. E. Blackadder. He is known as being the 'most dangerous man ever to wear a skirt in Europe'. He believes he is rightful king of England and plans to incite rebellion, making his cousin hate him.\n* [[Ebenezer Blackadder|Mr Ebenezer Blackadder]] \u2013 Victorian (''Blackadder's Christmas Carol'')\n* [[Captain Blackadder|Captain Edmund Blackadder]] \u2013 First World War (''Blackadder Goes Forth'')\n* [[Edmund Blackadder#Lord Edmund Blackadder / King Edmund III (Modern)|Lord Edmund Blackadder / King Edmund III]] \u2013 1999 (''Blackadder Back And Forth'')\n* Lord Edmund Blackadder, Captain In Her Royal Highness' Regiment of Shirkers \u2013 2000 (''Blackadder: The Army Years '')\n* Sir Osmond Darling-Blackadder, 'Keeper of the Lawn Sprinklers' \u2013 2002 (BBC Golden Jubilee promotion, and ''Jubilee Girl'')\n* Sir Edmund Blackadder, CEO of the Melchett, Melchett and Darling Bank \u2013 2012 (''We Are Most Amused'')\n* Grand Admiral Blackadder of the Dark Segment \u2013 Distant Future (''Blackadder's Christmas Carol'')\n\n==Historicity==\nBlackadder is a genuine surname, its usage in the UK currently documented back to the 15th century, which may explain the choice of the name, with the first series being set in this time period. The name is thought to be mostly Scottish [[genealogy|in origin]], which is not contradicted in the series, as the [[Prince Edmund (Blackadder)|first Blackadder]] begins as the [[Duke of Edinburgh]]. In the third series it is revealed that a branch of the Blackadder family is a significant [[Scottish clan|clan in Scotland]], although they have become known by the name MacAdder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surnamedb.com/surname.aspx?name=Blackadder |title=Blackadder surname meaning |publisher=SurnameDB |date=2007-02-24 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> There is a [[Clan Blackadder]] in reality.
