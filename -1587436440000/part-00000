He faces potentially more than 40 years in prison. On April 11,2020 a judge released Avenatti in fear he would contract the Corona Virus. However the same judge insists that Trump friend Roger Stone be jailed for lying to the FBI. Stone is of older age with a history of asthma putting him at grave risk of death if contracted in prison. Yet Avenatti a staunch democrat and anti-trumper is not at high risk due to his age and health was released from prison presenting a dramatic contrast of the subjective importance by the judge who is a known democrat and Avenatti for president supporter. \nr<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-darling-michael-avenatti-nike|title=Ex-CNN darling Michael Avenatti convicted of trying to extort Nike|website=FOX News|language=en|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|last=Stempel|first=Jonathan|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-avenatti-idUSKBN2082EB|title=Celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti is found guilty in Nike extortion case|date=2020-02-14|work=[[Reuters]]|access-date=2020-02-14|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/Y1MwY|archive-date=2020-02-14|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nBorn on February 16, 1971, in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], California, Avenatti spent his early childhood in [[Colorado]] and [[Utah]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/michael-avenatti-the-adrenaline-fueled-lawyer-taking-on-donald-trump/2018/03/25/3ef5cbdc-2e88-11e8-b0b0-f706877db618_story.html|title=Michael Avenatti, the adrenaline-fueled lawyer taking on President Trump|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|last=Roig-Franzia|first=Manuel|date=March 25, 2018|access-date=April 17, 2018}}</ref> His father was a manager for [[Anheuser-Busch]].<ref name = Ball>{{cite news |last1=Ball |first1=Molly |last2=Abramson|first2=Alana|title=Michael Avenatti's Past Won't Stop Him From Running in 2020 |url=http://time.com/5434317/michael-avenatti/ |publisher=Time Magazine |date=October 25, 2018}}</ref> He moved with his family to [[Chesterfield, Missouri|Chesterfield]], Missouri, a suburb of [[St. Louis]], in 1982, where he attended [[Parkway Central High School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/columns/joe-holleman/porn-star-stormy-daniels-lawyer-graduated-from-parkway-central/article_8ce4cfef-818e-58db-8250-a8f7d317effa.html|last=Holleman|first=Joe|title=Porn star Stormy Daniels' lawyer graduated from Parkway Central |work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |date=March 8, 2018 |accessdate=March 24, 2018}}</ref> After graduating in 1989, Avenatti attended [[Saint Louis University]] for one year before transferring to the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[political science]] in 1996.

The two-picture deal promised full creative control for the young director below an agreed budget limit, and Welles's intention was to feature the [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]] in his productions. Shooting had still not begun on a Welles film after a year, but after a meeting with writer [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] Welles had a suitable project.\n\nIn mid-1940, filming began on ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', portraying the life of a press magnate (played by Welles) who starts out as an [[idealism|idealist]] but eventually turns into a corrupt, lonely old man. The film featured Cotten prominently in the role of Kane's best friend [[Sources for Citizen Kane#Jedediah Leland|Jedediah Leland]], eventually a drama critic for one of Kane's papers.\n\nWhen released on May 1, 1941, ''Citizen Kane'' \u2014 based in part on the life of [[William Randolph Hearst]] \u2014 did not do much business at theaters; Hearst owned numerous major newspapers, and forbade them to carry advertisements for the film. Nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]] in 1942, the film won only for Best Screenplay, for Mankiewicz and Welles. ''Citizen Kane'' launched the film careers of the Mercury Players, including [[Agnes Moorehead]] (who played Kane's mother), [[Ruth Warrick]] (Kane's first wife), and [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] (Kane's political opponent). However, Cotten was the only one of the four to find major success as a lead in Hollywood outside of ''Citizen Kane''; Moorehead and Collins became successful character film actors and Warrick spent decades in a career in daytime television.\n\n[[Alexander Korda]] then hired Cotten to play [[Merle Oberon]]'s leading man in ''[[Lydia (film)|Lydia]]'' (1941). \"I didn't care about the movies, really,\" Cotten said later. \"I was tall. I had curly hair. I could talk. It was easy to do.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\n===''The Magnificent Ambersons'' and ''Journey Into Fear''===\nCotten starred in Welles's adaptation and production of ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942). After the commercial disappointment of ''Citizen Kane'', RKO was apprehensive about the new film, and after poor preview responses, cut it by nearly an hour before its release. Though at points the film appeared disjointed, it was well received by critics. Despite the critical accolades Cotten received for his performance, he was again snubbed by the Academy.\n\nCotten was cast in the [[Nazism|Nazi]]-related thriller ''[[Journey into Fear (1943 film)|Journey into Fear]]'' (1943) based on the novel by [[Eric Ambler]]. It was originally scripted by [[Ben Hecht]] but Welles, who was supervising, disliked it, and he rewrote it with Cotten.<ref>{{cite news| title= Welles Actor Teamed With Michele Morgan: John Carroll Borrowed New ...| last= Schallert| first= Edwin | work= Los Angeles Times | date= April 26, 1941| page= A9}}</ref> Released by RKO, the Mercury production was directed by [[Norman Foster (director)|Norman Foster]].

The two-picture deal promised full creative control for the young director below an agreed budget limit, and Welles's intention was to feature the [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]] in his productions. Shooting had still not begun on a Welles film after a year, but after a meeting with writer [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] Welles had a suitable project.\n\nIn mid-1940, filming began on ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', portraying the life of a press magnate (played by Welles) who starts out as an [[idealism|idealist]] but eventually turns into a corrupt, lonely old man. The film featured Cotten prominently in the role of Kane's best friend [[Sources for Citizen Kane#Jedediah Leland|Jedediah Leland]], eventually a drama critic for one of Kane's papers.\n\nWhen released on May 1, 1941, ''Citizen Kane'' \u2014 based in part on the life of [[William Randolph Hearst]] \u2014 did not do much business at theaters; Hearst owned numerous major newspapers, and forbade them to carry advertisements for the film. Nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]] in 1942, the film won only for Best Screenplay, for Mankiewicz and Welles. ''Citizen Kane'' launched the film careers of the Mercury Players, including [[Agnes Moorehead]] (who played Kane's mother), [[Ruth Warrick]] (Kane's first wife), and [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] (Kane's political opponent). However, Cotten was the only one of the four to find major success as a lead in Hollywood outside of ''Citizen Kane''; Moorehead and Collins became successful character film actors and Warrick spent decades in a career in daytime television.\n\n[[Alexander Korda]] then hired Cotten to play [[Merle Oberon]]'s leading man in ''[[Lydia (film)|Lydia]]'' (1941). \"I didn't care about the movies, really,\" Cotten said later. \"I was tall. I had curly hair. I could talk. It was easy to do.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\n===''The Magnificent Ambersons'' and ''Journey Into Fear''===\nCotten starred in Welles's adaptation and production of ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942). After the commercial disappointment of ''Citizen Kane'', RKO was apprehensive about the new film, and after poor preview responses, cut it by nearly an hour before its release. Though at points the film appeared disjointed, it was well received by critics. Despite the critical accolades Cotten received for his performance, he was again snubbed by the Academy.\n\nCotten was cast in the [[Nazism|Nazi]]-related thriller ''[[Journey into Fear (1943 film)|Journey into Fear]]'' (1943) based on the novel by [[Eric Ambler]]. It was originally scripted by [[Ben Hecht]] but Welles, who was supervising, disliked it, and he rewrote it with Cotten.<ref>{{cite news| title= Welles Actor Teamed With Michele Morgan: John Carroll Borrowed New ...| last= Schallert| first= Edwin | work= Los Angeles Times | date= April 26, 1941| page= A9}}</ref> Released by RKO, the Mercury production was directed by [[Norman Foster (director)|Norman Foster]].
