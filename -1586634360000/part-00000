It served in the eastern theater, in and around [[Fortress Monroe, Virginia]].\n\n==History==\n\nResponding to President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s call in mid-April 1861, for [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|75,000 men to serve for three months]] to help put down the rebellion, Governor [[Erastus Fairbanks]] ordered the recruitment of the regiment.\n\nThe regiment was organized from militia companies from the following towns, as follows:\n* A \u2013 [[Swanton (town), Vermont|Swanton]]\n* B \u2013 [[Woodstock, Vermont|Woodstock]]\n* C \u2013 [[St. Albans (city), Vermont|St. Albans]]\n* D \u2013 [[Bradford, Vermont|Bradford]]\n* E \u2013 [[Cavendish, Vermont|Cavendish]]\n* F \u2013 [[Northfield, Vermont|Northfield]]\n* G \u2013 [[Brandon, Vermont|Brandon]]\n* H \u2013 [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]]\n* I \u2013 [[Middlebury, Vermont|Middlebury]]\n* K \u2013 [[Rutland (town), Vermont|Rutland]]\n\nCaptain [[John W. Phelps]], of [[Brattleboro, Vermont|Brattleboro]], an 1836 graduate of the [[United States Military Academy]], and a 23-year veteran of the regular army, was chosen to command the regiment and commissioned as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. Militia Captain [[Peter T. Washburn]] of Woodstock, later Adjutant General and [[Governor of Vermont|Governor]] of [[Vermont]], was appointed [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]]. Among the officers was future Governor [[Roswell Farnham]] and future [[Medal of Honor]] recipient [[William Y. W. Ripley]].\n\nThe ten companies rendezvoused at Rutland, on May 2, 1861, and went into camp on the fairgrounds south of the city, called ''Camp Fairbanks,'' in honor of the governor. The regiment was mustered into United States service on May 8, and the next day departed for New York City, where it arrived on May 10. Rutland businessman [[Horace Henry Baxter]], then serving as Adjutant General of the Vermont Militia, used personal funds to ensure that 1st Vermont soldiers were equipped and paid, and he rode at their head as they left Vermont. On May 11, the regiment embarked the steamer ''Alabama,'' and arrived at Fortress Monroe on May 13.\n\nOn May 23, the regiment made the first reconnaissance upon Virginia soil by United States troops, marching six miles from Fortress Monroe to [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]]. On May 26, the regiment took the steamers ''Cataline'' and ''Monticello,'' up [[Hampton Roads]] to [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], where they made camp, which ended up being their home for the rest of its stay in Virginia.\n\nOn June 10, five companies of the 1st Vermont, along with five companies of the [[4th Massachusetts Infantry]], were at the [[Battle of Big Bethel]].\n\nOn August 4, the regiment embarked the steamers ''Ben de Ford'' and ''. R. Spaulding,'' and sailed to New Haven, Connecticut, then took a train to Brattleboro, arriving there on August 9. The men were paid off and mustered out on August 15 and 16.\n\nThe regiment mustered in 38 officers and 743 enlisted men. One enlisted man was killed in action, four died of disease, and one died due to an accident. One officer resigned his commission, four enlisted men were discharged for disability, and two deserted. Five-sixths of the members of this regiment subsequently enlisted for three years. Two hundred and fifty served as field and line officers in Vermont and neighboring states' units.\n\n==See also==\n\n[[Vermont in the Civil War]]\n\n==References==\n\n* Benedict, G.

The headquarters of many of Yunnan's large businesses are in Kunming. It was important during [[World War II]] as a Chinese military center, [[United States|American]] air base, and transport terminus for the [[Burma Road]]. Located in the middle of the [[Yunnan\u2013Guizhou Plateau]], Kunming is located at an altitude of {{convert|1900|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and at a [[latitude]] just north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]].

The city has an [[Yunnan Astronomical Observatory|astronomical observatory]], and its institutions of higher learning include [[Yunnan University]], [[Yunnan Normal University]], [[Kunming University of Science and Technology]], and [[Kunming Medical University]]. On the northeast mountainous outskirt is a [[Golden Temple Park|bronze temple]] dating from the Ming dynasty, the largest of its kind in China.\n\nIts economic importance derives from its geographical position. It is positioned near the border with [[Southeast Asia|Southeastern Asian]] countries, serving as a [[Transportation in Yunnan|transportation hub]] in Southwest China, linking by rail to [[Vietnam]] and by road to [[Burma]], [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]]. This positioning also makes it an important trade center in this region of the nation. It also houses some manufacturing, chiefly the processing of copper, as well as various chemicals, machinery, textiles, paper and cement. Though having a nearly 2,400-year history, its modern prosperity dates only from 1910, when the railway from [[Hanoi]] was built. The city has continued to develop rapidly under China's modernization efforts. Kunming's streets have widened while office buildings and housing projects develop at a fast pace. Kunming has been designated a special tourism center and as such sports a proliferation of [[high-rise]]s and [[luxury hotel]]s.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of Yunnan}}\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nKunming long profited from its position on the caravan roads through to [[South-East Asia]], [[India]] and [[Tibet]]. Early townships in the southern edge of [[Lake Dianchi]] (outside the contemporary city perimeter) can be dated back to 279 BC, although they have been long lost to history. Early settlements in the area around [[Lake Dian]] date back to [[Neolithic]] times. The [[Dian Kingdom]], whose original language was likely related to [[Tibeto-Burman language]]s was also established near the area.<ref>''The Peopling of East Asia'', pp. 192</ref>\n\nDian was subjugated by the Chinese [[Han dynasty]] under the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] in 109 BC. The Han dynasty incorporated the territory of the Dian Kingdom into their [[Yizhou Commandery]], but left the King of Dian as the local ruler.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Altera/dian.html|title=Dian \u6ec7 (www.chinaknowledge.de)|last=Theobald|first=Ulrich|website=www.chinaknowledge.de|language=en|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Han dynasty]] (205 BC\u2013AD 220), seeking control over the [[Tea Horse Road|Southern Silk Road]] running to Burma and India, brought small parts of Yunnan into China's orbit, though subsequent dynasties could do little to tame what was then a remote and wild [[border]]land. During the [[Sui dynasty]] (581\u2013618), two military expeditions were launched against the area, and it was renamed ''Kunzhou'' in Chinese sources.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The geography of China : sacred and historic places|date=2011|publisher=Britannica Educational Pub. in association with Rosen Education Services|others=Pletcher, Kenneth.|isbn=9781615301829|edition=1st|location=New York, NY|pages=260|oclc=656841273}}</ref>\n\n=== Medieval China ===\n[[File:\u5730\u85cf\u5bfa\u7ecf\u5e62 \u5de6\u540e\u65b9\u6444.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Sutra Stone Pillar, Dali Kingdom period.]]\nFounded in 765, Kunming was known to the Chinese as ''Tuodong'' (\u62d3\u4e1c) city in the [[Kingdom of Nanzhao]] (737\u2013902) during the 8th and 9th centuries.<ref name=\":0\" /> Tuodong later became part of the successor [[Kingdom of Dali]] (937\u20131253).

Later in 1678 when Wu died, his grandson [[Wu Shifan]] resisted the Qing for two more months before committing suicide, thereby reverting control of the city back into Qing hands. During the Ming and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, it was the seat of the [[Yunnan|superior prefecture of Yunnan]].\n\nThe area was first dubbed Kunming in the period towards the decline of the Yuan dynasty and later still in 1832, the beginnings of a real city were acknowledged within the city walls and significant structures within their confines. Founding of the city can, therefore be said to have been a predominantly 19th century affair. It was also in this century that the city grew to become the major market and transport centre for the region. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}  Many of the city's inhabitants were displaced as a result of the [[1833 Kunming earthquake]].\n\nThe rebel leader [[Du Wenxiu]], the Muslim Han Sultan of [[Kingdom of Dali|Dali]], attacked and besieged the city several times between 1858 and 1868. Many of the city's wealth did not survived the 1856 [[Panthay Rebellion]], when most of the Buddhist sites in the capital were bad damaged, converted to mosques or razed. Decades later, Kunming began to be influenced by the West, especially from the [[French colonial empires|French Empire]]. In the 1890s, an uprising against working conditions on the Kunming\u2013Haiphong rail line saw many laborers executed after France shipped in weapons to suppress the revolt. The meter-gauge rail line, only completed by around 1911, was designed by the French so that they could tap Yunnan's mineral resources for their colonies in Indochina.\n\nKunming was a [[communications]] [[transport hub|center]] in early times and a junction of two major trading routes, one westward via [[Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture|Dali]] and [[Tengchong County]] into [[Myanmar]], the other southward through [[Mengzi County]] to the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] in [[Indochina]]. Eastward, a difficult mountain route led to [[Guiyang]] in Guizhou province and thence to [[Hunan]] province. To the northeast was a well-established trade trail to [[Yibin]] in Sichuan province on the [[Yangtze River]]. But these trails were all extremely difficult, passable only by mule trains or pack-carrying porters.\n\n[[File:Old kunming city01.jpg|thumb|Old Kunming quarter, containing the narrow and curved ''Sister Buildings'' (\u59ca\u59b9\u697c) behind the Victory Monument on Guanghua Jie, located across the street to the north of the old Bird and Flower Market]]\n\n=== After Qing dynasty ===\n\"In the late 1800s, the French started to build the Kunming-Haiphong railway for trade and shipping of weapons\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Creativity and Culture in Greater China: The Role of Government, Individuals, & Groups|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_E2vBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT64|chapter=Social Needs and Aspirations: Heritage, Urbanization, Revitalization, Lifestile, and Accessibility}}</ref>\n\nKunming reverted to county status in 1912, under the name Kunming, and became a municipality in 1935. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The opening of the Kunming area began in earnest with the completion in 1906\u20131910 of the [[Yunnan-Vietnam Railway]] to [[Haiphong]] in north [[Vietnam]] (part of [[France|French]] [[Indochina]]).\n\nKunming became a [[treaty port]] opening to foreign trade in 1908 and soon became a commercial center.<ref name=\":0\" /> A [[Yunnan University|university]] was set up in 1922. In the 1930s the first highways were built, linking Kunming with [[Chongqing]] in Sichuan and [[Guiyang]] in Guizhou to the east. \n\n=== Second World War ===\nKunming was transformed into a modern city as a result of the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937 when the invading [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese forces]] caused a great number of east-coast Chinese refugees, some of whom were wealthy, to flood into the southwest of China. They brought with them dismantled industrial plants, which were then re-erected beyond the range of Japanese bombers. {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} In addition, a number of [[National Southwestern Associated University|universities]] and institutes of higher education were evacuated there. The increased trade and expertise quickly established Kunming as an industrial and manufacturing base for the wartime government in [[Chongqing]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nAs China's military forces and civilians retreated outside the reach of the Japanese military forces a year prior to the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in Europe, Kunming became a new training hub for the battered but regrouped [[Chinese Air Force (disambiguation)|Chinese Air Force]] in which Lieutenant General [[Claire Lee Chennault]] took command of cadet training duties in the summer of 1938. During the Second World War the city of Kunming was prepared as a [[National Redoubt]] in case the temporary capital in [[Chongqing]] fell, an elaborate system of caves to serve as offices, barracks and factories was prepared but never utilised. Kunming was to have served again in this role during the ensuing [[Chinese Civil War]], but the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] garrison switched sides and joined the Communists. Instead [[Taiwan]] would become the last redoubt and home of the Chinese Nationalist government, a role it fulfills to this day.<ref>{{cite news|title=Last Stand|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,855050,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]]|date=19 December 1949|accessdate=3 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102121625/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,855050,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|archive-date=2 January 2008|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Japanese occupied [[French Indochina]] in 1940, the links between Kunming and the west grew increasingly vital as Allied forces provided essential support by importing materials from [[Burma]].

The [[Office of Strategic Services]]' Service Unit [[Detachment 101]] (predecessor to the [[1st Special Forces Group]]) was also headquartered in Kunming and whose mission was to divert and disrupt Japanese combat operations in Burma.<ref>\"Special Operations Association\" (2005) By Special Operations Association.

The city government in 1952 ordered hundreds of young people to tear down the wall and use its bricks to make a new road running north\u2013south. To show its appreciation for the young people that demolished the east wall, the city government named the new street after them. Their existence still echoes today in place names like Xiao Ximen (\u5c0f\u897f\u95e8, 'Lesser west gate') and Beimen Jie (\u5317\u95e8\u8857, 'North gate Street'). There are also less obvious connections to the wall, such as Qingnian Lu (\u9752\u5e74\u8def, 'Youth Road'), which was once Kunming's east wall.\n\nAfter 1949, Kunming developed rapidly into an [[Metropolitan Regions of China|industrial metropolis]] with the construction of large iron and steel and chemical complexes, along with [[Chongqing]], [[Chengdu]] and [[Guiyang]] in the [[Southwest China|southwest]]. A [[Yunnan Institute for Nationalities|Minorities' Institute]] was set up in the 1950s to promote mutual understanding and access to university education among Yunnan's multiethnic population. The city consolidated its position as a supply depot during the [[Vietnam War]] and subsequent [[Sino-Vietnamese War|border clashes]]. Until Mao Zedong's death, Kunming was still generally thought in much of the rest of the country as a remote frontier settlement and so it acted as a place up to then for the government to exile people who had fallen politically out of favor, especially during the [[Cultural Revolution]].\n\nIn 1957, Kunming's rail link to Hanoi was re-opened (after being cut during World War II). It was cut again in 1979.\n\n[[File:KunmingOldNew.jpg|thumb|An old wooden house and a modern skyscraper in the background]]\n\nSince the [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|economic reforms]] of the mid-1980s, Kunming has enjoyed increased [[Tourism in China|tourism]] and [[Economy of China|foreign investment]], for instance investors from [[Thailand]] trace their ancestries back to Yunnan. Several [[Thai Chinese]] banks have offices in Kunming, for example, [[Kasikorn Bank]] and [[Krung Thai Bank]]. [[Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn]] of Thailand has visited Kunming many times to study Chinese culture and promote friendly relations. {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nRail link to Vietnam re-opened again in 1996.\n\nIn July 2005, the second [[Greater Mekong Subregion]] (GMS) Summit was held in Kunming, with government leaders from China, Laos, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam participating. There, China agreed to lend its neighbors more than $1&nbsp;billion for a series of projects. China was then promoting GMS cooperation as a first step toward building an eventual China-[[ASEAN]] [[Free Trade Area]].\n\nInfrastructure improvements have been underway to improve links between Kunming and Southeast Asia in time for the 2010 China-ASEAN Free Trade Area. The FTA is expected to make Kunming a trade and financial center for Southeast Asia. In addition to physical improvements to enhance Kunming's trade with Southeast Asia, the central and provincial governments have made financial preparations to assist the city's emergence. At the end of 2004, the central government approved Kunming to be one of the 18 mainland cities in which foreign banks could conduct business in [[renminbi]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the city center was rebuilt, with Swiss help, in its current 'modern' style to impress visitors attending the [[1999 World Horticultural Exposition]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/333018.stm |title=China hosts giant horticultural expo |accessdate=21 January 2008 |date=1 May 1999 |work=BBC World Service }}</ref> It was primarily during 1997 and 1998 that much of the city's roads, bridges and high rises were built.\n\n[[File:Kunming night.jpg|thumb|Kunming night]]\n\nThe World Horticultural Expo was widely regarded as a [[public relations]] success for Kunming.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Today the after-effects of the Expo are apparent in more than just the physical improvements to the city\u2014it was the Expo that made the outside world take notice of Kunming, which was relatively unknown at the time.{{dubious|date=March 2014}}\n\nIn July 2006, talks at the [[ASEAN Regional Forum]], China, Bangladesh and Myanmar (Burma) agreed to construct a highway from Kunming to [[Chittagong]] through [[Mandalay]] for trade and development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.people.com.cn/200607/31/eng20060731_288288.html |title=(Xinhua) |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date=31 July 2006 |accessdate=23 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318165659/http://english.people.com.cn/200607/31/eng20060731_288288.html |archive-date=18 March 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 1 March 2014, 29 people died, and more than 130 were injured at Kunming Railway Station in what the Chinese [[Xinhua News Agency]] described as [[2014 Kunming attack|a terrorist attack]].<ref>{{Cite news | title = Chinese security official vows harsh punishment for terrorists | publisher = [[Xinhua News Agency]] | date = 2 March 2014 | url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-03/02/c_133153473.htm | access-date = 2 March 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140305134619/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-03/02/c_133153473.htm | archive-date = 5 March 2014 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Txu-oclc-10552568-ng48-9.jpg|left|thumb|Map including Kunming (labeled as K'UN-MING (Y\u00dcNNANFU) {{lang|zh|\u6606\u660e}}) ([[Army Map Service|AMS]], 1954)]]\n[[File:\u897f\u5c71\u8fdc\u773a\u6ec7\u6c60.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Dian]]]]\n[[File:Kunming at sunrise.jpg|thumb|Kunming at dawn, from the peak of Changchongshan ({{lang|zh-hans|\u957f\u866b\u5c71}}).]]\n[[File:Kunming from Yu'an Shan.jpg|thumb|Panoramic view of northern central Kunming taken from Yu'an Shan Cemetery ({{lang|zh|\u7389\u5b89\u5c71\u516c\u5893}}), looking northeast to east-southeast.]]\n\nKunming is located in east-central [[Yunnan]] province.

Qingnian Lu, Zhengyi Lu, and Renmin Lu are the main commercial areas in Kunming; the most popular pedestrian streets are Nanping Jie, Jingxing Birds-Flowers' Market, and Jinma Biji Fang.\n\nKunming's public focus is the huge square outside the now-demolished Workers' Cultural Hall at the Beijing Lu-Dongfeng Lu intersection, where in the mornings there are crowds doing [[taijiquan]] and playing [[badminton]]. Weekend amateur theatre are also performed in the square. Rapidly being modernized, the city's true center is west of the square across the adjacent [[Panlong River]] (now more of a canal), outside the Kunming Department Store at the Nanping Lu/Zhengyi Lu crossroads, a densely crowded shopping precinct packed with clothing and electronics stores. The river receives [[sewage]] and [[wastewater]] from surrounding pipes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Duan|first=Chang-Qun|last2=Hu|first2=Bin|last3=Wang|first3=Zheng-Hong|last4=Wen|first4=Chuan-Hao|last5=Yan|first5=Shen-Qi|last6=Jiang|first6=Xiao-Hua|last7=Wang|first7=Ding-Kang|last8=Li|first8=Qing|last9=Liang|first9=Xiao-Feng|date=1999-05-19|title=Tradescantia bioassays for the determination of genotoxicity of water in the Panlong River, Kunming, People's Republic of China|url=|journal=Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis|volume=426|issue=2|pages=127\u2013131|doi=10.1016/S0027-5107(99)00054-8|pmid=10350584|issn=0027-5107}}</ref> Surrounding the area are plenty of new high-rises.\n\nThe center is an area of importance to Kunming's [[Hui people|Hui]] population, with Shuncheng Jie, one of the last old streets in the center of the city, previously forming a Muslim quarter. Until shortly before 2005, this street was full of wind-dried beef and mutton carcasses, pitta bread and raisin sellers, and huge woks of roasting coffee beans being stirred with shovels. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Under Kunming's rapid modernisation, however, the street has been demolished to make way for apartments and shopping centers. Rising behind a supermarket one block north off Zhengyi Lu, Nancheng Qingzhen Si is the city's new mosque, its green dome and chevron-patterned minaret visible from afar and built on the site of an earlier [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] edifice.\n\nRunning west off Zhengyi Jie just past the mosque, Jingxing Jie leads into one of the more bizarre corners of the city, with Kunming's huge Bird and Flower Market convening daily in the streets connecting it with the northerly, parallel Guanghua Jie. The market offers many plants such as [[orchids]] that have been collected and farmed across the province. In the small grounds of [[Wen Miao]], a now vanished [[Confucian]] temple off the western end of Changchun Lu, there is an avenue of pines, an ancient pond and pavilion, and beds of bamboo, azaleas and potted palms. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nJinbi Lu runs roughly parallel to and south of Dongfeng Lu, reached from Beijing Lu. Two large [[Chinese pagoda]]s rise in the vicinity, each a solid thirteen stories of whitewashed brick crowned with four iron cockerels. The West Pagoda was built between 824 and 859, during the [[Tang dynasty]]; its original counterpart, the East Pagoda, was built at the same time, but was destroyed by [[1833 Kunming earthquake|an earthquake]] in 1833 and rebuilt in the same Tang style in 1882. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} South down Dongsi Jie, past another [[mosque]], the entrance to the [[Eastern and Western Pagodas|West Pagoda]] is along a narrow lane on the right. In the tiny surrounding courtyard, sociable idlers while away sunny afternoons playing cards and sipping tea in the peaceful, ramshackle surroundings. The [[Eastern and Western Pagodas|East Pagoda]] is a more cosmetic, slightly tilted duplicate standing in an ornamental garden a few minutes' walk east on Shulin Jie. The temples associated with both pagodas are closed to the public.\n[[File:Kunming 04.JPG|alt=|thumb|Central Kunming]]\n\n=== Parks ===\n\n[[File:XishanHuatingTemple.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Huating Temple]] (\u534e\u4ead\u5bfa) in the [[Western Hills Forest Reserve|Western Hills]] near Kunming]]\n\n[[Cuihu Park]] (Green Lake Park) is one of Kunming's major parks and is predominately a lake surrounded by greenery.

Food aside, one feature of less formal [[Yunnanese cuisine|Yunnanese]] restaurants is that they often have a communal bamboo water pipe and tobacco for their customers. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} There are plenty of student bars and clubs. The city has several operatic troupes and indigenous entertainments which include ''huadeng'', a lantern dance. Although indoor performances are lacking, there are often informal shows at the weekend outside the Workers' Cultural Hall and in Cuihu Park. There are similar shows at the Yunnan Arts Theater on Dongfeng Xi Lu. Kunming's main cinema house is on the south side of the Dongfeng Lu/Zhengyi Lu intersection. The other main multiplex, the XJS, at the junction of Wenlin Jie and Dongfeng Xi Lu.\n\n=== Language ===\n\n{{Further|Kunming dialect}}\n\nThe Kunming dialect is very similar to that of Sichuan and Guizhou but uses the third tone much less than standard Chinese. Many terms are used only in Kunming dialect, such as \"{{lang|zh|\u677f\u624e}}\" meaning 'terrific'.\n\nThe pronunciations of certain Chinese characters are very different from [[Mandarin Chinese]]. For example, \"\u9c7c (fish)\" would be pronounced as \"yi\" in Kunming dialect instead of \"yu\" in Mandarin Chinese; \"\u8857 (street)\" would be pronounced as \"gai\" instead of \"jie\". \n\nWhen someone speaks Mandarin Chinese with a strong Kunming accent, it'll be called Mapu (\u9a6c\u666e), short for Majie (\u9a6c\u8857, a place in Kunming) Mandarin Chinese (\u666e\u901a\u8bdd).\n\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\n[[File:Kunming-canal-20030824.jpg|thumb|Panlong River]]\n\nKunming attracts domestic and foreign tourists year round. At the center of Yunnan and as its capital, Kunming is also a [[transport hub]] for tourists heading to other parts of Yunnan such as [[Dali, Yunnan|Dali]], [[Lijiang City|Lijiang]] and [[Shangri-La County|Shangrila]].\n\nConference and exhibition venues in Kunming include the Kunming International Convention and Exhibition Center and the Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Hall.\n\n[[Kingdom of the Little People]], a theme park featuring performers with [[dwarfism]], is also located near Kunming.<ref name=tnyt>{{cite news|last=LaFraniere|first=Sharon|title=A Miniature World Magnifies Dwarf Life|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/world/asia/04dwarfs.html|accessdate=13 May 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006232159/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/world/asia/04dwarfs.html|archive-date=6 October 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOther famous attractions include [[Stone Forest]] and Yunnan's Ethnic Village.\n\n== Sports ==\n\nEvery year, many Chinese and international athletes come to Kunming for high-altitude training. The city has been China's national high-elevation training base for more than 30 years. There are two major training complexes, [[Hongta Sports Center]] and [[Haigeng National Training Center]].<ref name=\"highaltitudetrainingcenters\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gokunming.com/en/blog/item/526/chinas_highaltitude_training_centers |title=China's high-altitude training centers |publisher=Gokunming.com |accessdate=23 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711110008/http://www.gokunming.com/en/blog/item/526/chinas_highaltitude_training_centers |archive-date=11 July 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHongta Sports Center was built in 2000 by Hongta (Red Pagoda) cigarette company, at a cost of US$58&nbsp;million. Located near [[Haigeng Park]], the complex is mostly used by professional athletes, but also acts as a sports club for the general public. Every weekend, it hosts amateur football matches. Aside from about 10 football pitches, including one surrounded by a running track, Hongta also has a {{convert|50|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=off}} swimming pool, a badminton gymnasium, tennis courts and a basketball court. It also has one of China's few ice hockey rinks, and a workout room with treadmills and weightlifting machines. There are also game rooms for air hockey; also pool tables and a basement bowling alley. The complex comes complete with a 101-room hotel and restaurant.<ref name=\"highaltitudetrainingcenters\"/>\n\nHaigeng National Training Center is located ten minutes away from Hongta on Dianchi (Lake Dian) near Kunming's award-winning Lakeview Golf Club and new condominium developments. This complex dates from the late 1970s and was built by the government specifically to specialize in high-altitude training.<ref name=\"highaltitudetrainingcenters\"/>\n\n=== Golf ===\n\n[[Golf]] is a major attraction in Kunming. There are four [[golf course]]s within an hour's drive of downtown. For the last six years {{When|date=June 2016}}, Spring City Golf and Lake Resort in nearby Yiliang County has reigned as the best golf course in China and Hong Kong according to ''US Golf Digest''.

Due to its position at the center of Yunnan, one of China's largest producers of agricultural products, minerals and [[hydroelectricity]], Kunming is the main commercial hub for most of the province's resources.\n\nKunming's chief industries are [[copper]], [[lead]] and [[zinc]] production. Its [[iron]] and [[steel]] industry has been expanded. [[Salt]] and [[phosphate]] mines around Kunming are some of the largest in China. [[Yunnan Copper Company Limited]], based in Kunming, is one of Yunnan's largest mining corporations. From the late 1970s, Kunming's main industries also came to include food and tobacco processing and the manufacture of [[construction equipment]] and machines. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn May 1995, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] approved Kunming as an Open City. By the end of 1995, the city had approved 929 overseas-funded enterprises with a total investment of $2.3&nbsp;billion including $1.1&nbsp;billion of foreign capital. More than 40 projects each had an investment of more than $9&nbsp;million.\n\nKunming is a center of [[engineering]] and the manufacture of [[machine tool]]s, [[electrical machine]]ry, [[electrical equipment|equipment]] and [[automobile]]s (including [[heavy goods vehicle]]s). It has a [[chemical industry]], and [[plastics]], [[cement]] works and [[textile]] [[factories]]. Its processing [[plant]]s, which include [[tanneries]], [[woodworking]] and [[papermaking]] factories, use [[Agriculture in China|local agricultural products]]. In 1997, Yunnan Tire Co. opened a tire plant in Kunming, with a capacity to produce two million tires per year. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n=== Development zones ===\n\nKunming has two major development zones, [[Kunming High-tech Industrial Development Zone]] (biological medicine, new materials, electronic information, photoelectron, agriculture) and [[Kunming Economic and Technology Development Zone]] (mechanical equipment production, biological science and food industry, information industry, software).\n\n=== Industrial parks ===\n\nThere are 30 key industrial parks promulgated and recognized by [[National Development and Reform Commission]] in Yunnan Province.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://en.km.gov.cn/ColumnInfo.aspx?cid=23&page=2 |title=Archived copy |access-date=17 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006225849/http://en.km.gov.cn/ColumnInfo.aspx?cid=23 |archive-date=6 October 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe largest include:\n* Chenggong Industrial Park\n* Anning Industrial Park\n* Songming Yanglin Industrial Development Zone\n* Dongchuan Special Industrial Park\n* Xundian Special Industrial Park\n* Kunming Haikou Industrial Park.\n\n=== Companies ===\n\n{{As of|2008}}, Kunming is home to 65 of the Top 100 Enterprises in Yunnan Province. The top 100 enterprises were based on their revenues for 2007. [[Hongta Group]], with revenues of some [[Renminbi|RMB]]39.88&nbsp;billion for 2007 topped the list. The [[tobacco]] sector remains the largest sector in the province.\n\n=== Flower industry ===\n\nYunnan has developed into the largest flower export base in Asia, with many Dutch experts having transferred technology to the area. The Dounan Flower Market, located in suburban Kunming, is the largest in China with daily sales of 2.5&nbsp;million yuan (US$300,000) from the 2 million sprays of flowers ({{As of|2006|lc=y}}).

It also has direct access to the metropolitan district of [[Chongqing]].\n\nThe Jiaying Depot is connected with the new system of highways built linking Yunnan to the increasingly important markets of [[Southeast Asia]], facilitating cheap Chinese exports to the region and granting resource-poor China greater access to the region's massive raw material resources. Yunnan has thereby become a progressively important area in the [[Southwestern China|Southwest]]'s rail logistics both in terms of national and international logistics.\n\n== Solar energy ==\n[[File:Kunming 102.71986E 25.03390N.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Kunming, situated on the northern shore of [[Lake Dian]]]]\n\nIn July 2008, Kunming began to implement a program to transform the city's [[solar energy]] industry into a US$8.8&nbsp;billion industrial base in China by 2013. Kunming receives an annual average sunshine of more than 2,400 hours. Each 1&nbsp;kW PV system has the potential to generate 1500 kilowatt-hours of electricity a year from solar energy. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n{{As of|2007}}, the Kunming Economic Committee listed about 130 solar energy enterprises in the city. Of these, 118 enterprises produce solar lamps and solar water heaters, with a combined total production value of about US$43.8&nbsp;million, and 10 enterprises are engaged in solar photovoltaic cells manufacturing, with a total production value of about US$51.2&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emerging-china.com/articles/849470.html|title=Kunming aims to build a city run by solar energy|work=emerging-china.com|access-date=12 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808121943/http://www.emerging-china.com/articles/849470.html|archive-date=8 August 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Suntech Power]] announced in December 2008 that it was jointly constructing a solar energy project with Yunnan Provincial Power Investment and other investors.

The [[Chengdu\u2013Kunming railway]] from [[Sichuan]], [[Shanghai\u2013Kunming railway]] from [[Guizhou]], and [[Nanning\u2013Kunming railway]] from [[Guangxi]] converge in Kunming from the north, northeast and east. The [[Yunnan\u2013Vietnam Railway]] runs from Kunming southeast to [[Hekou Yao Autonomous County|Hekou]] and [[Lao Cai]] on the Sino-Vietnamese border and then on to [[Haiphong]] The [[Kunming\u2013Yuxi railway]] runs south to [[Yuxi]], where a second rail line to Vietnam is being planned and built. To the west of Kunming, the [[Guangtong\u2013Dali railway]] extends off the Chengdu\u2013Kunming Line to [[Dali City|Dali]] ([[Xiaguan Town]]).\n\nKunming has three major railway stations:\n*[[Kunming railway station]] is at the southern end of Beijing Xi Lu. Compared with the other railway station (North Railway Station), Kunming Railway Station services most of the \"conventional\" (not high-speed) trains to places to other provinces of China.

Bus travel across the region is extensive. Buses head from Kunming to destinations such as [[Dali, Yunnan|Dali]] and [[Lijiang City|Lijiang]] several times a day.\n\nThere are four major long-distance bus stations in Kunming with the South Bus Station and Railway Square Bus Station being the most primary.\n* South Bus Station faces the Kunming Railway Station in Beijing Xi Lu, with standard, luxury, express and sleeper buses departing for all over Yunnan and neighboring provinces.\n* Railway Square Bus Station is smaller than SBS and the majority of the buses depart from the station are private-run. Usually no fixed schedules are available and buses will leave when they are full. There are standard and sleeper services to Dali, Jinghong and elsewhere in Yunnan.\n\nLeaving China by road into [[Vietnam]] and [[Laos]] is also possible through the respective crossings at Hekou in southeastern Yunnan or [[Bian Mao Zhan]] in [[Xishuangbanna]].\n\nThe [[Kunming\u2013Bangkok Expressway]] is the first [[Expressways of China|expressway from China]] to Bangkok via Laos.

The completion of the new bridge over the Mekong River will help connect China's southeast provinces with Bangkok. With capital investments from both China and Thailand, the bridge is expected to be completed in 2011 and will be the last link in the highway system that winds through the Mekong River region.\n\n==== Local transit ====\n\nPublic buses and taxis are the two main means of transport within the city. A metro system is currently under construction (see [[Kunming Metro]]).\n\nNearly two hundred public bus lines crisscross the city center, covering the whole prefecture.\n\nCycling is common, and many hotels around the Kunming Railway Station provide bicycle rental services.\n\nConscious of its growing traffic issues, the city is currently renovating a [[pedestrian]]-friendly city centre.\n\n==== Central Kunming ====\n\nThe city hangs off two main [[thoroughfare]]s: Beijing Lu forms the north\u2013south axis, passing just east of the center as it runs for {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} between the city's two trains stations; while Dongfeng Lu crosses it halfway along, divided into east (Dongfeng Dong Lu), middle (Dongfeng Zhong Lu) and west (Dongfeng Xi Lu) sections as it cuts right through the business center. The far end runs out of the city as Renmin Xi Lu, the first leg of the [[Burma Road]]. Most of the city's famous hotels and foreign [[consulate]]s lies along Dongfeng Dong Lu and the southern half of Beijing Lu, while the majority of specific landmarks and [[shopping district]] are north and west of the center around Dongfeng Xi Lu and [[Green Lake (Kunming)|Cuihu Park (Green Lake Park)]].

The headquarters of many of Yunnan's large businesses are in Kunming. It was important during [[World War II]] as a Chinese military center, [[United States|American]] air base, and transport terminus for the [[Burma Road]]. Located in the middle of the [[Yunnan\u2013Guizhou Plateau]], Kunming is located at an altitude of {{convert|1900|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and at a [[latitude]] just north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]].

The city has an [[Yunnan Astronomical Observatory|astronomical observatory]], and its institutions of higher learning include [[Yunnan University]], [[Yunnan Normal University]], [[Kunming University of Science and Technology]], and [[Kunming Medical University]]. On the northeast mountainous outskirt is a [[Golden Temple Park|bronze temple]] dating from the Ming dynasty, the largest of its kind in China.\n\nIts economic importance derives from its geographical position. It is positioned near the border with [[Southeast Asia|Southeastern Asian]] countries, serving as a [[Transportation in Yunnan|transportation hub]] in Southwest China, linking by rail to [[Vietnam]] and by road to [[Burma]], [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]]. This positioning also makes it an important trade center in this region of the nation. It also houses some manufacturing, chiefly the processing of copper, as well as various chemicals, machinery, textiles, paper and cement. Though having a nearly 2,400-year history, its modern prosperity dates only from 1910, when the railway from [[Hanoi]] was built. The city has continued to develop rapidly under China's modernization efforts. Kunming's streets have widened while office buildings and housing projects develop at a fast pace. Kunming has been designated a special tourism center and as such sports a proliferation of [[high-rise]]s and [[luxury hotel]]s.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of Yunnan}}\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nKunming long profited from its position on the caravan roads through to [[South-East Asia]], [[India]] and [[Tibet]]. Early townships in the southern edge of [[Lake Dianchi]] (outside the contemporary city perimeter) can be dated back to 279 BC, although they have been long lost to history. Early settlements in the area around [[Lake Dian]] date back to [[Neolithic]] times. The [[Dian Kingdom]], whose original language was likely related to [[Tibeto-Burman language]]s was also established near the area.<ref>''The Peopling of East Asia'', pp. 192</ref>\n\nDian was subjugated by the Chinese [[Han dynasty]] under the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] in 109 BC. The Han dynasty incorporated the territory of the Dian Kingdom into their [[Yizhou Commandery]], but left the King of Dian as the local ruler.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Altera/dian.html|title=Dian \u6ec7 (www.chinaknowledge.de)|last=Theobald|first=Ulrich|website=www.chinaknowledge.de|language=en|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Han dynasty]] (205 BC\u2013AD 220), seeking control over the [[Tea Horse Road|Southern Silk Road]] running to Burma and India, brought small parts of Yunnan into China's orbit, though subsequent dynasties could do little to tame what was then a remote and wild [[border]]land.

Later in 1678 when Wu died, his grandson [[Wu Shifan]] resisted the Qing for two more months before committing suicide, thereby reverting control of the city back into Qing hands. During the Ming and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, it was the seat of the [[Yunnan|superior prefecture of Yunnan]].\n\nThe area was first dubbed Kunming in the period towards the decline of the Yuan dynasty and later still in 1832, the beginnings of a real city were acknowledged within the city walls and significant structures within their confines. Founding of the city can, therefore be said to have been a predominantly 19th century affair. It was also in this century that the city grew to become the major market and transport centre for the region. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}  Many of the city's inhabitants were displaced as a result of the [[1833 Kunming earthquake]].\n\nThe rebel leader [[Du Wenxiu]], the Muslim Han Sultan of [[Kingdom of Dali|Dali]], attacked and besieged the city several times between 1858 and 1868. Many of the city's wealth did not survived the 1856 [[Panthay Rebellion]], when most of the Buddhist sites in the capital were bad damaged, converted to mosques or razed. Decades later, Kunming began to be influenced by the West, especially from the [[French colonial empires|French Empire]]. In the 1890s, an uprising against working conditions on the Kunming\u2013Haiphong rail line saw many laborers executed after France shipped in weapons to suppress the revolt. The meter-gauge rail line, only completed by around 1911, was designed by the French so that they could tap Yunnan's mineral resources for their colonies in Indochina.\n\nKunming was a [[communications]] [[transport hub|center]] in early times and a junction of two major trading routes, one westward via [[Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture|Dali]] and [[Tengchong County]] into [[Myanmar]], the other southward through [[Mengzi County]] to the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] in [[Indochina]]. Eastward, a difficult mountain route led to [[Guiyang]] in Guizhou province and thence to [[Hunan]] province. To the northeast was a well-established trade trail to [[Yibin]] in Sichuan province on the [[Yangtze River]]. But these trails were all extremely difficult, passable only by mule trains or pack-carrying porters.\n\n[[File:Old kunming city01.jpg|thumb|Old Kunming quarter, containing the narrow and curved ''Sister Buildings'' (\u59ca\u59b9\u697c) behind the Victory Monument on Guanghua Jie, located across the street to the north of the old Bird and Flower Market]]\n\n=== After Qing dynasty ===\n\"In the late 1800s, the French started to build the Kunming-Haiphong railway for trade and shipping of weapons\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Creativity and Culture in Greater China: The Role of Government, Individuals, & Groups|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_E2vBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT64|chapter=Social Needs and Aspirations: Heritage, Urbanization, Revitalization, Lifestile, and Accessibility}}</ref>\n\nKunming reverted to county status in 1912, under the name Kunming, and became a municipality in 1935. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The opening of the Kunming area began in earnest with the completion in 1906\u20131910 of the [[Yunnan-Vietnam Railway]] to [[Haiphong]] in north [[Vietnam]] (part of [[France|French]] [[Indochina]]).\n\nKunming became a [[treaty port]] opening to foreign trade in 1908 and soon became a commercial center.<ref name=\":0\" /> A [[Yunnan University|university]] was set up in 1922. In the 1930s the first highways were built, linking Kunming with [[Chongqing]] in Sichuan and [[Guiyang]] in Guizhou to the east. \n\n=== Second World War ===\nKunming was transformed into a modern city as a result of the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937 when the invading [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese forces]] caused a great number of east-coast Chinese refugees, some of whom were wealthy, to flood into the southwest of China. They brought with them dismantled industrial plants, which were then re-erected beyond the range of Japanese bombers. {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} In addition, a number of [[National Southwestern Associated University|universities]] and institutes of higher education were evacuated there. The increased trade and expertise quickly established Kunming as an industrial and manufacturing base for the wartime government in [[Chongqing]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nAs China's military forces and civilians retreated outside the reach of the Japanese military forces a year prior to the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in Europe, Kunming became a new training hub for the battered but regrouped [[Chinese Air Force (disambiguation)|Chinese Air Force]] in which Lieutenant General [[Claire Lee Chennault]] took command of cadet training duties in the summer of 1938. During the Second World War the city of Kunming was prepared as a [[National Redoubt]] in case the temporary capital in [[Chongqing]] fell, an elaborate system of caves to serve as offices, barracks and factories was prepared but never utilised. Kunming was to have served again in this role during the ensuing [[Chinese Civil War]], but the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] garrison switched sides and joined the Communists. Instead [[Taiwan]] would become the last redoubt and home of the Chinese Nationalist government, a role it fulfills to this day.<ref>{{cite news|title=Last Stand|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,855050,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]]|date=19 December 1949|accessdate=3 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102121625/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,855050,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|archive-date=2 January 2008|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Japanese occupied [[French Indochina]] in 1940, the links between Kunming and the west grew increasingly vital as Allied forces provided essential support by importing materials from [[Burma]].

The city government in 1952 ordered hundreds of young people to tear down the wall and use its bricks to make a new road running north\u2013south. To show its appreciation for the young people that demolished the east wall, the city government named the new street after them. Their existence still echoes today in place names like Xiao Ximen (\u5c0f\u897f\u95e8, 'Lesser west gate') and Beimen Jie (\u5317\u95e8\u8857, 'North gate Street'). There are also less obvious connections to the wall, such as Qingnian Lu (\u9752\u5e74\u8def, 'Youth Road'), which was once Kunming's east wall.\n\nAfter 1949, Kunming developed rapidly into an [[Metropolitan Regions of China|industrial metropolis]] with the construction of large iron and steel and chemical complexes, along with [[Chongqing]], [[Chengdu]] and [[Guiyang]] in the [[Southwest China|southwest]]. A [[Yunnan Institute for Nationalities|Minorities' Institute]] was set up in the 1950s to promote mutual understanding and access to university education among Yunnan's multiethnic population. The city consolidated its position as a supply depot during the [[Vietnam War]] and subsequent [[Sino-Vietnamese War|border clashes]]. Until Mao Zedong's death, Kunming was still generally thought in much of the rest of the country as a remote frontier settlement and so it acted as a place up to then for the government to exile people who had fallen politically out of favor, especially during the [[Cultural Revolution]].\n\nIn 1957, Kunming's rail link to Hanoi was re-opened (after being cut during World War II). It was cut again in 1979.\n\n[[File:KunmingOldNew.jpg|thumb|An old wooden house and a modern skyscraper in the background]]\n\nSince the [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|economic reforms]] of the mid-1980s, Kunming has enjoyed increased [[Tourism in China|tourism]] and [[Economy of China|foreign investment]], for instance investors from [[Thailand]] trace their ancestries back to Yunnan. Several [[Thai Chinese]] banks have offices in Kunming, for example, [[Kasikorn Bank]] and [[Krung Thai Bank]]. [[Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn]] of Thailand has visited Kunming many times to study Chinese culture and promote friendly relations. {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nRail link to Vietnam re-opened again in 1996.\n\nIn July 2005, the second [[Greater Mekong Subregion]] (GMS) Summit was held in Kunming, with government leaders from China, Laos, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam participating. There, China agreed to lend its neighbors more than $1&nbsp;billion for a series of projects. China was then promoting GMS cooperation as a first step toward building an eventual China-[[ASEAN]] [[Free Trade Area]].\n\nInfrastructure improvements have been underway to improve links between Kunming and Southeast Asia in time for the 2010 China-ASEAN Free Trade Area. The FTA is expected to make Kunming a trade and financial center for Southeast Asia. In addition to physical improvements to enhance Kunming's trade with Southeast Asia, the central and provincial governments have made financial preparations to assist the city's emergence. At the end of 2004, the central government approved Kunming to be one of the 18 mainland cities in which foreign banks could conduct business in [[renminbi]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the city center was rebuilt, with Swiss help, in its current 'modern' style to impress visitors attending the [[1999 World Horticultural Exposition]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/333018.stm |title=China hosts giant horticultural expo |accessdate=21 January 2008 |date=1 May 1999 |work=BBC World Service }}</ref> It was primarily during 1997 and 1998 that much of the city's roads, bridges and high rises were built.\n\n[[File:Kunming night.jpg|thumb|Kunming night]]\n\nThe World Horticultural Expo was widely regarded as a [[public relations]] success for Kunming.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Today the after-effects of the Expo are apparent in more than just the physical improvements to the city\u2014it was the Expo that made the outside world take notice of Kunming, which was relatively unknown at the time.{{dubious|date=March 2014}}\n\nIn July 2006, talks at the [[ASEAN Regional Forum]], China, Bangladesh and Myanmar (Burma) agreed to construct a highway from Kunming to [[Chittagong]] through [[Mandalay]] for trade and development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.people.com.cn/200607/31/eng20060731_288288.html |title=(Xinhua) |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date=31 July 2006 |accessdate=23 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318165659/http://english.people.com.cn/200607/31/eng20060731_288288.html |archive-date=18 March 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 1 March 2014, 29 people died, and more than 130 were injured at Kunming Railway Station in what the Chinese [[Xinhua News Agency]] described as [[2014 Kunming attack|a terrorist attack]].<ref>{{Cite news | title = Chinese security official vows harsh punishment for terrorists | publisher = [[Xinhua News Agency]] | date = 2 March 2014 | url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-03/02/c_133153473.htm | access-date = 2 March 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140305134619/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-03/02/c_133153473.htm | archive-date = 5 March 2014 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Txu-oclc-10552568-ng48-9.jpg|left|thumb|Map including Kunming (labeled as K'UN-MING (Y\u00dcNNANFU) {{lang|zh|\u6606\u660e}}) ([[Army Map Service|AMS]], 1954)]]\n[[File:\u897f\u5c71\u8fdc\u773a\u6ec7\u6c60.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Dian]]]]\n[[File:Kunming at sunrise.jpg|thumb|Kunming at dawn, from the peak of Changchongshan ({{lang|zh-hans|\u957f\u866b\u5c71}}).]]\n[[File:Kunming from Yu'an Shan.jpg|thumb|Panoramic view of northern central Kunming taken from Yu'an Shan Cemetery ({{lang|zh|\u7389\u5b89\u5c71\u516c\u5893}}), looking northeast to east-southeast.]]\n\nKunming is located in east-central [[Yunnan]] province.

Qingnian Lu, Zhengyi Lu, and Renmin Lu are the main commercial areas in Kunming; the most popular pedestrian streets are Nanping Jie, Jingxing Birds-Flowers' Market, and Jinma Biji Fang.\n\nKunming's public focus is the huge square outside the now-demolished Workers' Cultural Hall at the Beijing Lu-Dongfeng Lu intersection, where in the mornings there are crowds doing [[taijiquan]] and playing [[badminton]]. Weekend amateur theatre are also performed in the square. Rapidly being modernized, the city's true center is west of the square across the adjacent [[Panlong River]] (now more of a canal), outside the Kunming Department Store at the Nanping Lu/Zhengyi Lu crossroads, a densely crowded shopping precinct packed with clothing and electronics stores. The river receives [[sewage]] and [[wastewater]] from surrounding pipes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Duan|first=Chang-Qun|last2=Hu|first2=Bin|last3=Wang|first3=Zheng-Hong|last4=Wen|first4=Chuan-Hao|last5=Yan|first5=Shen-Qi|last6=Jiang|first6=Xiao-Hua|last7=Wang|first7=Ding-Kang|last8=Li|first8=Qing|last9=Liang|first9=Xiao-Feng|date=1999-05-19|title=Tradescantia bioassays for the determination of genotoxicity of water in the Panlong River, Kunming, People's Republic of China|url=|journal=Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis|volume=426|issue=2|pages=127\u2013131|doi=10.1016/S0027-5107(99)00054-8|pmid=10350584|issn=0027-5107}}</ref> Surrounding the area are plenty of new high-rises.\n\nThe center is an area of importance to Kunming's [[Hui people|Hui]] population, with Shuncheng Jie, one of the last old streets in the center of the city, previously forming a Muslim quarter. Until shortly before 2005, this street was full of wind-dried beef and mutton carcasses, pitta bread and raisin sellers, and huge woks of roasting coffee beans being stirred with shovels. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Under Kunming's rapid modernisation, however, the street has been demolished to make way for apartments and shopping centers. Rising behind a supermarket one block north off Zhengyi Lu, Nancheng Qingzhen Si is the city's new mosque, its green dome and chevron-patterned minaret visible from afar and built on the site of an earlier [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] edifice.\n\nRunning west off Zhengyi Jie just past the mosque, Jingxing Jie leads into one of the more bizarre corners of the city, with Kunming's huge Bird and Flower Market convening daily in the streets connecting it with the northerly, parallel Guanghua Jie. The market offers many plants such as [[orchids]] that have been collected and farmed across the province. In the small grounds of [[Wen Miao]], a now vanished [[Confucian]] temple off the western end of Changchun Lu, there is an avenue of pines, an ancient pond and pavilion, and beds of bamboo, azaleas and potted palms. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nJinbi Lu runs roughly parallel to and south of Dongfeng Lu, reached from Beijing Lu. Two large [[Chinese pagoda]]s rise in the vicinity, each a solid thirteen stories of whitewashed brick crowned with four iron cockerels. The West Pagoda was built between 824 and 859, during the [[Tang dynasty]]; its original counterpart, the East Pagoda, was built at the same time, but was destroyed by [[1833 Kunming earthquake|an earthquake]] in 1833 and rebuilt in the same Tang style in 1882. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} South down Dongsi Jie, past another [[mosque]], the entrance to the [[Eastern and Western Pagodas|West Pagoda]] is along a narrow lane on the right. In the tiny surrounding courtyard, sociable idlers while away sunny afternoons playing cards and sipping tea in the peaceful, ramshackle surroundings. The [[Eastern and Western Pagodas|East Pagoda]] is a more cosmetic, slightly tilted duplicate standing in an ornamental garden a few minutes' walk east on Shulin Jie. The temples associated with both pagodas are closed to the public.\n[[File:Kunming 04.JPG|alt=|thumb|Central Kunming]]\n\n=== Parks ===\n\n[[File:XishanHuatingTemple.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Huating Temple]] (\u534e\u4ead\u5bfa) in the [[Western Hills Forest Reserve|Western Hills]] near Kunming]]\n\n[[Cuihu Park]] (Green Lake Park) is one of Kunming's major parks and is predominately a lake surrounded by greenery.

Food aside, one feature of less formal [[Yunnanese cuisine|Yunnanese]] restaurants is that they often have a communal bamboo water pipe and tobacco for their customers. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} There are plenty of student bars and clubs. The city has several operatic troupes and indigenous entertainments which include ''huadeng'', a lantern dance. Although indoor performances are lacking, there are often informal shows at the weekend outside the Workers' Cultural Hall and in Cuihu Park. There are similar shows at the Yunnan Arts Theater on Dongfeng Xi Lu. Kunming's main cinema house is on the south side of the Dongfeng Lu/Zhengyi Lu intersection. The other main multiplex, the XJS, at the junction of Wenlin Jie and Dongfeng Xi Lu.\n\n=== Language ===\n\n{{Further|Kunming dialect}}\n\nThe Kunming dialect is very similar to that of Sichuan and Guizhou but uses the third tone much less than standard Chinese. Many terms are used only in Kunming dialect, such as \"{{lang|zh|\u677f\u624e}}\" meaning 'terrific'.\n\nThe pronunciations of certain Chinese characters are very different from [[Mandarin Chinese]]. For example, \"\u9c7c (fish)\" would be pronounced as \"yi\" in Kunming dialect instead of \"yu\" in Mandarin Chinese; \"\u8857 (street)\" would be pronounced as \"gai\" instead of \"jie\". \n\nWhen someone speaks Mandarin Chinese with a strong Kunming accent, it'll be called Mapu (\u9a6c\u666e), short for Majie (\u9a6c\u8857, a place in Kunming) Mandarin Chinese (\u666e\u901a\u8bdd).\n\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\n[[File:Kunming-canal-20030824.jpg|thumb|Panlong River]]\n\nKunming attracts domestic and foreign tourists year round. At the center of Yunnan and as its capital, Kunming is also a [[transport hub]] for tourists heading to other parts of Yunnan such as [[Dali, Yunnan|Dali]], [[Lijiang City|Lijiang]] and [[Shangri-La County|Shangrila]].\n\nConference and exhibition venues in Kunming include the Kunming International Convention and Exhibition Center and the Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Hall.\n\n[[Kingdom of the Little People]], a theme park featuring performers with [[dwarfism]], is also located near Kunming.<ref name=tnyt>{{cite news|last=LaFraniere|first=Sharon|title=A Miniature World Magnifies Dwarf Life|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/world/asia/04dwarfs.html|accessdate=13 May 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006232159/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/world/asia/04dwarfs.html|archive-date=6 October 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOther famous attractions include [[Stone Forest]] and Yunnan's Ethnic Village.\n\n== Sports ==\n\nEvery year, many Chinese and international athletes come to Kunming for high-altitude training. The city has been China's national high-elevation training base for more than 30 years. There are two major training complexes, [[Hongta Sports Center]] and [[Haigeng National Training Center]].<ref name=\"highaltitudetrainingcenters\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gokunming.com/en/blog/item/526/chinas_highaltitude_training_centers |title=China's high-altitude training centers |publisher=Gokunming.com |accessdate=23 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711110008/http://www.gokunming.com/en/blog/item/526/chinas_highaltitude_training_centers |archive-date=11 July 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHongta Sports Center was built in 2000 by Hongta (Red Pagoda) cigarette company, at a cost of US$58&nbsp;million. Located near [[Haigeng Park]], the complex is mostly used by professional athletes, but also acts as a sports club for the general public. Every weekend, it hosts amateur football matches. Aside from about 10 football pitches, including one surrounded by a running track, Hongta also has a {{convert|50|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=off}} swimming pool, a badminton gymnasium, tennis courts and a basketball court. It also has one of China's few ice hockey rinks, and a workout room with treadmills and weightlifting machines. There are also game rooms for air hockey; also pool tables and a basement bowling alley. The complex comes complete with a 101-room hotel and restaurant.<ref name=\"highaltitudetrainingcenters\"/>\n\nHaigeng National Training Center is located ten minutes away from Hongta on Dianchi (Lake Dian) near Kunming's award-winning Lakeview Golf Club and new condominium developments. This complex dates from the late 1970s and was built by the government specifically to specialize in high-altitude training.<ref name=\"highaltitudetrainingcenters\"/>\n\n=== Golf ===\n\n[[Golf]] is a major attraction in Kunming. There are four [[golf course]]s within an hour's drive of downtown. For the last six years {{When|date=June 2016}}, Spring City Golf and Lake Resort in nearby Yiliang County has reigned as the best golf course in China and Hong Kong according to ''US Golf Digest''.

Due to its position at the center of Yunnan, one of China's largest producers of agricultural products, minerals and [[hydroelectricity]], Kunming is the main commercial hub for most of the province's resources.\n\nKunming's chief industries are [[copper]], [[lead]] and [[zinc]] production. Its [[iron]] and [[steel]] industry has been expanded. [[Salt]] and [[phosphate]] mines around Kunming are some of the largest in China. [[Yunnan Copper Company Limited]], based in Kunming, is one of Yunnan's largest mining corporations. From the late 1970s, Kunming's main industries also came to include food and tobacco processing and the manufacture of [[construction equipment]] and machines. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn May 1995, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] approved Kunming as an Open City. By the end of 1995, the city had approved 929 overseas-funded enterprises with a total investment of $2.3&nbsp;billion including $1.1&nbsp;billion of foreign capital. More than 40 projects each had an investment of more than $9&nbsp;million.\n\nKunming is a center of [[engineering]] and the manufacture of [[machine tool]]s, [[electrical machine]]ry, [[electrical equipment|equipment]] and [[automobile]]s (including [[heavy goods vehicle]]s). It has a [[chemical industry]], and [[plastics]], [[cement]] works and [[textile]] [[factories]]. Its processing [[plant]]s, which include [[tanneries]], [[woodworking]] and [[papermaking]] factories, use [[Agriculture in China|local agricultural products]]. In 1997, Yunnan Tire Co. opened a tire plant in Kunming, with a capacity to produce two million tires per year. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n=== Development zones ===\n\nKunming has two major development zones, [[Kunming High-tech Industrial Development Zone]] (biological medicine, new materials, electronic information, photoelectron, agriculture) and [[Kunming Economic and Technology Development Zone]] (mechanical equipment production, biological science and food industry, information industry, software).\n\n=== Industrial parks ===\n\nThere are 30 key industrial parks promulgated and recognized by [[National Development and Reform Commission]] in Yunnan Province.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://en.km.gov.cn/ColumnInfo.aspx?cid=23&page=2 |title=Archived copy |access-date=17 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006225849/http://en.km.gov.cn/ColumnInfo.aspx?cid=23 |archive-date=6 October 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe largest include:\n* Chenggong Industrial Park\n* Anning Industrial Park\n* Songming Yanglin Industrial Development Zone\n* Dongchuan Special Industrial Park\n* Xundian Special Industrial Park\n* Kunming Haikou Industrial Park.\n\n=== Companies ===\n\n{{As of|2008}}, Kunming is home to 65 of the Top 100 Enterprises in Yunnan Province. The top 100 enterprises were based on their revenues for 2007. [[Hongta Group]], with revenues of some [[Renminbi|RMB]]39.88&nbsp;billion for 2007 topped the list. The [[tobacco]] sector remains the largest sector in the province.\n\n=== Flower industry ===\n\nYunnan has developed into the largest flower export base in Asia, with many Dutch experts having transferred technology to the area. The Dounan Flower Market, located in suburban Kunming, is the largest in China with daily sales of 2.5&nbsp;million yuan (US$300,000) from the 2 million sprays of flowers ({{As of|2006|lc=y}}).

It also has direct access to the metropolitan district of [[Chongqing]].\n\nThe Jiaying Depot is connected with the new system of highways built linking Yunnan to the increasingly important markets of [[Southeast Asia]], facilitating cheap Chinese exports to the region and granting resource-poor China greater access to the region's massive raw material resources. Yunnan has thereby become a progressively important area in the [[Southwestern China|Southwest]]'s rail logistics both in terms of national and international logistics.\n\n== Solar energy ==\n[[File:Kunming 102.71986E 25.03390N.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Kunming, situated on the northern shore of [[Lake Dian]]]]\n\nIn July 2008, Kunming began to implement a program to transform the city's [[solar energy]] industry into a US$8.8&nbsp;billion industrial base in China by 2013. Kunming receives an annual average sunshine of more than 2,400 hours. Each 1&nbsp;kW PV system has the potential to generate 1500 kilowatt-hours of electricity a year from solar energy. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n{{As of|2007}}, the Kunming Economic Committee listed about 130 solar energy enterprises in the city. Of these, 118 enterprises produce solar lamps and solar water heaters, with a combined total production value of about US$43.8&nbsp;million, and 10 enterprises are engaged in solar photovoltaic cells manufacturing, with a total production value of about US$51.2&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emerging-china.com/articles/849470.html|title=Kunming aims to build a city run by solar energy|work=emerging-china.com|access-date=12 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808121943/http://www.emerging-china.com/articles/849470.html|archive-date=8 August 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Suntech Power]] announced in December 2008 that it was jointly constructing a solar energy project with Yunnan Provincial Power Investment and other investors.

The [[Chengdu\u2013Kunming railway]] from [[Sichuan]], [[Shanghai\u2013Kunming railway]] from [[Guizhou]], and [[Nanning\u2013Kunming railway]] from [[Guangxi]] converge in Kunming from the north, northeast and east. The [[Yunnan\u2013Vietnam Railway]] runs from Kunming southeast to [[Hekou Yao Autonomous County|Hekou]] and [[Lao Cai]] on the Sino-Vietnamese border and then on to [[Haiphong]] The [[Kunming\u2013Yuxi railway]] runs south to [[Yuxi]], where a second rail line to Vietnam is being planned and built. To the west of Kunming, the [[Guangtong\u2013Dali railway]] extends off the Chengdu\u2013Kunming Line to [[Dali City|Dali]] ([[Xiaguan Town]]).\n\nKunming has three major railway stations:\n*[[Kunming railway station]] is at the southern end of Beijing Xi Lu. Compared with the other railway station (North Railway Station), Kunming Railway Station services most of the \"conventional\" (not high-speed) trains to places to other provinces of China.

Bus travel across the region is extensive. Buses head from Kunming to destinations such as [[Dali, Yunnan|Dali]] and [[Lijiang City|Lijiang]] several times a day.\n\nThere are four major long-distance bus stations in Kunming with the South Bus Station and Railway Square Bus Station being the most primary.\n* South Bus Station faces the Kunming Railway Station in Beijing Xi Lu, with standard, luxury, express and sleeper buses departing for all over Yunnan and neighboring provinces.\n* Railway Square Bus Station is smaller than SBS and the majority of the buses depart from the station are private-run. Usually no fixed schedules are available and buses will leave when they are full. There are standard and sleeper services to Dali, Jinghong and elsewhere in Yunnan.\n\nLeaving China by road into [[Vietnam]] and [[Laos]] is also possible through the respective crossings at Hekou in southeastern Yunnan or [[Bian Mao Zhan]] in [[Xishuangbanna]].\n\nThe [[Kunming\u2013Bangkok Expressway]] is the first [[Expressways of China|expressway from China]] to Bangkok via Laos.

The completion of the new bridge over the Mekong River will help connect China's southeast provinces with Bangkok. With capital investments from both China and Thailand, the bridge is expected to be completed in 2011 and will be the last link in the highway system that winds through the Mekong River region.\n\n==== Local transit ====\n\nPublic buses and taxis are the two main means of transport within the city. A metro system is currently under construction (see [[Kunming Metro]]).\n\nNearly two hundred public bus lines crisscross the city center, covering the whole prefecture.\n\nCycling is common, and many hotels around the Kunming Railway Station provide bicycle rental services.\n\nConscious of its growing traffic issues, the city is currently renovating a [[pedestrian]]-friendly city centre.\n\n==== Central Kunming ====\n\nThe city hangs off two main [[thoroughfare]]s: Beijing Lu forms the north\u2013south axis, passing just east of the center as it runs for {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} between the city's two trains stations; while Dongfeng Lu crosses it halfway along, divided into east (Dongfeng Dong Lu), middle (Dongfeng Zhong Lu) and west (Dongfeng Xi Lu) sections as it cuts right through the business center. The far end runs out of the city as Renmin Xi Lu, the first leg of the [[Burma Road]]. Most of the city's famous hotels and foreign [[consulate]]s lies along Dongfeng Dong Lu and the southern half of Beijing Lu, while the majority of specific landmarks and [[shopping district]] are north and west of the center around Dongfeng Xi Lu and [[Green Lake (Kunming)|Cuihu Park (Green Lake Park)]].

The system was expanded in 2017 to allow individuals to receive an email alert when a child is reported missing near to them.<ref>{{cite web |title=ADAM: Cutting Edge Technology |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LZqfBz5D4w |website=YouTube}}</ref> \n\nIn 2017, a feature was added to ADAM to allow NCMEC to focus on a highway where a missing child and abductor may be travelling in order to distribute posters to recipients along the relevant corridor. Combining this filter along with the system\u2019s radius search allows for broad, yet targeted, poster coverage. Functionality was added to ADAM to allow members of the public to sign up for missing child email alerts in their area. More than 1.8 million individuals, private enterprises, hospitals, schools, news outlets and law agencies have signed up to receive automated ADAM alerts.\n\n==== U.K. ====\nIn 2017, LexisNexis Risk Solutions began working with the charity Missing People and the UK National Crime Agency to support their Child Rescue Alert service, which disseminates missing alerts via text message. Along with Charlie Hedges Advisory (one of the U.K.\u2019s foremost experts on missing persons), LexisNexis Risk Solutions and Missing People scoped a training course to assist law enforcement, schools, hospitals and others with missing cases, particularly those involving children who are abducted and/or trafficked.\n\n===Food Stamp Fraud Prevention===\nSince 2013, the Florida Department of Children Families has used LexisNexis Risk Solutions to identity management solutions to prevent food stamp fraud and improve operational efficiencies, achieving a total cost avoidance of more than $843.7 million.\n\n===Humanitarian Emergency Education  ===\nIn 2017, LexisNexis Risk Solutions developed the Global Business Coalition for Education\u2019s Rapid Education Action (REACT) database to record private sector educational contributions and assets that can be deployed quickly in the wake of a humanitarian emergency.\n\n=== Law Enforcement ===\n\n====PSDE Database====\nThe Public Safety Data Exchange (PSDEX) is a contributory database that of more than 1,300 law enforcement agencies across the U.S. that was created by LexisNexis Risk Solutions. PSDEX helps its participants solve crimes, identify threats and anticipate future threats. LexisNexis Risk Solutions created an Advisory Committee to advise on policy and governance of PSDEX data, to help assure adherence to federal Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS), state and local standards for security and privacy of law enforcement-provided data. The PSDEX Advisory Committee is composed of former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Secret Service, metropolitan police department and other criminal justice experts, in partnership with LexisNexis Risk Solutions leaders.\n\n====LexisNexis Accurint Virtual Crime Center====\nThe LexisNexis Accurint Virtual Crime Center gives law enforcement \u201cgreater visibility into crime in both their jurisdictions and nationwide by linking billions of public records with agency-provided data.\u201d It links to PSDEX and brings together disconnected data to provide a more comprehensive view of people\u2019s identities so that that law enforcement agencies can better target investigations, identify patterns, predict upcoming events and deploy resources more efficiently.\n\n==Controversies==<!-- This section is linked from [[ChoicePoint]] -->\n===Antitrust Challenge===\nOn February 21, 2008, Reed Elsevier announced plans to acquire ChoicePoint, Inc. for $3.6 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/technology/21iht-reed.4.10279549.html|title=Reed Elsevier to acquire ChoicePoint for $3.6 billion|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=17 April 2019}}</ref> The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) challenged the proposed acquisition, charging that it would be anti-competitive and in violation of the antitrust laws as the acquisition \u201cwould combine the two largest providers of electronic public record services to U.S. law enforcement customers.\u201d In order to expedite regulatory clearance from the FTC, ChoicePoint agreed to divest a portion of its U.S. public records business serving the government sector. On September 16, 2008, Reed Elsevier announced that it received clearance to proceed with the acquisition.\n\n=== Data Breaches and Settlements ===\nIn October 2009, the FTC ordered ChoicePoint (which was by then a part of LexisNexis Risk Solutions) to pay $275,000 to consumers to settle charges that it violated a previous settlement order stemming from a 2005 data breach. The FTC charged that ChoicePoint had failed to implement a court-ordered information security program and alleged that an unauthorized person was subsequently able to access the company\u2019s database in 2008. The alleged incident took place prior to Reed Elsevier\u2019s acquisition of ChoicePoint.  \n\n=== Federal Contract Compliance Programs Settlement ===\nIn January 2017, LexisNexis Risk Solutions reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) to pay over $1.2 million to resolve allegations of systemic pay discrimination against women at its facilities in Alpharetta, Georgia, and Boca Raton, Florida.\n\n=== Automobile Accident Report Settlement ===\nOn July 2, 2019, LexisNexis Risk Solutions reached a settlement agreement<ref>https://www.law360.com/newjersey/articles/1175207/states-reach-6m-deal-with-lexisnexis-over-withheld-fees</ref> resolving a multi-jurisdictional investigation and complaint regarding the resale of automobile accident reports. The settlement, which included no finding or admission of wrongdoing or liability by LexisNexis Risk Solutions or any LexisNexis entity, involved a disagreement over the meaning of contract language about payments made to law enforcement customers after crash reports are resold. Although LexisNexis Risk Solutions disagreed with the interpretation of the contracts by the jurisdictions, the company ultimately decided to settle. The settlement agreement with the participating state and city governments included payments that were be passed on to the agencies in those jurisdictions with which the company contracted to benefit the affected law enforcement agencies.\n\n==See also==\n*[[LexisNexis]]\n*[[RELX]]\n*[[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Reed Elsevier}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Business services companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Fulton County, Georgia]]\n[[Category:Information privacy]]\n[[Category:2008 mergers and acquisitions]]\n[[Category:American subsidiaries of foreign companies]]\n", "text_old": "{{For2|the sister legal research company|[[LexisNexis]]|the unrelated vehicle brand|[[Lexus]]}}{{Infobox company\n| name = LexisNexis Risk Solutions\n| logo = \n| type = [[Subsidiary]]\n| founded = 2011\n| location = [[Alpharetta, Georgia|Alpharetta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n| key_people = Mark Kelsey, CEO\n| industry = [[Service (economics)|Business Services]]\n| num_employees = 6,300 (2018)<ref name=20F2017>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/929869/000119312518053616/d528576d20f.htm|title=US SEC: Form 20-F Relx Group|publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]|accessdate=Jan 11, 2019}}</ref>\n| revenue = \n| products = Advanced Analytics; Compliance; Credit Risk; Customer Experience; Acquisition and Retention; Data Management; Identity Management; Fraud Prevention; Collections and Investigations\n| homepage = https://risk.lexisnexis.com/\n| parent = [[RELX]]\n}}\n'''LexisNexis Risk Solutions''' is a global data and analytics company that provides data and technology services, analytics, predictive insights, and fraud prevention for a wide range of industries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=142699969|title=About LexisNexis Risk Solutions|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=17 April 2019}}</ref> It is headquartered in [[Alpharetta, Georgia]] (part of the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]]) and has offices throughout the U.S. and in Australia, Brazil, China, Hong Kong SAR, India, Ireland, Israel, Philippines and the U.K. The company\u2019s customers include businesses within the insurance, financial services, healthcare and corporate sectors as well as the local, state and federal government, law enforcement and public safety. \n\nLexisNexis Risk Solutions operates within the Risk & Business Analytics market segment of [[RELX]], a [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] information and analytics company based in [[London]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.relx.com/~/media/Files/R/RELX-Group/documents/reports/annual-reports/2018-annual-report.pdf|title=RELX Annual Report|publisher=RELX|accessdate=17 April 2019}}</ref>\n==Overview==\n===Market Segments===\n\nLexisNexis Risk Solutions operates in four market segments:\n\n* Insurance Services\n* Business Services\n* Health Care Services\n* Government Services\n\n===Technology=== \n\nLexisNexis Risk Solutions uses HPCC Systems, also known as DAS (Data Analytics Supercomputer), extensively<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-XpYsF5cZ0|title=HPCC|publisher=SAIConference|accessdate=17 April 2019}}</ref>\u2014its [[Software architecture|software architecture]] runs from [[Commodity computing|commodity computing clusters]] to provide high-performance, data-parallel processing for [[Big data|big data]] applications.

The system was expanded in 2017 to allow individuals to receive an email alert when a child is reported missing near to them.<ref>{{cite web |title=ADAM: Cutting Edge Technology |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LZqfBz5D4w |website=YouTube}}</ref> \n\nIn 2017, a feature was added to ADAM to allow NCMEC to focus on a highway where a missing child and abductor may be travelling in order to distribute posters to recipients along the relevant corridor. Combining this filter along with the system\u2019s radius search allows for broad, yet targeted, poster coverage. Functionality was added to ADAM to allow members of the public to sign up for missing child email alerts in their area. More than 1.8 million individuals, private enterprises, hospitals, schools, news outlets and law agencies have signed up to receive automated ADAM alerts.\n\n==== U.K. ====\nIn 2017, LexisNexis Risk Solutions began working with the charity Missing People and the UK National Crime Agency to support their Child Rescue Alert service, which disseminates missing alerts via text message. Along with Charlie Hedges Advisory (one of the U.K.\u2019s foremost experts on missing persons), LexisNexis Risk Solutions and Missing People scoped a training course to assist law enforcement, schools, hospitals and others with missing cases, particularly those involving children who are abducted and/or trafficked.\n\n===Food Stamp Fraud Prevention===\nSince 2013, the Florida Department of Children Families has used LexisNexis Risk Solutions to identity management solutions to prevent food stamp fraud and improve operational efficiencies, achieving a total cost avoidance of more than $843.7 million.\n\n===Humanitarian Emergency Education  ===\nIn 2017, LexisNexis Risk Solutions developed the Global Business Coalition for Education\u2019s Rapid Education Action (REACT) database to record private sector educational contributions and assets that can be deployed quickly in the wake of a humanitarian emergency.\n\n=== Law Enforcement ===\n\n====PSDE Database====\nThe Public Safety Data Exchange (PSDEX) is a contributory database that of more than 1,300 law enforcement agencies across the U.S. that was created by LexisNexis Risk Solutions. PSDEX helps its participants solve crimes, identify threats and anticipate future threats. LexisNexis Risk Solutions created an Advisory Committee to advise on policy and governance of PSDEX data, to help assure adherence to federal Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS), state and local standards for security and privacy of law enforcement-provided data. The PSDEX Advisory Committee is composed of former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Secret Service, metropolitan police department and other criminal justice experts, in partnership with LexisNexis Risk Solutions leaders.\n\n====LexisNexis Accurint Virtual Crime Center====\nThe LexisNexis Accurint Virtual Crime Center gives law enforcement \u201cgreater visibility into crime in both their jurisdictions and nationwide by linking billions of public records with agency-provided data.\u201d It links to PSDEX and brings together disconnected data to provide a more comprehensive view of people\u2019s identities so that that law enforcement agencies can better target investigations, identify patterns, predict upcoming events and deploy resources more efficiently.\n\n==Controversies==<!-- This section is linked from [[ChoicePoint]] -->\n===Antitrust Challenge===\nOn February 21, 2008, Reed Elsevier announced plans to acquire ChoicePoint, Inc. for $3.6 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/technology/21iht-reed.4.10279549.html|title=Reed Elsevier to acquire ChoicePoint for $3.6 billion|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=17 April 2019}}</ref> The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) challenged the proposed acquisition, charging that it would be anti-competitive and in violation of the antitrust laws as the acquisition \u201cwould combine the two largest providers of electronic public record services to U.S. law enforcement customers.\u201d In order to expedite regulatory clearance from the FTC, ChoicePoint agreed to divest a portion of its U.S. public records business serving the government sector. On September 16, 2008, Reed Elsevier announced that it received clearance to proceed with the acquisition.\n\n=== Data Breaches and Settlements ===\nIn October 2009, the FTC ordered ChoicePoint (which was by then a part of LexisNexis Risk Solutions) to pay $275,000 to consumers to settle charges that it violated a previous settlement order stemming from a 2005 data breach. The FTC charged that ChoicePoint had failed to implement a court-ordered information security program and alleged that an unauthorized person was subsequently able to access the company\u2019s database in 2008. The alleged incident took place prior to Reed Elsevier\u2019s acquisition of ChoicePoint.  \n\n=== Federal Contract Compliance Programs Settlement ===\nIn January 2017, LexisNexis Risk Solutions reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) to pay over $1.2 million to resolve allegations of systemic pay discrimination against women at its facilities in Alpharetta, Georgia, and Boca Raton, Florida.\n\n=== Automobile Accident Report Settlement ===\nOn July 2, 2019, LexisNexis Risk Solutions reached a settlement agreement<ref>https://www.law360.com/newjersey/articles/1175207/states-reach-6m-deal-with-lexisnexis-over-withheld-fees</ref> resolving a multi-jurisdictional investigation and complaint regarding the resale of automobile accident reports. The settlement, which included no finding or admission of wrongdoing or liability by LexisNexis Risk Solutions or any LexisNexis entity, involved a disagreement over the meaning of contract language about payments made to law enforcement customers after crash reports are resold. Although LexisNexis Risk Solutions disagreed with the interpretation of the contracts by the jurisdictions, the company ultimately decided to settle. The settlement agreement with the participating state and city governments included payments that were be passed on to the agencies in those jurisdictions with which the company contracted to benefit the affected law enforcement agencies.\n\n==See also==\n*[[LexisNexis]]\n*[[RELX]]\n*[[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Reed Elsevier}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Business services companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Fulton County, Georgia]]\n[[Category:Information privacy]]\n[[Category:2008 mergers and acquisitions]]\n[[Category:American subsidiaries of foreign companies]]\n", "name_user": "Nihiltres", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Simplified hatnote syntax", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LexisNexis_Risk_Solutions"}

He advocated the use of wiretaps in national security cases without obtaining a court order (''[[United States v. U.S. District Court]]'') and the right of police to employ the preventive detention of criminal suspects. He brought [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charges against critics of the [[Vietnam War]], likening them to [[brown shirts]] of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]] in Germany.\n\nMitchell expressed a reluctance to involve the Justice Department in some [[civil rights]] issues. \"The Department of Justice is a law enforcement agency,\" he told reporters. \"It is not the place to carry on a program aimed at curing the ills of society.\" However, he also told activists, \"You will be better advised to watch what we do, not what we say.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/14/opinion/essay-watch-what-we-do.html|title=Watch What We Do|author=William Safire|date=November 14, 1988|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=July 22, 2017|author-link=William Safire}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=91IFAYFhtOMC&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4|title=Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations|last=James H.

After being instructed by the federal courts that segregation was unconstitutional and that the executive branch was required to enforce the rulings of the courts, Mitchell began to comply, threatening to withhold federal funds from those school systems that were still segregated and threatening legal action against them.\n\nSchool segregation had been struck down as unconstitutional by a unanimous Supreme Court decision in 1954 (''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''), but in 1955, the Court ruled that desegregation needed to be accomplished only with \"[[all deliberate speed]],\" <ref>Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294 (1955)</ref> which many Southern states interpreted as an invitation to delay. It was not until 1969 that the Supreme Court renounced the \"all deliberate speed\" rule and declared that further delay in accomplishing desegregation was no longer permissible.<ref>See, e.g., Alexander v.

He called for the use of [[No-knock warrant|\"no-knock\" warrants]] for police to enter homes, [[frisking]] suspects without a warrant, [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]], [[preventive detention]], the use of federal troops to repress crime in the capital, a restructured Supreme Court, and a slowdown in school desegregation. \"This country is going so far to the right you won't recognize it,\" he told a reporter.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/10/obituaries/john-n-mitchell-dies-at-75-major-figure-in-watergate.html|title=John N.

Nixon appointed [[William Ruckelshaus]] to head the agency, which opened its doors December 2, 1970. Mitchell gave a Press Conference  December 18, 1970: \u201cI would like to call attention to an area of activity that we have not publicly emphasized lately, but which I feel, because of the changing events, deserves your attention. I refer to the pollution control litigation, with particular reference to our work with the new Environmental Protection Agency, now headed by William Ruckelshaus.&nbsp; As in the case of other government departments and agencies, EPA refers civil and criminal suits to the Department of Justice, which determines whether there is a base for prosecution and of course, if we find it so, we proceed with court action.... And today, I would like to announce that we are filing suit this morning against the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation for discharging substantial quantities of cyanide into the Cuyahoga River near Cleveland. Mr. Ruckelshaus has said, when he asked the Department to file this suit, that the 180-day notice filed against the company had expired.

After being instructed by the federal courts that segregation was unconstitutional and that the executive branch was required to enforce the rulings of the courts, Mitchell began to comply, threatening to withhold federal funds from those school systems that were still segregated and threatening legal action against them.\n\nSchool segregation had been struck down as unconstitutional by a unanimous Supreme Court decision in 1954 (''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''), but in 1955, the Court ruled that desegregation needed to be accomplished only with \"[[all deliberate speed]],\" <ref>Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294 (1955)</ref> which many Southern states interpreted as an invitation to delay. It was not until 1969 that the Supreme Court renounced the \"all deliberate speed\" rule and declared that further delay in accomplishing desegregation was no longer permissible.<ref>See, e.g., Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, 396 U.S. 19 (1969)</ref>  As a result, some 70% of black children were still attending segregated schools in 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121158799673718969|title=Reconsidering John Mitchell|first=Jonathan|last=Karl|date=May 24, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=July 22, 2017|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]}}</ref> By 1972, this percentage had decreased to 8%.

He called for the use of [[No-knock warrant|\"no-knock\" warrants]] for police to enter homes, [[frisking]] suspects without a warrant, [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]], [[preventive detention]], the use of federal troops to repress crime in the capital, a restructured Supreme Court, and a slowdown in school desegregation. \"This country is going so far to the right you won't recognize it,\" he told a reporter.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/10/obituaries/john-n-mitchell-dies-at-75-major-figure-in-watergate.html|title=John N.

Mitchell gave a Press Conference  December 18, 1970: \u201cI would like to call attention to an area of activity that we have not publicly emphasized lately, but which I feel, because of the changing events, deserves your attention. I refer to the pollution control litigation, with particular reference to our work with the new Environmental Protection Agency, now headed by William Ruckelshaus.&nbsp; As in the case of other government departments and agencies, EPA refers civil and criminal suits to the Department of Justice, which determines whether there is a base for prosecution and of course, if we find it so, we proceed with court action.... And today, I would like to announce that we are filing suit this morning against the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation for discharging substantial quantities of cyanide into the Cuyahoga River near Cleveland. Mr. Ruckelshaus has said, when he asked the Department to file this suit, that the 180-day notice filed against the company had expired. We are filing a civil suit to seek immediate injunctive relief under the Refuse Act of 1899 and the Federal Water Pollution Act to halt the discharge of these deleterious materials into the river.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ag/legacy/2011/08/23/12-18-1970.pdf|title=Press Conference Attorney John Mitchell 12-18-1970}}</ref>\n\n===Dirty tricks===\nIn an early sample of the \"dirty tricks\" that would later mark the 1971-72 campaign, Mr. Mitchell approved a $10,000 subsidy to employ an [[American Nazi Party]] faction in a bizarre effort to get Alabama Governor [[George Wallace]] off the ballot in California.

''Speakers''. iBiology. Retrieved 5 March 2020. https://www.ibiology.org/speakers/roy-parker/</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAt the [[University of Arizona]], Parker taught [[Cell Biology|Molecular and Cellular Biology]] until 2012 when he moved to be a professor at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]].<ref name=ref19 /> He is currently the Cech-Leinwand Endowed Chair of Biochemistry as well as professor in chemistry and biochemistry courses. Parker also conducts research at the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]].<ref name=ref18 />\n\n==Research Interests==\nThe primary investigations of Parker's research include the analysis of eukaryotic RNA and the effects that flawed types of RNA have on the biochemical mechanisms of the body.<ref name=ref18 /> More technically, Parker aims to explore bodily functions at the [[Molecule|molecular]] level and understand how these processes affect the [[Translation (biology)|translation]], specific placing, and stability of [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]. His lab uses [[yeast]], [[Drosophila|''Drosophila'']], and mice as testing agents to assess the detrimental effects that impaired activity in [[P-bodies|P bodies]] has towards human diseases.<ref name=ref14 />\n===Key Conclusions===\nImportant research findings first began when Parker and his lab team] established the major pathways of eukaryotic mRNA [[cell cycle|turnover]]. These pathways have the potential to generate mRNA degradation and [[Decapping complex|decapping]]. Next, the lab group pinpointed major [[Nuclease|nucleases]] that contribute to mRNA degradation, as well as the molecules that help facilitate this event. Some of these facilitators include decapping [[Enzyme|enzymes]], 3' to 5' decay complexes, and deadenylases. In years following, Parker and his crew collected enough data to conclude that components that trigger decapping interrupt the mechanisms of translation. In other words, Parker determined that decapping and translation could be thought of as rivals, for their mechanisms oppose each other. Finally, most recently, the lab group has discovered [[Cytoplasm|cytoplasmic]] [[Messenger RNP|mRNP]] granules. These contain P bodies and may be critical to biochemical research.<ref name=ref17 />\n\n===Major Contributions===\nIn addition to publishing hundreds of research articles in [[Scientific journal|scientific journals]], Parker has supported the education of students around the country. Some of his talks are published online. These focus on topics including improving graduate training and \"The Life of Eukaryotic mRNA: Localization, Translation, and Degradation\".  These video lectures are published online  aim to teach students, professors, and laboratory researchers.<ref name=ref19 />\n \n==Publications==\nThroughout his education and career, Parker has published 165 original papers and 77 chapters and invited reviews. Some of his most  publications and discoveries include the following:<ref name=ref14 />\n\n'''\u201cPEP4 Gene Function Is Required for Expression of Several Vacuolar Hydrolases in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae\u201d'''(1982) Parker\u2019s first original publication was in 1982 where he worked with two other scientists, Zubenko and Jones, to investigate the role of the PEP4 gene on yeast [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|S. cerevisiae]].<ref name=\"ref11\">Jones, Elizabeth W.; Zubenko, George S.; Parker, Roy R (December 1982). \u201cPEP4 Gene Function Is Required for Expression of Several Vacuolar Hydrolases in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae\u201d.

To do so, Parker and Decker conducted experimentation in four genes by analyzing the degradation of nascent transcripts. They found a connection between both deadenylation rate of mRNA and stability of oligo(A) with mRNA half-lives. More specifically, they looked at the effects of RNA secondary structures and realized that after deadenylation, those without the 5\u2019 sequence began to aggregate. After evaluating these results, they concluded that deadenylation contributes to changes in mRNA, creating an mRNA decay pathway.<ref name=\"ref6\">Decker, Carolyn J.; Parker, Roy (12 April 1993). \u201cA Turnover Pathway for Both Stable and Unstable mRNAs in Yeast: Evidence for a Requirement for Deadenylation\u201d.

They offer evidence that there is a connection between decay rate and turnover pathways of mRNA. After developing conclusions from much observation and research in this study, Parker and Beelman hoped to pinpoint the genetic products that control nucleolytic events and promote degradation pathways.<ref name=\"ref1\">Beelman, Clare A.; Parker, Roy (21 April 1995). \u201cDegradation of mRNA in Eukaryotes\u201d.

They studied yeast models and recognized that P bodies contain [[Protein|proteins]] that initiate decapping, P bodies vanish when mRNA turnover does not occur before decapping, and P bodies are concentrated with intermediates of mRNA degradation. With this information, they concluded that mRNAs move between [[Polysome|polysomes]] and P bodies, and this is a critical aspect of mRNA [[metabolism]] in the cytoplasm.<ref name=\"ref20\">Sheth, Ujwal; Parker, Roy (2 May 2003). \u201cDecapping and Decay of Messenger RNA Occur in Cytoplasmic Processing Bodies\u201d.

These decapping [[Activator (genetics)|activators]] inhibit translation and stimulate the formation of P bodies. Using [[staining]] techniques to identify the activity of decapping activators, they were successfully able to conclude that there is a mechanism which signals mRNAs for decapping and therefore restricts mRNAs from going through translation.<ref name=\"ref5\">Coller, Jeff; Parker, Roy (23 September 2005). \u201cGeneral Translational Repression by Activators of mRNA Decapping\u201d.

P bodies are linked to maternal and neuronal mRNA granules. This link led to uncovering of the relationship between polysomes and mRNAs within P bodies with regards to cytoplasmic mRNA activity. Parker and Sheth\u2019s prime conclusion from this publication is that translation is inhibited, and decay is promoted when mRNA-specific regulatory factors, such as [[microRNA|miRNAs]] and RISC, engage with P bodies.<ref name=\"ref15\">Parker, Roy; Sheth, Ujwal (9 March 2007). \u201cP Bodies and the Control of mRNA Translation and Degradation\u201d.

Parker and Buchan researched that stress granules cause many problems to forms of RNA, particularly mRNAs, by making them less stable and by preventing their translation. They were able to conclude that stress granules may communicate with P bodies to create even more harmful effects to the function of mRNA.<ref name=\"ref3\">Buchan, Ross J.; Parker, Roy (24 December 2009). \u201cEukaryotic Stress Granules: The Ins and Outs of Translation\u201d.

From 1985-1987, Parker worked in laboratories for his [[doctorate|postdoctoral degree]] at both the University of California, San Francisco and the [[University of California, San Diego]].<ref name=\"ref14\">\u201cParker, Roy\u201d. ''CU Experts''. University of Colorado Boulder.

''Speakers''. iBiology. Retrieved 5 March 2020. https://www.ibiology.org/speakers/roy-parker/</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAt the [[University of Arizona]], Parker taught [[Cell Biology|Molecular and Cellular Biology]] until 2012 when he moved to be a professor at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]].<ref name=ref19 /> He is currently the Cech-Leinwand Endowed Chair of Biochemistry as well as professor in chemistry and biochemistry courses. Parker also conducts research at the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]].<ref name=ref18 />\n\n==Research Interests==\nThe primary investigations of Parker's research include the analysis of eukaryotic RNA and the effects that flawed types of RNA have on the biochemical mechanisms of the body.<ref name=ref18 /> More technically, Parker aims to explore bodily functions at the [[Molecule|molecular]] level and understand how these processes affect the [[Translation (biology)|translation]], specific placing, and stability of [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]. His lab uses [[yeast]], [[Drosophila|''Drosophila'']], and mice as testing agents to assess the detrimental effects that impaired activity in [[P-bodies|P bodies]] has towards human diseases.<ref name=ref14 />\n===Key Conclusions===\nImportant research findings first began when Parker and his lab team] established the major pathways of eukaryotic mRNA [[cell cycle|turnover]]. These pathways have the potential to generate mRNA degradation and [[Decapping complex|decapping]]. Next, the lab group pinpointed major [[Nuclease|nucleases]] that contribute to mRNA degradation, as well as the molecules that help facilitate this event. Some of these facilitators include decapping [[Enzyme|enzymes]], 3' to 5' decay complexes, and deadenylases. In years following, Parker and his crew collected enough data to conclude that components that trigger decapping interrupt the mechanisms of translation. In other words, Parker determined that decapping and translation could be thought of as rivals, for their mechanisms oppose each other. Finally, most recently, the lab group has discovered [[Cytoplasm|cytoplasmic]] [[Messenger RNP|mRNP]] granules. These contain P bodies and may be critical to biochemical research.<ref name=ref17 />\n\n===Major Contributions===\nIn addition to publishing hundreds of research articles in [[Scientific journal|scientific journals]], Parker has supported the education of students around the country. Some of his talks are published online. These focus on topics including improving graduate training and \"The Life of Eukaryotic mRNA: Localization, Translation, and Degradation\".  These video lectures are published online  aim to teach students, professors, and laboratory researchers.<ref name=ref19 />\n \n==Publications==\nThroughout his education and career, Parker has published 165 original papers and 77 chapters and invited reviews. Some of his most  publications and discoveries include the following:<ref name=ref14 />\n\n'''\u201cPEP4 Gene Function Is Required for Expression of Several Vacuolar Hydrolases in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae\u201d'''(1982) Parker\u2019s first original publication was in 1982 where he worked with two other scientists, Zubenko and Jones, to investigate the role of the PEP4 gene on yeast [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|S. cerevisiae]].<ref name=\"ref11\">Jones, Elizabeth W.; Zubenko, George S.; Parker, Roy R (December 1982). \u201cPEP4 Gene Function Is Required for Expression of Several Vacuolar Hydrolases in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae\u201d.

To do so, Parker and Decker conducted experimentation in four genes by analyzing the degradation of nascent transcripts. They found a connection between both deadenylation rate of mRNA and stability of oligo(A) with mRNA half-lives. More specifically, they looked at the effects of RNA secondary structures and realized that after deadenylation, those without the 5\u2019 sequence began to aggregate. After evaluating these results, they concluded that deadenylation contributes to changes in mRNA, creating an mRNA decay pathway.<ref name=\"ref6\">Decker, Carolyn J.; Parker, Roy (12 April 1993). \u201cA Turnover Pathway for Both Stable and Unstable mRNAs in Yeast: Evidence for a Requirement for Deadenylation\u201d.

They studied yeast models and recognized that P bodies contain [[Protein|proteins]] that initiate decapping, P bodies vanish when mRNA turnover does not occur before decapping, and P bodies are concentrated with intermediates of mRNA degradation. With this information, they concluded that mRNAs move between [[Polysome|polysomes]] and P bodies, and this is a critical aspect of mRNA [[metabolism]] in the cytoplasm.<ref name=\"ref20\">Sheth, Ujwal; Parker, Roy (2 May 2003). \u201cDecapping and Decay of Messenger RNA Occur in Cytoplasmic Processing Bodies\u201d.

These decapping [[Activator (genetics)|activators]] inhibit translation and stimulate the formation of P bodies. Using [[staining]] techniques to identify the activity of decapping activators, they were successfully able to conclude that there is a mechanism which signals mRNAs for decapping and therefore restricts mRNAs from going through translation.<ref name=\"ref5\">Coller, Jeff; Parker, Roy (23 September 2005). \u201cGeneral Translational Repression by Activators of mRNA Decapping\u201d.

P bodies are linked to maternal and neuronal mRNA granules. This link led to uncovering of the relationship between polysomes and mRNAs within P bodies with regards to cytoplasmic mRNA activity. Parker and Sheth\u2019s prime conclusion from this publication is that translation is inhibited, and decay is promoted when mRNA-specific regulatory factors, such as [[microRNA|miRNAs]] and RISC, engage with P bodies.<ref name=\"ref15\">Parker, Roy; Sheth, Ujwal (9 March 2007). \u201cP Bodies and the Control of mRNA Translation and Degradation\u201d.

Parker and Buchan researched that stress granules cause many problems to forms of RNA, particularly mRNAs, by making them less stable and by preventing their translation. They were able to conclude that stress granules may communicate with P bodies to create even more harmful effects to the function of mRNA.<ref name=\"ref3\">Buchan, Ross J.; Parker, Roy (24 December 2009). \u201cEukaryotic Stress Granules: The Ins and Outs of Translation\u201d.
