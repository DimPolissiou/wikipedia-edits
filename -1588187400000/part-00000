For example, a [[word processor]] is optimized for output to a typical printer. The software often emulates the resolution of the printer in order to get as close as possible to WYSIWYG. However, that is not the main attraction of WYSIWYG, which is the ability of the user to be able to visualize what they are producing.\n\nIn many situations, the subtle differences between what the user sees and what the user gets are unimportant. In fact, applications may offer multiple WYSIWYG modes with different levels of \"realism\", including\n* A composition mode, in which the user sees something somewhat similar to the end result, but which employs an interface more conducive to composing than the layout itself (e.g., inclusion of section breaks and [[non-printing character]]s).\n* A layout mode, in which the user sees something very similar to the end result, but which includes some additional information to facilitate proper alignment and spacing (e.g., margin lines).\n* A preview mode, in which the application attempts to produce an output that is as close to the final result as possible.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Xerox 8010 compound document.jpg|thumb|right|Compound document displayed on [[Xerox Star|Xerox 8010 Star]] system]]\nBefore the adoption of WYSIWYG techniques, text appeared in editors using the system standard [[typeface]] and style with little indication of layout ([[margin (typography)|margins]], [[Line-spacing|spacing]], etc.). Users were required to enter special non-printing ''control codes'' (now referred to as markup ''code tags'') to indicate that some text should be in [[boldface]], [[italic type|italics]], or a different [[typeface]] or size. In this environment there was very little distinction between [[text editor]]s and [[word processor]]s.\n\nThese applications typically used an arbitrary [[markup language]] to define the codes/tags. Each program had its own special way to format a document, and it was a difficult and time-consuming process to change from one word processor to another.\n\nThe use of markup tags and codes remains popular today in some applications due to their ability to store complex formatting information. When the tags are made visible in the editor, however, they occupy space in the unformatted text, and as a result can disrupt the desired layout and flow.\n\n[[Bravo (software)|Bravo]], a document preparation program for the [[Alto (computer)|Alto]] produced at [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]] by [[Butler Lampson]], [[Charles Simonyi]] and colleagues in 1974, is generally considered to be the first program to incorporate the WYSIWYG technology,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.computer.org/web/computingnow/annals/extras/wordvol28n4|title=Computing Now|access-date=22 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007094104/https://www.computer.org/web/computingnow/annals/extras/wordvol28n4|archive-date=7 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> displaying text with formatting (e.g. with justification, fonts, and proportional spacing of characters).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/the-real-history-of-wysiwyg/?_r=0|title=The Real History of WYSIWYG|first=John|last=Markoff|date=|website=nytimes.com|access-date=29 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215161305/https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/the-real-history-of-wysiwyg/?_r=0|archive-date=15 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The Alto monitor (72 [[pixels per inch|PPI]], based on the [[Point (typography)|typographic unit]]) was designed so that one full page of text could be seen and then printed on the first [[laser printer]]s.

Towards the mid-1980s, however, things began to change. as improving technology allowed the production of cheaper bitmapped displays, and WYSIWYG software started to appear in more popular computers, including [[LisaWrite]] for the [[Apple Lisa]], released in 1983, and [[MacWrite]] for the [[Apple Macintosh]], released in 1984.<ref>{{Citation|last=Apple Computer|first=Claris|title=MacWrite|date=1984|url=http://archive.org/details/mac_MacWrite|access-date=2019-07-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190307105416/https://archive.org/details/mac_MacWrite|archive-date=7 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Apple Macintosh]] system was originally designed so that the [[display resolution|screen resolution]] and the resolution of the [[ImageWriter]] [[dot-matrix printer]]s sold by Apple were easily scaled: 72 PPI for the screen and 144 [[dots per inch|DPI]] for the printers. Thus, the scale and dimensions of the on-screen display in programs such as [[MacWrite]] and [[MacPaint]] were easily translated to the printed output. If the paper were held up to the screen, the printed image would be the same size as the on-screen image, but at twice the resolution. As the [[ImageWriter]] was the only model of printer physically compatible with the Macintosh printer port, this created an effective closed system. Later, when Macs-using external displays became available, the resolution was fixed to the size of the screen to achieve 72 DPI. These resolutions often differed from the VGA-standard resolutions common in the PC world at the time. Thus, while a Macintosh {{convert|15|in|cm|adj=on}} monitor had the same 640&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;480 resolution as a PC, a {{convert|16|in|cm|adj=on}} screen would be fixed at 832&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;624 rather than the 800&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;600 resolution used by PCs. With the introduction of third-party dot-matrix printers as well as [[laser printer]]s and [[multisync]] monitors, resolutions deviated from even multiples of the screen resolution, making true WYSIWYG harder to achieve.\n\nIn 2012, Wikipedia offered a WYSIWYG editor called [[VisualEditor]], which allowed edits of Wikipedia to be performed without seeing the page source.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/22/3110130/wikimedia-visual-editor-prototype|title=Wikimedia releases updated prototype for simplified visual editor - The Verge|date=22 June 2012|work=The Verge|accessdate=16 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927065510/http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/22/3110130/wikimedia-visual-editor-prototype|archive-date=27 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Etymology===\nThe phrase \"what you see is what you get\", from which the acronym derives, was a [[catchphrase]] popularized by [[Flip Wilson]]'s drag persona [[Geraldine Jones (character)|Geraldine]], first appearing in September 1969, then regularly in the early 1970s on ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]''. The phrase was a statement demanding acceptance of Geraldine's entire personality and appearance.\n\nFurthermore, multiple hit songs and albums debuted in 1971 that could have also contributed to popularizing this phrase, including \"[[What You See Is What You Get (song)|What You See Is What You Get]]\" by Stoney & Meatloaf, ''[[Stand by Me (Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get)]]'' by Bernard Purdie and ''[[Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get (album)|Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get]]'' by The Dramatics.\n\nAs it relates to computing, there are multiple claims to first use of the phrase:\n* In mid-1975, [[John W. Seybold]], the founder of Seybold Publications, and researchers at [[PARC (company)|PARC]], incorporated [[Gypsy (software)|Gypsy software]] into [[Bravo (software)|Bravo]] to create Bravo 3, which allowed text to be printed as displayed.

These can be seen as tradeoffs between multiple design goals, and hence applications that use different solutions may be suitable for different purposes.\n\nTypically, the design goals of a WYSIWYG application may include the following:\n* Provide high-quality printed output on a particular printer\n* Provide high-quality printed output on a variety of printers\n* Provide high-quality on-screen output\n* Allow the user to visualize what the document will look like when printed\n* Allow the user to visualize what the website will look like when published\n\nHowever, it is usually not possible to achieve all of these goals at once, and the major problem to overcome is that of the varying output resolutions. As of 2016, monitors typically have a resolution of between 102 and 125 pixels per inch, while printers generally have resolutions between 240 and 1440 pixels per inch. In some printers, the horizontal resolution is different from the vertical. This becomes a problem when trying to lay out text; because older output technologies require the spacing between characters to be a whole number of pixels (as rounding errors will cause the same text to require different amounts of space in different resolutions).\n\nSolutions to this include the following:\n* Always laying out the text using a resolution higher than the user is likely to use in practice. This can result in poor quality output for lower resolution devices (although techniques such as [[spatial anti-aliasing]] may help mitigate this), but provides a fixed layout, allowing easy user visualisation. This is the method used by [[Adobe Acrobat]].\n* Laying out the text at the resolution of the printer on which the document will be printed. This can result in low quality on-screen output, and the layout may sometimes change if the document is printed on a different printer (although this problem occurs less frequently with higher resolution printers, as rounding errors are smaller). This is the method used by [[Microsoft Office Word|Microsoft Word]].\n* Laying out the text at the resolution of a specific printer (in most cases the default one) on which the document will be printed using the same font information and kerning. The character positions and number of characters in a line are exactly similar to the printed document.\n* Laying out the text at the resolution for the output device to which it will be sent. This often results in changes in layout between the on-screen display and printed output, so is rarely used (though it could be common in web page designing tools claiming to be WYSIWYG).\n\nOther problems that have been faced in the past include differences in the fonts used by the printer and the on-screen display (largely solved by the use of downloadable font technologies like [[TrueType]]), and differences in color profiles between devices (mostly solved by printer drivers with good color model conversion software).\n\nApart from these issues, the practice of WYSIWYG has also been argued to being more conducive to a distracted writing process, as the WYSIWYG philosophy assumes no [[Separation of content and presentation|separation between composition and formatting]], which opens up the possibility of repeatedly tweaking the layout of the document\u2014as one prepares its content in real-time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/latex-guide/|title=The Definitive, Non-Technical Introduction to LaTeX, Professional Typesetting and Scientific Publishing|date=2015-09-05|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724180126/https://mathvault.ca/latex-guide|archive-date=24 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html|title=Word Processors: Stupid and Inefficient|access-date=22 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925064005/http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html|archive-date=25 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Related acronyms==\nMany variations are used only to illustrate a point or make a joke, and have very limited real use.

For example, a [[word processor]] is optimized for output to a typical printer. The software often emulates the resolution of the printer in order to get as close as possible to WYSIWYG. However, that is not the main attraction of WYSIWYG, which is the ability of the user to be able to visualize what they are producing.\n\nIn many situations, the subtle differences between what the user sees and what the user gets are unimportant. In fact, applications may offer multiple WYSIWYG modes with different levels of \"realism\", including\n* A composition mode, in which the user sees something somewhat similar to the end result, but which employs an interface more conducive to composing than the layout itself (e.g., inclusion of section breaks and [[non-printing character]]s).\n* A layout mode, in which the user sees something very similar to the end result, but which includes some additional information to facilitate proper alignment and spacing (e.g., margin lines).\n* A preview mode, in which the application attempts to produce an output that is as close to the final result as possible.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Xerox 8010 compound document.jpg|thumb|right|Compound document displayed on [[Xerox Star|Xerox 8010 Star]] system]]\nBefore the adoption of WYSIWYG techniques, text appeared in editors using the system standard [[typeface]] and style with little indication of layout ([[margin (typography)|margins]], [[Line-spacing|spacing]], etc.). Users were required to enter special non-printing ''control codes'' (now referred to as markup ''code tags'') to indicate that some text should be in [[boldface]], [[italic type|italics]], or a different [[typeface]] or size. In this environment there was very little distinction between [[text editor]]s and [[word processor]]s.\n\nThese applications typically used an arbitrary [[markup language]] to define the codes/tags. Each program had its own special way to format a document, and it was a difficult and time-consuming process to change from one word processor to another.\n\nThe use of markup tags and codes remains popular today in some applications due to their ability to store complex formatting information. When the tags are made visible in the editor, however, they occupy space in the unformatted text, and as a result can disrupt the desired layout and flow.\n\n[[Bravo (software)|Bravo]], a document preparation program for the [[Alto (computer)|Alto]] produced at [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]] by [[Butler Lampson]], [[Charles Simonyi]] and colleagues in 1974, is generally considered to be the first program to incorporate the WYSIWYG technology,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.computer.org/web/computingnow/annals/extras/wordvol28n4|title=Computing Now|access-date=22 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007094104/https://www.computer.org/web/computingnow/annals/extras/wordvol28n4|archive-date=7 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> displaying text with formatting (e.g. with justification, fonts, and proportional spacing of characters).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/the-real-history-of-wysiwyg/?_r=0|title=The Real History of WYSIWYG|first=John|last=Markoff|date=|website=nytimes.com|access-date=29 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215161305/https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/the-real-history-of-wysiwyg/?_r=0|archive-date=15 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The Alto monitor (72 [[pixels per inch|PPI]], based on the [[Point (typography)|typographic unit]]) was designed so that one full page of text could be seen and then printed on the first [[laser printer]]s.

Towards the mid-1980s, however, things began to change. as improving technology allowed the production of cheaper bitmapped displays, and WYSIWYG software started to appear in more popular computers, including [[LisaWrite]] for the [[Apple Lisa]], released in 1983, and [[MacWrite]] for the [[Apple Macintosh]], released in 1984.<ref>{{Citation|last=Apple Computer|first=Claris|title=MacWrite|date=1984|url=http://archive.org/details/mac_MacWrite|access-date=2019-07-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190307105416/https://archive.org/details/mac_MacWrite|archive-date=7 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Apple Macintosh]] system was originally designed so that the [[display resolution|screen resolution]] and the resolution of the [[ImageWriter]] [[dot-matrix printer]]s sold by Apple were easily scaled: 72 PPI for the screen and 144 [[dots per inch|DPI]] for the printers. Thus, the scale and dimensions of the on-screen display in programs such as [[MacWrite]] and [[MacPaint]] were easily translated to the printed output. If the paper were held up to the screen, the printed image would be the same size as the on-screen image, but at twice the resolution. As the [[ImageWriter]] was the only model of printer physically compatible with the Macintosh printer port, this created an effective closed system. Later, when Macs-using external displays became available, the resolution was fixed to the size of the screen to achieve 72 DPI. These resolutions often differed from the VGA-standard resolutions common in the PC world at the time. Thus, while a Macintosh {{convert|15|in|cm|adj=on}} monitor had the same 640&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;480 resolution as a PC, a {{convert|16|in|cm|adj=on}} screen would be fixed at 832&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;624 rather than the 800&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;600 resolution used by PCs. With the introduction of third-party dot-matrix printers as well as [[laser printer]]s and [[multisync]] monitors, resolutions deviated from even multiples of the screen resolution, making true WYSIWYG harder to achieve.\n\nIn 2012, Wikipedia offered a WYSIWYG editor called [[VisualEditor]], which allowed edits of Wikipedia to be performed without seeing the page source.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/22/3110130/wikimedia-visual-editor-prototype|title=Wikimedia releases updated prototype for simplified visual editor - The Verge|date=22 June 2012|work=The Verge|accessdate=16 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927065510/http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/22/3110130/wikimedia-visual-editor-prototype|archive-date=27 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Etymology===\nThe phrase \"what you see is what you get\", from which the acronym derives, was a [[catchphrase]] popularized by [[Flip Wilson]]'s drag persona [[Geraldine Jones (character)|Geraldine]], first appearing in September 1969, then regularly in the early 1970s on ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]''. The phrase was a statement demanding acceptance of Geraldine's entire personality and appearance.\n\nFurthermore, multiple hit songs and albums debuted in 1971 that could have also contributed to popularizing this phrase, including \"[[What You See Is What You Get (song)|What You See Is What You Get]]\" by Stoney & Meatloaf, ''[[Stand by Me (Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get)]]'' by Bernard Purdie and ''[[Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get (album)|Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get]]'' by The Dramatics.\n\nAs it relates to computing, there are multiple claims to first use of the phrase:\n* In mid-1975, [[John W. Seybold]], the founder of Seybold Publications, and researchers at [[PARC (company)|PARC]], incorporated [[Gypsy (software)|Gypsy software]] into [[Bravo (software)|Bravo]] to create Bravo 3, which allowed text to be printed as displayed.

These can be seen as tradeoffs between multiple design goals, and hence applications that use different solutions may be suitable for different purposes.\n\nTypically, the design goals of a WYSIWYG application may include the following:\n* Provide high-quality printed output on a particular printer\n* Provide high-quality printed output on a variety of printers\n* Provide high-quality on-screen output\n* Allow the user to visualize what the document will look like when printed\n* Allow the user to visualize what the website will look like when published\n\nHowever, it is usually not possible to achieve all of these goals at once, and the major problem to overcome is that of the varying output resolutions. As of 2016, monitors typically have a resolution of between 102 and 125 pixels per inch, while printers generally have resolutions between 240 and 1440 pixels per inch. In some printers, the horizontal resolution is different from the vertical. This becomes a problem when trying to lay out text; because older output technologies require the spacing between characters to be a whole number of pixels (as rounding errors will cause the same text to require different amounts of space in different resolutions).\n\nSolutions to this include the following:\n* Always laying out the text using a resolution higher than the user is likely to use in practice. This can result in poor quality output for lower resolution devices (although techniques such as [[spatial anti-aliasing]] may help mitigate this), but provides a fixed layout, allowing easy user visualisation. This is the method used by [[Adobe Acrobat]].\n* Laying out the text at the resolution of the printer on which the document will be printed. This can result in low quality on-screen output, and the layout may sometimes change if the document is printed on a different printer (although this problem occurs less frequently with higher resolution printers, as rounding errors are smaller). This is the method used by [[Microsoft Office Word|Microsoft Word]].\n* Laying out the text at the resolution of a specific printer (in most cases the default one) on which the document will be printed using the same font information and kerning. The character positions and number of characters in a line are exactly similar to the printed document.\n* Laying out the text at the resolution for the output device to which it will be sent. This often results in changes in layout between the on-screen display and printed output, so is rarely used (though it could be common in web page designing tools claiming to be WYSIWYG).\n\nOther problems that have been faced in the past include differences in the fonts used by the printer and the on-screen display (largely solved by the use of downloadable font technologies like [[TrueType]]), and differences in color profiles between devices (mostly solved by printer drivers with good color model conversion software).\n\nApart from these issues, the practice of WYSIWYG has also been argued to being more conducive to a distracted writing process, as the WYSIWYG philosophy assumes no [[Separation of content and presentation|separation between composition and formatting]], which opens up the possibility of repeatedly tweaking the layout of the document\u2014as one prepares its content in real-time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/latex-guide/|title=The Definitive, Non-Technical Introduction to LaTeX, Professional Typesetting and Scientific Publishing|date=2015-09-05|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724180126/https://mathvault.ca/latex-guide|archive-date=24 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html|title=Word Processors: Stupid and Inefficient|access-date=22 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925064005/http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html|archive-date=25 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Related acronyms==\nMany variations are used only to illustrate a point or make a joke, and have very limited real use.

She is best known as the author of the [[Magic Tree House series|''Magic Tree House'' series]], which {{As of|2017||df=|lc=y}} sold more than 134 million copies worldwide. Both the series and Osborne have won awards, sometimes for Osborne's charitable efforts at promoting children's literacy. One of four children, Osborne moved around in her childhood before attending the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]]. Following college, Osborne traveled before moving to New York City.  She somewhat spontaneously began to write, with her first book being published in 1982. She would go on to write a variety of other kinds of children's and young adult books before starting the Magic Tree House series in 1992. Osborne's sister Natalie Pope Boyce has written several compendium books to the Magic Tree House series, sometimes with Osborne's husband Will.\n\n==Biography==\n=== Childhood ===\nMary Pope Osborne grew up in a military family, alongside her sister, Natalie Pope Boyce, her twin brother, Bill, and younger brother, Michael.<ref name=\"CAO\" /> Her father's career required the family to travel rather extensively and regularly move. Places Osborne lived as a child included Saltzburg, Austria, Oklahoma, and Virginia.<ref name=\"CAO\" />  Osborne herself says of the experience: \"Moving was never traumatic for me, but staying in one place was.\u201d<ref name=\"Random House PDF\">{{cite web|title=Random House Children's Books Presents Mary Pope Osborne|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/kids/pdf/AuthorBioMPOsborne.pdf|website=Random House Children's Book|publisher=Random House|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref> After her father retired, her family settled in a small town in North Carolina. Osborne grew invested in the local community theater spending all her free time there.<ref name=\"CAO\" />\n\n=== College years, traveling, and early career ===\nMary Pope Osborne initially studied drama at the University of North Carolina; in her junior year, however, she switched to a major in religion with a focus on comparative religions.<ref name=\"CAO\" /> After graduating from UNC in 1971,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://englishcomplit.unc.edu/alumni/mary-pope-osborne/|title=Mary Pope Osborne {{!}} UNC English & Comparative Literature|website=englishcomplit.unc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-24}}</ref> Osborne and a friend went traveling.

Their journey took Osborne through 11 different countries throughout Asia, including [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], and [[Pakistan]].<ref name=\"CAO\" /> The trip came to an end when Osborne experienced blood poisoning requiring her to stay in a hospital for a couple of weeks where she read ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Remarking on her travels Osborne said, \"\"That journey irrevocably changed me. Experience was gathered that serves as a reference point every day of my life. I encountered worlds of light and worlds of darkness--and planted seeds of the imagination that led directly to my being an author of children's books.\"<ref name=\"CAO\" />\n\nAfter her travels Osborne lived in California, Washington DC, where she met her husband Will at a theater performance, and New York, where the couple moved after getting married in 1976.<ref name=\":0\" /> During this time, she held jobs including medical assistant, travel agent, drama teacher, bartender, and as an assistant editor for a children's magazine.<ref name=\"CAO\" /> \n\n=== Life as an author ===\nMary Pope Osborne has written over 60 children's stories, with a variety of genres and for a range of children to young adult audiences.Her books have been named to a number of the Best Books of the Year Lists.she has received honors from such organizations as the National Council of Teachers of English, The Children's Book Council, and the International Reading Association.She received the 1992 Reading Association Award 2005 Ludington Memorial Award from the Educational Paperback Association.\n\nMs. Osborne served two separate terms as president of the Authors Guild and also chaired its Children's Book Committee.She has since traveled extensively in the states and throughout the world, visiting schools and speaking on issues related to reading and books.\n\nit was not right before\n\n===  Writing and publication ===\nOsborne's travels and experiences have factored largely into her own writing, while her writing has allowed her to experience some of the thrills of traveling, as she said, \"Without even leaving my home, I\u2019ve traveled around the globe, learning about the religions of the world.\"<ref name=\"Random House PDF\" />\n\nOsborne's writing career began \"one day, out of the blue\"<ref name=\"Random House PDF\" /> when she wrote ''Run, Run As Fast As You Can'' in 1982. The book itself is semi-autobiographical in nature, according to Osborne: \"The girl was a lot like me and many of the incidents in the story were similar to happenings in my childhood.\"<ref name=\"Random House PDF\" /> The book served as the starting point for Osborne's writing career.

She was initially inspired to write the books while working in a teen homeless shelter and realizing that for the teens writing themselves into stories taking place in the Himalayas or Serengeti had a major effect on the teens.<ref name=\"Rock Center\" /> Osborne says she tried writing the book seven different ways before finding a way that worked.\"<ref name=\"NYT2008\" /> It introduces the main characters of Jack and Annie, a brother and sister duo of adventurers who are transported to different areas of time thanks to the titular magic treehouse. The first book established the format for feature books and introduced recurring characters Morgan le Fay and Merlin, as part of the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] motifs. Osborne says she is more like Jack but wishes she was more like Annie.<ref name=\"NYT2008\" />\n\nOsborne tends to place small cliffhangers at the end of each chapter, which has been highlighted as one of the major reasons for the appeal of the books within their target age group.<ref name=\"CAO\" /> Another important factor in their success is the educational nature of the series. The books are cited for their ability to interest students in history and Osborne\u2019s usage of vocabulary encourages young readers to learn new words<ref name=\"CAO\" /> and for their promoting gratitude and cross-cultural understanding in its readers.<ref>Sorensen, S.

She is best known as the author of the [[Magic Tree House series|''Magic Tree House'' series]], which {{As of|2017||df=|lc=y}} sold more than 134 million copies worldwide. Both the series and Osborne have won awards, sometimes for Osborne's charitable efforts at promoting children's literacy. One of four children, Osborne moved around in her childhood before attending the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]]. Following college, Osborne traveled before moving to New York City.  She somewhat spontaneously began to write, with her first book being published in 1982. She would go on to write a variety of other kinds of children's and young adult books before starting the Magic Tree House series in 1992. Osborne's sister Natalie Pope Boyce has written several compendium books to the Magic Tree House series, sometimes with Osborne's husband Will.\n\n==Biography==\n=== Childhood ===\nMary Pope Osborne grew up in a military family, alongside her sister, Natalie Pope Boyce, her twin brother, Bill, and younger brother, Michael.<ref name=\"CAO\" /> Her father's career required the family to travel rather extensively and regularly move.

Osborne grew invested in the local community theater spending all her free time there.<ref name=\"CAO\" />\n\n=== College years, traveling, and early career ===\nMary Pope Osborne initially studied drama at the University of North Carolina; in her junior year, however, she switched to a major in religion with a focus on comparative religions.<ref name=\"CAO\" /> After graduating from UNC in 1971,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://englishcomplit.unc.edu/alumni/mary-pope-osborne/|title=Mary Pope Osborne {{!}} UNC English & Comparative Literature|website=englishcomplit.unc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-24}}</ref> Osborne and a friend went traveling.

Their journey took Osborne through 11 different countries throughout Asia, including [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], and [[Pakistan]].<ref name=\"CAO\" /> The trip came to an end when Osborne experienced blood poisoning requiring her to stay in a hospital for a couple of weeks where she read ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Remarking on her travels Osborne said, \"\"That journey irrevocably changed me. Experience was gathered that serves as a reference point every day of my life. I encountered worlds of light and worlds of darkness--and planted seeds of the imagination that led directly to my being an author of children's books.\"<ref name=\"CAO\" />\n\nAfter her travels Osborne lived in California, Washington DC, where she met her husband Will at a theater performance, and New York, where the couple moved after getting married in 1976.<ref name=\":0\" /> During this time, she held jobs including medical assistant, travel agent, drama teacher, bartender, and as an assistant editor for a children's magazine.<ref name=\"CAO\" /> \n\n=== Life as an author ===\nMary Pope Osborne has written over 60 children's stories, with a variety of genres and for a range of children to young adult audiences.<ref name=\"CAO\" /> Her books have been named to a number of the Best Books of the Year Lists, including, [[School Library Journal]], [[Parents (magazine)|Parents\u2019 Magazine]],  [[The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books]], and [[Bank Street College]].<ref name=\"CAO\" /> She has received honors from such organizations as the National Council of Teachers of English, The Children's Book Council, and the International Reading Association.<ref name=\"CAO\" /> She received the 1992 [[Diamond State (Delaware) Reading Association|Diamond State Reading Association]] Award,<ref name=\"CAO\" /> 2005 Ludington Memorial Award from the Educational Paperback Association<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edupaperback.org/page-864678|title=Mary Pope Osborne Ludington Award|website=Educational Book & Media Association|publisher=Educational Book & Media Association|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref> and the 2010 [[Heidelberger Leander]] Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.leseleben.de/heidelberger-leander/|title=Heidelberger Leander|website=leseleben|publisher=Association for the promotion of language and reading culture in children|language=German|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref> She has also received awards from the Carolina Alumni Association,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://alumni.unc.edu/awards-distinguished-alumnusalumna-award/|title=Distinguished Alumnus/Alumna Award|website=UNC General Alumni Association|publisher=UNC General Alumni Association}}</ref> the Virginia Library Association<ref name=\"CAO\" /> and in spring 2013 she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gazette.unc.edu/2013/04/24/steve-case-four-others-to-receive-honorary-degrees-at-commencement/|title=Steve Case, four others, to receive honorary degrees at Commencement|website=The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|publisher=The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|access-date=2018-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190824203930/https://gazette.unc.edu/2013/04/24/steve-case-four-others-to-receive-honorary-degrees-at-commencement/|archive-date=2019-08-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMs. Osborne served two separate terms as president of the Authors Guild and also chaired its Children's Book Committee.<ref name=\"CAO\" /> She has since traveled extensively in the states and throughout the world, visiting schools and speaking on issues related to reading and books.

The series has sold more than 134 million books worldwide since its debut in 1992<ref name=\"Writer's Life\">{{cite web|url=http://www.shelf-awareness.com/readers-issue.html?issue=581#m10185|title=The Writer's Life|website=Shelf Awareness|publisher=Shelf Awareness|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref> and as of 2007 the series had spent a total 132 weeks on the New York Times Bestsellers List.<ref name=\"Courant\" /> Owing to the successful sales of the books, Osborne for many years resisted efforts to commercialize the characters and books wanting them to live in the imaginations of children.<ref name=\"Rock Center\" />\n\nThe first of the ''Magic Tree House'' books, Dinosaurs Before Dark, was published in 1992. She was initially inspired to write the books while working in a teen homeless shelter and realizing that for the teens writing themselves into stories taking place in the Himalayas or Serengeti had a major effect on the teens.<ref name=\"Rock Center\" /> Osborne says she tried writing the book seven different ways before finding a way that worked.\"<ref name=\"NYT2008\" /> It introduces the main characters of Jack and Annie, a brother and sister duo of adventurers who are transported to different areas of time thanks to the titular magic treehouse. The first book established the format for feature books and introduced recurring characters Morgan le Fay and Merlin, as part of the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] motifs. Osborne says she is more like Jack but wishes she was more like Annie.<ref name=\"NYT2008\" />\n\nOsborne tends to place small cliffhangers at the end of each chapter, which has been highlighted as one of the major reasons for the appeal of the books within their target age group.<ref name=\"CAO\" /> Another important factor in their success is the educational nature of the series. The books are cited for their ability to interest students in history and Osborne\u2019s usage of vocabulary encourages young readers to learn new words<ref name=\"CAO\" /> and for their promoting gratitude and cross-cultural understanding in its readers.<ref>Sorensen, S.

His reign began in 1001 CE and ended in or about 1010. He was the son of [[Jayapala]], whose kingdom used to stretch from Laghman to Kashmir and Sirhind to [[Multan]], with Peshawar being in the center, but had lost most of his territories to [[Sabuktagin]] and his son [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Mahmud]]. Anandapala and his confederacy was defeated by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] when his elephant suddenly took flight and turned the tide of the battle.<ref name=\"Holt\">{{cite book |editor1=Peter Malcolm Holt |editor2=Ann K.

According to 'Ad\u00e1b al-Harb' (pp.&nbsp;307\u201310) in about 990 CE, it is written, ''\"the arrogant but ambitious [[Raja]] of [[Lahore]] Bharat, having put his father in confinement, marched on the country of Jayap\u00e1la with the intention of conquering the districts of [[Nandana]], Jailum (Jehlum) and T\u00e1keshar\"'' (in an attempt to take advantage of Jayapala's concentrated effort with defence against the armies of Ghazni). ''\"Jayapala instructed Prince Anandapala to repel the opportunist Raja Bharat. Anandapala defeated Bharat and took him prisoner in the [[battle of Takeshar]] and marched on Lahore and captured the city and extended his father's kingdom yet further.\"''\n\nHowever, during his reign as emperor many losses were inflicted on his kingdom by the [[Ghaznavids]] of [[Afghanistan]]. During the [[battle of Chach]] between [[Mahmud]] and Anandapala, it is stated that ''\"a body of 30,000 [[Gakhars]] fought alongside as soldiers for the Shahi Emperor and incurred huge losses for the Ghaznavids\"''. However, despite the heavy losses of the enemy, he lost the battle and suffered much financial and territorial loss. This was Anandapala's last stand against [[Sultan]] Mahmud of Ghazni.

His reign began in 1001 CE and ended in or about 1010. He was the son of [[Jayapala]], whose kingdom used to stretch from Laghman to Kashmir and Sirhind to [[Multan]], with Peshawar being in the center, but had lost most of his territories to [[Sabuktagin]] and his son [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Mahmud]]. Anandapala and his confederacy was defeated by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] when his elephant suddenly took flight and turned the tide of the battle.<ref name=\"Holt\">{{cite book |editor1=Peter Malcolm Holt |editor2=Ann K.

According to 'Ad\u00e1b al-Harb' (pp.&nbsp;307\u201310) in about 990 CE, it is written, ''\"the arrogant but ambitious [[Raja]] of [[Lahore]] Bharat, having put his father in confinement, marched on the country of Jayap\u00e1la with the intention of conquering the districts of [[Nandana]], Jailum (Jehlum) and T\u00e1keshar\"'' (in an attempt to take advantage of Jayapala's concentrated effort with defence against the armies of Ghazni). ''\"Jayapala instructed Prince Anandapala to repel the opportunist Raja Bharat. Anandapala defeated Bharat and took him prisoner in the [[battle of Takeshar]] and marched on Lahore and captured the city and extended his father's kingdom yet further.\"''\n\nHowever, during his reign as emperor many losses were inflicted on his kingdom by the [[Ghaznavids]] of [[Afghanistan]]. During the [[battle of Chach]] between [[Mahmud]] and Anandapala, it is stated that ''\"a body of 30,000 [[Gakhars]] fought alongside as soldiers for the Shahi Emperor and incurred huge losses for the Ghaznavids\"''. However, despite the heavy losses of the enemy, he lost the battle and suffered much financial and territorial loss. This was Anandapala's last stand against [[Sultan]] Mahmud of Ghazni. He eventually signed a treaty with the Ghaznavid Empire in 1010 and shortly a year later died as a result of a natural death. [[R. C. Majumdar]] compared him ironically to his dynastic ancient famous ancestor ''\"[[King Porus]]'', who bravely opposed Alexander.<ref>R.C Majumdar (''D.V.

It extends from the [[Anglo-Scottish border]] in the north to near the [[River Trent]] in the south, although precise definitions of its southern extent vary. Northern England approximately comprises three [[Regions of England|statistical regions]]: the [[North East England|North East]], [[North West England|North West]] and [[Yorkshire and the Humber]]. These have a combined population of around 14.9 million as of the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]] and an area of 37,331&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (14,414 sq mi). Northern England contains much of [[National parks of England and Wales|England's national parkland]] but also has large areas of urbanisation, including the [[conurbation]]s of [[Greater Manchester Built-up Area|Greater Manchester]], [[Merseyside]], [[Teesside]], [[Tyneside]], [[Wearside]], and [[Sheffield urban area|South]] and [[West Yorkshire Built-up Area|West Yorkshire]].\n\nThe region has been controlled by many groups, from the [[Brigantes]], the largest [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] kingdom of [[Great Britain]], to the Romans, to [[Anglo-Saxons]] and Danes. After the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] in 1066, the [[Harrying of the North]] brought destruction. The area experienced [[Anglo-Scottish border]] fighting until the [[History of the formation of the United Kingdom|personal union of England and Scotland]] under the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]], with some parts changing hands between England and Scotland many times. Many of the innovations of the [[Industrial Revolution]] began in Northern England, and its cities were the crucibles of many of the political changes that accompanied this social upheaval, from [[trade unionism]] to [[Manchester Liberalism|Manchester Capitalism]]. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the economy of the North was dominated by [[heavy industry]] such as weaving, shipbuilding, steel-making and mining. The [[deindustrialisation]] that followed in the second half of the 20th century hit Northern England hard, and many towns remain deprived compared with those in [[Southern England]].\n\nUrban renewal projects and the transition to a [[service economy]] have resulted in strong economic growth in some parts of Northern England, but a definite [[North\u2013South divide (England)|North\u2013South divide]] remains both in the [[economy of England|economy]] and the [[culture of England]]. Centuries of migration, invasion and labour have shaped Northern culture, and the region retains distinctive dialects, music and cuisine.\n\n{{TOClimit|limit=2}}\n\n==Definitions==\n{{see also|Historical and alternative regions of England}}\n{{Location map many\n| UK England\n| caption = Various \"gateways\" to the North\n<!--first label/marker-->\n| label1 = Watford Gap\n| link1 = Watford Gap\n| coordinates1= {{coord|52.306|-1.124}}\n<!--second label/marker-->\n| label2 = Stoke-on-Trent\n| link2 = Stoke-on-Trent\n| coordinates2= {{coord|53|00|N|2|11|W}}\n<!--third label/marker-->\n| label3 = Crewe\n| link3 = Crewe\n| position3 = left\n| coordinates3= {{coord|53.099|-2.24}}\n<!--fourth label/marker-->\n| label4 = Sheffield\n| link4 = Sheffield\n| coordinates4= {{coord|53|23|01|N|1|28|01|W}}\n<!--fourth label/marker-->\n| label5 = Richmond\n| link5 = Richmond, North Yorkshire\n| coordinates5= {{coord|54.403|-1.737}}\n}}\nFor government and statistical purposes, Northern England is defined as the area covered by the three [[Regions of England|statistical regions]] of [[North East England]], [[North West England]] and [[Yorkshire and the Humber]].{{sfn|IPPR North|2012|pages=20\u201322}} This area consists of the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] of [[Cheshire]], [[Cumbria]], [[County Durham]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], [[Greater Manchester]], [[Lancashire]], [[Merseyside]], [[Northumberland]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[Tyne and Wear]] and [[West Yorkshire]], plus the unitary authority areas of [[North Lincolnshire]] and [[North East Lincolnshire]].

It extends from the [[Anglo-Scottish border]] in the north to near the [[River Trent]] in the south, although precise definitions of its southern extent vary. Northern England approximately comprises three [[Regions of England|statistical regions]]: the [[North East England|North East]], [[North West England|North West]] and [[Yorkshire and the Humber]]. These have a combined population of around 14.9 million as of the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]] and an area of 37,331&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (14,414 sq mi). Northern England contains much of [[National parks of England and Wales|England's national parkland]] but also has large areas of urbanisation, including the [[conurbation]]s of [[Greater Manchester Built-up Area|Greater Manchester]], [[Merseyside]], [[Teesside]], [[Tyneside]], [[Wearside]], and [[Sheffield urban area|South]] and [[West Yorkshire Built-up Area|West Yorkshire]].\n\nThe region has been controlled by many groups, from the [[Brigantes]], the largest [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] kingdom of [[Great Britain]], to the Romans, to [[Anglo-Saxons]] and Danes. After the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] in 1066, the [[Harrying of the North]] brought destruction. The area experienced [[Anglo-Scottish border]] fighting until the [[History of the formation of the United Kingdom|personal union of England and Scotland]] under the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]], with some parts changing hands between England and Scotland many times. Many of the innovations of the [[Industrial Revolution]] began in Northern England, and its cities were the crucibles of many of the political changes that accompanied this social upheaval, from [[trade unionism]] to [[Manchester Liberalism|Manchester Capitalism]]. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the economy of the North was dominated by [[heavy industry]] such as weaving, shipbuilding, steel-making and mining. The [[deindustrialisation]] that followed in the second half of the 20th century hit Northern England hard, and many towns remain deprived compared with those in [[Southern England]].\n\nUrban renewal projects and the transition to a [[service economy]] have resulted in strong economic growth in some parts of Northern England, but a definite [[North\u2013South divide (England)|North\u2013South divide]] remains both in the [[economy of England|economy]] and the [[culture of England]]. Centuries of migration, invasion and labour have shaped Northern culture, and the region retains distinctive dialects, music and cuisine.\n\n{{TOClimit|limit=2}}\n\n==Definitions==\n{{see also|Historical and alternative regions of England}}\n{{Location map many\n| UK England\n| caption = Various \"gateways\" to the North\n<!--first label/marker-->\n| label1 = Watford Gap\n| link1 = Watford Gap\n| coordinates1= {{coord|52.306|-1.124}}\n<!--second label/marker-->\n| label2 = Stoke-on-Trent\n| link2 = Stoke-on-Trent\n| coordinates2= {{coord|53|00|N|2|11|W}}\n<!--third label/marker-->\n| label3 = Crewe\n| link3 = Crewe\n| position3 = left\n| coordinates3= {{coord|53.099|-2.24}}\n<!--fourth label/marker-->\n| label4 = Sheffield\n| link4 = Sheffield\n| coordinates4= {{coord|53|23|01|N|1|28|01|W}}\n<!--fourth label/marker-->\n| label5 = Richmond\n| link5 = Richmond, North Yorkshire\n| coordinates5= {{coord|54.403|-1.737}}\n}}\nFor government and statistical purposes, Northern England is defined as the area covered by the three [[Regions of England|statistical regions]] of [[North East England]], [[North West England]] and [[Yorkshire and the Humber]].{{sfn|IPPR North|2012|pages=20\u201322}} This area consists of the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] of [[Cheshire]], [[Cumbria]], [[County Durham]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], [[Greater Manchester]], [[Lancashire]], [[Merseyside]], [[Northumberland]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[Tyne and Wear]] and [[West Yorkshire]], plus the unitary authority areas of [[North Lincolnshire]] and [[North East Lincolnshire]].
