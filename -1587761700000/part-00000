However, the company was not doing well following the purchase of struggling [[Studebaker]] Corporation in 1954. The last Teague design for Packard was the [[Packard Executive|Executive]], introduced mid-1956 and derived from the Clipper Custom, launched just as sales of the luxury Packard line collapsed. Teague also designed the last Packard show car, the Predictor, plus a new Packard and Clipper lineup for 1957 that would have followed the general lines of the Predictor. The design was stillborn when the Detroit Packard operations were shut down completely in mid-1956. Lacking funds for all-new models, the Studebaker-Packard Corporation had to make use of existing and economical Studebaker designs.

Rodman was published<ref>https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/the-great-eastern/</ref> on June 4, 2019, by [[Melville House Publishing]]. \n\nIt is a sprawling adventure set in the 1850s-1870s in New York, London, Paris, India, and the North Atlantic. The story pits two of literature's most iconic anti-heroes against each other: [[Captain Nemo]] and [[Captain Ahab]]. Caught between them is real-life British engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], builder of the century's greatest ship, {{SS|Great Eastern}}. Brunel is kidnapped by Nemo to help design a submarine with which to fight the laying of the [[transatlantic telegraph cable]], which links the two colonialist forces Nemo hates, England and the US. Brunel finds himself going up against his own ship, and the strange man hired to protect it, Captain Ahab.\n\nIn March 2019, the film rights to ''The Great Eastern'' were acquired by the UK film company Great Point Media, and Rodman was commissioned to write the screen adaptation.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Howard A.
