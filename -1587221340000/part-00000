Written by [[Bill Kelly (writer)|Bill Kelly]] and directed by [[Kevin Lima]], the film stars [[Amy Adams]], [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[James Marsden]], [[Timothy Spall]], [[Idina Menzel]], [[Rachel Covey]], and [[Susan Sarandon]]. The plot focuses on Giselle, an archetypal [[Disney Princess]], who is forced from her traditional animated world of Andalasia into the live-action world of [[New York City]]. ''Enchanted'' was the first Disney film to be distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], instead of [[Buena Vista (brand)|Buena Vista Pictures Distribution]].\n\nThe film is both an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to, and a [[self-parody]] of, [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney's animated features]], making numerous references to Disney's past works through the combination of live-action filmmaking, [[traditional animation]], and [[computer-generated imagery]]. It marks the return of traditional animation to a Disney feature film after the company's decision to move entirely to computer animation in 2004. Composer [[Alan Menken]] and lyricist [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], who had written songs for previous Disney films, wrote and produced the songs of ''Enchanted'', with Menken also composing its score.\n\nThe animated sequences were produced at [[James Baxter (animator)|James Baxter]] Animation in Pasadena. Filming of the live action segments took place around New York City. It premiered on October 20, 2007, at the [[London Film Festival]] before its [[wide release]] on November 21, 2007, in the United States. ''Enchanted'' was well-received critically, established Adams as a leading lady, and earned more than $340 million worldwide at the box office.<ref name=\"BOMojo\">{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=enchanted.htm |title=Enchanted |accessdate=December 20, 2008 |work=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> It won three [[Saturn Awards]],  including [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film|Best Fantasy Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Adams. ''Enchanted'' also received two nominations at the [[65th Golden Globe Awards]] and three [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] nominations at the [[80th Academy Awards]]. A [[sequel]], titled ''Disenchanted'', is in development.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[Animated cartoon|animated]] [[fairy tale]] kingdom of Andalasia, Narissa, queen of Andalasia and an evil [[Witchcraft|witch]], schemes to protect her claim to the throne, which she will lose once her stepson, Prince Edward, finds his [[Chivalric romance|true love]] and marries. She enlists her loyal henchman Nathaniel to keep Edward distracted by hunting trolls. Giselle, a young woman, dreams of meeting a prince and experiencing a \"[[happy ending|happily ever after]].\" She, her best [[chipmunk]] friend, Pip, and animal friends of the forest have made a homemade statue of her true love but have trouble putting lips on it. Edward hears Giselle singing and sets off to find her. Nathaniel frees a captured [[troll]] to get rid of Giselle, but Edward rescues her just in time. When they meet, they instantly fall in love and plan to be married the following day.\n\nDisguised as an old hag, Narissa intercepts Giselle on her way to the wedding and pushes her into a well, where she is magically transformed into a 3D live-action version of herself and transported to New York [[Times Square]] in the real world, a place where there are no \"happily ever afters\". Giselle, frightened and confused, quickly becomes lost. Meanwhile, Robert, a divorce lawyer, prepares to propose to his longtime girlfriend Nancy, much to the dismay of his daughter Morgan. Robert and Morgan encounter Giselle on their way home, and Robert begrudgingly allows Giselle to stay the night in their apartment at the insistence of Morgan, who believes Giselle is a princess.\n\nPip had witnessed Giselle's exile and alerted Edward thereafter, and both embark on a rescue mission to the city, where they too are turned into live-action versions. But Pip is instead in the form of a real chipmunk \u2013 therefore losing the ability to speak. Narissa sends Nathaniel to follow and impede Edward. In a restaurant, Narissa appears to Nathaniel in a soup pot and gives him three poisoned apples (that will put whoever eats one to sleep until the clock strikes twelve, which will kill them) to murder Giselle. Pip eavesdrops but is unable to communicate with Edward, as he cannot speak and Edward is clueless. Nathaniel keeps Pip silenced by detaining him in various containers. Meanwhile, after Giselle summons [[vermin]] to clean Robert's apartment, Nancy arrives to take Morgan to school. She meets Giselle and leaves assuming Robert was unfaithful. Robert is initially upset but spends the day with Giselle, knowing she is vulnerable in the city. Giselle questions Robert about his relationship with Nancy and helps the pair reconcile by sending Nancy flowers and an invitation to the \"[[Costume party|King and Queen's Costume Ball]]\" at the [[Woolworth Building]].\n\nEdward locates Giselle at Robert's apartment. While Edward is eager to take Giselle home to Andalasia and finally marry, she suggests that they should first go on a date and get to know each other better, still conflicted about her feelings. Giselle promises to return to Andalasia after ending their date at the ball, which Robert and Nancy also attend. Narissa, who has been spying from Andalasia, decides to follow and kill Giselle herself after Nathaniel fails twice to poison her. Robert and Giselle share a dance with each other and look into each other's eyes romantically. Giselle and Edward then prepare to leave, but Giselle feels sorrow at leaving Robert behind. Narissa appears as the old hag and offers the last poisoned apple to Giselle, promising \"sweet dreams and happy endings.\" Giselle takes a bite and is plunged into a deep sleep with mere minutes to live.\n\nNarissa attempts to escape with Giselle's body but is stopped by Edward. Nathaniel, realising Narissa was using him and never loved him, reveals her plot. Robert realises that true love's kiss is the only force powerful enough to break the apple's spell. Edward's kiss fails to wake Giselle, and Edward and Nancy prompt Robert to kiss her instead. When Robert kisses her just as the clock strikes twelve, Giselle awakens and the whole crowd cheers. Narissa furiously transforms into a giant blue [[dragon]] and takes Robert hostage. Giselle takes Edward's sword and pursues Narissa to the top of the building. Pip, who was freed by Edward, helps Giselle send Narissa falling to her death.\n\nA happy new life unfolds for everyone, showing Edward and Nancy falling in love and marrying in Andalasia; Giselle running a successful \"Andalasian fashion\" business; while Nathaniel and Pip (who returns to Andalasia) each become successful authors about their experiences in the real world and find girlfriends. Giselle, still in the real world, married Robert and forms a happy family with him and Morgan.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Andalasia===\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Giselle <br> A princess-to-be who ends up almost having her dream of meeting her prince a reality.

After the actors were hired, he was involved in making the final design of the movie, which made sure the animated characters look like their real-life counterparts.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n''Enchanted'' is the first feature-length Disney live-action/traditional animation hybrid since Disney's ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' in 1988, though the traditionally animated characters do not interact in the live-action environment in the same method as they did in ''Roger Rabbit''; however, there are some scenes where live-action characters share the screen with two-dimensional animated characters, for example, a live-action Nathaniel communicating with a cel-drawn Narissa, who is in a cooking pot. The film uses two [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]s; it begins in 2.35:1 when the [[Walt Disney Pictures]] logo and ''Enchanted'' storybook are shown, and then switches to a smaller 1.85:1 aspect ratio for the first animated sequence. The film switches back to 2.35:1 when it becomes live-action and never switches back, even for the remainder of the animated sequences. When this movie was aired on televised networks, the beginning of the movie (minus the logo and opening credits) was shown in the [[pillarbox]]ed 4:3 aspect ratio; the remainder of the movie was shown in the 16:9 aspect ratio when it becomes live-action. Lima oversaw the direction of both the live-action and animation sequences, which were being produced at the same time.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/> ''Enchanted'' took almost two years to complete. The animation took about a year to finish while the live-action scenes, which commenced filming on location in New York City during the summer of 2006 and were completed during the animation process, were shot in 72 days.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/>\n\n====Animation====\nOut of the film's 107 minutes of running time, ten of the approximately 13 minutes of animation are at the beginning of the film. Lima tried to \"cram every single piece of Disney iconic imagery\" that he could into the first ten minutes, which were done in [[Traditional animation|traditional cel animation]] (in contrast to computer-generated [[3-D animation]]) as a tribute to past Disney fairy tale films such as ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', and ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/> It was the first Disney film theatrically released in America to feature traditional cel animation since ''[[Pooh's Heffalump Movie]]'' (2005).

The first song played in the film, \"True Love's Kiss\", was written to be \"a send-up of, and an homage to, the style of those Disney animated features\", namely, \"I'm Wishing\" (''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'') and \"[[A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes]]\" (''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''), during which Disney heroines sing about the joy of being loved.<ref name=\"Playbill-2007nov18\">{{Cite news|first=Michael |last=Buckley |title=Menken & Schwartz Are \"Enchanted\"; Plus Bosco, Chenoweth, \"Hairspray\" |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/113379.html |work=Playbill |date=November 18, 2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108225856/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/113379.html |archivedate=January 8, 2008 }}</ref> It posed a challenge for Menken and [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Schwartz]] because of the \"many preconceptions with that number\"; it had to be reflective of the era of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' and ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''.<ref name=\"MO-music\"/> Accordingly, Amy Adams performed the first song in an operetta style in contrast to the Broadway style of the later songs.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Sheila |last=Roberts |title=Amy Adams Interview, Enchanted |url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13467.html |work=MoviesOnline |accessdate=2015-02-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230212716/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13467.html |archivedate=December 30, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nBoth \"[[Happy Working Song]]\" and \"[[That's How You Know (musical number)|That's How You Know]]\" also pay tributes to past Disney songs. \"Happy Working Song\" pays a lyrical homage to such songs as \"[[Whistle While You Work]]\" (''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''), \"The Work Song\" (''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''), \"[[A Spoonful of Sugar]]\" (''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'') and \"Making Christmas\" (''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''), and a musical homage to the [[Sherman Brothers]] (with a self-parodic \"Alan Menken style\" middle eight). \"That's How You Know\" is a self-parody of Menken's compositions for his Disney features, specifically such big production numbers as \"[[Under the Sea]]\" (''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'') and \"[[Be Our Guest]]\" (''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'').<ref name=\"Playbill-2007nov18\"/> To achieve this, [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Schwartz]] admitted he had to \"push it a little bit further in terms of choices of words or certain lyrics\" while maintaining \"the classic Walt Disney sensibility\".<ref name=\"MO-music\"/> However, Menken noted that the songs he has written for Disney have always been \"a little tongue-in-cheek\".<ref name=\"MO-music\"/> As the film progresses, the music uses more contemporary styles, which is heard through the adult ballad \"[[So Close (Jon McLaughlin song)|So Close]]\" and the country/pop number \"Ever Ever After\" (sung by [[Carrie Underwood]] as a voice-over).<ref name=\"Playbill-2007nov18\"/>\n\nOut of the six completed songs written and composed by Menken and Schwartz, five remained in the finished film.

These shots involved virtual sets, environmental effects and [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] characters that performed alongside real actors, namely the animated animals during the \"Happy Working Song\" sequence, Pip and the Narissa dragon during the live-action portions of the film. CIS Hollywood was responsible for 36 visual effects shots, which primarily dealt with [[wire removal]]s and composites.

The real animals captured on film aided Tippett Studio in creating CG rats and pigeons, which gave dynamic performances such as having pigeons that carried brooms in their beaks and rats that scrubbed with toothbrushes.

This meant the animators had to display Pip's emotions through performance as well as making him appear like a real chipmunk. The team at Tippett began the process of animating Pip by observing live chipmunks which were filmed in motion from \"every conceivable angle\", after which they created a photorealistic chipmunk through the use of 3D computer graphics software, [[Maya (software)|Maya]] and Furrocious.<ref name=\"VFXWorld-2007nov21\"/> When visual effects supervisor Thomas Schelesny showed the first animation of Pip to director Kevin Lima, he was surprised that he was a looking at a CG character and not reference footage.<ref name=\"LAT-2007dec02\">{{Cite news|first=Ron |last=Magid |title=A new wrinkle in the face of evil |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/02/entertainment/ca-enchanted2 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 2, 2007 |access-date=December 20, 2008}}</ref> To enhance facial expressions, the modelers gave Pip eyebrows, which real chipmunks do not have.<ref name=\"TCGSociety-2007dec4\"/> During the filming of scenes in which Pip appears, a number of ways were used to indicate the physical presence of Pip. On some occasions, a small stuffed chipmunk with a wire armature on the inside was placed in the scene. In other situations, a rod with a small marker on the end or a laser pointer would be used to show the actors and cinematographer where Pip is.<ref name=\"VFXWorld-2007nov21\"/>\n\nUnlike Pip, the Narissa dragon was allowed to be more of a fantasy character while still looking like a living character and a classic Disney villain.<ref name=\"VFXWorld-2007nov21\"/><ref name=\"LAT-2007dec02\"/> The CG dragon design was loosely based on a traditional Chinese dragon and Susan Sarandon's live-action witch.<ref name=\"LAT-2007dec02\"/> When filming the scene which sees the transformation of Narissa from a woman into a dragon, a long pole was used to direct the extras' eyelines instead of a laser pointer. Set pieces were made to move back and forth in addition to having a computer-controlled lighting setup and a repeatable head on the camera that were all synchronized. In the film's final sequence, in which Narissa climbs the [[Woolworth Building]] while clutching Robert in her claws, a [[greenscreen]] rig was built to hold Patrick Dempsey in order to film his face and movements.

Written by [[Bill Kelly (writer)|Bill Kelly]] and directed by [[Kevin Lima]], the film stars [[Amy Adams]], [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[James Marsden]], [[Timothy Spall]], [[Idina Menzel]], [[Rachel Covey]], and [[Susan Sarandon]]. The plot focuses on Giselle, an archetypal [[Disney Princess]], who is forced from her traditional animated world of Andalasia into the live-action world of [[New York City]]. ''Enchanted'' was the first Disney film to be distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], instead of [[Buena Vista (brand)|Buena Vista Pictures Distribution]].\n\nThe film is both an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to, and a [[self-parody]] of, [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney's animated features]], making numerous references to Disney's past works through the combination of live-action filmmaking, [[traditional animation]], and [[computer-generated imagery]]. It marks the return of traditional animation to a Disney feature film after the company's decision to move entirely to computer animation in 2004. Composer [[Alan Menken]] and lyricist [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], who had written songs for previous Disney films, wrote and produced the songs of ''Enchanted'', with Menken also composing its score.\n\nThe animated sequences were produced at [[James Baxter (animator)|James Baxter]] Animation in Pasadena. Filming of the live action segments took place around New York City. It premiered on October 20, 2007, at the [[London Film Festival]] before its [[wide release]] on November 21, 2007, in the United States. ''Enchanted'' was well-received critically, established Adams as a leading lady, and earned more than $340 million worldwide at the box office.<ref name=\"BOMojo\">{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=enchanted.htm |title=Enchanted |accessdate=December 20, 2008 |work=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> It won three [[Saturn Awards]],  including [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film|Best Fantasy Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Adams. ''Enchanted'' also received two nominations at the [[65th Golden Globe Awards]] and three [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] nominations at the [[80th Academy Awards]]. A [[sequel]], titled ''Disenchanted'', is in development.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[Animated cartoon|animated]] [[fairy tale]] kingdom of Andalasia, Narissa, queen of Andalasia and an evil [[Witchcraft|witch]], schemes to protect her claim to the throne, which she will lose once her stepson, Prince Edward, finds his [[Chivalric romance|true love]] and marries. She enlists her loyal henchman Nathaniel to keep Edward distracted by hunting trolls. Giselle, a young woman, dreams of meeting a prince and experiencing a \"[[happy ending|happily ever after]].\" She, her best [[chipmunk]] friend, Pip, and animal friends of the forest have made a homemade statue of her true love but have trouble putting lips on it. Edward hears Giselle singing and sets off to find her. Nathaniel frees a captured [[troll]] to get rid of Giselle, but Edward rescues her just in time. When they meet, they instantly fall in love and plan to be married the following day.\n\nDisguised as an old hag, Narissa intercepts Giselle on her way to the wedding and pushes her into a well, where she is magically transformed into a 3D live-action version of herself and transported to New York [[Times Square]] in the real world, a place where there are no \"happily ever afters\". Giselle, frightened and confused, quickly becomes lost. Meanwhile, Robert, a divorce lawyer, prepares to propose to his longtime girlfriend Nancy, much to the dismay of his daughter Morgan. Robert and Morgan encounter Giselle on their way home, and Robert begrudgingly allows Giselle to stay the night in their apartment at the insistence of Morgan, who believes Giselle is a princess.\n\nPip had witnessed Giselle's exile and alerted Edward thereafter, and both embark on a rescue mission to the city, where they too are turned into live-action versions. But Pip is instead in the form of a real chipmunk \u2013 therefore losing the ability to speak. Narissa sends Nathaniel to follow and impede Edward. In a restaurant, Narissa appears to Nathaniel in a soup pot and gives him three poisoned apples (that will put whoever eats one to sleep until the clock strikes twelve, which will kill them) to murder Giselle. Pip eavesdrops but is unable to communicate with Edward, as he cannot speak and Edward is clueless. Nathaniel keeps Pip silenced by detaining him in various containers. Meanwhile, after Giselle summons [[vermin]] to clean Robert's apartment, Nancy arrives to take Morgan to school. She meets Giselle and leaves assuming Robert was unfaithful. Robert is initially upset but spends the day with Giselle, knowing she is vulnerable in the city. Giselle questions Robert about his relationship with Nancy and helps the pair reconcile by sending Nancy flowers and an invitation to the \"[[Costume party|King and Queen's Costume Ball]]\" at the [[Woolworth Building]].\n\nEdward locates Giselle at Robert's apartment. While Edward is eager to take Giselle home to Andalasia and finally marry, she suggests that they should first go on a date and get to know each other better, still conflicted about her feelings. Giselle promises to return to Andalasia after ending their date at the ball, which Robert and Nancy also attend. Narissa, who has been spying from Andalasia, decides to follow and kill Giselle herself after Nathaniel fails twice to poison her. Robert and Giselle share a dance with each other and look into each other's eyes romantically. Giselle and Edward then prepare to leave, but Giselle feels sorrow at leaving Robert behind. Narissa appears as the old hag and offers the last poisoned apple to Giselle, promising \"sweet dreams and happy endings.\" Giselle takes a bite and is plunged into a deep sleep with mere minutes to live.\n\nNarissa attempts to escape with Giselle's body but is stopped by Edward. Nathaniel, realising Narissa was using him and never loved him, reveals her plot. Robert realises that true love's kiss is the only force powerful enough to break the apple's spell. Edward's kiss fails to wake Giselle, and Edward and Nancy prompt Robert to kiss her instead. When Robert kisses her just as the clock strikes twelve, Giselle awakens and the whole crowd cheers. Narissa furiously transforms into a giant blue [[dragon]] and takes Robert hostage. Giselle takes Edward's sword and pursues Narissa to the top of the building. Pip, who was freed by Edward, helps Giselle send Narissa falling to her death.\n\nA happy new life unfolds for everyone, showing Edward and Nancy falling in love and marrying in Andalasia; Giselle running a successful \"Andalasian fashion\" business; while Nathaniel and Pip (who returns to Andalasia) each become successful authors about their experiences in the real world and find girlfriends.

After the actors were hired, he was involved in making the final design of the movie, which made sure the animated characters look like their real-life counterparts.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n''Enchanted'' is the first feature-length Disney live-action/traditional animation hybrid since Disney's ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' in 1988, though the traditionally animated characters do not interact in the live-action environment in the same method as they did in ''Roger Rabbit''; however, there are some scenes where live-action characters share the screen with two-dimensional animated characters, for example, a live-action Nathaniel communicating with a cel-drawn Narissa, who is in a cooking pot. The film uses two [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]s; it begins in 2.35:1 when the [[Walt Disney Pictures]] logo and ''Enchanted'' storybook are shown, and then switches to a smaller 1.85:1 aspect ratio for the first animated sequence. The film switches back to 2.35:1 when it becomes live-action and never switches back, even for the remainder of the animated sequences. When this movie was aired on televised networks, the beginning of the movie (minus the logo and opening credits) was shown in the [[pillarbox]]ed 4:3 aspect ratio; the remainder of the movie was shown in the 16:9 aspect ratio when it becomes live-action. Lima oversaw the direction of both the live-action and animation sequences, which were being produced at the same time.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/> ''Enchanted'' took almost two years to complete. The animation took about a year to finish while the live-action scenes, which commenced filming on location in New York City during the summer of 2006 and were completed during the animation process, were shot in 72 days.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/>\n\n====Animation====\nOut of the film's 107 minutes of running time, ten of the approximately 13 minutes of animation are at the beginning of the film. Lima tried to \"cram every single piece of Disney iconic imagery\" that he could into the first ten minutes, which were done in [[Traditional animation|traditional cel animation]] (in contrast to computer-generated [[3-D animation]]) as a tribute to past Disney fairy tale films such as ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', and ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/> It was the first Disney film theatrically released in America to feature traditional cel animation since ''[[Pooh's Heffalump Movie]]'' (2005).

The first song played in the film, \"True Love's Kiss\", was written to be \"a send-up of, and an homage to, the style of those Disney animated features\", namely, \"I'm Wishing\" (''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'') and \"[[A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes]]\" (''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''), during which Disney heroines sing about the joy of being loved.<ref name=\"Playbill-2007nov18\">{{Cite news|first=Michael |last=Buckley |title=Menken & Schwartz Are \"Enchanted\"; Plus Bosco, Chenoweth, \"Hairspray\" |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/113379.html |work=Playbill |date=November 18, 2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108225856/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/113379.html |archivedate=January 8, 2008 }}</ref> It posed a challenge for Menken and [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Schwartz]] because of the \"many preconceptions with that number\"; it had to be reflective of the era of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' and ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''.<ref name=\"MO-music\"/> Accordingly, Amy Adams performed the first song in an operetta style in contrast to the Broadway style of the later songs.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Sheila |last=Roberts |title=Amy Adams Interview, Enchanted |url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13467.html |work=MoviesOnline |accessdate=2015-02-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230212716/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13467.html |archivedate=December 30, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nBoth \"[[Happy Working Song]]\" and \"[[That's How You Know (musical number)|That's How You Know]]\" also pay tributes to past Disney songs. \"Happy Working Song\" pays a lyrical homage to such songs as \"[[Whistle While You Work]]\" (''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''), \"The Work Song\" (''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''), \"[[A Spoonful of Sugar]]\" (''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'') and \"Making Christmas\" (''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''), and a musical homage to the [[Sherman Brothers]] (with a self-parodic \"Alan Menken style\" middle eight). \"That's How You Know\" is a self-parody of Menken's compositions for his Disney features, specifically such big production numbers as \"[[Under the Sea]]\" (''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'') and \"[[Be Our Guest]]\" (''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'').<ref name=\"Playbill-2007nov18\"/> To achieve this, [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Schwartz]] admitted he had to \"push it a little bit further in terms of choices of words or certain lyrics\" while maintaining \"the classic Walt Disney sensibility\".<ref name=\"MO-music\"/> However, Menken noted that the songs he has written for Disney have always been \"a little tongue-in-cheek\".<ref name=\"MO-music\"/> As the film progresses, the music uses more contemporary styles, which is heard through the adult ballad \"[[So Close (Jon McLaughlin song)|So Close]]\" and the country/pop number \"Ever Ever After\" (sung by [[Carrie Underwood]] as a voice-over).<ref name=\"Playbill-2007nov18\"/>\n\nOut of the six completed songs written and composed by Menken and Schwartz, five remained in the finished film.

These shots involved virtual sets, environmental effects and [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] characters that performed alongside real actors, namely the animated animals during the \"Happy Working Song\" sequence, Pip and the Narissa dragon during the live-action portions of the film. CIS Hollywood was responsible for 36 visual effects shots, which primarily dealt with [[wire removal]]s and composites. [[Reel FX Creative Studios]] did four visual effects shots involving the pop-up book page-turn transitions while [[Weta Digital]] did two.<ref name=\"VFXWorld-2007nov21\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&code=319b255d&atype=articles&id=3458&page=1 |title=Enchanted: Conjuring Fairytale VFX |accessdate=January 3, 2008 |last=Wolff |first=Ellen |date=November 21, 2007 |work=VFXWorld}}</ref>\n\nOut of all the animals that appear in the \"[[Happy Working Song]]\" sequence, the only real animals filmed on set were rats and pigeons. The real animals captured on film aided Tippett Studio in creating CG rats and pigeons, which gave dynamic performances such as having pigeons that carried brooms in their beaks and rats that scrubbed with toothbrushes. On the other hand, all the cockroaches were CG characters.<ref name=\"TCGSociety-2007dec4\">{{cite web|url=http://features.cgsociety.org/story_custom.php?story_id=4351 |title=Sweet Enchanted Satire |access-date=January 3, 2008 |last=Robertson |first=Barbara |date=December 4, 2007 |work=The Computer Graphics Society}}</ref>\n\nPip, a chipmunk who can talk in the 2D world of Andalasia, loses his ability to communicate through speech in the real world so he must rely heavily on facial and body gestures. This meant the animators had to display Pip's emotions through performance as well as making him appear like a real chipmunk. The team at Tippett began the process of animating Pip by observing live chipmunks which were filmed in motion from \"every conceivable angle\", after which they created a photorealistic chipmunk through the use of 3D computer graphics software, [[Maya (software)|Maya]] and Furrocious.<ref name=\"VFXWorld-2007nov21\"/> When visual effects supervisor Thomas Schelesny showed the first animation of Pip to director Kevin Lima, he was surprised that he was a looking at a CG character and not reference footage.<ref name=\"LAT-2007dec02\">{{Cite news|first=Ron |last=Magid |title=A new wrinkle in the face of evil |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/02/entertainment/ca-enchanted2 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 2, 2007 |access-date=December 20, 2008}}</ref> To enhance facial expressions, the modelers gave Pip eyebrows, which real chipmunks do not have.<ref name=\"TCGSociety-2007dec4\"/> During the filming of scenes in which Pip appears, a number of ways were used to indicate the physical presence of Pip. On some occasions, a small stuffed chipmunk with a wire armature on the inside was placed in the scene. In other situations, a rod with a small marker on the end or a laser pointer would be used to show the actors and cinematographer where Pip is.<ref name=\"VFXWorld-2007nov21\"/>\n\nUnlike Pip, the Narissa dragon was allowed to be more of a fantasy character while still looking like a living character and a classic Disney villain.<ref name=\"VFXWorld-2007nov21\"/><ref name=\"LAT-2007dec02\"/> The CG dragon design was loosely based on a traditional Chinese dragon and Susan Sarandon's live-action witch.<ref name=\"LAT-2007dec02\"/> When filming the scene which sees the transformation of Narissa from a woman into a dragon, a long pole was used to direct the extras' eyelines instead of a laser pointer. Set pieces were made to move back and forth in addition to having a computer-controlled lighting setup and a repeatable head on the camera that were all synchronized. In the film's final sequence, in which Narissa climbs the [[Woolworth Building]] while clutching Robert in her claws, a [[greenscreen]] rig was built to hold Patrick Dempsey in order to film his face and movements.

He has sold 20 million records worldwide.  \n[[AllMusic]] considers him to be \"among the most important [[electronic dance music|dance music]] figures of the early 1990s, helping bring dance music to a mainstream audience both in the United Kingdom and the United States\".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.allmusic.com/artist/p13697 | title = Moby |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |work=Allmusic |accessdate=September 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter taking up guitar and piano at age nine, he played in several underground punk rock bands through the 1980s before turning to electronic dance music. In 1989, he moved to New York City and became a prolific figure as a DJ, producer, and remixer. His 1991 single \"[[Go (Moby song)|Go]]\" was his mainstream breakthrough, reaching No. 10 in the United Kingdom. Between 1992 and 1997 he scored eight top 10 hits on the [[Dance Club Songs|''Billboard'' Dance Club Songs]] chart including \"[[Move (Moby song)|Move (You Make Me Feel So Good)]]\", \"[[Feeling So Real]]\", and \"[[James Bond Theme#Moby re-version|James Bond Theme (Moby Re-Version)]]\". Through the decade he also produced music under various pseudonyms, released the critically acclaimed ''[[Everything Is Wrong (album)|Everything Is Wrong]]'' (1995), and composed music for films. His punk-oriented album ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'' (1996) alienated much of his fan base.\n\nMoby found commercial and critical success with his fifth album ''[[Play (Moby album)|Play]]'' (1999) which, after receiving little recognition, became an unexpected global hit in 2000 after each track was licensed to films, television shows, and commercials. It remains his highest selling album with 12 million copies sold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12054910|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213050246/http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12054910|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 13, 2006|title=Moby Didn't Feel Pressure To Follow Up 'Play,' '18' Bows At Number Four|date=December 13, 2006|access-date=November 12, 2018}}</ref> Its seventh single, \"[[South Side (song)|South Side]]\", featuring [[Gwen Stefani]], remains his only one to appear on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], reaching No. 14. Moby followed ''Play'' with albums of varied styles including electronic, dance, rock, and [[downtempo]] music, starting with ''[[18 (Moby album)|18]]'' (2002), ''[[Hotel (album)|Hotel]]'' (2005), and ''[[Last Night (Moby album)|Last Night]]'' (2008). His later albums saw him explore [[ambient music]], including the almost four-hour release ''[[Long Ambients 1: Calm. Sleep.]]'' (2016). Moby has not toured since 2014 but continues to record and release albums; his most recent is ''[[Long Ambients 2]]'' (2019). Moby has co-written, produced, or remixed music for various artists.\n\nIn addition to his music career, Moby is known for his [[veganism]] and support for animal welfare and humanitarian aid except towards those employed under him during times of crisis. He is the owner of [[Little Pine (restaurant)|Little Pine]], a vegan restaurant in Los Angeles, and organized the vegan music and food festival Circle V. He is the author of four books, including a collection of his photography and two memoirs: ''[[Porcelain: A Memoir]]'' (2016) and ''[[Then It Fell Apart]]'' (2019).\n\n== Early life ==\nRichard Melville Hall was born September 11, 1965, in the neighborhood of [[Harlem]] in Manhattan, New York City.

He has sold 20 million records worldwide.  \n[[AllMusic]] considers him to be \"among the most important [[electronic dance music|dance music]] figures of the early 1990s, helping bring dance music to a mainstream audience both in the United Kingdom and the United States\".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.allmusic.com/artist/p13697 | title = Moby |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |work=Allmusic |accessdate=September 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter taking up guitar and piano at age nine, he played in several underground punk rock bands through the 1980s before turning to electronic dance music. In 1989, he moved to New York City and became a prolific figure as a DJ, producer, and remixer. His 1991 single \"[[Go (Moby song)|Go]]\" was his mainstream breakthrough, reaching No. 10 in the United Kingdom. Between 1992 and 1997 he scored eight top 10 hits on the [[Dance Club Songs|''Billboard'' Dance Club Songs]] chart including \"[[Move (Moby song)|Move (You Make Me Feel So Good)]]\", \"[[Feeling So Real]]\", and \"[[James Bond Theme#Moby re-version|James Bond Theme (Moby Re-Version)]]\". Through the decade he also produced music under various pseudonyms, released the critically acclaimed ''[[Everything Is Wrong (album)|Everything Is Wrong]]'' (1995), and composed music for films. His punk-oriented album ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'' (1996) alienated much of his fan base.\n\nMoby found commercial and critical success with his fifth album ''[[Play (Moby album)|Play]]'' (1999) which, after receiving little recognition, became an unexpected global hit in 2000 after each track was licensed to films, television shows, and commercials. It remains his highest selling album with 12 million copies sold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12054910|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213050246/http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12054910|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 13, 2006|title=Moby Didn't Feel Pressure To Follow Up 'Play,' '18' Bows At Number Four|date=December 13, 2006|access-date=November 12, 2018}}</ref> Its seventh single, \"[[South Side (song)|South Side]]\", featuring [[Gwen Stefani]], remains his only one to appear on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], reaching No. 14. Moby followed ''Play'' with albums of varied styles including electronic, dance, rock, and [[downtempo]] music, starting with ''[[18 (Moby album)|18]]'' (2002), ''[[Hotel (album)|Hotel]]'' (2005), and ''[[Last Night (Moby album)|Last Night]]'' (2008). His later albums saw him explore [[ambient music]], including the almost four-hour release ''[[Long Ambients 1: Calm. Sleep.]]'' (2016). Moby has not toured since 2014 but continues to record and release albums; his most recent is ''[[Long Ambients 2]]'' (2019). Moby has co-written, produced, or remixed music for various artists.\n\nIn addition to his music career, Moby is known for his [[veganism]] and support for animal welfare and humanitarian aid. He is the owner of [[Little Pine (restaurant)|Little Pine]], a vegan restaurant in Los Angeles, and organized the vegan music and food festival Circle V. He is the author of four books, including a collection of his photography and two memoirs: ''[[Porcelain: A Memoir]]'' (2016) and ''[[Then It Fell Apart]]'' (2019).\n\n== Early life ==\nRichard Melville Hall was born September 11, 1965, in the neighborhood of [[Harlem]] in Manhattan, New York City. He is the only child of Elizabeth McBride (''n\u00e9e'' Warner), a medical secretary, and James Frederick Hall, a chemistry professor, who died in a car crash while drunk when Moby was two.<ref name=TI05>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/moby-i-am-a-messy-human-being-and-i-dont-have-a-problem-admitting-it-4325.html|title=Moby: 'I am a messy human being, and I don't have a problem admitting|date=March 5, 2005|work=The Independent|first=Nick|last=Duerden|accessdate=April 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=TG14/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cujamison.home.comcast.net/~cujamison/genhtm/genfrance.htm |title=Genealogy of Claire and Alex Jamison |publisher=Cujamison.home.comcast.net |accessdate=April 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005015831/http://cujamison.home.comcast.net/~cujamison/genhtm/genfrance.htm |archivedate=October 5, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=TG160521>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/21/moby-bags-drugs-having-sex-stranger-miranda-sawyer|title=Moby: 'There were bags of drugs, I was having sex with a stranger'|date=May 21, 2016|work=The Guardian|accessdate=November 25, 2018|first=Miranda|last=Sawyer}}</ref> His father gave him the nickname Moby three days after his birth as his parents considered the name Richard too large for a newborn baby.

Released in March 1991, it peaked at No. 10 in the UK in October and earned him national exposure there with an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\" /> Instinct capitalised on Moby's success with the late 1991 compilation ''[[Instinct Dance]]'' featuring tracks by Moby and his pseudonyms. The following year, Moby revealed that \"Go\" had earned him just $2,000 in royalties.<ref name=CT92/>\n\nThe success of \"Go\" led to increased demand for Moby to produce more music and to remix other artists' songs. He often arranged for the artist and himself to trade remixes as opposed to being paid for his work, which was the case for his mixes for [[Billy Corgan]] and [[Soundgarden]].<ref name=SPIN97/> The increased mainstream exposure led Moby to request a release from his contract with Instinct for a bigger label. Instinct refused, so Moby retaliated by holding out on new material. However, Instinct continued to put out records, mostly from demos, without his consent having previously copied many of his tapes and had the master rights.<ref name=THC95/><ref name=BS16/> This was the case for Moby's debut album, ''[[Moby (album)|Moby]]'', released in July 1992 and formed mostly of previously unreleased demos that Moby considered old and unrepresentative of the musical direction he had taken since.

His daughters were also painters in their own right and worked with their husbands on commissons.<ref name=ivan>[http://www.artivisive.sns.it/galleria/libro.php?volume=CXVIII&pagina=CXVIII_708_242.jpg Nicola Ivanoff, ''Daniele van den Dyck''], in: Emporium, CXVIII(1953), pp. 244-250 {{in lang|it}}</ref>  Regnier's only son, Giovanni Paolo, was baptised on 27 October 1639.<ref name=rkd/>  R\u00e9gnier's half-brother was [[Michele Desubleo]], an artist working in a very similar style and whose work is often wrongly attributed to R\u00e9gnier and vice versa.<ref name=tribune/>\n \nHe died in Venice.\n\n==Work==\nHis subjects include genre scenes with card players, fortune tellers, concerts, soldiers and carnival scenes, portraits, religious scenes, saints and mythological and allegorical subjects.  Together with the French painter [[Valentin de Boulogne]], R\u00e9gnier is regarded as a follower of the Manfrediana Methodus, which refers to those artists who interpreted Caravaggio through the prism of Bartolomeo Manfredi's processing of the lessons of Caravaggio. Some of his works are so close to those of Manfredi that they have been wrongly attributed to Manfredi.<ref name=mat/>\n[[File:R\u00e9gnier Carnival Scene 01.jpg|thumb|290px|''Carnival Scene'']]\nR\u00e9gnier's style is characterised by its pursuit of refinement and elegance, in contrast with the Northern Caravaggisti such as [[Gerard van Honthorst]] and [[Dirck van Baburen]], whose art dwells on the more earthy aspects of genre scenes. After his move to Venice, his style became even more smooth under the influence of the Bolognese painters, such as [[Guido Reni]].<ref name=tribune/>\n\nHe painted [[Saint Sebastian Tended by Saint Irene]] three times, as well as a number of nearly-nude single figures of [[Saint Sebastian]] and [[John the Baptist]].  He painted [[Mary Magdalene]] numerous times.\n\n==Selected works==\n*''Allegory of Vanity - Pandora'' (1626), private collection\n*''Cardsharps and Fortune Teller'' (1620-1622), [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] - Budapest\n*''Carnival scene'' (1630), [[National Museum, Warsaw]]\n*''The Death of Sophonisba'' (1665-1667), [[New Walk Museum|New Walk Museum and Art Gallery]], Leicester\n*''Guessing Game'' (1620-1625), [[Uffizi|Galleria Uffizi]] - Florence\n*''The Fortune Teller'', Nicolas R\u00e9gnier (1625-1626), [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]]\n*''Marquis Vincenzo Giustiniani'' (1630)\n[[File:His Renie.jpg|thumb|275px|''Fortune teller'']]\n*''A Musician Playing a Lute to a Singing Girl'' (1621-1622), private collection\n*''The Penitent Magdalen'' (1650-1660), [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]]\n*''Penitent Mary Magdalene'', private collection\n*''Portrait of Maria Farnese'' (1638)\n*''Saint John the Baptist'' (1615-1620), [[Hermitage Museum]] - St. Petersburg\n*''Saint Sebastian'' (1620), Hermitage Museum - St. Petersburg\n*''Saint Sebastian'' (1622-1625), [[Gemaldegalerie Alte Meister]] - Dresden\n*''Saint Sebastian Tended by Saint Irene'', [[Ferens Art Gallery]] - Hull\n*''Self-Portrait with a Portrait on an Easel'' (1623-1624), [[Fogg Museum of Art]] - University of Harvard\n*''Sleeper Awakened by a Young Woman with a Lit Wick'' (also known as Fortune Telling Scene), [[Nationalmuseum|National Museum of Fine Arts]] - Stockholm\n*''Vanity'' (1626), [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon]]\n*''Allegory of Vanity-Pandora'', [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]].<ref>[http://www.staatsgalerie.de/malereiundplastik_e/ita_rundg.php?id=7 Vanity-Pandora] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130173955/http://staatsgalerie.de/malereiundplastik_e/ita_rundg.php?id=7 |date=30 November 2010 }} by Niccol\u00f2 Renieri in the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart.</ref>\n*''Baptism of Christ'', 1627, Church of San Giovanni Battista dei Genovesi, Rome\n*''David with the head of Goliath'', 1616, Palazzo Spada, Galleria Spada, Sala IV, Inventory n\u00b0 176, Roma (Attribution has been discussed, some critics considering it may be a Bartolomeo Manfredi work)\n[[File:Nicolas R\u00e9gnier - Sleeper awakwened by a young woman with fire.jpg|thumb|288px|''Sleeping man awakened by a young woman with fire'']]\n*''Judith holding the head of Holofernes''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.museodelprado.es/coleccion/obra-de-arte/judit-con-la-cabeza-de-holofernes/c9a2e914-cbce-4c06-9924-9dd4d87875ea|title=Judit con la cabeza de Holofernes - Colecci\u00f3n - Museo Nacional del Prado|website=www.museodelprado.es|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>, [[Museo del Prado|Prado Museum]], Madrid.\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Lemoine, Annick, [https://openlibrary.org/b/OL21527411M/Nicolas_R\u00e9gnier_(alias_Niccol\u00f2_Renieri)_ca._1588-1667 ''Nicolas R\u00e9gnier (alias Niccol\u00f2 Renieri) ca. 1588-1667 peintre, collectionneur et marchand d'art''], 2007, Arthena (Paris). {{ISBN|978-2-903239-37-4}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons-inline|Category:Nicolas R\u00e9gnier|Nicolas R\u00e9gnier}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}\n\n{{Caravaggisti}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Regnier}}\n[[Category:1591 births]]\n[[Category:1667 deaths]]\n[[Category:17th-century Italian painters]]\n[[Category:Italian male painters]]\n[[Category:Flemish Baroque painters]]\n[[Category:Venetian painters]]\n[[Category:Italian art collectors]]\n[[Category:Italian art dealers]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMazarin(link changed toCardinal Mazarin) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_R%C3%A9gnier"}
