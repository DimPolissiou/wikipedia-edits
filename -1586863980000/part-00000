Quadcopters are classified as [[rotorcraft]], as opposed to [[fixed-wing aircraft]], because their [[Lift (force)|lift]] is generated by a set of [[helicopter rotor|rotors]] (vertically oriented [[propeller]]s).\n\nQuadcopters generally use two pairs of identical fixed pitch propellers; two [[clockwise]] (CW) and two [[counterclockwise]] (CCW). These use independent variation of the speed of each rotor to achieve control. By changing the speed of each rotor it is possible to specifically generate a desired total [[thrust]]; to locate for the [[centre of thrust]] both laterally and longitudinally; and to create a desired total [[torque]], or turning force.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stafford |first=Jesse|url=http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/webproj/212_spring_2014/Clay_Allen/clay_allen/works.html |title=How a Quadcopter works &#124; Clay Allen  |publisher=University of Alaska, Fairbanks |date=Spring 2014 |accessdate=2015-01-20}}</ref>\n\nQuadcopters differ from conventional helicopters, which use rotors that are able to vary the pitch of their blades dynamically as they move around the rotor hub. In the early days of flight, quadcopters (then referred to either as 'quadrotors' or simply as 'helicopters') were seen as possible solutions to some of the persistent problems in vertical flight. Torque-induced control issues (as well as efficiency issues originating from the [[tail rotor]], which generates no useful lift) can be eliminated by counter-rotation, and the relatively short blades are much easier to construct. A number of manned designs appeared in the 1920s and 1930s. These vehicles were among the first successful heavier-than-air [[VTOL|vertical take off and landing (VTOL)]] vehicles.<ref name=\"leishman00\">{{cite book | last = Leishman | first = J.G. | title = Principles of Helicopter Aerodynamics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 | location = New York, NY | url = https://books.google.com/?id=nMV-TkaX-9cC&pg=PA688&lpg=PA688&dq=Leishman,+J.G.+%282000%29.+Principles+of+Helicopter+Aerodynamics.#v=snippet&q=quadrotor&f=false| isbn = 9780521858601 }}</ref>  However, early prototypes suffered from poor performance,<ref name=\"leishman00\" /> and latter prototypes required too much pilot work load, due to poor stability augmentation<ref name=\"anderson81\">{{Cite journal | last = Anderson | first = S.B. | title = Historical Overview of V/STOL Aircraft Technology | journal = NASA Technical Memorandum 81280 | year = 1997 | url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20020051099&hterms=81280&qs=N%3D0%26Ntk%3DAll%26Ntt%3D81280%26Ntx%3Dmode%2520matchallpartial%26Nm%3D17%7CCollection%7CNACA%7C%7C123%7CCollection%7CNASA%2520STI}}</ref> and limited control authority.\n\nAround 2005 to 2010, advances in electronics allowed the production of cheap lightweight flight controllers, [[accelerometer]]s ([[Inertial measurement unit|IMU]]), [[global positioning systems|global positioning system]] and cameras.

Among the six designs he tried, his helicopter No.2 had four rotors and eight propellers, all driven by a single engine.  The Oehmichen No.2 used a steel-tube frame, with two-bladed rotors at the ends of the four arms. The angle of these blades could be varied by warping. Five of the propellers, spinning in the horizontal plane, stabilized the machine laterally.  Another propeller was mounted at the nose for steering.  The remaining pair of propellers functioned as its forward propulsion. The aircraft exhibited a considerable degree of stability and increase in control-accuracy for its time, and made over a thousand test flights during the middle 1920s.

Two small propellers with variable pitch were used for thrust and yaw control.  The vehicle used collective pitch control. Built by the US Air Service, it made its first flight in October 1922. About 100 flights were made by the end of 1923.  The highest it ever reached was about {{convert|5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Although demonstrating feasibility, it was underpowered, unresponsive, mechanically complex and susceptible to reliability problems.

Due to a lack of orders for commercial or military versions however, the project was terminated.

Two VZ-7 prototypes were created and both performed adequately during the initial flight test program, and both did reasonably well when evaluated by the Army. The VZ-7 was capable of hovering and forward flight and proved relatively stable and easy to operate.

The need for aircraft with greater maneuverability and hovering ability has led to a rise in quadcopter research. The four-rotor design allows quadcopters to be relatively simple in design yet highly reliable and maneuverable. Research is continuing to increase the abilities of quadcopters by making advances in multi-craft communication, environment exploration, and maneuverability. If these developing qualities can be combined, quadcopters would be capable of advanced autonomous missions that are currently not possible with other vehicles.<ref name=\"illumin\">{{cite web|url=http://illumin.usc.edu/162/the-quadrotors-coming-of-age|title=Illumin -

FAA's decision on the matter caused resistance from the hobbyist community at the time. In October 2015 the FAA issued rules legally requiring registration, starting January 2016, but on May 19, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Washington D.C. circuit ruled that this violated the 2012 FAA Modernization and Reform Act, which states that the FAA \u201cmay not promulgate any rule or regulation regarding a model aircraft.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/appeals-court-strikes-down-faa-registry-recreational-drones-n763871|title=FAA recreational drone registry struck down by federal appeals court|work=NBC News|access-date=2017-07-21}}</ref> The FAA continues to allow registration on a voluntary basis, as well as requiring it for commercial use, but states that it is not required if \"flying under the Special Rule for Model Aircraft\" (recreational hobby use).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://registermyuas.faa.gov/|title=sUAS Registration|website=registermyuas.faa.gov|access-date=2017-07-21}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the registration requirement, FAA has also released various operational requirements as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/?newsId=84386|title=FAA Small Unmanned Aircraft Registration Begins|website=www.faa.gov|access-date=2017-07-09}}</ref>\n\n* Flight only below 400 feet above ground.\n* The operator must maintain visual contact with the aircraft at all times.\n* Not fly near manned aircraft, especially near airports.\n* Not fly over groups of people, stadiums or sporting events.\n* Not fly near emergency response efforts, such as accident sites or forest fires.\n\nOn October 5, 2018, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 passed congress and was sent for the president's signature. The bipartisan bill split the hobbyist community, with the Commercial Drone Alliance in favor of the new law, while the Academy of Model Aeronautics urged its members to oppose the bill.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr302/BILLS-115hr302enr.pdf|title=FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe major change in the new law is the repeal of Section 336. All sUAS owners, including quadcopters, will be required to register their aircraft and pass a general aeronautical knowledge test. In June 2019, the FAA announced new rules for recreational and non-commercial fliers. Recreational pilots would no longer be allowed to fly in controlled airspace by contacting air traffic control towers.

If all rotors are spinning at the same [[angular velocity]], with rotors one and three rotating clockwise and rotors two and four counterclockwise, the net aerodynamic torque, and hence the angular acceleration about the [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw axis]], is exactly zero, which means there is no need for a tail rotor as on conventional helicopters. Yaw is induced by mismatching the balance in aerodynamic torques (i.e., by offsetting the cumulative thrust commands between the counter-rotating blade pairs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cog.yonsei.ac.kr/quad/quad.htm|title=Quadrotor|accessdate=29 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227193853/http://cog.yonsei.ac.kr/quad/quad.htm|archivedate=27 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://hoverbear.org/2015/05/27/quadcopters-yaw/|title=Quadcopters: Yaw|publisher=hoverbear.org|author=Andrew Hobden|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Quadrotor yaw torque.png|Schematic of reaction torques on each motor of a quadcopter aircraft, due to spinning rotors.

Quadcopters are classified as [[rotorcraft]], as opposed to [[fixed-wing aircraft]], because their [[Lift (force)|lift]] is generated by a set of [[helicopter rotor|rotors]] (vertically oriented [[propeller]]s).\n\nQuadcopters generally use two pairs of identical fixed pitch propellers; two [[clockwise]] (CW) and two [[counterclockwise]] (CCW). These use independent variation of the speed of each rotor to achieve control. By changing the speed of each rotor it is possible to specifically generate a desired total [[thrust]]; to locate for the [[centre of thrust]] both laterally and longitudinally; and to create a desired total [[torque]], or turning force.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stafford |first=Jesse|url=http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/webproj/212_spring_2014/Clay_Allen/clay_allen/works.html |title=How a Quadcopter works &#124; Clay Allen  |publisher=University of Alaska, Fairbanks |date=Spring 2014 |accessdate=2015-01-20}}</ref>\n\nQuadcopters differ from conventional helicopters, which use rotors that are able to vary the pitch of their blades dynamically as they move around the rotor hub. In the early days of flight, quadcopters (then referred to either as 'quadrotors' or simply as 'helicopters') were seen as possible solutions to some of the persistent problems in vertical flight. Torque-induced control issues (as well as efficiency issues originating from the [[tail rotor]], which generates no useful lift) can be eliminated by counter-rotation, and the relatively short blades are much easier to construct. A number of manned designs appeared in the 1920s and 1930s. These vehicles were among the first successful heavier-than-air [[VTOL|vertical take off and landing (VTOL)]] vehicles.<ref name=\"leishman00\">{{cite book | last = Leishman | first = J.G. | title = Principles of Helicopter Aerodynamics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 | location = New York, NY | url = https://books.google.com/?id=nMV-TkaX-9cC&pg=PA688&lpg=PA688&dq=Leishman,+J.G.+%282000%29.+Principles+of+Helicopter+Aerodynamics.#v=snippet&q=quadrotor&f=false| isbn = 9780521858601 }}</ref>  However, early prototypes suffered from poor performance,<ref name=\"leishman00\" /> and latter prototypes required too much pilot work load, due to poor stability augmentation<ref name=\"anderson81\">{{Cite journal | last = Anderson | first = S.B. | title = Historical Overview of V/STOL Aircraft Technology | journal = NASA Technical Memorandum 81280 | year = 1997 | url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20020051099&hterms=81280&qs=N%3D0%26Ntk%3DAll%26Ntt%3D81280%26Ntx%3Dmode%2520matchallpartial%26Nm%3D17%7CCollection%7CNACA%7C%7C123%7CCollection%7CNASA%2520STI}}</ref> and limited control authority.\n\nAround 2005 to 2010, advances in electronics allowed the production of cheap lightweight flight controllers, [[accelerometer]]s ([[Inertial measurement unit|IMU]]), [[global positioning systems|global positioning system]] and cameras.

Among the six designs he tried, his helicopter No.2 had four rotors and eight propellers, all driven by a single engine.  The Oehmichen No.2 used a steel-tube frame, with two-bladed rotors at the ends of the four arms. The angle of these blades could be varied by warping. Five of the propellers, spinning in the horizontal plane, stabilized the machine laterally.  Another propeller was mounted at the nose for steering.  The remaining pair of propellers functioned as its forward propulsion. The aircraft exhibited a considerable degree of stability and increase in control-accuracy for its time, and made over a thousand test flights during the middle 1920s.

All sUAS owners, including quadcopters, will be required to register their aircraft and pass a general aeronautical knowledge test. In June 2019, the FAA announced new rules for recreational and non-commercial fliers. Recreational pilots would no longer be allowed to fly in controlled airspace by contacting air traffic control towers. This rule will be in effect until the LAANC system for hobbyists is rolled out in the summer of 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/|title=Recreational Flyers & Modeler Community-Based Organizations|website=www.faa.gov|access-date=2019-06-24}}</ref>\n\n==Flight dynamics==\nEach rotor produces both a [[thrust]] and [[torque]] about its center of rotation, as well as a [[drag force]] opposite to the vehicle's direction of flight.  If all rotors are spinning at the same [[angular velocity]], with rotors one and three rotating clockwise and rotors two and four counterclockwise, the net aerodynamic torque, and hence the angular acceleration about the [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw axis]], is exactly zero, which means there is no need for a tail rotor as on conventional helicopters. Yaw is induced by mismatching the balance in aerodynamic torques (i.e., by offsetting the cumulative thrust commands between the counter-rotating blade pairs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cog.yonsei.ac.kr/quad/quad.htm|title=Quadrotor|accessdate=29 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227193853/http://cog.yonsei.ac.kr/quad/quad.htm|archivedate=27 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://hoverbear.org/2015/05/27/quadcopters-yaw/|title=Quadcopters: Yaw|publisher=hoverbear.org|author=Andrew Hobden|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Quadrotor yaw torque.png|Schematic of reaction torques on each motor of a quadcopter aircraft, due to spinning rotors.

In this case, each arm has two motors running in opposite directions (one facing up and one facing down).<ref>Hu, Jiaqi (November 2018).

For best performance and simplest control algorithms, the motors and propellers should be placed equidistant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wyvernupenn.blogspot.ca/2010/04/mechanical-design.html|title=Wyvern Quadrotor Helicopter|author=Uriah|accessdate=29 December 2014|date=2010-04-13}}</ref> Recently, [[carbon fiber composites]] have become popular due to their light weight and structural stiffness.\n\nThe electrical components needed to construct a working quadcopter are similar to those needed for a modern [[RC helicopter]]. They are the [[Electronic Speed Control|electronic speed control]] module, on-board computer or controller board, and battery (or fuel cell<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/hydrogen-powered-drone/|title=Hydrogen-powered drone will fly for hours at a time|website=Engadget}}</ref>).

Many modern flight controllers use software that allows the user to mark \"way-points\" on a map, to which the quadcopter will fly and perform tasks, such as landing or gaining altitude.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/arducopter/ |title=arducopter - Arduino-based autopilot for mulirotor craft, from quadcopters to traditional helis - Google Project Hosting |accessdate=2013-08-15}}</ref> The [[PX4 autopilot|PX4 autopilot system]], an open-source software/hardware combination in development since 2009, has since been adopted by both hobbyists and drone manufacturing companies alike to give their quadcopter projects flight-control capabilities. Other flight applications include crowd control between several quadcopters where visual data from the device is used to predict where the crowd will move next and in turn direct the quadcopter to the next corresponding [[waypoint]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Khaleghi|first1=Amirreza|title=A Comparative Study of Control Architectures in UAV/UGV - based Surveillance System|date=2014|pages=4|url=http://www.xcdsystem.com/iie2014/abstract/finalpapers/I1276.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Endurance===\nElectric quadcopters have shorter endurance when compared to similarly sized electric helicopters because of the smaller \"disk area\" of the rotor blades. The longest flight time achieved by a battery-powered quadcopter was 2 hours, 31 minutes and 30 seconds. The record was set by Ferdinand Kickinger of Germany in 2016.<ref>{{Citation|last=Ferdinand Kickinger|title=151min30s FPV with Copter|date=2016-04-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AUd7K1lG6o|access-date=2018-08-26}}</ref> In setting the record, Kickinger used low-discharge rate, high capacity Lithium Ion batteries and stripped the airframe of non-essential weight to reduce power draw and extend endurance. However, the lack of features and the use of a low discharge battery make the vehicle unusable as a commercial product.<ref>SPK Drones. [https://www.spkdrones.com/how-quadcopters-fly/ How Quadcopters Fly].</ref>\n\nAlternative power sources like hydrogen fuel cells and hybrid gas-electric generators have been used to dramatically extend the endurance of quadcopters and multirotors in general because of the increased energy density of both hydrogen and gasoline, respectively.<ref>McNabb, Miriam (February 2018).

It is written from right to left in a [[cursive]] style and includes 28 letters. Most letters have contextual letterforms.\n\nThe Arabic alphabet is considered an [[abjad]], meaning it only uses [[consonant]]s, but it is now considered an \"[[impure abjad]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Natural Language Processing of Semitic Languages|last=Zitouni|first=Imed|publisher=Springer Science & Business|year=2014|isbn=3642453589|location=|pages=15}}</ref> As with other impure ''abjads'', such as the [[Hebrew alphabet]], scribes later devised means of indicating [[vowel]] sounds by separate vowel [[diacritics]].\n\n==Consonants==\nThe basic Arabic alphabet contains 28 [[letter (alphabet)|letters]]. Adaptations of the [[Arabic script]] for other languages added and removed some letters, as for [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], [[Central Kurdish|Central Kurdish]], [[Urdu]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Jawi script|Malay]], [[Pashto]], [[Arwi]] and [[Malayalam]] ([[Arabi Malayalam]]), all of which have additional letters as shown below. There are no distinct [[letter case|upper and lower case]] letter forms.\n\nMany letters look similar but are distinguished from one another by dots (''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Arabic diacritics#I'jam (phonetic distinctions of consonants)|\u02bei\u02bfj\u0101m]]}}'') above or below their central part (''{{transl|ar|[[rasm]]}}''). These dots are an integral part of a letter, since they distinguish between letters that represent different sounds. For example, the Arabic letters \u0628 (b), \u062a (t) and \u062b (th) have the same basic shape, but have one dot below, two dots above and three dots above; the letter \u0646 (n) also has the same form in initial and medial forms, with one dot above, though it is somewhat different in isolated and final form.\n\nBoth printed and written Arabic are [[cursive]], with most of the letters within a word directly connected to the adjacent letters.\n\n===Alphabetical order===\nThere are two main [[collation|collating sequences]] for the Arabic alphabet: abjad and hija.\n\nThe original ''{{transl|ar|\u02beabjad\u012by}}'' order ({{lang|ar|\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062c\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0651}}), used for [[lettering]], derives from the order of the [[Phoenician alphabet]], and is therefore similar to the order of other Phoenician-derived alphabets, such as the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. In this order, letters are also used as numbers, [[Abjad numerals]], and possess the same alphanumeric code/[[cipher]] as Hebrew [[gematria]] and Greek [[isopsephy]].\n\nThe ''{{transl|ar|hij\u0101\u2019\u012b}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u0647\u0650\u062c\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u064a}}) or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alifb\u0101\u02be\u012b}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u0623\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0641\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u064a}}) order, used where lists of names and words are sorted, as in phonebooks, classroom lists, and dictionaries, groups letters by similarity of shape.\n\n==== Abjad\u012b ====\nThe ''{{transl|ar|\u02beabjad\u012b}}'' order is not a simple historical continuation of the earlier north Semitic alphabetic order, since it has a position corresponding to the Aramaic letter ''[[samekh]]/semkat'' {{lang|he|\u05e1}}, yet no letter of the Arabic alphabet historically derives from that letter. Loss of ''{{transl|he|same\u1e35}}'' was compensated for by the split of ''[[shin (letter)|shin]]'' {{lang|he|\u05e9}} into two independent Arabic letters, {{lang|ar|\u0634}} (''sh\u012bn'') and {{lang|ar|\ufeb1}} (''s\u012bn'') which moved up to take the place of ''{{transl|he|same\u1e35}}''.

Letters can exhibit up to four distinct forms corresponding to an initial, medial (middle), final, or isolated position ([[IMFI]]). While some letters show considerable variations, others remain almost identical across all four positions. Generally, letters in the same word are linked together on both sides by short horizontal lines, but six letters ({{lang|ar|\u0648 ,\u0632 ,\u0631 ,\u0630 ,\u062f ,\u0627}}) can only be linked to their preceding letter. For example, {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0631\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a}} ([[Mount Ararat|Ararat]]) has only isolated forms because each letter cannot be connected to its following one. In addition, some letter combinations are written as [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]] (special shapes), notably ''{{transl|ar|l\u0101m-alif}}'' {{lang|ar|\u0644\u0627}},<ref>{{cite book |title=Writing Systems: A Linguistic Approach |author=Rogers, Henry |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2005 |page=135}}</ref> which is the only mandatory ligature (the un-ligated combination {{lang|ar|\u0644\u0640\u0627}} is considered difficult to read).\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2015}}\n\n====Table of basic letters====\n{{other uses|Arabic script}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Arabic letters usage in Literary Arabic\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Common\n!colspan=\"2\"|[[Maghreb]]ian\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Letter <br/> name\n(Classical pronunciation)\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Letter <br/> name in Arabic script\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Romanization of Arabic|Trans-<br />literation]]\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Value in Literary Arabic ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]])\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Closest English equivalent in pronunciation\n!colspan=\"3\"|Contextual forms\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Isolated <br/> form\n|-\n!\u02beAbjad\u012b !!

Also names are regularly transcribed as pronounced locally, not as pronounced in [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] (if they were of Arabic origin).\n* Regarding pronunciation, the phonemic values given are those of Modern Standard Arabic, which is taught in schools and universities. In practice, pronunciation may vary considerably from region to region. For more details concerning the pronunciation of Arabic, consult the articles ''[[Arabic phonology]]'' and ''[[varieties of Arabic]]''.\n* The names of the Arabic letters can be thought of as abstractions of an older version where they were meaningful words in the [[Proto-Semitic]] language. Names of Arabic letters may have quite different names popularly.\n* Six letters ({{lang|ar|\u0648 \u0632 \u0631 \u0630 \u062f \u0627}}) do not have a distinct medial form and have to be written with their final form without being connected to the next letter. Their initial form matches the isolated form. The following letter is written in its initial form, or isolated form if it is the final letter in the word.\n* The letter ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'' originated in the [[Phoenician alphabet]] as a consonant-sign indicating a glottal stop. Today it has lost its function as a consonant, and, together with ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ya\u2019}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}'', is a ''[[mater lectionis]]'', a consonant sign standing in for a long vowel (see below), or as support for certain diacritics (''{{transl|ar|ALA|maddah}}'' and ''[[hamza|{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}]]'').\n* Arabic currently uses a [[diacritic]] sign, {{lang|ar|\u0621}}, called ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}'', to denote the [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[\u0294]}}, written alone or with a carrier:\n** alone: {{lang|ar|\u0621}}\n** with a carrier: {{lang|ar|\u0625 \u0623}} (above or under a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}''), {{lang|ar|\u0624}} (above a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}''), {{lang|ar|\u0626}} (above a dotless ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u2019}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u2019 hamzah}}'').\n\n:In academic work, the ''[[hamza|{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}]]'' ({{lang|ar|\u0621}}) is transliterated with the [[modifier letter right half ring]] (\u02be), while the [[modifier letter left half ring]] (\u02bf) transliterates the letter ''[[Ayin|{{transl|ar|ALA|\u2018ayn}}]]'' ({{lang|ar|\u0639}}), which represents a different sound, not found in English.\n\n::The ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}'' has a single form, since it is never linked to a preceding or following letter. However, it is sometimes combined with a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u2019}}'', or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'', and in that case the carrier behaves like an ordinary ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u2019}}'', or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}''.\n\n\n==== variations ==== \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|- \n| colspan=3 | '''The modern

Instead of writing the letter twice, Arabic places a ''W''-shaped sign called ''{{transl|ar|ALA|shaddah}}'', above it. Note that if a vowel occurs between the two consonants the letter will simply be written twice. The [[diacritic]] only appears where the consonant at the end of one syllable is identical to the initial consonant of the following syllable. (The generic term for such [[diacritic]]al signs is ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[harakat|\u1e25arak\u0101t]]}}'').\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | General Unicode \n! Name\n!

The vowel before it indicates [[grammatical case]]. In written Arabic nunation is indicated by doubling the vowel [[diacritic]] at the end of the word.\n\n== Vowels ==\nUsers of Arabic usually write [[vowel length|long vowels]] but omit short ones, so readers must utilize their knowledge of the language in order to supply the missing vowels. However, in the education system and particularly in classes on Arabic grammar these vowels are used since they are crucial to the grammar. An Arabic sentence can have a completely different meaning by a subtle change of the vowels. This is why in an important text such as the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Qur\u2019\u0101n}}'' the three basic vowel signs (see below) are mandated, like the ''[[Arabic diacritics|\u1e25arak\u0101t]]'' and all the other diacritics or other types of marks, for example the [[Cantillation|cantillation signs]].\n\n===Short vowels===\n{{Further|Arabic diacritics}}\n\nIn the Arabic handwriting of everyday use, in general publications, and on street signs, short vowels are typically not written. On the other hand, copies of the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Quran|Qur\u2019\u0101n]]}}'' cannot be endorsed by the religious institutes that review them unless the diacritics are included. Children's books, elementary school texts, and Arabic-language grammars in general will include diacritics to some degree. These are known as \"[[Arabic diacritics|vocalized]]\" texts.\n\nShort vowels may be written with [[diacritic]]s placed above or below the consonant that precedes them in the syllable, called ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u1e25arak\u0101t}}''. All Arabic vowels, long and short, follow a consonant; in Arabic, words like \"Ali\" or \"alif\", for example, start with a consonant: ''{{transl|ar|\u2018Aliyy}}''<!--not DIN 31635 transliteration-->, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}''.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In others, these ''y'' and ''w'' carry a ''suk\u016bn''. Outside of the ''Qur\u2019\u0101n'', the latter convention is extremely rare, to the point that ''y'' with ''suk\u016bn'' will be unambiguously read as the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/aj/}}, and ''w'' with ''suk\u016bn'' will be read {{IPA|/aw/}}.\n\nFor example, the letters ''{{transl|ar|m-y-l}}'' can be read like English ''meel'' or ''mail'', or (theoretically) also like ''mayyal'' or ''mayil''. But if a ''suk\u016bn'' is added on the ''y'' then the ''m'' cannot have a ''suk\u016bn'' (because two letters in a row cannot be ''suk\u016bn''ated), cannot have a ''\u1e0dammah'' (because there is never an ''uy'' sound in Arabic unless there is another vowel after the ''y''), and cannot have a ''kasrah'' (because ''kasrah'' before ''suk\u016bn''ated ''y'' is never found outside the ''Qur\u2019\u0101n''), so it ''must'' have a ''fat\u1e25ah'' and the only possible pronunciation is {{IPA|/majl/}} (meaning mile, or even e-mail). By the same token, m-y-t with a ''suk\u016bn'' over the ''y'' can be ''mayt'' but not ''mayyit'' or ''meet'', and m-w-t with a ''suk\u016bn'' on the ''w'' can only be ''mawt'', not ''moot'' (''iw'' is impossible when the ''w'' closes the syllable).\n\nVowel marks are always written as if the ''[[\u2019I\u2018rab|i\u2018r\u0101b]]'' vowels were in fact pronounced, even when they must be skipped in actual pronunciation. So, when writing the name ''A\u1e25mad'', it is optional to place a ''suk\u016bn'' on the ''\u1e25'', but a ''suk\u016bn'' is forbidden on the ''d'', because it would carry a ''\u1e0dammah'' if any other word followed, as in ''A\u1e25madu zawj\u012b'' \"Ahmad is my husband\".\n\nAnother example: the sentence that in correct literary Arabic must be pronounced ''A\u1e25madu zawjun shirr\u012br'' \"Ahmad is a wicked husband\", is usually mispronounced (due to influence from vernacular Arabic varieties) as ''A\u1e25mad zawj shirr\u012br''. Yet, for the purposes of Arabic grammar and orthography, is treated as if it were not mispronounced and as if yet another word followed it, i.e., if adding any vowel marks, they must be added as if the pronunciation were ''A\u1e25madu zawjun sharr\u012brun'' with a ''tanw\u012bn'' 'un' at the end. So, it is correct to add an ''un'' ''tanw\u012bn'' sign on the final ''r'', but actually pronouncing it would be a hypercorrection. Also, it is never correct to write a ''suk\u016bn'' on that ''r'', even though in actual pronunciation it is (and in correct Arabic MUST be) ''suk\u016bn''ed.\n\nOf course, if the correct ''i\u2018r\u0101b'' is a ''suk\u016bn'', it may be optionally written.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!General<br />Unicode\n!Name\n!Name in Arabic script\n!Translit.\n!Phonemic Value (IPA)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"| 0652  \n| <span style=\"font-size:150%;\">{{script/Arabic| \u0640\u0640\u0652\u0640 }}</span>\n|suk\u016bn\n|\u0633\u064f\u0643\u064f\u0648\u0646\n|(no vowel with this consonant letter or<br />diphthong with this long vowel letter)\n|\u2205\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"| 0670 \n| <span style=\"font-size:150%;\">{{script/Arabic| \u0640\u0640\u0670\u0640 }}</span>\n| {alif khanjariyyah [dagger \u2019alif - smaller \u2019alif written above consonant]\n| \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0641 \u062e\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062c\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\n| ''\u0101''\n| {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}\n|}\n\u0670\u0670\nThe ''suk\u016bn'' is also used for transliterating words into the Arabic script.

In most of present-day North Africa, the usual Western Arabic numerals are used. Like Western Arabic numerals, in Eastern Arabic numerals, the units are always right-most, and the highest value left-most.\n\n===Letters as numerals===\n{{main|Abjad numerals}}\n\nIn addition, the Arabic alphabet can be used to represent numbers ([[Abjad numerals]]). This usage is based on the ''{{transl|ar|\u02beabjad\u012b}}'' order of the alphabet. {{lang|ar|\u0623}} ''{{transl|ar|\u02bealif}}'' is 1, {{lang|ar|\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|b\u0101\u02be}}'' is 2, {{lang|ar|\u062c}} ''{{transl|ar|j\u012bm}}'' is 3, and so on until {{lang|ar|\u064a}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}}'' = 10, {{lang|ar|\u0643}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|k\u0101f}}'' = 20, {{lang|ar|\u0644}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|l\u0101m}}'' = 30, ..., {{lang|ar|\u0631}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|r\u0101\u02be}}'' = 200, ..., {{lang|ar|\u063a}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ghayn}}'' = 1000. This is sometimes used to produce [[chronogram]]s.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Arabic alphabet}}\n[[File:Arabic script evolution.svg|thumb|250px|Evolution of early [[Islamic calligraphy|Arabic calligraphy]] (9th\u201311th century). The ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Basmala]]}}'' is taken as an example, from [[Kufic]] ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Qur\u2019\u0101n]]}}'' manuscripts. (1) Early 9th century script used no dots or [[diacritic]] marks;<ref>[[commons:File:Basmala kufi.svg|File:Basmala kufi.svg - Wikimedia Commons]]</ref> (2) and (3) in the 9th\u201310th century during the Abbasid dynasty, [[Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali|Abu al-Aswad]]'s system used red dots with each arrangement or position indicating a different short vowel. Later, a second system of black dots was used to differentiate between letters like ''{{transl|ar|ALA|f\u0101\u2019}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|q\u0101f}}'';<ref name=\"wikimedia1\">[[commons:File:Kufi.jpg|File:Kufi.jpg - Wikimedia Commons]]</ref><ref name=\"wikimedia1\"/> (4) in the 11th century ([[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi|al-Far\u0101h\u012bd\u012b]]'s system) dots were changed into shapes resembling the letters to transcribe the corresponding long vowels. This system is the one used today.<ref>[[commons:File:Qur'an folio 11th century kufic.jpg|File:Qur'an folio 11th century kufic.jpg - Wikimedia Commons]]</ref>]]\nThe Arabic alphabet can be traced back to the [[Nabataean alphabet]] used to write [[Nabataean]]. The first known text in the Arabic alphabet is a late 4th-century inscription from ''{{transl|ar|[[Jabal Ramm]]}}'' (50&nbsp;km east of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Aqaba|\u2018Aqabah]]}}'') in [[Jordan]], but the first dated one is a trilingual inscription at [[Zebed]] in [[Syria]] from 512.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} However, the [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] record is extremely sparse, with only five certainly [[pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions]] surviving, though some others may be pre-Islamic. Later, dots were added above and below the letters to differentiate them. (The Aramaic language had fewer phonemes than the Arabic, and some originally distinct Aramaic letters had become indistinguishable in shape, so that in the early writings 15 distinct letter-shapes had to do duty for 28 sounds; cf. the similarly ambiguous [[Book Pahlavi|Pahlavi]] alphabet.) The first surviving document that definitely uses these dots is also the first surviving Arabic [[papyrus]] ([[PERF 558]]), dated April 643, although they did not become obligatory until much later. Important texts were and still are frequently memorized, especially in [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|Qur\u02bean memorization]].\n\nLater still, vowel marks and the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}'' were introduced, beginning some time in the latter half of the 7th century, preceding the first invention of [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]] and [[Tiberian vocalization|Hebrew vocalization]]. Initially, this was done by a system of red dots, said to have been commissioned in the [[Umayyad caliphate|Umayyad]] era by [[Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali]] a dot above = ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a}}'', a dot below = ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}'', a dot on the line = ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'', and doubled dots indicated [[nunation]]. However, this was cumbersome and easily confusable with the letter-distinguishing dots, so about 100 years later, the modern system was adopted. The system was finalized around 786 by ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[al-Farahidi|al-Far\u0101h\u012bd\u012b]]}}''.\n\n=== Arabic printing presses ===\nAlthough [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] generally receives credit for introducing the printing press to [[Egypt]] during his invasion of that country in 1798, and though he did indeed bring printing presses and [[Arabic script]] presses to print the French occupation's official newspaper ''Al-Tanbiyyah'' (\"The Courier\"), printing in the Arabic language started several centuries earlier.\n\nIn 1514, following [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s invention of the printing press in 1450, Gregorio de Gregorii, a Venetian, published an entire prayer-book in Arabic script; it was entitled ''[[Kitab salat al-sawai|Kitab Salat al-Sawa'i]]'' and was intended for eastern Christian communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.viverefano.com/2014/11/19/294-anniversario-della-biblioteca-federiciana-ricerche-e-curiosit-sul-kitab-salat-al-sawai/504874/|title=294\u00b0 anniversario della Biblioteca Federiciana: ricerche e curiosit\u00e0 sul Kitab Salat al-Sawai|access-date=2017-01-31}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1580 and 1586, type designer [[Robert Granjon]] designed Arabic typefaces for Cardinal [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando de' Medici]], and the [[Medici Oriental Press|Medici press]] published many Christian prayer and scholarly Arabic texts in the late 16th century.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xu2y8w_o2sQC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=Robert+Granjon+designed+Arabic+typefaces&source=bl&ots=yaY_spZf0n&sig=ACfU3U0Hql1-4FJkIlaLNjavA6qNgWECpA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiDrYu41rPhAhVuThUIHRi4B3w4ChDoATAGegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=Robert%20Granjon%20designed%20Arabic%20typefaces&f=false|title=Design and Structure of Arabic Script|last=Naghashian|first=Naghi|date=2013-01-21|publisher=epubli|isbn=9783844245059|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Maronite]] monks at the Maar Quzhayy Monastery in [[Mount Lebanon]] published the first Arabic books to use movable type in the Middle East. The monks transliterated the Arabic language using [[Syriac language|Syriac]] script.\n\nA goldsmith (like Gutenberg) designed and implemented an Arabic-script movable-type printing-press in the Middle East. The [[Greek Orthodox]] monk [[Abd Allah Zakhir]] set up an [[Arabic]] [[printing press]] using [[movable type]] at the monastery of Saint John at the town of [[Dhour El Shuwayr]] in Mount Lebanon, the first homemade press in Lebanon using Arabic script. He personally cut the type molds and did the founding of the typeface. The first book came off his press in 1734; this press continued in use until 1899.<ref>\n[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198102/arabic.and.the.art.of.printing-a.special.section.htm Arabic and the Art of Printing \u2013 A Special Section] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229133008/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198102/arabic.and.the.art.of.printing-a.special.section.htm |date=29 December 2006 }}, by Paul Lunde\n</ref>\n\n== Computers ==\nThe Arabic alphabet can be encoded using several [[character set]]s, including [[ISO-8859-6]], [[Windows-1256]] and [[Unicode]] (see links in Infobox above), latter thanks to the \"Arabic segment\", entries U+0600 to U+06FF. However, none of the sets indicates the form that each character should take in context. It is left to the [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering engine]] to select the proper [[glyph]] to display for each character.\n\nEach letter has a position-independent encoding in [[Unicode]], and the rendering software can infer the correct glyph form (initial, medial, final or isolated) from its joining context. That is the current recommendation. However, for compatibility with previous standards, the initial, medial, final and isolated forms can also be encoded separately.\n\n===Unicode===\n{{Main|Arabic characters in Unicode}}\nAs of [[Unicode]] 13.0, the [[Arabic script]] is contained in the following [[Unicode block|blocks]]:<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Scripts.txt | work=Unicode Character Database | title=UAX #24: Script data file | publisher=The Unicode Consortium}}</ref>\n* [[Arabic (Unicode block)|Arabic]] (0600\u201306FF, 255 characters)\n* [[Arabic Supplement]] (0750\u2013077F, 48 characters)\n* [[Arabic Extended-A]] (08A0\u201308FF, 84 characters)\n* [[Arabic Presentation Forms-A]] (FB50\u2013FDFF, 611 characters)\n* [[Arabic Presentation Forms-B]] (FE70\u2013FEFF, 141 characters)\n* [[Rumi Numeral Symbols]] (10E60\u201310E7F, 31 characters)\n* [[Indic Siyaq Numbers (Unicode block)|Indic Siyaq Numbers]] (1EC70\u20131ECBF, 68 characters)\n* [[Ottoman Siyaq Numbers (Unicode block)|Ottoman Siyaq Numbers]] (1ED00\u20131ED4F, 61 characters)\n* [[Arabic Mathematical Alphabetic Symbols]] (1EE00\u20141EEFF, 143 characters)\n\nThe basic Arabic range encodes the standard letters and diacritics but does not encode contextual forms (U+0621-U+0652 being directly based on [[ISO 8859-6]]). It also includes the most common diacritics and [[Arabic-Indic digits]]. U+06D6 to U+06ED encode Qur'anic annotation signs such as \"end of ''[[ayah]]''\" \u06dd\u06d6 and \"start of ''[[Rub El Hizb|rub el hizb]]''\" \u06de. The Arabic supplement range encodes letter variants mostly used for writing African (non-Arabic) languages. The Arabic Extended-A range encodes additional Qur'anic annotations and letter variants used for various non-Arabic languages.\n\nThe Arabic Presentation Forms-A range encodes contextual forms and ligatures of letter variants needed for Persian, Urdu, Sindhi and Central Asian languages. The Arabic Presentation Forms-B range encodes spacing forms of Arabic diacritics, and more contextual letter forms. The Arabic Mathematical Alphabetical Symbols block encodes characters used in Arabic mathematical expressions.\n\nSee also the notes of the section on [[#Modified letters|modified letters]].\n\n===Keyboards===\n{{see also|Keyboard layout|Arabic keyboard}}\n[[File:KB Arabic MAC.svg|thumb|450px|Arabic Mac keyboard layout]]\n[[File:KB Arabic.svg|thumb|450px|Arabic PC keyboard layout]]\n[[File:Intellark4qwerty.png|thumb|450px|[[Intellark]] imposed on a QWERTY keyboard layout.]]\n\nKeyboards designed for different nations have different layouts so proficiency in one style of keyboard, such as Iraq's, does not transfer to proficiency in another, such as Saudi Arabia's. Differences can include the location of non-alphabetic characters.\n\nAll Arabic keyboards allow typing Roman characters, e.g., for the URL in a [[web browser]]. Thus, each Arabic keyboard has both Arabic and Roman characters marked on the keys. Usually the Roman characters of an Arabic keyboard conform to the [[QWERTY]] layout, but in [[North Africa]], where [[French language|French]] is the most common language typed using the Roman characters, the Arabic keyboards are [[AZERTY]].\n\nTo encode a particular written form of a character, there are extra code points provided in Unicode which can be used to express the exact written form desired. The range ''Arabic presentation forms A'' (U+FB50 to U+FDFF) contain ligatures while the range ''Arabic presentation forms B'' (U+FE70 to U+FEFF) contains the positional variants. These effects are better achieved in Unicode by using the ''[[zero-width joiner]]'' and ''[[zero-width non-joiner|non-joiner]]'', as these presentation forms are deprecated in Unicode, and should generally only be used within the internals of text-rendering software, when using Unicode as an intermediate form for conversion between character encodings, or for backwards compatibility with implementations that rely on the hard-coding of glyph forms.\n\nFinally, the Unicode encoding of Arabic is in ''logical order'', that is, the characters are entered, and stored in computer memory, in the order that they are written and pronounced without worrying about the direction in which they will be displayed on paper or on the screen.

It is written from right to left in a [[cursive]] style and includes 28 letters. Most letters have contextual letterforms.\n\nThe Arabic alphabet is considered an [[abjad]], meaning it only uses [[consonant]]s, but it is now considered an \"[[impure abjad]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Natural Language Processing of Semitic Languages|last=Zitouni|first=Imed|publisher=Springer Science & Business|year=2014|isbn=3642453589|location=|pages=15}}</ref> As with other impure ''abjads'', such as the [[Hebrew alphabet]], scribes later devised means of indicating [[vowel]] sounds by separate vowel [[diacritics]].\n\n==Consonants==\nThe basic Arabic alphabet contains 28 [[letter (alphabet)|letters]]. Adaptations of the [[Arabic script]] for other languages added and removed some letters, as for [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], [[Central Kurdish|Central Kurdish]], [[Urdu]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Jawi script|Malay]], [[Pashto]], [[Arwi]] and [[Malayalam]] ([[Arabi Malayalam]]), all of which have additional letters as shown below. There are no distinct [[letter case|upper and lower case]] letter forms.\n\nMany letters look similar but are distinguished from one another by dots (''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Arabic diacritics#I'jam (phonetic distinctions of consonants)|\u02bei\u02bfj\u0101m]]}}'') above or below their central part (''{{transl|ar|[[rasm]]}}''). These dots are an integral part of a letter, since they distinguish between letters that represent different sounds. For example, the Arabic letters \u0628 (b), \u062a (t) and \u062b (th) have the same basic shape, but have one dot below, two dots above and three dots above; the letter \u0646 (n) also has the same form in initial and medial forms, with one dot above, though it is somewhat different in isolated and final form.\n\nBoth printed and written Arabic are [[cursive]], with most of the letters within a word directly connected to the adjacent letters.\n\n===Alphabetical order===\nThere are two main [[collation|collating sequences]] for the Arabic alphabet: abjad and hija.\n\nThe original ''{{transl|ar|\u02beabjad\u012by}}'' order ({{lang|ar|\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062c\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0651}}), used for [[lettering]], derives from the order of the [[Phoenician alphabet]], and is therefore similar to the order of other Phoenician-derived alphabets, such as the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. In this order, letters are also used as numbers, [[Abjad numerals]], and possess the same alphanumeric code/[[cipher]] as Hebrew [[gematria]] and Greek [[isopsephy]].\n\nThe ''{{transl|ar|hij\u0101\u2019\u012b}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u0647\u0650\u062c\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u064a}}) or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alifb\u0101\u02be\u012b}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u0623\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0641\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u064a}}) order, used where lists of names and words are sorted, as in phonebooks, classroom lists, and dictionaries, groups letters by similarity of shape.\n\n==== Abjad\u012b ====\nThe ''{{transl|ar|\u02beabjad\u012b}}'' order is not a simple historical continuation of the earlier north Semitic alphabetic order, since it has a position corresponding to the Aramaic letter ''[[samekh]]/semkat'' {{lang|he|\u05e1}}, yet no letter of the Arabic alphabet historically derives from that letter. Loss of ''{{transl|he|same\u1e35}}'' was compensated for by the split of ''[[shin (letter)|shin]]'' {{lang|he|\u05e9}} into two independent Arabic letters, {{lang|ar|\u0634}} (''sh\u012bn'') and {{lang|ar|\ufeb1}} (''s\u012bn'') which moved up to take the place of ''{{transl|he|same\u1e35}}''. The six other letters that do not correspond to any north Semitic letter are placed at the end.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Common ''{{transl|ar|ALA|abjad\u012b}}'' sequence\n|-\n| {{lang|ar|\u063a}} || {{lang|ar|\u0638}} || {{lang|ar|\u0636}} || {{lang|ar|\u0630}} || {{lang|ar|\u062e}} || {{lang|ar|\u062b}} || {{lang|ar|\u062a}} || {{lang|ar|\u0634}} || {{lang|ar|\u0631}} || {{lang|ar|\u0642}} || {{lang|ar|\u0635}} || {{lang|ar|\u0641}} || {{lang|ar|\u0639}} || {{lang|ar|\u0633}} || {{lang|ar|\u0646}} || {{lang|ar|\u0645}} || {{lang|ar|\u0644}} || {{lang|ar|\u0643}} || {{lang|ar|\u064a}} || {{lang|ar|\u0637}} || {{lang|ar|\u062d}} || {{lang|ar|\u0632}} || {{lang|ar|\u0648}} || {{lang|ar|\u0647}} || {{lang|ar|\u062f}} || {{lang|ar|\u062c}} || {{lang|ar|\u0628}} || {{lang|ar|\u0623}}\n|-\n| {{transl|ar|gh}} || {{transl|ar|\u1e93}} || {{transl|ar|\u1e0d}} || {{transl|ar|dh}} || {{transl|ar|kh}} || {{transl|ar|th}} || {{transl|ar|t}} || {{transl|ar|sh}} || {{transl|ar|r}} || {{transl|ar|q}} || {{transl|ar|\u1e63}} || {{transl|ar|f}} || '''{{transl|ar|\u02bf}}''' || {{transl|ar|s}} || {{transl|ar|n}} || {{transl|ar|m}} || {{transl|ar|l}} || {{transl|ar|k}} || {{transl|ar|y}} || {{transl|ar|\u1e6d}} || {{transl|ar|\u1e25}} || {{transl|ar|z}} || {{transl|ar|w}} || {{transl|ar|h}} || {{transl|ar|d}} || {{transl|ar|j}} || {{transl|ar|b}} || {{transl|ar|\u02be}}\n|- style=\"color:gray\"\n| 28 || 27 || 26 || 25 || 24 || 23 || 22 || 21 || 20 || 19 || 18 || 17 || 16 || 15 || 14 || 13 || 12 || 11 || 10 || 09 || 08 || 07 || 06 || 05 || 04 || 03 || 02 || 01\n|-\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=yellow |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=yellow  |\n| colspan=4 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=pink |\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=yellow |\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=pink |\n| colspan=14 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n|}\n\nThis is commonly vocalized as follows:\n: ''{{transl|ar|\u02beabjad hawwaz \u1e25u\u1e6d\u1e6d\u012b kalaman sa\u02bffa\u1e63 qarashat thakhadh \u1e0da\u1e93agh}}''.\nAnother vocalization is:\n: ''{{transl|ar|\u02beabujadin hawazin \u1e25u\u1e6diya kalman sa\u02bffa\u1e63 qurishat thakhudh \u1e0da\u1e93ugh}}''{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ [[Maghreb]]ian ''{{transl|ar|abjad\u012b}}'' sequence (probably older)<ref name=\"magb\">{{in lang|ar}} [http://alyaseer.net/vb/showthread.php?t=8807 Alyaseer.net {{lang|ar|\u062a\u0631\u062a\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0637\u0627\u0642\u0627\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0627\u0626\u0645 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639\u064a\u0629}} Ordering entries and cards in subject indexes] Discussion thread ''(Accessed 2009-October\u201306)''</ref>\n|-\n| {{lang|ar|\u0634}} || {{lang|ar|\u063a}} || {{lang|ar|\u0638}} || {{lang|ar|\u0630}} || {{lang|ar|\u062e}} || {{lang|ar|\u062b}} || {{lang|ar|\u062a}} || {{lang|ar|\u0633}} || {{lang|ar|\u0631}} || {{lang|ar|\u0642}} || {{lang|ar|\u0636}} || {{lang|ar|\u0641}} || {{lang|ar|\u0639}} || {{lang|ar|\u0635}} || {{lang|ar|\u0646}} || {{lang|ar|\u0645}} || {{lang|ar|\u0644}} || {{lang|ar|\u0643}} || {{lang|ar|\u064a}} || {{lang|ar|\u0637}} || {{lang|ar|\u062d}} || {{lang|ar|\u0632}} || {{lang|ar|\u0648}} || {{lang|ar|\u0647}} || {{lang|ar|\u062f}} || {{lang|ar|\u062c}} || {{lang|ar|\u0628}} || {{lang|ar|\u0623}}\n|-\n| {{transl|ar|sh}} || {{transl|ar|gh}} || {{transl|ar|\u1e93}} || {{transl|ar|dh}} || {{transl|ar|kh}} || {{transl|ar|th}} || {{transl|ar|t}} || {{transl|ar|s}} || {{transl|ar|r}} || {{transl|ar|q}} || {{transl|ar|\u1e0d}} || {{transl|ar|f}} || '''{{transl|ar|\u02bf}}''' || {{transl|ar|\u1e63}} || {{transl|ar|n}} || {{transl|ar|m}} || {{transl|ar|l}} || {{transl|ar|k}} || {{transl|ar|y}} || {{transl|ar|\u1e6d}} || {{transl|ar|\u1e25}} || {{transl|ar|z}} || {{transl|ar|w}} || {{transl|ar|h}} || {{transl|ar|d}} || {{transl|ar|j}} || {{transl|ar|b}} || {{transl|ar|\u02be}}\n|- style=\"color:gray\"|\n| 28 || 27 || 26 || 25 || 24 || 23 || 22 || 21 || 20 || 19 || 18 || 17 || 16 || 15 || 14 || 13 || 12 || 11 || 10 || 09 || 08 || 07 || 06 || 05 || 04 || 03 || 02 || 01\n|-\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=pink |\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=yellow |\n| colspan=4 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=pink |\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=yellow |\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=yellow |\n| colspan=14 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n|-\n| colspan=\"28\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" style=\"font-size: 70%;

Letters can exhibit up to four distinct forms corresponding to an initial, medial (middle), final, or isolated position ([[IMFI]]). While some letters show considerable variations, others remain almost identical across all four positions. Generally, letters in the same word are linked together on both sides by short horizontal lines, but six letters ({{lang|ar|\u0648 ,\u0632 ,\u0631 ,\u0630 ,\u062f ,\u0627}}) can only be linked to their preceding letter. For example, {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0631\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a}} ([[Mount Ararat|Ararat]]) has only isolated forms because each letter cannot be connected to its following one. In addition, some letter combinations are written as [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]] (special shapes), notably ''{{transl|ar|l\u0101m-alif}}'' {{lang|ar|\u0644\u0627}},<ref>{{cite book |title=Writing Systems: A Linguistic Approach |author=Rogers, Henry |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2005 |page=135}}</ref> which is the only mandatory ligature (the un-ligated combination {{lang|ar|\u0644\u0640\u0627}} is considered difficult to read).\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2015}}\n\n====Table of basic letters====\n{{other uses|Arabic script}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Arabic letters usage in Literary Arabic\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Common\n!colspan=\"2\"|[[Maghreb]]ian\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Letter <br/> name\n(Classical pronunciation)\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Letter <br/> name in Arabic script\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Romanization of Arabic|Trans-<br />literation]]\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Value in Literary Arabic ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]])\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Closest English equivalent in pronunciation\n!colspan=\"3\"|Contextual forms\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Isolated <br/> form\n|-\n!\u02beAbjad\u012b !!

Also names are regularly transcribed as pronounced locally, not as pronounced in [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] (if they were of Arabic origin).\n* Regarding pronunciation, the phonemic values given are those of Modern Standard Arabic, which is taught in schools and universities. In practice, pronunciation may vary considerably from region to region. For more details concerning the pronunciation of Arabic, consult the articles ''[[Arabic phonology]]'' and ''[[varieties of Arabic]]''.\n* The names of the Arabic letters can be thought of as abstractions of an older version where they were meaningful words in the [[Proto-Semitic]] language. Names of Arabic letters may have quite different names popularly.\n* Six letters ({{lang|ar|\u0648 \u0632 \u0631 \u0630 \u062f \u0627}}) do not have a distinct medial form and have to be written with their final form without being connected to the next letter. Their initial form matches the isolated form. The following letter is written in its initial form, or isolated form if it is the final letter in the word.\n* The letter ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'' originated in the [[Phoenician alphabet]] as a consonant-sign indicating a glottal stop. Today it has lost its function as a consonant, and, together with ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ya\u2019}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}'', is a ''[[mater lectionis]]'', a consonant sign standing in for a long vowel (see below), or as support for certain diacritics (''{{transl|ar|ALA|maddah}}'' and ''[[hamza|{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}]]'').\n* Arabic currently uses a [[diacritic]] sign, {{lang|ar|\u0621}}, called ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}'', to denote the [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[\u0294]}}, written alone or with a carrier:\n** alone: {{lang|ar|\u0621}}\n** with a carrier: {{lang|ar|\u0625 \u0623}} (above or under a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}''), {{lang|ar|\u0624}} (above a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}''), {{lang|ar|\u0626}} (above a dotless ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u2019}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u2019 hamzah}}'').\n\n:In academic work, the ''[[hamza|{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}]]'' ({{lang|ar|\u0621}}) is transliterated with the [[modifier letter right half ring]] (\u02be), while the [[modifier letter left half ring]] (\u02bf) transliterates the letter ''[[Ayin|{{transl|ar|ALA|\u2018ayn}}]]'' ({{lang|ar|\u0639}}), which represents a different sound, not found in English.\n\n::The ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}'' has a single form, since it is never linked to a preceding or following letter. However, it is sometimes combined with a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u2019}}'', or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'', and in that case the carrier behaves like an ordinary ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u2019}}'', or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}''.\n\n\n==== variations ==== \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|- \n| colspan=3 | '''The modern

Instead of writing the letter twice, Arabic places a ''W''-shaped sign called ''{{transl|ar|ALA|shaddah}}'', above it. Note that if a vowel occurs between the two consonants the letter will simply be written twice. The [[diacritic]] only appears where the consonant at the end of one syllable is identical to the initial consonant of the following syllable. (The generic term for such [[diacritic]]al signs is ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[harakat|\u1e25arak\u0101t]]}}'').\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | General Unicode \n! Name\n!

The vowel before it indicates [[grammatical case]]. In written Arabic nunation is indicated by doubling the vowel [[diacritic]] at the end of the word.\n\n== Vowels ==\nUsers of Arabic usually write [[vowel length|long vowels]] but omit short ones, so readers must utilize their knowledge of the language in order to supply the missing vowels. However, in the education system and particularly in classes on Arabic grammar these vowels are used since they are crucial to the grammar. An Arabic sentence can have a completely different meaning by a subtle change of the vowels. This is why in an important text such as the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Qur\u2019\u0101n}}'' the three basic vowel signs (see below) are mandated, like the ''[[Arabic diacritics|\u1e25arak\u0101t]]'' and all the other diacritics or other types of marks, for example the [[Cantillation|cantillation signs]].\n\n===Short vowels===\n{{Further|Arabic diacritics}}\n\nIn the Arabic handwriting of everyday use, in general publications, and on street signs, short vowels are typically not written. On the other hand, copies of the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Quran|Qur\u2019\u0101n]]}}'' cannot be endorsed by the religious institutes that review them unless the diacritics are included. Children's books, elementary school texts, and Arabic-language grammars in general will include diacritics to some degree. These are known as \"[[Arabic diacritics|vocalized]]\" texts.\n\nShort vowels may be written with [[diacritic]]s placed above or below the consonant that precedes them in the syllable, called ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u1e25arak\u0101t}}''. All Arabic vowels, long and short, follow a consonant; in Arabic, words like \"Ali\" or \"alif\", for example, start with a consonant: ''{{transl|ar|\u2018Aliyy}}''<!--not DIN 31635 transliteration-->, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}''.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In others, these ''y'' and ''w'' carry a ''suk\u016bn''. Outside of the ''Qur\u2019\u0101n'', the latter convention is extremely rare, to the point that ''y'' with ''suk\u016bn'' will be unambiguously read as the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/aj/}}, and ''w'' with ''suk\u016bn'' will be read {{IPA|/aw/}}.\n\nFor example, the letters ''{{transl|ar|m-y-l}}'' can be read like English ''meel'' or ''mail'', or (theoretically) also like ''mayyal'' or ''mayil''. But if a ''suk\u016bn'' is added on the ''y'' then the ''m'' cannot have a ''suk\u016bn'' (because two letters in a row cannot be ''suk\u016bn''ated), cannot have a ''\u1e0dammah'' (because there is never an ''uy'' sound in Arabic unless there is another vowel after the ''y''), and cannot have a ''kasrah'' (because ''kasrah'' before ''suk\u016bn''ated ''y'' is never found outside the ''Qur\u2019\u0101n''), so it ''must'' have a ''fat\u1e25ah'' and the only possible pronunciation is {{IPA|/majl/}} (meaning mile, or even e-mail). By the same token, m-y-t with a ''suk\u016bn'' over the ''y'' can be ''mayt'' but not ''mayyit'' or ''meet'', and m-w-t with a ''suk\u016bn'' on the ''w'' can only be ''mawt'', not ''moot'' (''iw'' is impossible when the ''w'' closes the syllable).\n\nVowel marks are always written as if the ''[[\u2019I\u2018rab|i\u2018r\u0101b]]'' vowels were in fact pronounced, even when they must be skipped in actual pronunciation. So, when writing the name ''A\u1e25mad'', it is optional to place a ''suk\u016bn'' on the ''\u1e25'', but a ''suk\u016bn'' is forbidden on the ''d'', because it would carry a ''\u1e0dammah'' if any other word followed, as in ''A\u1e25madu zawj\u012b'' \"Ahmad is my husband\".\n\nAnother example: the sentence that in correct literary Arabic must be pronounced ''A\u1e25madu zawjun shirr\u012br'' \"Ahmad is a wicked husband\", is usually mispronounced (due to influence from vernacular Arabic varieties) as ''A\u1e25mad zawj shirr\u012br''. Yet, for the purposes of Arabic grammar and orthography, is treated as if it were not mispronounced and as if yet another word followed it, i.e., if adding any vowel marks, they must be added as if the pronunciation were ''A\u1e25madu zawjun sharr\u012brun'' with a ''tanw\u012bn'' 'un' at the end. So, it is correct to add an ''un'' ''tanw\u012bn'' sign on the final ''r'', but actually pronouncing it would be a hypercorrection. Also, it is never correct to write a ''suk\u016bn'' on that ''r'', even though in actual pronunciation it is (and in correct Arabic MUST be) ''suk\u016bn''ed.\n\nOf course, if the correct ''i\u2018r\u0101b'' is a ''suk\u016bn'', it may be optionally written.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!General<br />Unicode\n!Name\n!Name in Arabic script\n!Translit.\n!Phonemic Value (IPA)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"| 0652  \n| <span style=\"font-size:150%;\">{{script/Arabic| \u0640\u0640\u0652\u0640 }}</span>\n|suk\u016bn\n|\u0633\u064f\u0643\u064f\u0648\u0646\n|(no vowel with this consonant letter or<br />diphthong with this long vowel letter)\n|\u2205\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"| 0670 \n| <span style=\"font-size:150%;\">{{script/Arabic| \u0640\u0640\u0670\u0640 }}</span>\n| {alif khanjariyyah [dagger \u2019alif - smaller \u2019alif written above consonant]\n| \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0641 \u062e\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062c\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\n| ''\u0101''\n| {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}\n|}\n\u0670\u0670\nThe ''suk\u016bn'' is also used for transliterating words into the Arabic script.

In most of present-day North Africa, the usual Western Arabic numerals are used. Like Western Arabic numerals, in Eastern Arabic numerals, the units are always right-most, and the highest value left-most.\n\n===Letters as numerals===\n{{main|Abjad numerals}}\n\nIn addition, the Arabic alphabet can be used to represent numbers ([[Abjad numerals]]). This usage is based on the ''{{transl|ar|\u02beabjad\u012b}}'' order of the alphabet. {{lang|ar|\u0623}} ''{{transl|ar|\u02bealif}}'' is 1, {{lang|ar|\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|b\u0101\u02be}}'' is 2, {{lang|ar|\u062c}} ''{{transl|ar|j\u012bm}}'' is 3, and so on until {{lang|ar|\u064a}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}}'' = 10, {{lang|ar|\u0643}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|k\u0101f}}'' = 20, {{lang|ar|\u0644}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|l\u0101m}}'' = 30, ..., {{lang|ar|\u0631}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|r\u0101\u02be}}'' = 200, ..., {{lang|ar|\u063a}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ghayn}}'' = 1000. This is sometimes used to produce [[chronogram]]s.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Arabic alphabet}}\n[[File:Arabic script evolution.svg|thumb|250px|Evolution of early [[Islamic calligraphy|Arabic calligraphy]] (9th\u201311th century). The ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Basmala]]}}'' is taken as an example, from [[Kufic]] ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Qur\u2019\u0101n]]}}'' manuscripts. (1) Early 9th century script used no dots or [[diacritic]] marks;<ref>[[commons:File:Basmala kufi.svg|File:Basmala kufi.svg - Wikimedia Commons]]</ref> (2) and (3) in the 9th\u201310th century during the Abbasid dynasty, [[Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali|Abu al-Aswad]]'s system used red dots with each arrangement or position indicating a different short vowel. Later, a second system of black dots was used to differentiate between letters like ''{{transl|ar|ALA|f\u0101\u2019}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|q\u0101f}}'';<ref name=\"wikimedia1\">[[commons:File:Kufi.jpg|File:Kufi.jpg - Wikimedia Commons]]</ref><ref name=\"wikimedia1\"/> (4) in the 11th century ([[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi|al-Far\u0101h\u012bd\u012b]]'s system) dots were changed into shapes resembling the letters to transcribe the corresponding long vowels. This system is the one used today.<ref>[[commons:File:Qur'an folio 11th century kufic.jpg|File:Qur'an folio 11th century kufic.jpg - Wikimedia Commons]]</ref>]]\nThe Arabic alphabet can be traced back to the [[Nabataean alphabet]] used to write [[Nabataean]]. The first known text in the Arabic alphabet is a late 4th-century inscription from ''{{transl|ar|[[Jabal Ramm]]}}'' (50&nbsp;km east of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Aqaba|\u2018Aqabah]]}}'') in [[Jordan]], but the first dated one is a trilingual inscription at [[Zebed]] in [[Syria]] from 512.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} However, the [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] record is extremely sparse, with only five certainly [[pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions]] surviving, though some others may be pre-Islamic. Later, dots were added above and below the letters to differentiate them. (The Aramaic language had fewer phonemes than the Arabic, and some originally distinct Aramaic letters had become indistinguishable in shape, so that in the early writings 15 distinct letter-shapes had to do duty for 28 sounds; cf. the similarly ambiguous [[Book Pahlavi|Pahlavi]] alphabet.) The first surviving document that definitely uses these dots is also the first surviving Arabic [[papyrus]] ([[PERF 558]]), dated April 643, although they did not become obligatory until much later. Important texts were and still are frequently memorized, especially in [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|Qur\u02bean memorization]].\n\nLater still, vowel marks and the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}'' were introduced, beginning some time in the latter half of the 7th century, preceding the first invention of [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]] and [[Tiberian vocalization|Hebrew vocalization]]. Initially, this was done by a system of red dots, said to have been commissioned in the [[Umayyad caliphate|Umayyad]] era by [[Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali]] a dot above = ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a}}'', a dot below = ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}'', a dot on the line = ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'', and doubled dots indicated [[nunation]]. However, this was cumbersome and easily confusable with the letter-distinguishing dots, so about 100 years later, the modern system was adopted. The system was finalized around 786 by ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[al-Farahidi|al-Far\u0101h\u012bd\u012b]]}}''.\n\n=== Arabic printing presses ===\nAlthough [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] generally receives credit for introducing the printing press to [[Egypt]] during his invasion of that country in 1798, and though he did indeed bring printing presses and [[Arabic script]] presses to print the French occupation's official newspaper ''Al-Tanbiyyah'' (\"The Courier\"), printing in the Arabic language started several centuries earlier.\n\nIn 1514, following [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s invention of the printing press in 1450, Gregorio de Gregorii, a Venetian, published an entire prayer-book in Arabic script; it was entitled ''[[Kitab salat al-sawai|Kitab Salat al-Sawa'i]]'' and was intended for eastern Christian communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.viverefano.com/2014/11/19/294-anniversario-della-biblioteca-federiciana-ricerche-e-curiosit-sul-kitab-salat-al-sawai/504874/|title=294\u00b0 anniversario della Biblioteca Federiciana: ricerche e curiosit\u00e0 sul Kitab Salat al-Sawai|access-date=2017-01-31}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1580 and 1586, type designer [[Robert Granjon]] designed Arabic typefaces for Cardinal [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando de' Medici]], and the [[Medici Oriental Press|Medici press]] published many Christian prayer and scholarly Arabic texts in the late 16th century.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xu2y8w_o2sQC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=Robert+Granjon+designed+Arabic+typefaces&source=bl&ots=yaY_spZf0n&sig=ACfU3U0Hql1-4FJkIlaLNjavA6qNgWECpA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiDrYu41rPhAhVuThUIHRi4B3w4ChDoATAGegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=Robert%20Granjon%20designed%20Arabic%20typefaces&f=false|title=Design and Structure of Arabic Script|last=Naghashian|first=Naghi|date=2013-01-21|publisher=epubli|isbn=9783844245059|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Maronite]] monks at the Maar Quzhayy Monastery in [[Mount Lebanon]] published the first Arabic books to use movable type in the Middle East. The monks transliterated the Arabic language using [[Syriac language|Syriac]] script.\n\nA goldsmith (like Gutenberg) designed and implemented an Arabic-script movable-type printing-press in the Middle East. The [[Greek Orthodox]] monk [[Abd Allah Zakhir]] set up an [[Arabic]] [[printing press]] using [[movable type]] at the monastery of Saint John at the town of [[Dhour El Shuwayr]] in Mount Lebanon, the first homemade press in Lebanon using Arabic script. He personally cut the type molds and did the founding of the typeface. The first book came off his press in 1734; this press continued in use until 1899.<ref>\n[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198102/arabic.and.the.art.of.printing-a.special.section.htm Arabic and the Art of Printing \u2013 A Special Section] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229133008/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198102/arabic.and.the.art.of.printing-a.special.section.htm |date=29 December 2006 }}, by Paul Lunde\n</ref>\n\n== Computers ==\nThe Arabic alphabet can be encoded using several [[character set]]s, including [[ISO-8859-6]], [[Windows-1256]] and [[Unicode]] (see links in Infobox above), latter thanks to the \"Arabic segment\", entries U+0600 to U+06FF. However, none of the sets indicates the form that each character should take in context. It is left to the [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering engine]] to select the proper [[glyph]] to display for each character.\n\nEach letter has a position-independent encoding in [[Unicode]], and the rendering software can infer the correct glyph form (initial, medial, final or isolated) from its joining context. That is the current recommendation. However, for compatibility with previous standards, the initial, medial, final and isolated forms can also be encoded separately.\n\n===Unicode===\n{{Main|Arabic characters in Unicode}}\nAs of [[Unicode]] 13.0, the [[Arabic script]] is contained in the following [[Unicode block|blocks]]:<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Scripts.txt | work=Unicode Character Database | title=UAX #24: Script data file | publisher=The Unicode Consortium}}</ref>\n* [[Arabic (Unicode block)|Arabic]] (0600\u201306FF, 255 characters)\n* [[Arabic Supplement]] (0750\u2013077F, 48 characters)\n* [[Arabic Extended-A]] (08A0\u201308FF, 84 characters)\n* [[Arabic Presentation Forms-A]] (FB50\u2013FDFF, 611 characters)\n* [[Arabic Presentation Forms-B]] (FE70\u2013FEFF, 141 characters)\n* [[Rumi Numeral Symbols]] (10E60\u201310E7F, 31 characters)\n* [[Indic Siyaq Numbers (Unicode block)|Indic Siyaq Numbers]] (1EC70\u20131ECBF, 68 characters)\n* [[Ottoman Siyaq Numbers (Unicode block)|Ottoman Siyaq Numbers]] (1ED00\u20131ED4F, 61 characters)\n* [[Arabic Mathematical Alphabetic Symbols]] (1EE00\u20141EEFF, 143 characters)\n\nThe basic Arabic range encodes the standard letters and diacritics but does not encode contextual forms (U+0621-U+0652 being directly based on [[ISO 8859-6]]). It also includes the most common diacritics and [[Arabic-Indic digits]]. U+06D6 to U+06ED encode Qur'anic annotation signs such as \"end of ''[[ayah]]''\" \u06dd\u06d6 and \"start of ''[[Rub El Hizb|rub el hizb]]''\" \u06de. The Arabic supplement range encodes letter variants mostly used for writing African (non-Arabic) languages. The Arabic Extended-A range encodes additional Qur'anic annotations and letter variants used for various non-Arabic languages.\n\nThe Arabic Presentation Forms-A range encodes contextual forms and ligatures of letter variants needed for Persian, Urdu, Sindhi and Central Asian languages. The Arabic Presentation Forms-B range encodes spacing forms of Arabic diacritics, and more contextual letter forms. The Arabic Mathematical Alphabetical Symbols block encodes characters used in Arabic mathematical expressions.\n\nSee also the notes of the section on [[#Modified letters|modified letters]].\n\n===Keyboards===\n{{see also|Keyboard layout|Arabic keyboard}}\n[[File:KB Arabic MAC.svg|thumb|450px|Arabic Mac keyboard layout]]\n[[File:KB Arabic.svg|thumb|450px|Arabic PC keyboard layout]]\n[[File:Intellark4qwerty.png|thumb|450px|[[Intellark]] imposed on a QWERTY keyboard layout.]]\n\nKeyboards designed for different nations have different layouts so proficiency in one style of keyboard, such as Iraq's, does not transfer to proficiency in another, such as Saudi Arabia's. Differences can include the location of non-alphabetic characters.\n\nAll Arabic keyboards allow typing Roman characters, e.g., for the URL in a [[web browser]]. Thus, each Arabic keyboard has both Arabic and Roman characters marked on the keys. Usually the Roman characters of an Arabic keyboard conform to the [[QWERTY]] layout, but in [[North Africa]], where [[French language|French]] is the most common language typed using the Roman characters, the Arabic keyboards are [[AZERTY]].\n\nTo encode a particular written form of a character, there are extra code points provided in Unicode which can be used to express the exact written form desired. The range ''Arabic presentation forms A'' (U+FB50 to U+FDFF) contain ligatures while the range ''Arabic presentation forms B'' (U+FE70 to U+FEFF) contains the positional variants. These effects are better achieved in Unicode by using the ''[[zero-width joiner]]'' and ''[[zero-width non-joiner|non-joiner]]'', as these presentation forms are deprecated in Unicode, and should generally only be used within the internals of text-rendering software, when using Unicode as an intermediate form for conversion between character encodings, or for backwards compatibility with implementations that rely on the hard-coding of glyph forms.\n\nFinally, the Unicode encoding of Arabic is in ''logical order'', that is, the characters are entered, and stored in computer memory, in the order that they are written and pronounced without worrying about the direction in which they will be displayed on paper or on the screen. Again, it is left to the rendering engine to present the characters in the correct direction, using Unicode's [[bi-directional text]] features. In this regard, if the Arabic words on this page are written left to right, it is an indication that the Unicode rendering engine used to display them is out of date.<ref>For more information about encoding Arabic, consult the Unicode manual available at [https://www.unicode.org/ The Unicode website]</ref><ref>See also [https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/mideast/Multilingual_Computing_with_Arabic_and_Arabic_Transliteration.pdf Multilingual Computing with Arabic and Arabic Transliteration: Arabicizing Windows Applications to Read and Write Arabic & Solutions for the Transliteration Quagmire Faced by Arabic-Script Languages] and [https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/mideast/multilingual_computing_arabic.ppt A PowerPoint Tutorial (with screen shots and an English voice-over) on how to add Arabic to the Windows Operating System]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911024303/https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/mideast/Multilingual_Computing_with_Arabic_and_Arabic_Transliteration.pdf |date=11 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThere are competing online tools, e.g. [http://www.yamli.com/editor/ Yamli editor], which allow entry of Arabic letters without having Arabic support installed on a PC, and without knowledge of the layout of the Arabic keyboard.<ref>[http://www.yamli.com/press/ Yamli in the News]</ref>\n\n===Handwriting recognition===\nThe first software program of its kind in the world that identifies Arabic handwriting in real time was developed by researchers at [[Ben-Gurion University]] (BGU).\n\nThe prototype enables the user to write Arabic words by hand on an electronic screen, which then analyzes the text and translates it into printed Arabic letters in a thousandth of a second.
