A [[spiritual successor]] to FromSoftware's ''[[Demon's Souls]]'', the game is the second instalment in the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series. ''Dark Souls'' takes place in the fictional kingdom of Lordran, where players assume the role of a cursed undead character who begins a [[pilgrimage]] to discover the fate of their kind. A port for [[Microsoft Windows]] was released in August 2012, which featured additional content not seen in the original [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] versions. In October 2012, the new content was made [[downloadable content|downloadable]] for consoles, under the subtitle ''[[Artorias of the Abyss]]''.\n\n''Dark Souls'' received critical acclaim, with many citing it as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. Critics praising the depth of its combat, intricate [[level design]], and use of [[flavor text]]. However, the game's difficulty received mixed reviews, with some criticizing it for being too unforgiving. The original Windows version of the game was less well-received, with criticism directed at numerous technical issues. By April 2013, the game had sold over two million copies worldwide. The game saw two sequels released in the mid-2010s, while a remastered version, ''[[#Dark Souls: Remastered|Dark Souls: Remastered]]'', was released in 2018.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Dark Souls'' is a third-person [[action role-playing game]]. A core mechanic of the game is exploration. Players are encouraged by the game to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find alternative areas to explore. ''Dark Souls'' takes place in a large and continuous [[open world]] environment, connected through a central hub area (Firelink Shrine). The [[player character]] can travel between areas and explore various paths at will, although prerequisites have to be met to unlock certain areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/03/dark-souls-review-brick-walls-and-pancakes/ |title=Dark Souls review: Brick walls and pancakes |work=Engadget |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Richard |last=Mitchell}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review |title=Dark Souls Review |work=IGN |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/dark_souls/b/ps3/archive/2011/10/03/dark-souls-review-dead-and-loving-it.aspx |title=Dark Souls Review: Dead And Loving It |work=GameInformer.com |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Phil |last=Kollar}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.gamerevolution.com/review/dark-souls |title=Dark Souls Review |work=Game Revolution |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Daniel |last=Bischoff |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825175549/http://m.gamerevolution.com/review/dark-souls |archive-date=August 25, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nA central element to the gameplay of ''Dark Souls'' is the [[Bonfire (Dark Souls)|bonfire]]. Bonfires are scattered throughout the world and serve as checkpoints for each level. By resting at a bonfire, the player character is healed to full and regains all of the healing charges of their \"Estus Flask.\" They can also [[Level up (video gaming)|level up]] and perform other functions, such as attuning magic, and repairing and upgrading equipment. However, resting at a bonfire [[respawn]]s all of the world's enemies, except for bosses and friendly non-playable characters.\n[[File:Darksoulsbattle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[player character]] (right) battles Artorias, one of the bosses added to the game through the ''Artorias of the Abyss'' [[downloadable content]] expansion]]\n\nThe player character's interaction with the world of ''Dark Souls'' includes a great deal of combat. Combat includes [[Melee (gaming)|melee]] attacks, various forms of defensive maneuvering, and magical abilities. For melee attacks, player characters have access to a wide array of [[high fantasy]], [[Middle Ages|medieval]]-style weaponry\u2014including [[sword]]s, [[spear]]s, [[Mace (bludgeon)|maces]], and more\u2014as well as imaginary, fantastical weaponry\u2014including magical swords, humongous greatswords, and immense clubs. For defense, player characters have access to [[shield]]s, [[Armour|armor]], dodge rolling, and [[Parry (fencing)|parrying]]. For magic, which includes a wide variety of offensive and defensive abilities known as sorceries, miracles, and pyromancies, player characters do not use any form of [[Magic (gaming)|mana]] as in most other fantasy RPGs - instead, they gain a discrete number of uses for each attuned spell when resting at a bonfire. These various forms of combat all have tradeoffs, variations, and in-game costs associated with them; and they can all be buffed or altered in some fashion through leveling, [[Metalsmith|smithing]], consumable items, magical rings, and new equipment.\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\nAnother aspect of ''Dark Souls'' is the \"humanity\" system. There are two forms the player character can be in during the game, human form or hollow form. Whenever the player character dies in human form, they are returned to hollow form and can only have their humanity restored by consuming an item. The player character must be in human form to summon other players. While in human form, however, the player may be subjected to invasions by other players and [[non-player character]]s (NPC) who seek to kill the player to restore their humanity, harvest souls, or achieve some other goal. Humanity can be acquired in many ways, and if no humanity is available, players are still able to progress in hollow form.\n\nDeath (whether in human or hollow form) results in the loss of all carried souls and humanity, but players revive as hollows at their most recent bonfire with one chance at returning to where they died to recover all lost souls and humanity. If the player dies before reaching their \"bloodstain,\" the souls and humanity they previously accrued are permanently lost.\n\nCommunication and interaction between players are deliberately restricted. Outside of five stock phrases (which can only be used after acquiring Gough's carvings in the game's DLC) and character gestures, the only other communication players have with one another comes by way of orange [[soapstone]]s, which allow players to write limited messages that can be read by others in the same area. Also, players can enter [[cooperative]] or [[player versus player]] combat with each other.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/how-dark-souls-pvp-keeping-game-alive/|title=The rituals, strategies, honour and etiquette that keep Dark Souls PvP alive|last=Ahmed|first=Sayem|date=August 26, 2015|work=Future Publishing Limited Quay House|access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dark-souls/news/master-online-play-vaativiyda|title=Master Online play|last=Entertainment|first=Bandai|date=June 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the game, there are multiple NPCs that the player may encounter on their journey. These characters add to the plot of the game but are not essential. If the player does choose to engage with them, some of the characters can assist the player by being able to be summoned for certain boss fights when the player character is in human form.\n\n== Plot ==\n''Dark Souls'' employs minimalist storytelling to convey its plot and lore. Historical events in its world and their significance are often implicit or left to player interpretation rather than being fully shown or explained. Most of the story is given to the player through dialogue from [[non-player character]]s within the game, [[flavor text]] from items, and world design.\n\nThe opening cutscene establishes the premise of the game. Dragons once ruled the world during the \"Age of Ancients.\" A primordial fire known as the First Flame manifests in the world, establishing a distinction between life and death, as well as light and dark. Four beings find \"Lord Souls\" near the First Flame, granting immense power: Gwyn the Lord of Sunlight, Nito the First of the Dead, the Witch of Izalith, and the Furtive Pygmy. Gwyn, Nito, and the Witch use their new power to destroy the dragons and take control over the world, while the Furtive Pygmy is said to be forgotten, and this begins the \"Age of Fire.\" Over time, the First Flame begins to fade while humans rise in power, and Gwyn sacrifices himself to prolong the Age of Fire. The main story takes place towards the end of this second Age of Fire, at which point humanity is said to be afflicted with an undead curse, related to a symbol on their bodies known as the Darksign. Those humans afflicted with the undead curse perpetually resurrect after death, until they eventually lose their minds, a process referred to as \"hollowing.\"\n\nThe player character is a cursed undead, locked away in an undead asylum. After escaping the asylum, the player travels to Lordran to ring the Bells of Awakening. The bells awaken Kingseeker Frampt, who tells the player to ascend to Anor Londo, the home of the Gods. In Anor Londo, Gwynevere instructs the player to succeed Lord Gwyn and fulfill the prophecy. To accomplish this, the player must aquire the Lord Souls of the Witch of Izalith, Nito, the Four Kings, and Seath the Scaleless. Optionally, the player may encounter Darkstalker Kaathe who encourages the player not to link the fire but to let it die out and usher in the Age of Dark instead. Once the player acquires the Lord Souls, they travel to the Kiln of the First Flame to battle Gwyn. Once Gwyn has been defeated, the player has the choice of linking the flame to preserve the Age of Fire, or letting it die out to instigate the Age of Dark.\n\n=== ''Artorias of the Abyss'' ===\n{{main|Dark Souls: Artorias of the Abyss}}\nIn the ''Artorias of the Abyss'' expansion, the player is dragged into the past by the Manus, Father of the Abyss to the land to Oolacile, which is being corrupted by Manus after the people awoke and angered him. Artorias, one of Lord Gwyn's four knights goes to defeat Manus and rescue the Princess Dusk. Artorias is defeated and corrupted by the abyss, however, and the player must defeat him. The player than goes on to defeat Manus, although the victory is attributed to Artorias later, creating a paradox.\n\n== Development ==\n''Dark Souls'' was developed by [[FromSoftware]], with series creator [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]] directing and producing. ''Dark Souls'' is a [[spiritual successor]] to FromSoftware's [[cult classic]] previous game, ''[[Demon's Souls]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.giantbomb.com/souls/3025-2169/|title=Souls - Overview|website=Giant Bomb|access-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref> (which was, in turn, a spiritual successor to From's earlier ''[[King's Field]]'' series<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/games/demons_souls/b/ps3/archive/2009/11/05/feature-demon-s-souls-director-discusses-difficulty-sequels-and-more.aspx|title=Demon\u2019s Souls Director Discusses Difficulty, Sequels, And More|last=Kollar|first=Phil|date=November 5, 2009|website=gameinformer|access-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref>). However, ''Demon's Souls'' was published by Sony and ''Dark Souls'' by [[Bandai Namco Entertainment|Bandai Namco]]; this transfer meant that intellectual property rights prevented FromSoftware from making a sequel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2013/6/13/4424550/demons-souls-2-shuhei-yoshida-e3|title=Sony studios head wants to see more Demon's Souls|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|date=June 13, 2013|website=Polygon|access-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"lee et al\">{{cite journal | title = Relationships among video games: Existing standards and new definitions | author = Jin Ha Lee |first2=Rachel Ivy |last2=Clarke |first3=Simone |last3=Sacchi |first4=Jacob |last4=Jett | journal = Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | year = 2014 | pages = 1\u201311 | doi = 10.1002/meet.2014.14505101035 }}</ref> After two years of development, ''Dark Souls'' was released with its numerous similarities (such as the gameplay, online multiplayer, and plot presentation) and differences (such as a connected world and new characters in a distinct universe and storyline) from its predecessor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cgmagonline.com/2016/05/30/dark-souls-history-bloodborne-fromsoftware-ps4-playstation-pc/|title=Prepare To Die: A Brief History Of The Souls Series|last=Gilyadov|first=Aleksander|date=May 30, 2016|website=CGMagazine|access-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe design and development process itself involved a guided freeform approach, with Miyazaki steering designers while allowing them latitude for creativity:<blockquote>The design ordering process for ''Dark Souls'' can be divided into two main categories. The first involves providing the designers with simple keywords we brainstormed during the early stages of project development and allowing them to design freely. We take the images they produce and provide feedback, make adjustments as necessary, or incorporate their ideas into our plans. [...] The second process comes into play once we've settled on the basic details of the game world. At that point we are able to make more detailed design requests. These requests usually include information like how the design will be used, where in the game the design will be used, and the specific purpose of the design in terms of what it will represent in the game. [...] Either way, I am the one who hands out the orders and I work directly with each designer instead of having a middleman between us.<ref name=\"otsuka\" /></blockquote>\n{{Multiple image\n| perrow = 2\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = right\n| total_width = 400\n| footer = Game director and producer [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]] modeled various places in the game after real-world locations, such the main building in [[Anor Londo]] being based on the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord]] (''left'') and [[Milan Cathedral]] (''right'').\n| image1 = Escalier double helice Chambord.jpg\n| image2 = Milan_Cathedral_from_Piazza_del_Duomo.jpg\n}}\n\nMiyazaki stated that the game draws direct inspiration from earlier works of fantasy and dark fantasy, especially the manga series ''[[Berserk (manga)|Berserk]]''.<ref name=\"otsuka\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Dark Souls 3: Das komplette Gamescom-Interview mit Sch\u00f6pfer Hidetaka Miyazaki |url=https://www.pcgames.de/Dark-Souls-3-Spiel-55615/Specials/Hidetaka-Miyazaki-im-Gamescom-Interview-1167759/ |website=[[PC Games (magazine)|PC Games]] |accessdate=June 22, 2019 |language=de |date=August 12, 2015}}</ref> He has described the driving aesthetic principal of the game as being \"a certain kind of refinement, elegance, and dignity\".<ref name=\"otsuka\" /> He also described the themes which guided the design of the game in the following way: \"I put three major guidelines in place: Gods and knights centered around Anor Londo, demonic chaos and flames centered around Lost Izalith, and the theme of death centered around Gravelord Nito.

A [[spiritual successor]] to FromSoftware's ''[[Demon's Souls]]'', the game is the second instalment in the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series. ''Dark Souls'' takes place in the fictional kingdom of Lordran, where players assume the role of a cursed undead character who begins a [[pilgrimage]] to discover the fate of their kind. A port for [[Microsoft Windows]] was released in August 2012, which featured additional content not seen in the original [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] versions. In October 2012, the new content was made [[downloadable content|downloadable]] for consoles, under the subtitle ''[[Artorias of the Abyss]]''.\n\n''Dark Souls'' received critical acclaim, with many citing it as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. Critics praising the depth of its combat, intricate [[level design]], and use of [[flavor text]]. However, the game's difficulty received mixed reviews, with some criticizing it for being too unforgiving. The original Windows version of the game was less well-received, with criticism directed at numerous technical issues. By April 2013, the game had sold over two million copies worldwide. The game saw two sequels released in the mid-2010s, while a remastered version, ''[[#Dark Souls: Remastered|Dark Souls: Remastered]]'', was released in 2018.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Dark Souls'' is a third-person [[action role-playing game]]. A core mechanic of the game is exploration. Players are encouraged by the game to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find alternative areas to explore. ''Dark Souls'' takes place in a large and continuous [[open world]] environment, connected through a central hub area (Firelink Shrine). The [[player character]] can travel between areas and explore various paths at will, although prerequisites have to be met to unlock certain areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/03/dark-souls-review-brick-walls-and-pancakes/ |title=Dark Souls review: Brick walls and pancakes |work=Engadget |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Richard |last=Mitchell}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review |title=Dark Souls Review |work=IGN |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/dark_souls/b/ps3/archive/2011/10/03/dark-souls-review-dead-and-loving-it.aspx |title=Dark Souls Review: Dead And Loving It |work=GameInformer.com |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Phil |last=Kollar}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.gamerevolution.com/review/dark-souls |title=Dark Souls Review |work=Game Revolution |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Daniel |last=Bischoff |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825175549/http://m.gamerevolution.com/review/dark-souls |archive-date=August 25, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nA central element to the gameplay of ''Dark Souls'' is the [[Bonfire (Dark Souls)|bonfire]]. Bonfires are scattered throughout the world and serve as checkpoints for each level. By resting at a bonfire, the player character is healed to full and regains all of the healing charges of their \"Estus Flask.\" They can also [[Level up (video gaming)|level up]] and perform other functions, such as attuning magic, and repairing and upgrading equipment. However, resting at a bonfire [[respawn]]s all of the world's enemies, except for bosses and friendly non-playable characters.\n[[File:Darksoulsbattle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[player character]] (right) battles Artorias, one of the bosses added to the game through the ''Artorias of the Abyss'' [[downloadable content]] expansion]]\n\nThe player character's interaction with the world of ''Dark Souls'' includes a great deal of combat. Combat includes [[Melee (gaming)|melee]] attacks, various forms of defensive maneuvering, and magical abilities. For melee attacks, player characters have access to a wide array of [[high fantasy]], [[Middle Ages|medieval]]-style weaponry\u2014including [[sword]]s, [[spear]]s, [[Mace (bludgeon)|maces]], and more\u2014as well as imaginary, fantastical weaponry\u2014including magical swords, humongous greatswords, and immense clubs. For defense, player characters have access to [[shield]]s, [[Armour|armor]], dodge rolling, and [[Parry (fencing)|parrying]]. For magic, which includes a wide variety of offensive and defensive abilities known as sorceries, miracles, and pyromancies, player characters do not use any form of [[Magic (gaming)|mana]] as in most other fantasy RPGs - instead, they gain a discrete number of uses for each attuned spell when resting at a bonfire. These various forms of combat all have tradeoffs, variations, and in-game costs associated with them; and they can all be buffed or altered in some fashion through leveling, [[Metalsmith|smithing]], consumable items, magical rings, and new equipment.\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\nAnother aspect of ''Dark Souls'' is the \"humanity\" system. There are two forms the player character can be in during the game, human form or hollow form. Whenever the player character dies in human form, they are returned to hollow form and can only have their humanity restored by consuming an item. The player character must be in human form to summon other players. While in human form, however, the player may be subjected to invasions by other players and [[non-player character]]s (NPC) who seek to kill the player to restore their humanity, harvest souls, or achieve some other goal. Humanity can be acquired in many ways, and if no humanity is available, players are still able to progress in hollow form.\n\nDeath (whether in human or hollow form) results in the loss of all carried souls and humanity, but players revive as hollows at their most recent bonfire with one chance at returning to where they died to recover all lost souls and humanity. If the player dies before reaching their \"bloodstain,\" the souls and humanity they previously accrued are permanently lost.\n\nCommunication and interaction between players are deliberately restricted. Outside of five stock phrases (which can only be used after acquiring Gough's carvings in the game's DLC) and character gestures, the only other communication players have with one another comes by way of orange [[soapstone]]s, which allow players to write limited messages that can be read by others in the same area. Also, players can enter [[cooperative]] or [[player versus player]] combat with each other.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/how-dark-souls-pvp-keeping-game-alive/|title=The rituals, strategies, honour and etiquette that keep Dark Souls PvP alive|last=Ahmed|first=Sayem|date=August 26, 2015|work=Future Publishing Limited Quay House|access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dark-souls/news/master-online-play-vaativiyda|title=Master Online play|last=Entertainment|first=Bandai|date=June 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the game, there are multiple NPCs that the player may encounter on their journey. These characters add to the plot of the game but are not essential. If the player does choose to engage with them, some of the characters can assist the player by being able to be summoned for certain boss fights when the player character is in human form.\n\n== Plot ==\n''Dark Souls'' employs minimalist storytelling to convey its plot and lore. Historical events in its world and their significance are often implicit or left to player interpretation rather than being fully shown or explained. Most of the story is given to the player through dialogue from [[non-player character]]s within the game, [[flavor text]] from items, and world design.\n\nThe opening cutscene establishes the premise of the game. Dragons once ruled the world during the \"Age of Ancients.\" A primordial fire known as the First Flame manifests in the world, establishing a distinction between life and death, as well as light and dark. Four beings find \"Lord Souls\" near the First Flame, granting immense power: Gwyn the Lord of Sunlight, Nito the First of the Dead, the Witch of Izalith, and the Furtive Pygmy. Gwyn, Nito, and the Witch use their new power to destroy the dragons and take control over the world, while the Furtive Pygmy is said to be forgotten, and this begins the \"Age of Fire.\" Over time, the First Flame begins to fade while humans rise in power, and Gwyn sacrifices himself to prolong the Age of Fire. The main story takes place towards the end of this second Age of Fire, at which point humanity is said to be afflicted with an undead curse, related to a symbol on their bodies known as the Darksign. Those humans afflicted with the undead curse perpetually resurrect after death, until they eventually lose their minds, a process referred to as \"hollowing.\"\n\nThe player character is a cursed undead, locked away in an undead asylum. After escaping the asylum, the player travels to Lordran to ring the Bells of Awakening. The bells awaken Kingseeker Frampt, who tells the player to ascend to Anor Londo, the home of the Gods. In Anor Londo, Gwynevere instructs the player to succeed Lord Gwyn and fulfill the prophecy. To accomplish this, the player must aquire the Lord Souls of the Witch of Izalith, Nito, the Four Kings, and Seath the Scaleless. Optionally, the player may encounter Darkstalker Kaathe who encourages the player not to link the fire but to let it die out and usher in the Age of Dark instead. Once the player acquires the Lord Souls, they travel to the Kiln of the First Flame to battle Gwyn. Once Gwyn has been defeated, the player has the choice of linking the flame to preserve the Age of Fire, or letting it die out to instigate the Age of Dark.\n\n=== ''Artorias of the Abyss'' ===\n{{main|Dark Souls: Artorias of the Abyss}}\nIn the ''Artorias of the Abyss'' expansion, the player is dragged into the past by the Manus, Father of the Abyss to the land to Oolacile, which is being corrupted by Manus after the people awoke and angered him. Artorias, one of Lord Gwyn's four knights goes to defeat Manus and rescue the Princess Dusk. Artorias is defeated and corrupted by the abyss, however, and the player must defeat him. The player than goes on to defeat Manus, although the victory is attributed to Artorias later, creating a paradox.\n\n== Development ==\n''Dark Souls'' was developed by [[FromSoftware]], with series creator [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]] directing and producing. ''Dark Souls'' is a [[spiritual successor]] to FromSoftware's [[cult classic]] previous game, ''[[Demon's Souls]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.giantbomb.com/souls/3025-2169/|title=Souls - Overview|website=Giant Bomb|access-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref> (which was, in turn, a spiritual successor to From's earlier ''[[King's Field]]'' series<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/games/demons_souls/b/ps3/archive/2009/11/05/feature-demon-s-souls-director-discusses-difficulty-sequels-and-more.aspx|title=Demon\u2019s Souls Director Discusses Difficulty, Sequels, And More|last=Kollar|first=Phil|date=November 5, 2009|website=gameinformer|access-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref>).

The first involves providing the designers with simple keywords we brainstormed during the early stages of project development and allowing them to design freely. We take the images they produce and provide feedback, make adjustments as necessary, or incorporate their ideas into our plans. [...] The second process comes into play once we've settled on the basic details of the game world. At that point we are able to make more detailed design requests. These requests usually include information like how the design will be used, where in the game the design will be used, and the specific purpose of the design in terms of what it will represent in the game. [...] Either way, I am the one who hands out the orders and I work directly with each designer instead of having a middleman between us.<ref name=\"otsuka\" /></blockquote>\n{{Multiple image\n| perrow = 2\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = right\n| total_width = 400\n| footer = Game director and producer [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]] modeled various places in the game after real-world locations, such the main building in [[Anor Londo]] being based on the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord]] (''left'') and [[Milan Cathedral]] (''right'').\n| image1 = Escalier double helice Chambord.jpg\n| image2 = Milan_Cathedral_from_Piazza_del_Duomo.jpg\n}}\n\nMiyazaki stated that the game draws direct inspiration from earlier works of fantasy and dark fantasy, especially the manga series ''[[Berserk (manga)|Berserk]]''.<ref name=\"otsuka\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Dark Souls 3: Das komplette Gamescom-Interview mit Sch\u00f6pfer Hidetaka Miyazaki |url=https://www.pcgames.de/Dark-Souls-3-Spiel-55615/Specials/Hidetaka-Miyazaki-im-Gamescom-Interview-1167759/ |website=[[PC Games (magazine)|PC Games]] |accessdate=June 22, 2019 |language=de |date=August 12, 2015}}</ref> He has described the driving aesthetic principal of the game as being \"a certain kind of refinement, elegance, and dignity\".<ref name=\"otsuka\" /> He also described the themes which guided the design of the game in the following way: \"I put three major guidelines in place: Gods and knights centered around Anor Londo, demonic chaos and flames centered around Lost Izalith, and the theme of death centered around Gravelord Nito.
