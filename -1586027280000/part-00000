As a result, Ireland, in a report titled \"Policy Consideration for Renewable Electricity to 2010\", made the commitment to have 4% of its total energy consumption come from renewable energy resources by 2002 and 13.2% by 2010. The Department of Communications Marine and Natural Resources (DCMNR) founded the Renewable Energy Group (REG) which established the short term analysis group (STAG) to investigate a means of accomplishing this goal. To meet the 2010 target of 13.2%, 1,432&nbsp;MW of electricity will need to be generated from renewable resources with 1,100&nbsp;MW being generated from wind resources both onshore and offshore.\n\n== State financial support ==\nState financial support for the national electricity sector, and particular technologies, has been influenced by a slow move towards liberalisation, and concerns for energy security and climate change mitigation.<ref name=\":1\" /> Ireland uses an industry [[subsidy]] known as the [[Public Service Obligation]] (PSO) to support the generation of electricity from sustainable, renewable and indigenous sources, including wind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cer.ie/docs/001034/CER15142%20PSO%20Levy%202015-16%20%20Decision%20Paper.pdf|title=PUBLIC SERVICE OBLIGATION LEVY 2015/2016|website=Cer.ie|accessdate=2017-01-15}}</ref> The PSO levy is charged to all electricity customers. As of April 2020, for residential consumers, the current PSO levy is \u20ac38.68 per year inclusive of VAT, and is displayed on the typical two-monthly electricity bill as \u20ac5.68 (\u20ac2.84 x 2) + 13.5% VAT.\n\nThe PSO levy funds the government\u2019s main mechanisms to support the generation of electricity from sustainable, renewable and indigenous sources. These mechanisms have shifted from the initial use of competitive auctions in the late 1990s, to a [[Feed-in tariff|Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff]] (REFiT) from 2006 to 2015, and back to a new renewable energy auction scheme as of 2020. Ireland\u2019s initial use of competitive auction from 1996 failed to support the intended growth in wind development. Between 2006 and 2015, the government supported a REFiT, secured for 15 years. The 2020 REFiT reference price for large wind (>5MW) is \u20ac70.98 /MWh and for small wind (<5MW) is \u20ac73.47/MWh.

When costs of electricity suppliers exceed market revenues a Support Payment will be due to the supplier, and when market revenues exceed costs a Difference Payment will be due from the supplier.

The development of the site was originally divided into two phases with the first phase being the current installation of 7&nbsp;turbines. The second phase was a partnership between Airtricity and [[Acciona Energy]]. Acciona Energy had an option to buy the project after the facility is completed. The wind farm was planned to expand to 520&nbsp;MW of power.

At present it is common to apply and obtain a 10-year permission for a wind energy development. Section 42 of the above Act originally permitted a 5-year extension of the \"appropriate period\" provided that substantial works were carried out. This caused major problems as the term \"substantial works\" was not clearly defined which resulted in a large variety in interpretation of what constituted substantial works among the various planning authorities. This issue was rectified by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 section 28 which inserted an additional paragraph allowing a once off extension not exceeding 5 years if \"there were considerations of a commercial, economic or technical nature beyond the control of the applicant which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works pursuant to the planning permission\"\n\nThe fourth issue regarding the generation of wind power is the Renewable Energy [[Feed-in Tariff]], or REFIT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iwea.com/index.cfm/action/downloadFile/twFId/44 |format=PDF |title=Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff |website=Iwea.com |accessdate=2017-01-15}}</ref> The purpose of REFIT is to encourage development of renewable energy resources.

Maps can also be located in a variety of locations on the walk for guidance around the wind farm and back to allocated car parks. The walk way also provides aesthetic scenery on a relatively flat landscape.

As a result, Ireland, in a report titled \"Policy Consideration for Renewable Electricity to 2010\", made the commitment to have 4% of its total energy consumption come from renewable energy resources by 2002 and 13.2% by 2010. The Department of Communications Marine and Natural Resources (DCMNR) founded the Renewable Energy Group (REG) which established the short term analysis group (STAG) to investigate a means of accomplishing this goal. To meet the 2010 target of 13.2%, 1,432&nbsp;MW of electricity will need to be generated from renewable resources with 1,100&nbsp;MW being generated from wind resources both onshore and offshore.\n\n== State financial support ==\nState financial support for the national electricity sector, and particular technologies, has been influenced by a slow move towards liberalisation, and concerns for energy security and climate change mitigation.<ref name=\":1\" /> Ireland uses an industry [[subsidy]] known as the [[Public Service Obligation]] (PSO) to support the generation of electricity from sustainable, renewable and indigenous sources, including wind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cer.ie/docs/001034/CER15142%20PSO%20Levy%202015-16%20%20Decision%20Paper.pdf|title=PUBLIC SERVICE OBLIGATION LEVY 2015/2016|website=Cer.ie|accessdate=2017-01-15}}</ref> The PSO levy is charged to all electricity customers. As of April 2020, for residential consumers, the current PSO levy is \u20ac38.68 per year inclusive of VAT, and is displayed on the typical two-monthly electricity bill as \u20ac5.68 (\u20ac2.84 x 2) + 13.5% VAT.\n\nThe PSO levy funds the government\u2019s main mechanisms to support the generation of electricity from sustainable, renewable and indigenous sources. These mechanisms have shifted from the initial use of competitive auctions in the late 1990\u2019s, to a [[Feed-in tariff|Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff]] (REFiT) from 2006 to 2015, and back to a new renewable energy auction scheme as of 2020. Ireland\u2019s initial use of competitive auction from 1996 failed to support the intended growth in wind development. Between 2006 and 2015, the government supported a REFiT, secured for 15 years. The 2020 REFiT reference price for large wind (>5MW) is \u20ac70.98 /MWh and for small wind (<5MW) is \u20ac73.47/MWh.

When costs of electricity suppliers exceed market revenues a Support Payment will be due to the supplier, and when market revenues exceed costs a Difference Payment will be due from the supplier. An economic analysis of the financial cost of different RESS options, estimated that a least cost auction with floating FIP mechanism would cost a domestic consumer \u20ac0.79 per per month by 2030 (at 2017 prices).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/energy/consultations/Documents/28/consultations/Economic%20Analysis%20to%20underpin%20the%20new%20RESS%20in%20Ireland.pdf|title=Economic Analysis to Underpin a New Renewable Electricity Support Scheme in Ireland|last=|first=|date=May 2017|website=Government of Ireland|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> This is significantly less than the current PSO levy rate to fund REFiT costs.\n\n==Offshore wind power==\n{{Main|Offshore wind power}}\nThe [[Arklow Bank Wind Park]], located 10&nbsp;km off the coast of [[Arklow]] on the Arklow Bank in the [[Irish Sea]], was Ireland's first offshore wind farm. The wind farm is owned and built by [[GE Energy]] and was co-developed by [[Airtricity]] and GE Energy. The site has 7&nbsp;GE Energy 3.6&nbsp;MW turbines that generate a total of 25&nbsp;MW. The development of the site was originally divided into two phases with the first phase being the current installation of 7&nbsp;turbines. The second phase was a partnership between Airtricity and [[Acciona Energy]]. Acciona Energy had an option to buy the project after the facility is completed. The wind farm was planned to expand to 520&nbsp;MW of power. However, in 2007, Phase 2 was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airtricity.com/assets/Uploads2/Press-Releases/Offshore-support-press-release1.pdf |title=Airtricity Welcomes Support for Offshore Wind Farm Development |website=Airtricity.com |accessdate=2017-01-15}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the waters off the Atlantic coastline of Ireland have higher winds, sites along the eastern coastline such as Arklow were chosen because of the shallower waters, which are 20 m deep or less.\n\nThe National Offshore Wind Association of Ireland (NOW Ireland) announced in April 2010 that 60,000&nbsp;potential jobs could be created in the Irish marine, construction, engineering and service industries through the development of offshore wind energy in Irish and European waters.

At present it is common to apply and obtain a 10-year permission for a wind energy development. Section 42 of the above Act originally permitted a 5-year extension of the \"appropriate period\" provided that substantial works were carried out. This caused major problems as the term \"substantial works\" was not clearly defined which resulted in a large variety in interpretation of what constituted substantial works among the various planning authorities. This issue was rectified by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 section 28 which inserted an additional paragraph allowing a once off extension not exceeding 5 years if \"there were considerations of a commercial, economic or technical nature beyond the control of the applicant which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works pursuant to the planning permission\"\n\nThe fourth issue regarding the generation of wind power is the Renewable Energy [[Feed-in Tariff]], or REFIT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iwea.com/index.cfm/action/downloadFile/twFId/44 |format=PDF |title=Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff |website=Iwea.com |accessdate=2017-01-15}}</ref> The purpose of REFIT is to encourage development of renewable energy resources.

The Bord na Mona wind farm in Mount Lucas, Daingean, Co.Offaly has provided a local walk way through the newly established wind farm that attracts people of all ages. The walk way provides a safe environment off-road for walking, running and cycling. The walk way is approximately nine kilometres in distance with numerous stop off points for breaks. Maps can also be located in a variety of locations on the walk for guidance around the wind farm and back to allocated car parks. The walk way also provides aesthetic scenery on a relatively flat landscape. Such a walk attracts many people year round and circulates money back into the local community as tourists stop off in local shops.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bordnamona.ie/company/our-businesses/powergen/bord-na-monas-wind-farms/ |title=Our Wind Farms |work=Bord na M\u00f3na|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Grid study in Ireland===\nAn Irish study of the grid indicates that it would be feasible to accommodate 42% (of demand) renewables\nin the electricity mix.<ref name='IrishPR'>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Press+Releases/2008/Study+shows+Ireland+can+be+world+leader+in+renewable+energy.htm |title=Study shows Ireland can be world leader in renewable energy |accessdate=2008-10-20 |date=January 2008 |work=Department of Communications, Energy and National Resources |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321220558/http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Press%2BReleases/2008/Study%2Bshows%2BIreland%2Bcan%2Bbe%2Bworld%2Bleader%2Bin%2Brenewable%2Benergy.htm |archivedate=21 March 2012 }}</ref>  This acceptable level of renewable penetration was found in what the study called Scenario 5, provided 47% of electrical capacity (different from demand) with the following mix of renewable energies:\n\n* 6,000 MW wind\n* 360 MW base load renewables\n* 285 MW additional variable renewables (other intermittent sources)\n\nThe study cautions that various assumptions were made that \"may have understated dispatch restrictions, resulting in an underestimation of operational costs, required wind curtailment, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions\" and that \"The limitations of the study may overstate the technical feasibility of the portfolios analyzed...\"\n\nScenario 6, which proposed renewables providing 59% of electrical capacity and 54% of demand had problems.

Each service travels a {{convert|4.4|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District.

It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].
