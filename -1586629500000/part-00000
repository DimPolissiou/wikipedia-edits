In an interview with [[Tom Disch]] in the ''[[Cortland Review]]'', Lehman addresses his great variety of poetic styles: \"I write in a lot of different styles and forms on the theory that the poems all sound like me in the end, so why not make them as different from one another as possible, at least in outward appearance? If you write a new poem every day, you will probably have by the end of the year, if you\u2019re me, an acrostic, an abecedarium, a sonnet or two, a couple of prose poems, poems that have arbitrary restrictions, such as the one I did that has only two words per line.\"<ref>[http://www.cortlandreview.com/features/99/09/index.html Tom Disch talks with David Lehman], ''The Courtland Review''.</ref>\n\nLehman has been awarded fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]], the [[Ingram Merrill Foundation]], and the NEA, and received an award in literature from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and a [[Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Writer's Award]].<ref name=poets/><ref name=best>[http://www.bestamericanpoetry.com/pages/lehman.html David Lehman] at bestamericanpoetry.com.</ref> He has lectured widely in the United States and abroad.
