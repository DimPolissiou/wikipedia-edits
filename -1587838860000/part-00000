In the [[King Kong (1933 film)|original 1933 film]] he was the first mate of the ship named the ''Venture'', while in its  [[King Kong (2005 film)|2005 remake]] he was a playwright (the less faithful [[King Kong (1976 film)|1976 remake]] had an analogous character named Jack Prescott, played by [[Jeff Bridges]]).  He was played by [[Bruce Cabot]] in the original and by [[Adrien Brody]] in the remake.  In both versions he is one of the main heroes of the story, a man who is on a ship heading for the mysterious [[Skull Island]] where [[Carl Denham]] intends to make a film.  On the way, Driscoll falls in love with the actress, Ann Darrow, and when she is kidnapped by a giant ape on the island named [[King Kong|Kong]], Driscoll rescues her after helping to lead a search.  Beyond these facts, even his characterization is quite different in the two films.\n\nDriscoll is a supporting character in ''Kong: King of Skull Island'', an \"authorized\" illustrated-novel that continues the Kong story in 1957.\n\nDriscoll is also a playable character in the [[video game]] ''[[Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie]]'', along with Kong himself.\n\n==1933 film==\nIn the 1933 film, Driscoll is a rugged sailor, the ''Venture''{{'}}s first mate, who disdains having women on ships, considering even their mere presence to be a \"nuisance\".  He says as much to Ann Darrow, but despite this early encounter, and while still on the ship, Driscoll eventually develops an infatuation with her, telling her, \"Say... I guess I love you.\"  As Denham remarked, \"Some big hard-boiled egg gets a look at a pretty face and bang - he cracks up and goes sappy.\"  Ann is at first surprised by Driscoll's interest, but the two embrace.  Upon reaching the island, Ann is kidnapped by the natives and sacrificed to Kong, but Driscoll, Denham and several other crew members charge into Skull Island to rescue her.  It is eventually Driscoll who saves Ann from Kong's clutches, but the ape gives chase until Denham's team captures it and sends it to [[New York City]].\n\nHaving returned to New York, Driscoll and Ann continue to work for Denham as Kong is chained to a stage and shown to live audiences. During the show, Denham gives Driscoll credit for coming to Ann's rescue, and it is revealed that Ann and Driscoll are to be married.  Kong breaks free, however, and despite Driscoll's attempts to keep Ann secure by taking her to a room and trying to fight Kong after the beast reaches through the window, Ann is once again kidnapped. They are reunited after Kong dies at the end of the film.\n\nIt is believed that the choice of actor Bruce Cabot to play Driscoll was in part due to his strong resemblance to popular heavyweight boxing champion Jack Dempsey, who at the time embodied the rugged, heroic male \"ideal\". The choice of the similar name \"Jack Driscoll\" is further indication that this was in fact the case.\n\n==2005 film==\nThe original Driscoll is divided into two separate characters in the 2005 film. His duties as first mate are transferred to second mate Ben Hayes, while the character name and the function of Ann Darrow's romantic interest are given to a [[playwright]] who tries to write a [[screenplay]] for Denham, as a friend, played by [[Adrien Brody]].<!-- according to [[King Kong (2005 film)]] --> This Jack Driscoll does not intend to join the expedition at all, but delivers the script to the ship before it departs.  With limited time, however, Driscoll did not write nearly enough, and Denham, desperate for more, tricks him into staying on the ship as it leaves for Skull Island.  Driscoll complains that he prefers the stage, but Denham retorts that \"if you ''really'' loved it, you would have jumped.\"\n\nAs it turns out, Denham's struggling actress, Ann Darrow, had been very familiar with Driscoll's work beforehand, and admired Driscoll greatly.  She is very excited to meet him, but at first the relationship is awkward (owing in part to a case of mistaken identity on Darrow's part. When writing the next part of the script with Denham, Driscoll decides to kill off the first mate. When Denham questions it, Driscoll replies, \"That's assuming she knows who the first mate is.\" This is a reference to the 1933 film, in which Jack Driscoll was the first mate of the ''Venture''.) The two eventually grow closer, however, and Driscoll also reveals that he has begun writing a comedic play dedicated to Ann, as a sign that he has fallen in love with her (the dynamic from the original, in which Ann is told that women should not be on ships, is not actually said by Driscoll, but does appear in Denham's film, although as it turns out Driscoll's script had been altered by the actor, [[King Kong (2005 film)|Bruce Baxter]]).\n\nWhile writing the screenplay, Driscoll is the first to learn that Denham is taking the crew to an undiscovered island.  When they reach the island, Ann is kidnapped by the native inhabitants as a sacrifice for Kong, and Driscoll sets out in search for her along with the rest of the crew.  He shows both great amounts of courage and a single-minded determination to find and rescue Ann. Of the original party, he is the only member who survived the journey through the island (including attacks by dinosaurs, a giant fish, and giant insects) and did not return to the settlement without rescuing Ann, managing to retrieve her by himself.\n\nUnlike the original, Driscoll did not continue with Denham or Ann after Kong was brought to New York, but rather continued with the comedy he had dedicated to Ann. Nor does Denham give Driscoll credit as being the hero of the adventure at Skull Island.  Driscoll does, however, come to fear that he has let Ann slip away from him.\n\nDriscoll realizes before anyone else that Denham's opening is heading for disaster, but cannot do anything to prevent it.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=Cities>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html Wilder's Brigade Mounted Infantry Living History Society]</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrote to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities/>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields]], and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref name=Leigh>[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/ \"Colonel Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade,\" Phil Leigh, ''New York Times'' 25 Dec 2012]</ref><ref name=Disaster>[https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm \"Battle of Chickamauga: Colonel John Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade Prevented Total Disaster,\" Hubert Jordan, ''America\u2019s Civil War'', Jul 1997]</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon used a seven rimfire-cartridge tubular magazine that came through the butt. This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>. His troops moved out toward Liberty, Bellbuckle, and Hoover's Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref name=Lightning>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning/>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref name=Lightning/>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS Chickamauga]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had deployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref name=Disaster/>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref name=SunSpencer>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref name=SunSpencer/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/blue-lightning-wilders-mounted-infantry-brigade-in-the-battle-of-chickamauga/oclc/232639520?loc=02333\n| title       = Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga\n| author      = Baumgartner, Richard A.\n| publisher   = Blue Acorn Press\n| location    = Huntington WV\n| year        = 2007\n| isbn        = 978-1-885033-35-2\n| asin        = \n| oclc        = \n| url-access  = \n}}\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/three-years-in-the-army-of-the-cumberland-the-letters-and-diary-of-major-james-a-connolly/oclc/906602437&referer=brief_results\n| title       = Three Years in the Army of the Cumberland: The Letters and Diary of Major James A.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=Cities>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html Wilder's Brigade Mounted Infantry Living History Society]</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrote to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities/>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields]], and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref name=Leigh>[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/ \"Colonel Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade,\" Phil Leigh, ''New York Times'' 25 Dec 2012]</ref><ref name=Disaster>[https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm \"Battle of Chickamauga: Colonel John Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade Prevented Total Disaster,\" Hubert Jordan, ''America\u2019s Civil War'', Jul 1997]</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon used a seven rimfire-cartridge tubular magazine that came through the butt. This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>. His troops moved out toward Liberty, Bellbuckle, and Hoover's Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref name=Lightning>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning/>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref name=Lightning/>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS Chickamauga]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had deployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref name=Disaster/>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref name=SunSpencer>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref name=SunSpencer/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/blue-lightning-wilders-mounted-infantry-brigade-in-the-battle-of-chickamauga/oclc/232639520?loc=02333\n| title       = Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga\n| author      = Baumgartner, Richard A.\n| publisher   = Blue Acorn Press\n| location    = Huntington WV\n| year        = 2007\n| isbn        = 978-1-885033-35-2\n| asin        = \n| oclc        = \n| url-access  = \n}}\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/three-years-in-the-army-of-the-cumberland-the-letters-and-diary-of-major-james-a-connolly/oclc/906602437&referer=brief_results\n| title       = Three Years in the Army of the Cumberland: The Letters and Diary of Major James A.

He was a member of the [[KK Split|Jugoplastika]] team of the late 1980s and early 1990s, which he helped to win two [[FIBA European Champions Cup]] championships ([[1989 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four|1989]] and [[1990 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four|1990]]). He spent three and a half seasons with the [[Boston Celtics]], being one of the European pioneers in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. Ra\u0111a was named one of [[FIBA's 50 Greatest Players]] in 1991, and one of the [[50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors]] in 2008. He was inducted into the [[List of players in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Basketball Hall of Fame]], as a member of the 2018 class.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Split===\nRa\u0111a began his basketball life in his native town, as a junior at [[KK Dalvin]]. He moved to [[KK Split]], which at the time went under the name of its longtime naming-rights sponsor Jugoplastika. At KK Split, Ra\u0111a starred alongside [[Toni Kuko\u010d]], while both were teenagers. The duo led the team to dominance of the [[FIBA European Champions Cup]], with repeat championship seasons in ([[1989 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four|1989]] and [[1990 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four|1990]]).\n\n====1989\u201390 season: Defection to NBA and court-ordered return to Yugoslavia====\nIn late June 1989, the 22-year-old [[center (basketball)|center]] got [[1989 NBA draft|drafted]] by the [[Boston Celtics]] in the second round as the 40th pick. Right away, he publicly expressed willingness to go to [[Boston]] immediately \"if the financial offer is good\",<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-29/sports/sp-3793_1_jugoplastika-partizan-belgrade-yugoslav-national-team Coach Denies Yugoslav Will Join Celtics : But Lakers' Pick Will Be Permitted to Play in NBA];''Los Angeles Times'', 29 June 1989</ref> and thus join fellow Yugoslavs [[Vlade Divac]], [[Dra\u017een Petrovi\u0107]], and [[\u017darko Paspalj]], who were also on their way to the [[NBA]] that summer. However, led by the club's general manager Josip Bili\u0107, Jugoplastika was adamant Ra\u0111a would not be released since they had him under contract until 1992. The entire case quickly turned into a months-long saga that played out in the Yugoslav media. The club's [[head coach]], [[Bo\u017eidar Maljkovi\u0107]], even publicly called on the Yugoslav Basketball Association (KSJ) to adopt safeguard policies, preventing players younger than age 26 from transferring to NBA teams.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-30/sports/sp-3091_1_dino-radja-yugoslav-portland-trail-blazers Calling for safeguards against NBA raids on its players, a...];''Los Angeles Times'', 30 June 1989</ref> After weeks of wrangling over his status, Ra\u0111a tried to force Jugoplastika's hand by physically going over to the U.S. in early August 1989 and unilaterally signing a one-year contract with the Celtics,<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-02/sports/sp-704_1_boston-celtics Boston Celtics Sign Dino Radja];''Los Angeles Times'', 2 August 1989</ref> reportedly worth in the neighborhood of $500,000.

Following a hearing on 26 September 1989, Judge [[Douglas P. Woodlock|Douglas Woodlock]] ruled in their favor two days later thus preventing Ra\u0111a from playing for the Celtics.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-26/sports/sp-374_1_boston-celtics U.S. Court Bars Yugoslav Star From Joining Celtics];''Los Angeles Times'', 26 September 1989</ref> Since Ra\u0111a was physically already in Boston, bringing him back to Yugoslavia required some kind of an agreement. By mid-November 1989, Jugoplastika and the Celtics agreed to terms under which the player went back to complete the 1989\u201390 season in Split before having the rights to his services transferred to the Celtics effective 1 June 1990.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=TnkuSogCVyIC&pg=PA664&lpg=PA664&dq=Radja+Boston+Celtics+contract&source=bl&ots=Mvb9RhK7i6&sig=6xqufIFsHNV0cJtw_zrXfAiD0L4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JtdNUarNLYKS2QX-1oH4AQ&ved=0CF8Q6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q=Radja%20Boston%20Celtics%20contract&f=false International Sports Law and Business, volume 1];Aaron N. Wise, Bruce S.

That same season, Jugoplastika again won the [[Yugoslav Basketball League|Yugoslav League]], its third consecutive national domestic league title, as well as its second straight [[FIBA European Champions Cup]].\n\nDespite the team's success, as previously agreed, Ra\u0111a would not stay in Split past June 1990 thus relinquishing the chance to go for the historic FIBA European Champions Cup [[three-peat]] (which the club, led by Kuko\u010d, achieved the following year), but he would not go to Boston either.\n\n===Rome===\nIn August 1990, instead of going to the [[NBA]] as previously agreed, Ra\u0111a went to Italy, signing with the wealthy [[Pallacanestro Virtus Roma|Virtus Roma]] despite claiming all along that he had wanted to join the Celtics.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-19/sports/sp-504_1_boston-celtics Radja Says Club Is Ready to Let Him Be a Celtic];''Los Angeles Times'', 19 March 1990</ref> He changed his mind once Virtus, an ambitious and financially stable club bankrolled by the [[:it:Ferruzzi|Gruppo Ferruzzi]] food company and sponsored by the daily broadsheet ''[[Il Messaggero]]'', made him an offer reportedly in the [[US$]]15\u201318 million range for a 5-year contract.<ref name=\"SI\">{{cite magazine | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1136568/index.htm | author = [[Jack McCallum]] | title = Close But No Cigar: The sagging Celts were spurned by Brian Shaw and by Dino Radja | magazine = [[Sports Illustrated]] | date = 13 August 1990 | accessdate = 23 February 2012}}</ref> Italian and Yugoslav newspapers reported that Ra\u0111a's annual salary at the time, [[Italian lira|L]]3.6 billion, at Virtus was higher than soccer superstars [[Diego Maradona]]'s and [[Roberto Baggio]]'s annual compensations at [[S.S.C.

Reportedly, part of the reason Boston did not put up much of a fight when the player suddenly decided to sign with Virtus was the July 1990 court decision against them following the motion by Ra\u0111a's American [[sports agent|agent]], Marc Fleisher, after the Virtus offer came in. Taking advantage of an administrative loophole,<ref>{{cite news|last=Arace|first=Michael|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-23/sports/sp-1950_1_reggie-lewis|title=Reggie Lewis Signed Up by Celtics for 5 Years|agency=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date=23 August 1990|accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref> Fleisher claimed that Ra\u0111a's contract with the Celtics violated a provision of the agreement between the league and the NBA players that said, among other things, that one-year contracts could not be extended. A special officer of the court had heard the case and ruled in Ra\u0111a's favour, against the Celtics.<ref name=\"SI\"/>\n\nSimultaneous to the legal battle his agent was waging over the future of his club career, Ra\u0111a had been spending the summer of 1990 with the [[Yugoslavia national basketball team|Yugoslav national team]] in a four-month training camp for the [[1990 FIBA World Championship]] that included an appearance at the [[1990 Goodwill Games]] in [[Seattle]] where the 23-year-old suffered a leg fracture in the final game against the [[United States men's national basketball team|U.S. national team]], ruling him out of the World Championship that started a week later. Yugoslavia head coach [[Du\u0161an Ivkovi\u0107]] later revealed that injured Ra\u0111a and the center's agent Marc Fleisher asked him not to publicly disclose the player's injury before the deal with Virtus is signed, which Ivkovi\u0107 consented to.<ref name=\"Zlatnimomci\"/>\n\nSome observers saw Virtus' sudden and lucrative contract offer to Ra\u0111a as their retribution to the Celtics for going to court a few months earlier over enforcing Virtus' point guard [[Brian Shaw]]'s NBA contract and winning the case even after the player who had spent the previous 1989-90 season with Virtus tried to remain in Rome.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.espn.com.au/boston/nba/columns/story?columnist=may_peter&id=5685362|first=Peter|last=May|title=Erden brings new dimension to C's|newspaper=[[ESPN.com]]|date=14 October 2010|accessdate=4 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, commenting on his summer 1990 decision to stay in Europe, even after only a year prior seeming desperately intent on playing in the NBA, Ra\u0111a said: {{cquote|''I was playing well.

European sports journalists voted him the second best European player that season, behind only his former teammate and friend Kuko\u010d.\n\nHe improved his scoring average each of the next two seasons with the Roman club, averaging 20.3 and 21.7 points in the Italian League,<ref name=\"web.legabasket.it\"/> respectively.\n\nIn 1992, he [[1991\u201392 FIBA Kora\u0107 Cup|led]] Virtus to a [[European professional club basketball system|European 3rd-tier level]] [[FIBA Kora\u0107 Cup]] title.\n\n===Boston Celtics===\nRa\u0111a finally joined the Celtics in the summer of 1993, signing a three-year contract on 9 July,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/10/sports/sports-people-basketball-celtics-complete-radja-deal.html Celtics Complete Radja Deal];''The New York Times'', 10 July 1993</ref> four years after initial interest from both parties and the voided contract in 1989. Some two and a half weeks later, the team went through a shocking incident when the Celtics' leading scorer, [[small forward]] [[Reggie Lewis]], died on the basketball court at the team's [[Brandeis University]] practice facility after suffering [[sudden cardiac death]] from a heart defect.\n\nPlaying alongside [[Dee Brown (basketball, born 1968)|Dee Brown]], 40-year-old veteran [[Robert Parish]], and [[Rick Fox]], twenty-six-year-old Ra\u0111a averaged 15.1 points and 7.2 rebounds in his [[1993\u201394 Boston Celtics season|debut season]] during which he made $1.5 million in salary.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/1993-11-02/sports/0000002573_1_dino-radja-celtics-coach-chris-ford-dave-gavitt Celtics' Radja Proving He Belongs];''Hartford Courant'', 2 November 1993</ref> With a 32\u201350 regular season record, the Celtics missed the NBA playoffs, finishing 10th overall in the eastern conference. At the end of the season, Ra\u0111a was voted to the [[NBA All-Rookie Team|NBA All-Rookie Second Team]], along with Kuko\u010d, who had just completed his rookie campaign with the [[Chicago Bulls]].\n\nIn early November 1994, at the start of [[1994\u201395 Boston Celtics season|his second season]] with the Celtics, Ra\u0111a was looking for a contract extension on his existing three-year deal, which was expiring in the summer of 1996. With his agent Mark Fleisher engaged in long negotiations<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150924201131/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8303175.html Radja looks like lost cause With extension unlikely, escape looms];''The Boston Globe'', 8 November 1994</ref> with the Celtics brass led by GM Jan Volk, the deal was reached to add three more years to Ra\u0111a's existing contract beginning with the 1996\u201397 season.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1290&dat=19941109&id=B1JUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=t40DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3311,4386566 Celtics, Radja agree contract extension];''Boca Raton News'', 9 November 1994</ref>\n\nThe 1996\u201397 season, Ra\u0111a's fourth in Boston, was marked by a left knee injury that forced him to miss 57 regular season games. In January 1997, he underwent [[arthroscopic surgery]] on his knee. The Celtics finished the season dead-last in their division, with a 15\u201367 record, the worst in the eastern conference, forcing a coaching change at the end of the season, with [[Rick Pitino]] replacing [[M. L. Carr]].\n\nIn June 1997, a trade that was to send thirty-year-old Ra\u0111a to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] (in exchange for [[Clarence Weatherspoon]] and [[Michael Cage]]) fell through when Ra\u0111a failed his 24 June 1997 physical with the 76ers. Apparently, the 76ers staffers that examined Ra\u0111a determined he had no [[cartilage]] in his left knee, estimating that \"because his left knee is bone-on-bone, he can play games, but he can't practice afterwards, because his knee will swell\" and that \"he can't play four games in six days\".<ref>[http://articles.philly.com/1997-06-27/sports/25525198_1_sixers-dino-radja-nets-trade Boston Drops Radja Challenge];''The Inquirer'', 27 June 1997</ref> The Celtics initially challenged the 76ers' decision to void the trade, but quickly dropped their arbitration request. Ra\u0111a had three more years left on his guaranteed contract and, according to the NBA regulations, if he was to fail another team's physical, the Celtics would have to pay his entire remaining salary. Unconvinced about Ra\u0111a's physical condition, the Celtics gave up on trying to trade him, instead agreeing a buyout of the three years that remained on his contract. Following the buyout, the Celtics waived Ra\u0111a on 16 July 1997.\n\nIn 2005, Ra\u0111a talked about his exit from Boston: {{cquote|''I went to Pitino and asked him if I fit into his plans. With a new coach, I obviously wanted to know what he thought of my game. I loved playing for Boston and just wanted to find out if there was any possibility I might be traded, because I had heard some rumours. Pitino looked me right in the eyes and said, \"Dino, don't worry. You're going to be a big part of our offense. When we run a set play, the ball is going to go through you.' I left the meeting feeling great. Five days later, I found out I was being traded to Philadelphia. I can't tell you how much I felt betrayed. Either Pitino lied or something changed in a matter of a few days.\"<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=eMPHqkXjbM0C&pg=PA52&lpg=PA52&dq=Radja+Vrankovic+Boston+Celtics&source=bl&ots=_L--OZung3&sig=6zebbkVqSW2dk4GHtGaH-6grLUM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FcVNUZ2SEoLi4AO67oHoDA&ved=0CCwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=Radja%20Vrankovic%20Boston%20Celtics&f=false Boston Celtics: Where Have You Gone?];Mike Carey, Michael D. McClellan 2005, p.54</ref>}}\n\nOver the course of his four seasons with the Celtics, Ra\u0111a averaged 16.7 points and 8.4 rebounds per game in the regular season. In the NBA playoffs, where he only made a single appearance with four games played, he averaged 15.0 points and 7.0 rebounds per game.\n\n===Return to Europe: Panathinaikos===\nIn the wake of his failed physical in Philadelphia and Rick Pitino's unwillingness to keep him on the Celtics' roster, Ra\u0111a returned to Europe in July 1997, joining [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], a rich and ambitious club bankrolled by the Giannakopoulos brothers ([[Pavlos Giannakopoulos|Pavlos]] and [[Thanasis Giannakopoulos|Thanasis]]) who made their money in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nFor Panathinaikos' owners, finishing the previous 1996\u201397 season without any trophies (having previously, in the 1995\u201396 season, won both the [[FIBA European League]] and the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]]) was deemed unacceptable, bringing about big changes to the team. The team's head coach [[Bo\u017eidar Maljkovi\u0107]] (Ra\u0111a's mentor from his Split days) had already been released during the previous failed season, while his interim replacement, Michalis Kokalis, was let go in the summer of 1997 to make way for new head coach [[Slobodan Suboti\u0107]]. Also coming in alongside Ra\u0111a and coach Suboti\u0107, was 36-year-old NBA veteran [[Byron Scott (basketball)|Byron Scott]] from the [[LA Lakers]].\n\nRa\u0111a spent two years in Athens, winning two [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] championships, but in 1999, he returned to his native Croatia, to play for [[KK Zadar|Zadar]]. He left Panathinaikos partly because of an encounter with [[Pavlos Giannakopoulos|the club president]]'s son, [[Dimitrios Giannakopoulos]], in the locker room after a game. The president's son, [[Dimitrios Giannakopoulos|Dimitrios]], allegedly cursed at the team's head coach Suboti\u0107, but at that time, Ra\u0111a did not know that the person he was arguing with was the son of the club's president.<ref>http://www.blog.hr/print/id/1623177546/dezbjego-show-slobodan-subotic.html {{in lang|hr}}</ref> He left the club at the end of the season, after winning the Greek League finals against [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]].\n\nIn 2000, he returned to Greece, joining Panathinaikos' long-time rivals, [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]], in an unsuccessful attempt to regain the Greek League championship. With Olympiacos, on 16 October 2000, he scored his first points in the [[EuroLeague]] competition, under its new format in which it was run by [[Euroleague Basketball]], in a match against [[Real Madrid Baloncesto|Real Madrid]].<ref>http://www.euroleague.net/news/i/5teeg5mf8yhh44wj/euroleague-s-500-000th-point-scored-on-friday</ref>\n\nHe returned, once again, to Croatia, joining [[KK Cibona|Cibona]] for the 2001\u201302 season. Ra\u0111a finished his career in 2003, by winning the [[A1 Liga|Croatian League]] championship with his first team, [[KK Split|Split CO]].\n\n==National team career==\nRa\u0111a was on the senior men's [[Yugoslavian national basketball team|Yugoslavian national team]] that won the silver medal in the [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1988 Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Seoul]]. He was also a part of the golden Yugoslavian teams at the [[1987 FIBA Under-19 World Championship]] in [[Bormio]], Italy, [[EuroBasket 1989]] in [[Zagreb]] and the [[EuroBasket 1991]] in Rome.\n\nFollowing Croatia's independence, Ra\u0111a became an important player of the senior men's [[Croatian national basketball team]], most notably at the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1992 Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Barcelona]], where Croatia won the silver medal. Ra\u0111a was also on the Croatian teams that won the bronze at the [[EuroBasket 1993]] in Germany, [[1994 FIBA World Championship]] in [[Toronto]], and the [[EuroBasket 1995]] in [[Athens]]. With 1,764 points scored, he was the all-time top scorer for the Croatian national team until 2018, when he was surpassed by [[Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107]].<ref>{{cite

Radja''', {{IPA-sh|\u02ccd\u01d0\u02d0no \u02c8r\u00e2d\u035c\u0291a|hr}}; born 24 April 1967) is a Croatian former professional [[basketball]] player. He was a member of the [[KK Split|Jugoplastika]] team of the late 1980s and early 1990s, which he helped to win two [[FIBA European Champions Cup]] championships ([[1989 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four|1989]] and [[1990 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four|1990]]). He spent three and a half seasons with the [[Boston Celtics]], being one of the European pioneers in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. Ra\u0111a was named one of [[FIBA's 50 Greatest Players]] in 1991, and one of the [[50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors]] in 2008. He was inducted into the [[List of players in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Basketball Hall of Fame]], as a member of the 2018 class.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Split===\nRa\u0111a began his basketball life in his native town, as a junior at [[KK Dalvin]]. He moved to [[KK Split]], which at the time went under the name of its longtime naming-rights sponsor Jugoplastika. At KK Split, Ra\u0111a starred alongside [[Toni Kuko\u010d]], while both were teenagers. The duo led the team to dominance of the [[FIBA European Champions Cup]], with repeat championship seasons in ([[1989 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four|1989]] and [[1990 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four|1990]]).\n\n====1989\u201390 season: Defection to NBA and court-ordered return to Yugoslavia====\nIn late June 1989, the 22-year-old [[center (basketball)|center]] got [[1989 NBA draft|drafted]] by the [[Boston Celtics]] in the second round as the 40th pick. Right away, he publicly expressed willingness to go to [[Boston]] immediately \"if the financial offer is good\",<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-29/sports/sp-3793_1_jugoplastika-partizan-belgrade-yugoslav-national-team Coach Denies Yugoslav Will Join Celtics : But Lakers' Pick Will Be Permitted to Play in NBA];''Los Angeles Times'', 29 June 1989</ref> and thus join fellow Yugoslavs [[Vlade Divac]], [[Dra\u017een Petrovi\u0107]], and [[\u017darko Paspalj]], who were also on their way to the [[NBA]] that summer. However, led by the club's general manager Josip Bili\u0107, Jugoplastika was adamant Ra\u0111a would not be released since they had him under contract until 1992. The entire case quickly turned into a months-long saga that played out in the Yugoslav media. The club's [[head coach]], [[Bo\u017eidar Maljkovi\u0107]], even publicly called on the Yugoslav Basketball Association (KSJ) to adopt safeguard policies, preventing players younger than age 26 from transferring to NBA teams.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-30/sports/sp-3091_1_dino-radja-yugoslav-portland-trail-blazers Calling for safeguards against NBA raids on its players, a...];''Los Angeles Times'', 30 June 1989</ref> After weeks of wrangling over his status, Ra\u0111a tried to force Jugoplastika's hand by physically going over to the U.S. in early August 1989 and unilaterally signing a one-year contract with the Celtics,<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-02/sports/sp-704_1_boston-celtics Boston Celtics Sign Dino Radja];''Los Angeles Times'', 2 August 1989</ref> reportedly worth in the neighborhood of $500,000.

Following a hearing on 26 September 1989, Judge [[Douglas P. Woodlock|Douglas Woodlock]] ruled in their favor two days later thus preventing Ra\u0111a from playing for the Celtics.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-26/sports/sp-374_1_boston-celtics U.S. Court Bars Yugoslav Star From Joining Celtics];''Los Angeles Times'', 26 September 1989</ref> Since Ra\u0111a was physically already in Boston, bringing him back to Yugoslavia required some kind of an agreement. By mid-November 1989, Jugoplastika and the Celtics agreed to terms under which the player went back to complete the 1989\u201390 season in Split before having the rights to his services transferred to the Celtics effective 1 June 1990.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=TnkuSogCVyIC&pg=PA664&lpg=PA664&dq=Radja+Boston+Celtics+contract&source=bl&ots=Mvb9RhK7i6&sig=6xqufIFsHNV0cJtw_zrXfAiD0L4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JtdNUarNLYKS2QX-1oH4AQ&ved=0CF8Q6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q=Radja%20Boston%20Celtics%20contract&f=false International Sports Law and Business, volume 1];Aaron N.

That same season, Jugoplastika again won the [[Yugoslav Basketball League|Yugoslav League]], its third consecutive national domestic league title, as well as its second straight [[FIBA European Champions Cup]].\n\nDespite the team's success, as previously agreed, Ra\u0111a would not stay in Split past June 1990 thus relinquishing the chance to go for the historic FIBA European Champions Cup [[three-peat]] (which the club, led by Kuko\u010d, achieved the following year), but he would not go to Boston either.\n\n===Rome===\nIn August 1990, instead of going to the [[NBA]] as previously agreed, Ra\u0111a went to Italy, signing with the wealthy [[Pallacanestro Virtus Roma|Virtus Roma]] despite claiming all along that he had wanted to join the Celtics.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-19/sports/sp-504_1_boston-celtics Radja Says Club Is Ready to Let Him Be a Celtic];''Los Angeles Times'', 19 March 1990</ref> He changed his mind once Virtus, an ambitious and financially stable club bankrolled by the [[:it:Ferruzzi|Gruppo Ferruzzi]] food company and sponsored by the daily broadsheet ''[[Il Messaggero]]'', made him an offer reportedly in the [[US$]]15\u201318 million range for a 5-year contract.<ref name=\"SI\">{{cite magazine | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1136568/index.htm | author = [[Jack McCallum]] | title = Close But No Cigar: The sagging Celts were spurned by Brian Shaw and by Dino Radja | magazine = [[Sports Illustrated]] | date = 13 August 1990 | accessdate = 23 February 2012}}</ref> Italian and Yugoslav newspapers reported that Ra\u0111a's annual salary at the time, [[Italian lira|L]]3.6 billion, at Virtus was higher than soccer superstars [[Diego Maradona]]'s and [[Roberto Baggio]]'s annual compensations at [[S.S.C.

Reportedly, part of the reason Boston did not put up much of a fight when the player suddenly decided to sign with Virtus was the July 1990 court decision against them following the motion by Ra\u0111a's American [[sports agent|agent]], Marc Fleisher, after the Virtus offer came in. Taking advantage of an administrative loophole,<ref>{{cite news|last=Arace|first=Michael|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-23/sports/sp-1950_1_reggie-lewis|title=Reggie Lewis Signed Up by Celtics for 5 Years|agency=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date=23 August 1990|accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref> Fleisher claimed that Ra\u0111a's contract with the Celtics violated a provision of the agreement between the league and the NBA players that said, among other things, that one-year contracts could not be extended. A special officer of the court had heard the case and ruled in Ra\u0111a's favour, against the Celtics.<ref name=\"SI\"/>\n\nSimultaneous to the legal battle his agent was waging over the future of his club career, Ra\u0111a had been spending the summer of 1990 with the [[Yugoslavia national basketball team|Yugoslav national team]] in a four-month training camp for the [[1990 FIBA World Championship]] that included an appearance at the [[1990 Goodwill Games]] in [[Seattle]] where the 23-year-old suffered a leg fracture in the final game against the [[United States men's national basketball team|U.S. national team]], ruling him out of the World Championship that started a week later. Yugoslavia head coach [[Du\u0161an Ivkovi\u0107]] later revealed that injured Ra\u0111a and the center's agent Marc Fleisher asked him not to publicly disclose the player's injury before the deal with Virtus is signed, which Ivkovi\u0107 consented to.<ref name=\"Zlatnimomci\"/>\n\nSome observers saw Virtus' sudden and lucrative contract offer to Ra\u0111a as their retribution to the Celtics for going to court a few months earlier over enforcing Virtus' point guard [[Brian Shaw]]'s NBA contract and winning the case even after the player who had spent the previous 1989-90 season with Virtus tried to remain in Rome.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.espn.com.au/boston/nba/columns/story?columnist=may_peter&id=5685362|first=Peter|last=May|title=Erden brings new dimension to C's|newspaper=[[ESPN.com]]|date=14 October 2010|accessdate=4 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, commenting on his summer 1990 decision to stay in Europe, even after only a year prior seeming desperately intent on playing in the NBA, Ra\u0111a said: {{cquote|''I was playing well.

European sports journalists voted him the second best European player that season, behind only his former teammate and friend Kuko\u010d.\n\nHe improved his scoring average each of the next two seasons with the Roman club, averaging 20.3 and 21.7 points in the Italian League,<ref name=\"web.legabasket.it\"/> respectively.\n\nIn 1992, he [[1991\u201392 FIBA Kora\u0107 Cup|led]] Virtus to a [[European professional club basketball system|European 3rd-tier level]] [[FIBA Kora\u0107 Cup]] title.\n\n===Boston Celtics===\nRa\u0111a finally joined the Celtics in the summer of 1993, signing a three-year contract on 9 July,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/10/sports/sports-people-basketball-celtics-complete-radja-deal.html Celtics Complete Radja Deal];''The New York Times'', 10 July 1993</ref> four years after initial interest from both parties and the voided contract in 1989. Some two and a half weeks later, the team went through a shocking incident when the Celtics' leading scorer, [[small forward]] [[Reggie Lewis]], died on the basketball court at the team's [[Brandeis University]] practice facility after suffering [[sudden cardiac death]] from a heart defect.\n\nPlaying alongside [[Dee Brown (basketball, born 1968)|Dee Brown]], 40-year-old veteran [[Robert Parish]], and [[Rick Fox]], twenty-six-year-old Ra\u0111a averaged 15.1 points and 7.2 rebounds in his [[1993\u201394 Boston Celtics season|debut season]] during which he made $1.5 million in salary.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/1993-11-02/sports/0000002573_1_dino-radja-celtics-coach-chris-ford-dave-gavitt Celtics' Radja Proving He Belongs];''Hartford Courant'', 2 November 1993</ref> With a 32\u201350 regular season record, the Celtics missed the NBA playoffs, finishing 10th overall in the eastern conference. At the end of the season, Ra\u0111a was voted to the [[NBA All-Rookie Team|NBA All-Rookie Second Team]], along with Kuko\u010d, who had just completed his rookie campaign with the [[Chicago Bulls]].\n\nIn early November 1994, at the start of [[1994\u201395 Boston Celtics season|his second season]] with the Celtics, Ra\u0111a was looking for a contract extension on his existing three-year deal, which was expiring in the summer of 1996. With his agent Mark Fleisher engaged in long negotiations<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150924201131/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8303175.html Radja looks like lost cause With extension unlikely, escape looms];''The Boston Globe'', 8 November 1994</ref> with the Celtics brass led by GM Jan Volk, the deal was reached to add three more years to Ra\u0111a's existing contract beginning with the 1996\u201397 season.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1290&dat=19941109&id=B1JUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=t40DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3311,4386566 Celtics, Radja agree contract extension];''Boca Raton News'', 9 November 1994</ref>\n\nThe 1996\u201397 season, Ra\u0111a's fourth in Boston, was marked by a left knee injury that forced him to miss 57 regular season games. In January 1997, he underwent [[arthroscopic surgery]] on his knee. The Celtics finished the season dead-last in their division, with a 15\u201367 record, the worst in the eastern conference, forcing a coaching change at the end of the season, with [[Rick Pitino]] replacing [[M. L. Carr]].\n\nIn June 1997, a trade that was to send thirty-year-old Ra\u0111a to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] (in exchange for [[Clarence Weatherspoon]] and [[Michael Cage]]) fell through when Ra\u0111a failed his 24 June 1997 physical with the 76ers. Apparently, the 76ers staffers that examined Ra\u0111a determined he had no [[cartilage]] in his left knee, estimating that \"because his left knee is bone-on-bone, he can play games, but he can't practice afterwards, because his knee will swell\" and that \"he can't play four games in six days\".<ref>[http://articles.philly.com/1997-06-27/sports/25525198_1_sixers-dino-radja-nets-trade Boston Drops Radja Challenge];''The Inquirer'', 27 June 1997</ref> The Celtics initially challenged the 76ers' decision to void the trade, but quickly dropped their arbitration request. Ra\u0111a had three more years left on his guaranteed contract and, according to the NBA regulations, if he was to fail another team's physical, the Celtics would have to pay his entire remaining salary. Unconvinced about Ra\u0111a's physical condition, the Celtics gave up on trying to trade him, instead agreeing a buyout of the three years that remained on his contract. Following the buyout, the Celtics waived Ra\u0111a on 16 July 1997.\n\nIn 2005, Ra\u0111a talked about his exit from Boston: {{cquote|''I went to Pitino and asked him if I fit into his plans. With a new coach, I obviously wanted to know what he thought of my game. I loved playing for Boston and just wanted to find out if there was any possibility I might be traded, because I had heard some rumours. Pitino looked me right in the eyes and said, \"Dino, don't worry. You're going to be a big part of our offense. When we run a set play, the ball is going to go through you.' I left the meeting feeling great. Five days later, I found out I was being traded to Philadelphia. I can't tell you how much I felt betrayed. Either Pitino lied or something changed in a matter of a few days.\"<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=eMPHqkXjbM0C&pg=PA52&lpg=PA52&dq=Radja+Vrankovic+Boston+Celtics&source=bl&ots=_L--OZung3&sig=6zebbkVqSW2dk4GHtGaH-6grLUM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FcVNUZ2SEoLi4AO67oHoDA&ved=0CCwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=Radja%20Vrankovic%20Boston%20Celtics&f=false Boston Celtics: Where Have You Gone?];Mike Carey, Michael D. McClellan 2005, p.54</ref>}}\n\nOver the course of his four seasons with the Celtics, Ra\u0111a averaged 16.7 points and 8.4 rebounds per game in the regular season. In the NBA playoffs, where he only made a single appearance with four games played, he averaged 15.0 points and 7.0 rebounds per game.\n\n===Return to Europe: Panathinaikos===\nIn the wake of his failed physical in Philadelphia and Rick Pitino's unwillingness to keep him on the Celtics' roster, Ra\u0111a returned to Europe in July 1997, joining [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], a rich and ambitious club bankrolled by the Giannakopoulos brothers ([[Pavlos Giannakopoulos|Pavlos]] and [[Thanasis Giannakopoulos|Thanasis]]) who made their money in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nFor Panathinaikos' owners, finishing the previous 1996\u201397 season without any trophies (having previously, in the 1995\u201396 season, won both the [[FIBA European League]] and the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]]) was deemed unacceptable, bringing about big changes to the team. The team's head coach [[Bo\u017eidar Maljkovi\u0107]] (Ra\u0111a's mentor from his Split days) had already been released during the previous failed season, while his interim replacement, Michalis Kokalis, was let go in the summer of 1997 to make way for new head coach [[Slobodan Suboti\u0107]]. Also coming in alongside Ra\u0111a and coach Suboti\u0107, was 36-year-old NBA veteran [[Byron Scott (basketball)|Byron Scott]] from the [[LA Lakers]].\n\nRa\u0111a spent two years in Athens, winning two [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] championships, but in 1999, he returned to his native Croatia, to play for [[KK Zadar|Zadar]]. He left Panathinaikos partly because of an encounter with [[Pavlos Giannakopoulos|the club president]]'s son, [[Dimitrios Giannakopoulos]], in the locker room after a game. The president's son, [[Dimitrios Giannakopoulos|Dimitrios]], allegedly cursed at the team's head coach Suboti\u0107, but at that time, Ra\u0111a did not know that the person he was arguing with was the son of the club's president.<ref>http://www.blog.hr/print/id/1623177546/dezbjego-show-slobodan-subotic.html {{in lang|hr}}</ref> He left the club at the end of the season, after winning the Greek League finals against [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]].\n\nIn 2000, he returned to Greece, joining Panathinaikos' long-time rivals, [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]], in an unsuccessful attempt to regain the Greek League championship. With Olympiacos, on 16 October 2000, he scored his first points in the [[EuroLeague]] competition, under its new format in which it was run by [[Euroleague Basketball]], in a match against [[Real Madrid Baloncesto|Real Madrid]].<ref>http://www.euroleague.net/news/i/5teeg5mf8yhh44wj/euroleague-s-500-000th-point-scored-on-friday</ref>\n\nHe returned, once again, to Croatia, joining [[KK Cibona|Cibona]] for the 2001\u201302 season. Ra\u0111a finished his career in 2003, by winning the [[A1 Liga|Croatian League]] championship with his first team, [[KK Split|Split CO]].\n\n==National team career==\nRa\u0111a was on the senior men's [[Yugoslavian national basketball team|Yugoslavian national team]] that won the silver medal in the [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1988 Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Seoul]]. He was also a part of the golden Yugoslavian teams at the [[1987 FIBA Under-19 World Championship]] in [[Bormio]], Italy, [[EuroBasket 1989]] in [[Zagreb]] and the [[EuroBasket 1991]] in Rome.\n\nFollowing Croatia's independence, Ra\u0111a became an important player of the senior men's [[Croatian national basketball team]], most notably at the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1992 Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Barcelona]], where Croatia won the silver medal. Ra\u0111a was also on the Croatian teams that won the bronze at the [[EuroBasket 1993]] in Germany, [[1994 FIBA World Championship]] in [[Toronto]], and the [[EuroBasket 1995]] in [[Athens]]. With 1,764 points scored, he was the all-time top scorer for the Croatian national team until 2018, when he was surpassed by [[Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107]].<ref>{{cite

He also guided the Tigers to two NBL championships, in 1993 and 1997, and was named an [[All-NBL Team|All-NBL First Team]] member for a record high 15 consecutive years.

Gaze is also the nephew of former [[Australian Opals]] coach Tony Gaze and the cousin of Mark Gaze, who played 182 games in the NBL from 1983\u20131991 and represented Australia at the [[1982 FIBA World Championship]]. He is also the second cousin of [[Canberra Capitals]] guard [[Kate Gaze]], the daughter of Mark Gaze and former WNBL player Michelle O'Connor.\n\nGaze grew up at [[Albert Park Basketball Stadium]], the home of the Victorian Basketball Association (VBA), with his father the general manager of the VBA at the time. After graduating from [[Albert Park College]], Gaze pursued a professional basketball career and attended [[Victoria University, Australia|Victoria University]] in Melbourne.\n\n==Playing career==\n===NBL and college===\nIn 1984, Gaze joined the [[Melbourne Tigers]] of the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] as an 18-year-old. His first season with the Tigers saw him win the [[NBL Rookie of the Year Award]] after averaging an impressive 29.1 points, 6.7 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 1.6 steals in 24 games.<ref name=\"nbl-stats\">[http://www.foxsportspulse.com/team_info.cgi?action=PSTATS&pID=190395826&client=0-189-12322-125703-369917 Player statistics for Andrew Gaze]</ref> By 1986, he made his first [[All-NBL Team|All-NBL First Team]] selection. He would go on to earn first-team honours in 15 straight seasons (1986\u20132000). In the [[1987 NBL season]], Gaze set an NBL record for points per game in a season when he averaged 44.1 points. This was despite the Tigers finishing the season in last place with a 3\u201323 record. During the season, Gaze had a 60-point game (against the [[Newcastle Falcons (basketball)|Newcastle Falcons]]) and another five 50-point games.\n\nFollowing the [[1988 NBL season]], Gaze, who was spotted by talent scouts while playing for Australia at the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]], moved to the United States after being recruited to play [[college basketball]] for [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall University]]. During the 1988\u201389 season, Gaze played in 38 games for the Seton Hall Pirates, averaging 13.6 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game.<ref>[https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/andrew-gaze-1.html Andrew Gaze College Stats]</ref> Gaze started every game in The Hall's [[1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|first-ever run to the NCAA Final Four]], twice leading all Pirates scorers with 19 points in their Elite Eight win over [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels men's basketball|UNLV]] and 20 points (highlighted by 4-from-9 shooting from 3) in the National Semifinal win against [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]. He completed his season at Seton Hall with an 80\u201379 overtime loss to the [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan Wolverines]] in the NCAA Championship Game which was played in front of 39,187 fans at the [[Kingdome]] in [[Seattle]], where he was heavily guarded and limited to only five field goal attempts, all from three-point range. After a year in New Jersey, Gaze returned to Australia and re-joined the Tigers for the [[1989 NBL season]].<ref name=\"Gaze Is Gone But Questions Arise\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/14/sports/gaze-is-gone-but-questions-arise.html Gaze Is Gone But Questions Arise]</ref> He missed the back-end of the [[1990 NBL season]] due to a blood clot in his right shoulder.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-09-11-sp-434-story.html THE SIDELINES : Clot Hospitalizes Andrew Gaze]</ref>\n\nNot known for being an outstanding athlete, Gaze's heavy scoring in the NBL was due to exceptional shooting, including from three-point range. A crowd favourite to the Tigers faithful, Gaze was a front runner in the league's resurgence during the 1990s, as he and American import [[Lanard Copeland]] combined to form a formidable backcourt and guided the Tigers to two championships in 1993 and 1997.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ9Yd5upYr0 Andrew Gaze and Lanard Copeland]</ref> Playing under his father with the Tigers, Gaze assured the team were perpetual finalists.\n\nIn his later years, Gaze still managed to score at a high clip for the Tigers, averaging over 19 points per game in each of his last four NBL seasons. Following the [[2004\u201305 NBL season]], Gaze announced his retirement from the NBL. In 20 seasons with the Tigers, he played a total of 612 games and recorded 18,908 points at an average of 30.9 points per game.<ref name=\"nbl-stats\" />\n\n===Europe and NBA===\nIn addition to playing in the NBL, Gaze spent multiple seasons overseas during the 1990s. In 1991, Gaze became the first Australian to play professionally in Europe, with [[Serie A2 Basket|Italian 2nd League]] club [[Pallalcesto Amatori Udine|Udine]]. In a six-month stint in Italy, he averaged over 30 points per game.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100818154617/http://www.musictheatreaustralia.com.au/component/entertainers/andrew_gaze/4779 Andrew Gaze \u2013 Music Theatre Australia]</ref>Despite his best efforts, the team finished the league last and was relegated to the [[Serie B Basket|3rd division]]. In March 1994, Gaze returned to the United States and signed with the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Washington Bullets]]. In seven games for the Bullets during the [[1993\u201394 NBA season]], he averaged 3.1 points per game. In early 1995, he moved to Greece and played half a season for [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] club [[Apollon Patras B.C.|Apollon Patras]].<ref>[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.sport.basketball.misc/-9Y_MX8v7ts Andrew Gaze playing in Greece]</ref> He had another short stint in the NBA during the lockout-shortened [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]], this time with the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. He received very little court time for a stacked [[1998\u201399 San Antonio Spurs season|Spurs team]] that included guards [[Mario Elie]], [[Avery Johnson]], [[Antonio Daniels]] and [[Steve Kerr]]. He appeared in just 19 games for the Spurs during the regular season and was inactive for the entire [[1999 NBA Playoffs|playoff run]], which saw the Spurs win their first [[1999 NBA Finals|NBA championship]].<ref>[https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/gazean01.html Andrew Gaze NBA Stats]</ref>\n\n===National team===\nOn the international stage, Gaze forged his reputation as one of Australia's finest products, appearing at the [[Basketball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games]], as a 19-year-old. He led all scorers at the [[1994 FIBA World Championship]] with 23.9 points per game, leading the Aussies to a fifth-place finish. In [[Basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2000]], he became (jointly with American [[Teresa Edwards]]) the third basketball player to compete at [[List of athletes with the most appearances at Olympic Games|five Olympics]], after Puerto Rican [[Te\u00f3filo Cruz]] and Brazilian [[Oscar Schmidt]]. That year, Gaze was the [[List of flag bearers for Australia at the Olympics|flag bearer]] at the [[2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2000 Sydney Olympics|Sydney Olympics]], and he was also the Australian [[captain (sports)|Team Captain]]. At the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Atlanta Olympics]], he led the [[Australia men's national basketball team|Boomers]] to their best Olympic performance, a fourth-placed finish, with a 5\u20133 record.<ref>[https://www.basketball-reference.com/olympics/athletes/andrew-gaze-1 Andrew Gaze Olympic Stats]</ref>\n\nGaze also competed in four [[FIBA World Cup]]s with the Boomers, as he played in more than 280 [[cap (sports)|matches]] for Australia.

He also guided the Tigers to two NBL championships, in 1993 and 1997, and was named an [[All-NBL Team|All-NBL First Team]] member for a record high 15 consecutive years.

He was inducted into the [[Australian Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 2004, and the [[Sport Australia Hall of Fame]] in 2005, after becoming a member of the [[Order of Australia]] in 2002. In 2013, he joined his father, [[Lindsay Gaze|Lindsay]], in the [[FIBA Hall of Fame]], to become just the third Australian inductee.<ref name=fame>[http://www.basketball.net.au/andrew-gaze-inducted-into-fiba-hall-of-fame/ ANDREW GAZE INDUCTED INTO FIBA HALL OF FAME]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140112135103/http://www.tigers.com.au/article/id/182havmjo4ndg17i5if77snwuf Basketball legend ANDREW GAZE inducted into FIBA Hall Of Fame]</ref> Two Australian basketball awards have been named in Gaze's honour: the NBL MVP award is named the Andrew Gaze Trophy, and the [[Australian International Player of the Year]] award is named the Gaze Medal.\n\n==Early life and family==\nGaze was born in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the son of Lindsay and Margaret Gaze, and has an older sister, Janet. Gaze is also the nephew of former [[Australian Opals]] coach Tony Gaze and the cousin of Mark Gaze, who played 182 games in the NBL from 1983\u20131991 and represented Australia at the [[1982 FIBA World Championship]]. He is also the second cousin of [[Canberra Capitals]] guard [[Kate Gaze]], the daughter of Mark Gaze and former WNBL player Michelle O'Connor.\n\nGaze grew up at [[Albert Park Basketball Stadium]], the home of the Victorian Basketball Association (VBA), with his father the general manager of the VBA at the time. After graduating from [[Albert Park College]], Gaze pursued a professional basketball career and attended [[Victoria University, Australia|Victoria University]] in Melbourne.\n\n==Playing career==\n===NBL and college===\nIn 1984, Gaze joined the [[Melbourne Tigers]] of the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] as an 18-year-old. His first season with the Tigers saw him win the [[NBL Rookie of the Year Award]] after averaging an impressive 29.1 points, 6.7 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 1.6 steals in 24 games.<ref name=\"nbl-stats\">[http://www.foxsportspulse.com/team_info.cgi?action=PSTATS&pID=190395826&client=0-189-12322-125703-369917 Player statistics for Andrew Gaze]</ref> By 1986, he made his first [[All-NBL Team|All-NBL First Team]] selection. He would go on to earn first-team honours in 15 straight seasons (1986\u20132000). In the [[1987 NBL season]], Gaze set an NBL record for points per game in a season when he averaged 44.1 points. This was despite the Tigers finishing the season in last place with a 3\u201323 record. During the season, Gaze had a 60-point game (against the [[Newcastle Falcons (basketball)|Newcastle Falcons]]) and another five 50-point games.\n\nFollowing the [[1988 NBL season]], Gaze, who was spotted by talent scouts while playing for Australia at the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]], moved to the United States after being recruited to play [[college basketball]] for [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall University]]. During the 1988\u201389 season, Gaze played in 38 games for the Seton Hall Pirates, averaging 13.6 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game.<ref>[https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/andrew-gaze-1.html Andrew Gaze College Stats]</ref> Gaze started every game in The Hall's [[1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|first-ever run to the NCAA Final Four]], twice leading all Pirates scorers with 19 points in their Elite Eight win over [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels men's basketball|UNLV]] and 20 points (highlighted by 4-from-9 shooting from 3) in the National Semifinal win against [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]. He completed his season at Seton Hall with an 80\u201379 overtime loss to the [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan Wolverines]] in the NCAA Championship Game which was played in front of 39,187 fans at the [[Kingdome]] in [[Seattle]], where he was heavily guarded and limited to only five field goal attempts, all from three-point range. After a year in New Jersey, Gaze returned to Australia and re-joined the Tigers for the [[1989 NBL season]].<ref name=\"Gaze Is Gone But Questions Arise\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/14/sports/gaze-is-gone-but-questions-arise.html Gaze Is Gone But Questions Arise]</ref> He missed the back-end of the [[1990 NBL season]] due to a blood clot in his right shoulder.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-09-11-sp-434-story.html THE SIDELINES : Clot Hospitalizes Andrew Gaze]</ref>\n\nNot known for being an outstanding athlete, Gaze's heavy scoring in the NBL was due to exceptional shooting, including from three-point range. A crowd favourite to the Tigers faithful, Gaze was a front runner in the league's resurgence during the 1990s, as he and American import [[Lanard Copeland]] combined to form a formidable backcourt and guided the Tigers to two championships in 1993 and 1997.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ9Yd5upYr0 Andrew Gaze and Lanard Copeland]</ref> Playing under his father with the Tigers, Gaze assured the team were perpetual finalists.\n\nIn his later years, Gaze still managed to score at a high clip for the Tigers, averaging over 19 points per game in each of his last four NBL seasons. Following the [[2004\u201305 NBL season]], Gaze announced his retirement from the NBL. In 20 seasons with the Tigers, he played a total of 612 games and recorded 18,908 points at an average of 30.9 points per game.<ref name=\"nbl-stats\" />\n\n===Europe and NBA===\nIn addition to playing in the NBL, Gaze spent multiple seasons overseas during the 1990s. In 1991, Gaze became the first Australian to play professionally in Europe, with [[Serie A2 Basket|Italian 2nd League]] club [[Pallalcesto Amatori Udine|Udine]]. In a six-month stint in Italy, he averaged over 30 points per game.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100818154617/http://www.musictheatreaustralia.com.au/component/entertainers/andrew_gaze/4779 Andrew Gaze \u2013 Music Theatre Australia]</ref>Despite his best efforts, the team finished the league last and was relegated to the [[Serie B Basket|3rd division]]. In March 1994, Gaze returned to the United States and signed with the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Washington Bullets]]. In seven games for the Bullets during the [[1993\u201394 NBA season]], he averaged 3.1 points per game. In early 1995, he moved to Greece and played half a season for [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] club [[Apollon Patras B.C.|Apollon Patras]].<ref>[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.sport.basketball.misc/-9Y_MX8v7ts Andrew Gaze playing in Greece]</ref> He had another short stint in the NBA during the lockout-shortened [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]], this time with the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. He received very little court time for a stacked [[1998\u201399 San Antonio Spurs season|Spurs team]] that included guards [[Mario Elie]], [[Avery Johnson]], [[Antonio Daniels]] and [[Steve Kerr]]. He appeared in just 19 games for the Spurs during the regular season and was inactive for the entire [[1999 NBA Playoffs|playoff run]], which saw the Spurs win their first [[1999 NBA Finals|NBA championship]].<ref>[https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/gazean01.html Andrew Gaze NBA Stats]</ref>\n\n===National team===\nOn the international stage, Gaze forged his reputation as one of Australia's finest products, appearing at the [[Basketball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games]], as a 19-year-old. He led all scorers at the [[1994 FIBA World Championship]] with 23.9 points per game, leading the Aussies to a fifth-place finish. In [[Basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2000]], he became (jointly with American [[Teresa Edwards]]) the third basketball player to compete at [[List of athletes with the most appearances at Olympic Games|five Olympics]], after Puerto Rican [[Te\u00f3filo Cruz]] and Brazilian [[Oscar Schmidt]]. That year, Gaze was the [[List of flag bearers for Australia at the Olympics|flag bearer]] at the [[2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2000 Sydney Olympics|Sydney Olympics]], and he was also the Australian [[captain (sports)|Team Captain]]. At the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Atlanta Olympics]], he led the [[Australia men's national basketball team|Boomers]] to their best Olympic performance, a fourth-placed finish, with a 5\u20133 record.<ref>[https://www.basketball-reference.com/olympics/athletes/andrew-gaze-1 Andrew Gaze Olympic Stats]</ref>\n\nGaze also competed in four [[FIBA World Cup]]s with the Boomers, as he played in more than 280 [[cap (sports)|matches]] for Australia. Gaze is the second best all-time scorer in both major worldwide [[national team]] competitions, after Oscar Schmidt. He is the second all-time scorer, behind only Schmidt, in both [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics#Top 10 all-time cumulative scorers in men's basketball (through 2016 Olympics)|Summer Olympic Games history]], and [[FIBA Basketball World Cup records#Top 10 cumulative points scorers|FIBA World Cup history]].<ref>[http://corporate.olympics.com.au/athlete/andrew-gaze Australian Olympic Committee: Andrew Gaze]</ref>\n\n==Coaching career==\nOn 8 December 2015, Gaze was appointed head coach of the [[Melbourne Basketball Association|Melbourne Tigers]] [[South East Australian Basketball League|SEABL]] team for the 2016 season.<ref>[http://www.seabl.com.au/index.php?id=257&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=10449&cHash=e4ca4e0edb ANDREW GAZE ANNOUNCED AS MELBOURNE TIGERS HEAD COACH]</ref><ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/sport/basketball/andrew-gaze-to-coach-melbourne-tigers-in-seabl-but-nbl-dreams-remain-20151208-gliii5.html Andrew Gaze to coach Melbourne Tigers in SEABL but NBL dreams remain]</ref> Gaze's cousin, Mark,<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/sport/basketball/australian-basketballers-making-big-impression-in-us-college-system-20131116-2xnnn.html Australian basketballers making big impression in US college system]</ref> was appointed the Tigers' assistant coach.\n\nOn 2 April 2016, Gaze was appointed head coach of the [[Sydney Kings]] on a three-year deal, joining a revitalised franchise with a new general manager, a new owner and new home venue.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160414100325/http://www.sydneykings.com/uncategorised/sydney-kings-announce-andrew-gaze-as-new-head-coach/ SYDNEY KINGS ANNOUNCE ANDREW GAZE AS NEW HEAD COACH]</ref>\n\nIn June 2017, Gaze joined the [[Indiana Pacers]] as a member of their coaching staff for the [[2017 NBA Summer League|Orlando Summer League]].<ref>[http://www.nbl.com.au/featured-news/gaze-joins-indiana-pacers/ GAZE JOINS INDIANA PACERS]</ref>\n\nIn February 2018, the Kings confirmed Gaze as their head coach for the 2018\u201319 season.<ref>[https://www.foxsports.com.au/basketball/nbl/sydney-kings-confirm-andrew-gaze-as-head-coach-for-201819-nbl-season/news-story/d2a6e98e24700c65b2d646505c63cadc Sydney Kings confirm Andrew Gaze as head coach for 2018-19 NBL season]</ref> On 19 February 2019, it was announced that Gaze would step down as coach of the Kings at the conclusion of the team's finals campaign.<ref>[http://www.nbl.com.au/news/article/andrew-gaze-to-step-down-as-sydney-kings-coach-after-nbl19-finals Andrew Gaze To Step Down As Sydney Kings Coach After NBL19 Finals]</ref>\n\n==Off the court==\nAfter retiring from playing professionally, Gaze became a media personality and began commentating NBL games for [[Network Ten]] and [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]].

The series is named after the first novel, published in 1998. Twenty novels have been published in the series between 1998 and 2019.\n\nMma Precious Ramotswe is the main character in this series. The country of [[Botswana]] is in a sense a character as well, as it figures prominently in the stories. Mma Ramotswe starts up her detective agency when she is 34 years old, using the inheritance from her father to move to the capital city, [[Gaborone]], to buy a house for herself and an office for her new business. She feels a detective needs to know about people more than anything to solve problems for them. The novels are as much about the adventures and foibles of different characters as they are about [[Detective fiction|solving mysteries]]. Each book in the series follows from the previous book.  \n\nThe readership was at first small, then gained abruptly in popularity in the US and in England, beyond the author's home in Scotland. In 2004, sales in English exceeded five million, and the series has been translated to other languages. Critical reception has matched the sales of the novels, generally positive, and considering the strength of the novels to be in the characters and Mma Ramotswe's wisdom rather than in the specific mysteries solved in each novel.<ref name=OReilly2009 />\n\nThe novels have been adapted for radio by the author and for television.\n\n==Synopsis of series==\nThe main detective, Mma Ramotswe, is a [[Tswana people|Motswana]] woman who is the protagonist in the series and whose story is told in the first novel from birth to opening the detective agency. ''Mma'' is a [[Setswana]] term of respect for a woman; the equivalent term for a man is ''Rra''.\n\nMma Precious Ramotswe solves cases for wives whose husbands have gone missing, for a school teacher whose son has disappeared by finding the kidnappers, for a wealthy father whose 16-year-old daughter is frustrating him by going out on her own. She helps a man atone for the sins of his youth by finding the people he hurt decades earlier. She uncovers a scheme by twin brothers to use one medical degree and certificate between the two of them. She solves a case for herself when she thinks she must seek a divorce from her first husband but learns differently when she seeks out his mother. Her personal life has a main sorrow, that her only child lived just a few days, as the child's father beat her during the pregnancy, a story told in retrospect. This led her to decide never to marry again after he left her. Her joy is her engagement and eventual marriage to Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, who has taken on foster care of a sister and brother from the orphan farm. The cases are set in the cities of Botswana, mainly on the edge of the Kalahari desert, rather than in the desert. There are occasional forays into neighbouring nations.\n\nAfter her first few cases, she purchases a book by Clovis Andersen on detection, ''The Principles of Private Detection'', and then quotes from it throughout the novels when a guide is needed for deciding next steps.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe readership was at first small, then gained abruptly in popularity in the US and in England, beyond the author's home in Scotland. The initial books were published in Scotland.\n\nPer ''Kirkus Reviews'', the early novels in this series had their American publication later than in the UK, which published the first in 1998, the second in 2000, and the third, ''Morality for Beautiful Girls'', in 2001. The first three novels appeared in 2002 in the USA. In their review of the first novel in the series, ''Kirkus Reviews'' notes that \"The first American publication of this 1999 debut has been preceded by two special Booker citations and two sequels, ''Tears of the Giraffe'' (2000) and ''Morality for Beautiful Girls'' (2001), both forthcoming in the series.\"<ref name=Kirkus>{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/alexander-mccall-smith-13/the-no-1-ladies-detective-agency/ |title=The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency |publisher=Kirkus Reviews |date=2001 |accessdate=23 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AEFReVbOTXgC&pg=PP8&lpg=PP8&dq=First+Anchor+edition+Tears+of+the+Giraffe+Alexander+McCall+Smith&source=bl&ots=M4vlXLm5E5&sig=e_IwpEai6v7wfpQeda5rVigbpMQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjykbChgcrNAhUIOyYKHfOPCEEQ6AEINTAE#v=onepage&q=First%20Anchor%20edition%20Tears%20of%20the%20Giraffe%20Alexander%20McCall%20Smith&f=false |title=Tears of the Giraffe |author=McCall Smith, Alexander |date=August 2002 |edition=First Anchor Books |publisher=Anchor, Random House |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4000-3135-1 |accessdate=28 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn an item from the [[Wisconsin Public Radio]] program, ''[[To the Best of Our Knowledge]]'', the first novel \"''The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency'', was a surprise hit [in Scotland], receiving two special Booker citations and a place on the Times Literary Supplement's International Books of the Year and the Millennium list.\" The UK success did not speed publishers to release it in the USA. \"American publishers were slow to take an interest, and by the time ''The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency'' was picked up by [[Pantheon Books]], Smith had already written two sequels.

In reviewing the fifth novel in the series, Marcel Berlins describes the pathway of the growing audience, requiring one to understand that although Scotland and England are part of the same kingdom, the residents do not read the same books at the same time. He notes in his review of ''[[The Full Cupboard of Life]]'' that it is the fifth in a series, but the first to be readily available in England, via the success of the series in the US. \"This novel by an eminent Scottish law professor about a woman detective in Botswana is the fifth in a series, the other four having largely escaped English attention (and availability). The Scots have had better luck: they've known about McCall Smith for several years, but it has taken his extraordinary and unexpected success in the US for word to have filtered back to England that he's a treasure of a writer whose books deserve immediate devouring.\"<ref name=Berlins2003>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jul/19/featuresreviews.guardianreview25 |title=Precious little happenings |last=Berlins |first=Marcel |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=25 August 2017 |date=18 July 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Reception and awards==\n<!--Need some text on the review of the series in general with highlights on individual books -->\nThe novels are as much about the adventures and foibles of different characters as they are about [[Detective fiction|solving mysteries]].

His humour is dry, charming and kind-hearted, revealing an author who is keenly observant without a trace of maliciousness.\"<ref name=OReilly2009>{{cite web |url=https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/alexander-mccall-smith |title=Alexander McCall Smith: Critical Perspective |first=Elizabeth |last=O\u2019Reilly |year=2009 |accessdate=23 August 2017 |publisher=British Council on Literature}}</ref>\n\nMarcel Berlins finds the protagonist of ''[[The Full Cupboard of Life]]'' to be the \"magnificent Mma Ramotswe\" who operates on intuition and common sense, skilled without much education or special training. He mentions that McCall Smith's novels have brought attention to a successful African nation that is not otherwise well-known. He finds this and the prior novels to be \"witty, elegant, gentle, compassionate and exotic.\"<ref name=Berlins2003 /> This was the first of the novels available in England (see Publication history).

'Traditionally built' [[heroine]] and protagonist of the series.\n* '''Mma Grace Makutsi''', the agency's only employee, first as secretary, then as assistant detective, and then associate detective, then partner in business.\n* '''Mr J.L.B. Matekoni''', mechanic and proprietor of [[Tlokweng]] Road Speedy Motors, Mma Ramotswe's suitor and eventual husband. He is always referred to in these novels by this very formal title (he even refers to himself by that name). His full name is John Limpopo Basil Matekoni, and (according to a radio interview with the author on BBC World Service) he is embarrassed by the Basil.\n\n===Secondary===\n* '''Obed Ramotswe''', father of Precious, known to her as the Daddy. He worked in the mines in his younger days, then came home to raise his daughter and continue increasing his herd of cattle. He was known for his keen eye for the best cattle, and bred some of his own. He tells his own story in the first novel, and is mentioned often by Mma Ramotswe throughout the series.\n* '''Charlie''', the older of the two apprentices in Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni's garage. He is later cut from his apprenticeship and joins the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency as a Jr Assistant Detective.\n* '''Fanwell''', the younger apprentice, is only referred to as the \"younger apprentice\" in the earlier novels. His name is not mentioned until ''[[Tea Time for the Traditionally Built]]''. He lives in a small house with his grandmother and his several younger brothers and sisters. Although he is slightly more serious than his older friend, Charlie, he still frequently discusses girls with Charlie. He eventually becomes a mechanic in ''[[The Limpopo Academy of Private Detection]]''.\n* '''Mr Polopetsi''', an assistant to Mma Ramotswe and Mr J.L.B. Matekoni. He is introduced in ''[[In The Company of Cheerful Ladies]]''. After disappearing from the series, he returns in 'The Woman Who Walked In Sunshine. It is announced that he has become an assistant Chemistry teacher at a local secondary school, but comes back to work at the agency part time whilst Mma Ramotswe is on her holiday.\n* '''Phuti Radiphuti''', Grace Makutsi's fianc\u00e9, introduced in ''[[In The Company of Cheerful Ladies]]''. In ''[[The Double Comfort Safari Club]]'', he has an accident in which he loses his foot, which causes Mma Makutsi to worry about their relationship. They are finally married in ''[[The Saturday Big Tent Wedding Party]]''.\n* '''Violet Sephotho''', Mma Makutsi's rival from the Botswana Secretarial College, introduced in ''[[In the Company of Cheerful Ladies]]''. She returns in most books subsequent to her introduction with new schemes to ruin Mma Makutsi's life with Rra Phuti Radiphuti. In ''The Saturday Big Tent Wedding Party'', she is discussed as running for parliament in an upcoming by-election but makes no direct appearance. In ''[[The Minor Adjustment Beauty Salon]]'' she is named as the owner of the dress shop Botswana Elegance, but again makes no direct appearance.\n* '''Dr Moffat,''' The doctor and his wife are good friends of Mma Ramotswe, and he treats Mr J.L.B. Matekoni when he falls into a deep depression. He is based on a real person, Howard Moffat, a direct descendant of [[Robert Moffat (missionary)|Robert Moffat]], the Scottish missionary whose daughter [[Mary Livingstone (n\u00e9e Moffat)|Mary]] married [[David Livingstone]]. \n* '''Mma Silvia Potokwani''', matron of the 'Orphan Farm', always ready to offer wisdom, bush tea and fruit cake to Mma Ramotswe. Mma Potokwani is effective in achieving her goals for the orphans and the orphan farm. This skill has Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni doing mechanical repairs for free and later taking on two foster children. She has lots of family on her husband's side; Mma Ramotswe meets Comfort Potokwani and another Mma Potokwani in the sixteenth novel of the series.\n* '''Note Mokoti''', Mma Precious Ramotswe's former husband and father of her short-lived baby.  Note treated Mma Ramotswe poorly and Precious says that marrying him was a mistake. Later she learns he was married to another woman at the time of their marriage, so she has no need of divorce prior to her marriage to Matekoni.\n* '''Motholeli''' and '''Puso''', Ramotswe and Mr J.L.B. Matekoni's two adopted children. \n* '''Clovis Andersen''', an American, author of the self-published ''The Principles of Private Detection'' and idol of both Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi. He arrives for a visit in ''[[The Limpopo Academy of Private Detection]]'' and his presence helps to solve a very personal case.\n* '''Itumelang Clovis Radiphuti''' infant son of Mma Makutsi and Phuti Radiphuti, born three weeks premature in ''[[The Minor Adjustment Beauty Salon]]''. Charlie, who often argues with Mma Makutsi, stated that Itumelang was a '100%' baby. Fanwell is also fond of the child.\n\n==Settings==\n* [[Gaborone]]\n* [[Mochudi]]\n* [[Molepolole]]\n* [[Francistown]]\n\n==Themes and topics of the stories==\n* Women in traditional vs. nontraditional occupations, and [[feminism]]\n* [[Rural]] way of life in [[southern Africa]], including [[muti]], vs [[urbanity]] and [[modernity]]\n* Social relations in traditional African society\n* Christianity and traditional belief systems in contemporary Africa\n* [[AIDS]] and AIDS orphans in [[Sub-saharan Africa|sub-Saharan Africa]]\n* [[Clinical depression]]\n* [[Emotional intelligence]], [[moral philosophy]] and [[virtue ethics]]\n* [[Tradesman|Craftsmanship]] and [[mechanic]]s\n\n==Issues addressed in the cases==\n* [[Domestic violence]]\n* [[Forgiveness]] and [[restitution]]\n* [[Adultery|Marital infidelity]]\n\n==Series order==\n# ''[[The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency (novel)|The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency]]'' (1998)\n# ''[[Tears of the Giraffe]]'' (2000)\n# ''[[Morality for Beautiful Girls]]'' (2001)\n# ''[[The Kalahari Typing School for Men]]'' (2002)\n# ''[[The Full Cupboard of Life]]'' (2004)\n# ''[[In The Company of Cheerful Ladies]]''  (2004 \u2013 also known as ''The Night-Time Dancer'')\n# ''[[Blue Shoes and Happiness]]'' (2006)\n# ''[[The Good Husband of Zebra Drive]]'' (2007)\n# ''[[The Miracle at Speedy Motors]]'' (2008)\n# ''[[Tea Time for the Traditionally Built]]'' (2009)\n# ''[[The Double Comfort Safari Club]]'' (2010)\n# ''[[The Saturday Big Tent Wedding Party]]'' (2011)\n# ''[[The Limpopo Academy of Private Detection]]'' (2012)\n# ''[[The Minor Adjustment Beauty Salon]]'' (2013)\n# ''[[The Handsome Man's De Luxe Cafe]]'' (2014)\n# ''[[The Woman Who Walked in Sunshine]]'' (2015)\n# ''[[Precious and Grace]]'' (2016)\n# ''[[The House of Unexpected Sisters]]'' (2017)\n# ''[[The Colours of All the Cattle]]'' (2018)\n# ''[[To the Land of Long Lost Friends]]'' (2019)\n\n==Adaptations==\n\nThe novels have been adapted for radio by the author and for television.\n\n===Television===\n{{main|The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency (TV series)}}\nThe [[BBC]] and American television network [[HBO]] filmed a series based on the books that stars [[Jill Scott]] as Mma Ramotswe and was shot on location in Botswana.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Unusual Sleuth, Unusual Setting |first=Ginia |last=Bellafante |date=March 26, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/27/arts/television/27ladi.html?_r=0 |accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> The 109-minute pilot was written by [[Richard Curtis]] and [[Anthony Minghella]], who also directed.<ref name=NYT/> The six 60-minute episodes were written and directed by others, as Mr Minghella died before the series was filmed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1161590/Move-Miss-Marple--Jill-Scott-Mma-Ramotswe-new-series-The-No-1-Ladies-Detective-Agency.html |title=Move over Miss Marple...

Detective Agency''''' is a series of novels by [[Alexander McCall Smith]] set in Botswana and featuring the character Mma Precious Ramotswe. The series is named after the first novel, published in 1998. Twenty novels have been published in the series between 1998 and 2019.\n\nMma Precious Ramotswe is the main character in this series. The country of [[Botswana]] is in a sense a character as well, as it figures prominently in the stories. Mma Ramotswe starts up her detective agency when she is 34 years old, using the inheritance from her father to move to the capital city, [[Gaborone]], to buy a house for herself and an office for her new business. She feels a detective needs to know about people more than anything to solve problems for them. The novels are as much about the adventures and foibles of different characters as they are about [[Detective fiction|solving mysteries]]. Each book in the series follows from the previous book.  \n\nThe readership was at first small, then gained abruptly in popularity in the US and in England, beyond the author's home in Scotland. In 2004, sales in English exceeded five million, and the series has been translated to other languages. Critical reception has matched the sales of the novels, generally positive, and considering the strength of the novels to be in the characters and Mma Ramotswe's wisdom rather than in the specific mysteries solved in each novel.<ref name=OReilly2009 />\n\nThe novels have been adapted for radio by the author and for television.\n\n==Synopsis of series==\nMma Ramotswe is a [[Tswana people|Motswana]] woman who is the protagonist in the series and whose story is told in the first novel from birth to opening the detective agency. The main detective. ''Mma'' is a [[Setswana]] term of respect for a woman; the equivalent term for a man is ''Rra''.\n\nMma Precious Ramotswe solves cases for wives whose husbands have gone missing, for a school teacher whose son has disappeared by finding the kidnappers, for a wealthy father whose 16-year-old daughter is frustrating him by going out on her own. She helps a man atone for the sins of his youth by finding the people he hurt decades earlier. She uncovers a scheme by twin brothers to use one medical degree and certificate between the two of them. She solves a case for herself when she thinks she must seek a divorce from her first husband but learns differently when she seeks out his mother. Her personal life has a main sorrow, that her only child lived just a few days, as the child's father beat her during the pregnancy, a story told in retrospect. This led her to decide never to marry again after he left her. Her joy is her engagement and eventual marriage to Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, who has taken on foster care of a sister and brother from the orphan farm. The cases are set in the cities of Botswana, mainly on the edge of the Kalahari desert, rather than in the desert. There are occasional forays into neighbouring nations.\n\nAfter her first few cases, she purchases a book by Clovis Andersen on detection, ''The Principles of Private Detection'', and then quotes from it throughout the novels when a guide is needed for deciding next steps.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe readership was at first small, then gained abruptly in popularity in the US and in England, beyond the author's home in Scotland. The initial books were published in Scotland.\n\nPer ''Kirkus Reviews'', the early novels in this series had their American publication later than in the UK, which published the first in 1998, the second in 2000, and the third, ''Morality for Beautiful Girls'', in 2001. The first three novels appeared in 2002 in the USA. In their review of the first novel in the series, ''Kirkus Reviews'' notes that \"The first American publication of this 1999 debut has been preceded by two special Booker citations and two sequels, ''Tears of the Giraffe'' (2000) and ''Morality for Beautiful Girls'' (2001), both forthcoming in the series.\"<ref name=Kirkus>{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/alexander-mccall-smith-13/the-no-1-ladies-detective-agency/ |title=The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency |publisher=Kirkus Reviews |date=2001 |accessdate=23 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AEFReVbOTXgC&pg=PP8&lpg=PP8&dq=First+Anchor+edition+Tears+of+the+Giraffe+Alexander+McCall+Smith&source=bl&ots=M4vlXLm5E5&sig=e_IwpEai6v7wfpQeda5rVigbpMQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjykbChgcrNAhUIOyYKHfOPCEEQ6AEINTAE#v=onepage&q=First%20Anchor%20edition%20Tears%20of%20the%20Giraffe%20Alexander%20McCall%20Smith&f=false |title=Tears of the Giraffe |author=McCall Smith, Alexander |date=August 2002 |edition=First Anchor Books |publisher=Anchor, Random House |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4000-3135-1 |accessdate=28 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn an item from the [[Wisconsin Public Radio]] program, ''[[To the Best of Our Knowledge]]'', the first novel \"''The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency'', was a surprise hit [in Scotland], receiving two special Booker citations and a place on the Times Literary Supplement's International Books of the Year and the Millennium list.\" The UK success did not speed publishers to release it in the USA. \"American publishers were slow to take an interest, and by the time ''The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency'' was picked up by [[Pantheon Books]], Smith had already written two sequels. The books went from underground hits to national phenomena in the United States, spawning fan clubs and inspiring celebratory reviews.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ttbook.org/alexander-mccall-smith |title=Alexander McCall Smith |accessdate=July 9, 2016 |publisher=To the Best of Our Knowledge}}</ref>\n\n''[[In the Company of Cheerful Ladies]]'' was the first of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency novels to be printed in hardback, with a very large initial print run of 101,000 copies to meet the anticipated demand, as sales in English of the series to date, in 2004, exceeded five million.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/precious-success-puts-publisher-in-major-league-1-549761 |newspaper=The Scotsman |title=Precious success puts publisher in major league |date=17 August 2004}}</ref>\n\nThere was an interesting pathway for knowledge and appreciation of the series by McCall Smith, a Scot, featuring Precious Ramotswe, the female detective in Botswana, to reach England. In reviewing the fifth novel in the series, Marcel Berlins describes the pathway of the growing audience, requiring one to understand that although Scotland and England are part of the same kingdom, the residents do not read the same books at the same time. He notes in his review of ''[[The Full Cupboard of Life]]'' that it is the fifth in a series, but the first to be readily available in England, via the success of the series in the US. \"This novel by an eminent Scottish law professor about a woman detective in Botswana is the fifth in a series, the other four having largely escaped English attention (and availability). The Scots have had better luck: they've known about McCall Smith for several years, but it has taken his extraordinary and unexpected success in the US for word to have filtered back to England that he's a treasure of a writer whose books deserve immediate devouring.\"<ref name=Berlins2003>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jul/19/featuresreviews.guardianreview25 |title=Precious little happenings |last=Berlins |first=Marcel |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=25 August 2017 |date=18 July 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Reception and awards==\n<!--Need some text on the review of the series in general with highlights on individual books -->\nThe novels are as much about the adventures and foibles of different characters as they are about [[Detective fiction|solving mysteries]]. Each novel in the series follows on from the previous one as to setting and plot.<!--Removed ref to episodic novels, it does not apply to this series by McCall Smith. see https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/alexander-mccall-smith for a brief literary review of each of his series.--> McCall Smith's writing style in this series is \"deceptively simple\" as he \"writes in a clear, uncomplicated prose, yet his work is nonetheless insightful and perceptive. His humour is dry, charming and kind-hearted, revealing an author who is keenly observant without a trace of maliciousness.\"<ref name=OReilly2009>{{cite web |url=https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/alexander-mccall-smith |title=Alexander McCall Smith: Critical Perspective |first=Elizabeth |last=O\u2019Reilly |year=2009 |accessdate=23 August 2017 |publisher=British Council on Literature}}</ref>\n\nMarcel Berlins finds the protagonist of ''[[The Full Cupboard of Life]]'' to be the \"magnificent Mma Ramotswe\" who operates on intuition and common sense, skilled without much education or special training. He mentions that McCall Smith's novels have brought attention to a successful African nation that is not otherwise well-known. He finds this and the prior novels to be \"witty, elegant, gentle, compassionate and exotic.\"<ref name=Berlins2003 /> This was the first of the novels available in England (see Publication history). Despite its proximity to Scotland, awareness and availability of the novels in England came after their popularity in the US.<ref name=Berlins2003 />\n\nThe novels have been reviewed in other languages than the original English; for example, this generally favourable review of the series up to the novel published in 2014, ''[[The Handsome Man's De Luxe Caf\u00e9]]'', in a Czech online magazine: \"Alexander McCall Smith, however, can enrich the stories of his everyday heroes with a profoundly human understanding of man's weaknesses\".<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.velka-britanie.co.uk/the-number-1-ladies-detective-agency/ |title=Alexander McCall Smith a jeho Prvn\u00ed d\u00e1msk\u00e1 detektivn\u00ed kancel\u00e1\u0159 |trans-title=The No. 1 Ladies\u2019 Detective Agency by Alexander McCall Smith |first=Eva |last=Sercombe |journal=Velk\u00e1 Brit\u00e1nie |date=7 December 2015 |accessdate=6 December 2016 |language=Czech}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the year of the sixth novel's publication, Alexander McCall Smith won the Author of the Year award at the [[British Book Awards]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/alexander-mccall-smith |title=Alexander McCall Smith Awards 2004 |work=British Council, Literature |accessdate=8 October 2016}}</ref> and the [[Crime Writers Association]] Dagger in the Library award,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecwa.co.uk/alexander-mccall-smith/ |title=Dagger in the Library Award 2004 |work=Crime Writers Association |accessdate=8 October 2016}}</ref> both for the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series.\n\n==Characters in the series==\n===Main===\n* '''Mma Precious Ramotswe''', the first female [[private investigator]] in Botswana.

He worked in the mines in his younger days, then came home to raise his daughter and continue increasing his herd of cattle.

He is later cut from his apprenticeship and joins the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency as a Jr Assistant Detective.\n* '''Fanwell''', the younger apprentice, is only referred to as the \"younger apprentice\" in the earlier novels. His name is not mentioned until ''[[Tea Time for the Traditionally Built]]''. He lives in a small house with his grandmother and his several younger brothers and sisters. Although he is slightly more serious than his older friend, Charlie, he still frequently discusses girls with Charlie. He eventually becomes a mechanic in ''[[The Limpopo Academy of Private Detection]]''.\n* '''Mr Polopetsi''', an assistant to Mma Ramotswe and Mr J.L.B. Matekoni. He is introduced in ''[[In The Company of Cheerful Ladies]]''. After disappearing from the series, he returns in 'The Woman Who Walked In Sunshine. It is announced that he has become an assistant Chemistry teacher at a local secondary school, but comes back to work at the agency part time whilst Mma Ramotswe is on her holiday.\n* '''Phuti Radiphuti''', Grace Makutsi's fianc\u00e9, introduced in ''[[In The Company of Cheerful Ladies]]''.

They are finally married in ''[[The Saturday Big Tent Wedding Party]]''.\n* '''Violet Sephotho''', Mma Makutsi's rival from the Botswana Secretarial College, introduced in ''[[In the Company of Cheerful Ladies]]''. She returns in most books subsequent to her introduction with new schemes to ruin Mma Makutsi's life with Rra Phuti Radiphuti. In ''The Saturday Big Tent Wedding Party'', she is discussed as running for parliament in an upcoming by-election but makes no direct appearance. In ''[[The Minor Adjustment Beauty Salon]]'' she is named as the owner of the dress shop Botswana Elegance, but again makes no direct appearance.\n* '''Dr Moffat,''' The doctor and his wife are good friends of Mma Ramotswe, and he treats Mr J.L.B. Matekoni when he falls into a deep depression. He is based on a real person, Howard Moffat, a direct descendant of [[Robert Moffat (missionary)|Robert Moffat]], the Scottish missionary whose daughter [[Mary Livingstone (n\u00e9e Moffat)|Mary]] married [[David Livingstone]]. \n* '''Mma Silvia Potokwani''', matron of the 'Orphan Farm', always ready to offer wisdom, bush tea and fruit cake to Mma Ramotswe. Mma Potokwani is effective in achieving her goals for the orphans and the orphan farm. This skill has Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni doing mechanical repairs for free and later taking on two foster children. She has lots of family on her husband's side; Mma Ramotswe meets Comfort Potokwani and another Mma Potokwani in the sixteenth novel of the series.\n* '''Note Mokoti''', Mma Precious Ramotswe's former husband and father of her short-lived baby.  Note treated Mma Ramotswe poorly and Precious says that marrying him was a mistake. Later she learns he was married to another woman at the time of their marriage, so she has no need of divorce prior to her marriage to Matekoni.\n* '''Motholeli''' and '''Puso''', Ramotswe and Mr J.L.B. Matekoni's two adopted children. \n* '''Clovis Andersen''', an American, author of the self-published ''The Principles of Private Detection'' and idol of both Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi. He arrives for a visit in ''[[The Limpopo Academy of Private Detection]]'' and his presence helps to solve a very personal case.\n* '''Itumelang Clovis Radiphuti''' infant son of Mma Makutsi and Phuti Radiphuti, born three weeks premature in ''[[The Minor Adjustment Beauty Salon]]''. Charlie, who often argues with Mma Makutsi, stated that Itumelang was a '100%' baby.
