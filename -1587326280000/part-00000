{"title_page": "Ross, Scotland", "text_new": "{{About|the region|other uses|Ross (disambiguation)#United Kingdom}}\n[[Image:Ross (district).PNG|thumb|right|300px|Map of [[Scotland]] showing the historic district of Ross]]\n\n'''Ross'''  (''Ros'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]]) is a region of [[Scotland]], a former [[Earl of Ross|earldom]] and, under the name [[Ross and Cromarty]], a [[Counties of Scotland|county]]. The name ''Ross'' allegedly derives from a [[Goidelic|Gaelic]] word meaning \"headland\", perhaps a reference to the [[Black Isle]]. Another possible origin is the [[Old Norse language|West Norse]] word for [[Orkney]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''Hrossey''&nbsp;\u2013 meaning ''horse island''; the area once belonged to the [[Norway|Norwegian]] ([[West Norse]]) [[earldom]] of Orkney. Ross is a historical comital region, perhaps predating the [[Mormaerdom of Ross]].  It is also a region used by the [[Church of Scotland|Church]], with the [[Presbytery of Ross]] being part of the [[Synod of Ross, Sutherland and Caithness]].\n\n== History ==\n\nExcavations of a rock shelter and shell [[midden]] at [[Sand, Applecross]] on the coast of [[Wester Ross]] have shown that the coast was occupied by [[Mesolithic]] hunter-gatherers.\n\nIt may be doubted whether the [[Roman empire|Roman]]s ever effected even a temporary settlement in the area of the modern county. In Roman times, and for long afterwards, the land was occupied by [[Picts]], who, in the 6th and 7th centuries, were [[Christianization|converted to Christianity]] by followers of Saint [[Columba]]. Throughout the next three centuries the natives were continually harassed by Norwegian [[Viking Age|Viking]] raiders, of whose presence tokens have survived in several place-names ([[Dingwall]], [[Tain]], and others). At this time the country formed part of the great province of [[Moray]] (Latin: ''Moravia''), which then extended as far as the [[Dornoch Firth]] and the Oykel, and included practically the whole of Ross and Cromarty.\n\nWilliam, the 4th [[Earl of Ross]], was present with his [[Clan Ross|clan]] at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] (1314), and almost a century later (1412) the castle of Dingwall, the chief seat on the mainland of Donald, [[Lord of the Isles]], was captured after the disastrous fight at [[Battle of Harlaw|Harlaw]] in [[Aberdeenshire (traditional)|Aberdeenshire]], which Donald had provoked when his claim to the earldom was rejected. The earldom reverted to the crown in 1424, but [[James I of Scotland|James I]] soon afterwards restored it to the heiress of the line, the mother of Alexander Macdonald, 3rd [[Lord of the Isles]], who thus became the 11th Earl. In consequence, however, of the treason of John Macdonald, 4th and last Lord of the Isles and 12th Earl of Ross, the earldom was again vested in the crown (1476). Five years later [[James III of Scotland|James III]] bestowed it on his second son, [[James Stewart, Duke of Ross|James Stewart]], whom he also created Duke of Ross in 1488.\n\nBy the 16th century the whole area of the county was occupied by different [[Scottish clan|clans]]. The Rosses held what is now [[Easter Ross]]; the Munros the small tract around Ben Wyvis, including Dingwall; the Macleods [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], and, in the mainland, the district between Loch Maree and Loch Torridon; the Macdonalds of Glengarry, Coigach, and the district between Strome Ferry and Kyle of Lochalsh, and the Mackenzies the remainder.\n\nThe county of Ross was constituted in 1661, and Cromarty in 1685 and 1698, both being consolidated into the present county in 1889.\n\nApart from occasional conflicts between rival clans, the only battles in the county were at [[Battle of Carbisdale|Invercarron]], at the head of Dornoch Firth, when [[James Graham, Marquis of Montrose|Montrose]] was crushed by Colonel Archibald Strachan on 27 April 1650; and at [[Battle of Glenshiel|Glenshiel]], where the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], under the [[William Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Seaforth|Earl of Seaforth]], aided by Spaniards, were defeated by a force under the command of General [[Joseph Wightman (general)|Joseph Wightman]] on 10 June 1719.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Liathach from Beinn Eighe.jpg|thumb|left|Liathach seen from Beinn Eighe.

There are also a number of small islands off the area's west coast, among which are:\n\n* Gillean (lighthouse) in the parish of [[Loch Alsh|Lochalsh]]\n* [[Crowlin Islands]] in [[Applecross]]\n* [[Eilean Horrisdale]], and [[Isle of Ewe]] in [[Gairloch]] parish\n* [[Isle Martin]] and [[Tanera More]], of the [[Summer Isles]] group in the parish of [[Lochbroom (parish)|Lochbroom]]\n\nThe area of the mainland is {{convert|1572332|acre|ha|abbr=off}}.\n\nOn the North Sea (eastern) side of the county the major [[firth]]s are the Beauly Firth and the (Inner) [[Moray Firth]], which separate the [[Black Isle]] from [[Inverness-shire]]; the [[Cromarty Firth]], which bounds the districts of Easter Ross and the Black Isle; the Moray Firth, separating Easter Ross from [[Nairnshire]]; and the [[Dornoch Firth]], dividing north-east [[Ross-shire|Ross]] from Sutherland.\n\nOn the [[Atlantic (ocean)|Atlantic]] (western) coastline&mdash;which has a length of nearly {{convert|311|mi|km|abbr=off}}&mdash;the principal sea lochs and bays, from south to north, are [[Loch Duich]], [[Loch Alsh]], Loch Carron, Loch Kishorn, [[Loch Torridon]], Loch Shieldaig, Upper Loch Torridon, [[Gair Loch]], [[Loch Ewe]], [[Gruinard Bay]], [[Loch Broom]] and Enard Bay.\n\nThe chief capes include Tarbat Ness on the east coast, and Coigach, Greenstone Point, Rubha Reidh, [[Redpoint]] and Hamha Point on the west.\n\nAlmost all the southern boundary with Inverness-shire consists of a rampart of peaks, many of them [[Munro]]s:\n* [[An Riabhachan]] ({{convert|3704|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}),\n* [[Sgurr na Lapaich]] ({{convert|3773|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}),\n* [[Carn Eige]] (C\u00e0rn Eighe) ({{convert|3881|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}),\n* [[Mam Sodhail]] (Mam Soul) ({{convert|3871|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}),\n* [[Beinn Fhada]] (Ben Attow) ({{convert|3386|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}),\n* [[Sgurr Fhuaran]] ({{convert|3504|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}),\n* [[The Saddle]] ({{convert|3317|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}).\n\nTo the north of Glen [[Torridon]] are the masses of [[Liathach]] ({{convert|3455|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), [[Beinn Eighe]] ({{convert|3313|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), [[Beinn Alligin]] ({{convert|3235|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and [[Beinn Dearg (Torridon)|Beinn Dearg]] ({{convert|2998|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). On the northeastern shore of Loch Maree rises [[Slioch]] ({{convert|3219|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), while the Fannich group contains six Munros, the highest being Sgurr Mor ({{convert|3645|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). The immense isolated bulk of [[Ben Wyvis]] ({{convert|3428|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), forms the most noteworthy feature in the north-east, and [[An Teallach]] ({{convert|3484|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) in the north-west appears equally conspicuous, though less solitary. Only a small fraction of the west and south of the area is under {{convert|1000|ft|abbr=on}} in height. Easter Ross and the peninsula of the Black Isle are comparatively level.\n\nThe longest stream of the mainland portion of Ross and Cromarty is the River Orrin, which rises from the slopes of An Sidhean ({{convert|2671|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and pursues a north-easterly course to its confluence with the River Conon after a run of about {{convert|26|mi|km|abbr=on}}, a small part of which forms the boundary with Inverness-shire. At Aultgowrie the stream rushes through a narrow gorge where the drop is considerable enough to make the Falls of Orrin. The River Blackwater flows from mountains in [[Strathvaich]] southeast for {{convert|18|mi|km|abbr=on}} until it joins the Conon, forming soon after it leaves Loch Garve the small but picturesque Falls of Rogie. Within a short distance of its exit from Loch Luichart the Conon pours over a series of cascades and rapids and then pursues a winding course of {{convert|12|mi|km|abbr=on}}, mainly eastward to the head of the Cromarty Firth. Situated above Glen Elchaig in the southwest of the region are the Falls of Glomach. The stream giving rise to them drains a series of small lochs on the northern flanks of Beinn Fhada (Ben Attow) and, in an almost unbroken sheet over a metre in width, effects a sheer drop of 110 m, and soon afterwards ends its course in Glen Elchaig. The falls are usually visited from [[Invershiel]] 11&nbsp;km to the south-west. 12 miles south-east of Ullapool, on the estate of Braemore, are the Falls of Measach, formed by the Droma, a headstream of the River Broom. The cascades, three in number, are close to Corrieshalloch Gorge. The River Oykel, throughout its course, forms the boundary with Sutherland.\n[[Image:Slioch from Loch Maree.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Slioch seen from the shores of Loch Maree]]\nThere are many freshwater [[loch]]s, the largest being [[Loch Maree]]. In the far north-west, {{convert|243|ft|abbr=on}} above the sea, lies Loch Sionascaig, a loch of such irregularity of outline that it has a shore-line of {{convert|17|mi|km|abbr=on}}. It contains several wooded islands, and drains into Enard Bay by the River Polly. [[Lochan Fada]] (the long loch), {{convert|1000|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} above the sea, is {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on|0}} in length, and covers an area of {{convert|1112|acre}}, and is {{convert|42|fathom|m}} deep, with a mean depth of {{convert|17|fathom|m}}. Once drained by the Muice (Allt na Muice), it has been tapped a little farther west by the Abhainn na Fhasaigh, which has lowered the level of the loch. Other lochs are Fionn Loch (the white or clear lake), {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on|0}} long by {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on|0}} wide, famous for its [[heron]]s, Loch Luichart towards the centre of the area (8 miles long and between {{convert|1/2|-|1|mi|km|1|abbr=on}} wide), fringed with [[birch]]es and having the shape of a crescent, the mountain-girt Loch Fannich ({{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=or}} wide); and the wild narrow Lochs [[Loch Monar and Loch Mullardoch|Monar]] ({{convert|4|mi|km|disp=or|abbr=on|0}} long) and [[Loch Monar and Loch Mullardoch|Mullardoch]] ({{convert|5|mi|km|disp=or|abbr=on|0}} long), on the [[Inverness-shire]] boundary.\n\nOf the [[strath]]s or valleys, the more important run from the centre eastwards, such as Strathconon, Strathbran, Strathgarve, Strathpeffer and [[Strathcarron, Highland|Strathcarron]]. Excepting Glen Orrin, in the east central district, the longer glens lie in the south and towards the west. In the extreme south [[Glen Shiel]] runs between five mountains (the [[Five Sisters of Kintail]]) to its mouth on Loch Duich. The [[A87 road|A87]] passes down the glen. Further north lie Glen Elchaig, Glen Carron, and Glen Torridon. The railway from Dingwall runs through Glen Carron to [[Kyle of Lochalsh]].\n\n==Geology==\n\nThe central portion of this county is occupied by the younger highland [[schist]]s or Dalradian series. These consist of [[quartzite]]s, mica-schists, garnetiferous mica-schists and [[gneiss]]es, all with a gentle inclination towards the southeast. On the eastern side of the county the Dalradian schists are covered unconformably by the Old Red Sandstone. The boundary runs southward from Edderton on Dornoch Firth, by Strathpeffer, to the neighborhood of Beauly. These rocks comprise red flags and [[sandstone]]s, grey bituminous flags and [[shale]]s. An [[anticline|anticlinal]] fold with a southwest\u2013northeast axis brings up the basal beds of the series about the mouth of Cromarty Firth and exposes once more the schists in The Sutors (The Sutors of Cromarty) guarding the entrance to the firth. The western boundary of the younger schist is formed by the great [[pre-Cambrian]] dislocation line that traverses the county in a fairly direct course from Elphin on the north by [[Ullapool]] to Glencarron. Most of the area west of the line of disturbance is covered by [[Torridonian Sandstone]], mainly dark reddish sandstones, grits and shales, resting unconformably on the ancient [[Lewisian complex|Lewisian gneiss]] with horizontal or slightly inclined bedding. The unconformity is well exposed on the shores of Gairloch, Loch Maree and Loch Torridon. These rocks, which attain a considerable thickness and are divisible into three sub-groups, build up the mountain districts of Applecross, Coigach and elsewhere.\n\nWithin the Torridonian tract the older Lewisian gneiss occupies large areas north of Coigach, on the east of Enard Bay, between Gruinard Bay and Loch Maree. Between the last named and Gairloch, on both sides of middle Loch Torridon and at many other spots smaller patches appear. The Lewisian gneiss is everywhere penetrated by basic [[dike (geology)|dikes]], generally with a northwest\u2013southeast direction; some of these are of great breadth. The Torridonian rocks are succeeded unconformably by a series of Cambrian strata confined to a variable but narrow belt west of the line of main thrusting. This belt of Cambrian rocks has suffered an enormous amount of subordinate thrusting. It is composed of the following subdivisions in ascending order: falsebedded quartzite, Pipe Rock quartzite, fucoid beds and Olenellus band, serpulite grit, Durness [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] and [[marble]], Durness dolomite and [[limestone]]: but these are not always visible at any one spot. So great has been the disturbance in the region of thrusting that in some places, as in the neighborhood of Loch Kishorn and elsewhere, the rocks have been completely overturned and the ancient gneiss has been piled upon the Torridonian.\n\nOn the shore of [[Moray Firth]] at Rathie a small patch of Kimeridge shale occurs, and beneath the cliffs of Shandwick there is a little Lower Oolite with a thin seam of coal. Glacial striae are found upon the mountains up to heights of {{convert|3300|ft|abbr=on}}, and much boulder clay is found in the valleys and spread over large areas in the eastern districts. Raised beaches occur at up to {{convert|108|ft|abbr=on}} or so above the present sea-level; they are well seen in Loch Carron.\n\n==Climate and agriculture==\n\nThe west coast has high rainfall: an annual average of {{convert|50.42|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at Loch Broom and {{convert|62|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at [[Stromeferry|Strome Ferry]] (autumn and winter being the wettest seasons), but on the east coast the annual average is only {{convert|27|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The average daily maximum{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} temperature for the year is {{convert|46.5|F|C|order=flip}}.

As of 1911, among grain crops [[oat]]s were most generally cultivated, but [[barley]] and wheat were also raised. [[Turnip]]s and potatoes were the chief green{{clarify|date=April 2015}} [[Agriculture|crops]]. The higher land contains much good [[Pasture|pasturage]], with many sheep, blackfaced being the principal breed. Most of the horses, principally half-breds between the old [[garron]]s (hardy, serviceable, small animals) and [[Clydesdale horse|Clydesdale]]s, were maintained for the purposes of agriculture. The herds of cattle, mainly native [[Highland cattle|Highland]] or crosses, were large, many of them supplying the London market. Pigs were reared, though in smaller numbers than formerly, most generally by the [[croft (land)|croft]]ers.\n\nAs of 1911 about {{convert|800000|acre|ha|sigfig=1|abbr=off}} were devoted to deer forests, a greater area than in any other county in Scotland, among the largest being Achnashellach with {{convert|50000|acre|ha|sigfig=1|abbr=off}}, Fannich with {{convert|20000|acre|ha|sigfig=1|abbr=off}}, Kinlochluichart with {{convert|20600|acre|ha|sigfig=3|abbr=off}}, Braemore with {{convert|40000|acre|ha|abbr=off|sigfig=1}}, Inchbae with {{convert|21000|acre|ha|abbr=off|sigfig=2}} and Dundonnell with {{convert|23000|acre|ha|sigfig=2|abbr=off}}. At one time the area under wood must have been remarkable, if we accept the common derivation of the word \"Ross\" as from the Old Irish ''ros'', a wood, and there was until recent times a considerable extent of native woodland, principally [[Scots Pine|pine]], [[oak]], [[Ash tree|ash]] and [[alder]].\n\nThe [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]] was noteworthy. [[Red deer|Red]] and [[roe deer]] abounded, and [[fox]]es and [[Mountain hare|alpine hare]]s were common, while [[badger]]s and [[wild cat]]s were occasionally trapped. Winged [[Game (food)|game]] was plentiful, and amongst [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] the [[golden eagle]] and [[osprey]] occurred. [[Wildfowl|Waterfowl]] of all kinds frequented the [[sea loch]]s. Many rivers and lochs were rich in [[salmon]] and [[trout]], and the pearl [[mussel]] was found in the bed of the Conon.\n\n== Other industries ==\n\nTourism is a major industry in the region, with over 20% of the workforce employed in the wholesale, restaurant and hotels sector, second only to the public service sector. A little over 5% of the workforce are employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing, traditionally major industries in the region. The oil industry, which spurred a rapid increase in industrial development in the 1970s, is in decline, although still a major employer.\n\nThe Glen Ord and [[Glenmorangie]] distilleries are prominent whisky distilleries.\n\nA railway, the [[Far North Line]] from [[Inverness]], enters the county to the north of [[Beauly]] and runs northwards through Dingwall and onwards to Tain and along the southerly bank of the Dornoch Firth. From there the single-track line continues north/northeast through Sutherland to [[Thurso]] and [[Wick, Caithness|Wick]] in [[Caithness]]. The [[Kyle of Lochalsh Line]] runs  west/southwest from Dingwall to the [[Kyle of Lochalsh]].\n\n==Antiquities==\n\nThe principal relics of antiquity - mainly [[stone circle]]s, [[cairn]]s and [[Fortification|forts]] - appear in the eastern district. A vitrified fort crowns the hill of Knockfarrel in the parish of Fodderty, and there is a circular [[dun]] near the village of [[Lochcarron]]. Some fine examples of sculptured stones occur, especially those that, according to tradition, mark the burial-place of the three sons of a Danish king who were shipwrecked off the coast of Nigg. The largest and handsomest of these three crosses - the Clach a' Charraidh, or Stone of Lamentation - stands at Shandwick. It is about 10 feet (3 m) high and contains representations of the martyrdom of St Andrew and figures of an elephant and dog. It fell during a storm in 1847 and was broken in three pieces. On the top of the cross in Nigg churchyard are two figures with outstretched arms in the act of supplication; the dove descends between them, and below are two dogs. The cross was knocked down by the fall of the belfry in 1725, but has been riveted together. The third stone formerly stood at Hilton of Cadboll, but was removed for security to the grounds of Invergordon Castle.\n\nAmong old castles are those of Lochslin, in the parish of Fearn, said to date from the 13th century, which, though ruinous, possesses two square towers in good preservation; Balone, in the parish of Tarbat, once a stronghold of the Earls of Ross; the remains of Dingwall Castle, their original seat; and [[Eilean Donan]] in Loch Alsh, which was blown up by British warships during the [[Jacobitism|abortive Jacobite rising]] in 1719.\n\n== Local government areas ==\n: ''See also'' [[Politics of the Highland Council area]]\n\nThe local government county was created under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889]], which also established elected [[county council]]s for all counties in Scotland. The county of Ross and Cromarty was nominally a merger of two older administrative counties, [[Ross-shire]] and [[Cromartyshire]], but there were some alterations to boundaries. The alterations became fully effective, for all purposes except parliamentary representation, in 1892.\n\nThe county included six [[burgh]]s: [[Cromarty]], [[Dingwall]], [[Fortrose]], [[Invergordon]], [[Stornoway]] and [[Tain]]. Dingwall was the [[county town]].\n\nWhen counties and burghs were abolished as local government areas, in 1975, under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], the area of the county was divided between two new areas, the [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] [[Regions and districts of Scotland|region]] and the [[Western Isles]], and the Ross and Cromarty district of the region was created as one of eight districts of the new region.\n\nStornoway and the district of [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]] merged into the Western Isles. Also, the new Ross and Cromarty district excluded two other areas, which merged into other districts of the region. The electoral division of [[Kincardine (disambiguation)|Kincardine]] was merged into [[Sutherland]], and the South West electoral division (an area around and including [[Loch Alsh|Lochalsh]]) was merged into [[Skye and Lochalsh]].\n\nIn 1996, under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]], the district was abolished and the Highland region was turned into a [[Council areas of Scotland|unitary council area]]. The new [[unitary authority]], the [[Highland Council]], then adopted the area of the former district as a council management area, and created area committees to represent it. The management area consisted then of 13 [[ward (politics)|ward]]s, each electing one [[councillor]] by the [[first past the post]] system of election. The council as a whole had 72 members.\n\nWard boundaries were altered in 1999, to create 80 new wards, but management area boundaries were unaltered. Therefore, area committees ceased to represent exactly the areas for which they were named and made decisions. 18 wards and, therefore, 18 councillors were related to the Ross and Cromarty management area.\n\nUnder the [[Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004]], ward boundaries changed again this year, 2007. Also, the eight management areas were abolished in favour of three new corporate management areas. The Ross and Cromarty area was divided between the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross area and the Ross, Skye and Lochaber area.\n\n==References==\n* {{gutenberg|no=3652|name=History of the Mackenzies, with genealogies of the principal families of the name}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/sct/ROC/ Genealogy of Ross and Cromarty, including list of parishes]\n\n{{Scottish provinces|major}}\n\n[[Category:Historical regions]]\n[[Category:Ross and Cromarty]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the region|other uses|Ross (disambiguation)#United Kingdom}}\n[[Image:Ross (district).PNG|thumb|right|300px|Map of [[Scotland]] showing the historic district of Ross]]\n\n'''Ross'''  (''Ros'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]]) is a region of [[Scotland]], a former [[Earl of Ross|earldom]] and, under the name [[Ross and Cromarty]], a [[Counties of Scotland|county]]. The name ''Ross'' allegedly derives from a [[Goidelic|Gaelic]] word meaning \"headland\", perhaps a reference to the [[Black Isle]]. Another possible origin is the [[Old Norse language|West Norse]] word for [[Orkney]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''Hrossey''&nbsp;\u2013 meaning ''horse island''; the area once belonged to the [[Norway|Norwegian]] ([[West Norse]]) [[earldom]] of Orkney. Ross is a historical comital region, perhaps predating the [[Mormaerdom of Ross]].  It is also a region used by the [[Church of Scotland|Church]], with the [[Presbytery of Ross]] being part of the [[Synod of Ross, Sutherland and Caithness]]. \n\n== History ==\n\nExcavations of a rock shelter and shell [[midden]] at [[Sand, Applecross]] on the coast of [[Wester Ross]] have shown that the coast was occupied by [[Mesolithic]] hunter-gatherers.\n\nIt may be doubted whether the [[Roman empire|Roman]]s ever effected even a temporary settlement in the area of the modern county. In Roman times, and for long afterwards, the land was occupied by [[Picts]], who, in the 6th and 7th centuries, were [[Christianization|converted to Christianity]] by followers of Saint [[Columba]]. Throughout the next three centuries the natives were continually harassed by Norwegian [[Viking Age|Viking]] raiders, of whose presence tokens have survived in several place-names ([[Dingwall]], [[Tain]], and others). At this time the country formed part of the great province of [[Moray]] (Latin: ''Moravia''), which then extended as far as the [[Dornoch Firth]] and the Oykel, and included practically the whole of Ross and Cromarty.\n\nWilliam, the 4th [[Earl of Ross]], was present with his [[Clan Ross|clan]] at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] (1314), and almost a century later (1412) the castle of Dingwall, the chief seat on the mainland of Donald, [[Lord of the Isles]], was captured after the disastrous fight at [[Battle of Harlaw|Harlaw]] in [[Aberdeenshire (traditional)|Aberdeenshire]], which Donald had provoked when his claim to the earldom was rejected. The earldom reverted to the crown in 1424, but [[James I of Scotland|James I]] soon afterwards restored it to the heiress of the line, the mother of Alexander Macdonald, 3rd [[Lord of the Isles]], who thus became the 11th Earl. In consequence, however, of the treason of John Macdonald, 4th and last Lord of the Isles and 12th Earl of Ross, the earldom was again vested in the crown (1476). Five years later [[James III of Scotland|James III]] bestowed it on his second son, [[James Stewart, Duke of Ross|James Stewart]], whom he also created Duke of Ross in 1488.\n\nBy the 16th century the whole area of the county was occupied by different [[Scottish clan|clans]]. The Rosses held what is now [[Easter Ross]]; the Munros the small tract around Ben Wyvis, including Dingwall; the Macleods [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], and, in the mainland, the district between Loch Maree and Loch Torridon; the Macdonalds of Glengarry, Coigach, and the district between Strome Ferry and Kyle of Lochalsh, and the Mackenzies the remainder.\n\nThe county of Ross was constituted in 1661, and Cromarty in 1685 and 1698, both being consolidated into the present county in 1889.\n\nApart from occasional conflicts between rival clans, the only battles in the county were at [[Battle of Carbisdale|Invercarron]], at the head of Dornoch Firth, when [[James Graham, Marquis of Montrose|Montrose]] was crushed by Colonel Archibald Strachan on 27 April 1650; and at [[Battle of Glenshiel|Glenshiel]], where the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], under the [[William Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Seaforth|Earl of Seaforth]], aided by Spaniards, were defeated by a force under the command of General [[Joseph Wightman (general)|Joseph Wightman]] on 10 June 1719.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Liathach from Beinn Eighe.jpg|thumb|left|Liathach seen from Beinn Eighe.

There are also a number of small islands off the area's west coast, among which are:\n\n* Gillean (lighthouse) in the parish of [[Loch Alsh|Lochalsh]]\n* [[Crowlin Islands]] in [[Applecross]]\n* [[Eilean Horrisdale]], and [[Isle of Ewe]] in [[Gairloch]] parish\n* [[Isle Martin]] and [[Tanera More]], of the [[Summer Isles]] group in the parish of [[Lochbroom (parish)|Lochbroom]]\n\nThe area of the mainland is {{convert|1572332|acre|ha|abbr=off}}.\n\nOn the North Sea (eastern) side of the county the major [[firth]]s are the Beauly Firth and the (Inner) [[Moray Firth]], which separate the [[Black Isle]] from [[Inverness-shire]]; the [[Cromarty Firth]], which bounds the districts of Easter Ross and the Black Isle; the Moray Firth, separating Easter Ross from [[Nairnshire]]; and the [[Dornoch Firth]], dividing north-east [[Ross-shire|Ross]] from Sutherland.\n\nOn the [[Atlantic (ocean)|Atlantic]] (western) coastline&mdash;which has a length of nearly {{convert|311|mi|km|abbr=off}}&mdash;the principal sea lochs and bays, from south to north, are [[Loch Duich]], [[Loch Alsh]], Loch Carron, Loch Kishorn, [[Loch Torridon]], Loch Shieldaig, Upper Loch Torridon, [[Gair Loch]], [[Loch Ewe]], [[Gruinard Bay]], [[Loch Broom]] and Enard Bay.\n\nThe chief capes include Tarbat Ness on the east coast, and Coigach, Greenstone Point, Rubha Reidh, [[Redpoint]] and Hamha Point on the west.\n\nAlmost all the southern boundary with Inverness-shire consists of a rampart of peaks, many of them [[Munro]]s:\n* [[An Riabhachan]] ({{convert|3704|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}),\n* [[Sgurr na Lapaich]] ({{convert|3773|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}),\n* [[Carn Eige]] (C\u00e0rn Eighe) ({{convert|3881|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}),\n* [[Mam Sodhail]] (Mam Soul) ({{convert|3871|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}),\n* [[Beinn Fhada]] (Ben Attow) ({{convert|3386|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}),\n* [[Sgurr Fhuaran]] ({{convert|3504|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}),\n* [[The Saddle]] ({{convert|3317|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}).\n\nTo the north of Glen [[Torridon]] are the masses of [[Liathach]] ({{convert|3455|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), [[Beinn Eighe]] ({{convert|3313|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), [[Beinn Alligin]] ({{convert|3235|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and [[Beinn Dearg (Torridon)|Beinn Dearg]] ({{convert|2998|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). On the northeastern shore of Loch Maree rises [[Slioch]] ({{convert|3219|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), while the Fannich group contains six Munros, the highest being Sgurr Mor ({{convert|3645|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). The immense isolated bulk of [[Ben Wyvis]] ({{convert|3428|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), forms the most noteworthy feature in the north-east, and [[An Teallach]] ({{convert|3484|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) in the north-west appears equally conspicuous, though less solitary. Only a small fraction of the west and south of the area is under {{convert|1000|ft|abbr=on}} in height. Easter Ross and the peninsula of the Black Isle are comparatively level.\n\nThe longest stream of the mainland portion of Ross and Cromarty is the River Orrin, which rises from the slopes of An Sidhean ({{convert|2671|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and pursues a north-easterly course to its confluence with the River Conon after a run of about {{convert|26|mi|km|abbr=on}}, a small part of which forms the boundary with Inverness-shire. At Aultgowrie the stream rushes through a narrow gorge where the drop is considerable enough to make the Falls of Orrin. The River Blackwater flows from mountains in [[Strathvaich]] southeast for {{convert|18|mi|km|abbr=on}} until it joins the Conon, forming soon after it leaves Loch Garve the small but picturesque Falls of Rogie. Within a short distance of its exit from Loch Luichart the Conon pours over a series of cascades and rapids and then pursues a winding course of {{convert|12|mi|km|abbr=on}}, mainly eastward to the head of the Cromarty Firth. Situated above Glen Elchaig in the southwest of the region are the Falls of Glomach. The stream giving rise to them drains a series of small lochs on the northern flanks of Beinn Fhada (Ben Attow) and, in an almost unbroken sheet over a metre in width, effects a sheer drop of 110 m, and soon afterwards ends its course in Glen Elchaig. The falls are usually visited from [[Invershiel]] 11&nbsp;km to the south-west. 12 miles south-east of Ullapool, on the estate of Braemore, are the Falls of Measach, formed by the Droma, a headstream of the River Broom. The cascades, three in number, are close to Corrieshalloch Gorge. The River Oykel, throughout its course, forms the boundary with Sutherland.\n[[Image:Slioch from Loch Maree.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Slioch seen from the shores of Loch Maree]]\nThere are many freshwater [[loch]]s, the largest being [[Loch Maree]]. In the far north-west, {{convert|243|ft|abbr=on}} above the sea, lies Loch Sionascaig, a loch of such irregularity of outline that it has a shore-line of {{convert|17|mi|km|abbr=on}}. It contains several wooded islands, and drains into Enard Bay by the River Polly. [[Lochan Fada]] (the long loch), {{convert|1000|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} above the sea, is {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on|0}} in length, and covers an area of {{convert|1112|acre}}, and is {{convert|42|fathom|m}} deep, with a mean depth of {{convert|17|fathom|m}}. Once drained by the Muice (Allt na Muice), it has been tapped a little farther west by the Abhainn na Fhasaigh, which has lowered the level of the loch. Other lochs are Fionn Loch (the white or clear lake), {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on|0}} long by {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on|0}} wide, famous for its [[heron]]s, Loch Luichart towards the centre of the area (8 miles long and between {{convert|1/2|-|1|mi|km|1|abbr=on}} wide), fringed with [[birch]]es and having the shape of a crescent, the mountain-girt Loch Fannich ({{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=or}} wide); and the wild narrow Lochs [[Loch Monar and Loch Mullardoch|Monar]] ({{convert|4|mi|km|disp=or|abbr=on|0}} long) and [[Loch Monar and Loch Mullardoch|Mullardoch]] ({{convert|5|mi|km|disp=or|abbr=on|0}} long), on the [[Inverness-shire]] boundary.\n\nOf the [[strath]]s or valleys, the more important run from the centre eastwards, such as Strathconon, Strathbran, Strathgarve, Strathpeffer and [[Strathcarron, Highland|Strathcarron]]. Excepting Glen Orrin, in the east central district, the longer glens lie in the south and towards the west. In the extreme south [[Glen Shiel]] runs between five mountains (the [[Five Sisters of Kintail]]) to its mouth on Loch Duich. The [[A87 road|A87]] passes down the glen. Further north lie Glen Elchaig, Glen Carron, and Glen Torridon. The railway from Dingwall runs through Glen Carron to [[Kyle of Lochalsh]].\n\n==Geology==\n\nThe central portion of this county is occupied by the younger highland [[schist]]s or Dalradian series. These consist of [[quartzite]]s, mica-schists, garnetiferous mica-schists and [[gneiss]]es, all with a gentle inclination towards the southeast. On the eastern side of the county the Dalradian schists are covered unconformably by the Old Red Sandstone. The boundary runs southward from Edderton on Dornoch Firth, by Strathpeffer, to the neighborhood of Beauly. These rocks comprise red flags and [[sandstone]]s, grey bituminous flags and [[shale]]s. An [[anticline|anticlinal]] fold with a southwest-northeast axis brings up the basal beds of the series about the mouth of Cromarty Firth and exposes once more the schists in The Sutors (The Sutors of Cromarty) guarding the entrance to the firth. The western boundary of the younger schist is formed by the great [[pre-Cambrian]] dislocation line that traverses the county in a fairly direct course from Elphin on the north by [[Ullapool]] to Glencarron. Most of the area west of the line of disturbance is covered by [[Torridonian Sandstone]], mainly dark reddish sandstones, grits and shales, resting unconformably on the ancient [[Lewisian complex|Lewisian gneiss]] with horizontal or slightly inclined bedding. The unconformity is well exposed on the shores of Gairloch, Loch Maree and Loch Torridon. These rocks, which attain a considerable thickness and are divisible into three sub-groups, build up the mountain districts of Applecross, Coigach and elsewhere.\n\nWithin the Torridonian tract the older Lewisian gneiss occupies large areas north of Coigach, on the east of Enard Bay, between Gruinard Bay and Loch Maree. Between the last named and Gairloch, on both sides of middle Loch Torridon and at many other spots smaller patches appear. The Lewisian gneiss is everywhere penetrated by basic [[dike (geology)|dikes]], generally with a northwest-southeast direction; some of these are of great breadth. The Torridonian rocks are succeeded unconformably by a series of Cambrian strata confined to a variable but narrow belt west of the line of main thrusting. This belt of Cambrian rocks has suffered an enormous amount of subordinate thrusting. It is composed of the following subdivisions in ascending order: falsebedded quartzite, Pipe Rock quartzite, fucoid beds and Olenellus band, serpulite grit, Durness [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] and [[marble]], Durness dolomite and [[limestone]]: but these are not always visible at any one spot. So great has been the disturbance in the region of thrusting that in some places, as in the neighborhood of Loch Kishorn and elsewhere, the rocks have been completely overturned and the ancient gneiss has been piled upon the Torridonian.\n\nOn the shore of [[Moray Firth]] at Rathie a small patch of Kimeridge shale occurs, and beneath the cliffs of Shandwick there is a little Lower Oolite with a thin seam of coal. Glacial striae are found upon the mountains up to heights of {{convert|3300|ft|abbr=on}}, and much boulder clay is found in the valleys and spread over large areas in the eastern districts. Raised beaches occur at up to {{convert|108|ft|abbr=on}} or so above the present sea-level; they are well seen in Loch Carron.\n\n==Climate and agriculture==\n\nThe west coast has high rainfall: an annual average of {{convert|50.42|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at Loch Broom and {{convert|62|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at [[Stromeferry|Strome Ferry]] (autumn and winter being the wettest seasons), but on the east coast the annual average is only {{convert|27|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

On the top of the cross in Nigg churchyard are two figures with outstretched arms in the act of supplication; the dove descends between them, and below are two dogs. The cross was knocked down by the fall of the belfry in 1725, but has been riveted together. The third stone formerly stood at Hilton of Cadboll, but was removed for security to the grounds of Invergordon Castle.\n\nAmong old castles are those of Lochslin, in the parish of Fearn, said to date from the 13th century, which, though ruinous, possesses two square towers in good preservation; Balone, in the parish of Tarbat, once a stronghold of the Earls of Ross; the remains of Dingwall Castle, their original seat; and [[Eilean Donan]] in Loch Alsh, which was blown up by British warships during the [[Jacobitism|abortive Jacobite rising]] in 1719.\n\n== Local government areas ==\n: ''See also'' [[Politics of the Highland Council area]]\n\nThe local government county was created under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889]], which also established elected [[county council]]s for all counties in Scotland. The county of Ross and Cromarty was nominally a merger of two older administrative counties, [[Ross-shire]] and [[Cromartyshire]], but there were some alterations to boundaries. The alterations became fully effective, for all purposes except parliamentary representation, in 1892.\n\nThe county included six [[burgh]]s: [[Cromarty]], [[Dingwall]], [[Fortrose]], [[Invergordon]], [[Stornoway]] and [[Tain]]. Dingwall was the [[county town]].\n\nWhen counties and burghs were abolished as local government areas, in 1975, under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], the area of the county was divided between two new areas, the [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] [[Regions and districts of Scotland|region]] and the [[Western Isles]], and the Ross and Cromarty district of the region was created as one of eight districts of the new region.\n\nStornoway and the district of [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]] merged into the Western Isles. Also, the new Ross and Cromarty district excluded two other areas, which merged into other districts of the region. The electoral division of [[Kincardine (disambiguation)|Kincardine]] was merged into [[Sutherland]], and the South West electoral division (an area around and including [[Loch Alsh|Lochalsh]]) was merged into [[Skye and Lochalsh]].\n\nIn 1996, under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]], the district was abolished and the Highland region was turned into a [[Council areas of Scotland|unitary council area]]. The new [[unitary authority]], the [[Highland Council]], then adopted the area of the former district as a council management area, and created area committees to represent it. The management area consisted then of 13 [[ward (politics)|ward]]s, each electing one [[councillor]] by the [[first past the post]] system of election. The council as a whole had 72 members.\n\nWard boundaries were altered in 1999, to create 80 new wards, but management area boundaries were unaltered. Therefore, area committees ceased to represent exactly the areas for which they were named and made decisions. 18 wards and, therefore, 18 councillors were related to the Ross and Cromarty management area.\n\nUnder the [[Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004]], ward boundaries changed again this year, 2007. Also, the eight management areas were abolished in favour of three new corporate management areas. The Ross and Cromarty area was divided between the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross area and the Ross, Skye and Lochaber area.\n\n==References==\n* {{gutenberg|no=3652|name=History of the Mackenzies, with genealogies of the principal families of the name}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/sct/ROC/ Genealogy of Ross and Cromarty, including list of parishes]\n\n{{Scottish provinces|major}}\n\n[[Category:Historical regions]]\n[[Category:Ross and Cromarty]]\n", "name_user": "Certes", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix wikilinks, replaced:Clydesdale\u2192Clydesdale,typo(s) fixed: northwest-southeast \u2192 northwest\u2013southeast, southwest-northeast \u2192 southwest\u2013northeast", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross,_Scotland"}

He also beat future F1 World Champion [[Fernando Alonso]], then 19, in the [[2000 International Formula 3000 season]].\n\nWebber made his Formula One debut in {{F1|2002}}, scoring Minardi's first points in three years at his and Stoddart's home race. After his first season, [[Jaguar Racing|Jaguar]] took him on as lead driver. During two years with the generally uncompetitive team, Webber qualified on the front two rows of the grid several times and outperformed his teammates. His first F1 win was with [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] at the [[2009 German Grand Prix]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausmotive.com/2009/07/12/webber-wins-in-germany.html|title=AUSmotive.com&nbsp;\u2013 Webber wins in Germany!|access-date=13 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701104451/http://www.ausmotive.com/2009/07/12/webber-wins-in-germany.html|archive-date=1 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> which followed second places at the [[2009 Chinese Grand Prix]], [[2009 Turkish Grand Prix]] and [[2009 British Grand Prix]]. By the end of 2009, Webber had scored eight podiums, including another victory in [[2009 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]]. His eight podiums in {{F1|2009}} compares with only two podiums in the first seven years of his career. He added ten more podiums in {{F1|2010}}, including victories in [[2010 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]], [[2010 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], [[2010 British Grand Prix|Britain]] and [[2010 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]]. Webber finished the 2010 season in third place having led for a long period, losing out to teammate [[Sebastian Vettel]] in the final race of the season. Webber added another race victory in the [[2011 Brazilian Grand Prix]], as he once again finished third behind champion Vettel and runner-up [[Jenson Button]]. Webber partnered Vettel again in the {{F1|2012}} season, outperforming him in the early season and looked to be a major title contender but fell away with no wins in the second half of the season after two in the [[2012 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] and [[2012 British Grand Prix|British]] Grands Prix. The latter win turned out to be his final Grand Prix victory. He finished the season in sixth position. Webber was also a long-term director of the [[Grand Prix Drivers' Association]], the Formula One drivers' union.\n\nOn 27 June 2013, Webber announced he would be retiring from Formula One at the end of the season.

At the [[2014 6 Hours of S\u00e3o Paulo|6 Hours of S\u00e3o Paulo]], Webber's Porsche took pole position, but was involved in a heavy crash towards the end of the race whilst passing the [[Ferrari 458 Italia GT2|Ferrari]] of the [[Enzo Potolicchio|8 Star Motorsports]] team. Webber's car split in two, but he avoided serious injury. Webber therefore finished his first season in 9th place.\n\nIn November 2015 he became World Endurance Champion in the #17 car, alongside [[Timo Bernhard]] and [[Brendon Hartley]].

[[racing driver]], who last competed in the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] as a [[Porsche]] works driver in [[Le Mans Prototype|LMP1]], in which he won the championship in 2015. Webber won nine Formula One Grands Prix and finished third in the championship in {{f1|2010}}, {{f1|2011}} and {{f1|2013}}, all of which achieved while driving for [[Red Bull Racing]].\n\nAfter some racing success in Australia driving [[Formula Ford]] and [[Formula Holden]], Webber moved to the United Kingdom in 1995 to further his motorsport career.<ref name=\"grandprixinterview\">{{cite news|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ftng035.html|title=Webber's path to the top|publisher=Grandprix.com|last=Garton|first=Nick|date=2 February 2002|accessdate=18 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206224038/http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ftng035.html|archive-date=6 February 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Webber began a partnership with fellow Australian [[Paul Stoddart]], at that time owner of the European Racing [[International Formula 3000|Formula 3000]] team, which eventually took them both into [[Formula One]] when Stoddart bought the [[Minardi]] team. He also beat future F1 World Champion [[Fernando Alonso]], then 19, in the [[2000 International Formula 3000 season]].\n\nWebber made his Formula One debut in {{F1|2002}}, scoring Minardi's first points in three years at his and Stoddart's home race. After his first season, [[Jaguar Racing|Jaguar]] took him on as lead driver. During two years with the generally uncompetitive team, Webber qualified on the front two rows of the grid several times and outperformed his teammates. His first F1 win was with [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] at the [[2009 German Grand Prix]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausmotive.com/2009/07/12/webber-wins-in-germany.html|title=AUSmotive.com&nbsp;\u2013 Webber wins in Germany!|access-date=13 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701104451/http://www.ausmotive.com/2009/07/12/webber-wins-in-germany.html|archive-date=1 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> which followed second places at the [[2009 Chinese Grand Prix]], [[2009 Turkish Grand Prix]] and [[2009 British Grand Prix]]. By the end of 2009, Webber had scored eight podiums, including another victory in [[2009 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]]. His eight podiums in {{F1|2009}} compares with only two podiums in the first seven years of his career. He added ten more podiums in {{F1|2010}}, including victories in [[2010 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]], [[2010 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], [[2010 British Grand Prix|Britain]] and [[2010 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]]. Webber finished the 2010 season in third place having led for a long period, losing out to teammate [[Sebastian Vettel]] in the final race of the season. Webber added another race victory in the [[2011 Brazilian Grand Prix]], as he once again finished third behind champion Vettel and runner-up [[Jenson Button]]. Webber partnered Vettel again in the {{F1|2012}} season, outperforming him in the early season and looked to be a major title contender but fell away with no wins in the second half of the season after two in the [[2012 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] and [[2012 British Grand Prix|British]] Grands Prix. The latter win turned out to be his final Grand Prix victory. He finished the season in sixth position. Webber was also a long-term director of the [[Grand Prix Drivers' Association]], the Formula One drivers' union.\n\nOn 27 June 2013, Webber announced he would be retiring from Formula One at the end of the season. He began to race for Porsche in 2014, on a long-term deal, racing LMP1 Sportscars in the FIA World Endurance Championship.

Working as a driving instructor at Sydney's [[Oran Park Raceway]] between races, Webber finished 14th overall in his debut season. Continuing in the series in 1995, Webber scored several victories, including a win in the support race for the {{F1 GP|1995|Australian}} at [[Adelaide Street Circuit|Adelaide]].

A considerable number of members in the governing party were either freshly elected or chosen to serve as government ministers (which made them ineligible to be elected)<ref name=\":4\" />. As a result, the Premier, [[E.C. Drury]], looked to the [[opposition bench]]es for a Speaker, and chose Parliament, who had served as an MPP since 1914. Upon becoming Speaker, Parliament resigned from the Liberal caucus and sat without party affiliation, as a compromise for his election. While this is the normal practice in the [[British House of Commons]], it is the only time it has happened in Ontario.\n\n=== 1977 ===\n[[Jack Stokes (politician)|Jack Stokes]] was the [[Ontario New Democratic Party|NDP]] MPP for Lake Nipigon, and was named Speaker by [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] [[Bill Davis]]. His election is an example of an instance where a member of an opposing party was elected to the position. Davis was elected to lead a [[minority government]] and having an [[parliamentary opposition|opposition]] MPP as Speaker was a means of denying the opposition one vote (as the Speaker only votes in the occasion of a tie and then must vote by precedent). \n\n=== 1985 ===\n[[Hugh Edighoffer]] was elected Speaker following the [[1985 Ontario general election|1985 provincial election]] that returned a slim minority Progressive Conservative government under [[Frank Miller (politician)|Frank Miller]]. However, the opposition Liberals and NDP together controlled a majority of seats and elected Edighoffer as Speaker, who was a member of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party.]] Days later, the Miller government was brought down by a [[Motion of Non-Confidence]] and, as a result of an accord between the Liberals and the NDP, Liberal leader [[David Peterson]] was asked to form a government without the legislature being dissolved and a new election. Edighoffer, a Liberal MPP, remained Speaker for the duration of the Peterson government as well.\n\n===2011===\nThere were nine candidates for the position of Speaker in the 40th Ontario legislature, held after the 2011 provincial election returned a minority Liberal government. Liberals [[Donna Cansfield]], [[Kevin Flynn (politician)|Kevin Flynn]], [[Dave Levac]] and [[David Zimmer]]. A fifth candidate, Progressive Conservative MPP [[Frank Klees]] withdrew after his bid failed to receive sufficient support from either side of the aisle.\n\nDavid Zimmer dropped off after the first ballot. On the second ballot, Dave Levac was elected Speaker. The actual vote totals were not released.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/dave-levac-elected-ontario-speaker/article2243745/|title=Dave Levac elected Ontario Speaker|last=Howlett|first=Karen|date=November 21, 2011|newspaper=Globe and Mail|accessdate=November 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===2014===\nLiberal MPP [[Dave Levac]] was re-elected to a second term as Speaker at the first session of the 41st Parliament held on July 2, 2014, becoming the first Speaker since [[Hugh Edighoffer]] to serve more than one term. Levac defeated NDP MPP [[Paul Miller (Canadian politician)|Paul Miller]] and Progressive Conservative [[Rick Nicholls]] on the third ballot. NDP MPP [[Cheri DiNovo]] was eliminated on the first ballot and Liberal MPP [[Shafiq Qaadri]] was eliminated on the second ballot. Actual vote totals were not released.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.parisstaronline.com/2014/07/02/levac-re-elected-speaker|title=Levac re-elected Speaker|date=July 2, 2014|work=Belleville Expositor|accessdate=July 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===2018===\nPC MPP [[Ted Arnott]] was elected as Speaker at the first session of the 42nd Parliament held on July 11, 2018 on the first ballot, defeating [[Randy Hillier (politician)|Randy Hillier]], [[Jane McKenna]] and [[Rick Nicholls]]. Arnott was one of the three longest serving members of the legislature at the time of election.\n\n== Election ==\n{{Panorama\n| image = Legislative_Assembly_-_panoramio.jpg\n| height = 176\n| caption = Chamber of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

A considerable number of members in the governing party were either freshly elected or chosen to serve as government ministers (which made them ineligible to be elected)<ref name=\":4\" />. As a result, the Premier, [[E.C. Drury]], looked to the [[opposition bench]]es for a Speaker, and chose Parliament, who had served as an MPP since 1914. Upon becoming Speaker, Parliament resigned from the Liberal caucus and sat without party affiliation, as a compromise for his election. While this is the normal practice in the [[British House of Commons]], it is the only time it has happened in Ontario.\n\n=== 1977 ===\n[[Jack Stokes (politician)|Jack Stokes]] was the [[Ontario New Democratic Party|NDP]] MPP for Lake Nipigon, and was named Speaker by [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] [[Bill Davis]]. His election is an example of an instance where a member of an opposing party was elected to the position. Davis was elected to lead a [[minority government]] and having an [[parliamentary opposition|opposition]] MPP as Speaker was a means of denying the opposition one vote (as the Speaker only votes in the occasion of a tie and then must vote by precedent). \n\n=== 1985 ===\n[[Hugh Edighoffer]] was elected Speaker following the [[1985 Ontario general election|1985 provincial election]] that returned a slim minority Progressive Conservative government under [[Frank Miller (politician)|Frank Miller]]. However, the opposition Liberals and NDP together controlled a majority of seats and elected Edighoffer as Speaker, who was a member of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party.]] Days later, the Miller government was brought down by a [[Motion of Non-Confidence]] and, as a result of an accord between the Liberals and the NDP, Liberal leader [[David Peterson]] was asked to form a government without the legislature being dissolved and a new election. Edighoffer, a Liberal MPP, remained Speaker for the duration of the Peterson government as well.\n\n===2011===\nThere were nine candidates for the position of Speaker in the 40th Ontario legislature, held after the 2011 provincial election returned a minority Liberal government. Liberals [[Donna Cansfield]], [[Kevin Flynn (politician)|Kevin Flynn]], [[Dave Levac]] and [[David Zimmer]]. A fifth candidate, Progressive Conservative MPP [[Frank Klees]] withdrew after his bid failed to receive sufficient support from either side of the aisle.\n\nDavid Zimmer dropped off after the first ballot. On the second ballot, Dave Levac was elected Speaker. The actual vote totals were not released.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/dave-levac-elected-ontario-speaker/article2243745/|title=Dave Levac elected Ontario Speaker|last=Howlett|first=Karen|date=November 21, 2011|newspaper=Globe and Mail|accessdate=November 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===2014===\nLiberal MPP [[Dave Levac]] was re-elected to a second term as Speaker at the first session of the 41st Parliament held on July 2, 2014, becoming the first Speaker since [[Hugh Edighoffer]] to serve more than one term. Levac defeated NDP MPP [[Paul Miller (Canadian politician)|Paul Miller]] and Progressive Conservative [[Rick Nicholls]] on the third ballot.

{"title_page": "Sheila van Damm", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2015}}\n'''Sheila Van Damm''' (17 January 1922 \u2013 23 August 1987) was a British woman competitor in motor [[rallying]] in the 1950s, and also the former owner of the [[Windmill Theatre]] in London.  She began her competitive driving career in 1950, and won the Coupe des Dames, the highest award for women, in the 1953 [[Alpine Rally]]. The following year she won the Women's European Touring Championship and, in 1955, the Coupe des Dames at the [[Monte Carlo Rally]].\n\n==Biography==\n\nVan Damm was born in [[Paddington]], west London, the daughter of [[Vivian Van Damm]] and his wife, Natalie Lyons.  Her upbringing in a [[Jew]]ish family was certainly unconventional but then her father was an automobile enthusiast and had been a mechanic with Clement-Talbot in the early days of motoring. He encouraged her to learn to drive, at well below the legal age, and her first journey with him was to drive from London to Brighton<ref>{{Cite book|last=Davis|first=S.C.H|title=Atalanta. Women as Racing Drivers|publisher=GT Foulis & Co Ltd|year=|isbn=|location=London|pages=163}}</ref>. In the Second World War she had more conventional training as a [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF) driver.<ref>Oxford [[Dictionary of National Biography]]</ref>\n\nWhile in the WAAF, she entered her first motor sporting event with her only sister Nona as navigator, as a promotional stunt for the [[Windmill Theatre]], which her father managed. With \"Windmill Girl\" written on the side of the factory-prepared [[Sunbeam Talbot]] they finished 3rd in the ladies' section of the MCC-Daily Express car rally.  This led to an official [[Rootes Group|Rootes]] team [[Hillman Minx]] in the 1951 Monte Carlo rally.\n\nHer first major success was the Ladies' Prize in the 1952 Motor Cycling Club rally driving a Sunbeam Talbot. The 1953 Monte Carlo rally was marred by punctures, but she entered the record books with a class speed record for 2\u20133 litre cars, driving the prototype [[Sunbeam Alpine]] sports car at an average of {{convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} at [[Jabbeke]] in [[Belgium]].\n\nIn the 1953 Alpine Rally, she and co-driver Anne Hall won not only the Coupe des Dames, but also a coveted Coupes des Alpes. Another Coupe des Dames in the 1954 Tulip rally of Holland included outright victory in a 10-lap race around the [[Circuit Park Zandvoort|Zandvoort circuit]]. The ladies' prize in the Viking rally in Norway clinched the 1954 Ladies' European championship for Van Damm and Hall \u2013 a triumph they repeated in 1955 in a (Rootes-prepared) [[Sunbeam Alpine]] Mk. III works team car. Registered RHP 702 and presently in Australia, this is the only one of six original works cars residing outside the UK. Other works cars were driven by racing drivers [[Leslie Johnson (racing driver)|Leslie Johnson]], [[Peter Collins (racing driver)|Peter Collins]] and [[Stirling Moss]].\n\nVan Damm, Johnson, and Moss won the Team Prize in the 1954 Monte Carlo Rally driving Sunbeam-Talbot 90 Mk. IIs. Van Damm was in Rootes' Team Prize-winning team again in 1955 and 1956.\n\nThe 1956 Monte Carlo rally was her last with Rootes. That year she partnered Peter Harper in a [[Sunbeam Rapier]] in the [[Mille Miglia]] road race, winning their class at {{convert|66.37|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 1957 Van Damm once more entered  the Mille Miglia (its final running), again in a works Sunbeam Rapier, this time partnered by David Humphrey. However, they did not finish, losing control on treacherous tramlines and hitting a shop window.<ref>Rootes promotional film, 1957</ref>\n\nAfter retirement from racing, she became president of the Doghouse Club for motor racing wives and ladies, and president of the Sunbeam Talbot Alpine Register.\n\nSheila had worked with her father at the Windmill Theatre from her teens. He inherited it in 1944, and left it to her on his death in 1960.<ref>AP [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/27/obituaries/sheila-Van-damm-dies-at-65-briton-raced-cars-in-1950-s.html \"Sheila Van Damm Dies at 65; Briton Raced Cars in 1950's\"], ''New York Times'', 27 August 1987</ref> But the changing nature of [[Soho]] in London caused it to close in 1964. In 1965, Sheila Van Damm toured the Tivoli Circuit Theatres in [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], with her show, \"The Windmill Revue\". The show featured a number of former Windmill Theatre artistes. This in turn led her to retire with her sister to their small farm in [[Pulborough]] in Sussex.
