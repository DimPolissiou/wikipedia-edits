The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease.

The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease.

The parkway travels north from [[Interstate 215 (Utah)|Interstate&nbsp;215]] (I-215) in northwestern [[Salt Lake City]] to an interchange named the Wasatch Weave in [[Farmington, Utah|Farmington]] with two intermediate interchanges providing access to [[Woods Cross, Utah|Woods Cross]] and [[Centerville, Utah|Centerville]]. Wetlands of the nearby [[Great Salt Lake]] and nature preserves border the western side of the parkway while the eastern side roughly parallels [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] and [[Utah Transit Authority]] rail lines and [[Interstate 15 in Utah|I-15]]. On average, between 20,000 and 23,000&nbsp;vehicles use the parkway daily.\n\nConstruction began in 2006 and was completed in 2008, with the parkway opening in September of the same year.  The parkway was controversial in its construction and was challenged in court several times before a compromise was met between the state and the [[Sierra Club]], which limited the speed on the road and banned [[Semi-trailer truck|semi-trucks]] on the highway except in emergencies. In addition to the restrictions on speed and trucks, the road was reduced from a six-lane expressway to a four-lane parkway. The compromise agreement restrictions have a sunset date of January 1, 2020, at which time the speed limit will increase to {{convert|65|mph|abbr=on}} and trucks will no longer be banned.\n\n==Route description==\nThe parkway begins at an incomplete interchange with I-215 in extreme northern [[Salt Lake County, Utah|Salt Lake County]] near the [[Jordan River Off-Highway Vehicle State Recreation Area]]. The interchange allows motorists from the Interstate to transfer onto Legacy Parkway and travelers to access I-215 southbound. After about {{convert|1/4|mi|m}}, Legacy Parkway enters Davis County, and heads northerly with two lanes in each direction through semi-rural [[Woods Cross, Utah|Woods Cross]]. The parkway then turns northeasterly and back north again, meeting 500&nbsp;South at a [[diamond interchange]], which also provides a connection to Redwood Road ([[Utah State Route 68|SR-68]]). The eastern border of the [[Legacy Nature Preserve]] is formed by the parkway as it travels north. In [[West Bountiful, Utah|West Bountiful]], the parkway curves to the northeast as it follows the contour of the wetlands which lie on the western side of the road. Before reverting to its original northerly direction, the route intersects Parrish Lane ([[Utah State Route 105|SR-105]]) at another diamond interchange. Past the intersection, [[Union Pacific]] and [[Utah Transit Authority]] ([[FrontRunner]]) railroad tracks run between the parkway and I-15 to the east. For the remainder of the parkway's length, I-15 is located approximately {{convert|300|ft}} east. Upon entering [[Farmington, Utah|Farmington]], the parkway gains one lane in each direction and terminates at a triple-junction with I-15, [[Utah State Route 225|SR-225]] and [[U.S. Route 89 in Utah|U.S. Route&nbsp;89]] west of [[Lagoon (amusement park)|Lagoon]].<ref name=\"wasatch front map\">{{cite map|title=Utah Highway Map| publisher=Utah Department of Transportation|url=http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/f?p=100:pg:0::::V,T:,346|inset=Wasatch Front|scale=1:570,240|year=2011|section=D4}}</ref><ref name=\"gmaps\">{{google maps|url=https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!data=!1m4!1m3!1d80659!2d-111.8710642!3d40.9098023!4m24!3m20!1m4!3m2!3d40.9859595!4d-111.902092!6e2!1m5!1sLegacy+Pkwy+%26+Interstate+215%2C+UT!2s0x8752f6d199262087%3A0xc7f4ed128cf6add1!3m2!3d40.8313199!4d-111.945046!3m8!1m3!1d5035!2d-111.8989163!3d40.9875468!3m2!1i1366!2i642!4f13.1!5m2!13m1!1e1&fid=0|accessdate=December 22, 2013|title=Legacy Parkway Overview}}</ref> This interchange is referred to as the Wasatch Weave.<ref name=\"wasatch weave\">{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700258462/Davis-now-has-the-Wasatch-Weave.html?pg=all|title=Davis now has the Wasatch Weave|last=Dougherty|first=Joseph M.|date=September 13, 2008|work=Deseret News|accessdate=December 22, 2013|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|oclc=10171976}}</ref>\n[[File:LegacyParkway3.jpg|left|thumb|Legacy Parkway approaching 500 South]]\nThe design of the road was re-envisioned to include extensive wetland protection west of the parkway and in the parkway median, a trail system along the side of the parkway,<ref name=\"first thoughts desnews\" /> and numerous pedestrian overpasses and underpasses for ease of access to the trail system.

The parkway travels north from [[Interstate 215 (Utah)|Interstate&nbsp;215]] (I-215) in northwestern [[Salt Lake City]] to an interchange named the Wasatch Weave in [[Farmington, Utah|Farmington]] with two intermediate interchanges providing access to [[Woods Cross, Utah|Woods Cross]] and [[Centerville, Utah|Centerville]]. Wetlands of the nearby [[Great Salt Lake]] and nature preserves border the western side of the parkway while the eastern side roughly parallels [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] and [[Utah Transit Authority]] rail lines and [[Interstate 15 in Utah|I-15]]. On average, between 20,000 and 23,000&nbsp;vehicles use the parkway daily.\n\nConstruction began in 2006 and was completed in 2008, with the parkway opening in September of the same year.  The parkway was controversial in its construction and was challenged in court several times before a compromise was met between the state and the [[Sierra Club]], which limited the speed on the road and banned [[Semi-trailer truck|semi-trucks]] on the highway except in emergencies. In addition to the restrictions on speed and trucks, the road was reduced from a six-lane expressway to a four-lane parkway. The compromise agreement restrictions have a sunset date of January 1, 2020, at which time the speed limit will increase to {{convert|65|mph|abbr=on}} and trucks will no longer be banned.\n\n==Route description==\nThe parkway begins at an incomplete interchange with I-215 in extreme northern [[Salt Lake County, Utah|Salt Lake County]] near the [[Jordan River Off-Highway Vehicle State Recreation Area]]. The interchange allows motorists from the Interstate to transfer onto Legacy Parkway and travelers to access I-215 southbound. After about {{convert|1/4|mi|m}}, Legacy Parkway enters Davis County, and heads northerly with two lanes in each direction through semi-rural [[Woods Cross, Utah|Woods Cross]]. The parkway then turns northeasterly and back north again, meeting 500&nbsp;South at a [[diamond interchange]], which also provides a connection to Redwood Road ([[Utah State Route 68|SR-68]]). The eastern border of the [[Legacy Nature Preserve]] is formed by the parkway as it travels north. In [[West Bountiful, Utah|West Bountiful]], the parkway curves to the northeast as it follows the contour of the wetlands which lie on the western side of the road. Before reverting to its original northerly direction, the route intersects Parrish Lane ([[Utah State Route 105|SR-105]]) at another diamond interchange. Past the intersection, [[Union Pacific]] and [[Utah Transit Authority]] ([[FrontRunner]]) railroad tracks run between the parkway and I-15 to the east. For the remainder of the parkway's length, I-15 is located approximately {{convert|300|ft}} east. Upon entering [[Farmington, Utah|Farmington]], the parkway gains one lane in each direction and terminates at a triple-junction with I-15, [[Utah State Route 225|SR-225]] and [[U.S. Route 89 in Utah|U.S. Route&nbsp;89]] west of [[Lagoon (amusement park)|Lagoon]].<ref name=\"wasatch front map\">{{cite map|title=Utah Highway Map| publisher=Utah Department of Transportation|url=http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/f?p=100:pg:0::::V,T:,346|inset=Wasatch Front|scale=1:570,240|year=2011|section=D4}}</ref><ref name=\"gmaps\">{{google maps|url=https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!data=!1m4!1m3!1d80659!2d-111.8710642!3d40.9098023!4m24!3m20!1m4!3m2!3d40.9859595!4d-111.902092!6e2!1m5!1sLegacy+Pkwy+%26+Interstate+215%2C+UT!2s0x8752f6d199262087%3A0xc7f4ed128cf6add1!3m2!3d40.8313199!4d-111.945046!3m8!1m3!1d5035!2d-111.8989163!3d40.9875468!3m2!1i1366!2i642!4f13.1!5m2!13m1!1e1&fid=0|accessdate=December 22, 2013|title=Legacy Parkway Overview}}</ref> This interchange is referred to as the Wasatch Weave.<ref name=\"wasatch weave\">{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700258462/Davis-now-has-the-Wasatch-Weave.html?pg=all|title=Davis now has the Wasatch Weave|last=Dougherty|first=Joseph M.|date=September 13, 2008|work=Deseret News|accessdate=December 22, 2013|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|oclc=10171976}}</ref>\n[[File:LegacyParkway3.jpg|left|thumb|Legacy Parkway approaching 500 South]]\nThe design of the road was re-envisioned to include extensive wetland protection west of the parkway and in the parkway median, a trail system along the side of the parkway,<ref name=\"first thoughts desnews\" /> and numerous pedestrian overpasses and underpasses for ease of access to the trail system.
