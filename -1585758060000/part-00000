Tuscora Park was originally built as a project of the [[Works Progress Administration]]; original stone work gates, paths and retaining walls still adorn the park.  The park is now the home of the Park Place Teen Center, a facility for high school students that provides entertainment of all types. Events at the park include a Summer Showcase and the annual First Town Days festival.\n\nThe Summer Showcase is held in the Tuscora Park Amphitheater. Events at the amphitheater include Sunday church services, plays and concerts featuring local talent. On the last day of the First Town Days festival the park hosts the U.S. Air Force Band of Flight,<ref>\"The United States Air Force Band of Flight Concert\",[http://www.firsttowndays.com/Air%20Force%20Page.pdf/ PDF]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, accessed April 15, 2011</ref> which plays in the amphitheater.\n\nAround 1940, New Philadelphia purchased the Herschell-Spillman carousel secondhand. It is a rare all-wooden carousel.  It includes 36 carved wooden jumping horses, two chariots and 428 individual lights.<ref>Wise, Derek,[http://www.carouselnews.com/July-2007/Tuscora-Park-Turns-100.html \"Tuscora Park Turns 100\"], \"The Carousel News\", September 21, 2007, accessed April 15, 2011</ref> The center panels are adorned with 14 original oil paintings. Music is provided by a [[Wurlitzer]] #153 military [[Fairground Organ|Band Organ]]. The carousel is 40 feet in diameter and weighs 10 tons.  It was manufactured in 1928 by the [[Allan Herschell Company|Spillman Manufacturing Company]] of [[North Tonawanda, New York]]. David Miller is well known for his 40 years of service on the Tuscora Park Carousel.\nThe First Town Days, which includes a Grand Parade and fireworks display, runs on the weekend leading up to the Fourth of July.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firsttowndays.com/|title=First Town Days Home|author=|date=|website=www.firsttowndays.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe company that manages Tuscora Park is a [[non-profit]], RTY Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtyinc.com/main/|title=Home page|author=|date=|website=www.rtyinc.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref> The organization frequently hires high school and college students to operate rides and sell tickets.\n\n==Education==\n\n===Primary and secondary===\nChildren in New Philadelphia are served by the New Philadelphia City School District.

If they develop into [[cumulus mediocris]] or [[cumulus congestus]], thunderstorms could form later in the day.<ref name=Windows2Universe>{{Cite web | url=http://www.windows2universe.org/earth/Atmosphere/clouds/cumulus_humilis.html | title=Windows2Universe}}</ref>\n\nThey generally form at lower altitudes (500\u20133000 m (1,500\u201310,000&nbsp;ft)), but in hot countries or over mountainous terrain these clouds can occur at an altitude of up to {{convert|6000|m|abbr=on}}. They show no significant vertical development, indicating that the [[temperature]] in the atmosphere above them either drops off very slowly or not at all with altitude; that is, the [[adiabatic lapse rate]] is small. Cumulus humilis may be accompanied by other [[cloud]] types.\n \nAir below the cloud base can be quite turbulent due to the [[thermal]]s that formed the clouds, giving occupants of light aircraft an uncomfortable ride.<ref name=\"NOAA Turbulence Guide\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.weather.gov/source/zhu/ZHU_Training_Page/turbulence_stuff/turbulence/turbulence.htm | title=NOAA Turbulence Guide | accessdate=2018-06-03}}</ref> To avoid [[turbulence]] where such clouds are present, pilots may climb above the cloud tops.

[[Cumulonimbus |Larger clouds]] or possibly thunderstorms could form throughout the day to cause bad or [[severe weather]] in the afternoon or evening. Cumulus humilis clouds are not rain clouds but could precede a storm.\n\nCumulus humilis are sometimes seen beneath [[cirrostratus]] clouds, which block some of the heat from the sun and thus create an [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion]], causing any cumuliform clouds to flatten and become cumulus humilis. In this case, a warm front could be approaching and rain is possible for the next 12 to 24 hours.\n\nWhen cumulus humilis appear in a clear sky, they are an indicator of pleasant weather for the next several hours.\n\n==Formation==\nCumulus humilis clouds are formed by rising warm air or [[thermal]]s with ascending [[air current]]s of 2\u20135&nbsp;m/s (7\u201317&nbsp;ft/s).<ref name=\"World Meteorological Organization: Cumulus humilis\">{{Cite web | url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/cumulus-humilis.html | title=Cumulus humilis | accessdate=2018-06-03}}</ref> These clouds are usually very small convective clouds and usually form after a thermal reaches the [[Lifted condensation level|condensation level]].

If they develop into [[cumulus mediocris]] or [[cumulus congestus]], thunderstorms could form later in the day.<ref name=Windows2Universe>{{Cite web | url=http://www.windows2universe.org/earth/Atmosphere/clouds/cumulus_humilis.html | title=Windows2Universe}}</ref>\n\nThey generally form at lower altitudes (500\u20133000 m (1,500\u201310,000&nbsp;ft)), but in hot countries or over mountainous terrain these clouds can occur at an altitude of up to {{convert|6000|m|abbr=on}}. They show no significant vertical development, indicating that the [[temperature]] in the atmosphere above them either drops off very slowly or not at all with altitude; that is, the [[adiabatic lapse rate]] is small. Cumulus humilis may be accompanied by other [[cloud]] types.\n \nAir below the cloud base can be quite turbulent due to the [[thermal]]s that formed the clouds, giving occupants of light aircraft an uncomfortable ride.<ref name=\"NOAA Turbulence Guide\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.weather.gov/source/zhu/ZHU_Training_Page/turbulence_stuff/turbulence/turbulence.htm | title=NOAA Turbulence Guide | accessdate=2018-06-03}}</ref> To avoid [[turbulence]] where such clouds are present, pilots may climb above the cloud tops. However, [[gliding|glider]] pilots actively seek out the rising air to gain altitude.\n\nThese clouds may later metamorphose into cumulus clouds when [[convection]] is intense enough,<ref name=\"World Meteorological Organization: Cumulus mediocris\">{{Cite web | url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/cumulus-mediocris.html | title=Cumulus mediocris | accessdate=2018-06-03}}</ref> though the presence of these types of clouds usually indicates fair weather.<ref name=\"Windows2Universe\" />\n\n== Forecasting ==\nMorning cumulus humilis clouds are signs of an unstable atmosphere.
