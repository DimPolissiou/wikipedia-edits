Until the 20th century it was thought to depict [[Ludovico Sforza]], a [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]] and employer of Leonardo. During a 1904\u20131905 restoration, the removal of overpainting revealed a hand holding [[sheet music]], indicated that the sitter may be a musician.\n\nThe painting has attracted much intrigue and mystery as no contemporary records of its [[commission (art)|commission]] exist. Strong stylistic similarities to other works by Leonardo have secured him at least a partial attribution. The hesitation for a universal consensus in attribution is due to the stiff, rigid and lifeless qualities of the figure's body. While the unfinished nature of the painting may explain this, scholars believe it was likely completed by a [[Leonardeschi| student of Leonardo's]].\n\nThe portrait contains the dark background portrait typical of Leonardo's time in Milan. [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]] are other examples of this, but the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is the only one to still reside in Milan, where it has been housed at the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] since at least 1672. Over the centuries, many Italian musicians and politicians to have been proposed as the sitter. [[Franchinus Gaffurius]] was the most convincing suggestion throughout the 20th century, but scholarly opinion has shifted to [[Atalante Migliorotti]], who has been the leading candidate throughout the 21st century. Other notable suggestions include [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Gaspar van Weerbeke]] but there is no decisive evidence to confirm any claims.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\nThis painting was made with [[oil painting|oils]] on a [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]] wood panel, a medium which Leonardo had begun to favor at the time of the painting's creation.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} The portrait depicts a young man in a bust length, three-quarter position while his right hand holds a folded [[sheet music|musical score]] of some kind.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}} It is reminiscent of his other portraits from his time in [[Milan]], such as the [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]], from their shared black background, while also differing in the angled, rather than profile view.{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}\n\n===The musician===\n[[File:Ritratto di musico 02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Detail of the musical score]]The man has curly shoulder length hair, sporting a red hat on his mostly finished face that intently stares at something outside the spectator's field of vision.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} He wears a tight white undershirt with an unfinished black [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] and only an [[underpaint]]ed brownish-orange [[Academic stole|stole]].{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}} The mouth hints at the start of a smile or suggests that perhaps the man is about to sing or has just sung.{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}} A notable feature of the musician's face is the effect on his eyes from the light outside the frame. The light causes both eyes to be dilated but the left eye to a far greater extent than the right, something that is not humanly possible. Some defend Leonardo, claiming that this is simply for dramatic effect, so the viewer feels a sense of motion from the musician's left to right side of his face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=239}}\n\n===The musical score===\nThe stiffly folded piece of paper is held in an odd and delicate manner and is at least one part of a [[sheet music|musical score]], with [[musical notes]] and letters written on it.{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} Due to the poor [[art conservation|conservation]] of the lower part of the painting, the notes and letters are largely illegible.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} This has not stopped various scholars from hypothesizing as to what the letters say, often using their interpretations to support their theory of the musician's identity.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|pp=75\u201376}} The notes on the other hand have offered little clarity into the painting, other than strongly suggesting the subject to be a musician.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}} The notes are also undoubtedly in measural notation and therefore likely representative of [[polyphonic music]].{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}} Drawings from [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library of Windsor]] with Leonardo's own music notational style do not share a resemblance to the music in the painting.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}} Suggesting that the music is not by him, which leaves the composer and the significance of the music, unknown.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}\n\n==History==\n===Attribution and date===\n[[File:Portrait of a Lady - Ambrogio de Predis.png|thumb|upright=1.0|''Portrait of a Lady'' by [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]]. Originally thought to also be by Leonardo and paired with ''Portrait of a Musician'']]\t\nWhile once controversial, modern scholars generally agree that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is by Leonardo da Vinci.{{sfn|Kemp|2003}}{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}} This controversy stemmed from the rigid and stoicness of the painting,{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} something which scholars address by proposing that the clothing and torso were done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of his]], perhaps [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]] or [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]].{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Wallace}} But it is universally agreed that if Leonardo did not create the whole painting, then he at least painted the face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}}\n\nWhile no recording of a [[commission (art)|commission]] exists,{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} this attribution comes from various stylistic similarities to Leonardo's other works, notably the angel and St. Jerome's face from [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and [[Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]] respectively, as well as the portrait having hair reminiscent of that in [[Ginevra de' Benci]].{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}} The dark background of the portrait, a style popularized by Leonardo, furthers this attribution as it appears in other portraits from his time in Milan, such as [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]].{{sfn|Kemp|2003}} The shared quality of these portraits suggests that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' was likely done in Milan as well, meaning after 1482, the year he arrived there. Leonardo's lack of anatomical detail suggests that the Portrait of a Musician is from before 1490, the year where he would engage in a study of the [[anatomy|human body structure]], especially the [[skull]]. In fact, the later Lady with an Ermine, from 1489-1490, is representative of this newly gained dedication to accuracy in painting the human form, further suggesting the painting to be from before 1490. It can be further narrowed down due to the similarity in treatment of [[chiaroscuro]] from works in the mid 1840s, such [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and sketches for a [[Leonardo's horse|bronze horse sculpture]] making the painting safe to date to 1895-1890.{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}}\n\n===Ambrosiana===\nThis is Leonardo's only portrait to remain in Milan, and was catalogued into the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in 1672. Its whereabouts before are unknown but it was listed with a description of being \"the face of the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], with such elegance, that perhaps the living Duke would have wanted it for himself,\" which implied the subject to be [[Ludovico Sforza]], the duke at the time.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} The theory was that it was a counterpart to the ''Portrait of a Lady'', now attributed to [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]] but at the time was thought to be a Leonardo portrait of [[Beatrix d'Este|Beatrice d'Este]], Ludovico's wife.{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}\n\nThese assumptions were taken without question until [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding a [[sheet music|musical score]],{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} which led to the identification of the subject as a musician.{{sfn|Z\u00f6llner|2015|p=45}} Since this discovery, numerous candidates have been proposed as the sitter.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n==Possible subjects==\n{{multiple image|total_width=300\n|image1=Portrait of a Youth in Profile - Francesco Napoletano.jpg\n|image2=Bust of a Youth in Profile - Leonardo da Vinci.jpg\n|footer=Two drawings, thought to depict the same person as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.

Scholars at the [[National Gallery]] have suggested that [[Francesco Napoletano]]'s drawing of ''Portrait of a Youth in Profile'' and Leonardo's drawing of a ''Bust of a Youth in Profile'' depict the same figure as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|National Gallery|2011|p=5}} However the identity of the sitter himself remains unknown and not only have various candidates been proposed but even the idea that the subject is simply anonymous has also been explored.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n===Franchinus Gaffurius===\nThroughout the 20th century, the leading candidate, suggested by [[Luca Beltrami]] in 1906, was [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], a priest, music theorist and  court musician for [[Ludovico Sforza]] and ''[[maestro di cappella]]'' of [[Milan Cathedral]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} Gaffurius and Leonardo were known to have been friends, both entering the Duke's service only a year or two apart from each other. In fact, Gaffurius' celebrated 1496 music treatise, ''Practica Musica'', contains various [[woodcuts]] by Leonardo.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=31}} Additionally, the letters \"Cant\" and \"Ang\" have been deciphered on the sheet music which could by an abbreviation for Cantum Angelicum. This may be to be in reference to ''Angelicum ac divinum opus'', a music treatise published in 1508.{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}\n\n<imagemap>\nImage:Portrait of a Musician Candidates.jpg|thumb|left|alt=''Portrait of a Musician'' and four proposed candidates of the subject.|Sforza, Gaffurius, Josquin and Galeazzo.{{#tag:ref|This portrait, by [[Andrea Solari]], has often been suggested to be [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin|Galeazzo di Sanseverino]], another candidate for the sitter in Leonardo's painting.{{sfn|Shephard|2019}}|group=n}} (Left to right, ''Portrait of a Musician'' center) have each been proposed as the subject. <small>''(Clickable image\u2014use cursor to identify.)''</small>\npoly 10 10 218 10 218 192 150 192 149 278 10 278 [[Ludovico Sforza]]\npoly 220 10 424 10 424 278 284 278 284 192 220 192 [[Franchinus Gaffurius]]\nrect 150 192 284 372[[Portrait of a Musician]]\npoly 10 282 149 282 149 380 218 380 218 554 10 554 [[Josquin des Prez]]\npoly 284 282 424 282 424 554 220 554 220 380 284 372 [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]]\n</imagemap>\nThe theory has been disproven from the treatise being published at least 18 years after the painting's creation and no physical descriptions from Gaffurius' lifetime matching the ''Portrait of a Musician.''{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Also, the issues of Gaffurius, a priest, not being depicted in [[Clerical clothing|clerical robe]] and that Gaffurius would have been in his mid thirties at the time, make him likely too old to be the young man of the painting.{{sfn|Blackburn|2001}}{{sfn|Pooler|2014|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n===Atalante Migliorotti===\nSince Pietro C. Marani's theory in 2000,{{sfn|Marani|2000|p=165}} [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] [[lute|lutist]], actor, lyricist and singer, has been the most widely accepted identity of the musician.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} In 1482, Migliarotti and Leonardo left [[Florence]] together for [[Milan]] to serve in the court of [[Ludovico Sforza]], the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]].{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}} Furthermore, Leonardo is thought to have taught Migliarotti the [[lute]] and [[lyre]] and known to be friends.{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}{{sfn|Harr\u00e1n|2001}} During the painting's conception, Migliarotti would have been in his late teens or early twenties, making him a fitting candidate to be the young man in the painting.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Additionally, in a 1482 inventory from the [[Codex Atlanticus]]{{#tag:ref|Folio 888 recto (ex 324 recto) to be exact.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}|group=n}} Leonardo listed \"a portrait of Atalante with his face raised.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{#tag:ref|Alternatively translated as: \"a portrait of Atalante with his upturned face.\"{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|pp=75\u201376}} or \"a head portrayed from Atalante who raises his face.\"{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}|group=n}} This has been considered by many to have been some kind of study or start of the later ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\nThe only issues with this theory are that the subject's face is not raised, as Leonardo wrote in his notes, and this note was written 3 years prior to the earliest estimated date of completion{{#tag:ref|The earliest being 1485 with the latest at 1490.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}}{{sfn|Syson|2011}}{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}|group=n}} for the ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} However, these are by no means outstanding issues, as Leonardo was known to make numerous revisions and often took many years to complete a painting.{{sfn|Kalb|2019}}{{sfn|Selvaggio|2018}}{{#tag:ref|Often, like ''The Portrait of a Musician'', not even finishing his paintings.{{sfn|Cotter|2019}}|group=n}} Therefore, since the widespread rejection of Franchinus Gaffurius as the leading candidate, Migliarotti is now considered the most likely.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Blackburn|2001}}\n\n===Josquin des Prez===\nIn 1972, [[Josquin des Prez]], French singer and composer, was suggested as the subject by [[Belgian]] musicologist, Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Josquin worked in the service of the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] during various periods of the 1480s,{{sfn|Macey|2001}} consequently working at the same time as Leonardo.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}} Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune proposed that the words on the [[sheet music|musical score]] where the abbreviations of \"Cont,\" \"Cantuz,\" and \"A Z\" appear in reference to the words \"[[Contratenor]],\" \"Cantuz\" and [[Alto|Altuz]]. She claimed that this meant they were associated with a song with a descending melodic line, such as [[Mass (music)|masses]], [[motets]] and songs by Josquin.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}{{#tag:ref|With Josquin's motet ''Illibata Dei Virgo nutrix'' suggested as a piece that exemplifies this.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}|group=n}}\n\nThis theory has been strongly discredited as the notation in the painting being largely illegible, while many composers of the time were writing the same forms in this manner.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Additionally, this theory runs into the same issues as those of Gaffurius', in that Josquin was also a priest in his mid 30s at the time, making the young man depicted without [[Clerical clothing|clerical robes]] unlikely to be Josquin.{{sfn|Macey|2001}}\n\n===Gaspar van Weerbeke===\nLaure Fagnart suggested in 2019 that the sitter's identity is [[Gaspar van Weerbeke]], a [[Netherlandish]] composer and singer. Gaspar worked for the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] at the same time as Leonardo, and they where likely knew each other due to their shared employer.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}} This theory cites letters from [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]] to Gotardo Panigarola concerning the attire of musicians for the court, with one stating, \"Gotardo. To Gaspar, our singer, we would like to give a dark velvet robe, such as you have given to the Abbot [Antonio Guinati] and to Cordier, both of them also our sing-ers.\" As Fagnart points out, this letter is too vague to defiantly link Gaspar to the portrait, additionally, Gaspar runs into the same issue as Gaffurius and Josquin, as he would have also been in his 30s and probably too old to be the young man in the painting.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n===Others===\n[[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]] has been suggested as the sitter, since Leonardo lived with him while in Milan. Not only is there no direct evidence to support this, but the uncovering of the musical score makes this very unlikely as Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin was not known to be a musician.{{sfn|Shephard|2019}} [[Francesco Canova da Milano]], an Italian [[lute]]nist and composer, has been suggested as the subject since he was an important musician also working in [[Milan]] when Leonardo was there.{{sfn|Wallace}} Additionally, Italian painter [[Leonardo da Pistoia]] has been suggested,{{sfn|Russell|2014}} however, there is no strong evidence to support either of these claims.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}{{sfn|Wallace}} The a Dutch illustrator [[Siegfried Woldhek]]  proposed that ''Portrait of a Musician'' is one of three self portraits by Leonardo, {{sfn|Woldhek|2008}} although this theory is considered highly improbable.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n==Interpretation==\nGiven the lack of contemporary records, scholars have proposed various theories. A number believed that the tension in the subject's face is due to intense thought on music that was either just performed, about to be performed or being performed.{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} The painting has also been proposed as representative of Leonardo's self proclaimed ideology in the superiority of painting over other art forms like [[poetry]], [[sculpture]] and [[music]].{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=77}} Leonardo famously declared in the beginning of his uncompleted ''[[A Treatise on Painting|Libro de pittura]]'', \n\n{{Quote\n|text=How Music Ought to be Called the Sister and Junior to Painting. Music is to be re-garded none other than the sitter of painting since it is subject to hearing, a sense second to the eye, and since it composes harmony from the conjunction of its proportional parts operating at the same time. [These parts] are constrained to arise and to die in one or more harmonic tempos which surround a proportionality by its members; such a har-mony is composed not differently from the circumferential lines which generate human beauty by its [respective] members. Yet painting excels and rules over music, because it does not immediately die after its creation the way unfortunately music does. To the contrary, painting stays in existence, and will show you as being alive what is, in fact, on a single surface. \n|author=Leonardo da Vinci\n|source=''[[A Treatise on Painting]]'' (1490-92)\n}}\n\nThese words seemingly disapprove of music for its ephemeral nature, and positions painting as having a materiel, permanent physical quality. This theory suggests that the sadness in the young man's eyes is due to this proposed idea that music simply disappears after a finished performance.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=77}}\n\nAnother interpretation is that Leonardo was simply moved to depict the a young man's beauty and curly hair. But more likely, due to the odd and seemingly intimate aesthetic of the painting, is that it was a personal gift for a close friend.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} This would fit with a lot of the proposed subjects, especially [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a close friend of Leonardo's and one likely not financially able to commission a portrait himself.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''Books'''\n*{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Kenneth |authorlink1=Kenneth Clark |last2=Kemp |first2=Martin |authorlink2=Martin Kemp (art historian) |year=1989\n |title=Leonardo da Vinci: Revised Edition |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |language=English |location=City of Westminster, London, England |isbn=978-0140169829 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXifCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PR99&dq=martin%20kemp%20%22portrait%20of%20a%20musician%22&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false |ref={{sfnRef|Clark|1989}}}}\n\n*{{cite book |last=Fagnart |first=Laure |editor-last1=Lindmayr-Brandl |editor-first1=Andrea |editor-last2=Kolb |editor-first2=Paul |year=2019\n |chapter=Gaspar Depicted?

Until the 20th century it was thought to depict [[Ludovico Sforza]], a [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]] and employer of Leonardo. During a 1904\u20131905 restoration, the removal of overpainting revealed a hand holding [[sheet music]], indicated that the sitter may be a musician.\n\nThe painting has attracted much intrigue and mystery as no contemporary records of its [[commission (art)|commission]] exist. Strong stylistic similarities to other works by Leonardo have secured him at least a partial attribution. The hesitation for a universal consensus in attribution is due to the stiff, rigid and lifeless qualities of the figure's body. While the unfinished nature of the painting may explain this, scholars believe it was likely completed by a [[Leonardeschi| student of Leonardo's]].\n\nThe portrait contains the dark background portrait typical of Leonardo's time in Milan. [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]] are other examples of this, but the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is the only one to still reside in Milan, where it has been housed at the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] since at least 1672. Over the centuries, many Italian musicians and politicians to have been proposed as the sitter. [[Franchinus Gaffurius]] was the most convincing suggestion throughout the 20th century, but scholarly opinion has shifted to [[Atalante Migliorotti]], who has been the leading candidate throughout the 21st century. Other notable suggestions include [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Gaspar van Weerbeke]] but there is no decisive evidence to confirm any claims.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\nThis painting was made with [[oil painting|oils]] on a [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]] wood panel, a medium which Leonardo had begun to favor at the time of the painting's creation.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} The portrait depicts a young man in a bust length, three-quarter position while his right hand holds a folded [[sheet music|musical score]] of some kind.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}} It is reminiscent of his other portraits from his time in [[Milan]], such as the [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]], from their shared black background, while also differing in the angled, rather than profile view.{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}\n\n===The musician===\n[[File:Ritratto di musico 02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Detail of the musical score]]The man has curly shoulder length hair, sporting a red hat on his mostly finished face that intently stares at something outside the spectator's field of vision.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} He wears a tight white undershirt with an unfinished black [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] and only an [[underpaint]]ed brownish-orange [[Academic stole|stole]].{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}} The mouth hints at the start of a smile or suggests that perhaps the man is about to sing or has just sung.{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}} A notable feature of the musician's face is the effect on his eyes from the light outside the frame. The light causes both eyes to be dilated but the left eye to a far greater extent than the right, something that is not humanly possible. Some defend Leonardo, claiming that this is simply for dramatic effect, so the viewer feels a sense of motion from the musician's left to right side of his face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=239}}\n\n===The musical score===\nThe stiffly folded piece of paper is held in an odd and delicate manner and is at least one part of a [[sheet music|musical score]], with [[musical notes]] and letters written on it.{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} Due to the poor [[art conservation|conservation]] of the lower part of the painting, the notes and letters are largely illegible.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} This has not stopped various scholars from hypothesizing as to what the letters say, often using their interpretations to support their theory of the musician's identity.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|pp=75\u201376}} The notes on the other hand have offered little clarity into the painting, other than strongly suggesting the subject to be a musician.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}} The notes are also undoubtedly in measural notation and therefore likely representative of [[polyphonic music]].{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}} Drawings from [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library of Windsor]] with Leonardo's own music notational style do not share a resemblance to the music in the painting.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}} Suggesting that the music is not by him, which leaves the composer and the significance of the music, unknown.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}\n\n==History==\n===Attribution and date===\n[[File:Portrait of a Lady - Ambrogio de Predis.png|thumb|upright=1.0|''Portrait of a Lady'' by [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]]. Originally thought to also be by Leonardo and paired with ''Portrait of a Musician'']]\t\nWhile once controversial, modern scholars generally agree that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is by Leonardo da Vinci.{{sfn|Kemp|2003}}{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}} This controversy stemmed from the rigid and stoicness of the painting,{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} something which scholars address by proposing that the clothing and torso were done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of his]], perhaps [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]] or [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]].{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Wallace}} But it is universally agreed that if Leonardo did not create the whole painting, then he at least painted the face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}}\n\nWhile no recording of a [[commission (art)|commission]] exists,{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} this attribution comes from various stylistic similarities to Leonardo's other works, notably the angel and St. Jerome's face from [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and [[Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]] respectively, as well as the portrait having hair reminiscent of that in [[Ginevra de' Benci]].{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}} The dark background of the portrait, a style popularized by Leonardo, furthers this attribution as it appears in other portraits from his time in Milan, such as [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]].{{sfn|Kemp|2003}} The shared quality of these portraits suggests that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' was likely done in Milan as well, meaning after 1482, the year he arrived there. Leonardo's lack of anatomical detail suggests that the Portrait of a Musician is from before 1490, the year where he would engage in a study of the [[anatomy|human body structure]], especially the [[skull]]. In fact, the later Lady with an Ermine, from 1489-1490, is representative of this newly gained dedication to accuracy in painting the human form, further suggesting the painting to be from before 1490. It can be further narrowed down due to the similarity in treatment of [[chiaroscuro]] from works in the mid 1840s, such [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and sketches for a [[Leonardo's horse|bronze horse sculpture]] making the painting safe to date to 1895-1890.{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}}\n\n===Ambrosiana===\nThis is Leonardo's only portrait to remain in Milan, and was catalogued into the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in 1672. Its whereabouts before are unknown but it was listed with a description of being \"the face of the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], with such elegance, that perhaps the living Duke would have wanted it for himself,\" which implied the subject to be [[Ludovico Sforza]], the duke at the time.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} The theory was that it was a counterpart to the ''Portrait of a Lady'', now attributed to [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]] but at the time was thought to be a Leonardo portrait of [[Beatrix d'Este|Beatrice d'Este]], Ludovico's wife.{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}\n\nThese assumptions were taken without question until [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding a [[sheet music|musical score]],{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} which led to the identification of the subject as a musician.{{sfn|Z\u00f6llner|2015|p=45}} Since this discovery, numerous candidates have been proposed as the sitter.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n==Possible subjects==\n{{multiple image|total_width=300\n|image1=Portrait of a Youth in Profile - Francesco Napoletano.jpg\n|image2=Bust of a Youth in Profile - Leonardo da Vinci.jpg\n|footer=Two drawings, thought to depict the same person as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.

Scholars at the [[National Gallery]] have suggested that [[Francesco Napoletano]]'s drawing of ''Portrait of a Youth in Profile'' and Leonardo's drawing of a ''Bust of a Youth in Profile'' depict the same figure as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|National Gallery|2011|p=5}} However the identity of the sitter himself remains unknown and not only have various candidates been proposed but even the idea that the subject is simply anonymous has also been explored.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n===Franchinus Gaffurius===\nThroughout the 20th century, the leading candidate, suggested by [[Luca Beltrami]] in 1906, was [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], a priest, music theorist and  court musician for [[Ludovico Sforza]] and ''[[maestro di cappella]]'' of [[Milan Cathedral]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} Gaffurius and Leonardo were known to have been friends, both entering the Duke's service only a year or two apart from each other. In fact, Gaffurius' celebrated 1496 music treatise, ''Practica Musica'', contains various [[woodcuts]] by Leonardo.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=31}} Additionally, the letters \"Cant\" and \"Ang\" have been deciphered on the sheet music which could by an abbreviation for Cantum Angelicum. This may be to be in reference to ''Angelicum ac divinum opus'', a music treatise published in 1508.{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}\n\n<imagemap>\nImage:Portrait of a Musician Candidates.jpg|thumb|left|alt=''Portrait of a Musician'' and four proposed candidates of the subject.|Sforza, Gaffurius, Josquin and Galeazzo.{{#tag:ref|This portrait, by [[Andrea Solari]], has often been suggested to be [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin|Galeazzo di Sanseverino]], another candidate for the sitter in Leonardo's painting.{{sfn|Shephard|2019}}|group=n}} (Left to right, ''Portrait of a Musician'' center) have each been proposed as the subject. <small>''(Clickable image\u2014use cursor to identify.)''</small>\npoly 10 10 218 10 218 192 150 192 149 278 10 278 [[Ludovico Sforza]]\npoly 220 10 424 10 424 278 284 278 284 192 220 192 [[Franchinus Gaffurius]]\nrect 150 192 284 372[[Portrait of a Musician]]\npoly 10 282 149 282 149 380 218 380 218 554 10 554 [[Josquin des Prez]]\npoly 284 282 424 282 424 554 220 554 220 380 284 372 [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]]\n</imagemap>\nThe theory has been disproven from the treatise being published at least 18 years after the painting's creation and no physical descriptions from Gaffurius' lifetime matching the ''Portrait of a Musician.''{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Also, the issues of Gaffurius, a priest, not being depicted in [[Clerical clothing|clerical robe]] and that Gaffurius would have been in his mid thirties at the time, make him likely too old to be the young man of the painting.{{sfn|Blackburn|2001}}{{sfn|Pooler|2014|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n===Atalante Migliorotti===\nSince Pietro C. Marani's theory in 2000,{{sfn|Marani|2000|p=165}} [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] [[lute|lutist]], actor, lyricist and singer, has been the most widely accepted identity of the musician.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} In 1482, Migliarotti and Leonardo left [[Florence]] together for [[Milan]] to serve in the court of [[Ludovico Sforza]], the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]].{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}} Furthermore, Leonardo is thought to have taught Migliarotti the [[lute]] and [[lyre]] and known to be friends.{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}{{sfn|Harr\u00e1n|2001}} During the painting's conception, Migliarotti would have been in his late teens or early twenties, making him a fitting candidate to be the young man in the painting.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Additionally, in a 1482 inventory from the [[Codex Atlanticus]]{{#tag:ref|Folio 888 recto (ex 324 recto) to be exact.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}|group=n}} Leonardo listed \"a portrait of Atalante with his face raised.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{#tag:ref|Alternatively translated as: \"a portrait of Atalante with his upturned face.\"{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|pp=75\u201376}} or \"a head portrayed from Atalante who raises his face.\"{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}|group=n}} This has been considered by many to have been some kind of study or start of the later ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\nThe only issues with this theory are that the subject's face is not raised, as Leonardo wrote in his notes, and this note was written 3 years prior to the earliest estimated date of completion{{#tag:ref|The earliest being 1485 with the latest at 1490.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}}{{sfn|Syson|2011}}{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}|group=n}} for the ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} However, these are by no means outstanding issues, as Leonardo was known to make numerous revisions and often took many years to complete a painting.{{sfn|Kalb|2019}}{{sfn|Selvaggio|2018}}{{#tag:ref|Often, like ''The Portrait of a Musician'', not even finishing his paintings.{{sfn|Cotter|2019}}|group=n}} Therefore, since the widespread rejection of Franchinus Gaffurius as the leading candidate, Migliarotti is now considered the most likely.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Blackburn|2001}}\n\n===Josquin des Prez===\nIn 1972, [[Josquin des Prez]], French singer and composer, was suggested as the subject by [[Belgian]] musicologist, Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Josquin worked in the service of the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] during various periods of the 1480s,{{sfn|Macey|2001}} consequently working at the same time as Leonardo.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}} Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune proposed that the words on the [[sheet music|musical score]] where the abbreviations of \"Cont,\" \"Cantuz,\" and \"A Z\" appear in reference to the words \"[[Contratenor]],\" \"Cantuz\" and [[Alto|Altuz]]. She claimed that this meant they were associated with a song with a descending melodic line, such as [[Mass (music)|masses]], [[motets]] and songs by Josquin.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}{{#tag:ref|With Josquin's motet ''Illibata Dei Virgo nutrix'' suggested as a piece that exemplifies this.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}|group=n}}\n\nThis theory has been strongly discredited as the notation in the painting being largely illegible, while many composers of the time were writing the same forms in this manner.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Additionally, this theory runs into the same issues as those of Gaffurius', in that Josquin was also a priest in his mid 30s at the time, making the young man depicted without [[Clerical clothing|clerical robes]] unlikely to be Josquin.{{sfn|Macey|2001}}\n\n===Gaspar van Weerbeke===\nLaure Fagnart suggested in 2019 that the sitter's identity is [[Gaspar van Weerbeke]], a [[Netherlandish]] composer and singer. Gaspar worked for the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] at the same time as Leonardo, and they where likely knew each other due to their shared employer.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}} This theory cites letters from [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]] to Gotardo Panigarola concerning the attire of musicians for the court, with one stating, \"Gotardo. To Gaspar, our singer, we would like to give a dark velvet robe, such as you have given to the Abbot [Antonio Guinati] and to Cordier, both of them also our sing-ers.\" As Fagnart points out, this letter is too vague to defiantly link Gaspar to the portrait, additionally, Gaspar runs into the same issue as Gaffurius and Josquin, as he would have also been in his 30s and probably too old to be the young man in the painting.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n===Others===\n[[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]] has been suggested as the sitter, since Leonardo lived with him while in Milan. Not only is there no direct evidence to support this, but the uncovering of the musical score makes this very unlikely as Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin was not known to be a musician.{{sfn|Shephard|2019}} [[Francesco Canova da Milano]], an Italian [[lute]]nist and composer, has also been suggested as the subject since he was an important musician also working in [[Milan]] when Leonardo was there.{{sfn|Wallace}} However, there is no strong evidence to support this claim.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}{{sfn|Wallace}} The a Dutch illustrator [[Siegfried Woldhek]]  proposed that ''Portrait of a Musician'' is one of three self portraits by Leonardo, {{sfn|Woldhek|2008}} although this theory is considered highly improbable.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n==Interpretation==\nGiven the lack of contemporary records, scholars have proposed various theories. A number believed that the tension in the subject's face is due to intense thought on music that was either just performed, about to be performed or being performed.{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} The painting has also been proposed as representative of Leonardo's self proclaimed ideology in the superiority of painting over other art forms like [[poetry]], [[sculpture]] and [[music]].{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=77}} Leonardo famously declared in the beginning of his uncompleted ''[[A Treatise on Painting|Libro de pittura]]'', \n\n{{Quote\n|text=How Music Ought to be Called the Sister and Junior to Painting. Music is to be re-garded none other than the sitter of painting since it is subject to hearing, a sense second to the eye, and since it composes harmony from the conjunction of its proportional parts operating at the same time. [These parts] are constrained to arise and to die in one or more harmonic tempos which surround a proportionality by its members; such a har-mony is composed not differently from the circumferential lines which generate human beauty by its [respective] members. Yet painting excels and rules over music, because it does not immediately die after its creation the way unfortunately music does. To the contrary, painting stays in existence, and will show you as being alive what is, in fact, on a single surface. \n|author=Leonardo da Vinci\n|source=''[[A Treatise on Painting]]'' (1490-92)\n}}\n\nThese words seemingly disapprove of music for its ephemeral nature, and positions painting as having a materiel, permanent physical quality. This theory suggests that the sadness in the young man's eyes is due to this proposed idea that music simply disappears after a finished performance.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=77}}\n\nAnother interpretation is that Leonardo was simply moved to depict the a young man's beauty and curly hair. But more likely, due to the odd and seemingly intimate aesthetic of the painting, is that it was a personal gift for a close friend.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} This would fit with a lot of the proposed subjects, especially [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a close friend of Leonardo's and one likely not financially able to commission a portrait himself.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''Books'''\n*{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Kenneth |authorlink1=Kenneth Clark |last2=Kemp |first2=Martin |authorlink2=Martin Kemp (art historian) |year=1989\n |title=Leonardo da Vinci: Revised Edition |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |language=English |location=City of Westminster, London, England |isbn=978-0140169829 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXifCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PR99&dq=martin%20kemp%20%22portrait%20of%20a%20musician%22&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false |ref={{sfnRef|Clark|1989}}}}\n\n*{{cite book |last=Fagnart |first=Laure |editor-last1=Lindmayr-Brandl |editor-first1=Andrea |editor-last2=Kolb |editor-first2=Paul |year=2019\n |chapter=Gaspar Depicted?
