He immediately hit his stride and ended up the division's second top scorer in [[1996\u201397 League of Ireland First Division|1996\u201397]] season earning him a move to [[St Patrick's Athletic]] and a shock call up by [[Brian Kerr (Irish football manager)|Brian Kerr]] to the [[Republic of Ireland national football team]] for the [[FIFA World Youth Championship 1997|1997 FIFA World Youth Championships]]. Molloy played every game and was Ireland's joint top scorer (2)<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=104/edition=191276/matches/match=30977/report.html  www.fifa.com]</ref><ref>[https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=104/edition=191276/matches/match=31018/report.html www.fifa.com]</ref> as they reached the semi final stage only to lose to eventual winners Argentina. Ireland won [[bronze medal]]s after beating [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] in the 3rd/4th place play-off game.\n\nAt St. Pats he linked up with Ireland teammates [[Colin Hawkins]] and [[Thomas Morgan (footballer)|Thomas Morgan]], who had been added to the nucleus of the squad that had won the [[1995\u201396 League of Ireland Premier Division]], and a lot was expected of the obviously talented squad. All three players made an immediate impact with Molloy enjoying a terrific partnership with [[Ian Gilzean]] as St. Pats won the league with a dramatic last day win in [[Kilkenny City A.F.C.|Kilkenny]] while arch-rivals [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] lost to [[Dundalk F.C.|Dundalk]]. During this season Molloy won the first of his Under 21 caps. In [[1998\u201399 League of Ireland Premier Division|1998\u201399]] Molloy finished as the [[League of Ireland Premier Division]] top scorer as St. Pats raced to another league title.<ref name=\"rsssftop\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/iertops.html|title=Ireland - List of Topscorers|publisher=www.rsssf.com|accessdate=6 July 2016|date= }}</ref><ref name=\"Graham\">{{cite book|last=Graham|first=Alex|title=Football in the Republic of Ireland a Statistical Record 1921\u20132005|publisher=Soccer Books Limited|isbn=1-86223-135-4}}</ref>\n\nAfter a disappointing 1999/2000 season Molloy was transferred to [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] for a St. Pats record of IR\u00a340,000. Molloy repaid that fee instantly by scoring the winner as Bohemians knocked out [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] in the [[UEFA Cup 2000-01|UEFA Cup]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/aberdeen/874931.stm | work=BBC News | title=Aberdeen crash to defeat | date=10 August 2000}}</ref> However he then got sent off against [[FC Kaiserslautern]] in the next round. He would go on to play a vital role as Bohs won the League and [[FAI Cup]] double under manager [[Roddy Collins]]. The following year was not as successful for Bohs but they did reach the FAI Cup final only to lose to [[Dundalk F.C.|Dundalk]].\n\nIn July 2002, Molloy was again signed by Roddy Collins, this time for [[Carlisle United]] of the [[Football League Third Division|English Third Division]]. After only a handful of appearances yielding a solitary goal against [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] (a game in which he also got sent off),<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/2195568.stm\n|title=Lincoln 0\u20131 Carlisle\n|publisher=[[BBC]]\n|date=17 August 2002 |accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref> Molloy returned to Ireland to play for [[Shelbourne FC]] (and become one of a select few players to have played for Dublin football's 'Big 4'.<ref>There are currently 5 Dublin Clubs in eircom league football and there has at times been as many as 8.

Burnley needed to beat [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] at [[Maine Road]] to win the title. [[Brian Pilkington (footballer)|Brian Pilkington]] put Burnley into the lead early in the first half, but [[Joe Hayes (footballer)|Joe Hayes]] equalised for City soon after. In the 30th minute of the match, Meredith scored the goal which gave Burnley a 2\u20131 victory,<ref name=\"MirrorPDF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/incoming/article102339.ece/BINARY/1960+Man+City.pdf|author=McGhee, Frank|date=3 May 1960|accessdate=9 September 2009|title=Burnley Champs!|publisher=Daily Mirror}}</ref> and the English championship for only the second time. However, despite scoring the winning goal Meredith was not awarded a league winners' medal because Football League rules meant the team were only given eleven, and as a reserve Meredith was not eligible to receive one.<ref name=\"Mirror\"/>\n\nHe returned to the reserves at the beginning of the following season, and although he continued to play for Burnley for three further seasons after their Championship winning campaign, he played a total of just 37 league games for Burnley, scoring eight goals.<ref name=\"PFA book\"/>\n\n===Shrewsbury Town===\nIn the summer of 1964, Meredith signed for [[Football League Third Division]] side [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]]. In contrast to his time at Burnley, he was a regular first-team player for ''the Shrews'' and went on to play 235 games in the league for the club, in which he scored 41 times.<ref name=\"PFA book\"/> He helped the side to a string of mid-table finishes in the Third Division during the late 1960s, and the side almost won promotion in the 1967\u201368 season, when they achieved a third-placed finish. Meredith retired from playing at the end of the 1971\u201372 season at the age of 35.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Meredith, Trevor}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Bridgnorth]]\n[[Category:English footballers]]\n[[Category:Kidderminster Harriers F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Burnley F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Shrewsbury Town F.C. players]]\n[[Category:English Football League players]]\n[[Category:Association football wingers]]\n", "name_user": "GiantSnowman", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Meredith"}
