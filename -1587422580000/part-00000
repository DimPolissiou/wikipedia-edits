First, journalists distort reality by making scientific errors. Second, they distort by keying on human-interest stories rather than scientific content.

J., & Reese, S. D.|title=Mediating the message: Theories of influence on mass media content|year=1996|publisher=Longman.|location=New York |pages=261}}</ref> controversy is one of the main variables affecting story choice among news editors, along with human interest, prominence, timeliness, celebrity, and proximity. Coverage of climate change has been accused of falling victim to the journalistic norm of \"personalization\". W.L Bennet defines this trait as: \"the tendency to downplay the big social, economic, or political picture in favor of human trials, tragedies and triumphs\"<ref>W.L Bennet, \"News: The Politics of Illusion\" 5th edition, (2002). Longman, New York. p.45</ref>  The culture of [[political journalism]] has long used the notion of balanced coverage in covering the controversy. In this construct, it is permissible to air a highly [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] opinion, provided this view is accompanied by a competing opinion. But recently scientists and scholars have challenged the legitimacy of this journalistic core value with regard to matters of great importance on which the overwhelming majority of the scientific community has reached a well-substantiated consensus view.\n\n=== Balance ===\nThe notion of balanced coverage may make perfect sense when covering a political convention, but in the culture of science, balancing opposing views may be neither fair nor truthful. As such, many experts argue that it is misleading to give scientific mavericks or advocates equal time with established mainstream scientists.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nYet there is evidence that this is exactly what the media is doing. In a survey of 636 articles from four top United States newspapers between 1988 and 2002, two scholars<ref>{{cite journal|last=Boykoff|first=M.T.|author2=Boykoff, J.M.|title=Balance as bias: Global warming and the US prestige press|journal=Global Environmental Change|year=2004|volume=14|issue=2|pages=125\u2013136|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2003.10.001}}</ref> found that most articles gave as much time to the small group of [[climate change denier|climate change doubters]] as to the scientific consensus view. Given real consensus among climatologists over [[global warming]], many scientists find the media\u2019s desire to portray the topic as a scientific controversy to be a gross distortion. As [[Stephen Schneider]] put it:<ref name=\"Schneider\"/>{{Quotation| \u201ca mainstream, well-established consensus may be \u2018balanced\u2019 against the opposing views of a few extremists, and to the uninformed, each position seems equally credible.\u201d}}\n\nScience journalism concerns itself with gathering and evaluating various types of relevant evidence and rigorously checking sources and facts. Boyce Rensberger,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rensberger|first=B|title=Reporting Science Means Looking for Cautionary Signals|journal=Nieman Reports|year=2002|pages=12\u201314|url=http://niemanreports.org/articles/reporting-science-means-looking-for-cautionary-signals-2/}}</ref> the director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Knight Center for Science Journalism, said, \u201cbalanced coverage of science does not mean giving equal weight to both sides of an argument. It means apportioning weight according to the balance of evidence.\u201d\n\nThe claims of scientists also get distorted by the media by a tendency to seek out extreme views, which can result in portrayal of risks well beyond the claims actually being made by scientists.<ref name=\"Boykoff2009\">{{Cite journal|last=Boykoff |first=Maxwell T. |year=2009 |title=We Speak for the Trees: Media Reporting on the Environment |journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=431\u2013457   |doi=10.1146/annurev.environ.051308.084254}}</ref> Journalists tend to overemphasize the most extreme outcomes from a range of possibilities reported in scientific articles.

Several media pieces have claimed that since the even-at-the-time-poorly-supported theory of [[global cooling]] was shown to be false, that the well-supported theory of global warming can also be dismissed.

An editorial in The Time magazine on June 24, 1974, quoted concerned scientists as voicing alarm over the atmosphere 'growing gradually cooler for the past three decades', 'the unexpected persistence and thickness of pack ice in the waters around Iceland,' and other harbingers of an ice age that could prove 'catastrophic.'

J., & Reese, S. D.|title=Mediating the message: Theories of influence on mass media content|year=1996|publisher=Longman.|location=New York |pages=261}}</ref> controversy is one of the main variables affecting story choice among news editors, along with human interest, prominence, timeliness, celebrity, and proximity. Coverage of climate change has been accused of falling victim to the journalistic norm of \"personalization\". W.L Bennet defines this trait as: \"the tendency to downplay the big social, economic, or political picture in favor of human trials, tragedies and triumphs\"<ref>W.L Bennet, \"News: The Politics of Illusion\" 5th edition, (2002). Longman, New York. p.45</ref>  The culture of [[political journalism]] has long used the notion of balanced coverage in covering the controversy. In this construct, it is permissible to air a highly [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] opinion, provided this view is accompanied by a competing opinion. But recently scientists and scholars have challenged the legitimacy of this journalistic core value with regard to matters of great importance on which the overwhelming majority of the scientific community has reached a well-substantiated consensus view.\n\n=== Balance ===\nThe notion of balanced coverage may make perfect sense when covering a political convention, but in the culture of science, balancing opposing views may be neither fair nor truthful. As such, many experts argue that it is misleading to give scientific mavericks or advocates equal time with established mainstream scientists.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nYet there is evidence that this is exactly what the media is doing. In a survey of 636 articles from four top United States newspapers between 1988 and 2002, two scholars<ref>{{cite journal|last=Boykoff|first=M.T.|author2=Boykoff, J.M.|title=Balance as bias: Global warming and the US prestige press|journal=Global Environmental Change|year=2004|volume=14|issue=2|pages=125\u2013136|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2003.10.001}}</ref> found that most articles gave as much time to the small group of [[climate change denier|climate change doubters]] as to the scientific consensus view. Given real consensus among climatologists over [[global warming]], many scientists find the media\u2019s desire to portray the topic as a scientific controversy to be a gross distortion. As [[Stephen Schneider]] put it:<ref name=\"Schneider\"/>{{Quotation| \u201ca mainstream, well-established consensus may be \u2018balanced\u2019 against the opposing views of a few extremists, and to the uninformed, each position seems equally credible.\u201d}}\n\nScience journalism concerns itself with gathering and evaluating various types of relevant evidence and rigorously checking sources and facts. Boyce Rensberger,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rensberger|first=B|title=Reporting Science Means Looking for Cautionary Signals|journal=Nieman Reports|year=2002|pages=12\u201314|url=http://niemanreports.org/articles/reporting-science-means-looking-for-cautionary-signals-2/}}</ref> the director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Knight Center for Science Journalism, said, \u201cbalanced coverage of science does not mean giving equal weight to both sides of an argument. It means apportioning weight according to the balance of evidence.\u201d\n\nThe claims of scientists also get distorted by the media by a tendency to seek out extreme views, which can result in portrayal of risks well beyond the claims actually being made by scientists.<ref name=\"Boykoff2009\">{{Cite journal|last=Boykoff |first=Maxwell T. |year=2009 |title=We Speak for the Trees: Media Reporting on the Environment |journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=431\u2013457   |doi=10.1146/annurev.environ.051308.084254}}</ref> Journalists tend to overemphasize the most extreme outcomes from a range of possibilities reported in scientific articles.

An editorial in The Time magazine on June 24, 1974, quoted concerned scientists as voicing alarm over the atmosphere 'growing gradually cooler for the past three decades', 'the unexpected persistence and thickness of pack ice in the waters around Iceland,' and other harbingers of an ice age that could prove 'catastrophic.'

A double cone consists of two cones stacked point-to-point and sharing the same axis of rotation; it may be generated by rotating a line about an axis that passes through a point of the line.]]\n[[File:Hyperbel-def-ass-e.svg|300px|thumb|Hyperbola (red): features]]\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''hyperbola''' (plural ''hyperbolas'' or ''hyperbolae'') is a type of [[smooth function|smooth]] [[plane curve|curve lying in a plane]], defined by its geometric properties or by equations for which it is the solution set.  A hyperbola has two pieces, called [[connected component (graph theory)|connected component]]s or branches, that are mirror images of each other and resemble two infinite [[bow (weapon)|bows]].  The hyperbola is one of the three kinds of [[conic section]], formed by the intersection of a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] and a double [[cone (geometry)|cone]].  (The other conic sections are the [[parabola]] and the [[ellipse]]. A [[circle]] is a special case of an ellipse.) If the plane intersects both halves of the double cone but does not pass through the apex of the cones, then the conic is a hyperbola.\n\nHyperbolas arise in many ways: \n* as the curve representing the function <math>f(x) = 1/x</math> in the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian plane]],<ref>{{harvtxt|Oakley|1944|p=17}}</ref>\n* as the path followed by the shadow of the tip of a [[sundial]],\n* as the shape of an [[open orbit]] (as distinct from a closed elliptical orbit), such as the orbit of a [[spacecraft]] during a [[gravity assist]]ed swing-by of a planet or, more generally, any spacecraft exceeding the [[escape velocity]] of the nearest planet,\n* as the path of a single-apparition [[comet]] (one travelling too fast ever to return to the solar system),\n* as the [[Rutherford scattering|scattering trajectory]] of a [[subatomic particle]] (acted on by repulsive instead of attractive forces but the principle is the same),\n* in [[hyperbolic navigation|radio navigation]], when the difference between distances to two points, but not the distances themselves, can be determined,\nand so on.\n\nEach [[branch (mathematics)|branch]] of the hyperbola has two arms which become straighter (lower curvature) further out from the center of the hyperbola. Diagonally opposite arms, one from each branch, tend in the limit to a common line, called the [[asymptote]] of those two arms. So there are two asymptotes, whose intersection is at the center of [[symmetry]] of the hyperbola, which can be thought of as the mirror point about which each branch reflects to form the other branch. In the case of the curve <math>f(x) = 1/x</math> the asymptotes are the two [[coordinate axes]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Oakley|1944|p=17}}</ref>\n\nHyperbolas share many of the ellipses' analytical properties such as [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]], [[focus (geometry)|focus]], and [[directrix (conic section)|directrix]]. Typically the correspondence can be made with nothing more than a change of sign in some term. Many other [[mathematical object]]s have their origin in the hyperbola, such as [[hyperbolic paraboloid]]s (saddle surfaces), [[hyperboloid]]s (\"wastebaskets\"), [[hyperbolic geometry]] ([[Nikolai Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]]'s celebrated [[non-Euclidean geometry]]), [[hyperbolic function]]s (sinh, cosh, tanh, etc.), and [[gyrovector space]]s (a geometry proposed for use in both [[theory of relativity|relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]] which is not [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]]).\n\n==Etymology and history==\nThe word \"hyperbola\" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae}}, meaning \"over-thrown\" or \"excessive\", from which the English term [[hyperbole]] also derives. Hyperbolae were discovered by [[Menaechmus]] in his investigations of the problem of [[doubling the cube]], but were then called sections of obtuse cones.<ref>{{citation |title=Apollonius of Perga: Treatise on Conic Sections with Introductions Including an Essay on Earlier History on the Subject |first=Sir Thomas Little |last=Heath |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1896 |contribution=Chapter I.

The rectangle could be \"applied\" to the segment (meaning, have an equal length), be shorter than the segment or exceed the segment.<ref>{{citation|pages=30\u201331|first=Howard|last=Eves|title=A Survey of Geometry (Vol. One)|year=1963|publisher=Allyn and Bacon}}</ref>\n\n== Definition of a hyperbola as locus of points ==\n[[File:Hyperbel-def-e.svg|thumb|Hyperbola: definition by the distances of points to two fixed points (foci)]]\n[[File:Hyperbel-def-dc.svg|thumb|Hyperbola: definition with circular directrix]]\nA hyperbola can be defined geometrically as a set of points ([[locus of points]]) in the Euclidean plane:\n\n:A '''hyperbola''' is a set of points, such that for any point <math>P</math> of the set, the absolute difference of the distances <math>|PF_1|,\\ |PF_2|</math> to two fixed points <math>F_1,F_2</math> (the ''foci''), is  constant, usually denoted by <math>2a, \\ a>0\\ :</math><ref>{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey|1970|pp=308\u2013310}}</ref>\n\n:<math>H = \\{P \\mid ||PF_2| - |PF_1 || = 2a \\}\\ .</math>\n\nThe midpoint <math>M</math> of the line segment joining the foci is called the ''center'' of the hyperbola.<ref>{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey|1970|p=310}}</ref> The line through the foci is called the ''major axis''.

A skew reflection is a generalization of an ordinary reflection across a line <math>m</math>, where all point-image pairs are on a line perpendicular to <math>m</math>.\n\nBecause a skew reflection leaves the hyperbola fixed, the pair of asymptotes is fixed, too.

The process of \"reciprocation in a circle ''C''\" consists of replacing every line and point in a geometrical figure with their corresponding [[pole and polar]], respectively. The ''pole'' of a line is the [[inversive geometry#Circle inversion|inversion]] of its closest point to the circle ''C'', whereas the polar of a point is the converse, namely, a line whose closest point to ''C'' is the inversion of the point.\n\nThe eccentricity of the conic section obtained by reciprocation is the ratio of the distances between the two circles' centers to the radius ''r'' of reciprocation circle ''C''. If '''B''' and '''C''' represent the points at the centers of the corresponding circles, then\n\n:<math>\ne = \\frac{\\overline{BC}}{r}.\n</math>\n\nSince the eccentricity of a hyperbola is always greater than one, the center '''B''' must lie outside of the reciprocating circle ''C''.\n\nThis definition implies that the hyperbola is both the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of the poles of the tangent lines to the circle ''B'', as well as the [[envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] of the polar lines of the points on ''B''. Conversely, the circle ''B'' is the envelope of polars of points on the hyperbola, and the locus of poles of tangent lines to the hyperbola. Two tangent lines to ''B'' have no (finite) poles because they pass through the center '''C''' of the reciprocation circle ''C''; the polars of the corresponding tangent points on ''B'' are the asymptotes of the hyperbola. The two branches of the hyperbola correspond to the two parts of the circle ''B'' that are separated by these tangent points.\n\n===Quadratic equation===\nA hyperbola can also be defined as a second-degree equation in the Cartesian coordinates (''x'', ''y'') in the [[plane (geometry)|plane]],\n\n:<math>\nA_{xx} x^2 + 2 A_{xy} xy + A_{yy} y^2 + 2 B_x x + 2 B_y y + C = 0,\n</math>\n\nprovided that the constants ''A''<sub>''xx''</sub>, ''A''<sub>''xy''</sub>, ''A''<sub>''yy''</sub>, ''B''<sub>''x''</sub>, ''B''<sub>''y''</sub>, and ''C'' satisfy the determinant condition\n\n:<math>\nD := \\begin{vmatrix} A_{xx} & A_{xy}\\\\A_{xy} & A_{yy} \\end{vmatrix} < 0.\\,\n</math>\n\nThis determinant is conventionally called the [[discriminant#Discriminant of a conic section|discriminant]] of the conic section.<ref>{{citation\n|title=Math refresher for scientists and engineers\n|first1=John R.\n|last1=Fanchi\n|publisher=John Wiley and Sons\n|year=2006\n|isbn=0-471-75715-2\n|pages=44\u201345\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75mAJPcAWT8C}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=75mAJPcAWT8C&pg=PA45 Section 3.2, page 45]\n</ref>\n\nA special case of a hyperbola\u2014the ''[[degenerate conic|degenerate hyperbola]]'' consisting of two intersecting lines\u2014occurs when another determinant is zero:\n\n:<math>\n\\Delta := \\begin{vmatrix} A_{xx} & A_{xy} & B_x \\\\A_{xy} & A_{yy} & B_y \\\\ B_x & B_y & C \\end{vmatrix} = 0.\n</math>\n\nThis determinant \u0394 is sometimes called the discriminant of the conic section.<ref>Korn, Granino A. and Korn, Theresa M.

The special case of a parabola does not appear in this example.<br />\n(If center ''O'' were ''on'' the sphere, all images of the circles would be circles or lines; see [[stereographic projection]]).]]\nBesides providing a uniform description of circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, conic sections can also be understood as a natural model of the geometry of perspective in the case where the scene being viewed consists of circles, or more generally an ellipse. The viewer is typically a camera or the human eye and the image of the scene a [[central projection]] onto an image plane, that is, all projection rays pass a fixed point ''O'', the center. The '''lens plane''' is a plane parallel to the image plane at the lens ''O''.\n\nThe image of a circle c is \n:a) a '''circle''', if circle ''c'' is in a special position, for example parallel to the image plane and others (see stereographic projection),\n:b) an '''ellipse''', if ''c'' has ''no'' point with the lens plane in common,\n:c) a '''parabola''', if ''c'' has ''one'' point with the lens plane in common and\n:d) a '''hyperbola''', if ''c'' has ''two'' points with the lens plane in common.\n\n(Special positions where the circle plane contains point ''O'' are omitted.)\n\nThese results can be understood if one recognizes that the projection process can be seen in two steps: 1) circle c and point ''O'' generate a cone which is 2) cut by the image plane, in order to generate the image.\n\nOne sees a hyperbola whenever catching sight of a portion of a circle cut by one's lens plane. The inability to see very much of the arms of the visible branch, combined with the complete absence of the second branch, makes it virtually impossible for the human visual system to recognize the connection with hyperbolas.\n\n==Arc length==\nThe arc length of a hyperbola does not have a [[Closed-form expression|closed-form expression]]. The upper half of a hyperbola can be parameterized as\n\n:<math>y=b\\sqrt{\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-1}.</math>\n\nThen the integral giving the arc length <math>s</math> from <math>x_{1}</math> to <math>x_{2}</math> can be computed [[Numerical integration|numerically]]:\n\n:<math>s=b\\int_{\\operatorname{arcosh}\\frac{x_{1}}{a}}^{\\operatorname{arcosh}\\frac{x_{2}}{a}} \\sqrt{1+\\left(1+\\frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right) \\sinh ^{2}v} \\, \\mathrm dv.</math>\n\nAfter using the substitution <math>z=iv</math>, this can also be represented using the [[Elliptic integral|elliptic integral]] of the second kind with parameter <math>m=k^{2}</math>:\n\n:<math>s=-ib\\Biggr[E\\left(iz \\, \\Biggr| \\, 1+\\frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right)\\Biggr]^{\\operatorname{arcosh}\\frac{x_{2}}{a}}_{\\operatorname{arcosh}\\frac{x_{1}}{a}}.</math>\n\n==Derived curves==\n{{Sinusoidal_spirals.svg}}\nSeveral other curves can be derived from the hyperbola by [[inversive geometry#Circle inversion|inversion]], the so-called [[inverse curve]]s of the hyperbola. If the center of inversion is chosen as the hyperbola's own center, the inverse curve is the [[lemniscate of Bernoulli]]; the lemniscate is also the envelope of circles centered on a rectangular hyperbola and passing through the origin. If the center of inversion is chosen at a focus or a vertex of the hyperbola, the resulting inverse curves are a [[lima\u00e7on]] or a [[strophoid]], respectively.\n\n== Elliptic coordinates ==\nA family of confocal hyperbolas is the basis of the system of [[elliptic coordinates]] in two dimensions. These hyperbolas are described by the equation\n\n:<math>\n\\left(\\frac x {c \\cos\\theta}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac y {c \\sin\\theta}\\right)^2 = 1\n</math>\n\nwhere the foci are located at a distance ''c'' from the origin on the ''x''-axis, and where \u03b8 is the angle of the asymptotes with the ''x''-axis. Every hyperbola in this family is orthogonal to every ellipse that shares the same foci. This orthogonality may be shown by a [[conformal map]] of the Cartesian coordinate system ''w'' = ''z'' + 1/''z'', where ''z''= ''x'' + ''iy'' are the original Cartesian coordinates, and ''w''=''u'' + ''iv'' are those after the transformation.\n\nOther orthogonal two-dimensional coordinate systems involving hyperbolas may be obtained by other conformal mappings. For example, the mapping ''w'' = ''z''<sup>2</sup> transforms the Cartesian coordinate system into two families of orthogonal hyperbolas.\n\n==Other properties of hyperbolas==\n*The following are [[concurrent lines|concurrent]]: (1) a circle passing through the hyperbola's foci and centered at the hyperbola's center; (2) either of the lines that are tangent to the hyperbola at the vertices; and (3) either of the asymptotes of the hyperbola.<ref name=web4>{{cite web|url=http://mathafou.free.fr/themes_en/hyperb.html|title=Hyperbola|website=Mathafou.free.fr|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"web1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ul.ie/~rynnet/swconics/HP%27s.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-06-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202180210/http://www3.ul.ie/~rynnet/swconics/HP's.htm |archive-date=2017-02-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*The following are also concurrent: (1) the circle that is centered at the hyperbola's center and that passes through the hyperbola's vertices; (2) either directrix; and (3) either of the asymptotes.<ref name=web1/>\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Akademia Ekonomiczna w Krakowie Pawilon C.JPG|thumb|right|Hyperbolas as declination lines on a sundial]]\n\n===Sundials===\nHyperbolas may be seen in many [[sundial]]s. On any given day, the sun revolves in a circle on the [[celestial sphere]], and its rays striking the point on a sundial traces out a cone of light. The intersection of this cone with the horizontal plane of the ground forms a conic section. At most populated latitudes and at most times of the year, this conic section is a hyperbola. In practical terms, the shadow of the tip of a pole traces out a hyperbola on the ground over the course of a day (this path is called the ''declination line''). The shape of this hyperbola varies with the geographical latitude and with the time of the year, since those factors affect the cone of the sun's rays relative to the horizon. The collection of such hyperbolas for a whole year at a given location was called a ''pelekinon'' by the Greeks, since it resembles a double-bladed axe.\n\n===Multilateration===\nA hyperbola is the basis for solving [[multilateration]] problems, the task of locating a point from the differences in its distances to given points \u2014 or, equivalently, the difference in arrival times of synchronized signals between the point and the given points. Such problems are important in navigation, particularly on water; a ship can locate its position from the difference in arrival times of signals from a [[LORAN]] or [[GPS]] transmitters. Conversely, a homing beacon or any transmitter can be located by comparing the arrival times of its signals at two separate receiving stations; such techniques may be used to track objects and people. In particular, the set of possible positions of a point that has a distance difference of 2''a'' from two given points is a hyperbola of vertex separation 2''a'' whose foci are the two given points.\n\n===Path followed by a particle===\nThe path followed by any particle in the classical [[Kepler problem]] is a [[conic section]]. In particular, if the total energy ''E'' of the particle is greater than zero (that is, if the particle is unbound), the path of such a particle is a hyperbola. This property is useful in studying atomic and sub-atomic forces by scattering high-energy particles; for example, the [[Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment|Rutherford experiment]] demonstrated the existence of an [[atomic nucleus]] by examining the scattering of [[alpha particle]]s from [[gold]] atoms. If the short-range nuclear interactions are ignored, the atomic nucleus and the alpha particle interact only by a repulsive [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]], which satisfies the [[inverse square law]] requirement for a Kepler problem.\n\n===Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation===\nThe hyperbolic trig function <math>\\operatorname{sech}\\, x</math> appears as one solution to the [[Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation]] which describes the motion of a soliton wave in a canal.\n\n===Angle trisection===\n[[File:Hyperbola angle trisection.svg|thumb|Trisecting an angle (AOB) using a hyperbola of eccentricity 2 (yellow curve)]]\n\nAs shown first by [[Apollonius of Perga]], a hyperbola can be used to [[angle trisection|trisect any angle]], a well studied problem of geometry. Given an angle, first draw a circle centered at its vertex '''O''', which intersects the sides of the angle at points '''A''' and '''B'''. Next draw the line segment with endpoints  '''A''' and '''B''' and its perpendicular bisector <math>\\ell</math>. Construct a hyperbola of [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] ''e''=2 with <math>\\ell</math> as [[Directrix (conic section)|directrix]] and '''B''' as a focus. Let '''P''' be the intersection (upper) of the hyperbola with the circle. Angle '''POB''' trisects angle '''AOB'''.\n\nTo prove this, reflect the line segment '''OP''' about the line <math>\\ell</math> obtaining the point '''P'''' as the image of '''P'''.

A hyperbola has two pieces, called [[connected component (graph theory)|connected component]]s or branches, that are mirror images of each other and resemble two infinite [[bow (weapon)|bows]].  The hyperbola is one of the three kinds of [[conic section]], formed by the intersection of a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] and a double [[cone (geometry)|cone]].  (The other conic sections are the [[parabola]] and the [[ellipse]]. A [[circle]] is a special case of an ellipse.) If the plane intersects both halves of the double cone but does not pass through the apex of the cones, then the conic is a hyperbola.\n\nHyperbolas arise in many ways: \n* as the curve representing the function <math>f(x) = 1/x</math> in the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian plane]],<ref>{{harvtxt|Oakley|1944|p=17}}</ref>\n* as the path followed by the shadow of the tip of a [[sundial]],\n* as the shape of an [[open orbit]] (as distinct from a closed elliptical orbit), such as the orbit of a [[spacecraft]] during a [[gravity assist]]ed swing-by of a planet or, more generally, any spacecraft exceeding the [[escape velocity]] of the nearest planet,\n* as the path of a single-apparition [[comet]] (one travelling too fast ever to return to the solar system),\n* as the [[Rutherford scattering|scattering trajectory]] of a [[subatomic particle]] (acted on by repulsive instead of attractive forces but the principle is the same),\n* in [[hyperbolic navigation|radio navigation]], when the difference between distances to two points, but not the distances themselves, can be determined,\nand so on.\n\nEach [[branch (mathematics)|branch]] of the hyperbola has two arms which become straighter (lower curvature) further out from the center of the hyperbola. Diagonally opposite arms, one from each branch, tend in the limit to a common line, called the [[asymptote]] of those two arms. So there are two asymptotes, whose intersection is at the center of [[symmetry]] of the hyperbola, which can be thought of as the mirror point about which each branch reflects to form the other branch. In the case of the curve <math>f(x) = 1/x</math> the asymptotes are the two [[coordinate axes]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Oakley|1944|p=17}}</ref>\n\nHyperbolas share many of the ellipses' analytical properties such as [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]], [[focus (geometry)|focus]], and [[directrix (conic section)|directrix]]. Typically the correspondence can be made with nothing more than a change of sign in some term. Many other [[mathematical object]]s have their origin in the hyperbola, such as [[hyperbolic paraboloid]]s (saddle surfaces), [[hyperboloid]]s (\"wastebaskets\"), [[hyperbolic geometry]] ([[Nikolai Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]]'s celebrated [[non-Euclidean geometry]]), [[hyperbolic function]]s (sinh, cosh, tanh, etc.), and [[gyrovector space]]s (a geometry proposed for use in both [[theory of relativity|relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]] which is not [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]]).\n\n==Etymology and history==\nThe word \"hyperbola\" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae}}, meaning \"over-thrown\" or \"excessive\", from which the English term [[hyperbole]] also derives. Hyperbolae were discovered by [[Menaechmus]] in his investigations of the problem of [[doubling the cube]], but were then called sections of obtuse cones.<ref>{{citation |title=Apollonius of Perga: Treatise on Conic Sections with Introductions Including an Essay on Earlier History on the Subject |first=Sir Thomas Little |last=Heath |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1896 |contribution=Chapter I.

The rectangle could be \"applied\" to the segment (meaning, have an equal length), be shorter than the segment or exceed the segment.<ref>{{citation|pages=30\u201331|first=Howard|last=Eves|title=A Survey of Geometry (Vol. One)|year=1963|publisher=Allyn and Bacon}}</ref>\n\n== Definition of a hyperbola as locus of points ==\n[[File:Hyperbel-def-e.svg|thumb|Hyperbola: definition by the distances of points to two fixed points (foci)]]\n[[File:Hyperbel-def-dc.svg|thumb|Hyperbola: definition with circular directrix]]\nA hyperbola can be defined geometrically as a set of points ([[locus of points]]) in the Euclidean plane:\n\n:A '''hyperbola''' is a set of points, such that for any point <math>P</math> of the set, the absolute difference of the distances <math>|PF_1|,\\ |PF_2|</math> to two fixed points <math>F_1,F_2</math> (the ''foci''), is  constant, usually denoted by <math>2a, \\ a>0\\ :</math><ref>{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey|1970|pp=308\u2013310}}</ref>\n\n:<math>H = \\{P \\mid ||PF_2| - |PF_1 || = 2a \\}\\ .</math>\n\nThe midpoint <math>M</math> of the line segment joining the foci is called the ''center'' of the hyperbola.<ref>{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey|1970|p=310}}</ref> The line through the foci is called the ''major axis''.

A skew reflection is a generalization of an ordinary reflection across a line <math>m</math>, where all point-image pairs are on a line perpendicular to <math>m</math>.\n\nBecause a skew reflection leaves the hyperbola fixed, the pair of asymptotes is fixed, too.

The process of \"reciprocation in a circle ''C''\" consists of replacing every line and point in a geometrical figure with their corresponding [[pole and polar]], respectively. The ''pole'' of a line is the [[inversive geometry#Circle inversion|inversion]] of its closest point to the circle ''C'', whereas the polar of a point is the converse, namely, a line whose closest point to ''C'' is the inversion of the point.\n\nThe eccentricity of the conic section obtained by reciprocation is the ratio of the distances between the two circles' centers to the radius ''r'' of reciprocation circle ''C''. If '''B''' and '''C''' represent the points at the centers of the corresponding circles, then\n\n:<math>\ne = \\frac{\\overline{BC}}{r}.\n</math>\n\nSince the eccentricity of a hyperbola is always greater than one, the center '''B''' must lie outside of the reciprocating circle ''C''.\n\nThis definition implies that the hyperbola is both the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of the poles of the tangent lines to the circle ''B'', as well as the [[envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] of the polar lines of the points on ''B''. Conversely, the circle ''B'' is the envelope of polars of points on the hyperbola, and the locus of poles of tangent lines to the hyperbola. Two tangent lines to ''B'' have no (finite) poles because they pass through the center '''C''' of the reciprocation circle ''C''; the polars of the corresponding tangent points on ''B'' are the asymptotes of the hyperbola. The two branches of the hyperbola correspond to the two parts of the circle ''B'' that are separated by these tangent points.\n\n===Quadratic equation===\nA hyperbola can also be defined as a second-degree equation in the Cartesian coordinates (''x'', ''y'') in the [[plane (geometry)|plane]],\n\n:<math>\nA_{xx} x^2 + 2 A_{xy} xy + A_{yy} y^2 + 2 B_x x + 2 B_y y + C = 0,\n</math>\n\nprovided that the constants ''A''<sub>''xx''</sub>, ''A''<sub>''xy''</sub>, ''A''<sub>''yy''</sub>, ''B''<sub>''x''</sub>, ''B''<sub>''y''</sub>, and ''C'' satisfy the determinant condition\n\n:<math>\nD := \\begin{vmatrix} A_{xx} & A_{xy}\\\\A_{xy} & A_{yy} \\end{vmatrix} < 0.\\,\n</math>\n\nThis determinant is conventionally called the [[discriminant#Discriminant of a conic section|discriminant]] of the conic section.<ref>{{citation\n|title=Math refresher for scientists and engineers\n|first1=John R.\n|last1=Fanchi\n|publisher=John Wiley and Sons\n|year=2006\n|isbn=0-471-75715-2\n|pages=44\u201345\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75mAJPcAWT8C}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=75mAJPcAWT8C&pg=PA45 Section 3.2, page 45]\n</ref>\n\nA special case of a hyperbola\u2014the ''[[degenerate conic|degenerate hyperbola]]'' consisting of two intersecting lines\u2014occurs when another determinant is zero:\n\n:<math>\n\\Delta := \\begin{vmatrix} A_{xx} & A_{xy} & B_x \\\\A_{xy} & A_{yy} & B_y \\\\ B_x & B_y & C \\end{vmatrix} = 0.\n</math>\n\nThis determinant \u0394 is sometimes called the discriminant of the conic section.<ref>Korn, Granino A. and Korn, Theresa M.

The special case of a parabola does not appear in this example.<br />\n(If center ''O'' were ''on'' the sphere, all images of the circles would be circles or lines; see [[stereographic projection]]).]]\nBesides providing a uniform description of circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, conic sections can also be understood as a natural model of the geometry of perspective in the case where the scene being viewed consists of circles, or more generally an ellipse. The viewer is typically a camera or the human eye and the image of the scene a [[central projection]] onto an image plane, that is, all projection rays pass a fixed point ''O'', the center. The '''lens plane''' is a plane parallel to the image plane at the lens ''O''.\n\nThe image of a circle c is \n:a) a '''circle''', if circle ''c'' is in a special position, for example parallel to the image plane and others (see stereographic projection),\n:b) an '''ellipse''', if ''c'' has ''no'' point with the lens plane in common,\n:c) a '''parabola''', if ''c'' has ''one'' point with the lens plane in common and\n:d) a '''hyperbola''', if ''c'' has ''two'' points with the lens plane in common.\n\n(Special positions where the circle plane contains point ''O'' are omitted.)\n\nThese results can be understood if one recognizes that the projection process can be seen in two steps: 1) circle c and point ''O'' generate a cone which is 2) cut by the image plane, in order to generate the image.\n\nOne sees a hyperbola whenever catching sight of a portion of a circle cut by one's lens plane. The inability to see very much of the arms of the visible branch, combined with the complete absence of the second branch, makes it virtually impossible for the human visual system to recognize the connection with hyperbolas.\n\n==Arc length==\nThe arc length of a hyperbola does not have a [[Closed-form expression|closed-form expression]]. The upper half of a hyperbola can be parameterized as\n\n:<math>y=b\\sqrt{\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-1}.</math>\n\nThen the integral giving the arc length <math>s</math> from <math>x_{1}</math> to <math>x_{2}</math> can be computed [[Numerical integration|numerically]]:\n\n:<math>s=b\\int_{\\operatorname{arcosh}\\frac{x_{1}}{a}}^{\\operatorname{arcosh}\\frac{x_{2}}{a}} \\sqrt{1+\\left(1+\\frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right) \\sinh ^{2}v} \\, \\mathrm dv.</math>\n\nAfter using the substitution <math>z=iv</math>, this can also be represented using the [[Elliptic integral|elliptic integral]] of the second kind with parameter <math>m=k^{2}</math>:\n\n:<math>s=-ib\\Biggr[E\\left(iz \\, \\Biggr| \\, 1+\\frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right)\\Biggr]^{\\operatorname{arcosh}\\frac{x_{2}}{a}}_{\\operatorname{arcosh}\\frac{x_{1}}{a}}.</math>\n\n==Derived curves==\n{{Sinusoidal_spirals.svg}}\nSeveral other curves can be derived from the hyperbola by [[inversive geometry#Circle inversion|inversion]], the so-called [[inverse curve]]s of the hyperbola. If the center of inversion is chosen as the hyperbola's own center, the inverse curve is the [[lemniscate of Bernoulli]]; the lemniscate is also the envelope of circles centered on a rectangular hyperbola and passing through the origin. If the center of inversion is chosen at a focus or a vertex of the hyperbola, the resulting inverse curves are a [[lima\u00e7on]] or a [[strophoid]], respectively.\n\n== Elliptic coordinates ==\nA family of confocal hyperbolas is the basis of the system of [[elliptic coordinates]] in two dimensions. These hyperbolas are described by the equation\n\n:<math>\n\\left(\\frac x {c \\cos\\theta}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac y {c \\sin\\theta}\\right)^2 = 1\n</math>\n\nwhere the foci are located at a distance ''c'' from the origin on the ''x''-axis, and where \u03b8 is the angle of the asymptotes with the ''x''-axis. Every hyperbola in this family is orthogonal to every ellipse that shares the same foci. This orthogonality may be shown by a [[conformal map]] of the Cartesian coordinate system ''w'' = ''z'' + 1/''z'', where ''z''= ''x'' + ''iy'' are the original Cartesian coordinates, and ''w''=''u'' + ''iv'' are those after the transformation.\n\nOther orthogonal two-dimensional coordinate systems involving hyperbolas may be obtained by other conformal mappings. For example, the mapping ''w'' = ''z''<sup>2</sup> transforms the Cartesian coordinate system into two families of orthogonal hyperbolas.\n\n==Other properties of hyperbolas==\n*The following are [[concurrent lines|concurrent]]: (1) a circle passing through the hyperbola's foci and centered at the hyperbola's center; (2) either of the lines that are tangent to the hyperbola at the vertices; and (3) either of the asymptotes of the hyperbola.<ref name=web4>{{cite web|url=http://mathafou.free.fr/themes_en/hyperb.html|title=Hyperbola|website=Mathafou.free.fr|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"web1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ul.ie/~rynnet/swconics/HP%27s.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-06-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202180210/http://www3.ul.ie/~rynnet/swconics/HP's.htm |archive-date=2017-02-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*The following are also concurrent: (1) the circle that is centered at the hyperbola's center and that passes through the hyperbola's vertices; (2) either directrix; and (3) either of the asymptotes.<ref name=web1/>\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Akademia Ekonomiczna w Krakowie Pawilon C.JPG|thumb|right|Hyperbolas as declination lines on a sundial]]\n\n===Sundials===\nHyperbolas may be seen in many [[sundial]]s. On any given day, the sun revolves in a circle on the [[celestial sphere]], and its rays striking the point on a sundial traces out a cone of light. The intersection of this cone with the horizontal plane of the ground forms a conic section. At most populated latitudes and at most times of the year, this conic section is a hyperbola. In practical terms, the shadow of the tip of a pole traces out a hyperbola on the ground over the course of a day (this path is called the ''declination line''). The shape of this hyperbola varies with the geographical latitude and with the time of the year, since those factors affect the cone of the sun's rays relative to the horizon. The collection of such hyperbolas for a whole year at a given location was called a ''pelekinon'' by the Greeks, since it resembles a double-bladed axe.\n\n===Multilateration===\nA hyperbola is the basis for solving [[multilateration]] problems, the task of locating a point from the differences in its distances to given points \u2014 or, equivalently, the difference in arrival times of synchronized signals between the point and the given points. Such problems are important in navigation, particularly on water; a ship can locate its position from the difference in arrival times of signals from a [[LORAN]] or [[GPS]] transmitters. Conversely, a homing beacon or any transmitter can be located by comparing the arrival times of its signals at two separate receiving stations; such techniques may be used to track objects and people. In particular, the set of possible positions of a point that has a distance difference of 2''a'' from two given points is a hyperbola of vertex separation 2''a'' whose foci are the two given points.\n\n===Path followed by a particle===\nThe path followed by any particle in the classical [[Kepler problem]] is a [[conic section]]. In particular, if the total energy ''E'' of the particle is greater than zero (that is, if the particle is unbound), the path of such a particle is a hyperbola. This property is useful in studying atomic and sub-atomic forces by scattering high-energy particles; for example, the [[Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment|Rutherford experiment]] demonstrated the existence of an [[atomic nucleus]] by examining the scattering of [[alpha particle]]s from [[gold]] atoms. If the short-range nuclear interactions are ignored, the atomic nucleus and the alpha particle interact only by a repulsive [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]], which satisfies the [[inverse square law]] requirement for a Kepler problem.\n\n===Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation===\nThe hyperbolic trig function <math>\\operatorname{sech}\\, x</math> appears as one solution to the [[Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation]] which describes the motion of a soliton wave in a canal.\n\n===Angle trisection===\n[[File:Hyperbola angle trisection.svg|thumb|Trisecting an angle (AOB) using a hyperbola of eccentricity 2 (yellow curve)]]\n\nAs shown first by [[Apollonius of Perga]], a hyperbola can be used to [[angle trisection|trisect any angle]], a well studied problem of geometry. Given an angle, first draw a circle centered at its vertex '''O''', which intersects the sides of the angle at points '''A''' and '''B'''. Next draw the line segment with endpoints  '''A''' and '''B''' and its perpendicular bisector <math>\\ell</math>. Construct a hyperbola of [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] ''e''=2 with <math>\\ell</math> as [[Directrix (conic section)|directrix]] and '''B''' as a focus. Let '''P''' be the intersection (upper) of the hyperbola with the circle. Angle '''POB''' trisects angle '''AOB'''.\n\nTo prove this, reflect the line segment '''OP''' about the line <math>\\ell</math> obtaining the point '''P'''' as the image of '''P'''. Segment '''AP'''' has the same length as segment '''BP''' due to the reflection, while segment '''PP'''' has the same length as segment '''BP''' due to the eccentricity of the hyperbola.

For instance in ninth-century Spain \u27e8saeculum\u27e9 was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce \u27e8knight\u27e9 as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44\u201350</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as \u27e8viridiarium\u27e9 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104\u20137</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] completely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later- at the [[Council of Tours]]- to order them to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in plain roman speech', i.e. in Romance.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122\u201332, 143\u20134</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.

For instance in ninth-century Spain \u27e8saeculum\u27e9 was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce \u27e8knight\u27e9 as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44\u201350</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as \u27e8viridiarium\u27e9 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104\u20137</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] completely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later- at the [[Council of Tours]]- to order them to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in plain roman speech', i.e. in Romance.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122\u201332, 143\u20134</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.

He earned an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for the screenplay he wrote for the film ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (film)|Kiss of the Spider Woman]]''.\n\n==Early life and college==\nBorn in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], Schrader was brought up in a strict [[Calvinism|Dutch Calvinist]] family and did not see his first film until he was an adult. In 1968, he finished his [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] at the [[University of Iowa]]'s Writer's Workshop where he studied with [[Nelson Algren]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Richard Yates (novelist)|Richard Yates]], [[Robert Coover]], [[Jos\u00e9 Donoso]] and [[Jorge Luis Borges]].\n\n==Japan==\nAfter graduating, Schrader left Grand Rapids in [[the Midwest]] and escaped the draft by moving to Japan to teach. (According to [[Peter Biskind]], in his book ''[[Easy Riders, Raging Bulls]]'', Schrader left the U.S. when he received a draft induction notice and didn't return until he was 28 years old - and thus ineligible for the draft.)\n\nBetween 1969-73 Schrader escaped even further, slipping by night into the subculture of the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]] (the dominant [[Yakuza]] gangster organization in the [[Kansai]] area of Japan, which includes [[Kobe]], [[Kyoto]] and [[Osaka]]), while by day teaching American Literature at [[Doshisha University]] and [[Kyoto University]].\n\nDuring his time in Japan he met his future wife, Chieko Schrader. They married in 1977.\n\nHis living family includes brother Paul Schrader, niece Molly, and nephew Sam.\n\n==Film career==\nHis experiences with the Yakuza in Japan led to a collaboration on a story with his brother, [[Paul Schrader]]. This resulted in the film ''[[The Yakuza]]'' (1974), starring [[Robert Mitchum]] and directed by [[Sydney Pollack]]. Leonard and Paul also co-wrote ''[[Blue Collar (film)|Blue Collar]]'' (1978), a story of defiant auto-workers in Detroit, directed by Paul Schrader starring [[Richard Pryor]] and [[Harvey Keitel]], and ''[[Old Boyfriends]]'' (1979), about a woman's cross-country trek to visit old flames, directed by [[Joan Tewkesbury]] and starring [[John Belushi]], [[Talia Shire]], [[Keith Carradine]], [[John Houseman]].\n\nSchrader's other screenplay credits include such popular Japanese-language films as Tora-san's ''Dream of Spring'' (1979), ''[[The Man Who Stole the Sun]]'' (Japan's Best Film of the Year in 1980), and ''Shonben Rider'' (1983). In 1982, with wife Chieko Schrader, he co-wrote ''[[The Killing of America]]'', a documentary tracing the origins of U.S. violence. During this production, Leonard Schrader collaborated with New York experimental filmmaker, [[David Weisman]].\n\nSchrader's background in [[Latin American literature]] and Weisman's experience with Brazil led them to develop ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (film)|Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'' together.

(It also earned [[William Hurt]] an Academy Award for Best Actor.)\n\nSchrader met renowned Japanese novelist [[Yukio Mishima]] while living in Japan. For a decade after the author's ritual suicide in 1970, Schrader pursued the rights to Mishima's life, and working with his wife Chieko and brother Paul, he co-wrote the Japanese-language bio-pic ''[[Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters]]'' executive-produced in 1984 by [[George Lucas]] and [[Francis Ford Coppola]], and directed by [[Paul Schrader]].\n\nSchrader made his directorial debut with ''[[Naked Tango]]'' (1991) for which he also wrote the screenplay.

He earned an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for the screenplay he wrote for the film ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (film)|Kiss of the Spider Woman]]''.\n\n==Early life and college==\nBorn in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], Schrader was brought up in a strict [[Calvinism|Dutch Calvinist]] family and did not see his first film until he was an adult. In 1968, he finished his [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] at the [[University of Iowa]]'s Writer's Workshop where he studied with [[Nelson Algren]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Richard Yates (novelist)|Richard Yates]], [[Robert Coover]], [[Jos\u00e9 Donoso]] and [[Jorge Luis Borges]].\n\n==Japan==\nAfter graduating, Schrader left Grand Rapids in [[the Midwest]] and escaped the draft by moving to Japan to teach. (According to [[Peter Biskind]], in his book ''[[Easy Riders, Raging Bulls]]'', Schrader left the U.S. when he received a draft induction notice and didn't return until he was 28 years old - and thus ineligible for the draft.)\n\nBetween 1969-73 Schrader escaped even further, slipping by night into the subculture of the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]] (the dominant [[Yakuza]] gangster organization in the [[Kansai]] area of Japan, which includes [[Kobe]], [[Kyoto]] and [[Osaka]]), while by day teaching American Literature at [[Doshisha University]] and [[Kyoto University]].\n\nDuring his time in Japan he met his future wife, Chieko Schrader. They married in 1977.\n\nHis living family includes brother Paul Schrader, niece Molly, and nephew Sam.\n\n==Film career==\nHis experiences with the Yakuza in Japan led to a collaboration on a story with his brother, [[Paul Schrader]]. This resulted in the film ''[[The Yakuza]]'' (1974), starring [[Robert Mitchum]] and directed by [[Sydney Pollack]]. Leonard and Paul also co-wrote ''[[Blue Collar (film)|Blue Collar]]'' (1978), a story of defiant auto-workers in Detroit, directed by Paul Schrader starring [[Richard Pryor]] and [[Harvey Keitel]], and ''[[Old Boyfriends]]'' (1979), about a woman's cross-country trek to visit old flames, directed by [[Joan Tewkesbury]] and starring [[John Belushi]], [[Talia Shire]], [[Keith Carradine]], [[John Houseman]].\n\nSchrader's other screenplay credits include such popular Japanese-language films as Tora-san's ''Dream of Spring'' (1979), ''[[The Man Who Stole the Sun]]'' (Japan's Best Film of the Year in 1980), and ''Shonben Rider'' (1983).

Milt Joyce, owner of the Oriental Saloon and chairman of [[Cochise County, Arizona]] supervisors was also seen as a leader of the Ten Percent Ring. The Tombstone Epitaph was started by [[John Clum]] in 1880. <ref>The Tombstone Epitaph, December 25, 1881.</ref> The newspaper outlined the corruption charges of Johnny Behan the Cochise County [[sheriff]]. <ref>James Covington Hancock Papers, Arizona Historical Society, Tucson.</ref> <ref>Wyatt Earp: A Vigilante Life, Andrew C. Isenberg page 241</ref> When Johnny Behan was the Cochise County sheriff one of his duties was collecting prostitution, gambling, liquor, and theater taxes. As part of his pay, he received 10% of all proceeds collected. There was much talk in the town about the [[Graft (politics)|graft]] [[political corruption]] of the sheriff. For this many saw Behan as the head of the Ten Percent Ring and a friend of the outlaw [[Cochise County Cowboys]]. Others accused of members of the ring was Artemus Fay, owner of the Tombstone's first newspaper, the ''Tombstone Nugget'' and Harry Wood a writer for the ''Nugget'' and an under-sheriff of Behan. Behan so focuseded on taxes, that he was very soft on crime.
