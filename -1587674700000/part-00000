It is a large forest [[tree]] of the [[Eastern United States]] and [[Southern Ontario]] in Canada. It is a tree that tends to occur singly as scattered specimens, rather than in groves.<ref name=sternberg>Sternberg, G., & Wilson, J. (2004). Native Trees for North American Landscapes. Portland, Oregon:Timber Press</ref>\n\nThe cucumber tree is native primarily within the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] belt, including the [[Allegheny Plateau]] and [[Cumberland Plateau]], up to western [[Pennsylvania]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]. There are also numerous disconnected outlying populations through much of the southeastern U.S., and a few small populations in [[Southern Ontario|Southern]] [[Ontario]]. In Canada, the cucumber tree is listed as an [[endangered]] species and is protected under the Canadian [[Species at Risk Act]].<ref name=white>White, D.J. (2000).

They come in two forms, acuminate at both ends, or moderately cordate at the base (these are usually only formed high in the tree).\n\n{{Gallery\n}}\n\nUnlike most magnolias, the [[flower]]s are not showy. They are typically small, yellow-green, and borne high in the tree in April through June. The leaves of Magnolia acuminata are pointed at the tip and provide it with its name - 'acuminate' means tapering to a fine point. The name Cucumber Tree refers to the unripe [[fruit]], which is green and often shaped like a small [[cucumber]]; the fruit matures to a dark red color and is 6\u20138&nbsp;cm long and 4&nbsp;cm broad, with the individual carpels splitting open to release the bright red [[seed]]s, 10-60 per fruit. The ripe fruit is a striking reddish orange color.\n\n== Uses and cultivation ==\nCucumber trees are excellent shade trees for [[park]]s and [[garden]]s, though they are not recommended for use as street trees. In cultivation, they typically only grow {{convert|15|\u2013|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, although they reach over {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} in ideal [[forest]] situations. They can become quite massive: the United States national (and presumed world) champion in [[Stark County, Ohio]] measures eight feet (4.2 m) in diameter and {{convert|96|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall. They grow best in deep, moist, well-drained [[soil]]s that are slightly [[acidic]] although they are tolerant of [[alkali]]ne [[soils]].\n\nThey are tricky to [[Transplanting|transplant]] due to their coarse, fleshy [[root|root system]] and should be planted shallow and moved in early spring with a good soil ball.\n\nIn the [[timber]] trade, the wood of this tree is interchangeable with that of the related [[Liriodendron|tuliptree]] (''Liriodendron tulipifera'').\n\n''Magnolia acuminata'' has been used in hybridizing new varieties that share its yellow flower color and cold hardiness.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"240\" heights=\"190\" mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Magnolia acuminata leaves 01 by Line1.jpg|Leaves\nFile:Cucumber magnolia.jpg|Fruit\nFile:Cucumber Magnolia Magnolia acuminata Bark Vertical.JPG|Bark\nFile:Cucumber tree sections.jpg|Sections of timber from ''[[The American Woods]]''\nFile:Magnolia acuminata maturing fruit.jpg|Maturing fruit\nFile:Magnolia acuminata mature fruit.jpg|Mature fruit\nFile:Magnolia acuminata leaves.jpg|Leaves\nFile:Magnolia acuminata tree.jpg|1880 accession (#15154*D), Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110606200035/http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/maac.htm ''Magnolia acuminata'' images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu]\n*[http://www.efloras.org/object_page.aspx?object_id=6419&flora_id=1 Flora of N.Amer-RangeMap: ''Magnolia acuminata'']\n*[http://remarkabletree.cnre.vt.edu/detail.cfm?AutofieldforPrimaryKey=1249 ''Famous example at Violet Banks in Virginia'' posted at remarkabletree.cnre.vt.edu]\n*[https://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/image-search/?keyword=Magnolia+acuminata&submit=Search ''Magnolia acuminata'' images at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University Plant Image Database]\n*Damery, Jonathan.

The car received a wider (4 cm) and longer (3 cm) body, a longer (4 cm) wheelbase and a wider (7 cm) gauge. However, ground clearance was reduced by a centimeter, thereby reducing the height by a centimeter.

However, ground clearance was reduced by a centimeter, thereby reducing the height by a centimeter.

As the demand for non-business began during the first battles of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904, the agency had to change its name to the St. Petersburg Telegraph Agency (SPTA). As there was no change of headquarters and almost no change in its staff and function, it was a mere rebranding.\n\nIn August 1914, one day after [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] was renamed Petrograd, SPTA was renamed the Petrograd Telegraph Agency (PTA). It was seized by [[Bolsheviks]] in November 1917 and by December was renamed as the Central Information Agency of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russian]] [[Government of the Soviet Union|Council of People's Commissars]]. On 7 September 1918, the presidium renamed PTA and the Press bureau into the Russian Telegraph Agency (ROSTA), which became \"the central information agency of the whole Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic\".{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n=== 1925: TASS ===\n[[File:Zdanie tass.jpg|right|thumb|TASS building entrance with globe]]\n\nIn July 1925 the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (''Telegrafnoye agentstvo Sovetskogo Soyuza'', TASS) was established by a decree of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]], and took over the duties of the ROSTA as the country's central information agency. TASS enjoyed \"exclusive right to gather and distribute information outside the Soviet Union, as well as the right to distribute foreign and domestic information within the Soviet Union, and manage the news agencies of the Soviet republics\". Official state information was delivered as the ''TASS Report'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u0421\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0422\u0410\u0421\u0421}}, ''Soobshchyeniye TASS'').\n\nTASS included affiliated news agencies in all 14 Soviet republics in addition to Russia: RATAU ([[Ukrainian SSR]], now [[Ukrinform]]), [[Belarusian Telegraph Agency|BelTA]] ([[Byelorussian SSR]]), ETA ([[Estonian SSR]]), Latinform ([[Latvian SSR]], now [[LETA]]), [[ELTA]] ([[Lithuanian SSR]]), ATEM ([[Moldavian SSR]], now [[Moldpres]]), [[Armenpress]] ([[Armenian SSR]]), Gruzinform ([[Georgian SSR]]), Azerinform ([[Azerbaijan SSR]], now [[AZERTAC]]), UzTAG ([[Uzbek SSR]], now [[Uzbekistan National News Agency|UzA]]), KazTAG ([[Kazakh SSR]], now [[Kazinform]]), KyrTAG ([[Kyrgyz SSR]], now [[Kabar (news agency)|Kabar]]), Turkmeninform ([[Turkmen SSR]], now [[TDH (news agency)|TDH]]) and TajikTA ([[Tajik SSR]], now [[Khovar]]).

As the demand for non-business began during the first battles of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904, the agency had to change its name to the St. Petersburg Telegraph Agency (SPTA). As there was no change of headquarters and almost no change in its staff and function, it was a mere rebranding.\n\nIn August 1914, one day after [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] was renamed Petrograd, SPTA was renamed the Petrograd Telegraph Agency (PTA). It was seized by [[Bolsheviks]] in November 1917 and by December was renamed as the Central Information Agency of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russian]] [[Government of the Soviet Union|Council of People's Commissars]]. On 7 September 1918, the presidium renamed PTA and the Press bureau into the Russian Telegraph Agency (ROSTA), which became \"the central information agency of the whole Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic\".{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n=== 1925: TASS ===\n[[File:Zdanie tass.jpg|right|thumb|TASS building entrance with globe]]\n\nIn July 1925 the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (''Telegrafnoye agentstvo Sovetskogo Soyuza'', TASS) was established by a decree of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]], and took over the duties of the ROSTA as the country's central information agency. TASS enjoyed \"exclusive right to gather and distribute information outside the Soviet Union, as well as the right to distribute foreign and domestic information within the Soviet Union, and manage the news agencies of the Soviet republics\". Official state information was delivered as the ''TASS Report'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u0421\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0422\u0410\u0421\u0421}}, ''Soobshchyeniye TASS'').\n\nTASS included affiliated news agencies in all 14 Soviet republics in addition to Russia: RATAU ([[Ukrainian SSR]], now [[Ukrinform]]), [[Belarusian Telegraph Agency|BelTA]] ([[Byelorussian SSR]]), ETA ([[Estonian SSR]]), Latinform ([[Latvian SSR]], now [[LETA]]), [[ELTA]] ([[Lithuanian SSR]]), ATEM ([[Moldavian SSR]], now [[Moldpres]]), [[Armenpress]] ([[Armenian SSR]]), Gruzinform ([[Georgian SSR]]), Azerinform ([[Azerbaijan SSR]], now [[AZERTAC]]), UzTAG ([[Uzbek SSR]], now [[Uzbekistan National News Agency|UzA]]), KazTAG ([[Kazakh SSR]], now [[Kazinform]]), KyrTAG ([[Kyrgyz SSR]], now [[Kabar (news agency)|Kabar]]), Turkmeninform ([[Turkmen SSR]], now [[TDH (news agency)|TDH]]) and TajikTA ([[Tajik SSR]], now [[Khovar]]). Over the history other affiliates existed, e.g. KarelfinTAG for the [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]].\n\nTASS news and photos were received by 4,000 Soviet newspapers, TV and radio stations and over a thousand foreign media outlets. The news agency ran one of the biggest networks of correspondents in the world \u2013 682 offices in the country and 94 bureaus abroad, with reporters in 110 countries. At its peak it employed nearly 5,000 people including close to 2,000 journalists and photo correspondents.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  In addition to producing reports for general consumption, TASS produced packages of content for non-public use.

In 1986, as a massive underdog, he defeated [[Steve Davis]] 18\u201312 to win the 1986 World Snooker Championship. The [[1987 World Snooker Championship|following year]], he reached the final again, losing 14\u201318 to Davis; as a result coming closer to breaking the [[Crucible curse]] than any other player.\n\nAt the 1987 UK Championship, Joe came agonisingly close to a maximum 147 break, when missing the pink ball with his score on 134. The maximum would have secured him a \u00a350,000 bonus.Joe also won the [[1987 Scottish Masters]] and the [[1989 Norwich Union Grand Prix]] before retiring from professional play due to injury in 2004. He has also won two seniors titles, winning the [[1997 Seniors Pot Black]] and the [[2019 Seniors Masters]], and provides regular snooker match commentary on [[Eurosport]].\n\n== Amateur career ==\nJohnson was National Under-19 champion in 1971 and three times Yorkshire Champion. He was runner-up to [[Terry Griffiths]] in the English Amateur championship of 1978 and, with Griffiths being a Welshman, Johnson qualified as England's representative in that year's World Amateur in Malta. He gave a very good account of himself and reached the final where he lost to [[Cliff Wilson]]. This prompted Johnson to turn professional in 1979.<ref name=\"global-snooker.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.global-snooker.com/global-snooker-hall-of-fame-snooker-legends-joe-johnson.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031125200/http://www.global-snooker.com/global-snooker-hall-of-fame-snooker-legends-joe-johnson.asp |archive-date=31 October 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n===Early years===\nIn Johnson's first season as a professional he was unranked. Johnson turned professional alongside other notable players of the future, including [[Tony Meo]], [[Mike Hallett]] and [[Cliff Wilson]]. Johnson's first match as a professional came in the non-ranking 1979 Canadian Open. In Round 1 he beat Steve Baruda 5\u20134. The match included a break of 100, Johnson's first century break as a professional. In the second round Johnson beat [[John Bear (snooker player)|John Bear]] 9\u20137 and then lost in the last 16 to [[Kirk Stevens]] by 9 frames to 2. In the next event, the 1979 [[UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]], Johnson lost his opening match, a last 24 encounter with [[Bill Werbeniuk]] by 9 frames to 3. At the 1980 British Gold Cup, Johnson had [[Willie Thorne]] and [[Ray Edmonds]] in his qualifying group. Johnson lost 3\u20130 to Thorne but beat Edmonds 2\u20131, which was not enough for Johnson to qualify out of his group. At the 1980 World Championship Johnson beat Roy Andrewartha 9\u20135 in Round 1 and progressed to the last 48 where Johnson lost 9\u20136 to Pat Houlihan. Johson won just \u00a3100 in his first professional season, received no ranking points and he finished the season unranked.\n\nJohnson was unranked throughout the [[1980\u201381 snooker season|1980\u201381 season]]. His season started with the 1980 UK Championship in which he beat [[John Dunning (snooker player)|John Dunning]] 9\u20136 in the last 32 before losing 9\u20134 in the last 24 to [[Patsy Fagan]]. At the 1981 [[British Open (snooker)|Yamaha Organs Trophy]] Johnson lost all three of his qualifying round matches; he was beaten 3\u20130 by both [[Mike Hallett]] and [[Tony Knowles (snooker player)|Tony Knowles]] and 2\u20131 by [[Willie Thorne]]. The following event however, the 1981 English Professional Championship saw Johnson avenge his loss to Knowles with a comprehensive 9\u20132 win in the first round. Johnson received a walkover in the last 16 against [[John Pulman]] and this took Johnson into the quarter finals, where he lost 9\u20135 to [[Ray Edmonds]]. At the [[1981 World Snooker Championship|1981 World Championship]] Johnson lost his opening match, a last 48 encounter with [[Tony Meo]]. Johnson matched Meo virtually frame for frame throughout the match until losing the final frame and the match 9\u20138.

In Round 4 Johnson beat [[Jim Wych]] 5\u20133 and then lost in Round 5, the last 32, 5\u20133 to [[Graham Miles]]. In the 1981 UK Championship Johnson began the event with a comprehensive 9\u20131 win over Tommy Murphy in Round 2. This was followed by a Round 3 9\u20133 defeat of [[Mike Watterson]] and in Round 4 a 9\u20134 win over Cliff Wilson. In round 5 Johnson beat the former three-time world champion [[John Spencer (snooker player)|John Spencer]] 9\u20135 and this earned Johnson a last 16 appearance at the UK Championship against another former world champion, [[Ray Reardon]], to whom Johnson narrowly lost 9\u20137. At the 1982 International Masters, Johnson began the event in the pre-qualifying group stage with a 2\u20131 loss against Dave Martin, and 2\u20130 wins over both [[Geoff Foulds]] and [[Cliff Wilson]]. The results were enough to take Johnson into the next qualifying round where he lost 2\u20131 to [[John Virgo]], but beat [[John Spencer (snooker player)|John Spencer]] 2\u20131 and Dave Martin (again) 2\u20130. In the third and final group stage Johnson lost 2\u20130 to [[Dennis Taylor]] and Reardon but beat Virgo 2\u20131, but the win was not enough to take Johnson out of the group stage. In Round 1 of the [[1982 World Snooker Championship|1982 World Championship]] Johnson beat Vic Harris 9\u20134 and reached the last 48, where he lost 9\u20138.

Johnson followed this up with a 5\u20134 last 16 win over Mark Wildman and in the quarter final Johnson was beaten 5\u20131 by [[John Virgo]], a result which earned Johnson his first ranking points.

In qualifying for the 1983 World Championship Johnson scored a 10\u20130 whitewash over Paul Watchorn in Round 1 but lost 9\u20138 to [[Cliff Wilson]] and thus failed to reach the main event at the [[Crucible Theatre]].

[[Bradford]], [[West Yorkshire]]) is an English former professional [[snooker]] player and commentator, best known as the surprise winner of the [[World Snooker Championship 1986|1986]] [[World Snooker Championship|World Championship]].\n\nA former [[English Amateur Championship]] and [[IBSF World Snooker Championship|World Amateur Championship]] finalist, Johnson turned professional in 1979, and after several years as an unranked player, reached the final of the [[1983 Professional Players Tournament]], where he narrowly lost 8\u20139 to [[Tony Knowles (snooker player)|Tony Knowles]]. In 1986, as a massive underdog, he defeated [[Steve Davis]] 18\u201312 to win the 1986 World Snooker Championship. The [[1987 World Snooker Championship|following year]], he reached the final again, losing 14\u201318 to Davis; as a result coming closer to breaking the [[Crucible curse]] than any other player.\n\nAt the 1987 UK Championship, Joe came agonisingly close to a maximum 147 break, when missing the pink ball with his score on 134. The maximum would have secured him a \u00a350,000 bonus.Joe also won the [[1987 Scottish Masters]] and the [[1989 Norwich Union Grand Prix]] before retiring from professional play due to injury in 2004. He has also won two seniors titles, winning the [[1997 Seniors Pot Black]] and the [[2019 Seniors Masters]], and provides regular snooker match commentary on [[Eurosport]].\n\n== Amateur career ==\nJohnson was National Under-19 champion in 1971 and three times Yorkshire Champion. He was runner-up to [[Terry Griffiths]] in the English Amateur championship of 1978 and, with Griffiths being a Welshman, Johnson qualified as England's representative in that year's World Amateur in Malta. He gave a very good account of himself and reached the final where he lost to [[Cliff Wilson]]. This prompted Johnson to turn professional in 1979.<ref name=\"global-snooker.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.global-snooker.com/global-snooker-hall-of-fame-snooker-legends-joe-johnson.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031125200/http://www.global-snooker.com/global-snooker-hall-of-fame-snooker-legends-joe-johnson.asp |archive-date=31 October 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n===Early years===\nIn Johnson's first season as a professional he was unranked. Johnson turned professional alongside other notable players of the future, including [[Tony Meo]], [[Mike Hallett]] and [[Cliff Wilson]]. Johnson's first match as a professional came in the non-ranking 1979 Canadian Open. In Round 1 he beat Steve Baruda 5\u20134. The match included a break of 100, Johnson's first century break as a professional. In the second round Johnson beat [[John Bear (snooker player)|John Bear]] 9\u20137 and then lost in the last 16 to [[Kirk Stevens]] by 9 frames to 2. In the next event, the 1979 [[UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]], Johnson lost his opening match, a last 24 encounter with [[Bill Werbeniuk]] by 9 frames to 3. At the 1980 British Gold Cup, Johnson had [[Willie Thorne]] and [[Ray Edmonds]] in his qualifying group. Johnson lost 3\u20130 to Thorne but beat Edmonds 2\u20131, which was not enough for Johnson to qualify out of his group. At the 1980 World Championship Johnson beat Roy Andrewartha 9\u20135 in Round 1 and progressed to the last 48 where Johnson lost 9\u20136 to Pat Houlihan. Johson won just \u00a3100 in his first professional season, received no ranking points and he finished the season unranked.\n\nJohnson was unranked throughout the [[1980\u201381 snooker season|1980\u201381 season]]. His season started with the 1980 UK Championship in which he beat [[John Dunning (snooker player)|John Dunning]] 9\u20136 in the last 32 before losing 9\u20134 in the last 24 to [[Patsy Fagan]]. At the 1981 [[British Open (snooker)|Yamaha Organs Trophy]] Johnson lost all three of his qualifying round matches; he was beaten 3\u20130 by both [[Mike Hallett]] and [[Tony Knowles (snooker player)|Tony Knowles]] and 2\u20131 by [[Willie Thorne]]. The following event however, the 1981 English Professional Championship saw Johnson avenge his loss to Knowles with a comprehensive 9\u20132 win in the first round. Johnson received a walkover in the last 16 against [[John Pulman]] and this took Johnson into the quarter finals, where he lost 9\u20135 to [[Ray Edmonds]]. At the [[1981 World Snooker Championship|1981 World Championship]] Johnson lost his opening match, a last 48 encounter with [[Tony Meo]]. Johnson matched Meo virtually frame for frame throughout the match until losing the final frame and the match 9\u20138. Johnson received no ranking points during the season, his prize money for the season was \u00a3850, 28th on the money list and he finished the season still unranked.\n\nJohnson started the [[1981\u201382 snooker season|season]] unranked. His first event was the 1981 [[International Open (snooker)|International Open]] in which he beat [[Jim Donnelly (snooker player)|Jim Donnelly]] 5\u20134 in Round 1, [[Murdo MacLeod (snooker player)|Murdo MacLeod]] 5\u20131 in Round 2 and received a walkover against John Pulman in Round 3. In Round 4 Johnson beat [[Jim Wych]] 5\u20133 and then lost in Round 5, the last 32, 5\u20133 to [[Graham Miles]]. In the 1981 UK Championship Johnson began the event with a comprehensive 9\u20131 win over Tommy Murphy in Round 2. This was followed by a Round 3 9\u20133 defeat of [[Mike Watterson]] and in Round 4 a 9\u20134 win over Cliff Wilson. In round 5 Johnson beat the former three-time world champion [[John Spencer (snooker player)|John Spencer]] 9\u20135 and this earned Johnson a last 16 appearance at the UK Championship against another former world champion, [[Ray Reardon]], to whom Johnson narrowly lost 9\u20137. At the 1982 International Masters, Johnson began the event in the pre-qualifying group stage with a 2\u20131 loss against Dave Martin, and 2\u20130 wins over both [[Geoff Foulds]] and [[Cliff Wilson]]. The results were enough to take Johnson into the next qualifying round where he lost 2\u20131 to [[John Virgo]], but beat [[John Spencer (snooker player)|John Spencer]] 2\u20131 and Dave Martin (again) 2\u20130. In the third and final group stage Johnson lost 2\u20130 to [[Dennis Taylor]] and Reardon but beat Virgo 2\u20131, but the win was not enough to take Johnson out of the group stage. In Round 1 of the [[1982 World Snooker Championship|1982 World Championship]] Johnson beat Vic Harris 9\u20134 and reached the last 48, where he lost 9\u20138. After a 2\u20130 Round 1 defeat by Jackie Rea in the 1982 Bass and Golden Leisure Classic Johnson ended the season with no ranking points, \u00a32,950 prize money \u2013 25th in the money list, but was again unranked.\n\n===1982\u201385===\nJohnson started the season unranked and in his first match he received a walkover against John Phillips in Round 1 of the 1982 International Open. Johnson lost his last 48 match against Cliff Wilson 5\u20134. In the last 32 of the 1982 Professional Players Tournament Johnson began with a solid 5\u20131 last 64 win against [[Graham Miles]] and a last 32 5\u20131 win against [[Kirk Stevens]]. Johnson followed this up with a 5\u20134 last 16 win over Mark Wildman and in the quarter final Johnson was beaten 5\u20131 by [[John Virgo]], a result which earned Johnson his first ranking points. Johnson started the 1982 UK championship with a narrow 9\u20138 victory over Vic Harris in the last 48 before being comprehensively beaten 9\u20131 by [[Terry Griffiths]] in the last 32. At the 1983 International Masters, Johnson again started in pre-qualifying and he scored 2\u20130 victories over Murdo Macleod and Mario Morra, but lost his following two matches 2\u20130 to [[Willie Thorne]] and [[Tony Meo]]. In qualifying for the 1983 World Championship Johnson scored a 10\u20130 whitewash over Paul Watchorn in Round 1 but lost 9\u20138 to [[Cliff Wilson]] and thus failed to reach the main event at the [[Crucible Theatre]]. Johnson won \u00a34,650 in prize money over the season and received 2 ranking points.\n\nJohnson's wins in the previous season had provided him with his first ranking points and they were enough for him to be ranked 23rd in the world.<ref name=\"cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/HistoricRank1.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608214119/http://www.cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/HistoricRank1.html#75 |archive-date=8 June 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> In the last 48 of the 1983 International Open Johnson beat Dennis Hughes 5\u20131 and then lost 5\u20132 to [[Eddie Charlton]] in the last 32.

It was followed by some of the best-known poems in the English language, including \"[[The Waste Land]]\" (1922), \"[[The Hollow Men]]\" (1925), \"[[Ash Wednesday (poem)|Ash Wednesday]]\" (1930), and ''[[Four Quartets]]'' (1943).<ref name=EB>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/184705/T-S-Eliot \"Thomas Stearns Eliot\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''.

Eliot's paternal grandfather, [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], had moved to [[St. Louis]], Missouri,<ref name=EB/><ref>Bush, Ronald, ''T. S. Eliot: The Modernist in History'' (New York, 1991), p. 72.</ref> to establish a Unitarian Christian church there. His father, [[Henry Ware Eliot]] (1843\u20131919), was a successful businessman, president and treasurer of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company in St Louis. His mother, [[Charlotte Champe Stearns]] (1843\u20131929), wrote poetry and was a social worker, a new profession in the early 20th century. Eliot was the last of six surviving children. Known to family and friends as Tom, he was the namesake of his maternal grandfather, Thomas Stearns.\n\nEliot's childhood infatuation with literature can be ascribed to several factors. First, he had to overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double [[inguinal hernia]], he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socialising with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books, favouring tales of savage life, the Wild West, or [[Mark Twain]]'s thrill-seeking [[Tom Sawyer]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S. Eliot: A Short Biography|year=2009|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London|page=9}}</ref> In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot \"would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Sencourt|first=Robert|title=T.S. Eliot, A Memoir|year=1971|publisher=Garnstone Limited|location=London|page=18}}</ref> Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: \"It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I feel that there is something in having passed one's childhood beside the [[Mississippi River|big river]], which is incommunicable to those people who have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London.\"<ref>Letter to Marquis Childs quoted in ''St. Louis Post Dispatch'' (15 October 1930) and in the address \"American Literature and the American Language\" delivered at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] (9 June 1953), published in Washington University Studies, ''New Series: Literature and Language'', no. 23 (St. Louis: Washington University Press, 1953), p. 6.</ref>\n\nFrom 1898 to 1905, Eliot attended [[Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School|Smith Academy]], the boys college preparatory division of [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], where his studies included Latin, Ancient Greek, French, and German. He began to write poetry when he was fourteen under the influence of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]'s translation of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]].''

He first visited [[Marburg]], Germany, where he planned to take a summer programme, but when the [[First World War]] broke out he went to Oxford instead. At the time so many American students attended Merton that the [[Junior Common Room]] proposed a motion \"that this society abhors the [[Americanization]] of Oxford\". It was defeated by two votes after Eliot reminded the students how much they owed American culture.<ref name=SeymourJones1>Seymour-Jones, Carole.

Oxford is very pretty, but I don't like to be dead.\"<ref name=SeymourJones1/> Escaping Oxford, Eliot spent much of his time in London. This city had a monumental and life-altering effect on Eliot for several reasons, the most significant of which was his introduction to the influential American literary figure [[Ezra Pound]]. A connection through Aiken resulted in an arranged meeting and on 22 September 1914, Eliot paid a visit to Pound's flat. Pound instantly deemed Eliot \"worth watching\" and was crucial to Eliot's beginning career as a poet, as he is credited with promoting Eliot through social events and literary gatherings. Thus, according to biographer John Worthen, during his time in England Eliot \"was seeing as little of Oxford as possible\". He was instead spending long periods of time in London, in the company of Ezra Pound and \"some of the modern artists whom the war has so far spared... It was Pound who helped most, introducing him everywhere.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S.

The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Vivienne's brother, Maurice, had her committed to a mental hospital, against her will, where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947. \n\nTheir relationship became the subject of a 1984 play ''[[Tom & Viv (play)|Tom & Viv]]'', which in 1994 was adapted as a film of [[Tom & Viv|the same name]].\n\nIn a private paper written in his sixties, Eliot confessed: \"I came to persuade myself that I was in love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the influence of [Ezra] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness.

He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, \"My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in their kind, so that each should be an event.\"<ref>Eliot, T. S. \"Letter to J. H. Woods, April 21, 1919.\" ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', vol. I. Valerie Eliot (ed.), New York: Harcourt Brace, 1988, p. 285.</ref>\n\nTypically, Eliot first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or pamphlets and then collected them in books. His first collection was ''Prufrock and Other Observations'' (1917). In 1920, he published more poems in ''Ara Vos Prec'' (London) and ''Poems: 1920'' (New York). These had the same poems (in a different order) except that \"Ode\" in the British edition was replaced with \"Hysteria\" in the American edition. In 1925, he collected ''The Waste Land'' and the poems in ''Prufrock'' and ''Poems'' into one volume and added ''The Hollow Men'' to form ''Poems: 1909\u20131925''. From then on, he updated this work as ''Collected Poems''. Exceptions are ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' (1939), a collection of light verse; ''Poems Written in Early Youth'', posthumously published in 1967 and consisting mainly of poems published between 1907 and 1910 in ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', and ''Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909\u20131917'', material Eliot never intended to have published, which appeared posthumously in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.com/~raparker/exploring/tseliot/works/poems/eliot-harvard-poems.html |title=T.

That I'm sure of. ... It wouldn't be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America.

Before the poem's publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On 15 November 1922, he wrote to [[Richard Aldington]], saying, \"As for ''The Waste Land'', that is a thing of the past so far as I am concerned and I am now feeling toward a new form and style.\"<ref>''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;596.</ref> The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Dismissing this view, Eliot commented in 1931, \"When I wrote a poem called ''The Waste Land'', some of the more approving critics said that I had expressed \u2018the disillusion of a generation\u2019, which is nonsense. I may have expressed for them their own illusion of being disillusioned, but that did not form part of my intention\"<ref>''The Poems of T.S. Eliot, Volume 1: Collected & Uncollected Poems''. Edited by Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue, Faber & Faber, 2015, p. 576</ref>\n\nThe poem is known for its obscure nature\u2014its slippage between satire and prophecy; its abrupt changes of speaker, location, and time. This structural complexity is one of the reasons why the poem has become a touchstone of [[Modernist poetry in English|modern literature]], a poetic counterpart to a novel published in the same year, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.<ref>MacCabe, Colin. ''T. S. Eliot''. Tavistock: Northcote House, 2006.</ref>\n\nAmong its best-known phrases are \"April is the cruellest month\", \"I will show you fear in a handful of dust\" and ''\"[[Shanti Mantra|Shantih shantih shantih]]\"''. The Sanskrit ''[[mantra]]'' ends the poem.\n\n===\"The Hollow Men\"===\n{{Main|The Hollow Men|The Hollow Men in popular culture}}\n\"The Hollow Men\" appeared in 1925. For the critic [[Edmund Wilson]], it marked \"The nadir of the phase of despair and desolation given such effective expression in \"The Waste Land\".\"<ref>[[Edmund Wilson|Wilson, Edmund]]. \"Review of Ash Wednesday\", ''New Republic'', 20 August 1930.</ref> It is Eliot's major poem of the late 1920s. Similar to Eliot's other works, its themes are overlapping and fragmentary. Post-war Europe under the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (which Eliot despised), the difficulty of hope and religious conversion, Eliot's failed marriage.<ref>See, for instance, the biographically oriented work of one of Eliot's editors and major critics, Ronald Schuchard.</ref>\n\n[[Allen Tate]] perceived a shift in Eliot's method, writing, \"The mythologies disappear altogether in 'The Hollow Men'.\" This is a striking claim for a poem as indebted to [[Dante]] as anything else in Eliot's early work, to say little of the modern English mythology\u2014the \"Old [[Guy Fawkes]]\" of the [[Gunpowder Plot]]\u2014or the colonial and [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] mythos of [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[James George Frazer]], which, at least for reasons of textual history, echo in ''The Waste Land''.<ref>Grant, Michael (ed.).

Published in 1930, it deals with the struggle that ensues when a person who has lacked faith acquires it. Sometimes referred to as Eliot's \"conversion poem\", it is richly but ambiguously allusive, and deals with the aspiration to move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human [[salvation]]. Eliot's style of writing in \"Ash-Wednesday\" showed a marked shift from the poetry he had written prior to his 1927 conversion, and his post-conversion style continued in a similar vein. His style became less ironic, and the poems were no longer populated by multiple characters in dialogue. Eliot's subject matter also became more focused on his spiritual concerns and his Christian faith.<ref>Raine, Craig. ''T. S. Eliot'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006)</ref>\n\nMany critics were particularly enthusiastic about \"Ash-Wednesday\". [[Edwin Muir]] maintained that it is one of the most moving poems Eliot wrote, and perhaps the \"most perfect\", though it was not well received by everyone. The poem's groundwork of orthodox Christianity discomfited many of the more secular ''[[Intellectual|literati]]''.<ref name=EB/><ref name=Untermeyer>[[Louis Untermeyer|Untermeyer, Louis]].

This first edition had an illustration of the author on the cover. In 1954, the composer [[Alan Rawsthorne]] set six of the poems for speaker and orchestra in a work titled ''Practical Cats''. After Eliot's death, the book was adapted as the basis of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], first produced in London's West End in 1981 and opening on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/an-introduction-to-old-possums-book-of-practical-cats|title=An introduction to Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats|website=The British Library|access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Four Quartets''===\n{{Main|Four Quartets}}\nEliot regarded ''Four Quartets'' as his masterpiece, and it is the work that led to his being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref name=EB/> It consists of four long poems, each first published separately: \"[[Burnt Norton]]\" (1936), \"[[East Coker (poem)|East Coker]]\" (1940), \"[[The Dry Salvages]]\" (1941) and \"[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]\" (1942). Each has five sections. Although they resist easy characterisation, each poem includes meditations on the nature of time in some important respect\u2014[[theological]], historical, physical\u2014and its relation to the human condition. Each poem is associated with one of the four [[classical elements]], respectively: air, earth, water, and fire.\n\n\"Burnt Norton\" is a meditative poem that begins with the narrator trying to focus on the present moment while walking through a garden, focusing on images and sounds such as the bird, the roses, clouds and an empty pool. The meditation leads the narrator to reach \"the still point\" in which there is no attempt to get anywhere or to experience place and/or time, instead experiencing \"a grace of sense\". In the final section, the narrator contemplates the arts (\"words\" and \"music\") as they relate to time. The narrator focuses particularly on the poet's art of manipulating \"Words [which] strain, / Crack and sometimes break, under the burden [of time], under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, [and] will not stay in place, / Will not stay still.\" By comparison, the narrator concludes that \"Love is itself unmoving, / Only the cause and end of movement, / Timeless, and undesiring.\"\n\n\"East Coker\" continues the examination of time and meaning, focusing in a famous passage on the nature of language and poetry. Out of darkness, Eliot offers a solution: \"I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope.\"\n\n\"The Dry Salvages\" treats the element of water, via images of river and sea. It strives to contain opposites: \"The past and future / Are conquered, and reconciled.\"\n\n\"Little Gidding\" (the element of fire) is the most anthologised of the ''Quartets''. Eliot's experiences as an air raid warden in [[the Blitz]] power the poem, and he imagines meeting [[Dante]] during the German bombing. The beginning of the ''Quartets'' (\"Houses / Are removed, destroyed\") had become a violent everyday experience; this creates an animation, where for the first time he talks of love as the driving force behind all experience. From this background, the ''Quartets'' end with an affirmation of [[Julian of Norwich]]: \"All shall be well and / All manner of thing<!-- NOT \"things\" - Collected Poems, p. 209 --> shall be well.\"\n\nThe ''Four Quartets'' cannot be understood without reference to Christian thought, traditions, and history. Eliot draws upon the theology, art, symbolism and language of such figures as Dante, and mystics [[St. John of the Cross]] and [[Julian of Norwich]]. The \"deeper communion\" sought in \"East Coker\", the \"hints and whispers of children, the sickness that must grow worse to find healing\", and the exploration which inevitably leads us home all point to the pilgrim's path along the road of [[sanctification]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Plays==\n{{Main|Sweeney Agonistes|Murder in the Cathedral|The Rock (play)|The Family Reunion|The Cocktail Party|The Confidential Clerk|The Elder Statesman}}\nWith the important exception of ''Four Quartets'', Eliot directed much of his creative energies after ''Ash Wednesday'' to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of [[Elizabethan]] and [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] verse drama; witness his allusions to [[John Webster|Webster]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''The Waste Land''. In a 1933 lecture he said \"Every poet would like, I fancy, to be able to think that he had some direct social utility . . . . He would like to be something of a popular entertainer and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it.\"<ref name=\"upuc\">Eliot, T. S. ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism'', Harvard University Press, 1933 (penultimate paragraph).</ref>\n\nAfter ''The Waste Land'' (1922), he wrote that he was \"now feeling toward a new form and style\". One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse, using some of the rhythms of early [[jazz]]. The play featured \"Sweeney\", a character who had appeared in a number of his poems. Although Eliot did not finish the play, he did publish two scenes from the piece. These scenes, titled ''Fragment of a Prologue'' (1926) and ''Fragment of an Agon'' (1927), were published together in 1932 as ''[[Sweeney Agonistes]]''. Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play, it is sometimes performed as one.<ref name=Gallup/>\n\nA pageant play by Eliot called ''The Rock'' was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the [[Diocese of London]]. Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses.<ref name=Gallup/> [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], the [[Bishop of Chichester]], had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer [[E. Martin Browne]] for the production of ''The Rock'', and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the [[Canterbury Festival]] in 1935. This one, ''Murder in the Cathedral'', concerning the death of the martyr, [[Thomas Becket]], was more under Eliot's control. Eliot biographer [[Peter Ackroyd]] comments that \"for [Eliot], ''Murder in the Cathedral'' and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/> After this, he worked on more \"commercial\" plays for more general audiences: ''The Family Reunion'' (1939), ''The Cocktail Party'' (1949), ''The Confidential Clerk'', (1953) and ''The Elder Statesman'' (1958) (the latter three were produced by [[Henry Sherek]] and directed by [[E. Martin Browne]]<ref name=\"Darlington\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36063|title=Henry Sherek|last=Darlington|first=W.

The Broadway production in New York of ''The Cocktail Party'' received the 1950 [[Tony Award]] for Best Play. Eliot wrote ''The Cocktail Party'' while he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].<ref>[https://www.ias.edu/files/pdfs/publications/letter-2007-spring.pdf T. S. Eliot at the Institute for Advanced Study], ''The Institute Letter'', Spring 2007, p. 6.</ref><ref>[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/teliot01 Eliot, Thomas Stearns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119203650/https://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/teliot01 |date=19 January 2015 }} IAS profile.</ref>\n\nRegarding his method of playwriting, Eliot explained, \"If I set out to write a play, I start by an act of choice. I settle upon a particular emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/>\n\n==Literary criticism==\nEliot also made significant contributions to the field of [[literary criticism]], strongly influencing the school of [[New Criticism]]. He was somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work and once said his criticism was merely a \"by-product\" of his \"private poetry-workshop\" But the critic [[William Empson]] once said, \"I do not know for certain how much of my own mind [Eliot] invented, let alone how much of it is a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him. He is a very penetrating influence, perhaps not unlike the east wind.\"<ref>quoted in Roger Kimball, \"A Craving for Reality\", ''The New Criterion'' Vol. 18, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn his critical essay \"[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]\", Eliot argues that art must be understood not in a vacuum, but in the context of previous pieces of art. \"In a peculiar sense [an artist or poet] ... must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past.\"<ref name=bartleby1>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw4.html |title=Tradition and the Individual Talent|author= Eliot, T. S. |work=The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1930 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This essay was an important influence over the New Criticism by introducing the idea that the value of a work of art must be viewed in the context of the artist's previous works, a \"simultaneous order\" of works (i.e., \"tradition\"). Eliot himself employed this concept on many of his works, especially on his long-poem ''The Waste Land''.<ref>[http://www.leidykla.vu.lt/fileadmin/Literatura/51_3/98-108.pdf Dirk Weidmann: ''And I Tiresias have foresuffered all...'']. In: ''LITERATURA'' 51 (3), 2009, pp. 98\u2013108.</ref>\n\nAlso important to New Criticism was the idea\u2014as articulated in Eliot's essay \"[[Hamlet and His Problems]]\"\u2014of an \"[[objective correlative]]\", which posits a connection among the words of the text and events, states of mind, and experiences.<ref name=Hamlet>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw9.html |title=Hamlet and His Problems|author= Eliot, T. S. |work= The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1921 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This notion concedes that a poem means what it says, but suggests that there can be a non-subjective judgment based on different readers' different\u2014but perhaps corollary\u2014interpretations of a work.\n\nMore generally, New Critics took a cue from Eliot in regard to his \"'classical' ideals and his religious thought; his attention to the poetry and drama of the early seventeenth century; his deprecation of the Romantics, especially [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]; his proposition that good poems constitute 'not a turning loose of emotion but an escape from emotion'; and his insistence that 'poets... at present must be difficult'.\"<ref>Burt, Steven and Lewin, Jennifer. \"Poetry and the New Criticism\". ''A Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry'', Neil Roberts, ed. Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers, 2001. p. 154</ref>\n\nEliot's essays were a major factor in the revival of interest in the [[metaphysical poets]]. Eliot particularly praised the metaphysical poets' ability to show experience as both psychological and sensual, while at the same time infusing this portrayal with\u2014in Eliot's view\u2014wit and uniqueness. Eliot's essay \"The Metaphysical Poets\", along with giving new significance and attention to metaphysical poetry, introduced his now well-known definition of \"unified sensibility\", which is considered by some to mean the same thing as the term \"metaphysical\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_modern_literature/v027/27.1baker.html |title=Project MUSE |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |accessdate=3 August 2009|doi=10.1353/jml.2004.0051 }}</ref><ref>A.

S. |title=The Waste Land|publisher=Bartleby.com |year= 1922|accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> also can be better understood in light of his work as a critic. He had argued that a poet must write \"programmatic criticism\", that is, a poet should write to advance his own interests rather than to advance \"historical scholarship\". Viewed from Eliot's critical lens, ''The Waste Land'' likely shows his personal despair about [[World War I]] rather than an objective historical understanding of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-2088/TS-Eliot |title=T.

Alfred Prufrock\", \"Portrait of a Lady\", \"La Figlia Che Piange\", \"Preludes\", and \"Rhapsody on a Windy Night\" had \"[an] effect [that] was both unique and compelling, and their assurance staggered [Eliot's] contemporaries who were privileged to read them in manuscript. [Conrad] Aiken, for example, marveled at 'how sharp and complete and [[sui generis]] the whole thing was, from the outset. The wholeness is there, from the very beginning.'\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\" />\n\nThe initial critical response to Eliot's ''The Waste Land'' was mixed. Bush notes that the piece was at first correctly perceived as a work of jazz-like syncopation\u2014and, like 1920s [[jazz]], essentially iconoclastic.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/> Some critics, like [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Conrad Aiken]], and [[Gilbert Seldes]] thought it was the best poetry being written in the English language while others thought it was esoteric and wilfully difficult. Edmund Wilson, being one of the critics who praised Eliot, called him \"one of our only authentic poets\".<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\">Wilson, Edmund, \"The Poetry of Drouth\". ''The Dial'' 73. December 1922. 611\u201316.</ref> Wilson also pointed out some of Eliot's weaknesses as a poet. In regard to ''The Waste Land'', Wilson admits its flaws (\"its lack of structural unity\"), but concluded, \"I doubt whether there is a single other poem of equal length by a contemporary American which displays so high and so varied a mastery of English verse.\"<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\"/>\n\nCharles Powell was negative in his criticism of Eliot, calling his poems incomprehensible.<ref>Powell, Charles, \"So Much Waste Paper\". ''Manchester Guardian'', 31 October 1923.</ref> And the writers of ''Time'' magazine were similarly baffled by a challenging poem like ''The Waste Land''.<ref>''Time'', 3 March 1923, 12.</ref> [[John Crowe Ransom]] wrote negative criticisms of Eliot's work but also had positive things to say. For instance, though Ransom negatively criticised ''The Waste Land'' for its \"extreme disconnection\", Ransom was not completely condemnatory of Eliot's work and admitted that Eliot was a talented poet.<ref>Ransom, John Crowe. \"Waste Lands\". ''New York Evening Post Literary Review'', 14 July 1923, pp. 825\u201326.</ref>\n\nAddressing some of the common criticisms directed against ''The Waste Land'' at the time, Gilbert Seldes stated, \"It seems at first sight remarkably disconnected and confused... [however] a closer view of the poem does more than illuminate the difficulties; it reveals the hidden form of the work, [and] indicates how each thing falls into place.\"<ref>Seldes, Gilbert. \"T. S. Eliot\". ''Nation'', 6 December 1922. 614\u2013616.</ref>\n\nEliot's reputation as a poet, as well as his influence in the academy, peaked following the publication of ''The Four Quartets''. In an essay on Eliot published in 1989, the writer [[Cynthia Ozick]] refers to this peak of influence (from the 1940s through the early 1960s) as \"the Age of Eliot\" when Eliot \"seemed pure zenith, a colossus, nothing less than a permanent luminary, fixed in the firmament like the sun and the moon\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Cynthia |last=Ozick| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1989/11/20/t-s-eliot-at-101|title=T.S. ELIOT AT 101|work=The New Yorker|date=20 November 1989|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> But during this post-war period, others, like Ronald Bush, observed that this time also marked the beginning of the decline in Eliot's literary influence: <blockquote>As Eliot's conservative religious and political convictions began to seem less congenial in the postwar world, other readers reacted with suspicion to his assertions of authority, obvious in ''Four Quartets'' and implicit in the earlier poetry. The result, fueled by intermittent rediscovery of Eliot's occasional anti-Semitic rhetoric, has been a progressive downward revision of his once towering reputation.<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/></blockquote> Bush also notes that Eliot's reputation \"slipped\" significantly further after his death. He writes, \"Sometimes regarded as too academic ([[William Carlos Williams]]'s view), Eliot was also frequently criticized for a deadening [[neoclassicism]] (as he himself\u2014perhaps just as unfairly\u2014had criticized [[John Milton|Milton]]). However, the multifarious tributes from practicing poets of many schools published during his centenary in 1988 was a strong indication of the intimidating continued presence of his poetic voice.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/>\n\nAlthough Eliot's poetry is not as influential as it once was, notable literary scholars, like [[Harold Bloom]]<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''The Western Canon: Books and Schools of the Ages''. NY: Riverhead, 1995.</ref> and [[Stephen Greenblatt]],<ref name=Norton>Stephen Greenblatt, et al. (eds), ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume 2''. \"T.S. Eliot\". New York, NY: W.W. Norton & Co.: NY, NY, 2000.</ref> still acknowledge that Eliot's poetry is central to the literary English canon. For instance, the editors of ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'' write, \"There is no disagreement on [Eliot's] importance as one of the great renovators of the English poetry dialect, whose influence on a whole generation of poets, critics, and intellectuals generally was enormous. [However] his range as a poet [was] limited, and his interest in the great middle ground of human experience (as distinct from the extremes of saint and sinner) [was] deficient.\" Despite this criticism, these scholars also acknowledge \"[Eliot's] poetic cunning, his fine craftsmanship, his original accent, his historical and representative importance as ''the'' poet of the modern [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]-[[Metaphysical poets|Metaphysical]] tradition\".<ref name=Norton />\n\n===Anti-Semitism===\nThe depiction of Jews in some of Eliot's poems has led several critics to accuse him of [[anti-Semitism]]. This case has been presented most forcefully in a study by [[Anthony Julius]]: ''T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form'' (1996).<ref>[[John Gross|Gross, John]].

Nevertheless, he concluded, \"Ultimately, as both Raine and, to do him justice, Julius insist, however much Eliot may have been compromised as a person, as we all are in our several ways, his greatness as a poet remains.\"<ref name = \"Dean\"/> In another review of Raine's 2006 book, the literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] also questioned the validity of Raine's defence of Eliot's character flaws as well as the entire basis for Raine's book, writing, \"Why do critics feel a need to defend the authors they write on, like doting parents deaf to all criticism of their obnoxious children? Eliot's well-earned reputation [as a poet] is established beyond all doubt, and making him out to be as unflawed as the [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]] does him no favours.\"<ref>Eagleton, Terry.

Eliot's paternal grandfather, [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], had moved to [[St. Louis]], Missouri,<ref name=EB/><ref>Bush, Ronald, ''T. S. Eliot: The Modernist in History'' (New York, 1991), p. 72.</ref> to establish a Unitarian Christian church there. His father, [[Henry Ware Eliot]] (1843\u20131919), was a successful businessman, president and treasurer of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company in St Louis. His mother, [[Charlotte Champe Stearns]] (1843\u20131929), wrote poetry and was a social worker, a new profession in the early 20th century. Eliot was the last of six surviving children. Known to family and friends as Tom, he was the namesake of his maternal grandfather, Thomas Stearns.\n\nEliot's childhood infatuation with literature can be ascribed to several factors. First, he had to overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double [[inguinal hernia]], he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socialising with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books, favouring tales of savage life, the Wild West, or [[Mark Twain]]'s thrill-seeking [[Tom Sawyer]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S. Eliot: A Short Biography|year=2009|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London|page=9}}</ref> In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot \"would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Sencourt|first=Robert|title=T.S. Eliot, A Memoir|year=1971|publisher=Garnstone Limited|location=London|page=18}}</ref> Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: \"It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I feel that there is something in having passed one's childhood beside the [[Mississippi River|big river]], which is incommunicable to those people who have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London.\"<ref>Letter to Marquis Childs quoted in ''St. Louis Post Dispatch'' (15 October 1930) and in the address \"American Literature and the American Language\" delivered at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] (9 June 1953), published in Washington University Studies, ''New Series: Literature and Language'', no. 23 (St. Louis: Washington University Press, 1953), p. 6.</ref>\n\nFrom 1898 to 1905, Eliot attended [[Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School|Smith Academy]], the boys college preparatory division of [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], where his studies included Latin, Ancient Greek, French, and German. He began to write poetry when he was fourteen under the influence of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]'s translation of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]].''

He first visited [[Marburg]], Germany, where he planned to take a summer programme, but when the [[First World War]] broke out he went to Oxford instead. At the time so many American students attended Merton that the [[Junior Common Room]] proposed a motion \"that this society abhors the [[Americanization]] of Oxford\". It was defeated by two votes after Eliot reminded the students how much they owed American culture.<ref name=SeymourJones1>Seymour-Jones, Carole.

Oxford is very pretty, but I don't like to be dead.\"<ref name=SeymourJones1/> Escaping Oxford, Eliot spent much of his time in London. This city had a monumental and life-altering effect on Eliot for several reasons, the most significant of which was his introduction to the influential American literary figure [[Ezra Pound]]. A connection through Aiken resulted in an arranged meeting and on 22 September 1914, Eliot paid a visit to Pound's flat. Pound instantly deemed Eliot \"worth watching\" and was crucial to Eliot's beginning career as a poet, as he is credited with promoting Eliot through social events and literary gatherings. Thus, according to biographer John Worthen, during his time in England Eliot \"was seeing as little of Oxford as possible\". He was instead spending long periods of time in London, in the company of Ezra Pound and \"some of the modern artists whom the war has so far spared... It was Pound who helped most, introducing him everywhere.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S.

In 1915 he taught English at [[Birkbeck, University of London]].\n\nBy 1916, he had completed a doctoral dissertation for Harvard on \"Knowledge and Experience in the Philosophy of [[F. H.

The philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] took an interest in Vivienne while the newlyweds stayed in his flat.

Knopf Publishing Group, 2001, p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe marriage was markedly unhappy, in part because of Vivienne's health problems.

Eliot: Volume 1, 1898\u20131922|year=1988|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|page=533}}</ref> This, coupled with apparent mental instability, meant that she was often sent away by Eliot and her doctors for extended periods of time in the hope of improving her health, and as time went on, he became increasingly detached from her. The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Vivienne's brother, Maurice, had her committed to a mental hospital, against her will, where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947. \n\nTheir relationship became the subject of a 1984 play ''[[Tom & Viv (play)|Tom & Viv]]'', which in 1994 was adapted as a film of [[Tom & Viv|the same name]].\n\nIn a private paper written in his sixties, Eliot confessed: \"I came to persuade myself that I was in love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the influence of [Ezra] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness.

When Harvard offered him the [[Charles Eliot Norton professorship]] for the 1932\u20131933 academic year, he accepted and left Vivienne in England. Upon his return, he arranged for a formal separation from her, avoiding all but one meeting with her between his leaving for America in 1932 and her death in 1947.

He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, \"My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in their kind, so that each should be an event.\"<ref>Eliot, T. S. \"Letter to J. H. Woods, April 21, 1919.\" ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', vol. I. Valerie Eliot (ed.), New York: Harcourt Brace, 1988, p. 285.</ref>\n\nTypically, Eliot first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or pamphlets and then collected them in books. His first collection was ''Prufrock and Other Observations'' (1917). In 1920, he published more poems in ''Ara Vos Prec'' (London) and ''Poems: 1920'' (New York). These had the same poems (in a different order) except that \"Ode\" in the British edition was replaced with \"Hysteria\" in the American edition. In 1925, he collected ''The Waste Land'' and the poems in ''Prufrock'' and ''Poems'' into one volume and added ''The Hollow Men'' to form ''Poems: 1909\u20131925''. From then on, he updated this work as ''Collected Poems''. Exceptions are ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' (1939), a collection of light verse; ''Poems Written in Early Youth'', posthumously published in 1967 and consisting mainly of poems published between 1907 and 1910 in ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', and ''Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909\u20131917'', material Eliot never intended to have published, which appeared posthumously in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.com/~raparker/exploring/tseliot/works/poems/eliot-harvard-poems.html |title=T.

That I'm sure of. ... It wouldn't be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America. It's a combination of things.

He himself wrote in his 1940 essay on W.B. Yeats: \"The kind of poetry that I needed to teach me the use of my own voice did not exist in English at all; it was only to be found in French.\" (\"Yeats\", ''On Poetry and Poets'', 1948).\n\n===\"The Love Song of J.

Before the poem's publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On 15 November 1922, he wrote to [[Richard Aldington]], saying, \"As for ''The Waste Land'', that is a thing of the past so far as I am concerned and I am now feeling toward a new form and style.\"<ref>''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;596.</ref> The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Dismissing this view, Eliot commented in 1931, \"When I wrote a poem called ''The Waste Land'', some of the more approving critics said that I had expressed \u2018the disillusion of a generation\u2019, which is nonsense. I may have expressed for them their own illusion of being disillusioned, but that did not form part of my intention\"<ref>''The Poems of T.S. Eliot, Volume 1: Collected & Uncollected Poems''. Edited by Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue, Faber & Faber, 2015, p. 576</ref>\n\nThe poem is known for its obscure nature\u2014its slippage between satire and prophecy; its abrupt changes of speaker, location, and time. This structural complexity is one of the reasons why the poem has become a touchstone of [[Modernist poetry in English|modern literature]], a poetic counterpart to a novel published in the same year, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.<ref>MacCabe, Colin. ''T. S. Eliot''. Tavistock: Northcote House, 2006.</ref>\n\nAmong its best-known phrases are \"April is the cruellest month\", \"I will show you fear in a handful of dust\" and ''\"[[Shanti Mantra|Shantih shantih shantih]]\"''. The Sanskrit ''[[mantra]]'' ends the poem.\n\n===\"The Hollow Men\"===\n{{Main|The Hollow Men|The Hollow Men in popular culture}}\n\"The Hollow Men\" appeared in 1925. For the critic [[Edmund Wilson]], it marked \"The nadir of the phase of despair and desolation given such effective expression in \"The Waste Land\".\"<ref>[[Edmund Wilson|Wilson, Edmund]]. \"Review of Ash Wednesday\", ''New Republic'', 20 August 1930.</ref> It is Eliot's major poem of the late 1920s. Similar to Eliot's other works, its themes are overlapping and fragmentary.

Published in 1930, it deals with the struggle that ensues when a person who has lacked faith acquires it. Sometimes referred to as Eliot's \"conversion poem\", it is richly but ambiguously allusive, and deals with the aspiration to move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human [[salvation]]. Eliot's style of writing in \"Ash-Wednesday\" showed a marked shift from the poetry he had written prior to his 1927 conversion, and his post-conversion style continued in a similar vein. His style became less ironic, and the poems were no longer populated by multiple characters in dialogue. Eliot's subject matter also became more focused on his spiritual concerns and his Christian faith.<ref>Raine, Craig. ''T. S. Eliot'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006)</ref>\n\nMany critics were particularly enthusiastic about \"Ash-Wednesday\". [[Edwin Muir]] maintained that it is one of the most moving poems Eliot wrote, and perhaps the \"most perfect\", though it was not well received by everyone.

This first edition had an illustration of the author on the cover. In 1954, the composer [[Alan Rawsthorne]] set six of the poems for speaker and orchestra in a work titled ''Practical Cats''. After Eliot's death, the book was adapted as the basis of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], first produced in London's West End in 1981 and opening on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/an-introduction-to-old-possums-book-of-practical-cats|title=An introduction to Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats|website=The British Library|access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Four Quartets''===\n{{Main|Four Quartets}}\nEliot regarded ''Four Quartets'' as his masterpiece, and it is the work that led to his being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref name=EB/> It consists of four long poems, each first published separately: \"[[Burnt Norton]]\" (1936), \"[[East Coker (poem)|East Coker]]\" (1940), \"[[The Dry Salvages]]\" (1941) and \"[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]\" (1942). Each has five sections. Although they resist easy characterisation, each poem includes meditations on the nature of time in some important respect\u2014[[theological]], historical, physical\u2014and its relation to the human condition. Each poem is associated with one of the four [[classical elements]], respectively: air, earth, water, and fire.\n\n\"Burnt Norton\" is a meditative poem that begins with the narrator trying to focus on the present moment while walking through a garden, focusing on images and sounds such as the bird, the roses, clouds and an empty pool. The meditation leads the narrator to reach \"the still point\" in which there is no attempt to get anywhere or to experience place and/or time, instead experiencing \"a grace of sense\". In the final section, the narrator contemplates the arts (\"words\" and \"music\") as they relate to time. The narrator focuses particularly on the poet's art of manipulating \"Words [which] strain, / Crack and sometimes break, under the burden [of time], under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, [and] will not stay in place, / Will not stay still.\" By comparison, the narrator concludes that \"Love is itself unmoving, / Only the cause and end of movement, / Timeless, and undesiring.\"\n\n\"East Coker\" continues the examination of time and meaning, focusing in a famous passage on the nature of language and poetry. Out of darkness, Eliot offers a solution: \"I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope.\"\n\n\"The Dry Salvages\" treats the element of water, via images of river and sea. It strives to contain opposites: \"The past and future / Are conquered, and reconciled.\"\n\n\"Little Gidding\" (the element of fire) is the most anthologised of the ''Quartets''. Eliot's experiences as an air raid warden in [[the Blitz]] power the poem, and he imagines meeting [[Dante]] during the German bombing. The beginning of the ''Quartets'' (\"Houses / Are removed, destroyed\") had become a violent everyday experience; this creates an animation, where for the first time he talks of love as the driving force behind all experience. From this background, the ''Quartets'' end with an affirmation of [[Julian of Norwich]]: \"All shall be well and / All manner of thing<!-- NOT \"things\" - Collected Poems, p. 209 --> shall be well.\"\n\nThe ''Four Quartets'' cannot be understood without reference to Christian thought, traditions, and history. Eliot draws upon the theology, art, symbolism and language of such figures as Dante, and mystics [[St. John of the Cross]] and [[Julian of Norwich]]. The \"deeper communion\" sought in \"East Coker\", the \"hints and whispers of children, the sickness that must grow worse to find healing\", and the exploration which inevitably leads us home all point to the pilgrim's path along the road of [[sanctification]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Plays==\n{{Main|Sweeney Agonistes|Murder in the Cathedral|The Rock (play)|The Family Reunion|The Cocktail Party|The Confidential Clerk|The Elder Statesman}}\nWith the important exception of ''Four Quartets'', Eliot directed much of his creative energies after ''Ash Wednesday'' to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of [[Elizabethan]] and [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] verse drama; witness his allusions to [[John Webster|Webster]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''The Waste Land''. In a 1933 lecture he said \"Every poet would like, I fancy, to be able to think that he had some direct social utility . . . . He would like to be something of a popular entertainer and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it.\"<ref name=\"upuc\">Eliot, T. S. ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism'', Harvard University Press, 1933 (penultimate paragraph).</ref>\n\nAfter ''The Waste Land'' (1922), he wrote that he was \"now feeling toward a new form and style\". One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse, using some of the rhythms of early [[jazz]]. The play featured \"Sweeney\", a character who had appeared in a number of his poems. Although Eliot did not finish the play, he did publish two scenes from the piece. These scenes, titled ''Fragment of a Prologue'' (1926) and ''Fragment of an Agon'' (1927), were published together in 1932 as ''[[Sweeney Agonistes]]''. Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play, it is sometimes performed as one.<ref name=Gallup/>\n\nA pageant play by Eliot called ''The Rock'' was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the [[Diocese of London]]. Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses.<ref name=Gallup/> [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], the [[Bishop of Chichester]], had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer [[E. Martin Browne]] for the production of ''The Rock'', and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the [[Canterbury Festival]] in 1935. This one, ''Murder in the Cathedral'', concerning the death of the martyr, [[Thomas Becket]], was more under Eliot's control. Eliot biographer [[Peter Ackroyd]] comments that \"for [Eliot], ''Murder in the Cathedral'' and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/> After this, he worked on more \"commercial\" plays for more general audiences: ''The Family Reunion'' (1939), ''The Cocktail Party'' (1949), ''The Confidential Clerk'', (1953) and ''The Elder Statesman'' (1958) (the latter three were produced by [[Henry Sherek]] and directed by [[E. Martin Browne]]<ref name=\"Darlington\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36063|title=Henry Sherek|last=Darlington|first=W.

The Broadway production in New York of ''The Cocktail Party'' received the 1950 [[Tony Award]] for Best Play. Eliot wrote ''The Cocktail Party'' while he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].<ref>[https://www.ias.edu/files/pdfs/publications/letter-2007-spring.pdf T. S. Eliot at the Institute for Advanced Study], ''The Institute Letter'', Spring 2007, p. 6.</ref><ref>[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/teliot01 Eliot, Thomas Stearns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119203650/https://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/teliot01 |date=19 January 2015 }} IAS profile.</ref>\n\nRegarding his method of playwriting, Eliot explained, \"If I set out to write a play, I start by an act of choice. I settle upon a particular emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/>\n\n==Literary criticism==\nEliot also made significant contributions to the field of [[literary criticism]], strongly influencing the school of [[New Criticism]]. He was somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work and once said his criticism was merely a \"by-product\" of his \"private poetry-workshop\" But the critic [[William Empson]] once said, \"I do not know for certain how much of my own mind [Eliot] invented, let alone how much of it is a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him. He is a very penetrating influence, perhaps not unlike the east wind.\"<ref>quoted in Roger Kimball, \"A Craving for Reality\", ''The New Criterion'' Vol. 18, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn his critical essay \"[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]\", Eliot argues that art must be understood not in a vacuum, but in the context of previous pieces of art. \"In a peculiar sense [an artist or poet] ... must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past.\"<ref name=bartleby1>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw4.html |title=Tradition and the Individual Talent|author= Eliot, T. S. |work=The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1930 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This essay was an important influence over the New Criticism by introducing the idea that the value of a work of art must be viewed in the context of the artist's previous works, a \"simultaneous order\" of works (i.e., \"tradition\"). Eliot himself employed this concept on many of his works, especially on his long-poem ''The Waste Land''.<ref>[http://www.leidykla.vu.lt/fileadmin/Literatura/51_3/98-108.pdf Dirk Weidmann: ''And I Tiresias have foresuffered all...'']. In: ''LITERATURA'' 51 (3), 2009, pp. 98\u2013108.</ref>\n\nAlso important to New Criticism was the idea\u2014as articulated in Eliot's essay \"[[Hamlet and His Problems]]\"\u2014of an \"[[objective correlative]]\", which posits a connection among the words of the text and events, states of mind, and experiences.<ref name=Hamlet>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw9.html |title=Hamlet and His Problems|author= Eliot, T. S. |work= The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1921 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This notion concedes that a poem means what it says, but suggests that there can be a non-subjective judgment based on different readers' different\u2014but perhaps corollary\u2014interpretations of a work.\n\nMore generally, New Critics took a cue from Eliot in regard to his \"'classical' ideals and his religious thought; his attention to the poetry and drama of the early seventeenth century; his deprecation of the Romantics, especially [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]; his proposition that good poems constitute 'not a turning loose of emotion but an escape from emotion'; and his insistence that 'poets... at present must be difficult'.\"<ref>Burt, Steven and Lewin, Jennifer. \"Poetry and the New Criticism\". ''A Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry'', Neil Roberts, ed. Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers, 2001. p. 154</ref>\n\nEliot's essays were a major factor in the revival of interest in the [[metaphysical poets]]. Eliot particularly praised the metaphysical poets' ability to show experience as both psychological and sensual, while at the same time infusing this portrayal with\u2014in Eliot's view\u2014wit and uniqueness. Eliot's essay \"The Metaphysical Poets\", along with giving new significance and attention to metaphysical poetry, introduced his now well-known definition of \"unified sensibility\", which is considered by some to mean the same thing as the term \"metaphysical\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_modern_literature/v027/27.1baker.html |title=Project MUSE |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |accessdate=3 August 2009|doi=10.1353/jml.2004.0051 }}</ref><ref>A.

Malloch, \"The Unified Sensibility and Metaphysical Poetry\", ''College English'', Vol. 15, No. 2 (Nov. 1953), pp. 95\u2013101</ref>\n\nHis 1922 poem ''The Waste Land''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html |author=Eliot, T. S. |title=The Waste Land|publisher=Bartleby.com |year= 1922|accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> also can be better understood in light of his work as a critic. He had argued that a poet must write \"programmatic criticism\", that is, a poet should write to advance his own interests rather than to advance \"historical scholarship\". Viewed from Eliot's critical lens, ''The Waste Land'' likely shows his personal despair about [[World War I]] rather than an objective historical understanding of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-2088/TS-Eliot |title=T. S. Eliot :: The Waste Land And Criticism |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date=4 January 1965 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nLate in his career, Eliot focused much of his creative energy on writing for the theatre; some of his earlier critical writing, in essays such as \"Poetry and Drama\",<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/poetryanddrama029231mbp|title=Poetry And Drama|first=T.

S. |year= 1921|work= The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism|publisher=bartleby.com|accessdate=26 January 2017}}</ref> focused on the aesthetics of writing drama in verse.\n\n==Critical reception==\n\n===Responses to his poetry===\nThe writer Ronald Bush notes that Eliot's early poems like \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\", \"Portrait of a Lady\", \"La Figlia Che Piange\", \"Preludes\", and \"Rhapsody on a Windy Night\" had \"[an] effect [that] was both unique and compelling, and their assurance staggered [Eliot's] contemporaries who were privileged to read them in manuscript. [Conrad] Aiken, for example, marveled at 'how sharp and complete and [[sui generis]] the whole thing was, from the outset. The wholeness is there, from the very beginning.'\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\" />\n\nThe initial critical response to Eliot's ''The Waste Land'' was mixed. Bush notes that the piece was at first correctly perceived as a work of jazz-like syncopation\u2014and, like 1920s [[jazz]], essentially iconoclastic.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/> Some critics, like [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Conrad Aiken]], and [[Gilbert Seldes]] thought it was the best poetry being written in the English language while others thought it was esoteric and wilfully difficult. Edmund Wilson, being one of the critics who praised Eliot, called him \"one of our only authentic poets\".<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\">Wilson, Edmund, \"The Poetry of Drouth\". ''The Dial'' 73. December 1922. 611\u201316.</ref> Wilson also pointed out some of Eliot's weaknesses as a poet. In regard to ''The Waste Land'', Wilson admits its flaws (\"its lack of structural unity\"), but concluded, \"I doubt whether there is a single other poem of equal length by a contemporary American which displays so high and so varied a mastery of English verse.\"<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\"/>\n\nCharles Powell was negative in his criticism of Eliot, calling his poems incomprehensible.<ref>Powell, Charles, \"So Much Waste Paper\". ''Manchester Guardian'', 31 October 1923.</ref> And the writers of ''Time'' magazine were similarly baffled by a challenging poem like ''The Waste Land''.<ref>''Time'', 3 March 1923, 12.</ref> [[John Crowe Ransom]] wrote negative criticisms of Eliot's work but also had positive things to say. For instance, though Ransom negatively criticised ''The Waste Land'' for its \"extreme disconnection\", Ransom was not completely condemnatory of Eliot's work and admitted that Eliot was a talented poet.<ref>Ransom, John Crowe. \"Waste Lands\". ''New York Evening Post Literary Review'', 14 July 1923, pp. 825\u201326.</ref>\n\nAddressing some of the common criticisms directed against ''The Waste Land'' at the time, Gilbert Seldes stated, \"It seems at first sight remarkably disconnected and confused... [however] a closer view of the poem does more than illuminate the difficulties; it reveals the hidden form of the work, [and] indicates how each thing falls into place.\"<ref>Seldes, Gilbert. \"T. S. Eliot\". ''Nation'', 6 December 1922. 614\u2013616.</ref>\n\nEliot's reputation as a poet, as well as his influence in the academy, peaked following the publication of ''The Four Quartets''. In an essay on Eliot published in 1989, the writer [[Cynthia Ozick]] refers to this peak of influence (from the 1940s through the early 1960s) as \"the Age of Eliot\" when Eliot \"seemed pure zenith, a colossus, nothing less than a permanent luminary, fixed in the firmament like the sun and the moon\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Cynthia |last=Ozick| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1989/11/20/t-s-eliot-at-101|title=T.S. ELIOT AT 101|work=The New Yorker|date=20 November 1989|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> But during this post-war period, others, like Ronald Bush, observed that this time also marked the beginning of the decline in Eliot's literary influence: <blockquote>As Eliot's conservative religious and political convictions began to seem less congenial in the postwar world, other readers reacted with suspicion to his assertions of authority, obvious in ''Four Quartets'' and implicit in the earlier poetry. The result, fueled by intermittent rediscovery of Eliot's occasional anti-Semitic rhetoric, has been a progressive downward revision of his once towering reputation.<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/></blockquote> Bush also notes that Eliot's reputation \"slipped\" significantly further after his death. He writes, \"Sometimes regarded as too academic ([[William Carlos Williams]]'s view), Eliot was also frequently criticized for a deadening [[neoclassicism]] (as he himself\u2014perhaps just as unfairly\u2014had criticized [[John Milton|Milton]]). However, the multifarious tributes from practicing poets of many schools published during his centenary in 1988 was a strong indication of the intimidating continued presence of his poetic voice.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/>\n\nAlthough Eliot's poetry is not as influential as it once was, notable literary scholars, like [[Harold Bloom]]<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''The Western Canon: Books and Schools of the Ages''. NY: Riverhead, 1995.</ref> and [[Stephen Greenblatt]],<ref name=Norton>Stephen Greenblatt, et al. (eds), ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume 2''. \"T.S. Eliot\". New York, NY: W.W. Norton & Co.: NY, NY, 2000.</ref> still acknowledge that Eliot's poetry is central to the literary English canon. For instance, the editors of ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'' write, \"There is no disagreement on [Eliot's] importance as one of the great renovators of the English poetry dialect, whose influence on a whole generation of poets, critics, and intellectuals generally was enormous. [However] his range as a poet [was] limited, and his interest in the great middle ground of human experience (as distinct from the extremes of saint and sinner) [was] deficient.\" Despite this criticism, these scholars also acknowledge \"[Eliot's] poetic cunning, his fine craftsmanship, his original accent, his historical and representative importance as ''the'' poet of the modern [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]-[[Metaphysical poets|Metaphysical]] tradition\".<ref name=Norton />\n\n===Anti-Semitism===\nThe depiction of Jews in some of Eliot's poems has led several critics to accuse him of [[anti-Semitism]]. This case has been presented most forcefully in a study by [[Anthony Julius]]: ''T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form'' (1996).<ref>[[John Gross|Gross, John]].

Nevertheless, he concluded, \"Ultimately, as both Raine and, to do him justice, Julius insist, however much Eliot may have been compromised as a person, as we all are in our several ways, his greatness as a poet remains.\"<ref name = \"Dean\"/> In another review of Raine's 2006 book, the literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] also questioned the validity of Raine's defence of Eliot's character flaws as well as the entire basis for Raine's book, writing, \"Why do critics feel a need to defend the authors they write on, like doting parents deaf to all criticism of their obnoxious children? Eliot's well-earned reputation [as a poet] is established beyond all doubt, and making him out to be as unflawed as the [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]] does him no favours.\"<ref>Eagleton, Terry.
