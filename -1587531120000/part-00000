It is located in the old town of Gandara ''(Brgy. Bangahon)''.\n\n==History==\n\nDuring the 9th century, after the Mesopotamian exploration the Hindus explored the Cambaye Island, they bring [https://web.archive.org/web/20120804005759/http://www.anagrasarkalyan.gov.in/htm/gallery_wadi.html Sabai Grass] seedlings, Negritos and the Hindus help together to grow the Grass, when the grass are ripe enough they harvest it and sundried it, Sabai fibres were extracted from Sabai Grasses, they weave the dried grass and turn it into dresses by using a [[catgut]] as a weaver.\n\nOn the 13th century an Arabian-British explorer built and structured this sea farer guide from an Scree with the help of a Negrito inhabitants located nearby with China White as an ingredient as building material, it is lit with a Western Incandescent lamp and powered by a [[Baghdad Battery|Baghdad Carbon Cell]], the said battery is charged by sun at day.\n \nGand\u00e6ra's colonial past is evident from the solitary watchtower, the Friars returned after the remaining crew of Magellan came back from Spain, and situated along the Village called Dapdap and their Shrine called Tinago in 1596, and created a Cabecera called Catbalogan, and the Bangahon Church, the [[relic]]s of the church and fragmented artworks. Statues of saints are of numbers one of which is the St. Ni\u00f1o (An infant Child) a ''White'' statue carved from wood and being tell that it is a pair of the ''Black'' statue of the St. Ni\u00f1o of Cebu the Magellan remnants they called the Black and White saints. The White statue is being told that a clan \"Correche\" is now being held it privately. Townspeople quarried the stones from [[Napalisan]] cliff or scree carried to Dapdap and then formed and constructed the [[Tinago Shrine]] and the church from what they called ''Galut'' a clay or  ''[[Feldspar]], [[Kaolinite]]'' used to make a pot or in a pottery business in Bangahon for the church of Bangahon. These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904. From the year 1907, town executives were called Presidents. And the Reyes Clan as Royalty.\n\nThe town's new [[poblacion]] was built on some six hectares of farmland donated by Martino M. Reyes. The donation was executed on January 12, 1909. The school site covered by certificate of title no. 95 dated July 20, 1912, and that of the parish under lot no. 146-CAD-444-D dated August 31, 1914, further supported by an extra judicial donation dated March 20, 1915.\n\nArticle 960 dated October 23, 1923, transferred the jurisdiction of bara\u014bgays Bangon, Buenas Aires, Calanyugan, Cambaye, San Luis, Pangi and Pagsanghan to the Municipality of [[Tarangnan, Samar|Tarangnan]].\n\nDuring World War II, there are two Mayors in this municipality, Filadelfo Diaz Aliman for the Japanese Government and Teodoro Bisnar for the Philippine Government the [[Pulahanes]] (Pulajanes).

They produce and consume by exchanging products to and from farm or towncenter, until a townfolk ''kadiong'' convinced them to put up a cooperative or a cooperation of Gandare\u00f1os\u2019 products to put up a bunk or a stockade and that cooperative will issue a bunknote to ease the trading of products or goods. Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes. Bunknotes became rampant on the town and they decided to issue a paper and metal money as a bunknote. Products from different villages stocked at the bunk, and every village has a unique bunknote to signify their origins, aside from Bangahon were a calamity had happened they only had a few stocks but in their village that stock equivalent of a bunknote has a higher value, the village with the highest stocks is the reference stocks, their number of products divided by the reference stocks is the particular village bunknote equivalent in trading. Excess stocks in the bunk are used for the development of the town.\n\nThe cooperative is until now in service but has a different name, a bank and being run by lists of corporate stores within the town.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Allotment from the National Government Budget Management Office for Gandara was PHP 28,202,218 as of 2006.\n\n==Administrative Boundaries==\n\n===Aquatic Boundaries===\n*East 11.9935 North 124.6694 merge point of Santa Margarita, Calbayog, Tarangnan and Gandara, 10,241 meters West-Northwest of Napalisan (E 11.9895 / N 124.7305)\n*East 12.0049 / North 124.7597 between Santa Margarita and Gandera a river called Lambique-Hinagbungan River 5,521 meters Northeast of Napalisan, this river serves as a boundary between two municipalities, down to East 11.99120 / North 124.75106 of the said river 1,315 meters North of Tambongan.\n*East 11.9397 / North 124.7116 merge point of Tarangnan, Pagsanghan and Gandara, 8,909 meters South-Southwest of Napalisan (E11.9895/S\\N124.7305)\n*East 11.9723 / North 124.7532 between Pagsanghan and Gandara between an islet and an island called Cambaye and Caprangasan respectively 4,763 meters Southeast of Napalisan a river called Pagsanghan-Gandara River then to East 11.9601 / North 124.7136 midpoint of a river 881 meters East-Southeast of Lungib and 319 meters Northeast of Bangon Island a river boundary then to East 11.9710 / North 124.7265, 50 meters north of Palanas midpoint of Pagsanghan-Gandara River to the right where left is back to Caprangasan.

Statues of saints are of numbers one of which is the St. Ni\u00f1o (An infant Child) a ''White'' statue carved from wood and being tell that it is a pair of the ''Black'' statue of the St. Ni\u00f1o of Cebu the Magellan remnants they called the Black and White saints. The White statue is being told that a clan \"Correche\" is now being held it privately. Townspeople quarried the stones from [[Napalisan]] cliff or scree carried to Dapdap and then formed and constructed the [[Tinago Shrine]] and the church from what they called ''Galut'' a clay or  ''[[Feldspar]], [[Kaolinite]]'' used to make a pot or in a pottery business in Bangahon for the church of Bangahon. These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904. From the year 1907, town executives were called Presidents. And the Reyes Clan as Royalty.\n\nThe town's new [[poblacion]] was built on some six hectares of farmland donated by Martino M. Reyes. The donation was executed on January 12, 1909. The school site covered by certificate of title no. 95 dated July 20, 1912, and that of the parish under lot no. 146-CAD-444-D dated August 31, 1914, further supported by an extra judicial donation dated March 20, 1915.\n\nArticle 960 dated October 23, 1923, transferred the jurisdiction of bara\u014bgays Bangon, Buenas Aires, Calanyugan, Cambaye, San Luis, Pangi and Pagsanghan to the Municipality of [[Tarangnan, Samar|Tarangnan]].\n\nDuring World War II, there are two Mayors in this municipality, Filadelfo Diaz Aliman for the Japanese Government and Teodoro Bisnar for the Philippine Government the [[Pulahanes]] (Pulajanes). During the war, the second waorld war, Japanese occupied this town and make the Gavaldon Building their headquarter, all Chinese traders, locals and their offspring were called and enslave them, making them a peasants. Japanese tell one Filadelfo Aliman that this maltreatment is a retaliation on their long aged war the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], they Chinese (sino) to fight back processed a seasoning called \"Vetsin\" (a powder from a snailshell or \u201c''tipaka han wawang nga ginpino\u201d''  in Waray that causes the illness called [http://www.globalnetwork.org/schistosomiasis schistosomiasis] and told the Filipino public that it is from the Japanese armies even its name is a Japanese word.

They produce and consume by exchanging products to and from farm or towncenter, until a townfolk ''kadiong'' convinced them to put up a cooperative or a cooperation of Gandare\u00f1os\u2019 products to put up a bunk or a stockade and that cooperative will issue a bunknote to ease the trading of products or goods. Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes. Bunknotes became rampant on the town and they decided to issue a paper and metal money as a bunknote. Products from different villages stocked at the bunk, and every village has a unique bunknote to signify their origins, aside from Bangahon were a calamity had happened they only had a few stocks but in their village that stock equivalent of a bunknote has a higher value, the village with the highest stocks is the reference stocks, their number of products divided by the reference stocks is the particular village bunknote equivalent in trading.
