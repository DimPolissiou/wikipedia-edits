It was created in 1992 when the erstwhile [[Puri District]] was split into three distinct districts, namely Khurdha, Nayagarh and Puri. It is home to the [[Baisipali Wildlife Sanctuary]]. It is like a Hill station, so far as natural scenery is concerned. [[Chhena Poda]] is the favourite sweet for which [[Nayagarh]] is famous in Odisha.\nThe name Odisha originated from Odra or Udra tribes that inhabited the central coastal belt (Khordha District and Nayagarh District) of modern Odisha.\nIn ancient times the vast area from the river Ganges in the north to that\nof the Godavari in the south and from the Bay of Bengal in the east to the\nAmarkantaka hill in the west, was occupied by four important tribes and it is\nafter them that the political units were named as Kalinga, Kosala, Odra and\nUtkala. Of these four Kalinga in ancient times exercised her control over rest\nof the three units, but later on it was confined to the region between the\nMahanadi and the Godavari rivers. Kosala on the western sector, comprised\nthe  territories, now in Raipur, Bilaspur districts of Chhatisgarh and\nSambalpur, Sundargarh, Bolangir and Kalahandi districts of modern Orissa.\nRest of Orissa to the north of the river Mahanadi up to the Ganges in ancient\ntimes, was known as Utkala and Odra.\n\n[Source-HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY,Odisha\u2019s legendary history: Hill tribes of Orissa].\n\n==History==\nNayagarh princely state was created around the 13th century and is considered as an important part in the history of Odisha. King Suryamani of Baghela dynasty came to Puri and established his kingdom at Nayagarh. Present Nayagarh District consists of the four Garjat states (small provincial states ruled by the local kings) of ex-states Ranpur, Nayagarh, Khandapara and Daspalla. The aboriginal \"Savaras\" and \"Kandhas\" are the indigenous people of Nayagarh District. The Aryans came later. Nayagarh District with its ex-states of Nayagarh, Khandapara, Daspalla and Ranpur played a major role in the freedom struggle of India.\n\nThe birth history of Nayagarh in the 13th century is an important chapter in the political history of Odisha. Suryamani of Baghela dynasty came to Puri on a pilgrimage from [[Rewa State]] in Madhya Pradesh and established his kingdom at Nayagarh. On the way to Puri, both Suryamani and his brother Chandramani took rest at night at [[Gunanati]]. The area was full of tigers and at night a tiger attacked him. Both the brothers fought the tiger and killed it. The local people praised the brave brothers and elected Suryamani as their leader. Suryamani gradually built his fort at Gunanati and married a [[Mali caste|Mali girl]]. After the death of his first wife, he again married a [[Kshatriya]] girl. From there, he then attacked Haripur and Ralaba. Ralaba was a very beautiful place. While sleeping a tiger attacked him at Ralaba; he again fought and killed it. At that moment, he saw a lady with an empty pot passed by to fetch water. Astonishingly, she returned with a little boy. Immediately, Suryamani obstructed the way of that lady and wanted to know about the mystery. The lady told she was Bouri Thakurani (a local worshiped goddess) and the tiger that the king killed was the boy. She advised Suryamani to kill her and worship her as his deity. From that date Suryamani worshiped \"Bauri Thakurani\" at Ralaba and built his fort there and adopted Tiger Head as a state symbol.\n\nNinth king of this dynasty \"Bagel Singh\" (1480\u20131510) came on a hunting to a place in between Rukshi and Balaram mountains and saw a wonderful sight that a rabbit pressed down a dog there. After seeing this extraordinary event, he selected and shifted his capital to this place. As per his name, this place was known as \"Baghua Nayagarh\". The place where such an event occurred is now known as \"Kukur Tasara\".\n\n12th King of Nayagarh Raghunath Sing (1565\u20131595) was highly powerful. During this time Muslims had already captured Odisha and the atmosphere of the coastal Odisha was fully indiscipline. Last independent king Mukunda Dev (1565) was defeated in Gohritikira and died. By taking the advantages of the political situations of coastal Odisha, Raghunath Singh attacked Ranapur and captured Odagaon, Sarankul and Baunsiapara area from Ranapur estate and dispossessed Nayagarh-Daspalla border area from the King of Boudh and Sunamuhin area of Odgaon from the King of Ghumusar. He also captured a portion from Banpur. Before death, Ragunath Singh divided his estate between his three sons. Harihar Singh was in possession of Nayagarh and Jadunath Singh got four Khandagrams (large area of land) which was later known as Khandapada. Gadadhar Singh was the son of Harihar Singh. When he was engaged in a fight with Ranpur estate, the king of Ghumusar attacked Nayagarh. Pindik Patsahani of village Sunalati with 150 soldiers fought the great army of Ghumusar and defeated him. But, in subsequent war he was captured by the enemy and sacrificed his life. Gadadhar Sing's daughter married the great poet Upendra Bhanja of Ghumusar who settled at Malisahi of Nayagarh estate after marriage. When British captured Odisha, Binayak Singh Mandhata was the King of Nayagarh and the great Jadumani (Utkal Ghanta) was his poet.\n\nThere were several Princely States in Nayagarh District. Nayagarh District was created in the year 1995. Prior to 1995 it was a subdivision of Puri district.<ref>[http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2012/April/engpdf/78-82.pdf Princely States of Nayagarh District]</ref><ref>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_princes_A-J.html Princely States]</ref>\n\n[[Daspalla State]] was founded in the 15th century.\n\n====Rulers====\n\n\nDasapalla State-\n\nLegend says that a demon named Gosinha was ruling this land during the epic period.Whose fort was located inside the Baisipalli Sanctuary, which was known as Goshinhagada during the epic period.\n\nAvailable records, writings, books reveal that at first there was no such place known as Daspalla. Rather it was a part of Boudh State ruled by Bhanj Kings. During the rule of Bira Bhanj there was a rift in between Bira Bhanj and his cousin, Sal Bhanj. The dissident Sal Banj left Boudh and proceeded to meet the Gajapati of Puri through the ages old Jagannath Sadak. While resting with his followers at Padmlatola Forest, the king of Nayagarh got the news and made alliance with Sal Bhanj and declared him the king of that area. Getting the news, Bir Bhanj of Boudh got angry and sent a troop to capture Sal Bhanj. But the troop of Boudh got defeated at the hands of Sal Bhanj and Nayagarh soldiers. As Sal Bhanj got Yasha (Fame), he named his kingdom as Yashpalla or Daspalla. Other historians tell that king Sal Bhanj had only das (oriya for 10) Pallies (villages) so Daspalli got renamed as Daspalla. This incident took place in 1495. King Sal Bhanj ruled for 3 years only and then his son Naran Bhanj ascended the throne.\n\nBut records found at Boudh state reveal that Daspalla was formed by Naran Bhanj in 1498 during the reign of Siddya Bhanj. However, it is a fact that Daspalla was formed during the last part of 15th century being separated from Baudh.\n\nThe headquarters of Daspalla changed from Badmul to Gania, Gania to Madhyakhand, Madhyakhand to Puruna Daspalla. The ninth king of Daspalla Padmanav Bhanj, during hunting, saw a wonderful thing that a wild dove was hunting and defeating a Chhanchan (Bird of prey). So, he thought the place a heroic one and decided to change his capital to that place. At that time there was a Kandha chieftain named Kunj Malik. King Padmanav Bhanj defeated Kunj Malik and started his capital here but after the name of Kunja Malik the capital got named as Kunjabanagarh.\nSource-(Lankapodi Yatra, Mahaveer Kshetra, Daspalla, Odisha).\n\n1653 \u2013 1701 Chakradhar Deo Bhanj\n1701 \u2013 1753 Padmanav Deo Bhanj\n1753 \u2013 1775 Trilochan Deo Bhanj\n1775 \u2013 1795 Makunda Bhank Deo Bhanj\n1795 \u2013 1805 Guri Charan Deo Bhanj\n1805 \u2013 1845 Krishna Chanda Deo Bhanj\n1845 \u2013 1861 Madhusudan Deo Bhanj\n\n1861 \u2013 1873 Narsimha Bhanj\n1873 \u2013 1896 Chaitan Deo Bhanj\n1896 \u2013 1913 Narayan Deo Bhanj\n1913 \u2013 15 Aug 1947 Kishor Chandra Deo Bhanj (b. 1908)\n1653 - 1701                Chakradhar Deo Bhanj.  \n1701 - 1753                Padmanav Deo Bhanj.   \n1753 - 1775                Trilochan Deo Bhanj. \n1775 - 1795                Makunda Bhank Deo Bhanj.  \n1795 - 1805                Guri Charan Deo Bhanj.  \n1805 - 1845                Krishna Chanda Deo Bhanj.   \n1845 - 1861                Madhusudan Deo Bhanj.   \n1861 - Jan 1873            Narsimha Deo Bhanj.   \n21 Jan 1873 - 21 May 1874  Chaitan Deo Bhanj                  (b. 1854 - d. ....).\n\n=====Rajas=====\n\n21 May 1874 - 1896         Chaitan Deo Bhanj                  (s.a.). \n1896 - 11 Dec 1913         Narayan Deo Bhanj                  (b. 1860 - d. 1913).  \n11 Dec 1913 - 15 Aug 1947  Kishor Chandra Deo Bhanj           (b. 1908 - d. 1960).\n11 Dec 1913 -  3 Mar 1930  .... -Regent.\n\nKhandpara State-\nFounded in the 17th century by a former Raja of Rewah or by the Raja Raghunath Singh of Nayagarh, who had two sons, the elder son, Harihar Singh, became Raja of Nayagarh, and the younger, Jadunath Singh Mangraj, retained possession of four Garhs, or forts, as his share, viz.

It was created in 1992 when the erstwhile [[Puri District]] was split into three distinct districts, namely Khurdha, Nayagarh and Puri. It is home to the [[Baisipali Wildlife Sanctuary]]. It is like a Hill station, so far as natural scenery is concerned. [[Chhena Poda]] is the favourite sweet for which [[Nayagarh]] is famous in Odisha.\nThe name Odisha originated from Odra or Udra tribes that inhabited the central coastal belt (Khordha District and Nayagarh District) of modern Odisha.\nIn ancient times the vast area from the river Ganges in the north to that\nof the Godavari in the south and from the Bay of Bengal in the east to the\nAmarkantaka hill in the west, was occupied by four important tribes and it is\nafter them that the political units were named as Kalinga, Kosala, Odra and\nUtkala. Of these four Kalinga in ancient times exercised her control over rest\nof the three units, but later on it was confined to the region between the\nMahanadi and the Godavari rivers. Kosala on the western sector, comprised\nthe  territories, now in Raipur, Bilaspur districts of Chhatisgarh and\nSambalpur, Sundargarh, Bolangir and Kalahandi districts of modern Orissa.\nRest of Orissa to the north of the river Mahanadi up to the Ganges in ancient\ntimes, was known as Utkala and Odra.\n\n[Source-HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY,Odisha\u2019s legendary history: Hill tribes of Orissa].\n\n==History==\nNayagarh princely state was created around the 13th century and is considered as an important part in the history of Odisha. King Suryamani of Baghela dynasty came to Puri and established his kingdom at Nayagarh. Present Nayagarh District consists of the four Garjat states (small provincial states ruled by the local kings) of ex-states Ranpur, Nayagarh, Khandapara and Daspalla. The aboriginal \"Savaras\" and \"Kandhas\" are the indigenous people of Nayagarh District. The Aryans came later. Nayagarh District with its ex-states of Nayagarh, Khandapara, Daspalla and Ranpur played a major role in the freedom struggle of India.\n\nThe birth history of Nayagarh in the 13th century is an important chapter in the political history of Odisha. Suryamani of Baghela dynasty came to Puri on a pilgrimage from [[Rewa State]] in Madhya Pradesh and established his kingdom at Nayagarh. On the way to Puri, both Suryamani and his brother Chandramani took rest at night at [[Gunanati]]. The area was full of tigers and at night a tiger attacked him. Both the brothers fought the tiger and killed it. The local people praised the brave brothers and elected Suryamani as their leader. Suryamani gradually built his fort at Gunanati and married a [[Mali caste|Mali girl]]. After the death of his first wife, he again married a [[Kshatriya]] girl. From there, he then attacked Haripur and Ralaba. Ralaba was a very beautiful place. While sleeping a tiger attacked him at Ralaba; he again fought and killed it. At that moment, he saw a lady with an empty pot passed by to fetch water. Astonishingly, she returned with a little boy. Immediately, Suryamani obstructed the way of that lady and wanted to know about the mystery. The lady told she was Bouri Thakurani (a local worshiped goddess) and the tiger that the king killed was the boy. She advised Suryamani to kill her and worship her as his deity. From that date Suryamani worshiped \"Bauri Thakurani\" at Ralaba and built his fort there and adopted Tiger Head as a state symbol.\n\nNinth king of this dynasty \"Bagel Singh\" (1480\u20131510) came on a hunting to a place in between Rukshi and Balaram mountains and saw a wonderful sight that a rabbit pressed down a dog there. After seeing this extraordinary event, he selected and shifted his capital to this place. As per his name, this place was known as \"Baghua Nayagarh\". The place where such an event occurred is now known as \"Kukur Tasara\".\n\n12th King of Nayagarh Raghunath Sing (1565\u20131595) was highly powerful. During this time Muslims had already captured Odisha and the atmosphere of the coastal Odisha was fully indiscipline. Last independent king Mukunda Dev (1565) was defeated in Gohritikira and died. By taking the advantages of the political situations of coastal Odisha, Raghunath Singh attacked Ranapur and captured Odagaon, Sarankul and Baunsiapara area from Ranapur estate and dispossessed Nayagarh-Daspalla border area from the King of Boudh and Sunamuhin area of Odgaon from the King of Ghumusar. He also captured a portion from Banpur. Before death, Ragunath Singh divided his estate between his three sons. Harihar Singh was in possession of Nayagarh and Jadunath Singh got four Khandagrams (large area of land) which was later known as Khandapada. Gadadhar Singh was the son of Harihar Singh. When he was engaged in a fight with Ranpur estate, the king of Ghumusar attacked Nayagarh. Pindik Patsahani of village Sunalati with 150 soldiers fought the great army of Ghumusar and defeated him. But, in subsequent war he was captured by the enemy and sacrificed his life. Gadadhar Sing's daughter married the great poet Upendra Bhanja of Ghumusar who settled at Malisahi of Nayagarh estate after marriage. When British captured Odisha, Binayak Singh Mandhata was the King of Nayagarh and the great Jadumani (Utkal Ghanta) was his poet.\n\nThere were several Princely States in Nayagarh District. Nayagarh District was created in the year 1995. Prior to 1995 it was a subdivision of Puri district.<ref>[http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2012/April/engpdf/78-82.pdf Princely States of Nayagarh District]</ref><ref>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_princes_A-J.html Princely States]</ref>\n\n[[Daspalla State]] was founded in the 15th century.\n\n====Rulers====\n\n\nDasapalla State-\n\nLegend says that a demon named Gosinha was ruling this land during the epic period.Whose fort was located inside the Baisipalli Sanctuary, which was known as Goshinhagada during the epic period.\n\nAvailable records, writings, books reveal that at first there was no such place known as Daspalla. Rather it was a part of Boudh State ruled by Bhanj Kings. During the rule of Bira Bhanj there was a rift in between Bira Bhanj and his cousin, Sal Bhanj. The dissident Sal Banj left Boudh and proceeded to meet the Gajapati of Puri through the ages old Jagannath Sadak. While resting with his followers at Padmlatola Forest, the king of Nayagarh got the news and made alliance with Sal Bhanj and declared him the king of that area. Getting the news, Bir Bhanj of Boudh got angry and sent a troop to capture Sal Bhanj. But the troop of Boudh got defeated at the hands of Sal Bhanj and Nayagarh soldiers. As Sal Bhanj got Yasha (Fame), he named his kingdom as Yashpalla or Daspalla. Other historians tell that king Sal Bhanj had only das (oriya for 10) Pallies (villages) so Daspalli got renamed as Daspalla. This incident took place in 1495. King Sal Bhanj ruled for 3 years only and then his son Naran Bhanj ascended the throne.\n\nBut records found at Boudh state reveal that Daspalla was formed by Naran Bhanj in 1498 during the reign of Siddya Bhanj. However, it is a fact that Daspalla was formed during the last part of 15th century being separated from Baudh.\n\nThe headquarters of Daspalla changed from Badmul to Gania, Gania to Madhyakhand, Madhyakhand to Puruna Daspalla. The ninth king of Daspalla Padmanav Bhanj, during hunting, saw a wonderful thing that a wild dove was hunting and defeating a Chhanchan (Bird of prey). So, he thought the place a heroic one and decided to change his capital to that place. At that time there was a Kandha chieftain named Kunj Malik. King Padmanav Bhanj defeated Kunj Malik and started his capital here but after the name of Kunja Malik the capital got named as Kunjabanagarh.\nSource-(Lankapodi Yatra, Mahaveer Kshetra, Daspalla, Odisha).\n1653 \u2013 1701 Chakradhar Deo Bhanj\n1701 \u2013 1753 Padmanav Deo Bhanj\n1753 \u2013 1775 Trilochan Deo Bhanj\n1775 \u2013 1795 Makunda Bhank Deo Bhanj\n1795 \u2013 1805 Guri Charan Deo Bhanj\n1805 \u2013 1845 Krishna Chanda Deo Bhanj\n1845 \u2013 1861 Madhusudan Deo Bhanj\n\n1861 \u2013 1873 Narsimha Bhanj\n1873 \u2013 1896 Chaitan Deo Bhanj\n1896 \u2013 1913 Narayan Deo Bhanj\n1913 \u2013 15 Aug 1947 Kishor Chandra Deo Bhanj (b. 1908)\n1653 - 1701                Chakradhar Deo Bhanj.  \n1701 - 1753                Padmanav Deo Bhanj.   \n1753 - 1775                Trilochan Deo Bhanj. \n1775 - 1795                Makunda Bhank Deo Bhanj.  \n1795 - 1805                Guri Charan Deo Bhanj.  \n1805 - 1845                Krishna Chanda Deo Bhanj.   \n1845 - 1861                Madhusudan Deo Bhanj.   \n1861 - Jan 1873            Narsimha Deo Bhanj.   \n21 Jan 1873 - 21 May 1874  Chaitan Deo Bhanj                  (b. 1854 - d. ....).\n\n=====Rajas=====\n\n21 May 1874 - 1896         Chaitan Deo Bhanj                  (s.a.). \n1896 - 11 Dec 1913         Narayan Deo Bhanj                  (b. 1860 - d. 1913).  \n11 Dec 1913 - 15 Aug 1947  Kishor Chandra Deo Bhanj           (b. 1908 - d. 1960).\n11 Dec 1913 -  3 Mar 1930  .... -Regent.\n\nKhandpara State-\nFounded in the 17th century by a former Raja of Rewah or by the Raja Raghunath Singh of Nayagarh, who had two sons, the elder son, Harihar Singh, became Raja of Nayagarh, and the younger, Jadunath Singh Mangraj, retained possession of four Garhs, or forts, as his share, viz.

The formula expresses the fact that the sum of the sizes of the two sets may be too large since some elements may be counted twice. The double-counted elements are those in the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the two sets and the count is corrected by subtracting the size of the intersection.\n\nThe principle is more clearly seen in the case of three sets, which for the sets ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' is given by \n:<math>|A \\cup B \\cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \\cap B| - |A \\cap C| - |B \\cap C| + |A \\cap B \\cap C|.</math>\nThis formula can be verified by counting how many times each region in the [[Venn diagram]] figure is included in the right-hand side of the formula. In this case, when removing the contributions of over-counted elements, the number of elements in the mutual intersection of the three sets has been subtracted too often, so must be added back in to get the correct total.\n\n[[Image:Inclusion-exclusion.svg|thumb|Inclusion\u2013exclusion illustrated by a Venn diagram for three sets]]\n\nGeneralizing the results of these examples gives the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion.  To find the cardinality of the union of {{mvar|n}} sets:\n\n# Include the cardinalities of the sets.\n# Exclude the cardinalities of the pairwise intersections.\n# Include the cardinalities of the triple-wise intersections.\n# Exclude the cardinalities of the quadruple-wise intersections.\n# Include the cardinalities of the quintuple-wise intersections.\n# Continue, until the cardinality of the {{mvar|n}}-tuple-wise intersection is included (if {{mvar|n}} is odd) or excluded ({{mvar|n}} even).\n\nThe name comes from the idea that the principle is based on over-generous ''inclusion'', followed by compensating ''exclusion''.\nThis concept is attributed to [[Abraham de Moivre]] (1718);<ref name=\"Roberts 2009 loc=pg. 405\">{{harvnb|Roberts|Tesman|2009|loc=pg. 405}}</ref> but it first appears in a paper of [[Daniel da Silva (mathematician)|Daniel da Silva]] (1854),<ref>{{harvnb|Mazur|2010|loc=pg. 94}}</ref> and later in a paper by [[J. J. Sylvester]] (1883).<ref>{{harvnb|van Lint|Wilson|1992|loc=pg. 77}}</ref> Sometimes the principle is referred to as the formula of Da Silva, or Sylvester due to these publications. The principle is an example of the [[Sieve theory|sieve method]] extensively used in [[number theory]] and is sometimes referred to as the ''sieve formula'',<ref>{{harvnb|van Lint|Wilson|1992|loc = pg. 77}}</ref> though Legendre already used a similar device in a sieve context in 1808.\n\nAs finite probabilities are computed as counts relative to the cardinality of the [[probability space]], the formulas for the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion remain valid when the cardinalities of the sets are replaced by finite probabilities. More generally, both versions of the principle can be put under the common umbrella of [[measure theory]].\n\nIn a very abstract setting, the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion can be expressed as the calculation of the inverse of a certain matrix.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanley|1986|loc=pg. 64}}</ref> This inverse has a special structure, making the principle an extremely valuable technique in combinatorics and related areas of mathematics. As [[Gian-Carlo Rota]] put it:<ref>{{citation|last=Rota|first=Gian-Carlo|title=On the foundations of combinatoial theory I. Theory of M\u00f6bius functions|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie|volume=2|year=1964|pages=340\u2013368|doi=10.1007/BF00531932}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"One of the most useful principles of enumeration in discrete probability and combinatorial theory is the celebrated principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion. When skillfully applied, this principle has yielded the solution to many a combinatorial problem.\"</blockquote>\n\n==Statement==\nIn its general form, the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion states that for finite sets {{math|''A''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''A<sub>n</sub>''}}, one has the identity\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\left|\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\\right| = \\sum_{i=1}^n |A_i| - \\sum_{1 \\leqslant i < j \\leqslant n} |A_i\\cap A_j| + \\sum_{1 \\leqslant i < j < k \\leqslant n} |A_i \\cap A_j\\cap A_k| - \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1} \\left|A_1\\cap\\cdots\\cap A_n\\right|.</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\n[[Image:inclusion-exclusion-3sets.png|thumb|Each term of the inclusion\u2013exclusion formula gradually corrects the count until finally each portion of the [[Venn diagram]] is counted exactly once.]]\n\nThis can be compactly written as\n\n:<math>\\left|\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\\right| = \\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k+1} \\left( \\sum_{1 \\leqslant i_1 < \\cdots < i_k \\leqslant n} | A_{i_1} \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_{i_k} | \\right)</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>\\left| \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\\right| = \\sum_{\\emptyset\\neq J\\subseteq\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}}(-1)^{|J|+1} \\left |\\bigcap_{j\\in J} A_j\\right|.</math>\n\nIn words, to count the number of elements in a finite union of finite sets, first sum the cardinalities of the individual sets, then subtract the number of elements that appear in at least two sets, then add back the number of elements that appear in at least three sets, then subtract the number of elements that appear in at least four sets, and so on. This process always ends since there can be no elements that appear in more than the number of sets in the union. (For example, if <math>n = 4,</math> there can be no elements that appear in more than <math>4</math> sets; equivalently, there can be no elements that appear in at least <math>5</math> sets.)\n\nIn applications it is common to see the principle expressed in its complementary form. That is, letting {{mvar|S}} be a finite [[universal set]] containing all of the {{math|''A<sub>i</sub>''}} and letting <math>\\bar{A_i}</math> denote the complement of {{math|''A<sub>i</sub>''}} in {{mvar|S}}, by [[De Morgan's laws]] we have\n\n:<math>\\left|\\bigcap_{i=1}^n \\bar{A_i}\\right| = \\left|S - \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right| =|S| - \\sum_{i=1}^n |A_i| + \\sum_{1 \\leqslant i < j \\leqslant n} |A_i\\cap A_j| - \\cdots + (-1)^n |A_1\\cap\\cdots\\cap A_n|.</math>\n\nAs another variant of the statement, let {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''P<sub>n</sub>''}} be a list of properties that elements of a set {{mvar|S}} may or may not have, then the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion provides a way to calculate the number of elements of {{mvar|S}} which have none of the properties. Just let {{math|''A<sub>i</sub>''}} be the subset of elements of {{mvar|S}} which have the property {{math|''P<sub>i</sub>''}} and use the principle in its complementary form. This variant is due to [[J. J. Sylvester]].<ref name=\"Roberts 2009 loc=pg. 405\"/>\n\nNotice that if you take into account only the first {{math|''m<n''}} sums on the right (in the general form of the principle), then you will get an overestimate if {{math|''m''}} is odd and an underestimate if {{math|''m''}} is even.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Counting integers===\nAs a simple example of the use of the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion, consider the question:<ref>{{harvnb|Mazur|2010|loc=pp. 83\u20134, 88}}</ref>\n\n:How many integers in {1,...,100} are not divisible by 2, 3 or 5?\n\nLet ''S'' = {1,...,100} and ''P''<sub>1</sub> the property that an integer is divisible by 2, ''P''<sub>2</sub> the property that an integer is divisible by 3 and ''P''<sub>3</sub> the property that an integer is divisible by 5. Letting ''A''<sub>i</sub> be the subset of ''S'' whose elements have property ''P''<sub>i</sub> we have by elementary counting: |''A''<sub>1</sub>| = 50, |''A''<sub>2</sub>| = 33, and |''A''<sub>3</sub>| = 20. There are 16 of these integers divisible by 6, 10 divisible by 10, and 6 divisible by 15. Finally, there are just 3 integers divisible by 30, so the number of integers not divisible by any of 2, 3 or 5 is given by:\n\n:100 \u2212 (50 + 33 + 20) + (16 + 10 + 6) \u2212 3 = 26.\n\n===Counting derangements===\nA more complex example is the following.\n \nSuppose there is a deck of ''n'' cards numbered from 1&nbsp;to&nbsp;''n''.  Suppose a card numbered ''m'' is in the correct position if it is the ''m''th card in the deck. How many ways, ''W'', can the cards be shuffled with at least 1 card being in the correct position?\n\nBegin by defining set ''A''<sub>''m''</sub>, which is all of the orderings of cards with the ''m''th card correct.  Then the number of orders, ''W'', with ''at least'' one card being in the correct position, ''m'', is\n\n: <math>W = \\left|\\bigcup_{m=1}^n A_m\\right|.</math>\n\nApply the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion,\n\n: <math>W = \\sum_{m_1=1}^n |A_{m_1}| - \\sum_{1 \\leqslant m_1 < m_2 \\leqslant n} |A_{m_1} \\cap A_{m_2}| +\\cdots + (-1)^{p-1} \\sum_{1 \\leqslant m_1 < \\cdots < m_p \\leqslant n} | A_{m_1} \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_{m_p}| + \\cdots</math>\n\nEach value <math>A_{m_1} \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_{m_p}</math> represents the set of shuffles having at least ''p'' values ''m''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''m<sub>p</sub>'' in the correct position.  Note that the number of shuffles with at least ''p'' values correct only depends on ''p'', not on the particular values of <math>m</math>.  For example, the number of shuffles having the 1st, 3rd, and 17th cards in the correct position is the same as the number of shuffles having the 2nd, 5th, and 13th cards in the correct positions.  It only matters that of the ''n'' cards, 3 were chosen to be in the correct position.  Thus there are <math>{n \\choose p}</math> equal terms in the ''p''th summation (see [[combination]]).\n\n:<math>W = {n \\choose 1} |A_1| - {n \\choose 2} |A_1 \\cap A_2| + \\cdots + (-1)^{p-1} {n \\choose p} |A_1 \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_p| + \\cdots\n</math>\n\n<math>|A_1 \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_p|</math> is the number of orderings having ''p'' elements in the correct position, which is equal to the number of ways of ordering the remaining ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p'' elements, or (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p'')!. Thus we finally get:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\nW &= {n \\choose 1} (n-1)!  - {n \\choose 2} (n-2)!  + \\cdots + (-1)^{p-1} {n \\choose p} (n-p)! + \\cdots\\\\\n&= \\sum_{p=1}^n (-1)^{p-1} {n \\choose p} (n-p)!  \\\\\n&= \\sum_{p=1}^n (-1)^{p-1} \\frac{n!}{p!(n-p)!} (n-p)! \\\\\n&= \\sum_{p=1}^n (-1)^{p-1} \\frac{n!}{p!}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nA permutation where ''no'' card is in the correct position is called a [[derangement]]. Taking ''n''! to be the total number of permutations, the probability ''Q'' that a random shuffle produces a derangement is given by\n\n: <math>Q = 1 - \\frac{W}{n!} = \\sum_{p=0}^n \\frac{(-1)^p}{p!}, </math>\n\na truncation to ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 terms of the [[Taylor series|Taylor expansion]] of ''e''<sup>\u22121</sup>. Thus the probability of guessing an order for a shuffled deck of cards and being incorrect about every card is approximately ''e''<sup>\u22121</sup> or 37%.\n\n==A special case==\n\nThe situation that appears in the derangement example above occurs often enough to merit special attention.<ref>{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|loc=pp. 167\u20138}}</ref> Namely, when the size of the intersection sets appearing in the formulas for the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion depend only on the number of sets in the intersections and not on which sets appear. More formally, if the intersection\n\n:<math>A_J:=\\bigcap_{j\\in J} A_j</math>\n\nhas the same cardinality, say ''\u03b1<sub>k</sub>'' = |''A<sub>J</sub>''|, for every ''k''-element subset ''J'' of {1,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''n''}, then\n\n:<math>\\left |\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\\right|  =\\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1}\\binom nk \\alpha_k.</math>\n\nOr, in the complementary form, where the universal set ''S'' has cardinality ''\u03b1''<sub>0</sub>,\n\n:<math>\\left |S \\setminus \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\\right|  =\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k}\\binom nk \\alpha_k.</math>\n\n==A generalization==\n\nGiven a [[family of sets|family (repeats allowed) of subsets]] ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''A''<sub>n</sub> of a universal set ''S'', the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion calculates the number of elements of ''S'' in none of these subsets. A generalization of this concept would calculate the number of elements of ''S'' which appear in exactly some fixed ''m'' of these sets.\n\nLet ''N'' = <nowiki>[</nowiki>''n''<nowiki>]</nowiki> = {1,2,...,''n''}. If we define <math>A_{\\emptyset} = S</math>, then the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion can be written as, using the notation of the previous section; the number of elements of ''S'' contained in none of the ''A''<sub>i</sub> is:\n::<math> \\sum_{J \\subseteq [n]} (-1)^{|J|} |A_J|.</math>\n\nIf ''I'' is a fixed subset of the index set ''N'', then the number of elements which belong to ''A''<sub>i</sub> for all ''i'' in ''I'' and for no other values is:<ref>{{harvnb|Cameron|1994|loc=pg. 78}}</ref>\n:<math> \\sum_{I \\subseteq J} (-1)^{|J| - |I|} |A_J|.</math>\nDefine the sets\n\n:<math>B_k = A_{I \\cup \\{ k \\}} \\text{ for } k \\in N \\setminus I.</math>\n\nWe seek the number of elements in none of the ''B''<sub>k</sub> which, by the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion (with <math>B_\\emptyset = A_I</math>), is\n\n:<math>\\sum_{K \\subseteq N \\setminus I} (-1)^{|K|}|B_K|.</math>\n\nThe correspondence ''K'' \u2194 ''J'' = ''I'' \u222a ''K'' between subsets of ''N''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;''I'' and subsets of ''N'' containing ''I'' is a bijection and if ''J'' and ''K'' correspond under this map then ''B''<sub>K</sub> = ''A''<sub>J</sub>, showing that the result is valid.\n\n==In probability==\n\nIn [[probability]], for events ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> in a [[probability space]] <math>\\scriptstyle(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},\\mathbb{P})</math>, the inclusion\u2013exclusion principle becomes for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{P}(A_1\\cup A_2)=\\mathbb{P}(A_1)+\\mathbb{P}(A_2)-\\mathbb{P}(A_1\\cap A_2),</math>\n\nfor ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{P}(A_1\\cup A_2\\cup A_3)=\\mathbb{P}(A_1)+\\mathbb{P}(A_2)+\\mathbb{P}(A_3)-\\mathbb{P}(A_1\\cap A_2)-\\mathbb{P}(A_1\\cap A_3)-\\mathbb{P}(A_2\\cap A_3)+\\mathbb{P}(A_1\\cap A_2\\cap A_3)</math>\n\nand in general\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{P}(A_i) -\\sum_{i<j}\\mathbb{P}(A_i\\cap A_j)+\\sum_{i<j<k}\\mathbb{P}(A_i\\cap A_j\\cap A_k) + \\cdots +(-1)^{n-1} \\sum_{i<...<n}\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i\\right),</math>\n\nwhich can be written in closed form as\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\\right)=\\sum_{k=1}^n \\left((-1)^{k-1}\\sum_{I\\subseteq\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\atop |I|=k} \\mathbb{P}(A_I)\\right),</math>\n\nwhere the last sum runs over all subsets ''I'' of the indices 1, ..., ''n'' which contain exactly ''k'' elements, and\n\n:<math>A_I:=\\bigcap_{i\\in I} A_i</math>\n\ndenotes the intersection of all those ''A<sub>i</sub>'' with index in ''I''.\n\nAccording to the [[Boole's inequality#Bonferroni inequalities|Bonferroni inequalities]], the sum of the first terms in the formula is alternately an upper bound and a lower bound for the [[Sides of an equation|LHS]]. This can be used in cases where the full formula is too cumbersome.\n\nFor a general [[measure space]] (''S'',\u03a3,''\u03bc'') and [[measurable]] subsets ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> of finite measure, the above identities also hold when the probability measure <math>\\mathbb{P}</math> is replaced by the measure ''\u03bc''.\n\n===Special case===\n\nIf, in the probabilistic version of the inclusion\u2013exclusion principle, the probability of the intersection ''A''<sub>''I''</sub> only depends on the cardinality of ''I'', meaning that for every ''k'' in {1,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''n''} there is an ''a<sub>k</sub>'' such that\n\n:<math>a_k=\\mathbb{P}(A_I) \\text{ for every } I\\subset\\{1,\\ldots,n\\} \\text{ with } |I|=k,</math>\n\nthen the above formula simplifies to\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\\right) =\\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1}\\binom n k a_k </math>\n\ndue to the combinatorial interpretation of the [[binomial coefficient]] <math>\\scriptstyle\\binom nk</math>. For example, if the events <math>A_i</math> are [[independent and identically distributed]], then <math>\\mathbb{P}(A_i) = p</math> for all ''i'', and we have <math>a_k = p^k</math>, in which case the expression above simplifies to\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\\right) = 1 - (1-p)^n. </math>\n\n(This result can also be derived more simply by considering the intersection of the complements of the events <math>A_i</math>.)\n\nAn analogous simplification is possible in the case of a general measure space (''S'',\u03a3,''\u03bc'') and measurable subsets ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> of finite measure.\n\n==Other forms==\n\nThe principle is sometimes stated in the form<ref>{{harvnb|Graham| Gr\u00f6tschel|Lov\u00e1sz|1995|loc=pg. 1049}}</ref> that says that if\n\n:<math>g(A)=\\sum_{S \\subseteq A}f(S)</math>\n\nthen\n\n:<math>f(A)=\\sum_{S \\subseteq A}(-1)^{|A|-|S|}g(S) \\qquad (**)</math>\n\nThe combinatorial and the probabilistic version of the inclusion\u2013exclusion principle are instances of (**).\n{{collapse top|title=Proof}}\nTake <math>\\underline{m} = \\{1,2,\\ldots,m\\}</math>, <math>f(\\underline{m}) = 0</math>, and\n\n:<math>f(S)=\\left|\\bigcap_{i \\in \\underline{m} \\setminus S} A_i \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in S} A_i\\right| \\text{ and } f(S) = \\mathbb{P} \\left(\\bigcap_{i \\in \\underline{m} \\setminus S} A_i \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in S} A_i\\right)</math>\n\nrespectively for all [[set (mathematics)|sets]] <math>S</math> with <math>S \\subsetneq \\underline{m}</math>.

A ''derangement'' of a set ''A'' is a [[bijection]] from ''A'' into itself that has no fixed points. Via the inclusion\u2013exclusion principle one can show that if the cardinality of ''A'' is ''n'', then the number of derangements is [''n''!&nbsp;/&nbsp;''e''] where [''x''] denotes the [[nearest integer function|nearest integer]] to ''x''; a detailed proof is available [[Random permutation statistics#Number of permutations that are derangements|here]] and also see [[#Examples|the examples section]] above.\n\nThe first occurrence of the problem of counting the number of derangements is in an early book on games of chance: ''Essai d'analyse sur les jeux de hazard'' by P. R. de Montmort (1678 &ndash; 1719) and was known as either \"Montmort's problem\" or by the name he gave it, \"''probl\u00e8me des rencontres''.\"<ref>{{harvnb|van Lint|Wilson|1992|loc=pp. 77-8}}</ref> The problem is also known as the ''hatcheck problem.''\n\nThe number of derangements is also known as the [[subfactorial]] of ''n'', written !''n''. It follows that if all bijections are assigned the same probability then the probability that a random bijection is a derangement quickly approaches 1/''e'' as ''n'' grows.\n\n===Counting intersections===\nThe principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion, combined with [[De Morgan's law]], can be used to count the cardinality of the intersection of sets as well. Let <math>\\overline{A_k}</math> represent the complement of ''A<sub>k</sub>'' with respect to some universal set ''A'' such that <math>A_k \\subseteq A</math> for each ''k''. Then we have\n\n:<math>\\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i = \\overline{\\bigcup_{i=1}^n \\overline{A_i}}</math>\n\nthereby turning the problem of finding an intersection into the problem of finding a union.\n\n===Graph coloring===\nThe inclusion exclusion principle forms the basis of algorithms for a number of NP-hard graph partitioning problems, such as graph coloring.<ref name=\"bhk\">{{harvnb|Bj\u00f6rklund|Husfeldt|Koivisto|2009}}</ref>\n\nA well known application of the principle is the construction of the [[chromatic polynomial]] of a graph.<ref>{{harvnb|Gross|2008|loc=pp. 211\u201313}}</ref>\n\n===Bipartite graph perfect matchings===\nThe number of [[perfect matching]]s of a [[bipartite graph]] can be calculated using the principle.<ref>{{harvnb|Gross|2008|loc=pp. 208\u201310}}</ref>\n\n===Number of onto functions===\nGiven finite sets ''A'' and ''B'', how many [[surjective function]]s (onto functions) are there from ''A'' to ''B''? [[Without any loss of generality]] we may take ''A'' = {1, ..., ''k''} and ''B'' = {1, ..., ''n''}, since only the cardinalities of the sets matter. By using ''S'' as the set of all [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] from ''A'' to ''B'', and defining, for each ''i'' in ''B'', the property ''P<sub>i</sub>'' as \"the function misses the element ''i'' in ''B''\" (''i'' is not in the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of the function), the principle of inclusion&ndash;exclusion gives the number of onto functions between ''A'' and ''B'' as:<ref>{{harvnb|Mazur|2008|loc=pp.84-5, 90}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\sum_{j=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{j} (-1)^j (n-j)^k.</math>\n\n===Permutations with forbidden positions===\nA [[permutation]] of the set ''S'' = {1, ..., ''n''} where each element of ''S'' is restricted to not being in certain positions (here the permutation is considered as an ordering of the elements of ''S'') is called a ''permutation with forbidden positions''. For example, with ''S'' = {1,2,3,4}, the permutations with the restriction that the element 1 can not be in positions 1 or 3, and the element 2 can not be in position 4 are: 2134, 2143, 3124, 4123, 2341, 2431, 3241, 3421, 4231 and 4321. By letting ''A<sub>i</sub>'' be the set of positions that the element ''i'' is not allowed to be in, and the property ''P''<sub>''i''</sub> to be the property that a permutation puts element ''i'' into a position in ''A<sub>i</sub>'', the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion can be used to count the number of permutations which satisfy all the restrictions.<ref>{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|loc=pp. 177&ndash;81}}</ref>\n\nIn the given example, there are 12 = 2(3!) permutations with property ''P''<sub>1</sub>, 6 = 3! permutations with property ''P''<sub>2</sub> and no permutations have properties ''P''<sub>3</sub> or ''P''<sub>4</sub> as there are no restrictions for these two elements. The number of permutations satisfying the restrictions is thus:\n\n:4! \u2212 (12 + 6 + 0 + 0) + (4) = 24 \u2212 18 + 4 = 10.\n\nThe final 4 in this computation is the number of permutations having both properties ''P''<sub>1</sub> and ''P''<sub>2</sub>. There are no other non-zero contributions to the formula.\n\n===Stirling numbers of the second kind===\n{{main|Stirling numbers of the second kind}}\n\nThe [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]], ''S''(''n'',''k'') count the number of [[Partition of a set|partitions]] of a set of ''n'' elements into ''k'' non-empty subsets (indistinguishable ''boxes''). An explicit formula for them can be obtained by applying the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion to a very closely related problem, namely, counting the number of partitions of an ''n''-set into ''k'' non-empty but distinguishable boxes ([[Ordered set|ordered]] non-empty subsets). Using the universal set consisting of all partitions of the ''n''-set into ''k'' (possibly empty) distinguishable boxes, ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''A<sub>k</sub>'', and the properties ''P<sub>i</sub>'' meaning that the partition has box ''A<sub>i</sub>'' empty, the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion gives an answer for the related result. Dividing by ''k''! to remove the artificial ordering gives the Stirling number of the second kind:<ref>{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|loc=pp. 282&ndash;7}}</ref>\n\n:<math>S(n,k) = \\frac{1}{k!}\\sum_{t=0}^k (-1)^t \\binom k t (k-t)^n.</math>\n\n===Rook polynomials===\n{{main|Rook polynomial}}\n\nA rook polynomial is the [[generating polynomial|generating function]] of the number of ways to place non-attacking [[rook (chess)|rooks]] on a ''board B'' that looks like a subset of the squares of a [[checkerboard]]; that is, no two rooks may be in the same row or column. The board ''B'' is any subset of the squares of a rectangular board with ''n'' rows and ''m'' columns; we think of it as the squares in which one is allowed to put a rook. The [[coefficient]], ''r<sub>k</sub>''(''B'') of ''x<sup>k</sup>'' in the rook polynomial ''R<sub>B</sub>''(''x'') is the number of ways ''k'' rooks, none of which attacks another, can be arranged in the squares of ''B''. For any board ''B'', there is a complementary board <math>B'</math> consisting of the squares of the rectangular board that are not in ''B''. This complementary board also has a rook polynomial <math>R_{B'}(x)</math> with coefficients <math>r_k(B').</math>\n\nIt is sometimes convenient to be able to calculate the highest coefficient of a rook polynomial in terms of the coefficients of the rook polynomial of the complementary board. Without loss of generality we can assume that ''n'' \u2264 ''m'', so this coefficient is ''r<sub>n</sub>''(''B''). The number of ways to place ''n'' non-attacking rooks on the complete ''n'' \u00d7 ''m'' \"checkerboard\" (without regard as to whether the rooks are placed in the squares of the board ''B'') is given by the [[falling factorial]]:\n\n:<math>(m)_n = m(m-1)(m-2) \\cdots (m-n+1).</math>\n\nLetting ''P''<sub>i</sub> be the property that an assignment of ''n'' non-attacking rooks on the complete board has a rook in column ''i'' which is not in a square of the board ''B'', then by the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion we have:<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|Tesman|2009|loc=pp.419&ndash;20}}</ref>\n\n:<math> r_n(B) = \\sum_{t=0}^n (-1)^t (m-t)_{n-t} r_t(B'). </math>\n\n===Euler's phi function===\n{{main|Euler's totient function}}\n\nEuler's totient or phi function, ''\u03c6''(''n'') is an [[arithmetic function]] that counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to ''n'' that are [[relatively prime]] to ''n''. That is, if ''n'' is a [[positive integer]], then \u03c6(''n'') is the number of integers ''k'' in the range 1 \u2264 ''k'' \u2264 ''n'' which have no common factor with ''n'' other than 1. The principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion is used to obtain a formula for \u03c6(''n''). Let ''S'' be the set {1, ..., ''n''} and define the property ''P<sub>i</sub>'' to be that a number in ''S'' is divisible by the prime number ''p<sub>i</sub>'', for 1 \u2264 ''i'' \u2264 ''r'', where the [[prime factorization]] of\n\n:<math>n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}.</math>\n\nThen,<ref>{{harvnb|van Lint|Wilson|1992|loc=pg. 73}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\varphi(n) = n - \\sum_{i=1}^r \\frac{n}{p_i} + \\sum_{1 \\leqslant i < j \\leqslant r} \\frac{n}{p_i p_j} - \\cdots = n \\prod_{i=1}^r \\left (1 - \\frac{1}{p_i} \\right ).</math>\n\n==Diluted inclusion\u2013exclusion principle==\n{{See also|Bonferroni inequalities}}\n\nIn many cases where the principle could give an exact formula (in particular, counting [[prime number]]s using the [[sieve of Eratosthenes]]), the formula arising doesn't offer useful content because the number of terms in it is excessive. If each term individually can be estimated accurately, the accumulation of errors may imply that the inclusion\u2013exclusion formula isn't directly applicable. In [[number theory]], this difficulty was addressed by [[Viggo Brun]]. After a slow start, his ideas were taken up by others, and a large variety of [[sieve theory|sieve methods]] developed. These for example may try to find upper bounds for the \"sieved\" sets, rather than an exact formula.\n\nLet ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> be arbitrary sets and ''p''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> real numbers in the closed unit interval <nowiki>[</nowiki>0,1<nowiki>]</nowiki>. Then, for every even number ''k'' in {0, ..., ''n''}, the [[indicator function]]s satisfy the inequality:<ref>{{harv|Fern\u00e1ndez|Fr\u00f6hlich|Alan D.|1992|loc=Proposition&nbsp;12.6}}</ref>\n\n: <math>1_{A_1\\cup\\cdots\\cup A_n} \\ge \\sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^{j-1}\\sum_{1\\le i_1<\\cdots<i_j\\le n} p_{i_1} \\dots p_{i_j} \\, 1_{A_{i_1} \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_{i_j}}.</math>\n\n==Proof of main statement==\n\nChoose an element contained in the union of all sets and let <math>A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_t</math> be the individual sets containing it. (Note that ''t'' &gt; 0.) Since the element is counted precisely once by the left-hand side of equation ({{EquationNote|1}}), we need to show that it is counted precisely once by the right-hand side. On the right-hand side, the only non-zero contributions occur when all the subsets in a particular term contain the chosen element, that is, all the subsets are selected from <math>A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_t</math>. The contribution is one for each of these sets (plus or minus depending on the term) and  therefore is just the (signed) number of these subsets used in the term. We then have: \n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n|\\{A_i \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant t\\}| &- |\\{A_i \\cap A_j \\mid 1 \\leqslant i < j \\leqslant t\\}| + \\cdots + (-1)^{t+1}|\\{A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_t\\}| = \\binom{t}{1} - \\binom{t}{2} + \\cdots + (-1)^{t+1}\\binom{t}{t}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBy the [[binomial theorem]],\n\n:<math> 0 = (1-1)^t= \\binom{t}{0} - \\binom{t}{1} + \\binom{t}{2} - \\cdots + (-1)^t\\binom{t}{t}.</math>\n\nUsing the fact that <math>\\binom{t}{0} = 1</math> and rearranging terms, we have\n\n:<math>1 = \\binom{t}{1} - \\binom{t}{2} + \\cdots + (-1)^{t+1}\\binom{t}{t},</math>\n\nand so, the chosen element is  counted only once by the right-hand side of equation ({{EquationNote|1}}).\n\n===Algebraic proof===\nAn algebraic proof can be obtained using [[indicator function]]s (also known as characteristic functions). The indicator function of a subset ''S'' of a set ''X'' is the function <math>\\mathbf{1}_S: X \\to \\{0,1 \\}</math> given by <math>\\mathbf{1}_S(x) := \\begin{cases} 1 & x \\in S,\\\\ 0 & x \\notin S. \\end{cases}</math>\n\nIf <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> are two subsets of <math>X</math>, then \n\n:<math>\\mathbf{1}_A \\cdot\\mathbf{1}_B = \\mathbf{1}_{A\\cap B}.</math>\n\nLet ''A'' denote the union <math display=\"inline\">\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i</math> of the sets ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''A<sub>n</sub>''. To prove the inclusion\u2013exclusion principle in general, we first verify the identity\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\mathbf{1}_A  =\\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1} \\sum_{I\\subset\\{1,\\ldots,n\\} \\atop|I| = k} \\mathbf{1}_{A_I}</math>|\u2217}}\n\nfor indicator functions, where <math>A_I = \\bigcap_{i\\in I} A_i.</math>\n\nThe following function is identically zero\n\n:<math> \\left (\\mathbf{1}_A-\\mathbf{1}_{A_1} \\right ) \\left (\\mathbf{1}_A-\\mathbf{1}_{A_2} \\right )\\cdots \\left (\\mathbf{1}_A-\\mathbf{1}_{A_n} \\right ) = 0,</math>\n\nbecause: if ''x'' is not in ''A'', then all factors are 0&thinsp;\u2212&thinsp;0 = 0; and otherwise, if ''x'' does belong to some ''A<sub>m</sub>'', then the corresponding ''m''<sup>th</sup> factor is 1&thinsp;\u2212&thinsp;1&thinsp;=&thinsp;0. By expanding the product on the left-hand side, equation (\u2217) follows.\n\nTo prove the inclusion\u2013exclusion principle for the cardinality of sets, sum the equation (\u2217) over all ''x'' in the union of ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''A<sub>n</sub>''. To derive the version used in probability, take the [[expected value|expectation]] in (\u2217). In general, [[Lebesgue integral|integrate]] the equation (\u2217) with respect to&nbsp;''\u03bc''. Always use linearity in these derivations.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Combinatorial principles]]\n* [[Boole's inequality]]\n* [[Necklace problem]]\n* [[Schuette\u2013Nesbitt formula]]\n* [[Maximum-minimums identity]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation\n | last1 = Allenby  | first1 = R.B.J.T.\n | last2 = Slomson | first2 = Alan \n | title = How to Count: An Introduction to Combinatorics\n | publisher = CRC Press\n | year = 2010\n | series = Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications\n | pages = 51\u201360\n | isbn = 9781420082609\n | url = http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781420082609\n | edition = 2\n}}\n* {{Citation\n | last1=Bj\u00f6rklund | first1=A.\n | last2=Husfeldt | first2=T.\n | last3=Koivisto | first3=M.\n | journal=[[SIAM Journal on Computing]]\n | pages=546\u2013563\n | title=Set partitioning via inclusion\u2013exclusion\n | volume= 39\n | year=2009\n | doi=10.1137/070683933| issue=2\n}}\n* {{Citation|last=Brualdi|first=Richard A.|title=Introductory Combinatorics|edition=5th|publisher=Prentice\u2013Hall|year=2010|isbn=9780136020400}}\n* {{Citation|last=Cameron|first=Peter J.|title=Combinatorics: Topics, Techniques, Algorithms|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=0-521-45761-0}}\n* {{Citation\n  | last = Fern\u00e1ndez\n  | first = Roberto\n  | last2 = Fr\u00f6hlich\n  | first2 = J\u00fcrg\n  | author2-link = J\u00fcrg Fr\u00f6hlich\n  | last3 = Alan D.\n  | first3 = Sokal\n  | author3-link = Alan Sokal\n  | title = Random Walks, Critical Phenomena, and Triviality in Quantum Field Theory\n  | place = Berlin\n  | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]\n  | series = Texts an Monographs in Physics\n  | year = 1992\n  | pages = xviii+444\n  | isbn = 3-540-54358-9\n  | mr = 1219313\n  | zbl = 0761.60061}}\n* {{Citation\n | last1 = Graham  | first1 = R.L.\n | last2 =  Gr\u00f6tschel | first2 = M. | author2-link = Martin Gr\u00f6tschel\n | last3 = Lov\u00e1sz | first3 = L.\n | title = Hand Book of Combinatorics (volume-2)\n | publisher = MIT Press \u2013 North Holland\n | year = 1995\n | isbn = 9780262071710\n }}\n* {{citation|last=Gross|first=Jonathan L.|title=Combinatorial Methods with Computer Applications|publisher=Chapman&Hall/CRC|year=2008|isbn=9781584887430}}\n* {{springer|title=Inclusion-and-exclusion principle|id=p/i050430}}\n* {{citation|last=Mazur|first=David R.|title=Combinatorics A Guided Tour|publisher=The Mathematical Association of America|year=2010|isbn=9780883857625}}\n* {{citation|last1=Roberts|first1=Fred S.|last2=Tesman|first2=Barry|title=Applied Combinatorics|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=2009|isbn=9781420099829}}\n* {{citation|last=Stanley|first=Richard P.|title=Enumerative Combinatorics Volume I|publisher=Wadsworth & Brooks/Cole|year=1986|isbn=0534065465}}\n* {{citation|last1=van Lint|first1=J.H. |last2=Wilson|first2=R.M. |title=A Course in Combinatorics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year= 1992|isbn=0521422604}}\n{{PlanetMath attribution|id=2803|title=principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Inclusion-exclusion principle}}\n[[Category:Enumerative combinatorics]]\n[[Category:Probability theory]]\n[[Category:Articles containing proofs]]\n[[Category:Mathematical principles]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:\u0412\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0434\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c.svg|thumbnail|[[Venn diagram]] showing the union of sets ''A'' and ''B'' as everything not in white]]\n\nIn [[combinatorics]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the '''inclusion\u2013exclusion principle''' is a counting technique which generalizes the familiar method of obtaining the number of elements in the [[union (set theory)|union]] of two [[Finite set|finite]] [[Set (mathematics)|set]]s; symbolically expressed as\n:<math> |A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|, </math>\nwhere ''A'' and ''B'' are two finite sets and |''S''| indicates the [[cardinality]] of a set ''S'' (which may be considered as the number of elements of the set, if the set is [[Finite set|finite]]). The formula expresses the fact that the sum of the sizes of the two sets may be too large since some elements may be counted twice. The double-counted elements are those in the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the two sets and the count is corrected by subtracting the size of the intersection.\n\nThe principle is more clearly seen in the case of three sets, which for the sets ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' is given by \n:<math>|A \\cup B \\cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \\cap B| - |A \\cap C| - |B \\cap C| + |A \\cap B \\cap C|.</math>\nThis formula can be verified by counting how many times each region in the [[Venn diagram]] figure is included in the right-hand side of the formula. In this case, when removing the contributions of over-counted elements, the number of elements in the mutual intersection of the three sets has been subtracted too often, so must be added back in to get the correct total.\n\n[[Image:Inclusion-exclusion.svg|thumb|Inclusion\u2013exclusion illustrated by a Venn diagram for three sets]]\n\nGeneralizing the results of these examples gives the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion.  To find the cardinality of the union of {{mvar|n}} sets:\n\n# Include the cardinalities of the sets.\n# Exclude the cardinalities of the pairwise intersections.\n# Include the cardinalities of the triple-wise intersections.\n# Exclude the cardinalities of the quadruple-wise intersections.\n# Include the cardinalities of the quintuple-wise intersections.\n# Continue, until the cardinality of the {{mvar|n}}-tuple-wise intersection is included (if {{mvar|n}} is odd) or excluded ({{mvar|n}} even).\n\nThe name comes from the idea that the principle is based on over-generous ''inclusion'', followed by compensating ''exclusion''.\nThis concept is attributed to [[Abraham de Moivre]] (1718);<ref name=\"Roberts 2009 loc=pg. 405\">{{harvnb|Roberts|Tesman|2009|loc=pg. 405}}</ref> but it first appears in a paper of [[Daniel da Silva (mathematician)|Daniel da Silva]] (1854),<ref>{{harvnb|Mazur|2010|loc=pg. 94}}</ref> and later in a paper by [[J. J. Sylvester]] (1883).<ref>{{harvnb|van Lint|Wilson|1992|loc=pg. 77}}</ref> Sometimes the principle is referred to as the formula of Da Silva, or Sylvester due to these publications. The principle is an example of the [[Sieve theory|sieve method]] extensively used in [[number theory]] and is sometimes referred to as the ''sieve formula'',<ref>{{harvnb|van Lint|Wilson|1992|loc = pg. 77}}</ref> though Legendre already used a similar device in a sieve context in 1808.\n\nAs finite probabilities are computed as counts relative to the cardinality of the [[probability space]], the formulas for the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion remain valid when the cardinalities of the sets are replaced by finite probabilities. More generally, both versions of the principle can be put under the common umbrella of [[measure theory]].\n\nIn a very abstract setting, the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion can be expressed as the calculation of the inverse of a certain matrix.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanley|1986|loc=pg. 64}}</ref> This inverse has a special structure, making the principle an extremely valuable technique in combinatorics and related areas of mathematics. As [[Gian-Carlo Rota]] put it:<ref>{{citation|last=Rota|first=Gian-Carlo|title=On the foundations of combinatoial theory I.

This process always ends since there can be no elements that appear in more than the number of sets in the union. (For example, if <math>n = 4,</math> there can be no elements that appear in more than <math>4</math> sets; equivalently, there can be no elements that appear in at least <math>5</math> sets.)\n\nIn applications it is common to see the principle expressed in its complementary form. That is, letting {{mvar|S}} be a finite [[universal set]] containing all of the {{math|''A<sub>i</sub>''}} and letting <math>\\bar{A_i}</math> denote the complement of {{math|''A<sub>i</sub>''}} in {{mvar|S}}, by [[De Morgan's laws]] we have\n\n:<math>\\left|\\bigcap_{i=1}^n \\bar{A_i}\\right| = \\left|S - \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right| =|S| - \\sum_{i=1}^n |A_i| + \\sum_{1 \\leqslant i < j \\leqslant n} |A_i\\cap A_j| - \\cdots + (-1)^n |A_1\\cap\\cdots\\cap A_n|.</math>\n\nAs another variant of the statement, let {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''P<sub>n</sub>''}} be a list of properties that elements of a set {{mvar|S}} may or may not have, then the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion provides a way to calculate the number of elements of {{mvar|S}} which have none of the properties. Just let {{math|''A<sub>i</sub>''}} be the subset of elements of {{mvar|S}} which have the property {{math|''P<sub>i</sub>''}} and use the principle in its complementary form. This variant is due to [[J. J. Sylvester]].<ref name=\"Roberts 2009 loc=pg. 405\"/>\n\nNotice that if you take into account only the first {{math|''m<n''}} sums on the right (in the general form of the principle), then you will get an overestimate if {{math|''m''}} is odd and an underestimate if {{math|''m''}} is even.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Counting integers===\nAs a simple example of the use of the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion, consider the question:<ref>{{harvnb|Mazur|2010|loc=pp. 83\u20134, 88}}</ref>\n\n:How many integers in {1,...,100} are not divisible by 2, 3 or 5?\n\nLet ''S'' = {1,...,100} and ''P''<sub>1</sub> the property that an integer is divisible by 2, ''P''<sub>2</sub> the property that an integer is divisible by 3 and ''P''<sub>3</sub> the property that an integer is divisible by 5. Letting ''A''<sub>i</sub> be the subset of ''S'' whose elements have property ''P''<sub>i</sub> we have by elementary counting: |''A''<sub>1</sub>| = 50, |''A''<sub>2</sub>| = 33, and |''A''<sub>3</sub>| = 20. There are 16 of these integers divisible by 6, 10 divisible by 10, and 6 divisible by 15. Finally, there are just 3 integers divisible by 30, so the number of integers not divisible by any of 2, 3 or 5 is given by:\n\n:100 \u2212 (50 + 33 + 20) + (16 + 10 + 6) \u2212 3 = 26.\n\n===Counting derangements===\nA more complex example is the following.\n \nSuppose there is a deck of ''n'' cards numbered from 1&nbsp;to&nbsp;''n''.  Suppose a card numbered ''m'' is in the correct position if it is the ''m''th card in the deck. How many ways, ''W'', can the cards be shuffled with at least 1 card being in the correct position?\n\nBegin by defining set ''A''<sub>''m''</sub>, which is all of the orderings of cards with the ''m''th card correct.  Then the number of orders, ''W'', with ''at least'' one card being in the correct position, ''m'', is\n\n: <math>W = \\left|\\bigcup_{m=1}^n A_m\\right|.</math>\n\nApply the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion,\n\n: <math>W = \\sum_{m_1=1}^n |A_{m_1}| - \\sum_{1 \\leqslant m_1 < m_2 \\leqslant n} |A_{m_1} \\cap A_{m_2}| +\\cdots + (-1)^{p-1} \\sum_{1 \\leqslant m_1 < \\cdots < m_p \\leqslant n} | A_{m_1} \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_{m_p}| + \\cdots</math>\n\nEach value <math>A_{m_1} \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_{m_p}</math> represents the set of shuffles having at least ''p'' values ''m''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''m<sub>p</sub>'' in the correct position.  Note that the number of shuffles with at least ''p'' values correct only depends on ''p'', not on the particular values of <math>m</math>.  For example, the number of shuffles having the 1st, 3rd, and 17th cards in the correct position is the same as the number of shuffles having the 2nd, 5th, and 13th cards in the correct positions.  It only matters that of the ''n'' cards, 3 were chosen to be in the correct position.  Thus there are <math>{n \\choose p}</math> equal terms in the ''p''th summation (see [[combination]]).\n\n:<math>W = {n \\choose 1} |A_1| - {n \\choose 2} |A_1 \\cap A_2| + \\cdots + (-1)^{p-1} {n \\choose p} |A_1 \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_p| + \\cdots\n</math>\n\n<math>|A_1 \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_p|</math> is the number of orderings having ''p'' elements in the correct position, which is equal to the number of ways of ordering the remaining ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p'' elements, or (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p'')!. Thus we finally get:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\nW &= {n \\choose 1} (n-1)!  - {n \\choose 2} (n-2)!  + \\cdots + (-1)^{p-1} {n \\choose p} (n-p)! + \\cdots\\\\\n&= \\sum_{p=1}^n (-1)^{p-1} {n \\choose p} (n-p)!  \\\\\n&= \\sum_{p=1}^n (-1)^{p-1} \\frac{n!}{p!(n-p)!} (n-p)! \\\\\n&= \\sum_{p=1}^n (-1)^{p-1} \\frac{n!}{p!}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nA permutation where ''no'' card is in the correct position is called a [[derangement]]. Taking ''n''! to be the total number of permutations, the probability ''Q'' that a random shuffle produces a derangement is given by\n\n: <math>Q = 1 - \\frac{W}{n!} = \\sum_{p=0}^n \\frac{(-1)^p}{p!}, </math>\n\na truncation to ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 terms of the [[Taylor series|Taylor expansion]] of ''e''<sup>\u22121</sup>. Thus the probability of guessing an order for a shuffled deck of cards and being incorrect about every card is approximately ''e''<sup>\u22121</sup> or 37%.\n\n==A special case==\n\nThe situation that appears in the derangement example above occurs often enough to merit special attention.<ref>{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|loc=pp. 167\u20138}}</ref> Namely, when the size of the intersection sets appearing in the formulas for the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion depend only on the number of sets in the intersections and not on which sets appear.

A generalization of this concept would calculate the number of elements of ''S'' which appear in exactly some fixed ''m'' of these sets.\n\nLet ''N'' = <nowiki>[</nowiki>''n''<nowiki>]</nowiki> = {1,2,...,''n''}. If we define <math>A_{\\emptyset} = S</math>, then the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion can be written as, using the notation of the previous section; the number of elements of ''S'' contained in none of the ''A''<sub>i</sub> is:\n::<math> \\sum_{J \\subseteq [n]} (-1)^{|J|} |A_J|.</math>\n\nIf ''I'' is a fixed subset of the index set ''N'', then the number of elements which belong to ''A''<sub>i</sub> for all ''i'' in ''I'' and for no other values is:<ref>{{harvnb|Cameron|1994|loc=pg. 78}}</ref>\n:<math> \\sum_{I \\subseteq J} (-1)^{|J| - |I|} |A_J|.</math>\nDefine the sets\n\n:<math>B_k = A_{I \\cup \\{ k \\}} \\text{ for } k \\in N \\setminus I.</math>\n\nWe seek the number of elements in none of the ''B''<sub>k</sub> which, by the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion (with <math>B_\\emptyset = A_I</math>), is\n\n:<math>\\sum_{K \\subseteq N \\setminus I} (-1)^{|K|}|B_K|.</math>\n\nThe correspondence ''K'' \u2194 ''J'' = ''I'' \u222a ''K'' between subsets of ''N''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;''I'' and subsets of ''N'' containing ''I'' is a bijection and if ''J'' and ''K'' correspond under this map then ''B''<sub>K</sub> = ''A''<sub>J</sub>, showing that the result is valid.\n\n==In probability==\n\nIn [[probability]], for events ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> in a [[probability space]] <math>\\scriptstyle(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},\\mathbb{P})</math>, the inclusion\u2013exclusion principle becomes for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{P}(A_1\\cup A_2)=\\mathbb{P}(A_1)+\\mathbb{P}(A_2)-\\mathbb{P}(A_1\\cap A_2),</math>\n\nfor ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{P}(A_1\\cup A_2\\cup A_3)=\\mathbb{P}(A_1)+\\mathbb{P}(A_2)+\\mathbb{P}(A_3)-\\mathbb{P}(A_1\\cap A_2)-\\mathbb{P}(A_1\\cap A_3)-\\mathbb{P}(A_2\\cap A_3)+\\mathbb{P}(A_1\\cap A_2\\cap A_3)</math>\n\nand in general\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{P}(A_i) -\\sum_{i<j}\\mathbb{P}(A_i\\cap A_j)+\\sum_{i<j<k}\\mathbb{P}(A_i\\cap A_j\\cap A_k) + \\cdots +(-1)^{n-1} \\sum_{i<...<n}\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i\\right),</math>\n\nwhich can be written in closed form as\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\\right)=\\sum_{k=1}^n \\left((-1)^{k-1}\\sum_{I\\subseteq\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\atop |I|=k} \\mathbb{P}(A_I)\\right),</math>\n\nwhere the last sum runs over all subsets ''I'' of the indices 1, ..., ''n'' which contain exactly ''k'' elements, and\n\n:<math>A_I:=\\bigcap_{i\\in I} A_i</math>\n\ndenotes the intersection of all those ''A<sub>i</sub>'' with index in ''I''.\n\nAccording to the [[Boole's inequality#Bonferroni inequalities|Bonferroni inequalities]], the sum of the first terms in the formula is alternately an upper bound and a lower bound for the [[Sides of an equation|LHS]]. This can be used in cases where the full formula is too cumbersome.\n\nFor a general [[measure space]] (''S'',\u03a3,''\u03bc'') and [[measurable]] subsets ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> of finite measure, the above identities also hold when the probability measure <math>\\mathbb{P}</math> is replaced by the measure ''\u03bc''.\n\n===Special case===\n\nIf, in the probabilistic version of the inclusion\u2013exclusion principle, the probability of the intersection ''A''<sub>''I''</sub> only depends on the cardinality of ''I'', meaning that for every ''k'' in {1,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''n''} there is an ''a<sub>k</sub>'' such that\n\n:<math>a_k=\\mathbb{P}(A_I) \\text{ for every } I\\subset\\{1,\\ldots,n\\} \\text{ with } |I|=k,</math>\n\nthen the above formula simplifies to\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\\right) =\\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1}\\binom n k a_k </math>\n\ndue to the combinatorial interpretation of the [[binomial coefficient]] <math>\\scriptstyle\\binom nk</math>. For example, if the events <math>A_i</math> are [[independent and identically distributed]], then <math>\\mathbb{P}(A_i) = p</math> for all ''i'', and we have <math>a_k = p^k</math>, in which case the expression above simplifies to\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\\right) = 1 - (1-p)^n. </math>\n\n(This result can also be derived more simply by considering the intersection of the complements of the events <math>A_i</math>.)\n\nAn analogous simplification is possible in the case of a general measure space (''S'',\u03a3,''\u03bc'') and measurable subsets ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> of finite measure.\n\n==Other forms==\n\nThe principle is sometimes stated in the form<ref>{{harvnb|Graham| Gr\u00f6tschel|Lov\u00e1sz|1995|loc=pg. 1049}}</ref> that says that if\n\n:<math>g(A)=\\sum_{S \\subseteq A}f(S)</math>\n\nthen\n\n:<math>f(A)=\\sum_{S \\subseteq A}(-1)^{|A|-|S|}g(S) \\qquad (**)</math>\n\nThe combinatorial and the probabilistic version of the inclusion\u2013exclusion principle are instances of (**).\n{{collapse top|title=Proof}}\nTake <math>\\underline{m} = \\{1,2,\\ldots,m\\}</math>, <math>f(\\underline{m}) = 0</math>, and\n\n:<math>f(S)=\\left|\\bigcap_{i \\in \\underline{m} \\setminus S} A_i \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in S} A_i\\right| \\text{ and } f(S) = \\mathbb{P} \\left(\\bigcap_{i \\in \\underline{m} \\setminus S} A_i \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in S} A_i\\right)</math>\n\nrespectively for all [[set (mathematics)|sets]] <math>S</math> with <math>S \\subsetneq \\underline{m}</math>.

This gives the desired result.\n{{collapse bottom}}\n\n==Applications==\n\nThe inclusion\u2013exclusion principle is widely used and only a few of its applications can be mentioned here.\n\n===Counting derangements===\n\n{{main|Derangement}}\n\nA well-known application of the inclusion\u2013exclusion principle is to the combinatorial problem of counting all [[derangement]]s of a finite set. A ''derangement'' of a set ''A'' is a [[bijection]] from ''A'' into itself that has no fixed points. Via the inclusion\u2013exclusion principle one can show that if the cardinality of ''A'' is ''n'', then the number of derangements is [''n''!&nbsp;/&nbsp;''e''] where [''x''] denotes the [[nearest integer function|nearest integer]] to ''x''; a detailed proof is available [[Random permutation statistics#Number of permutations that are derangements|here]] and also see [[#Examples|the examples section]] above.\n\nThe first occurrence of the problem of counting the number of derangements is in an early book on games of chance: ''Essai d'analyse sur les jeux de hazard'' by P. R. de Montmort (1678 &ndash; 1719) and was known as either \"Montmort's problem\" or by the name he gave it, \"''probl\u00e8me des rencontres''.\"<ref>{{harvnb|van Lint|Wilson|1992|loc=pp. 77-8}}</ref> The problem is also known as the ''hatcheck problem.''\n\nThe number of derangements is also known as the [[subfactorial]] of ''n'', written !''n''. It follows that if all bijections are assigned the same probability then the probability that a random bijection is a derangement quickly approaches 1/''e'' as ''n'' grows.\n\n===Counting intersections===\nThe principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion, combined with [[De Morgan's law]], can be used to count the cardinality of the intersection of sets as well. Let <math>\\overline{A_k}</math> represent the complement of ''A<sub>k</sub>'' with respect to some universal set ''A'' such that <math>A_k \\subseteq A</math> for each ''k''. Then we have\n\n:<math>\\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i = \\overline{\\bigcup_{i=1}^n \\overline{A_i}}</math>\n\nthereby turning the problem of finding an intersection into the problem of finding a union.\n\n===Graph coloring===\nThe inclusion exclusion principle forms the basis of algorithms for a number of NP-hard graph partitioning problems, such as graph coloring.<ref name=\"bhk\">{{harvnb|Bj\u00f6rklund|Husfeldt|Koivisto|2009}}</ref>\n\nA well known application of the principle is the construction of the [[chromatic polynomial]] of a graph.<ref>{{harvnb|Gross|2008|loc=pp. 211\u201313}}</ref>\n\n===Bipartite graph perfect matchings===\nThe number of [[perfect matching]]s of a [[bipartite graph]] can be calculated using the principle.<ref>{{harvnb|Gross|2008|loc=pp. 208\u201310}}</ref>\n\n===Number of onto functions===\nGiven finite sets ''A'' and ''B'', how many [[surjective function]]s (onto functions) are there from ''A'' to ''B''? [[Without any loss of generality]] we may take ''A'' = {1, ..., ''k''} and ''B'' = {1, ..., ''n''}, since only the cardinalities of the sets matter. By using ''S'' as the set of all [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] from ''A'' to ''B'', and defining, for each ''i'' in ''B'', the property ''P<sub>i</sub>'' as \"the function misses the element ''i'' in ''B''\" (''i'' is not in the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of the function), the principle of inclusion&ndash;exclusion gives the number of onto functions between ''A'' and ''B'' as:<ref>{{harvnb|Mazur|2008|loc=pp.84-5, 90}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\sum_{j=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{j} (-1)^j (n-j)^k.</math>\n\n===Permutations with forbidden positions===\nA [[permutation]] of the set ''S'' = {1, ..., ''n''} where each element of ''S'' is restricted to not being in certain positions (here the permutation is considered as an ordering of the elements of ''S'') is called a ''permutation with forbidden positions''. For example, with ''S'' = {1,2,3,4}, the permutations with the restriction that the element 1 can not be in positions 1 or 3, and the element 2 can not be in position 4 are: 2134, 2143, 3124, 4123, 2341, 2431, 3241, 3421, 4231 and 4321. By letting ''A<sub>i</sub>'' be the set of positions that the element ''i'' is not allowed to be in, and the property ''P''<sub>''i''</sub> to be the property that a permutation puts element ''i'' into a position in ''A<sub>i</sub>'', the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion can be used to count the number of permutations which satisfy all the restrictions.<ref>{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|loc=pp. 177&ndash;81}}</ref>\n\nIn the given example, there are 12 = 2(3!) permutations with property ''P''<sub>1</sub>, 6 = 3! permutations with property ''P''<sub>2</sub> and no permutations have properties ''P''<sub>3</sub> or ''P''<sub>4</sub> as there are no restrictions for these two elements. The number of permutations satisfying the restrictions is thus:\n\n:4! \u2212 (12 + 6 + 0 + 0) + (4) = 24 \u2212 18 + 4 = 10.\n\nThe final 4 in this computation is the number of permutations having both properties ''P''<sub>1</sub> and ''P''<sub>2</sub>. There are no other non-zero contributions to the formula.\n\n===Stirling numbers of the second kind===\n{{main|Stirling numbers of the second kind}}\n\nThe [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]], ''S''(''n'',''k'') count the number of [[Partition of a set|partitions]] of a set of ''n'' elements into ''k'' non-empty subsets (indistinguishable ''boxes''). An explicit formula for them can be obtained by applying the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion to a very closely related problem, namely, counting the number of partitions of an ''n''-set into ''k'' non-empty but distinguishable boxes ([[Ordered set|ordered]] non-empty subsets). Using the universal set consisting of all partitions of the ''n''-set into ''k'' (possibly empty) distinguishable boxes, ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''A<sub>k</sub>'', and the properties ''P<sub>i</sub>'' meaning that the partition has box ''A<sub>i</sub>'' empty, the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion gives an answer for the related result. Dividing by ''k''! to remove the artificial ordering gives the Stirling number of the second kind:<ref>{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|loc=pp. 282&ndash;7}}</ref>\n\n:<math>S(n,k) = \\frac{1}{k!}\\sum_{t=0}^k (-1)^t \\binom k t (k-t)^n.</math>\n\n===Rook polynomials===\n{{main|Rook polynomial}}\n\nA rook polynomial is the [[generating polynomial|generating function]] of the number of ways to place non-attacking [[rook (chess)|rooks]] on a ''board B'' that looks like a subset of the squares of a [[checkerboard]]; that is, no two rooks may be in the same row or column. The board ''B'' is any subset of the squares of a rectangular board with ''n'' rows and ''m'' columns; we think of it as the squares in which one is allowed to put a rook. The [[coefficient]], ''r<sub>k</sub>''(''B'') of ''x<sup>k</sup>'' in the rook polynomial ''R<sub>B</sub>''(''x'') is the number of ways ''k'' rooks, none of which attacks another, can be arranged in the squares of ''B''. For any board ''B'', there is a complementary board <math>B'</math> consisting of the squares of the rectangular board that are not in ''B''. This complementary board also has a rook polynomial <math>R_{B'}(x)</math> with coefficients <math>r_k(B').</math>\n\nIt is sometimes convenient to be able to calculate the highest coefficient of a rook polynomial in terms of the coefficients of the rook polynomial of the complementary board. Without loss of generality we can assume that ''n'' \u2264 ''m'', so this coefficient is ''r<sub>n</sub>''(''B''). The number of ways to place ''n'' non-attacking rooks on the complete ''n'' \u00d7 ''m'' \"checkerboard\" (without regard as to whether the rooks are placed in the squares of the board ''B'') is given by the [[falling factorial]]:\n\n:<math>(m)_n = m(m-1)(m-2) \\cdots (m-n+1).</math>\n\nLetting ''P''<sub>i</sub> be the property that an assignment of ''n'' non-attacking rooks on the complete board has a rook in column ''i'' which is not in a square of the board ''B'', then by the principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion we have:<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|Tesman|2009|loc=pp.419&ndash;20}}</ref>\n\n:<math> r_n(B) = \\sum_{t=0}^n (-1)^t (m-t)_{n-t} r_t(B'). </math>\n\n===Euler's phi function===\n{{main|Euler's totient function}}\n\nEuler's totient or phi function, ''\u03c6''(''n'') is an [[arithmetic function]] that counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to ''n'' that are [[relatively prime]] to ''n''. That is, if ''n'' is a [[positive integer]], then \u03c6(''n'') is the number of integers ''k'' in the range 1 \u2264 ''k'' \u2264 ''n'' which have no common factor with ''n'' other than 1. The principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion is used to obtain a formula for \u03c6(''n''). Let ''S'' be the set {1, ..., ''n''} and define the property ''P<sub>i</sub>'' to be that a number in ''S'' is divisible by the prime number ''p<sub>i</sub>'', for 1 \u2264 ''i'' \u2264 ''r'', where the [[prime factorization]] of\n\n:<math>n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}.</math>\n\nThen,<ref>{{harvnb|van Lint|Wilson|1992|loc=pg. 73}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\varphi(n) = n - \\sum_{i=1}^r \\frac{n}{p_i} + \\sum_{1 \\leqslant i < j \\leqslant r} \\frac{n}{p_i p_j} - \\cdots = n \\prod_{i=1}^r \\left (1 - \\frac{1}{p_i} \\right ).</math>\n\n==Diluted inclusion\u2013exclusion principle==\n{{See also|Bonferroni inequalities}}\n\nIn many cases where the principle could give an exact formula (in particular, counting [[prime number]]s using the [[sieve of Eratosthenes]]), the formula arising doesn't offer useful content because the number of terms in it is excessive. If each term individually can be estimated accurately, the accumulation of errors may imply that the inclusion\u2013exclusion formula isn't directly applicable. In [[number theory]], this difficulty was addressed by [[Viggo Brun]]. After a slow start, his ideas were taken up by others, and a large variety of [[sieve theory|sieve methods]] developed. These for example may try to find upper bounds for the \"sieved\" sets, rather than an exact formula.\n\nLet ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> be arbitrary sets and ''p''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> real numbers in the closed unit interval <nowiki>[</nowiki>0,1<nowiki>]</nowiki>. Then, for every even number ''k'' in {0, ..., ''n''}, the [[indicator function]]s satisfy the inequality:<ref>{{harv|Fern\u00e1ndez|Fr\u00f6hlich|Alan D.|1992|loc=Proposition&nbsp;12.6}}</ref>\n\n: <math>1_{A_1\\cup\\cdots\\cup A_n} \\ge \\sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^{j-1}\\sum_{1\\le i_1<\\cdots<i_j\\le n} p_{i_1} \\dots p_{i_j} \\, 1_{A_{i_1} \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_{i_j}}.</math>\n\n==Proof of main statement==\n\nChoose an element contained in the union of all sets and let <math>A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_t</math> be the individual sets containing it. (Note that ''t'' &gt; 0.) Since the element is counted precisely once by the left-hand side of equation ({{EquationNote|1}}), we need to show that it is counted precisely once by the right-hand side. On the right-hand side, the only non-zero contributions occur when all the subsets in a particular term contain the chosen element, that is, all the subsets are selected from <math>A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_t</math>. The contribution is one for each of these sets (plus or minus depending on the term) and  therefore is just the (signed) number of these subsets used in the term. We then have: \n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n|\\{A_i \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant t\\}| &- |\\{A_i \\cap A_j \\mid 1 \\leqslant i < j \\leqslant t\\}| + \\cdots + (-1)^{t+1}|\\{A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_t\\}| = \\binom{t}{1} - \\binom{t}{2} + \\cdots + (-1)^{t+1}\\binom{t}{t}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBy the [[binomial theorem]],\n\n:<math> 0 = (1-1)^t= \\binom{t}{0} - \\binom{t}{1} + \\binom{t}{2} - \\cdots + (-1)^t\\binom{t}{t}.</math>\n\nUsing the fact that <math>\\binom{t}{0} = 1</math> and rearranging terms, we have\n\n:<math>1 = \\binom{t}{1} - \\binom{t}{2} + \\cdots + (-1)^{t+1}\\binom{t}{t},</math>\n\nand so, the chosen element is  counted only once by the right-hand side of equation ({{EquationNote|1}}).\n\n===Algebraic proof===\nAn algebraic proof can be obtained using [[indicator function]]s (characteristic functions of subsets of a set). The indicator function of a subset ''S'' of a set ''X'' is a function\n\n:<math>\\begin{cases} \\mathbf{1}_S : X \\to \\{0,1 \\} \\\\ \\mathbf{1}_S(x) := \\begin{cases} 1 & x \\in S \\\\ 0 & x \\notin S \\end{cases} \\end{cases}</math>\n\nIf <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> are two subsets of <math>X</math>, then \n\n:<math>\\mathbf{1}_A \\cdot\\mathbf{1}_B = \\mathbf{1}_{A\\cap B}.</math>\n\nLet ''A'' denote the union <math display=\"inline\">\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i</math> of the sets ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''A<sub>n</sub>''. To prove the inclusion\u2013exclusion principle in general, we first verify the identity\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\mathbf{1}_A  =\\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1} \\sum_{I\\subset\\{1,\\ldots,n\\} \\atop|I| = k} \\mathbf{1}_{A_I}</math>|\u2217}}\n\nfor indicator functions, where\n\n:<math>A_I = \\bigcap_{i\\in I} A_i.</math>\n\nThe following function is identically zero\n\n:<math> \\left (\\mathbf{1}_A-\\mathbf{1}_{A_1} \\right ) \\left (\\mathbf{1}_A-\\mathbf{1}_{A_2} \\right )\\cdots \\left (\\mathbf{1}_A-\\mathbf{1}_{A_n} \\right ) = 0,</math>\n\nbecause: if ''x'' is not in ''A'', then all factors are 0&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;0 = 0; and otherwise, if ''x'' does belong to some  ''A<sub>m</sub>'', then the corresponding ''m''th factor is&nbsp;1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. By expanding the product on the left-hand side, equation (\u2217) follows.\n\nTo prove the inclusion\u2013exclusion principle for the cardinality of sets, sum the equation (\u2217) over all ''x'' in the union of ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''A<sub>n</sub>''. To derive the version used in probability, take the [[expected value|expectation]] in (\u2217). In general, [[Lebesgue integral|integrate]] the equation (\u2217) with respect to&nbsp;''\u03bc''. Always use linearity in these derivations.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Combinatorial principles]]\n* [[Boole's inequality]]\n* [[Necklace problem]]\n* [[Schuette\u2013Nesbitt formula]]\n* [[Maximum-minimums identity]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation\n | last1 = Allenby  | first1 = R.B.J.T.\n | last2 = Slomson | first2 = Alan \n | title = How to Count: An Introduction to Combinatorics\n | publisher = CRC Press\n | year = 2010\n | series = Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications\n | pages = 51\u201360\n | isbn = 9781420082609\n | url = http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781420082609\n | edition = 2\n}}\n* {{Citation\n | last1=Bj\u00f6rklund | first1=A.\n | last2=Husfeldt | first2=T.\n | last3=Koivisto | first3=M.\n | journal=[[SIAM Journal on Computing]]\n | pages=546\u2013563\n | title=Set partitioning via inclusion\u2013exclusion\n | volume= 39\n | year=2009\n | doi=10.1137/070683933| issue=2\n}}\n* {{Citation|last=Brualdi|first=Richard A.|title=Introductory Combinatorics|edition=5th|publisher=Prentice\u2013Hall|year=2010|isbn=9780136020400}}\n* {{Citation|last=Cameron|first=Peter J.|title=Combinatorics: Topics, Techniques, Algorithms|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=0-521-45761-0}}\n* {{Citation\n  | last = Fern\u00e1ndez\n  | first = Roberto\n  | last2 = Fr\u00f6hlich\n  | first2 = J\u00fcrg\n  | author2-link = J\u00fcrg Fr\u00f6hlich\n  | last3 = Alan D.\n  | first3 = Sokal\n  | author3-link = Alan Sokal\n  | title = Random Walks, Critical Phenomena, and Triviality in Quantum Field Theory\n  | place = Berlin\n  | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]\n  | series = Texts an Monographs in Physics\n  | year = 1992\n  | pages = xviii+444\n  | isbn = 3-540-54358-9\n  | mr = 1219313\n  | zbl = 0761.60061}}\n* {{Citation\n | last1 = Graham  | first1 = R.L.\n | last2 =  Gr\u00f6tschel | first2 = M. | author2-link = Martin Gr\u00f6tschel\n | last3 = Lov\u00e1sz | first3 = L.\n | title = Hand Book of Combinatorics (volume-2)\n | publisher = MIT Press \u2013 North Holland\n | year = 1995\n | isbn = 9780262071710\n }}\n* {{citation|last=Gross|first=Jonathan L.|title=Combinatorial Methods with Computer Applications|publisher=Chapman&Hall/CRC|year=2008|isbn=9781584887430}}\n* {{springer|title=Inclusion-and-exclusion principle|id=p/i050430}}\n* {{citation|last=Mazur|first=David R.|title=Combinatorics A Guided Tour|publisher=The Mathematical Association of America|year=2010|isbn=9780883857625}}\n* {{citation|last1=Roberts|first1=Fred S.|last2=Tesman|first2=Barry|title=Applied Combinatorics|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=2009|isbn=9781420099829}}\n* {{citation|last=Stanley|first=Richard P.|title=Enumerative Combinatorics Volume I|publisher=Wadsworth & Brooks/Cole|year=1986|isbn=0534065465}}\n* {{citation|last1=van Lint|first1=J.H. |last2=Wilson|first2=R.M. |title=A Course in Combinatorics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year= 1992|isbn=0521422604}}\n{{PlanetMath attribution|id=2803|title=principle of inclusion\u2013exclusion}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Inclusion-exclusion principle}}\n[[Category:Enumerative combinatorics]]\n[[Category:Probability theory]]\n[[Category:Articles containing proofs]]\n[[Category:Mathematical principles]]\n", "name_user": "Joel Brennan", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAlgebraic proof:piecewise notation for domain, codomain, and rule of a functions is ugly", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion%E2%80%93exclusion_principle"}

First UK pressings were on translucent yellow vinyl and some European pressings were also available on blue vinyl. Though it was rumoured {{cn|date=February 2019}}at the time that this would be his final outing with the label, following dissatisfaction over the promotion of ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' and ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'', Bowie remained with RCA until 1982.\n\n==Recording==\nThe recording was culled from concerts in [[Philadelphia]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] and [[Boston]], US, in late April and early May 1978. It primarily included material from Bowie's most recent studio albums to that date, ''[[Station to Station]]'', ''Low'' and ''\"Heroes\"'' but also five songs from ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. Aside from Bowie's core team of [[Carlos Alomar]], [[Dennis Davis]] and [[George Murray (musician)|George Murray]], band members included ex-[[Frank Zappa]] sideman [[Adrian Belew]] on guitar, [[Simon House]] from [[Hawkwind]] on electric violin, [[Roger Powell (musician)|Roger Powell]], best known for his work with [[Todd Rundgren]] in the group [[Utopia (band)|Utopia]], on keyboards and [[Sean Mayes]] on piano, string ensemble and backup vocals. All would reunite the following year on Bowie's next studio LP, ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]''.\n\nAs Bowie rarely tampered with the arrangements \u2013 in contrast to his method on ''David Live'' \u2013 ''Stage'' added little to what was available on the original albums, and was seen by some commentators as simply a marketing exercise that did not do justice to a memorable series of live concerts. Even the cover picture came in for criticism, more so because the rest of the package contained only variations of the same shot.\n\n==Reception==\n''Stage'' was a commercial success. In the UK, it reached No. 5 and was subsequently certified gold by the [[British Phonographic Industry|British Phonographic Industry (BPI)]]. It also reached No. 44 on the US charts.\n\n\"[[Breaking Glass (song)|Breaking Glass]]\", which originally appeared in shorter form on ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'', was released as a 3-track [[Extended play|EP]] and reached number 54 on the UK singles chart. In the US, \"[[Star (David Bowie song)|Star]]\" was released as a 3-track EP, but failed to chart. In Japan \"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\" was released, with \"Blackout\" on the B-side, but also failed to chart.\n\nGenerally considered more relaxed than Bowie's previous live album, ''[[David Live]]'', ''Stage'' was praised on its initial vinyl release for the fidelity with which the band was able to emulate in concert the electronic and effects-filled numbers from ''Low'' and ''\"Heroes\"'', as well as for the singer's vocal performance. However, it was criticised for lacking a 'live' atmosphere, thanks to the recording being largely taken from direct instrument and microphone feeds which increased sound quality but minimised crowd noise. The original concert running order was also changed, with fades between tracks similar to a studio album. In a review of the 1991 rerelease, Mat Snow of ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' stated that \"performances are faster than the studio originals and suffer for it; what they gain in live jauntiness \u2013 not exactly a quality they were crying out for \u2013 they lose in power and intensity.\"<ref>Snow, Mat (March 1992), [[Q (magazine)|Q]]</ref>\n\nA 2005 reissue saw many of the criticisms of the original LP addressed. In his review of the reissue, Chris Roberts of ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' said that the combination of ''Low''/''Heroes''-period material and songs from ''Ziggy Stardust'' resulted in a live album that was an \"eerie clattering between two stools\". He said that the improvements in sound carried out by [[Tony Visconti]] and the addition of \"Stay\" and \"the brilliant 'Be My Wife'\" made the new version of ''Stage'' \"essential for Dave-freaks, anyway\".<ref name=\"Roberts/Uncut\" />\n\nThe album is included in [[The Quietus]]' list of its writers' \"40 Favourite Live Albums\".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Quietus Writers' 40 Favourite Live Albums |author=John Doran |date=5 February 2013 |website=The Quietus |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/11293-best-live-albums}}</ref>\n\n==Track listings==\nAll tracks written by [[David Bowie]], except where noted.\n\n===Original 1978 LP===\n\n{{tracklist\n| all_writing     = \n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        =Side one\n| total_length    = 16:22\n| title1          = [[Hang On to Yourself]]\n| length1         = 3:26\n| title2          = [[Ziggy Stardust (song)|Ziggy Stardust]]\n| length2         = 3:32\n| title3          = [[Five Years (David Bowie song)|Five Years]]\n| length3         = 3:58\n| title4          = [[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\n| length4         = 2:55\n| title5          = Star\n| length5         = 2:31\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n| all_writing     = \n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        =Side two\n| total_length    = 17:38\n| title1          = [[Station to Station (song)|Station to Station]]\n| length1         = 8:55\n| title2          = [[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]\n| note2           = Bowie, [[Carlos Alomar]], [[John Lennon]]\n| length2         = 4:06\n| title3          = [[TVC 15]]\n| length3         = 4:37\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n| all_writing     = \n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        =Side three\n| total_length    = 19:25\n| title1          = [[Warszawa (song)|Warszawa]]\n| note1           = Bowie, [[Brian Eno]]\n| length1         = 6:50\n| title2         = [[Speed of Life (David Bowie song)|Speed of Life]]\n| length2        = 2:44\n| title3         = [[Art Decade]]\n| length3        = 3:10\n| title4         = [[Sense of Doubt]]\n| length4        = 3:13\n| title5         = [[Breaking Glass (song)|Breaking Glass]]\n| note5          = Bowie, [[Dennis Davis]], [[George Murray (musician)|George Murray]]\n| length5        = 3:28\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n| all_writing     = \n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        =Side four\n| total_length    = 19:52 (73:17)\n| title1         = [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie song)|\"Heroes\"]]\n| note1          = Bowie, Eno\n| length1        = 6:19\n| title2         = [[What in the World]]\n| length2        = 4:24\n| title3         = [[Blackout (David Bowie song)|Blackout]]\n| length3        = 4:01\n| title4         = [[Beauty and the Beast (David Bowie song)|Beauty and the Beast]]\n| length4        = 5:08\n}}\nThe cassette release places \"[[Speed of Life (David Bowie song)|Speed of Life]]\" between \"Fame\" and \"TVC 15\".\n\n===Rereleases===\n''Stage'' has been rereleased on CD four times to date, the first being in 1984 by [[RCA Records]], then in 1991 by [[Rykodisc]] (containing a bonus track), later in 2005 by [[EMI]], and most recently in 2017 by [[Parlophone]] (also on vinyl). The running order of the 2005 and 2017 editions reflects the actual performance, removing fades between tracks, and including previously unreleased performances as bonus tracks.\n\nThe 2005 [[EMI]] release of this album was [[Copy protection|copy protected]] with [[Cactus Data Shield|CDS 200]] in the EU.\n\n====1984 rerelease====\nThe 1984 rerelease on CD (catalogue number PD89002) contains the same running order as the original LP, and comes on two discs (despite the double-LP release being short enough to fit on a single CD unaltered). Some of the European-distributed CDs were manufactured in Japan, but cover and assembling were made in Europe. Most of the CDs were made in Germany.\n\n====1991 rerelease track listing====\n\nIn 1991, Stage was rereleased on CD, with the same running order as the original LP, with \"[[Alabama Song#David Bowie version|Alabama Song]]\" included as a bonus track.\n{{tracklist\n| all_writing     = \n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        =CD one\n| total_length    = 34:00\n| title1          = Hang On to Yourself\n| length1         = 3:26\n| title2          = Ziggy Stardust\n| length2         = 3:32\n| title3          = Five Years\n| length3         = 3:58\n| title4          = Soul Love\n| length4         = 2:55\n| title5          = Star\n| length5         = 2:31\n| title6          = Station to Station\n| length6         = 8:55\n| title7          = Fame\n| writer7         = Bowie, Alomar, Lennon\n| length7         = 4:06\n| title8          = TVC 15\n| length8         = 4:37\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n| all_writing     = \n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        =CD two\n| total_length    = 43:17 (77:17)\n| title1          = Warszawa\n| writer1         = Bowie, Eno\n| length1         = 6:50\n| title2         = Speed of Life\n| length2        = 2:44\n| title3         = Art Decade\n| length3        = 3:10\n| title4         = Sense of Doubt\n| length4        = 3:13\n| title5         = Breaking Glass\n| writer5        = Bowie, Davis, Murray\n| length5        = 3:28\n| title6         = \"Heroes\"\n| writer6        = Bowie, Eno\n| length6        = 6:19\n| title7         = What in the World\n| length7        = 4:24\n| title8         = Blackout\n| length8        = 4:01\n| title9         = Beauty and the Beast\n| length9        = 5:08\n| title10         = [[Alabama Song#David Bowie version|Alabama Song]]\n| note10          = Bonus Track\n| writer10        = [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Kurt Weill]]\n| length10        = 4:00\n}}\n\n====2005 rerelease track listing====\n\nThe 2005 CD reissue features a new running order, reflecting the original setlist of the concerts as performed.

First UK pressings were on translucent yellow vinyl and some European pressings were also available on blue vinyl. Though it was rumoured {{cn|date=February 2019}}at the time that this would be his final outing with the label, following dissatisfaction over the promotion of ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' and ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'', Bowie remained with RCA until 1982.\n\n==Recording==\nThe recording was culled from concerts in [[Philadelphia]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] and [[Boston]], US, in late April and early May 1978. It primarily included material from Bowie's most recent studio albums to that date, ''[[Station to Station]]'', ''Low'' and ''\"Heroes\"'' but also five songs from ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. Aside from Bowie's core team of [[Carlos Alomar]], [[Dennis Davis]] and [[George Murray (musician)|George Murray]], band members included ex-[[Frank Zappa]] sideman [[Adrian Belew]] on guitar, [[Simon House]] from [[Hawkwind]] on electric violin, [[Roger Powell (musician)|Roger Powell]], best known for his work with [[Todd Rundgren]] in the group [[Utopia (band)|Utopia]], on keyboards and [[Sean Mayes]] on piano, string ensemble and backup vocals. All would reunite the following year on Bowie's next studio LP, ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]''.\n\nAs Bowie rarely tampered with the arrangements \u2013 in contrast to his method on ''David Live'' \u2013 ''Stage'' added little to what was available on the original albums, and was seen by some commentators as simply a marketing exercise that did not do justice to a memorable series of live concerts. Even the cover picture came in for criticism, more so because the rest of the package contained only variations of the same shot.\n\n==Reception==\n''Stage'' was a commercial success. In the UK, it reached No. 5 and was subsequently certified gold by the [[British Phonographic Industry|British Phonographic Industry (BPI)]]. It also reached No. 44 on the US charts.\n\n\"[[Breaking Glass (song)|Breaking Glass]]\", which originally appeared in shorter form on ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'', was released as a 3-track [[Extended play|EP]] and reached number 54 on the UK singles chart. In the US, \"[[Star (David Bowie song)|Star]]\" was released as a 3-track EP, but failed to chart. In Japan \"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\" was released, with \"Blackout\" on the B-side, but also failed to chart.\n\nGenerally considered more relaxed than Bowie's previous live album, ''[[David Live]]'', ''Stage'' was praised on its initial vinyl release for the fidelity with which the band was able to emulate in concert the electronic and effects-filled numbers from ''Low'' and ''\"Heroes\"'', as well as for the singer's vocal performance. However, it was criticised for lacking a 'live' atmosphere, thanks to the recording being largely taken from direct instrument and microphone feeds which increased sound quality but minimised crowd noise. The original concert running order was also changed, with fades between tracks similar to a studio album. In a review of the 1991 rerelease, Mat Snow of ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' stated that \"performances are faster than the studio originals and suffer for it; what they gain in live jauntiness \u2013 not exactly a quality they were crying out for \u2013 they lose in power and intensity.\"<ref>Snow, Mat (March 1992), [[Q (magazine)|Q]]</ref>\n\nA 2005 reissue saw many of the criticisms of the original LP addressed. In his review of the reissue, Chris Roberts of ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' said that the combination of ''Low''/''Heroes''-period material and songs from ''Ziggy Stardust'' resulted in a live album that was an \"eerie clattering between two stools\". He said that the improvements in sound carried out by [[Tony Visconti]] and the addition of \"Stay\" and \"the brilliant 'Be My Wife'\" made the new version of ''Stage'' \"essential for Dave-freaks, anyway\".<ref name=\"Roberts/Uncut\" />\n\nThe album is included in [[The Quietus]]' list of its writers' \"40 Favourite Live Albums\".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Quietus Writers' 40 Favourite Live Albums |author=John Doran |date=5 February 2013 |website=The Quietus |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/11293-best-live-albums}}</ref>\n\n==Track listings==\nAll tracks written by [[David Bowie]], except where noted.\n\n===Original 1978 LP===\n\n{{tracklist\n| all_writing     = \n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        =Side one\n| total_length    = 16:22\n| title1          = [[Hang On to Yourself]]\n| length1         = 3:26\n| title2          = [[Ziggy Stardust (song)|Ziggy Stardust]]\n| length2         = 3:32\n| title3          = [[Five Years (David Bowie song)|Five Years]]\n| length3         = 3:58\n| title4          = [[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\n| length4         = 2:55\n| title5          = Star\n| length5         = 2:31\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n| all_writing     = \n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        =Side two\n| total_length    = 17:38\n| title1          = [[Station to Station (song)|Station to Station]]\n| length1         = 8:55\n| title2          = [[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]\n| note2           = Bowie, [[Carlos Alomar]], [[John Lennon]]\n| length2         = 4:06\n| title3          = [[TVC 15]]\n| length3         = 4:37\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n| all_writing     = \n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        =Side three\n| total_length    = 19:25\n| title1          = [[Warszawa (song)|Warszawa]]\n| note1           = Bowie, [[Brian Eno]]\n| length1         = 6:50\n| title2         = [[Speed of Life (David Bowie song)|Speed of Life]]\n| length2        = 2:44\n| title3         = [[Art Decade]]\n| length3        = 3:10\n| title4         = [[Sense of Doubt]]\n| length4        = 3:13\n| title5         = [[Breaking Glass (song)|Breaking Glass]]\n| note5          = Bowie, [[Dennis Davis]], [[George Murray (musician)|George Murray]]\n| length5        = 3:28\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n| all_writing     = \n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        =Side four\n| total_length    = 19:52 (73:17)\n| title1         = [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie song)|\"Heroes\"]]\n| note1          = Bowie, Eno\n| length1        = 6:19\n| title2         = [[What in the World]]\n| length2        = 4:24\n| title3         = [[Blackout (David Bowie song)|Blackout]]\n| length3        = 4:01\n| title4         = [[Beauty and the Beast (David Bowie song)|Beauty and the Beast]]\n| length4        = 5:08\n}}\nThe cassette release places \"[[Speed of Life (David Bowie song)|Speed of Life]]\" between \"Fame\" and \"TVC 15\".\n\n===Rereleases===\n''Stage'' has been rereleased on CD four times to date, the first being in 1984 by [[RCA Records]], then in 1991 by [[Rykodisc]] (containing a bonus track), later in 2005 by [[EMI]], and most recently in 2017 by [[Parlophone]] (also on vinyl).

These investors may be retail or institutional in nature. The term is typically used in the United States, while similar structures across the globe include the SICAV in Europe ('investment company with variable capital') and [[open-ended investment company]] (OEIC) in the UK.\n\nMutual funds have advantages and disadvantages compared to direct investing in individual securities. Advantages of mutual funds include economies of scale, diversification, liquidity, and professional management. However, these come with [[mutual fund fees and expenses]].\n\nNot all investment funds are mutual funds;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/investment-products/mutual-funds-and-exchange-traded-2|title=Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) {{!}} Investor.gov|website=www.investor.gov|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> alternative structures include [[unit investment trust]]s, [[closed-end fund]]s, and [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs). These alternative structures share similarities such as liquidity due to trading on exchanges and, in the United States, similar consumer protections under the [[Investment Company Act of 1940]].\n\nMutual funds are also classified by their principal investments as [[money market fund]]s, bond or fixed income funds, stock or equity funds, hybrid funds or other. Funds may also be categorized as [[index fund]]s, which are passively managed funds that match the performance of an index, or actively managed funds. [[Hedge fund]]s are not mutual funds as hedge funds cannot be sold to the general public and lack various standard investor protections.\n\n==History==\n=== Early history ===\n{{More information|Financial history of the Dutch Republic}}\nThe first modern [[investment fund]]s (the precursor of today's mutual funds) were established in the [[Dutch Republic]].  In response to the [[financial crisis]] of 1772\u20131773, Amsterdam-based businessman Abraham (or Adriaan) van Ketwich formed a trust named Eendragt Maakt Magt (\"unity creates strength\"). His aim was to provide small investors with an opportunity to diversify.<ref>Goetzmann, William N.; Rouwenhorst, K. Geert (2005).

Early U.S. funds were generally closed-end funds with a fixed number of shares that often traded at prices above the portfolio [[net asset value]]. The first open-end mutual fund with redeemable shares was established on March 21, 1924 as the Massachusetts Investors Trust (it is still in existence today and is now managed by [[MFS Investment Management]]).\n\nIn the United States, closed-end funds remained more popular than open-end funds throughout the 1920s. In 1929, open-end funds accounted for only 5% of the industry's $27 billion in total assets.\n\nAfter the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the [[United States Congress]] passed a series of acts regulating the securities markets in general and mutual funds in particular. \n* The [[Securities Act of 1933]] requires that all investments sold to the public, including mutual funds, be registered with the SEC and that they provide prospective investors with a [[Prospectus (finance)|prospectus]] that discloses essential facts about the investment. \n* The [[Securities and Exchange Act of 1934]] requires that issuers of securities, including mutual funds, report regularly to their investors. This act also created the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is the principal regulator of mutual funds. \n* The [[Revenue Act of 1936]] established guidelines for the taxation of mutual funds.\n* The [[Investment Company Act of 1940]] established rules specifically governing mutual funds. \nThese new regulations encouraged the development of open-end mutual funds (as opposed to closed-end funds).\n\nIn 1936, the [[Revenue Act of 1936]] allowed the mutual fund to be treated as a [[flow-through entity]], where the gains and distributions would pass through to investors who were responsible to tax, which made them equivalent to buying stocks directly for tax purposes; this has been called the most important law in US mutual fund history as it began their federal regulation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fink|first=Matthew P.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VtpQovTBAfIC|title=The Rise of Mutual Funds: An Insider's View|date=2011-01-13|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-975350-5|language=en}}</ref>{{Rp|29}}\n\nGrowth in the U.S. mutual fund industry remained limited until the 1950s, when confidence in the stock market returned. By 1970, there were approximately 360 funds with $48 billion in assets.<ref name=\"fink\">{{cite book | last=Fink | first= Matthew P. | title=The Rise of Mutual Funds| publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2008}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s Boston's [[Fidelity Investments]] was the first major US finance firm to market mutual funds directly to everyday people, rather than to those with high incomes or high wealth levels or already working in the finance industry.<ref>Peter Lynch and John Rothschild, Beating the Street Simon & Schuster; Revised edition (May 25, 1994) 0671891634</ref> The introduction of money market funds in the high interest rate environment of the late 1970s boosted industry growth dramatically. The first retail [[index fund]], First Index Investment Trust, was formed in 1976 by [[The Vanguard Group]], headed by [[John Bogle]]; it is now called the \"Vanguard 500 Index Fund\" and is one of the world's largest mutual funds. Fund industry growth continued into the 1980s and 1990s, but participation has varied (sometimes dramatically) depending on larger economic trends or sentiments.<ref name=Lynch1994>Peter Lynch and John Rothschild, Beating the Street Simon & Schuster; Revised edition (May 25, 1994) 0671891634</ref>\n\nAccording to Robert Pozen and Theresa Hamacher, growth was the result of three factors: \n# A [[bull market]] for both stocks and bonds, \n# New product introductions (including funds based on [[municipal bond]]s, various industry sectors, international funds, and [[target date fund]]s) and \n# Wider distribution of fund shares. Among the new distribution channels were retirement plans. Mutual funds are now the preferred investment option in certain types of fast-growing retirement plans, specifically in [[401(k)]], other [[defined contribution plan]]s and in [[individual retirement account]]s (IRAs), all of which surged in popularity in the 1980s.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Fund Industry: How Your Money is Managed|last=Pozen|first=Robert|last2=Hamacher|first2=Theresa|publisher=Wiley|year=2015|isbn=9781118929940|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|pages=8\u201314}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the mutual fund industry was involved in a [[2003 mutual fund scandal|scandal]] involving unequal treatment of fund shareholders. Some fund management companies allowed favored investors to engage in [[late trading]], which is illegal, or [[market timing]], which is a practice prohibited by fund policy. The scandal was initially discovered by former [[New York Attorney General]] [[Eliot Spitzer]] and led to a significant increase in regulation. In a study about German mutual funds [[Gomolka]] (2007) found statistical evidence of illegal time zone arbitrage in trading of German mutual funds.<ref>Gomolka, Johannes (2007): Die zwei Gesichter der deutschen Fondsbranche. Cut-Off-Zeit und Zeitzonenarbitrage, publisher: IBIDEM, Hannover, 158 pages</ref> Though reported to regulators [[BaFin]] never commented on these results.\n\nTotal mutual fund assets fell in 2008 as a result of the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]].\n\n=== Mutual funds today ===\nAt the end of 2018, mutual fund assets worldwide were $46.7 [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]], according to the Investment Company Institute.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.icifactbook.org/|title=2019 Investment Company Factbook|last=|first=|date=2019|website=Investment Company Institute|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The countries with the largest mutual fund industries are:\n# United States: $21.0 trillion\n# Luxembourg: $4.7 trillion\n# Ireland: $2.8 trillion\n# Germany: $2.2 trillion\n# France: $2.1 trillion\n# Australia: $1.9 trillion\n# Japan: $1.8 trillion\n#China: $1.8 trillion\n#United Kingdom: $1.7 trillion\n# Brazil: $1.2 trillion\n\nIn the United States, mutual funds play an important role in U.S. household finances. At the end of 2018, 21% of household financial assets were held in mutual funds. Their role in retirement savings was even more significant, since mutual funds accounted for roughly half of the assets in individual retirement accounts, 401(k)s and other similar retirement plans.<ref name=\":1\" /> In total, mutual funds are large investors in stocks and bonds.\n\nLuxembourg and Ireland are the primary jurisdictions for the registration of [[UCITS]] funds. These funds may be sold throughout the [[European Union]] and in other countries that have adopted mutual recognition regimes.\n\n==Features==\nMutual funds have advantages and disadvantages compared to alternative structures or investing directly in individual securities. According to Robert Pozen and Theresa Hamacher, these are:\n\n=== Advantages ===\n* Increased diversification: A fund diversifies holding many securities. This [[Diversification (finance)|diversification]] decreases risk.\n* Professional investment management: Open-and closed-end funds hire portfolio managers to supervise the fund's investments. \n* Ability to participate in investments that may be available only to larger investors. For example, individual investors often find it difficult to invest directly in foreign markets. \n* Service and convenience: Funds often provide services such as check writing.\n* Government oversight: Mutual funds are regulated by a governmental body.\n* Transparency and ease of comparison: All mutual funds are required to report the same information to investors, which makes them easier to compare to each other.<ref name=\":2\" />\n* Lower cost: The cost of a single investor to buy a stock or a bond is lower than investing individually.\n* Flexibility: Mutual funds enables changes portfolio with market conditions change.\n\n==== Liquidity ====\nIn the United States, mutual fund shares can be redeemed for their net asset value within seven days, but in practice the redemption is often much quicker.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=SEC-2016-2027-0001|title=Investment Company Liquidity Risk Management Programs RIN 3235-AL61|last=|first=|date=|website=www.regulations.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The transaction generally occurs after the market closes, with the mutual fund company using a net asset value calculated with the closing prices of that day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/110615/when-are-mutual-fund-orders-executed.asp|title=When Are Mutual Fund Orders Executed?|last=Jr|first=Louis Horkan|website=Investopedia|language=en|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> However, the actual value may not be reflected by the calculated net asset value for various reasons, such as the timezones (foreign stocks) and delay in trade clearing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://insight.factset.com/the-biggest-myths-in-net-asset-value|title=The Biggest Myths in Net Asset Value|last=Inc|first=FactSet Research Systems|website=insight.factset.com|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The stale prices can reward active trading at the cost of other shareholders, so mutual funds may limit active trading.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Ritter|first=Jay R.|date=2008-09-01|title=Forensic Finance|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=127\u2013147|doi=10.1257/jep.22.3.127|issn=0895-3309}}</ref> In 2003, a \"late trading\" scandal occurred when some traders were allowed to trade later than retail investors.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2004/dec/themutualfundtradingscandals.html|title=The Mutual Fund Trading Scandals|date=2004-12-01|website=Journal of Accountancy|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\nThis liquidity can create [[asset\u2013liability mismatch]] which poses challenges, which in part motivated an SEC liquidity management rule in 2016.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Disadvantages===\nMutual funds have disadvantages as well, which include:\n* [[Mutual fund fees and expenses|Fees]]\n* Less control over timing of recognition of gains\n* Less predictable income\n* No opportunity to customize<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Regulation and operation ==\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, the principal laws governing mutual funds are:\n* The [[Securities Act of 1933]] requires that all investments sold to the public, including mutual funds, be registered with the SEC and that they provide potential investors with a [[Prospectus (finance)|prospectus]] that discloses essential facts about the investment. \n* The [[Securities and Exchange Act of 1934]] requires that issuers of securities, including mutual funds, report regularly to their investors; this act also created the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is the principal regulator of mutual funds. \n* The [[Revenue Act of 1936]] established guidelines for the taxation of mutual funds. Mutual funds are not taxed on their income and profits if they comply with certain requirements under the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Code]]; instead, the taxable income is passed through to the investors in the fund. Funds are required by the IRS to diversify their investments, limit ownership of voting securities, distribute most of their income (dividends, interest, and capital gains net of losses) to their investors annually, and earn most of the income by investing in securities and currencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/851|title=26 U.S. Code \u00a7& 851 \u2013 Definition of regulated investment company|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=[[Cornell Law School]]}}</ref> The characterization of a fund's income is unchanged when it is paid to shareholders. For example, when a mutual fund distributes dividend income to its shareholders, fund investors will report the distribution as dividend income on their tax return. As a result, mutual funds are often called [[Flow-through entity|\"pass-through\" vehicles]], because they simply pass on income and related tax liabilities to their investors.\n* The [[Investment Company Act of 1940]] establishes rules specifically governing mutual funds. The focus of this Act is on disclosure to the investing public of information about the fund and its investment objectives, as well as on investment company structure and operations.\n* The [[Investment Advisers Act of 1940]] establishes rules governing the investment advisers. With certain exceptions, this Act requires that firms or sole practitioners compensated for advising others about securities investments must register with the SEC and conform to regulations designed to protect investors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/answers/about-lawsshtml.html|title=SEC.gov {{!}} The Laws That Govern the Securities Industry|website=www.sec.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-01-20}}</ref>\n* The [[National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996]] gave rulemaking authority to the federal government, preempting state regulators. However, states continue to have authority to investigate and prosecute fraud involving mutual funds.\n\nOpen-end and closed-end funds are overseen by a [[board of directors]], if organized as a corporation, or by a board of [[trustee]]s, if organized as a trust. The Board must ensure that the fund is managed in the interests of the fund's investors. The board hires the fund manager and other service providers to the fund.\n\nThe sponsor or fund management company, often referred to as the fund manager, [[Trade (financial instrument)|trades]] (buys and sells) the fund's investments in accordance with the fund's investment objective. Funds that are managed by the same company under the same brand are known as a fund family or fund complex. A fund manager must be a [[registered investment adviser]].\n\n===European Union===\nIn the European Union, funds are governed by laws and regulations established by their home country. However, the European Union has established a mutual recognition regime that allows funds regulated in one country to be sold in all other countries in the European Union, but only if they comply with certain requirements. The directive establishing this regime is the [[Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive 2009]], and funds that comply with its requirements are known as UCITS funds.\n\n=== Canada ===\nRegulation of mutual funds in Canada is primarily governed by National Instrument 81-102 \"Mutual Funds\", which is implemented separately in each province or territory. The Canadian Securities Administrator works to harmonize regulation across Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.securities-administrators.ca/aboutcsa.aspx?id=45|title=Canadian Securities Administrator: Overview|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Hong Kong===\nIn the Hong Kong market mutual funds are regulated by two authorities:\n* The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) develops rules that apply to all mutual funds marketed in Hong Kong.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfc.hk/web/EN/regulatory-functions/products/|title=Investment products {{!}} Securities and Futures Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n* The Mandatory Provident Funds Schemes Authority (MPFA) rules apply only to mutual funds that are marketed for use in the retirement accounts of Hong Kong residents. The MPFA rules are generally more restrictive than the SFC rules.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mpfa.org.hk/eng/main/|title=MPFA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Taiwan===\nIn Taiwan, mutual funds are regulated by the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fsc.gov.tw/en/index.jsp|title=Financial Supervisory Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Open-end features ==\n{{Main|Open-end fund}}\n\nAs open-end funds, mutual funds must be willing to buy back (\"redeem\") their shares from their investors at the [[net asset value]] (NAV) computed that day based upon the prices of the securities owned by the fund. In the United States, open-end funds must be willing to buy back shares at the end of every business day. In other jurisdictions, open-funds may only be required to buy back shares at longer intervals. For example, UCITS funds in Europe are only required to accept redemptions twice each month (though most UCITS accept redemptions daily).\n\nMost open-end funds also sell shares to the public every business day; these shares are priced at NAV.\n\nIn the United States at the end of 2018, there were 8,078 open-end mutual funds with combined assets of $17.7 trillion, accounting for 84% of the U.S. industry.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Classification of funds by types of underlying investments==\nMutual funds may be classified by their principal investments, as described in the prospectus and investment objective. The four main categories of funds are money market funds, bond or fixed income funds, stock or equity funds, and hybrid funds. Within these categories, funds may be sub-classified by investment objective, investment approach or specific focus.\n\nThe types of securities that a particular fund may invest in are set forth in the fund's [[prospectus (finance)|prospectus]], a legal document which describes the fund's investment objective, investment approach and permitted investments. The investment objective describes the type of income that the fund seeks. For example, a capital appreciation fund generally looks to earn most of its returns from increases in the prices of the securities it holds, rather than from dividend or interest income. The investment approach describes the criteria that the fund manager uses to select investments for the fund.\n\nBond, stock, and hybrid funds may be classified as either index (or passively-managed) funds or actively managed funds.\n\n[[Alternative investment|Alternative investments]] which incorporate advanced techniques such as hedging known as \"liquid alternatives\".\n\n===Money market funds===\n\n{{Main|Money market fund}}\n\nMoney market funds invest in [[money market]] instruments, which are fixed income securities with a very short time to maturity and high credit quality. Investors often use money market funds as a substitute for bank [[savings account]]s, though money market funds are not insured by the government, unlike bank savings accounts.\n\nIn the United States, money market funds sold to retail investors and those investing in government securities may maintain a stable net asset value of $1 per share, when they comply with certain conditions.

Bond funds can be sub-classified according to:\n* The specific types of bonds owned (such as [[high-yield debt|high-yield or junk bonds]], investment-grade [[corporate bond]]s, government bonds or [[municipal bond]]s)\n* The maturity of the bonds held (i.e., short-, intermediate- or long-term)\n* The country of issuance of the bonds (such as U.S., emerging market or global)\n* The tax treatment of the interest received (taxable or tax-exempt)\n\nIn the United States, at the end of 2018, assets in bond funds (of all types) were $4.7 trillion, representing 22% of the industry.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Stock funds===\n{{Main|Stock fund}}\n\nStock or equity funds invest in [[common stock]]s. Stock funds may focus on a particular area of the stock market, such as \n* Stocks from only a certain industry\n* Stocks from a specified country or region\n* Stocks of companies experiencing strong ''growth''\n* Stocks that the portfolio managers deem to be a good ''value'' relative to the value of the company's business\n* Stocks paying high [[dividend]]s that provide ''income''\n* Stocks within a certain market capitalization range\n\nIn the United States, at the end of 2018, assets in stock funds (of all types) were $11.9 trillion, representing 56% of the industry.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFunds which invest in a relatively small number of stocks such as fewer than 50 are known as \"focus funds\"; these funds may also be [[Activist shareholder|activist investors]] and [[Alternative investment|alternative investments]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Aenlle|first=Conrad De|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/business/focusing-on-a-managers-best-stock-ideas-may-not-be-a-good-idea.html|title=Focusing on a Manager\u2019s Best Stock Ideas May Not Be a Good Idea|date=2018-04-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===Hybrid funds===\nHybrid funds invest in both bonds and stocks or in [[convertible security|convertible securities]]. Balanced funds, asset allocation funds, target date or target risk funds, and lifecycle or lifestyle funds are all types of hybrid funds.\n\nHybrid funds may be structured as [[Fund of funds|funds of funds]], meaning that they invest by buying shares in other mutual funds that invest in securities. Many funds of funds invest in affiliated funds (meaning mutual funds managed by the same fund sponsor), although some invest in unaffiliated funds (i.e., managed by other fund sponsors) or some combination of the two.\n\nIn the United States, at the end of 2018, assets in hybrid funds were $1.4 trillion, representing 7% of the industry.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.icifactbook.org/|title=2017 Investment Company Factbook|last=|first=|date=|website=Investment Company Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Other funds ===\nFunds may invest in commodities or other investments.\n\n==Expenses==\nInvestors in a mutual fund pay the fund's expenses. Some of these expenses reduce the value of an investor's account; others are paid by the fund and reduce [[net asset value]].\n\nThese expenses fall into five categories:\n\n===Management fee===\n{{Main|Management fee}}\nThe management fee is paid by the fund to the management company or sponsor that organizes the fund, provides the portfolio management or investment advisory services and normally lends its brand to the fund. The fund manager may also provide other administrative services. The management fee often has breakpoints, which means that it declines as assets (in either the specific fund or in the fund family as a whole) increase. The fund's board reviews the management fee annually. Fund shareholders must vote on any proposed increase, but the fund manager or sponsor can agree to waive some or all of the management fee in order to lower the fund's expense ratio.\n\nWhile index funds generally charge a lower management fee than actively-managed funds, prices have been converging in a margin compressing environment. In Canada, management fees in fee-based mutual fund structures (\"F\" series) or direct investing (\"D\", \"E\", or \"I\" series depending on the issuer) are also lower than their advisor series/commission-based counterparts (\"A\" series or \"Advisor\" series).\n\n===Distribution charges===\n{{Main|Mutual fund fees and expenses}}\n\nDistribution charges pay for marketing, distribution of the fund's shares as well as services to investors. There are three types of distribution charges.\n\n* Front-end load or sales charge. A [[front-end load]] or [[sales charge]] is a [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] paid to a [[broker]] by a mutual fund when shares are purchased. It is expressed as a percentage of the total amount invested or the \"public offering price\", which equals the net asset value plus the front-end load per share. The front-end load often declines as the amount invested increases, through [[Mutual fund fees and expenses#United States|breakpoints]]. The front-end load is paid by the investor; it is deducted from the amount invested.\n* Back-end load. Some funds have a [[back-end load]], which is paid by the investor when shares are redeemed. If the back-end load declines the longer the investor holds shares, it is called a contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC). Like the front-end load, the back-end load is paid by the investor; it is deducted from the redemption proceeds.\n* Distribution and services fee. Some funds charge an annual fee to compensate the distributor of fund shares for providing ongoing services to fund shareholders. In the United States, this fee is sometimes called a 12b-1 fee, after the SEC rule authorizing it. The distribution and services fee is paid by the fund and reduces net asset value.\nDistribution charges generally vary for each share class.\n\n===Securities transaction fees incurred by the fund===\nA mutual fund pays expenses related to buying or selling the securities in its portfolio. These expenses may include [[broker]]age commissions. These costs are normally positively correlated with turnover.\n\n===Shareholder transaction fees===\nShareholders may be required to pay fees for certain transactions, such as buying or selling shares of the fund. A fund may charge a fee for maintaining an individual retirement account for an investor. \n\nSome funds charge redemption fees when an investor sells fund shares shortly after buying them (usually defined as within 30, 60 or 90 days of purchase). Redemption fees are computed as a percentage of the sale amount. Shareholder transaction fees are not part of the expense ratio.\n\n===Fund services charges===\nA mutual fund may pay for other services including:\n* Board of directors or trustees fees and expenses\n* Custody fee: paid to a [[custodian bank]] for holding the fund's portfolio in safekeeping and collecting income owed on the securities\n* [[Fund administration]] fee: for overseeing all administrative affairs such as preparing financial statements and shareholder reports, SEC filings, monitoring compliance, computing total returns and other performance information, preparing/filing tax returns and all expenses of maintaining compliance with state [[blue sky law]]s\n* Fund accounting fee: for performing investment or securities accounting services and computing the [[net asset value]] (usually every day the [[New York Stock Exchange]] is open)\n* Professional services fees: legal and auditing fees\n* Registration fees: paid to the SEC and state securities regulators\n* Shareholder communications expenses: printing and mailing required documents to shareholders such as shareholder reports and prospectuses\n* Transfer agent service fees and expenses: for keeping shareholder records, providing statements and tax forms to investors and providing telephone, internet and or other investor support and servicing\n* Other/miscellaneous fees\n\nThe fund manager or sponsor may agree to subsidize some of these charges.\n\n=== Expense ratio ===\nThe expense ratio equals recurring fees and expenses charged to the fund during the year divided by average net assets. The management fee and fund services charges are ordinarily included in the expense ratio. Front-end and back-end loads, securities transaction fees and shareholder transaction fees are normally excluded.\n\nTo facilitate comparisons of expenses, regulators generally require that funds use the same formula to compute the expense ratio and publish the results.\n\n=== No-load fund ===\nIn the United States, a fund that calls itself \"[[no-load]]\" cannot charge a front-end load or back-end load under any circumstances and cannot charge a distribution and services fee greater than 0.25% of fund assets\n\n===Controversy regarding fees and expenses===\nCritics of the fund industry argue that fund expenses are too high. They believe that the market for mutual funds is not competitive and that there are many hidden fees, so that it is difficult for investors to reduce the fees that they pay. They argue that the most effective way for investors to raise the returns they earn from mutual funds is to invest in funds with low expense ratios.\n\nFund managers counter that fees are determined by a highly competitive market and, therefore, reflect the value that investors attribute to the service provided. They also note that fees are clearly disclosed.\n\n== Definitions of key terms ==\n\n===Average annual total return===\nMutual funds in the United States are required to report the average annual compounded rates of return for one-, five-and ten year-periods using the following formula:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-7512f.htm#E12E2|title=Final Rule: Registration Form Used by Open-End Management Investment Companies: Sample Form and instructions|date=March 23, 1998|publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)}}</ref>\n\nP(1+T)<sup>n</sup> = ERV\n\nWhere:\n\nP = a hypothetical initial payment of $1,000\n\nT = average annual total return\n\nn = number of years\n\nERV = ending redeemable value of a hypothetical $1,000 payment made at the beginning of the one-, five-, or ten-year periods at the end of the one-, five-, or ten-year periods (or fractional portion).\n\n=== Market capitalization ===\nMarket capitalization equals the number of a company's shares outstanding multiplied by the market price of the stock. Market capitalization is an indication of the size of a company. Typical ranges of market capitalizations are:\n\n* Mega cap - companies worth $200 billion or more\n* Big/large cap - companies worth between $10 billion and $200 billion\n* Mid cap - companies worth between $2 billion and $10 billion\n* Small cap - companies worth between $300 million and $2 billion\n* Micro cap - companies worth between $50 million and $300 million\n* Nano cap - companies worth less than $50 million\n\n===Net asset value===\n{{Main|Net asset value}}\nA fund's net asset value (NAV) equals the current market value of a fund's holdings minus the fund's liabilities (this figure may also be referred to as the fund's \"net assets\"). It is usually expressed as a per-share amount, computed by dividing net assets by the number of fund shares outstanding. Funds must compute their net asset value according to the rules set forth in their prospectuses. Most compute their NAV at the end of each business day.\n\nValuing the securities held in a fund's portfolio is often the most difficult part of calculating net asset value. The fund's board typically oversees security valuation.\n\n=== Share classes ===\nA single mutual fund may give investors a choice of different combinations of front-end loads, back-end loads and distribution and services fee, by offering several different types of shares, known as share classes. All of them invest in the same portfolio of securities, but each has different expenses and, therefore, a different net asset value and different performance results. Some of these share classes may be available only to certain types of investors.\n\nTypical share classes for funds sold through brokers or other intermediaries in the United States are:\n* '''Class A''' shares usually charge a front-end sales load together with a small distribution and services fee.\n* '''Class B''' shares usually do not have a front-end sales load; rather, they have a high [[Deferred sales charge|contingent deferred sales charge]] (CDSC) that gradually declines over several years, combined with a high [[12b-1]] fee. Class B shares usually convert automatically to Class A shares after they have been held for a certain period.\n* '''Class C''' shares usually have a high distribution and services fee and a modest contingent deferred sales charge that is discontinued after one or two years. Class C shares usually do not convert to another class. They are often called \"level load\" shares.\n* '''Class I''' are usually subject to very high minimum investment requirements and are, therefore, known as \"institutional\" shares. They are no-load shares.\n* '''Class R''' are usually for use in retirement plans such as [[401(k)]] plans. They typically do not charge loads, but do charge a small distribution and services fee.\nNo-load funds in the United States often have two classes of shares:\n* '''Class I''' shares do not charge a distribution and services fee\n* '''Class N''' shares charge a distribution and services fee of no more than 0.25% of fund assets\nNeither class of shares typically charges a front-end or back-end load.\n\n=== Portfolio Turnover ===\n''Portfolio Turnover'' is a measure of the volume of a fund's securities trading. It is expressed as a percentage of average market value of the portfolio's long-term securities. Turnover is the lesser of a fund's purchases or sales during a given year divided by average long-term securities market value for the same period. If the period is less than a year, turnover is generally annualized.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n\n* [[Active management]]\n* [[Fund derivative]]\n* [[Global assets under management]]\n* [[Index fund]]\n* [[Lipper average]]\n* [[List of mutual-fund families in Canada]]\n* [[List of mutual-fund families in the United States]]\n* [[List of US mutual funds by assets under management|List of U.S. mutual funds by assets under management]]\n* [[Money fund]]\n* [[Collective trust fund]]\n* [[Mutual funds in India]]\n* [[Mutual-fund scandal (2003)]]\n* [[Operation Perfect Hedge]]\n<!-- * [[Real estate fund]] -->\n* [[Retirement plans in the United States]]\n* [[Rights of accumulation]]\n* [[Separately managed account]]\n* [[Value investing]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yYhBgAAQBAj|title=The Fund Industry: How Your Money is Managed|date=2015|publisher=Wiley Finance|isbn=978-1118929940|edition=2nd|location=Hoboken, NJ|author1=Robert Pozen|author2=Theresa Hamacher}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Thomas P.

These alternative structures share similarities such as liquidity due to trading on exchanges and, in the United States, similar consumer protections under the [[Investment Company Act of 1940]].\n\nMutual funds are also classified by their principal investments as [[money market fund]]s, bond or fixed income funds, stock or equity funds, hybrid funds or other. Funds may also be categorized as [[index fund]]s, which are passively managed funds that match the performance of an index, or actively managed funds. [[Hedge fund]]s are not mutual funds as hedge funds cannot be sold to the general public and lack various standard investor protections.\n\n==History==\n=== Early history ===\n{{More information|Financial history of the Dutch Republic}}\nThe first modern [[investment fund]]s (the precursor of today's mutual funds) were established in the [[Dutch Republic]].  In response to the [[financial crisis]] of 1772\u20131773, Amsterdam-based businessman Abraham (or Adriaan) van Ketwich formed a trust named Eendragt Maakt Magt (\"unity creates strength\"). His aim was to provide small investors with an opportunity to diversify.<ref>Goetzmann, William N.; Rouwenhorst, K. Geert (2005).

Early U.S. funds were generally closed-end funds with a fixed number of shares that often traded at prices above the portfolio [[net asset value]]. The first open-end mutual fund with redeemable shares was established on March 21, 1924 as the Massachusetts Investors Trust (it is still in existence today and is now managed by [[MFS Investment Management]]).\n\nIn the United States, closed-end funds remained more popular than open-end funds throughout the 1920s. In 1929, open-end funds accounted for only 5% of the industry's $27 billion in total assets.\n\nAfter the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the [[United States Congress]] passed a series of acts regulating the securities markets in general and mutual funds in particular. \n* The [[Securities Act of 1933]] requires that all investments sold to the public, including mutual funds, be registered with the SEC and that they provide prospective investors with a [[Prospectus (finance)|prospectus]] that discloses essential facts about the investment. \n* The [[Securities and Exchange Act of 1934]] requires that issuers of securities, including mutual funds, report regularly to their investors. This act also created the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is the principal regulator of mutual funds. \n* The [[Revenue Act of 1936]] established guidelines for the taxation of mutual funds.\n* The [[Investment Company Act of 1940]] established rules specifically governing mutual funds. \nThese new regulations encouraged the development of open-end mutual funds (as opposed to closed-end funds).\n\nIn 1936, the [[Revenue Act of 1936]] allowed the mutual fund to be treated as a [[flow-through entity]], where the gains and distributions would pass through to investors who were responsible to tax, which made them equivalent to buying stocks directly for tax purposes; this has been called the most important law in US mutual fund history as it began their federal regulation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fink|first=Matthew P.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VtpQovTBAfIC|title=The Rise of Mutual Funds: An Insider's View|date=2011-01-13|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-975350-5|language=en}}</ref>{{Rp|29}}\n\nGrowth in the U.S. mutual fund industry remained limited until the 1950s, when confidence in the stock market returned.

The first retail [[index fund]], First Index Investment Trust, was formed in 1976 by [[The Vanguard Group]], headed by [[John Bogle]]; it is now called the \"Vanguard 500 Index Fund\" and is one of the world's largest mutual funds. Fund industry growth continued into the 1980s and 1990s, but participation has varied (sometimes dramatically) depending on larger economic trends or sentiments.<ref name=Lynch1994>Peter Lynch and John Rothschild, Beating the Street Simon & Schuster; Revised edition (May 25, 1994) 0671891634</ref>\n\nAccording to Robert Pozen and Theresa Hamacher, growth was the result of three factors: \n# A [[bull market]] for both stocks and bonds, \n# New product introductions (including funds based on [[municipal bond]]s, various industry sectors, international funds, and [[target date fund]]s) and \n# Wider distribution of fund shares. Among the new distribution channels were retirement plans. Mutual funds are now the preferred investment option in certain types of fast-growing retirement plans, specifically in [[401(k)]], other [[defined contribution plan]]s and in [[individual retirement account]]s (IRAs), all of which surged in popularity in the 1980s.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Fund Industry: How Your Money is Managed|last=Pozen|first=Robert|last2=Hamacher|first2=Theresa|publisher=Wiley|year=2015|isbn=9781118929940|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|pages=8\u201314}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the mutual fund industry was involved in a [[2003 mutual fund scandal|scandal]] involving unequal treatment of fund shareholders. Some fund management companies allowed favored investors to engage in [[late trading]], which is illegal, or [[market timing]], which is a practice prohibited by fund policy. The scandal was initially discovered by former [[New York Attorney General]] [[Eliot Spitzer]] and led to a significant increase in regulation. In a study about German mutual funds [[Gomolka]] (2007) found statistical evidence of illegal time zone arbitrage in trading of German mutual funds.<ref>Gomolka, Johannes (2007): Die zwei Gesichter der deutschen Fondsbranche.

At the end of 2018, 21% of household financial assets were held in mutual funds. Their role in retirement savings was even more significant, since mutual funds accounted for roughly half of the assets in individual retirement accounts, 401(k)s and other similar retirement plans.<ref name=\":1\" /> In total, mutual funds are large investors in stocks and bonds.\n\nLuxembourg and Ireland are the primary jurisdictions for the registration of [[UCITS]] funds. These funds may be sold throughout the [[European Union]] and in other countries that have adopted mutual recognition regimes.\n\n==Features==\nMutual funds have advantages and disadvantages compared to alternative structures or investing directly in individual securities. According to Robert Pozen and Theresa Hamacher, these are:\n\n=== Advantages ===\n* Increased diversification: A fund diversifies holding many securities. This [[Diversification (finance)|diversification]] decreases risk.\n* Professional investment management: Open-and closed-end funds hire portfolio managers to supervise the fund's investments. \n* Ability to participate in investments that may be available only to larger investors. For example, individual investors often find it difficult to invest directly in foreign markets. \n* Service and convenience: Funds often provide services such as check writing.\n* Government oversight: Mutual funds are regulated by a governmental body.\n* Transparency and ease of comparison: All mutual funds are required to report the same information to investors, which makes them easier to compare to each other.<ref name=\":2\" />\n* Lower cost: The cost of a single investor to buy a stock or a bond is lower than investing individually.\n* Flexibility: Mutual funds enables changes portfolio with market conditions change.\n\n==== Liquidity ====\nIn the United States, mutual fund shares can be redeemed for their net asset value within seven days, but in practice the redemption is often much quicker.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=SEC-2016-2027-0001|title=Investment Company Liquidity Risk Management Programs RIN 3235-AL61|last=|first=|date=|website=www.regulations.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The transaction generally occurs after the market closes, with the mutual fund company using a net asset value calculated with the closing prices of that day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/110615/when-are-mutual-fund-orders-executed.asp|title=When Are Mutual Fund Orders Executed?|last=Jr|first=Louis Horkan|website=Investopedia|language=en|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> However, the actual value may not be reflected by the calculated net asset value for various reasons, such as the timezones (foreign stocks) and delay in trade clearing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://insight.factset.com/the-biggest-myths-in-net-asset-value|title=The Biggest Myths in Net Asset Value|last=Inc|first=FactSet Research Systems|website=insight.factset.com|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The stale prices can reward active trading at the cost of other shareholders, so mutual funds may limit active trading.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Ritter|first=Jay R.|date=2008-09-01|title=Forensic Finance|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=127\u2013147|doi=10.1257/jep.22.3.127|issn=0895-3309}}</ref> In 2003, a \"late trading\" scandal occurred when some traders were allowed to trade later than retail investors.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2004/dec/themutualfundtradingscandals.html|title=The Mutual Fund Trading Scandals|date=2004-12-01|website=Journal of Accountancy|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\nThis liquidity can create [[asset\u2013liability mismatch]] which poses challenges, which in part motivated an SEC liquidity management rule in 2016.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Disadvantages===\nMutual funds have disadvantages as well, which include:\n* [[Mutual fund fees and expenses|Fees]]\n* Less control over timing of recognition of gains\n* Less predictable income\n* No opportunity to customize<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Regulation and operation ==\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, the principal laws governing mutual funds are:\n* The [[Securities Act of 1933]] requires that all investments sold to the public, including mutual funds, be registered with the SEC and that they provide potential investors with a [[Prospectus (finance)|prospectus]] that discloses essential facts about the investment. \n* The [[Securities and Exchange Act of 1934]] requires that issuers of securities, including mutual funds, report regularly to their investors; this act also created the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is the principal regulator of mutual funds. \n* The [[Revenue Act of 1936]] established guidelines for the taxation of mutual funds. Mutual funds are not taxed on their income and profits if they comply with certain requirements under the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Code]]; instead, the taxable income is passed through to the investors in the fund. Funds are required by the IRS to diversify their investments, limit ownership of voting securities, distribute most of their income (dividends, interest, and capital gains net of losses) to their investors annually, and earn most of the income by investing in securities and currencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/851|title=26 U.S. Code \u00a7& 851 \u2013 Definition of regulated investment company|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=[[Cornell Law School]]}}</ref> The characterization of a fund's income is unchanged when it is paid to shareholders. For example, when a mutual fund distributes dividend income to its shareholders, fund investors will report the distribution as dividend income on their tax return. As a result, mutual funds are often called [[Flow-through entity|\"pass-through\" vehicles]], because they simply pass on income and related tax liabilities to their investors.\n* The [[Investment Company Act of 1940]] establishes rules specifically governing mutual funds. The focus of this Act is on disclosure to the investing public of information about the fund and its investment objectives, as well as on investment company structure and operations.\n* The [[Investment Advisers Act of 1940]] establishes rules governing the investment advisers. With certain exceptions, this Act requires that firms or sole practitioners compensated for advising others about securities investments must register with the SEC and conform to regulations designed to protect investors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/answers/about-lawsshtml.html|title=SEC.gov {{!}} The Laws That Govern the Securities Industry|website=www.sec.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-01-20}}</ref>\n* The [[National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996]] gave rulemaking authority to the federal government, preempting state regulators. However, states continue to have authority to investigate and prosecute fraud involving mutual funds.\n\nOpen-end and closed-end funds are overseen by a [[board of directors]], if organized as a corporation, or by a board of [[trustee]]s, if organized as a trust. The Board must ensure that the fund is managed in the interests of the fund's investors. The board hires the fund manager and other service providers to the fund.\n\nThe sponsor or fund management company, often referred to as the fund manager, [[Trade (financial instrument)|trades]] (buys and sells) the fund's investments in accordance with the fund's investment objective. Funds that are managed by the same company under the same brand are known as a fund family or fund complex. A fund manager must be a [[registered investment adviser]].\n\n===European Union===\nIn the European Union, funds are governed by laws and regulations established by their home country. However, the European Union has established a mutual recognition regime that allows funds regulated in one country to be sold in all other countries in the European Union, but only if they comply with certain requirements. The directive establishing this regime is the [[Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive 2009]], and funds that comply with its requirements are known as UCITS funds.\n\n=== Canada ===\nRegulation of mutual funds in Canada is primarily governed by National Instrument 81-102 \"Mutual Funds\", which is implemented separately in each province or territory. The Canadian Securities Administrator works to harmonize regulation across Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.securities-administrators.ca/aboutcsa.aspx?id=45|title=Canadian Securities Administrator: Overview|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Hong Kong===\nIn the Hong Kong market mutual funds are regulated by two authorities:\n* The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) develops rules that apply to all mutual funds marketed in Hong Kong.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfc.hk/web/EN/regulatory-functions/products/|title=Investment products {{!}} Securities and Futures Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n* The Mandatory Provident Funds Schemes Authority (MPFA) rules apply only to mutual funds that are marketed for use in the retirement accounts of Hong Kong residents. The MPFA rules are generally more restrictive than the SFC rules.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mpfa.org.hk/eng/main/|title=MPFA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Taiwan===\nIn Taiwan, mutual funds are regulated by the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fsc.gov.tw/en/index.jsp|title=Financial Supervisory Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Open-end features ==\n{{Main|Open-end fund}}\n\nAs open-end funds, mutual funds must be willing to buy back (\"redeem\") their shares from their investors at the [[net asset value]] (NAV) computed that day based upon the prices of the securities owned by the fund. In the United States, open-end funds must be willing to buy back shares at the end of every business day. In other jurisdictions, open-funds may only be required to buy back shares at longer intervals. For example, UCITS funds in Europe are only required to accept redemptions twice each month (though most UCITS accept redemptions daily).\n\nMost open-end funds also sell shares to the public every business day; these shares are priced at NAV.\n\nIn the United States at the end of 2018, there were 8,078 open-end mutual funds with combined assets of $17.7 trillion, accounting for 84% of the U.S. industry.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Classification of funds by types of underlying investments==\nMutual funds may be classified by their principal investments, as described in the prospectus and investment objective. The four main categories of funds are money market funds, bond or fixed income funds, stock or equity funds, and hybrid funds. Within these categories, funds may be sub-classified by investment objective, investment approach or specific focus.\n\nThe types of securities that a particular fund may invest in are set forth in the fund's [[prospectus (finance)|prospectus]], a legal document which describes the fund's investment objective, investment approach and permitted investments. The investment objective describes the type of income that the fund seeks. For example, a capital appreciation fund generally looks to earn most of its returns from increases in the prices of the securities it holds, rather than from dividend or interest income. The investment approach describes the criteria that the fund manager uses to select investments for the fund.\n\nBond, stock, and hybrid funds may be classified as either index (or passively-managed) funds or actively managed funds.\n\n[[Alternative investment|Alternative investments]] which incorporate advanced techniques such as hedging known as \"liquid alternatives\".\n\n===Money market funds===\n\n{{Main|Money market fund}}\n\nMoney market funds invest in [[money market]] instruments, which are fixed income securities with a very short time to maturity and high credit quality. Investors often use money market funds as a substitute for bank [[savings account]]s, though money market funds are not insured by the government, unlike bank savings accounts.\n\nIn the United States, money market funds sold to retail investors and those investing in government securities may maintain a stable net asset value of $1 per share, when they comply with certain conditions. Money market funds sold to institutional investors that invest in non-government securities must compute a net asset value based on the value of the securities held in the funds.\n\nIn the United States, at the end of 2018, assets in money market funds were $3.0 trillion, representing 14% of the industry.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Bond funds===\n{{Main|Bond fund}}\n\nBond funds invest in fixed income or debt securities. Bond funds can be sub-classified according to:\n* The specific types of bonds owned (such as [[high-yield debt|high-yield or junk bonds]], investment-grade [[corporate bond]]s, government bonds or [[municipal bond]]s)\n* The maturity of the bonds held (i.e., short-, intermediate- or long-term)\n* The country of issuance of the bonds (such as U.S., emerging market or global)\n* The tax treatment of the interest received (taxable or tax-exempt)\n\nIn the United States, at the end of 2018, assets in bond funds (of all types) were $4.7 trillion, representing 22% of the industry.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Stock funds===\n{{Main|Stock fund}}\n\nStock or equity funds invest in [[common stock]]s. Stock funds may focus on a particular area of the stock market, such as \n* Stocks from only a certain industry\n* Stocks from a specified country or region\n* Stocks of companies experiencing strong ''growth''\n* Stocks that the portfolio managers deem to be a good ''value'' relative to the value of the company's business\n* Stocks paying high [[dividend]]s that provide ''income''\n* Stocks within a certain market capitalization range\n\nIn the United States, at the end of 2018, assets in stock funds (of all types) were $11.9 trillion, representing 56% of the industry.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFunds which invest in a relatively small number of stocks such as fewer than 50 are known as \"focus funds\"; these funds may also be [[Activist shareholder|activist investors]] and [[Alternative investment|alternative investments]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Aenlle|first=Conrad De|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/business/focusing-on-a-managers-best-stock-ideas-may-not-be-a-good-idea.html|title=Focusing on a Manager\u2019s Best Stock Ideas May Not Be a Good Idea|date=2018-04-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===Hybrid funds===\nHybrid funds invest in both bonds and stocks or in [[convertible security|convertible securities]]. Balanced funds, asset allocation funds, target date or target risk funds, and lifecycle or lifestyle funds are all types of hybrid funds.\n\nHybrid funds may be structured as [[Fund of funds|funds of funds]], meaning that they invest by buying shares in other mutual funds that invest in securities. Many funds of funds invest in affiliated funds (meaning mutual funds managed by the same fund sponsor), although some invest in unaffiliated funds (i.e., managed by other fund sponsors) or some combination of the two.\n\nIn the United States, at the end of 2018, assets in hybrid funds were $1.4 trillion, representing 7% of the industry.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.icifactbook.org/|title=2017 Investment Company Factbook|last=|first=|date=|website=Investment Company Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Other funds ===\nFunds may invest in commodities or other investments.\n\n==Expenses==\nInvestors in a mutual fund pay the fund's expenses. Some of these expenses reduce the value of an investor's account; others are paid by the fund and reduce [[net asset value]].\n\nThese expenses fall into five categories:\n\n===Management fee===\n{{Main|Management fee}}\nThe management fee is paid by the fund to the management company or sponsor that organizes the fund, provides the portfolio management or investment advisory services and normally lends its brand to the fund. The fund manager may also provide other administrative services. The management fee often has breakpoints, which means that it declines as assets (in either the specific fund or in the fund family as a whole) increase. The fund's board reviews the management fee annually. Fund shareholders must vote on any proposed increase, but the fund manager or sponsor can agree to waive some or all of the management fee in order to lower the fund's expense ratio.\n\nWhile index funds generally charge a lower management fee than actively-managed funds, prices have been converging in a margin compressing environment. In Canada, management fees in fee-based mutual fund structures (\"F\" series) or direct investing (\"D\", \"E\", or \"I\" series depending on the issuer) are also lower than their advisor series/commission-based counterparts (\"A\" series or \"Advisor\" series).\n\n===Distribution charges===\n{{Main|Mutual fund fees and expenses}}\n\nDistribution charges pay for marketing, distribution of the fund's shares as well as services to investors. There are three types of distribution charges.\n\n* Front-end load or sales charge. A [[front-end load]] or [[sales charge]] is a [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] paid to a [[broker]] by a mutual fund when shares are purchased. It is expressed as a percentage of the total amount invested or the \"public offering price\", which equals the net asset value plus the front-end load per share. The front-end load often declines as the amount invested increases, through [[Mutual fund fees and expenses#United States|breakpoints]]. The front-end load is paid by the investor; it is deducted from the amount invested.\n* Back-end load. Some funds have a [[back-end load]], which is paid by the investor when shares are redeemed. If the back-end load declines the longer the investor holds shares, it is called a contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC). Like the front-end load, the back-end load is paid by the investor; it is deducted from the redemption proceeds.\n* Distribution and services fee. Some funds charge an annual fee to compensate the distributor of fund shares for providing ongoing services to fund shareholders. In the United States, this fee is sometimes called a 12b-1 fee, after the SEC rule authorizing it. The distribution and services fee is paid by the fund and reduces net asset value.\nDistribution charges generally vary for each share class.\n\n===Securities transaction fees incurred by the fund===\nA mutual fund pays expenses related to buying or selling the securities in its portfolio. These expenses may include [[broker]]age commissions. These costs are normally positively correlated with turnover.\n\n===Shareholder transaction fees===\nShareholders may be required to pay fees for certain transactions, such as buying or selling shares of the fund. A fund may charge a fee for maintaining an individual retirement account for an investor. \n\nSome funds charge redemption fees when an investor sells fund shares shortly after buying them (usually defined as within 30, 60 or 90 days of purchase). Redemption fees are computed as a percentage of the sale amount. Shareholder transaction fees are not part of the expense ratio.\n\n===Fund services charges===\nA mutual fund may pay for other services including:\n* Board of directors or trustees fees and expenses\n* Custody fee: paid to a [[custodian bank]] for holding the fund's portfolio in safekeeping and collecting income owed on the securities\n* [[Fund administration]] fee: for overseeing all administrative affairs such as preparing financial statements and shareholder reports, SEC filings, monitoring compliance, computing total returns and other performance information, preparing/filing tax returns and all expenses of maintaining compliance with state [[blue sky law]]s\n* Fund accounting fee: for performing investment or securities accounting services and computing the [[net asset value]] (usually every day the [[New York Stock Exchange]] is open)\n* Professional services fees: legal and auditing fees\n* Registration fees: paid to the SEC and state securities regulators\n* Shareholder communications expenses: printing and mailing required documents to shareholders such as shareholder reports and prospectuses\n* Transfer agent service fees and expenses: for keeping shareholder records, providing statements and tax forms to investors and providing telephone, internet and or other investor support and servicing\n* Other/miscellaneous fees\n\nThe fund manager or sponsor may agree to subsidize some of these charges.\n\n=== Expense ratio ===\nThe expense ratio equals recurring fees and expenses charged to the fund during the year divided by average net assets. The management fee and fund services charges are ordinarily included in the expense ratio. Front-end and back-end loads, securities transaction fees and shareholder transaction fees are normally excluded.\n\nTo facilitate comparisons of expenses, regulators generally require that funds use the same formula to compute the expense ratio and publish the results.\n\n=== No-load fund ===\nIn the United States, a fund that calls itself \"[[no-load]]\" cannot charge a front-end load or back-end load under any circumstances and cannot charge a distribution and services fee greater than 0.25% of fund assets\n\n===Controversy regarding fees and expenses===\nCritics of the fund industry argue that fund expenses are too high. They believe that the market for mutual funds is not competitive and that there are many hidden fees, so that it is difficult for investors to reduce the fees that they pay. They argue that the most effective way for investors to raise the returns they earn from mutual funds is to invest in funds with low expense ratios.\n\nFund managers counter that fees are determined by a highly competitive market and, therefore, reflect the value that investors attribute to the service provided. They also note that fees are clearly disclosed.\n\n== Definitions of key terms ==\n\n===Average annual total return===\nMutual funds in the United States are required to report the average annual compounded rates of return for one-, five-and ten year-periods using the following formula:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-7512f.htm#E12E2|title=Final Rule: Registration Form Used by Open-End Management Investment Companies: Sample Form and instructions|date=March 23, 1998|publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)}}</ref>\n\nP(1+T)<sup>n</sup> = ERV\n\nWhere:\n\nP = a hypothetical initial payment of $1,000\n\nT = average annual total return\n\nn = number of years\n\nERV = ending redeemable value of a hypothetical $1,000 payment made at the beginning of the one-, five-, or ten-year periods at the end of the one-, five-, or ten-year periods (or fractional portion).\n\n=== Market capitalization ===\nMarket capitalization equals the number of a company's shares outstanding multiplied by the market price of the stock. Market capitalization is an indication of the size of a company. Typical ranges of market capitalizations are:\n\n* Mega cap - companies worth $200 billion or more\n* Big/large cap - companies worth between $10 billion and $200 billion\n* Mid cap - companies worth between $2 billion and $10 billion\n* Small cap - companies worth between $300 million and $2 billion\n* Micro cap - companies worth between $50 million and $300 million\n* Nano cap - companies worth less than $50 million\n\n===Net asset value===\n{{Main|Net asset value}}\nA fund's net asset value (NAV) equals the current market value of a fund's holdings minus the fund's liabilities (this figure may also be referred to as the fund's \"net assets\"). It is usually expressed as a per-share amount, computed by dividing net assets by the number of fund shares outstanding. Funds must compute their net asset value according to the rules set forth in their prospectuses. Most compute their NAV at the end of each business day.\n\nValuing the securities held in a fund's portfolio is often the most difficult part of calculating net asset value. The fund's board typically oversees security valuation.\n\n=== Share classes ===\nA single mutual fund may give investors a choice of different combinations of front-end loads, back-end loads and distribution and services fee, by offering several different types of shares, known as share classes. All of them invest in the same portfolio of securities, but each has different expenses and, therefore, a different net asset value and different performance results. Some of these share classes may be available only to certain types of investors.\n\nTypical share classes for funds sold through brokers or other intermediaries in the United States are:\n* '''Class A''' shares usually charge a front-end sales load together with a small distribution and services fee.\n* '''Class B''' shares usually do not have a front-end sales load; rather, they have a high [[Deferred sales charge|contingent deferred sales charge]] (CDSC) that gradually declines over several years, combined with a high [[12b-1]] fee. Class B shares usually convert automatically to Class A shares after they have been held for a certain period.\n* '''Class C''' shares usually have a high distribution and services fee and a modest contingent deferred sales charge that is discontinued after one or two years. Class C shares usually do not convert to another class. They are often called \"level load\" shares.\n* '''Class I''' are usually subject to very high minimum investment requirements and are, therefore, known as \"institutional\" shares. They are no-load shares.\n* '''Class R''' are usually for use in retirement plans such as [[401(k)]] plans. They typically do not charge loads, but do charge a small distribution and services fee.\nNo-load funds in the United States often have two classes of shares:\n* '''Class I''' shares do not charge a distribution and services fee\n* '''Class N''' shares charge a distribution and services fee of no more than 0.25% of fund assets\nNeither class of shares typically charges a front-end or back-end load.\n\n=== Portfolio Turnover ===\n''Portfolio Turnover'' is a measure of the volume of a fund's securities trading. It is expressed as a percentage of average market value of the portfolio's long-term securities. Turnover is the lesser of a fund's purchases or sales during a given year divided by average long-term securities market value for the same period. If the period is less than a year, turnover is generally annualized.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n\n* [[Active management]]\n* [[Fund derivative]]\n* [[Global assets under management]]\n* [[Index fund]]\n* [[Lipper average]]\n* [[List of mutual-fund families in Canada]]\n* [[List of mutual-fund families in the United States]]\n* [[List of US mutual funds by assets under management|List of U.S. mutual funds by assets under management]]\n* [[Money fund]]\n* [[Collective trust fund]]\n* [[Mutual funds in India]]\n* [[Mutual-fund scandal (2003)]]\n* [[Operation Perfect Hedge]]\n<!-- * [[Real estate fund]] -->\n* [[Retirement plans in the United States]]\n* [[Rights of accumulation]]\n* [[Separately managed account]]\n* [[Value investing]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yYhBgAAQBAj|title=The Fund Industry: How Your Money is Managed|date=2015|publisher=Wiley Finance|isbn=978-1118929940|edition=2nd|location=Hoboken, NJ|author1=Robert Pozen|author2=Theresa Hamacher}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Thomas P.
