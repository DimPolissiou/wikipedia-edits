Amongst the many roles she created were Almazie in [[Nicol\u00f2 Isouard|Isouard]]'s ''Aladin ou La lampe merveilleuse'' and Aurora in Carafa's ''[[La belle au bois dormant (Carafa)|La belle au bois dormant]]''.\n\n==Life and career==\nGrassari was born Marie-Caroline-Josephine G\u00e9rard in [[Tongeren]], Belgium, where she was baptised on 15 June 1795. Her father was {{ill|Fran\u00e7ois Joseph G\u00e9rard |fr}}, a highly decorated French general. Her mother,  Anne-Christine Tournay, was the daughter of Tongeren's [[Burgomaster]]. Her parents divorced in her childhood and she initially lived with her mother in Belgium, where she began her musical studies. In 1814, she was sent to Paris under the care of her father and finished her studies at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]].<ref name=\"Gregoire\" /><ref name=\"Cancan\" /><ref name = Fetis />\n\nShe made her stage debut under the name \"Mademoiselle Grassari\" at the [[Paris Op\u00e9ra]] on 13 February 1816 singing Antigone in Sacchini's ''[[\u0152dipe \u00e0 Colone]]''. She was then given a permanent position at the Op\u00e9ra as ''premier remplacement'', singing the roles of the primadonnas when they were unavailable as well as secondary roles. However, she soon rose to the first rank of singers and went on to create numerous leading roles for the company, including Aurora in Carafa's ''[[La belle au bois dormant (Carafa)|La belle au bois dormant]]'' and Elzire in Liszt's ''[[Don Sanche]]''. In April 1819 she also sang in the Op\u00e9ra's first and only performance of [[Maximilian Stadler]]'s oratorio ''La D\u00e9livrance de J\u00e9rusalem''.{{efn|The other soloists in the performance of ''La D\u00e9livrance de J\u00e9rusalem'' were the tenor Jean-Baptiste Lecomte and the bass [[Nicolas Levasseur]].<ref name=\"Buguet\" />}} Grassari was described in contemporary accounts as uniting a beautiful voice with compelling acting and a charming stage presence. She was particularly admired for her performances as Amazily in Spontini's ''[[Fernand Cortez]]'' and the title role in M\u00e9hul's ''[[Stratonice (opera)|Stratonice]]''.<ref name = Alhoy /><ref name=\"ICC\" /><ref name = Fetis />\n\nOne of Grassari's last performances at the Op\u00e9ra was in May 1827 as Pamina in ''Les myst\u00e8res d'Isis'', a [[Pasticcio|pastiche opera]] by [[Ludwig Wenzel Lachnith]] based on the story of Mozart's ''[[Die Zauberfl\u00f6te]]''. Faced with enormous deficits in 1828, \u00c9mile Lubbert, the new director of the Op\u00e9ra, gave notice to [[Henri-\u00c9tienne D\u00e9rivis]] that his contract would not be renewed and asked Grassari to retire early. She was paid 30,000 francs to cancel her contract. According to her father's death certificate, she was still alive when he died in September 1832. Earlier that year articles had appeared in ''Gazette des Tribunaux'' and ''Giornale del Regno delle Due Sicilie'' describing a lawsuit which she brought against her former protector and lover, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Levrat,{{efn|Prior to his relationship with Grassari, Levrat had been the protector of Jos\u00e9phine Rolandeau (1774\u20131809), a singer at the [[Op\u00e9ra-Comique]].<ref name=\"SClub\" /> For more on the role of \"protector\" in the theatrical life in 19th-century France, see White, Kimberly (2018).

In Levrat's telling, he set her up in a luxurious house replete with [[Aubusson, Creuse#Tapestry|Aubusson]] carpets and crystal chandeliers, satisfied all of her \"whims\" which were both \"expensive and continuous\", invited her mother and siblings to move in with her, and also paid all their expenses. According to Levrat, once he found himself in financial difficulty twelve years later, Grassari was no longer happy to \"lavish him with her caresses\" as she had in the past and became simply a \"greedy woman\". The Commerce Tribunal ultimately dismissed the case on the grounds that it was an interpersonal dispute rather than commercial one and not within the court's purview. Grassari was ordered to pay Levrat's legal costs.<ref name=\"GdT1\" /><ref name=\"GdRdDS1\" />}} Apart from those articles, news of her disappeared completely from the French press after her retirement. [[Arthur Pougin]] wrote in 1906 that despite an extensive search, he was unable to find any publication of the date of her death, a fact which he found remarkable given her considerable fame during the twelve years she was on the stage.<ref name = AA /><ref name = White /><ref name=\"Death1\" /><ref name=\"GdT1\" /><ref name=\"GdRdDS1\" /><ref name=\"ICC\" />\n\n==Roles created==\nGrassari's performances in world premieres at the [[Paris Op\u00e9ra]] included:\n[[File:Grassari as Almazie in Aladin ou La lampe merveilleuse.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Grassari as Almasie in ''Aladin ou La lampe merveilleuse'']]\n*Parth\u00e9nope in ''Les dieux rivaux ou Les f\u00eates de Cyth\u00e8re'' ([[opera-ballet]] in 1 act) jointly composed by [[Henri-Montan Berton|Berton]], [[Rodolphe Kreutzer|Kreutzer]], [[Louis-Luc Loiseau de Persuis|Loiseau de Persuis]] and [[Gaspare Spontini|Spontini]]; 21 June 1816 (marking the marriage of the [[Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry|Duke of Berry]])<ref name = AA />\n*Alexis in ''Nathalie ou La famille russe'' (opera in 3 acts) composed by [[Antoine Reicha|Reicha]]; 30 July 1816<ref name=\"Laugier\" />\n*Aspasie in ''Aspasie et P\u00e9ricl\u00e8s'' (opera in 1 act) composed by [[Joseph Daussoigne-M\u00e9hul|Daussoigne-M\u00e9hul]]; 17 July 1820<ref name=\"Laugier\" />\n*Almasie in  ''Aladin ou La lampe merveilleuse'' (opera in 5 acts) composed by [[Nicolas Isouard|Isouard]]; 6 February 1822<ref name = AA />\n*Virginie in ''Virginie ou Les D\u00e9cemvirs'' (opera in 3 acts) composed by Berton; 11 June 1823\n*Lasth\u00e9nie in ''Lasth\u00e9nie'' (opera in 1 act) composed by [[Ferdinand H\u00e9rold|H\u00e9rold]]; 8 September 1823<ref name=\"Laugier\" />\n*La Reine in ''Vend\u00f4me en Espagne'' (opera in 1 act) jointly composed by [[Daniel-Fran\u00e7ois-Esprit Auber|Auber]] and H\u00e9rold; 5 December 1823 (marking the return of the  [[Charles X of France|Duke of Angoul\u00eame]] from Spain)<ref name = AA />\n*Z\u00e9naire in ''Ipsibo\u00e9'' (opera in 4 acts) composed by Kreutzer; 31 March 1824<ref name=\"Laugier\" />\n*Zul\u00e9ma in ''Les deux Salem'' (opera in 1 act) composed by Daussoigne-M\u00e9hul; 12 July 1824<ref name=\"Laugier\" />\n*Aurora in ''[[La belle au bois dormant (Carafa)|La belle au bois dormant]]'' (opera in 3 acts) composed by [[Michele Carafa|Carafa]]; 2 March 1825<ref name = AA />\n*Ph\u00e9dora in ''Pharamond'' (opera in 3 acts) jointly composed by [[Fran\u00e7ois Adrien Boieldieu|Boieldieu]], Berton, and Kreutzer; 10 June 1825 (marking the coronation of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]])<ref name = AA />\n*Elzire in ''[[Don Sanche|Don Sanche, ou Le ch\u00e2teau de l'amour]]'' (opera in 1 act) composed by [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]; 17 October 1825<ref name=\"ICC\" />\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name = White>White, Kimberly (2018).

Amongst the many roles she created were Almazie in [[Nicol\u00f2 Isouard|Isouard]]'s ''Aladin ou La lampe merveilleuse'' and Aurora in Carafa's ''[[La belle au bois dormant (Carafa)|La belle au bois dormant]]''.\n==Life and career== \nGrassari was born Marie-Caroline-Josephine G\u00e9rard in [[Tongeren]], Belgium, where she was baptised on 15 June 1795. Her father was {{ill|Fran\u00e7ois Joseph G\u00e9rard |fr}}, a highly decorated French general. Her mother,  Anne-Christine Tournay, was the daughter of Tongeren's [[Burgomaster]]. Her parents divorced in her childhood and she initially lived with her mother in Belgium, where she began her musical studies. In 1814, she was sent to Paris under the care of her father and finished her studies at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]].<ref name=\"Gregoire\" /><ref name=\"Cancan\" /><ref name = Fetis /> \n\nShe made her stage debut under the name \"Mademoiselle Grassari\" at the [[Paris Op\u00e9ra]] on 13 February 1816 singing Antigone in Sacchini's ''[[\u0152dipe \u00e0 Colone]]''. She was then given a permanent position at the Op\u00e9ra as ''premier remplacement'', singing the roles of the primadonnas when they were unavailable as well as secondary roles. However, she soon rose to the first rank of singers and went on to create numerous leading roles for the company, including Aurora in Carafa's ''[[La belle au bois dormant (Carafa)|La belle au bois dormant]]'' and Elzire in Liszt's ''[[Don Sanche]]''. In April 1819 she also sang in the Op\u00e9ra's first and only performance of [[Maximilian Stadler]]'s oratorio ''La D\u00e9livrance de J\u00e9rusalem''.{{efn|The other soloists in the performance of ''La D\u00e9livrance de J\u00e9rusalem'' were the tenor Jean-Baptiste Lecomte and the bass [[Nicolas Levasseur]].<ref name=\"Buguet\" />}} Grassari was described in contemporary accounts as uniting a beautiful voice with compelling acting and a charming stage presence. She was particularly admired for her performances as Amazily in Spontini's ''[[Fernand Cortez]]'' and the title role in M\u00e9hul's ''[[Stratonice (opera)|Stratonice]]''.<ref name = Alhoy /><ref name=\"ICC\" /><ref name = Fetis />  \n\nOne of Grassari's last performances at the Op\u00e9ra was in May 1827 as Pamina in ''Les myst\u00e8res d'Isis'', a [[Pasticcio|pastiche opera]] by [[Ludwig Wenzel Lachnith]] based on the story of Mozart's ''[[Die Zauberfl\u00f6te]]''. Faced with enormous deficits in 1828, \u00c9mile Lubbert, the new director of the Op\u00e9ra, gave notice to [[Henri-\u00c9tienne D\u00e9rivis]] that his contract would not be renewed and asked Grassari to retire early. She was paid 30,000 francs to cancel her contract. According to her father's death certificate, she was still alive when he died in September 1832. Earlier that year articles had appeared in ''Gazette des Tribunaux'' and ''Giornale del Regno delle Due Sicilie'' describing a lawsuit which she brought against her former protector and lover, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Levrat,{{efn|Prior to his relationship with Grassari, Levrat had been the protector of Jos\u00e9phine Rolandeau (1774\u20131809), a singer at the [[Op\u00e9ra-Comique]].<ref name=\"SClub\" /> For more on the role of \"protector\" in the theatrical life in 19th-century France, see White, Kimberly (2018).

In Levrat's telling, he set her up in a luxurious house replete with [[Aubusson, Creuse#Tapestry|Aubusson]] carpets and crystal chandeliers, satisfied all of her \"whims\" which were both \"expensive and continuous\", invited her mother and siblings to move in with her, and also paid all their expenses. According to Levrat, once he found himself in financial difficulty twelve years later, Grassari was no longer happy to \"lavish him with her caresses\" as she had in the past and became simply a \"greedy woman\". The Commerce Tribunal ultimately dismissed the case on the grounds that it was an interpersonal dispute rather than commercial one and not within the court's purview. Grassari was ordered to pay Levrat's legal costs.<ref name=\"GdT1\" /><ref name=\"GdRdDS1\" />}} Apart from those articles, news of her disappeared completely from the French press after her retirement. [[Arthur Pougin]] wrote in 1906 that despite an extensive search, he was unable to find any publication of the date of her death, a fact which he found remarkable given her considerable fame during the twelve years she was on the stage.<ref name = AA /><ref name = White /><ref name=\"Death1\" /><ref name=\"GdT1\" /><ref name=\"GdRdDS1\" /><ref name=\"ICC\" />\n\n==Roles created==\nGrassari's performances in world premieres at the [[Paris Op\u00e9ra]] included:\n[[File:Grassari as Almazie in Aladin ou La lampe merveilleuse.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Grassari as Almasie in  ''Aladin ou La lampe merveilleuse'']]\n*Parth\u00e9nope in ''Les dieux rivaux ou Les f\u00eates de Cyth\u00e8re'' ([[opera-ballet]] in 1 act) jointly composed by [[Henri-Montan Berton|Berton]], [[Rodolphe Kreutzer|Kreutzer]], [[Louis-Luc Loiseau de Persuis|Loiseau de Persuis]] and [[Gaspare Spontini|Spontini]]; 21 June 1816 (marking the marriage of the [[Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry|Duke of Berry]])<ref name = AA />\n*Alexis in ''Nathalie ou La famille russe'' (opera in 3 acts) composed by [[Antoine Reicha|Reicha]]; 30 July 1816<ref name=\"Laugier\" />\n*Aspasie in ''Aspasie et P\u00e9ricl\u00e8s'' (opera in 1 act) composed by [[Joseph Daussoigne-M\u00e9hul|Daussoigne-M\u00e9hul]]; 17 July 1820<ref name=\"Laugier\" />\n*Almasie in  ''Aladin ou La lampe merveilleuse'' (opera in 5 acts) composed by [[Nicolas Isouard|Isouard]]; 6 February 1822<ref name = AA />\n*Virginie in ''Virginie ou Les D\u00e9cemvirs'' (opera in 3 acts) composed by Berton; 11 June 1823\n*Lasth\u00e9nie in ''Lasth\u00e9nie'' (opera in 1 act) composed by [[Ferdinand H\u00e9rold|H\u00e9rold]]; 8 September 1823<ref name=\"Laugier\" />\n*La Reine in ''Vend\u00f4me en Espagne'' (opera in 1 act) jointly composed by [[Daniel-Fran\u00e7ois-Esprit Auber|Auber]] and H\u00e9rold; 5 December 1823 (marking the return of the  [[Charles X of France|Duke of Angoul\u00eame]] from Spain)<ref name = AA />\n*Z\u00e9naire in ''Ipsibo\u00e9'' (opera in 4 acts) composed by Kreutzer; 31 March 1824<ref name=\"Laugier\" />\n*Zul\u00e9ma in ''Les deux Salem'' (opera in 1 act) composed by Daussoigne-M\u00e9hul; 12 July 1824<ref name=\"Laugier\" />\n*Aurora in ''[[La belle au bois dormant (Carafa)|La belle au bois dormant]]'' (opera in 3 acts) composed by [[Michele Carafa|Carafa]]; 2 March 1825<ref name = AA />\n*Ph\u00e9dora in ''Pharamond'' (opera in 3 acts) jointly composed by [[Fran\u00e7ois Adrien Boieldieu|Boieldieu]], Berton, and Kreutzer; 10 June 1825 (marking the coronation of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]])<ref name = AA />\n*Elzire in ''[[Don Sanche|Don Sanche, ou Le ch\u00e2teau de l'amour]]'' (opera in 1 act) composed by [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]; 17 October 1825<ref name=\"ICC\" />\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name = White>White, Kimberly (2018).

Hutchinson also stated that KGEO was not guilty of charges made by KTVQ owner Republic Television and Radio Company that channel 5 wanted to \"straddle\" its transmitter between Enid and Oklahoma City to serve both cities, as between 75% and 85% of television set owners in the Enid area had oriented their home antennas to receive signals from Oklahoma City and the new tower would provide improved reception in Enid by allowing the signal to propagate into the area at the same direction that these home antennas were aimed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Examiner Approves Second Tall Tower|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/55-OCR/1955-08-08-BC-OCR-Page-0084.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting-Telecasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=American Radio History|format=PDF|page=80|date=August 8, 1955|accessdate=October 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn December 15, the Commission denied motions by Republic Television and Radio (which was concerned that KGEO's move to the Crescent site would create unfair competition that would result in the shutdown of the bankrupt station) to set aside the recommendation to grant of the transmitter application as well as a petition to reopen the record and call attention to the issues the move would cause.<ref>{{cite web|title=Okla.

On cable, KOCO-DT2 is available on Cox Communications digital channel 222 in the Oklahoma City area, and on [[Suddenlink Communications]] systems throughout western Oklahoma. In addition to carrying MeTV programming, KOCO-DT2 is also designated as an alternate ABC affiliate, and carries network (and occasionally, syndicated) programs that KOCO must preempt to carry extended [[breaking news]] or [[severe weather]] coverage or special event programming on its main channel.\n\nKOCO launched a digital subchannel on virtual channel 5.2 in 2005, which originally carried a live feed of the station's Doppler radar\u2014then known as \"Advantage Doppler HD\" (now branded as \"First Alert Dual-Pol Doppler\")\u2014accompanied by an audio simulcast of [[NOAA Weather Radio]] station [[WXK85]]. In April 2008, the subchannel became an affiliate of [[The Local AccuWeather Channel]], under the brand \"First Alert Weather 24/7\". Alongside carrying regional and national forecast segments provided by the [[AccuWeather]]-operated network, KOCO also produced pre-recorded local forecast segments presented by meteorologists from the station's \"First Alert Weather\" team\u2014which were updated two to three times per day\u2014for the subchannel (the radar imagery and NOAA Weather Radio feed continued to be shown after the local forecast segments, along with serving as a transition segment between its AccuWeather and E/I programming).<ref>{{cite web|title=KOCO, AccuWeather to offer 24-hour weather in Oklahoma City|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/21660/koco-accuweather-to-offer-24hour-weather-in-oklahoma-city|website=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheck Media|date=April 16, 2008|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|title=KOCO-TV Partners with Local AccuWeather Channel to Offer 24-Hour Weather in Oklahoma City Market|url=https://www.accuweather.com/en/press/35227|website=[[AccuWeather]]|date=April 16, 2008|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref> In addition, KOCO-DT2 carried a half-hour block of syndicated children's programs compliant with FCC [[E/I|educational programming]] guidelines on Monday through Saturday afternoons, and was occasionally used to air special weather coverage from its sister stations during tropical weather events (in particular, in September 2008, it simulcast coverage of [[Hurricane Gustav]] from NBC-affiliated sister station [[WDSU]] in [[New Orleans]] to provide information on the storm for [[Louisiana]] residents who evacuated inland to Oklahoma City).\n\nOn January 24, 2011, KOCO-DT2 became an affiliate of [[This TV]], through an affiliation agreement between Hearst Television and network co-parent [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which handled affiliate distribution for the movie-focused network on behalf of original managing partner [[Weigel Broadcasting]] (as [[DHX Media|Cookie Jar Group]] programmed a daily [[Cookie Jar Toons|block of educational and entertainment-focused children's programs]] for This TV at the time, KOCO dropped the syndicated E/I programming that Hearst acquired for its stations' DT2 feeds to comply with educational content regulations for multicast services).\n\nOn July 24, 2012, Hearst Television and Weigel Broadcasting announced that Hearst had renewed affiliation agreements with MeTV for eight of the group's affiliates through 2015, and agreed to add the classic television network on digital subchannels of KOCO-TV and its sister stations in [[WCVB-TV|Boston]], [[WBAL-TV|Baltimore]], [[KCRA-TV|Sacramento]] and [[WXII-TV|Greensboro]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Me-TV Adds Five More Hearst Stations|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/60965/metv-adds-five-more-hearst-stations|website=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheck Media|date=July 24, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Where to Watch Me-TV: KOCO|url=http://metvnetwork.com/wherewatch.php?marketID=211|website=[[MeTV]]|publisher=[[Weigel Broadcasting]]|accessdate=October 1, 2012}}</ref> The This TV affiliation rights for the Oklahoma City affiliation were subsequently acquired by Family Broadcasting Group, then-owner of independent station [[KSBI]] (channel 52, now a MyNetworkTV affiliate); however, because KOCO's MeTV contract did not commence for another two weeks, KSBI was forced to share the This TV affiliation with KOCO-DT2 after KSBI-DT2 began carrying the latter network on September 17, 2012.

After it debuted a noon newscast in September 1978, the station aired ''[[All My Children]]'' (which ABC concurrently moved to the aforementioned slot with the [[soap opera]]'s expansion to a full hour) on a day-behind basis at 11:00&nbsp;a.m., which resulted in the preemption of ABC Daytime shows that normally occupied that hour in the [[Central Time Zone]] (such as the network version of ''[[Family Feud#1976\u201385|Family Feud]]'') until it was ceded to ABC's affiliates in September 1992; KOCO began carrying ''AMC'' live-to-air at noon on January 2, 2008, where the soap remained until it was replaced by ''[[The Chew]]'' on September 27, 2011. ''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]'' also aired mid-mornings on a one-day delay until September 1990, when the station replaced it with the hour-long version of ''[[Home (1988 TV program)|Home]]'' (which KOCO had aired in the talk show's optional half-hour abbreviated format since it debuted two years earlier);<ref name=\"oklahoman-koconewsteam\">{{cite web|title=KOCO News Team Listed|url=http://newsok.com/article/2327212|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=August 12, 1990|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref> KOCO preempted ABC's half-hour soap operas (''Loving'', ''[[The City (1995 TV series)|The City]]'' and, until the station began clearing it in September 1998, ''[[Port Charles]]'') for most of the 1990s in favor of first-run syndicated shows and, after September 1994, an expanded midday newscast in its standard network slot. Until ABC discontinued the afternoon newsbriefs in 2012, the station also did not clear the ''ABC News Brief''\u2014which aired during [[ABC Daytime]] programming\u2014in order to run additional local advertising.\n\nBeginning with the [[News magazine#Television|newsmagazine]]'s debut in February 1980, KOCO ran ''[[Nightline]]'' on a half-hour tape delay from the ABC network feed (at 11:00&nbsp;p.m.) to air syndicated ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' reruns following its late newscast. In the summer of 1983, station management sought ABC's permission to further delay ''Nightline'' by 90 minutes (to 12:30&nbsp;a.m.), so it could air ''[[Thicke of the Night]]'' after ''M*A*S*H'' once the syndicated late-night talk show premiered that September. ABC vetoed the request and moved ''Nightline'' to then-independent station KOKH-TV, which agreed to carry the program live-to-air; KOCO relented and received permission to resume airing ''Nightline'' on a one-hour delay beginning in April 1984, pushing back the near-cancellation ''Thicke'' by an extra half-hour.

Because it signed off during the overnight hours at the time, KOCO also preempted the ABC News program ''World News Now'' from its January 6, 1992 premiere until the station permanently instituted a 24-hour schedule on November 28, 1993.\n\nChannel 5 also preempted portions of ABC's [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning]] lineup intermittently through September 2006 (as an example, ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show#Final Saturday morning years, 1985\u20132000|The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Ewoks|Ewoks]]'' were preempted in favor of the local [[real estate]] program ''Home Showcase'' in 1987).<ref>{{cite web|title=Home Showcase TV Show Premiers/Saves Time For Buyers|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P2-5394803|newspaper=[[The Journal Record]]|publisher=The Journal Record Publishing Company|via=Questia Online Library|date=May 2, 1987}}</ref> The station also preempted all but 90 minutes of the then four-hour-long lineup between April 1992 and September 1996, in order to accommodate a local Saturday morning newscast and other syndicated programming.<ref>{{cite news|title=Too Close for Comfort|url=http://newsok.com/article/2390944|author=Tim Chavez|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=April 12, 1992|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref> From September 1996 until December 2007, the ABC children's programs that were recommended to air during the 10:00&nbsp;a.m. hour aired instead on a one-week delay at 7:00&nbsp;a.m.; KOCO aired the remaining two hours in pattern from the ABC off-air feed. The various ''[[Power Rangers]]'' series that aired as part of the [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]] block were also aired on a one-week delay from 5:00 to 6:00&nbsp;a.m., instead of the network's \"live\"-fed slot during the 11:00&nbsp;a.m. hour, from September 2003 until September 2006; as Hearst's other ABC stations opted to do with the series, KOCO preempted ''Power Rangers'' thereafter until the series was dropped by the network on August 28, 2010 due to the program's lack of educational content. (For similar reasons, the station tape-delayed ''[[Kim Possible]]'' and ''[[Power Rangers SPD]]'' for broadcast on early Monday mornings before ''World News Now'' during the 2005\u201306 season.)\n\nIt was also among the more than 20 stations that declined to air ABC's November 2004 telecast of ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', amid concerns that the intense war violence and strong profanity retained from the 1998 [[World War II]]-set film's theatrical cut would subject stations that aired it to being fined by the FCC, which initiated a crackdown on indecent material following the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|wardrobe malfunction incident]] during [[Justin Timberlake]] and [[Janet Jackson]]'s [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] halftime show performance that February.<ref name=\"postgazette-privateryan\">{{cite news|title=TV Note: WTAE, other ABC affiliates reject 'Private Ryan' telecast|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/ae/tv/tv-note-wtae-other-abc-affiliates-reject-private-ryan-telecast-557996/|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|publisher=[[Block Communications]]|date=November 12, 2004|accessdate=February 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Scaring Private Ryan: 20 ABC Affiliates Nix Movie|url=http://businessjournaldaily.com/scaring-private-ryan-20-abc-affiliates-nix-movie-2004-11-12|periodical=Business Journal Daily|date=November 12, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109042125/http://businessjournaldaily.com/scaring-private-ryan-20-abc-affiliates-nix-movie-2004-11-12|archivedate=November 9, 2013}}</ref> KOCO, along with the eight other Hearst-owned ABC stations\u2014out of the eleven it owned at the time\u2014that also refused to air ''Saving Private Ryan'', chose to air the 1992 film ''[[Far and Away]]'' in its place.

Through ABC's television contract with the [[Big 12 Conference]], channel 5 serves as the primary over-the-air rightsholder to college football games involving the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|University of Oklahoma Sooners]] and the [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State Cowboys]]. The station's sports department also produces local [[pre-game show|pre-game]] and [[post-game show]]s that air around ABC-televised Sooners and Cowboys games, as well as a regular season preview show covering both teams that airs each August. (Over-the-air regular season Sooners and Cowboys games not shown on KOCO air instead on KOKH-TV by way of [[Fox College Football|Fox]]'s partial broadcast television rights to the Big 12.) In September 1982, after the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals]] issued a stay of a district court order that ruled network and cable contracts for college football telecasts reached by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) to be in violation of antitrust rules, the University of Oklahoma sold KOCO-TV the local television rights to a game between the Sooners and the [[USC Trojans football|USC Trojans]] under arrangement with the Katz Agency sports management firm.

(Katz subsequently sold the rights to the college football games and certain other sports events to [[Raycom Sports]] after the 1985 NCAA Division I college football season.) From 1988 to 1991 and again from 1993 to 1995, KOCO also maintained a programming agreement with the Sooners to air various team-related programs during the regular season, including the head coach's weekly analysis program ''Oklahoma Football'', which was co-hosted by then-[[sports director]] [[Dean Blevins]] and Sooners football coach [[Gary Gibbs]]. (Fox affiliate KOKH held the local rights to the Sooners magazine programs for the 1992 season, with KOCO carrying select Oklahoma State Cowboys programs such as analysis program ''The [[Pat Jones (American football)|Pat Jones]] Show'' in the interim.)<ref name=\"oklahoman-koconewsteam\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Tuning In...|url=http://newsok.com/article/2280122|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=September 17, 1989|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Blevins Due on ABC Broadcasts|url=http://newsok.com/article/2440340|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=August 29, 1993|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=High School Football Hits the Air|url=http://newsok.com/article/2405285|author=Dale Saviers|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=September 4, 1992|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1992 to 1994, KOCO carried select basketball games involving the city's now-defunct [[Continental Basketball Association]] (CBA) franchise, the [[Lawton-Fort Sill Cavalry|Oklahoma City Cavalry]], with Blevins also providing color commentary for the telecasts. Since the team's [[Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City|relocation from Seattle]] in [[2008\u201309 NBA season|2008]], under [[NBA on ABC|ABC's share of sister network ESPN's television contract]] with the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), channel 5 has also carried certain ABC-televised regular season and [[NBA playoffs|playoff]] games featuring the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]. Notably, in [[2012 NBA Finals|2012]], the station aired the Thunder's first [[NBA Finals]] appearance as an Oklahoma City-based franchise (their fourth overall, counting the pre-relocation [[Seattle SuperSonics]]' previous appearances in [[1978 NBA Finals|1978]], [[1979 NBA Finals|1979]] and [[1996 NBA Finals|1996]]), which saw the [[Miami Heat]] defeat the Thunder to win the championship title four games to one.\n\n==News operation==\n{{As of|September 2017}}, KOCO-TV broadcasts 34 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with five hours each weekday and 4\u00bd hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); the station also produces an additional 3\u00bd hours of newscasts each week (consisting of a half-hour each on weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays) for its MeTV-affiliated DT2 subchannel. During the fall months, channel 5 regularly preempts its early evening newscasts on Saturdays\u2014the 5:00&nbsp;p.m. edition since August 2009, and the 6:00&nbsp;p.m. edition, which had previously been subject to frequent overrun-related programming delays, since ABC bridged its football coverage upon shifting its [[Saturday Night Football]] telecasts a half-hour earlier in August 2019\u2014to accommodate ABC's college football game coverage. Through a content agreement with [[Community Newspaper Holdings]], KOCO also contributes news content featured in two of the group's Oklahoma newspaper properties, ''[[The Norman Transcript]]'' and the ''Enid News & Eagle''.\n\n===News department history===\nChannel 5's news department began operations when the station signed on as Enid-based KGEO-TV on July 2, 1954, initially consisting of a half-hour, weekday-only 12:30&nbsp;p.m. newscast. By the time the station moved to Oklahoma City in 1958, the re-called KOCO was running a five-minute newscast at 6:25&nbsp;p.m. and a half-hour newscast at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. each weeknight (later evolving into half-hour newscasts at 5:30&nbsp;p.m. weeknights and at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. seven nights a week by 1964). Ernie Schultz (who would later serve as a [[news director]] for WKY-TV and KWTV) served as the original main anchor of the Monday through Friday editions. As part of the condition of the station's license transfer to Oklahoma City that required it to maintain an auxiliary studio in its original city of license, KOCO maintained a news bureau at its original Randolph Street facility in Enid; the bureau would eventually be closed by station management in 1995. From September 1965 until September 1970, the station produced a Sunday evening news and features program, ''Sundayscope'', which also featured a regular viewer mail segment hosted by general manager Ben K. West.<ref>{{cite news|title=Oklahoma City television pioneer Ben K.

In 1974, as the ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' format was growing in popularity in television markets throughout the nation, KOCO-TV renamed its newscasts to ''Channel 5 Eyewitness News''. (It was the second station in the Oklahoma City market to have utilized the format, following a previous run at KWTV between 1966 and 1971; the format was later re-used by KOCO, as ''Eyewitness News 5'', from July 1998 to April 2013).

The format changes during the 1970s ultimately did not reward the station's newscasts with a ratings win, as KOCO remained at a distant third place in the ratings for many years against the then-long-dominant channel 4 and the perennially second-place KWTV. In 1977, KOCO began airing \"Wednesday's Child\", a weekly feature segment on its 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast that was presented by Jack Bowen (who served as an anchor/reporter at the station from 1974 to 1987 and again from 1990 to 1995<ref name=\"oklahoman-koconewsteam\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Bowen to Return to KOCO-TV|url=http://newsok.com/bowen-to-return-to-koco-tv/article/2323797|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=July 13, 1990|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref>), which profiled children in need of an adoptive family.

The station's newscasts\u2014then titled ''5 Alive NewsCenter'', eventually being shortened to ''5 Alive News'' in January 1984\u2014even battled longtime powerhouse KTVY for first in the market. On May 31, 1982, the station's early-evening newscast \u2013 which had been airing at 5:30&nbsp;p.m. (instead of the 6:00&nbsp;p.m. timeslot then used exclusively by most network stations, including some ABC affiliates) since September 1972, following ABC's initial 5:00&nbsp;p.m. Central Time feed of the ''ABC Evening News'' \u2013 was shifted to 5:00&nbsp;p.m., where it had previously aired from 1968 to 1972, and retitled ''Live at Five''. (Around this time, ABC had begun requiring affiliates located outside of the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone]]s to swap the airtimes of the successor ''[[ABC World News Tonight|World News Tonight]]'' and their local early evening newscasts \u2013 then also aired in that order on ABC's other Oklahoma-based affiliates, KTUL, KTEN and [[KSWO-TV]] in [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]] \u2013 to allow the former to compete directly with [[NBC Nightly News|NBC]] and [[CBS Evening News|CBS]]'s evening newscasts.) A separate half-hour newscast at 6:00&nbsp;p.m. (originally titled ''Newsplus at 6:00'') subsequently premiered on September 20 of that year. (All three broadcasts ranked the market's most-watched news programs in those time periods during the November 2006 [[Nielsen ratings#Sweeps|sweeps]] period.) In 1984, the station was sued for [[defamation]] by local [[obstetrics and gynaecology|OB-GYN]] William Crittendon, who claimed a report on a [[medical malpractice]] case he was being tried for had misquoted an expert witness who said that a patient had a \"perfectly healthy\" (rather than \"perfectly normal\") [[uterus]]; the [[Oklahoma Supreme Court]] ruled that station management must pay Crittendon $550,000 in damages; an appeal of the ruling, charging [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] violations, gained the support of the [[National Association of Broadcasters]], which contended that the court did not establish negligence or causation.<ref>{{cite web|title=NAB, NCTA lend support to First Amendment cases|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/84-OCR/BC-1984-03-12-OCR-Page-0059.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=American Radio History|format=PDF|page=59|date=March 12, 1984|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}<br>{{cite web|title=NAB, NCTA lend support to First Amendment cases|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/84-OCR/BC-1984-03-12-OCR-Page-0060.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=American Radio History|format=PDF|page=60|date=March 12, 1984|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe station also collaborated with ABC News' ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'' on the 1981 undercover investigative report \"[[Throwaway Kids]]\". Reported locally by then-assignment reporter Pam Henry, the investigative series\u2014which went on to earn [[Peabody Award|Peabody]] and Emmy Awards\u2014looked into abuse, neglect and preventable deaths of children, elderly and [[mental illness|mentally ill]] persons in the care of the [[Oklahoma Department of Human Services]] (OKDHS) that would lead to the resignation of agency director [[Lloyd E. Rader Sr.|Lloyd Rader]]. By 1983, channel 5's newscasts had settled into a solid second place as a series of anchor changes helped propel KWTV from a distant third all the way to first place, displacing KTVY from the #1 ratings position it held for decades. On September 12, 1983, the 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast adopted the ''Newscope'' format, a customizable syndicated news concept for local stations that featured local perspectives on major national and international news stories as well as consumer and entertainment news; KOCO reformatted the 5:00 show as a traditional local newscast after ''Newscope'' was discontinued nationally in September 1984.<ref name=\"oklahoman-newscope\"/> A main weakness of KOCO has been the turnover rate of its on-air news department staff. Massive staffing changes took place during 1984 under newly appointed vice president of news operations Gary Long (a former general manager at ex-sister station [[KARK-TV]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]). Anchors Mary Ruth Carleton and Gan Matthews, farm reporter Gene Wheatley, assignment reporter Jennifer Eve, and sports anchor Tony Sellars (the latter four of which had joined KWTV by the end of 1984) left or had their contracts not be renewed, while longtime weeknight meteorologist Fred Norman was shifted to the weekend evening newscasts, where he would remain until his retirement in 1987. In addition, Gerry Harris (who joined channel 5 from [[WTNH]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]) and meteorologist Wayne Shattuck (who had been working as a primary weather anchor at [[KDFW]] in Dallas for four years, following a prior stint at KOCO from 1977 to 1980) were hired to join Bowen and Park on the weeknight newscasts.<ref>{{cite news|title=KOCO's news team changes|url=http://newsok.com/article/2088631|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=November 18, 1984|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Channel 5 fills co-anchor spot|url=http://newsok.com/article/2086403|author=Glen Phillips|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=October 28, 1984|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=TV news staff changes made|url=http://newsok.com/article/2087179|author=Glen Phillips|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=November 4, 1984|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn an effort to improve KOCO's newscast ratings, which had declined to a distant third place over the preceding years as a result of the changes, the station lured away several anchors from rival KTVY, including [[Jane Anne Jayroe|Jane Jayroe]] (who, at the start of her first tenure at KOCO from 1978 to 1980, became the station's first female news anchor) and Jerry Adams (who replaced Bowen after he left channel 5 to replace Roger Cooper as KWTV's main co-anchor), both of whom joined Harris (who had been moved to the noon and 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscasts, and became a feature reporter for the nightly segment \"Oklahoma Pride\") as the station's primary evening anchors. Brothers [[Butch McCain|Butch]] and [[Ben McCain]] were also hired to anchor the noon newscast as well as a new hour-long weekday news and features program, ''Good Morning Oklahoma'', which debuted on August 3, 1987 and maintained a similar\u2014albeit slightly more news-driven\u2014format as their short-lived KTVY program ''AM Oklahoma''.

It also provided a weekdaily overnight news feed consisting of a simulcast of [[All News Channel]]'s overnight programming and additional content sourced from its then-sister stations WXIA in Atlanta and fellow ABC affiliate [[KUSA-TV]] (now an NBC affiliate) in [[Denver]]. Later that month, KOCO filed a trademark lawsuit against KFOR and its owner at the time, [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]]-based Palmer Communications, seeking $208,000 in damages and an injunction to stop KFOR from promoting itself as the \"24-Hour News <u>and Information Station</u>.\" KOCO representatives claimed that it had been the exclusive owner of the \"24-Hour News Source\" moniker in Oklahoma City since 1980, and KFOR's three-day jump in adopting the format and slogan upon its switch to a 24-hour schedule caused viewer confusion that denied KOCO immediate recognition with its rollout.

An hour-long extension of the station's weekend morning newscasts debuted on July 31, 2010, airing from 8:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. (The expansion coincided with ABC turning over one hour of its ABC Kids Saturday morning block, which would be replaced by Litton's Weekend Aventure that September, to its owned-and-operated and affiliated stations.)<ref>{{cite web|title=KOCO 5 Expands Weekend Morning News|url=http://www.koco.com/article/koco-5-expands-weekend-morning-news/4281821|website=KOCO-TV|publisher=Hearst Television|date=July 30, 2010|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref> This was followed on September 22, with the expansion of the weekday morning newscast to 4:30&nbsp;a.m., becoming the first television station in Oklahoma to expand its morning newscasts to a pre-5:00&nbsp;a.m. timeslot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koco.com/video/25106303/detail.html|website=KOCO-TV|publisher=Hearst Television|accessdate=October 19, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305202123/http://www.koco.com/video/25106303/detail.html|archivedate=March 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn April 18, 2013, KOCO became the third commercial station in Oklahoma City to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. (Prior to the move, KOCO utilized a [[pillarboxing|pillarboxed]] presentation for its newscasts from October 5, 2009 to October 11, 2010; the station transmitted in-studio segments in and upconverted field news video to the 16:9 widescreen format thereafter.) With the conversion to HD, KOCO implemented a standardized graphics package (designed by the Hearst graphics hub at [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] sister station [[WESH]]) and music package (\"Strive\" by inthegroovemusic) unveiled in November 2012 on Baltimore sister station WBAL-TV. On April 8, 2016, KOCO launched an hour-long, weekday newscast at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. (which, though not technically an extension of its 4:30\u20137:00&nbsp;a.m. newscast, uses that broadcast's on-air staff), and a nightly, half-hour 9:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast for KOCO-DT2 (which directly competes against a nightly hour-long newscast on KOKH-TV\u2014which debuted in May 1996 as Oklahoma City's first local prime time newscast, and is subject to overrun-caused delays by prime time [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]] game telecasts\u2014and a KFOR-produced half-hour newscast on KAUT-TV, which has aired only on weeknights since its June 2006 launch). (The latter program was part of an effort by Hearst around this timeframe to launch prime time newscasts on the MeTV subchannels of its non-duopoly stations.)<ref>{{cite web|title=KOCO Launching 9 A.M.

(The program is titled after ''[[Chronicle (American TV program)|Chronicle]]'', a half-hour weeknightly newsmagazine that debuted on Boston sister station WCVB-TV in January 1982, which has also loaned its title for use by other Hearst stations for daily or recurring newsmagazine programs that debuted during the second half of the 2010s.)\n\n===Weather coverage===\nAlthough not as well known as its two principal competitors in this arena, KOCO-TV has made continual efforts over the years to improve its coverage of severe weather affecting Oklahoma. The station's Doppler weather radar system, branded on-air as \"KOCO 5 First Alert Dual-Pol Doppler\", utilizes data from a radar site at the station's Britton Road studios as well as live [[Volumetric Imaging and Processing of Integrated Radar|VIPIR]] data from radars operated by regional [[National Weather Service]] forecast offices. KOCO's ''First Alert Weather'' meteorologists provide local weather updates and, in the event of significant severe weather situations (such as a [[tornado warning]]) affecting Central Oklahoma, audio simulcasts of long-form severe weather coverage for [[University of Oklahoma]]-owned [[NPR]] member station [[KGOU]] (106.3 FM) and Champlin Broadcasting-owned country radio station [[KNAH]] (99.7 FM). In addition, through a content agreement with Community Newspaper Holdings, KOCO also provides forecast data for the weather page inserts in the ''Enid News & Eagle'' and ''The Norman Transcript''. (Both newspapers erroneously continue to use the station's 1998\u20132013 news logo under the ''Eyewitness News 5'' brand in their forecast pages.)\n\nWhen Fred Norman was hired as the station's chief meteorologist in 1972, he became known among viewers for his quirky colloquialisms and lively on-air delivery, but also sought to improve channel 5's weather coverage. During the mid-to-late 1970s, the station offered \"Weather Watch\", a nightly post-sign-off feature consisting mainly of live imagery of the station's weather radar, along with any cut-ins from the station's meteorologists in the event that the National Weather Service issued severe weather alerts for the KOCO viewing area during the overnight sign-off period. Following the 1989 promotion of [[Mike Morgan (meteorologist)|Mike Morgan]] to chief meteorologist, following the departure of Wayne Shattuck (who was also succeeded in that capacity by Morgan at KFOR in 1993),<ref>{{cite news|title=Changes Announced|url=http://newsok.com/article/2298132|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=December 10, 1989|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref> KOCO's weather department invested the development of new technology to relay warnings and footage of inclement weather from the field. In July 1990, \"5 Alive WeatherTrack\" (later known as \"WeatherPhone 5\" until it was discontinued in 2004), a toll phone service providing local and worldwide weather information, was launched.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tuning In...|url=http://newsok.com/article/2320343|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=July 1, 1990|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, the station developed First Alert, the first automated weather warning system for television use (which was based on the manual-input [[First Warning]] system developed by KWTV around that time); it also assembled crews of storm chasing units, the \"First Alert Storm Teams\" (or \"F.A.S.T. units\"), which utilized custom vehicles equipped with video cameras and pioneering technology that enabled still photographs to be transmitted over cellular telephone using a dash-mounted computer combined with [[Data compression|photo compression]] codecs. Developed in conjunction with station engineers, chief photographer Chris Lee (who joined KOCO in 1977) and [[Cellular One]], \"First Pix\" was unveiled on April 9, 1992 to transmit photographs of a tornado. (\"First Pix\" as well as \"First Alert\" would earn the station a Regional News [[Emmy Award]] in 1991.) Morgan\u2014who was later sued for [[breach of contract]] and accusations of taking storm-related videotapes, computer programs and forecasting equipment without the station's permission\u2014left KOCO to become chief meteorologist at KFOR-TV in August 1992, and was later briefly replaced by former [[The Weather Channel|Weather Channel]] severe weather expert Vince Miller.<ref>{{cite news|title=KOCO-TV Sues Ex-weatherman|url=http://newsok.com/article/2408142|author=Judy Kuhlman|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=October 2, 1992|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Weather Expert Returns to State As KOCO's Chief Meteorologist|url=http://newsok.com/article/2416692|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=December 27, 1992|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref> During Miller's brief tenure, in April 1993, the station became the first in the United States to disseminate live storm footage utilizing [[Night vision#Night vision technologies|night vision technology]]. (This concept was later revived in 2015 as a feature of the \"First Alert Storm Command,\" a mobile storm tracking unit that contains a roof-mounted 360\u00b0 camera and a large monitor that is occasionally used to provide real-time radar data from the field.)\n\nAfter Rick Mitchell took over as chief meteorologist in 1994, it would become the first station to utilize a mobile Doppler radar system, to send video over cellular telephone (earning the station a Regional Emmy nomination) and to distribute full-screen video over cell phones. KOCO's coverage of an [[1999 Bridge Creek\u2013Moore tornado|F5 tornado]] that killed 36 people in several of Oklahoma City's southern suburbs on May 3, 1999 earned the station a special recognition award from [[Governor of Oklahoma|Governor]] [[Frank Keating]]. Mitchell remained with KOCO until July 2012, when he became an evening meteorologist at [[KXAS-TV]] in Dallas\u2013Fort Worth.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rick Mitchell leaving KOCO after 18 years|url=http://www.koco.com/article/rick-mitchell-leaving-koco-after-18-years/3775043|website=KOCO-TV|publisher=Hearst Television|date=July 20, 2012|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Meteorologist Rick Mitchell Set to Join KXAS|url=http://www.adweek.com/tvspy/meteorologist-rick-mitchell-set-to-join-kxas/55669|author=Merrill Knox|website=[[AdWeek|TVSpy]]|publisher=[[Mecklermedia|Mediabistro Holdings]]|date=July 17, 2012|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=KXAS Hires Meteorologist Rick Mitchell|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/60807/kxas-hires-meteorologist-rick-mitchell|website=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheck Media|date=July 16, 2012|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref> In March 2000, the station unveiled the \"Neighborhood Network,\" a network of sensors that relayed real-time weather observations from sites throughout central Oklahoma, and \"Predictor,\" which compiles computer model data to display hour-by-hour forecasts up to 48 hours in advance.<ref>{{cite news|title=KOCO-5 settles with former reporter|url=http://newsok.com/article/2692273|author=Mel Bracht|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=April 3, 2000|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref> In October 2012, Mitchell was succeeded by Damon Lane (who had been with the station since 2009 as a weekday morning meteorologist), who just eight months later on May 20, 2013, covered an [[2013 Moore tornado|EF5 tornado]] that killed 24 people in [[Moore, Oklahoma|Moore]], narrowly missing the home he lived in with wife Melissa Newton (formerly a reporter at KOCO from 2004 to 2006).

''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]'' also aired mid-mornings on a one-day delay until September 1990, when the station replaced it with the hour-long version of ''[[Home (1988 TV program)|Home]]'' (which KOCO had aired in the talk show's optional half-hour abbreviated format since it debuted two years earlier);<ref name=\"oklahoman-koconewsteam\">{{cite web|title=KOCO News Team Listed|url=http://newsok.com/article/2327212|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=August 12, 1990|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref> KOCO preempted ABC's half-hour soap operas (''Loving'', ''[[The City (1995 TV series)|The City]]'' and, until the station began clearing it in September 1998, ''[[Port Charles]]'') for most of the 1990s in favor of first-run syndicated shows and, after September 1994, an expanded midday newscast in its standard network slot. Until ABC discontinued the afternoon newsbriefs in 2012, the station also did not clear the ''ABC News Brief''\u2014which aired during [[ABC Daytime]] programming\u2014in order to run additional local advertising.\n\nBeginning with the [[News magazine#Television|newsmagazine]]'s debut in February 1980, KOCO ran ''[[Nightline]]'' on a half-hour tape delay from the ABC network feed (at 11:00&nbsp;p.m.) to air syndicated ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' reruns following its late newscast. In the summer of 1983, station management sought ABC's permission to further delay ''Nightline'' by 90 minutes (to 12:30&nbsp;a.m.), so it could air ''[[Thicke of the Night]]'' after ''M*A*S*H'' once the syndicated late-night talk show premiered that September. ABC vetoed the request and moved ''Nightline'' to then-independent station KOKH-TV, which agreed to carry the program live-to-air; KOCO relented and received permission to resume airing ''Nightline'' on a one-hour delay beginning in April 1984, pushing back the near-cancellation ''Thicke'' by an extra half-hour.

The station's sports department also produces local [[pre-game show|pre-game]] and [[post-game show]]s that air around ABC-televised Sooners and Cowboys games, as well as a regular season preview show covering both teams that airs each August.

Notably, in [[2012 NBA Finals|2012]], the station aired the Thunder's first [[NBA Finals]] appearance as an Oklahoma City-based franchise (their fourth overall, counting the pre-relocation [[Seattle SuperSonics]]' previous appearances in [[1978 NBA Finals|1978]], [[1979 NBA Finals|1979]] and [[1996 NBA Finals|1996]]), which saw the [[Miami Heat]] defeat the Thunder to win the championship title four games to one.\n\n==News operation==\n{{As of|September 2017}}, KOCO-TV broadcasts 34 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with five hours each weekday and 4\u00bd hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); the station also produces an additional 3\u00bd hours of newscasts each week (consisting of a half-hour each on weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays) for its MeTV-affiliated DT2 subchannel.

By the time the station moved to Oklahoma City in 1958, the re-called KOCO was running a five-minute newscast at 6:25&nbsp;p.m. and a half-hour newscast at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. each weeknight (later evolving into half-hour newscasts at 5:30&nbsp;p.m. weeknights and at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. seven nights a week by 1964). Ernie Schultz (who would later serve as a [[news director]] for WKY-TV and KWTV) served as the original main anchor of the Monday through Friday editions. As part of the condition of the station's license transfer to Oklahoma City that required it to maintain an auxiliary studio in its original city of license, KOCO maintained a news bureau at its original Randolph Street facility in Enid; the bureau would eventually be closed by station management in 1995. From September 1965 until September 1970, the station produced a Sunday evening news and features program, ''Sundayscope'', which also featured a regular viewer mail segment hosted by general manager Ben K. West.<ref>{{cite news|title=Oklahoma City television pioneer Ben K.

In 1974, as the ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' format was growing in popularity in television markets throughout the nation, KOCO-TV renamed its newscasts to ''Channel 5 Eyewitness News''. (It was the second station in the Oklahoma City market to have utilized the format, following a previous run at KWTV between 1966 and 1971; the format was later re-used by KOCO, as ''Eyewitness News 5'', from July 1998 to April 2013).

The format changes during the 1970s ultimately did not reward the station's newscasts with a ratings win, as KOCO remained at a distant third place in the ratings for many years against the then-long-dominant channel 4 and the perennially second-place KWTV. In 1977, KOCO began airing \"Wednesday's Child\", a weekly feature segment on its 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast that was presented by Jack Bowen (who served as an anchor/reporter at the station from 1974 to 1987 and again from 1990 to 1995<ref name=\"oklahoman-koconewsteam\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Bowen to Return to KOCO-TV|url=http://newsok.com/bowen-to-return-to-koco-tv/article/2323797|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=July 13, 1990|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref>), which profiled children in need of an adoptive family. In June 1979, while on assignment at a [[American Electric Power|Public Service Company of Oklahoma]] (PSO) [[press conference]], KOCO anchor/reporter Ron Stahl and photographer Bill Collard were arrested on a [[trespassing]] complaint after crossing a utility fence to cover a protest against the construction of a nuclear power plant in [[Inola, Oklahoma|Inola]]. Stahl (who contended that he and Collard would have been unable to return for the press conference in time had they chosen to hike more than {{convert|2|mi|km}} over rough terrain to reach a sanctioned area to view the demonstrators' arrests) and nine other reporters who were taken into custody\u2014including Tom Newcomb and Susie Welsh of KTVY, and Vicki Monks of KWTV\u2014were convicted and individually levied a $25 fine in January 1980. The convictions were appealed on [[Freedom of the press in the United States|press freedom]] infringement complaints, but were upheld by the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Western District of Oklahoma]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] declined to review the case upon consideration in January 1984, letting stand the convictions of Stahl and the other reporters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trespass convictions in Oklahoma set up precedential case|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/80-OCR/1980-01-21-BC-OCR-Page-0065.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=American Radio History|format=PDF|page=65|date=January 21, 1980|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Journalism wins one, loses one in Supreme Court|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/84-OCR/BC-1984-01-23-OCR-Page-0101.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=American Radio History|format=PDF|page=101|date=January 23, 1984|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref> \n\nKOCO's ratings fortunes improved from 1980 to 1982, when its newscasts briefly overtook KWTV for second place following the installment of Jack Bowen and Mary Ruth Carleton as its primary anchor team, alongside Norman and Park. The station's newscasts\u2014then titled ''5 Alive NewsCenter'', eventually being shortened to ''5 Alive News'' in January 1984\u2014even battled longtime powerhouse KTVY for first in the market. On May 31, 1982, the station's early-evening newscast \u2013 which had been airing at 5:30&nbsp;p.m. (instead of the 6:00&nbsp;p.m. timeslot then used exclusively by most network stations, including some ABC affiliates) since September 1972, following ABC's initial 5:00&nbsp;p.m. Central Time feed of the ''ABC Evening News'' \u2013 was shifted to 5:00&nbsp;p.m., where it had previously aired from 1968 to 1972, and retitled ''Live at Five''. (Around this time, ABC had begun requiring affiliates located outside of the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone]]s to swap the airtimes of the successor ''[[ABC World News Tonight|World News Tonight]]'' and their local early evening newscasts \u2013 then also aired in that order on ABC's other Oklahoma-based affiliates, KTUL, KTEN and [[KSWO-TV]] in [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]] \u2013 to allow the former to compete directly with [[NBC Nightly News|NBC]] and [[CBS Evening News|CBS]]'s evening newscasts.) A separate half-hour newscast at 6:00&nbsp;p.m. (originally titled ''Newsplus at 6:00'') subsequently premiered on September 20 of that year. (All three broadcasts ranked the market's most-watched news programs in those time periods during the November 2006 [[Nielsen ratings#Sweeps|sweeps]] period.) In 1984, the station was sued for [[defamation]] by local [[obstetrics and gynaecology|OB-GYN]] William Crittendon, who claimed a report on a [[medical malpractice]] case he was being tried for had misquoted an expert witness who said that a patient had a \"perfectly healthy\" (rather than \"perfectly normal\") [[uterus]]; the [[Oklahoma Supreme Court]] ruled that station management must pay Crittendon $550,000 in damages; an appeal of the ruling, charging [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] violations, gained the support of the [[National Association of Broadcasters]], which contended that the court did not establish negligence or causation.<ref>{{cite web|title=NAB, NCTA lend support to First Amendment cases|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/84-OCR/BC-1984-03-12-OCR-Page-0059.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=American Radio History|format=PDF|page=59|date=March 12, 1984|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}<br>{{cite web|title=NAB, NCTA lend support to First Amendment cases|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/84-OCR/BC-1984-03-12-OCR-Page-0060.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=American Radio History|format=PDF|page=60|date=March 12, 1984|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe station also collaborated with ABC News' ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'' on the 1981 undercover investigative report \"[[Throwaway Kids]]\". Reported locally by then-assignment reporter Pam Henry, the investigative series\u2014which went on to earn [[Peabody Award|Peabody]] and Emmy Awards\u2014looked into abuse, neglect and preventable deaths of children, elderly and [[mental illness|mentally ill]] persons in the care of the [[Oklahoma Department of Human Services]] (OKDHS) that would lead to the resignation of agency director [[Lloyd E. Rader Sr.|Lloyd Rader]]. By 1983, channel 5's newscasts had settled into a solid second place as a series of anchor changes helped propel KWTV from a distant third all the way to first place, displacing KTVY from the #1 ratings position it held for decades. On September 12, 1983, the 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast adopted the ''Newscope'' format, a customizable syndicated news concept for local stations that featured local perspectives on major national and international news stories as well as consumer and entertainment news; KOCO reformatted the 5:00 show as a traditional local newscast after ''Newscope'' was discontinued nationally in September 1984.<ref name=\"oklahoman-newscope\"/> A main weakness of KOCO has been the turnover rate of its on-air news department staff. Massive staffing changes took place during 1984 under newly appointed vice president of news operations Gary Long (a former general manager at ex-sister station [[KARK-TV]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]). Anchors Mary Ruth Carleton and Gan Matthews, farm reporter Gene Wheatley, assignment reporter Jennifer Eve, and sports anchor Tony Sellars (the latter four of which had joined KWTV by the end of 1984) left or had their contracts not be renewed, while longtime weeknight meteorologist Fred Norman was shifted to the weekend evening newscasts, where he would remain until his retirement in 1987. In addition, Gerry Harris (who joined channel 5 from [[WTNH]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]) and meteorologist Wayne Shattuck (who had been working as a primary weather anchor at [[KDFW]] in Dallas for four years, following a prior stint at KOCO from 1977 to 1980) were hired to join Bowen and Park on the weeknight newscasts.<ref>{{cite news|title=KOCO's news team changes|url=http://newsok.com/article/2088631|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=November 18, 1984|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Channel 5 fills co-anchor spot|url=http://newsok.com/article/2086403|author=Glen Phillips|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=October 28, 1984|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=TV news staff changes made|url=http://newsok.com/article/2087179|author=Glen Phillips|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=November 4, 1984|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn an effort to improve KOCO's newscast ratings, which had declined to a distant third place over the preceding years as a result of the changes, the station lured away several anchors from rival KTVY, including [[Jane Anne Jayroe|Jane Jayroe]] (who, at the start of her first tenure at KOCO from 1978 to 1980, became the station's first female news anchor) and Jerry Adams (who replaced Bowen after he left channel 5 to replace Roger Cooper as KWTV's main co-anchor), both of whom joined Harris (who had been moved to the noon and 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscasts, and became a feature reporter for the nightly segment \"Oklahoma Pride\") as the station's primary evening anchors.

(The newscast\u2014by then, reduced to two hours\u2014would shift to 8:00&nbsp;a.m. on September 9, 1995, and then to 10:00&nbsp;a.m. on September 13, 1997.) Then on September 11, 1995, the noon newscast was expanded to one hour, replacing first-run syndicated shows that had been occupying the 12:30 half-hour locally since the ABC soap opera ''[[Ryan's Hope]]'' ended in December 1988. (The midday newscast would revert to a half-hour on September 7, 1998 to accommodate the ABC soap opera ''Port Charles''.) The weekday morning newscast was expanded into a 90-minute broadcast (starting at 5:30&nbsp;a.m.) on February 2, 1998; it would subsequently expand again to two hours (starting at 5:00) on February 1, 1999. During the early- and mid-1990s, KOCO maintained an investigative unit\u2014known as the \"I-Team\"\u2014led by investigative and assignment reporter Terri Watkins, who worked at channel 5 from 1982 until she retired from broadcasting in 2006. During her tenure at KOCO, Watkins was nominated for and won multiple awards for her various reports including two Peabody Awards, several [[Edward R. Murrow Award (Radio Television Digital News Association)|Edward R.

In October 2009, KOCO upgraded its severe weather, school closings and news tickers to be overlaid on high definition programming without having to downconvert HD content to [[standard-definition television|standard definition]].

(Prior to the move, KOCO utilized a [[pillarboxing|pillarboxed]] presentation for its newscasts from October 5, 2009 to October 11, 2010; the station transmitted in-studio segments in and upconverted field news video to the 16:9 widescreen format thereafter.) With the conversion to HD, KOCO implemented a standardized graphics package (designed by the Hearst graphics hub at [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] sister station [[WESH]]) and music package (\"Strive\" by inthegroovemusic) unveiled in November 2012 on Baltimore sister station WBAL-TV. On April 8, 2016, KOCO launched an hour-long, weekday newscast at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. (which, though not technically an extension of its 4:30\u20137:00&nbsp;a.m. newscast, uses that broadcast's on-air staff), and a nightly, half-hour 9:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast for KOCO-DT2 (which directly competes against a nightly hour-long newscast on KOKH-TV\u2014which debuted in May 1996 as Oklahoma City's first local prime time newscast, and is subject to overrun-caused delays by prime time [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]] game telecasts\u2014and a KFOR-produced half-hour newscast on KAUT-TV, which has aired only on weeknights since its June 2006 launch).

(The program is titled after ''[[Chronicle (American TV program)|Chronicle]]'', a half-hour weeknightly newsmagazine that debuted on Boston sister station WCVB-TV in January 1982, which has also loaned its title for use by other Hearst stations for daily or recurring newsmagazine programs that debuted during the second half of the 2010s.)\n\n===Weather coverage===\nAlthough not as well known as its two principal competitors in this arena, KOCO-TV has made continual efforts over the years to improve its coverage of severe weather affecting Oklahoma. The station's Doppler weather radar system, branded on-air as \"KOCO 5 First Alert Dual-Pol Doppler\", utilizes data from a radar site at the station's Britton Road studios as well as live [[Volumetric Imaging and Processing of Integrated Radar|VIPIR]] data from radars operated by regional [[National Weather Service]] forecast offices. KOCO's ''First Alert Weather'' meteorologists provide local weather updates and, in the event of significant severe weather situations (such as a [[tornado warning]]) affecting Central Oklahoma, audio simulcasts of long-form severe weather coverage for [[University of Oklahoma]]-owned [[NPR]] member station [[KGOU]] (106.3 FM) and Champlin Broadcasting-owned country radio station [[KNAH]] (99.7 FM). In addition, through a content agreement with Community Newspaper Holdings, KOCO also provides forecast data for the weather page inserts in the ''Enid News & Eagle'' and ''The Norman Transcript''. (Both newspapers erroneously continue to use the station's 1998\u20132013 news logo under the ''Eyewitness News 5'' brand in their forecast pages.)\n\nWhen Fred Norman was hired as the station's chief meteorologist in 1972, he became known among viewers for his quirky colloquialisms and lively on-air delivery, but also sought to improve channel 5's weather coverage. During the mid-to-late 1970s, the station offered \"Weather Watch\", a nightly post-sign-off feature consisting mainly of live imagery of the station's weather radar, along with any cut-ins from the station's meteorologists in the event that the National Weather Service issued severe weather alerts for the KOCO viewing area during the overnight sign-off period. Following the 1989 promotion of [[Mike Morgan (meteorologist)|Mike Morgan]] to chief meteorologist, following the departure of Wayne Shattuck (who was also succeeded in that capacity by Morgan at KFOR in 1993),<ref>{{cite news|title=Changes Announced|url=http://newsok.com/article/2298132|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=December 10, 1989|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref> KOCO's weather department invested the development of new technology to relay warnings and footage of inclement weather from the field. In July 1990, \"5 Alive WeatherTrack\" (later known as \"WeatherPhone 5\" until it was discontinued in 2004), a toll phone service providing local and worldwide weather information, was launched.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tuning In...|url=http://newsok.com/article/2320343|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=July 1, 1990|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, the station developed First Alert, the first automated weather warning system for television use (which was based on the manual-input [[First Warning]] system developed by KWTV around that time); it also assembled crews of storm chasing units, the \"First Alert Storm Teams\" (or \"F.A.S.T. units\"), which utilized custom vehicles equipped with video cameras and pioneering technology that enabled still photographs to be transmitted over cellular telephone using a dash-mounted computer combined with [[Data compression|photo compression]] codecs. Developed in conjunction with station engineers, chief photographer Chris Lee (who joined KOCO in 1977) and [[Cellular One]], \"First Pix\" was unveiled on April 9, 1992 to transmit photographs of a tornado. (\"First Pix\" as well as \"First Alert\" would earn the station a Regional News [[Emmy Award]] in 1991.) Morgan\u2014who was later sued for [[breach of contract]] and accusations of taking storm-related videotapes, computer programs and forecasting equipment without the station's permission\u2014left KOCO to become chief meteorologist at KFOR-TV in August 1992, and was later briefly replaced by former [[The Weather Channel|Weather Channel]] severe weather expert Vince Miller.<ref>{{cite news|title=KOCO-TV Sues Ex-weatherman|url=http://newsok.com/article/2408142|author=Judy Kuhlman|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=October 2, 1992|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Weather Expert Returns to State As KOCO's Chief Meteorologist|url=http://newsok.com/article/2416692|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=December 27, 1992|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref> During Miller's brief tenure, in April 1993, the station became the first in the United States to disseminate live storm footage utilizing [[Night vision#Night vision technologies|night vision technology]].

KOCO's coverage of an [[1999 Bridge Creek\u2013Moore tornado|F5 tornado]] that killed 36 people in several of Oklahoma City's southern suburbs on May 3, 1999 earned the station a special recognition award from [[Governor of Oklahoma|Governor]] [[Frank Keating]].
