The main source of the fires is forested area being cleared to make room for new crops. The new crops to be planted after the smoke clears are not rice and vegetables to feed locals. A single crop is responsible: corn. \n\n\"The true source of the haze... sits in the boardrooms of corporations eager to expand production and profits.

The \"Mobike In\" project is sponsored by [[Advanced Info Service]] (Thailand's largest mobile phone operator), in collaboration with the  [[Tourism Authority of Thailand]] (Chiang Mai Office), together with local universities, public and private sectors. The project aims to promote non-motorised transportation and support eco-tourism. Speaking at the launch at the Lanna Folklife Museum, Deputy Governor Puttipong Sirimart stated that the introduction of such \"smart transportation\" was a positive move in Chiang Mai's transformation into a \"Smart City\" (part of the \"Thailand 4.0\" vision).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chiangmaicitylife.com/news/chiang-mai-get-500-smart-bikes-known-mobike/|title=Chiang Mai To Get 500 Smart Bikes, Known as MOBIKE IN|website=Citylife Chiang Mai|date=2018-01-19|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Smart agriculture ===\nPhongsak Ariyajitphaisal, DEPA's Chiang Mai branch manager, stated that one of the areas its smart city initiative would be promoting was \"smart agriculture\".

The university is also developing agricultural drones that can spray fertilizers and pesticides on crops which, if successful, will result in lower costs. The drones may also detect and monitor fires and smoke pollution.<ref name=BP-20170211/>\n\nUnder the 2011 IBM \"Smarter Cities Challenge\", IBM experts recommended smarter food initiatives focused on creating agricultural data for farmers, including price modelling, farmer-focused weather forecasting tools, an e-portal to help farmers align crop production with demand, as well as branding of Chiang Mai produce. Longer-term recommendations included implementing traceability, enabling the tracking of produce from farm to consumer, smarter irrigation as well as flood control and early warning systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://prd-ibm-smarter-cities-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/applications/chiang-mai-thailand-summary-2011.pdf|title=Chiang Mai Summary Report|website=IBM Smarter Cities Challenge|date=2011|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Smart healthcare ===\nAs part of the smart city project supported by IBM, Chiang Mai is also looking to use technology to boost its presence as a medical tourism hub.

Smoking greatly increases the lung cancer risk of asbestos exposure.<ref name=\"NIOSHResp\" />\n\nResidents and workers of asbestos mining centers such as the town of Asbest, Russia suffer dangerous exposure to asbestos and asbestos dust.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Higgins |first1=Andrew |title=In Asbest, Russia, Making Asbestos Great Again |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/07/world/europe/asbestos-russia-mine.html?fb=1&recb=published-assets-bq.thompson_sampling&recid=1JoKoqEu0Gyylgb90bst9PhvWiw&mi_u=72995439 |accessdate=13 April 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=7 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===BCME===\n{{main|BCME}}\n\nBCME (Bis(chloromethyl) ether) is associated with [[small cell lung cancer]] in workers who have been exposed.<ref name=\"NIOSHResp\" /><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.epa.gov/ncea/iris/subst/0375.htm |title = Bis(chloromethyl)ether (BCME) (CASRN 542-88-1) |work = IRIS (Integrated Risk Information System) |publisher = EPA |date = 31 October 2014 |accessdate = 31 March 2015}}</ref> Exposure can occur via direct manufacture of BCME or its presence as a byproduct.<ref name=\"NIOSHResp\" />\n\n===Beryllium===\n{{main|Beryllium}}\n\nBeryllium is classified as an IARC Group 1 carcinogen and can also cause interstitial lung disease. Manufacturing workers, dental technicians, machinists, jewelers, plumbers, electricians, precious metal reclamation workers, and welders are at risk for beryllium exposure.<ref name=\"NIOSHResp\" />\n\n===Cadmium===\n{{Main|Cadmium}}Cadmium is classified as an IARC Group 1 carcinogen and it is a cause of several cancers, including lung cancer. Workers can be exposed to cadmium through [[welding]], [[zinc smelting]], [[copper smelting]], [[lead smelting]], [[electroplating]], [[battery (electricity)|battery]] manufacture, [[plastics]] manufacture, and in [[alloying]].<ref name=\"NIOSHResp\" />\n\n===Chromium===\n{{Main|Chromium}}Chromium is classified as an IARC Group 1 carcinogen and is linked to lung cancer. Workers can be exposed to chromium via [[welding]], steel manufacturing, pigment/dye manufacturing, and electroplating.<ref name=\"NIOSHResp\" />\n\n===Coal dust===\n{{main|Coal dust}}\nExposure to [[coal dust]] is the cause of [[coalworker's pneumoconiosis]], also called \"black lung disease\", is an [[interstitial lung disease]] caused by long-term exposure (over 10 years) to [[coal dust]]. Symptoms include [[shortness of breath]] and lowered pulmonary function. It can be fatal when advanced. Between 1970\u20131974, prevalence of CWP among US coal miners who had worked over 25 years was 32%; the same group saw a prevalence of 9% in 2005\u20132006.It can also exacerbate or cause COPD.<ref name=\"NIOSHResp\" />\n\n===Diesel exhaust===\n{{Main|Diesel exhaust}}Diesel exhaust contains a variety of gaseous and particulate chemicals, including [[soot]], [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]], and other known carcinogens.<ref name=\"NIOSHResp\" />\n\n===Flock===\n{{main|Flocking (texture)}}\n\nFlocking is the technique of adding small pieces of nylon or other material to a backing, usually a textile, to create a contrasting texture.

Workers may be exposed to nickel in machining/grinding industry, nickel extraction/production, welding, and electroplating.<ref name=\"NIOSHResp\" />\n\n===Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons===\n{{Main|Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}}Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), fused-ring chemicals formed during the combustion of fossil fuels, are metabolized by the [[cytochrome P450]] complex to highly reactive [[carbocations]], which can mutate DNA and cause cancer. Workers may be exposed to PAHs while working in a [[foundry]], in the [[Roofing material|roofing]] industry, or due to [[environmental tobacco smoke]].<ref name=\"NIOSHResp\" />\n\n===Silica===\n{{main|Silica}}\nExposure to silica can cause [[Silicosis]], which is a fibrosing [[interstitial lung disease]] caused by inhaling fine particles of [[silica]], most commonly in the form of [[quartz]] or [[cristobalite]]. Short-term exposures of large amounts of silica or long-term (10 years or more) exposure of lower levels of silica can cause silicosis. In 1968, more than 1060 US workers died of silicosis; this number fell to 170 by 2005.<ref name=\"NIOSHResp\" />\n\nBesides causing [[silicosis]], inhalation of silica can cause or exacerbate COPD. It can also impair lung function in general and cause cancer by oxidation damage. It is classified as a \"known human carcinogen\" ([[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1 carcinogen]]) by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]]. Exposure is common for people working in tunneling, quarrying, construction, sandblasting, roadway repair, mining, and foundry work.<ref name=\"NIOSHResp\" />\n\n===Silo-filler's disease===\nSilo-filler's disease  (not to be confused with [[farmer's lung]] associated with inhalation of biologic dusts) results from inhalation of [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO<sub>2</sub>) gas from fresh [[silage]].  The presentation is variable depending on level of exposure.  Often the gas penetrates throughout the lung and if severe can manifest as a form of [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]], such as significant pulmonary edema, hyalinized alveolar membranes, congestion and other respiratory illnesses.<ref>Chan-Yeung M, Ashley MJ, Grzybowski S.

He tracks down the spirit but is not able to subdue it and the girl (under the spirit) plunges to her death and curses Ugr Pratap with the annihilation of his family. This horrible curse results in the brutal death of Ugr Pratap's innocent family and Ugr Pratap is accused of murdering them. The well meaning psychiatrist Dr Bharadwaj gets the court to send Ugr Pratap to a quiet psychiatric facility rather than the gallows. Dr Bharadwaj explains that he, too, often encounters paranormal patients who need spiritual rather than psychiatric help and Ugr Pratap is the only person who can help them.\n\nAyesha and Uday are a happily married couple living in Mumbai. One evening as they are returning from a party they are in a car crash, the other driver is thrown from her vehicle and smashes into their windshield and is killed on the spot. Some weeks later Uday gets a new project to revive a failing factory in Jabalpur (Uday's home town). Uday is excited to meet his old childhood friends and, more important, hopes that the change of place will help Ayesha recover from the shock from the accident.\n\nThey arrive in Jabalpur to a warm welcome from Uday's friends and Ayesha spends the next few weeks setting up the home and planning events and visits with friends: happy times. As time goes by strange things happen at the factory, machines inexplicably move and crash and employees are crushed, and at home, the gas range and toasters seem to have a will of their own. Ayesha is also perturbed by their immediate neighbors, the hot headed Manohar and his quietly suffering wife Urmi. The servant woman suggests consulting a local <em>baba</em> (healer and exorcist) who quickly concludes Ayesha is being attacked by an evil spirit. The <em>baba</em> suggests an exorcism but before this can be performed, the spirit, now angry, impales and kills the servant woman (with a deer head bust) and the <em>baba</em>. Around this time Ayesha's father hears about these strange events and quickly finds Ugr Pratap and sets off for Jabalpur.\n\nUday dismisses all the spirit theories and consults a doctor. Uday brings Ayesha to the factory hoping it will take her mind off the events. (Ayesha leaves their child, Sunny, with Urmi.) Ayesha notices that Uday's office has an old photograph of the factory manager and staff and among them are Manohar and Urmi. It is revealed that Manohar was the factory manager some sixty years ago and is now dead! Ayesha rushes back home in horror and runs into Urmi's house. It is uninhabited and dilapidated! Ayesha finds an old newspaper clipping which explains how Manohar was caught embezzling and was dismissed and arrested. Unable to bear this great dishonor, he poisoned his wife and child and himself. As this horrific truth dawns on Ayesha the spirits of Manohar and Urmi and their daughter show themselves. The spirit of Manohar bitterly says it will never let the factory carry on. And with that the three spirits possess Ayesha completely.\n\nAyesha returns home and now launches her reign of terror on the other servants. Her father and Ugr Pratap arrive just as Ayesha attacks Uday himself. Ugr Pratap fights back with his spiritual <em>kamandal</em>. There is a long battle as the spirit flees to the river bank and repeatedly attacks Ugr Pratap. Uday finally plunges the charmed <em>trisul</em> (trident) into Ayesha and dispatches all the spirits to the other worlds. The film ends as Uday and Ayesha return home and find their son nearly drowned but unhurt.

Access regulations requiring that trans athletes compete against athletes of the same [[Sex assignment|assigned sex at birth]] and requiring [[Sex verification in sports|sex verification testing]] have been used.

It is the third game in the ''[[Goemon (series)|Goemon]]'' series released in North America and Europe, following ''[[Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon]]'', released two years earlier. Featuring [[platform game]]play in [[2.5D]], it returns the series to a [[side-scrolling game|side-scrolling]] format.<ref name=\"nponline\">{{cite web | url=https://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=m-Game-0000-120 | publisher=Nintendo | work=[[Nintendo]] | title=Nintendo.com Review of Goemon's Great Adventure | accessdate=2007-01-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050816102525/http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=m-Game-0000-120 |archivedate = August 16, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe quirky story highlights Goemon's quest to stop the evil Bismaru, who has stolen Wise Man's resurrection machine. Goemon and his friends must journey through five worlds to battle the revived Dochuki, prince of the underworld, and destroy the captured device. Each world is designed with Japanese styles and themes, and ''Goemon's Great Adventure'' continues the series' tradition of offbeat, [[surreal humor]].<ref name=\"ignreview\">{{cite web | date=1999-10-12 |first=Peer|last=Schneider | url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/153/153758p1.html | publisher=IGN | work=[[IGN]]| title=Review: Goemon's Great Adventure | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref>\n\nThe game was received well, with more than 160,000 copies sold worldwide.<ref name=\"shrineofdata\">{{cite web | date=1997-11-05 | title=Nintendo 64 Best Selling Ranking | url=http://www5e.biglobe.ne.jp/~hokora/english/n64chart.html | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20050417033253/http://www5e.biglobe.ne.jp/~hokora/english/n64chart.html | archivedate=2005-04-17 | work=Shrine of Data Sales Database | accessdate=2007-01-11 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Reminiscent of older, [[16-bit]] games, the side-scrolling system was lauded by reviewers, who also praised the two-player cooperative mode.<ref name=\"ignreview\" /><ref name=\"npreview\">{{Cite book |date=April 1999 | author=Nintendo Power Staff | title=Nintendo Power April 1999 (Review of Goemon's Great Adventure) | publisher=Nintendo | page=119}}</ref> The game's vibrant graphics and musical score earned high marks as well. Reviewers have considered it the best side-scroller for the Nintendo 64.<ref name=\"npreview\" /><ref name=\"sandiego\" />\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Goemongreatadventure1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The protagonist Goemon moving horizontally through a three-dimensional landscape]]\n''Goemon's Great Adventure'' is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side scrolling]] [[platform game]] in which players navigate [[Level (computer and video games)|stages]]. Gameplay in ''Great Adventure'' more closely resembles that of the ''[[The Legend of the Mystical Ninja|Ganbare Goemon]]'' series' [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] entries, and abandons the free-roaming style of ''[[Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon]]''.<ref name=\"ignreview\" /> Although movement is restricted along a two-dimensional plane, the stages are rendered in [[3D computer graphics|three dimensions]] and frequently wind along the [[Cartesian coordinate system|z coordinate]]\u2014earning the game a [[2.5D]] status similar to ''[[Yoshi's Story]]'', ''[[Klonoa: Door To Phantomile]]'', and the ''[[Super Smash Bros. series|Super Smash Bros.]]'' series. The game begins on a [[Overworld|world map]] upon which several circles are placed indicating stages. Players must complete certain stages to open up paths to others, and each world map generally features one town and one [[dungeon crawl|dungeon]]. Completing a dungeon allows travel to a new world map, but the player must collect several entry passes to gain access to these structures. Passes are rewarded for completing stages and performing tasks for [[non-player character]]s in cities. Though the game is [[linearity|linear]] like its [[16-bit]] predecessors, certain non-linear elements exist\u2014such as a secret village and multiple paths through a world map.<ref name=\"ignreview\" />\n\n''Goemon's Great Adventure'' takes place in a fantastical version of [[Edo period]] Japan, featuring forests, mountains, dwellings, and [[underworld]]s designed with Japanese themes and a touch of [[science fiction]].<ref name=\"ignreview\" /> Individual stages are populated by monsters, obstacles, items (such as [[Ry\u014d]] currency or [[dumpling]]s), and occasionally [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]], who are stronger than most enemies. Players can run, jump, attack with weapons, and use various special abilities to reach the end of levels and gain entry passes. Four characters with three uniforms are available for play, including Goemon, Ebisumaru, Sasuke, and Yae. Characters can be changed in cities or in stages through portals to an interdimensional [[teahouse]].<ref name=\"npcoverage\">{{Cite book |date=April 1999 | author=Nintendo Power Staff | title=Nintendo Power April 1999 (Feature on Goemon's Great Adventure) | pages=52\u201360 | publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> Two players can play the game simultaneously, though they must both be visible on screen\u2014one player cannot advance if the other runs in a different direction. In each stage, a bar at the bottom of the screen displays information concerning character health, weapon equipped, lives remaining, and time of day. If a character is touched or attacked by a monster, a health bar is reduced from a total of three. If all bars disappear, the player loses a life and must restart the stage. The game ends if all lives are lost, at which point it reverts to the beginning or the last point at which the player saved his or her progress with a [[Controller pak]]. Defeated monsters sometimes leave behind dumplings and [[Maneki Neko]]\u2014the former replenishes health, and the latter upgrades weapons up to two levels above starting strength.\n\n''Goemon's Great Adventure'' features a system of [[day]] and [[night]]. Every two to three minutes, a meter in the information bar will slowly turn to evening or morning; the [[sky]] in a stage's background will similarly emulate the hues of a [[sunset]] or a [[sunrise]]. At night, more powerful and swift enemies challenge players.<ref name=\"ignreview\" /> However, they produce two Ry\u014d coins rather than one when killed. Different non-playable characters can be found at night in towns as well. Within these cities, players can purchase armor (represented by three blue bars), sleep in [[inn]]s and eat in [[restaurant]]s to recover strength, and perform [[quest (gaming)|miniature quests]] for entry passes. For example, the character Sasuke must help a man in Spook Village set off [[firework]]s for a festival. Scripted events relating to the game's storyline also take place in dwellings, and occur elsewhere before characters assault dungeons or after these special stages have been completed. The successful infiltration of a dungeon often leads to a battle between three giant [[mecha]] robots. These conflicts pitch the player, controlling the robots Impact and Lady Impact, against a villain and his or her robot of choice.<ref name=\"ignreview\" /> From the perspective of a cockpit behind Impact's eyes, players can punch, kick, grab, or fire nasal and beam weaponry at an enemy robot. Measures of health, enemy health, and ammunition are displayed in the cockpit. If the player's robot runs out of health, the game restarts at the beginning of the battle. To avoid this scenario, players can throw a baton to the other friendly robot; if it hits its mark, player perspective changes to the new robot who has his or her own health count. In two-player mode, one player waits while the other fights, and comes into play if the baton is passed. The penultimate conflict in the game is an Impact battle, and after winning a final fight in the normal side-scrolling mode the player can witness the ending of the game.\n\n==Characters==\nThe [[protagonist]] of ''Goemon's Great Adventure'' is Goemon, a [[ninja]] with blue, bushy hair who wields a [[kiseru]]. Goemon can jump higher than his friends, throw money, and use a chain pipe. His friends are Ebisumaru, Yae, and Sasuke.<ref name=\"ignpreview\">{{cite web | url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/123/123758p1.html | website=IGN | title=Goemon's Great Adventure (preview) | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> Ebisumaru is a fat man with a blue [[Kerchief|bandana]] and a love of food. Idolizing [[James Dean]] as the ultimate ninja, he can attack enemies with a decorative paddle, a magic megaphone that causes his shouts to turn to stone, and stomach gas.<ref name=\"nponline\" /> Yae is a green-haired female ninja, or [[kunoichi]], wielding a [[Katana]]. She has the ability to morph into a mermaid in order to swim underwater and use a [[bazooka]].<ref name=\"ignpreview\"/> Finally, Sasuke is a fast mechanical ninja who has upgradable projectile attacks such as [[shuriken]] and bombs.<ref name=\"ignpreview\"/> The villains of ''Goemon's Great Adventure'' are Bismaru and Dochuki<!--(Castlevania's Parody of Dracula)-->. Bismaru, a cross-dressing [[nun]] (who first appeared in ''[[Ganbare Goemon 3: Shishij\u016brokub\u0113 no Karakuri Manji Gatame|Ganbare Goemon 3]]''), steals Wise Man's resurrection machine to revive Dochuki, an ancient prince of the underworld.<ref name=\"ignreview\" /> While Bismaru fights with his giant robot, Dochuki confronts the party in person.\n\nNeutral characters include the Wise Man, Omitsu, Edo's Lord, Princess Yuki, and a young [[Catgirl (anime and manga)|cat girl]] named Suzaku, who assists Goemon and his friends with information. For battles with large foes, characters pilot the giant robots Impact and Miss Impact, created by the Wise Man to resemble Goemon and Omitsu. Finally, in every town, starting at Ryo, there is a fortune teller called Plasma. He gives the player hints as to the location of every entry pass in the area.\n\n==Plot==\nGoemon and his friends must stop Ebisumaru's descendant Bismaru, who plans to use one of the Old Wise Man's inventions in order to unleash another disaster. Specifically, the Old Wise Man (who has appeared in every game in the series) has created a \"ghost return machine\" that can bring the dead back to life. Bismaru is attempting to create an army of undead creatures for her master, Dochuki, the master of the underworld.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hg101.classicgaming.gamespy.com/goemon/goemon5.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210083517/http://hg101.classicgaming.gamespy.com/goemon/goemon5.htm | archivedate=2006-12-10 | publisher=Gamespy | title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Mystical Ninja / Ganbare Goemon | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> Enemies like ghosts, skeletons, and creatures from Japanese folklore have been unleashed and must be stopped.<ref name=\"ignpreview\"/>\n\nGoemon and Ebisumaru then, will travel around five different worlds, starting from Edo. In the local town, \"Lost'n Town\", Sasuke will join them. Later they will reach the Edo Castle, where they will try to save Omitsu, the King and his daughter from the robot Impact, himself. As they realize Impact was hypnotized by Bismaru, the princess of Edo reveals that Bismaru was attempting to reach some island.\n\nEventually, Goemon and allies reach Tortoise Island and find their final partner, Yae, who provides Sasuke with a \"diving device\". The team follows Bismaru to the second castle, which contains several underwater levels. After defeating Bismaru's robot, Bismaru turns to disappear again.\n\nA new neutral character appears, a mysterious female ghost named Susaku, who tells Goemon where Bismaru escaped: Mafu Island, an island full of undead, creepy ghost creatures in middle of the lava. In the local town, Goemon meets the Wise Man again, who reveals Bismaru's plan of returning the evil king Dochuki to the human world again.  The gang must head to the third castle just to realize that it's too late, and Dochuki is already alive.\n\nGoemon and his friends manage to get to the Underworld, where undead and ghost creatures reside, and destroy Wise Man's Machine in the Underworld Castle. Unable to stop Bismaru again, Susaku appears to give Goemon directions. This time, the scenario takes places in a Floating Island in the sky. Susaku also gives Goemon a container to catch Dochuki's soul.\n\nThe final castle, \"Dream Castle\", is a combination of the four previous castles, where the gang will find Susaku kidnapped by Dochuki, threatening to kill her if they don't give him the container. Goemon does so, having no option, and Dochuki breaks it with his hands.\n\nImpact and Dochuki's evil ghost-robot get into a fight. Eventually, Impact wins, and what appears to be the final encounter is a fight between Dochuki and Goemon. After being defeated, Dochuki shows his real form, a giant wolf which spits poisonous gas.\n\nDochuki is beaten and tries to escapes, as there is no container to catch him, but Ebisumaru \"farts\" and kills Dochuki's spirit, as Ebisumaru's gas mixed with the spirit.\n\nAfter the game is completed, Wise Man calls Goemon's gang to thank and tell them that he invented a new and more powerful machine to resurrect the dead, again. Suddenly, a baby appears from nowhere, and Ebisumaru claims that it's from him. Bismaru appears and tries to kidnap the new ghost return machine again, but the baby accidentally presses the machine's self-destruct button.\n\nAs in previous ''[[Ganbare Goemon]]'' games, the plot is wacky and lighthearted. Nintendo wrote that Goemon seems \"at ease roaming a medieval Japan bustling with robots, DJs, space ships and extra-hold mousse\".<ref name=\"nponline\" />\n\n==Promotion==\nKonami heavily promoted the ''Ganbare Goemon'' series for the [[Christmas]] season of [[1998 in video gaming|1998]], as three games were due to be released\u2014''Goemon's Great Adventure'' and the [[PlayStation]] release ''[[Ganbare Goemon: Kuru Nara Koi!

Goemon and his friends must journey through five worlds to battle the revived Dochuki, prince of the underworld, and destroy the captured device. Each world is designed with Japanese styles and themes, and ''Goemon's Great Adventure'' continues the series' tradition of offbeat, [[surreal humor]].<ref name=\"ignreview\">{{cite web | date=1999-10-12 |first=Peer|last=Schneider | url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/153/153758p1.html | publisher=IGN | work=[[IGN]]| title=Review: Goemon's Great Adventure | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref>\n\nThe game was received well, selling over 160,000 copies worldwide.<ref name=\"shrineofdata\">{{cite web | date=1997-11-05 | title=Nintendo 64 Best Selling Ranking | url=http://www5e.biglobe.ne.jp/~hokora/english/n64chart.html | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20050417033253/http://www5e.biglobe.ne.jp/~hokora/english/n64chart.html | archivedate=2005-04-17 | work=Shrine of Data Sales Database | accessdate=2007-01-11 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Reminiscent of older, [[16-bit]] games, the side-scrolling system was lauded by reviewers, who also praised the two-player cooperative mode.<ref name=\"ignreview\" /><ref name=\"npreview\">{{Cite book |date=April 1999 | author=Nintendo Power Staff | title=Nintendo Power April 1999 (Review of Goemon's Great Adventure) | publisher=Nintendo | page=119}}</ref> The game's vibrant graphics and musical score earned high marks as well. Reviewers have considered it the best side-scroller for the Nintendo 64.<ref name=\"npreview\" /><ref name=\"sandiego\" />\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Goemon's Great Adventure'' is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side scrolling]] [[platform game]] in which players navigate [[Level (computer and video games)|stages]]. Gameplay in ''Great Adventure'' more closely resembles that of the ''[[The Legend of the Mystical Ninja|Ganbare Goemon]]'' series' [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] entries, and abandons the free-roaming style of ''[[Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon]]''.<ref name=\"ignreview\" /> Although movement is restricted along a two-dimensional plane, the stages are rendered in [[3D computer graphics|three dimensions]] and frequently wind along the [[Cartesian coordinate system|z coordinate]]\u2014earning the game a ''[[2.5D]]'' status similar to ''[[Yoshi's Story]]'', ''[[Klonoa: Door To Phantomile]]'' and the ''[[Super Smash Bros. series|Super Smash Bros.]]'' series. The game begins on a [[Overworld|world map]] upon which several circles are placed indicating stages. Players must complete certain stages to open up paths to others, and each world map generally features one town and one [[dungeon crawl|dungeon]]. Completing a dungeon allows travel to a new world map, but the player must collect several entry passes to gain access to these structures. Passes are rewarded for completing stages and performing tasks for [[non-player character]]s in cities. Though the game is [[linearity|linear]] like its [[16-bit]] predecessors, certain non-linear elements exist\u2014such as a secret village and multiple paths through a world map.<ref name=\"ignreview\" />\n[[Image:Goemongreatadventure1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The protagonist Goemon moving horizontally through a three-dimensional landscape]]\n''Goemon's Great Adventure'' takes place in a fantastical version of [[Edo period]] Japan, featuring forests, mountains, dwellings, and [[underworld]]s designed with Japanese themes and a touch of [[science fiction]].<ref name=\"ignreview\" /> Individual stages are populated by monsters, obstacles, items (such as [[Ry\u014d]] currency or [[dumpling]]s), and occasionally [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]], who are stronger than most enemies. Players can run, jump, attack with weapons, and use various special abilities to reach the end of levels and gain entry passes. Four characters with three uniforms are available for play, including Goemon, Ebisumaru, Sasuke, and Yae. Characters can be changed in cities or in stages through portals to an interdimensional [[teahouse]].<ref name=\"npcoverage\">{{Cite book |date=April 1999 | author=Nintendo Power Staff | title=Nintendo Power April 1999 (Feature on Goemon's Great Adventure) | pages=52\u201360 | publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> Two players can play the game simultaneously, though they must both be visible on screen\u2014one player cannot advance if the other runs in a different direction. In each stage, a bar at the bottom of the screen displays information concerning character health, weapon equipped, lives remaining, and time of day. If a character is touched or attacked by a monster, a health bar is reduced from a total of three. If all bars disappear, the player loses a life and must restart the stage. The game ends if all lives are lost, at which point it reverts to the beginning or the last point at which the player saved his or her progress with a [[Controller pak]]. Defeated monsters sometimes leave behind dumplings and [[Maneki Neko]]\u2014the former replenishes health, and the latter upgrades weapons up to two levels above starting strength.\n\n''Goemon's Great Adventure'' also features a system of [[day]] and [[night]]. Every two to three minutes, a meter in the information bar will slowly turn to evening or morning; the [[sky]] in a stage's background will similarly emulate the hues of a [[sunset]] or a [[sunrise]]. At night, more powerful and swift enemies challenge players.<ref name=\"ignreview\" /> However, they produce two Ry\u014d coins rather than one when killed. Different non-playable characters can be found at night in towns as well. Within these cities, players can purchase armor (represented by three blue bars), sleep in [[inn]]s and eat in [[restaurant]]s to recover strength, and perform [[quest (gaming)|miniature quests]] for entry passes. For example, the character Sasuke must help a man in Spook Village set off [[firework]]s for a festival. Scripted events relating to the game's storyline also take place in dwellings, and occur elsewhere before characters assault dungeons or after these special stages have been completed. The successful infiltration of a dungeon often leads to a battle between three giant [[mecha]] robots. These conflicts pitch the player, controlling the robots Impact and Lady Impact, against a villain and his or her robot of choice.<ref name=\"ignreview\" /> From the perspective of a cockpit behind Impact's eyes, players can punch, kick, grab, or fire nasal and beam weaponry at an enemy robot. Measures of health, enemy health, and ammunition are displayed in the cockpit. If the player's robot runs out of health, the game restarts at the beginning of the battle. To avoid this scenario, players can throw a baton to the other friendly robot; if it hits its mark, player perspective changes to the new robot who has his or her own health count. In two-player mode, one player waits while the other fights, and comes into play if the baton is passed. The penultimate conflict in the game is an Impact battle, and after winning a final fight in the normal side-scrolling mode the player can witness the ending of the game.\n\n==Plot and characters==\n\n===Characters===\nThe [[protagonist]] of ''Goemon's Great Adventure'' is Goemon, a [[ninja]] with blue, bushy hair who wields a [[kiseru]]. Goemon can jump higher than his friends, throw money, and use a chain pipe. Goemon's friends Ebisumaru, Yae, and Sasuke feature once again in the game.<ref name=\"ignpreview\">{{cite web | url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/123/123758p1.html | website=IGN | title=Goemon's Great Adventure (preview) | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> Ebisumaru is a fat man with a blue [[Kerchief|bandana]] and a love of food. Idolizing [[James Dean]] as the ultimate ninja, he can attack enemies with a decorative paddle, a magic megaphone that causes his shouts to turn to stone, and stomach gas.<ref name=\"nponline\" /> Yae is a green-haired female ninja, or [[kunoichi]], wielding a [[Katana]]. She has the ability to morph into a mermaid in order to swim underwater and use a [[bazooka]].<ref name=\"ignpreview\"/> Finally, Sasuke is a fast mechanical ninja who has upgradable projectile attacks such as [[shuriken]] and bombs.<ref name=\"ignpreview\"/> The villains of ''Goemon's Great Adventure'' are Bismaru and Dochuki<!--(Castlevania's Parody of Dracula)-->. Bismaru, a cross-dressing [[nun]] (who first appeared in ''[[Ganbare Goemon 3: Shishij\u016brokub\u0113 no Karakuri Manji Gatame|Ganbare Goemon 3]]''), steals Wise Man's resurrection machine to revive Dochuki, an ancient prince of the underworld.<ref name=\"ignreview\" /> While Bismaru fights with his giant robot, Dochuki confronts the party in person.\n\nThere are also several neutral characters in the game. These include the Wise Man, Omitsu, Edo's Lord and Princess Yuki, and a young [[Catgirl (anime and manga)|cat girl]] named Suzaku, who assists Goemon and his friends with information. For battles with large foes, characters pilot the giant robots Impact and Miss Impact, created by the Wise Man to resemble Goemon and Omitsu. Finally, in every town, starting at Ryo, there is a fortune teller called Plasma. He gives the player hints as to the location of every entry pass in the area.\n\n===Plot===\nGoemon and his friends must stop Ebisumaru's descendant Bismaru, who plans to use one of the Old Wise Man's inventions in order to unleash another disaster. Specifically, the Old Wise Man (who has appeared in every game in the series) has created a \"ghost return machine\" that can bring the dead back to life.\nBismaru is attempting to create an army of undead creatures for her master, Dochuki, the master of the underworld.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hg101.classicgaming.gamespy.com/goemon/goemon5.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210083517/http://hg101.classicgaming.gamespy.com/goemon/goemon5.htm | archivedate=2006-12-10 | publisher=Gamespy | title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Mystical Ninja / Ganbare Goemon | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> Enemies like ghosts, skeletons, and creatures from Japanese folklore have been unleashed and must be stopped.<ref name=\"ignpreview\"/>\n\nGoemon and Ebisumaru then, will travel around five different worlds, starting from Edo. In the local town, \"Lost'n Town\", Sasuke will join them. Later they will reach the Edo Castle, where they will try to save Omitsu, the King and his daughter from the robot Impact, himself. As they realize Impact was hypnotized by Bismaru, the princess of Edo reveals that Bismaru was attempting to reach some island.\n\nEventually, Goemon and allies reach Tortoise Island and find their final partner, Yae, who provides Sasuke with a \"diving device\". The team follows Bismaru to the second castle, which contains several underwater levels. After defeating Bismaru's robot, Bismaru turns to disappear again.\n\nA new neutral character appears, a mysterious female ghost named Susaku, who tells Goemon where Bismaru escaped: Mafu Island, an island full of undead, creepy ghost creatures in middle of the lava. In the local town, Goemon meets the Wise Man again, who reveals Bismaru's plan of returning the evil king Dochuki to the human world again.  The gang must head to the third castle just to realize that it's too late, and Dochuki is already alive.\n\nGoemon and his friends manage to get to the Underworld, where undead and ghost creatures reside, and destroy Wise Man's Machine in the Underworld Castle. Unable to stop Bismaru again, Susaku appears to give Goemon directions. This time, the scenario takes places in a Floating Island in the sky. Susaku also gives Goemon a container to catch Dochuki's soul.\n\nThe final castle, \"Dream Castle\", is a combination of the four previous castles, where the gang will find Susaku kidnapped by Dochuki, threatening to kill her if they don't give him the container. Goemon does so, having no option, and Dochuki breaks it with his hands.\n\nImpact and Dochuki's evil ghost-robot get into a fight. Eventually, Impact wins, and what appears to be the final encounter is a fight between Dochuki and Goemon. After being defeated, Dochuki shows his real form, a giant wolf which spits poisonous gas.\n\nDochuki is beaten and tries to escapes, as there is no container to catch him, but Ebisumaru \"farts\" and kills Dochuki's spirit, as Ebisumaru's gas mixed with the spirit.\n\nAfter the game is completed, Wise Man calls Goemon's gang to thank and tell them that he invented a new and more powerful machine to resurrect the dead, again. Suddenly, a baby appears from nowhere, and Ebisumaru claims that it's from him. Bismaru appears and tries to kidnap the new ghost return machine again, but the baby accidentally presses the machine's self-destruct button.\n\nAs in previous [[Ganbare Goemon]] games, the plot is wacky and lighthearted. Nintendo wrote that Goemon seems \"at ease roaming a medieval Japan bustling with robots, DJs, space ships and extra-hold mousse.\"<ref name=\"nponline\" />\n\n==Promotion==\nKonami heavily promoted the ''Ganbare Goemon'' series for the [[Christmas]] season of [[1998 in video gaming|1998]], as three games were due to be released\u2014''Goemon's Great Adventure'' and the [[PlayStation]] release ''[[Ganbare Goemon: Kuru Nara Koi!

As they spend time together, they form a bond of trust, understanding and friendship. Prerna starts falling for Anurag. Meanwhile, Komolika Chaubey makes her entry. She is arrogant, evil and attracts male attention wherever she goes. While Anurag realises his feelings for Prerna, Komolika starts getting interested in him.\n\nAnurag and Prerna confess their feelings, plan to marry each other and consummate their relationship. Seeing Prerna and Anurag plan a future together, Komolika decides to create misunderstandings between them. She asks Anurag to marry her in order to save Prerna's house. Compelled, Anurag agrees. Unaware of the truth, Prerna is left shocked. She is hit by a car and is taken to the hospital where the doctor reveals her to be pregnant.\n\nHurt and rebellious, Prerna enters the Basu house, successfully exposes Komolika and gets her arrested. Komolika escapes and comes back to kill Prerna but instead falls down the terrace and goes missing. Anurag and Prerna reunite and get engaged.\n\nRishabh Bajaj, a ruthless and cunning businessman enters. He falsely frames Anurag and gets him jailed. Further, he asks Prerna to marry him in exchange of Anurag's freedom. Helpless, Prerna agrees. Heartbroken and devastated, Anurag questions Prerna. She lies to him, hoping he moves on but Anurag remains adamant and refuses to give up on their love.\n\nRishabh starts falling for Prerna. Knowing that Prerna is still in love with Anurag, Rishabh tries to kill him. Kukki tries to stop Rishabh but ends up getting hurt. Guilty, Rishabh steps back while Anurag and Prerna unite.\n\nVengeful, Komolika makes a comeback. Prerna reveals to Anurag about her pregnancy and the two rejoice as they get ready to marry. Komolika causes Anurag's accident.\n\n===One month later===\nAnurag loses his memory. Komolika fakes an identity and misuses the opportunity to make Anurag and the Basu's believe that they got married. Prerna discovers Komolika's identity and decides to expose her but chooses to refrain in fear of affecting Anurag's brain and memory. Komolika tries to kill Prerna and her child multiple times but fails.\n\nPrerna gives birth to Sneha and Anurag regains his memory. They rejoice and plan to marry. Komolika threatens to frame Prerna for murder by leaking footage of her pushing Viraj off the cliff. She further asks Anurag to accept her and leave Prerna. Helpless, Anurag pretends to betray Prerna and pushes her off a bridge, but she is saved by Rishabh. Prerna reaches the orphanage where Komolika abandoned Sneha and is devastated to see it on fire. Reeling from shock and heartbreak, Prerna moves to London with Rishabh.\n\n===Eight years later===\nPrerna is a successful businesswoman in London while Anurag's business thrives in Kolkata. Prerna maintains a formal relationship with Rishabh and Anurag hates Komolika. Prerna detests Anurag for his betrayal while he lives in guilt. Komolika has taken over the Basu house.

As they spend time together, they form a bond of trust, understanding and friendship. Prerna starts falling for Anurag. Meanwhile, Komolika Chaubey makes her entry. She is arrogant, evil and attracts male attention wherever she goes. While Anurag realises his feelings for Prerna, Komolika starts getting interested in him.\n\nAnurag and Prerna confess their feelings, plan to marry each other and consummate their relationship. Seeing Prerna and Anurag plan a future together, Komolika decides to create misunderstandings between them. She asks Anurag to marry her in order to save Prerna's house. Compelled, Anurag agrees. Unaware of the truth, Prerna is left shocked. She gets hit by a car and is taken to the hospital where the doctor reveals her to be pregnant.\n\nHurt and rebellious, Prerna enters the Basu house, successfully exposes Komolika and gets her arrested. Komolika escapes and comes back to kill Prerna but instead falls down the terrace and goes missing. Anurag and Prerna reunite and get engaged.\n\nRishabh Bajaj, a ruthless and cunning businessman enters. He falsely frames Anurag and gets him jailed. Further, he asks Prerna to marry him in exchange of Anurag's freedom. Helpless, Prerna agrees. Heartbroken and devastated, Anurag questions Prerna. She lies to him, hoping he moves on but Anurag remains adamant and refuses to give up on their love.\n\nRishabh starts falling for Prerna. Knowing that Prerna is still in love with Anurag, Rishabh tries to kill him. Kukki tries to stop Rishabh but ends up getting hurt. Guilty, Rishabh steps back while Anurag and Prerna unite.\n\nVengeful, Komolika makes a comeback. Prerna reveals to Anurag about her pregnancy and the two rejoice as they get ready to marry. Komolika causes Anurag's accident.\n\n===One month later===\nAnurag loses his memory. Komolika fakes an identity and misuses the opportunity to make Anurag and the Basu's believe that they got married. Prerna discovers Komolika's identity and decides to expose her but chooses to refrain in fear of affecting Anurag's brain and memory. Komolika tries to kill Prerna and her child multiple times but fails.\n\nPrerna gives birth to Sneha and Anurag regains his memory. They rejoice and plan to marry. Komolika threatens to frame Prerna for murder by leaking footage of her pushing Viraj off the cliff. She further asks Anurag to accept her and leave Prerna. Helpless, Anurag pretends to betray Prerna and pushes her off a bridge, but she is saved by Rishabh. Prerna reaches the orphanage where Komolika abandoned Sneha and is devastated to see it on fire. Reeling from shock and heartbreak, Prerna moves to London with Rishabh.\n\n===Eight years later===\nPrerna is a successful businesswoman in London while Anurag's business thrives in Kolkata. Prerna maintains a formal relationship with Rishabh and Anurag hates Komolika. Prerna detests Anurag for his betrayal while he lives in guilt. Komolika has taken over the Basu house. Nivedita and Anupam have separated. Prerna leaves for Kolkata in order to seek revenge from Anurag. Kukki and Kaushik start off by disliking each other, constantly bickering everytime they meet.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Parth Samthaan]] as Anurag Basu\u2013 Mohini and Moloy's son; Rakhi, Nivedita and Tapur's brother; Komolika's husband; Prerna's former husband; Sneha and Diya's father (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Erica Fernandes]] as Prerna Sharma \u2013 Veena and Rajesh's daughter; Shekhar, Shivani and Mahesh's sister; Anurag's former wife; Sneha's mother (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Hina Khan]]/[[Aamna Sharif]] as Komolika Chaubey - Siddhant's daughter; Anurag's wife; Mishka and Ronit's sister; Diya's mother (2018\u20132019) (2019\u2013present)\n* [[Karan Singh Grover]] as Rishabh Bajaj\u2013  Samira's former husband; Kukki's father (2019\u2013present)\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Shubhaavi Choksey]] as Mohini Basu\u2013 Moloy's wife; Rakhi, Nivedita, Anurag and Tapur's mother (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Uday Tikekar]] as Moloy Basu\u2013 Prosenjit's brother; Mohini's husband; Rakhi, Nivedita, Anurag and Tapur's father (2018\u2013present)\n* Kanupriya Pandit as Veena Sharma\u2013 Rajesh's wife; Shekhar, Prerna, Shivani and Mahesh's mother (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Kali Prasad Mukherjee]] as Rajesh Sharma\u2013 Moloy's childhood friend; Veena's husband; Shekhar, Prerna, Shivani and Mahesh's father (2018\u20132019)\n* [[Parull Chaudhry]] as Rakhi Basu\u2013 Mohini and Moloy's daughter; Nivedita, Anurag and Tapur's sister; Subodh's former wife; Tanisha and Kaushik's mother (2020\u2013present)\n* Vidyut Aryan as Subodh Chakraborty\u2013 Rakhi's former husband; Tanisha and Kaushik's father (2020\u2013present)\n* [[Pooja Banerjee]] as Nivedita Basu\u2013 Mohini and Moloy's daughter; Rakhi, Anurag and Tapur's sister; Anupam's former wife (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Sahil Anand]] as Anupam Sengupta\u2013 Nivedita's former husband (2018\u2013present)\n* Upasana Salunke/Priyal Mahajan/Aastha Abhay/[[Garima Parihar]] as Tapur Basu\u2013 Mohini and Moloy's daughter; Rakhi, Nivedita and Anurag's sister; Sahil's former fiance (2018)/(2018\u20132019)/(2019\u20132020)/(2020\u2013present)\n* Karan Arora as Shekhar Sharma\u2013 Veena and Rajesh's son; Prerna, Shivani and Mahesh's brother; Suman's husband (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Antara Banerjee]]/Ritu Chauhan as Suman Sharma\u2013 Shekhar's wife (2018\u20132019)/(2019\u2013present)\n* Charvi Saraf as Shivani Sharma\u2013 Veena and Rajesh's daughter; Shekhar, Prerna and Mahesh's sister; Ronit's former girlfriend (2018\u2013present)\n* Karan Bhanushali/Mridul Das as Mahesh Sharma\u2013 Veena and Rajesh's son; Shekhar, Prerna and Shivani's brother; Kajal's husband (2018\u20132020)/(2020\u2013present)\n* Minal Mogam as Kajal Sharma\u2013 Mahesh's wife (2020\u2013present)\n* [[Adi Irani]] as Siddhant Chaubey\u2013 Komolika, Mishka and Ronit's father (2018\u20132019)\n* Ariah Aggarwal as Mishka Chaubey\u2013 Siddhant's daughter; Komolika and Ronit's sister; Anurag's former girlfriend (2018\u20132019)\n* Tarun Mahilani as Ronit Chaubey\u2013 Siddhant's son; Komolika and Mishka's brother; Shivani's former boyfriend (2018\u2013present)\n* Aditi Sanwal as Kukki Bajaj\u2013 Samira and Rishabh's daughter; (2020\u2013present)\n* [[Urfi Javed]] as Tanisha Chakraborty\u2013 Rakhi and Subodh's daughter; Kaushik's sister (2020\u2013present)\n* Kunal Thakur as Kaushik Chakraborty\u2013 Rakhi and Subodh's son; Tanisha's brother (2020\u2013present)\n* [[Alka Amin]] as Sharda Bajaj\u2013 Rishabh's aunt; Tanvi's adoptive mother (2019)\n* [[Sonyaa Ayodhya]] as Tanvi Bajaj\u2013 Sharda's adoptive daughter; Rishabh's family friend (2019)\n* [[Namik Paul]] as Viraj Bhardwaj\u2013 Prerna's ex-fiance; Komolika's accomplice (2020)\n* [[Sanjay Swaraj]] as Naveen Chandra Chattopadhyay\u2013 Ronita and Madhuri's husband; Mohini's namesake brother; Prerna's former husband.

One issue with opioid rotation is that an opioid therapy failure poorly predicts whether other opioids would be effective. In certain situations, multiple switches may be required before pain therapy is optimized.<ref>Fine, Perry G, and Russell K Portenoy. \u201cStrategies for Opioid Rotation: Decision Support in Chronic Pain Management.\u201d Medscape, Medscape, 30 Mar. 2010, www.medscape.org/viewarticle/717832.</ref> In addition, recent studies explore which opioid drugs are most effective in implementing in an opioid rotation, but have so far found no difference in efficacy between opioid drugs like methadone and fentanyl in cancer patients.<ref>hvan den Beuken-van Everdingen Marieke H.J., van Kuijk Sander M.J., and Joosten Elbert A.. ''Journal of Palliative Medicine'' July 2017; {{DOI|10.1089/jpm.2017.0301}}</ref>\n\nDiversion of prescribed opioid drugs for illicit recreational use is also a particular concern in this field, as the drugs which are most effective for relieving [[suffering]] in [[palliative care]] also tend to be those most sought after by [[Substance abuse|drug abusers]]. The choice of what opioid drug to use in which patient thus tends to be a balance between many different factors that must be considered, and the need for opioid rotation in chronic pain patients makes it advantageous for a wide range of different opioid drugs to be available, even though they may be broadly equivalent in action when used in shorter term treatment.<ref>Cheung CW, Qiu Q, Choi SW, Moore B, Goucke R, Irwin M. \"Chronic opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain: a review and comparison of treatment guidelines.

However, this strategy is commonly used for these various situations: pain not controlled by current opioid, pain controlled but in the presence of intolerable adverse events, pain not controlled despite rapid increase in opioid dose, switching to utilize different alternative routes of administration, or switching due to high cost of current opioid (or other patient-specific cost considerations).<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mercadante|first=Sebastiano|last2=Bruera|first2=Eduardo|title=Opioid switching: A systematic and critical review|journal=Cancer Treatment Reviews|volume=32|issue=4|pages=304\u2013315|doi=10.1016/j.ctrv.2006.03.001|pmid=16624490|year=2006}}</ref>\n\n==Potential issues==\nWhile there is good evidence for the efficacy of opioid rotation as a treatment approach in general, there is less evidence for what particular opioid analgesics are most suitable, and in practice the choice of opioid drugs used depends on many factors such as patient characteristics, prescriber preferences and safety. One issue with opioid rotation is that an opioid therapy failure poorly predicts whether other opioids would be effective. In certain situations, multiple switches may be required before pain therapy is optimized.<ref>Fine, Perry G, and Russell K Portenoy. \u201cStrategies for Opioid Rotation: Decision Support in Chronic Pain Management.\u201d Medscape, Medscape, 30 Mar. 2010, www.medscape.org/viewarticle/717832.</ref> In addition, recent studies explore which opioid drugs are most effective in implementing in an opioid rotation, but have so far found no difference in efficacy between opioid drugs like methadone and fentanyl in cancer patients.<ref>hvan den Beuken-van Everdingen Marieke H.J., van Kuijk Sander M.J., and Joosten Elbert A.. ''Journal of Palliative Medicine'' July 2017; doi 10.1089/jpm.2017.0301</ref>\n\nDiversion of prescribed opioid drugs for illicit recreational use is also a particular concern in this field, as the drugs which are most effective for relieving [[suffering]] in [[palliative care]] also tend to be those most sought after by [[Substance abuse|drug abusers]]. The choice of what opioid drug to use in which patient thus tends to be a balance between many different factors that must be considered, and the need for opioid rotation in chronic pain patients makes it advantageous for a wide range of different opioid drugs to be available, even though they may be broadly equivalent in action when used in shorter term treatment.<ref>Cheung CW, Qiu Q, Choi SW, Moore B, Goucke R, Irwin M. \"Chronic opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain: a review and comparison of treatment guidelines.
