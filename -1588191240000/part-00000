This arrangement protects the engines and wing structure against foreign object damage. A built-in autodiagnosis system, [[auxiliary power unit]], and the wing configuration allow the An-148 to be used at poorly equipped airfields. Flight and navigation equipment features five {{convert|15|by|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} liquid crystal display panels built by Russia's [[Aviapribor]] and a [[fly-by-wire]] system, which enables the An-148 aircraft to operate day and night, under [[instrument flight rules]] and [[visual flight rules]] weather conditions on high-density air routes. Similar to the [[Boeing 737]], the main landing gear rotates into the belly of the aircraft when in flight, with partial doors covering the legs, and the sides of the tires remaining exposed. Built-in entrance stairs enable boarding and disembarking the aircraft without extra ground equipment.<ref name=\"ATOAntonov-148JetEntersInServiceInRussia\"/> The manufacturer claims high fuel efficiency of the [[Motor Sich D-436-148]] engines.<ref name=\"ATOAntonov-148JetEntersInServiceInRussia\"/>\n\n==Design, development, and production==\n\n[[Image:Antonov An-148-100E, Angara Airlines AN2208296.jpg|thumb|An-148 cabin]]\nThe beginning of the An-148 project dates to the early 1990s, when work on the [[Antonov An-74]] passenger modification started, headed by Petro Balabuev. In 2001, the project was renamed An-148. The An-74 [[fuselage]] was extended and the new aircraft's wing design was created from scratch.

This arrangement protects the engines and wing structure against foreign object damage. A built-in autodiagnosis system, [[auxiliary power unit]], and the wing configuration allow the An-148 to be used at poorly equipped airfields. Flight and navigation equipment features five {{convert|15|by|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} liquid crystal display panels built by Russia's [[Aviapribor]] and a [[fly-by-wire]] system, which enables the An-148 aircraft to operate day and night, under [[instrument flight rules]] and [[visual flight rules]] weather conditions on high-density air routes. Similar to the [[Boeing 737]], the main landing gear rotates into the belly of the aircraft when in flight, with partial doors covering the legs, and the sides of the tires remaining exposed. Built-in entrance stairs enable boarding and disembarking the aircraft without extra ground equipment.<ref name=\"ATOAntonov-148JetEntersInServiceInRussia\"/> The manufacturer claims high fuel efficiency of the [[Motor Sich D-436-148]] engines.<ref name=\"ATOAntonov-148JetEntersInServiceInRussia\"/>\n\n==Design, development, and production==\n\n[[Image:Antonov An-148-100E, Angara Airlines AN2208296.jpg|thumb|An-148 cabin]]\nThe beginning of the An-148 project dates to the early 1990s, when work on the [[Antonov An-74]] passenger modification started, headed by Petro Balabuev. In 2001, the project was renamed An-148. The An-74 [[fuselage]] was extended and the new aircraft's wing design was created from scratch.

Alemany, who in 1840 completed his studies in sacred theology in Rome at the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] College of St. Thomas, the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']], had been appointed Bishop of [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] and invited Fr. Vilarrasa to accompany him to [[California]].  On his way to his new post in California Alemany stopped in Paris and asked  Dominican sisters to join him to teach the children of the [[California Gold Rush|Forty-niners]]. Mary Goemaere (1809-1891) volunteered to accompany the new bishop and to begin a school in his new diocese. Within three years, nine women (three American, one Mexican, and five Spanish) joined Sister Mary to form the Congregation of the Most Holy Name.  The province was soon reduced to a self-governing Congregation.  Finally in 1912, the congregation was formally re-erected as a province,<ref>Article \"Dominicans\" by W.A. Hinnebusch, P.

Many pursue degrees in theology or liturgy, are engaged in justice ministries and fully participate in St. Dominic's call to contemplate and share with others the fruits of contemplation.. Lay Dominicans preach primarily in the marketplace or wherever our station in life finds us. We preach by our lives and example, and when opportunity arises, with our voices as well. Dominican Lay men and women pursue study, particularly in theology, Scripture, and catechesis in order to preach well when called upon to do so.\n\nThe Lay Dominicans make promises to follow The Rule of the Lay Chapters of St. Dominic and the Particular Directory of the Province in which they live. They meet in community regularly and participate with the friars, nuns, and sisters, as well as the Church in general, in praying the Liturgy of the Hours. They engage in active apostolates such as letter-writing on issues of peace and justice, ministry to the poor, liturgical ministries, teaching, authorship, and spiritual counseling. They endeavor to live lives of simplicity and generosity.<ref>[http://www.domlife.org/beingdominican/WhoWeAre/Laity.htm ''Dominican Life USA'': \"Who are Lay Dominicans\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230095255/http://www.domlife.org/beingdominican/WhoWeAre/Laity.htm |date=December 30, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Dominican Young Adults, USA==\nIn the summer of 2008, members who attended the Preaching in Action College conference, held a reunion at Edgewood College in Madison, WI.

Alemany, who in 1840 completed his studies in sacred theology in Rome at the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] College of St. Thomas, the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']], had been appointed Bishop of [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] and invited Fr. Vilarrasa to accompany him to [[California]].  On his way to his new post in California Alemany stopped in Paris and asked  Dominican sisters to join him to teach the children of the [[California Gold Rush|Forty-niners]]. Mary Goemaere (1809-1891) volunteered to accompany the new bishop and to begin a school in his new diocese. Within three years, nine women (three American, one Mexican, and five Spanish) joined Sister Mary to form the Congregation of the Most Holy Name.  The province was soon reduced to a self-governing Congregation.  Finally in 1912, the congregation was formally re-erected as a province,<ref>Article \"Dominicans\" by W.A. Hinnebusch, P.

In whatever lifestyle they find themselves, married or single, Lay Dominicans enrich the Dominican Family with their passion for the Truth, their love of Dominican prayer and apostolic zeal.\n\nLay Dominicans have a direct role in the preaching mission. Many pursue degrees in theology or liturgy, are engaged in justice ministries and fully participate in St. Dominic's call to contemplate and share with others the fruits of contemplation.. Lay Dominicans preach primarily in the marketplace or wherever our station in life finds us. We preach by our lives and example, and when opportunity arises, with our voices as well. Dominican Lay men and women pursue study, particularly in theology, Scripture, and catechesis in order to preach well when called upon to do so.\n\nThe Lay Dominicans make promises to follow The Rule of the Lay Chapters of St. Dominic and the Particular Directory of the Province in which they live. They meet in community regularly and participate with the friars, nuns, and sisters, as well as the Church in general, in praying the Liturgy of the Hours. They engage in active apostolates such as letter-writing on issues of peace and justice, ministry to the poor, liturgical ministries, teaching, authorship, and spiritual counseling. They endeavor to live lives of simplicity and generosity.<ref>[http://www.domlife.org/beingdominican/WhoWeAre/Laity.htm ''Dominican Life USA'': \"Who are Lay Dominicans\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230095255/http://www.domlife.org/beingdominican/WhoWeAre/Laity.htm |date=December 30, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Dominican Young Adults, USA==\nIn the summer of 2008, members who attended the Preaching in Action College conference, held a reunion at Edgewood College in Madison, WI.

Local chapters are present in Dominican colleges, universities, parishes, and other local areas with Dominican influence.  Local chapters of 18- to 30-year-olds center meetings around the four pillars of Dominican life: Community, Prayer, Study, and Preaching/Mission.  They have a mentor who is a member of the Dominican Family.  Each chapter also has a young adult leader.  Every two years, national gatherings are held.

[[Jean Dast\u00e9]] stars as Jean, the captain of a river barge who lives with his new wife Juliette ([[Dita Parlo]]) on the barge, along with first mate P\u00e8re Jules ([[Michel Simon]]) and the cabin boy (Louis Lefebvre).\n\nAfter the difficult release of his controversial short film ''[[Zero for Conduct]]'' (1933), Vigo initially wanted to make a film about [[Eug\u00e8ne Dieudonn\u00e9]], whom Vigo's father ([[anarchist]] [[Miguel Almereyda]]) had been associated with in 1913. After Vigo and his producer Jacques-Louis Nounez struggled to find the right project for a feature film, Nounez finally gave Vigo an unproduced screenplay by Jean Guin\u00e9e about barge dwellers. Vigo re-wrote the story with Albert Ri\u00e9ra, while Nounez secured a distribution deal with the [[Gaumont Film Company]] with a budget of \u20a31 million. Vigo used many of the technicians and actors who worked with him on ''Zero for Conduct'', such as cinematographer [[Boris Kaufman]] and actor Jean Dast\u00e9.\n\nIt has been hailed by many critics as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]].<ref name=\"Vigo Passion for Life.\">[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b81c7ab33 \"Vigo Passion for Life.\"] ''BFI.'' Retrieved: 23 December 2012.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJean, the captain of the canal barge ''L'Atalante'', marries Juliette in her village.  They decide to live aboard ''L'Atalante'' along with Jean's crew, the scruffy and eccentric P\u00e8re Jules and the cabin boy.\n\nThe couple travel to [[Paris]] to deliver cargo, enjoying a makeshift honeymoon en route. Jules and the cabin boy are not used to the presence of a woman aboard. When Jean discovers Juliette and Jules talking in Jules' quarters, Jean flies into a jealous rage by smashing plates and by sending Jules' numerous cats scattering.\n\nArriving in Paris, Jean promises Juliette a night out, but Jules and the cabin boy disembark to go see a fortune teller. This disappoints Juliette because Jean cannot leave the barge unattended.\n\nLater, however, Jean takes Juliette to a dance hall. There, they meet a street peddler who flirts with Juliette, dances with her, and asks her to run off with him. This leads to a scuffle with Jean, after which he drags Juliette back to the barge. Juliette still wants to see the nightlife in Paris however, so she sneaks off the barge to go see the sights.  When Jean discovers that she sneaked off the barge, he furiously casts off and leaves Juliette behind in Paris.\n\nUnaware that Jean has already left, Juliette goes window shopping. When she returns to the barge and finds that it's gone, she tries to buy a train ticket to the barge's next destination, but someone steals her purse before she is able to. She is forced to find a job so she can afford to live and eventually travel to Le Havre to meet the barge: her activities during this period are unclear.\n\nMeanwhile, Jean comes to regret his decision, and slips into depression. He is summoned by his company's manager, but Jules manages to keep him from losing his job. Jean recalls a folk tale that Juliette once told him. She said that one can see the face of one's true love in the water.  He attempts to recreate this by dunking his head in a bucket, and, failing that, jumping into the river.  Jules decides to leave and try to find Juliette. He finds her in a store and they return to the barge where the couple reunite and happily embrace each other.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michel Simon]] as P\u00e8re Jules\n* [[Dita Parlo]] as Juliette\n* [[Jean Dast\u00e9]] as Jean\n* Gilles Margaritis as Le camelot (the peddler)\n* Louis Lefebvre as Le gosse (the cabin boy)\n* Maurice Gilles as Le chef de bureau (the manager of the waterways company<ref>''The Complete Jean Vigo'' DVD Linear Notes.

Vigo suggested they work on a prison film about French anarchist [[Bonnot Gang|Eug\u00e8ne Dieudonn\u00e9]], whom Vigo's father [[Miguel Almereyda]] had defended in a newspaper article in 1913.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|p=1140}} Vigo began working on the film with Dieudonn\u00e9, who had agreed to play himself, and Julot Dupont, an expert on French prisons.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=151}} After ''Zero for Conduct'' was banned in France for its controversial depiction of the French education system, Nounez was worried that such a film could not be distributed. Other ideas for films considered by Nounez and Vigo include an adaptation of Georges de La Fouchardi\u00e8re's ''L'Affaire Peau-de-Balle'', and a script Vigo had written about the relationship between a bourgeois father and his more progressive son.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=150}} In July 1933, Nounez finally gave Vigo a scenario about \"barge dwellers\" called ''L'Atalante'', written by Jean Guin\u00e9e.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|p=1140}} In the early 1930s, films and music about \"barge dwellers\" were popular in France and had inspired such pop songs as \"Chanson de halage\" and \"Le chaland qui pass\u00e9\".<ref>''The Complete Jean Vigo'' DVD Linear Notes. The Criterion Collection, 2011, p. 35.</ref> Vigo initially disliked the scenario, but finally agreed to make the film and began making suggestions for the story.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=153}}\n\nNounez produced the film for \u20a31 million and made a deal with the [[Gaumont Film Company]] to provide studio sets and distribute the film. Vigo hired people he frequently collaborated with, such as cinematographer [[Boris Kaufman]], composer [[Maurice Jaubert]], and art director [[Francis Jourdain]], who was an old friend of his father.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|p=1140}} Boris Kaufman, the brother of Soviet film maker [[Dziga Vertov]], described his years working with Vigo as \"cinematic paradise.\"  Vigo also hired established film editor Louis Chavance after he found it difficult to edit ''Zero for Conduct'' himself.  Chavance had attended the premiere of ''Zero for Conduct'' and had been one of its early supporters and quickly became friends with Vigo.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=156}} Vigo and  Albert Ri\u00e9ra quickly wrote a shooting script and scouted locations at docks during the summer of 1933. They also found and leased ''Louise XVI'', the barge used for the film.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\n===Casting===\nVigo worked with established movie stars for the first time, who were hired by Gaumont but approved of by Vigo.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=156}} [[Michel Simon]] had been a lead actor after appearing in the title role of [[Jean Renoir]]'s ''[[Boudu Saved from Drowning]]'' (1932).<ref name=\"DVD Linear Notes pp.36\u201338\">''The Complete Jean Vigo'' DVD Linear Notes. The Criterion Collection, 2011, pp. 36\u201338.</ref> Simon stated that he accepted the role for the little-known and already controversial Vigo because he sympathized with Vigo and wanted to help his troubled career.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=156}} [[Dita Parlo]] was a minor star who had just returned to France after six years in Germany.<ref name=\"DVD Linear Notes pp.36\u201338\"/> [[Jean Dast\u00e9]] had only appeared in ''Zero for Conduct'' and ''Boudu Saved from Drowning'' before his lead role, but went on to have a long career in France.<ref name=\"DVD Linear Notes pp.36\u201338\"/> Louis Lef\u00e8bvre had previously appeared in ''Zero for Conduct''.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=156}} Vigo was familiar with Lef\u00e8bvre's lack of acting training and awkwardness on camera and worked those characteristics into his character in order to make Lef\u00e8bvre's performance work.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=183}}\n\n===Filming===\nAlthough scheduled to begin shooting during the summer, production did not begin until mid-November 1933.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=157}} ''L'Atalante'' took four months to shoot, partially in a replica of the barge in a Gaumont studio, and partially on location.<ref name=\"DVD Liner Notes, p. 8\">''The Complete Jean Vigo'' DVD Linear Notes. The Criterion Collection, 2011, p. 8.</ref> During filming, Vigo would often act out the scenes himself for the actors and insisted that they  re-shoot scenes until they were perfect.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=163}}\n\nAmongst the changes that Vigo made to the original script was replacing P\u00e8re Jules' pet dog with over ten alley cats supplied by the [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]. Vigo's father had been fond of such cats and Vigo's childhood homes were often overrun with stray cats.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=157}} During the scenes where P\u00e8re Jules plays his phonograph, the cats would become immediately fascinated by the phonograph and surround it whenever it played music. Vigo quickly assembled his crew and shot footage of the cats listening to the music and sleeping inside the loud speaker.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=171}} Simon later adopted the kitten that rested inside the phonograph horn.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=184}} Vigo also visited local flea markets in Saint-Ouen and the scrap metal market on Boulevard Richard-Lenoir to find props for P\u00e8re Jules' collection of artifacts from around the world.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=157}}\n\n[[File:L'atalantascene.png|thumb|right|[[Jean Dast\u00e9]] and [[Dita Parlo]] in the wedding scene, which was the first scene shot.]]\n\nProduction began with the exteriors on location and was shot mostly in sequence. The first scene shot was the wedding sequence at Maurecourt in the Oise.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=157}} The exteriors of the dance hall sequence where Juliette first meets the showman were shot at the Charentonneau dance hall in [[Maisons-Alfort]], while the interiors were shot on an elaborate set at Gaumont studios.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|pp=164\u2013165}} The character of the showman was not very developed in the shooting script and Vigo relied on improvisation on set to create a more interesting character.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=165}} Because Gaumont had insisted that music be included in the film, the showman sings \"The Pedlar's Complaint\", a French folk song written by Vigo, Goldblatt and Jaubert that makes fun of the genre of music that they were unwillingly required to include in the film.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=168}} Vigo had previously experienced bad sound quality when shooting ''Zero for Conduct'' and was concerned about a similar problem on ''L'Atalante'' despite having better equipment. Since Michel Simon had both the most dialogue in the film and a distinctly inarticulate manner of speech, Vigo had Simon adopt the character trait of repeating questions that were asked of his character.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|pp=183\u2013184}}\n\nThe first two weeks of location shooting began in the Oise between the Marne and the Rhine and down the [[Canal de l'Ourcq|Ourcq canal]] to the basin at [[Bassin de la Villette|La Villette]]. The harsh and early winter weather slowed down the shooting schedule and affected Vigo's health.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=171}} Despite the cold weather, Vigo wanted to shoot at night more and more so as to use the artificial lights of the barge and houses along the canal. Vigo also needed to maintain continuity, and the cold weather was creating floating ice in the canal. In the middle of location shooting, Vigo moved the cast and crew to the replica set of the barge at Gaumont studios at [[La Villette, Seine|La Villette]], but would quickly change the day's shooting to on location whenever the weather permitted. Vigo left all transition shots to the very end of shooting, which became a major problem due to the ground then being covered with snow. Vigo shot many low angle shots that only showed the sky in the background to ameliorate this problem.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=174}}\n\nBy mid-January, the film was behind schedule and over budget, with several major sequences having not yet been shot. Gaumont executives blamed Vigo and pressured him to finish the film quickly and inexpensively. Vigo was forced to film documentary-style footage, such as the scene where Juliette walks past a line of real unemployed workers. Despite not having sufficient funding from Gaumont to pay extras or for locations, he was able to film the scene where Juliette is robbed at the Gare d'Austerlitz in the middle of the night with a few friends appearing as background extras. Chavance was also able to recruit members of the \"October Group\", such as [[Jacques Prevert]], [[Pierre Prevert]] and [[Loutchimoukov]], to appear in the film.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=179}}\n\n===Vigo's health===\nOn location, shooting conditions were often cold and wet, causing Vigo to become ill and develop a fever.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=1140\u20131141}} He was already suffering from [[tuberculosis]] and was bedridden for portions of the filming.<ref name=\"DVD Liner Notes, p. 8\"/> Vigo refused to take a break and would often fight with executives at Gaumont over the film.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=174}} He worked until the film was almost complete and a rough cut had been made.\n\nAt the end of four months of continuous shooting, in early February 1934, Vigo took a vacation in Villard-de-Lans with family and friends to try to regain his health. He intended to finish the [[Final cut (film editing)|final cut]] of the film, but his condition became worse and he returned to Paris to recover. The few remaining aerial shots were done by Boris Kaufman,{{sfn|Gomes|1957|pp=184\u2013185}} while editor Louis Chavance finished the final cut without Vigo.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=185}} Vigo's health did not improve and was confined to his bed for the remainder of his life.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|p=1141}} Dast\u00e9 later claimed that Vigo \"made jokes all the time. Spending a day with him was wonderful and grueling, even a few weeks before his death. He was such a vivacious person.\"<ref>''The Complete Jean Vigo'' DVD Linear Notes. The Criterion Collection, 2011, p. 11.</ref>\n\n==Initial release and reception==\nThe film was previewed to French film distributors at the Palais Rochechouarton on 25 April 1934.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=185}} The screening was disastrous and Gaumont took control of the film. Jean Pascal called the original cut \"a confused, incoherent, willfully absurd, long, dull, commercially worthless film.\" However, [[\u00c9lie Faure]] said that he was reminded of the painter [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and praised \"these landscapes of water, trees, little houses on peaceful banks and boats slowly threading their way ahead of a silver wake: the same impeccable composition, the same power invisibly present because so much a master of itself, the same balance of all the elements of a visual drama in the tender embrace of complete acceptance, the same pearly, golden veil translucently masking the sharpness of composition and the firmness of line. And perhaps it was the simplicity of composition, entirely devoid of flourishes or decoration \u2014 classical, in a word \u2014 that made me appreciate all the more pleasure of savoring the very spirit of Vigo's work, almost violent, certainly tormented, feverish, brimming with ideas and truculent fantasy, with virulent, even demonic and yet constantly human romanticism.\"{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=1141\u20131142}}\n\nEventually, Gaumont cut the film's run time to 65 minutes in an attempt to make it more popular and changed the title to ''Le chaland qui passe'' (\"The Passing Barge\"), the name of a popular song at the time by [[Lys Gauty]], which was also inserted into the film, replacing parts of Jaubert's score.<ref name=\"DVD Liner Notes, p. 8\"/> Vigo was too weak to defend the film as his condition grew worse. When ''L'Atalante'' was released in September 1934, it was a commercial failure and received poor reviews from critics, who called it \"amateurish, self-indulgent and morbid.\"\n\nIn October 1934, shortly after the film had finished its initial run at French movie theaters, Vigo died at the age of 29 in the arms of his wife Lydou. Allegedly, he died just as a street performer began playing \"Le chaland qui passe\" below his window.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|p=1142}}\n\n==Legacy==\n''L'Atalante'' and all of Vigo's work was mostly forgotten by the late 1930s, despite ''L'Atalante'' being partially restored in 1940. Vigo's work began to be rediscovered after [[World War II]]. ''L'Atalante'' and ''Zero for Conduct'' were both re-released in New York in July 1947 and received rave reviews from film critics such as [[James Agee]],<ref>''The Complete Jean Vigo'' DVD Linear Notes. The Criterion Collection, 2011, p. 13.</ref> who called Vigo \"one of the very few real originals who have ever worked in film.\" In the UK, [[Roger Manvell]] called Vigo \"perhaps the most original and promising of the great French directors.\" In Italy, [[Luigi Comencini]] obtained a personal copy of ''L'Atalante'' and would screen it for his friends, calling it \"a masterpiece capable of shaking up any notion about cinema the average spectator might have.\"{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|p=1142}} Film critic [[Georges Sadoul]] praised \"the astounding quality of poetry it engenders from a world superficially ordinary and drab.\"<ref>Cook, David A. ''The History of Narrative Film''. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, Third Edition, 1996, p. 377. {{ISBN|978-0-39395-553-8}}.</ref>\n\nThe film became a favorite of the filmmakers of the [[French New Wave]], whose films contain many allusions to Vigo's work. The French director [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] fell in love with it when he saw it at the age of 14 in 1946: \"When I entered the theater, I didn't even know who Jean Vigo was. I was immediately overwhelmed with wild enthusiasm for his work.\" <ref>[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]].

[[Jean Dast\u00e9]] stars as Jean, the captain of a river barge who lives with his new wife Juliette ([[Dita Parlo]]) on the barge, along with first mate P\u00e8re Jules ([[Michel Simon]]) and the cabin boy (Louis Lefebvre).\n\nAfter the difficult release of his controversial short film ''[[Zero for Conduct]]'' (1933), Vigo initially wanted to make a film about [[Eug\u00e8ne Dieudonn\u00e9]], whom Vigo's father ([[anarchist]] [[Miguel Almereyda]]) had been associated with in 1913. After Vigo and his producer Jacques-Louis Nounez struggled to find the right project for a feature film, Nounez finally gave Vigo an unproduced screenplay by Jean Guin\u00e9e about barge dwellers. Vigo re-wrote the story with Albert Ri\u00e9ra, while Nounez secured a distribution deal with the [[Gaumont Film Company]] with a budget of \u20a31 million. Vigo used many of the technicians and actors who worked with him on ''Zero for Conduct'', such as cinematographer [[Boris Kaufman]] and actor Jean Dast\u00e9.\n\nIt has been hailed by many critics as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]].<ref name=\"Vigo Passion for Life.\">[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b81c7ab33 \"Vigo Passion for Life.\"] ''BFI.'' Retrieved: 23 December 2012.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJean, the captain of the canal barge ''L'Atalante'', marries Juliette in her village.  They decide to live aboard ''L'Atalante'' along with Jean's crew, the scruffy and eccentric P\u00e8re Jules and the cabin boy.\n\nThe couple travel to [[Paris]] to deliver cargo, enjoying a makeshift honeymoon en route. Jules and the cabin boy are not used to the presence of a woman aboard. When Jean discovers Juliette and Jules talking in Jules' quarters, Jean flies into a jealous rage by smashing plates and by sending Jules' numerous cats scattering.\n\nArriving in Paris, Jean promises Juliette a night out, but Jules and the cabin boy disembark to go see a fortune teller. This disappoints Juliette because Jean cannot leave the barge unattended.\n\nLater, however, Jean takes Juliette to a dance hall. There, they meet a street peddler who flirts with Juliette, dances with her, and asks her to run off with him. This leads to a scuffle with Jean, after which he drags Juliette back to the barge. Juliette still wants to see the nightlife in Paris however, so she sneaks off the barge to go see the sights.  When Jean discovers that she sneaked off the barge, he furiously casts off and leaves Juliette behind in Paris.\n\nUnaware that Jean has already left, Juliette goes window shopping. When she returns to the barge and finds that it's gone, she tries to buy a train ticket to the barge's next destination, but someone steals her purse before she is able to. She is forced to find a job so she can afford to live and eventually travel to Le Havre to meet the barge: her activities during this period are unclear.\n\nMeanwhile, Jean comes to regret his decision, and slips into depression. He is summoned by his company's manager, but Jules manages to keep him from losing his job. Jean recalls a folk tale that Juliette once told him. She said that one can see the face of one's true love in the water.  He attempts to recreate this by dunking his head in a bucket, and, failing that, jumping into the river.  Jules decides to leave and try to find Juliette. He finds her in a store and they return to the barge where the couple reunite and happily embrace each other.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michel Simon]] as P\u00e8re Jules\n* [[Dita Parlo]] as Juliette\n* [[Jean Dast\u00e9]] as Jean\n* Gilles Margaritis as Le camelot (the peddler)\n* Louis Lefebvre as Le gosse (the cabin boy)\n* Maurice Gilles as Le chef de bureau (the manager of the waterways company<ref>''The Complete Jean Vigo'' DVD Linear Notes.

Vigo suggested they work on a prison film about French anarchist [[Bonnot Gang|Eug\u00e8ne Dieudonn\u00e9]], whom Vigo's father [[Miguel Almereyda]] had defended in a newspaper article in 1913.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|p=1140}} Vigo began working on the film with Dieudonn\u00e9, who had agreed to play himself, and Julot Dupont, an expert on French prisons.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=151}} After ''Zero for Conduct'' was banned in France for its controversial depiction of the French education system, Nounez was worried that such a film could not be distributed. Other ideas for films considered by Nounez and Vigo include an adaptation of Georges de La Fouchardi\u00e8re's ''L'Affaire Peau-de-Balle'', and a script Vigo had written about the relationship between a bourgeois father and his more progressive son.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=150}} In July 1933, Nounez finally gave Vigo a scenario about \"barge dwellers\" called ''L'Atalante'', written by Jean Guin\u00e9e.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|p=1140}} In the early 1930s, films and music about \"barge dwellers\" were popular in France and had inspired such pop songs as \"Chanson de halage\" and \"Le chaland qui pass\u00e9\".<ref>''The Complete Jean Vigo'' DVD Linear Notes. The Criterion Collection, 2011, p. 35.</ref> Vigo initially disliked the scenario, but finally agreed to make the film and began making suggestions for the story.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=153}}\n\nNounez produced the film for \u20a31 million and made a deal with the [[Gaumont Film Company]] to provide studio sets and distribute the film. Vigo hired people he frequently collaborated with, such as cinematographer [[Boris Kaufman]], composer [[Maurice Jaubert]], and art director [[Francis Jourdain]], who was an old friend of his father.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|p=1140}} Boris Kaufman, the brother of Soviet film maker [[Dziga Vertov]], described his years working with Vigo as \"cinematic paradise.\"  Vigo also hired established film editor Louis Chavance after he found it difficult to edit ''Zero for Conduct'' himself.  Chavance had attended the premiere of ''Zero for Conduct'' and had been one of its early supporters and quickly became friends with Vigo.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=156}} Vigo and  Albert Ri\u00e9ra quickly wrote a shooting script and scouted locations at docks during the summer of 1933. They also found and leased ''Louise XVI'', the barge used for the film.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\n===Casting===\nVigo worked with established movie stars for the first time, who were hired by Gaumont but approved of by Vigo.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=156}} [[Michel Simon]] had been a lead actor after appearing in the title role of [[Jean Renoir]]'s ''[[Boudu Saved from Drowning]]'' (1932).<ref name=\"DVD Linear Notes pp.36\u201338\">''The Complete Jean Vigo'' DVD Linear Notes. The Criterion Collection, 2011, pp. 36\u201338.</ref> Simon stated that he accepted the role for the little-known and already controversial Vigo because he sympathized with Vigo and wanted to help his troubled career.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=156}} [[Dita Parlo]] was a minor star who had just returned to France after six years in Germany.<ref name=\"DVD Linear Notes pp.36\u201338\"/> [[Jean Dast\u00e9]] had only appeared in ''Zero for Conduct'' and ''Boudu Saved from Drowning'' before his lead role, but went on to have a long career in France.<ref name=\"DVD Linear Notes pp.36\u201338\"/> Louis Lef\u00e8bvre had previously appeared in ''Zero for Conduct''.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=156}} Vigo was familiar with Lef\u00e8bvre's lack of acting training and awkwardness on camera and worked those characteristics into his character in order to make Lef\u00e8bvre's performance work.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=183}}\n\n===Filming===\nAlthough scheduled to begin shooting during the summer, production did not begin until mid-November 1933.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=157}} ''L'Atalante'' took four months to shoot, partially in a replica of the barge in a Gaumont studio, and partially on location.<ref name=\"DVD Liner Notes, p. 8\">''The Complete Jean Vigo'' DVD Linear Notes. The Criterion Collection, 2011, p. 8.</ref> During filming, Vigo would often act out the scenes himself for the actors and insisted that they  re-shoot scenes until they were perfect.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=163}}\n\nAmongst the changes that Vigo made to the original script was replacing P\u00e8re Jules' pet dog with over ten alley cats supplied by the [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]. Vigo's father had been fond of such cats and Vigo's childhood homes were often overrun with stray cats.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=157}} During the scenes where P\u00e8re Jules plays his phonograph, the cats would become immediately fascinated by the phonograph and surround it whenever it played music. Vigo quickly assembled his crew and shot footage of the cats listening to the music and sleeping inside the loud speaker.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=171}} Simon later adopted the kitten that rested inside the phonograph horn.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=184}} Vigo also visited local flea markets in Saint-Ouen and the scrap metal market on Boulevard Richard-Lenoir to find props for P\u00e8re Jules' collection of artifacts from around the world.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=157}}\n\n[[File:L'atalantascene.png|thumb|right|[[Jean Dast\u00e9]] and [[Dita Parlo]] in the wedding scene, which was the first scene shot.]]\n\nProduction began with the exteriors on location and was shot mostly in sequence. The first scene shot was the wedding sequence at Maurecourt in the Oise.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=157}} The exteriors of the dance hall sequence where Juliette first meets the showman were shot at the Charentonneau dance hall in [[Maisons-Alfort]], while the interiors were shot on an elaborate set at Gaumont studios.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|pp=164\u2013165}} The character of the showman was not very developed in the shooting script and Vigo relied on improvisation on set to create a more interesting character.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=165}} Because Gaumont had insisted that music be included in the film, the showman sings \"The Pedlar's Complaint\", a French folk song written by Vigo, Goldblatt and Jaubert that makes fun of the genre of music that they were unwillingly required to include in the film.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=168}} Vigo had previously experienced bad sound quality when shooting ''Zero for Conduct'' and was concerned about a similar problem on ''L'Atalante'' despite having better equipment. Since Michel Simon had both the most dialogue in the film and a distinctly inarticulate manner of speech, Vigo had Simon adopt the character trait of repeating questions that were asked of his character.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|pp=183\u2013184}}\n\nThe first two weeks of location shooting began in the Oise between the Marne and the Rhine and down the [[Canal de l'Ourcq|Ourcq canal]] to the basin at [[Bassin de la Villette|La Villette]]. The harsh and early winter weather slowed down the shooting schedule and affected Vigo's health.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=171}} Despite the cold weather, Vigo wanted to shoot at night more and more so as to use the artificial lights of the barge and houses along the canal. Vigo also needed to maintain continuity, and the cold weather was creating floating ice in the canal. In the middle of location shooting, Vigo moved the cast and crew to the replica set of the barge at Gaumont studios at [[La Villette, Seine|La Villette]], but would quickly change the day's shooting to on location whenever the weather permitted. Vigo left all transition shots to the very end of shooting, which became a major problem due to the ground then being covered with snow. Vigo shot many low angle shots that only showed the sky in the background to ameliorate this problem.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=174}}\n\nBy mid-January, the film was behind schedule and over budget, with several major sequences having not yet been shot. Gaumont executives blamed Vigo and pressured him to finish the film quickly and inexpensively. Vigo was forced to film documentary-style footage, such as the scene where Juliette walks past a line of real unemployed workers. Despite not having sufficient funding from Gaumont to pay extras or for locations, he was able to film the scene where Juliette is robbed at the Gare d'Austerlitz in the middle of the night with a few friends appearing as background extras. Chavance was also able to recruit members of the \"October Group\", such as [[Jacques Prevert]], [[Pierre Prevert]] and [[Loutchimoukov]], to appear in the film.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=179}}\n\n===Vigo's health===\nOn location, shooting conditions were often cold and wet, causing Vigo to become ill and develop a fever.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=1140\u20131141}} He was already suffering from [[tuberculosis]] and was bedridden for portions of the filming.<ref name=\"DVD Liner Notes, p. 8\"/> Vigo refused to take a break and would often fight with executives at Gaumont over the film.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=174}} He worked until the film was almost complete and a rough cut had been made.\n\nAt the end of four months of continuous shooting, in early February 1934, Vigo took a vacation in Villard-de-Lans with family and friends to try to regain his health. He intended to finish the [[Final cut (film editing)|final cut]] of the film, but his condition became worse and he returned to Paris to recover. The few remaining aerial shots were done by Boris Kaufman,{{sfn|Gomes|1957|pp=184\u2013185}} while editor Louis Chavance finished the final cut without Vigo.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=185}} Vigo's health did not improve and was confined to his bed for the remainder of his life.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|p=1141}} Dast\u00e9 later claimed that Vigo \"made jokes all the time. Spending a day with him was wonderful and grueling, even a few weeks before his death. He was such a vivacious person.\"<ref>''The Complete Jean Vigo'' DVD Linear Notes. The Criterion Collection, 2011, p. 11.</ref>\n\n==Initial release and reception==\nThe film was previewed to French film distributors at the Palais Rochechouarton on 25 April 1934.{{sfn|Gomes|1957|p=185}} The screening was disastrous and Gaumont took control of the film. Jean Pascal called the original cut \"a confused, incoherent, willfully absurd, long, dull, commercially worthless film.\" However, [[\u00c9lie Faure]] said that he was reminded of the painter [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and praised \"these landscapes of water, trees, little houses on peaceful banks and boats slowly threading their way ahead of a silver wake: the same impeccable composition, the same power invisibly present because so much a master of itself, the same balance of all the elements of a visual drama in the tender embrace of complete acceptance, the same pearly, golden veil translucently masking the sharpness of composition and the firmness of line. And perhaps it was the simplicity of composition, entirely devoid of flourishes or decoration \u2014 classical, in a word \u2014 that made me appreciate all the more pleasure of savoring the very spirit of Vigo's work, almost violent, certainly tormented, feverish, brimming with ideas and truculent fantasy, with virulent, even demonic and yet constantly human romanticism.\"{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=1141\u20131142}}\n\nEventually, Gaumont cut the film's run time to 65 minutes in an attempt to make it more popular and changed the title to ''Le chaland qui passe'' (\"The Passing Barge\"), the name of a popular song at the time by [[Lys Gauty]], which was also inserted into the film, replacing parts of Jaubert's score.<ref name=\"DVD Liner Notes, p. 8\"/> Vigo was too weak to defend the film as his condition grew worse. When ''L'Atalante'' was released in September 1934, it was a commercial failure and received poor reviews from critics, who called it \"amateurish, self-indulgent and morbid.\"\n\nIn October 1934, shortly after the film had finished its initial run at French movie theaters, Vigo died at the age of 29 in the arms of his wife Lydou. Allegedly, he died just as a street performer began playing \"Le chaland qui passe\" below his window.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|p=1142}}\n\n==Legacy==\n''L'Atalante'' and all of Vigo's work was mostly forgotten by the late 1930s, despite ''L'Atalante'' being partially restored in 1940. Vigo's work began to be rediscovered after [[World War II]]. ''L'Atalante'' and ''Zero for Conduct'' were both re-released in New York in July 1947 and received rave reviews from film critics such as [[James Agee]],<ref>''The Complete Jean Vigo'' DVD Linear Notes. The Criterion Collection, 2011, p. 13.</ref> who called Vigo \"one of the very few real originals who have ever worked in film.\" In the UK, [[Roger Manvell]] called Vigo \"perhaps the most original and promising of the great French directors.\" In Italy, [[Luigi Comencini]] obtained a personal copy of ''L'Atalante'' and would screen it for his friends, calling it \"a masterpiece capable of shaking up any notion about cinema the average spectator might have.\"{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|p=1142}} Film critic [[Georges Sadoul]] praised \"the astounding quality of poetry it engenders from a world superficially ordinary and drab.\"<ref>Cook, David A. ''The History of Narrative Film''. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, Third Edition, 1996, p. 377. {{ISBN|978-0-39395-553-8}}.</ref>\n\nThe film became a favorite of the filmmakers of the [[French New Wave]], whose films contain many allusions to Vigo's work. The French director [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] fell in love with it when he saw it at the age of 14 in 1946: \"When I entered the theater, I didn't even know who Jean Vigo was. I was immediately overwhelmed with wild enthusiasm for his work.\" <ref>[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]].
