P. Matthen ('''May 18th 1890\u2013June 2nd 1960)  was a Member of the Indian Parliament in the first Lok Sabha to be constituted in 1952 after India gained Independence from Britain. He represented the Thiruvalla constituency of Kerala. Matthen was appointed the Indian Ambassador to Sudan after his single term in the Lok Sabha. Before his entry into politics, Matthen was  a businessman with interests in cashew, minerals, insurance, plantations and banking. He was responsible for starting the Alleppey Chamber of Commerce. He was Managing Director of  the Travancore National & Quilon (TN&Q) Bank when it suffered a run of unprecedented length that forced it to close. The bank run was said to have been escalated by Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer, the Dewan of Travancore, in an attempt to reduce the power of the Christian Community who were agitating for fair representation in the governing council of this Princely State. C.P. Matthen was extradited from Madras and imprisoned in Trivandrum, allegedly for balance sheet irregularities. He was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment but offered many chances to walk free if he would acknowledge guilt. C. P. Matthen refused these offers, maintaining his innocence for more than three years. He became something of a folk hero for his uncompromising stand. He was released on January 22nd 1942 without condition or explanation and returned to Madras.  \n\n== Early life ==\nCP Matthen was born into a landed Christian family in central Travancore, in [[Kavumbhagom]], Thiruvalla. It was unusual in that agricultural economy, even for landed families, to educate their children beyond high school, but Matthen went to Madras after high school and did his Bachelor Of History degree at Madras Christian College (MCC). He completed his education with a Bachelor of Law. \n\n== Insurance and Banking ==\nAt the age of 29, Matthen raised Rs 56,000 in capital and Rs 54,000 in deposits and started a bank that he called the Quilon Bank with its headquarters in Kollum (Quilon), The Quilon Bank headquarter building was then constructed and completed in 1935. In a relatively short space of 15 years, the bank\u2019s total working capital rose from Rs 156,000 to Rs 10,246,000.\n\nAnother leading Travancore businessman of that era was Mr [[K. C. Mammen Mappillai]], whose interests were not only in banking - his bank was called the Travancore National Bank - but also in journalism, newspaper publishing and politics, his heart was actually in journalism. He was the Chief Editor of a Travancore newspaper, [[Malayala Manorama]]. \n\nMammen and Matthen had started an insurance company together, and the commercial success of this new venture led them to amalgamate their respective banks in 1937. The registered office remained at the Quilon Bank headquarters in Travancore but the main business of the bank was conducted from its central office in Madras where its primary shareholders were based. Sir CP Ramaswami Iyer, encouraged this arrangement by offering to place Rs 7,000,000 of Travancore treasury money with the merged bank but this offer was never fulfilled.   \n\nThe TN&Q Bank was the fourth-largest bank in India and the largest in South India. It had 75 branches in British India, Travancore, Cochin, the Malabar, Coorg, Mysore and Ceylon:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Association|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.218123|title=The Calcutta Stock Exchange Offical Year Book 1938|date=1938}}</ref> Alleppey, Alwaye, Athirampuzha, Bangalore City, Bangalore Cantt.(South Parade Road), Bangalore Cantt.(Central Street), Bombay, Calcutta, Calicut, Changanacherry, Chirayinkil, Cochin, Coimbatore, Colombo, Coonoor, Cuddapah, Devicolam, Dindigul, Ernakulam, Erode, Galle, Hyderabad, Jaffna, Kandy, Karaikudi, Kayamkulam, Kottayam, Kumbakonam, Madras: Anderson Hall, G.T., Flower Bazaar, Mount Road, Triplicane, Mylapore, Vepery, Thyagarayanagar, Royapettah, Madura, Mangalore, Marthandorn, Mercara, Munnar, Mysore, Nagercoil, New Delhi, Ootacamund, Palghat, Parur, Perumpavoor, Pollachi, Poona, Pudukottah, Quilon, Quilon Sub Office, Rajapalayam, Salem, Secunderabad, Shertallai, Srirangam, Tellicherry, Tenkasi, Tinnevelly, Tinnevelly Junction, Tirupur, Thiruvella, Trichinopoly (25 Lascjar Street), Trichinopoly (Chinnakadai Teppakulam), Trichur, Trippunittura, Trivandrum (Main Road), Trivandrum (Chalai Bazaar), Tuticorin, Udumalpet, Vellore, Virudhunagar, Vizagapatam.  \n\n==Imprisonment==\nTN&Q Bank was established in 1937 with a new Quilon headquarters building which Matthen built at a cost of Rs. 140,000 (a very large sum of money at that time). To retain the business and deposits of the Travancore State, Matthen and Mammen had not only agreed to the headquarters in Travancore but that two of the bank\u2019s directors were the Dewan\u2019s appointees and also that the Bank\u2019s General Manager, a confidant of the Dewan named K. S. Ramanujam, was appointed at the specific recommendation of Sir CP. Despite this initial support from the Travancore Government, within a few months of amalgamation being completed, rumors started making its rounds that the bank was insolvent, and by 1938 there was a run on the bank\u2019s assets \u2013 this was instigated not only by the Dewan but was publicized by the Travancore State\u2019s Department of Publicity. The bank\u2019s financial run concluded with 88% of the public\u2019s deposits being returned by the bank, and the bank becoming insolvent. At this point the trap was sprung, by Sir CP\u2019s administration demanding the extradition of Matthen and Mammen from Madras Presidency to Travancore State to stand trial for defrauding the public. Sir CP also convinced the British Government in Madras that the bank and its directors had been financing the Congress party and the Independence movement, so appeals to the Madras High Court and the Privy Council in London to stay the extradition orders were rejected and 3 directors of the bank including Matthen, Mammen and Mammen\u2019s elder brother and Mammen\u2019s son, were transported in chains from Madras to Quilon to stand trial.\n\nAt the trial in Trivandrum, the erstwhile General Manager of the bank - K. S. Ramanujam, who was the nominee of the Maharaja's government - falsely testified that Mammen and Matthen had defrauded the bank and four directors (including Mammen\u2019s brother and son) were then awarded 8 years\u2019 imprisonment. The bank\u2019s remaining assets were liquidated by the State, and the bank\u2019s assets were distributed - mainly to confidants of Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyer, one of whom acquired the bank headquarters\u2019 building in Quilon for Rs 15,000 - approximately a tenth of what it had cost to build three years earlier. With the first year in jail, Mammen\u2019s imprisoned elder brother died a broken man. Soon afterwards, Sir CP, who had been an astute lawyer in the colonial administration, being keenly aware of the weaknesses in the Government\u2019s case \u2013 which depended on K. S. Ramanujam who vanished abroad after the trial - sent word to Mammen and Matthen that if they admitted their accused guilt and sought the Maharaja\u2019s mercy they could be pardoned. Mammen and his son, had other major family problems, so they agreed to sign the false declaration but Matthen continued to refuse. Sir CP initially declined to agree to the release without all of three of them admitting guilt, but finally released Mammen and his son on receiving their written \u201cconfessions\u201d. Matthen continued to hold out on his refusal to sign any false confession, despite heavy pressure brought on him through the Inspector General of Police, Mr Abdul Karim, visiting him regularly in jail and suggesting that he sign a letter \u2013 which the IG had drafted, requesting the Maharaja to pardon and release him.\nFinally, on 22nd January 1942, Mr. C. P. Matthen was unconditionally released by the Maharaja's Government without any written or verbal false admission of guilt. The IG, Mr. Abdul Karim, took Matthen in his official car from Travancore jail to his house where his family had waited patiently for his release from jail.\n\n==Member of Parliament==\nMr. C. P. Matthen was a member of the First [[Lok Sabha]] (Indian Parliament) in 1952, representing [[Mavelikara]] Constituency of [[Kerala]].\n\n==Lok Sabha Member and Ambassador==\nHe was elected to the first Lok Sabha in 1953, from Mavelikera constitutioncy in Kerala by one of the largest majorities of that election.  \n\nAfter completing his term in the [[Lok Sabha]], in 1957, he was appointed as the Indian Ambassador to [[Sudan]]. He retired a year later due to health reasons caused by his years of imprisonment in Trivandrum.\n\n==Death==\nDied on 2 June 1960 in [[Paris]], \u00cele-de-France, France and buried at [[Thiruvalla]], Kerala, India.<ref name=\"geni\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geni.com/people/Chalakuzhy-Poulose-Matthen-C-P-Matthen/6000000006434764012|title=Matthen (1890 - 1960) - Genealogy|publisher=geni.com|accessdate=2015-11-09}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Hard Copy==\n# N.M.Mathew, ''History of the Mar Thoma Church'', (Malayalam), Vol 3, 2008. page 75\n#''Chalakuzhy Kudumba Charitram'', Thomas Mathew (ed.) 1987.\n\n==External links==\n#{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/10/07/stories/2009100759851300.htm|title=C.P.

They are used extensively in agriculture, because of their speed and light footprint.]]\n[[File:KTM Quad 990 neutral.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A KTM Quad 990 ATV]]\n\nAn '''all-terrain vehicle''' ('''ATV'''), also known as a '''quad (bike)''', '''three-wheeler''', '''four-track''',  '''four-wheeler''', or '''quadricycle''', as defined by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) is a vehicle that travels on low-pressure tires, with a seat that is straddled by the operator, along with handlebars for steering control.  As the name implies, it is designed to handle a wider variety of terrain than most other vehicles.  Although it is a [[street-legal vehicle]] in some countries, it is not street-legal within most states, territories, and provinces of [[Australia]], the [[United States]], or [[Canada]].\n\nBy the current ANSI definition, ATVs are intended for use by a single operator, although some companies have developed ATVs intended for use by the operator and one passenger. In some countries, the passenger is not required to wear a helmet.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}  These ATVs are referred to as tandem ATVs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/frnotices/fr06/066703.html|title=Standards for All Terrain Vehicles and Ban of Three-Wheeled All Terrain Vehicles; Proposed Rule|publisher=Consumer Product Safety Commission (Federal Register)|date=10 August 2006|accessdate=26 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113022054/http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/frnotices/fr06/066703.html|archivedate=13 January 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe rider sits on and operates these vehicles like a motorcycle, but the extra wheels give more stability at slower speeds. Also dirt bikes are considered to be ATVs as that they were designed for off-road use only. Although most are equipped with three or four wheels, six-wheel models exist for specialized applications. [[Engine displacement|Engine sizes]] of ATVs currently for sale in the United States, (as of 2008 products), range from {{convert|49|to|1000|cc|L CID|sigfig=2|abbr=on|lk=out}}.\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\n[[Royal Enfield]] built and sold the first powered quadracycle in 1893.

With the introduction of straddle ridden ATVs, the term AATV was introduced to define the original [[amphibious ATV]] category.\n\n===ATC Development===\n\n{{Main|List of Honda three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles}}\n{{Main|List of Yamaha Three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles}}\n{{Main|List of Kawasaki Three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles}}\n{{Main|List of Suzuki Three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles}}\n\nThe first [[three-wheeler|three-wheeled]] ATV was the [[Sperry-Rand]] Tricart.  It was designed in 1967 as a graduate project of John Plessinger at the Cranbrook Academy of Arts near Detroit.  The Tricart was straddle-ridden with a sit-in rather than sit-on style (similar to the contemporaneous [[Big Wheel (tricycle)|Big Wheel toy]]).  In 1968 Plessinger sold the Tricart patents and design rights to Sperry-Rand [[New Holland Agriculture|New Holland]] who manufactured them commercially.  Numerous small American manufacturers of 3-wheelers followed.  These small manufacturers were unable to compete when larger motorcycle companies like Honda entered the market in 1969.\n \n[[File:1984 Honda 200s.jpg|thumb|1984 Honda ATC200S, one of the many three-wheeled models made by Honda and other manufacturers]]\n\n[[Honda]] introduced their first sit-on straddle-ridden three-wheeled All Terrain Vehicle in 1969, known as a [[Honda US90|US90]], as a 1970 Model. Variations would be popularized in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] movie, ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' and TV shows such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' and ''[[Hart to Hart]]''. In 1973, Honda would trademark the term \"All Terrain Cycle\" (ATC), applying the moniker to all Honda produced Three-wheeled ATV\u2019s, and creating the universal name which now  associated with all vehicles of this type. Being directly influenced by earlier 6-wheeled [[All-terrain vehicle#Six-wheeled AATVs|AATV's]] of the sixties, it utilized balloon tires for both a low environmental impact and to compensate for a lack of [[Suspension (motorcycle)|mechanical suspension]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atc90.tripod.com/hondaatc90/id17.html|title=ATC90 History|author =Chris Cooper|accessdate=2 January 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061216144600/http://atc90.tripod.com/hondaatc90/id17.html| archivedate= 16 December 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nHonda entered the 1980's with a virtual monopoly in the market, due to effective patents on design and engine placement. By 1980, other companies would paid patent royalties to Honda to enter the lucrative ATC field with their own machines. Yamaha introduced their first ATC, the Tri-Moto YZ125. Kawasaki followed suit the next year with the KLT200, while Suzuki produced their first effort, the ALT125, in 1982. As the popularity of ATC\u2019s increased dramatically, rapid development ensued. The ability to go anywhere on terrain that most other vehicles could not cross soon made them popular with US and Canadian hunters, and those just looking for a good trail ride. As other manufacturers were entering the market, Honda was diversifying, offering the [[ATC250R]], the first [[All-terrain vehicle#Sport competition|Sport ATC]] intended for competition, in 1981. The 1982 Honda ATC200E Big Red was a landmark model. It featured both suspension and racks, making it the first ATC designed specifically for utility, and would become the worlds best-selling ATC. Honda followed that effort in 1983 with the [[Honda Sport ATCs#Honda ATC200X|ATC200X]], an easy-to-handle {{convert|192|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[four-stroke]] Sport ATC that was ideal for new riders.\n\nNot to be outdone, Kawasaki and Yamaha responded with their own Sport ATC's. 1984 saw the release of the '''Kawasaki KXT250 Tecate''', and Yamaha followed in 1985 with the '''Tri-Z 250'''. Both were liquid Cooled 250cc two-strokes capable of giving the Honda ATC250R competition. In response to growing market, American Specialty manufacturer [[Tiger ATV LTD|Tiger]] also introduced a series of ATC's, Hand-built-to-order models that included the '''Tiger 500''', the largest displacement ATC produced commercially. While Kawasaki and Yamaha both produced Utility ATC's, famously making the '''KLT 250 Police''' and '''Yamahauler''' respectively, Suzuki turned their attention to building Sport Quads.\n\nHonda continued to diversify their line-up (at peak offering 10 distinct models), offering the larger, fully suspended [[Honda ATC250es| 250cc Big Red]] Utility ATC, and introduced the [[Honda Sport ATCs#Honda ATC350X|350X]] Sport ATC, their largest displacement machine, in 1985. But the bulk of their sales would prove to be the 200cc line, offering six models and selling over 500,000 units in 3 years. Honda's response to the Tecate and Tri-Z, the liquid cooled 1985 and 1986 ATC250R, remains one of the most desirable ATC\u2019s of the era, and aftermarket support still follows the machine.\n\n===American Based Manufacturers===\n\n{{Main|Tiger ATV LTD|Polaris Scrambler 250R/es}}\n\nAmerican-based manufacturers also produced ATC\u2019s in this period, abet in small numbers. [[Polaris Inc.|Polaris]] offered the [[Polaris Scrambler 250R/es|Scrambler]] in 1985 and 1986, producing appx 1600 units. Speciality manufacturer [[Tiger ATV LTD|Tiger ATV]] also produces a range of ATC\u2019s,, but their liquidation in 1991 left no official record of how many units were produced. The collector ATV market estimates vary drastically, from 300 to as many as 1000 units total production.  Tiger ATC\u2019s were offered for three years, with models using {{convert|80| to |500|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[two-stroke]] engines provided by [[KTM]] and [[Bombardier Inc.|Rotax]].\n\nThe Tiger 500 is notable for being the fastest consumer ATC available, with tested top speeds of +80&nbsp;mph from the stock  {{convert|42|hp|kW|1}}@6500rpm engine and 5 speed gearbox. With Final drive gearing changes, the ATC could produce speeds exceeding 100mph.  However, due to the rarity of the machines, much of the public was and remains unaware of the brand, and as all Tiger Models were custom ordered and built to the buyers specifications for the purpose of factory ATV racing, Polaris is generally known as the first American \u2018Production\u2019 ATV producer. \n\n===Voluntary Cease of Production===\n\nProduction of three-wheelers was voluntarily ceased by all manufacturers by 1987, in light of safety concerns, and ahead of any legislation.<ref>{{cite journal |title=All-terrain vehicle fatalities\u2014West Virginia, 1999\u20132006 |journal= Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |volume=57 |issue=12 |pages=312\u20135 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18368006 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5712a2.htm |author1= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref> Though future studies would show that three-wheelers were not considered more unstable than four-wheelers (although accidents are equally severe in both classes),<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ganos D, Crady S, Poortenga S, Hoffman G, Mann R |title=Trauma associated with three- and four-wheeled all-terrain vehicles: is the four-wheeler an unrecognized health hazard? |journal=The American Surgeon |volume=54 |issue=7 |pages=429\u201333 |date=July 1988 |pmid=3389591}}</ref> manufacturers agreed to a 10-year moratorium on production, as well as collectively financing a +$100 million ATV safety campaign. Despite the moratorium lifting, manufacturers have not returned to the ATC market, focusing instead on four wheeled ATV\u2019s. A ban on sales of new or used three-wheelers and a recall of all remaining three-wheelers has been proposed by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=All-terrain vehicle injury prevention: two-, three-, and four-wheeled unlicensed motor vehicles |journal=Pediatrics |volume=105 |issue=6 |pages=1352\u20134 |date=June 2000 |pmid=10835081 |doi=10.1542/peds.105.6.1352|doi-access=free }}</ref> However, it was determined in a CPSC study that three-wheelers are no more dangerous than other ATVs. Because of the cessation of production, it is widely assumed that the machines are unregistrable, uninsurable, and even illegal, despite a lack of any federal restrictions. All ATC\u2019s continue to be governed by the same laws as ATV\u2019s.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThese safety issues with three-wheel ATCs caused a shift in the buying public, as the sales of recently introduced four-wheel ATV models grew rapidly. While three-wheel models ended production in 1987, agreements between the major manufacturers and the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]]\u2014to officially cease production and finance safety campaigns moved forward. While the lighter weight of ATC\u2019s made them popular with certain riders, manufacturers continued to focus on ATV production. \n\n===Safety Concerns of ATC\u2019s=== \n\nSafety courses and educational literature has reduced the amount and severity of accidents among ATC and ATV riders. As cornering is more challenging on an ATC than with a four-wheeled machine, properly leaning into the turn is required, to counterbalance the weight and keep the machine stable. Operators may roll over if caution isn't used at high speeds. The lighter nature and smaller footprint of ATC front end\u2019s of ATC\u2019s present both a flipping and steering hazard Under acceleration and on inclines. Rollovers may also occur when traveling steep incline. However, in most terrain with the proper riding technique and safety gear, this issues can be mitigated. ATC\u2019s require unique techniques to ride properly, and turning lean requires more exaggeration than ATV\u2019s; Throttle steering is another technique commonly used on ATC\u2019s in soft terrain and at high speeds, leaning to the inside of the turn and manipulating the throttle to break traction with the rear tires, resulting in the machines turning on axis while maintaining a forward direction.\n\n===H.R.

It sold the first model, the 1982 QuadRunner LT125, which was a recreational machine for beginners. \n\nAdventure Vehicles of Monroe, Louisiana made the first quad ATV in 1980. They called it the Avenger 400. Prior to that, Adventure Vehicles made 3 wheel ATVs and a dump body utility 3 wheeler using Kohler 8 hp engines and Comet drive systems (Comet centrifugal belt driven clutch and a Comet forward, neutral, reverse transaxle with a rigid rear axle or rear differential option.) The Avenger 400 was a rigid suspension vehicle with a fiberglass body and welded tube construction. It was a rudimentary vehicle reminiscent of the Tote Gote of the 1960s. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hc9EJcgig8 \n\nSuzuki sold the first four-wheeled mini ATV, the LT50, from 1984 to 1987. After the LT50, Suzuki sold the first ATV with a [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] transmission, the LT80, from 1987 to 2006.\n\nIn 1985 Suzuki introduced to the industry the first high-performance four-wheel ATV, the [[Suzuki LT250R]] QuadRacer. This machine was in production for the 1985\u20131992 model years.  During its production run it underwent three major engineering makeovers.  However, the core features were retained. These were: a sophisticated long-travel suspension, a liquid-cooled two-stroke motor and a fully manual five-speed transmission for 1985\u20131986 models and a six-speed transmission for the 87\u201392 models. It was a machine exclusively designed for racing by highly skilled riders.\n\nHonda responded a year later with the FourTrax TRX250R\u2014a machine that has not been replicated until recently. It currently remains a trophy winner and competitor to big-bore ATVs. [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Motorcycle & Engine|Kawasaki]] responded with its [[Kawasaki Tecate 4|Tecate-4]] 250. The TRX250R was very similar to the ATC250R it eventually replaced, and is often considered one of the greatest sport ATVs ever built.\n\nIn 1987, [[Yamaha Motor Company]] introduced a different type of high-performance machine, the [[Yamaha Banshee 350|Banshee 350]], which featured a twin-cylinder liquid-cooled two-stroke motor from the RD350LC street motorcycle. Heavier and more difficult to ride in the dirt than the 250s, the Banshee became a popular machine with sand dune riders thanks to its unique power delivery. The Banshee remains popular, but 2006 is the last year it was available in the U.S. (due to EPA emissions regulations); it remained available in Canada until 2008 and in Australia until 2012. The Warrior 350 was introduced in 1987 and went on for years as a light and fast ATV.\n\nShortly after the introduction of the Banshee in 1987, Suzuki released the LT500R QuadRacer. This unique quad was powered by a 500&nbsp;cc liquid-cooled two-stroke engine with a five-speed transmission. This ATV earned the nickname \"Quadzilla\" with its remarkable amount of speed and size. While there are claims of 100+ mph ({{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|disp=out}}) stock Quadzillas, it was officially recorded by 3&4 Wheel Action magazine as reaching a top speed of over {{convert|79|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in a high-speed shootout in its 1988 June issue, making it the fastest production four-wheeled ATV ever produced. Suzuki discontinued the production of the LT500R in 1990 after just four years.\n\nAt the same time, development of utility ATVs was rapidly escalating. The 1986 Honda FourTrax TRX350 4x4 ushered in the era of [[four-wheel drive]] ATVs. Other manufacturers quickly followed suit, and 4x4s have remained the most popular type of ATV ever since. These machines are popular with hunters, farmers, ranchers and workers at construction sites.\n\n[[File:Spreader AF.jpg|thumb|ATV with a [[tow spreader]] mounted]]\n\nModels continue, today, to be divided into the sport and utility markets. Sport models are generally small, light, [[two-wheel drive]] vehicles that accelerate quickly, have a manual transmission and run at speeds up to approximately {{convert|80|mph|abbr=on}}. Utility models are generally bigger [[four-wheel drive]] vehicles with a maximum speed of up to approximately {{convert|70|mph|abbr=on}}. They have the ability to haul small loads on attached racks or small dump beds. They may also tow small trailers. Due to the different weights, each has advantages on different types of terrain. A popular model is Yamaha's Raptor 700, which features a nearly 700&nbsp;cc [[four-stroke]] engine.\n\nSix-wheel models often have a small dump bed, with an extra set of wheels at the back to increase the payload capacity. They can be either four-wheel drive (back wheels driving only), or six-wheel drive.\n\nIn 2011 [[LandFighter]] was founded, \"the first Dutch/European ATV brand\". The largest part of production takes site in Taiwan, to [[European standards]]; the ATVs are finally assembled in the Netherlands.\n\n== Safety and legal regulation ==\nSafety has been a major issue with ATVs due to the high number of deaths and injuries associated with them and the negligible protection offered by the machine.\n[[File:USMC-12093.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Roll cage|Roll-over protection]] fitted 4x4 used by the US Marines Special Operations]]\nThe modern breed of ATVs was introduced in the early 1970s and almost immediately realized alarming injury rates for children and adolescents.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kirkpatrick R, Puffinbarger W, Sullivan JA |title=All-terrain vehicle injuries in children |journal=Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=725\u201328 |year=2007 |pmid=17878773 |doi=10.1097/BPO.0b013e3181558856}}</ref> Based on analysis of the [[National Trauma Data Bank]], ATVs are more dangerous than [[dirt bike]]s, possibly due to crush injuries and failure to wear safety gear such as helmets.<ref>[http://www.medpagetoday.com/EmergencyMedicine/EmergencyMedicine/22593 \"ACS: Off-Road Injuries Worse With Four-Wheelers\"] article by Crystal Phend, Senior Staff Writer, ''MedPage Today'', 6 October 2010.

To be successful at fast trail riding, an ATV must have light weight, high power, good suspension and a low center of gravity. These machines can be modified for such racing disciplines as [[motocross]], woods racing (also known as cross country), [[off-road racing|desert racing]] (also known as Hare Scrambles), [[hill climbing]], [[ice racing]], speedway, Tourist Trophy (TT), [[Short track motor racing|flat track]], [[drag racing]] and others.\n\nThroughout the United States and the United Kingdom there are many quad racing clubs with [[enduro]] and quadcross sections. [[Grand National Cross Country|GNCC Racing]] began around 1980 and includes hare scramble and enduro type races. To date, events are mainly held in the eastern part of the United States. GNCC racing features many types of obstacles such as, hill climbing, creek and log crossings, dirt roads and wooded trails.\n\nATV National Motocross Championship<ref>[http://www.atvmotocross.com ATVmotorcross.com]</ref> was formed around 1985. ATVMX events are hosted at premiere motocross racetracks throughout the United States. ATVMX consists of several groups, including the Pro (AMA Pro) and Amateur (ATVA) series. Friday involves amateur practicing and racing on Saturday and Sunday. Saturday also involves racing for the Pro Am Women and Pro Am Unlimited classes. Sunday involves racing for the Pro and Pro Am production ATVs, but are scored separately. On average weekend over 500 racers will compete.\n\nThe [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] organizes the [[Quadcross of Nations]] at the end of the year. The competition involves teams of three riders representing their nations. There are three motos with two riders of each nation competing per moto. The location of the event changes from year to year.\n\nChampionship Mud Racing/CMR saw its infancy in 2006 as leaders of the ATV industry recognized a need for uniformity of classes and rules of various local mud bog events. Providing standardized rules created the need for a governing body that both racers and event promoters could turn to and CMR was born. Once unified, a true points series was established and lead to a national championship for what was once nothing more than a hobby for most. In 2007 the finalized board of directors was established and the first races were held in 2008. Currently, the CMR schedule includes eight competition dates spanning from March to November. Points are awarded throughout the season in several different competition classes of ATV and SxS Mud Racing. The 2008 year included Mud Bog and Mudda-Cross competitions, but the 2009 and future seasons will only have Mudda-Cross competitions. Classes range from 0\u2013499&nbsp;cc to a Super-Modified class which will allow any size ATV in competition. The ultimate goal of The CMR is \"to see the growth of ATV Mud Racing as a competitive sport and give competitors a pedestal upon which they can receive the recognition from national media and industry sponsors that they have long deserved.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.championship-mudracing.com/about.html |title=CMR \u2013 About \u2013 Championship Mud Racing |access-date=24 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306181505/http://www.championship-mudracing.com/about.html |archive-date=6 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005 the [[FIM Cross-Country Rallies World Championship]] started with a Quad Championship and the [[Dakar Rally]] added the Quad category in 2008. Because the [[2008 Dakar Rally]] was cancelled, the [[2009 Dakar Rally]] was the first [[Dakar Rally]] with Quads.\n\nAmateur and professional three-wheeler racing across the United States has also spiked in popularity once again, at levels not seen since the factory teams raced in the 1980s. Part of the appeal is the cheapness of parts, and how easy it is to get into. Races are held at various local and large venues, particularly in Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan and California. Payouts are sometimes awarded to winners.\n\nEach year in June, the world's biggest three-wheeler gathering is held at Haspin Acres, in [[Laurel, Indiana]], for the Trikefest event. Over the course of 3 days complete with camping, hundreds of people gather for the event which features competitive racing such as MX style racing, drag racing, mud racing, hill climbs and other events. For those who wish not to compete, there are also many trails a person can ride. as many as 100 or more three-wheelers show up each year, some built and restored to be raffled off, others brought to ride.\n\nThe fastest speed recorded on a quad cycle, or ATV given a flying start, is 315.74&nbsp;km/h (196.19&nbsp;mph), by Terry Wilmeth (USA), at the Madras, Airport in Madras, Oregon, USA, on 15 June 2008.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=The Jim Pattison Group|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/101 101]|quote=|via=|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/101}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Amphibious ATV]]\n* [[Car]]\n* [[Dune buggy]]\n* [[John Deere]]\n* [[Motorcycle]]\n* [[Motorized tricycle]]\n* [[Non-road engine]]\n* [[Off-road vehicle]]\n* [[Side-by-side (vehicle)|Side-by-side vehicle]]\n* [[Tomcar]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|All-terrain vehicles}}\n<!-- ATTENTION!

As the name implies, it is designed to handle a wider variety of terrain than most other vehicles.  Although it is a [[street-legal vehicle]] in some countries, it is not street-legal within most states, territories, and provinces of [[Australia]], the [[United States]], or [[Canada]].\n\nBy the current ANSI definition, ATVs are intended for use by a single operator, although some companies have developed ATVs intended for use by the operator and one passenger. In some countries, the passenger is not required to wear a helmet.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}  These ATVs are referred to as tandem ATVs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/frnotices/fr06/066703.html|title=Standards for All Terrain Vehicles and Ban of Three-Wheeled All Terrain Vehicles; Proposed Rule|publisher=Consumer Product Safety Commission (Federal Register)|date=10 August 2006|accessdate=26 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113022054/http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/frnotices/fr06/066703.html|archivedate=13 January 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe rider sits on and operates these vehicles like a motorcycle, but the extra wheels give more stability at slower speeds.

With the introduction of straddle ridden ATVs, the term AATV was introduced to define the original [[amphibious ATV]] category.\n\n===ATC Development===\n\n{{Main|List of Honda three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles}}\n{{Main|List of Yamaha Three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles}}\n{{Main|List of Kawasaki Three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles}}\n{{Main|List of Suzuki Three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles}}\n\nThe first [[three-wheeler|three-wheeled]] ATV was the [[Sperry-Rand]] Tricart.  It was designed in 1967 as a graduate project of John Plessinger at the Cranbrook Academy of Arts near Detroit.  The Tricart was straddle-ridden with a sit-in rather than sit-on style (similar to the contemporaneous [[Big Wheel (tricycle)|Big Wheel toy]]).  In 1968 Plessinger sold the Tricart patents and design rights to Sperry-Rand [[New Holland Agriculture|New Holland]] who manufactured them commercially.  Numerous small American manufacturers of 3-wheelers followed.  These small manufacturers were unable to compete when larger motorcycle companies like Honda entered the market in 1969.\n \n[[File:1984 Honda 200s.jpg|thumb|1984 Honda ATC200S, one of the many three-wheeled models made by Honda and other manufacturers]]\n\n[[Honda]] introduced their first sit-on straddle-ridden three-wheeled All Terrain Vehicle in 1969, known as a [[Honda US90|US90]], as a 1970 Model. Variations would be popularized in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] movie, ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' and TV shows such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' and ''[[Hart to Hart]]''. In 1973, Honda would trademark the term \"All Terrain Cycle\" (ATC), applying the moniker to all Honda produced Three-wheeled ATV\u2019s, and creating the universal name which now  associated with all vehicles of this type. Being directly influenced by earlier 6-wheeled [[All-terrain vehicle#Six-wheeled AATVs|AATV's]] of the sixties, it utilized balloon tires for both a low environmental impact and to compensate for a lack of [[Suspension (motorcycle)|mechanical suspension]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atc90.tripod.com/hondaatc90/id17.html|title=ATC90 History|author =Chris Cooper|accessdate=2 January 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061216144600/http://atc90.tripod.com/hondaatc90/id17.html| archivedate= 16 December 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nHonda entered the 1980's with a virtual monopoly in the market, due to effective patents on design and engine placement. By 1980, other companies would paid patent royalties to Honda to enter the lucrative ATC field with their own machines. Yamaha introduced their first ATC, the Tri-Moto YZ125. Kawasaki followed suit the next year with the KLT200, while Suzuki produced their first effort, the ALT125, in 1982. As the popularity of ATC\u2019s increased dramatically, rapid development ensued. The ability to go anywhere on terrain that most other vehicles could not cross soon made them popular with US and Canadian hunters, and those just looking for a good trail ride. As other manufacturers were entering the market, Honda was diversifying, offering the [[ATC250R]], the first [[All-terrain vehicle#Sport competition|Sport ATC]] intended for competition, in 1981. The 1982 Honda ATC200E Big Red was a landmark model. It featured both suspension and racks, making it the first ATC designed specifically for utility, and would become the worlds best-selling ATC. Honda followed that effort in 1983 with the [[Honda Sport ATCs#Honda ATC200X|ATC200X]], an easy-to-handle {{convert|192|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[four-stroke]] Sport ATC that was ideal for new riders.\n\nNot to be outdone, Kawasaki and Yamaha responded with their own Sport ATC's. 1984 saw the release of the '''Kawasaki KXT250 Tecate''', and Yamaha followed in 1985 with the '''Tri-Z 250'''. Both were liquid Cooled 250cc two-strokes capable of giving the Honda ATC250R competition. In response to growing market, American Specialty manufacturer [[Tiger ATV LTD|Tiger]] also introduced a series of ATC's, Hand-built-to-order models that included the '''Tiger 500''', the largest displacement ATC produced commercially. While Kawasaki produced Utility ATC's, famously making the '''KLT 250 Police''' model, Yamaha focused on Sport and Recreation models, and Suzuki turned their attention to building Sport Quads.\n\nHonda continued to diversify their line-up (at peak offering 10 distinct models), offering the larger, fully suspended [[Honda ATC250es| 250cc Big Red]] Utility ATC, and introduced the [[Honda Sport ATCs#Honda ATC350X|350X]] Sport ATC, their largest displacement machine, in 1985. But the bulk of their sales would prove to be the 200cc line, offering six models and selling over 500,000 units in 3 years. Honda's response to the Tecate and Tri-Z, the liquid cooled 1985 and 1986 ATC250R, remains one of the most desirable ATC\u2019s of the era, and aftermarket support still follows the machine.\n\n===American Based Manufacturers===\n\n{{Main|Tiger ATV LTD|Polaris Scrambler 250R/es}}\n\nAmerican-based manufacturers also produced ATC\u2019s in this period, abet in small numbers. [[Polaris Inc.|Polaris]] offered the [[Polaris Scrambler 250R/es|Scrambler]] in 1985 and 1986, producing appx 1600 units. Speciality manufacturer [[Tiger ATV LTD|Tiger ATV]] also produces a range of ATC\u2019s,, but their liquidation in 1991 left no official record of how many units were produced. The collector ATV market estimates vary drastically, from 300 to as many as 1000 units total production.  Tiger ATC\u2019s were offered for three years, with models using {{convert|80| to |500|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[two-stroke]] engines provided by [[KTM]] and [[Bombardier Inc.|Rotax]].\n\nThe Tiger 500 is notable for being the fastest consumer ATC available, with tested top speeds of +80&nbsp;mph from the stock  {{convert|42|hp|kW|1}}@6500rpm engine and 5 speed gearbox. With Final drive gearing changes, the ATC could produce speeds exceeding 100mph.  However, due to the rarity of the machines, much of the public was and remains unaware of the brand, and as all Tiger Models were custom ordered and built to the buyers specifications for the purpose of factory ATV racing, Polaris is generally known as the first American \u2018Production\u2019 ATV producer. \n\n===Voluntary Cease of Production===\n\nProduction of three-wheelers was voluntarily ceased by all manufacturers by 1987, in light of safety concerns, and ahead of any legislation.<ref>{{cite journal |title=All-terrain vehicle fatalities\u2014West Virginia, 1999\u20132006 |journal= Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |volume=57 |issue=12 |pages=312\u20135 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18368006 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5712a2.htm |author1= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref> Though future studies would show that three-wheelers were not considered more unstable than four-wheelers (although accidents are equally severe in both classes),<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ganos D, Crady S, Poortenga S, Hoffman G, Mann R |title=Trauma associated with three- and four-wheeled all-terrain vehicles: is the four-wheeler an unrecognized health hazard? |journal=The American Surgeon |volume=54 |issue=7 |pages=429\u201333 |date=July 1988 |pmid=3389591}}</ref> manufacturers agreed to a 10-year moratorium on production, as well as collectively financing a +$100 million ATV safety campaign. Despite the moratorium lifting, manufacturers have not returned to the ATC market, focusing instead on four wheeled ATV\u2019s.

Because of the cessation of production, it is widely assumed that the machines are unregistrable, uninsurable, and even illegal, despite a lack of any federal restrictions. All ATC\u2019s continue to be governed by the same laws as ATV\u2019s.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThese safety issues with three-wheel ATCs caused a shift in the buying public, as the sales of recently introduced four-wheel ATV models grew rapidly. While three-wheel models ended production in 1987, agreements between the major manufacturers and the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]]\u2014to officially cease production and finance safety campaigns moved forward. While the lighter weight of ATC\u2019s made them popular with certain riders, manufacturers continued to focus on ATV production. \n\n===Safety Concerns of ATC\u2019s=== \n\nSafety courses and educational literature has reduced the amount and severity of accidents among ATC and ATV riders. As cornering is more challenging on an ATC than with a four-wheeled machine, properly leaning into the turn is required, to counterbalance the weight and keep the machine stable. Operators may roll over if caution isn't used at high speeds. The lighter nature and smaller footprint of ATC front end\u2019s of ATC\u2019s present both a flipping and steering hazard Under acceleration and on inclines. Rollovers may also occur when traveling steep incline. However, in most terrain with the proper riding technique and safety gear, this issues can be mitigated. ATC\u2019s require unique techniques to ride properly, and turning lean requires more exaggeration than ATV\u2019s; Throttle steering is another technique commonly used on ATC\u2019s in soft terrain and at high speeds, leaning to the inside of the turn and manipulating the throttle to break traction with the rear tires, resulting in the machines turning on axis while maintaining a forward direction.\n\n===H.R.

It sold the first model, the 1982 QuadRunner LT125, which was a recreational machine for beginners. \n\nAdventure Vehicles of Monroe, Louisiana made the first quad ATV in 1980. They called it the Avenger 400. Prior to that, Adventure Vehicles made 3 wheel ATVs and a dump body utility 3 wheeler using Kohler 8 hp engines and Comet drive systems (Comet centrifugal belt driven clutch and a Comet forward, neutral, reverse transaxle with a rigid rear axle or rear differential option.) The Avenger 400 was a rigid suspension vehicle with a fiberglass body and welded tube construction. It was a rudimentary vehicle reminiscent of the Tote Gote of the 1960s. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hc9EJcgig8 \n\nSuzuki sold the first four-wheeled mini ATV, the LT50, from 1984 to 1987. After the LT50, Suzuki sold the first ATV with a [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] transmission, the LT80, from 1987 to 2006.\n\nIn 1985 Suzuki introduced to the industry the first high-performance four-wheel ATV, the [[Suzuki LT250R]] QuadRacer. This machine was in production for the 1985\u20131992 model years.  During its production run it underwent three major engineering makeovers.  However, the core features were retained. These were: a sophisticated long-travel suspension, a liquid-cooled two-stroke motor and a fully manual five-speed transmission for 1985\u20131986 models and a six-speed transmission for the 87\u201392 models. It was a machine exclusively designed for racing by highly skilled riders.\n\nHonda responded a year later with the FourTrax TRX250R\u2014a machine that has not been replicated until recently. It currently remains a trophy winner and competitor to big-bore ATVs. [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Motorcycle & Engine|Kawasaki]] responded with its [[Kawasaki Tecate 4|Tecate-4]] 250. The TRX250R was very similar to the ATC250R it eventually replaced, and is often considered one of the greatest sport ATVs ever built.\n\nIn 1987, [[Yamaha Motor Company]] introduced a different type of high-performance machine, the [[Yamaha Banshee 350|Banshee 350]], which featured a twin-cylinder liquid-cooled two-stroke motor from the RD350LC street motorcycle. Heavier and more difficult to ride in the dirt than the 250s, the Banshee became a popular machine with sand dune riders thanks to its unique power delivery. The Banshee remains popular, but 2006 is the last year it was available in the U.S. (due to EPA emissions regulations); it remained available in Canada until 2008 and in Australia until 2012. The Warrior 350 was introduced in 1987 and went on for years as a light and fast ATV.\n\nShortly after the introduction of the Banshee in 1987, Suzuki released the LT500R QuadRacer. This unique quad was powered by a 500&nbsp;cc liquid-cooled two-stroke engine with a five-speed transmission. This ATV earned the nickname \"Quadzilla\" with its remarkable amount of speed and size. While there are claims of 100+ mph ({{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|disp=out}}) stock Quadzillas, it was officially recorded by 3&4 Wheel Action magazine as reaching a top speed of over {{convert|79|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in a high-speed shootout in its 1988 June issue, making it the fastest production four-wheeled ATV ever produced. Suzuki discontinued the production of the LT500R in 1990 after just four years.\n\nAt the same time, development of utility ATVs was rapidly escalating. The 1986 Honda FourTrax TRX350 4x4 ushered in the era of [[four-wheel drive]] ATVs. Other manufacturers quickly followed suit, and 4x4s have remained the most popular type of ATV ever since. These machines are popular with hunters, farmers, ranchers and workers at construction sites.\n\n[[File:Spreader AF.jpg|thumb|ATV with a [[tow spreader]] mounted]]\n\nModels continue, today, to be divided into the sport and utility markets. Sport models are generally small, light, [[two-wheel drive]] vehicles that accelerate quickly, have a manual transmission and run at speeds up to approximately {{convert|80|mph|abbr=on}}. Utility models are generally bigger [[four-wheel drive]] vehicles with a maximum speed of up to approximately {{convert|70|mph|abbr=on}}. They have the ability to haul small loads on attached racks or small dump beds. They may also tow small trailers. Due to the different weights, each has advantages on different types of terrain. A popular model is Yamaha's Raptor 700, which features a nearly 700&nbsp;cc [[four-stroke]] engine.\n\nSix-wheel models often have a small dump bed, with an extra set of wheels at the back to increase the payload capacity. They can be either four-wheel drive (back wheels driving only), or six-wheel drive.\n\nIn 2011 [[LandFighter]] was founded, \"the first Dutch/European ATV brand\". The largest part of production takes site in Taiwan, to [[European standards]]; the ATVs are finally assembled in the Netherlands.\n\n== Safety and legal regulation ==\nSafety has been a major issue with ATVs due to the high number of deaths and injuries associated with them and the negligible protection offered by the machine.\n[[File:USMC-12093.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Roll cage|Roll-over protection]] fitted 4x4 used by the US Marines Special Operations]]\nThe modern breed of ATVs was introduced in the early 1970s and almost immediately realized alarming injury rates for children and adolescents.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kirkpatrick R, Puffinbarger W, Sullivan JA |title=All-terrain vehicle injuries in children |journal=Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=725\u201328 |year=2007 |pmid=17878773 |doi=10.1097/BPO.0b013e3181558856}}</ref> Based on analysis of the [[National Trauma Data Bank]], ATVs are more dangerous than [[dirt bike]]s, possibly due to crush injuries and failure to wear safety gear such as helmets.<ref>[http://www.medpagetoday.com/EmergencyMedicine/EmergencyMedicine/22593 \"ACS: Off-Road Injuries Worse With Four-Wheelers\"] article by Crystal Phend, Senior Staff Writer, ''MedPage Today'', 6 October 2010.

Although ORVs had been identified 30 years ago as a threat to wild ecosystems by the Forest Service, only after pressure by an unlikely alliance of environmentalists, private landowners, hunters, ranchers, fishermen, quiet recreationists and forest rangers themselves (who identified ORVs as a \"significant law enforcement problem\" in national forests).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.flyrodreel.com/Blogs/Ted-Williams/December-2007/First-Ever-Survey-of-Federal-Rangers-Shows-ORVs-Out-of-Control/ |title=Flyrodreel.com |access-date=28 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907064857/http://www.flyrodreel.com/Blogs/Ted-Williams/December-2007/First-Ever-Survey-of-Federal-Rangers-Shows-ORVs-Out-of-Control/ |archive-date=7 September 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> has action been taken.

To be successful at fast trail riding, an ATV must have light weight, high power, good suspension and a low center of gravity. These machines can be modified for such racing disciplines as [[motocross]], woods racing (also known as cross country), [[off-road racing|desert racing]] (also known as Hare Scrambles), [[hill climbing]], [[ice racing]], speedway, Tourist Trophy (TT), [[Short track motor racing|flat track]], [[drag racing]] and others.\n\nThroughout the United States and the United Kingdom there are many quad racing clubs with [[enduro]] and quadcross sections. [[Grand National Cross Country|GNCC Racing]] began around 1980 and includes hare scramble and enduro type races. To date, events are mainly held in the eastern part of the United States. GNCC racing features many types of obstacles such as, hill climbing, creek and log crossings, dirt roads and wooded trails.\n\nATV National Motocross Championship<ref>[http://www.atvmotocross.com ATVmotorcross.com]</ref> was formed around 1985. ATVMX events are hosted at premiere motocross racetracks throughout the United States. ATVMX consists of several groups, including the Pro (AMA Pro) and Amateur (ATVA) series. Friday involves amateur practicing and racing on Saturday and Sunday. Saturday also involves racing for the Pro Am Women and Pro Am Unlimited classes. Sunday involves racing for the Pro and Pro Am production ATVs, but are scored separately. On average weekend over 500 racers will compete.\n\nThe [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] organizes the [[Quadcross of Nations]] at the end of the year. The competition involves teams of three riders representing their nations. There are three motos with two riders of each nation competing per moto. The location of the event changes from year to year.\n\nChampionship Mud Racing/CMR saw its infancy in 2006 as leaders of the ATV industry recognized a need for uniformity of classes and rules of various local mud bog events. Providing standardized rules created the need for a governing body that both racers and event promoters could turn to and CMR was born. Once unified, a true points series was established and lead to a national championship for what was once nothing more than a hobby for most. In 2007 the finalized board of directors was established and the first races were held in 2008. Currently, the CMR schedule includes eight competition dates spanning from March to November. Points are awarded throughout the season in several different competition classes of ATV and SxS Mud Racing. The 2008 year included Mud Bog and Mudda-Cross competitions, but the 2009 and future seasons will only have Mudda-Cross competitions. Classes range from 0\u2013499&nbsp;cc to a Super-Modified class which will allow any size ATV in competition. The ultimate goal of The CMR is \"to see the growth of ATV Mud Racing as a competitive sport and give competitors a pedestal upon which they can receive the recognition from national media and industry sponsors that they have long deserved.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.championship-mudracing.com/about.html |title=CMR \u2013 About \u2013 Championship Mud Racing |access-date=24 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306181505/http://www.championship-mudracing.com/about.html |archive-date=6 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005 the [[FIM Cross-Country Rallies World Championship]] started with a Quad Championship and the [[Dakar Rally]] added the Quad category in 2008. Because the [[2008 Dakar Rally]] was cancelled, the [[2009 Dakar Rally]] was the first [[Dakar Rally]] with Quads.\n\nAmateur and professional three-wheeler racing across the United States has also spiked in popularity once again, at levels not seen since the factory teams raced in the 1980s. Part of the appeal is the cheapness of parts, and how easy it is to get into. Races are held at various local and large venues, particularly in Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan and California. Payouts are sometimes awarded to winners.\n\nEach year in June, the world's biggest three-wheeler gathering is held at Haspin Acres, in [[Laurel, Indiana]], for the Trikefest event. Over the course of 3 days complete with camping, hundreds of people gather for the event which features competitive racing such as MX style racing, drag racing, mud racing, hill climbs and other events. For those who wish not to compete, there are also many trails a person can ride. as many as 100 or more three-wheelers show up each year, some built and restored to be raffled off, others brought to ride.\n\nThe fastest speed recorded on a quad cycle, or ATV given a flying start, is 315.74&nbsp;km/h (196.19&nbsp;mph), by Terry Wilmeth (USA), at the Madras, Airport in Madras, Oregon, USA, on 15 June 2008.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=The Jim Pattison Group|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/101 101]|quote=|via=|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/101}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Amphibious ATV]]\n* [[Car]]\n* [[Dune buggy]]\n* [[John Deere]]\n* [[Motorcycle]]\n* [[Motorized tricycle]]\n* [[Non-road engine]]\n* [[Off-road vehicle]]\n* [[Side-by-side (vehicle)|Side-by-side vehicle]]\n* [[Tomcar]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|All-terrain vehicles}}\n<!-- ATTENTION!

Beginning February 29, 1928 on [[NBC]], Socony Oil reached radio listeners with a comedy program, ''[[Snow Village Sketches|Soconyland Sketches]]'', scripted by William Ford Manley and featuring Arthur Allen and [[Parker Fennelly]] as rural [[New England]]ers. Socony continued to sponsor the show when it moved to [[CBS]] in 1934. In 1935, it became the ''Socony Sketchbook,'' with [[Christopher Morley]] and the [[Johnny Green]] orchestra.\n\nIn 1931, Socony merged with [[Vacuum Oil Company|Vacuum Oil]] to form Socony-Vacuum.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,882045,00.html \"Business & Finance: Socony-Vacuum Corp.\"] ''Time,'' 1931-08-10, retrieved on 2009-12-10.</ref>\n\nIn 1933, Socony-Vacuum and [[Exxon|Jersey Standard]] (which had oil production and refineries in [[Indonesia]]) merged their interests in the Far East into a 50\u201350 joint venture. Standard-Vacuum Oil Co., or \"Stanvac\", operated in 50 countries, including [[New Zealand]], [[China]], and the region of [[East Africa]], before it was dissolved in 1962. In 1935, Socony Vacuum Oil opened the huge Mammoth Oil Port on [[Staten Island]] which had a capacity of handling 250 million gallons of petroleum products a year and could transship oil from ocean-going tankers and river barges.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_wN8DAAAAMBAJ|quote=Popular Science 1935 plane Popular Mechanics.|title=Popular Mechanics|first=Hearst|last=Magazines|date=1 October 1935|publisher=Hearst Magazines|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_wN8DAAAAMBAJ/page/n120 543]|accessdate=20 July 2018|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, Socony-Vacuum's gasoline buying practices led to the major [[antitrust law]] case ''[[United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.]]'' The case originated with Socony-Vacuum's practices of organizing a cartel among the \"major\" oil companies in which they bought oil\u2014known as \"hot oil\"\u2014from independent producers and stored the surplus in tanks to limit the supply of oil available on the market and keep the price of oil artificially high. In its decision, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that regardless of the purpose of the price fixing or if the prices varied, such conduct was illegal in and of itself: \"Under the [[Sherman Act]] a combination formed for the purpose and with the effect of raising, depressing, fixing, pegging, or stabilizing the price of a commodity in interstate or foreign commerce is illegal ''per se''...\" This rule remains in use today for agreements that appear on their face to always or almost always restrict competition and reduce output.\n\n[[File:\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea \u05e1\u05d5\u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d0\u05e7\u05d5\u05dd - Socony Vacuum Oil Company-ZKlugerPhotos-000zmg0.jpeg|thumb|left|Socony-Vacuum \"benzine\" station with Mobil Oil sign, [[Allenby Street|Allenby Street, Tel Aviv]], 1939]]\n\n[[File:1962 Rambler ChampionPlug MobilEconRun AD.jpg|thumb|left|The Mobil Economy Run generated publicity and [[Promotion (marketing)|promotions]] such as this 1962 advertisement by [[Federal-Mogul|Champion spark plugs]] with a [[Rambler American]].]]\n\nIn 1955, Socony-Vacuum was renamed Socony Mobil Oil Company. In 1963, it changed its trade name from \"Mobiloil\" to simply \"Mobil\", introducing a new logo (created by New York graphic design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]). To celebrate its 100th anniversary in 1966, \"Socony\" was dropped from the corporate name.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1968, Mobil sponsored an [[Mobil Economy Run|economy run]] each year (except during [[World War II]]) in which domestic automobiles of various manufacturers in several price and size classes were driven by light-footed drivers on cross-country runs. The Economy Run originated with the [[Gilmore Oil Company]] of California in 1936 (which was purchased by Socony-Vacuum in 1940) and later became the Mobilgas Economy Run, and still later the Mobil Economy Run. The cars driven in the economy run were fueled with Mobil [[gasoline]], and Mobiloil and lubricants were also used. The vehicles in each class that achieved the highest fuel economy numbers were awarded the coveted title as the Mobilgas Economy Run winner.\n\nDuring American involvement in [[World War II]], April 29, 1942, Socony's unescorted tanker, named ''Mobiloil'', was sunk by a German [[U-boat]] ([[German Type IX submarine]] ''U-108'' captained by Klaus Schlotz), and all 52 people survived after 86 hours adrift in lifeboats.

Various Mobil products during the Socony-Vacuum and Socony-Mobil years included Metro, Mobilgas and Mobilgas Special gasolines; Mobilfuel Diesel, MobilHeat and Mobil-flame heating oil, Mobil Kerosine, [[Lubrite]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usbfmi.com/lube1.htm|title=Lubrite Technologies|website=Usbfmi.com}}</ref> Gargoyle, Mobiloil and Mobiloil Special motor oils; Mobilgrease, Mobillubrication, Mobil Upperlube, Mobil Freezone and Permazone antifreezes, Mobilfluid automatic transmission fluid, Mobil Premiere tires, Mobil Stop-Leak, and Mobil Lustrecloth, among many others.\n\nIn 1954, Mobil introduced a new and improved Mobilgas Special in response to trends toward new automobiles powered by high-compression engines that demanded higher and higher [[octane rating|octane]] gasolines. The newest formulas of Mobilgas Special were advertised as offering \"A Tune-Up in Every Tankful\" due to a combination of chemicals known as the \"Mobil Power Compound\" which was designed to increase power, check pre-ignition ping, correct spark plug misfiring, control stalling and combat gumming up of carburetors. Later Mobil campaigns advertised Mobilgas as the \"New Car Gasoline\" following extensive testing during the annual Mobilgas Economy Run.\n\n[[File:MobilgasPumpsAntique09162007.JPG|thumb|150px|Vintage pumps, manufactured by [[Tokheim]], using the pre-1962 \"Mobilgas\" product name]]\nIn 1962, the gasoline product lines marketed as Mobilgas and Mobilgas Special were rebranded as Mobil Regular and Mobil Premium in a move to emphasize the shortened brand name \"Mobil\" in promotional efforts, although Mobiloil continued as a single-word term until the 1970s. After a few years of advertising Mobil gasolines as \"Megatane\"-rated and as \"High Energy\" gasolines, Mobil began, in 1966, to promote both its Regular and Premium fuels as \"Detergent Gasolines\", due to the inclusion of additives designed to clean [[carburetor]]s and various internal engine parts. During the early 1970s, Mobil ran a TV commercial featuring a character known as \"Mr. Dirt\" to show the ruinous effects that dirt had on automotive engines for which a tank of Mobil Detergent Gasoline could provide a cure and preventive medicine against damage that could lead to costly repairs.\n\nAs automakers were switching en masse from carbureted to [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] engines during the early to mid-1980s, and the detergent additives that existed in most available gasolines proved not to be enough to prevent injection clogging, leading to drivability problems, Mobil received accolades from [[General Motors]] and other automakers for increasing the detergency of its Super Unleaded gasoline in 1984 to prevent formation or deposit build-ups of the injectors but also remove existing deposits as well in normal driving. At the end of the 1980s Mobil sold its fuel stations in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], and [[Denmark]] to [[Norsk Hydro]], who converted them into [[Hydro (fuel station)|Hydro]] stations.\n\n[[William Tavoulareas|William P.

The stations were converted Mobil stations selling convenience store items in the station lobby, while the service bays were rented to customers for do-it-yourself auto repairs. These brands were discontinued in the 1980s, after the gasoline market had recovered.<ref>{{cite news| title=The State of Competition in Gasoline Marketing: The Effects of Refiner Operations at Retail| publisher=United States Department of Energy| author=Dr. James B.

Mobil continued to refine and enhance its convenience store offerings with the [[On the Run (convenience store)|On-the-Run]] C-store brand, which proved to be much more popular. On-the-Run was sold to [[Alimentation Couche-Tard]], operator of the Circle K convenience store chain.  Some On the Run locations were sold to 7-Eleven.\n\n===Mobil Travel Guide===\n\nThe [[Mobil Guide]] was an annual book of hotel and restaurant recommendations based on a system developed by Mobil in 1958. It rated businesses from one to five stars according to their assessed quality. In October 2009, ExxonMobil licensed the brand to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, which retitled the guide's various designations, e.g., Forbes Travel Guide, Forbes Five Stars, and so on. Forbes launched revised versions of various guides in late 2009.<ref>{{cite news| publisher=Associated Press| url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2009-08-05-mobil-forbes-guide_N.htm| title=Mobil Travel Guide to become Forbes Travel Guide| date=2009-08-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Hotel Rankings: Forbes Merges with Mobil| website=International Business Times| author=Carly Zinderman| date=2009-12-03| url=http://www.ibtimes.com/contents/20091203/hotel-rankings-forbes-merges-with-mobil.htm| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208173717/http://www.ibtimes.com/contents/20091203/hotel-rankings-forbes-merges-with-mobil.htm| archivedate=2009-12-08}}</ref>\n\n==Lukoil transaction==\n[[File:Mobil shimotoba.jpg|thumb|In Kyoto, Japan (2017)]]\nIn 2000, [[Lukoil]] purchased the remaining assets of [[Getty Oil]] and began opening Lukoil stations in the US in 2003. Most of the US Lukoil locations are converted Getty stations, although some are also converted Mobil stations bought from [[ConocoPhillips]] when that company left the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]].\n\nIn spring 2004, Lukoil purchased 779 Mobil gas stations throughout [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]], and in 2005 began converting them to the Lukoil brand. Most New Jersey Mobil locations were converted to Lukoil stations.\n\n==Mobil UK==\nVacuum Oil Company started selling lubricating oils in [[Europe]] in the late 19th century. By the 1930s its Mobiloil had become one of the main brands. Mobil gradually expanded its operation into fuels retailing as well, and opened its first [[United Kingdom|UK]] service stations in the early 1950s, after the wartime POOL monopoly was disbanded. Mobil grew to become the seventh largest brand of petrol in Britain, supplying 1,990 outlets in 1965, and claimed in the mid-1960s to be the first company to operate 100 self-service stations. As well as its downstream interests, Mobil was active in the [[North Sea oil|North Sea]] and operated an oil refinery in [[Coryton Refinery|Coryton]] (opened in 1953), on the [[Thames estuary]]. In 1996, Mobil's fuels operations in Europe were placed into a joint venture 70% owned by [[BP]], and the Mobil brand disappeared from service stations. Mobil continued to sell lubricants through BP and independent service stations. Following Mobil's merger with Exxon, at the start of 2000 BP acquired all the petrol retailing assets as well as the Coryton refinery (but sold it to [[Petroplus]] in 2007). Mobil returned to being purely a lubricant brand in Europe, and became the premium quality oil on sale at [[Esso]] service stations.\n\n==Mobil Australia==\n[[File:TV 4872, NRM, 2014.JPG|thumb|A preserved ex-[[South Australian Railways]] tank wagon in Plume livery]]\nThe Vacuum Oil Company began operating in [[Australia]] in 1895, introducing its Plume brand of petrol in 1916. The Flying Red Horse ([[Pegasus]]) logo was introduced in 1939, and in 1954, the Plume brand was replaced by Mobilgas.\n\nMobil Australia's corporate office is in [[Melbourne]]. In 1946, Mobil began construction of its refinery at [[Altona, Victoria|Altona]], in Melbourne's western suburbs, which originally produced lubricating oils and [[bitumen]], before commencing the production of motor vehicle fuels in 1956. A second refinery at [[Port Stanvac Refinery|Port Stanvac]], south of [[Adelaide]], came on-stream in 1963, but was closed in 2003.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://home.austarnet.com.au/jamieson/mobilgas.html |title=Jamieson oil industry history |publisher=Home.austarnet.com.au |date= |accessdate=2010-07-25}}</ref> Mobil commenced removal of the refinery in July 2009, together with site remediation works.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.exxonmobil.com.au/Australia-English/PA/news_releases_20090625.aspx |title=Mobil news |publisher=Exxonmobil.com.au |date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2010-07-25}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Mobil acquired the service station network of [[Esso Australia]].

It first began operating in New Zealand under the Standard Oil brand name selling kerosene in the 1870s. Early in 1896, Vacuum Oil of New York established a marketing office on Featherston Street in Wellington selling lamp oil and harness grease. It brought with it extensive collective production, marketing and management skills that presented a major advancement in business organisation. The company's unrivaled mineral lubricant products and associated services quickly dominated the market.\n\nWhen New Zealanders began taking to the motorcar in the early twentieth century, Vacuum Oil expanded into the oil refining business. Its marketing network and transportation fleet grew as it extended its range of operation. The company continued to meet New Zealand's fuel needs throughout World War One holding roughly eighty five percent of the market. However, after the war Vacuum Oil began facing very strong competition from a number of multinational oil companies which began setting up operations in New Zealand. Among these competitors was the Atlantic Union Oil Company, another of ExxonMobil's historical companies.\n\nAtlantic Union was bought by the New Jersey-based Standard Oil Company, which would later become Exxon, and its eastern hemisphere interests were merged with those of Socony-Vacuum Oil Company to create the Standard-Vacuum Oil Company. The new company continued operations in New Zealand under both the Vacuum and Atlantic Union brand names.\n\nOn November 30, 1999, Exxon Corporation and Mobil Oil Corporation merged with Mobil Oil New Zealand Limited now owned by new entity [[ExxonMobil]]. The company currently owns a 17.2 percent share in The New Zealand Refining Company Limited which operates an oil refinery at [[Marsden Point]] near the city of [[Whangarei]]. It supplies roughly twenty percent of the total fuels market in New Zealand which most of its products sourced from the Marsden Point refinery. Mobil Oil New Zealand Limited operates over one hundred and fifty locations across the country either as Mobil-owned stations or as franchises. It also operates six storage locations across the country maintaining a reputation as a dominant petroleum company in New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/company/worldwide-operations/locations/new-zealand/about/business-overview|title=Mobil Oil New Zealand Limited is New Zealand's oldest oil company, with predecessor companies having first established a presence in the country in 1896.|website=ExxonMobil}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/company/worldwide-operations/locations/new-zealand/about/operations?parentId=3c960acd-bad7-4dc6-9605-0139e8e1dbf9|title=ExxonMobil subsidiaries have a business history in New Zealand stretching back more than 120 years.

Socony continued to sponsor the show when it moved to [[CBS]] in 1934. In 1935, it became the ''Socony Sketchbook,'' with [[Christopher Morley]] and the [[Johnny Green]] orchestra.\n\nIn 1931, Socony merged with [[Vacuum Oil Company|Vacuum Oil]] to form Socony-Vacuum.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,882045,00.html \"Business & Finance: Socony-Vacuum Corp.\"] ''Time,'' 1931-08-10, retrieved on 2009-12-10.</ref>\n\nIn 1933, Socony-Vacuum and [[Exxon|Jersey Standard]] (which had oil production and refineries in [[Indonesia]]) merged their interests in the Far East into a 50\u201350 joint venture.

Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.]]'' The case originated with Socony-Vacuum's practices of organizing a cartel among the \"major\" oil companies in which they bought oil\u2014known as \"hot oil\"\u2014from independent producers and stored the surplus in tanks to limit the supply of oil available on the market and keep the price of oil artificially high. In its decision, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that regardless of the purpose of the price fixing or if the prices varied, such conduct was illegal in and of itself: \"Under the [[Sherman Act]] a combination formed for the purpose and with the effect of raising, depressing, fixing, pegging, or stabilizing the price of a commodity in interstate or foreign commerce is illegal ''per se''...\" This rule remains in use today for agreements that appear on their face to always or almost always restrict competition and reduce output.\n\n[[File:\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea \u05e1\u05d5\u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d0\u05e7\u05d5\u05dd - Socony Vacuum Oil Company-ZKlugerPhotos-000zmg0.jpeg|thumb|left|Socony-Vacuum \"benzine\" station with Mobil Oil sign, [[Allenby Street|Allenby Street, Tel Aviv]], 1939]]\n\n[[File:1962 Rambler ChampionPlug MobilEconRun AD.jpg|thumb|left|The Mobil Economy Run generated publicity and [[Promotion (marketing)|promotions]] such as this 1962 advertisement by [[Federal-Mogul|Champion spark plugs]] with a [[Rambler American]].]]\n\nIn 1955, Socony-Vacuum was renamed Socony Mobil Oil Company. In 1963, it changed its trade name from \"Mobiloil\" to simply \"Mobil\", introducing a new logo (created by New York graphic design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]). To celebrate its 100th anniversary in 1966, \"Socony\" was dropped from the corporate name.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1968, Mobil sponsored an [[Mobil Economy Run|economy run]] each year (except during [[World War II]]) in which domestic automobiles of various manufacturers in several price and size classes were driven by light-footed drivers on cross-country runs. The Economy Run originated with the [[Gilmore Oil Company]] of California in 1936 (which was purchased by Socony-Vacuum in 1940) and later became the Mobilgas Economy Run, and still later the Mobil Economy Run. The cars driven in the economy run were fueled with Mobil [[gasoline]], and Mobiloil and lubricants were also used. The vehicles in each class that achieved the highest fuel economy numbers were awarded the coveted title as the Mobilgas Economy Run winner.\n\nDuring American involvement in [[World War II]], April 29, 1942, Socony's unescorted tanker, named ''Mobiloil'', was sunk by a German [[U-boat]] ([[German Type IX submarine]] ''U-108'' captained by Klaus Schlotz), and all 52 people survived after 86 hours adrift in lifeboats.

Various Mobil products during the Socony-Vacuum and Socony-Mobil years included Metro, Mobilgas and Mobilgas Special gasolines; Mobilfuel Diesel, MobilHeat and Mobil-flame heating oil, Mobil Kerosine, [[Lubrite]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usbfmi.com/lube1.htm|title=Lubrite Technologies|website=Usbfmi.com}}</ref> Gargoyle, Mobiloil and Mobiloil Special motor oils; Mobilgrease, Mobillubrication, Mobil Upperlube, Mobil Freezone and Permazone antifreezes, Mobilfluid automatic transmission fluid, Mobil Premiere tires, Mobil Stop-Leak, and Mobil Lustrecloth, among many others.\n\nIn 1954, Mobil introduced a new and improved Mobilgas Special in response to trends toward new automobiles powered by high-compression engines that demanded higher and higher [[octane rating|octane]] gasolines. The newest formulas of Mobilgas Special were advertised as offering \"A Tune-Up in Every Tankful\" due to a combination of chemicals known as the \"Mobil Power Compound\" which was designed to increase power, check pre-ignition ping, correct spark plug misfiring, control stalling and combat gumming up of carburetors. Later Mobil campaigns advertised Mobilgas as the \"New Car Gasoline\" following extensive testing during the annual Mobilgas Economy Run.\n\n[[File:MobilgasPumpsAntique09162007.JPG|thumb|150px|Vintage pumps, manufactured by [[Tokheim]], using the pre-1962 \"Mobilgas\" product name]]\nIn 1962, the gasoline product lines marketed as Mobilgas and Mobilgas Special were rebranded as Mobil Regular and Mobil Premium in a move to emphasize the shortened brand name \"Mobil\" in promotional efforts, although Mobiloil continued as a single-word term until the 1970s. After a few years of advertising Mobil gasolines as \"Megatane\"-rated and as \"High Energy\" gasolines, Mobil began, in 1966, to promote both its Regular and Premium fuels as \"Detergent Gasolines\", due to the inclusion of additives designed to clean [[carburetor]]s and various internal engine parts. During the early 1970s, Mobil ran a TV commercial featuring a character known as \"Mr. Dirt\" to show the ruinous effects that dirt had on automotive engines for which a tank of Mobil Detergent Gasoline could provide a cure and preventive medicine against damage that could lead to costly repairs.\n\nAs automakers were switching en masse from carbureted to [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] engines during the early to mid-1980s, and the detergent additives that existed in most available gasolines proved not to be enough to prevent injection clogging, leading to drivability problems, Mobil received accolades from [[General Motors]] and other automakers for increasing the detergency of its Super Unleaded gasoline in 1984 to prevent formation or deposit build-ups of the injectors but also remove existing deposits as well in normal driving.

Most New Jersey Mobil locations were converted to Lukoil stations.\n\n==Mobil UK==\nVacuum Oil Company started selling lubricating oils in [[Europe]] in the late 19th century. By the 1930s its Mobiloil had become one of the main brands. Mobil gradually expanded its operation into fuels retailing as well, and opened its first [[United Kingdom|UK]] service stations in the early 1950s, after the wartime POOL monopoly was disbanded. Mobil grew to become the seventh largest brand of petrol in Britain, supplying 1,990 outlets in 1965, and claimed in the mid-1960s to be the first company to operate 100 self-service stations. As well as its downstream interests, Mobil was active in the [[North Sea oil|North Sea]] and operated an oil refinery in [[Coryton Refinery|Coryton]] (opened in 1953), on the [[Thames estuary]]. In 1996, Mobil's fuels operations in Europe were placed into a joint venture 70% owned by [[BP]], and the Mobil brand disappeared from service stations. Mobil continued to sell lubricants through BP and independent service stations. Following Mobil's merger with Exxon, at the start of 2000 BP acquired all the petrol retailing assets as well as the Coryton refinery (but sold it to [[Petroplus]] in 2007). Mobil returned to being purely a lubricant brand in Europe, and became the premium quality oil on sale at [[Esso]] service stations.\n\n==Mobil Australia==\n[[File:TV 4872, NRM, 2014.JPG|thumb|A preserved ex-[[South Australian Railways]] tank wagon in Plume livery]]\nThe Vacuum Oil Company began operating in [[Australia]] in 1895, introducing its Plume brand of petrol in 1916. The Flying Red Horse ([[Pegasus]]) logo was introduced in 1939, and in 1954, the Plume brand was replaced by Mobilgas.\n\nMobil Australia's corporate office is in [[Melbourne]]. In 1946, Mobil began construction of its refinery at [[Altona, Victoria|Altona]], in Melbourne's western suburbs, which originally produced lubricating oils and [[bitumen]], before commencing the production of motor vehicle fuels in 1956.

It first began operating in New Zealand under the Standard Oil brand name selling kerosene in the 1870s. Early in 1896, Vacuum Oil of New York established a marketing office on Featherston Street in Wellington selling lamp oil and harness grease. It brought with it extensive collective production, marketing and management skills that presented a major advancement in business organisation. The company's unrivaled mineral lubricant products and associated services quickly dominated the market.\n\nWhen New Zealanders began taking to the motorcar in the early twentieth century, Vacuum Oil expanded into the oil refining business. Its marketing network and transportation fleet grew as it extended its range of operation. The company continued to meet New Zealand's fuel needs throughout World War One holding roughly eighty five percent of the market. However, after the war Vacuum Oil began facing very strong competition from a number of multinational oil companies which began setting up operations in New Zealand. Among these competitors was the Atlantic Union Oil Company, another of ExxonMobil's historical companies.\n\nAtlantic Union was bought by the New Jersey-based Standard Oil Company, which would later become Exxon, and its eastern hemisphere interests were merged with those of Socony-Vacuum Oil Company to create the Standard-Vacuum Oil Company. The new company continued operations in New Zealand under both the Vacuum and Atlantic Union brand names.\n\nOn November 30, 1999, Exxon Corporation and Mobil Oil Corporation merged with Mobil Oil New Zealand Limited now owned by new entity [[ExxonMobil]]. The company currently owns a 17.2 percent share in The New Zealand Refining Company Limited which operates an oil refinery at [[Marsden Point]] near the city of [[Whangarei]]. It supplies roughly twenty percent of the total fuels market in New Zealand which most of its products sourced from the Marsden Point refinery. Mobil Oil New Zealand Limited operates over one hundred and fifty locations across the country either as Mobil-owned stations or as franchises. It also operates six storage locations across the country maintaining a reputation as a dominant petroleum company in New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/company/worldwide-operations/locations/new-zealand/about/business-overview|title=Mobil Oil New Zealand Limited is New Zealand's oldest oil company, with predecessor companies having first established a presence in the country in 1896.|website=ExxonMobil}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/company/worldwide-operations/locations/new-zealand/about/operations?parentId=3c960acd-bad7-4dc6-9605-0139e8e1dbf9|title=ExxonMobil subsidiaries have a business history in New Zealand stretching back more than 120 years.
