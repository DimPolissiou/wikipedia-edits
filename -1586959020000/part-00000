He became widely popular in his lifetime and remained so after his premature death at the age of 39 in New York City. By then he had acquired a reputation, which he had encouraged, as a \"roistering, drunken and doomed poet\".<ref name=\"WAEoW\">{{cite book |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Davies|editor1-link=John Davies (historian)|editor2-first=Nigel |editor2-last=Jenkins | editor2-link=Nigel Jenkins| editor3-first=Baines |editor3-last=Menna|editor4-first=Peredur I. |editor4-last=Lynch|title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |year=2008 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff |pages=861\u2013862|isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6}}</ref>\n\nThomas was born in [[Swansea]], [[Wales]], in 1914. An undistinguished pupil, he left school at 16 and became a journalist for a short time. Many of his works appeared in print while he was still a teenager, and the publication in 1934 of \"Light breaks where no sun shines\" caught the attention of the literary world. While living in London, Thomas met [[Caitlin Thomas|Caitlin Macnamara]], whom he married in 1937. In 1938, they moved to the Welsh fishing village of [[Laugharne]] where from 1949 they settled permanently and brought up their three children.\n\nThomas came to be appreciated as a popular poet during his lifetime, though he found earning a living as a writer difficult. He began augmenting his income with reading tours and radio broadcasts. His radio recordings for the [[BBC]] during the late 1940s brought him to the public's attention, and he was frequently used by the BBC as an accessible voice of the literary scene.\n\nThomas first travelled to the United States in the 1950s. His readings there brought him a degree of fame, while his erratic behaviour and drinking worsened. His time in America cemented his legend, however, and he went on to record to [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] such works as ''A Child's Christmas in Wales''. During his fourth trip to New York in 1953, Thomas became gravely ill and fell into a coma, from which he never recovered. He died on 9 November 1953. His body was returned to Wales, where he was interred at the churchyard of St Martin's in Laugharne on 25 November 1953.\n\nAlthough Thomas wrote exclusively in the English language, he has been acknowledged as one of the most important Welsh poets of the 20th century. He is noted for his original, rhythmic and ingenious use of words and imagery. His position as one of the great modern poets has been much discussed, and he remains popular with the public.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Dylan thomas birthplace.jpg|thumb|upright|left|5 Cwmdonkin Drive, [[Swansea]], birthplace of Dylan Thomas|alt=On a hill street stands a two storied semi-detached house with bay windows to the front and a sloped tiled roof with a chimney.]]\n\nDylan Thomas was born on 27 October 1914 in [[Swansea]], the son of Florence Hannah (''n\u00e9e'' Williams; 1882\u20131958), a [[seamstress]], and David John Thomas (1876\u20131952), a teacher.

His images were carefully ordered in a patterned sequence, and his major theme was the unity of all life, the continuing process of life and death and new life that linked the generations. Thomas saw biology as a magical transformation producing unity out of diversity, and in his poetry sought a poetic ritual to celebrate this unity. He saw men and women locked in cycles of growth, love, [[procreation]], new growth, death, and new life. Therefore, each image engenders its opposite. Thomas derived his closely woven, sometimes self-contradictory images from the Bible, [[Welsh mythology|Welsh folklore]], preaching, and [[Sigmund Freud]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=M.

He became widely popular in his lifetime and remained so after his premature death at the age of 39 in New York City. By then he had acquired a reputation, which he had encouraged, as a \"roistering, drunken and doomed poet\".<ref name=\"WAEoW\">{{cite book |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Davies|editor1-link=John Davies (historian)|editor2-first=Nigel |editor2-last=Jenkins | editor2-link=Nigel Jenkins| editor3-first=Baines |editor3-last=Menna|editor4-first=Peredur I. |editor4-last=Lynch|title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |year=2008 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff |pages=861\u2013862|isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6}}</ref>\n\nThomas was born in [[Swansea]], [[Wales]], in 1914. An undistinguished pupil, he left school at 16 and became a journalist for a short time. Many of his works appeared in print while he was still a teenager, and the publication in 1934 of \"Light breaks where no sun shines\" caught the attention of the literary world. While living in London, Thomas met [[Caitlin Thomas|Caitlin Macnamara]], whom he married in 1937. In 1938, they moved to the Welsh fishing village of [[Laugharne]] where from 1949 they settled permanently and brought up their three children.\n\nThomas came to be appreciated as a popular poet during his lifetime, though he found earning a living as a writer difficult. He began augmenting his income with reading tours and radio broadcasts. His radio recordings for the [[BBC]] during the late 1940s brought him to the public's attention, and he was frequently used by the BBC as an accessible voice of the literary scene.\n\nThomas first travelled to the United States in the 1950s. His readings there brought him a degree of fame, while his erratic behaviour and drinking worsened. His time in America cemented his legend, however, and he went on to record to [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] such works as ''A Child's Christmas in Wales''. During his fourth trip to New York in 1953, Thomas became gravely ill and fell into a coma, from which he never recovered. He died on 9 November 1953. His body was returned to Wales, where he was interred at the churchyard of St Martin's in Laugharne on 25 November 1953.\n\nAlthough Thomas wrote exclusively in the English language, he has been acknowledged as one of the most important Welsh poets of the 20th century. He is noted for his original, rhythmic and ingenious use of words and imagery. His position as one of the great modern poets has been much discussed, and he remains popular with the public.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Dylan thomas birthplace.jpg|thumb|upright|left|5 Cwmdonkin Drive, [[Swansea]], birthplace of Dylan Thomas|alt=On a hill street stands a two storied semi-detached house with bay windows to the front and a sloped tiled roof with a chimney.]]\n\nDylan Thomas was born on 27 October 1914 in [[Swansea]], the son of Florence Hannah (''n\u00e9e'' Williams; 1882\u20131958), a [[seamstress]], and David John Thomas (1876\u20131952), a teacher.

His images were carefully ordered in a patterned sequence, and his major theme was the unity of all life, the continuing process of life and death and new life that linked the generations. Thomas saw biology as a magical transformation producing unity out of diversity, and in his poetry sought a poetic ritual to celebrate this unity. He saw men and women locked in cycles of growth, love, [[procreation]], new growth, death, and new life. Therefore, each image engenders its opposite. Thomas derived his closely woven, sometimes self-contradictory images from the Bible, [[Welsh mythology|Welsh folklore]], preaching, and [[Sigmund Freud]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=M.

Identifying and shifting electrical loads can reduce power bills by taking advantage of lower off-peak rates and flatten demand peaks. Traditionally, the energy system has treated consumer demand as fixed and used centralised supply options to manage variable demand. Now, better data systems and emerging onsite storageand generation technologies can combine with advanced, automated demand control software to pro-actively manage demand and respond to energy market prices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Renewable Energy and Load Management|url=https://arena.gov.au/assets/2018/10/REALM-Industry-Report_public_FINAL.pdf|publisher=UTS University of Technology Sydney|accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.\n\n[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.\n\n[[Demand response]] devices can receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This allows electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. [[Vehicle-to-grid]] uses a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.\n\n\n===Decarbonization of transport===\n[[File:Societe de transport de Montreal bus 36-902 - 08.jpg|thumb|[[Electric bus]] in [[Montreal]]]]\n{{Main|Electrification|Electric vehicle}}Between a quarter and three-quarters of cars on the road by 2050 are forecast to be electric.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bhp.com/media-and-insights/prospects/2019/05/the-electrification-of-transport-episode-one|title=The electrification of transport: episode one|website=BHP|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> \n[[Hydrogen]] can be a solution for long-distance transport by trucks and [[hydrogen-powered ship]]s where batteries alone are too heavy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/want-electric-ships-build-a-better-battery/|title=Want Electric Ships?

Generally, electrification of heating would only reduce GHG emissions if the electric power comes from low-carbon sources. A fossil-fuel power station may only deliver 3 units of electrical energy for every 10 units of fuel energy released. Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]] to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid. \n\n====Heat pump====\n{{Main|Heat pump}}\n[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|upright|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]\nA modern heat pump typically produces around three times more thermal energy than electrical energy consumed, giving an effective efficiency of 300%, depending on the [[coefficient of performance]]. It uses an electrically driven compressor to operate a [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration cycle]] that extracts heat energy from outdoor air and moves that heat to the space to be warmed. In the summer months, the cycle can be reversed for [[air conditioner|air conditioning]].\nIn areas with average winter temperatures well below freezing, ground source heat pumps are more efficient than air-source heat pumps.

Personal cars are extremely inefficient at moving passengers, while [[public transport]] and bicycles are many times more efficient (as is the simplest form of human transportation, walking). All of these are encouraged by urban/community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.\n\nAt the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These [[smart growth]] practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nApproaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage [[public transit]] and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options. This is achieved through \"medium-density\", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.<!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book \"Sustainability and Cities\" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.-->\n\nSmarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.\n\n====Building design====\n{{Main|Sustainable architecture|Green building}}\n\nEmissions from [[house|housing]] are substantial,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.est.org.uk/myhome/climatechange/stats/homeenvironment/ |title=Energy Saving Trust: Home and the environment |publisher=[[Energy Saving Trust]] |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> and government-supported energy efficiency programmes can make a difference.<ref>{{cite news\n|last= Osborne\n|first= Hilary\n|title= Energy efficiency 'saves \u00a3350m a year'\n|newspaper= Guardian Unlimited\n|date= 2005-08-02\n|url= http://money.guardian.co.uk/utilities/story/0,11992,1541051,00.html?gusrc=ticker-103704\n|location=London}}</ref>\n\nNew buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources.

Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.\n*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the \"polluter-pays principle\", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:\n**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;29).<ref name=goldemberg>{{cite book\n|year=1996\n|author=Goldemberg, J.\n|title=Introduction: scope of the assessment.

Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].\n**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit{{cn|date=November 2019}} from reducing their emissions.\n\n====Specific proposals====\n*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;106),<ref name=banuri/> for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.\n*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;106\u2013107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.\n*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;27).<ref name=goldemberg/> In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource. It was also recognized by the state that part of the other state's economy was dependent on that resource.\n\n==Governmental and intergovernmental action==\n{{Main|Politics of global warming}}\n{{See also|Global warming#Political response}}\n{{Reduced pull quote|1=right\n|2=Bringing down emissions of greenhouse gases asks a good deal of people, not least that they accept the science of climate change.

J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon</ref>\n\n====Funding====\n{{main|Climate Finance}}\nFunding, such as the [[Green Climate Fund]], is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.<ref name=\"Evans\"/> The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added.

The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.<ref name=\"IHDP\">Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat.

One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit</ref> is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.\n\nAn important point of contention, however, is how [[overseas development]] assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.<ref name=ODI>Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.<ref name=ODI/> Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:<ref name=ODI/>\n# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];\n# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;\n# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and\n# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.\nThe main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name=ODI/>\n\nHowever, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.\n\nIn an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] \"which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services\".<ref>[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&Cr=trade&Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2019 week of climate action in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] result in a declaration in which leaders says that they will act to reduce emissions in the sectors of transportation, energy, urbanism, industry, forest conservation and land use and \"sent a message of solidarity with all the people of Brazil suffering the consequences of the [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|rainforest fires in the Amazon region]], underscoring that protecting the world's forests is a collective responsibility, that forests are vital for life and that they are a critical part of the solution to climate change\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 Key Messages for the UN Climate Action Summit |url=https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/LACCW%202019%20Messages%20for%20UN%20Climate%20Action%20Summit.pdf |website=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Latin American & Caribbean Climate Week Calls for Urgent, Ambitious Action |url=https://unfccc.int/news/latin-american-caribbean-climate-week-calls-for-urgent-ambitious-action |website=United Nations Climate Change |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Non-governmental approaches==\nWhile many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.\n\n===Choices in personal actions and business operations===\nEnvironmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]].

Identifying and shifting electrical loads can reduce power bills by taking advantage of lower off-peak rates and flatten demand peaks. Traditionally, the energy system has treated consumer demand as fixed and used centralised supply options to manage variable demand. Now, better data systems and emerging onsite storageand generation technologies can combine with advanced, automated demand control software to pro-actively manage demand and respond to energy market prices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Renewable Energy and Load Management|url=https://arena.gov.au/assets/2018/10/REALM-Industry-Report_public_FINAL.pdf|publisher=UTS University of Technology Sydney|accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.\n\n[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.\n\n[[Demand response]] devices can receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This allows electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day.

Generally, electrification of heating would only reduce GHG emissions if the electric power comes from low-carbon sources. A fossil-fuel power station may only deliver 3 units of electrical energy for every 10 units of fuel energy released. Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]] to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid. \n\n====Heat pump====\n{{Main|Heat pump}}\n[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|upright|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]\nA modern heat pump typically produces around three times more thermal energy than electrical energy consumed, giving an effective efficiency of 300%, depending on the [[coefficient of performance]]. It uses an electrically driven compressor to operate a [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration cycle]] that extracts heat energy from outdoor air and moves that heat to the space to be warmed. In the summer months, the cycle can be reversed for [[air conditioner|air conditioning]].\nIn areas with average winter temperatures well below freezing, ground source heat pumps are more efficient than air-source heat pumps.

This is achieved through \"medium-density\", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.<!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book \"Sustainability and Cities\" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.-->\n\nSmarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.\n\n====Building design====\n{{Main|Sustainable architecture|Green building}}\n\nEmissions from [[house|housing]] are substantial,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.est.org.uk/myhome/climatechange/stats/homeenvironment/ |title=Energy Saving Trust: Home and the environment |publisher=[[Energy Saving Trust]] |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> and government-supported energy efficiency programmes can make a difference.<ref>{{cite news\n|last= Osborne\n|first= Hilary\n|title= Energy efficiency 'saves \u00a3350m a year'\n|newspaper= Guardian Unlimited\n|date= 2005-08-02\n|url= http://money.guardian.co.uk/utilities/story/0,11992,1541051,00.html?gusrc=ticker-103704\n|location=London}}</ref>\n\nNew buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources.

Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.\n*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the \"polluter-pays principle\", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:\n**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;29).<ref name=goldemberg>{{cite book\n|year=1996\n|author=Goldemberg, J.\n|title=Introduction: scope of the assessment.

Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].\n**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit{{cn|date=November 2019}} from reducing their emissions.\n\n====Specific proposals====\n*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;106),<ref name=banuri/> for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.\n*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;106\u2013107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.\n*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;27).<ref name=goldemberg/> In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource. It was also recognized by the state that part of the other state's economy was dependent on that resource.\n\n==Governmental and intergovernmental action==\n{{Main|Politics of global warming}}\n{{See also|Global warming#Political response}}\n{{Reduced pull quote|1=right\n|2=Bringing down emissions of greenhouse gases asks a good deal of people, not least that they accept the science of climate change.

These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.<ref name=\"Evans\">Evans. J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon</ref>\n\n====Funding====\n{{main|Climate Finance}}\nFunding, such as the [[Green Climate Fund]], is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.<ref name=\"Evans\"/> The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.<ref>Mee. L. D, Dublin. H.

The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.<ref name=\"IHDP\">Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat.

One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit</ref> is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.\n\nAn important point of contention, however, is how [[overseas development]] assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.<ref name=ODI>Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.<ref name=ODI/> Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:<ref name=ODI/>\n# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];\n# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;\n# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and\n# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.\nThe main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name=ODI/>\n\nHowever, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.\n\nIn an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] \"which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services\".<ref>[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&Cr=trade&Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2019 week of climate action in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] result in a declaration in which leaders says that they will act to reduce emissions in the sectors of transportation, energy, urbanism, industry, forest conservation and land use and \"sent a message of solidarity with all the people of Brazil suffering the consequences of the [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|rainforest fires in the Amazon region]], underscoring that protecting the world's forests is a collective responsibility, that forests are vital for life and that they are a critical part of the solution to climate change\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 Key Messages for the UN Climate Action Summit |url=https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/LACCW%202019%20Messages%20for%20UN%20Climate%20Action%20Summit.pdf |website=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Latin American & Caribbean Climate Week Calls for Urgent, Ambitious Action |url=https://unfccc.int/news/latin-american-caribbean-climate-week-calls-for-urgent-ambitious-action |website=United Nations Climate Change |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Non-governmental approaches==\nWhile many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.\n\n===Choices in personal actions and business operations===\nEnvironmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]].
