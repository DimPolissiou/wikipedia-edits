Raven thought that the tests commonly in use at that time were cumbersome to administer and the results difficult to interpret. Accordingly, he set about developing simple measures of the two main components of [[G factor (psychometrics)|Spearman's ''g'']]: the ability to think clearly and make sense of complexity (known as eductive ability) and the ability to store and reproduce information (known as reproductive ability).\n\nRaven's tests of both were developed with the aid of what later became known as [[item response theory]].\n\nRaven first published his Progressive Matrices in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1938. His three sons established [[Scotland]]-based test publisher J C Raven Ltd. in 1972. In 2004, [[Harcourt Assessment|Harcourt Assessment, Inc.]] a division of [[Harcourt Education]] acquired J C Raven Ltd. Harcourt was later acquired by [[Pearson PLC]].\n\n==Versions==\nThe Matrices are available in three different forms for participants of different ability:\n\n* '''Standard Progressive Matrices:''' These were the original form of the matrices, first published in 1938. The booklet comprises five sets (A to E) of 12 items each (e.g., A1 through A12), with items within a set becoming increasingly difficult, requiring ever greater cognitive capacity to encode and analyze information. All items are presented in black ink on a white background.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Psychological Testing: An Introduction|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OiKau0aqtsYC|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2006-04-24|isbn = 9781139455145|language = en|first = George|last = Domino|first2 = Marla L.|last2 = Domino}}</ref>\n* '''Colored Progressive Matrices:''' Designed for children aged 5 through 11 years-of-age, the elderly, and mentally and physically impaired individuals. This test contains sets A and B from the standard matrices, with a further set of 12 items inserted between the two, as set Ab. Most items are presented on a coloured background to make the test visually stimulating for participants. However the very last few items in set B are presented as [[black-on-white]]; in this way, if a subject exceeds the tester's expectations, transition to sets C, D, and E of the standard matrices is eased.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* '''Advanced Progressive Matrices:''' The advanced form of the matrices contains 48 items, presented as one set of 12 (set I), and another of 36 (set II). Items are again presented in black ink on a white background, and become increasingly difficult as progress is made through each set. These items are appropriate for adults and adolescents of above-average intelligence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn addition, \"parallel\" forms of the standard and coloured progressive matrices were published in 1998. This was to address the problem of the Raven's Matrices being too well known in the general population.  Items in the parallel tests have been constructed so that average solution rates to each question are identical for the classic and parallel versions. A revised version of the SPM \u2013 the '''Standard Progressive Matrices Plus''' \u2013 was published at the same time. This was based on the \"parallel\" version but, although the test was the same length, it had more difficult items in order to restore the [[discrimination]] that the original SPM had among more able adolescents and young adults when it was first published. This new test, developed with the aid of better sampling arrangements and developments in the procedures available to implement the [[item response theory]], has turned out to have exemplary test properties.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Uses==\nThe tests were initially developed for research purposes. Because of their independence of language and reading and writing skills, and the simplicity of their use and interpretation, they quickly found widespread practical application. For example, all entrants to the British armed forces from 1942 onwards took a twenty-minute version of the SPM, and potential officers took a specially adapted version as part of British [[War Office Selection Boards]]. The routine administration of what became the Standard Progressive Matrices to all entrants (conscripts) to many military services throughout the world (including the Soviet Union) continued at least until the present century. It was by bringing together these data that [[James Flynn (academic)|James R. Flynn]] was able to place the intergenerational increase in scores beyond reasonable doubt.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Flynn, James R. |title=Massive IQ Gains in 14 Nations: What IQ Tests Really Measure |journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]] |volume=101 |issue=2 |pages=171\u2013191 |date= March 1987  |url=http://www.iapsych.com/iqmr/fe/LinkedDocuments/flynn1987.pdf |accessdate=13 May 2013 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.101.2.171 |ref=harv }}</ref> Flynn's path-breaking publications on IQ gains around the world have led to the phenomenon of the gains being known as the [[Flynn effect]].

In 2004, [[Harcourt Assessment|Harcourt Assessment, Inc.]] a division of [[Harcourt Education]] acquired J C Raven Ltd. Harcourt was later acquired by [[Pearson PLC]].\n\n==Versions==\nThe Matrices are available in three different forms for participants of different ability:\n\n* '''Standard Progressive Matrices:''' These were the original form of the matrices, first published in 1938. The booklet comprises five sets (A to E) of 12 items each (e.g., A1 through A12), with items within a set becoming increasingly difficult, requiring ever greater cognitive capacity to encode and analyze information. All items are presented in black ink on a white background.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Psychological Testing: An Introduction|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OiKau0aqtsYC|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2006-04-24|isbn = 9781139455145|language = en|first = George|last = Domino|first2 = Marla L.|last2 = Domino}}</ref>\n* '''Colored Progressive Matrices:''' Designed for children aged 5 through 11 years-of-age, the elderly, and mentally and physically impaired individuals. This test contains sets A and B from the standard matrices, with a further set of 12 items inserted between the two, as set Ab. Most items are presented on a coloured background to make the test visually stimulating for participants. However the very last few items in set B are presented as [[black-on-white]]; in this way, if a subject exceeds the tester's expectations, transition to sets C, D, and E of the standard matrices is eased.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* '''Advanced Progressive Matrices:''' The advanced form of the matrices contains 48 items, presented as one set of 12 (set I), and another of 36 (set II). Items are again presented in black ink on a white background, and become increasingly difficult as progress is made through each set. These items are appropriate for adults and adolescents of above-average intelligence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn addition, \"parallel\" forms of the standard and coloured progressive matrices were published in 1998. This was to address the problem of the Raven's Matrices being too well known in the general population.  Items in the parallel tests have been constructed so that average solution rates to each question are identical for the classic and parallel versions. A revised version of the SPM \u2013 the '''Standard Progressive Matrices Plus''' \u2013 was published at the same time. This was based on the \"parallel\" version but, although the test was the same length, it had more difficult items in order to restore the [[discrimination]] that the original SPM had among more able adolescents and young adults when it was first published. This new test, developed with the aid of better sampling arrangements and developments in the procedures available to implement the [[item response theory]], has turned out to have exemplary test properties.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Uses==\nThe tests were initially developed for research purposes. Because of their independence of language and reading and writing skills, and the simplicity of their use and interpretation, they quickly found widespread practical application. For example, all entrants to the British armed forces from 1942 onwards took a twenty-minute version of the SPM, and potential officers took a specially adapted version as part of British [[War Office Selection Boards]]. The routine administration of what became the Standard Progressive Matrices to all entrants (conscripts) to many military services throughout the world (including the Soviet Union) continued at least until the present century. It was by bringing together these data that [[James Flynn (academic)|James R.

Formally, these vectors are elements of a [[complex number|complex]] [[Separable space|separable]] [[Hilbert space]]&nbsp;\u2013 variously called the [[State space (physics)|''state space'']] or the ''associated Hilbert space'' of the system&nbsp;\u2013 that is well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the phase factor). In other words, the possible states are points in the [[projective space]] of a Hilbert space, usually called the [[complex projective space]]. The exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on the system&nbsp;\u2013 for example, the state space for position and momentum states is the space of [[square-integrable]] functions, while the state space for the spin of a single proton is just the product of two complex planes. Each observable is represented by a maximally [[Hermitian adjoint|Hermitian]] (precisely: by a [[self-adjoint operator|self-adjoint]]) linear [[Operator (physics)|operator]] acting on the state space. Each [[eigenstate]] of an observable corresponds to an [[eigenvector]] of the operator, and the associated [[eigenvalue]] corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate. If the operator's spectrum is discrete, the observable can attain only those discrete eigenvalues.\n\nIn the formalism of quantum mechanics, the state of a system at a given time is described by a [[complex number|complex]] [[wave function]], also referred to as state vector in a complex [[vector space]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Quantum Mechanics Symmetries, Second edition|first1=Walter|last1=Greiner|first2=Berndt|last2=M\u00fcller|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|isbn=978-3-540-58080-5|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gCfvWx6vuzUC&pg=PA52}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gCfvWx6vuzUC&pg=PA52 Chapter 1, p. 52]</ref> This abstract mathematical object allows for the calculation of [[probability|probabilities]] of outcomes of concrete experiments. For example, it allows one to compute the probability of finding an electron in a particular region around the nucleus at a particular time. Contrary to classical mechanics, one can never make simultaneous predictions of [[conjugate variables]], such as position and momentum, to arbitrary precision. For instance, electrons may be considered (to a certain probability) to be located somewhere within a given region of space, but with their exact positions unknown. Contours of constant probability density, often referred to as \"clouds\", may be drawn around the nucleus of an atom to conceptualize where the electron might be located with the most probability. Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]] quantifies the inability to precisely locate the particle given its conjugate momentum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/history/heisenberg/p08a.htm |title=Heisenberg \u2013 Quantum Mechanics, 1925\u20131927: The Uncertainty Relations |publisher=Aip.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref>\n\nAccording to one interpretation, as the result of a measurement, the wave function containing the probability information for a system [[Collapse of the wavefunction|collapses]] from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator representing the observable&nbsp;\u2013 which explains the choice of ''Hermitian'' operators, for which all the eigenvalues are real. The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the [[spectral theorem|spectral decomposition]] of the corresponding operator. Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]] is represented by the statement that the operators corresponding to certain observables do not [[Commutator|commute]].\n\nThe [[probability|probabilistic]] nature of quantum mechanics thus stems from the act of measurement. This is one of the most difficult aspects of quantum systems to understand. It was the central topic in the famous [[Bohr\u2013Einstein debates]], in which the two scientists attempted to clarify these fundamental principles by way of [[thought experiment]]s. In the decades after the formulation of quantum mechanics, the question of what constitutes a \"measurement\" has been extensively studied. Newer [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations of quantum mechanics]] have been formulated that do away with the concept of \"[[Collapse of the wavefunction|wave function collapse]]\" (see, for example, the [[relative state interpretation]]). The basic idea is that when a quantum system interacts with a measuring apparatus, their respective wave functions become [[Quantum Entanglement|entangled]], so that the original quantum system ceases to exist as an independent entity.

Instead, it makes a prediction using a [[probability distribution]]; that is, it describes the probability of obtaining the possible outcomes from measuring an observable. Often these results are skewed by many causes, such as dense probability clouds. Probability clouds are approximate (but better than [[Bohr model|the Bohr model]]) whereby electron location is given by a [[probability function]], the [[wave function]] [[eigenvalue]], such that the probability is the squared modulus of the [[probability amplitude|complex amplitude]], or [[quantum state]] nuclear attraction.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lodha |first1=Suresh K. |last2=Faaland |first2=Nikolai M. |last3=Charaniya |first3=Amin P. |last4=Varshney |first4=Pramod K. |last5=Mehrotra |first5=Kishan |last6=Mohan |first6=Chilukuri |display-authors=2 |title=Visualization of Uncertain Particle Movement (Proceeding Computer Graphics and Imaging) |url=ftp://classes.soe.ucsc.edu/.zfs/snapshot/2014-01-01/pub/lodha/papers/cgim2002.pdf |publisher=Actapress.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801014205/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e7a4/ae7e57164c4afd726b567f863cce94ba9f86.pdf |archivedate=2018-08-01 |date=2002 |access-date=2018-08-01 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Dark Side of the Force: Economic Foundations of Conflict Theory|first1=Jack|last1=Hirshleifer|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-521-80412-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/darksideofforcee00hirs/page/265 265]|url=https://archive.org/details/darksideofforcee00hirs|url-access=registration}}, [https://archive.org/details/darksideofforcee00hirs/page/265 Chapter, p. ]</ref> Naturally, these probabilities will depend on the quantum state at the \"instant\" of the measurement. Hence, uncertainty is involved in the value. There are, however, certain states that are associated with a definite value of a particular observable. These are known as [[eigenstate]]s of the observable (\"eigen\" can be translated from German as meaning \"inherent\" or \"characteristic\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dict.cc/german-english/eigen.html|title=dict.cc dictionary :: eigen :: German-English translation|date=|work=dict.cc|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the everyday world, it is natural and intuitive to think of everything (every observable) as being in an eigenstate. Everything appears to have a definite position, a definite momentum, a definite energy, and a definite time of occurrence. However, quantum mechanics does not pinpoint the exact values of a particle's position and momentum (since they are [[Conjugate variables|conjugate pairs]]) or its energy and time (since they too are conjugate pairs).  Rather, it provides only a range of probabilities in which that particle might be given its momentum and momentum probability. Therefore, it is helpful to use different words to describe states having ''[[Uncertainty principle|uncertain]]'' values and states having ''definite'' values (eigenstates).\n\nUsually, a system will not be in an [[eigenstate]] of the observable (particle) we are interested in. However, if one measures the observable, the wave function will instantaneously be an eigenstate (or \"generalized\" eigenstate) of that observable. This process is known as [[wave function collapse]], a controversial and much-debated process<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phy.olemiss.edu/~luca/Topics/qm/collapse.html |title=Topics: Wave-Function Collapse |publisher=Phy.olemiss.edu |date=2012-07-27 |accessdate=2012-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228044927/http://www.phy.olemiss.edu/~luca/Topics/qm/collapse.html |archive-date=2017-02-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> that involves expanding the system under study to include the measurement device. If one knows the corresponding wave function at the instant before the measurement, one will be able to compute the probability of the wave function collapsing into each of the possible eigenstates.\n\nFor example, the free particle in the previous example will usually have a wave function that is a [[wave packet]] centered around some mean position ''x''<sub>0</sub> (neither an eigenstate of position nor of momentum). When one measures the position of the particle, it is impossible to predict with certainty the result.<ref name=\"google215\"/> It is probable, but not certain, that it will be near ''x''<sub>0</sub>, where the amplitude of the wave function is large.

The [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] describes how wave functions change in time, playing a role similar to [[Newton's second law]] in [[classical mechanics]]. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation, applied to the aforementioned example of the free particle, predicts that the center of a wave packet will move through space at a constant velocity (like a classical particle with no forces acting on it). However, the wave packet will also spread out as time progresses, which means that the position becomes more uncertain with time. This also has the effect of turning a position eigenstate (which can be thought of as an infinitely sharp wave packet) into a broadened wave packet that no longer represents a (definite, certain) position eigenstate.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Textbook of Quantum Mechanics|first1=Piravonu Mathews|last1=Mathews|first2=K.|last2=Venkatesan|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=978-0-07-096510-2|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qzs1DD3TcsC&pg=PA36}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_qzs1DD3TcsC&pg=PA36 Chapter 2, p. 36]</ref>\n\n[[File:Atomic-orbital-clouds spd m0.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Fig. 1: [[Probability density function|Probability densities]] corresponding to the wave functions of an electron in a hydrogen atom possessing definite energy levels (increasing from the top of the image to the bottom: ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ...) and angular momenta (increasing across from left to right: ''s'', ''p'', ''d'', ...).

One method, called [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]], uses the analytic result for a simple quantum mechanical model to create a result for a related but more complicated model by (for example) the addition of a weak [[potential energy]]. Another method is called \"semi-classical equation of motion\", which applies to systems for which quantum mechanics produces only small deviations from classical behavior. These deviations can then be computed based on the classical motion.

Heisenberg acknowledges having learned matrices from Born, as published in a 1940 ''[[festschrift]]'' honoring [[Max Planck]].<ref>Nancy Thorndike Greenspan, \"The End of the Certain World: The Life and Science of Max Born\" (Basic Books, 2005), pp. 124\u2013128, 285\u2013826.</ref>  In the matrix formulation, the instantaneous state of a quantum system encodes the probabilities of its measurable properties, or \"[[observable]]s\".

This is the quantum-mechanical counterpart of the [[action principle]] in classical mechanics.\n\n==Relation to other scientific theories==\nThe rules of quantum mechanics are fundamental. They assert that the state space of a system is a [[Hilbert space]] (crucially, that the space has an [[inner product]]) and that observables of the system are [[Hermitian operators]] acting on vectors in that space&nbsp;\u2013 although they do not tell us which Hilbert space or which operators. These can be chosen appropriately in order to obtain a quantitative description of a quantum system. An important guide for making these choices is the [[correspondence principle]], which states that the predictions of quantum mechanics reduce to those of classical mechanics when a system moves to higher energies or, equivalently, larger quantum numbers, i.e. whereas a single particle exhibits a degree of randomness, in systems incorporating millions of particles averaging takes over and, at the high energy limit, the statistical probability of random behaviour approaches zero. In other words, classical mechanics is simply a quantum mechanics of large systems. This \"high energy\" limit is known as the ''classical'' or ''correspondence limit''. One can even start from an established classical model of a particular system, then try to guess the underlying quantum model that would give rise to the classical model in the correspondence limit.\n\n{{unsolved|physics|In the [[correspondence limit]] of '''quantum mechanics''': Is there a preferred interpretation of quantum mechanics? How does the quantum description of reality, which includes elements such as the \"[[superposition principle|superposition]] of states\" and \"[[wave function collapse]]\", give rise to the reality we perceive?}}\nWhen quantum mechanics was originally formulated, it was applied to models whose correspondence limit was [[theory of relativity|non-relativistic]] [[classical mechanics]]. For instance, the well-known model of the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] uses an explicitly non-relativistic expression for the [[kinetic energy]] of the oscillator, and is thus a quantum version of the [[harmonic oscillator|classical harmonic oscillator]].\n\nEarly attempts to merge quantum mechanics with [[special relativity]] involved the replacement of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a covariant equation such as the [[Klein\u2013Gordon equation]] or the [[Dirac equation]]. While these theories were successful in explaining many experimental results, they had certain unsatisfactory qualities stemming from their neglect of the relativistic creation and annihilation of particles. A fully relativistic quantum theory required the development of [[quantum field theory]], which applies quantization to a field (rather than a fixed set of particles). The first complete quantum field theory, [[quantum electrodynamics]], provides a fully quantum description of the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]]. The full apparatus of quantum field theory is often unnecessary for describing electrodynamic systems. A simpler approach, one that has been used since the inception of quantum mechanics, is to treat [[electric charge|charged]] particles as quantum mechanical objects being acted on by a classical [[electromagnetic field]]. For example, the elementary quantum model of the [[hydrogen atom]] describes the [[electric field]] of the hydrogen atom using a classical <math>\\textstyle -e^2/(4 \\pi\\epsilon_{_0}r)</math> [[Electric potential|Coulomb potential]]. This \"semi-classical\" approach fails if quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field play an important role, such as in the emission of [[photon]]s by [[charged particle]]s.\n\n[[Field (physics)|Quantum field]] theories for the [[strong nuclear force]] and the [[weak nuclear force]] have also been developed. The quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force is called [[quantum chromodynamics]], and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s. The weak nuclear force and the [[electromagnetic force]] were unified, in their quantized forms, into a single quantum field theory (known as [[electroweak theory]]), by the physicists [[Abdus Salam]], [[Sheldon Glashow]] and [[Steven Weinberg]].

In some cases it appears that there are potentially several spatially distinct pathways or trajectories by which a particle might pass from initial to final condition. It is an important feature of the quantum kinematic description that it does not permit a unique definite statement of which of those pathways is actually followed. Only the initial and final conditions are definite, and, as stated in the foregoing paragraph, they are defined only as precisely as allowed by the configuration space description or its equivalent. In every case for which a quantum kinematic description is needed, there is always a compelling reason for this restriction of kinematic precision. An example of such a reason is that for a particle to be experimentally found in a definite position, it must be held motionless; for it to be experimentally found to have a definite momentum, it must have free motion; these two are logically incompatible.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bohr | first1 = N. | authorlink = Niels Bohr | year = 1928 | title = The Quantum postulate and the recent development of atomic theory | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 121 | issue = 3050| pages = 580\u2013590 | doi=10.1038/121580a0|bibcode = 1928Natur.121..580B | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1930).

It allows completely precise description of an instantaneous state by a value in phase space, the Cartesian product of configuration and momentum spaces. This description simply assumes or imagines a state as a physically existing entity without concern about its experimental measurability. Such a description of an initial condition, together with Newton's laws of motion, allows a precise deterministic and causal prediction of a final condition, with a definite trajectory of passage. [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] dynamics can be used for this. Classical kinematics also allows the description of a process analogous to the initial and final condition description used by quantum mechanics.

However, the lack of a correct theory of [[quantum gravity]] is an important issue in [[physical cosmology]] and the search by physicists for an elegant \"[[theory of everything|Theory of Everything]]\" (TOE). Consequently, resolving the inconsistencies between both theories has been a major goal of 20th- and 21st-century physics. Many prominent physicists, including [[Stephen Hawking]], worked for many years to create a theory underlying ''everything''. This TOE would combine not only the models of subatomic physics, but also derive the four [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces of nature]] \u2013 the [[strong interaction|strong force]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[weak interaction|weak force]], and [[gravity]] \u2013 from a single force or phenomenon. However, after considering [[G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorem]], Hawking concluded that a theory of everything is not possible, and stated so publicly in his lecture \"G\u00f6del and the End of Physics\" (2002).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/strings02/dirac/hawking/|title=Stephen Hawking; G\u00f6del and the end of physics|date=|work=cam.ac.uk|accessdate=11 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521123113/http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/strings02/dirac/hawking/|archive-date=21 May 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Attempts at a unified field theory===\n{{Main|Grand unified theory}}\nThe quest to unify the [[fundamental force]]s through quantum mechanics is ongoing.

However&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2013  and while special relativity is parsimoniously incorporated into quantum electrodynamics&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2013  the expanded [[general relativity]], currently the best theory describing the gravitation force, has not been fully incorporated into quantum theory. One of those searching for a coherent TOE is [[Edward Witten]], a theoretical physicist who formulated the [[M-theory]], which is an attempt at describing the supersymmetrical based [[string theory]]. M-theory posits that our apparent [[4-dimensional spacetime]] is, in reality, actually an 11-dimensional spacetime containing 10 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension, although 7 of the spatial dimensions are \u2013 at lower energies \u2013 completely \"compactified\" (or infinitely curved) and not readily amenable to measurement or probing.\n\nAnother popular theory is [[loop quantum gravity]] (LQG) proposed by [[Carlo Rovelli]], that describes quantum properties of gravity. It is also a theory of [[quantum space]] and [[Chronon|quantum time]], because in general relativity the geometry of spacetime is a manifestation of [[gravity]]. LQG is an attempt to merge and adapt standard quantum mechanics and standard [[general relativity]]. This theory describes space as granular analogous to the granularity of photons in the quantum theory of electromagnetism and the discrete energy levels of atoms. More precisely, space is an extremely fine fabric or networks \"woven\" of finite loops called [[spin networks]]. The evolution of a spin network over time is called a spin foam. The predicted size of this structure is the [[Planck length]], which is approximately 1.616\u00d710<sup>\u221235</sup> m. According to this theory, there is no meaning to length shorter than this (cf. [[Planck scale]] energy).\n\n==Philosophical implications==\n{{Main|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\n\nSince its inception, the many [[counter-intuitive]] aspects and results of quantum mechanics have provoked strong [[philosophy|philosophical]] debates and many [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations]]. Even fundamental issues, such as [[Max Born]]'s basic [[Born rule|rules]] about [[probability amplitude]]s and [[probability distribution]]s, took decades to be appreciated by society and many leading scientists.

According to this interpretation, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a ''temporary'' feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory, but is instead a ''final'' renunciation of the classical idea of \"causality\". It also states that any well-defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement, due to the [[complementarity (physics)|conjugate]] nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations.\n\nAlbert Einstein, himself one of the founders of quantum theory, did not accept some of the more philosophical or metaphysical interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as rejection of [[determinism]] and of [[causality]]. He famously said about this, \"God does not play with dice\".<ref name=\"Harrison2000\">{{cite book|first=Edward|authorlink=Edward Robert Harrison|last=Harrison|title=Cosmology: The Science of the Universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNxeHD2cbLYC&pg=PA239|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66148-5|page=239}}</ref> He rejected the concept that the state of a physical system depends on the experimental arrangement for its measurement. He held that a state of nature occurs in its own right, regardless of whether or how it might be observed. That view is supported by the currently accepted definition of a quantum state, which does not depend on the configuration space for its representation, that is to say, manner of observation. Einstein also believed that underlying quantum mechanics must be a theory that thoroughly and directly expresses the rule against [[action at a distance]]; in other words, he insisted on the [[principle of locality]]. He considered, but rejected on theoretical grounds, a particular proposal for hidden variables to obviate the indeterminism or acausality of quantum mechanical measurement. He believed that quantum mechanics was a currently valid but not a permanently definitive theory for quantum phenomena. He thought its future replacement would require profound conceptual advances, and would not come quickly or easily. The [[Bohr-Einstein debates]] provide a vibrant critique of the Copenhagen Interpretation from an [[epistemological]] point of view. In arguing for his views, he produced a series of objections, of which the most famous has become known as the [[Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen paradox]].\n\n[[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that this [[EPR paradox]] led to [[Bell's theorem|experimentally testable differences]] between quantum mechanics and theories that rely on added hidden variables. [[Bell test experiments|Experiments]] confirmed the accuracy of quantum mechanics, thereby showing that quantum mechanics cannot be improved upon by addition of hidden variables.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-action-distance/ |title=Action at a Distance in Quantum Mechanics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref> Alain Aspect's experiments in 1982 and many later experiments definitively verified quantum entanglement. Entanglement, as demonstrated in Bell-type experiments, does not violate [[causality]], since it does not involve transfer of information.  By the early 1980s, experiments had shown that such inequalities were indeed violated in practice&nbsp;\u2013 so that there were in fact correlations of the kind suggested by quantum mechanics. At first these just seemed like isolated esoteric effects, but by the mid-1990s, they were being codified in the field of quantum information theory, and led to constructions with names like [[quantum cryptography]] and [[quantum teleportation]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1058 1058]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1058}}</ref> [[Quantum cryptography]] is proposed for use in high-security applications in banking and government.\n\nThe [[Everett many-worlds interpretation]], formulated in 1956, holds that ''all'' the possibilities described by quantum theory ''simultaneously'' occur in a [[multiverse]] composed of mostly independent parallel universes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-everett/ |title=Everett's Relative-State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref> This is not accomplished by introducing a \"new axiom\" to quantum mechanics, but by ''removing'' the axiom of the collapse of the wave packet.

Such a superposition of consistent state combinations of different systems is called an [[Quantum entanglement|entangled state]]. While the multiverse is deterministic, we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by probabilities, because we can only observe the universe (i.e., the consistent state contribution to the aforementioned superposition) that we, as observers, inhabit. Everett's interpretation is perfectly consistent with [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]]'s experiments and makes them intuitively understandable. However, according to the theory of [[quantum decoherence]], these \"parallel universes\" will never be accessible to us. The inaccessibility can be understood as follows: once a measurement is done, the measured system becomes [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] with ''both'' the physicist who measured it ''and'' a huge number of other particles, some of which are [[photon]]s flying away at the [[speed of light]] towards the other end of the universe. In order to prove that the wave function did not collapse, one would have to bring ''all'' these particles back and measure them again, together with the system that was originally measured. Not only is this completely impractical, but even if one ''could'' theoretically do this, it would have to destroy any evidence that the original measurement took place (including the physicist's memory).\n\nIn light of the [[Bell test]]s, Cramer in 1986 formulated his [[transactional interpretation]]<ref name=\"Cramer\">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.58.647|title = The transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics|journal = Reviews of Modern Physics|volume = 58|issue = 3|pages = 647\u2013687|year = 1986|last1 = Cramer|first1 = John G.|bibcode = 1986RvMP...58..647C}}</ref> which is unique in providing a physical explanation for the [[Born rule]].<ref>The Transactional Interpretation of quantum mechanics.

The study of [[semiconductor]]s led to the invention of the [[diode]] and the [[transistor]], which are indispensable parts of modern [[electronics]] systems, [[computer]] and [[telecommunication]] devices. Another application is for making laser diode and [[light emitting diode]] which are a high-efficiency source of light.\n\n[[File:Rtd seq v3.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|A working mechanism of a [[resonant tunneling diode]] device, based on the phenomenon of [[quantum tunneling]] through [[potential barrier]]s. (Left: [[band diagram]]; Center: [[transmission coefficient]]; Right: current-voltage characteristics) As shown in the band diagram(left), although there are two barriers, electrons still tunnel through via the confined states between two barriers(center), conducting current.]]\n\nMany electronic devices operate under effect of [[quantum tunneling]]. It even exists in the simple [[light switch]]. The switch would not work if electrons could not quantum tunnel through the layer of oxidation on the metal contact surfaces. [[Flash memory]] chips found in [[USB flash drive|USB drives]] use quantum tunneling to erase their memory cells. Some negative differential resistance devices also utilize quantum tunneling effect, such as [[resonant tunneling diode]]. Unlike classical diodes, its current is carried by [[resonant tunneling]] through two or more [[potential barrier]]s (see right figure). Its negative resistance behavior can only be understood with quantum mechanics: As the confined state moves close to [[Fermi level]], tunnel current increases. As it moves away, current decreases. Quantum  mechanics is necessary to understanding and designing such electronic devices.\n\n===Cryptography===\nResearchers are currently seeking robust methods of directly manipulating quantum states. Efforts are being made to more fully develop [[quantum cryptography]], which will theoretically allow guaranteed secure transmission of information.\n\nAn inherent advantage yielded by quantum cryptography when compared to classical [[cryptography]] is the detection of passive [[eavesdropping]]. This is a natural result of the behavior of quantum bits; due to the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]], if a bit in a superposition state were to be observed, the superposition state would collapse into an [[eigenstate]]. Because the intended recipient was expecting to receive the bit in a superposition state, the intended recipient would know there was an attack, because the bit's state would no longer be in a superposition.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schneier|first1=Bruce|author-link=Bruce Schneier|title=Applied Cryptography|date=1993|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0471117094|page=554|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n===Quantum computing===\nAnother goal is the development of [[quantum computer]]s, which are expected to perform certain computational tasks exponentially faster than classical [[computer]]s. Instead of using classical bits, quantum computers use [[qubits]], which can be in [[quantum superposition|superpositions]] of states. Quantum programmers are able to  manipulate the superposition of qubits in order to solve problems that classical computing cannot do effectively, such as searching unsorted databases or [[integer factorization]]. [[IBM]] claims that the advent of quantum computing may progress the fields of medicine, logistics, financial services, [[artificial intelligence]] and cloud security.<ref>{{cite web|title=Applications of Quantum Computing|url=https://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q/learn/quantum-computing-applications/|website=research.ibm.com|accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nAnother active research topic is [[quantum teleportation]], which deals with techniques to transmit quantum information over arbitrary distances.\n\n===Macroscale quantum effects===\nWhile quantum mechanics primarily applies to the smaller atomic regimes of matter and energy, some systems exhibit [[Mechanics#Classical versus quantum|quantum mechanical effects]] on a large scale. [[Superfluidity]], the frictionless flow of a liquid at temperatures near [[absolute zero]], is one well-known example. So is the closely related phenomenon of [[superconductivity]], the frictionless flow of an electron gas in a conducting material (an [[electric current]]) at sufficiently low temperatures. The [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] is a [[topological order]]ed state which corresponds to patterns of long-range [[quantum entanglement]].<ref name=chen>{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = Xie | authorlink3 = Xiao-Gang Wen | last2 = Gu | first2 = Zheng-Cheng | last3 = Wen | first3 = Xiao-Gang | year = 2010 | title = Local unitary transformation, long-range quantum entanglement, wave function renormalization, and topological order | journal = Phys.

It has also given insight into the workings of many different [[biological systems]], including [[smell receptors]] and [[protein structure]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Mark |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2009/feb/13-is-quantum-mechanics-controlling-your-thoughts/article_view?b_start:int=1&-C |title=Is Quantum Mechanics Controlling Your Thoughts? &#124; Subatomic Particles |publisher=Discover Magazine |date=2009-01-13 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref> Recent work on [[photosynthesis]] has provided evidence that quantum correlations play an essential role in this fundamental process of plants and many other organisms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/41632 |title=Quantum mechanics boosts photosynthesis |publisher=physicsworld.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-23}}</ref> Even so, [[classical physics]] can often provide good approximations to results otherwise obtained by quantum physics, typically in circumstances with large numbers of particles or large [[quantum number]]s. Since classical formulas are much simpler and easier to compute than quantum formulas, classical approximations are used and preferred when the system is large enough to render the effects of quantum mechanics insignificant.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Free particle===\nFor example, consider a [[free particle]]. In quantum mechanics, a free matter is described by a wave function.  The particle properties of the matter become apparent when we measure its position and velocity.  The wave properties of the matter become apparent when we measure its wave properties like interference.  The [[wave\u2013particle duality]] feature is incorporated in the relations of coordinates and operators in the formulation of quantum mechanics.  Since the matter is free (not subject to any interactions), its quantum state can be represented as a [[wave]] of arbitrary shape and extending over space as a [[wave function]]. The position and momentum of the particle are [[observables]]. The [[Uncertainty Principle]] states that both the position and the momentum cannot simultaneously be measured with complete precision. However, one ''can'' measure the position (alone) of a moving free particle, creating an eigenstate of position with a wave function that is very large (a [[Dirac delta]]) at a particular position ''x'', and zero everywhere else. If one performs a position measurement on such a wave function, the resultant ''x'' will be obtained with 100% probability (i.e., with full certainty, or complete precision). This is called an eigenstate of position&nbsp;\u2013 or, stated in mathematical terms, a ''generalized position eigenstate ([[Distribution (mathematics)|eigendistribution]])''. If the particle is in an eigenstate of position, then its momentum is completely unknown. On the other hand, if the particle is in an eigenstate of momentum, then its position is completely unknown.<ref>{{Cite book\n|title=Quantum Mechanics, Second edition\n|first1=P.C.W.\n|last1=Davies\n|first2=David S.\n|last2=Betts\n|publisher=Chapman and Hall\n|year=1984\n|isbn=978-0-7487-4446-6\n|page=\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XRyHCrGNstoC&pg=PA79}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XRyHCrGNstoC&pg=PA79 Chapter 6, p. 79\n</ref>\nIn an eigenstate of momentum having a [[plane wave]] form, it can be shown that the [[wavelength]] is equal to ''h/p'', where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] and ''p'' is the momentum of the [[eigenstate]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKm-Ekwke_UC |title=The Future of Complexity: Conceiving a Better Way to Understand Order and Chaos|first= Peter|last= Baofu|date= 2007|accessdate=2012-08-18|isbn=9789812708991|bibcode=2007fccb.book.....B}}</ref>\n\n===Particle in a box===\n[[File:Infinite potential well.svg|thumb|1-dimensional potential energy box (or infinite potential well)]]\n{{Main|Particle in a box}}\nThe particle in a one-dimensional potential energy box is the most mathematically simple example where restraints lead to the quantization of energy levels.

Instead, the wave function must satisfy more complicated mathematical boundary conditions as it is nonzero in regions outside the well.\n\n===Rectangular potential barrier===\n{{Main|Rectangular potential barrier}}\nThis is a model for the [[quantum tunneling]] effect which plays an important role in the performance of modern technologies such as [[flash memory]] and [[scanning tunneling microscope|scanning tunneling microscopy]].

Some of the trajectories (such as C, D, E, and F) are [[standing wave]]s (or \"[[stationary state]]s\"). Each standing-wave frequency is proportional to a possible [[energy level]] of the oscillator.

Formally, these vectors are elements of a [[complex number|complex]] [[Separable space|separable]] [[Hilbert space]]&nbsp;\u2013 variously called the [[State space (physics)|''state space'']] or the ''associated Hilbert space'' of the system&nbsp;\u2013 that is well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the phase factor). In other words, the possible states are points in the [[projective space]] of a Hilbert space, usually called the [[complex projective space]]. The exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on the system&nbsp;\u2013 for example, the state space for position and momentum states is the space of [[square-integrable]] functions, while the state space for the spin of a single proton is just the product of two complex planes. Each observable is represented by a maximally [[Hermitian adjoint|Hermitian]] (precisely: by a [[self-adjoint operator|self-adjoint]]) linear [[Operator (physics)|operator]] acting on the state space. Each [[eigenstate]] of an observable corresponds to an [[eigenvector]] of the operator, and the associated [[eigenvalue]] corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate. If the operator's spectrum is discrete, the observable can attain only those discrete eigenvalues.\n\nIn the formalism of quantum mechanics, the state of a system at a given time is described by a [[complex number|complex]] [[wave function]], also referred to as state vector in a complex [[vector space]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Quantum Mechanics Symmetries, Second edition|first1=Walter|last1=Greiner|first2=Berndt|last2=M\u00fcller|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|isbn=978-3-540-58080-5|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gCfvWx6vuzUC&pg=PA52}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gCfvWx6vuzUC&pg=PA52 Chapter 1, p. 52]</ref> This abstract mathematical object allows for the calculation of [[probability|probabilities]] of outcomes of concrete experiments. For example, it allows one to compute the probability of finding an electron in a particular region around the nucleus at a particular time. Contrary to classical mechanics, one can never make simultaneous predictions of [[conjugate variables]], such as position and momentum, to arbitrary precision. For instance, electrons may be considered (to a certain probability) to be located somewhere within a given region of space, but with their exact positions unknown. Contours of constant probability density, often referred to as \"clouds\", may be drawn around the nucleus of an atom to conceptualize where the electron might be located with the most probability. Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]] quantifies the inability to precisely locate the particle given its conjugate momentum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/history/heisenberg/p08a.htm |title=Heisenberg \u2013 Quantum Mechanics, 1925\u20131927: The Uncertainty Relations |publisher=Aip.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref>\n\nAccording to one interpretation, as the result of a measurement, the wave function containing the probability information for a system [[Collapse of the wavefunction|collapses]] from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator representing the observable&nbsp;\u2013 which explains the choice of ''Hermitian'' operators, for which all the eigenvalues are real. The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the [[spectral theorem|spectral decomposition]] of the corresponding operator. Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]] is represented by the statement that the operators corresponding to certain observables do not [[Commutator|commute]].\n\nThe [[probability|probabilistic]] nature of quantum mechanics thus stems from the act of measurement. This is one of the most difficult aspects of quantum systems to understand. It was the central topic in the famous [[Bohr\u2013Einstein debates]], in which the two scientists attempted to clarify these fundamental principles by way of [[thought experiment]]s. In the decades after the formulation of quantum mechanics, the question of what constitutes a \"measurement\" has been extensively studied. Newer [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations of quantum mechanics]] have been formulated that do away with the concept of \"[[Collapse of the wavefunction|wave function collapse]]\" (see, for example, the [[relative state interpretation]]). The basic idea is that when a quantum system interacts with a measuring apparatus, their respective wave functions become [[Quantum Entanglement|entangled]], so that the original quantum system ceases to exist as an independent entity. For details, see the article on [[measurement in quantum mechanics]].<ref name=\"google215\">{{cite book|title=The Quantum Challenge: Modern Research on the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, Second edition|first1=George|last1=Greenstein|first2=Arthur|last2=Zajonc|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers, Inc|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7637-2470-2|page=215|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5t0tm0FB1CsC&pg=PA215}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5t0tm0FB1CsC&pg=PA215 Chapter 8, p. 215]\n</ref>\n\nGenerally, quantum mechanics does not assign definite values. Instead, it makes a prediction using a [[probability distribution]]; that is, it describes the probability of obtaining the possible outcomes from measuring an observable. Often these results are skewed by many causes, such as dense probability clouds. Probability clouds are approximate (but better than [[Bohr model|the Bohr model]]) whereby electron location is given by a [[probability function]], the [[wave function]] [[eigenvalue]], such that the probability is the squared modulus of the [[probability amplitude|complex amplitude]], or [[quantum state]] nuclear attraction.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lodha |first1=Suresh K. |last2=Faaland |first2=Nikolai M. |last3=Charaniya |first3=Amin P. |last4=Varshney |first4=Pramod K. |last5=Mehrotra |first5=Kishan |last6=Mohan |first6=Chilukuri |display-authors=2 |title=Visualization of Uncertain Particle Movement (Proceeding Computer Graphics and Imaging) |url=ftp://classes.soe.ucsc.edu/.zfs/snapshot/2014-01-01/pub/lodha/papers/cgim2002.pdf |publisher=Actapress.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801014205/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e7a4/ae7e57164c4afd726b567f863cce94ba9f86.pdf |archivedate=2018-08-01 |date=2002 |access-date=2018-08-01 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Dark Side of the Force: Economic Foundations of Conflict Theory|first1=Jack|last1=Hirshleifer|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-521-80412-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/darksideofforcee00hirs/page/265 265]|url=https://archive.org/details/darksideofforcee00hirs|url-access=registration}}, [https://archive.org/details/darksideofforcee00hirs/page/265 Chapter, p. ]</ref> Naturally, these probabilities will depend on the quantum state at the \"instant\" of the measurement. Hence, uncertainty is involved in the value. There are, however, certain states that are associated with a definite value of a particular observable. These are known as [[eigenstate]]s of the observable (\"eigen\" can be translated from German as meaning \"inherent\" or \"characteristic\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dict.cc/german-english/eigen.html|title=dict.cc dictionary :: eigen :: German-English translation|date=|work=dict.cc|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the everyday world, it is natural and intuitive to think of everything (every observable) as being in an eigenstate. Everything appears to have a definite position, a definite momentum, a definite energy, and a definite time of occurrence. However, quantum mechanics does not pinpoint the exact values of a particle's position and momentum (since they are [[Conjugate variables|conjugate pairs]]) or its energy and time (since they too are conjugate pairs).  Rather, it provides only a range of probabilities in which that particle might be given its momentum and momentum probability. Therefore, it is helpful to use different words to describe states having ''[[Uncertainty principle|uncertain]]'' values and states having ''definite'' values (eigenstates).\n\nUsually, a system will not be in an [[eigenstate]] of the observable (particle) we are interested in. However, if one measures the observable, the wave function will instantaneously be an eigenstate (or \"generalized\" eigenstate) of that observable. This process is known as [[wave function collapse]], a controversial and much-debated process<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phy.olemiss.edu/~luca/Topics/qm/collapse.html |title=Topics: Wave-Function Collapse |publisher=Phy.olemiss.edu |date=2012-07-27 |accessdate=2012-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228044927/http://www.phy.olemiss.edu/~luca/Topics/qm/collapse.html |archive-date=2017-02-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> that involves expanding the system under study to include the measurement device. If one knows the corresponding wave function at the instant before the measurement, one will be able to compute the probability of the wave function collapsing into each of the possible eigenstates.\n\nFor example, the free particle in the previous example will usually have a wave function that is a [[wave packet]] centered around some mean position ''x''<sub>0</sub> (neither an eigenstate of position nor of momentum). When one measures the position of the particle, it is impossible to predict with certainty the result.<ref name=\"google215\"/> It is probable, but not certain, that it will be near ''x''<sub>0</sub>, where the amplitude of the wave function is large. After the measurement is performed, having obtained some result ''x'', the wave function collapses into a position eigenstate centered at ''x''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/qmech/lectures/node28.html |title=Collapse of the wave-function |publisher=Farside.ph.utexas.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref>\n\nThe time evolution of a quantum state is described by the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], in which the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] (the [[Operator (physics)|operator]] corresponding to the [[total energy]] of the system) generates the time evolution. The [[time evolution]] of wave functions is [[determinism|deterministic]] in the sense that&nbsp;\u2013 given a wave function at an ''initial'' time&nbsp;\u2013 it makes a definite prediction of what the wave function will be at any ''later'' time.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dreams Of A Final Theory: The Search for The Fundamental Laws of Nature |first1=Steven |last1=Weinberg |publisher=Random House |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4070-6396-6 |page=82 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLrZkgPsZR0C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=OLrZkgPsZR0C&pg=PT82 Extract of page 82]</ref>\n\nDuring a [[quantum measurement|measurement]], on the other hand, the change of the initial wave function into another, later wave function is not deterministic, it is unpredictable (i.e., [[random]]).

The [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] describes how wave functions change in time, playing a role similar to [[Newton's second law]] in [[classical mechanics]]. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation, applied to the aforementioned example of the free particle, predicts that the center of a wave packet will move through space at a constant velocity (like a classical particle with no forces acting on it). However, the wave packet will also spread out as time progresses, which means that the position becomes more uncertain with time. This also has the effect of turning a position eigenstate (which can be thought of as an infinitely sharp wave packet) into a broadened wave packet that no longer represents a (definite, certain) position eigenstate.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Textbook of Quantum Mechanics|first1=Piravonu Mathews|last1=Mathews|first2=K.|last2=Venkatesan|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=978-0-07-096510-2|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qzs1DD3TcsC&pg=PA36}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_qzs1DD3TcsC&pg=PA36 Chapter 2, p. 36]</ref>\n\n[[File:Atomic-orbital-clouds spd m0.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Fig. 1: [[Probability density function|Probability densities]] corresponding to the wave functions of an electron in a hydrogen atom possessing definite energy levels (increasing from the top of the image to the bottom: ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ...) and angular momenta (increasing across from left to right: ''s'', ''p'', ''d'', ...). Denser areas correspond to higher probability density in a position measurement. Such wave functions are directly comparable to [[Chladni's figures]] of [[acoustics|acoustic]] modes of vibration in [[classical physics]] and are modes of oscillation as well, possessing a sharp [[energy]] and thus, a definite [[frequency]].

Many systems that are treated dynamically in classical mechanics are described by such \"static\" wave functions. For example, a single [[electron]] in an unexcited [[atom]] is pictured classically as a particle moving in a circular trajectory around the [[atomic nucleus]], whereas in quantum mechanics, it is described by a static, [[spherical coordinate system|spherically symmetric]] wave function surrounding the nucleus ([[:File:Atomic-orbital-clouds spd m0.png|Fig. 1]]) (however, only the lowest angular momentum states, labeled ''s'', are spherically symmetric.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physics.ukzn.ac.za/~petruccione/Phys120/Wave%20Functions%20and%20the%20Schr%F6dinger%20Equation.pdf |title=Wave Functions and the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation acts on the ''entire'' probability amplitude, not merely its absolute value. Whereas the absolute value of the probability amplitude encodes information about probabilities, its [[phase (waves)|phase]] encodes information about the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] between quantum states. This gives rise to the \"wave-like\" behavior of quantum states.\n\nAnalytic solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation are known for [[List of quantum-mechanical systems with analytical solutions|very few relatively simple model Hamiltonians]] including the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]], the [[particle in a box]], the [[dihydrogen cation]], and the [[hydrogen atom]]. Even the [[helium]] atom&nbsp;\u2013 which contains just two electrons&nbsp;\u2013 has defied all attempts at a fully analytic treatment.\n\nHowever, there are techniques for finding approximate solutions. One method, called [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]], uses the analytic result for a simple quantum mechanical model to create a result for a related but more complicated model by (for example) the addition of a weak [[potential energy]]. Another method is called \"semi-classical equation of motion\", which applies to systems for which quantum mechanics produces only small deviations from classical behavior. These deviations can then be computed based on the classical motion. This approach is particularly important in the field of [[quantum chaos]].\n\n==Mathematically equivalent formulations==\nThere are many mathematically equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics. One of the oldest and most common is the \"[[transformation theory (quantum mechanics)|transformation theory]]\" proposed by [[Paul Dirac]], which unifies and generalizes the two earliest formulations of quantum mechanics&nbsp;\u2013 [[matrix mechanics]] (invented by [[Werner Heisenberg]]) and [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]] (invented by [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]]).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.actaphys.uj.edu.pl/fulltext?series=Reg&vol=19&page=683\n |title= Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and the creation of wave mechanics |journal= [[Acta Physica Polonica B]] |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages= 683\u2013695\n |format=PDF\n |last= Rechenberg |first= Helmut |year= 1987 |accessdate=13 June 2016 }}</ref>\n\nEspecially since Heisenberg was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1932 for the creation of quantum mechanics, the role of [[Max Born]] in the development of QM was overlooked until the 1954 Nobel award. The role is noted in a 2005 biography of Born, which recounts his role in the matrix formulation and the use of probability amplitudes. Heisenberg acknowledges having learned matrices from Born, as published in a 1940 ''[[festschrift]]'' honoring [[Max Planck]].<ref>Nancy Thorndike Greenspan, \"The End of the Certain World: The Life and Science of Max Born\" (Basic Books, 2005), pp. 124\u2013128, 285\u2013826.</ref>  In the matrix formulation, the instantaneous state of a quantum system encodes the probabilities of its measurable properties, or \"[[observable]]s\". Examples of observables include [[energy operator|energy]], [[position operator|position]], [[momentum operator|momentum]], and [[angular momentum operator|angular momentum]].

This is the quantum-mechanical counterpart of the [[action principle]] in classical mechanics.\n\n==Relation to other scientific theories==\nThe rules of quantum mechanics are fundamental. They assert that the state space of a system is a [[Hilbert space]] (crucially, that the space has an [[inner product]]) and that observables of the system are [[Hermitian operators]] acting on vectors in that space&nbsp;\u2013 although they do not tell us which Hilbert space or which operators. These can be chosen appropriately in order to obtain a quantitative description of a quantum system. An important guide for making these choices is the [[correspondence principle]], which states that the predictions of quantum mechanics reduce to those of classical mechanics when a system moves to higher energies or, equivalently, larger quantum numbers, i.e. whereas a single particle exhibits a degree of randomness, in systems incorporating millions of particles averaging takes over and, at the high energy limit, the statistical probability of random behaviour approaches zero. In other words, classical mechanics is simply a quantum mechanics of large systems. This \"high energy\" limit is known as the ''classical'' or ''correspondence limit''. One can even start from an established classical model of a particular system, then try to guess the underlying quantum model that would give rise to the classical model in the correspondence limit.\n\n{{unsolved|physics|In the [[correspondence limit]] of '''quantum mechanics''': Is there a preferred interpretation of quantum mechanics? How does the quantum description of reality, which includes elements such as the \"[[superposition principle|superposition]] of states\" and \"[[wave function collapse]]\", give rise to the reality we perceive?}}\nWhen quantum mechanics was originally formulated, it was applied to models whose correspondence limit was [[theory of relativity|non-relativistic]] [[classical mechanics]]. For instance, the well-known model of the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] uses an explicitly non-relativistic expression for the [[kinetic energy]] of the oscillator, and is thus a quantum version of the [[harmonic oscillator|classical harmonic oscillator]].\n\nEarly attempts to merge quantum mechanics with [[special relativity]] involved the replacement of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a covariant equation such as the [[Klein\u2013Gordon equation]] or the [[Dirac equation]]. While these theories were successful in explaining many experimental results, they had certain unsatisfactory qualities stemming from their neglect of the relativistic creation and annihilation of particles. A fully relativistic quantum theory required the development of [[quantum field theory]], which applies quantization to a field (rather than a fixed set of particles). The first complete quantum field theory, [[quantum electrodynamics]], provides a fully quantum description of the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]]. The full apparatus of quantum field theory is often unnecessary for describing electrodynamic systems. A simpler approach, one that has been used since the inception of quantum mechanics, is to treat [[electric charge|charged]] particles as quantum mechanical objects being acted on by a classical [[electromagnetic field]]. For example, the elementary quantum model of the [[hydrogen atom]] describes the [[electric field]] of the hydrogen atom using a classical <math>\\textstyle -e^2/(4 \\pi\\epsilon_{_0}r)</math> [[Electric potential|Coulomb potential]]. This \"semi-classical\" approach fails if quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field play an important role, such as in the emission of [[photon]]s by [[charged particle]]s.\n\n[[Field (physics)|Quantum field]] theories for the [[strong nuclear force]] and the [[weak nuclear force]] have also been developed. The quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force is called [[quantum chromodynamics]], and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s. The weak nuclear force and the [[electromagnetic force]] were unified, in their quantized forms, into a single quantum field theory (known as [[electroweak theory]]), by the physicists [[Abdus Salam]], [[Sheldon Glashow]] and [[Steven Weinberg]].

In some cases it appears that there are potentially several spatially distinct pathways or trajectories by which a particle might pass from initial to final condition. It is an important feature of the quantum kinematic description that it does not permit a unique definite statement of which of those pathways is actually followed. Only the initial and final conditions are definite, and, as stated in the foregoing paragraph, they are defined only as precisely as allowed by the configuration space description or its equivalent. In every case for which a quantum kinematic description is needed, there is always a compelling reason for this restriction of kinematic precision. An example of such a reason is that for a particle to be experimentally found in a definite position, it must be held motionless; for it to be experimentally found to have a definite momentum, it must have free motion; these two are logically incompatible.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bohr | first1 = N. | authorlink = Niels Bohr | year = 1928 | title = The Quantum postulate and the recent development of atomic theory | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 121 | issue = 3050| pages = 580\u2013590 | doi=10.1038/121580a0|bibcode = 1928Natur.121..580B | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1930).

It allows completely precise description of an instantaneous state by a value in phase space, the Cartesian product of configuration and momentum spaces. This description simply assumes or imagines a state as a physically existing entity without concern about its experimental measurability. Such a description of an initial condition, together with Newton's laws of motion, allows a precise deterministic and causal prediction of a final condition, with a definite trajectory of passage. [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] dynamics can be used for this. Classical kinematics also allows the description of a process analogous to the initial and final condition description used by quantum mechanics.

However, the lack of a correct theory of [[quantum gravity]] is an important issue in [[physical cosmology]] and the search by physicists for an elegant \"[[theory of everything|Theory of Everything]]\" (TOE). Consequently, resolving the inconsistencies between both theories has been a major goal of 20th- and 21st-century physics. Many prominent physicists, including [[Stephen Hawking]], worked for many years to create a theory underlying ''everything''. This TOE would combine not only the models of subatomic physics, but also derive the four [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces of nature]] \u2013 the [[strong interaction|strong force]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[weak interaction|weak force]], and [[gravity]] \u2013 from a single force or phenomenon. However, after considering [[G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorem]], Hawking concluded that a theory of everything is not possible, and stated so publicly in his lecture \"G\u00f6del and the End of Physics\" (2002).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/strings02/dirac/hawking/|title=Stephen Hawking; G\u00f6del and the end of physics|date=|work=cam.ac.uk|accessdate=11 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521123113/http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/strings02/dirac/hawking/|archive-date=21 May 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Attempts at a unified field theory===\n{{Main|Grand unified theory}}\nThe quest to unify the [[fundamental force]]s through quantum mechanics is ongoing.

However&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2013  and while special relativity is parsimoniously incorporated into quantum electrodynamics&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2013  the expanded [[general relativity]], currently the best theory describing the gravitation force, has not been fully incorporated into quantum theory. One of those searching for a coherent TOE is [[Edward Witten]], a theoretical physicist who formulated the [[M-theory]], which is an attempt at describing the supersymmetrical based [[string theory]]. M-theory posits that our apparent [[4-dimensional spacetime]] is, in reality, actually an 11-dimensional spacetime containing 10 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension, although 7 of the spatial dimensions are \u2013 at lower energies \u2013 completely \"compactified\" (or infinitely curved) and not readily amenable to measurement or probing.\n\nAnother popular theory is [[loop quantum gravity]] (LQG) proposed by [[Carlo Rovelli]], that describes quantum properties of gravity. It is also a theory of [[quantum space]] and [[Chronon|quantum time]], because in general relativity the geometry of spacetime is a manifestation of [[gravity]]. LQG is an attempt to merge and adapt standard quantum mechanics and standard [[general relativity]]. This theory describes space as granular analogous to the granularity of photons in the quantum theory of electromagnetism and the discrete energy levels of atoms. More precisely, space is an extremely fine fabric or networks \"woven\" of finite loops called [[spin networks]]. The evolution of a spin network over time is called a spin foam. The predicted size of this structure is the [[Planck length]], which is approximately 1.616\u00d710<sup>\u221235</sup> m. According to this theory, there is no meaning to length shorter than this (cf. [[Planck scale]] energy).\n\n==Philosophical implications==\n{{Main|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\n\nSince its inception, the many [[counter-intuitive]] aspects and results of quantum mechanics have provoked strong [[philosophy|philosophical]] debates and many [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations]]. Even fundamental issues, such as [[Max Born]]'s basic [[Born rule|rules]] about [[probability amplitude]]s and [[probability distribution]]s, took decades to be appreciated by society and many leading scientists. [[Richard Feynman]] once said, \"I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.\"<ref>The Character of Physical Law (1965) Ch. 6; also quoted in The New Quantum Universe (2003), by Tony Hey and Patrick Walters</ref>  According to [[Steven Weinberg]], \"There is now in my opinion no entirely satisfactory interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1109.6462|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.85.062116|title = Collapse of the state vector|journal = Physical Review A|volume = 85|issue = 6|pages = 062116|year = 2012|last1 = Weinberg|first1 = Steven|bibcode = 2012PhRvA..85f2116W}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Copenhagen interpretation]]&nbsp;\u2013 due largely to Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg&nbsp;\u2013 remains most widely accepted some 75 years after its enunciation. According to this interpretation, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a ''temporary'' feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory, but is instead a ''final'' renunciation of the classical idea of \"causality\". It also states that any well-defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement, due to the [[complementarity (physics)|conjugate]] nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations.\n\nAlbert Einstein, himself one of the founders of quantum theory, did not accept some of the more philosophical or metaphysical interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as rejection of [[determinism]] and of [[causality]]. He famously said about this, \"God does not play with dice\".<ref name=\"Harrison2000\">{{cite book|first=Edward|authorlink=Edward Robert Harrison|last=Harrison|title=Cosmology: The Science of the Universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNxeHD2cbLYC&pg=PA239|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66148-5|page=239}}</ref> He rejected the concept that the state of a physical system depends on the experimental arrangement for its measurement. He held that a state of nature occurs in its own right, regardless of whether or how it might be observed. That view is supported by the currently accepted definition of a quantum state, which does not depend on the configuration space for its representation, that is to say, manner of observation. Einstein also believed that underlying quantum mechanics must be a theory that thoroughly and directly expresses the rule against [[action at a distance]]; in other words, he insisted on the [[principle of locality]]. He considered, but rejected on theoretical grounds, a particular proposal for hidden variables to obviate the indeterminism or acausality of quantum mechanical measurement. He believed that quantum mechanics was a currently valid but not a permanently definitive theory for quantum phenomena. He thought its future replacement would require profound conceptual advances, and would not come quickly or easily. The [[Bohr-Einstein debates]] provide a vibrant critique of the Copenhagen Interpretation from an [[epistemological]] point of view. In arguing for his views, he produced a series of objections, of which the most famous has become known as the [[Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen paradox]].\n\n[[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that this [[EPR paradox]] led to [[Bell's theorem|experimentally testable differences]] between quantum mechanics and theories that rely on added hidden variables. [[Bell test experiments|Experiments]] confirmed the accuracy of quantum mechanics, thereby showing that quantum mechanics cannot be improved upon by addition of hidden variables.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-action-distance/ |title=Action at a Distance in Quantum Mechanics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref> Alain Aspect's experiments in 1982 and many later experiments definitively verified quantum entanglement. Entanglement, as demonstrated in Bell-type experiments, does not violate [[causality]], since it does not involve transfer of information.  By the early 1980s, experiments had shown that such inequalities were indeed violated in practice&nbsp;\u2013 so that there were in fact correlations of the kind suggested by quantum mechanics. At first these just seemed like isolated esoteric effects, but by the mid-1990s, they were being codified in the field of quantum information theory, and led to constructions with names like [[quantum cryptography]] and [[quantum teleportation]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1058 1058]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1058}}</ref> [[Quantum cryptography]] is proposed for use in high-security applications in banking and government.\n\nThe [[Everett many-worlds interpretation]], formulated in 1956, holds that ''all'' the possibilities described by quantum theory ''simultaneously'' occur in a [[multiverse]] composed of mostly independent parallel universes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-everett/ |title=Everett's Relative-State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref> This is not accomplished by introducing a \"new axiom\" to quantum mechanics, but by ''removing'' the axiom of the collapse of the wave packet.

Such a superposition of consistent state combinations of different systems is called an [[Quantum entanglement|entangled state]]. While the multiverse is deterministic, we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by probabilities, because we can only observe the universe (i.e., the consistent state contribution to the aforementioned superposition) that we, as observers, inhabit. Everett's interpretation is perfectly consistent with [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]]'s experiments and makes them intuitively understandable. However, according to the theory of [[quantum decoherence]], these \"parallel universes\" will never be accessible to us. The inaccessibility can be understood as follows: once a measurement is done, the measured system becomes [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] with ''both'' the physicist who measured it ''and'' a huge number of other particles, some of which are [[photon]]s flying away at the [[speed of light]] towards the other end of the universe. In order to prove that the wave function did not collapse, one would have to bring ''all'' these particles back and measure them again, together with the system that was originally measured. Not only is this completely impractical, but even if one ''could'' theoretically do this, it would have to destroy any evidence that the original measurement took place (including the physicist's memory).\n\nIn light of the [[Bell test]]s, Cramer in 1986 formulated his [[transactional interpretation]]<ref name=\"Cramer\">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.58.647|title = The transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics|journal = Reviews of Modern Physics|volume = 58|issue = 3|pages = 647\u2013687|year = 1986|last1 = Cramer|first1 = John G.|bibcode = 1986RvMP...58..647C}}</ref> which is unique in providing a physical explanation for the [[Born rule]].<ref>The Transactional Interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Examples include the [[laser]], the [[transistor]] (and thus the [[Integrated circuit|microchip]]), the [[electron microscope]], and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI). The study of [[semiconductor]]s led to the invention of the [[diode]] and the [[transistor]], which are indispensable parts of modern [[electronics]] systems, [[computer]] and [[telecommunication]] devices.

It even exists in the simple [[light switch]]. The switch would not work if electrons could not quantum tunnel through the layer of oxidation on the metal contact surfaces. [[Flash memory]] chips found in [[USB flash drive|USB drives]] use quantum tunneling to erase their memory cells. Some negative differential resistance devices also utilize quantum tunneling effect, such as [[resonant tunneling diode]]. Unlike classical diodes, its current is carried by [[resonant tunneling]] through two or more [[potential barrier]]s (see right figure). Its negative resistance behavior can only be understood with quantum mechanics: As the confined state moves close to [[Fermi level]], tunnel current increases. As it moves away, current decreases. Quantum  mechanics is necessary to understanding and designing such electronic devices.\n\n===Cryptography===\nResearchers are currently seeking robust methods of directly manipulating quantum states. Efforts are being made to more fully develop [[quantum cryptography]], which will theoretically allow guaranteed secure transmission of information.\n\nAn inherent advantage yielded by quantum cryptography when compared to classical [[cryptography]] is the detection of passive [[eavesdropping]]. This is a natural result of the behavior of quantum bits; due to the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]], if a bit in a superposition state were to be observed, the superposition state would collapse into an [[eigenstate]]. Because the intended recipient was expecting to receive the bit in a superposition state, the intended recipient would know there was an attack, because the bit's state would no longer be in a superposition.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schneier|first1=Bruce|author-link=Bruce Schneier|title=Applied Cryptography|date=1993|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0471117094|page=554|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n===Quantum computing===\nAnother goal is the development of [[quantum computer]]s, which are expected to perform certain computational tasks exponentially faster than classical [[computer]]s. Instead of using classical bits, quantum computers use [[qubits]], which can be in [[quantum superposition|superpositions]] of states. Quantum programmers are able to  manipulate the superposition of qubits in order to solve problems that classical computing cannot do effectively, such as searching unsorted databases or [[integer factorization]]. [[IBM]] claims that the advent of quantum computing may progress the fields of medicine, logistics, financial services, [[artificial intelligence]] and cloud security.<ref>{{cite web|title=Applications of Quantum Computing|url=https://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q/learn/quantum-computing-applications/|website=research.ibm.com|accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nAnother active research topic is [[quantum teleportation]], which deals with techniques to transmit quantum information over arbitrary distances.\n\n===Macroscale quantum effects===\nWhile quantum mechanics primarily applies to the smaller atomic regimes of matter and energy, some systems exhibit [[Mechanics#Classical versus quantum|quantum mechanical effects]] on a large scale. [[Superfluidity]], the frictionless flow of a liquid at temperatures near [[absolute zero]], is one well-known example. So is the closely related phenomenon of [[superconductivity]], the frictionless flow of an electron gas in a conducting material (an [[electric current]]) at sufficiently low temperatures.

Since classical formulas are much simpler and easier to compute than quantum formulas, classical approximations are used and preferred when the system is large enough to render the effects of quantum mechanics insignificant.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Free particle===\nFor example, consider a [[free particle]]. In quantum mechanics, a free matter is described by a wave function.  The particle properties of the matter become apparent when we measure its position and velocity.  The wave properties of the matter become apparent when we measure its wave properties like interference.  The [[wave\u2013particle duality]] feature is incorporated in the relations of coordinates and operators in the formulation of quantum mechanics.  Since the matter is free (not subject to any interactions), its quantum state can be represented as a [[wave]] of arbitrary shape and extending over space as a [[wave function]]. The position and momentum of the particle are [[observables]]. The [[Uncertainty Principle]] states that both the position and the momentum cannot simultaneously be measured with complete precision. However, one ''can'' measure the position (alone) of a moving free particle, creating an eigenstate of position with a wave function that is very large (a [[Dirac delta]]) at a particular position ''x'', and zero everywhere else. If one performs a position measurement on such a wave function, the resultant ''x'' will be obtained with 100% probability (i.e., with full certainty, or complete precision). This is called an eigenstate of position&nbsp;\u2013 or, stated in mathematical terms, a ''generalized position eigenstate ([[Distribution (mathematics)|eigendistribution]])''. If the particle is in an eigenstate of position, then its momentum is completely unknown. On the other hand, if the particle is in an eigenstate of momentum, then its position is completely unknown.<ref>{{Cite book\n|title=Quantum Mechanics, Second edition\n|first1=P.C.W.\n|last1=Davies\n|first2=David S.\n|last2=Betts\n|publisher=Chapman and Hall\n|year=1984\n|isbn=978-0-7487-4446-6\n|page=\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XRyHCrGNstoC&pg=PA79}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XRyHCrGNstoC&pg=PA79 Chapter 6, p. 79\n</ref>\nIn an eigenstate of momentum having a [[plane wave]] form, it can be shown that the [[wavelength]] is equal to ''h/p'', where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] and ''p'' is the momentum of the [[eigenstate]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKm-Ekwke_UC |title=The Future of Complexity: Conceiving a Better Way to Understand Order and Chaos|first= Peter|last= Baofu|date= 2007|accessdate=2012-08-18|isbn=9789812708991|bibcode=2007fccb.book.....B}}</ref>\n\n===Particle in a box===\n[[File:Infinite potential well.svg|thumb|1-dimensional potential energy box (or infinite potential well)]]\n{{Main|Particle in a box}}\nThe particle in a one-dimensional potential energy box is the most mathematically simple example where restraints lead to the quantization of energy levels.

At <math>x=L</math>,\n\n:<math> \\psi(L) = 0 = C\\sin(kL),</math>\n\nin which <math>C</math> cannot be zero as this would conflict with the Born interpretation.

In quantum mechanics, the position of the ball is represented by a [[wave]] (called the [[wave function]]), with the [[real part]] shown in blue and the [[imaginary part]] shown in red. Some of the trajectories (such as C, D, E, and F) are [[standing wave]]s (or \"[[stationary state]]s\"). Each standing-wave frequency is proportional to a possible [[energy level]] of the oscillator. This \"energy quantization\" does not occur in classical physics, where the oscillator can have ''any'' energy.]]\n\nAs in the classical case, the potential for the quantum harmonic oscillator is given by\n\n:<math>V(x)=\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2x^2.</math>\n\nThis problem can either be treated by directly solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is not trivial, or by using the more elegant \"ladder method\" first proposed by Paul Dirac.
