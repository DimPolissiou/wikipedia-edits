He wasn't the first Puerto Rican to play in the MLB, however, he was arguably the most notable at the time. Roberto faced discrimination and disrespect while playing in MLB. Roberto persevered and continued to let his play shine and prove why he and many Latino players like him deserved to play among the best of the MLB. Recognized as \"The Great One\" , he often made his frustrations known about being overlooked by the media during his career. In Puerto Rico, Roberto was nothing less than a monumental superstar. He was considered a national hero and was idolized by all of the young players watching him. As rich and famous Roberto got, he never stopped helping others. He always helped the underprivileged as much as he could.\nMany stars have emerged from the ball fields of Puerto Rico since baseball arrived on the island in the late 1800s. There were Hall of Famers Orlando Cepeda, Pudge Rodriguez, and Roberto Alomar, and stars like Javy Lopez, Juan Gonzalez, Juan Pizarro, Ruben Gomez, Bernie Williams, and Jos\u00e9 Valentin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/cauldron/2015/09/16/excerpt-bengie-molina-remembers-roberto-clemente|title=How Clemente inspired the Molina baseball family|publisher=}}</ref>\nCarlos Correa has emerged as one of Puerto Rico's best talents in baseball.

Roberto showcased some of the best talent that Puerto Rico could offer and paved the way for thousands of players to follow his lead.

He was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1973, becoming both the first Latin American and Caribbean player to be enshrined. His untimely death established the precedent that, as an alternative to the five-year retirement period, a player who has been deceased for at least six months is eligible for entry into the Hall of Fame.\n\nClemente was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] for 12 seasons, playing in 15 All-Star Games.{{efn|MLB held two All-Star Games each season from 1959 through 1962.}} He was the [[National League]] (NL) [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] in 1966, the NL [[Batting title|batting leader]] in 1961, 1964, 1965, and 1967, and a [[Gold Glove Award]] winner for 12 consecutive seasons from 1961 through 1972. His [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] was over .300 for 13 seasons and he had [[3,000 hit club|3,000 hits]] during his major league career.

Clemente is the first Latin American and Caribbean player to help win a World Series as a starting position player (1960), to receive an NL MVP Award (1966), and to receive a [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|World Series MVP Award]] (1971).\n\nClemente was involved in charity work in Latin American and Caribbean countries during the off-seasons, often delivering baseball equipment and food to those in need. On December 31, 1972, he died in a [[1972 Puerto Rico DC-7 crash|plane crash]] at the age of 38 while en route to deliver aid to earthquake victims in [[Nicaragua]]. The following season, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates#Retired numbers|Pirates retired his uniform number]] 21, and MLB renamed its annual Commissioner's Award in his honor; now known as the [[Roberto Clemente Award]], it is given to the player who \"best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, community involvement and the individual's contribution to his team\".\n\n== Early years ==\nClemente was born in Barrio San Ant\u00f3n,{{efn|Not to be confused with the better-known barrio [[San Ant\u00f3n]] in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]].}} [[Carolina, Puerto Rico]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=TEmBnZP5klwC&pg=PT8 ''Baseball Hall of Famers: Roberto Clemente.''] Robert Kingsbury.

Fellow Royals hurler Joe Black categorically denies Lasorda's characterization of Clemente as unable to \"speak one word of English\": <blockquote>''\"I saw him on the field and I said, 'Tommy, why did you tell that story?'

He wasn't the first Puerto Rican to play in the MLB, however, he was arguably the most notable at the time. Roberto faced discrimination and disrespect while playing in MLB. Roberto persevered and continued to let his play shine and prove why he and many Latino players like him deserved to play among the best of the MLB. Recognized as \"The Great One\" , he often made his frustrations known about being overlooked by the media during his career. In Puerto Rico, Roberto was nothing less than a monumental superstar. He was considered a national hero and was idolized by all of the young players watching him. As rich and famous Roberto got, he never stopped helping others. He always helped the underprivileged as much as he could.\nMany stars have emerged from the ball fields of Puerto Rico since baseball arrived on the island in the late 1800s. There were Hall of Famers Orlando Cepeda, Pudge Rodriguez, and Roberto Alomar, and stars like Javy Lopez, Juan Gonzalez, Juan Pizarro, Ruben Gomez, Bernie Williams, and Jos\u00e9 Valentin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/cauldron/2015/09/16/excerpt-bengie-molina-remembers-roberto-clemente|title=How Clemente inspired the Molina baseball family|publisher=}}</ref>\nCarlos Correa has emerged as one of Puerto Rico's best talents in baseball.

Charlotte calls Dolores about her failure and feels herself slipping away from Dolores, but Dolores reminds her to get the data they need. Serac orders the destruction of the park hosts and host data and to test all Delos employees for a Dolores host. Charlotte uses the distraction to make the host data copy Dolores needs, but further discovers William's location, and that Serac is using the host machines at Delos to make three new hosts. However, she is soon revealed by Serac as the host, and she takes all measures to make her escape.\n\nMaeve is told by Serac she will get a new host body and allies to help, and is brought into the War World simulation and meets Lee again. Finding her host module has been moved and the two additional hosts being prepared including one for Hector, she helps bring back Hector's prior memories. She, Hector, and Lee find that the damaged Dolores copy module that was in Martin is also attached to the simulation, and she tries to figure out Dolores' plans from its representation in the simulation. This Dolores recognizes that Maeve would likely be seeking allies and would have planned ahead. Maeve is too late to stop Charlotte from destroying the Hector control module. Just then, Serac's men arrive and chase Charlotte off but not after she grabs the damaged Dolores core. Maeve soon wakes up in her new host body, and waits for the third, untouched host to wake up.\n\nCharlotte races home to take her ex-husband Jake and son Nathan to safety, but Serac's men destory the car. A charred Charlotte is able to get out, but looks back in tears at the wreckage.\n\nWilliam, meanwhile, resists traditional therapy at the mental institution, so he is fitted with an implant that can access his [[limbic system]]. Through it, the doctors make him have a lucid experience of having a therapy session with his earlier selves as well as James Delos. They come to point out that there was a point in his teenage life where he chose violence and which led him down this path. William comes to a catharsis as he violently beats up his other selves, admitting he has now chosen to be the \"good guy\". He is then pulled out of the lucid state by Bernard and Ashley, as the facility appears otherwise abandoned after everyone received their Rehoboam profile.\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Science fiction|Television}}\n* {{URL|1=https://www.hbo.com/westworld/season-3/6-Decoherence|2=\"Decoherence\"}} at [[HBO.com]]\n* {{IMDb episode|10011156}}\n{{Westworld}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Genre}}\n[[Category:2020 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Westworld (TV series) episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Decoherence (''Westworld'')}}\n{{Infobox television episode\n| title          = Decoherence \n| image          = \n| caption        = \n| alt            = \n| series         = [[Westworld (TV series)|Westworld]]\n| season         = 3\n| episode        = 6\n| director       = [[Jennifer Getzinger]]\n| writer         = Suzanne Wrubel<br/>Lisa Joy\n| music          = \n| photographer   = John Grillo\n| editor         = Ali Comperchio\n| production     = 306\n| airdate        = {{Start date|2020|04|19}}\n| length         = 58 minutes\n| guests         =  * [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as Hector Escaton / Ettore\n* [[Jimmi Simpson]] as William\n* [[Peter Mullan]] as James Delos\n* [[Katja Herbers]] as Emily Grace\n* [[Michael Ealy]] as Jake\n* [[Jonathan Tucker]] as Major Craddock\n| prev           = [[Genre (Westworld)|Genre]]\n| next           = \n}}\n\n\"'''Decoherence'''\" is the sixth episode of the [[Westworld (season 3)|third season]] of the [[HBO]] [[science-fiction]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] television series ''[[Westworld (TV series)|Westworld]]''.

In 1996, he became the Mariners' starting shortstop, won the major league [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|batting championship]], and finished second in voting for the AL MVP Award.  His combination of power, speed, and defense made him a cornerstone of the franchise, but he left the team via free agency after the 2000 season to join the Rangers. The 10-year, $252&nbsp;million contract he signed was the richest in baseball history at the time.  He played at a high level in his three years with Texas, highlighted by his first AL MVP Award win in 2003, but the team failed to make the playoffs during his tenure.

His 52 homers made him the sixth youngest to ever reach 50 homers and were the highest total ever by a shortstop, surpassing [[Ernie Banks]]' record of 47 in 1958, and also the most ever for an infielder other than a 1st baseman, breaking Phillies 3B [[Mike Schmidt]]'s mark of 48 in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HR_season.shtml|title=Single-Season Leaders & Records for Home Runs|accessdate=July 20, 2007|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070620135024/http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HR_season.shtml| archivedate= June 20, 2007 | url-status=live}}</ref> It was his 5th 30-homer campaign, tying Banks for most ever by a shortstop. He also tied for the league lead in extra-base hits (87) and ranked third in RBIs (135) and slugging (.622). He was also among the AL leaders in hits (4th, 201), average (7th, .318), and on-base percentage (8th, .399). He established Rangers club records for homers, runs, total bases, and [[hit by pitch]]es, had the 2nd most extra-base hits, and the fourth-highest RBI total. He led the club in runs, hits, doubles (34), homers, RBI, slugging, and on-base percentage and was second in walks (75), stolen bases (18), and game-winning RBI (14) while posting career highs for homers, RBI, and total bases. Rodriguez started 161 games at shortstop and one as the [[Designated hitter|DH]], the only major league player to start all of his team's games in 2001.\n\nRodriguez followed the previous year with a major league-best 57 HR, 142 RBIs and 389 total bases in 2002,<ref name=\"b-r\" /> becoming the first player to lead the majors in all three categories since 1984.

He had the 6th-most home runs in AL history, the most since [[Roger Maris]]' league record 61 in 1961 and the most ever for a shortstop for the 2nd straight year.

In that series (ALCS) he equaled the single-game post-season record with five runs scored in Game 3 at Boston.\n\nOne of the most controversial plays of Rodriguez's career occurred late in Game 6 of the [[2004 American League Championship Series]]. With one out and [[Derek Jeter]] on first base in the bottom of the eighth inning, Rodriguez hit a slow roller between the pitcher's mound and the first base line. Red Sox [[pitcher]] [[Bronson Arroyo]] fielded the ball and ran towards Rodriguez to apply a tag. As Arroyo reached towards him, Rodriguez swatted at his glove, knocking the ball loose. As the ball rolled away, Jeter scored all the way from first as Rodriguez took second on the play, which was initially ruled an error on Arroyo.

In 1996, he became the Mariners' starting shortstop, won the major league [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|batting championship]], and finished second in voting for the AL MVP Award.  His combination of power, speed, and defense made him a cornerstone of the franchise, but he left the team via free agency after the 2000 season to join the Rangers. The 10-year, $252&nbsp;million contract he signed was the richest in baseball history at the time.  He played at a high level in his three years with Texas, highlighted by his first AL MVP Award win in 2003, but the team failed to make the playoffs during his tenure. Prior to the 2004 season, Rodriguez was traded to the Yankees, for whom he converted to a third baseman, because [[Derek Jeter]] was already the Yankees' full-time shortstop. During Rodriguez's career with the Yankees, he was named AL MVP in 2005 and 2007. After opting out of his contract following the 2007 season, Rodriguez signed a new 10-year, $275&nbsp;million deal with the Yankees, extending his record for the sport's most lucrative contract.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071213&content_id=2324707&vkey=news_nyy&fext=.jsp&c_id=nyy|title=Yankees finalize deal with A-Rod |website=yankees.com|date=December 13, 2007|author =Anthony DiComo|accessdate=March 11, 2014}}</ref> He became the youngest player ever to hit [[500 home run club|500 home runs]], reaching the milestone in 2007. He was part of the Yankees' [[2009 World Series]] championship over the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], which was the first year of the new Yankee Stadium and Rodriguez's only world title. Toward the end of his career, Rodriguez was hampered by hip and knee injuries, which caused him to become exclusively a designated hitter.<ref name=\"DH\"/> He played his final game in professional baseball on August 12, 2016.\n\nDuring a 2007 interview with [[Katie Couric]] on ''[[60 Minutes]]'', Rodriguez denied using performance-enhancing drugs.

Sosa hit his 400th home run in his 1,354th game and his 5,273rd at-bat, reaching this milestone quicker than any player in [[National League]] history.

He also struck out 150 times, fourth most in the American League. Sosa started the 1991 season by hitting 2 home runs and driving in 5 runs. However, he would slump for the rest of the year and ended up batting .203 with 10 home runs and 33 runs batted in.\n\n===Chicago Cubs (1992&ndash;2004)===\nThe White Sox traded Sosa and [[Ken Patterson]] to the [[Chicago Cubs]] for [[outfielder]] [[George Bell (outfielder)|George Bell]] before the 1992 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/01/03/score-20-flashback-1-white-sox-trade-sosa-to-cubs-for-bell/|title=Flashback #1: White Sox Trade Sosa To Cubs For Bell (1992)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSosa batted .260 with 8 home runs and 25 RBIs in his first season with the Cubs. Although not spectacular numbers, it showed that Sosa improved as a hitter. In 1993, Sosa batted .261 with 33 [[home runs]] with 93 RBIs. He also showed his speed by stealing 38 bases. He became the Cubs' first 30-30 player in their history. Sosa continued to hit for power and speed in 1994 but he also improved his batting average. He ended up batting .300 with 25 home runs, 70 RBIs, and 22 [[stolen bases]].\n\nSosa was named to his first All-Star team in 1995. In 144 games, he batted .268 with 36 home runs and 119 RBIs. Sosa continued his success with the Cubs in 1996 as he batted .273 with 40 home runs and 100 RBIs. However, the next year, Sosa struggled. Despite hitting 36 home runs with 119 RBIs, Sosa batted just .251. He struggled to get on base(.300 on-base percentage) and led the league in strikeouts with 174.\n\nAfter years as a respected power/speed threat with a rocket arm in right field, he emerged during the 1998 season as one of baseball's greatest. It was in this season that both Sosa and [[Mark McGwire]] were involved in the \"[[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|home run record chase]]\", when both players' prowess for hitting [[home run]]s drew national attention as they attempted to pass [[Roger Maris]]' single season home run mark of 61 home runs that had stood since 1961. For the early months of the year, Sosa trailed McGwire significantly, being as many as 16 homers behind at one point in May. But as the chase progressed, Sosa would rally and eventually tie McGwire with 46 home runs each on August 10, after a couple months of straggling within a few homers for the lead. However, the moment was short lived as McGwire would pull away slightly and reach 62 home runs to break the record first on September 8, but once again Sosa would excitingly heat up the race by tying McGwire once again at 62 on September 13. Eleven days later, with two games left to play in the season, the two were tied at 66 home runs each. Sosa would end the season with 66 after playing both games without a home run(still a team record), just behind McGwire's 70 after hitting two home runs in each of the last two games. However, Sammy had become the first Major League batter ever to hit 66 home runs in a season. It was during that season, that Cubs announcer [[Chip Caray]] nicknamed him \"'''Slammin' Sammy'''\", a nickname that quickly spread. In addition, Sammy produced then career highs in batting average and slugging percentage, at .308 and .647 respectively. Sosa also led the league in [[RBI]]s and runs scored. [[File:Sosa cubs jersey.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Sosa wore #21 with the Cubs in honor of his childhood idol [[Roberto Clemente]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Cunniff | first = Bill | title = Sosa plays host at party at his island mansion | page = 3 | work = Chicago Sun-Times | date = November 26, 1999 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB424463A5BF794&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | accessdate = October 4, 2008 }}</ref>]]  Also in 1998, Sosa's 416 total bases were the most in a single season since [[Stan Musial]]'s 429 in 1948. Sosa's performance in the month of June, during which Sosa belted 20 home runs, knocked in 47 runs, and posted an .842 [[slugging percentage]], was one of the greatest offensive outbursts in major league history. Sosa won the [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|National League Most Valuable Player Award]] for leading the Cubs into the playoffs in 1998, earning every first-place vote except for the two cast by [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] writers, who voted for McGwire. He and McGwire shared ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine's 1998 \"[[Sportsman of the Year]]\" award. Sosa was honored with a [[ticker-tape parade]] in his honor in New York City, and he was invited to be a guest at US President [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1999 [[State of the Union Address]]. 1998 was also the first time the Cubs made the post-season since 1989. The Cubs qualified as the NL Wild Card team, but were swept by the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the [[1998 National League Division Series#Atlanta Braves vs. Chicago Cubs|NLDS]].\n\nIn the 1999 season, Sosa hit 63 home runs, again trailing Mark McGwire, who hit 65. In the 2000 season, Sosa led the league by hitting 50 home runs. He received the [[Babe Ruth Home Run Award]] for leading MLB in homers.<ref>{{cite news |last=MacMullan |first=Jackie |title=A bronze homage to Babe |date=October 17, 2002 |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |page=E3 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/214273981.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+17%2C+2002&author=JACKIE+MACMULLAN&pub=Boston+Globe&desc=A+BRONZE+HOMAGE+TO+BABE&pqatl=google |access-date=November 8, 2011 |quote=By 2001, they were paying their own way to present Sammy Sosa with his Babe Ruth Award.}}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, he hit 64 home runs, becoming the first player to hit 60 home runs in three seasons in his career. However, he did not lead the league in any of those seasons; in 2001, he finished behind [[Barry Bonds]], who hit 73 homers, breaking the single-season home run record set by McGwire in 1998 (70). In the same season he set personal records in [[Run (baseball)|runs]] scored (146), [[Run batted in|RBI]] (160), [[Base on balls|walks]] (116), [[on-base percentage]] (.437), [[slugging percentage]] (.737), and [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (.328).<ref name=\"BBREF.com\" /> He led the majors in runs and RBI, was 2nd in home runs, 2nd in slugging percentage, 1st in total bases, 3rd in walks, 4th in on-base percentage, 12th in batting average, and 15th in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]]. He also surpassed his 1998 number in total bases, racking up 425. Sosa once again led the league in home runs with 49 in 2002. Known as a free-swinger in his early years, and as a good [[strikeout]] candidate, Sammy became an effective hitter for average. He owns numerous team records for the Cubs, and he holds the major-league record for the most home runs hit in a month (20, in June 1998). In recognition of his accomplishments as a hitter, Sosa won the [[Silver Slugger Award]] (an award for offensive output, voted on by managers and coaches) in 1995 and in 1998 through 2002.<ref name=\"BBREF.com\" />\n\n{{anchor|Corked bat incident}}\nIn 2003, the Cubs won the National League Central Division title. The year was not all good news for Sosa, however. In May, he spent his first period on the [[disabled list]] since 1996 after having an injured toenail removed. On June 3, 2003, Sosa was ejected from a Chicago Cubs-[[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] game in the first inning when umpires discovered he had been using a [[corked bat]].<ref>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/news/2003/0603/1562772.html Sosa ejected after cork is found in shattered bat.] (June 4, 2003) ESPN.com.

He sneezed very violently, causing severe back pain. He was diagnosed with back spasms and placed on the disabled list. Later, he fell into one of the worst slumps of his career, only snapping out of it during the last week of the season. He was greatly depressed when the officials told him he couldn't play. He finished with 35 homers, far below his numbers of his best years.  In his final 10 years with the Cubs he clubbed 479 home runs; the most in history over a 10-year span. The final straw for the Cubs was an incident in late 2004. Sosa requested to sit out the last game of the season, which was at home against the [[Atlanta Braves]], and he left [[Wrigley Field]] early in the game. It was his last time in a Cubs uniform.\n\n===Baltimore Orioles and year off (2005&ndash;2006)===\n[[File:Sosa Spring training.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|Sosa in spring training with the Orioles in 2005]]\nOn January 28, 2005, the Cubs traded Sosa to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] in exchange for [[infielder]]-outfielder [[Jerry Hairston, Jr.]], infielder [[Mike Fontenot]], and RHP Dave Crouthers. To facilitate the deal, Sosa and his [[sports agent|agent]] agreed to waive the clause that guaranteed his 2006 salary, and the [[Major League Baseball Players Association|players' union]] indicated it would not object to that agreement. Under the deal, Sosa earned $17.875 million for the 2005 season, with the Cubs paying $7 million of his salary. By playing for the 2005 Orioles alongside fellow 500-home-run batter [[Rafael Palmeiro]], Sosa and Palmeiro became the first [[500 home run club]] members in history to play together on the same team after reaching the 500 home run plateau.{{efn|[[Hank Aaron]] reached 500 homers shortly after his teammate [[Eddie Mathews]] (512 homers) retired.|group=lower-alpha}}\n\nSosa finished the 2005 season batting .221 with 14 home runs, his worst performance since 1992, and continuing his post-2001 trend of declines in batting average, homers, total bases, and RBI. On December 7, 2005, the Orioles decided not to offer him an arbitration contract, effectively ending his Baltimore Orioles tenure and making him a free agent.\n\nIn 2005, ''[[The Sporting News]]'' published an update of their 1999 book ''Baseball's 100 Greatest Players''. Sosa did not make the original edition, but for the 2005 update, with his career totals considerably higher, he was ranked at Number 95. During a stretch of nine consecutive years, Sosa hit 35 or more home runs and 100+ RBIs, all with the Chicago Cubs.<ref name=\"BBREF.com\" />\n\nAt the end of January 2006, the [[Washington Nationals]] offered Sosa two different minor-league offers, both of which he turned down. On February 15, 2006, Sosa's agent [[Adam Katz]] stated: \"We're not going to put him on the retirement list. We decided that [not putting him on that list] was the best thing to do. But I can say, with reasonable certainty, that we've seen Sammy in a baseball uniform for the last time.\"<ref>Jayson Stark (February 16, 2006).

This was the same contract that Sosa turned down the previous year from the Nationals. The contract included an invitation to [[spring training]], where Sosa competed for a spot in the lineup with [[Nelson Cruz]], [[Jason Botts]], and other rookies/prospects.<ref>T. R.

He started the 2007 season as the Rangers' designated hitter and occasional right fielder.\nAt the same time, the Chicago Cubs awarded Sosa's number 21 to new pitcher [[Jason Marquis]], who coincidentally served up Sosa's 600th career home run. This caused some concern, due to Sosa's accomplishments with the Cubs, including his status as the Cubs' all-time home run leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/sports/deluca/268111,CST-SPT-deluca22.article|title=Sosa's 21 a long-distance number|last=DeLuca|first=Chris|date=February 22, 2007|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=February 4, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014727/http://www.suntimes.com/sports/deluca/268111%2CCST-SPT-deluca22.article|archivedate=September 30, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn April 26, 2007, Sosa made history by hitting a home run in his 45th major league ballpark. He has also homered in [[Champion Stadium|The Ballpark at Disney's Wide World of Sports]], near [[Orlando, Florida]], a usually minor-league and [[Spring training]] park that hosted a regular season series between the Rangers and the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] in May 2007, although he did not hit a homer at the two regular season games the Cubs played at the Tokyo Dome in 2000 vs. the Mets.\n\nOn June 20, 2007, Sosa hit a home run off of [[Jason Marquis]] during an inter-league game against the Chicago Cubs. Sosa became only the fifth man in history, following [[Babe Ruth]], [[Willie Mays]], [[Hank Aaron]], and [[Barry Bonds]], to hit 600 regular season home runs. The home run was the first one that Sosa had recorded against the Cubs, and as a result he has hit a home run against every active MLB team.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2911022 | title=Sosa becomes fifth player to blast 600 home runs | work=Associated Press | publisher=ESPN | date=June 20, 2007 | accessdate=June 19, 2017}}</ref> Sosa is the Cubs' all-time home run leader, having hit 545 with that team.\n\nOn May 28, 2008, Sosa announced that he instructed his agent not to offer his services to any MLB team for the 2008 season, and planned on filing for retirement, but never did.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3415614|title=Sosa not pursuing MLB job, says he intends to retire in 2009|accessdate=October 3, 2008 |work=ESPN.com|publisher= |date= }}</ref>\n\nOn December 25, 2008, Sosa announced he intended to unretire and play in the [[World Baseball Classic]] and once again test the free agent market in hopes of signing with a Major League ballclub in 2009. Sosa said that he had been keeping in shape at his home, and was hoping that after a strong World Baseball Classic he would prove to major-league teams that he was still capable of playing in the MLB. However, he was not selected as part of the Dominican Republic's roster.  He remained a free agent and did not actively look for a team.\n\nOn June 3, 2009, Sosa announced his intention to retire from baseball. He made the announcement in the Dominican Republic and said that he was calmly looking forward to his induction into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] since his statistics were up to par.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4229022 Sammy Sosa planning to announce formal retirement] ESPN</ref>\n\n==Drug test controversy and Hall of Fame==\n{{see|doping in baseball}}\nOn June 16, 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Sosa was on a list of players who had tested positive for [[Banned substances in baseball in the United States| performance-enhancing drugs]] in 2003, in baseball's [[doping in baseball|steroids scandal]].

On January 9, 2013, Sosa was not elected by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) into baseball's Hall of Fame in [[Cooperstown]], receiving 12.5% on his first year on the ballot (the requirement for election is 75%). For the elections of 2014 through 2016 he received 7.2%, 6.6%, and 7.0%. A candidate remains eligible for inclusion on subsequent ballots as long as he receives a minimum of 5.0% of the vote from the BBWAA. \n\nOn October 2, 2016 at a press conference at [[Fenway Park]], MLB Commissioner [[Rob Manfred]] said that anonymous drug tests from 2003 were inconclusive because \"it was hard to distinguish between certain substances that were legal, available over the counter, and not banned under our program.\"<ref name=\"espn.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/17706532/david-ortiz-says-did-wrong-03-failed-drug-test|title=Manfred: Possible Ortiz was PED-free in '03|publisher=}}</ref> Manfred argued that \"it was important to make people understand that even if your name was on that list, that it was entirely possible that you were not a positive\".<ref name=\"vocativ.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vocativ.com/364281/david-ortiz-retirement/|title=David Ortiz Gets A Steroid Hall Pass From MLB's Commissioner|date=October 3, 2016|publisher=}}</ref> Furthermore, Manfred sustained that the 2003 test was supposed to be confidential and it would be unfair to judge players based on \"leaks, rumors, innuendo, [and] not confirmed positive test results\".<ref name=\"espn.com\"/> Manfred finished by stating that Hall of Fame voters should use their best judgment and only consider confirmed testing by the MLB as there were many \"legitimate scientific questions about whether or not those were truly positives.\"<ref name=\"vocativ.com\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nSosa is married to Sonia Rodr\u00edguez, a Dominican TV dancer as a child,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cruz|first1=H\u00e9ctor J.|title=\u00c9l tambi\u00e9n es un humano, no lo olviden|url=http://www.listindiario.com/el-deporte/2010/06/07/145150/el-tambien-es-un-humano-no-lo-olviden|access-date=July 1, 2016|publisher=[[List\u00edn Diario]]|date=June 7, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701193035/http://www.listindiario.com/el-deporte/2010/06/07/145150/el-tambien-es-un-humano-no-lo-olviden|archivedate=July 1, 2016|language=Spanish|at=Note: The vedettes of the TV program \"{{illm|S\u00e1bado de Corpor\u00e1n|es}}\" were known as \"corporette\".|url-status=dead}}</ref> with whom he has six children: Keysha, Kenia, Sammy Jr., Michael, Kalexy and Rolando.

However, he would slump for the rest of the year and ended up batting .203 with 10 home runs and 33 runs batted in.\n\n===Chicago Cubs (1992&ndash;2004)===\nThe White Sox traded Sosa and [[Ken Patterson]] to the [[Chicago Cubs]] for [[outfielder]] [[George Bell (outfielder)|George Bell]] before the {{Baseball year|1992}} season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/01/03/score-20-flashback-1-white-sox-trade-sosa-to-cubs-for-bell/|title=Flashback #1: White Sox Trade Sosa To Cubs For Bell (1992)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSosa batted .260 with 8 home runs and 25 RBIs in his first season with the Cubs. Although not spectacular numbers, it showed that Sosa improved as a hitter. In 1993, Sosa batted .261 with 33 [[home runs]] with 93 RBIs. He also showed his speed by stealing 38 bases. He became the Cubs' first 30-30 player in their history. Sosa continued to hit for power and speed in 1994 but he also improved his batting average. He ended up batting .300 with 25 home runs, 70 RBIs, and 22 [[stolen bases]].\n\nSosa was named to his first All-Star team in 1995. In 144 games, he batted .268 with 36 home runs and 119 RBIs. Sosa continued his success with the Cubs in 1996 as he batted .273 with 40 home runs and 100 RBIs. However, the next year, Sosa struggled. Despite hitting 36 home runs with 119 RBIs, Sosa batted just .251. He struggled to get on base(.300 on-base percentage) and led the league in strikeouts with 174.\n\nAfter years as a respected power/speed threat with a rocket arm in right field, he emerged during the {{Baseball year|1998}} season as one of baseball's greatest. It was in this season that both Sosa and [[Mark McGwire]] were involved in the \"[[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|home run record chase]]\", when both players' prowess for hitting [[home run]]s drew national attention as they attempted to pass [[Roger Maris]]' single season home run mark of 61 home runs that had stood since {{Baseball year|1961}}. For the early months of the year, Sosa trailed McGwire significantly, being as many as 16 homers behind at one point in May. But as the chase progressed, Sosa would rally and eventually tie McGwire with 46 home runs each on August 10, after a couple months of straggling within a few homers for the lead. However, the moment was short lived as McGwire would pull away slightly and reach 62 home runs to break the record first on September 8, but once again Sosa would excitingly heat up the race by tying McGwire once again at 62 on September 13. Eleven days later, with two games left to play in the season, the two were tied at 66 home runs each. Sosa would end the season with 66 after playing both games without a home run(still a team record), just behind McGwire's 70 after hitting two home runs in each of the last two games. However, Sammy had become the first Major League batter ever to hit 66 home runs in a season. It was during that season, that Cubs announcer [[Chip Caray]] nicknamed him \"'''Slammin' Sammy'''\", a nickname that quickly spread. In addition, Sammy produced then career highs in batting average and slugging percentage, at .308 and .647 respectively. Sosa also led the league in [[RBI]]s and runs scored.

Sosa's performance in the month of June, during which Sosa belted 20 home runs, knocked in 47 runs, and posted an .842 [[slugging percentage]], was one of the greatest offensive outbursts in major league history. Sosa won the [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|National League Most Valuable Player Award]] for leading the Cubs into the playoffs in 1998, earning every first-place vote except for the two cast by [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] writers, who voted for McGwire. He and McGwire shared ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine's 1998 \"[[Sportsman of the Year]]\" award. Sosa was honored with a [[ticker-tape parade]] in his honor in New York City, and he was invited to be a guest at US President [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1999 [[State of the Union Address]]. 1998 was also the first time the Cubs made the post-season since 1989. The Cubs qualified as the NL Wild Card team, but were swept by the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the [[1998 National League Division Series#Atlanta Braves vs. Chicago Cubs|NLDS]].\n\nIn the {{Baseball year|1999}} season, Sosa hit 63 home runs, again trailing Mark McGwire, who hit 65. In the {{Baseball year|2000}} season, Sosa led the league by hitting 50 home runs. He received the [[Babe Ruth Home Run Award]] for leading MLB in homers.<ref>{{cite news |last=MacMullan |first=Jackie |title=A bronze homage to Babe |date=October 17, 2002 |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |page=E3 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/214273981.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+17%2C+2002&author=JACKIE+MACMULLAN&pub=Boston+Globe&desc=A+BRONZE+HOMAGE+TO+BABE&pqatl=google |access-date=November 8, 2011 |quote=By 2001, they were paying their own way to present Sammy Sosa with his Babe Ruth Award.}}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nIn {{Baseball year|2001}}, he hit 64 home runs, becoming the first player to hit 60 home runs in three seasons in his career. However, he did not lead the league in any of those seasons; in 2001, he finished behind [[Barry Bonds]], who hit 73 homers, breaking the single-season home run record set by McGwire in 1998 (70). In the same season he set personal records in [[Run (baseball)|runs]] scored (146), [[Run batted in|RBI]] (160), [[Base on balls|walks]] (116), [[on-base percentage]] (.437), [[slugging percentage]] (.737), and [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (.328).<ref name=\"BBREF.com\" /> He led the majors in runs and RBI, was 2nd in home runs, 2nd in slugging percentage, 1st in total bases, 3rd in walks, 4th in on-base percentage, 12th in batting average, and 15th in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]]. He also surpassed his 1998 number in total bases, racking up 425. Sosa once again led the league in home runs with 49 in {{Baseball year|2002}}. Known as a free-swinger in his early years, and as a good [[strikeout]] candidate, Sammy became an effective hitter for average. He owns numerous team records for the Cubs, and he holds the major-league record for the most home runs hit in a month (20, in June 1998). In recognition of his accomplishments as a hitter, Sosa won the [[Silver Slugger Award]] (an award for offensive output, voted on by managers and coaches) in {{Baseball year|1995}} and in 1998 through 2002.<ref name=\"BBREF.com\" />\n\n{{anchor|Corked bat incident}}\nIn {{Baseball year|2003}}, the Cubs won the National League Central Division title. The year was not all good news for Sosa, however. In May, he spent his first period on the [[disabled list]] since {{Baseball year|1996}} after having an injured toenail removed. On June 3, 2003, Sosa was ejected from a Chicago Cubs-[[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] game in the first inning when umpires discovered he had been using a [[corked bat]].<ref>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/news/2003/0603/1562772.html Sosa ejected after cork is found in shattered bat.] (June 4, 2003) ESPN.com.

He sneezed very violently, causing severe back pain. He was diagnosed with back spasms and placed on the disabled list. Later, he fell into one of the worst slumps of his career, only snapping out of it during the last week of the season. He was greatly depressed when the officials told him he couldn't play. He finished with 35 homers, far below his numbers of his best years.  In his final 10 years with the Cubs he clubbed 479 home runs; the most in history over a 10-year span. The final straw for the Cubs was an incident in late 2004. Sosa requested to sit out the last game of the season, which was at home against the [[Atlanta Braves]], and he left [[Wrigley Field]] early in the game. It was his last time in a Cubs uniform.\n\n===Baltimore Orioles and year off (2005&ndash;2006)===\n[[File:Sosa Spring training.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|Sosa in spring training with the Orioles in 2005]]\nOn January 28, 2005, the Cubs traded Sosa to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] in exchange for [[infielder]]-outfielder [[Jerry Hairston, Jr.]], infielder [[Mike Fontenot]], and RHP Dave Crouthers. To facilitate the deal, Sosa and his [[sports agent|agent]] agreed to waive the clause that guaranteed his 2006 salary, and the [[Major League Baseball Players Association|players' union]] indicated it would not object to that agreement. Under the deal, Sosa earned $17.875 million for the 2005 season, with the Cubs paying $7 million of his salary. By playing for the 2005 Orioles alongside fellow 500-home-run batter [[Rafael Palmeiro]], Sosa and Palmeiro became the first [[500 home run club]] members in history to play together on the same team after reaching the 500 home run plateau.{{efn|[[Hank Aaron]] reached 500 homers shortly after his teammate [[Eddie Mathews]] (512 homers) retired.|group=lower-alpha}}\n\nSosa finished the 2005 season batting .221 with 14 home runs, his worst performance since 1992, and continuing his post-2001 trend of declines in batting average, homers, total bases, and RBI. On December 7, 2005, the Orioles decided not to offer him an arbitration contract, effectively ending his Baltimore Orioles tenure and making him a free agent.\n\nIn 2005, ''[[The Sporting News]]'' published an update of their 1999 book ''Baseball's 100 Greatest Players''. Sosa did not make the original edition, but for the 2005 update, with his career totals considerably higher, he was ranked at Number 95. During a stretch of nine consecutive years, Sosa hit 35 or more home runs and 100+ RBIs, all with the Chicago Cubs.<ref name=\"BBREF.com\" />\n\nAt the end of January 2006, the [[Washington Nationals]] offered Sosa two different minor-league offers, both of which he turned down. On February 15, 2006, Sosa's agent [[Adam Katz]] stated: \"We're not going to put him on the retirement list. We decided that [not putting him on that list] was the best thing to do. But I can say, with reasonable certainty, that we've seen Sammy in a baseball uniform for the last time.\"<ref>Jayson Stark (February 16, 2006).

This was the same contract that Sosa turned down the previous year from the Nationals.

He started the 2007 season as the Rangers' designated hitter and occasional right fielder.\nAt the same time, the Chicago Cubs awarded Sosa's number 21 to new pitcher [[Jason Marquis]], who coincidentally served up Sosa's 600th career home run. This caused some concern, due to Sosa's accomplishments with the Cubs, including his status as the Cubs' all-time home run leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/sports/deluca/268111,CST-SPT-deluca22.article|title=Sosa's 21 a long-distance number|last=DeLuca|first=Chris|date=February 22, 2007|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=February 4, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014727/http://www.suntimes.com/sports/deluca/268111%2CCST-SPT-deluca22.article|archivedate=September 30, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn April 26, 2007, Sosa made history by hitting a home run in his 45th major league ballpark. He has also homered in [[Champion Stadium|The Ballpark at Disney's Wide World of Sports]], near [[Orlando, Florida]], a usually minor-league and [[Spring training]] park that hosted a regular season series between the Rangers and the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] in May 2007, although he did not hit a homer at the two regular season games the Cubs played at the Tokyo Dome in 2000 vs. the Mets.\n\nOn June 20, 2007, Sosa hit a home run off of [[Jason Marquis]] during an inter-league game against the Chicago Cubs. Sosa became only the fifth man in history, following [[Babe Ruth]], [[Willie Mays]], [[Hank Aaron]], and [[Barry Bonds]], to hit 600 regular season home runs. The home run was the first one that Sosa had recorded against the Cubs, and as a result he has hit a home run against every active MLB team.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2911022 | title=Sosa becomes fifth player to blast 600 home runs | work=Associated Press | publisher=ESPN | date=June 20, 2007 | accessdate=June 19, 2017}}</ref> Sosa is the Cubs' all-time home run leader, having hit 545 with that team.\n\nOn May 28, {{Baseball year|2008}}, Sosa announced that he instructed his agent not to offer his services to any MLB team for the 2008 season, and planned on filing for retirement, but never did.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3415614|title=Sosa not pursuing MLB job, says he intends to retire in 2009|accessdate=2008-10-03 |work=ESPN.com|publisher= |date= }}</ref>\n\nOn December 25, 2008, Sosa announced he intended to unretire and play in the [[World Baseball Classic]] and once again test the free agent market in hopes of signing with a Major League ballclub in 2009. Sosa said that he had been keeping in shape at his home, and was hoping that after a strong World Baseball Classic he would prove to major-league teams that he was still capable of playing in the MLB. However, he was not selected as part of the Dominican Republic's roster.  He remained a free agent and did not actively look for a team.\n\nOn June 3, 2009, Sosa announced his intention to retire from baseball. He made the announcement in the Dominican Republic and said that he was calmly looking forward to his induction into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] since his statistics were up to par.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4229022 Sammy Sosa planning to announce formal retirement] ESPN</ref>\n\n==Drug test controversy and Hall of Fame==\n{{see|doping in baseball}}\nOn June 16, 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Sosa was on a list of players who had tested positive for [[Banned substances in baseball in the United States| performance-enhancing drugs]] in 2003, in baseball's [[doping in baseball|steroids scandal]].

On January 9, 2013, Sosa was not elected by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) into baseball's Hall of Fame in [[Cooperstown]], receiving 12.5% on his first year on the ballot (the requirement for election is 75%). For the elections of 2014 through 2016 he received 7.2%, 6.6%, and 7.0%. A candidate remains eligible for inclusion on subsequent ballots as long as he receives a minimum of 5.0% of the vote from the BBWAA. \n\nOn October 2, 2016 at a press conference at [[Fenway Park]], MLB Commissioner [[Rob Manfred]] said that anonymous drug tests from 2003 were inconclusive because \"it was hard to distinguish between certain substances that were legal, available over the counter, and not banned under our program.\"<ref name=\"espn.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/17706532/david-ortiz-says-did-wrong-03-failed-drug-test|title=Manfred: Possible Ortiz was PED-free in '03|publisher=}}</ref> Manfred argued that \"it was important to make people understand that even if your name was on that list, that it was entirely possible that you were not a positive\".<ref name=\"vocativ.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vocativ.com/364281/david-ortiz-retirement/|title=David Ortiz Gets A Steroid Hall Pass From MLB's Commissioner|date=3 October 2016|publisher=}}</ref> Furthermore, Manfred sustained that the 2003 test was supposed to be confidential and it would be unfair to judge players based on \"leaks, rumors, innuendo, [and] not confirmed positive test results\".<ref name=\"espn.com\"/> Manfred finished by stating that Hall of Fame voters should use their best judgment and only consider confirmed testing by the MLB as there were many \"legitimate scientific questions about whether or not those were truly positives.\"<ref name=\"vocativ.com\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nSosa is married to Sonia Rodr\u00edguez, a Dominican TV dancer as a child,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cruz|first1=H\u00e9ctor J.|title=\u00c9l tambi\u00e9n es un humano, no lo olviden|url=http://www.listindiario.com/el-deporte/2010/06/07/145150/el-tambien-es-un-humano-no-lo-olviden|access-date=July 1, 2016|publisher=[[List\u00edn Diario]]|date=June 7, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701193035/http://www.listindiario.com/el-deporte/2010/06/07/145150/el-tambien-es-un-humano-no-lo-olviden|archivedate=July 1, 2016|language=Spanish|at=Note: The vedettes of the TV program \"{{illm|S\u00e1bado de Corpor\u00e1n|es}}\" were known as \"corporette\".|url-status=dead}}</ref> with whom he has six children: Keysha, Kenia, Sammy Jr., Michael, Kalexy and Rolando.

His [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) playing career spanned from 1986 to 2001 while playing for the [[Oakland Athletics]] and the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], winning one [[World Series]] championship each with Oakland as a player in [[1989 World Series|1989]] and with St. Louis as a coach in [[2011 World Series|2011]].  One of the most prolific [[home run]] hitters in baseball history, McGwire holds the major league career record for [[at bats per home run]] ratio (10.6), and is the former record holder for both [[List of Major League Baseball progressive single-season home run leaders|home runs in a single season]] (70 in 1998) and home runs hit by rookie (49 in 1987).  \n\nHe ranks 11th all time in [[home run]]s with 583, and led the major leagues in home runs in five different seasons, while establishing the major league record for home runs hit in a four-season period from 1996 to 1999 with 245.  Further, he demonstrated exemplary patience as a batter, producing a career .394 [[on-base percentage]] (OBP) and twice leading the major leagues in [[bases on balls]].  Injuries cut short the manifestation of even greater potential as he reached 140 games played in just eight of 16 total seasons.  A right-handed batter and thrower, McGwire stood {{convert|6|ft|5|in|m}} tall and weighed {{convert|245|lb}} during his playing career.\n\nA part of the [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase]] of [[Roger Maris]]' 61 with the Cardinals, McGwire set the [[Major League Baseball single-season home run record|major league single-season home run record]] with 70,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HR_progress.shtml |title=Progressive Leaders & Records for Home Runs |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> which [[Barry Bonds]] broke three years later with 73.<ref name=Bonds-testified>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1937594 |title=\"Bonds testified that substances didn't work\", ESPN.com, December 4, 2004, accessed 02/03/11 |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=December 4, 2004 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>  McGwire also led the league in [[runs batted in]], twice in [[bases on balls]] and [[on-base percentage]], and four times in [[slugging percentage]].

His father was a [[dentist]]. He attended [[Damien High School]] in [[La Verne, California]], where he played baseball, golf, and basketball. He was drafted by the [[Montreal Expos]] in the 1981 amateur draft but did not sign.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mcgwima01.shtml|title=Mark McGwire Stats - Baseball-Reference.com|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> He played college baseball at the [[University of Southern California]] (where he was a teammate of [[Randy Johnson]] and [[Jack Del Rio]]) under coach [[Rod Dedeaux]].\n\nMcGwire was selected by the Athletics with the 10th overall selection in the [[1984 Major League Baseball draft|1984 MLB draft]]. \n\nHe was a member of the [[silver medal]]-winning entry of the [[United States national baseball team|United States national team]]<nowiki/> that [[Baseball  at the 1984 Summer Olympics|same year]]<nowiki/> at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]], with Japan finishing ahead for gold medal.\n\n==Playing career (1984\u20132001)==\n\n===Oakland Athletics (1984\u20131997)===\n\nAfter three years at Southern California and a stint on the 1984 U.S. Olympic team, the [[Oakland Athletics]] drafted McGwire tenth overall in the [[1984 Major League Baseball draft]].\n\nMcGwire debuted in the major leagues in August [[1986 Oakland Athletics season|1986]], hitting three [[home run]]s and nine [[runs batted in]] in 18 games.\n\n====Rookie home run record and major league leader (1987)====\n\nRetaining his rookie status in 1987, McGwire took center stage in baseball with his home runs. He hit just four in the month of April, but followed in May with 15, and another nine in June. Before the All-Star break arrived, he totaled 33 HR and earned a spot on the [[American League]] (AL) [[1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star team]]. On August 11, he broke [[Al Rosen]]'s AL rookie record of 37 home runs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/APAB/lib00581,122CA98E1CEF7498.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708140841/http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/APAB/lib00581,122CA98E1CEF7498.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 8, 2012|date=August 10, 2008}}</ref>  Three days later, McGwire broke the major league record of 38, which [[Frank Robinson]] and [[Wally Berger]] jointly held. In September, McGwire hit nine more home runs while posting monthly personal bests of a .351 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], .419 [[on-base percentage]] (OBP) and 11 [[Double (baseball)|doubles]] (2B). With 49 HR and two games remaining in the regular season, he chose to sit them out with an opportunity for 50 home runs to be present for the birth of his first child. McGwire also totaled 118 [[runs batted in]] (RBI), .289 batting average, 97 [[Run (baseball)|runs]] scored, 28 doubles, a .618 [[slugging percentage]] and a .370 [[on-base percentage]] (OBP). McGwire's 49 home runs as a rookie stood as a major league record until [[Aaron Judge]] hit 52 for the [[New York Yankees]] in 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/news/yankees-aaron-judge-sets-rookie-hr-record-mark-mcgwire/xyqbr125vm8k13f1ips4sg1nl|title=Yankees' Aaron Judge breaks Mark McGwire's rookie HR record|date=September 26, 2017|work=Sporting News|access-date=December 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNot only did he lead the AL in home runs in 1987, but he also tied for the major league lead with [[1987 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] right fielder [[Andre Dawson]]. McGwire also led the major leagues in SLG, finished second in the AL in adjusted [[on-base plus slugging]] percentage (OPS+, 164) total bases (344), third in RBI and on-base plus slugging (OPS, .987). He was thus a unanimous choice for the AL [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]] and finished sixth overall in the AL [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] voting.\n\n====More All-Star appearances (1988\u201391)====\n\n[[File:Mark McGwire 1989.jpg|thumb|left|McGwire with the A's, 1989]]\n\nFrom [[1988 Oakland Athletics season|1988]] to [[1990 Oakland Athletics season|1990]], McGwire followed with 32, 33, and 39 home runs, respectively, becoming the first Major Leaguer to hit 30+ home runs in each of his first four full seasons.<ref name=\"BaseballRefMain\">{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/m/mcgwima01.shtml |title=Mark McGwire Statistics |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>  On July 3 and 4, 1988, he hit game-winning home runs in the 16th inning of both games.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/TOR/TOR198807030.shtml |title=July 3, 1988 Oakland Athletics at Toronto Blue Jays play by play and box score |website=Baseball-Reference.com |date=July 3, 1988 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CLE/CLE198807040.shtml |title=July 4, 1988 Oakland Athletics at Cleveland Indians Jays play by play and box score |website=Baseball-Reference.com |date=July 4, 1988 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> Through May 2009, McGwire was tied for third all-time with [[Joe DiMaggio]] in home runs over his first two calendar years in the major leagues (71), behind [[Chuck Klein]] (83) and [[Ryan Braun]] (79).<ref>[https://nationalpost.com/sports/story.html?id=1633915 Sandler, Jeremy, \"NL Weekly: The Notebook\", National Post, May 27, 2009, accessed 5/28/09]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nMcGwire's most famous home run with the A's was likely his game-winning solo shot in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 3 of the [[1988 World Series]] against the [[1988 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] and former A's [[Closer (baseball)|closer]] [[Jay Howell]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/OAK/OAK198810180.shtml |title=October 18, 1988 World Series Game 3 at Network Associates Coliseum Play by Play and Box Score |website=Baseball-Reference.com |date=October 18, 1988 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>  McGwire's game-winner brought the A's their only victory in the 1988 World Series, which they lost in five games; however, McGwire and his fellow [[Bash Brother]], [[Jos\u00e9 Canseco]], played a large part in the 1989 championship club that defeated the [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in the famous \"[[1989 World Series|Earthquake Series]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1989_WS.shtml |title=1989 World Series \u2013 OAK vs. SFG |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\nWorking diligently on his defense at first base, McGwire bristled at the notion that he was a one-dimensional player. He was generally regarded as a good fielder in his early years, even winning a [[Gold Glove Award]] in 1990 \u2013 the only one that [[New York Yankees]] legend [[Don Mattingly]] would not win between 1985 and 1994. In later years, his mobility decreased and, with it, his defense; however, McGwire's batting averages after his rookie season plummeted to .260, .231, and .235 from 1988 to 1990. In 1991, he bottomed out with a .201 average and 22 homers. [[List of Oakland Athletics managers|Manager]] [[Tony La Russa]] sat him out the final game of the [[1991 Oakland Athletics season|season]] to avoid allowing his batting average to dip below .200. Despite the declining averages during this time of his career, his high [[bases on balls]] totals allowed him to maintain acceptable OBPs. In fact, when he hit .201, his OPS+ was 103, or just over league average.\n\nMcGwire stated in an interview with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that 1991 was the \"worst year\" of his life, with his on-field performance and marriage difficulties, and that he \"didn't lift a weight\" that entire season. With all that behind him, McGwire re-dedicated himself to working out harder than ever and received visual therapy from a sports vision specialist.<ref>[http://www.sdccd.edu/events/we/wepdf/we-sp99.pdf] https://web.archive.org/web/20150701040841/http://www.sdccd.edu/events/we/wepdf/we-sp99.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/features/mcgwire/flashbacks/060192/ |work=CNN |accessdate=May 12, 2010 |title=Oakland's Mark McGwire is smiling again, now that he's hitting homers at a record pace |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104193550/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/features/mcgwire/flashbacks/060192/ |archivedate=November 4, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n====Career resurgence (1992\u201397)====\n\nThe \"new look\" McGwire hit 42 homers and batted .268 in 1992, with an outstanding OPS+ of 175 (the highest of his career to that point), and put on a home run hitting show at the [[Home Run Derby]] during the [[1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1992 All-Star break]]. His performance propelled the [[1992 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] to the American League West Division title in 1992, their fourth in five seasons. The A's lost in the [[1992 American League Championship Series|playoffs]] to the eventual [[1992 World Series|World Series]] champion, the [[1992 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]].\n\nFoot injuries limited McGwire to a total of 74 games in [[1993 Oakland Athletics season|1993]] and [[1994 Oakland Athletics season|1994]], and just 9 home runs in each of the two seasons. He played just 104 games in [[1995 Oakland Athletics season|1995]], but his proportional totals were much improved: 39 home runs in 317 at-bats. In [[1996 Oakland Athletics season|1996]], McGwire belted a major league leading 52 homers in 423 at-bats. He also hit a career high .312 average, and led the league in both slugging percentage and on-base percentage.\n\nMcGwire's total of 363 home runs with the Athletics surpassed the previous franchise record. He was selected or voted to nine [[American League]] All-Star Teams while playing for the A's, including six consecutive appearances from [[1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1987]] through [[1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1992]].

In 51 games with the Cardinals to finish the 1997 season, McGwire compiled a .253 batting average, 24 home runs, and 42 RBI. Overall in 1997, McGwire led the majors with 58 home runs. He also finished third in the major leagues in slugging percentage (.646), fourth in OPS (1.039), fifth in OPS+ (170), tenth in RBI (123), and ninth in walks (101). He placed 16th in the NL MVP voting.\n\nIt was the last year of his contract, so there was speculation that McGwire would play for the Cardinals only for the remainder of the season, then seek a long-term deal, possibly in Southern California, where he still lived; however, McGwire signed a contract to stay in St. Louis. It is also believed that McGwire later encouraged [[Jim Edmonds]], another Southern California resident who was traded to St. Louis, to forgo free agency and sign a contract with the Cardinals in 2000.\n\n====Single-season home run record chase (1998)====\n\nAs the [[1998 St. Louis Cardinals season|1998 season]] progressed, it became clear that McGwire, [[1998 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] outfielder [[Ken Griffey Jr.]], and [[1998 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] outfielder [[Sammy Sosa]] were all on track to break [[Roger Maris]]'s single-season home run record. [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|The race to break the record]] first attracted media attention as the home run leader changed often throughout the season. On August 19, Sosa hit his 48th home run to move ahead of McGwire; however, later that day McGwire hit his 48th and 49th home runs to regain the lead.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOn September 8, 1998, McGwire hit a pitch by the Cubs' [[Steve Trachsel]] over the left field wall for his record-breaking 62nd home run, setting off massive celebrations at [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]]. The fact that the game was against the Cubs meant that Sosa was able to congratulate McGwire personally on his achievement. Members of Maris's family were also present at the game. The ball was freely, albeit controversially, given to McGwire in a ceremony on the field by the stadium worker who found it.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nMcGwire finished the 1998 season with 70 home runs (including five in his last three games), four ahead of Sosa's 66, a record that was broken three seasons later in 2001 by [[Barry Bonds]] with 73.<ref name=Bonds-testified/>\n\nMcGwire was honored with the inaugural [[Babe Ruth Home Run Award]] for leading Major League Baseball in home runs.<ref name=harber>{{cite news|last=Harber|first=Paul|title=A statue fit for a home run king|date=July 22, 2001|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8659756.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602104753/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8659756.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 2, 2013|accessdate=November 8, 2011|quote=The first award was given to Mark McGwire after his 70-home-run season in 1998.}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Although McGwire had the prestige of the home run record, Sammy Sosa (who had fewer HR but more RBI and stolen bases) won the 1998 NL MVP award, as his contributions helped propel the Cubs to the [[1998 National League Division Series|playoffs]] (the [[1998 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] in 1998 finished third in the NL Central).

For the fourth consecutive season, he led MLB in home runs with 65. It was also his fourth consecutive season with at least 50 home runs, extending his own major league record. Sosa, who hit 63 home runs in 1999, again trailed McGwire. Thus, they became the first, and still only, players in major league history to hit 60 or more home runs in consecutive seasons. McGwire also set a record from 1998 to 1999 for home runs in a two-season period with 135. Further, he owned the highest four-season HR total, with 245 from 1996 to 1999. In 1999, he drove in an NL-leading 147 runs while only having 145 hits, the highest RBI-per-hit tally for a season in baseball history.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nStatistically in 2000 and 2001, McGwire's numbers declined relative to previous years as he struggled to avoid injury (32 HR in 89 games, and 29 HR in 97 games, respectively).

Further, in each of those four seasons, he exceeded 50 home runs, becoming the first player to do so. He was also the first player to hit 49 or more home runs five times, including his rookie-season record of 49 in 1987.

That year, he was elected to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]]. In 2005, ''The Sporting News'' published an update of their list, and McGwire had been moved up to Number 84.\n\nMcGwire first became eligible for [[National Baseball Hall of Fame & Museum|Hall of Fame]] voting in 2007.

baseball]] [[first baseman]]. His [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) playing career spanned from 1986 to 2001 while playing for the [[Oakland Athletics]] and the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], winning one [[World Series]] championship each with Oakland as a player in [[1989 World Series|1989]] and with St. Louis as a coach in [[2011 World Series|2011]].  One of the most prolific [[home run]] hitters in baseball history, McGwire holds the major league career record for [[at bats per home run]] ratio (10.6), and is the former record holder for both [[List of Major League Baseball progressive single-season home run leaders|home runs in a single season]] (70 in 1998) and home runs hit by rookie (49 in 1987).  \n\nHe ranks 11th all time in [[home run]]s with 583, and led the major leagues in home runs in five different seasons, while establishing the major league record for home runs hit in a four-season period from 1996 to 1999 with 245.  Further, he demonstrated exemplary patience as a batter, producing a career .394 [[on-base percentage]] (OBP) and twice leading the major leagues in [[bases on balls]].  Injuries cut short the manifestation of even greater potential as he reached 140 games played in just eight of 16 total seasons.  A right-handed batter and thrower, McGwire stood {{convert|6|ft|5|in|m}} tall and weighed {{convert|245|lb}} during his playing career.\n\nA part of the [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase]] of [[Roger Maris]]' 61 with the Cardinals, McGwire set the [[Major League Baseball single-season home run record|major league single-season home run record]] with 70,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HR_progress.shtml |title=Progressive Leaders & Records for Home Runs |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> which [[Barry Bonds]] broke three years later with 73.<ref name=Bonds-testified>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1937594 |title=\"Bonds testified that substances didn't work\", ESPN.com, December 4, 2004, accessed 02/03/11 |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=December 4, 2004 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>  McGwire also led the league in [[runs batted in]], twice in [[bases on balls]] and [[on-base percentage]], and four times in [[slugging percentage]]. Injuries significantly cut into his playing time in 2000 and 2001 before factoring into his retirement. He finished with 583 home runs, which was [[500 home run club|fifth all-time]] when he retired.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mcgwima01.shtml|title=Mark McGwire Stats {{!}} Baseball-Reference.com|website=Baseball-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-17}}</ref>\n\nMcGwire was a central figure in baseball's [[doping in baseball|steroids scandal]].

His father was a [[dentist]]. He attended [[Damien High School]] in [[La Verne, California]], where he played baseball, golf, and basketball. He was drafted by the [[Montreal Expos]] in the 1981 amateur draft but did not sign.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mcgwima01.shtml|title=Mark McGwire Stats - Baseball-Reference.com|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> He played college baseball at the [[University of Southern California]] (where he was a teammate of [[Randy Johnson]] and [[Jack Del Rio]]) under coach [[Rod Dedeaux]].\n\nMcGwire was selected by the Athletics with the 10th overall selection in the [[1984 Major League Baseball draft|1984 MLB draft]]. \n\nHe was a member of the [[silver medal]]-winning entry of the [[United States national baseball team|United States national team]]<nowiki/> that [[Baseball  at the 1984 Summer Olympics|same year]]<nowiki/> at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]], with Japan finishing ahead for gold medal.\n\n==Playing career (1984\u20132001)==\n\n===Oakland Athletics (1984\u20131997)===\n\nAfter three years at Southern California and a stint on the 1984 U.S. Olympic team, the [[Oakland Athletics]] drafted McGwire tenth overall in the [[1984 Major League Baseball draft]].\n\nMcGwire debuted in the major leagues in August [[1986 Oakland Athletics season|1986]], hitting three [[home run]]s and nine [[runs batted in]] in 18 games.\n\n====Rookie home run record and major league leader (1987)====\n\nRetaining his rookie status in [[1987 Major League Baseball season|1987]], McGwire took center stage in baseball with his home runs. He hit just four in the month of April, but followed in May with 15, and another nine in June. Before the All-Star break arrived, he totaled 33 HR and earned a spot on the [[American League]] (AL) [[1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star team]]. On August 11, he broke [[Al Rosen]]'s AL rookie record of 37 home runs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/APAB/lib00581,122CA98E1CEF7498.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708140841/http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/APAB/lib00581,122CA98E1CEF7498.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 8, 2012|date=August 10, 2008}}</ref>  Three days later, McGwire broke the major league record of 38, which [[Frank Robinson]] and [[Wally Berger]] jointly held. In September, McGwire hit nine more home runs while posting monthly personal bests of a .351 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], .419 [[on-base percentage]] (OBP) and 11 [[Double (baseball)|doubles]] (2B). With 49 HR and two games remaining in the regular season, he chose to sit them out with an opportunity for 50 home runs to be present for the birth of his first child. McGwire also totaled 118 [[runs batted in]] (RBI), .289 batting average, 97 [[Run (baseball)|runs]] scored, 28 doubles, a .618 [[slugging percentage]] and a .370 [[on-base percentage]] (OBP). McGwire's 49 home runs as a rookie stood as a major league record until [[Aaron Judge]] hit 52 for the [[New York Yankees]] in 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/news/yankees-aaron-judge-sets-rookie-hr-record-mark-mcgwire/xyqbr125vm8k13f1ips4sg1nl|title=Yankees' Aaron Judge breaks Mark McGwire's rookie HR record|date=2017-09-26|work=Sporting News|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref>\n\nNot only did he lead the AL in home runs in 1987, but he also tied for the major league lead with [[1987 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] right fielder [[Andre Dawson]]. McGwire also led the major leagues in SLG, finished second in the AL in adjusted [[on-base plus slugging]] percentage (OPS+, 164) total bases (344), third in RBI and on-base plus slugging (OPS, .987). He was thus a unanimous choice for the AL [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]] and finished sixth overall in the AL [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] voting.\n\n====More All-Star appearances (1988\u201391)====\n\n[[File:Mark McGwire 1989.jpg|thumb|left|McGwire with the A's, 1989]]\n\nFrom [[1988 Oakland Athletics season|1988]] to [[1990 Oakland Athletics season|1990]], McGwire followed with 32, 33, and 39 home runs, respectively, becoming the first Major Leaguer to hit 30+ home runs in each of his first four full seasons.<ref name=\"BaseballRefMain\">{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/m/mcgwima01.shtml |title=Mark McGwire Statistics |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>  On July 3 and 4, 1988, he hit game-winning home runs in the 16th inning of both games.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/TOR/TOR198807030.shtml |title=July 3, 1988 Oakland Athletics at Toronto Blue Jays play by play and box score |website=Baseball-Reference.com |date=July 3, 1988 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CLE/CLE198807040.shtml |title=July 4, 1988 Oakland Athletics at Cleveland Indians Jays play by play and box score |website=Baseball-Reference.com |date=July 4, 1988 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> Through May 2009, McGwire was tied for third all-time with [[Joe DiMaggio]] in home runs over his first two calendar years in the major leagues (71), behind [[Chuck Klein]] (83) and [[Ryan Braun]] (79).<ref>[https://nationalpost.com/sports/story.html?id=1633915 Sandler, Jeremy, \"NL Weekly: The Notebook\", National Post, May 27, 2009, accessed 5/28/09]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nMcGwire's most famous home run with the A's was likely his game-winning solo shot in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 3 of the [[1988 World Series]] against the [[1988 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] and former A's [[Closer (baseball)|closer]] [[Jay Howell]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/OAK/OAK198810180.shtml |title=October 18, 1988 World Series Game 3 at Network Associates Coliseum Play by Play and Box Score |website=Baseball-Reference.com |date=October 18, 1988 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>  McGwire's game-winner brought the A's their only victory in the 1988 World Series, which they lost in five games; however, McGwire and his fellow [[Bash Brother]], [[Jos\u00e9 Canseco]], played a large part in the 1989 championship club that defeated the [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in the famous \"[[1989 World Series|Earthquake Series]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1989_WS.shtml |title=1989 World Series \u2013 OAK vs. SFG |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\nWorking diligently on his defense at first base, McGwire bristled at the notion that he was a one-dimensional player. He was generally regarded as a good fielder in his early years, even winning a [[Gold Glove Award]] in [[1990 Major League Baseball season|1990]] \u2013 the only one that [[New York Yankees]] legend [[Don Mattingly]] would not win between [[1985 Major League Baseball season|1985]] and [[1994 Major League Baseball season|1994]]. In later years, his mobility decreased and, with it, his defense; however, McGwire's batting averages after his rookie season plummeted to .260, .231, and .235 from 1988 to 1990. In 1991, he bottomed out with a .201 average and 22 homers. [[List of Oakland Athletics managers|Manager]] [[Tony La Russa]] sat him out the final game of the [[1991 Oakland Athletics season|season]] to avoid allowing his batting average to dip below .200. Despite the declining averages during this time of his career, his high [[bases on balls]] totals allowed him to maintain acceptable OBPs. In fact, when he hit .201, his OPS+ was 103, or just over league average.\n\nMcGwire stated in an interview with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that 1991 was the \"worst year\" of his life, with his on-field performance and marriage difficulties, and that he \"didn't lift a weight\" that entire season. With all that behind him, McGwire re-dedicated himself to working out harder than ever and received visual therapy from a sports vision specialist.<ref>[http://www.sdccd.edu/events/we/wepdf/we-sp99.pdf] https://web.archive.org/web/20150701040841/http://www.sdccd.edu/events/we/wepdf/we-sp99.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/features/mcgwire/flashbacks/060192/ |work=CNN |accessdate=May 12, 2010 |title=Oakland's Mark McGwire is smiling again, now that he's hitting homers at a record pace |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104193550/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/features/mcgwire/flashbacks/060192/ |archivedate=November 4, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n====Career resurgence (1992\u201397)====\n\nThe \"new look\" McGwire hit 42 homers and batted .268 in 1992, with an outstanding OPS+ of 175 (the highest of his career to that point), and put on a home run hitting show at the [[Home Run Derby]] during the [[1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1992 All-Star break]]. His performance propelled the [[1992 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] to the American League West Division title in 1992, their fourth in five seasons. The A's lost in the [[1992 American League Championship Series|playoffs]] to the eventual [[1992 World Series|World Series]] champion, the [[1992 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]].\n\nFoot injuries limited McGwire to a total of 74 games in [[1993 Oakland Athletics season|1993]] and [[1994 Oakland Athletics season|1994]], and just 9 home runs in each of the two seasons. He played just 104 games in [[1995 Oakland Athletics season|1995]], but his proportional totals were much improved: 39 home runs in 317 at-bats. In [[1996 Oakland Athletics season|1996]], McGwire belted a major league leading 52 homers in 423 at-bats. He also hit a career high .312 average, and led the league in both slugging percentage and on-base percentage.\n\nMcGwire's total of 363 home runs with the Athletics surpassed the previous franchise record. He was selected or voted to nine [[American League]] All-Star Teams while playing for the A's, including six consecutive appearances from [[1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1987]] through [[1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1992]].

In 51 games with the Cardinals to finish the 1997 season, McGwire compiled a .253 batting average, 24 home runs, and 42 RBI. Overall in 1997, McGwire led the majors with 58 home runs. He also finished third in the major leagues in slugging percentage (.646), fourth in OPS (1.039), fifth in OPS+ (170), tenth in RBI (123), and ninth in walks (101). He placed 16th in the NL MVP voting.\n\nIt was the last year of his contract, so there was speculation that McGwire would play for the Cardinals only for the remainder of the season, then seek a long-term deal, possibly in Southern California, where he still lived; however, McGwire signed a contract to stay in St. Louis. It is also believed that McGwire later encouraged [[Jim Edmonds]], another Southern California resident who was traded to St. Louis, to forgo free agency and sign a contract with the Cardinals in 2000.\n\n====Single-season home run record chase (1998)====\n\nAs the [[1998 St. Louis Cardinals season|1998 season]] progressed, it became clear that McGwire, [[1998 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] outfielder [[Ken Griffey Jr.]], and [[1998 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] outfielder [[Sammy Sosa]] were all on track to break [[Roger Maris]]'s single-season home run record. [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|The race to break the record]] first attracted media attention as the home run leader changed often throughout the season. On August 19, Sosa hit his 48th home run to move ahead of McGwire; however, later that day McGwire hit his 48th and 49th home runs to regain the lead.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOn September 8, 1998, McGwire hit a pitch by the Cubs' [[Steve Trachsel]] over the left field wall for his record-breaking 62nd home run, setting off massive celebrations at [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]]. The fact that the game was against the Cubs meant that Sosa was able to congratulate McGwire personally on his achievement. Members of Maris's family were also present at the game. The ball was freely, albeit controversially, given to McGwire in a ceremony on the field by the stadium worker who found it.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nMcGwire finished the 1998 season with 70 home runs (including five in his last three games), four ahead of Sosa's 66, a record that was broken three seasons later in 2001 by [[Barry Bonds]] with 73.<ref name=Bonds-testified/>\n\nMcGwire was honored with the inaugural [[Babe Ruth Home Run Award]] for leading Major League Baseball in home runs.<ref name=harber>{{cite news|last=Harber|first=Paul|title=A statue fit for a home run king|date=July 22, 2001|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8659756.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602104753/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8659756.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 2, 2013|accessdate=November 8, 2011|quote=The first award was given to Mark McGwire after his 70-home-run season in 1998.}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Although McGwire had the prestige of the home run record, Sammy Sosa (who had fewer HR but more RBI and stolen bases) won the 1998 NL MVP award, as his contributions helped propel the Cubs to the [[1998 National League Division Series|playoffs]] (the [[1998 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] in 1998 finished third in the NL Central). Many credited the Sosa-McGwire home run chase in 1998 with \"saving baseball\", by both bringing in new, younger fans and bringing back old fans soured by the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/30/sports/myth-of-men-who-saved-baseball.html|title=Myth of men who saved baseball|date=March 30, 2005|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\n====Later playing career (1999\u20132001)====\nMcGwire kept his high level of offensive production from 1998 going in [[1999 St. Louis Cardinals season|1999]] while setting or extending several significant records. For the fourth consecutive season, he led MLB in home runs with 65. It was also his fourth consecutive season with at least 50 home runs, extending his own major league record. Sosa, who hit 63 home runs in 1999, again trailed McGwire. Thus, they became the first, and still only, players in major league history to hit 60 or more home runs in consecutive seasons. McGwire also set a record from 1998 to 1999 for home runs in a two-season period with 135. Further, he owned the highest four-season HR total, with 245 from 1996 to 1999.
