Although Carpenter has worked with various movie [[genres]], he is associated most commonly with [[horror film|horror]], [[action film|action]], and [[science fiction film]]s of the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/movies/john-carpenter-directs-the-ward.html|title=A Lord of Fright Reclaims His Dark Domain|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Jason Zinoman|date=June 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMost films of Carpenter's career were initially commercial and critical failures, with the notable exceptions of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), ''[[The Fog]]'' (1980), ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981), and ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]'' (1984). However, many of Carpenter's films from the 1970s and the 1980s have come to be considered as [[Cult film|cult classics]], and he has been acknowledged as an influential filmmaker. The cult classics that Carpenter has directed include ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'' (1974), ''[[Assault on Precinct 13 (1976 film)|Assault on Precinct 13]]'' (1976), ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982), ''[[Christine (1983 film)|Christine]]'' (1983), ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986), ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'' (1987), ''[[They Live]]'' (1988), and ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'' (1995). He returned to the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' franchise]] as both composer and executive producer for the horror sequel ''[[Halloween (2018 film)|Halloween]]'' (2018).\n\nCarpenter composed or co-composed most of his films' music. He won a [[Saturn Award for Best Music]] for the film ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998). Carpenter has released three studio albums, titled ''[[Lost Themes]]'' (2015), ''[[Lost Themes II]]'' (2016), and ''[[Anthology: Movie Themes 1974\u20131998]]'' (2017).\n\n==Early life==\nCarpenter was born on January 16, 1948 in [[Carthage, New York]], the son of Milton Jean (''n\u00e9e'' Carter) and Howard Ralph Carpenter, a music professor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/70/John-Carpenter.html|work=Film Reference|title=John Carpenter Biography (1948\u2013)}}</ref> He and his family relocated to [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]] during 1953.<ref name=kye>{{cite book |editor=Kleber, John E. |others=Associate editors: [[Thomas D.

The film reportedly cost only $60,000 and was difficult to make as both Carpenter and O'Bannon completed the film by multitasking, with Carpenter doing the musical score as well as the writing, producing, and directing, while O'Bannon acted in the film and did the special effects (which caught the attention of [[George Lucas]] who hired him to work with the special effects for the film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'').

As with ''Dark Star'', Carpenter was responsible for many aspects of the film's creation. He not only wrote, directed, and scored it, but also edited the film using the pseudonym \"John T. Chance\" (the name of [[John Wayne]]'s character in ''Rio Bravo'').

As also stated in the 2009 documentary ''Clarkworld'' (written and directed by Clark's former production designer Deren Abram after Clark's tragic death in 2007), Carpenter directly asked Clark about  his thoughts on developing the anonymous slasher in '' Black Christmas'': \n{{quote|...I did a film about three years later, started a film with John Carpenter, it was his first film for Warner Bros. (which picked up 'Black Christmas'), he asked me if I was ever gonna do a sequel and I said no. I was through with horror, I didn't come into the business to do just horror. He said, \"Well what would you do if you did do a sequel?\" I said it would be the next year and the guy would have actually been caught, escape from a mental institution, go back to the house and they would start all over again. And I would call it 'Halloween'. The truth is John didn't copy 'Black Christmas', he wrote a script, directed the script, did the casting. 'Halloween' is his movie and besides, the script came to him already titled anyway. He liked 'Black Christmas' and may have been influenced by it, but in no way did John Carpenter copy the idea.

After viewing a rough cut of the film, he was dissatisfied with the result. For the only time in his filmmaking career, he had to devise a way to salvage a nearly finished film that did not meet his standards. In order to make the film more coherent and frightening, Carpenter filmed additional footage that included a number of new scenes.\n\nDespite production problems and mostly negative critical reception, ''The Fog'' was another commercial success for Carpenter.

''The Thing'' was distributed by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\nAlthough Carpenter's film used the same source material as the 1951 Howard Hawks film, ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'', it is more faithful to the [[John W. Campbell, Jr.]] novella, ''[[Who Goes There?]]'', upon which both films were based. Moreover, unlike the Hawks film, ''The Thing'' was part of what Carpenter later called his \"Apocalypse Trilogy,\" a trio of films (''The Thing'', ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'', and ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'') with bleak endings for the film's characters.

Also notable from this decade are ''[[Body Bags (film)|Body Bags]]'', a television horror anthology film that was made in collaboration with [[Tobe Hooper]], ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'' (1995), yet another Lovecraftian homage, which did not do well either commercially or with critics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/in_the_mouth_of_madness/ |title=In the Mouth of Madness |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> but now has a cult following,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/12/05/in-the-mouth-of-john-carpenters-misunderstood-masterpiece/ | title=In the Mouth of John Carpenter's Misunderstood Masterpiece | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date=December 5, 2014 | accessdate=November 20, 2016 | author=Calia, Michael}}</ref> and ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998), which featured [[James Woods]] as the leader of a band of vampire hunters in league with the Catholic Church.\n\nCarpenter was originally in consideration to be the director for the ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978) sequel project, ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' (1998). Since [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], the main actress from the original and the sequel ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' (1981), wanted to reunite the cast and crew of the original film, she asked Carpenter to direct ''Halloween H20: 20 Years Later''. Carpenter agreed to direct the film, but his starting fee as director was $10 million. Carpenter rationalized this by believing the hefty fee was compensation for revenue he had never received from the original ''Halloween'', a matter that was still a contention between Carpenter and ''Halloween'' producer [[Moustapha Akkad]] even after twenty years. When Akkad balked at Carpenter's fee, Carpenter quit the project. [[Steve Miner]] assumed directing of ''Halloween H20: 20 Years Later'', which was a commercial success despite receiving mixed reviews.\n\nDuring 1998, Carpenter composed the soundtrack (titled \"Earth/Air\") for the [[video game]] ''[[Sentinel Returns]]'', published for [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bestwesterngamesoundtracks.com/soundtracks/sentinel-returns-soundtrack/|title=Sentinel Returns Soundtrack \u2013 Review|date=May 14, 2015|website=Bestwesterngamessoundtracks.com|accessdate=December 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2000s: Semi-retirement===\n[[File:JohnCarpenter01.jpg|thumb|right|Carpenter in September 2001]]\nIn 2001, the film ''[[Ghosts of Mars]]'' was released. During 2005, there were remakes of ''Assault on Precinct 13'' and ''The Fog'', the latter being produced by Carpenter himself, though in an interview he defined his involvement as, \"I come in and say hello to everybody. Go home.\"\n\nDuring 2007, [[Rob Zombie]] produced and directed ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]'', a re-imagining of Carpenter's 1978 film that resulted in a [[Halloween II (2009 film)|sequel]] two years later.\n\nCarpenter worked as director during 2005 for an episode of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime's]] ''[[Masters of Horror]]'' television series as one of the thirteen filmmakers involved in the first season. His episode, \"[[John Carpenter's Cigarette Burns|Cigarette Burns]]\", received generally positive reviews, and positive reactions from Carpenter fans, many of whom regard it as on par with his earlier horror classics. He has since contributed another original episode for the show's second season entitled \"[[Pro-Life (Masters of Horror)|Pro-Life]]\", about a young girl who is raped and impregnated by a demon and wants to have an abortion, but whose efforts are halted by her religious fanatic, gun-toting father and her three brothers.\n\n===2010s: ''The Ward'', focus on music and return to ''Halloween''===\n''[[The Ward (film)|The Ward]]'', Carpenter's first film since 2001's ''[[Ghosts of Mars]]'', premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 13, 2010.

Although Carpenter has worked with various movie [[genres]], he is associated most commonly with [[horror film|horror]], [[action film|action]], and [[science fiction film]]s of the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/movies/john-carpenter-directs-the-ward.html|title=A Lord of Fright Reclaims His Dark Domain|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Jason Zinoman|date=June 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMost films of Carpenter's career were initially commercial and critical failures, with the notable exceptions of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), ''[[The Fog]]'' (1980), ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981), and ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]'' (1984). However, many of Carpenter's films from the 1970s and the 1980s have come to be considered as [[Cult film|cult classics]], and he has been acknowledged as an influential filmmaker. The cult classics that Carpenter has directed include ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'' (1974), ''[[Assault on Precinct 13 (1976 film)|Assault on Precinct 13]]'' (1976), ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982), ''[[Christine (1983 film)|Christine]]'' (1983), ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986), ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'' (1987), ''[[They Live]]'' (1988), and ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'' (1995). He returned to the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' franchise]] as both composer and executive producer for the horror sequel ''[[Halloween (2018 film)|Halloween]]'' (2018).\n\nCarpenter composed or co-composed most of his films' music. He won a [[Saturn Award for Best Music]] for the film ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998). Carpenter has released three studio albums, titled ''[[Lost Themes]]'' (2015), ''[[Lost Themes II]]'' (2016), and ''[[Anthology: Movie Themes 1974\u20131998]]'' (2017).\n\n==Early life==\nCarpenter was born on January 16, 1948 in [[Carthage, New York]], the son of Milton Jean (''n\u00e9e'' Carter) and Howard Ralph Carpenter, a music professor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/70/John-Carpenter.html|work=Film Reference|title=John Carpenter Biography (1948\u2013)}}</ref> He and his family relocated to [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]] during 1953.<ref name=kye>{{cite book |editor=Kleber, John E. |others=Associate editors: [[Thomas D.

The film was rediscovered in the USC archives in 2011 and proved interesting because it revealed elements that would appear in his later film, ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/john-carpenter-halloween-student-film-captain-voyeur-253747 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Mike | last=Barnes | title='Halloween' Director John Carpenter's First Student Film Unearthed | date=October 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe next year he collaborated with producer [[John Longenecker]] as co-writer, film editor, and music composer for ''[[The Resurrection of Broncho Billy]]'' (1970), which won an [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film]]. The short film was enlarged to [[35 mm movie film|35 mm]], sixty prints were made, and the film was released theatrically by Universal Studios for two years in the United States and Canada.\n\n===1970s: From student films to theatrical releases===\nCarpenter's first major film as director, ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'' (1974), was a science fiction comedy that he cowrote with [[Dan O'Bannon]] (who later went on to write ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', borrowing freely from much of ''Dark Star''). The film reportedly cost only $60,000 and was difficult to make as both Carpenter and O'Bannon completed the film by multitasking, with Carpenter doing the musical score as well as the writing, producing, and directing, while O'Bannon acted in the film and did the special effects (which caught the attention of [[George Lucas]] who hired him to work with the special effects for the film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'').

As with ''Dark Star'', Carpenter was responsible for many aspects of the film's creation. He not only wrote, directed, and scored it, but also edited the film using the pseudonym \"John T. Chance\" (the name of [[John Wayne]]'s character in ''Rio Bravo''). Carpenter has said that he considers ''Assault on Precinct 13'' to have been his first real film because it was the first film that he filmed on a schedule.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldwasser |first=Dan |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/features/article/?id=12 |title=John Carpenter \u2013 Interview |publisher=Soundtrack.net |date=May 9, 2012 |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> The film was the first time Carpenter worked with [[Debra Hill]], who played prominently in the making of some of Carpenter's most important films.\n\nCarpenter assembled a main cast that consisted of experienced but relatively obscure actors. The two main actors were [[Austin Stoker]], who had appeared previously in science fiction, disaster, and [[blaxploitation]] films, and [[Darwin Joston]], who had worked primarily for television and had once been Carpenter's next-door neighbor.<ref>Q & A session with John Carpenter and Austin Stoker at American Cinematheque's 2002 John Carpenter retrospective, in the ''Assault on Precinct 13'' 2003 special edition DVD.</ref>\n\nThe film received a critical reassessment in the United States, where it is now generally regarded as one of the best [[exploitation film]]s of the 1970s.<ref name=stills>Production Gallery (included in the 2003 special edition Region 1 DVD of ''Assault on Precinct 13''). 2003.</ref>\n\nCarpenter both wrote and directed the Lauren Hutton thriller ''[[Someone's Watching Me!]]''.

Originally an idea suggested by producer [[Irwin Yablans]] (titled ''The Babysitter Murders''), who thought of a film about babysitters being menaced by a stalker, Carpenter took the idea and another suggestion from Yablans that it occur during Halloween and developed a story.<ref name=\"scifi1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue339/interview.html |title=Syfy \u2013 Watch Full Episodes &#124; Imagine Greater |publisher=Scifi.com |date= |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> Carpenter said of the basic concept: \"Halloween night.

As also stated in the 2009 documentary ''Clarkworld'' (written and directed by Clark's former production designer Deren Abram after Clark's tragic death in 2007), Carpenter directly asked Clark about  his thoughts on developing the anonymous slasher in '' Black Christmas'': \n{{quote|...I did a film about three years later, started a film with John Carpenter, it was his first film for Warner Bros. (which picked up 'Black Christmas'), he asked me if I was ever gonna do a sequel and I said no. I was through with horror, I didn't come into the business to do just horror. He said, \"Well what would you do if you did do a sequel?\" I said it would be the next year and the guy would have actually been caught, escape from a mental institution, go back to the house and they would start all over again. And I would call it 'Halloween'. The truth is John didn't copy 'Black Christmas', he wrote a script, directed the script, did the casting. 'Halloween' is his movie and besides, the script came to him already titled anyway. He liked 'Black Christmas' and may have been influenced by it, but in no way did John Carpenter copy the idea. Fifteen other people at that time had thought to do a movie called 'Halloween' but the script came to John with that title on it.\n\n|author = Bob Clark, 2005\n|source = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iconsoffright.com/IV_BClark.htm|title=Bob Clark Interview |date=May 2005 |accessdate=February 22, 2020 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222200805/http://www.iconsoffright.com/IV_BClark.htm |archivedate=February 22, 2020 }}</ref>}} \nThe film was written by Carpenter and Debra Hill with Carpenter admitting that the music was inspired by both [[Dario Argento]]'s ''[[Suspiria]]'' (which also influenced the film's slightly surreal color scheme) and [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''.<ref name=\"theofficialjohncarpenter.com\"/>\n\nCarpenter again worked with a relatively small budget, $300,000.<ref>Audio commentary by John Carpenter and Debra Hill in ''The Fog'', 2002 special edition DVD</ref> The film grossed more than $65 million initially, making it one of the most successful [[independent films]] of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houseofhorrors.com/halloween.htm |title=Halloween |publisher=Houseofhorrors.com |date= |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nCarpenter has described ''Halloween'' as: \"True crass exploitation.

After viewing a rough cut of the film, he was dissatisfied with the result. For the only time in his filmmaking career, he had to devise a way to salvage a nearly finished film that did not meet his standards. In order to make the film more coherent and frightening, Carpenter filmed additional footage that included a number of new scenes.\n\nDespite production problems and mostly negative critical reception, ''The Fog'' was another commercial success for Carpenter. The film was made on a budget of $1,000,000,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/rollingstone790628.html |title='THE FOG': A SPOOK RIDE ON FILM |access-date=March 16, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228140340/http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/rollingstone790628.html |archive-date=February 28, 2015 |magazine= Rolling Stone | via = theofficialjohncarpenter.com }}</ref> but it grossed over $21,000,000 in the United States alone. Carpenter has said that ''The Fog'' is not his favorite film, although he considers it a \"minor horror classic\".<ref name=\"Audio\"/>\n\nCarpenter immediately followed ''The Fog'' with the science-fiction adventure ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981).

''The Thing'' was distributed by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\nAlthough Carpenter's film used the same source material as the 1951 Howard Hawks film, ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'', it is more faithful to the [[John W. Campbell, Jr.]] novella, ''[[Who Goes There?]]'', upon which both films were based. Moreover, unlike the Hawks film, ''The Thing'' was part of what Carpenter later called his \"Apocalypse Trilogy,\" a trio of films (''The Thing'', ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'', and ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'') with bleak endings for the film's characters.

Salkind made the offer to Carpenter during lunch at The Ritz, and while he loved the idea of differing from his normal traditions and directing a children's fantasy film, he requested 24 hours to think about the offer. The next day he had made a list of requirements should he direct the film; they were: 100 percent creative control, the right to assume scriptwriting duties, being able to co-compose the film's musical score, total editorial control, the casting of [[Brian Dennehy]] as Santa Claus and a $5 million signing-on fee (the same amount that the film's star [[Dudley Moore]] was receiving). Salkind withdrew his offer for him to direct.\n\nAfter the financial failure of his big-budget action\u2013comedy ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986), Carpenter struggled to get films financed. He resumed making lower budget films such as ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'' (1987), a film influenced by the [[BBC]] series ''[[Quatermass]]''. Although some of the films from this time, such as ''[[They Live]]'' (1988) did develop a cult audience, he never again realized mass-market potential.\n\nCarpenter was also offered ''[[The Exorcist III]]'' during 1989, and met with writer [[William Peter Blatty]] (who also authored the novel on which it was based, ''[[Legion (Blatty novel)|Legion]]'') during the course of a week.

Also notable from this decade are ''[[Body Bags (film)|Body Bags]]'', a television horror anthology film that was made in collaboration with [[Tobe Hooper]], ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'' (1995), yet another Lovecraftian homage, which did not do well either commercially or with critics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/in_the_mouth_of_madness/ |title=In the Mouth of Madness |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> but now has a cult following,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/12/05/in-the-mouth-of-john-carpenters-misunderstood-masterpiece/ | title=In the Mouth of John Carpenter's Misunderstood Masterpiece | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date=December 5, 2014 | accessdate=November 20, 2016 | author=Calia, Michael}}</ref> and ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998), which featured [[James Woods]] as the leader of a band of vampire hunters in league with the Catholic Church.\n\nCarpenter was originally in consideration to be the director for the ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978) sequel project, ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' (1998). Since [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], the main actress from the original and the sequel ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' (1981), wanted to reunite the cast and crew of the original film, she asked Carpenter to direct ''Halloween H20: 20 Years Later''. Carpenter agreed to direct the film, but his starting fee as director was $10 million. Carpenter rationalized this by believing the hefty fee was compensation for revenue he had never received from the original ''Halloween'', a matter that was still a contention between Carpenter and ''Halloween'' producer [[Moustapha Akkad]] even after twenty years. When Akkad balked at Carpenter's fee, Carpenter quit the project. [[Steve Miner]] assumed directing of ''Halloween H20: 20 Years Later'', which was a commercial success despite receiving mixed reviews.\n\nDuring 1998, Carpenter composed the soundtrack (titled \"Earth/Air\") for the [[video game]] ''[[Sentinel Returns]]'', published for [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bestwesterngamesoundtracks.com/soundtracks/sentinel-returns-soundtrack/|title=Sentinel Returns Soundtrack \u2013 Review|date=May 14, 2015|website=Bestwesterngamessoundtracks.com|accessdate=December 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2000s: Semi-retirement===\n[[File:JohnCarpenter01.jpg|thumb|right|Carpenter in September 2001]]\nIn 2001, the film ''[[Ghosts of Mars]]'' was released.

Go home.\"\n\nDuring 2007, [[Rob Zombie]] produced and directed ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]'', a re-imagining of Carpenter's 1978 film that resulted in a [[Halloween II (2009 film)|sequel]] two years later.\n\nCarpenter worked as director during 2005 for an episode of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime's]] ''[[Masters of Horror]]'' television series as one of the thirteen filmmakers involved in the first season. His episode, \"[[John Carpenter's Cigarette Burns|Cigarette Burns]]\", received generally positive reviews, and positive reactions from Carpenter fans, many of whom regard it as on par with his earlier horror classics. He has since contributed another original episode for the show's second season entitled \"[[Pro-Life (Masters of Horror)|Pro-Life]]\", about a young girl who is raped and impregnated by a demon and wants to have an abortion, but whose efforts are halted by her religious fanatic, gun-toting father and her three brothers.\n\n===2010s: ''The Ward'', focus on music and return to ''Halloween''===\n''[[The Ward (film)|The Ward]]'', Carpenter's first film since 2001's ''[[Ghosts of Mars]]'', premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 13, 2010.

It was a first-round [[2010 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|Men's Singles]] match, in which the American 23rd seed [[John Isner]] played French [[Glossary of tennis#Qualifier|qualifier]] [[Nicolas Mahut]].  The match began at 6:13 pm ([[British Summer Time]], or 17:13 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on Tuesday, {{Nowrap|22 June}} 2010, on Court 18 at Wimbledon.  At {{Nowrap|9:07 pm}}, due to fading light, play was suspended before the start of the fifth set. After resuming on Wednesday, 23 June, at {{Nowrap|2:05 pm}}, the record for longest match was broken at {{Nowrap|5:45 pm}}.  The light faded again, and so play was suspended at {{Nowrap|9:09 pm}}, with the final set tied at 59 games all. Play resumed at {{Nowrap|3:40 pm}} on Thursday, 24 June, and Isner won at {{Nowrap|4:47 pm}}, the final set having lasted 8 hours, 11 minutes.\n\nIn total, the match took 11 hours, 5 minutes<ref>https://www.cnn.com/2015/06/29/tennis/wimbledon-isner-mahut-tennis/index.html</ref> of play over three days, with a final score of 6\u20134, 3\u20136, 6\u20137<sup>(7\u20139)</sup>, 7\u20136<sup>(7\u20133)</sup>, 70\u201368 for a total of 183 games.  It remains by far the [[longest tennis match records|longest match in tennis history]], measured both by time and number of games.  The final set alone was longer than the previous longest match.\n\nBoth players broke numerous Wimbledon and [[Longest tennis match records|tennis records]], including each serving over 100 [[ace (tennis)|ace]]s, with the match being referred to as \"the endless match\".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Match That Wouldn't End: John Isner Finally Defeats Nicolas Mahut In Epic Fifth-Set Wimbledon Marathon, 70\u201368|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2010/6/23/1531425/wimbledon-2010-wednesday-day-3-preview-schedule-tv|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref> A rule change instituted for the [[2019 Wimbledon Championships|2019 Championships]] introducing a tie break in the fifth set [or 3rd set for women's singles/doubles (all genders)] means that the Isner\u2013Mahut match will remain the longest match in Wimbledon tournament history in terms of games played, provided this change remains in place.\n\nCurrently, the [[French Open]] is the only Grand Slam tournament that still has no tiebreaker system for the deciding set.\n\n==Background==\nThe match took place during the [[2010 Wimbledon Championships|2010 edition]] of the 13-day Wimbledon Championships, held every June and July. Mahut, who was not ranked high enough to qualify for the tournament automatically, earned his place by winning in the qualifying pre-tournament, where he was [[Seed (tennis)|seeded]] 27th. He played three qualification rounds, beating [[Frank Dancevic]] 6\u20133, 6\u20130, in the first round, then [[Alex Bogdanovic]] 3\u20136, 6\u20133, 24\u201322, and finally [[Stefan Koubek]] in five sets, 6\u20137(8), 3\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20134, 6\u20134.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon 2010 Gentlemen's Qualifying Singles|url=http://2010.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/draws/qs/qsdraw.pdf|work=2010.wimbledon.org|accessdate=27 October 2010}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nHaving played through the qualifying stage, Mahut was [[2010 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles#Section 8|drawn against]] Isner in the first round of Gentlemen's Singles.

As in all men's [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] matches, the match was played as [[Tennis score|best of five sets]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Official Grand Slam Rulebook|url=http://www.itftennis.com/shared/medialibrary/pdf/original/io_46486_original.pdf|publisher=ITF|accessdate=11 January 2013}}</ref> While in the first four [[set (tennis)|sets]] of a match a  [[tiebreak (tennis)|tiebreaker]] is used to decide a tied set, this did not apply in the fifth set, in 2010, except at the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. Thus, in the event of a tie in the fifth set, the players continue to play the set until one of them is leading by two [[game (tennis)|games]].\n\nThe first four sets passed without significant incident. Isner won the first set 6\u20134, breaking Mahut's serve in the ninth game of the set after Mahut had twice double faulted. Mahut took the second set 6\u20133, having broken Isner's serve to love in the second game of the set. The third and fourth sets had no breaks of serve and were both decided by tiebreaks, with Mahut winning the third set tiebreak 9\u20137, and Isner winning the fourth set tiebreak 7\u20133, leaving the score at two sets each. At the end of the fourth set, the match was halted due to darkness.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1289016/Nicolas-Mahut-John-Isner-break-Wimbledon-record-match-lasting-SEVEN-hours.html|title=The longest game: Men's singles match breaks Wimbledon record by lasting almost TEN hours (and it'll carry on tomorrow)|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=23 June 2010|work=[[Daily Mail]]|location=London}}</ref>\n\nResuming on {{Nowrap|23 June}}, it soon became the longest match ever. Isner failed to convert four match points on this day, the first when Mahut was serving at 9\u201310, the second and third when Mahut was serving at 32\u201333, and the fourth in the dramatic last game that they played at 58\u201359 on {{Nowrap|23 June}}, with Mahut initially serving up 40\u201315 for the hold. Mahut also failed to convert two break points on Isner's serve, at 50\u201350. The match was suspended for a second time because of darkness on the evening of {{Nowrap|23 June}} at 59\u201359 in the fifth set despite chants of \"We want more, we want more\" from the spectators.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-49587820100623 |title=Isner-Mahut epic leaves Wimbledon lost for words &#124; Reuters |publisher=In.reuters.com |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nIsner drank a \"[[sports drink|recovery shake]]\" and took an [[cryotherapy|ice bath]]. Fellow American [[Andy Roddick]] brought [[take-out|take-out food]] for him and his coach, including \"three boxes of pizza, all sorts of chicken and mashed potatoes\"; Isner said later that he was so hungry he could have eaten \"12 Big Macs\",<ref name=\"atkin20100624\"/> but reported that drinking coconut water helped him [[Fluid replacement|rehydrate]] and avoid the [[cramping]] that he had experienced in the past.<ref name=\"pucin20100625\">Pucin, Diane. \"[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2010/06/wimbledon-no-doubles-for-isner-but-props-for-coconut-water.html Wimbledon: No doubles for John Isner but props for coconut water]\" ''Los Angeles Times'', 25 June 2010.</ref> He slept for less than four hours before arising.

With Isner serving at 68\u201368, Mahut went up 0\u201330, but Isner won 4 points in a row to hold serve. At 68\u201369, with Mahut serving at 15\u201315, Mahut netted a [[drop shot]] that would likely have won the point. Isner, far back in the court at the time, later said that he would not have had the energy to chase after that shot. At 30\u201330, Isner passed Mahut at the net with a difficult inside-out forehand from the middle of the court that landed just inside the line.

With Isner serving at 68\u201368, Mahut went up 0\u201330, but Isner won 4 points in a row to hold serve. At 68\u201369, with Mahut serving at 15\u201315, Mahut netted a [[drop shot]] that would likely have won the point. Isner, far back in the court at the time, later said that he would not have had the energy to chase after that shot.

It is the capital of [[Konin County]] and is located within the [[Greater Poland Voivodeship]]. Prior to 1999, it was the capital of the [[Konin Voivodeship]] (1975\u20131998). In 2018, the population of the city was 74,151 making it the third-largest city in Greater Poland after [[Pozna\u0144]] and [[Kalisz]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===Prehistory===\nThe earliest evidence of human habitation in Konin has been dated to the [[Paleolithic|Paleolithic Era]]. On the dunes near the Warta, various ancient flint tools and implements have been found, among them being knives, burins, and tanged points. These earliest artifacts are of the [[Swiderian culture]] (''Kultura \u015awiderska'') of 9000\u20138000 BC.\n\n===Ancient times===\nA permanent settlement arose along the [[Amber Road]], which led from the [[Roman Empire]] to the [[Baltic Sea]], traversing the area of present-day Konin.  A map drawn by [[Ptolemy]] identified the settlement as ''[[Setidava]]'' (or ''Getidava''), a probable spot to wade across the Warta and containing an [[Marketplace|emporium]] of some importance to merchants travelling along the route.<ref name=\"Krzysztof Gorczyca\">Krzysztof orczyca, ''Kalisz-Konin on The Amber Route''</ref>  The settlement's primary burial ground, situated on the dunes west of the centre of today's Konin, dates back to the [[Przeworsk culture]] (''Kultura Przeworska'') of the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Konin - Milestone 01.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The Stone Signpost of Konin is the oldest European signpost beyond the boundaries of the former [[Roman Empire]]]]\nToward the end of the [[early Middle Ages]], Gr\u00f3d Kaszuba was the most significant of the fortified settlements near present-day Konin. Inhabited from the 10th through 12th centuries, Gr\u00f3d Kaszuba was situated on the meadows near the Warta.  Its abandonment was likely a consequence of floods which damaged its fortifications.  The remains of Gr\u00f3d Kaszuba are visible on the south bank of the river.\n\nDuring the 12th and 13th centuries, in the [[high Middle Ages|high]] to [[late Middle Ages]], a complex of settlements was centred on the location of today's [[Stare Miasto, Konin County|''Stare Miasto'']], where there existed a large settlement named Konin and a market place and a church built of [[sandstone]].  (The name ''Stare Miasto'' first appeared in use later, after Konin had been reestablished elsewhere.) What remains from that time is SS Peter and Paul's Parish Church, with its magnificent carved portal and a solar clock on the south wall, perhaps the oldest solar clock in [[Greater Poland]]. In 1331, the settlement was plundered and burnt by the [[Teutonic Knights]].  What remained was soon abandoned and the town of Konin was reestablished, six kilometres ({{convert|6|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) to the northeast, in the more defensible spot where the Old Town of Konin is situated today. [[File:Gos\u0142awice-rural architecture in open-air museum.jpg|thumb|220px|Gos\u0142awice district: Rural architecture, reflected in an open-air museum]]\n\nSince the 13th century, Konin has been situated on the marshy grounds of an island within a ford of the Warta River. The oldest available written work confirming the location of the town is associated with Gos\u0142aw, the chief officer of a group of settlers, and was recorded in 1293. The town may have been chartered by the Duke of [[Duchy of Greater Poland|Greater Poland]], [[Przemys\u0142 II]], who visited Konin in 1284 and 1292.  At that time, the town's north-south axis equalled 430 meters, while its east-west axis equalled 210 meters. Also, the town's area was eight hectares, and its circumference was 1100 meters. By the standards of the time, Konin was a town of medium size.<ref>Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz, ''Wojew\u00f3dztwo koni\u0144skie - szkic monograficzny'', p.82</ref>\n[[File:Konin - St Bartholomew's parish church.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]-[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] St Bartholomew's Church]]\nKonin's significance grew during the 14th century. Records from that era indicate that Konin possessed a ''[[Castellan]]'', an office of significance in feudal Poland, and one which only the oldest towns in the country were granted. At approximately the midpoint of the century, Konin became the judicial seat of the Kalisz Voivodeship and functioned under the authority of a ''[[Starost]]''. There may have also been a school in Konin at the time, as a student from Konin is listed in a 14th-century record of the [[Charles University in Prague]].<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.83\">Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz, ''Wojew\u00f3dztwo koni\u0144skie - szkic monograficzny'', p.83</ref>\n\nThe second half of the 14th century and the entire 15th are believed to have been a period of rapid development for Konin. During the reign of the Polish King [[Casimir III the Great]] (1310\u20131370), a [[Konin#Castles|king's castle]] was erected in Konin and the town was encircled with walls and a moat, marking the beginning of Konin as a king's town<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.83\"/> Later, King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] (1351/52 - 1434) was a guest of Konin, visiting in the years of 1403, 1425, and 1433. (W\u0142adys\u0142aw engineered an historic debilitation of the political and military power of the Teutonic Knights by means of his Polish-Lithuanian victory at the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410.) His last stay at Konin, in 1433, was his longest.  Throughout that year's summer, he resided in the town's castle, obtaining reports on a Polish retaliatory strike against the Knights.\n\nIn 1458, during the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)]] against the [[Teutonic Order]], there was a call for military recruitment throughout Poland. Every Polish town was bound to put up a quantity of soldiers, the number of which was a sign of the size and power of a given town. With regard to Konin, it was 15 infantrymen; by comparison, [[Pozna\u0144]], the capital of Greater Poland, was bound to put up 60, while [[Kalisz]], nearby [[S\u0142upca]] and [[K\u0142odawa]], and [[Ko\u0142o]] were to provide 30, 20, 20, and 15 men, respectively.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.84\">Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz, ''Wojew\u00f3dztwo koni\u0144skie - szkic monograficzny'', p.84</ref>  These quantities suggest that Konin was still a town of medium size. Notwithstanding, the town continued its development of handicraft trades and enlarged the area of its Starosty District. In 1425, Konin was granted a charter to conduct two fairs each year.\n\n===Renaissance===\nThe 16th century, the period of [[Polish Golden Age|Poland's golden age]], was a time of significant economic, political, military, cultural, and territorial growth. In 1504, the village of Kur\u00f3w, located on the river bank opposite the main body of Konin, was incorporated into the town.  Furthermore, a description of the town, written in 1557, lists a brickyard and a mill as well as eight butchers, 14 bakers, 21 shoemakers, and four fishermen.  However, Konin may have been one of the smaller towns of the time in eastern Greater Poland, based on its \"Szos,\" the tax assessed on its earnings and the possessions of its townspeople.  Konin was obliged to pay 32 zlotych, while Pozna\u0144 (the capital of Greater Poland) was assessed 1400 zlotych; Kalisz, 230; nearby S\u0142upca, 96; and both Ko\u0142o and [[Pyzdry]], 64.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.85\">Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz, ''Wojew\u00f3dztwo koni\u0144skie - szkic monograficzny'', p.85</ref>\n\nConcerning religious matters and the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the starost of Konin, [[Jakub Ostror\u00f3g]], was a notable supporter of the apostacy,<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.84\"/> and a local parish-priest, Stanis\u0142aw Lutomirski, played a role in the Reformation in the region surrounding Konin.\n\n===17th century===\nDuring the 17th century, epidemics and war greatly afflicted Konin.  A plague of three years' length (1628-1631) decimated the town's population.  Subsequent efforts to revitalize Konin included King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV]]'s 1646 proclamation, confirming the town's right to conduct two fairs annually and promoting participation in those events by offering military protection to merchants who attended them, and a 1652 edict of the Starost, licensing the [[Scotland|Scottish]] community of Konin to erect breweries.  Thereafter, the town was invaded and occupied by the [[Swedish Army]] in 1656 during the [[Second Northern War]] ([[Swedish Deluge|The Deluge]]),<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.85\"/>  suffering extensive damage (see [[Konin#Castles|''Castles'']] and [[Konin#Ancient town walls|''Ancient town walls'']]) and a reduction in the number of its houses, from 127 prior to the war to 25 in 1659 .<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.85\"/>  By war's end, the town's population had been reduced to not more than 200 persons.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.85\"/> Another plague occurred shortly afterward, in 1662.\n\n===18th century===\nThe 18th century began with the turmoil of the [[Great Northern War]], during which Konin was so severely devastated, in 1707, that its restoration required the remainder of the century to complete.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.85\"/>  The second half of the century was a time of advanced crisis for the nation, as an irreversible decline of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] culminated in the [[Partitions of Poland]] and the loss of national independence. Poland's territory was occupied and divided among three bordering countries - [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] - in three stages, occurring in the years of 1772, 1793 and 1795.\n\nAs a consequence of the [[Second Partition of Poland|second partition]], Konin was incorporated into Prussia, ending Konin's status as a [[royal town in Poland|royal town]]. At the time, the town's population was 780, with 165 houses, of which only one was made of brick.  Inhabitants earned their living in agriculture and handicrafts. Among craftsmen, there were 22 shoemakers, 13 potters, and eight furriers.  Eight fairs took place each year, together with a round-up of cattle.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.85\"/>  [[Poles]], [[Jews]], [[Germans]] and [[Scottish people|Scots]] were the town's four main ethnic groups.<ref>Edward hr. Raczy\u0144ski, ''Wspomnienia z Wielkopolski'', p.234</ref>  In 1794, Konin joined the first Polish insurrection, the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]]; the act of joining is recorded in the town's books of that period.  Polish insurgents also took control of the town multiple times - e.g., in September 1794, when the town was entered by the soldiers of the corps of [[Jan Henryk D\u0105browski]], the namesake of the [[Polish national anthem]] - the so-called \"D\u0105browski's Mazurka.\" In 1796, the town was damaged by fire.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.86\">Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz, ''Wojew\u00f3dztwo koni\u0144skie - szkic monograficzny'', p.86</ref>\n\n===19th century===\nThe 19th century began with the general, European disorder of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], which neither eastern Greater Poland nor Konin escaped. At the start of the century, the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] was created as a Polish formally independent state, ''[[de facto]]'' dependent upon [[Napoleon I Bonaparte]]. The Napoleonic Wars gave Poles hope of regaining national independence, and they strongly supported Napoleon.  On November 9, 1806, Poles took control of Konin and quickly organized a new, town government. The following year, the town was formally incorporated into the Duchy of Warsaw.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.86\"/>\n[[File:Warta-Gop\u0142o Canal in Konin (1).JPG|thumb|220px|left|Warta-Gop\u0142o Canal]]\n\nThe subsequent collapse of the [[Napoleonic Empire]] resulted in the establishment of a new order in Europe, as well as within the Polish territories, including Konin.  The [[Congress of Vienna]], assembled in 1814-1815 to arrange political changes on the continent, awarded Russia the majority of territories formerly held by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Konin itself was incorporated into Russia as a part of [[Congress Poland]] (formally the ''Kingdom of Poland''), a pseudo-autonomous region that was a Russian dependency and which recognized the [[tzar]] as its ruler. The town was also designated as the capital of a sector within the [[Kalisz Governorate]]; the sector encompassed two counties, Konin County and Pyzdry County. From an administrative standpoint, Konin's sector constituted the westernmost territory of the Russian state.\n\nThe [[November Uprising]] erupted in 1830. Although Konin was not directly involved in this Polish uprising, as with other Polish cities and towns it suffered the political and cultural consequences of its failure.  Those consequences included the denial of higher offices to Poles, the elimination of Polish as the official language, and the systematic [[russification]] of the primary and secondary schools.\n\nThe [[January Uprising]] of 1863 had a greater effect on Konin than had the 1830 rebellion.  As many as several dozen battles and skirmishes took place in and near Konin, to which many present day monuments attest.\n\nFrom 1815 onwards, trade and handicraft activities increased substantially in Konin. A description of the town, from 1820, states that among the 2,456 inhabitants, there were 161 craftsmen, ten merchants, and 42 peasants.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.86\"/> During the course of the century the population of Konin increased steadily, rising from 4,195 people in 1850 to 7,391 in 1896.  In comparison, nearby Ko\u0142o had an 1896 population of 8,800 inhabitants, while [[Turek]]'s population that same year was 9,900.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.86\"/> However, while nearby [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] was becoming one of the most significant [[textile]] industrial centres in the world, only 12 cloth workshops and small factories existed in Konin in 1820.\n\nDuring the 1830s, a general renewal of the town led to the construction of new streets and squares.  Also, building lots were developed for industrial expansion, and dilapidated buildings were demolished.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.86\"/>\n\nBy the end of the century, there were two factories that produced machines and special tools for agriculture - the larger of them belonged to L. Reymond, a citizen of [[Switzerland]], who settled permanently in Konin.  His factory was equipped with a 12 horse-power [[steam engine]] and a [[cast iron]] [[foundry]].  Apart from these enterprises, the town held 18 windmills, four tanneries, four workshops producing soap, three vinegar factories, two small factories producing boilers, two breweries, two oil-mills, a sparkling water factory, and a distillery.<ref>Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz, ''Wojew\u00f3dztwo koni\u0144skie - szkic monograficzny'', p.86-87</ref>\n\n===20th century===\nFor Konin, the early 20th century was a period of rapid development in the fields of culture, education, and social life.  The Musical Society of Kalisz (''Towarzystwo Muzyczne w Kaliszu'') had as many as 72 members in Konin,<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.87\"/> and Konin's Jewish Library was one of the finest within the Gubernya of Kalisz, with a quantity of books and a general readership that significantly exceeded similar libraries in Kalisz, a much larger urban area. Also, a branch of the Rowing Club of Kalisz (''Kaliskie Towarzystwo Wio\u015blarskie'') was founded in Konin in 1908 and, by 1914, had 95 members. Its building, displaying the club's coat of arms, still stands in Old Konin, in Zofii Urbanowskiej Street.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.87\"/>\n\nWorkers' associations were also established in Konin. In 1905, when significant strikes occurred in Polish industrial centres such as [[Warsaw]] and [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]], there were some minor strikes and turmoil in Konin as well.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.87\">Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz, ''Wojew\u00f3dztwo koni\u0144skie - szkic monograficzny'', p.87</ref>\n\nA branch of the Polish gymnastic society, [[Sok\u00f3\u0142]], was founded in Konin.  A quasi-military association,  its objective was to maintain the fitness of teenagers, to improve their health, and to provide for readily trainable military recruits in the event of a possible national uprising or a defense need. Similar Jewish and German associations also existed.\n\nAfter the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, battles between Russian and Prussian troops occurred near Konin.  Ultimately, the city came under Prussian control and deteriorated.  The economic situation of the town did not improve when, in 1918, Poland regained its independence (see: [[Second Polish Republic]]) in the war's aftermath.  Living conditions of residents were still miserable, exacerbated by the lack of functioning water distribution and sewer systems.  The subsequent inter-war economic crisis was harsh, and conditions did not begin to improve until the ''d\u00e9senclavement'' of the town, attributable to the opening of a major railway, between Pozna\u0144 and Warsaw, and the construction of a canal to [[Gop\u0142o|Gop\u0142o Lake]].\n[[File:Konin-egzekucja-22-09-39.jpg|thumb|German soldiers executing Polish hostages in Konin in 1939]]\nJews had represented 30% of Konin's population prior to the [[Second World War]]. During the war, Konin was part of the land annexed by [[Nazi Germany]] (''[[Reichsgau Wartheland]]''). In the town's surrounding forests, the Nazis carried out mass executions of Jews which 95% were killed or send to concentration camps.  In August 1943, the Jews at the labour camp at Konin, led by Rabbi Joshua Moshe Aaronson, burned down the huts in the camp and tried to escape.  Almost all of them were killed.<ref>Martin Gilbert, 'The Holocaust' (1986), pages 597-598</ref>  The town survivors published, in 1968, an extensive \"Yizkor Book\" (803 pages) in memory in the flourishing Jewish community: Mendel Gelbart, ed., Kehilat Konin: Bi-Feri\u1e25atah uve-hurbanah (Tel Aviv). The book was written in Yiddish, Hebrew and English. A descendant of Konin Jews, Theo Richmond, wrote ''Konin: A Quest'', the most extensive history of Jewish life in the town ever to appear in English. The majority of Jews in Konin were [[Mitnagdim]], though two small communities of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] lived within the Konin Jewish community, mostly adherents to [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Gerer Hasidism]], with a small group of [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)|Aleksander Hasidim]].<ref>Theo Richmond, ''Konin'', p.209</ref>\n\n==Jewish community of Konin==\n[[File:Konin - synagogue.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Konin Synagogue]]\nThe first written evidence of Jews settling in Konin dates to 1397. In the 15th century, 180 Jews were counted in the city. Over the course of the 17th century, the number of Jews in the city shrunk as a result of fires, plagues, and restrictions upon Jewish residency. Administratively, the Jews of Konin were subordinate to the larger community in nearby [[Kalisz]] until the end of the 18th century. \n\nA wooden synagogue was built in 1763-1766. The current standing building was built in 1829. The first rabbi in Konin was Rabbi Amsterdam, between 1810-1849.\n[[File:Gos\u0142awice district - Jewish remains in museum.jpg|thumb|200px|Remains of Jewish tombstones]]\nBetween the two world wars, some 3,000 Jews lived in the city, constituting roughly a quarter of its residents. In 1918, the first Jewish [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] was established. The community had a [[beit midrash]], [[mikvaot]], [[synagogues]], a few prayer halls (such as \"Hevra Tehilim\"), active youth movements, a library, a Jewish elementary school and a Jewish high school. During this period, movements such as [[Agudat Yisrael]], the different Zionist parties, and the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|Bund]] were active there. \n\nIn November 1941, 3000 Jews of Konin were murdered by the German SS in the forests of Kaziemesh (Kleczew), north of the city.<ref>Mendel Gelbart, ed., ''Kehilat Konin: Bi-Feri\u1e25atah uve-\u1e25urbanah,'' Tel Aviv, 1968</ref> Out of 6000 Jewish people living in the city before the German occupation 46 survived the war and returned from the German death camps. None of them continued living in Konin due to the hostility of the non-Jewish population.\n\n==Castles==\nThe 14th-century castle, built of brick with some details made of sandstone (probably taken from the nearby [[quarry]] of [[Brze\u017ano]] village), had a perimeter in the shape of a regular quadrangle. The main buildings were massive, with an octagonal watchtower in the southeast corner of the compound and a kind of great hall on its western side. The castle was also encircled with a double wall and a moat. During the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]] of the 17th century, it was partially damaged by the Swedish army and abandoned to slow decay. The derelict structure was demolished during the 19th century, with its larger sections being removed about 1844\u20131855). Today, there are no remains of the castle itself.  Castle Square (''Plac Zamkowy'') is located in approximately the spot where the castle had stood.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.83\"/> Another castle, erected during the 15th century in the former Gos\u0142awice village, now Konin's Gos\u0142awice district, was restored during the 1980s.\n[[File:9 Castle in Gos\u0142awice.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Gos\u0142awice District: 15th-century Medieval Castle]]\n\n==Ancient town walls==\nThe construction of the town walls started, as in the case of the castle, in the second half of the 14th century. They encircled the town as a defence line, especially on the settlement's southern and eastern sides and partially on the western. The line of walls, however, never entirely formed a closed circuit, as the Warta River and its nearby marshy grounds, bogs, earthworks, and retrenchments provided adequate protection in the gaps. On the north side of town, the Toru\u0144ska Gatehouse (''Brama Toru\u0144ska'') sat just in front of the river crossing, while the south side was guarded from the Kaliska Gatehouse (''Brama Kaliska''); both gatehouses were named for towns that were primary destinations for merchants travelling through Konin.\n\nThe walls were reinforced by a series of rectangular towers that projected from the walls, creating a bastion-like structure.  The towers themselves, each consisting of three walls, were open to the side that faced the town.  These fortifications were seriously damaged during the Deluge, especially in the 1656 siege of Konin.  They were never repaired afterwards, so at the turn of the 18th century the town's authorities chose to have them deconstructed or demolished if necessary. Their last conspicuous elements were removed sometime after 1816, and today there are no remains.<ref>Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz, ''Wojew\u00f3dztwo koni\u0144skie - szkic monograficzny'', p.83-84</ref>\n\n== Architectural landmarks ==\nKonin County (''Powiat Koninski'') contains examples of the following architectural forms: [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], [[Mannerist architecture#Mannerism|Mannerist]], [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], and [[Rococo]]; 18th century [[Classicism]]; 19th century [[Neo-Gothic]], [[Neoromanesque]], [[Neoclassicism]], and [[Eclecticism]]; and 20th century [[Modernism]], [[Nazi architecture]], [[Socialist Realism]], and [[Postmodernism]]. Also near Konin are the remains of the reinforced concrete bunkers employed by Poland's [[Pozna\u0144 Army|''Armia Pozna\u0144'']] during [[World War II]].\n\nArchitecturally, the city of Konin is divided into two historical parts - Old Town (''Stary Konin''), situated on the south bank of the Warta; and New Konin (''Nowy Konin''), spreading northward from the river and developed primarily after 1945.\n\n[[File:SM Konin Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015bw Bart\u0142omieja (7) ID 651687.jpg|thumb|200px|right|St. Bartholomew's Church]]\n*Romanesque\n** The Stone Signpost of Konin is the oldest European signpost beyond the boundaries of the [[Roman Empire]].  Made of local sandstone from the quarry near Brze\u017ano, it was commissioned in 1151 AD by either Duke Piotr W\u0142ost W\u0142ostowicz or Piotr Stary Wszeborowic.  Containing Romanesque inscriptions, some scholars hypothesize that the stone itself was originally a [[Celtic art|Celtic sculpture]].\n** St Bartholomew's parish church was rebuilt in the second half of the 14th century, but its Romanesque features are still visible in the external walls, particularly the north wall. The features include dressed stones made of sandstone and a massive stone cross built into the wall.\n[[File:Konin Gos\u0142awicka 38 Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 pw \u015bw Andrzeja-002.JPG|thumb|200px|right|St. Andrew's Church]]\n*Gothic\n** St Bartholomew's Parish Church is Konin's most notable example of Gothic architecture and art.  It contains a gothic net and vault inside the church and stained glass in the chancel.\n** St Andrew's Church, in Konin's Gos\u0142awice district, is a rural Gothic church with an unusual Greek cross. The building also contains a rare fan vault. Sandstone bosses and other details are richly carved. The external walls are embellished with a number of [[coat of arms|coats of arms]].\n** The 15th century mediaeval castle in Gos\u0142awice, currently a regional museum, was built at the direction of Pozna\u0144's Bishop Andrzej \u0141askarz in 1418-1426. It was designed to be defended with firearms.  Gos\u0142awice contains a rare collection of historical buildings, with its ancient village, Gothic church, mediaeval castle, and old Polish manor.\n*Renaissance\n** On the grounds of St. Bartholomew's Church is the Late Renaissance chapel of Jan Zeme\u0142ko (Zemelius), a local physician, Renaissance man, and well known member of the middle class in Konin and Kalisz.\n** The former home of Jan Zeme\u0142ko, on the ''Plac Wolno\u015bci'', has been refurbished many times since Zeme\u0142ko's era, but the main hall still contains the original barrel vault.  At the ground floor level, the walls are exceedingly thick (1 to 2 m).\n*Mannerism\n** The Manneristic tombstone of Stanis\u0142aw Przyjemski is located at the north wall of the main nave of St. Bartholomew's Parish Church.\n** Manneristic wooden stalls, with inlaid work, are located in the Chapel of Jan Zeme\u0142ko (Zemelius).\n[[File:Konin - monastery.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Monastery and St. Mary Magdalene's Church of Reformed Franciscans]]\n*Baroque\n** St. Bartholomew's Parish Church contains many Baroque altars, epitaphs, and stalls, and a Late Baroque wall crucifix hangs in the porch.  The Late Baroque church organ dates from the 18th century.\n** The Baroque monastery and church building at St. Mary Magdalene's Church of Reformed Franciscans were built in 1631.\n*Rococo\n** At St. Bartholomew's Parish Church, Rococo elements are found in the wall crucifix above the entrance to the porch at the north wall of the main nave and in the main altar at the Chapel of Jan Zeme\u0142ko.\n[[File:Konin_town_hall_-_01.jpg|thumb|200px|Old Town Hall]]\n*Classicism\n** The Town Hall, built at the beginning of the 19th century, has a fa\u00e7ade encompassing four, tall Toscany Columns bearing a large pediment. Above the pediment is a small tower with a clock and a tall flagstaff from which the official flag of Konin is hung on local and state holidays.\n** Old Town contains many Classicist tenement houses as well as a former butcher's shop in the same style, near the Town Hall.\n** The Municipal Council Building, near the ''Plac Wolno\u015bci'', is of the Classicist style.\n** The Presbytery of the Lutheran Church of the Holy Ghost is a Classicist manorhouse, situated in the small garden at the center of the Old Town.\n*Neo-Gothic (19th and 20th centuries)\n** St Bartholomew's Parish Church has a Neo-Gothic main altar made of wood, with many Neo-Gothic statues decorating it.\n** St Andrew's Church, in the Gos\u0142awice District, originally was built in the Gothic style.  It was refurbished in the Neo-Gothic manner.  Its central turret and the fa\u00e7ades of its chapels were built in the 19th century.\n*Eclecticism (19th and 20th centuries)\n** The Lutheran Church of the Holy Ghost, constructed in 1856 and rebuilt in 1901-1915 and 1981\u20131985, is a representation of Eclecticism.  Built when Konin was under the control of the Russian Empire, it is somewhat reminiscent of the style of Russian Orthodox churches.  Constructed of dark brick, its massive main tower is covered with spires and many decorative details.[[File:FP Konin Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142\u015awDucha (8).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Lutheran Church of the Holy Ghost]]\n** St. Adalbert's Church, in the Morzys\u0142aw District, was built in the 18th century on the site of an earlier wooden church and its churchyard.  It was completely refurbished, enlarged, and altered at the beginning of the 20th century, resulting in an impressive large temple, with a tall main tower topped by a high spire.  This church, also, shows the slight influence of Russian Orthodox architecture.\n** Many tenement houses in Old Town have eclectic fa\u00e7ades displaying the features of many different architectural manners and styles.\n** Other examples of Eclecticism in Konin are found in the Jewish buildings, including the Konin Synagogue, the ritual baths, and the Talmudic school house.  These buildings were constructed in the 19th century, and the synagogue is considered to be one of the most beautiful buildings of its kind in Greater Poland. Erected in 1832, it was enlarged and renenovated in 1883.  Its southern fa\u00e7ade refers to the history of the [[Ashkenazi Jews]] and comprises a mix of architectural styles, with a predominance of the [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] and Neo-Gothic styles.  The north fa\u00e7ade is more composed and unencumbered, referring mainly to Classicism, as in its huge pediment.[[File:Konin - St. Adalbert's church.jpg|thumb|200px|right|St. Adalbert's Church]]\n** The [[Romani people|Romani]] Gypsy palaces of ulica Stodolniana and ulica Europejska, in the Old Town, exhibit impressive onion domes and sculptures shaped like miniature, richly embellished mediaeval castles.  Built mainly in the 1980s and 1990s, they represent a unique element within the city's residential districts.[[File:Konin 22.03.2009 - Scottish inscription on the wall of the St. Bartholomew's parish church 2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|17th century inscription on the wall of St. Bartholomew's Parish Church, carved by a Scotsman]]\n*Modernism: Pre-War (1920\u201319390[[File:Konin - Tenement-house in Szarych Szereg\u00f3w street no.1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|ulica Szarych Szereg\u00f3w 1]]\n** Ulica Szarych Szereg\u00f3w 1 is an impressive renovated tenement house with a distinguished fa\u00e7ade and an infamous history. Built in the 1930s by a local MP, it housed the World War II offices of the [[Nazi]] [[Gestapo]], who tortured prisoners there.  After 1945, the building was occupied by the Communist secret state police, the ''[[Urz\u0105d Bezpiecze\u0144stwa]]''.  The building now houses private apartments.\n** Ulica 3 Maja 48 is a fine example of pre-war Modernism.  The Guild of Handicrafts (''Cech Rzemios\u0142 R\u00f3\u017cnych'') is situated there, as are various shops.[[File:Konin - Miejska Biblioteka Publiczna.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Town Library (MBP)]]\n*Modernism: Post-War (1945-1960s)\n** The town's library (''Miejska Biblioteka Publiczna / MBP''), at ulica Dworcowa, is a bulky, cube shaped [[Modernism|Modernistic]] structure.  Perpendicular ribs of concrete divide its windows into narrow segments, and its stark, black on white fa\u00e7ade rises strikingly from the thick greenery that surrounds it.  Before becoming a library, it served as a branch of the [[National Bank of Poland]] (''Narodowy Bank Polski / NBP'').\n** Formerly the Centrum Department Store, the Dino Supermarket on ulica Dworcowa exhibits an upper, street-side fa\u00e7ade that is covered entirely by tilted glass.\n*Nazi Architecture\n** Several examples of Nazi architecture exist in Konin, including a row of buildings in ulica Kolejowa, in New Konin, that were built as lodgings for railwaymen. Just across the street is a monument, commemorating an August, 1943, Jewish uprising.  Another set of Nazi buildings stand in the Old Town, near ulica Szpitalna. This area is known locally as ''[[Heimat]]'', emphasizing its German connection.\n*Socialist Realism\n** Aleje 1-go Maja (Avenue of the First of May), the main street of Nowy Konin, is lined with the city's earliest examples of Socialist Realism architecture.  Among these are the hospital and various public buildings.  Because New Konin was developed primarily after the 1946 installation of the Communist government, it contains very little other than buildings constructed in the stark, Socialist Realism style.\n** Osiedle V (Housing Estate No. 5), designed and built during the 1970s and the early 1980s, it consists characteristically of blocks of flats set in regular rows and devoid of any architectural decoration, a somber testament to the economic difficulties of the [[The People's Republic|People's Republic]] [[Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa|of Poland]] at the time of construction.\n** The Zatorze District, built during the 1980s, consists largely of massive blocks of flats built of prefabricated, grey concrete structural elements, attended by shops and schools of the same style.\n*Postmodernism\n** Representing Catholic ecclesiastical Postmodernism, ten kilometres ({{convert|10|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) from Konin stands the monumental [[Basilica of Our Lady of Liche\u0144]], the world's sixth [[List of largest church buildings in the world#Measurements|largest Christian church]].\n** The PKO BP S.A. bank and office building at ulica 11-go Listopada (Eleventh of November) 20 was one of the first large buildings erected in Konin after the 1989 [[Fall of communism#Poland|fall of Communism]] in Poland.  While having many features rooted in Socialist Realism, it incorporates Postmodernist elements not previously seen in Konin.\n** The Skarpa office and commercial building at ulica Energetyka 6b was completed during the first decade of the 21st century.  The utilitarian character of the building and its interior is in accord with the subtly adorned outer fa\u00e7ades, which are covered with wide strips and plates in the colour of inox.  The exterior pavement is covered with granite cuboids, and its inner floors are inlaid with dark granite plates.\n\n===PTTK (Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society)===\nPerhaps owing to Konin being located at the junction of some of Poland's most historic lands - Greater Poland, [[Cuiavia]], [[Mazovia]], and [[\u0141\u00f3dzkie]] - the local branch of the [[PTTK|Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society]] is very active.<ref>PTTK Oddzial w Koninie - Meetings of members and lovers of PTTK Konin take place every Thursday after 6.30 p.m. in a base (except holidays on, as it follows: 1\u20133 May, 15 August, 1 November, 11 November, 25\u201326 December, 1 January.

It is the capital of [[Konin County]] and is located within the [[Greater Poland Voivodeship]]. Prior to 1999, it was the capital of the [[Konin Voivodeship]] (1975\u20131998). In 2018, the population of the city was 74,151 making it the third-largest city in Greater Poland after [[Pozna\u0144]] and [[Kalisz]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===Prehistory===\nThe earliest evidence of human habitation in Konin has been dated to the [[Paleolithic|Paleolithic Era]]. On the dunes near the Warta, various ancient flint tools and implements have been found, among them being knives, burins, and tanged points. These earliest artifacts are of the [[Swiderian culture]] (''Kultura \u015awiderska'') of 9000\u20138000 BC.\n\n===Ancient times===\nA permanent settlement arose along the [[Amber Road]], which led from the [[Roman Empire]] to the [[Baltic Sea]], traversing the area of present-day Konin.  A map drawn by [[Ptolemy]] identified the settlement as ''[[Setidava]]'' (or ''Getidava''), a probable spot to wade across the Warta and containing an [[Marketplace|emporium]] of some importance to merchants travelling along the route.<ref name=\"Krzysztof Gorczyca\">Krzysztof orczyca, ''Kalisz-Konin on The Amber Route''</ref>  The settlement's primary burial ground, situated on the dunes west of the centre of today's Konin, dates back to the [[Przeworsk culture]] (''Kultura Przeworska'') of the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Konin - Milestone 01.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The Stone Signpost of Konin is the oldest European signpost beyond the boundaries of the former [[Roman Empire]]]]\nToward the end of the [[early Middle Ages]], Gr\u00f3d Kaszuba was the most significant of the fortified settlements near present-day Konin. Inhabited from the 10th through 12th centuries, Gr\u00f3d Kaszuba was situated on the meadows near the Warta.  Its abandonment was likely a consequence of floods which damaged its fortifications.  The remains of Gr\u00f3d Kaszuba are visible on the south bank of the river.\n\nDuring the 12th and 13th centuries, in the [[high Middle Ages|high]] to [[late Middle Ages]], a complex of settlements was centred on the location of today's [[Stare Miasto, Konin County|''Stare Miasto'']], where there existed a large settlement named Konin and a market place and a church built of [[sandstone]].  (The name ''Stare Miasto'' first appeared in use later, after Konin had been reestablished elsewhere.) What remains from that time is SS Peter and Paul's Parish Church, with its magnificent carved portal and a solar clock on the south wall, perhaps the oldest solar clock in [[Greater Poland]]. In 1331, the settlement was plundered and burnt by the [[Teutonic Knights]].  What remained was soon abandoned and the town of Konin was reestablished, six kilometres ({{convert|6|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) to the northeast, in the more defensible spot where the Old Town of Konin is situated today. [[File:Gos\u0142awice-rural architecture in open-air museum.jpg|thumb|220px|Gos\u0142awice district: Rural architecture, reflected in an open-air museum]]\n\nSince the 13th century, Konin has been situated on the marshy grounds of an island within a ford of the Warta River. The oldest available written work confirming the location of the town is associated with Gos\u0142aw, the chief officer of a group of settlers, and was recorded in 1293. The town may have been chartered by the Duke of [[Duchy of Greater Poland|Greater Poland]], [[Przemys\u0142 II]], who visited Konin in 1284 and 1292.  At that time, the town's north-south axis equalled 430 meters, while its east-west axis equalled 210 meters. Also, the town's area was eight hectares, and its circumference was 1100 meters. By the standards of the time, Konin was a town of medium size.<ref>Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz, ''Wojew\u00f3dztwo koni\u0144skie - szkic monograficzny'', p.82</ref>\n[[File:Konin - St Bartholomew's parish church.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]-[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] St Bartholomew's Church]]\nKonin's significance grew during the 14th century. Records from that era indicate that Konin possessed a ''[[Castellan]]'', an office of significance in feudal Poland, and one which only the oldest towns in the country were granted. At approximately the midpoint of the century, Konin became the judicial seat of the Kalisz Voivodeship and functioned under the authority of a ''[[Starost]]''. There may have also been a school in Konin at the time, as a student from Konin is listed in a 14th-century record of the [[Charles University in Prague]].<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.83\">Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz, ''Wojew\u00f3dztwo koni\u0144skie - szkic monograficzny'', p.83</ref>\n\nThe second half of the 14th century and the entire 15th are believed to have been a period of rapid development for Konin. During the reign of the Polish King [[Casimir III the Great]] (1310\u20131370), a [[Konin#Castles|king's castle]] was erected in Konin and the town was encircled with walls and a moat, marking the beginning of Konin as a king's town<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.83\"/> Later, King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] (1351/52 - 1434) was a guest of Konin, visiting in the years of 1403, 1425, and 1433. (W\u0142adys\u0142aw engineered an historic debilitation of the political and military power of the Teutonic Knights by means of his Polish-Lithuanian victory at the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410.) His last stay at Konin, in 1433, was his longest.  Throughout that year's summer, he resided in the town's castle, obtaining reports on a Polish retaliatory strike against the Knights.\n\nIn 1458, during the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)]] against the [[Teutonic Order]], there was a call for military recruitment throughout Poland. Every Polish town was bound to put up a quantity of soldiers, the number of which was a sign of the size and power of a given town. With regard to Konin, it was 15 infantrymen; by comparison, [[Pozna\u0144]], the capital of Greater Poland, was bound to put up 60, while [[Kalisz]], nearby [[S\u0142upca]] and [[K\u0142odawa]], and [[Ko\u0142o]] were to provide 30, 20, 20, and 15 men, respectively.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.84\">Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz, ''Wojew\u00f3dztwo koni\u0144skie - szkic monograficzny'', p.84</ref>  These quantities suggest that Konin was still a town of medium size. Notwithstanding, the town continued its development of handicraft trades and enlarged the area of its Starosty District. In 1425, Konin was granted a charter to conduct two fairs each year.\n\n===Renaissance===\nThe 16th century, the period of [[Polish Golden Age|Poland's golden age]], was a time of significant economic, political, military, cultural, and territorial growth. In 1504, the village of Kur\u00f3w, located on the river bank opposite the main body of Konin, was incorporated into the town.  Furthermore, a description of the town, written in 1557, lists a brickyard and a mill as well as eight butchers, 14 bakers, 21 shoemakers, and four fishermen.  However, Konin may have been one of the smaller towns of the time in eastern Greater Poland, based on its \"Szos,\" the tax assessed on its earnings and the possessions of its townspeople.  Konin was obliged to pay 32 zlotych, while Pozna\u0144 (the capital of Greater Poland) was assessed 1400 zlotych; Kalisz, 230; nearby S\u0142upca, 96; and both Ko\u0142o and [[Pyzdry]], 64.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.85\">Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz, ''Wojew\u00f3dztwo koni\u0144skie - szkic monograficzny'', p.85</ref>\n\nConcerning religious matters and the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the starost of Konin, [[Jakub Ostror\u00f3g]], was a notable supporter of the apostacy,<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.84\"/> and a local parish-priest, Stanis\u0142aw Lutomirski, played a role in the Reformation in the region surrounding Konin.\n\n===17th century===\nDuring the 17th century, epidemics and war greatly afflicted Konin.  A plague of three years' length (1628-1631) decimated the town's population.  Subsequent efforts to revitalize Konin included King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV]]'s 1646 proclamation, confirming the town's right to conduct two fairs annually and promoting participation in those events by offering military protection to merchants who attended them, and a 1652 edict of the Starost, licensing the [[Scotland|Scottish]] community of Konin to erect breweries.  Thereafter, the town was invaded and occupied by the [[Swedish Army]] in 1656 during the [[Second Northern War]] ([[Swedish Deluge|The Deluge]]),<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.85\"/>  suffering extensive damage (see [[Konin#Castles|''Castles'']] and [[Konin#Ancient town walls|''Ancient town walls'']]) and a reduction in the number of its houses, from 127 prior to the war to 25 in 1659 .<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.85\"/>  By war's end, the town's population had been reduced to not more than 200 persons.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.85\"/> Another plague occurred shortly afterward, in 1662.\n\n===18th century===\nThe 18th century began with the turmoil of the [[Great Northern War]], during which Konin was so severely devastated, in 1707, that its restoration required the remainder of the century to complete.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.85\"/>  The second half of the century was a time of advanced crisis for the nation, as an irreversible decline of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] culminated in the [[Partitions of Poland]] and the loss of national independence. Poland's territory was occupied and divided among three bordering countries - [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] - in three stages, occurring in the years of 1772, 1793 and 1795.\n\nAs a consequence of the [[Second Partition of Poland|second partition]], Konin was incorporated into Prussia, ending Konin's status as a [[royal town in Poland|royal town]]. At the time, the town's population was 780, with 165 houses, of which only one was made of brick.  Inhabitants earned their living in agriculture and handicrafts. Among craftsmen, there were 22 shoemakers, 13 potters, and eight furriers.  Eight fairs took place each year, together with a round-up of cattle.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.85\"/>  [[Poles]], [[Jews]], [[Germans]] and [[Scottish people|Scots]] were the town's four main ethnic groups.<ref>Edward hr. Raczy\u0144ski, ''Wspomnienia z Wielkopolski'', p.234</ref>  In 1794, Konin joined the first Polish insurrection, the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]]; the act of joining is recorded in the town's books of that period.  Polish insurgents also took control of the town multiple times - e.g., in September 1794, when the town was entered by the soldiers of the corps of [[Jan Henryk D\u0105browski]], the namesake of the [[Polish national anthem]] - the so-called \"D\u0105browski's Mazurka.\" In 1796, the town was damaged by fire.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.86\">Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz, ''Wojew\u00f3dztwo koni\u0144skie - szkic monograficzny'', p.86</ref>\n\n===19th century===\nThe 19th century began with the general, European disorder of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], which neither eastern Greater Poland nor Konin escaped. At the start of the century, the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] was created as a Polish formally independent state, ''[[de facto]]'' dependent upon [[Napoleon I Bonaparte]]. The Napoleonic Wars gave Poles hope of regaining national independence, and they strongly supported Napoleon.  On November 9, 1806, Poles took control of Konin and quickly organized a new, town government. The following year, the town was formally incorporated into the Duchy of Warsaw.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.86\"/>\n[[File:Warta-Gop\u0142o Canal in Konin (1).JPG|thumb|220px|left|Warta-Gop\u0142o Canal]]\n\nThe subsequent collapse of the [[Napoleonic Empire]] resulted in the establishment of a new order in Europe, as well as within the Polish territories, including Konin.  The [[Congress of Vienna]], assembled in 1814-1815 to arrange political changes on the continent, awarded Russia the majority of territories formerly held by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Konin itself was incorporated into Russia as a part of [[Congress Poland]] (formally the ''Kingdom of Poland''), a pseudo-autonomous region that was a Russian dependency and which recognized the [[tzar]] as its ruler. The town was also designated as the capital of a sector within the [[Kalisz Governorate]]; the sector encompassed two counties, Konin County and Pyzdry County. From an administrative standpoint, Konin's sector constituted the westernmost territory of the Russian state.\n\nThe [[November Uprising]] erupted in 1830. Although Konin was not directly involved in this Polish uprising, as with other Polish cities and towns it suffered the political and cultural consequences of its failure.  Those consequences included the denial of higher offices to Poles, the elimination of Polish as the official language, and the systematic [[russification]] of the primary and secondary schools.\n\nThe [[January Uprising]] of 1863 had a greater effect on Konin than had the 1830 rebellion.  As many as several dozen battles and skirmishes took place in and near Konin, to which many present day monuments attest.\n\nFrom 1815 onwards, trade and handicraft activities increased substantially in Konin. A description of the town, from 1820, states that among the 2,456 inhabitants, there were 161 craftsmen, ten merchants, and 42 peasants.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.86\"/> During the course of the century the population of Konin increased steadily, rising from 4,195 people in 1850 to 7,391 in 1896.  In comparison, nearby Ko\u0142o had an 1896 population of 8,800 inhabitants, while [[Turek]]'s population that same year was 9,900.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.86\"/> However, while nearby [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] was becoming one of the most significant [[textile]] industrial centres in the world, only 12 cloth workshops and small factories existed in Konin in 1820.\n\nDuring the 1830s, a general renewal of the town led to the construction of new streets and squares.  Also, building lots were developed for industrial expansion, and dilapidated buildings were demolished.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.86\"/>\n\nBy the end of the century, there were two factories that produced machines and special tools for agriculture - the larger of them belonged to L. Reymond, a citizen of [[Switzerland]], who settled permanently in Konin.  His factory was equipped with a 12 horse-power [[steam engine]] and a [[cast iron]] [[foundry]].  Apart from these enterprises, the town held 18 windmills, four tanneries, four workshops producing soap, three vinegar factories, two small factories producing boilers, two breweries, two oil-mills, a sparkling water factory, and a distillery.<ref>Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz, ''Wojew\u00f3dztwo koni\u0144skie - szkic monograficzny'', p.86-87</ref>\n\n===20th century===\nFor Konin, the early 20th century was a period of rapid development in the fields of culture, education, and social life.  The Musical Society of Kalisz (''Towarzystwo Muzyczne w Kaliszu'') had as many as 72 members in Konin,<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.87\"/> and Konin's Jewish Library was one of the finest within the Gubernya of Kalisz, with a quantity of books and a general readership that significantly exceeded similar libraries in Kalisz, a much larger urban area. Also, a branch of the Rowing Club of Kalisz (''Kaliskie Towarzystwo Wio\u015blarskie'') was founded in Konin in 1908 and, by 1914, had 95 members. Its building, displaying the club's coat of arms, still stands in Old Konin, in Zofii Urbanowskiej Street.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.87\"/>\n\nWorkers' associations were also established in Konin. In 1905, when significant strikes occurred in Polish industrial centres such as [[Warsaw]] and [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]], there were some minor strikes and turmoil in Konin as well.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.87\">Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz, ''Wojew\u00f3dztwo koni\u0144skie - szkic monograficzny'', p.87</ref>\n\nA branch of the Polish gymnastic society, [[Sok\u00f3\u0142]], was founded in Konin.  A quasi-military association,  its objective was to maintain the fitness of teenagers, to improve their health, and to provide for readily trainable military recruits in the event of a possible national uprising or a defense need. Similar Jewish and German associations also existed.\n\nAfter the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, battles between Russian and Prussian troops occurred near Konin.  Ultimately, the city came under Prussian control and deteriorated.  The economic situation of the town did not improve when, in 1918, Poland regained its independence (see: [[Second Polish Republic]]) in the war's aftermath.  Living conditions of residents were still miserable, exacerbated by the lack of functioning water distribution and sewer systems.  The subsequent inter-war economic crisis was harsh, and conditions did not begin to improve until the ''d\u00e9senclavement'' of the town, attributable to the opening of a major railway, between Pozna\u0144 and Warsaw, and the construction of a canal to [[Gop\u0142o|Gop\u0142o Lake]].\n[[File:Konin-egzekucja-22-09-39.jpg|thumb|German soldiers executing Polish hostages in Konin in 1939]]\nJews had represented 30% of Konin's population prior to the [[Second World War]]. During the war, Konin was part of the land annexed by [[Nazi Germany]] (''[[Reichsgau Wartheland]]''). In the town's surrounding forests, the Nazis carried out mass executions of Jews which 95% were killed or send to concentration camps.  In August 1943, the Jews at the labour camp at Konin, led by Rabbi Joshua Moshe Aaronson, burned down the huts in the camp and tried to escape.  Almost all of them were killed.<ref>Martin Gilbert, 'The Holocaust' (1986), pages 597-598</ref>  The town survivors published, in 1968, an extensive \"Yizkor Book\" (803 pages) in memory in the flourishing Jewish community: Mendel Gelbart, ed., Kehilat Konin: Bi-Feri\u1e25atah uve-hurbanah (Tel Aviv). The book was written in Yiddish, Hebrew and English. A descendant of Konin Jews, Theo Richmond, wrote ''Konin: A Quest'', the most extensive history of Jewish life in the town ever to appear in English. The majority of Jews in Konin were [[Mitnagdim]], though two small communities of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] lived within the Konin Jewish community, mostly adherents to [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Gerer Hasidism]], with a small group of [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)|Aleksander Hasidim]].<ref>Theo Richmond, ''Konin'', p.209</ref>\n\n==Jewish community of Konin==\n[[File:Konin - synagogue.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Konin Synagogue]]\nThe first written evidence of Jews settling in Konin dates to 1397. In the 15th century, 180 Jews were counted in the city. Over the course of the 17th century, the number of Jews in the city shrunk as a result of fires, plagues, and restrictions upon Jewish residency. Administratively, the Jews of Konin were subordinate to the larger community in nearby [[Kalisz]] until the end of the 18th century. \n\nA wooden synagogue was built in 1763-1766. The current standing building was built in 1829. The first rabbi in Konin was Rabbi Amsterdam, between 1810-1849.\n[[File:Gos\u0142awice district - Jewish remains in museum.jpg|thumb|200px|Remains of Jewish tombstones]]\nBetween the two world wars, some 3,000 Jews lived in the city, constituting roughly a quarter of its residents. In 1918, the first Jewish [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] was established. The community had a [[beit midrash]], [[mikvaot]], [[synagogues]], a few prayer halls (such as \"Hevra Tehilim\"), active youth movements, a library, a Jewish elementary school and a Jewish high school. During this period, movements such as [[Agudat Yisrael]], the different Zionist parties, and the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|Bund]] were active there. \n\nIn November 1941, 3000 Jews of Konin were murdered by the German SS in the forests of Kaziemesh (Kleczew), north of the city.<ref>Mendel Gelbart, ed., ''Kehilat Konin: Bi-Feri\u1e25atah uve-\u1e25urbanah,'' Tel Aviv, 1968</ref> Out of 6000 Jewish people living in the city before the German occupation 46 survived the war and returned from the German death camps. None of them continued living in Konin due to the hostility of the non-Jewish population.\n\n==Castles==\nThe 14th-century castle, built of brick with some details made of sandstone (probably taken from the nearby [[quarry]] of [[Brze\u017ano]] village), had a perimeter in the shape of a regular quadrangle. The main buildings were massive, with an octagonal watchtower in the southeast corner of the compound and a kind of great hall on its western side. The castle was also encircled with a double wall and a moat. During the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]] of the 17th century, it was partially damaged by the Swedish army and abandoned to slow decay. The derelict structure was demolished during the 19th century, with its larger sections being removed about 1844\u20131855). Today, there are no remains of the castle itself.  Castle Square (''Plac Zamkowy'') is located in approximately the spot where the castle had stood.<ref name=\"Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz p.83\"/> Another castle, erected during the 15th century in the former Gos\u0142awice village, now Konin's Gos\u0142awice district, was restored during the 1980s.\n[[File:9 Castle in Gos\u0142awice.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Gos\u0142awice District: 15th-century Medieval Castle]]\n\n==Ancient town walls==\nThe construction of the town walls started, as in the case of the castle, in the second half of the 14th century. They encircled the town as a defence line, especially on the settlement's southern and eastern sides and partially on the western. The line of walls, however, never entirely formed a closed circuit, as the Warta River and its nearby marshy grounds, bogs, earthworks, and retrenchments provided adequate protection in the gaps. On the north side of town, the Toru\u0144ska Gatehouse (''Brama Toru\u0144ska'') sat just in front of the river crossing, while the south side was guarded from the Kaliska Gatehouse (''Brama Kaliska''); both gatehouses were named for towns that were primary destinations for merchants travelling through Konin.\n\nThe walls were reinforced by a series of rectangular towers that projected from the walls, creating a bastion-like structure.  The towers themselves, each consisting of three walls, were open to the side that faced the town.  These fortifications were seriously damaged during the Deluge, especially in the 1656 siege of Konin.  They were never repaired afterwards, so at the turn of the 18th century the town's authorities chose to have them deconstructed or demolished if necessary. Their last conspicuous elements were removed sometime after 1816, and today there are no remains.<ref>Piotr Malu\u015bkiewicz, ''Wojew\u00f3dztwo koni\u0144skie - szkic monograficzny'', p.83-84</ref>\n\n== Architectural landmarks ==\nKonin County (''Powiat Koninski'') contains examples of the following architectural forms: [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], [[Mannerist architecture#Mannerism|Mannerist]], [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], and [[Rococo]]; 18th century [[Classicism]]; 19th century [[Neo-Gothic]], [[Neoromanesque]], [[Neoclassicism]], and [[Eclecticism]]; and 20th century [[Modernism]], [[Nazi architecture]], [[Socialist Realism]], and [[Postmodernism]]. Also near Konin are the remains of the reinforced concrete bunkers employed by Poland's [[Pozna\u0144 Army|''Armia Pozna\u0144'']] during [[World War II]].\n\nArchitecturally, the city of Konin is divided into two historical parts - Old Town (''Stary Konin''), situated on the south bank of the Warta; and New Konin (''Nowy Konin''), spreading northward from the river and developed primarily after 1945.\n\n[[File:SM Konin Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015bw Bart\u0142omieja (7) ID 651687.jpg|thumb|200px|right|St. Bartholomew's Church]]\n*Romanesque\n** The Stone Signpost of Konin is the oldest European signpost beyond the boundaries of the [[Roman Empire]].  Made of local sandstone from the quarry near Brze\u017ano, it was commissioned in 1151 AD by either Duke Piotr W\u0142ost W\u0142ostowicz or Piotr Stary Wszeborowic.  Containing Romanesque inscriptions, some scholars hypothesize that the stone itself was originally a [[Celtic art|Celtic sculpture]].\n** St Bartholomew's parish church was rebuilt in the second half of the 14th century, but its Romanesque features are still visible in the external walls, particularly the north wall. The features include dressed stones made of sandstone and a massive stone cross built into the wall.\n[[File:Konin Gos\u0142awicka 38 Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 pw \u015bw Andrzeja-002.JPG|thumb|200px|right|St. Andrew's Church]]\n*Gothic\n** St Bartholomew's Parish Church is Konin's most notable example of Gothic architecture and art.  It contains a gothic net and vault inside the church and stained glass in the chancel.\n** St Andrew's Church, in Konin's Gos\u0142awice district, is a rural Gothic church with an unusual Greek cross. The building also contains a rare fan vault. Sandstone bosses and other details are richly carved. The external walls are embellished with a number of [[coat of arms|coats of arms]].\n** The 15th century mediaeval castle in Gos\u0142awice, currently a regional museum, was built at the direction of Pozna\u0144's Bishop Andrzej \u0141askarz in 1418-1426. It was designed to be defended with firearms.  Gos\u0142awice contains a rare collection of historical buildings, with its ancient village, Gothic church, mediaeval castle, and old Polish manor.\n*Renaissance\n** On the grounds of St. Bartholomew's Church is the Late Renaissance chapel of Jan Zeme\u0142ko (Zemelius), a local physician, Renaissance man, and well known member of the middle class in Konin and Kalisz.\n** The former home of Jan Zeme\u0142ko, on the ''Plac Wolno\u015bci'', has been refurbished many times since Zeme\u0142ko's era, but the main hall still contains the original barrel vault.  At the ground floor level, the walls are exceedingly thick (1 to 2 m).\n*Mannerism\n** The Manneristic tombstone of Stanis\u0142aw Przyjemski is located at the north wall of the main nave of St. Bartholomew's Parish Church.\n** Mannerstic wooden stalls, with inlaid work, are located in the Chapel of Jan Zeme\u0142ko (Zemelius).\n[[File:Konin - monastery.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Monastery and St. Mary Magdalene's Church of Reformed Franciscans]]\n*Baroque\n** St. Bartholomew's Parish Church contains many Baroque altars, epitaphs, and stalls, and a Late Baroque wall crucifix hangs in the porch.  The Late Baroque church organ dates from the 18th century.\n** The Baroque monastery and church building at St. Mary Magdalene's Church of Reformed Franciscans were built in 1631.\n*Rococo\n** At St. Bartholomew's Parish Church, Rococo elements are found in the wall crucifix above the entrance to the porch at the north wall of the main nave and in the main altar at the Chapel of Jan Zeme\u0142ko.\n[[File:Konin_town_hall_-_01.jpg|thumb|200px|Old Town Hall]]\n*Classicism\n** The Town Hall, built at the beginning of the 19th century, has a fa\u00e7ade encompassing four, tall Toscany Columns bearing a large pediment. Above the pediment is a small tower with a clock and a tall flagstaff from which the official flag of Konin is hung on local and state holidays.\n** Old Town contains many Classicist tenement houses as well as a former butcher's shop in the same style, near the Town Hall.\n** The Municipal Council Building, near the ''Plac Wolno\u015bci'', is of the Classicist style.\n** The Presbytery of the Lutheran Church of the Holy Ghost is a Classicist manorhouse, situated in the small garden at the center of the Old Town.\n*Neo-Gothic (19th and 20th centuries)\n** St Bartholomew's Parish Church has a Neo-Gothic main altar made of wood, with many Neo-Gothic statues decorating it.\n** St Andrew's Church, in the Gos\u0142awice District, originally was built in the Gothic style.  It was refurbished in the Neo-Gothic manner.  Its central turret and the fa\u00e7ades of its chapels were built in the 19th century.\n*Eclecticism (19th and 20th centuries)\n** The Lutheran Church of the Holy Ghost, constructed in 1856 and rebuilt in 1901-1915 and 1981\u20131985, is a representation of Eclecticism.  Built when Konin was under the control of the Russian Empire, it is somewhat reminiscent of the style of Russian Orthodox churches.  Constructed of dark brick, its massive main tower is covered with spires and many decorative details.[[File:FP Konin Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142\u015awDucha (8).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Lutheran Church of the Holy Ghost]]\n** St. Adalbert's Church, in the Morzys\u0142aw District, was built in the 18th century on the site of an earlier wooden church and its churchyard.  It was completely refurbished, enlarged, and altered at the beginning of the 20th century, resulting in an impressive large temple, with a tall main tower topped by a high spire.  This church, also, shows the slight influence of Russian Orthodox architecture.\n** Many tenement houses in Old Town have eclectic fa\u00e7ades displaying the features of many different architectural manners and styles.\n** Other examples of Eclecticism in Konin are found in the Jewish buildings, including the Konin Synagogue, the ritual baths, and the Talmudic school house.  These buildings were constructed in the 19th century, and the synagogue is considered to be one of the most beautiful buildings of its kind in Greater Poland. Erected in 1832, it was enlarged and renenovated in 1883.  Its southern fa\u00e7ade refers to the history of the [[Ashkenazi Jews]] and comprises a mix of architectural styles, with a predominance of the [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] and Neo-Gothic styles.  The north fa\u00e7ade is more composed and unencumbered, referring mainly to Classicism, as in its huge pediment.[[File:Konin - St. Adalbert's church.jpg|thumb|200px|right|St. Adalbert's Church]]\n** The [[Romani people|Romani]] Gypsy palaces of ulica Stodolniana and ulica Europejska, in the Old Town, exhibit impressive onion domes and sculptures shaped like miniature, richly embellished mediaeval castles.  Built mainly in the 1980s and 1990s, they represent a unique element within the city's residential districts.[[File:Konin 22.03.2009 - Scottish inscription on the wall of the St. Bartholomew's parish church 2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|17th century inscription on the wall of St. Bartholomew's Parish Church, carved by a Scotsman]]\n*Modernism: Pre-War (1920\u201319390[[File:Konin - Tenement-house in Szarych Szereg\u00f3w street no.1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|ulica Szarych Szereg\u00f3w 1]]\n** Ulica Szarych Szereg\u00f3w 1 is an impressive renovated tenement house with a distinguished fa\u00e7ade and an infamous history. Built in the 1930s by a local MP, it housed the World War II offices of the [[Nazi]] [[Gestapo]], who tortured prisoners there.  After 1945, the building was occupied by the Communist secret state police, the ''[[Urz\u0105d Bezpiecze\u0144stwa]]''.  The building now houses private apartments.\n** Ulica 3 Maja 48 is a fine example of pre-war Modernism.  The Guild of Handicrafts (''Cech Rzemios\u0142 R\u00f3\u017cnych'') is situated there, as are various shops.[[File:Konin - Miejska Biblioteka Publiczna.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Town Library (MBP)]]\n*Modernism: Post-War (1945-1960s)\n** The town's library (''Miejska Biblioteka Publiczna / MBP''), at ulica Dworcowa, is a bulky, cube shaped [[Modernism|Modernistic]] structure.  Perpendicular ribs of concrete divide its windows into narrow segments, and its stark, black on white fa\u00e7ade rises strikingly from the thick greenery that surrounds it.  Before becoming a library, it served as a branch of the [[National Bank of Poland]] (''Narodowy Bank Polski / NBP'').\n** Formerly the Centrum Department Store, the Dino Supermarket on ulica Dworcowa exhibits an upper, street-side fa\u00e7ade that is covered entirely by tilted glass.\n*Nazi Architecture\n** Several examples of Nazi architecture exist in Konin, including a row of buildings in ulica Kolejowa, in New Konin, that were built as lodgings for railwaymen. Just across the street is a monument, commemorating an August, 1943, Jewish uprising.  Another set of Nazi buildings stand in the Old Town, near ulica Szpitalna. This area is known locally as ''[[Heimat]]'', emphasizing its German connection.\n*Socialist Realism\n** Aleje 1-go Maja (Avenue of the First of May), the main street of Nowy Konin, is lined with the city's earliest examples of Socialist Realism architecture.  Among these are the hospital and various public buildings.  Because New Konin was developed primarily after the 1946 installation of the Communist government, it contains very little other than buildings constructed in the stark, Socialist Realism style.\n** Osiedle V (Housing Estate No. 5), designed and built during the 1970s and the early 1980s, it consists characteristically of blocks of flats set in regular rows and devoid of any architectural decoration, a somber testament to the economic difficulties of the [[The People's Republic|People's Republic]] [[Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa|of Poland]] at the time of construction.\n** The Zatorze District, built during the 1980s, consists largely of massive blocks of flats built of prefabricated, grey concrete structural elements, attended by shops and schools of the same style.\n*Postmodernism\n** Representing Catholic ecclesiastical Postmodernism, ten kilometres ({{convert|10|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) from Konin stands the monumental [[Basilica of Our Lady of Liche\u0144]], the world's sixth [[List of largest church buildings in the world#Measurements|largest Christian church]].\n** The PKO BP S.A. bank and office building at ulica 11-go Listopada (Eleventh of November) 20 was one of the first large buildings erected in Konin after the 1989 [[Fall of communism#Poland|fall of Communism]] in Poland.  While having many features rooted in Socialist Realism, it incorporates Postmodernist elements not previously seen in Konin.\n** The Skarpa office and commercial building at ulica Energetyka 6b was completed during the first decade of the 21st century.  The utilitarian character of the building and its interior is in accord with the subtly adorned outer fa\u00e7ades, which are covered with wide strips and plates in the colour of inox.  The exterior pavement is covered with granite cuboids, and its inner floors are inlaid with dark granite plates.\n\n===PTTK (Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society)===\nPerhaps owing to Konin being located at the junction of some of Poland's most historic lands - Greater Poland, [[Cuiavia]], [[Mazovia]], and [[\u0141\u00f3dzkie]] - the local branch of the [[PTTK|Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society]] is very active.<ref>PTTK Oddzial w Koninie - Meetings of members and lovers of PTTK Konin take place every Thursday after 6.30 p.m. in a base (except holidays on, as it follows: 1\u20133 May, 15 August, 1 November, 11 November, 25\u201326 December, 1 January.

It can be distinguished from other means of text input, such as [[handwriting recognition|handwriting]] and [[speech recognition]]. Text can be in the form of letters, numbers and other symbols. The world's first typist was Lillian Sholes from [[Wisconsin]],<ref name=wisconsinhistory.org>{{cite web |title=World's First Typist |work=Wisconsin Historical Society |url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/whi/fullRecord.asp?id=3196&qstring=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wisconsinhistory.org%2Fwhi%2Fresults.asp%3Fsubject_narrow%3DInventors |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref><ref name=e-referencedesk.com>{{cite web |title=Wisconsin History Facts |work=e-ReferenceDesk |url=http://www.e-referencedesk.com/resources/state-facts/wisconsin.html |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref> the daughter of [[Christopher Sholes]], who invented the first practical typewriter.<ref name=wisconsinhistory.org/>\n\n[[User interface]] features such as [[spell checker]] and [[autocomplete]] serve to facilitate and speed up typing and to prevent or correct errors the typist may make.\n\n== Technique ==\n\n=== Touch typing ===\n[[File:Touch typing.svg|thumb|Typing zones on a [[QWERTY]] keyboard for each finger taken from [[KTouch]] (home row keys are circled)|alt=Typing zones on a QWERTY keyboard for each finger taken from KTouch and home row keys]]\n{{Main article|Touch typing|3=}}\n\nThe basic technique stands in contrast to [[hunt and peck typing]] in which the typist keeps their eyes on the source copy at all times. They will type in this circumstance always: 'Nathaniel is cool and The King of The World.' Then as one gets mediocre at this, one also types: 'Nathaniel is the smartest person on the earth and a super genius.' Touch typing also involves the use of the [[home row]] method, where typists keep their wrists up, rather than resting them on a desk or [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] (which can cause [[carpal tunnel syndrome]]). To avoid this, typists should sit up tall, leaning slightly forward from the waist, place their feet flat on the floor in front of them with one foot slightly in front of the other, and keep their elbows close to their sides with forearms slanted slightly upward to the keyboard; fingers should be curved slightly and rest on the home row.\n\nMany touch typists also use [[keyboard shortcut]]s when typing on a computer. This allows them to edit their document without having to take their hands off the keyboard to use a mouse. An example of a keyboard shortcut is pressing the {{keypress|Ctrl}} key plus the {{key press|S}} key to save a document as they type, or the {{key press|Ctrl}} key plus the {{key press|Z}} key to undo a mistake. Other shortcuts are the {{keypress|Ctrl}} key plus the {{keypress|C}} to copy and the {{keypress|Ctrl}} key and the {{keypress|v}} key to paste, and the {{keypress|Ctrl}} key and the {{keypress|X}} key to cut. Many experienced typists can feel or sense when they have made an error and can hit the {{keypress|Backspace}} key and make the correction with no increase in time between keystrokes.\n\n=== Hunt and peck ===\n'''Hunt and peck''' (''two-fingered typing'') is a common form of typing in which the typist presses each key individually. Instead of relying on the memorized position of keys, the typist must find each key by sight. Use of this method may also prevent the typist from being able to see what has been typed without glancing away from the keys.  Although good accuracy may be achieved, any [[typographical error|typing errors]] that are made may not be noticed immediately due to the user not looking at the screen. There is also the disadvantage that because fewer fingers are used, those that are used are forced to move a much greater distance.\n[[File:Civilian Conservation Corps, Third Corps Area, typing class with W.P.A. instructor - NARA - 197144.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Civilian Conservation Corps typing class, 1933]]\n\n=== Hybrid ===\nThere are many idiosyncratic typing styles in between novice-style \"hunt and peck\" and touch typing. For example, many \"hunt and peck\" typists have the keyboard layout memorized and are able to type while focusing their gaze on the screen. Some use just two fingers, while others use 3\u20136 fingers. Some use their fingers very consistently, with the same finger being used to type the same character every time, while others vary the way they use their fingers.\n\nOne study examining 30 subjects, of varying different styles and expertise, has found minimal difference in typing speed between touch typists and self-taught hybrid typists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-02-ten-fingers-fast.html|title=Ten fingers not needed for fast typing, study shows|author=|date=|website=phys.org}}</ref> According to the study, \"The number of fingers does not determine typing speed... People using self-taught typing strategies were found to be as fast as trained typists... instead of the number of fingers, there are other factors that predict typing speed... fast typists... keep their hands fixed on one position, instead of moving them over the keyboard, and more consistently use the same finger to type a certain letter.\" To quote doctoral candidate Anna Feit: \"We were surprised to observe that people who took a typing course, performed at similar average speed and accuracy, as those that taught typing to themselves and only used 6 fingers on average\"\n\n=== Buffering ===\nSome people combine '''touch typing''' and '''hunt and peck''' by using a '''buffering''' method. In the buffer method, the typist looks at the source copy, mentally stores one or several sentences, then looks at the keyboard and types out the '''buffer''' of sentences. This eliminates frequent up and down motions with the head and is used in typing competitions in which the typist is not well versed in touch typing.{{clarify|date=June 2015}}<!--It would be nice to provide a specific example of this type of competition.--> Not normally used in day-to-day contact with keyboards, this buffer method is used only when time is of the essence.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n=== Thumbing ===\nA late 20th century trend in typing, primarily used with devices with small keyboards (such as PDAs and Smartphones), is ''thumbing'' or thumb typing.  This can be accomplished using one or both thumbs. Similar to desktop keyboards and input devices, if a user overuses keys which need hard presses and/or have small and unergonomic layouts, it could cause thumb tendonitis or other [[repetitive strain injury]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n== Words per minute ==\n{{Contradicts other|date=April 2010|1=Words per minute}}\n{{further information|Words per minute}}\n[[Words per minute]] (WPM) is a measure of typing speed, commonly used in [[recruitment]]. For the purposes of WPM measurement a word is standardized to five characters or keystrokes. Therefore, \"brown\" counts as one word, but \"mozzarella\" counts as two.\n\nThe benefits of a standardized measurement of input speed are that it enables comparison across language and hardware boundaries. The speed of an [[Afrikaans]]-speaking operator in [[Cape Town]] can be compared with a [[French language|French]]-speaking operator in [[Paris]].\n\n=== Alphanumeric entry{{anchor|Alphanumeric entry}} ===\nIn one study of average computer users, the average rate for transcription was 33 words per minute, and 19 words per minute for composition.<ref>Karat, C.M., Halverson, C., Horn, D. and Karat, J.

An average professional [[Copy typist|typist]] reaches 50 to 80 wpm, while some positions can require 80 to 95 wpm (usually the minimum required for dispatch positions and other typing jobs), and some advanced typists work at speeds above 120 wpm.<ref name=\"Ayres&Martin\u00e1s2005\">{{citation |year=2005 |author=Ayres, Robert U |authorlink=Robert Ayres (scientist) |author2=Martin\u00e1s, Katalin |chapter=120 wpm for very skilled typist |page=41 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ksxK7J95IF8C&pg=PA41&dq=typists+%22120+words+per+minute%22#v=onepage&q=typists%20%22120%20words%20per%20minute%22&f=false |title=On the Reappraisal of Microeconomics: Economic Growth and Change in a Material World |place=Cheltenham, UK & Northampton, Massachusetts |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=1-84542-272-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ksxK7J95IF8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=reappraisal+microeconomics#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=22 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n |author            = Teresia R.

M. (1988). Human-computer interface design guidelines. Norwood, NJ: [[Ablex Publishing]].</ref>  From the 1920s through the 1970s, typing speed (along with shorthand speed) was an important secretarial qualification and typing contests were popular and often publicized by typewriter companies as promotional tools.\n\nA less common measure of the speed of a typist, CPM is used to identify the number of characters typed per minute. This is a common measurement for typing programs, or typing tutors, as it can give a more accurate measure of a person's typing speed without having to type for a prolonged period of time. The common conversion factor between WPM and CPM is 5. It is also used occasionally for associating the speed of a reader with the amount they have read. CPM has also been applied to 20th century printers, but modern faster printers more commonly use PPM (pages per minute).\n\nThe fastest typing speed ever, 216 words per minute, was achieved by Stella Pajunas-Garnand from Chicago in 1946 in one minute on an [[IBM Electric typewriter|IBM electric]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigsiteofamazingfacts.com/history-of-typewriters |title=History of Typewriters &#124; Big Site of Amazing Facts \u00ae |publisher=Bigsiteofamazingfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.owled.com/typing.html |title=World Records in Typing |publisher=Owled.com |date=2006-09-02 |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/modelb/modelb_4509PH04.html |title=IBM Archives: Typing posture |publisher=03.ibm.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deskstore.com/INFORMATION-1/en/Plan-Your-Office/Believe-it-or-not |title=Believe it or not ... |publisher=Deskstore.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref> using the [[QWERTY]] key layout.<ref>url=http://thekindle3books.com/qwerty-vs-dvorak-the-two-great-keyboards-the-time-were-born/</ref><ref>url=https://www.pond5.com/stock-footage/75268195/miss-stella-pajunas-worlds-fast-typist-types-ibm-electric-ty.html</ref> {{As of|2005}}, writer Barbara Blackburn was the fastest [[English language]] typist in the world, according to [[The Guinness Book of World Records]].

Blackburn, who failed her [[QWERTY]] typing class in high school, first encountered the Dvorak layout in 1938, quickly learned to achieve very high speeds, and occasionally toured giving speed-typing demonstrations during her secretarial career.

In the past, using a typewriter, speed was measured with a stopwatch and errors were tallied by hand. With the current technology, document preparation is more about using word-processors as a composition aid, changing the meaning of error rate and how it is measured. Research performed by R. William Soukoreff and I. Scott MacKenzie, has led to a discovery of the application of a well-known algorithm. Through the use of this algorithm and accompanying analysis technique, two statistics were used, ''minimum string distance error rate'' (MSD error rate) and ''keystrokes per character'' (KSPC). The two advantages of this technique include:\n\n* Participants are allowed to enter text naturally, since they may commit errors and correct them.\n* The identification of errors and generation of error rate statistics is easy to automate.\n\n==== Deconstructing the text input process ====\nThrough analysis of keystrokes, the keystrokes of the input stream were divided into four classes: Correct (C), Incorrect Fixed (IF), Fixes (F), and Incorrect Not Fixed (INF). These key stroke classification are broken down into the following\n\n* The two classes Correct and Incorrect Not Fixed comprise all of the characters in transcribed text. \n* Fixes (F) keystrokes are easy to identify, and include keystrokes such as backspace, delete, cursor movements, and modifier keys.\n* Incorrect Fixed (IF) keystrokes are found in the input stream, but not the transcribed text, and are not editing keys.\n\nUsing these classes, the Minimum String Distance Error Rate and the Key Strokes per Character statistics can both be calculated.\n\n==== Minimum string distance error rate ====\nThe minimum string distance (MSD) is the number of \"primitives\" which is the number of insertions, deletions, or substitutions to transform one string into another. The following equation was found for the MSD Error Rate\n\n''MSD Error Rate'' = <math>(INF/(C + INF)) * 100\\%</math>\n\n==== Key strokes per character (KSPC) ====\nWith the minimum string distance error, errors that are corrected do not appear in the transcribed text. The following example will show you why this is an important class of errors to consider:\n\n''Presented Text'':       the quick brown<br />\n''Input Stream'':         the quix<-ck brown<br />\n''Transcribed Text'':     the quick brown\n\nin the above example, the incorrect character ('x') was deleted with a backspace ('<-'). Since these errors do not appear in the transcribed text, the MSD error rate is 0%. This is why there is the key strokes per character (KSPC) statistic.\n\n''KSPC'' = <math>(C+INF+IF+F)/(C+INF)</math>\n\nThe three shortcomings of the KSPC statistic are listed below:\n\n* High KSPC values can be related to either many errors which were corrected, or few errors which were not corrected; however, there is no way to distinguish the two.\n* KSPC depend on the text input method, and cannot be used to meaningfully compare two different input methods, such as Qwerty-keyboard and a multi-tap input.\n* There is no obvious way to combine KSPC and MSD into an overall error rate, even though they have an inverse relationship.\n\n==== Further metrics ====\nUsing the classes described above, further metrics were defined by R. William Soukoreff and I.Scott MacKenzie:\n\n''Error correction efficiency'' refers to the ease with which the participant performed error correction.\n* ''Correction Efficiency'' = IF/F\n''Participant conscientiousness'' is the ratio of corrected errors to the total number of error, which helps distinguish perfectionists from apathetic participants.\n* ''Participant Conscientiousness'' = IF / (IF + INF)\nIf C represents the amount of useful information transferred, INF, IF, and F represent the proportion of bandwidth wasted.\n* ''Utilized Bandwidth'' = C / (C + INF + IF + F)<br />\n* ''Wasted Bandwidth'' = (INF + IF + F)/ (C + INF + IF + F)\n\n==== Total error rate ====\nThe classes described also provide an intuitive definition of total error rate:\n\n* ''Total Error Rate'' = ((INF + IF)/ (C + INF + IF)) * 100%\n* ''Not Corrected Error Rate'' = (INF/ (C + INF + IF)) * 100%\n* ''Corrected Error Rate'' = (IF/ (C + INF + IF)) * 100%\n\nSince these three error rates are ratios, they are comparable between different devices, something that cannot be done with the KSPC statistic, which is device dependent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soukoreff.com/academic/chi03 |title=Soukoreff, R.

It can be distinguished from other means of text input, such as [[handwriting recognition|handwriting]] and [[speech recognition]]. Text can be in the form of letters, numbers and other symbols. The world's first typist was Lillian Sholes from [[Wisconsin]],<ref name=wisconsinhistory.org>{{cite web |title=World's First Typist |work=Wisconsin Historical Society |url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/whi/fullRecord.asp?id=3196&qstring=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wisconsinhistory.org%2Fwhi%2Fresults.asp%3Fsubject_narrow%3DInventors |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref><ref name=e-referencedesk.com>{{cite web |title=Wisconsin History Facts |work=e-ReferenceDesk |url=http://www.e-referencedesk.com/resources/state-facts/wisconsin.html |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref> the daughter of [[Christopher Sholes]], who invented the first practical typewriter.<ref name=wisconsinhistory.org/>\n\n[[User interface]] features such as [[spell checker]] and [[autocomplete]] serve to facilitate and speed up typing and to prevent or correct errors the typist may make.\n\n== Technique ==\n\n=== Touch typing ===\n[[File:Touch typing.svg|thumb|Typing zones on a [[QWERTY]] keyboard for each finger taken from [[KTouch]] (home row keys are circled)|alt=Typing zones on a QWERTY keyboard for each finger taken from KTouch and home row keys]]\n{{Main article|Touch typing|3=}}\n\nThe basic technique stands in contrast to [[hunt and peck typing]] in which the typist keeps their eyes on the source copy at all times. Touch typing also involves the use of the [[home row]] method, where typists keep their wrists up, rather than resting them on a desk or [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] (which can cause [[carpal tunnel syndrome]]). To avoid this, typists should sit up tall, leaning slightly forward from the waist, place their feet flat on the floor in front of them with one foot slightly in front of the other, and keep their elbows close to their sides with forearms slanted slightly upward to the keyboard; fingers should be curved slightly and rest on the home row.\n\nMany touch typists also use [[keyboard shortcut]]s when typing on a computer. This allows them to edit their document without having to take their hands off the keyboard to use a mouse. An example of a keyboard shortcut is pressing the {{keypress|Ctrl}} key plus the {{key press|S}} key to save a document as they type, or the {{key press|Ctrl}} key plus the {{key press|Z}} key to undo a mistake. Other shortcuts are the {{keypress|Ctrl}} key plus the {{keypress|C}} to copy and the {{keypress|Ctrl}} key and the {{keypress|v}} key to paste, and the {{keypress|Ctrl}} key and the {{keypress|X}} key to cut. Many experienced typists can feel or sense when they have made an error and can hit the {{keypress|Backspace}} key and make the correction with no increase in time between keystrokes.\n\n=== Hunt and peck ===\n'''Hunt and peck''' (''two-fingered typing'') is a common form of typing in which the typist presses each key individually. Instead of relying on the memorized position of keys, the typist must find each key by sight. Use of this method may also prevent the typist from being able to see what has been typed without glancing away from the keys.  Although good accuracy may be achieved, any [[typographical error|typing errors]] that are made may not be noticed immediately due to the user not looking at the screen. There is also the disadvantage that because fewer fingers are used, those that are used are forced to move a much greater distance.\n[[File:Civilian Conservation Corps, Third Corps Area, typing class with W.P.A. instructor - NARA - 197144.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Civilian Conservation Corps typing class, 1933]]\n\n=== Hybrid ===\nThere are many idiosyncratic typing styles in between novice-style \"hunt and peck\" and touch typing. For example, many \"hunt and peck\" typists have the keyboard layout memorized and are able to type while focusing their gaze on the screen. Some use just two fingers, while others use 3\u20136 fingers. Some use their fingers very consistently, with the same finger being used to type the same character every time, while others vary the way they use their fingers.\n\nOne study examining 30 subjects, of varying different styles and expertise, has found minimal difference in typing speed between touch typists and self-taught hybrid typists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-02-ten-fingers-fast.html|title=Ten fingers not needed for fast typing, study shows|author=|date=|website=phys.org}}</ref> According to the study, \"The number of fingers does not determine typing speed... People using self-taught typing strategies were found to be as fast as trained typists... instead of the number of fingers, there are other factors that predict typing speed... fast typists... keep their hands fixed on one position, instead of moving them over the keyboard, and more consistently use the same finger to type a certain letter.\" To quote doctoral candidate Anna Feit: \"We were surprised to observe that people who took a typing course, performed at similar average speed and accuracy, as those that taught typing to themselves and only used 6 fingers on average\"\n\n=== Buffering ===\nSome people combine '''touch typing''' and '''hunt and peck''' by using a '''buffering''' method. In the buffer method, the typist looks at the source copy, mentally stores one or several sentences, then looks at the keyboard and types out the '''buffer''' of sentences. This eliminates frequent up and down motions with the head and is used in typing competitions in which the typist is not well versed in touch typing.{{clarify|date=June 2015}}<!--It would be nice to provide a specific example of this type of competition.--> Not normally used in day-to-day contact with keyboards, this buffer method is used only when time is of the essence.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n=== Thumbing ===\nA late 20th century trend in typing, primarily used with devices with small keyboards (such as PDAs and Smartphones), is ''thumbing'' or thumb typing.  This can be accomplished using one or both thumbs. Similar to desktop keyboards and input devices, if a user overuses keys which need hard presses and/or have small and unergonomic layouts, it could cause thumb tendonitis or other [[repetitive strain injury]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n== Words per minute ==\n{{Contradicts other|date=April 2010|1=Words per minute}}\n{{further information|Words per minute}}\n[[Words per minute]] (WPM) is a measure of typing speed, commonly used in [[recruitment]]. For the purposes of WPM measurement a word is standardized to five characters or keystrokes. Therefore, \"brown\" counts as one word, but \"mozzarella\" counts as two.\n\nThe benefits of a standardized measurement of input speed are that it enables comparison across language and hardware boundaries. The speed of an [[Afrikaans]]-speaking operator in [[Cape Town]] can be compared with a [[French language|French]]-speaking operator in [[Paris]].\n\n=== Alphanumeric entry{{anchor|Alphanumeric entry}} ===\nIn one study of average computer users, the average rate for transcription was 33 words per minute, and 19 words per minute for composition.<ref>Karat, C.M., Halverson, C., Horn, D. and Karat, J.

An average professional [[Copy typist|typist]] reaches 50 to 80 wpm, while some positions can require 80 to 95 wpm (usually the minimum required for dispatch positions and other typing jobs), and some advanced typists work at speeds above 120 wpm.<ref name=\"Ayres&Martin\u00e1s2005\">{{citation |year=2005 |author=Ayres, Robert U |authorlink=Robert Ayres (scientist) |author2=Martin\u00e1s, Katalin |chapter=120 wpm for very skilled typist |page=41 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ksxK7J95IF8C&pg=PA41&dq=typists+%22120+words+per+minute%22#v=onepage&q=typists%20%22120%20words%20per%20minute%22&f=false |title=On the Reappraisal of Microeconomics: Economic Growth and Change in a Material World |place=Cheltenham, UK & Northampton, Massachusetts |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=1-84542-272-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ksxK7J95IF8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=reappraisal+microeconomics#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=22 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n |author            = Teresia R.

This is a common measurement for typing programs, or typing tutors, as it can give a more accurate measure of a person's typing speed without having to type for a prolonged period of time. The common conversion factor between WPM and CPM is 5. It is also used occasionally for associating the speed of a reader with the amount they have read. CPM has also been applied to 20th century printers, but modern faster printers more commonly use PPM (pages per minute).\n\nThe fastest typing speed ever, 216 words per minute, was achieved by Stella Pajunas-Garnand from Chicago in 1946 in one minute on an [[IBM Electric typewriter|IBM electric]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigsiteofamazingfacts.com/history-of-typewriters |title=History of Typewriters &#124; Big Site of Amazing Facts \u00ae |publisher=Bigsiteofamazingfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.owled.com/typing.html |title=World Records in Typing |publisher=Owled.com |date=2006-09-02 |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/modelb/modelb_4509PH04.html |title=IBM Archives: Typing posture |publisher=03.ibm.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deskstore.com/INFORMATION-1/en/Plan-Your-Office/Believe-it-or-not |title=Believe it or not ... |publisher=Deskstore.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref> using the [[QWERTY]] key layout.<ref>url=http://thekindle3books.com/qwerty-vs-dvorak-the-two-great-keyboards-the-time-were-born/</ref><ref>url=https://www.pond5.com/stock-footage/75268195/miss-stella-pajunas-worlds-fast-typist-types-ibm-electric-ty.html</ref> {{As of|2005}}, writer Barbara Blackburn was the fastest [[English language]] typist in the world, according to [[The Guinness Book of World Records]].

The two advantages of this technique include:\n\n* Participants are allowed to enter text naturally, since they may commit errors and correct them.\n* The identification of errors and generation of error rate statistics is easy to automate.\n\n==== Deconstructing the text input process ====\nThrough analysis of keystrokes, the keystrokes of the input stream were divided into four classes: Correct (C), Incorrect Fixed (IF), Fixes (F), and Incorrect Not Fixed (INF). These key stroke classification are broken down into the following\n\n* The two classes Correct and Incorrect Not Fixed comprise all of the characters in transcribed text. \n* Fixes (F) keystrokes are easy to identify, and include keystrokes such as backspace, delete, cursor movements, and modifier keys.\n* Incorrect Fixed (IF) keystrokes are found in the input stream, but not the transcribed text, and are not editing keys.\n\nUsing these classes, the Minimum String Distance Error Rate and the Key Strokes per Character statistics can both be calculated.\n\n==== Minimum string distance error rate ====\nThe minimum string distance (MSD) is the number of \"primitives\" which is the number of insertions, deletions, or substitutions to transform one string into another. The following equation was found for the MSD Error Rate\n\n''MSD Error Rate'' = <math>(INF/(C + INF)) * 100\\%</math>\n\n==== Key strokes per character (KSPC) ====\nWith the minimum string distance error, errors that are corrected do not appear in the transcribed text. The following example will show you why this is an important class of errors to consider:\n\n''Presented Text'':       the quick brown<br />\n''Input Stream'':         the quix<-ck brown<br />\n''Transcribed Text'':     the quick brown\n\nin the above example, the incorrect character ('x') was deleted with a backspace ('<-'). Since these errors do not appear in the transcribed text, the MSD error rate is 0%. This is why there is the key strokes per character (KSPC) statistic.\n\n''KSPC'' = <math>(C+INF+IF+F)/(C+INF)</math>\n\nThe three shortcomings of the KSPC statistic are listed below:\n\n* High KSPC values can be related to either many errors which were corrected, or few errors which were not corrected; however, there is no way to distinguish the two.\n* KSPC depend on the text input method, and cannot be used to meaningfully compare two different input methods, such as Qwerty-keyboard and a multi-tap input.\n* There is no obvious way to combine KSPC and MSD into an overall error rate, even though they have an inverse relationship.\n\n==== Further metrics ====\nUsing the classes described above, further metrics were defined by R. William Soukoreff and I.Scott MacKenzie:\n\n''Error correction efficiency'' refers to the ease with which the participant performed error correction.\n* ''Correction Efficiency'' = IF/F\n''Participant conscientiousness'' is the ratio of corrected errors to the total number of error, which helps distinguish perfectionists from apathetic participants.\n* ''Participant Conscientiousness'' = IF / (IF + INF)\nIf C represents the amount of useful information transferred, INF, IF, and F represent the proportion of bandwidth wasted.\n* ''Utilized Bandwidth'' = C / (C + INF + IF + F)<br />\n* ''Wasted Bandwidth'' = (INF + IF + F)/ (C + INF + IF + F)\n\n==== Total error rate ====\nThe classes described also provide an intuitive definition of total error rate:\n\n* ''Total Error Rate'' = ((INF + IF)/ (C + INF + IF)) * 100%\n* ''Not Corrected Error Rate'' = (INF/ (C + INF + IF)) * 100%\n* ''Corrected Error Rate'' = (IF/ (C + INF + IF)) * 100%\n\nSince these three error rates are ratios, they are comparable between different devices, something that cannot be done with the KSPC statistic, which is device dependent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soukoreff.com/academic/chi03 |title=Soukoreff, R.

The formation of the company known today as Sega is traced back to the founding of {{nihongo foot|Nihon Goraku Bussan|\u65e5\u672c\u5a2f\u697d\u7269\u7523\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|Nihon goraku bussan kabushiki gaisha|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha|extra=Japanese Amusement Products Co., Ltd.}}, which became known as {{nihongo foot|Sega Enterprises, Ltd.|\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30bb\u30ac\u30fb\u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bc\u30ba|Kabushiki gaisha Sega Entapuraizezu|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}} following acquisition of Rosen Enterprises in 1965. Originally an importer of [[Arcade game|coin-operated games]] to Japan and manufacturer of [[slot machine]]s and [[jukebox]]es, Sega began developing its own arcade games in 1966 with ''[[Periscope (arcade game)|Periscope]]'', which became a surprise success and led to more arcade machine development. In 1969 [[Gulf and Western Industries]] bought Sega, which continued its arcade game business through the 1970s.\n\nIn response to a downturn in the arcade-game [[Market (economics)|market]] in the early 1980s, Sega began to develop [[video game console]]s\u2014starting with the [[SG-1000]] and [[Master System]]\u2014but struggled against competing products such as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].  Around the same time, Sega executives [[David Rosen (businessman)|David Rosen]] and [[Hayao Nakayama]] executed a management buyout of the company with backing from [[SCSK|CSK Corporation]].  Sega released its next console, the [[Sega Genesis]] (known as the Mega Drive outside North America) in 1988. Although it initially struggled, the Genesis became a major success after the release of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' in 1991. Sega's marketing strategy, particularly in North America, helped the Genesis outsell main competitor [[Nintendo]] and their [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] for four consecutive Christmas seasons in the early 1990s.  While the [[Game Gear]] and [[Sega CD]] achieved less, Sega's arcade business was also successful into the mid 1990s.\n\nSega had [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failures]] in the second half of the decade with the [[32X]], [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]], and [[Dreamcast]], as Sega's market strategy changed and console newcomer [[Sony]] became dominant with the [[PlayStation]], in addition to further competition from Nintendo.  Sega's arcade business also struggled as home consoles became more popular than arcades.  A [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]] was attempted with [[Bandai]] during this time, but failed.  Following five years of losses, Sega exited the console hardware market in 2001 and became a [[Video game developer|third-party developer]] and publisher.  In 2001, Sega CEO and CSK chairman [[Isao Okawa]] died; his will forgave Sega's debts to him and returned his stock to the company, which helped Sega endure the transition financially.\n\nIn 2004, [[Sammy Corporation]] purchased a controlling interest in Sega through a [[takeover]], establishing the holding company [[Sega Sammy Holdings]]. Chairman [[Hajime Satomi]] announced that Sega would focus on its more successful arcade business and less on console games, returning the company to better profits. Sega has since been restructured again, with the establishment of Sega Holdings Co., Ltd. and the separation of its divisions into separate companies.\n\n==Company origins and arcade success (1940\u20131982)==\n[[File:Slot_machines_at_Wookey_Hole_Caves.JPG|left|thumb|Sega Diamond 3 Star]]\n\n=== Service Games and Nihon Goraku Bussan ===\nJewish-American businessman Irving Bromberg had been a major player in coin-op distribution since establishing the Irving Bromberg Company in New York in 1931.<ref name=\"Smith2019\">{{Cite book|title=They Create Worlds: The Story of the People and Companies That Shaped the Video Game Industry, Volume I|last=Smith|first=Alexander|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=2019|isbn=9781138389908|pages=101-102|ref=refSmith2019}}</ref> His son Marty, who changed his last name to Bromley, joined the business after graduating high school.

In 1940, Bromberg, Bromley, and family friend James Humpert formed Standard Games in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, to provide coin-operated amusement machines to military bases. In May 1945, Bromberg, Bromley, and Humpert established a second Hawaiian coin-op distributor called California Games, and they subsequently dissolved Standard Games that August.

He began importing coin-operated games to Japan, particularly focusing on hunting and shooting games.<ref name=\"NG2\" />\n\nRosen stated that he had to acquire a license from Japan's Ministry of Industrial Trade and Industry to import games, and that he had to pay a 200% duty on his imported machines, plus duties on the shipping.  As a result, importing games cost three times the cost of the machine.  Despite this, Rosen says his machines made enough to pay for their cost within two months of operation because of how many plays they were receiving.  He also claims that at his company's height, not a single Japanese city did not have one of his arcades there, and that he had a virtual monopoly for approximately two years.

According to former Sega director Akira Nagai, this led to Sega developing their own games as well.<ref name=\":62\" /> Sega's first release of their own manufactured electromechanical game was the submarine simulator game, ''[[Periscope (arcade game)|Periscope]]''. The game sported light and sound effects considered innovative for that time, eventually becoming quite successful in Japan. It was soon exported to both Europe and the United States and was placed in malls and department stores, becoming the first [[arcade game]] in the US to cost 25 cents per play. Sega was surprised by ''Periscope''{{'}}s success, and for the next two years, Sega produced between eight and ten games per year, exporting all of them.<ref>[[History of Sega#refHorowitz2018|Horowitz 2018]], pp. 10-11</ref> Despite this, rampant piracy in the industry would eventually lead to Sega stepping away from exporting its games.<ref name=\":112\">[[History of Sega#refHorowitz2018|Horowitz 2018]], pp. 14-17</ref> One such example occurred when Sega developed ''Jet Rocket''. According to Rosen, after its American release in 1970, it was cloned by three Chicago manufacturers. This negatively affected the game's market performance.<ref name=\"NG2\" />\n\n=== Ownership by Gulf and Western and public company status ===\nIn order to advance the company, Rosen had a goal to take the company [[Public company|public]], and decided this would be easier to accomplish in the United States than in Japan. Rosen was advised that this would be easiest accomplished by Sega being acquired by a larger company. In 1969, Sega was sold to American conglomerate [[Gulf and Western Industries]]. Bromley and Stewart sold their shares, 80% of the company, for a total of US$10 million, while LeMaire retained his 20%.  As a condition of the sale, Rosen was to remain CEO of the company until at least 1972.<ref name=\":112\" />  According to Martin Bromley's daughter Lauran, her father\u2014who was in his fifties at the time\u2014and the other owners saw the sale as an opportunity to retire.<ref name=\"Kent2\" />  Six months later, with the deal done, Bromley joined with Stewart to form a company called [[Sega, S.A.

Sega Enterprises, Ltd. became a subsidiary of this new company, which Gulf & Western chairman [[Charles Bluhdorn]] hoped would become a powerful Asian conglomerate. The conglomerating attempt failed, but Rosen continued to develop his relationship with Bluhdorn, who took Sega Enterprises Ltd. public in the United States in 1974 by making it a subsidiary of an existing publicly traded corporation owned by Gulf & Western called the Polly Bergen Company. Rosen was appointed CEO of Polly Bergen, which was renamed Sega Enterprises, Inc. Sega Enterprises, Ltd. executive vice president Harry Kane took control of day-to-day operations at the Japanese subsidiary.

While Sega was not initially considering expansion into Europe, the company reconsidered after being contacted by Victor Leslie, a coin-op seller in the United Kingdom.  Leslie was placed in charge of a new Sega office in London, to be named Sega Europe Ltd.  Sega Europe would be the company's marketing base on the continent.<ref>[[History of Sega#refHorowitz2018|Horowitz 2018]], pp. 76-77</ref> \n\nSega re-entered the North American arcade market in 1985 with the establishment of another new division at the end of a deal with Bally.  With Sega Electronics, Inc. no longer in existence, Rosen and Nakayama hired Gene Lipkin to head the new division, Sega Enterprises USA, based in [[San Jose, California]].  Lipkin had previously worked for Atari and [[Exidy]].  Lipkin's new sales team head, Tom Petit, had previously worked for Nintendo and [[Data East]].  The new subsidiary started with 22 employees, US$500,000 in start-up revenue, and operated out of Lipkin's old employer's facilities until Sega's new facility was ready in August 1985.  The release of ''[[Hang-On]]'' in 1985 would prove successful in the region, becoming so popular that Sega struggled to keep up with demand for the game.  In May 1986, Lipkin resigned due to health issues; Petit eventually took control of the division.  Sega Enterprises USA held a rivalry with Sega Europe, as the North American division quickly outgrew the European one.<ref>[[History of Sega#refHorowitz2018|Horowitz 2018]], pp. 85-89</ref>  \n\nIn 1986, Sega of America was established to manage the company's consumer products in North America.  Rosen and Nakayama hired Bruce Lowry, Nintendo of America's vice president of sales.  Lowry was persuaded to change companies because Sega would allow him to start his new office in [[San Francisco]].  He chose the name \"Sega of America\" for his division because he had worked for Nintendo of America and liked the combination of words.  Initially, Sega of America was tasked with repackaging the Master System for a Western release, although distribution of the console would later be given to Tonka.  During this time, much of Sega of America's new infrastructure was temporarily shut down.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Horowitz|first=Ken|title=Playing at the Next Level: A History of American Sega Games|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2016|isbn=9781476625577|location=|pages=6-15}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1986, Sega purchased the Time-Out chain of arcades to which they had previously sold Sega Center, and rebranded them as \"Sega's Time-Out\".  The purchase included 74 locations in United States shopping malls.  While Sega had initially announced their intent to have over 100 locations by 1990, changing conditions in the arcade market would lead to Sega selling the chain to Edison Brothers, Inc. in June 1990.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n==Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and mainstream success (1989\u20131994)==\n{{Main|Sega Genesis|}}[[File:Sega-Genesis-Mod2-Set.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sega Genesis]], second North American version]]Sega released the Master System's successor, the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]], in Japan on October 29, 1988, though the launch was overshadowed by Nintendo's release of ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' a week earlier.

Although Kalinske initially knew little about the video game market, he surrounded himself with industry-savvy advisors. A believer in the [[razor and blades business model]], he developed a four-point plan: cut the price of the console, create a U.S.-based team to develop games targeted at the American market, continue and expand the aggressive advertising campaigns, and replace the bundled game ''[[Altered Beast]]'' with a new game, ''Sonic the Hedgehog''.<ref name=\"Kent_pp424_431\" /> The Japanese board of directors initially disapproved of the plan, but all four points were approved by Nakayama, who told Kalinske, \"I hired you to make the decisions for Europe and the Americas, so go ahead and do it.\"<ref name=\"Retroinspection5\" /> Magazines praised ''Sonic'' as one of the greatest games yet made, and Sega's console finally became successful.<ref name=\"Kent_pp424_431\" /> In large part due to the popularity of ''Sonic the Hedgehog'', the Sega Genesis outsold its main competitor, Nintendo's [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], in the United States nearly two to one during the 1991 holiday season. This success led to Sega having control of 65% of the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit]] [[Video game console|console]] market in January 1992, making it the first time Nintendo was not the console leader since December 1985.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|date=January 2002|title=This Month in Gaming History|url=|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|publisher=[[GameStop]]|volume=12|issue=105|page=117|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nTo compete with Nintendo, Sega was more open to new types of games than its rival, but still tightly controlled the approval process for third-party games and charged high prices for cartridge manufacturing.<ref name=\"reeder199211\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=100|title=Why Edutainment Doesn't Make It In A Videogame World|last=Reeder|first=Sara|date=November 1992|work=Computer Gaming World|accessdate=July 5, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702235552/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=100|archivedate=July 2, 2014|url-status=live|page=128}}</ref> Technicians from American third-party video game publisher [[Electronic Arts]] (EA) reverse engineered the Genesis in 1989,<ref name=\"Electronic Arts Does\">[[History of Sega#refKent2001|Kent 2001]], p. 408-410</ref> following nearly one year of negotiations with Sega in which EA requested a more liberal licensing agreement than was standard in the industry before releasing its games for the system.<ref name=\"Reverse Engineering Success\">{{cite magazine|last=Bertz|first=Matt|date=July 2011|title=Reverse Engineering Success|url=|magazine=Game Informer|publisher=GameStop|volume=21|issue=219|pages=96\u201399|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> As a result, EA signed what founder [[Trip Hawkins]] described as \"a very unusual and much more enlightened license agreement\" with Sega in June 1990: \"Among other things, we had the right to make as many titles as we wanted.

Sato, a 30-year veteran of Sega, had previously developed Sega's video game consoles.  Because of poor sales in 2002, Sega was forced to cut its profit forecast by 90% for 2003.  As a result, Sega began to look at opportunities for a merger to fix its financial situation. In 2003, Sega began talks with [[Sammy Corporation]] and Namco.  Sato stated that he would select the partner that fit the business best.  Sega made an announcement on February 13, 2003, of its decision to merge with Sammy.  However, as late as April 17 of the same year, Sega was still in talks with Namco, which was attempting to overturn the merger and went public with its offer to be acquired.  Sega's consideration of Namco's offer upset executives of Sammy.  However, the day after Sega announced it was no longer planning to merge with Sammy, Namco withdrew its offer.

The formation of the company known today as Sega is traced back to the founding of {{nihongo foot|Nihon Goraku Bussan|\u65e5\u672c\u5a2f\u697d\u7269\u7523\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|Nihon goraku bussan kabushiki gaisha|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha|extra=Japanese Amusement Products Co., Ltd.}}, which became known as {{nihongo foot|Sega Enterprises, Ltd.|\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30bb\u30ac\u30fb\u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bc\u30ba|Kabushiki gaisha Sega Entapuraizezu|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}} following acquisition of Rosen Enterprises in 1965. Originally an importer of [[Arcade game|coin-operated games]] to Japan and manufacturer of [[slot machine]]s and [[jukebox]]es, Sega began developing its own arcade games in 1966 with ''[[Periscope (arcade game)|Periscope]]'', which became a surprise success and led to more arcade machine development. In 1969 [[Gulf and Western Industries]] bought Sega, which continued its arcade game business through the 1970s.\n\nIn response to a downturn in the arcade-game [[Market (economics)|market]] in the early 1980s, Sega began to develop [[video game console]]s\u2014starting with the [[SG-1000]] and [[Master System]]\u2014but struggled against competing products such as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].  Around the same time, Sega executives [[David Rosen (businessman)|David Rosen]] and [[Hayao Nakayama]] executed a management buyout of the company with backing from [[SCSK|CSK Corporation]].  Sega released its next console, the [[Sega Genesis]] (known as the Mega Drive outside North America) in 1988. Although it initially struggled, the Genesis became a major success after the release of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' in 1991. Sega's marketing strategy, particularly in North America, helped the Genesis outsell main competitor [[Nintendo]] and their [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] for four consecutive Christmas seasons in the early 1990s.  While the [[Game Gear]] and [[Sega CD]] achieved less, Sega's arcade business was also successful into the mid 1990s.\n\nSega had [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failures]] in the second half of the decade with the [[32X]], [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]], and [[Dreamcast]], as Sega's market strategy changed and console newcomer [[Sony]] became dominant with the [[PlayStation]], in addition to further competition from Nintendo.  Sega's arcade business also struggled as home consoles became more popular than arcades.  A [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]] was attempted with [[Bandai]] during this time, but failed.  Following five years of losses, Sega exited the console hardware market in 2001 and became a [[Video game developer|third-party developer]] and publisher.  In 2001, Sega CEO and CSK chairman [[Isao Okawa]] died; his will forgave Sega's debts to him and returned his stock to the company, which helped Sega endure the transition financially.\n\nIn 2004, [[Sammy Corporation]] purchased a controlling interest in Sega through a [[takeover]], establishing the holding company [[Sega Sammy Holdings]]. Chairman [[Hajime Satomi]] announced that Sega would focus on its more successful arcade business and less on console games, returning the company to better profits. Sega has since been restructured again, with the establishment of Sega Holdings Co., Ltd. and the separation of its divisions into separate companies.\n\n==Company origins and arcade success (1940\u20131982)==\n[[File:Slot_machines_at_Wookey_Hole_Caves.JPG|left|thumb|Sega Diamond 3 Star]]\n\n=== Service Games and Nihon Goraku Bussan ===\nJewish-American businessman Irving Bromberg had been a major player in coin-op distribution since establishing the Irving Bromberg Company in New York in 1931.<ref name=\"Smith2019\">{{Cite book|title=They Create Worlds: The Story of the People and Companies That Shaped the Video Game Industry, Volume I|last=Smith|first=Alexander|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=2019|isbn=9781138389908|pages=101-102|ref=refSmith2019}}</ref> His son Marty, who changed his last name to Bromley, joined the business after graduating high school.

As a result, importing games cost three times the cost of the machine.  Despite this, Rosen says his machines made enough to pay for their cost within two months of operation because of how many plays they were receiving.  He also claims that at his company's height, not a single Japanese city did not have one of his arcades there, and that he had a virtual monopoly for approximately two years.

According to former Sega director Akira Nagai, this led to Sega developing their own games as well.<ref name=\":62\" /> Sega's first release of their own manufactured electromechanical game was the submarine simulator game, ''[[Periscope (arcade game)|Periscope]]''. The game sported light and sound effects considered innovative for that time, eventually becoming quite successful in Japan. It was soon exported to both Europe and the United States and was placed in malls and department stores, becoming the first [[arcade game]] in the US to cost 25 cents per play. Sega was surprised by ''Periscope''{{'}}s success, and for the next two years, Sega produced between eight and ten games per year, exporting all of them.<ref>[[History of Sega#refHorowitz2018|Horowitz 2018]], pp. 10-11</ref> Despite this, rampant piracy in the industry would eventually lead to Sega stepping away from exporting its games.<ref name=\":112\">[[History of Sega#refHorowitz2018|Horowitz 2018]], pp. 14-17</ref> One such example occurred when Sega developed ''Jet Rocket''.

This negatively affected the game's market performance.<ref name=\"NG2\" />\n\n=== Ownership by Gulf and Western and public company status ===\nIn order to advance the company, Rosen had a goal to take the company [[Public company|public]], and decided this would be easier to accomplish in the United States than in Japan.

Sega Enterprises, Ltd. became a subsidiary of this new company, which Gulf & Western chairman [[Charles Bluhdorn]] hoped would become a powerful Asian conglomerate. The conglomerating attempt failed, but Rosen continued to develop his relationship with Bluhdorn, who took Sega Enterprises Ltd. public in the United States in 1974 by making it a subsidiary of an existing publicly traded corporation owned by Gulf & Western called the Polly Bergen Company. Rosen was appointed CEO of Polly Bergen, which was renamed Sega Enterprises, Inc.

While Sega was not initially considering expansion into Europe, the company reconsidered after being contacted by Victor Leslie, a coin-op seller in the United Kingdom.  Leslie was placed in charge of a new Sega office in London, to be named Sega Europe Ltd.  Sega Europe would be the company's marketing base on the continent.<ref>[[History of Sega#refHorowitz2018|Horowitz 2018]], pp. 76-77</ref> \n\nSega re-entered the North American arcade market in 1985 with the establishment of another new division at the end of a deal with Bally.  With Sega Electronics, Inc. no longer in existence, Rosen and Nakayama hired Gene Lipkin to head the new division, Sega Enterprises USA, based in [[San Jose, California]].  Lipkin had previously worked for Atari and [[Exidy]].  Lipkin's new sales team head, Tom Petit, had previously worked for Nintendo and [[Data East]].  The new subsidiary started with 22 employees, US$500,000 in start-up revenue, and operated out of Lipkin's old employer's facilities until Sega's new facility was ready in August 1985.  The release of ''[[Hang-On]]'' in 1985 would prove successful in the region, becoming so popular that Sega struggled to keep up with demand for the game.  In May 1986, Lipkin resigned due to health issues; Petit eventually took control of the division.  Sega Enterprises USA held a rivalry with Sega Europe, as the North American division quickly outgrew the European one.<ref>[[History of Sega#refHorowitz2018|Horowitz 2018]], pp. 85-89</ref>  \n\nIn 1986, Sega of America was established to manage the company's consumer products in North America.  Rosen and Nakayama hired Bruce Lowry, Nintendo of America's vice president of sales.  Lowry was persuaded to change companies because Sega would allow him to start his new office in [[San Francisco]].  He chose the name \"Sega of America\" for his division because he had worked for Nintendo of America and liked the combination of words.  Initially, Sega of America was tasked with repackaging the Master System for a Western release, although distribution of the console would later be given to Tonka.  During this time, much of Sega of America's new infrastructure was temporarily shut down.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Horowitz|first=Ken|title=Playing at the Next Level: A History of American Sega Games|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2016|isbn=9781476625577|location=|pages=6-15}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1986, Sega purchased the Time-Out chain of arcades to which they had previously sold Sega Center, and rebranded them as \"Sega's Time-Out\".  The purchase included 74 locations in United States shopping malls.  While Sega had initially announced their intent to have over 100 locations by 1990, changing conditions in the arcade market would lead to Sega selling the chain to Edison Brothers, Inc. in June 1990.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n==Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and mainstream success (1989\u20131994)==\n{{Main|Sega Genesis|}}[[File:Sega-Genesis-Mod2-Set.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sega Genesis]], second North American version]]Sega released the Master System's successor, the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]], in Japan on October 29, 1988, though the launch was overshadowed by Nintendo's release of ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' a week earlier.

Although Kalinske initially knew little about the video game market, he surrounded himself with industry-savvy advisors. A believer in the [[razor and blades business model]], he developed a four-point plan: cut the price of the console, create a U.S.-based team to develop games targeted at the American market, continue and expand the aggressive advertising campaigns, and replace the bundled game ''[[Altered Beast]]'' with a new game, ''Sonic the Hedgehog''.<ref name=\"Kent_pp424_431\" /> The Japanese board of directors initially disapproved of the plan, but all four points were approved by Nakayama, who told Kalinske, \"I hired you to make the decisions for Europe and the Americas, so go ahead and do it.\"<ref name=\"Retroinspection5\" /> Magazines praised ''Sonic'' as one of the greatest games yet made, and Sega's console finally became successful.<ref name=\"Kent_pp424_431\" /> In large part due to the popularity of ''Sonic the Hedgehog'', the Sega Genesis outsold its main competitor, Nintendo's [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], in the United States nearly two to one during the 1991 holiday season. This success led to Sega having control of 65% of the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit]] [[Video game console|console]] market in January 1992, making it the first time Nintendo was not the console leader since December 1985.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|date=January 2002|title=This Month in Gaming History|url=|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|publisher=[[GameStop]]|volume=12|issue=105|page=117|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nTo compete with Nintendo, Sega was more open to new types of games than its rival, but still tightly controlled the approval process for third-party games and charged high prices for cartridge manufacturing.<ref name=\"reeder199211\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=100|title=Why Edutainment Doesn't Make It In A Videogame World|last=Reeder|first=Sara|date=November 1992|work=Computer Gaming World|accessdate=July 5, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702235552/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=100|archivedate=July 2, 2014|url-status=live|page=128}}</ref> Technicians from American third-party video game publisher [[Electronic Arts]] (EA) reverse engineered the Genesis in 1989,<ref name=\"Electronic Arts Does\">[[History of Sega#refKent2001|Kent 2001]], p. 408-410</ref> following nearly one year of negotiations with Sega in which EA requested a more liberal licensing agreement than was standard in the industry before releasing its games for the system.<ref name=\"Reverse Engineering Success\">{{cite magazine|last=Bertz|first=Matt|date=July 2011|title=Reverse Engineering Success|url=|magazine=Game Informer|publisher=GameStop|volume=21|issue=219|pages=96\u201399|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> As a result, EA signed what founder [[Trip Hawkins]] described as \"a very unusual and much more enlightened license agreement\" with Sega in June 1990: \"Among other things, we had the right to make as many titles as we wanted.

Sato, a 30-year veteran of Sega, had previously developed Sega's video game consoles.  Because of poor sales in 2002, Sega was forced to cut its profit forecast by 90% for 2003.  As a result, Sega began to look at opportunities for a merger to fix its financial situation. In 2003, Sega began talks with [[Sammy Corporation]] and Namco.  Sato stated that he would select the partner that fit the business best.  Sega made an announcement on February 13, 2003, of its decision to merge with Sammy.  However, as late as April 17 of the same year, Sega was still in talks with Namco, which was attempting to overturn the merger and went public with its offer to be acquired.  Sega's consideration of Namco's offer upset executives of Sammy.  However, the day after Sega announced it was no longer planning to merge with Sammy, Namco withdrew its offer.
