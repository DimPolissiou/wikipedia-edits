The bungalow is looked after by caretaker Parameswaran and his Tamil wife Kannamma. Parameswaran has a son Gopan who stays away from the place and does guide work for foreigners. Parameswaran has told both of them that Jaysree is Das' wife to avoid ill-fame to the family name. Das feels he owns Jaysree and does not waste a single opportunity to ridicule her profession. Other than sex, there is no emotional bond between them. A family friend of Das' late father, Panikkar and family drop by to meet Das' wife which makes Das uncomfortable. Though Jaysree refuses at first to play the role, she then acts as a dutiful wife before them. Panikkar's family consists of his wife Chinnammu Amma, father-in-law Rao Bahadur Shankaramenon, and two daughters, elder one being Nirmala married to engineer Ramakrishnan and younger one Sridevi who is separated from her husband. Two relations build up simultaneously. On one side, Sridevi is able to bring back the fondness of music in Das and they spent time understanding each other. On the other side, Jaysree feels Gopan is like herself, a victim of helplessness and she becomes attached to him. Things take a turn when, after a moment of passion, Jaysree tells the truth about herself to Gopan and he feels a revulsion towards her. Meanwhile, Das confesses his womanising nature to Sridevi and then proposes to her but she is unable to commit to him. Finally, Jaysree leaves the house and Gopan joins her in her journey. Sridevi's separated husband Vijayshankar apologises to her for his insensitive behaviour and she goes back to him. In the end, Das drives off from the place, all alone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Mammootty]] as Das\n*[[Rajalakshmi]] as Sreedevi\n*[[Swapna (actress)|Swapna]] as Jayasree\n*[[Kaviyoor Ponnamma]] as Chinammu Amma\n*Beena\n*[[Jose Prakash]] as Panikkar\n*[[Ratheesh]] as Vijayshankar\n*[[Sankaradi]] as Parameswaran\n*[[Rajkumar Sethupathi|Rajkumar]] as Gopakumar\n*[[Lalu Alex]] as Ramakrishnan\n*[[Mallika Sukumaran]] as Kannamma \n*[[Premji]] as Raobahadur Shankaramenon\n{{colend}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe music was composed by [[Shyam (composer)|Shyam]] and the lyrics were written by [[Bichu Thirumala]].\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCF\" align=\"center\"\n| '''No.''' || '''Song''' || '''Singers''' ||'''Lyrics''' || '''Length (m:ss)'''\n|-\n| 1 || \"Alakal Malarithalukal\" || [[Unni Menon]], Chorus || [[Bichu Thirumala]] || \n|-\n| 2 || \"Etho Sanketham\" || [[K.

The bungalow is looked after by caretaker Parameswaran and his Tamil wife Kannamma. Parameswaran has a son Gopan who stays away from the place and does guide work for foreigners. Parameswaran has told both of them that Jaysree is Das' wife to avoid ill-fame to the family name. Das feels he owns Jaysree and does not waste a single opportunity to ridicule her profession. Other than sex, there is no emotional bond between them. A family friend of Das' late father, Panikkar and family drop by to meet Das' wife which makes Das uncomfortable. Though Jaysree refuses at first to play the role, she then acts as a dutiful wife before them. Panikkar's family consists of his wife Chinnammu Amma, father-in-law Rao Bahadur Shankaramenon, and two daughters, elder one being Nirmala married to engineer Ramakrishnan and younger one Sridevi who is separated from her husband. Two relations build up simultaneously. On one side, Sridevi is able to bring back the fondness of music in Das and they spent time understanding each other. On the other side, Jaysree feels Gopan is like herself, a victim of helplessness and she becomes attached to him. Things take a turn when, after a moment of passion, Jaysree tells the truth about herself to Gopan and he feels a revulsion towards her. Meanwhile, Das confesses his womanising nature to Sridevi and then proposes to her but she is unable to commit to him. Finally, Jaysree leaves the house and Gopan joins her in her journey. Sridevi's separated husband Vijayshankar apologises to her for his insensitive behaviour and she goes back to him. In the end, Das drives off from the place, all alone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Mammootty]] as Das\n*[[Rajalakshmi]] as Sreedevi\n*[[Swapna (actress)|Swapna]] as Jayasree\n*[[Kaviyoor Ponnamma]] as Chinammu Amma\n*Beena\n*[[Jose Prakash]] as Panikkar\n*[[Ratheesh]] as Vijayshankar\n*[[Sankaradi]] as Parameswaran\n*[[Rajkumar Sethupathi|Rajkumar]] as Gopakumar\n*[[Lalu Alex]] as Ramakrishnan\n*[[Mallika Sukumaran]] as Kannamma \n*[[Premji]] as Raobahadur Shankaramenon\n{{colend}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe music was composed by [[Shyam (composer)|Shyam]] and the lyrics were written by [[Bichu Thirumala]]. \n\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCF\" align=\"center\"\n| '''No.''' || '''Song''' || '''Singers''' ||'''Lyrics''' || '''Length (m:ss)'''\n|-\n| 1 || \"Alakal Malarithalukal\" || [[Unni Menon]], Chorus || [[Bichu Thirumala]] || \n|-\n| 2 || \"Etho Sanketham\" || [[K.

The highway crosses the state border from [[New Lebanon, New York]], into [[Hancock, Massachusetts]], and runs eastward into [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], where it ends at [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] in [[Kenmore Square]]. It spends the vast majority of its journey paralleling the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], which has largely superseded US-20 for through travel. Still, US-20 directly serves many towns and local business areas which the Turnpike bypasses.<ref name=\"homepage.mac.com\">[http://homepage.mac.com/kefkafloyd/valleyroads/us20.html Roads and Highways of the Pioneer Valley - US 20]</ref>\n\nU.S. Route 20 is the longest numbered highway in the entire country and also holds the distinction of being the longest numbered highway in the state, edging out [[Massachusetts Route 28|Route 28]] by merely a mile (Route 28 is {{convert|151.92|mi|km}} long).<ref name=inventory/>\n\nParts of US 20 between the [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] and Boston areas were also an alignment of the [[Boston Post Road]], an early colonial highway designated in 1673 for carrying mail between [[New York City]] and Boston.<ref>S.H.

The highway enters town and meets [[U.S. Route 7 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 7]], near the western end of the cross-state [[Massachusetts Route 9|Route 9]]. US-20 turns south along US-7, and the two routes form a concurrency into the town of [[Lenox, Massachusetts|Lenox]]. In Lenox, [[Massachusetts Route 7A|Route 7A]] splits off to serve the center of town, and US-20 splits from US-7 shortly thereafter to serve the town of [[Lee, Massachusetts|Lee]] to the southeast. The highway passes through town and interchanges with the Mass Pike at Exit 2 south of town, near the eastern end of [[Massachusetts Route 102|Route 102]]. US-20 turns to the east at this point, and closely parallels the Mass Pike for several miles, before entering the town of [[Becket, Massachusetts|Becket]] and meeting [[Massachusetts Route 8|Route 8]]. Route 8 northbound joins US-20 east to directly serve the town, while the Mass Pike passes south of Becket. Upon crossing through the town center, Route 8 splits from US-20, and the federal highway continues eastbound, passing into the town of [[Chester, Massachusetts|Chester]] in [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden County]].\n\nUS-20 passes through the small town of Chester, and clips the southern portion of [[Huntington, Massachusetts|Huntington]] in [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire County]] before re-entering Hampden County and the town of [[Russell, Massachusetts|Russell]]. US-20 passes through Russell, passes under the Mass Pike and meets the eastern end of [[Massachusetts Route 23|Route 23]], and continues into [[Westfield, Massachusetts|Westfield]]. US-20 crosses the [[U.S. Route 202]]/[[Massachusetts Route 10|Route 10]] concurrency in the center of the town, and intersects the northern end of [[Massachusetts Route 187|Route 187]] just to the east. US-20 begins to enter urban landscape as it crosses into [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield]], making its way through the streets, intersecting [[U.S. Route 5 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 5]], and crossing the [[Connecticut River]] into the city of [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]]. Immediately upon entering the city, US-20 interchanges with [[Interstate 91]] at Exit 8, where it leaves the surface street (which is picked up by Route 20A, to join [[Interstate 291 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 291]], which begins just to the south. ''(Note: Route 20A is NOT a former alignment of US-20. Before the construction of I-291, US-20 followed Main, State Streets, and Boston Road)''. US-20 is overlapped over most of I-291, running on the Interstate for about {{convert|5|mi|km}}, and leaving via Exit 5,<ref name=\"homepage.mac.com\"/> where it meets the eastern end of Route 20A and resumes its surface alignment on Page Boulevard in Springfield, rejoining its original alignment in Springfield on Boston Road. US-20, as Boston Road, crosses [[Massachusetts Route 21|Route 21]] and proceeds east into the town of [[Wilbraham, Massachusetts|Wilbraham]], where it goes back to paralleling the Mass Pike for several more miles, until entering [[Palmer, Massachusetts|Palmer]]. In Palmer, US-20 meets the southern end of [[Massachusetts Route 181|Route 181]] and then intersects [[Massachusetts Route 32|Route 32]], which provides close access to the Mass Pike at Exit 8. US-20 and Route 32 share a short concurrency in Palmer, before US-20 splits east. Before leaving Palmer, [[Massachusetts Route 67|Route 67]] meets its southern end at US-20.  [[Brimfield, Massachusetts|Brimfield]] is the last town US-20 passes through in Hampden County; it enters from the west, crosses [[Massachusetts Route 19|Route 19]] in the center of town, and proceeds out of town to the east.\n\n===Worcester and Middlesex counties===\nUS-20 crosses into [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]] and the town of [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts|Sturbridge]], immediately meeting the southern end of [[Massachusetts Route 148|Route 148]]. The route continues east where it meets the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 131|Route 131]] before interchanging with [[Interstate 84 in Massachusetts|Interstate 84]] at Exit 3. I-84 is another quick route to the Mass Pike, as it ends there less than a mile to the northeast.  [[Massachusetts Route 49|Route 49]], a short connector to Route 9 in [[Spencer, Massachusetts|Spencer]], has its southern terminus at US-20 east of the I-84 interchange. US-20 enters the town of [[Charlton, Massachusetts|Charlton]] at this point, passing through Charlton City where it meets the northern end of [[Massachusetts Route 169|Route 169]] and crosses over [[Massachusetts Route 31|Route 31]]. Continuing east, US-20 enters the city of [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]], south of [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], where it briefly overlaps [[Massachusetts Route 12|Route 12]]. Route 12 provides direct access to the Mass Pike at Exit 10, while US-20 directly interchanges with [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut-Massachusetts)|Interstate 395]], which becomes [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 290]] north of the Mass Pike interchange. US-20 continues to the northeast, entering [[Millbury, Massachusetts|Millbury]] after briefly crossing into [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], where it interchanges with the Mass Pike at Exit 10A, as well as with [[Massachusetts Route 146|Route 146]] (which at this point is overlapped by [[Massachusetts Route 122A|Route 122A]]). The route re-enters Worcester, crossing over [[Massachusetts Route 122|Route 122]], which provides access to the Mass Pike at Exit 11. Leaving Worcester, US-20 enters the town of [[Shrewsbury, Massachusetts|Shrewsbury]], interchanging with [[Massachusetts Route 140|Route 140]] south of town. The highway continues to the northeast, passing southwest of Shrewsbury, and interchanging with Route 9. Heading almost due north at this point, US-20 crosses into [[Northborough, Massachusetts|Northborough]], and turns back eastward, intersecting the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 135|Route 135]] in the town center. Two local roads, Church Street and Hudson Street, provide access to nearby I-290, which runs to the north. US-20 proceeds out of Northborough to the northeast, crossing into [[Marlborough, Massachusetts|Marlborough]] and [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]].\n\nUS-20 enters Marlborough and interchanges with [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] (also referred to as the Outer Circumferential Highway) at Exit 24 west of town, effectively crossing into Boston's western suburbs. The route directly serves the center of town, crossing [[Massachusetts Route 85|Route 85]] in the process. It is in eastern Marlborough where US-20 begins to be famously referred to as [[Boston Post Road]], and the road continues eastward into the town of [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]]. US-20 passes through the southern part of the town, crossing over the [[Massachusetts Route 27|Route 27]]/[[Massachusetts Route 126|Route 126]] concurrency in [[Wayland, Massachusetts|Wayland]], and continues into [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]. US-20 does not intersect any major roads or numbered highways in Weston, but does follow an approximately mile-long bypass of the Boston Post Road (appropriately named Boston Post Road Bypass) between Highland Street and Wellesley Street, where US-20 rejoins the road and continues east into [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]].  The entire length of US-20 in Weston is designated as the [[Boston Post Road Historic District (Weston, Massachusetts)|Boston Post Road Historic District]], since it retains much of its rural 18th-century character. Immediately upon crossing into Waltham, US-20 enters a rotary interchange with [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] ([[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]]) at Exit 26, marking the change from suburban landscape to the urban landscape of metro Boston and having access to the Mass Pike. US-20 meets the eastern end of [[Massachusetts Route 117|Route 117]] and cuts through the center of Waltham, serving as Main Street east of Route 117. US-20 also meets the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 60|Route 60]], an urban highway serving Boston's northern suburbs, in Waltham. The highway continues into the city of [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] serving as its Main Street to Watertown Square, where it has a major junction with [[Massachusetts Route 16|Route 16]], which passes west and north of Boston via various parkways on the edges of the city, through [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] and [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]]. US-20 becomes North Beacon Street at this point and continues southeast as it crosses into the city of [[Boston]] over the [[North Beacon Street Bridge]].\n\n===Suffolk County===\n[[File:US20end.jpg|thumb|left|250px|US&nbsp;20 eastbound approaching Kenmore Square, Boston]]\n[[File:Rt 20 sign.jpg|thumb|right|Eastern terminus sign of U.S. Route 20 in Boston, MA]]\n\nUS-20 briefly continues as Leo F. Birmingham Parkway upon crossing into the Boston neighborhood of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], immediately intersecting the western end of [[Soldiers Field Road]] Extension, before it turns right and continues as North Beacon Street again, and crosses under the Mass Pike (no interchange). US-20 continues towards downtown, passing through the [[Allston]] neighborhood of Boston. Upon crossing Cambridge Street, US-20 becomes Brighton Ave for a short distance. US-20 soon reaches [[Commonwealth Avenue, Boston|Commonwealth Ave]], and takes the eastbound routing over for [[Massachusetts Route 30|Route 30]], which ends at the intersection.

The highway enters town and meets [[U.S. Route 7 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 7]], near the western end of the cross-state [[Massachusetts Route 9|Route 9]]. US-20 turns south along US-7, and the two routes form a concurrency into the town of [[Lenox, Massachusetts|Lenox]]. In Lenox, [[Massachusetts Route 7A|Route 7A]] splits off to serve the center of town, and US-20 splits from US-7 shortly thereafter to serve the town of [[Lee, Massachusetts|Lee]] to the southeast. The highway passes through town and interchanges with the Mass Pike at Exit 2 south of town, near the eastern end of [[Massachusetts Route 102|Route 102]]. US-20 turns to the east at this point, and closely parallels the Mass Pike for several miles, before entering the town of [[Becket, Massachusetts|Becket]] and meeting [[Massachusetts Route 8|Route 8]]. Route 8 northbound joins US-20 east to directly serve the town, while the Mass Pike passes south of Becket. Upon crossing through the town center, Route 8 splits from US-20, and the federal highway continues eastbound, passing into the town of [[Chester, Massachusetts|Chester]] in [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden County]].\n\nUS-20 passes through the small town of Chester, and clips the southern portion of [[Huntington, Massachusetts|Huntington]] in [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire County]] before re-entering Hampden County and the town of [[Russell, Massachusetts|Russell]]. US-20 passes through Russell, passes under the Mass Pike and meets the eastern end of [[Massachusetts Route 23|Route 23]], and continues into [[Westfield, Massachusetts|Westfield]]. US-20 crosses the [[U.S. Route 202]]/[[Massachusetts Route 10|Route 10]] concurrency in the center of the town, and intersects the northern end of [[Massachusetts Route 187|Route 187]] just to the east. US-20 begins to enter urban landscape as it crosses into [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield]], making its way through the streets, intersecting [[U.S. Route 5 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 5]], and crossing the [[Connecticut River]] into the city of [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]]. Immediately upon entering the city, US-20 interchanges with [[Interstate 91]] at Exit 8, where it leaves the surface street (which is picked up by Route 20A, to join [[Interstate 291 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 291]], which begins just to the south. ''(Note: Route 20A is NOT a former alignment of US-20. Before the construction of I-291, US-20 followed Main, State Streets, and Boston Road)''. US-20 is overlapped over most of I-291, running on the Interstate for about {{convert|5|mi|km}}, and leaving via Exit 5,<ref name=\"homepage.mac.com\"/> where it meets the eastern end of Route 20A and resumes its surface alignment on Page Boulevard in Springfield, rejoining its original alignment in Springfield on Boston Road. US-20, as Boston Road, crosses [[Massachusetts Route 21|Route 21]] and proceeds east into the town of [[Wilbraham, Massachusetts|Wilbraham]], where it goes back to paralleling the Mass Pike for several more miles, until entering [[Palmer, Massachusetts|Palmer]]. In Palmer, US-20 meets the southern end of [[Massachusetts Route 181|Route 181]] and then intersects [[Massachusetts Route 32|Route 32]], which provides close access to the Mass Pike at Exit 8. US-20 and Route 32 share a short concurrency in Palmer, before US-20 splits east. Before leaving Palmer, [[Massachusetts Route 67|Route 67]] meets its southern end at US-20.  [[Brimfield, Massachusetts|Brimfield]] is the last town US-20 passes through in Hampden County; it enters from the west, crosses [[Massachusetts Route 19|Route 19]] in the center of town, and proceeds out of town to the east.\n\n===Worcester and Middlesex counties===\nUS-20 crosses into [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]] and the town of [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts|Sturbridge]], immediately meeting the southern end of [[Massachusetts Route 148|Route 148]]. The route continues east where it meets the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 131|Route 131]] before interchanging with [[Interstate 84 in Massachusetts|Interstate 84]] at Exit 3. I-84 is another quick route to the Mass Pike, as it ends there less than a mile to the northeast.  [[Massachusetts Route 49|Route 49]], a short connector to Route 9 in [[Spencer, Massachusetts|Spencer]], has its southern terminus at US-20 east of the I-84 interchange. US-20 enters the town of [[Charlton, Massachusetts|Charlton]] at this point, passing through Charlton City where it meets the northern end of [[Massachusetts Route 169|Route 169]] and crosses over [[Massachusetts Route 31|Route 31]]. Continuing east, US-20 enters the city of [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]], south of [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], where it briefly overlaps [[Massachusetts Route 12|Route 12]]. Route 12 provides direct access to the Mass Pike at Exit 10, while US-20 directly interchanges with [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut-Massachusetts)|Interstate 395]], which becomes [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 290]] north of the Mass Pike interchange. US-20 continues to the northeast, entering [[Millbury, Massachusetts|Millbury]] after briefly crossing into [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], where it interchanges with the Mass Pike at Exit 10A, as well as with [[Massachusetts Route 146|Route 146]] (which at this point is overlapped by [[Massachusetts Route 122A|Route 122A]]). The route re-enters Worcester, crossing over [[Massachusetts Route 122|Route 122]], which provides access to the Mass Pike at Exit 11. Leaving Worcester, US-20 enters the town of [[Shrewsbury, Massachusetts|Shrewsbury]], interchanging with [[Massachusetts Route 140|Route 140]] south of town. The highway continues to the northeast, passing southwest of Shrewsbury, and interchanging with Route 9. Heading almost due north at this point, US-20 crosses into [[Northborough, Massachusetts|Northborough]], and turns back eastward, intersecting the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 135|Route 135]] in the town center. Two local roads, Church Street and Hudson Street, provide access to nearby I-290, which runs to the north. US-20 proceeds out of Northborough to the northeast, crossing into [[Marlborough, Massachusetts|Marlborough]] and [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]].\n\nUS-20 enters Marlborough and interchanges with [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] (also referred to as the Outer Circumferential Highway) at Exit 24 west of town, effectively crossing into Boston's western suburbs. The route directly serves the center of town, crossing [[Massachusetts Route 85|Route 85]] in the process. It is in eastern Marlborough where US-20 begins to be famously referred to as [[Boston Post Road]], and the road continues eastward into the town of [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]]. US-20 passes through the southern part of the town, crossing over the [[Massachusetts Route 27|Route 27]]/[[Massachusetts Route 126|Route 126]] concurrency in [[Wayland, Massachusetts|Wayland]], and continues into [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]. US-20 does not intersect any major roads or numbered highways in Weston, but does follow an approximately mile-long bypass of the Boston Post Road (appropriately named Boston Post Road Bypass) between Highland Street and Wellesley Street, where US-20 rejoins the road and continues east into [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]].  The entire length of US-20 in Weston is designated as the [[Boston Post Road Historic District (Weston, Massachusetts)|Boston Post Road Historic District]], since it retains much of its rural 18th-century character. Immediately upon crossing into Waltham, US-20 enters a rotary interchange with [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] ([[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]]) at Exit 26, marking the change from suburban landscape to the urban landscape of metro Boston and having access to the Mass Pike. US-20 meets the eastern end of [[Massachusetts Route 117|Route 117]] and cuts through the center of Waltham, serving as Main Street east of Route 117. US-20 also meets the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 60|Route 60]], an urban highway serving Boston's northern suburbs, in Waltham. The highway continues into the city of [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] serving as its Main Street to Watertown Square, where it has a major junction with [[Massachusetts Route 16|Route 16]], which passes west and north of Boston via various parkways on the edges of the city, through [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] and [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]]. US-20 becomes North Beacon Street at this point and continues southeast as it crosses into the city of [[Boston]] over the [[North Beacon Street Bridge]].\n\n===Suffolk County===\n[[File:US20end.jpg|thumb|left|250px|US&nbsp;20 eastbound approaching Kenmore Square, Boston]]\n[[File:Rt 20 sign.jpg|thumb|right|Eastern terminus sign of U.S. Route 20 in Boston, MA]]\n\nUS-20 briefly continues as Leo F. Birmingham Parkway upon crossing into the Boston neighborhood of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], immediately intersecting the western end of [[Soldiers Field Road]] Extension, before it turns right and continues as North Beacon Street again, and crosses under the Mass Pike (no interchange). US-20 continues towards downtown, passing through the [[Allston]] neighborhood of Boston. Upon crossing Cambridge Street, US-20 becomes Brighton Ave for a short distance. US-20 soon reaches [[Commonwealth Avenue, Boston|Commonwealth Ave]], and takes the eastbound routing over for [[Massachusetts Route 30|Route 30]], which ends at the intersection. At this point, the [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]]/[[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]] border lies just feet south of the road, and US-20 passes through [[Boston University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/maps/|title=Boston University maps, retrieved August 5, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}</ref>  US-20 crosses [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] at the southern end of the [[Boston University Bridge]], crossing over the Mass Pike for the final time. Route 2, via Mountfort Street, Park Drive, and Beacon Street, turns from south to east to meet US-20 at [[Kenmore Square]]. Upon meeting Route 2 again, US-20 meets its eastern terminus, with Route 2 taking Commonwealth Ave its final stretch to the [[Boston Public Garden]] and [[Massachusetts Route 28|Route 28]], where Route 2 meets its own end.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Boston&state=MA&address=Kenmore+Square|title=MapQuest Maps:|publisher=|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nU.S. Route 20's official eastern terminus is in [[Kenmore Square]] at the intersection of [[Commonwealth Avenue (Boston)|Commonwealth Avenue]], [[Beacon Street]], and [[Brookline Avenue]].\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{jcttop|exit|length_ref=<ref name=\"MA Route Log\">{{cite web|url=http://services.massdot.state.ma.us/mrla/RouteSelection.htm|title=Massachusetts Route Log Application|author=MassDOT Planning Division|date=|website=|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref>|location_ref=<ref name=\"MA Route Log\" />}}\n{{MAint|exit\n|county=Berkshire\n|cspan=12\n|location=Hancock\n|mile=0.000\n|espan=20\n|road={{jct|state=NY|US|20|dir1=west}}\n|notes=Continuation into [[New York (state)|New York]]\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Pittsfield\n|lspan=3\n|mile=3.336\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|41|dir1=south|city1=Richmond|city2=West Stockbridge}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route&nbsp;41\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=7.431\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|9|dir1=east|name1=Center Street|city1=Dalton}}\n|notes=Western terminus of Route&nbsp;9}}\n{{MAint\n|type=concur\n|mile=7.596\n|road={{jct|state=MA|US|7|dir1=north|city1=Williamstown}}\n|notes=Western end of US&nbsp;7 concurrency}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Lenox\n|lspan=3\n|mile=12.845\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|7A|dir1=south|city1=Lenox}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route&nbsp;7A\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=14.694\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|183|dir1=south|city1=Lenox|city2=Tanglewood}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route&nbsp;183\n}}\n{{MAint\n|type=concur\n|mile=15.001\n|road={{jct|state=MA|US|7|dir1=south|city1=Stockbridge|city2=Great Barrington}}\n|notes=Eastern end of US&nbsp;7 concurrency\n}}\n{{jctbridge|exit\n|state=MA\n|location=Lee\n|lspan=3\n|mile=17.405\n|bridge=Bridge over the [[Housatonic River]]\n}}\n{{MAint\n|type=toll\n|mile=18.766\n|road={{jct|state=MA|I|90|MATP|city1=Springfield|city2=Boston|location3=[[Albany, New York|Albany, NY]]|location4=[[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo, NY]]}}\n|notes=Exit 2 on I-90 / Mass Pike\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=18.836\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|102|dir1=west|city1=Stockbridge|city2=Great Barrington}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of Route&nbsp;102\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Becket\n|lspan=2\n|type=concur\n|mile=25.719\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|8|dir1=south|city1=Otis|location2=[[Winsted, Connecticut|Winsted, CT]]}}\n|notes=Western end of Route&nbsp;8 concurrency\n}}\n{{MAint\n|type=concur\n|mile=30.895\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|8|dir1=north|city1=Becket|city2=Dalton}}\n|notes=Eastern end of Route&nbsp;8 concurrency\n}}\n{{MAint\n|county=Hampshire\n|location=Huntington\n|mile=41.831\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|112|dir1=north|to2=to|MA|66|city1=Huntington}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of Route&nbsp;112\n}}\n{{MAint\n|county=Hampden\n|cspan=18\n|location=Russell\n|mile=48.016\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|23|dir1=west|city1=Blandford|city2=Otis}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of Route&nbsp;23\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Westfield\n|lspan=3\n|type=concur\n|mile=53.752\n|road={{jct|state=MA|US|202|MA|10|dir2=north|city1=Holyoke|city2=Athol}}\n|notes=Western end of US&nbsp;202 / Route&nbsp;10 concurrency\n}}\n{{MAint\n|type=concur\n|mile=54.004\n|road={{jct|state=MA|US|202|MA|10|dir2=south|city1=Southwick|location2=[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven, CT]]}}\n|notes=Eastern end of US&nbsp;202 / Route&nbsp;10 concurrency\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=55.770\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|187|dir1=south|city1=Feeding Hills}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route&nbsp;187\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=West Springfield\n|mile=61.577\n|road={{jct|state=MA|US|5|city1=Agawam|city2=Northampton}}\n|notes=Rotary interchange\n}}\n{{jctbridge\n|location_special=[[Connecticut River]]\n|mile=61.697\n|bridge=Bridge\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Springfield\n|lspan=7\n|mile=62.739\n|road={{jct|state=MA|I|91|MA|20A|dir2=east|location1=[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford, CT]]|city2=Greenfield}}\n|notes=Western terminus of Route 20A;

In addition, the IACUC reviews and approves each animal use protocol, which is a written description the researchers submit describing all procedures to be done with laboratory animals. Researchers must consult with a veterinarian for each procedure that may cause more than momentary pain or distress to the animals. In addition a written justification for these procedures, as well as documentation of a search for alternatives to these procedures, must be included with the protocol. The IACUC must review and approve these protocols at least annually. The IACUC also inspects all the animal facilities, including satellite facilities, every 6 months. As a part of this semi-annual inspection the committee also reviews the entire animal care and use program, and submits a \"semi-annual report\" to the Institutional Official.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=931bb395059c14cf19fc4c51d7902b31&node=9:1.0.1.1.2.3.1.2&rgn=div8|title=eCFR \u2014 Code of Federal Regulations|work=ecfr.gov}}</ref> The Guide (enforced by OLAW) also has requirements for IACUC responsibilities and program reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12910&page=11|title=Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals: Eighth Edition|work=nap.edu}}</ref>\n\nAnimal care and use in research in the United States are largely controlled by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.\n\nThe following information is based on IACUC activity in the United States over 15 years ago. In addition, the purpose of an IACUC is not to provide \"consistent\" oversight across studies or institutions. Each institution has its own culture, priorities, and interpretations. \nA study conducted in 2001 by Psychology Professor [[Scott Plous]] of [[Wesleyan University]] that evaluated the reliability of IACUCs found little consistency between decisions made by IACUCs at different institutions. A Wesleyan University press release summarized part of the findings:\n\n{{quotation|The investigation, which took three years to complete, compared judgments made by 50 randomly selected animal care and use committees drawn from U.S. colleges and universities. To assess the consistency of approval decisions, 150 recent research proposals from these institutions were each independently evaluated by two different animal care and use committees.\n\nThe results showed that approval decisions were statistically unrelated. In most cases, proposals that were disapproved by one committee were approved by the second committee.\n\nThe study also explored whether reviews were more reliable when the experiment involved certain types of animals or procedures. For example, reliability was assessed for proposals that involved dogs, cats, and primates, or for experiments involving drugs, surgery, animal pain, or death. Even in these cases, independent reviews did not agree beyond chance levels.<ref>[http://www.socialpsychology.org/articles/scipress.htm] Study Finds Inconsistency in Animal Research Reviews. Wesleyan University; July 27, 2001</ref>}}\n\nIn response to the Plous study, a rebuttal letter to ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' written by animal researchers, animal care staff, and members of professional research societies stated:\n\n{{quotation|That the masked protocols would be rated more negatively was predictable for the following reasons. First, IACUCs rely on knowing the experience of the investigators and staff, information that was not included for the unofficial IACUCs. Not surprisingly, most of the negative shifts (84 of 118) were to categories calling for more information. Second, withholding approval had no practical consequence. Third, participants might have felt scrutinized by researchers with an \"animal rights\" agenda, and erred on the side of deferral or rejection. Fourth, navigating another institution's forms can be difficult. And fifth, IACUCs unfamiliar with particular species or procedures are less likely to understand a protocol. These factors make it almost impossible to compare the actions of the original and unofficial IACUCs and thus call into question the major premises and conclusions of this study.<ref>Science 30 November 2001: Vol. 294. no. 5548, pp. 1831\u20131832 {{doi|10.1126/science.294.5548.1831b}}</ref>}}\n\nInstitutions are also subject to unannounced annual inspections from USDA APHIS Veterinarian inspectors.

OLAW oversees all animal studies funded by the Public Health Service (including NIH).  The Health Research Extension Act of 1985 directed the NIH to write the [[Public Health Service]] (PHS) Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. This Policy applies to any individual scientist or institution in receipt of federal funds and requires each institution to have an IACUC, among other stipulations. OLAW enforces the recommendations in the ''Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals''[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12910 Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals: Eighth Edition] published by the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research,[http://dels.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarhome/ Page Not Found : Division on Earth and Life Studies] which covers all vertebrate species, including rodents, birds, fish, amphibians, and reptiles  [http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12910 Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals: Eighth Edition] This means that IACUCs oversee the use of all [[vertebrate]] species in research at facilities receiving federal funds, even if the species are not covered by the AWA.

At the inaugural meeting on January 30, 1968, the CCAC adopted the following statement of objective: \"to develop guiding principles for the care of experimental animals in Canada, and to work for their effective application\".<ref name=Canada>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccac.ca/en_/education/niaut/stream/cs-guidelines |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902075036/http://ccac.ca/en_/education/niaut/stream/cs-guidelines |archivedate=2012-09-02 }}</ref>\n\nThe federal government does not have jurisdiction to pass laws that involve experiments on animals. The provinces have jurisdiction concerning that area. The federal government, however, is involved in three areas: the criminal law power, the health power, and the spending power.\n\n;The Criminal Code of Canada\nSection 446 and 447 of the Criminal Code protect animals from cruelty, abuse and neglect. This section of the Criminal Code has been under review for several years.\n\n;The Health of Animals Act\nThe Health of Animals Act (1990) and its regulations are aimed primarily at protecting Canadian livestock from a variety of infectious diseases that would threaten both the health of the animals and people, and Canadian trade in livestock with other countries. This act is used both to deal with named disease outbreaks in Canada, and to prevent the entry of unacceptable diseases that do not exist in Canada.\n\n;The Spending Power\nThe other mechanism through which the federal government has lent its support to the humane treatment of animals is not strictly speaking legislative in nature, but in many respects it is one of the most powerful instruments available to the federal government for setting national standards. The federal government's power to provide for grants subject to conditions imposed on the recipients, be they provincial governments or individual or corporate recipients, may take a variety of different forms. One form is that of the conditional federal grant or contract. This manifestation of the federal power is what currently underpins the imposition of CCAC standards on facilities receiving funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council. Where the government itself awards a contract on an academic or non-academic institution, clause A9015C of Public Works Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions Manual imposes conditions related to the care and use of experimental animals in public works and government services.<ref name=\"Canada\"/>\n\nAll of the provinces in Canada have created and passed laws that pertain to animal welfare, but only certain provinces have made their own laws. These provinces are Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island.\n\n===Alberta===\nIn 2006, the Alberta Animal Protection Act was revised and declared. Previously in Alberta, only academic institutions were subject to provincial regulations referencing CCAC standards, as these standards were referenced exclusively in the Alberta Universities Act. In 2005, the Universities Act and two other laws were examined by the Alberta Agriculture, Food and Rural Development Ministry (AAFRD), in hopes of combining them and update their content. Article 2(1) of the Animal Protection Regulations was revised by the CCAC and AAFRD and now states that \"a person who owns or has custody, care or control of an animal for research activities must comply with the following Canadian Council on Animal Care documents\", and lists all 22 CCAC standards, including the CCAC Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals and the various guidelines and policies published by the CCAC.<ref name=\"Canada\"/>\n\n===Prince Edward Island===\nIn Prince Edward Island, the ''Animal Protection Regulations'' made under the ''Animal Health and Protection Act'' state that the rules controlling the care of animals used for medical or scientific research can be found in Volumes 1 and 2 of the ''Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals'' published by the CCAC.<ref name=\"Canada\"/>\n\n===Manitoba===\nIn the province of Manitoba, according to the Animal Care Act, it is not allowed for a person to cause suffering to an animal. The use of animals for research and teaching is acceptable as long as it follows the rules set out in the Act. All institutions that use animals for research and teaching purposes have to submit to obey the system put in place by the CCAC. Failing to do so, any harm done to an animal in a research or teaching program will be regarded as an offense under the Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/a084e.php|title=The Animal Care Act|work=gov.mb.ca}}</ref>\n\n===Ontario===\nAll of the research facilities in Ontario must be registered and licensed based on the legislation Animals for Research Act. Among the provisions of the Animals for Research Act, one should note the duty to establish an animal care committee, the responsibilities and powers of which are similar to those required under the CCAC system, and the requirement for any operator of a research facility to submit to the person designated by the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs a report respecting the animals used in the research facility for research.<ref name=\"Canada\"/>  Regulation 24 governs the housing and care of the animals. Regulation 25 controls the conditions for transportation of the animals that are used or going to be used by a research facility.\n\n==Australia==\nIn Australia, Animal Ethics Committees (AECs) determine whether the use of an animal is valid or not. AECs must follow the Code in order to ensure the wellbeing of the animals used for research. The Code emphasizes the responsibilities of investigators, teachers and institutions using animals to:\n*ensure that the use of animals is justified, taking into consideration the scientific or educational benefits and the potential effects on the welfare of the animals;\n*ensure that the welfare of animals is always considered;\n*promote the development and use of techniques that replace the use of animals in\nscientific and teaching activities;\n*minimise the number of animals used in projects; and\n*refine methods and procedures to avoid pain or distress in animals used in scientific and teaching activities.<ref name=AustralianGov>[http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/ea16.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317033146/http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/ea16.pdf |date=2012-03-17 }} \"Australian Government\". 7th Edition, 2004</ref>\n\nScientific and teaching activities using animals may be performed only when they are essential:\n*to obtain and establish significant information relevant to the understanding of humans and/or animals;\n*for the maintenance and improvement of human and/or animal health and welfare;\n*for the improvement of animal management or production;\n*to obtain and establish significant information relevant to the understanding, maintenance or improvement of the natural environment; or\n*for the achievement of educational objectives.<ref name=AustralianGov />\n\nResearchers can only conduct their studies once it has approved the validity of the use of the animals and that there is more educational or scientific gain that outweighs the possible effects on the welfare of the animals.

Animal use in RTT is strictly controlled under the Animal Welfare Act 1999<ref name=AWA />  and organisations using animals must follow an approved code of ethical conduct. This sets out the policies and procedures that need to be adopted and followed by the organisation and its animal ethics committee.\n\nEvery project must be approved and monitored by an animal ethics committee. These committees must have three external members:\n\n* a nominee of an approved animal welfare organisation (such as the SPCA),<ref name=RNZSPCA>{{cite web|last=Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|title=SPCA New Zealand|url=http://rnzspca.org.nz/|publisher=SPCA|accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref>\n* a nominee of the New Zealand Veterinary Association<ref>{{cite web|last=New Zealand Veterinary Association|title=Home page|url=http://www.nzva.org.nz/|publisher=NZVA|accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref>  and,\n* a lay person to represent the public interest (and nominated by a local government body).\n\nCode holders and their animal ethics committees are independently reviewed (by MPI accredited reviewers) at least once every five years.

In addition, the IACUC reviews and approves each animal use protocol, which is a written description the researchers submit describing all procedures to be done with laboratory animals. Researchers must consult with a veterinarian for each procedure that may cause more than momentary pain or distress to the animals. In addition a written justification for these procedures, as well as documentation of a search for alternatives to these procedures, must be included with the protocol. The IACUC must review and approve these protocols at least annually. The IACUC also inspects all the animal facilities, including satellite facilities, every 6 months. As a part of this semi-annual inspection the committee also reviews the entire animal care and use program, and submits a \"semi-annual report\" to the Institutional Official.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=931bb395059c14cf19fc4c51d7902b31&node=9:1.0.1.1.2.3.1.2&rgn=div8|title=eCFR \u2014 Code of Federal Regulations|work=ecfr.gov}}</ref> The Guide (enforced by OLAW) also has requirements for IACUC responsibilities and program reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12910&page=11|title=Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals: Eighth Edition|work=nap.edu}}</ref>\n\nAnimal care and use in research in the United States are largely controlled by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.\n\nThe following information is based on IACUC activity in the United States over 15 years ago. In addition, the purpose of an IACUC is not to provide \"consistent\" oversight across studies or institutions. Each institution has its own culture, priorities, and interpretations. \nA study conducted in 2001 by Psychology Professor [[Scott Plous]] of [[Wesleyan University]] that evaluated the reliability of IACUCs found little consistency between decisions made by IACUCs at different institutions. A Wesleyan University press release summarized part of the findings:\n\n{{quotation|The investigation, which took three years to complete, compared judgments made by 50 randomly selected animal care and use committees drawn from U.S. colleges and universities. To assess the consistency of approval decisions, 150 recent research proposals from these institutions were each independently evaluated by two different animal care and use committees.\n\nThe results showed that approval decisions were statistically unrelated. In most cases, proposals that were disapproved by one committee were approved by the second committee.\n\nThe study also explored whether reviews were more reliable when the experiment involved certain types of animals or procedures. For example, reliability was assessed for proposals that involved dogs, cats, and primates, or for experiments involving drugs, surgery, animal pain, or death. Even in these cases, independent reviews did not agree beyond chance levels.<ref>[http://www.socialpsychology.org/articles/scipress.htm] Study Finds Inconsistency in Animal Research Reviews.

First, IACUCs rely on knowing the experience of the investigators and staff, information that was not included for the unofficial IACUCs. Not surprisingly, most of the negative shifts (84 of 118) were to categories calling for more information. Second, withholding approval had no practical consequence. Third, participants might have felt scrutinized by researchers with an \"animal rights\" agenda, and erred on the side of deferral or rejection. Fourth, navigating another institution's forms can be difficult. And fifth, IACUCs unfamiliar with particular species or procedures are less likely to understand a protocol. These factors make it almost impossible to compare the actions of the original and unofficial IACUCs and thus call into question the major premises and conclusions of this study.<ref>Science 30 November 2001: Vol. 294. no. 5548, pp. 1831\u20131832 {{doi|10.1126/science.294.5548.1831b}}</ref>}}\n\nInstitutions are also subject to unannounced annual inspections from USDA APHIS Veterinarian inspectors.

At the inaugural meeting on January 30, 1968, the CCAC adopted the following statement of objective: \"to develop guiding principles for the care of experimental animals in Canada, and to work for their effective application\".<ref name=Canada>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccac.ca/en_/education/niaut/stream/cs-guidelines |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902075036/http://ccac.ca/en_/education/niaut/stream/cs-guidelines |archivedate=2012-09-02 }}</ref>\n\nThe federal government does not have jurisdiction to pass laws that involve experiments on animals. The provinces have jurisdiction concerning that area. The federal government, however, is involved in three areas: the criminal law power, the health power, and the spending power.\n\n;The Criminal Code of Canada\nSection 446 and 447 of the Criminal Code protect animals from cruelty, abuse and neglect. This section of the Criminal Code has been under review for several years.\n\n;The Health of Animals Act\nThe Health of Animals Act (1990) and its regulations are aimed primarily at protecting Canadian livestock from a variety of infectious diseases that would threaten both the health of the animals and people, and Canadian trade in livestock with other countries. This act is used both to deal with named disease outbreaks in Canada, and to prevent the entry of unacceptable diseases that do not exist in Canada.\n\n;The Spending Power\nThe other mechanism through which the federal government has lent its support to the humane treatment of animals is not strictly speaking legislative in nature, but in many respects it is one of the most powerful instruments available to the federal government for setting national standards. The federal government's power to provide for grants subject to conditions imposed on the recipients, be they provincial governments or individual or corporate recipients, may take a variety of different forms. One form is that of the conditional federal grant or contract. This manifestation of the federal power is what currently underpins the imposition of CCAC standards on facilities receiving funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council. Where the government itself awards a contract on an academic or non-academic institution, clause A9015C of Public Works Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions Manual imposes conditions related to the care and use of experimental animals in public works and government services.<ref name=\"Canada\"/>\n\nAll of the provinces in Canada have created and passed laws that pertain to animal welfare, but only certain provinces have made their own laws. These provinces are Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island.\n\n===Alberta===\nIn 2006, the Alberta Animal Protection Act was revised and declared. Previously in Alberta, only academic institutions were subject to provincial regulations referencing CCAC standards, as these standards were referenced exclusively in the Alberta Universities Act. In 2005, the Universities Act and two other laws were examined by the Alberta Agriculture, Food and Rural Development Ministry (AAFRD), in hopes of combining them and update their content. Article 2(1) of the Animal Protection Regulations was revised by the CCAC and AAFRD and now states that \"a person who owns or has custody, care or control of an animal for research activities must comply with the following Canadian Council on Animal Care documents\", and lists all 22 CCAC standards, including the CCAC Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals and the various guidelines and policies published by the CCAC.<ref name=\"Canada\"/>\n\n===Prince Edward Island===\nIn Prince Edward Island, the ''Animal Protection Regulations'' made under the ''Animal Health and Protection Act'' state that the rules controlling the care of animals used for medical or scientific research can be found in Volumes 1 and 2 of the ''Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals'' published by the CCAC.<ref name=\"Canada\"/>\n\n===Manitoba===\nIn the province of Manitoba, according to the Animal Care Act, it is not allowed for a person to cause suffering to an animal. The use of animals for research and teaching is acceptable as long as it follows the rules set out in the Act. All institutions that use animals for research and teaching purposes have to submit to obey the system put in place by the CCAC. Failing to do so, any harm done to an animal in a research or teaching program will be regarded as an offense under the Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/a084e.php|title=The Animal Care Act|work=gov.mb.ca}}</ref>\n\n===Ontario===\nAll of the research facilities in Ontario must be registered and licensed based on the legislation Animals for Research Act. Among the provisions of the Animals for Research Act, one should note the duty to establish an animal care committee, the responsibilities and powers of which are similar to those required under the CCAC system, and the requirement for any operator of a research facility to submit to the person designated by the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs a report respecting the animals used in the research facility for research.<ref name=\"Canada\"/>  Regulation 24 governs the housing and care of the animals. Regulation 25 controls the conditions for transportation of the animals that are used or going to be used by a research facility.\n\n==Australia==\nIn Australia, Animal Ethics Committees (AECs) determine whether the use of an animal is valid or not. AECs must follow the Code in order to ensure the wellbeing of the animals used for research. The Code emphasizes the responsibilities of investigators, teachers and institutions using animals to:\n*ensure that the use of animals is justified, taking into consideration the scientific or educational benefits and the potential effects on the welfare of the animals;\n*ensure that the welfare of animals is always considered;\n*promote the development and use of techniques that replace the use of animals in\nscientific and teaching activities;\n*minimise the number of animals used in projects; and\n*refine methods and procedures to avoid pain or distress in animals used in scientific and teaching activities.<ref name=AustralianGov>[http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/ea16.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317033146/http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/ea16.pdf |date=2012-03-17 }} \"Australian Government\". 7th Edition, 2004</ref>\n\nScientific and teaching activities using animals may be performed only when they are essential:\n*to obtain and establish significant information relevant to the understanding of humans and/or animals;\n*for the maintenance and improvement of human and/or animal health and welfare;\n*for the improvement of animal management or production;\n*to obtain and establish significant information relevant to the understanding, maintenance or improvement of the natural environment; or\n*for the achievement of educational objectives.<ref name=AustralianGov />\n\nResearchers can only conduct their studies once it has approved the validity of the use of the animals and that there is more educational or scientific gain that outweighs the possible effects on the welfare of the animals.

In New Zealand, as in many countries, laboratory animals (mainly rodents) and farm animals (mainly cattle and sheep) are used in research, testing and teaching \u2013 commonly referred to as RTT. Animal use in RTT is strictly controlled under the Animal Welfare Act 1999<ref name=AWA />  and organisations using animals must follow an approved code of ethical conduct. This sets out the policies and procedures that need to be adopted and followed by the organisation and its animal ethics committee.\n\nEvery project must be approved and monitored by an animal ethics committee. These committees must have three external members:\n\n* a nominee of an approved animal welfare organisation (such as the SPCA),<ref name=RNZSPCA>{{cite web|last=Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|title=SPCA New Zealand|url=http://rnzspca.org.nz/|publisher=SPCA|accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref>\n* a nominee of the New Zealand Veterinary Association<ref>{{cite web|last=New Zealand Veterinary Association|title=Home page|url=http://www.nzva.org.nz/|publisher=NZVA|accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref>  and,\n* a lay person to represent the public interest (and nominated by a local government body).\n\nCode holders and their animal ethics committees are independently reviewed (by MPI accredited reviewers) at least once every five years. All code holders have to submit annual animal use statistics on the number of animals used in research, testing or teaching, and its impact on them, from little or none to severe.\n\nThe Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI)<ref>{{cite web|last=Ministry for Primary Industries|title=Animal Welfare|url=http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/animal-welfare/|publisher=Ministry for Primary Industries|accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref>  administers the Act and leads animal welfare policy and practice in New Zealand.

The law established the National Council for the Control of Animal Experimentation (CONCEA) and demanded that institutions create an ethics committee on the use of animals.\n\nIn 2009, Decree 6899/2009 defined CONCEA as the governing and advisory body, under the Ministry of Science and Technology, to authorize accreditation to registered institutions and to license those institutions to use animals in research. The same decree also states that an electronic database be developed to allow breeding and research facilities to register in order to apply for CONCEA accreditation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dels-old.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarjournal/52_1/PDFs/v5201e-Filipecki.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816183043/http://dels-old.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarjournal/52_1/PDFs/v5201e-Filipecki.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-16 }}</ref>\n\nBrazil also reinforces the 3Rs.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Animal rights]]\n[[Category:Animal testing]]\n[[Category:Regulation]]\n[[Category:Statutory law]]\n", "name_user": "Black Walnut", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eUnited Kingdom:fixed awkward wording", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_regulations"}
