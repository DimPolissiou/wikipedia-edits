Village citizens used to hide themselves in forest areas around the village to escape from killings of the [https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/his-highness-the-nizam-s-army-kalakriti-archives/hQKi9YxLzJFZJg?hl=en Nizam Army]. There are some notable persons who scarified their lives fighting against the army for freedom.\n[[File:Sun Rise Fisherman.JPG|thumb|left|Sunrise over Lake Kotha Kunta]]\n\n==Historical places==\n[[File:Sunset near shambuni cheruvu.JPG|thumb|Sunset over Lake Shambuni Cheruvu]]\n\nOne of the historical places in the village is 'Shambhuni Gudi' (Shivalayam; a temple of [[Shiva]]), located on the banks of Shabhuni Cheruvu (a major reservoir of the village). The temple was constructed during the ruling of [[Rudrama Devi]] of the [[Kakatiya dynasty]]. The architectural style of the temple is characteristic of Shiva temples built by Kakatiya rulers. However, over a period of time, the temple was demolished and has never been recovered by Archeological department of India.\n\nThe other notable place is 'Anjaneya Swamy Gudi (Temple of Lord [[Hanuman]] who is a disciple of Lord [[Rama]] in the war against the demon king [[Ravana]]). The temple is located centrally in the village. It is part of the local custom and Hindu wedding ritual for newly wedded couples to visit the temple before they enter their home.\n\n==Festivals and events==\nVillage people actively celebrate most major festival of the Hindu religion - [[Sankranti]], [[Ugadi]], [[Diwali]], [[Vijayadashami]] and Muslim festivals like [[Ramadan|Ramzan]] ([[Ramadan]]), [[Bakra Eid]], [[Peerla Panduga]] ([[Muharram]] [(kanthama mahesheswraswamy festival) (it's a gouds famous festival)].\n\nEvery two years, the village hosts the major carnival called 'Gangadevamma Jathara', a festival that is celebrated by villagers that worship the [[Goddess Ganga]] (aka Ganges, personified as a goddess, worshiped by Hindus who believe that the prayers towards the goddess would bring more rain and water to the village). This festival includes people from surrounding villages who camp near the temple for few days and participate in the celebrations.\n\nEvery year the women in the village celebrate a [[Telangana]] traditional festival called [[Bathukamma]].\n\n[[File:Batukamma2-1.JPG|thumb|right|Women celebrating [[Bathukamma]]]]\n\nPeerla Panduga is a Muslim festival that was enjoyed by all the people in the village irrespective of their religion.\n\n==Agriculture and other occupations==\n[[File:Peanut 9417.jpg|thumb|left|Freshly dug peanuts]]\n\nThe village is predominately dependent on agriculture, the irrigation of which is dependent on rainfall. There are 4 major reservoirs located around the village for irrigation. They are - Shambhuni cheruvu (built by [[Rudrama Devi]]), Kotha Kunta, Ayyavaari Kunta, and Garu Kunta. There is also a small check dam built on a creek that passes by the village, which also serves as a source for irrigation. About 10,000 acres of land are cultivated each year. Crops that are grown include:[[Paddy (unmilled rice)|paddy]], [[peanut]]s, [[red chili]], [[mung bean]] (also known as [[green gram]] or [[golden gram]]), [[pigeon pea]] (also known as yellow dal) and [[cotton]]. Lately, there has been the introduction of commercial crops: [[mangos]], [[oranges]], and others. The village is surrounded by more than ten Lambada Thandas ([[Banjara]] Thanda) that provide much of the agricultural labor.\n\n[[File:Red Chili ppahad.JPG|thumb|left|Red Chili crop]]\n\nAll the crops except cotton are marketed in [[Suryapet]] agriculture market yard. Cotton is usually sold in the [[Warangal]] market.\n\nThere are a significant number of people in the village who belongs to [[Golla (caste)|Golla]] or [[Yadav]]. Their traditional occupation has been rearing sheep, goats and cattle and selling them in nearby [[Angadi]] (Rural supermarkets in [[Telangana]] region). As did many Telangana region villages, had a weekly Angadi (every Saturday) until 1998. People relied on the angadi for their daily household goods. The angadis were an alternative supermarket concept for villages in most of the Telangana districts.\n\n[[File:Cotton picking in India.jpg|thumb|left|Cotton being picked by hand]]\n\nIn late 1980s, the village was famous for producing most ''Kallu''. There are two main types of ''kallu'' produced: ''[[Thadi Kallu]]'' (from Toddy Palmyra trees) and ''[[Eetha Kallu]]'' (from [[Phoenix sylvestris|silver date palms]]). ''Eetha Kallu'' is very sweet and less intoxicating, whereas ''Thati Kallu'' is stronger (sweet in the morning, becoming sour to bitter-sour in the evening) and is highly intoxicating. People enjoy ''kallu'' right at the trees where it is brought down. They drink from the leaves by holding them to their mouths while the Goud pours the ''kallu'' from the ''Kunda'' (''kallu'' pot). There are different types of toddy (''kallu'') according to the season: 1. ''poddathadu'', 2. ''parpudthadu'', 3. ''pandudthadu'', and 4. ''mogadthadu''. A good portion of the village population (called [[Goud]]) rely on selling 'Kallu' for their living.\n\n==Education and employment==\n[[File:Suryapet highway.jpg|thumb|right|The road (Suryapet-Warangal Highway) connecting Patharlapahad]]\n\nThe village has a [[District Councils of India|Zila Parishad]] school that educate the students up to tenth standard (SSC - [[Secondary School Certificate]]). Patharlapahad is notable in the district for educated talent who serves as employees in wide variety of professional occupations. The village is famous for producing the most number of teachers in the [[mandal]]. There are in the village presently 1 doctor,205 government teachers, 12 engineers,1 DSP 4 circle inspector of police, 4 sub-inspector of police and 6 constables.\n\nPatharlapahad has a youth club named -Navodaya Youth Club. Under the authority of this club, the village used to host district level sports and cultural competitions.\n\n==Politics==\nThe Patharlapahad Government is a [[gram panchayat]] that consists of twelve wards. The Panchayath also includes wards from nearby Thandas. Main political parties are the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC) and the [[Telangana Rashtra Samithi]] (TRS).

The temple was constructed during the ruling of [[Rudrama Devi]] of the [[Kakatiya dynasty]]. The architectural style of the temple is characteristic of Shiva temples built by Kakatiya rulers. However, over a period of time, the temple was demolished and has never been recovered by Archeological department of India.\n\nThe other notable place is 'Anjaneya Swamy Gudi (Temple of Lord [[Hanuman]] who is a disciple of Lord [[Rama]] in the war against the demon king [[Ravana]]). The temple is located centrally in the village. It is part of the local custom and Hindu wedding ritual for newly wedded couples to visit the temple before they enter their home.\n\n==Festivals and events==\nVillage people actively celebrate most major festival of the Hindu religion - [[Sankranti]], [[Ugadi]], [[Diwali]], [[Vijayadashami]] and Muslim festivals like [[Ramadan|Ramzan]] ([[Ramadan]]), [[Bakra Eid]], [[Peerla Panduga]] ([[Muharram]] [(kanthama mahesheswraswamy festival) (it's a gouds famous festival)].\n\nEvery two years, the village hosts the major carnival called 'Gangadevamma Jathara', a festival that is celebrated by villagers that worship the [[Goddess Ganga]] (aka Ganges, personified as a goddess, worshiped by Hindus who believe that the prayers towards the goddess would bring more rain and water to the village). This festival includes people from surrounding villages who camp near the temple for few days and participate in the celebrations.\n\nEvery year the women in the village celebrate a [[Telangana]] traditional festival called [[Bathukamma]].\n\n[[File:Batukamma2-1.JPG|thumb|right|Women celebrating [[Bathukamma]]]]\n\nPeerla Panduga is a Muslim festival that was enjoyed by all the people in the village irrespective of their religion.\n\n==Agriculture and other occupations==\n[[File:Peanut 9417.jpg|thumb|left|Freshly dug peanuts]]\n\nThe village is predominately dependent on agriculture, the irrigation of which is dependent on rainfall. There are 4 major reservoirs located around the village for irrigation. They are - Shambhuni cheruvu (built by [[Rudrama Devi]]), Kotha Kunta, Ayyavaari Kunta, and Garu Kunta. There is also a small check dam built on a creek that passes by the village, which also serves as a source for irrigation. About 10,000 acres of land are cultivated each year. Crops that are grown include:[[Paddy (unmilled rice)|paddy]], [[peanut]]s, [[red chili]], [[mung bean]] (also known as [[green gram]] or [[golden gram]]), [[pigeon pea]] (also known as yellow dal) and [[cotton]]. Lately, there has been the introduction of commercial crops: [[mangos]], [[oranges]], and others. The village is surrounded by more than ten Lambada Thandas ([[Banjara]] Thanda) that provide much of the agricultural labor.\n\n[[File:Red Chili ppahad.JPG|thumb|left|Red Chili crop]]\n\nAll the crops except cotton are marketed in [[Suryapet]] agriculture market yard. Cotton is usually sold in the [[Warangal]] market.\n\nThere are a significant number of people in the village who belongs to [[Golla (caste)|Golla]] or [[Yadav]]. Their traditional occupation has been rearing sheep, goats and cattle and selling them in nearby [[Angadi]] (Rural supermarkets in [[Telangana]] region). As did many Telangana region villages, had a weekly Angadi (every Saturday) until 1998. People relied on the angadi for their daily household goods.

Francis George Farewell]], both ex-[[Royal Navy]] officers from the [[Napoleonic Wars]], were engaged in trade between the [[Cape Colony|Cape]] and [[Maputo Bay|Delagoa Bay]]. On a return trip to the Cape in 1823, they were caught in a very bad storm and decided to risk the Bar and anchor in the Bay of Natal. The crossing went off well and they found safe anchor from the storm.\nLt. King decided to map the Bay and named the \"Salisbury and Farewell Islands\". In 1824 Lt. Farewell, together with a trading company called J. R. Thompson & Co., decided to open trade relations with [[Shaka]] the Zulu King and establish a trading station at the Bay. [[Henry Francis Fynn]], another trader at Delagoa Bay, was also involved in this venture.\nFynn left Delagoa Bay and sailed for the Bay of Natal on the brig ''Julia'', while Farewell followed six weeks later on the ''Antelope''. Between them they had 26 possible settlers, but only 18 stayed. On a visit to King Shaka, Henry Francis Fynn was able to befriend the King by helping him recover from a stab wound suffered as a result of an assassination attempt by one of his half-brothers. As a token of Shaka's gratitude, he granted Fynn a \u201c25-mile strip of coast a hundred miles in depth.\u201d  On 7 August 1824 they concluded negotiations with King Shaka for a cession of land, including the Bay of Natal and land extending ten miles south of the Bay, twenty-five miles north of the Bay and one hundred miles inland. \nFarewell took possession of this grant and raised the [[Union Jack]] with a Royal Salute, which consisted of 4 cannon shots and twenty musket shots. Of the original 18 would-be settlers, only 6 remained, and they can be regarded as the founding members of Port Natal as a British colony. These 6 were joined by Lt.

The seal was produced in 1855 and was replaced in 1882. The new seal contained a coat of arms without helmet or mantling that combined the coats of arms of Sir Benjamin D\u2019Urban and Sir Benjamin Pine. An application was made to register the coat of arms with the [[College of Arms]] in 1906, but this application was rejected on grounds that the design implied that D\u2019Urban and Pine were husband and wife. Nevertheless, the coat of arms appeared on the council's stationery from about 1912. The following year, a helmet and mantling was added to the council's stationery and to the new city seal that was made in 1936. The motto reads \"Debile principium melior fortuna sequitur\"\u2014\"Better fortune follows a humble beginning\".\n\nThe blazon of the arms registered by the South African Bureau of Heraldry and granted to Durban on 9 February 1979. The coat of arms fell into disuse with the re-organisation of the South African local government structure in 2000. The seal ceased to be used in 1995.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/za-kn-dur.html \n |title=Durban (South Africa) \u2013 Flags of the World \n |author=Bruce Berry \n |date=8 May 2006 \n |accessdate=8 July 2010 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613221018/http://www.crwflags.com/FOTW/FLAGS/za-kn-dur.html \n |archivedate=13 June 2010 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.ngw.nl/int/zaf/d/durban.htm\n |title        = Durban \u2013 Civic Heraldry of South Africa\n |author       = Ralf Hartemink\n |accessdate   = 8 July 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101205062839/http://www.ngw.nl/int/zaf/d/durban.htm\n |archive-date = 5 December 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n== Government  ==\n {{Further|eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality|Mayors of Durban}}With the end of [[apartheid]], Durban was subject to restructuring of local government.

The airport's position forms part of the Golden Triangle between Johannesburg and Cape Town, which is important for convenient travel and trade between these three major South African cities. The airport opened in May 2010. King Shaka International Airport handled 5.99 million passengers in 2018/2019, up 6.6 percent from 2017/2018. King Shaka International was constructed at [[La Mercy, KwaZulu-Natal|La Mercy]], about {{convert|36|km|mi}} north of central Durban.

The [[Port of Durban]], formerly known as the Port of Natal, is one of the few natural [[Harbor|harbour]]s between [[Port Elizabeth]] and Maputo, and is also located at the beginning of a particular weather phenomenon which can cause extremely violent seas. These two features made Durban an extremely busy [[Port|port of call]] for ship repairs when the port was opened in the 1840s. Durban is now the busiest port in South Africa, as well as the third busiest [[Containerization|container port]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].\n\n[[MSC Cruises]] bases one of their cruise ships in Durban from November to April every year. From the 2019/2020 Southern Africa cruise season [[MSC Cruises]] will be basing the [[MSC Orchestra]] in Durban.<ref>https://www.msccruises.co.za/en-za/Cruise-Deals/Cruise_Calendar.aspx</ref> Durban is the most popular cruise hub in Southern Africa. Cruise destinations from Durban on the [[MSC Orchestra|MSC ''Orchestra'']] include [[Mozambique]], [[Mauritius]], [[R\u00e9union]], [[Madagascar]] and other domestic destinations such as Port Elizabeth and Cape Town. For the 2020/2021 cruise season [[MSC Cruises]] will be sending 2 ships being the [[MSC Musica|MSC ''Musica'']] & [[MSC Opera|MSC ''Opera'']] which will include additional cruise dates and [[Seychelles]] being added as a new cruise destination. <ref>https://www.cruiseindustrynews.com/cruise-news/21410-msc-to-double-deployment-in-south-africa.html</ref> Many other ships cruise through Durban every year, including some of the world's biggest, such as the [[RMS Queen Mary 2|RMS ''Queen Mary 2'']], the biggest ocean liner in the world. Durban will be building a brand new R200 million cruise terminal that will be operational in October 2019, the [[Durban Cruise Terminal]]. The tender was awarded to KwaZulu Cruise Terminal (Pty) Ltd which is 70% owned by MSC Cruises SA and 30% by Africa Armada Consortium.

The [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3 Western Freeway]], which links Durban with the economic hinterland of [[Gauteng]], heads west out of the city. The [[N2 road (South Africa)|N2 Outer Ring Road]] links Durban with the [[Eastern Cape]] to the south, and [[Mpumalanga]] in the north. The Western Freeway is particularly important because freight is shipped by truck to and from the [[Witwatersrand]] for transfer to the port.\n\nThe N3 Western Freeway starts in the central business district and heads west under Tollgate Bridge and through the suburbs of Sherwood and Mayville. The [[EB Cloete Interchange]] (which is informally nicknamed the [[Spaghetti Junction]]) lies to the east of Westville, allowing for transfer of traffic between the N2 [[Durban Outer Ring Road|Outer Ring Road]] and the Western Freeway.\n\nThe N2 Outer Ring Road cuts through the city from the north coast to the south coast. It provides a vital link to the coastal towns (such as [[Scottburgh]] and [[Stanger]]) that rely on Durban.\n\nDurban also has a system of freeway and [[Dual carriageway|dual arterial]] metropolitan routes, which connect the sprawling suburbs that lie to the north, west and south of the city. The [[M4 (Durban)|M4]] exists in two segments. The northern segment, named the Ruth First Highway, starts as an alternative highway at [[Ballito]] where it separates from the N2. It passes through the northern suburbs of [[Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal|Umhlanga]] and [[La Lucia]] where it becomes a [[dual carriageway]] and ends at the northern edge of the CBD. The southern segment of the M4, the [[Albert Lutuli]]<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/services/services_news/red-tar-for-southern-freeway]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> Highway, starts at the southern edge of the CBD, connecting through to the old, decommissioned Durban International Airport, where it once again reconnects with the N2 Outer Ring Road.\n\nThe [[M7 (Durban)|M7]] connects the southern industrial basin with the N3 and [[Pinetown]] via [[Queensburgh]] via the N2. The [[M19 (Durban)|M19]] connects the northern suburbs with Pinetown via [[Westville, KwaZulu-Natal|Westville]].\n\nThe [[M13 (Durban)|M13]] is an untolled alternative to the N3 Western Freeway (which is tolled at Mariannhill). It also feeds traffic through [[Gillitts]], [[Kloof]], and Westville. In the Westville area it is called the [[Jan Smuts|Jan Smuts Highway]], while in the Kloof area it is named the [[Arthur Hopewell]] Highway.\n\nA number of streets in Durban were renamed in the late 2000s to the names of figures related to the anti-apartheid struggle, persons related to liberation movements around the world (including [[Che Guevara]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]] and [[SWAPO]]), and others associated with the governing [[African National Congress]].<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/renaming/Final%20Listt-%20Street%20Naming2.xls]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> A few street names were changed in the first round of renaming, followed by a larger second round.<ref>{{cite web|author=Independent Newspapers Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/new-road-names-go-up-1.406687 |title=New road names go up \u2013 Politics &#124; IOL News |work=Independent Online |location=South Africa |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> The renamings provoked incidents of vandalism,<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Bainbridge |year=2009 |url=https://archive.org/details/southafricalesot0000bain |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/southafricalesot0000bain/page/302 302] |title=South Africa, Lesotho & Swaziland |publisher=Lonely Planet |accessdate=2011-09-16|isbn=9781742203751 }}</ref> as well as protests from opposition parties<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/media/cmn/cmnitem.2007-05-06.2303123121/view] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105050226/http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/media/cmn/cmnitem.2007-05-06.2303123121/view|date=5 November 2009}}</ref> and members of the public.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wines |first=Michael |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/world/africa/25durban.html |title=Where the Road to Renaming Does Not Run Smooth |work=The New York Times |date=25 May 2007 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Buses ===\nSeveral companies run long-distance bus services from Durban to the other cities in South Africa.

These people lived throughout the area of present-day [[KwaZulu-Natal]] until the [[Bantu expansion|expansion of Bantu farmers and pastoralists]] from the north saw their gradual displacement, incorporation or extermination. \nLittle is known of the history of the first residents, as there is no [[Recorded history|written history]] of the area until it was sighted by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Exploration|explorer]] [[Vasco da Gama]], who sailed parallel to the KwaZulu-Natal coast at Christmastide in 1497 while searching for a route from Europe to [[India]]. He named the area \"Natal\", or Christmas in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref name=walker1>{{cite book\n|title = A History of Southern Africa\n|author=Eric A. Walker\n|publisher=Longmans\n|origyear = 1928\n|year = 1964\n|location = London\n|chapter = Chapter I: The discovery}}</ref>\n\n=== First European settlers ===\nIn 1822 Lieutenant James King, captain of the ship ''[[HMS Salisbury|Salisbury]]'', together with [[Francis Farewell|Lt. Francis George Farewell]], both ex-[[Royal Navy]] officers from the [[Napoleonic Wars]], were engaged in trade between the [[Cape Colony|Cape]] and [[Maputo Bay|Delagoa Bay]]. On a return trip to the Cape in 1823, they were caught in a very bad storm and decided to risk the Bar and anchor in the Bay of Natal. The crossing went off well and they found safe anchor from the storm.\nLt. King decided to map the Bay and named the \"Salisbury and Farewell Islands\". In 1824 Lt. Farewell, together with a trading company called J. R. Thompson & Co., decided to open trade relations with [[Shaka]] the Zulu King and establish a trading station at the Bay. [[Henry Francis Fynn]], another trader at Delagoa Bay, was also involved in this venture.\nFynn left Delagoa Bay and sailed for the Bay of Natal on the brig ''Julia'', while Farewell followed six weeks later on the ''Antelope''. Between them they had 26 possible settlers, but only 18 stayed. On a visit to King Shaka, Henry Francis Fynn was able to befriend the King by helping him recover from a stab wound suffered as a result of an assassination attempt by one of his half-brothers. As a token of Shaka's gratitude, he granted Fynn a \u201c25-mile strip of coast a hundred miles in depth.\u201d  On 7 August 1824 they concluded negotiations with King Shaka for a cession of land, including the Bay of Natal and land extending ten miles south of the Bay, twenty-five miles north of the Bay and one hundred miles inland. \nFarewell took possession of this grant and raised the [[Union Jack]] with a Royal Salute, which consisted of 4 cannon shots and twenty musket shots. Of the original 18 would-be settlers, only 6 remained, and they can be regarded as the founding members of Port Natal as a British colony. These 6 were joined by Lt. James Saunders King and Nathaniel Isaacs in 1825.\n\nThe modern city of Durban thus dates from 1824 when the settlement was established on the northern shores of the bay near today's Farewell Square.<ref name=walker7>{{cite book\n|title = A History of Southern Africa\n|author=Eric A.

The force arrived on 4 May 1842 and built a fortification that was later to be ''The Old Fort''. On the night of 23/24 May 1842 the British attacked the Voortrekker camp at Congella. The attack failed, and the British had to withdraw to their camp which was put under siege. A local trader [[Dick King]] and his servant Ndongeni were able to escape the blockade and rode to [[Grahamstown]], a distance of {{convert|600|km|abbr=on}} in fourteen days to raise reinforcements.

The seal was produced in 1855 and was replaced in 1882. The new seal contained a coat of arms without helmet or mantling that combined the coats of arms of Sir Benjamin D\u2019Urban and Sir Benjamin Pine. An application was made to register the coat of arms with the [[College of Arms]] in 1906, but this application was rejected on grounds that the design implied that D\u2019Urban and Pine were husband and wife. Nevertheless, the coat of arms appeared on the council's stationery from about 1912. The following year, a helmet and mantling was added to the council's stationery and to the new city seal that was made in 1936. The motto reads \"Debile principium melior fortuna sequitur\"\u2014\"Better fortune follows a humble beginning\".\n\nThe blazon of the arms registered by the South African Bureau of Heraldry and granted to Durban on 9 February 1979.

The [[eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality]] was formed in 1994 after South Africa's first multiracial elections, with its first mayor being [[Sipho Ngwenya]]. The mayor is elected for a five-year term; however Sipho Ngwenya only served two years. In 1996, the city became part of the ''Durban UniCity'' in July 1996 as part of transitional arrangements and to ''eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality'' in 1999, with the adoption of South Africa's new municipal governance system. In July 1996, [[Obed Mlaba]] was appointed mayor of Durban UniCity; in 1999 he was elected to mayor of the eThekwini municipality and re-elected in 2006. Following the May 2011 local elections, James Nxumalo, the former Speaker of the Council, was elected as the new mayor. On 23 August 2016 Zandile Gumede was elected as the new mayor until the 13 August 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.enca.com/south-africa/ancs-zandile-gumede-is-the-new-mayor-of-ethekwini|title=ANC's Zandile Gumede is the new mayor of eThekwini|publisher=}}</ref> On 5 September 2019 Mxolisi Kaunda was sworn in as the new mayor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/news/kwazulu-natal/mxolisi-kaunda-is-officially-durbans-new-mayor-31888285|title=Mxolisi Kaunda is officially Durban's new mayor|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe name of the Durban municipal government, prior to the post-apartheid reorganisations of municipalities, was the ''Durban Corporation'' or ''City of Durban''.<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/bylaws/durban-corporation-transport-bylaws Durban Corporation Bylaws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906142926/http://www1.durban.gov.za/durban/government/bylaws/durban-corporation-transport-bylaws |date=6 September 2015 }}''eThekwini Online''</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nDurban is located on the east coast of South Africa, looking out upon the [[Indian Ocean]].

The [[2009 IPL]] season was played in South Africa, and Durban was selected as a venue. 2010 saw the city host six matches, including a semi-final, in the [[2010 Champions League Twenty20]].\n\nDurban was one of the host cities of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], and [[A1GP]] held a race on a [[Durban street circuit|street circuit in Durban]] from 2006\u20132008. Durban hosted the [[123rd IOC Session]] in July 2011.\n\nThe city is home to [[Greyville Racecourse]], a major [[Thoroughbred horse race|Thoroughbred horse racing]] venue which annually hosts a number of prestigious races including the country's premier event, the [[Durban July Handicap|July Handicap]], and the premier staying event in South Africa, the [[Greyville Gold Cup|Gold Cup]].

The airport's position forms part of the Golden Triangle between Johannesburg and Cape Town, which is important for convenient travel and trade between these three major South African cities. The airport opened in May 2010. King Shaka International Airport handled 5.99 million passengers in 2018/2019, up 6.6 percent from 2017/2018. King Shaka International was constructed at [[La Mercy, KwaZulu-Natal|La Mercy]], about {{convert|36|km|mi}} north of central Durban. All operations at [[Durban International Airport]] have been transferred to [[King Shaka International]] as of 1 May 2010, with plans for flights to [[Singapore]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kigali]], [[Luanda]], [[Lilongwe]] and [[Nairobi]].\n\n=== Sea ===\n[[File:Durban harbor.jpg|thumb|Durban Harbour]]\n\nDurban has a long tradition as a port city. The [[Port of Durban]], formerly known as the Port of Natal, is one of the few natural [[Harbor|harbour]]s between [[Port Elizabeth]] and Maputo, and is also located at the beginning of a particular weather phenomenon which can cause extremely violent seas. These two features made Durban an extremely busy [[Port|port of call]] for ship repairs when the port was opened in the 1840s. Durban is now the busiest port in South Africa, as well as the third busiest [[Containerization|container port]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].\n\n[[MSC Cruises]] bases one of their cruise ships in Durban from November to April every year. From the 2019/2020 Southern Africa cruise season [[MSC Cruises]] will be basing the [[MSC Orchestra]] in Durban.<ref>https://www.msccruises.co.za/en-za/Cruise-Deals/Cruise_Calendar.aspx</ref> Durban is the most popular cruise hub in Southern Africa. Cruise destinations from Durban on the [[MSC Orchestra|MSC ''Orchestra'']] include [[Mozambique]], [[Mauritius]], [[R\u00e9union]], [[Madagascar]] and other domestic destinations such as Port Elizabeth and Cape Town. For the 2020/2021 cruise season [[MSC Cruises]] will be sending 2 ships being the [[MSC Musica|MSC ''Musica'']] & [[MSC Opera|MSC ''Opera'']] which will include additional cruise dates and [[Seychelles]] being added as a new cruise destination. <ref>https://www.cruiseindustrynews.com/cruise-news/21410-msc-to-double-deployment-in-south-africa.html</ref> Many other ships cruise through Durban every year, including some of the world's biggest, such as the [[RMS Queen Mary 2|RMS ''Queen Mary 2'']], the biggest ocean liner in the world. Durban will be building a brand new R200 million cruise terminal that will be operational in October 2019, the [[Durban Cruise Terminal]]. The tender was awarded to KwaZulu Cruise Terminal (Pty) Ltd which is 70% owned by MSC Cruises SA and 30% by Africa Armada Consortium. The new cruise terminal will be able to accommodate two cruise ships at any given time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/article2650355.ece|title=Times LIVE|website=www.timeslive.co.za}}</ref>\n\n[[Naval Base Durban]] on [[Salisbury Island, Durban|Salisbury Island]] (now joined to the mainland and part of the Port of Durban), was established as a [[naval base]] during the [[Second World War]].

These trains terminate at [[Durban railway station]].\n\n[[Metrorail KwaZulu-Natal|Metrorail]] operates a [[commuter rail]] service in Durban and the surrounding area. The Metrorail network runs from Durban Station outwards as far as [[KwaDukuza, KwaZulu-Natal|Stanger]] on the north coast, [[Kelso, KwaZulu-Natal|Kelso]] on the south coast, and [[Cato Ridge, KwaZulu-Natal|Cato Ridge]] inland.\n\nA [[Johannesburg-Durban High Speed Rail|high-speed rail link]] has been proposed, between Johannesburg and Durban.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/ambitious-plans-will-still-need-funding/browse/3.html\n|accessdate=19 September 2010\n|title=Railway Gazette: Ambitious plans will still need funding\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Roads ===\n[[File:DurbanN3-aerial.jpg|thumb|N3 freeway on its approach to Durban's CBD, with N2\u2013N3 [[stack interchange]] in the foreground]]\n\nThe city's main position as a [[port of entry]] onto the southern African continent has led to the development of [[National Roads in South Africa|national roads]] around it. The [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3 Western Freeway]], which links Durban with the economic hinterland of [[Gauteng]], heads west out of the city. The [[N2 road (South Africa)|N2 Outer Ring Road]] links Durban with the [[Eastern Cape]] to the south, and [[Mpumalanga]] in the north. The Western Freeway is particularly important because freight is shipped by truck to and from the [[Witwatersrand]] for transfer to the port.\n\nThe N3 Western Freeway starts in the central business district and heads west under Tollgate Bridge and through the suburbs of Sherwood and Mayville. The [[EB Cloete Interchange]] (which is informally nicknamed the [[Spaghetti Junction]]) lies to the east of Westville, allowing for transfer of traffic between the N2 [[Durban Outer Ring Road|Outer Ring Road]] and the Western Freeway.\n\nThe N2 Outer Ring Road cuts through the city from the north coast to the south coast. It provides a vital link to the coastal towns (such as [[Scottburgh]] and [[Stanger]]) that rely on Durban.\n\nDurban also has a system of freeway and [[Dual carriageway|dual arterial]] metropolitan routes, which connect the sprawling suburbs that lie to the north, west and south of the city. The [[M4 (Durban)|M4]] exists in two segments. The northern segment, named the Ruth First Highway, starts as an alternative highway at [[Ballito]] where it separates from the N2. It passes through the northern suburbs of [[Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal|Umhlanga]] and [[La Lucia]] where it becomes a [[dual carriageway]] and ends at the northern edge of the CBD. The southern segment of the M4, the [[Albert Lutuli]]<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/services/services_news/red-tar-for-southern-freeway]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> Highway, starts at the southern edge of the CBD, connecting through to the old, decommissioned Durban International Airport, where it once again reconnects with the N2 Outer Ring Road.\n\nThe [[M7 (Durban)|M7]] connects the southern industrial basin with the N3 and [[Pinetown]] via [[Queensburgh]] via the N2. The [[M19 (Durban)|M19]] connects the northern suburbs with Pinetown via [[Westville, KwaZulu-Natal|Westville]].\n\nThe [[M13 (Durban)|M13]] is an untolled alternative to the N3 Western Freeway (which is tolled at Mariannhill). It also feeds traffic through [[Gillitts]], [[Kloof]], and Westville. In the Westville area it is called the [[Jan Smuts|Jan Smuts Highway]], while in the Kloof area it is named the [[Arthur Hopewell]] Highway.\n\nA number of streets in Durban were renamed in the late 2000s to the names of figures related to the anti-apartheid struggle, persons related to liberation movements around the world (including [[Che Guevara]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]] and [[SWAPO]]), and others associated with the governing [[African National Congress]].<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/renaming/Final%20Listt-%20Street%20Naming2.xls]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> A few street names were changed in the first round of renaming, followed by a larger second round.<ref>{{cite web|author=Independent Newspapers Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/new-road-names-go-up-1.406687 |title=New road names go up \u2013 Politics &#124; IOL News |work=Independent Online |location=South Africa |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> The renamings provoked incidents of vandalism,<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Bainbridge |year=2009 |url=https://archive.org/details/southafricalesot0000bain |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/southafricalesot0000bain/page/302 302] |title=South Africa, Lesotho & Swaziland |publisher=Lonely Planet |accessdate=2011-09-16|isbn=9781742203751 }}</ref> as well as protests from opposition parties<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/media/cmn/cmnitem.2007-05-06.2303123121/view] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105050226/http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/media/cmn/cmnitem.2007-05-06.2303123121/view|date=5 November 2009}}</ref> and members of the public.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wines |first=Michael |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/world/africa/25durban.html |title=Where the Road to Renaming Does Not Run Smooth |work=The New York Times |date=25 May 2007 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Buses ===\nSeveral companies run long-distance bus services from Durban to the other cities in South Africa. Buses have a long history in Durban. Most of them have been run by Indian owners since the early 1930s. Privately owned buses which are not subsidised by the government also service the communities.

The tree is rooted at the number 1, and any rational number expressed in simplest terms as the [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} has as its two children the numbers {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''a'' + ''b''}}}} and {{math|{{sfrac|''a'' + ''b''|''b''}}}}. Every positive rational number appears exactly once in the tree.\n\nThe sequence of rational numbers in a [[breadth-first search|breadth-first traversal]] of the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree is known as the '''Calkin\u2013Wilf sequence'''. Its sequence of numerators (or, offset by one, denominators) is '''Stern's diatomic series''', and can be computed by the '''fusc function'''.\n\nThe Calkin\u2013Wilf tree is named after Neil Calkin and [[Herbert Wilf]], who considered it in their 2000 paper. The tree was introduced earlier by [[Jean Berstel]] and Aldo de Luca<ref>{{harvtxt|Berstel|de Luca|1997}}, Section 6.</ref> as ''Raney tree'', since they drew some ideas from a paper by George N. Raney.<ref>{{harvtxt|Raney|1973}}.</ref> Stern's diatomic series was formulated much earlier by [[Moritz Abraham Stern]], a 19th-century German mathematician who also invented the closely related [[Stern\u2013Brocot tree]]. Even earlier, a similar tree appears in [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler's]] ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (1619).<ref>{{citation|first=J.|last=Kepler|authorlink=Johannes Kepler|title=Harmonices Mundi|volume=III|page=27|url=https://archive.org/stream/ioanniskepplerih00kepl#page/26/mode/2up|year=1619}}.</ref>\n\n==Definition and structure==\n[[File:Calkin-Wilf tree.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The Calkin\u2013Wilf tree, drawn using an [[H tree]] layout.]]\nThe Calkin\u2013Wilf tree may be defined as a directed graph in which each positive rational number {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} occurs as a vertex and has one outgoing edge to another vertex, its parent. We assume that {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} is in simplest terms; that is, the [[greatest common divisor]] of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is 1. If {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} < 1}}, the parent of {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} is {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b'' \u2212 ''a''}}}}; if {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} > 1}}, the parent of {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} is {{math|{{sfrac|''a'' \u2212 ''b''|''b''}}}}. Thus, in either case, the parent is a fraction with a smaller sum of numerator and denominator, so repeated reduction of this type must eventually reach the number 1. As a graph with one outgoing edge per vertex and one root reachable by all other vertices, the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree must indeed be a tree.\n\nThe children of any vertex in the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree may be computed by inverting the formula for the parents of a vertex. Each vertex {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} has one child whose value is less than 1, {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''a'' + ''b''}}}}, because this is the only value less than 1 whose parent formula leads back to {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}}. Similarly, each vertex {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} has one child whose value is greater than 1, {{math|{{sfrac|''a'' + ''b''|''b''}}}}.<ref>The description here is dual to the original definition by Calkin and Wilf, which begins by defining the child relationship and derives the parent relationship as part of a proof that every rational appears once in the tree. As defined here, every rational appears once by definition, and instead the fact that the resulting structure is a tree requires a proof.</ref>\n\nAlthough it is a binary tree (each vertex has two children), the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree is not a [[binary search tree]]: its inorder does not coincide with the sorted order of its vertices. However, it is closely related to a different binary search tree on the same set of vertices, the [[Stern\u2013Brocot tree]]: the vertices at each level of the two trees coincide, and are related to each other by a [[bit-reversal permutation]].{{sfnp|Gibbons|Lester|Bird|2006}}\n\n==Breadth first traversal==\n[[File:Calkin-Wilf spiral.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Calkin\u2013Wilf sequence, depicted as the red spiral tracing through the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree]]\nThe '''Calkin\u2013Wilf sequence''' is the sequence of rational numbers generated by a breadth-first traversal of the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree,\n:{{sfrac|1|1}}, {{sfrac|1|2}}, {{sfrac|2|1}}, {{sfrac|1|3}}, {{sfrac|3|2}}, {{sfrac|2|3}}, {{sfrac|3|1}}, {{sfrac|1|4}}, {{sfrac|4|3}}, {{sfrac|3|5}}, {{sfrac|5|2}}, {{sfrac|2|5}}, {{sfrac|5|3}}, {{sfrac|3|4}}, \u2026.\nBecause the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree contains every positive rational number exactly once, so does this sequence.<ref>{{harvtxt|Calkin|Wilf|2000}}: \"a list of all positive rational numbers, each appearing once and only once, can be made by writing down {{sfrac|1|1}}, then the fractions on the level just below the top of the tree, reading from left to right, then the fractions on the next level down, reading from left to right, etc.\" {{harvtxt|Gibbons|Lester|Bird|2006}} discuss efficient [[functional programming]] techniques for performing this breadth first traversal.</ref> The denominator of each fraction equals the numerator of the next fraction in the sequence.\nThe Calkin\u2013Wilf sequence can also be generated directly by the formula\n\n:<math>q_{i+1} = \\frac{1}{2\\lfloor q_i\\rfloor - q_i + 1}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''q<sub>i</sub>''}} denotes the {{math|''i''}}th number in the sequence, starting from {{math|''q''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} 1}}, and {{math|\u230a ''q<sub>i</sub>'' \u230b}} represents the [[Floor and ceiling functions|integral part]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Aigner|Ziegler|2004}} credit this formula to Moshe Newman.</ref>\n\nIt's also possible to calculate {{math|''q<sub>i</sub>''}} directly from the [[run-length encoding]] of the [[binary representation]] of {{mvar|i}}:\nthe number of consecutive 1s starting from the least significant bit, then the number of consecutive 0s starting from the first block of 1s, and so on. The sequence of numbers generated in this way gives the [[continued fraction]] representation of {{math|''q<sub>i</sub>''}}.Example:\n\n:i = 1081 = 10000111001<sub>2</sub>: The continued fraction is [1;2,3,4,1] hence {{math|''q''<sub>1081</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|53|37}}}}.\n:i = 1990 = 11111000110<sub>2</sub>: The continued fraction is [0;1,2,3,5] hence {{math|''q''<sub>1990</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|37|53}}}}.\n\nIn the other direction, using the continued fraction of any {{math|''q<sub>i</sub>''}} as the run-length encoding of a binary number gives back {{mvar|i}} itself. Example:\n\n:{{math|''q<sub>i</sub>'' {{=}} {{sfrac|3|4}}}}: The [[continued fraction]] is [0;1,3] hence {{mvar|i}} = 1110<sub>2</sub> = 14.\n:{{math|''q<sub>i</sub>'' {{=}} {{sfrac|4|3}}}}: The [[continued fraction]] is [1;3].

The tree is rooted at the number 1, and any rational number expressed in simplest terms as the [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} has as its two children the numbers {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''a'' + ''b''}}}} and {{math|{{sfrac|''a'' + ''b''|''b''}}}}. Every positive rational number appears exactly once in the tree.\n\nThe sequence of rational numbers in a [[breadth-first search|breadth-first traversal]] of the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree is known as the '''Calkin\u2013Wilf sequence'''. Its sequence of numerators (or, offset by one, denominators) is '''Stern's diatomic series''', and can be computed by the '''fusc function'''.\n\nThe Calkin\u2013Wilf tree is named after Neil Calkin and [[Herbert Wilf]], who considered it in their 2000 paper. The tree was introduced earlier by [[Jean Berstel]] and Aldo de Luca<ref>{{harvtxt|Berstel|de Luca|1997}}, Section 6.</ref> as ''Raney tree'', since they drew some ideas from a paper by George N. Raney.<ref>{{harvtxt|Raney|1973}}.</ref> Stern's diatomic series was formulated much earlier by [[Moritz Abraham Stern]], a 19th-century German mathematician who also invented the closely related [[Stern\u2013Brocot tree]]. Even earlier, a similar tree appears in [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler's]] ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (1619).<ref>{{citation|first=J.|last=Kepler|authorlink=Johannes Kepler|title=Harmonices Mundi|volume=III|page=27|url=https://archive.org/stream/ioanniskepplerih00kepl#page/26/mode/2up|year=1619}}.</ref>\n\n==Definition and structure==\n[[File:Calkin-Wilf tree.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The Calkin\u2013Wilf tree, drawn using an [[H tree]] layout.]]\nThe Calkin\u2013Wilf tree may be defined as a directed graph in which each positive rational number {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} occurs as a vertex and has one outgoing edge to another vertex, its parent. We assume that {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} is in simplest terms; that is, the [[greatest common divisor]] of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is 1. If {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} < 1}}, the parent of {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} is {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b'' \u2212 ''a''}}}}; if {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} > 1}}, the parent of {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} is {{math|{{sfrac|''a'' \u2212 ''b''|''b''}}}}. Thus, in either case, the parent is a fraction with a smaller sum of numerator and denominator, so repeated reduction of this type must eventually reach the number 1. As a graph with one outgoing edge per vertex and one root reachable by all other vertices, the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree must indeed be a tree.\n\nThe children of any vertex in the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree may be computed by inverting the formula for the parents of a vertex. Each vertex {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} has one child whose value is less than 1, {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''a'' + ''b''}}}}, because this is the only value less than 1 whose parent formula leads back to {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}}. Similarly, each vertex {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} has one child whose value is greater than 1, {{math|{{sfrac|''a'' + ''b''|''b''}}}}.<ref>The description here is dual to the original definition by Calkin and Wilf, which begins by defining the child relationship and derives the parent relationship as part of a proof that every rational appears once in the tree. As defined here, every rational appears once by definition, and instead the fact that the resulting structure is a tree requires a proof.</ref>\n\nAlthough it is a binary tree (each vertex has two children), the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree is not a [[binary search tree]]: its inorder does not coincide with the sorted order of its vertices. However, it is closely related to a different binary search tree on the same set of vertices, the [[Stern\u2013Brocot tree]]: the vertices at each level of the two trees coincide, and are related to each other by a [[bit-reversal permutation]].{{sfnp|Gibbons|Lester|Bird|2006}}\n\n==Breadth first traversal==\n[[File:Calkin-Wilf spiral.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Calkin\u2013Wilf sequence, depicted as the red spiral tracing through the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree]]\nThe '''Calkin\u2013Wilf sequence''' is the sequence of rational numbers generated by a breadth-first traversal of the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree,\n:{{sfrac|1|1}}, {{sfrac|1|2}}, {{sfrac|2|1}}, {{sfrac|1|3}}, {{sfrac|3|2}}, {{sfrac|2|3}}, {{sfrac|3|1}}, {{sfrac|1|4}}, {{sfrac|4|3}}, {{sfrac|3|5}}, {{sfrac|5|2}}, {{sfrac|2|5}}, {{sfrac|5|3}}, {{sfrac|3|4}}, \u2026.\nBecause the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree contains every positive rational number exactly once, so does this sequence.<ref>{{harvtxt|Calkin|Wilf|2000}}: \"a list of all positive rational numbers, each appearing once and only once, can be made by writing down {{sfrac|1|1}}, then the fractions on the level just below the top of the tree, reading from left to right, then the fractions on the next level down, reading from left to right, etc.\" {{harvtxt|Gibbons|Lester|Bird|2006}} discuss efficient [[functional programming]] techniques for performing this breadth first traversal.</ref> The denominator of each fraction equals the numerator of the next fraction in the sequence.\nThe Calkin\u2013Wilf sequence can also be generated directly by the formula\n\n:<math>q_{i+1} = \\frac{1}{2\\lfloor q_i\\rfloor - q_i + 1}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''q<sub>i</sub>''}} denotes the {{math|''i''}}th number in the sequence, starting from {{math|''q''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} 1}}, and {{math|\u230a ''q<sub>i</sub>'' \u230b}} represents the [[Floor and ceiling functions|integral part]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Aigner|Ziegler|2004}} credit this formula to Moshe Newman.</ref>\n\nIt's also possible to calculate {{math|''q<sub>i</sub>''}} directly from the [[run-length encoding]] of the [[binary representation]] of {{mvar|i}}:\nthe number of consecutive 1s starting from the least significant bit, then the number of consecutive 0s starting from the first block of 1s, and so on. The sequence of numbers generated in this way gives the [[continued fraction]] representation of {{math|''q<sub>i</sub>''}}.Example:\n\n:i = 1081 = 10000111001<sub>2</sub>: The continued fraction is [1;2,3,4,1] hence {{math|''q''<sub>1081</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|53|37}}}}.\n:i = 1990 = 11111000110<sub>2</sub>: The continued fraction is [0;1,2,3,5] hence {{math|''q''<sub>1990</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|37|53}}}}.\n\nIn the other direction, using the continued fraction of any {{math|''q<sub>i</sub>''}} as the run-length encoding of a binary number gives back {{mvar|i}} itself. Example:\n\n:{{math|''q<sub>i</sub>'' {{=}} {{sfrac|3|4}}}}: The [[continued fraction]] is [0;1,3] hence {{mvar|i}} = 1110<sub>2</sub> = 14.\n:{{math|''q<sub>i</sub>'' {{=}} {{sfrac|4|3}}}}: The [[continued fraction]] is [1;3]. But to use this method, the length of the continued fraction must be an [[odd number]]. So [1;3] should be replaced by the equivalent continued fraction [1;2,1]. Hence {{mvar|i}} = 1001<sub>2</sub> = 9.\n\nA similar conversion between run-length-encoded binary numbers and continued fractions can also be used to evaluate [[Minkowski's question mark function]]; however, in the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree the binary numbers are integers (positions in the breadth-first traversal) while in the question mark function they are real numbers between 0 and 1.\n\n==Stern's diatomic sequence==\n[[File:Fusc plot 4096.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Scatter plot|Scatterplot]] of {{math|fusc(0...4096)}}]]\n'''Stern's diatomic sequence''' is the [[integer sequence]]\n:0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 5, 3, 4, \u2026 {{OEIS|id=A002487}}.\nUsing [[zero-based numbering]], the {{math|''n''}}th value in the sequence is the value {{math|fusc(''n'')}} of the '''fusc function''', named<ref>The fusc name was given in 1976 by [[Edsger W.
