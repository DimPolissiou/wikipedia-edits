The film, from the beginning, tells two stories of the same person, one in colour and the other in black and white.<ref name=sarit>{{cite news|title=Sarit Ray's review: Lucia|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Reviews/Sarit-Ray-s-review-Lucia/Article1-1119075.aspx|accessdate=4 November 2013|newspaper=The Hindustan Times|date=8 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nSanjay, a detective from the Mumbai police Crime Branch starts investigating the incident that caused the protagonist's ([[Sathish Ninasam]]) current state. While Sanjay is going through the protagonist's belongings he stumbles upon some scribbled notes and a mysterious pill. Meanwhile, the police capture two suspects and interrogate them.\n\nThe story starts with Nikki in a village near Mandya, working as an usher/\"torch-shiner\" in a Bengaluru movie theatre owned by Shankranna (Achyuth Kumar). Nikki has insomnia and yearns for a companion. On one of his sleepless nights Nikki is contacted by a drug dealer who gives him Lucia pills as a solution to his sleeping problems. This drug is said to have the capacity to help one dream the life they want, but has the side-effect that upon discontinuation the same dreams turn into nightmares.\n\nWith the help of the Lucia pills, Nikki starts seeing himself as being a successful actor called Nikhil surrounded by people he knows in the real world. Film actor Nikhil's life is depicted in black-and-white. Shankranna, the owner of the theater where Nikki works, had starred in a film in his youth funded by the leader of some goons who now want Shankranna to sign off his theatre for his debt. More events from the dream are followed by similar events in reality as Nikki falls in love with Shwetha ([[Sruthi Hariharan]]) who is a model in the dream and a waitress in reality.\n\nIn the dream, Nikhil and Shwetha hit it off easily at the beginning but later friction arises when Nikhil expresses his discontent about Shwetha working in the film industry. Meanwhile, in reality, Nikki struggles to win Shwetha's heart, who rejects him first due to his low salary but later falls for his humble character. Shwetha's attempts to get Nikki educated and lead him to find a better paying job turns out to be futile and also result in the death of Shankranna in the hands of goons. Frustrated, Nikki chooses to leave Shwetha and continue to work in the theatre, despite the threats. Nikki redecorates the theatre and releases Shankranna's film to the audience. He later reconciles with Shwetha, who agrees to marry him.\n\nIn the dream, Shankranna is kidnapped, and Nikhil rescues him with the help of the police. In the process, all of the goons are either arrested or killed except for the contract killer. Nikhil feels Shankranna is not safe with him and decides to fire him. Nikhil breaks up with Shwetha and sends off all his servants so as to be alone. Later, a visibly disturbed Nikhil finds himself in a thrashed room. Nikhil gets hold of a torch and through its light sees his life as a \"torch-shiner\" projected on the walls of the room.\n\nShwetha is now distraught with being in the limelight and understands what Nikhil had tried to tell her. Nikhil, the actor, meets Shwetha and tells her that he cannot decide if the present moment is a dream or reality but he is ultimately happy. Asking Shwetha to close her eyes, Nikhil jumps off the roof to the confusion of everyone present, including the contract killer waiting to kill him.\n\nAt present, Sanjay with the help of the suspects, performs a sting operation on the drug dealer and learns more about the Lucia pills. Meanwhile, Shwetha is caught in an attempt to kill Nikhil by pulling him off life support. During her interrogation, the whole investigating team along with Shwetha watches a re-run of an interview of the film star Nikhil. In the interview, Nikhil expresses his dissatisfaction of the stardom and reveals that he is actually color blind from an accident in his childhood. He tells the interviewer that he dreams of being a normal person and in fact in one of his dreams he is a \"torch-shiner\" who gets no attention from people and is happily in love with the dream of his life.\n \nSanjay is now convinced that Nikhil is living in his own version of reality and chose to live in that dream rather than in the real world by attempting suicide. Sanjay gets Shwetha to act and behave like she was in Nikhil's dream, and acts himself as if he was a contract killer and shoots the comatose Nikhil in the head with an empty gun. Simultaneously, Nikhil, aware and alive in his dream world finds everything disappearing around him and is killed by a shot to the head. Nikhi wakes up from his coma to see the astonished doctors and Shwetha's relieved face.\n\nAt the end we can see Nikhil, Swetha and Shankaranna (who was dead in Nikhil's dream) enjoying pizza (Swetha worked as pizza waitress in Nikhil's dream) while they operate the projector of an old theater. Thus revealing that it was film star Nikhil's dream to be a commoner like Nikki, and he achieved it through Lucid dreams.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sathish Ninasam]] as Nikki/Nikhil\n* [[Sruthi Hariharan]] as Shwetha\n* [[Achyuth Kumar]] as Shankranna\n* Sanjay as Sanjay (Mumbai police)\n*  Krishna as Deepak (Crime branch officer)\n* Balaji Manohar\n* Hardika Shetty as Kamini\n* Aaryan Achukatla as Aryan (second lead/model)\n* Ram Manjjonaath\n* Venky\n*[[Rishab Shetty]]\n\n==Production==\nIn December 2011 [[Pawan Kumar (director)|Pawan Kumar]] announced on the Web that his next project, after the success of his directorial debut film ''[[Lifeu Ishtene]]'', was going to be ''Lucia''. For the next two months, he met quite a few producers and top actors and found it difficult to fund his film. That led Pawan Kumar to write a post titled Making Enemies on his blog. Three days after it was published, the response was so overwhelming that he decided to pitch the idea of inviting people to produce the film and Pawan Kumar initiated Project Lucia.<ref>[http://postnoon.com/2013/05/26/swimming-against-thetide/127211 Swimming Against TheTide : Postnoon<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://pawantheactor.com/?page_id=1653 Project Lucia | Pawan Kumar<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Lucia is notable for its use of [[crowdfunding]].

The poem is also partially contained in the lyrics of the song Nee Toreda Galigeyali in the soundtrack. Crowdfunding in Kannada movies was another phenomenon that Pawan kick-started. Since then young filmmakers have started to follow CrowdFunding as one of the source for producing their movies like Sushupti Dreams team.\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released in Blu-ray, HD DVD, DVD 5.1, VCD Version From Anand Video Studio.

The film, from the beginning, tells two stories of the same person, one in colour and the other in black and white.<ref name=sarit>{{cite news|title=Sarit Ray's review: Lucia|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Reviews/Sarit-Ray-s-review-Lucia/Article1-1119075.aspx|accessdate=4 November 2013|newspaper=The Hindustan Times|date=8 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nSanjay, a detective from the Mumbai police Crime Branch starts investigating the incident that caused the protagonist's ([[Sathish Ninasam]]) current state. While Sanjay is going through the protagonist's belongings he stumbles upon some scribbled notes and a mysterious pill. Meanwhile, the police capture two suspects and interrogate them.\n\nThe story starts with Nikki in a village near Mandya, working as an usher/\"torch-shiner\" in a Bengaluru movie theatre owned by Shankranna (Achyuth Kumar). Nikki has insomnia and yearns for a companion. On one of his sleepless nights Nikki is contacted by a drug dealer who gives him Lucia pills as a solution to his sleeping problems. This drug is said to have the capacity to help one dream the life they want, but has the side-effect that upon discontinuation the same dreams turn into nightmares.\n\nWith the help of the Lucia pills, Nikki starts seeing himself as being a successful actor called Nikhil surrounded by people he knows in the real world. Film actor Nikhil's life is depicted in black-and-white. Shankranna, the owner of the theater where Nikki works, had starred in a film in his youth funded by the leader of some goons who now want Shankranna to sign off his theatre for his debt. More events from the dream are followed by similar events in reality as Nikki falls in love with Shwetha ([[Sruthi Hariharan]]) who is a model in the dream and a waitress in reality.\n\nIn the dream, Nikhil and Shwetha hit it off easily at the beginning but later friction arises when Nikhil expresses his discontent about Shwetha working in the film industry. Meanwhile, in reality, Nikki struggles to win Shwetha's heart, who rejects him first due to his low salary but later falls for his humble character. Shwetha's attempts to get Nikki educated and lead him to find a better paying job turns out to be futile and also result in the death of Shankranna in the hands of goons. Frustrated, Nikki chooses to leave Shwetha and continue to work in the theatre, despite the threats. Nikki redecorates the theatre and releases Shankranna's film to the audience. He later reconciles with Shwetha, who agrees to marry him.\n\nIn the dream, Shankranna is kidnapped, and Nikhil rescues him with the help of the police. In the process, all of the goons are either arrested or killed except for the contract killer. Nikhil feels Shankranna is not safe with him and decides to fire him. Nikhil breaks up with Shwetha and sends off all his servants so as to be alone. Later, a visibly disturbed Nikhil finds himself in a thrashed room. Nikhil gets hold of a torch and through its light sees his life as a \"torch-shiner\" projected on the walls of the room.\n\nShwetha is now distraught with being in the limelight and understands what Nikhil had tried to tell her. Nikhil, the actor, meets Shwetha and tells her that he cannot decide if the present moment is a dream or reality but he is ultimately happy. Asking Shwetha to close her eyes, Nikhil jumps off the roof to the confusion of everyone present, including the contract killer waiting to kill him.\n\nAt present, Sanjay with the help of the suspects, performs a sting operation on the drug dealer and learns more about the Lucia pills. Meanwhile, Shwetha is caught in an attempt to kill Nikhil by pulling him off life support. During her interrogation, the whole investigating team along with Shwetha watches a re-run of an interview of the film star Nikhil. In the interview, Nikhil expresses his dissatisfaction of the stardom and reveals that he is actually color blind from an accident in his childhood. He tells the interviewer that he dreams of being a normal person and in fact in one of his dreams he is a \"torch-shiner\" who gets no attention from people and is happily in love with the dream of his life.\n \nSanjay is now convinced that Nikhil is living in his own version of reality and chose to live in that dream rather than in the real world by attempting suicide. Sanjay gets Shwetha to act and behave like she was in Nikhil's dream, and acts himself as if he was a contract killer and shoots the comatose Nikhil in the head with an empty gun. Simultaneously, Nikhil, aware and alive in his dream world finds everything disappearing around him and is killed by a shot to the head. Nikhi wakes up from his coma to see the astonished doctors and Shwetha's relieved face.\n\nAt the end we can see Nikhil, Swetha and Shankaranna (who was dead in Nikhil's dream) enjoying pizza (Swetha worked as pizza waitress in Nikhil's dream) while they operate the projector of an old theater. Thus revealing that it was film star Nikhil's dream to be a commoner like Nikki, and he achieved it through Lucid dreams.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sathish Ninasam]] as Nikki/Nikhil\n* [[Sruthi Hariharan]] as Shwetha\n* [[Achyuth Kumar]] as Shankranna\n* Sanjay as Sanjay (Mumbai police)\n*  Krishna as Deepak (Crime branch officer)\n* Balaji Manohar\n* Hardika Shetty as Kamini\n* Aaryan Achukatla as Aryan (second lead/model)\n* Ram Manjjonaath\n* Venky\n*[[Rishab Shetty]]\n\n==Production==\nIn December 2011 [[Pawan Kumar (director)|Pawan Kumar]] announced on the Web that his next project, after the success of his directorial debut film ''[[Lifeu Ishtene]]'', was going to be ''Lucia''. For the next two months, he met quite a few producers and top actors and found it difficult to fund his film. That led Pawan Kumar to write a post titled Making Enemies on his blog. Three days after it was published, the response was so overwhelming that he decided to pitch the idea of inviting people to produce the film and Pawan Kumar initiated Project Lucia.<ref>[http://postnoon.com/2013/05/26/swimming-against-thetide/127211 Swimming Against TheTide : Postnoon<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://pawantheactor.com/?page_id=1653 Project Lucia | Pawan Kumar<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Lucia is notable for its use of [[crowdfunding]].

Using a series of large solar-powered LED signs usually seen on motorways, Guariglia foregrounds the voices of poets, philosophers, thinkers, activists, and global indigenous elders addressing our climate change, global warming, and extinction.\n\nContributors include 16-year-old Swedish political activist, [[Greta Thunberg]], whose protests over the past year have mobilized students across the world and inspired thousands of young people across the UK to protest against political inaction on climate change. The text of her speech sits alongside the voices of global indigenous elders, whose lives are deeply connected to nature and the preservation of ancient human wisdom. Another sign displays the poem \"Rise: From One Island to Another\" by [[Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner]] and Aka Nivi\u00e2na, from the [[Marshall Islands]] and Kalaallit Nunaat ([[Greenland]]) respectively. The islanders\u2019 poem demonstrates the interdependency of the world and forms a call for action to city dwellers in the face of an environmental crisis.\n\nOther writing includes excerpts from French philosopher and sociologist [[Bruno Latour]]\u2019s provocative publications; aphorisms written by eco-theorist [[Timothy Morton]]; and Guariglia\u2019s compiled list of 200 years of extinct species.<ref>https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/reduce-speed-now-justin-brice-guariglia</ref>\n\n=== ''WE ARE THE ASTEROID'' ===\n(2018\u2013present) Guariglia's 'WE ARE THE ASTEROID,' a series of solar-powered [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] message boards that flash eco-[[aphorism]]s, debuted at [[Storm King Art Center]] in the 2018 exhibition entitled \"Indicators: Artists on Climate Change.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stormking.org/indicators/|title=Indicators: Artists on Climate Change \u2013 Storm King Art Center|author=|date=|website=stormking.org|access-date=March 4, 2019}}</ref> The project is part of an ongoing collaboration with eco-theorist [[Timothy Morton]], who wrote the text for the work.

As part of the [[British Invasion]], his [[hit record|hit]] song \"[[You Turn Me On (song)|You Turn Me On]]\" reached number 8 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] in 1965.\n\nHe wrote several books on [[popular music]], beginning with ''After the Ball'', published by [[Penguin Books]] (Britain) and [[Simon & Schuster]] (United States) in 1972. He accompanied his singing by playing the [[ukulele]] and, through his [[gramophone record|records]], concerts, and film work, helped to stimulate the revival of interest in the instrument. His re-creation of the music played aboard the {{RMS|Titanic}} in [[Titanic (1997 film)|the film of that name]] won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1998 for package design and a nomination for Whitcomb's liner notes (''Titanic: Music as Heard on the Fateful Voyage'').\n\n==Early life==\nWhitcomb was born in [[Woking]], Surrey, England.  His father, Pat, worked for his father's film company British Screen Classics in the 1920s, eventually co-starring in ''Mr. Nobody'' (released by Fox in 1929). His father was a trained pianist and encouraged Whitcomb to also play piano. Ian's younger brother Robin accompanied him on drums in their first bands, notably The Ragtime Suwanee Six (1960\u201362) whose manager was [[Denny Cordell]], later to produce records by [[Procol Harum]] and [[Joe Cocker]]. Robin went on to play [[tambourine]] on [[Sonny & Cher]]'s hit \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" (1965).\n\nGrowing up, Whitcomb's chief musical inspirations were [[Phil Harris]], [[Johnnie Ray]], [[Guy Mitchell]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]]. He was sent away to boarding school in 1949 (Newlands, Seaford, [[Sussex]]) at age 8 and there he soon formed a [[tissue paper-and-comb]] band to entertain staff and boys with current hits such as \"[[(Ghost) Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend|Riders in the Sky]]\".\n\n==Main career==\nAt [[Bryanston School|Bryanston]], a [[independent school (UK)|public school]] in Dorset, England, Whitcomb started a [[skiffle]] group in 1957 and then a [[rock and roll]] band in 1959. In the early 1960s, while studying history at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], he became a founding member of Dublin's first{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} [[rhythm and blues]] band, Bluesville. Their second record release, \"This Sporting Life\" (written by [[Brownie McGhee]]), charted in the United States in 1965. Whitcomb's next single, \"[[You Turn Me On (song)|You Turn Me On]]\" reached Billboard's number 8 spot in July 1965.<ref name=Dixon>{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=Daniel|title=Ukulele: The World's Friendliest Instrument|year=2011|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=978-1-4236-0369-6|pages=90\u201391}}</ref> During his summer vacation in 1965, Whitcomb went to America to appear on such television programs as ''[[Shindig!|Shindig]]'', ''[[Hollywood A Go-Go]]'' and ''[[American Bandstand]]''. Whitcomb played the [[Hollywood Bowl]] with [[The Beach Boys]] in 1965 and then toured with [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Kinks]], and [[Sam the Sham]] and the Pharaohs.\n\n\"N-Nervous!\", Whitcomb's next release, was recorded in Hollywood and reached No. 59 in Billboard and No. 47 in Cash Box. He returned to Dublin for his history finals and received a BA [[academic degree|degree]]. In 1966 he turned to early popular song: his version of a 1916 [[Al Jolson]] comedy number, \"Where Did Robinson Crusoe Go with Friday on Saturday Night?\" was a West Coast hit, reviving the ukulele before the emergence of [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]].<ref name=Tranquada>{{cite book|last=Tranquada|first=Jim|title=The Ukulele \u2013 A History|year=2012|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|isbn=978-0-8248-3634-4|pages=154\u20135}}</ref>\n\nAfter making four albums for [[Tower Records]] and producing [[Mae West]] on her album called ''[[Great Balls Of Fire (Mae West album)|Great Balls of Fire]]'' for [[MGM Records]] in 1972, Whitcomb returned to the UK where he began his writing career with ''After the Ball''. He later wrote ''Tin Pan Alley, A Pictorial History'' (1919\u20131939) and a novel, ''Lotusland: A Story of Southern California''.\n\nReturning to Hollywood, Whitcomb starred in and wrote ''L.A.\u2013My Home Town'' (BBC TV; 1976) and ''Tin Pan Alley'' (PBS; 1974). He also provided the music for a documentary film, ''Bugs Bunny: Superstar'' (UA), which was narrated by [[Orson Welles]]. For Play-Rite Music he cut 18 piano rolls that were included in an album, ''Pianomelt''. His other albums reflected his research into the genres of [[ragtime]], [[Tin Pan Alley]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]]. These, beginning with ''Under the Ragtime Moon''  (1972), were released on several [[record label]]s including [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[United Artists]], and [[Decca Records]].

20 April 2020) was an English entertainer, singer-songwriter, record producer, writer and actor. As part of the [[British Invasion]], his [[hit record|hit]] song \"[[You Turn Me On (song)|You Turn Me On]]\" reached number 8 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] in 1965.\n\nHe wrote several books on [[popular music]], beginning with ''After the Ball'', published by [[Penguin Books]] (Britain) and [[Simon & Schuster]] (United States) in 1972. He accompanied his singing by playing the [[ukulele]] and, through his [[gramophone record|records]], concerts, and film work, helped to stimulate the revival of interest in the instrument. His re-creation of the music played aboard the {{RMS|Titanic}} in [[Titanic (1997 film)|the film of that name]] won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1998 for package design and a nomination for Whitcomb's liner notes (''Titanic: Music as Heard on the Fateful Voyage'').\n\n==Early life==\nWhitcomb was born in [[Woking]], Surrey, England.  His father, Pat, worked for his father's film company British Screen Classics in the 1920s, eventually co-starring in ''Mr. Nobody'' (released by Fox in 1929). His father was a trained pianist and encouraged Whitcomb to also play piano. Ian's younger brother Robin accompanied him on drums in their first bands, notably The Ragtime Suwanee Six (1960\u201362) whose manager was [[Denny Cordell]], later to produce records by [[Procol Harum]] and [[Joe Cocker]]. Robin went on to play [[tambourine]] on [[Sonny & Cher]]'s hit \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" (1965).\n\nGrowing up, Whitcomb's chief musical inspirations were [[Phil Harris]], [[Johnnie Ray]], [[Guy Mitchell]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]]. He was sent away to boarding school in 1949 (Newlands, Seaford, [[Sussex]]) at age 8 and there he soon formed a [[tissue paper-and-comb]] band to entertain staff and boys with current hits such as \"[[(Ghost) Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend|Riders in the Sky]]\".\n\n==Main career==\nAt [[Bryanston School|Bryanston]], a [[independent school (UK)|public school]] in Dorset, England, Whitcomb started a [[skiffle]] group in 1957 and then a [[rock and roll]] band in 1959. In the early 1960s, while studying history at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], he became a founding member of Dublin's first{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} [[rhythm and blues]] band, Bluesville. Their second record release, \"This Sporting Life\" (written by [[Brownie McGhee]]), charted in the United States in 1965. Whitcomb's next single, \"[[You Turn Me On (song)|You Turn Me On]]\" reached Billboard's number 8 spot in July 1965.<ref name=Dixon>{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=Daniel|title=Ukulele: The World's Friendliest Instrument|year=2011|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=978-1-4236-0369-6|pages=90\u201391}}</ref> During his summer vacation in 1965, Whitcomb went to America to appear on such television programs as ''[[Shindig!|Shindig]]'', ''[[Hollywood A Go-Go]]'' and ''[[American Bandstand]]''. Whitcomb played the [[Hollywood Bowl]] with [[The Beach Boys]] in 1965 and then toured with [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Kinks]], and [[Sam the Sham]] and the Pharaohs.\n\n\"N-Nervous!\", Whitcomb's next release, was recorded in Hollywood and reached No. 59 in Billboard and No. 47 in Cash Box. He returned to Dublin for his history finals and received a BA [[academic degree|degree]]. In 1966 he turned to early popular song: his version of a 1916 [[Al Jolson]] comedy number, \"Where Did Robinson Crusoe Go with Friday on Saturday Night?\" was a West Coast hit, reviving the ukulele before the emergence of [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]].<ref name=Tranquada>{{cite book|last=Tranquada|first=Jim|title=The Ukulele \u2013 A History|year=2012|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|isbn=978-0-8248-3634-4|pages=154\u20135}}</ref>\n\nAfter making four albums for [[Tower Records]] and producing [[Mae West]] on her album called ''[[Great Balls Of Fire (Mae West album)|Great Balls of Fire]]'' for [[MGM Records]] in 1972, Whitcomb returned to the UK where he began his writing career with ''After the Ball''. He later wrote ''Tin Pan Alley, A Pictorial History'' (1919\u20131939) and a novel, ''Lotusland: A Story of Southern California''.\n\nReturning to Hollywood, Whitcomb starred in and wrote ''L.A.\u2013My Home Town'' (BBC TV; 1976) and ''Tin Pan Alley'' (PBS; 1974). He also provided the music for a documentary film, ''Bugs Bunny: Superstar'' (UA), which was narrated by [[Orson Welles]]. For Play-Rite Music he cut 18 piano rolls that were included in an album, ''Pianomelt''. His other albums reflected his research into the genres of [[ragtime]], [[Tin Pan Alley]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]]. These, beginning with ''Under the Ragtime Moon''  (1972), were released on several [[record label]]s including [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[United Artists]], and [[Decca Records]]. During that time he also wrote and produced singles for Warner Bros.' country division, most notably \"Hands\", a [[massage parlour]] story, and \"A Friend of a Friend of Mine\".\n\nIn the 1980s Whitcomb published ''Rock Odyssey: A Chronicle of the Sixties: Ian Whitcomb'', a memoir of the 1960s and described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as the best personal account of this period. He also published ''Ragtime America'' (Limelight Editions, 1988), followed by a memoir of life as a British expatriate living in Los Angeles, ''Resident Alien'' (Century, 1990). He produced a British documentary on black music, ''Legends of Rhythm and Blues'' (part of the series ''Repercussions'', made by Third Eye Productions for [[Channel Four]] in 1984). During this time he also hosted a [[radio show]] in Los Angeles for fifteen years, taking the program from [[KROQ-FM]] to [[KCRW]] and finally to [[KPCC-FM]].<ref>[http://www.laradio.com/wherew.htm Profile], laradio.com; accessed 7 July 2015.</ref> His songs can he heard in the films ''Bloody Movie'' (1987), ''[[Cold Sassy Tree]]'' (1989), ''[[Encino Man]]'' (1992), ''[[Grass (1999 film)|Grass]]'' (1999), '' [[Man of the Century]]'' (1999), ''Stanley's Gig'' (2000), ''After the Storm'' (2001), ''[[The Cat's Meow]]'' (2002), ''[[Last Call (2002 film)|Last Call]]'' (2002), ''Sleep Easy, Hutch Rimes'' (2002), ''[[Lonesome Jim]]'' (2005), and ''[[Fido (film)|Fido]]'' (2006).   Ian appeared as Grand Marshal in the 24th Occasional Pasadena Doo Dah Parade on November 19, 1999.[https://pasadenadoodahparade.info/archives/]\n\n==Later life==\nWhitcomb performed at music festivals throughout America. He continued to write, and he made frequent guest appearances. He was a regular performer at Cantalini's Restaurant [http://salernobeach.com/music/] in Playa del Rey, California. He also visited Zelo Pizzeria in Arcadia, California on a weekly basis.[https://www.yelp.com/biz/zelo-gourmet-pizza-arcadia]\n\nFrom 7 November 2007, Whitcomb had an [[internet radio]] program on Wednesday evenings from 8:00&nbsp;p.m. until 10:00&nbsp;p.m.(PST) at [http://LuxuriaMusic.com LuxuriaMusic.com].
