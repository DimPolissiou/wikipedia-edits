Rainfall is ample throughout the year, though dry spells do occur on occasion. Severe weather of [[Houston]] mostly takes the form of flooding, which happens a lot during between May to October, which is the city's [[wet season]].  [[Supercell]] thunderstorms sometimes bring [[tornado]]es to the area, most commonly during spring.  Houston sometimes experiences [[tropical cyclone]]s during the [[Atlantic hurricane season]], which can bring heavy rain and significant damage to the city.

George Bush Intercontinental Airport sees an average of 9.6 days per year of freezing temperatures.<ref name=normals /> Cold fronts during the winter can drop nighttime lows into the 30s but usually above freezing. The coldest weather of the season often includes temperatures in the low 30s to mid-40s at night. Hard freezes are not uncommon in North Houston; however, [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] has recorded at least one freeze every winter since it opened in 1969, although areas in the central or southern parts of the metro area are consistently several degrees warmer on the coldest winter nights. Areas south of [[Interstate 10]] can go for entire winters without a freeze. The coldest temperature ever recorded at George Bush Intercontinental Airport was {{convert|7|\u00b0F}} on December 23, 1989. Elsewhere, the temperature in Houston dropped to {{convert|5|\u00b0F}} on January 18, 1930.<ref>[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/hgx/?n=climate_iah_normals_jan National Weather Service]</ref> The all-time record low at Houston's Hobby Airport, closer to the city, is {{convert|9|\u00b0F}}.\n\nIn December, southward-moving cold fronts <ref>TSHA Handbook of Texas.

Early January is the coldest time of the year, with temperatures moderating slightly by February. Winter is also the driest part of the year for Houston.\n\n===Spring===\n[[Spring (season)|Spring]] comes with a gradual warm up from winter, lasting from February through May. Temperatures are generally not hot yet, averaging from {{convert|75|-|82|F|C|1}} in the day and {{convert|56|-|64|F|C|1}} at night.

Sea breeze showers which are monsoon-like (especially during the summer months, originating from the mesoscale convective cycle, where the polar jet stream usually forms an [[Block (meteorology)|omega block]]) are common throughout the Texas Gulf Coast area (from Brownsville to the Florida Peninsula), which has a similar climate to areas like [[Mumbai]] and [[Kolkata]] \u2013 locals refer to the sea breeze showers as the Gulf Coast Monsoon (also called the Gulf of Mexico or the Texas Monsoon), despite Houston being 50 feet above sea level. The sea breeze showers are also a contributor to the [[North American Monsoon]].\n\nSleet and freezing rain are more common than snow in the Houston area. While accumulating snow events are rare in Houston, brief snow flurries occur every winter in the greater Houston area. These usually have no impacts on travel as they are light, brief and isolated. Hail can accumulate but only in small quantities.\n\n==Extreme weather==\nHouston has occasional severe weather, mostly [[flooding]]. Hurricanes that have the potential to [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] bring severe damage to the area. Seven major hurricanes have hit the Galveston and Houston areas in the past 100 years. Four have done significant damage to Houston.\n\n===Hurricanes and tropical storms===\nBecause Houston is on the Gulf of Mexico, the city has a small chance of being hit by hurricanes or [[tropical storms]] every [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] (June through November).\n\nIn 1837, the [[1837 Racer's Storm|Racer's Storm]] passed just to the south of the town, raising water levels four feet.<ref>http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lch/research/txearly19hur.php Early Texas Hurricane History, 1800-1850, Retrieved on March 10, 2007</ref>  The [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900|Great Hurricane of 1900]] destroyed the nearby (and then much bigger) city of Galveston, which is situated on a barrier island {{convert|50|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of downtown Houston.

The storm completely overwhelmed the flood control system and caused 22 deaths in Houston and $6.05 billion (2006 USD) in damage. It is the only tropical storm in history to have its name retired.\n\n[[Tropical Storm Erin (2007)|Tropical Storm Erin]] made landfall in August 2007 with heavy rainfall. A total of {{convert|9|in|mm}} of rain fell elsewhere than [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] on August 16, and many roads and neighborhoods were flooded. [[Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas]], halted its [[METRORail|light rail]] and bus services in view of the effects. Four deaths in the city were attributed to the storm. The [[Houston Fire Department]] reported 72 rescue operations.\n\n[[Hurricane Ike]] made landfall near [[Galveston, Texas]] in September 2008. Although only a Category 2 storm (out of 5), Ike brought moderate rain but high winds for an unusually long duration (upwards of nine hours). The roof of Reliant Stadium (home of the Houston Texans NFL team) was damaged and windows were blown out of several high-rise buildings in downtown Houston. Storm surge affected areas around Galveston Bay, stripping some coastal islands of homes. Devastated Galveston Island much resembled a war zone.  Authorities prohibited non-emergency access to the island for many weeks. Hurricane Ike left ninety percent of people in the Houston Area without power.<ref>http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/6000312.html</ref> Never before had the city experienced such widespread or long-term power outage: no air conditioning, no refrigeration, no lights, and no phones.

Trucks from around the country brought in emergency supplies, especially water and ice. Most of the city was without power for 2-3 days \u2014 some for 2 to 3 weeks.\n\n[[Hurricane Harvey]] made landfall in [[Rockport, Texas]], very early on August 26, 2017. By August 30, Houston was flooded, due to torrential rainfall from the hurricane.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/aug/26/hurricane-harvey-makes-landfall-in-texas-latest-updates |title=Hurricane Harvey makes landfall in Texas|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html|title=Storm Summary Number 17 for Tropical Storm Harvey|publisher=[[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/harvey-atlantic-ocean?|title=NASA shows how Harvey saturated Texas}}</ref>\n\n===Flooding===\nFlooding is a recurring problem in Houston. It is especially severe in low-lying areas on the far east end of town along the San Jacinto River. The flat wetlands and paved-over coastal prairie around Houston drain slowly and easily flood. The area is drained by a network of bayous (small, slow-moving rivers, often dredged and enlarged to increase volume) and man-made drainage ditches, which are usually dry most of the year. In fall, cold fronts bring in rainstorms and flooding is not uncommon. This might flood certain low-lying intersections, but doesn't generally affect citizens or the business of the city. However, occasionally very heavy thunderstorms dump so much water on the city that widespread congestion and even property damage in low-lying areas result. Tropical Storm Allison in 2001 was so severe that many parts of town that had never flooded before were flooded seriously. Interstate 10 near downtown, which is below grade, was covered by over {{convert|10|ft|abbr=on}} of water. Another storm happened in June 2015 ([[Tropical Storm Bill (2015)#Texas|Tropical Storm Bill]]) that had a similar impact on Houston, causing several highways to be closed due to the bayou overflowing; this event followed [[2015 Texas\u2013Oklahoma flood and tornado outbreak#Houston|flooding from May 24\u201326]]. Another [[April 2016 United States storm complex#Impact|similar storm in April 2016]] resulted in widespread, severe flooding across Houston and surrounding suburbs in an event later known as the \"Tax Day Floods\". In late August 2017, [[Hurricane Harvey#Houston metropolitan area flooding|Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston]], causing severe widespread damage and at least 14 deaths.\n\n===Tornadoes===\nUnlike [[Dallas]], Houston is not in [[Tornado Alley]]; however, smaller [[tornado]]es can occur during severe weather. They are most likely to be found along frontal boundaries of an [[air mass]] during the spring months. Tornadoes in Houston usually measure a weak F1 on the older [[Fujita scale]] and cause light to moderate damage to well-constructed buildings. The strongest recorded tornado in Houston history was an F4 on November 21, 1992, part of a [[November 1992 tornado outbreak|large outbreak]] of tornadoes in Harris County.<ref>{{cite news|title = KTRK coverage of the aftermath of the November 1992 tornado outbreak|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxFf4itH5d8|date = 22 November 1992}} {{cite news|last1 = Berger|first1 = Eric|title = Houston\u2019s top five weather events since 1992: No. 3|url = http://blog.chron.com/sciguy/2008/05/houstons-top-five-weather-events-since-1992-no-3/|accessdate = 23 November 2015|publisher = Houston Chronicle|date = 29 May 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Winter storms===\nThere are usually a few days of freezing (<{{convert|32|F|abbr=on}}) temperatures each year, though the average low in January, the coldest month, is still only {{convert|43|F}} or {{convert|24|F}}.\n\nSnow falls infrequently in the [[Magnolia City]]. When it does occur, it usually melts immediately on the ground with light accumulation on roofs and raised surfaces. Only very uncommonly does it accumulate on the ground. Since 1895, it has snowed 39 times in Houston at an average of about once every 3 years, though some decades have several instances of recorded snowfall while others have only one each (e.g., the 1930s and 1950s) and one decade where there wasn't any snowfall (1990s).

Increased clouds during El-Ni\u00f1o winters are what keep the temperatures from warming up. During La Ni\u00f1a events, the jet stream shifts further north, resulting in a warmer and drier winter. The chance of damage from tropical storms and hurricanes also goes up during La Ni\u00f1a events, due to decreased Atlantic wind shear. Post-El Ni\u00f1o weather during the spring usually result in increased rainfall, as demonstrated during the Memorial Day 2015 and Tax Day/Memorial Day/early June 2016 flood events, where the Houston Metro area (and the rest of the state) experienced a climate similar to the South Asian summer monsoon (in this case, a stalled low-pressure system\u2014usually from an upper-level low from the northeast Pacific Ocean, migrates east, where the northern polar jet stream form the usual [[Block (meteorology)|omega blocks]]\u2014originates over the Four Corners region or the Sierra Madre Occidental/Sierra Madre Oriental mountain ranges in northern Mexico).\n\n==Environmental issues==\n[[File:HoustonBushTerminalATrashcan.JPG|thumb|Trash and recycle bin at [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]]]]\nHouston has had a troubled past with pollution of many types. This is due to the fact that Houston has been the home for the oil and gas industry since its inception in the early 1900s, when there was little environmental regulation. Harris County, where the bulk of the city has been historically located, is home to 15 [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] [[Superfund]] sites, more than any other area in Texas. The list contains numerous companies, streets and waterways that have been considered hazardous to humans in various ways.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/tx.htm The EPA's Superfund list for Texas]</ref>\n\nHouston's environmental problems stem from a long history of pollution. Houston may be considered the air-conditioning capital of the world due to its hot and humid metropolitan. Since the 1930s, air-conditioning was built into all commercial buildings like theaters, malls, and corporations. Even the [[Astrodome]] was air-conditioned, making baseball players and fans comfortable for decades. This led to the possibility of an energy crisis, because of the popularity of air-conditioning in Houston, energy costs are generally higher than normal.<ref>Melosi, Martin V., and Joseph A. Pratt.

Four have done significant damage to Houston.\n\n===Hurricanes and tropical storms===\nBecause Houston is on the Gulf of Mexico, the city has a small chance of being hit by hurricanes or [[tropical storms]] every [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] (June through November).\n\nIn 1837, the [[1837 Racer's Storm|Racer's Storm]] passed just to the south of the town, raising water levels four feet.<ref>http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lch/research/txearly19hur.php Early Texas Hurricane History, 1800-1850, Retrieved on March 10, 2007</ref>  The [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900|Great Hurricane of 1900]] destroyed the nearby (and then much bigger) city of Galveston, which is situated on a barrier island {{convert|50|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of downtown Houston.

The storm completely overwhelmed the flood control system and caused 22 deaths in Houston and $6.05 billion (2006 USD) in damage. It is the only tropical storm in history to have its name retired.\n\n[[Tropical Storm Erin (2007)|Tropical Storm Erin]] made landfall in August 2007 with heavy rainfall. A total of {{convert|9|in|mm}} of rain fell elsewhere than [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] on August 16, and many roads and neighborhoods were flooded. [[Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas]], halted its [[METRORail|light rail]] and bus services in view of the effects. Four deaths in the city were attributed to the storm. The [[Houston Fire Department]] reported 72 rescue operations.\n\n[[Hurricane Ike]] made landfall near [[Galveston, Texas]] in September 2008. Although only a Category 2 storm (out of 5), Ike brought moderate rain but high winds for an unusually long duration (upwards of nine hours). The roof of Reliant Stadium (home of the Houston Texans NFL team) was damaged and windows were blown out of several high-rise buildings in downtown Houston. Storm surge affected areas around Galveston Bay, stripping some coastal islands of homes. Devastated Galveston Island much resembled a war zone.  Authorities prohibited non-emergency access to the island for many weeks. Hurricane Ike left ninety percent of people in the Houston Area without power.<ref>http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/6000312.html</ref> Never before had the city experienced such widespread or long-term power outage: no air conditioning, no refrigeration, no lights, and no phones. Day-to-day business slowed immensely. Area grocery stores were stripped bare and sold water and ice for cash by flashlight. Trucks from around the country brought in emergency supplies, especially water and ice. Most of the city was without power for 2-3 days \u2014 some for 2 to 3 weeks.\n\n[[Hurricane Harvey]] made landfall in [[Rockport, Texas]], very early on August 26, 2017. By August 30, Houston was flooded, due to torrential rainfall from the hurricane.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/aug/26/hurricane-harvey-makes-landfall-in-texas-latest-updates |title=Hurricane Harvey makes landfall in Texas|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html|title=Storm Summary Number 17 for Tropical Storm Harvey|publisher=[[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/harvey-atlantic-ocean?|title=NASA shows how Harvey saturated Texas}}</ref>\n\n===Flooding===\nFlooding is a recurring problem in Houston. It is especially severe in low-lying areas on the far east end of town along the San Jacinto River. The flat wetlands and paved-over coastal prairie around Houston drain slowly and easily flood. The area is drained by a network of bayous (small, slow-moving rivers, often dredged and enlarged to increase volume) and man-made drainage ditches, which are usually dry most of the year. In fall, cold fronts bring in rainstorms and flooding is not uncommon. This might flood certain low-lying intersections, but doesn't generally affect citizens or the business of the city. However, occasionally very heavy thunderstorms dump so much water on the city that widespread congestion and even property damage in low-lying areas result. Tropical Storm Allison in 2001 was so severe that many parts of town that had never flooded before were flooded seriously. Interstate 10 near downtown, which is below grade, was covered by over {{convert|10|ft|abbr=on}} of water. Another storm happened in June 2015 ([[Tropical Storm Bill (2015)#Texas|Tropical Storm Bill]]) that had a similar impact on Houston, causing several highways to be closed due to the bayou overflowing; this event followed [[2015 Texas\u2013Oklahoma flood and tornado outbreak#Houston|flooding from May 24\u201326]]. Another [[April 2016 United States storm complex#Impact|similar storm in April 2016]] resulted in widespread, severe flooding across Houston and surrounding suburbs in an event later known as the \"Tax Day Floods\". In late August 2017, [[Hurricane Harvey#Houston metropolitan area flooding|Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston]], causing severe widespread damage and at least 14 deaths.\n\n===Tornadoes===\nUnlike [[Dallas]], Houston is not in [[Tornado Alley]]; however, smaller [[tornado]]es can occur during severe weather. They are most likely to be found along frontal boundaries of an [[air mass]] during the spring months. Tornadoes in Houston usually measure a weak F1 on the older [[Fujita scale]] and cause light to moderate damage to well-constructed buildings. The strongest recorded tornado in Houston history was an F4 on November 21, 1992, part of a [[November 1992 tornado outbreak|large outbreak]] of tornadoes in Harris County.<ref>{{cite news|title = KTRK coverage of the aftermath of the November 1992 tornado outbreak|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxFf4itH5d8|date = 22 November 1992}} {{cite news|last1 = Berger|first1 = Eric|title = Houston\u2019s top five weather events since 1992: No. 3|url = http://blog.chron.com/sciguy/2008/05/houstons-top-five-weather-events-since-1992-no-3/|accessdate = 23 November 2015|publisher = Houston Chronicle|date = 29 May 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Winter storms===\nThere are usually a few days of freezing (<{{convert|32|F|abbr=on}}) temperatures each year, though the average low in January, the coldest month, is still only {{convert|43|F}} or {{convert|24|F}}.\n\nSnow falls infrequently in the [[Magnolia City]]. When it does occur, it usually melts immediately on the ground with light accumulation on roofs and raised surfaces. Only very uncommonly does it accumulate on the ground. Since 1895, it has snowed 39 times in Houston at an average of about once every 3 years, though some decades have several instances of recorded snowfall while others have only one each (e.g., the 1930s and 1950s) and one decade where there wasn't any snowfall (1990s). The last recorded snowfall in Houston was on November 13, 2018.<ref>http://www.wxresearch.com/snowhou.htm</ref> There were more incidences of snow in the 1980s on average than any other decade recorded, but the 2000s also witnessed more frequent and record-breaking snows.\n\n* February 14\u2013February 15, 1895: {{convert|20|in|cm}} of snow, its largest snowfall from one storm on record.<ref>\"[http://abc13.com/amp/weather/snow-in-houston----it-happens-more-than-you-think/2753082/ Snow in Houston: It Happens More Than You Think]\".

An overnight event occurred from January&nbsp;23, 2014 to January&nbsp;24, another significant icing occurred a few days later on January&nbsp;28, and a third event took place on March&nbsp;4.

Temperatures started in the low-mid 30s and quickly dropped to the 20s in the afternoon, and before dipping into the teens by the evening/overnight hours, which caused all the rain to turn to ice, accumulating a thickness up to 1' on some roads, bridges, overpasses, making it one of the worst winter storms in the history of the state.\n\n==El Ni\u00f1o==\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o events, Houston winters are cooler and wetter than normal due to a stronger southern [[jet stream]], which can increase the length of the normal [[wet season]] in Houston. Increased clouds during El-Ni\u00f1o winters are what keep the temperatures from warming up. During La Ni\u00f1a events, the jet stream shifts further north, resulting in a warmer and drier winter. The chance of damage from tropical storms and hurricanes also goes up during La Ni\u00f1a events, due to decreased Atlantic wind shear. Post-El Ni\u00f1o weather during the spring usually result in increased rainfall, as demonstrated during the Memorial Day 2015 and Tax Day/Memorial Day/early June 2016 flood events, where the Houston Metro area (and the rest of the state) experienced a climate similar to the South Asian summer monsoon (in this case, a stalled low-pressure system\u2014usually from an upper-level low from the northeast Pacific Ocean, migrates east, where the northern polar jet stream form the usual [[Block (meteorology)|omega blocks]]\u2014originates over the Four Corners region or the Sierra Madre Occidental/Sierra Madre Oriental mountain ranges in northern Mexico).\n\n==Environmental issues==\n[[File:HoustonBushTerminalATrashcan.JPG|thumb|Trash and recycle bin at [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]]]]\nHouston has had a troubled past with pollution of many types. This is due to the fact that Houston has been the home for the oil and gas industry since its inception in the early 1900s, when there was little environmental regulation. Harris County, where the bulk of the city has been historically located, is home to 15 [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] [[Superfund]] sites, more than any other area in Texas. The list contains numerous companies, streets and waterways that have been considered hazardous to humans in various ways.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/tx.htm The EPA's Superfund list for Texas]</ref>\n\nHouston's environmental problems stem from a long history of pollution. Houston may be considered the air-conditioning capital of the world due to its hot and humid metropolitan. Since the 1930s, air-conditioning was built into all commercial buildings like theaters, malls, and corporations. Even the [[Astrodome]] was air-conditioned, making baseball players and fans comfortable for decades. This led to the possibility of an energy crisis, because of the popularity of air-conditioning in Houston, energy costs are generally higher than normal.<ref>Melosi, Martin V., and Joseph A. Pratt.

Could the people of Da'uniba who are protectors (''Mabuco'' warriors) of the chiefly title of Cakaudrove be part of a previous migration by Vueti warrior son of Bui Savulu (Bureta)  and Vaula of Moturiki-who eventually moved to Vuna? Naulumatua - Mai Vunibua, was Lutunasobasoba's grandson, who is told in Laucala folklore to have established Laucala's hegemony after leaving Bua and parts of Cakaudrove-i-wai to settle in Nauluvatu, Laucala. His dwelling was Navosalagi.\n\nNaulumatua possibly journeyed from Bua (after leaving his two sons to rule Bua) and finally settled in Northern Taveuni Islands, Qamea and Laucala Islands and the smaller Northern Lau islands. Mai Vunibua originally settled in Nauluvatu (and Navosailagi (Speaker to the heaven) a fortified village dwelling foundation (destroyed during the building of Laucala Resort) on Laucala Island and later after several generations later the people relocated to Nalotu (during the Tongan Wesleyan missionary influence). Mai Vunibua had seven sons (Mana'o tea-tea, Mai Sau-ana, Ta-bareva, Le'a, Lagi ni' Oro, Tu-i-Domoniwai and Dela-i-'Amou) \n\n[[File:Qaraniyaku - By Shelly Sayes - Cakaudrove Ideology and Reality in a Fijian Confederation.png|thumb]]\n\n'''<u>The Yavusa - Vua-ni-cau</u>.''' Mana'o tea-tea (Wainivava) people spread out to Northern Taveuni with a major settlement on Naselesele/Narova over Matei overlooking the waters off North-South Taveuni. Narova in Laucala overlooked the waters to the North and linked to Narova/Naselesele.  \n\n'''<u>Vuanicau Hierarchy</u>''' - After Mai Vunibua, The '''''Vuanicau Yavusa''''' leadership succession was as follows:  '''''Mana'o tea-tea''<nowiki/>'s''' mother may have been of Polynesian blood.  He was istalled '''''<nowiki/>'Vunivalu'<nowiki/>''''' and led the people until his death. '''Ta-bareva (Qilo)''' remained on Southern Laucala Island and later Yanuca Island. '''''Le'a (Cau-Leve)''''' moved to Northern outer islands. '''''Lagi ni' Oro (Lomanikoro)''''' moved to Northern outer islands.

'''''Dela-i-'Amou (Delaiamou)''''' settled on Qamea Island. \n\nVua'ta'i (descendant of Mai Sau-ana (Qara-ni-yau (yaku)[https://www.facebook.com/TogoVillageQameaIslandFiji/?rc=p]) was installed as Vunivalu after Mana'o tea-tea; the people (Qara-ni-yau (yaku)  remained in Laucala Island until the arrival of Waqanawanawa (originally known as Vua-ni-Sinu after returning from a visit to kin clan of Daunisai in Kabara).  Waqanawanawa accompanied by Mai-Naulusole and Mai-Nabuadugu of the Vuanisinu clan (Cakaudrove i Wai). \n\nEmpirical research by Shelly Sayes (Australian National University) in 1979, shed light to the history of the Laucala people originating from Mai Vunibua possibly Naulumatua. The research which collected 'story lines' from sub-chiefs from Cakaudrove, tells of possible parallel waves of migration from Verata by Naulumatua ( and others such as Waqanawanawa and brother Ului [who became Ului of Lakeba] ) to Vanua Levu, Northern Taveuni islands parts of Vanua Balavu and other islands - in waves over a period of many, many years depending on socio-economic and political structure stability and strength.  \n\nSayes collections of stories were confined to the Tuis and matanivanua's and elders (most if not all have passed on such as Tui Laucala and brother Josefa Velodroka whose versions were captured in Loloi and Naqara). The Qaraniyaku elders were not interviewed, hence Sayes confining observations or evidence from the Native Land Commission collections, missionary Journals, etc.  \n\n'''<u>Dating of Occupation.</u>''' Shelly Sayes (Australian National University) in 1979 suggests that archaeological evidence from information by Frost  (''E.L. Frost, 'Fiji' in J.D. Jennings (ed), The prehistory of Polynesia (Canberra 1979), 61-68'') points to the theory that Laucala may have been settled from as early as 16 BC to 6 BC based on archaeological evidence associated with makers of  ''La pita''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usp.ac.fj/news/story.php?id=80|title=Mana - the true face of Lapita|publisher=University of the South Pacific|date=Aug 11, 2005|website=|url-status=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> pottery \" ''which shows a continuous distribution from Melanesia to Western Polynesia--from as early as the sixteenth century BC to sixth century BC. Current linguistic theory argues that these people spoke an early Polynesian language. As La pita pottery has been found on southern Viti Levu as well as Vanua Levu, Laucala, and the Lau islands including Lakeba, it may be argued that, if there are not the settlers of the migration traditions, '''most areas had known settlement prior to the movement eastward'''''.\"   \n\nSome body of work by historians and researchers are flawed and challengable because studies fail to consider key fibres of sociology and common existence to link for instance La-Pita 'pottery' influence to socio-political and economic growth.   \n\nSubsistence-based tribal settlers may have systematically flowed-on to new islands as population exploded. Major influencing factors were economic growth/development and stable socio-political structures of the ''matanitu - vanua -'' a collective of  ''yavusa,'' ''mataqali'' and ''tokatokas''. This may have taken more than a hundred years (possibly 150-450 years) for a hegemony to evolve considering that average motality age was 60 years - two generations, father and son would see a part each  (beginging and end) of the century. . Also before European contact and reporting, the Fijians existed in small collective tribes and not confederacies of today (which are Colonial British influence). We should note that tribal groups movement or travelling through a body of land or even ocean in the past would have been a gargantuan feat. The primitive nature of engineering and developing tools, felling trees, and building canoes such as huge outriggers ( ''Drua'') to travel the immense body of Fiji waters, would have take even a collective group of small  tribes generations to achieve; let alone culturally establishing itself politically into a '''''matanitu vanua''''' unit with different '''''yavusas''''' with distinct capability roles (such as - engineers [ '''''mata-i-sa''u''' ], farmers/cultivators [dautei], combat/protection elements or warriors ''[ '''bati leka and balavu''' ]'', health [ '''''dau/liga ni wa''i''' ], fisherman/maritime [ '''''gone-dau/dausoko''' ]'' and Logistics ''[ '''dau-ni-veiqaravi''' ]''. Fusing maritime navigational skills with canoe engineering infrastructures would have made a formidable combination but taken years and years to grow and master the skills develop and integrate capabilities to form a culture of maritime engineering industry. A major maritime operations based on fleet voyages into the sunrise and occupy islands would have taken years to plan. Hence the stories of '''''Naulumatua, Mai Vunibua''''' (son of '''''Ro-ko- Moutu''''') voyages throughout Vanua Levu and '''''Waqanawanawa''''' (son of '''''Daunisai''''') would have been made possible from a hegemony based on Viti Levu developed over many many years..  \n\n'''<u>Movement Eastward</u>''' - Laucala history has been closely associated with that of  ''Vuna'' ( traditional rivals) and ''Wainikeli's'' common 'theme in ''Waqanawanawa'' voyages\"; has been told in versions of folklore (from Vuna, Wainikeli, Laucala and Lakeba) with minor differences- that Waqanawanawa originated from Vuna, a centre of power (possibly due to the links to Moturiki's ''Ratu'') and slowly influenced Eastward to Lakeba and North to Laucala as well as Yacata.  \n\nFolklore suggests Moturiki was closely linked to  Lovoni (Roko-avono possibly Bui Savulu's nephew and Batitamata's (Laucala) kin?) and Bureta (Bui Savulu sister of Verata's Roko-Moutu, Batiki's Tui Nayavu and Kabara's Daunisai) who originated from the mainland Vitilevu (Verata and Nakauvadra). The period of these migrations and settlement  may have occurred in more than one wave over many years.  \n\n'''<u>Pre-Deed of Cession Laucala</u>'''\n\n[[File:Laucala- boundary before the 1948 redistribution of fisheries boundaries.jpg|alt=Qaraniyaku, Laucala Cakaudrove|thumb|District of Laucala Northern Taviuni Boundary]]\n\nLaucala Island was leased by John Rosa<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/John-Rosa/6000000010316419817|title=John Rosa|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> and later Frederick George  Mitchell (who later settled on Invamay [Niubavu] (name given by claimant Edwin Turpin who was a Land Agent in Levuka ) who eventually sold the lease  to another leasee ---finaly ending with a sale for six shillings to  Mitchell) and Macomber brothers.

We should note that tribal groups movement or travelling through a body of land or even ocean in the past would have been a gargantuan feat. The primitive nature of engineering and developing tools, felling trees, and building canoes such as huge outriggers ( ''Drua'') to travel the immense body of Fiji waters, would have take even a collective group of small  tribes generations to achieve; let alone culturally establishing itself politically into a '''''matanitu vanua''''' unit with different '''''yavusas''''' with distinct capability roles (such as - engineers [ '''''mata-i-sa''u''' ], farmers/cultivators [dautei], combat/protection elements or warriors ''[ '''bati leka and balavu''' ]'', health [ '''''dau/liga ni wa''i''' ], fisherman/maritime [ '''''gone-dau/dausoko''' ]'' and Logistics ''[ '''dau-ni-veiqaravi''' ]''. Fusing maritime navigational skills with canoe engineering infrastructures would have made a formidable combination but taken years and years to grow and master the skills develop and integrate capabilities to form a culture of maritime engineering industry. A major maritime operations based on fleet voyages into the sunrise and occupy islands would have taken years to plan. Hence the stories of '''''Naulumatua, Mai Vunibua''''' (son of '''''Ro-ko- Moutu''''') voyages throughout Vanua Levu and '''''Waqanawanawa''''' (son of '''''Daunisai''''') would have been made possible from a hegemony based on Viti Levu developed over many many years..  \n\n'''Movement Eastward''' - Laucala history has been closely associated with that of  ''Vuna'' ( traditional rivals) and ''Wainikeli's'' common 'theme in ''Waqanawanawa'' voyages\"; has been told in versions of folklore (from Vuna, Wainikeli, Laucala and Lakeba) with minor differences- that Waqanawanawa originated from Vuna, a centre of power (possibly due to the links to Moturiki's ''Ratu'') and slowly influenced Eastward to Lakeba and North to Laucala as well as Yacata.  \n\nFolklore suggests Moturiki was closely linked to  Lovoni (Roko-avono possibly Bui Savulu's nephew and Batitamata's (Laucala) kin?) and Bureta (Bui Savulu sister of Verata's Roko-Moutu, Batiki's Tui Nayavu and Kabara's Daunisai) who originated from the mainland Vitilevu (Verata and Nakauvadra). The period of these migrations and settlement  may have occurred in more than one wave over many years.  \n\n'''Pre-Deed of Cession Laucala'''\n\n[[File:Laucala- boundary before the 1948 redistribution of fisheries boundaries.jpg|alt=Qaraniyaku, Laucala Cakaudrove|thumb|District of Laucala Northern Taviuni Boundary]]\n\nLaucala Island was leased by John Rosa<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/John-Rosa/6000000010316419817|title=John Rosa|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> and later Frederick George  Mitchell (who later settled on Invamay [Niubavu] (name given by claimant Edwin Turpin who was a Land Agent in Levuka ) who eventually sold the lease  to another leasee ---finaly ending with a sale for six shillings to  Mitchell) and Macomber brothers.
