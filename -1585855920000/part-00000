She later sees second-year student council member Touko Nanami turning down a confession herself and becomes convinced that Touko's situation might be similar to her own. Upon speaking to Touko, the two begin to bond over their similarities. To Yuu's surprise, Touko suddenly confesses her feelings to her. Yuu is uncertain how to respond, but Touko brushes this aside, telling Yuu that she would be very happy if Yuu were to not fall in love with her in return. Yuu agrees.\n\nTouko declares that she will be running for the position of student council president and asks Yuu to be her campaign manager. To the dismay of Touko's best friend Sayaka Saeki, Yuu accepts the role. Despite both her and Touko being highly nervous, Yuu gives a powerful campaign speech on election day and simultaneously announces her decision to join the student council, resulting in Touko winning the election.\n\nAs president, Touko announces her intention to revive the student council play, which has not been performed in seven years. When the student council looks for someone to write a script for the play, Yuu considers that her friend Koyomi Kanou could write it, but does not mention this, wanting Touko to forget about doing the play. However, Sayaka tells Yuu to solicit Koyomi to write the script, and to look into the student council president of seven years ago. Yuu subsequently learns that Touko's older sister Mio was the student council president seven years ago and had been producing a play when she was killed in a traffic accident before its premiere. Yuu realizes that Touko wishes to produce the play in her sister's stead and tries to convince Touko that this is unnecessary, but Touko coldly refuses.\n\nThe play's production continues and Koyomi finishes the first draft. The narrative follows an amnesiac girl who must choose which person's view of her is her true self, with the original ending involving the girl choosing to be with her lover. When the student council holds a study camp to practice for the play, professional actor Tomoyuki Ichigaya, a former classmate of Mio's, is brought in to help with the rehearsals. Touko asks him about her sister and learns that Mio was a very different person than who she is now, leaving her conflicted. Concerned, Yuu has Koyomi change the ending to have the protagonist choose to be herself instead of conforming to a specific person's view, believing that this will help Touko come to terms with herself. When the play is performed at the cultural festival, its narrative and Touko's performance are acclaimed by the audience, and the manager of a local theater troupe approaches Touko, asking her to join them and become an actress. She initially declines, but eventually reconsiders and accepts.\n\nTouko thanks Yuu again for her support and reiterates her wish for Yuu to stay with her as she is. However, Yuu has slowly begun to reconsider how she feels towards Touko and abruptly confesses her love. She misinterprets Touko's shocked response as rejection and runs away, causing Touko to realize that she has been overly imposing towards Yuu. Meanwhile, Sayaka speaks with caf\u00e9 owner Miyako Kodama, with whom she confides her own romantic feelings for Touko. When the second-years take a class trip to Kyoto, Sayaka formally confesses to Touko. Touko is somewhat surprised but eventually turns Sayaka down, acknowledging her love for Yuu. Although dejected, Sayaka accepts this. Elsewhere, Yuu realizes that she is running away from her problems. Upon Touko's return, the two reconcile, and Yuu openly reciprocates Touko's feelings for the first time.\n\nOver time, Yuu and Touko meet up at various places together and gradually become more emotionally and physically intimate with each other. This culminates when they go bowling together, with the agreement that whoever wins gets to request something from the other. Yuu wins and asks to sleep over at Touko's house. Touko agrees, confessing she had wanted to arrange that as well. On the day, Yuu arrives at Touko's apartment, where they spend the evening together. To Touko's surprise, Yuu comes on to her, and they have sex.\n\nSome years later, Yuu and Touko are a couple, and have graduated high school and enrolled in college. They reunite with the former student council members to attend the cultural festival at their old high school. As Yuu and Touko reminisce about how their relationship started and reflect on their new lives as adults, they walk off into the night.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Yuu Koito|\u5c0f\u7cf8 \u4f91|Koito Y\u016b}}\n: Voiced by: [[Hisako Kanemoto]]<ref name=\"\u96fb\u6483\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3 2018\">{{Cite news|url=http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/001/242/1242897/|title=\u91d1\u5143\u5bff\u5b50\u3055\u3093\u3001\u5bff\u7f8e\u83dc\u5b50\u3055\u3093\u304c\u58f0\u3092\u62c5\u5f53\uff01 \u8a71\u984c\u306e\u30de\u30f3\u30ac\u300e\u3084\u304c\u3066\u541b\u306b\u306a\u308b\u300f\u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30ebPV\u304c\u516c\u958b|last=\u96fb\u6483\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3|work=\u96fb\u6483\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3|access-date=2018-04-14|language=ja-JP|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414234051/http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/001/242/1242897/|archive-date=2018-04-14|url-status=live}}</ref> (manga PV), [[Y\u016bki Takada]] (anime)<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-06-26/bloom-into-you-tv-anime-casts-yuki-takada-minako-kotobuki/.133413|title=Bloom Into You TV Anime Casts Y\u016bki Takada, Minako Kotobuki|date=June 26, 2018|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=June 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180630122011/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-06-26/bloom-into-you-tv-anime-casts-yuki-takada-minako-kotobuki/.133413|archive-date=June 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> (Japanese); [[Tia Ballard]] (English)<ref name=\"Dub\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hidive.com/news/2018/10/26/bloom-into-you-official-dubcast-edition-cast-list|title=Bloom Into You Official Dubcast Edition cast list|date=October 26, 2018|publisher=[[Hidive]]|access-date=October 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027061547/https://www.hidive.com/news/2018/10/26/bloom-into-you-official-dubcast-edition-cast-list|archive-date=October 27, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:Yuu is a first-year high school girl at Toomi Higashi High School who has trouble experiencing feelings of love.

She later sees second-year student council member Touko Nanami turning down a confession herself and becomes convinced that Touko\u2019s situation might be similar to her own. Upon speaking to Touko, the two begin to bond over their similarities. To Yuu\u2019s surprise, Touko suddenly confesses her feelings to her. Yuu is uncertain how to respond, but Touko brushes this aside, telling Yuu that she would be very happy if Yuu were to not fall in love with her in return. Yuu agrees.\n\nTouko declares that she will be running for the position of student council president and asks Yuu to be her campaign manager. To the dismay of Touko\u2019s best friend Sayaka Saeki, Yuu accepts the role. Despite both her and Touko being highly nervous, Yuu gives a powerful campaign speech on election day and simultaneously announces her decision to join the student council, resulting in Touko winning the election.\n\nAs president, Touko announces her intention to revive the student council play, which has not been performed in seven years. When the student council looks for someone to write a script for the play, Yuu considers that her friend Koyomi Kanou could write it, but does not mention this, wanting Touko to forget about doing the play. However, Sayaka tells Yuu to solicit Koyomi to write the script, and to look into the student council president of seven years ago. Yuu subsequently learns that Touko\u2019s older sister Mio was the student council president seven years ago and had been producing a play when she was killed in a traffic accident before its premiere. Yuu realizes that Touko wishes to produce the play in her sister\u2019s stead and tries to convince Touko that this is unnecessary, but Touko coldly refuses.\n\nThe play\u2019s production continues and Koyomi finishes the first draft. The narrative follows an amnesiac girl who must choose which person\u2019s view of her is her true self, with the original ending involving the girl choosing to be with her lover. When the student council holds a study camp to practice for the play, professional actor Tomoyuki Ichigaya, a former classmate of Mio\u2019s, is brought in to help with the rehearsals. Touko asks him about her sister and learns that Mio was a very different person than who she is now, leaving her conflicted. Concerned, Yuu has Koyomi change the ending to have the protagonist choose to be herself instead of conforming to a specific person\u2019s view, believing that this will help Touko come to terms with herself. When the play is performed at the cultural festival, its narrative and Touko\u2019s performance are acclaimed by the audience, and the manager of a local theater troupe approaches Touko, asking her to join them and become an actress. She initially declines, but eventually reconsiders and accepts.\n\nTouko thanks Yuu again for her support and reiterates her wish for Yuu to stay with her as she is. However, Yuu has slowly begun to reconsider how she feels towards Touko and abruptly confesses her love. She misinterprets Touko\u2019s shocked response as rejection and runs away, causing Touko to realize that she has been overly imposing towards Yuu. Meanwhile, Sayaka speaks with caf\u00e9 owner Miyako Kodama, with whom she confides her own romantic feelings for Touko. When the second-years take a class trip to Kyoto, Sayaka formally confesses to Touko. Touko is somewhat surprised but eventually turns Sayaka down, acknowledging her love for Yuu. Although dejected, Sayaka accepts this. Elsewhere, Yuu realizes that she is running away from her problems. Upon Touko\u2019s return, the two reconcile, and Yuu openly reciprocates Touko\u2019s feelings for the first time.\n\nOver time, Yuu and Touko meet up at various places together and gradually become more emotionally and physically intimate with each other. This culminates when they go bowling together, with the agreement that whoever wins gets to request something from the other. Yuu wins and asks to sleep over at Touko\u2019s house. Touko agrees, confessing she had wanted to arrange that as well. On the day, Yuu arrives at Touko\u2019s apartment, where they spend the evening together. To Touko\u2019s surprise, Yuu comes on to her, and they have sex.\n\nSome years later, Yuu and Touko are a couple, and have graduated high school and enrolled in college. They reunite with the former student council members to attend the cultural festival at their old high school. As Yuu and Touko reminisce about how their relationship started and reflect on their new lives as adults, they walk off into the night.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Yuu Koito|\u5c0f\u7cf8 \u4f91|Koito Y\u016b}}\n: Voiced by: [[Hisako Kanemoto]]<ref name=\"\u96fb\u6483\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3 2018\">{{Cite news|url=http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/001/242/1242897/|title=\u91d1\u5143\u5bff\u5b50\u3055\u3093\u3001\u5bff\u7f8e\u83dc\u5b50\u3055\u3093\u304c\u58f0\u3092\u62c5\u5f53\uff01 \u8a71\u984c\u306e\u30de\u30f3\u30ac\u300e\u3084\u304c\u3066\u541b\u306b\u306a\u308b\u300f\u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30ebPV\u304c\u516c\u958b|last=\u96fb\u6483\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3|work=\u96fb\u6483\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3|access-date=2018-04-14|language=ja-JP|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414234051/http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/001/242/1242897/|archive-date=2018-04-14|url-status=live}}</ref> (manga PV), [[Y\u016bki Takada]] (anime)<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-06-26/bloom-into-you-tv-anime-casts-yuki-takada-minako-kotobuki/.133413|title=Bloom Into You TV Anime Casts Y\u016bki Takada, Minako Kotobuki|date=June 26, 2018|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=June 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180630122011/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-06-26/bloom-into-you-tv-anime-casts-yuki-takada-minako-kotobuki/.133413|archive-date=June 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> (Japanese); [[Tia Ballard]] (English)<ref name=\"Dub\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hidive.com/news/2018/10/26/bloom-into-you-official-dubcast-edition-cast-list|title=Bloom Into You Official Dubcast Edition cast list|date=October 26, 2018|publisher=[[Hidive]]|access-date=October 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027061547/https://www.hidive.com/news/2018/10/26/bloom-into-you-official-dubcast-edition-cast-list|archive-date=October 27, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:Yuu is a first-year high school girl at Toomi Higashi High School who has trouble experiencing feelings of love.

It was made into a manga illustrated by [[Hotaru Odagiri]], which has been licensed in the [[United States]] by [[Digital Manga Publishing]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the school that Wataru Fujii goes to, when one wears matching rings on their right middle finger it is a sign of friendship, a ring on the right ring finger means single, and to wear matching rings on the left ring finger means a couple. One day Wataru accidentally switches rings with the very kind, handsome, popular senior, Yuichi Kazuki, because for some strange twist, their rings match. For reasons that Wataru doesn't understand, Yuichi becomes uncharacteristically mean to Wataru. After this strange incident, Wataru and Kazuki happened to meet more often, starting an electric relationship around the matching rings. Wataru starts to wonder why Yuichi's mood towards him switches to sweet-teasing to evil: is it because he just can't stand him or is it because he actually loves him?\n\nThis meeting of two students that everything seems to oppose, will led to the birth of an unexpected secret that only the ring finger knows.\n\n==Characters==\n===In Manga and Novel===\n;Wataru Fujii: The typical impulsive, brash high school student, with normal teenage problems. His life is turned upside down, however, after a fateful encounter with senior, Yuichi Kazuki who he finds wears a ring identical to his.\n\n;Yuichi Kazuki: A popular upperclassman, with a reputation of being a gentleman. He always gives a girl a proper let down. Generally seen as a kind person, his cutting remarks bewilder Wataru, whom he treats with contempt.\n\n;Karin Fujii: Wataru's younger sister. They look so much alike that people often mistake them as twins. She goes to an all-girls school and through strange circumstances, people think she and Yuichi have a relationship.\n\n;Kawamura: Wataru's classmate and class friend.  He has a crush on Mai Tachibana, the hottest girl in their class and is slightly resentful of Yuichi for \"stealing\" her away.\n\n;Touko: Yuichi's older cousin. Toko runs a jewelry shop, Parfait, and was the person who made Yuichi's ring. She enjoys going places with Yuichi to \"show him off\".\n\n;Mai Tachibana: The hottest girl in the class. She has a big crush on Yuichi and rejected Kawamura because of it.\n\n;Takako Kazuki: Yuichi's little niece who comes to visit him on his birthday. She has a dog. She gets \"engaged\" to Wataru accidentally.\n\n===Only In Novel===\n;Miho Ookusa: Pretty, popular first-year student who finds Wataru's ring and seems to show an interest in him. She is used to having guys notice her good looks and attempts to use her charm on Wataru, however he remains unaffected. To get his ring back, she tells Wataru that he must become friends with her, so they spend a large amount of time together and rumors about the two spread. It is later revealed that she stole Wataru's ring in the first place to cause him trouble because she had secretly been in love with Kazuki and had found out about their relationship. Kazuki later says, however, that although she might have once loved him she now liked Wataru.\n\n;Masanobu Asaka: He is Kazuki's rival and senior in college. He is very similar to Kazuki, in that both stand out for their looks and have similar mannerisms. Kazuki becomes jealous whenever he sees Asaka talking to Wataru and does not like Asaka. Wataru is oblivious to Asaka's feelings. Later on in the novel he falls deeply in love with Wataru resulting in making passes at Wataru when Yuichi isn't around. He has a brother who literally worships him. He also used to have a girlfriend by the name of Yuina but she died in a car accident. It mentions in the novel that Masnobu was deeply in love with but in the end they broke up. His broken ended up being broken by Wataru in the 4th novel of the series when he forcefully kissed Wataru which ends with Wataru saying that could not see each other anymore. In the end he ends up going to New York.\n\n;Shohei: Kazuki's older brother who doesn't approve of Wataru and Kazuki's relationship.\n\n==Media==\n''Only the Ring Finger Knows'' first began as a series of novels, and was later adapted into a manga.\n\n===Novels===\nIn conjunction with Digital Manga Publishing, five paperback novels are planned to be released based on the series:\n#''Only the Ring Finger Knows: The Lonely Ring Finger'': Released March 2006\n#''Only the Ring Finger Knows: The Left Hand Dreams of Him'': Released July 2006\n#''Only the Ring Finger Knows: The Ring Finger Falls Silent'': Released October 2006\n#''Only the Ring Finger Knows: The Ring Will Confess His Love'': Released June 10, 2009\n#''Only the Ring Finger Knows: The Finger Never Sleeps'': Released August 29, 2012\nThe Japanese version of volume 5 was published on September 27, 2008, which is the final volume. \nThe English version was released on August 29, 2012. <ref>http://www.junemanga.com/books/911/</ref>\n\n===Manga===\nThe manga version written by [[Satoru Kannagi]] and illustrated by [[Hotaru Odagiri]] only contains one volume and was published by [[Tokuma Shoten]] in Japan.

It was produced by [[Nihon Ad Systems|NAS]] and [[Konami|Konami Digital Entertainment]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe Imperial Seal has been passed down through the generations of guardians since ancient times. It confers great power unto those it chooses. This is the story of its guardians.\n\nIt is a time of war, when great armies clash in terrible battles and great heroes carve their names in history. It is also a time of death and destruction, when the people of the land live in constant fear of the sword. Onto this stage steps the reluctant Rikuson Hakugen ([[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]]), whose family had been the guardians of the Imperial Seal up until it was stolen by Hakufu Sonsaku, the ruler of the kingdom of Go.

loosely based on the Chinese historical fiction novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]''. It was produced by [[Nihon Ad Systems|NAS]] and [[Konami|Konami Digital Entertainment]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe Imperial Seal has been passed down through the generations of guardians since ancient times. It confers great power unto those it chooses. This is the story of its guardians.\n\nIt is a time of war, when great armies clash in terrible battles and great heroes carve their names in history. It is also a time of death and destruction, when the people of the land live in constant fear of the sword. Onto this stage steps the reluctant Rikuson Hakugen ([[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]]), whose family had been the guardians of the Imperial Seal up until it was stolen by Hakufu Sonsaku, the ruler of the kingdom of Go.

It will premiere in February 21, 2020.\n\n''Sekai-ichi Hatsukoi'' is an spin-off of ''[[Junjo Romantica]]'', another series by the same author.\n\n== Plot ==\nRitsu Onodera, a literary editor, resigns from his father's publishing company, due to his coworkers' jealousy toward his success, claiming that he is simply riding his father's coattails. He applies for a position at Marukawa Publishing in order to move away from his father's shadow, but instead of his preferred department of literature, he is placed in the infamous [[sh\u014djo manga]] department, Emerald. He initially considers resigning, especially because he finds his new boss, Masamune Takano, intolerable and unnerving from the very beginning; however, Takano inadvertently convinces Onodera to stick with the job by calling him \"useless,\" his pride forcing him to stay in order to prove his worth. Later, Onodera learns that Takano's old family name was Saga, and that he was an older schoolmate from high school that Onodera fell in love with and confessed to. It turns out Takano still has feelings for Onodera, and he tells him he will make him fall in love with him again. The series shows how Takano slowly achieves this goal, and the obstacles the two face.\n\nThere are also two other couples in this show; their stories are shown in later episodes. The characters follow Onodera's fellow editors: Hatori and his longtime friend (and manga artist he's in charge of) Yoshino, as well as Kisa and the attractive bookstore employee he has his eye on, Yukina.\n\nAn extra novel follows salesman and longtime friend of Takano's, Yokozawa, as he's swept off his feet following a harsh breakup by attractive widower and single father Kirishima.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n;{{nihongo|Ritsu Onodera|\u5c0f\u91ce\u5bfa \u5f8b|Onodera Ritsu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Takashi Kond\u014d]]}}\n:Ritsu Onodera is a 25-year-old jaded literary editor. He is the only son of the head of Onodera Publications, previously working at his father's company in the literature department. Hearing his fellow co-workers accusing him of only getting ahead due to his father's influence, he decides to show that he can be successful on his own by going to work at Marukawa Publishing. After being hurt by his first love in high school when he was 15, Onodera vowed to never fall in love again. His resolve is tested, however, when he is reunited with the boy he once loved, Masamune Takano. With Takano now very much a man and his new boss, things become very complicated for Onodera as he must juggle his career and his feelings for his first love.\n:Before transferring to Marukawa Publishing, Onodera was an editor in charge Ryouichi Sumi, father of Misaki's friend Keiichi Sumi (also from ''Junjou Romantica'').\n\n;{{nihongo|Masamune Takano|\u9ad8\u91ce \u653f\u5b97|Takano Masamune}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Katsuyuki Konishi]]}}\n:The 27-year-old Masamune Takano, formerly known as Masamune Saga before his parents' divorce and his mother's remarriage, is the [[editor-in-chief]] of the ''Emerald'' department at Marukawa Publishing, where he is sometimes referred to as \"the Capable.\" He and Onodera were once in a brief relationship in high school, but split up over a misunderstanding. It is later revealed that, during college, Takano went through a breakdown from his breakup with Onodera, family problems, and other personal issues, which in turn left him with unresolved feelings for Onodera. When both he and Onodera realize who each other are, he promises Onodera that he will make him fall in love with him again, much to Onodera's contempt.\n:In ''Sekai-ichi Hatsukoi: Takano Masamune no Baai'' (lit. \"Masamune Takano's Case\"), the reader sees Takano's perspective on his and Onodera's first meeting and romantic development.\n\n;{{nihongo|An Kohinata|\u5c0f\u65e5\u5411 \u674f|Kohinata An}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yukari Tamura]]}}\n:An Kohinata is Onodera's childhood friend and his fianc\u00e9e, due to an agreement their parents made when the two were kids; however, Onodera does not view her as his fianc\u00e9e. Sweet, polite and sensitive, An has deep feelings for him, despite being rejected by Onodera (whom she calls \"Ricchan\") when she confessed her love.\n\n;{{nihongo|Arata Haitani|\u7070\u8c37 \u65b0|Haitani Arata}}\n:Haitani is Takano's former co-worker at his previous job. He wishes to take revenge on Takano's for \"stealing\" his ex-lover. He seems to develop feelings for Ritsu, though it is unknown where it's genuine or not. He is later revealed to be bisexual.\n\n;{{nihongo|Chiaki Yoshino|\u5409\u91ce \u5343\u79cb|Yoshino Chiaki}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shinnosuke Tachibana]]}}\n:Chiaki Yoshino is a 28-year-old sh\u014djo manga artist known under the [[pseudonym]] Chiharu Yoshikawa (a female name). His editor in-charge is Hatori Yoshiyuki, who is also his childhood friend. His two best friends are Hatori and Yuu Yanase, but the lines between friendship and love begin to blur after a number of confusing incidents. Yoshino begins to question his feelings for Hatori after witnessing him and Yanase together in what he thinks is a kiss; then Hatori kisses him one night and confesses his feelings. Yoshino begins to realize he has to confront his true feelings or risk losing them both.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yoshiyuki Hatori|\u7fbd\u9ce5 \u82b3\u96ea|Yoshiyuki Hatori}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Yuichi Nakamura]]}}\n:Hatori, also known as Tori, is 28 years old and an editor in Marukawa's ''Emerald'' department. Although in the beginning he is seen as serious and reserved, it is later revealed that he has secretly harbored deep feelings for his childhood friend, Yoshino. After confessing his love, Hatori pulls away fearing that Yoshino doesn't feel the same, who he believes loves his rival, Yanase, instead. However, unbeknownst to Hatori, Yoshino does somewhat return those same feelings.<ref>[http://www.kadokawa.co.jp/lnovel/bk_detail.php?pcd=200708000161 Yoshino Chiaki no Baai volume 1]</ref>\n\n;{{nihongo|Yuu Yanase|\u67f3\u702c \u512a|Yanase Y\u016b}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroshi Kamiya]]}}\n:Chief assistant for manga artist Chiaki Yoshino, Yuu Yanase came to know both Hatori and Yoshino when they were in junior high school. An immediate tension is visible between Hatori and Yuu, though it isn't until later that it is discovered that both are vying for the love of Yoshino.\n\n;{{nihongo|Shouta Kisa|\u6728\u4f50 \u7fd4\u592a|Kisa Sh\u014dta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Nobuhiko Okamoto]]}}\n:Kisa is a fellow editor in the ''Emerald'' department and 30 years old, though he is usually mistaken for being much younger due to his looks. He considers himself gay but has never been in a serious relationship; in fact, he doesn't think himself capable of being in one because of his tendency to fall for a guy's good looks without knowing their personality. Because of this, he immediately questions his feelings for Kou and doesn't hold out much hope for a relationship with him. His mentality can be described by his line, \"Love at first sight works well enough in manga, but this is reality.\"\n\n;{{nihongo|Kou Yukina|\u96ea\u540d \u7687|Yukina K\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tomoaki Maeno]]}}\n:Kou Yukina is a 21-year-old clerk in charge of the sh\u014djo manga section at the popular bookstore, Marimo Books. He's been aware of Kisa coming in to watch him, though he initially believed Kisa was just a shy high school student. When he discovers that Kisa is the editor behind all of his favorite works, however, he begins to develop romantic feelings for him, despite considering himself straight prior to their meeting. Throughout their relationship, Kou shows that he is more than willing to fight for Kisa, whom he tries to make understand that what they feel for each other is real and whom he believes to have the capability to fall in love.\n\n;{{nihongo|Takafumi Yokozawa|\u6a2a\u6fa4\u9686\u53f2|Yokozawa Takafumi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kenyu Horiuchi]]}}\n:Yokozawa works in the sales department at Marukawa. He is a close friend of Takano's, with whom he had a physical relationship when they were both in college. It is common knowledge in the publishing world that Yokozawa helped Takano get into publishing and his position at Marukawa. He is seriously jealous of and resents Onodera, whom he blames for \"screwing up\" Takano ten years ago. He often warns Onodera away from Takano, even going as far as proclaiming Takano is his.\n:He has his own side story entitled ''Takafumi Yokozawa No Baai'' about his new love interest, Kirishima Zen, as he handles his rejection by Takano.\n\n;{{nihongo|Zen Kirishima|\u6850\u5d8b\u7985|Kirishima Zen}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[T\u014dru Furuya]]}}\n:Zen Kirishima was first introduced in ''[[Junjou Romantica]]'' as the editor-in-chief of ''Japun'', the sh\u014dnen manga magazine; here, he is now the new love interest for Yokozawa. He is raising his daughter, Hiyori, on his own due to his wife's passing a few years ago. After blackmailing Yokozawa, the two begin dating upon realizing their feelings for one another. He has a habit of teasing Yokozawa, calling him the \"mother\" of his daughter Hiyori.\n\n;{{nihongo|Hiyori Kirishima|\u6850\u5d8b\u65e5\u548c|Kirishima Hiyori}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yui Horie]]}}\n:Hiyori is the 10-year-old daughter and only child of Zen Kirishima and his wife, the latter of whom died some time ago.

It has been hinted that he has a dark side, with Takano stating, \"Make sure you don't make Mino upset.\"\n\n;{{nihongo|Ry\u016bichir\u014d Isaka|\u4e95\u5742 \u9f8d\u4e00\u90ce|Isaka Ry\u016bichir\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Toshiyuki Morikawa]]}}\n:Isaka is the president of Marukawa Publishing and he is acquainted with Onodera's parents. He also appears as a character in ''[[Junjou Romantica]]''. In \"Junjou Mistake,\" the reader learns he has been in a relationship with his secretary/childhood playmate Asahina for the past ten years after both acknowledged their mutual feelings. He once aspired to be a novelist, but realized his real talents lay in finding future best-sellers. Like Onodera, others once implied that Isaka's success only came from his family's influence (when in reality it was his talent in nurturing authors to greatness), so he feels a kinship with Onodera, which annoys Onodera who wants to get away from that image.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kaoru Asahina|\u671d\u6bd4\u5948 \u85ab|Asahina Kaoru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ry\u014dtar\u014d Okiayu]]}}\n:Asahina is Ry\u016bichiro's assistant, who came to work for the Isaka family when they helped the Asahina family out of a bad situation.

He gets even more down after belittling himself career-wise by comparing his achievements to Takano's. After work, Kisa subconsciously arrives at the bookstore, where Yukina shows him the display stand and tells him that the reason he worked so hard on the display was because of Kisa. Noticing that Kisa has been trying to avoid him, Yukina invites him to talk after he finishes work. As Kisa waits for Yukina outside the store, he encounters the persistent ex-lover yet again. The ex-lover finds out about Kisa's feelings for Yukina and threatens to expose him but was defeated by Yukina, who appeared suddenly and claimed himself to be Kisa's boyfriend. Kisa and Yukina end up in Yukina's house, where Yukina finds out that Kisa was in charge of editing all his favorite manga. He then surprises Kisa by telling him how he knows about Kisa's feelings for him from the start, but when he begins to talk about the kiss Kisa immediately interrupts him by saying that he does not care, which makes Yukina confess to Kisa. Afterwards, Kisa receives notice that his book is getting a second printing, and when Yukina tells him that he loves him after Kisa notified Yukina of the news, Kisa decides that he has fallen in love despite the fact that he claims he can only like men's faces.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 10\n| Title           = Absence makes the heart grow fonder.\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2011|6|11}}<ref name=\"WN-June\">{{cite web | url = http://anime.webnt.jp/programs/view/47 | script-title=ja:\u4e16\u754c\u4e00\u521d\u604b | publisher = Web Newtype | language = Japanese | accessdate = June 10, 2011 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5zLEQzHDk | archivedate = June 10, 2011}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = After working through the night to finish work, Yoshino and Yuu stays behind together.

It will premiere in February 21, 2020.\n\n''Sekai-ichi Hatsukoi'' is an spin-off of ''[[Junjo Romantica]]'', another series by the same author.\n\n== Plot ==\nRitsu Onodera, a literary editor, resigns from his father's publishing company, due to his coworkers' jealousy toward his success, claiming that he is simply riding his father's coattails. He applies for a position at Marukawa Publishing in order to move away from his father's shadow, but instead of his preferred department of literature, he is placed in the infamous [[sh\u014djo manga]] department, Emerald. He initially considers resigning, especially because he finds his new boss, Masamune Takano, intolerable and unnerving from the very beginning; however, Takano inadvertently convinces Onodera to stick with the job by calling him \"useless,\" his pride forcing him to stay in order to prove his worth. Later, Onodera learns that Takano's old family name was Saga, and that he was an older schoolmate from high school that Onodera fell in love with and confessed to. It turns out Takano still has feelings for Onodera, and he tells him he will make him fall in love with him again. The series shows how Takano slowly achieves this goal, and the obstacles the two face.\n\nThere are also two other couples in this show; their stories are shown in later episodes. The characters follow Onodera's fellow editors: Hatori and his longtime friend (and manga artist he's in charge of) Yoshino, as well as Kisa and the attractive bookstore employee he has his eye on, Yukina.\n\nAn extra novel follows salesman and longtime friend of Takano's, Yokozawa, as he\u2019s swept off his feet following a harsh breakup by attractive widower and single father Kirishima.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n;{{nihongo|Ritsu Onodera|\u5c0f\u91ce\u5bfa \u5f8b|Onodera Ritsu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Takashi Kond\u014d]]}}\n:Ritsu Onodera is a 25-year-old jaded literary editor. He is the only son of the head of Onodera Publications, previously working at his father's company in the literature department. Hearing his fellow co-workers accusing him of only getting ahead due to his father's influence, he decides to show that he can be successful on his own by going to work at Marukawa Publishing. After being hurt by his first love in high school when he was 15, Onodera vowed to never fall in love again. His resolve is tested, however, when he is reunited with the boy he once loved, Masamune Takano. With Takano now very much a man and his new boss, things become very complicated for Onodera as he must juggle his career and his feelings for his first love.\n:Before transferring to Marukawa Publishing, Onodera was an editor in charge Ryouichi Sumi, father of Misaki's friend Keiichi Sumi (also from ''Junjou Romantica'').\n\n;{{nihongo|Masamune Takano|\u9ad8\u91ce \u653f\u5b97|Takano Masamune}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Katsuyuki Konishi]]}}\n:The 27-year-old Masamune Takano, formerly known as Masamune Saga before his parents' divorce and his mother's remarriage, is the [[editor-in-chief]] of the ''Emerald'' department at Marukawa Publishing, where he is sometimes referred to as \"the Capable.\" He and Onodera were once in a brief relationship in high school, but split up over a misunderstanding. It is later revealed that, during college, Takano went through a breakdown from his breakup with Onodera, family problems, and other personal issues, which in turn left him with unresolved feelings for Onodera. When both he and Onodera realize who each other are, he promises Onodera that he will make him fall in love with him again, much to Onodera's contempt.\n:In ''Sekai-ichi Hatsukoi: Takano Masamune no Baai'' (lit. \"Masamune Takano's Case\"), the reader sees Takano's perspective on his and Onodera's first meeting and romantic development.\n\n;{{nihongo|An Kohinata|\u5c0f\u65e5\u5411 \u674f|Kohinata An}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yukari Tamura]]}}\n:An Kohinata is Onodera's childhood friend and his fianc\u00e9e, due to an agreement their parents made when the two were kids; however, Onodera does not view her as his fianc\u00e9e. Sweet, polite and sensitive, An has deep feelings for him, despite being rejected by Onodera (whom she calls \"Ricchan\") when she confessed her love.\n\n;{{nihongo|Arata Haitani|\u7070\u8c37 \u65b0|Haitani Arata}}\n:Haitani is Takano's former co-worker at his previous job. He wishes to take revenge on Takano's for \"stealing\" his ex-lover. He seems to develop feelings for Ritsu, though it is unknown where it's genuine or not. He is later revealed to be bisexual.\n\n;{{nihongo|Chiaki Yoshino|\u5409\u91ce \u5343\u79cb|Yoshino Chiaki}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shinnosuke Tachibana]]}}\n:Chiaki Yoshino is a 28-year-old sh\u014djo manga artist known under the [[pseudonym]] Chiharu Yoshikawa (a female name). His editor in-charge is Hatori Yoshiyuki, who is also his childhood friend. His two best friends are Hatori and Yuu Yanase, but the lines between friendship and love begin to blur after a number of confusing incidents. Yoshino begins to question his feelings for Hatori after witnessing him and Yanase together in what he thinks is a kiss; then Hatori kisses him one night and confesses his feelings. Yoshino begins to realize he has to confront his true feelings or risk losing them both.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yoshiyuki Hatori|\u7fbd\u9ce5 \u82b3\u96ea|Yoshiyuki Hatori}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Yuichi Nakamura]]}}\n:Hatori, also known as Tori, is 28 years old and an editor in Marukawa's ''Emerald'' department. Although in the beginning he is seen as serious and reserved, it is later revealed that he has secretly harbored deep feelings for his childhood friend, Yoshino. After confessing his love, Hatori pulls away fearing that Yoshino doesn't feel the same, who he believes loves his rival, Yanase, instead. However, unbeknownst to Hatori, Yoshino does somewhat return those same feelings.<ref>[http://www.kadokawa.co.jp/lnovel/bk_detail.php?pcd=200708000161 Yoshino Chiaki no Baai volume 1]</ref>\n\n;{{nihongo|Yuu Yanase|\u67f3\u702c \u512a|Yanase Y\u016b}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroshi Kamiya]]}}\n:Chief assistant for manga artist Chiaki Yoshino, Yuu Yanase came to know both Hatori and Yoshino when they were in junior high school.

He considers himself gay but has never been in a serious relationship; in fact, he doesn't think himself capable of being in one because of his tendency to fall for a guy's good looks without knowing their personality. Because of this, he immediately questions his feelings for Kou and doesn't hold out much hope for a relationship with him. His mentality can be described by his line, \"Love at first sight works well enough in manga, but this is reality.\"\n\n;{{nihongo|Kou Yukina|\u96ea\u540d \u7687|Yukina K\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tomoaki Maeno]]}}\n:Kou Yukina is a 21-year-old clerk in charge of the sh\u014djo manga section at the popular bookstore, Marimo Books. He's been aware of Kisa coming in to watch him, though he initially believed Kisa was just a shy high school student. When he discovers that Kisa is the editor behind all of his favorite works, however, he begins to develop romantic feelings for him, despite considering himself straight prior to their meeting. Throughout their relationship, Kou shows that he is more than willing to fight for Kisa, whom he tries to make understand that what they feel for each other is real and whom he believes to have the capability to fall in love.\n\n;{{nihongo|Takafumi Yokozawa|\u6a2a\u6fa4\u9686\u53f2|Yokozawa Takafumi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kenyu Horiuchi]]}}\n:Yokozawa works in the sales department at Marukawa. He is a close friend of Takano's, with whom he had a physical relationship when they were both in college. It is common knowledge in the publishing world that Yokozawa helped Takano get into publishing and his position at Marukawa. He is seriously jealous of and resents Onodera, whom he blames for \"screwing up\" Takano ten years ago. He often warns Onodera away from Takano, even going as far as proclaiming Takano is his.\n:He has his own side story entitled ''Takafumi Yokozawa No Baai'' about his new love interest, Kirishima Zen, as he handles his rejection by Takano.\n\n;{{nihongo|Zen Kirishima|\u6850\u5d8b\u7985|Kirishima Zen}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[T\u014dru Furuya]]}}\n:Zen Kirishima was first introduced in ''[[Junjou Romantica]]'' as the editor-in-chief of ''Japun'', the sh\u014dnen manga magazine; here, he is now the new love interest for Yokozawa. He is raising his daughter, Hiyori, on his own due to his wife's passing a few years ago. After blackmailing Yokozawa, the two begin dating upon realizing their feelings for one another. He has a habit of teasing Yokozawa, calling him the \"mother\" of his daughter Hiyori.\n\n;{{nihongo|Hiyori Kirishima|\u6850\u5d8b\u65e5\u548c|Kirishima Hiyori}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yui Horie]]}}\n:Hiyori is the 10-year-old daughter and only child of Zen Kirishima and his wife, the latter of whom died some time ago.

It has been hinted that he has a dark side, with Takano stating, \"Make sure you don't make Mino upset.\"\n\n;{{nihongo|Ry\u016bichir\u014d Isaka|\u4e95\u5742 \u9f8d\u4e00\u90ce|Isaka Ry\u016bichir\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Toshiyuki Morikawa]]}}\n:Isaka is the president of Marukawa Publishing and he is acquainted with Onodera's parents. He also appears as a character in ''[[Junjou Romantica]]''. In \"Junjou Mistake,\" the reader learns he has been in a relationship with his secretary/childhood playmate Asahina for the past ten years after both acknowledged their mutual feelings. He once aspired to be a novelist, but realized his real talents lay in finding future best-sellers. Like Onodera, others once implied that Isaka's success only came from his family's influence (when in reality it was his talent in nurturing authors to greatness), so he feels a kinship with Onodera, which annoys Onodera who wants to get away from that image.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kaoru Asahina|\u671d\u6bd4\u5948 \u85ab|Asahina Kaoru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ry\u014dtar\u014d Okiayu]]}}\n:Asahina is Ry\u016bichiro's assistant, who came to work for the Isaka family when they helped the Asahina family out of a bad situation.

The two have a heartfelt moment where Takano calls Onodera by his first name and Onodera calls him \"senpai.\"  The next morning, Onodera awakens to find himself naked in Takano\u2019s bed, unable to remember the events of the previous night, but pain in his hips and back leads him to realize that he and Takano might have done it.  Despite this obvious evidence, he openly denies this taking place.

Yoshino encourages Yuu to go out with his assistant as she has a crush on him, prompting a frustrated Yuu for the first time to confess to Yoshino. Yoshino tells him that he likes him as well, but Hatori (who came to drop off a manuscript) hears it and leaves the apartment angrily. After Hatori leaves, Yoshino explains that he only meant that he liked Yuu as he was an important friend to him and not in a romantic way, but Yuu asks him to think about it. Yoshino calls Hatori to his house as he wanted to clear up the misunderstandings. When Hatori comes, he tells Yoshino that he knows Yoshino wants to end their relationship.
