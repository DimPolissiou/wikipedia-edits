Social comparison bias happens in everyday society regularly.  Social comparison bias can be defined as having feelings of dislike and competitiveness with someone that is seen as physically or mentally better than yourself.{{Sfn|Garcia|Song|Tesser|2010|pp=97\u2013101}}  This can be compared to [[Social comparison theory|social comparison]], which is believed to be central to achievement motivation, feelings of [[injustice]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[jealousy]] and people's willingness to remain in relationships or jobs.<ref>Buunk & Gibbons 1997</ref><ref>Suls & Wheeler 2000</ref>  People often compete to get the best grades, the best jobs and the best houses.  In many situations, social comparison bias is fairly self-explanatory.  For example, one might make a comparison between the low-end department stores they frequent and the designer stores of their peers, such comparisons may elicit feelings of [[resentment]], [[anger]] and [[envy]] with that peer.  This social comparison bias involves [[wealth]] and [[social status]].  Some of us make social comparisons,{{Who|date=June 2012}}<!-- 1/6 of the world population is hungry! --> but are largely unaware of them.{{Sfn|Smith|Leach|2004|pp=297\u2013308}}  In most cases, we try to compare ourselves to those in our [[peer group]] or with whom we are similar.{{Sfn|Taylor|Lobel|1989|pp=569\u2013575}}\n\n==Research==\nThere are many studies revolving around social comparison and the effects it has on [[mental health]].  One study involved the relationship between depression and [[social comparison]].{{Sfn|Thwaites|Dagnan|2004|pp=309\u2013323}}  Thwaites and Dagnan, in \"Moderating variables in the relationship between social comparison and depression\", investigated the relationship between social comparison and depression utilizing an evolutionary framework.  Their hypothesis was that depression was an outcome from social comparisons that people carried out.  This study investigated the moderating effects on social comparison of the importance of comparison dimensions to the person, and of the perceived importance of the dimensions to other people.  What the researchers used to measure the depression in their participants was a [[self-esteem]] test called the Self Attributes Questionnaire created by Pelham and Swann in 1989.  The test consisted of 10-point [[Likert scale]] ratings on 10 individual social comparison dimensions (e.g. [[intelligence]], [[social skills]], [[Humour|sense of humor]]).  \"Questions were added to explore beliefs regarding the importance of social comparison dimensions.  Data were collected from a combined clinical sample and non-clinical sample of 174 people.\"{{Sfn|Thwaites|Dagnan|2004|pp=309\u2013323}}  They concluded that social comparison did have a relationship with depression based on the data that they collected.  More people that contributed in social comparisons had a higher level of depression than people that rarely used social comparison. It has been shown that there are two forms of comparison as it pertains to social comparison. There is upward comparison which relates to when we compare ourselves to others who seem better off or are better than us. In downward comparison, we tend to compare ourselves to those who are less than us. Whatever the case may be, this creates a competitive attitude from oneself. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://positivepsychology.com/social-comparison/|title=Social Comparison: An Unavoidable Upward Or Downward Spiral|date=2016-04-30|website=PositivePsychology.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==Cognitive effects==\nOne major symptom that can occur with social comparison bias is the mental disorder of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].  Depression is typically diagnosed during a clinical encounter using the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] volume IV (DSM-IV) criteria.  Symptoms include depressed mood, [[hope]]lessness, and [[Sleep disorder|sleep difficulties]], including both [[hypersomnia]] and [[insomnia]].{{Sfn|Thwaites|Dagnan|2004|pp=309\u2013323}}  Clinical depression can be caused by many factors in a person's life.  Depression is the most common mental illness associated to social comparison bias.{{Sfn|Pyszczynski|Greenberg|1987|pp=122\u2013138}}  Depression has a biological explanation to why people lose hope in life.  It is caused by the brain because of the [[hippocampus]] decreasing in size and the lowering levels of [[serotonin]] that circulates through the brain.{{Sfn|Nolen-Hoeksema|Morrow|1993|pp=561\u2013570}}  Another negative symptom that is associated to social comparison bias is [[suicide ideation]].  \"Suicide ideation can be defined as the constant thoughts about [[suicide]] and suicide attempts.  Suicide is the taking of one's own life.\"{{Sfn|Taylor|Lobel|1989|pp=569\u2013575}}  Suicide ideation can occur due to social comparison bias because people that compare themselves to people that are seen better than themselves get mentally discouraged because they believe they can not perform or look a certain way which causes low self-esteem.  Low self-esteem is one of the main factors in suicide ideation.{{Sfn|Garcia|Song|Tesser|2010|pp=97\u2013101}} Additionally, with social comparison bias, one can experience an increased sense of [[anxiety]]. This can be anxiety due to many things such as their own progress in life. This anxiety can only manifest in the sense of being anxious to log on to social media and see posts, but can then turn into social anxiety when seeing those on social media in person. This could potentially be a trigger. Specifically as it pertains to anxiety and body image, you can be triggered easily when on social media. \"A common problem with social media is the tendency for people to compare themselves to others. Social media is a place where people tend to tailor the image of themselves to only present positive things. When other people present their stories or images of success, achievement, beauty, love or happiness it can trigger feelings of inferiority.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://seasonsmalibu.com/triggers-in-social-media/|title=Triggers in Social Media|date=2017-07-22|website=Seasons In Malibu|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n== Physical/Behavioral Effects ==\nSocial comparison can lead to some partaking in harm acts to cope. This could, but is not limited to drug/substance abuse, self harm, eating disorders, alcoholism, etc... These are all unhealthy ways to cope. One should instead seek help. On ones one, as it pertains to social media comparison, one can take action steps to unfollow individuals/pages that are triggers. On the other hand, it could prove beneficial to follow more inspirational and uplifting accounts. Also taking a break from social media has proven to help. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://seasonsmalibu.com/triggers-in-social-media/|title=Triggers in Social Media|date=2017-07-22|website=Seasons In Malibu|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==In the media==\n[[Mainstream media]] is also a main contributor to social comparisons.{{Sfn|Richins|1991|pp=73\u201381}} Everywhere one goes, advertisements try to portray to the public what [[beauty]] should be. Magazines, commercials and billboards all show what beauty is supposed to look like. When a growing generation of youth and adults see this, they socially compare themselves to the advertisements they see all around them.<ref name=\"Wood 1989\">Wood V. J. 1989.</ref> When they do not look a certain way or weigh a certain amount, society puts them down for it. This can cause low self-esteem and an onset of depression because they do not fit the mold of what beauty is seen to be.{{Sfn|Richins|1991|pp=73\u201381}} People get criticized when they do not look like the models in the magazine or on TV. Socially comparing oneself to the people in the media can have negative effects and cause mental anxiety, stress, negative body image and eating disorders.{{Sfn|Kaplan|Haenlein|2010|pp=59\u201368}} With media being such an important part of our generation, having low self-esteems and negative self-images of ourselves effects society with tragic incidents including suicide and [[self-harm]].  Social comparison to others whether on TV and magazines can cause people to lose confidence in themselves and stress over trying to be perfect and be what society expects them to be.  In an experiment that studied women's body image after comparing themselves to different types of models, body image was significantly more negative after viewing thin media images than after viewing images of either average-size models, or plus-size models.{{Sfn|Kaplan|Haenlein|2010|pp=59\u201368}} [[Mass media|Media]] is one of the leading causes for bad body image among youth and adults because of social comparison.{{Sfn|Menon|Kyung|Agrawal|2008|pp=39\u201352}}\n\n===Through social media===\n[[Social media]] being a main source of news and breaking new stories, people can connect to people from all over the world and learn in new ways.{{Sfn|Kaplan|Haenlein|2010|pp=59\u201368}}  It is easier to see people's private life on a public network.  This being said, social networks such as [[Facebook]] makes viewing someone's daily life as simple as sending a request.  Society is exposed to everyone's lives and people are starting to compare themselves with their friends that they have on Facebook.  It is easy to log in and see someone brag about their success or their new belongings and feel bad about yourself.  In recent studies, researchers have been linking Facebook with depression in this generation of social media.{{Sfn|Kaplan|Haenlein|2010|pp=59\u201368}}  They may start to have low self-esteem by seeing their friends online have more exciting lives and more popularity. This social comparison bias among social network users online can make people start to think of their lives as not as fulfilling as they want to be. They see pictures or statuses about job promotions or new jobs, vacations; new relationships, fun outings or even those that can afford nice things. This can cognitively affect people's [[self-esteem]] and cause depression.{{Sfn|Pappas|2012}} They can start to feel bad about their appearance and their life in general. Social media influences the number of social comparisons people have.{{Sfn|Kendler|Karkowski-Shuman|1997|pp=539\u2013547}} One study found that the more time users spend on Facebook each week, the more likely they are to think that others were happier and having better lives than they themselves.<ref>{{Hui-Tzu Grace Chou and Nicholas Edge. Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking. February 2012, 15(2): 117-121. doi:10.1089/cyber.2011.0324.}}</ref>\n\n==Social comparison bias in the classroom==\nSocial comparisons are also very important in the school system.  Students depending on their grade level are very [[Competition|competitive]] about the grades they receive compared to their peers.  Social comparisons not only influence students' self-concepts but also improve their performance.<ref name=\"M\u00f6oller 2006\">M\u00f6oller 2006</ref>  This social comparison process leads to a lower self-concept when the class level is high and to a higher self-concept when the class level is low.<ref name=\"M\u00f6oller 2006\" />  Therefore, two students with equal performance in a domain may develop different [[self-concept]]s when they belong to different classes with different performance levels.<ref name=\"Wood 1989\" />  Social comparisons are important and valid predictors of students' self-evaluations and achievement behavior.  Students may feel jealousy or [[Competition|competitiveness]] when it comes to grades and getting into better colleges and universities than their peers.  Social comparison can also motivate students to do well because they want to keep along with their peers.\n\n==Conclusion==\n{{POV section|date=June 2016}}\nSocial comparison bias can occur in people's everyday life.  Whether it is on social networking sites, in the media, in society regarding wealth and [[social status]] or in the school system.

Social comparison bias happens in everyday society regularly.  Social comparison bias can be defined as having feelings of dislike and competitiveness with someone that is seen as physically or mentally better than yourself.{{Sfn|Garcia|Song|Tesser|2010|pp=97\u2013101}}  This can be compared to [[Social comparison theory|social comparison]], which is believed to be central to achievement motivation, feelings of [[injustice]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[jealousy]] and people's willingness to remain in relationships or jobs.<ref>Buunk & Gibbons 1997</ref><ref>Suls & Wheeler 2000</ref>  People often compete to get the best grades, the best jobs and the best houses.  In many situations, social comparison bias is fairly self-explanatory.  For example, one might make a comparison between the low-end department stores they frequent and the designer stores of their peers, such comparisons may elicit feelings of [[resentment]], [[anger]] and [[envy]] with that peer.  This social comparison bias involves [[wealth]] and [[social status]].  Some of us make social comparisons,{{Who|date=June 2012}}<!-- 1/6 of the world population is hungry! --> but are largely unaware of them.{{Sfn|Smith|Leach|2004|pp=297\u2013308}}  In most cases, we try to compare ourselves to those in our [[peer group]] or with whom we are similar.{{Sfn|Taylor|Lobel|1989|pp=569\u2013575}}\n\n==Research==\nThere are many studies revolving around social comparison and the effects it has on [[mental health]].  One study involved the relationship between depression and [[social comparison]].{{Sfn|Thwaites|Dagnan|2004|pp=309\u2013323}}  Thwaites and Dagnan, in \"Moderating variables in the relationship between social comparison and depression\", investigated the relationship between social comparison and depression utilizing an evolutionary framework.  Their hypothesis was that depression was an outcome from social comparisons that people carried out.  This study investigated the moderating effects on social comparison of the importance of comparison dimensions to the person, and of the perceived importance of the dimensions to other people.  What the researchers used to measure the depression in their participants was a [[self-esteem]] test called the Self Attributes Questionnaire created by Pelham and Swann in 1989.  The test consisted of 10-point [[Likert scale]] ratings on 10 individual social comparison dimensions (e.g. [[intelligence]], [[social skills]], [[Humour|sense of humor]]).  \"Questions were added to explore beliefs regarding the importance of social comparison dimensions.  Data were collected from a combined clinical sample and non-clinical sample of 174 people.\"{{Sfn|Thwaites|Dagnan|2004|pp=309\u2013323}}  They concluded that social comparison did have a relationship with depression based on the data that they collected.  More people that contributed in social comparisons had a higher level of depression than people that rarely used social comparison. It has been shown that there are two forms of comparison as it pertains to social comparison. There is upward comparison which relates to when we compare ourselves to others who seem better off or are better than us. In downward comparison, we tend to compare ourselves to those who are less than us. Whatever the case may be, this creates a competitive attitude from oneself. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://positivepsychology.com/social-comparison/|title=Social Comparison: An Unavoidable Upward Or Downward Spiral|date=2016-04-30|website=PositivePsychology.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==Cognitive effects==\nOne major symptom that can occur with social comparison bias is the mental disorder of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].  Depression is typically diagnosed during a clinical encounter using the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] volume IV (DSM-IV) criteria.  Symptoms include depressed mood, [[hope]]lessness, and [[Sleep disorder|sleep difficulties]], including both [[hypersomnia]] and [[insomnia]].{{Sfn|Thwaites|Dagnan|2004|pp=309\u2013323}}  Clinical depression can be caused by many factors in a person's life.  Depression is the most common mental illness associated to social comparison bias.{{Sfn|Pyszczynski|Greenberg|1987|pp=122\u2013138}}  Depression has a biological explanation to why people lose hope in life.  It is caused by the brain because of the [[hippocampus]] decreasing in size and the lowering levels of [[serotonin]] that circulates through the brain.{{Sfn|Nolen-Hoeksema|Morrow|1993|pp=561\u2013570}}  Another negative symptom that is associated to social comparison bias is [[suicide ideation]].  \"Suicide ideation can be defined as the constant thoughts about [[suicide]] and suicide attempts.  Suicide is the taking of one's own life.\"{{Sfn|Taylor|Lobel|1989|pp=569\u2013575}}  Suicide ideation can occur due to social comparison bias because people that compare themselves to people that are seen better than themselves get mentally discouraged because they believe they can not perform or look a certain way which causes low self-esteem.  Low self-esteem is one of the main factors in suicide ideation.{{Sfn|Garcia|Song|Tesser|2010|pp=97\u2013101}} Additionally, with social comparison bias, one can experience an increased sense of [[anxiety]]. This can be anxiety due to many things such as their own progress in life. This anxiety can only only manifest in the sense of being anxious to log on to social media and see posts, but can then turn into social anxiety when seeing those on social media in person. This could potentially be a trigger. Specifically as it pertains to anxiety and body image, you can be triggered easily when on social media. \"A common problem with social media is the tendency for people to compare themselves to others. Social media is a place where people tend to tailor the image of themselves to only present positive things. When other people present their stories or images of success, achievement, beauty, love or happiness it can trigger feelings of inferiority.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://seasonsmalibu.com/triggers-in-social-media/|title=Triggers in Social Media|date=2017-07-22|website=Seasons In Malibu|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n== Physical/Behavioral Effects ==\nSocial comparison can lead to some partaking in harm acts to cope. This could, but is not limited to drug/substance abuse, self harm, eating disorders, alcoholism, etc... These are all unhealthy ways to cope. One should instead seek help. On ones one, as it pertains to social media comparison, one can take action steps to unfollow individuals/pages that are triggers. On the other hand, it could prove beneficial to follow more inspirational and uplifting accounts. Also taking a break from social media has proven to help. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://seasonsmalibu.com/triggers-in-social-media/|title=Triggers in Social Media|date=2017-07-22|website=Seasons In Malibu|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==In the media==\n[[Mainstream media]] is also a main contributor to social comparisons.{{Sfn|Richins|1991|pp=73\u201381}} Everywhere one goes, advertisements try to portray to the public what [[beauty]] should be. Magazines, commercials and billboards all show what beauty is supposed to look like. When a growing generation of youth and adults see this, they socially compare themselves to the advertisements they see all around them.<ref name=\"Wood 1989\">Wood V. J. 1989.</ref> When they do not look a certain way or weigh a certain amount, society puts them down for it. This can cause low self-esteem and an onset of depression because they do not fit the mold of what beauty is seen to be.{{Sfn|Richins|1991|pp=73\u201381}} People get criticized when they do not look like the models in the magazine or on TV. Socially comparing oneself to the people in the media can have negative effects and cause mental anxiety, stress, negative body image and eating disorders.{{Sfn|Kaplan|Haenlein|2010|pp=59\u201368}} With media being such an important part of our generation, having low self-esteems and negative self-images of ourselves effects society with tragic incidents including suicide and [[self-harm]].  Social comparison to others whether on TV and magazines can cause people to lose confidence in themselves and stress over trying to be perfect and be what society expects them to be.  In an experiment that studied women's body image after comparing themselves to different types of models, body image was significantly more negative after viewing thin media images than after viewing images of either average-size models, or plus-size models.{{Sfn|Kaplan|Haenlein|2010|pp=59\u201368}} [[Mass media|Media]] is one of the leading causes for bad body image among youth and adults because of social comparison.{{Sfn|Menon|Kyung|Agrawal|2008|pp=39\u201352}}\n\n===Through social media===\n[[Social media]] being a main source of news and breaking new stories, people can connect to people from all over the world and learn in new ways.{{Sfn|Kaplan|Haenlein|2010|pp=59\u201368}}  It is easier to see people's private life on a public network.  This being said, social networks such as [[Facebook]] makes viewing someone's daily life as simple as sending a request.  Society is exposed to everyone's lives and people are starting to compare themselves with their friends that they have on Facebook.  It is easy to log in and see someone brag about their success or their new belongings and feel bad about yourself.  In recent studies, researchers have been linking Facebook with depression in this generation of social media.{{Sfn|Kaplan|Haenlein|2010|pp=59\u201368}}  They may start to have low self-esteem by seeing their friends online have more exciting lives and more popularity. This social comparison bias among social network users online can make people start to think of their lives as not as fulfilling as they want to be. They see pictures or statuses about job promotions or new jobs, vacations; new relationships, fun outings or even those that can afford nice things. This can cognitively affect people's [[self-esteem]] and cause depression.{{Sfn|Pappas|2012}} They can start to feel bad about their appearance and their life in general. Social media influences the number of social comparisons people have.{{Sfn|Kendler|Karkowski-Shuman|1997|pp=539\u2013547}} One study found that the more time users spend on Facebook each week, the more likely they are to think that others were happier and having better lives than they themselves.<ref>{{Hui-Tzu Grace Chou and Nicholas Edge.

Students depending on their grade level are very [[Competition|competitive]] about the grades they receive compared to their peers.  Social comparisons not only influence students' self-concepts but also improve their performance.<ref name=\"M\u00f6oller 2006\">M\u00f6oller 2006</ref>  This social comparison process leads to a lower self-concept when the class level is high and to a higher self-concept when the class level is low.<ref name=\"M\u00f6oller 2006\" />  Therefore, two students with equal performance in a domain may develop different [[self-concept]]s when they belong to different classes with different performance levels.<ref name=\"Wood 1989\" />  Social comparisons are important and valid predictors of students' self-evaluations and achievement behavior.  Students may feel jealousy or [[Competition|competitiveness]] when it comes to grades and getting into better colleges and universities than their peers.  Social comparison can also motivate students to do well because they want to keep along with their peers.\n\n==Conclusion==\n{{POV section|date=June 2016}}\nSocial comparison bias can occur in people's everyday life.  Whether it is on social networking sites, in the media, in society regarding wealth and [[social status]] or in the school system.  It can be negative to one's mental health due to the increasing risks of depression, suicide ideation and other mental disorders.{{Sfn|Kendler|1995|pp=5\u20139}}  Social comparison in this generation is everywhere and society revolves around comparing ourselves to each other if it is to have a higher self-esteem or to try and better themselves as a whole.  With social comparison being so important, it will lead to social comparison bias and cause negative effects in a person's life.  With the research found, the hypothesis was proven correct stating that depression does have a relationship with the social comparison that people in society participate in.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Social comparison theory]]\n* [[List of cognitive biases]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n;Sources\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Cite journal |last1=Burson |first1=A. |last2=Larrick |first2=R |last3=Soll |first3=J. |year=2005 |title=Social Comparison and Confidence: When Thinking You're Better than Average Predicts Overconfidence |journal=Ross School of Business |issue=Paper No. 1016 |hdl=2027.42/41218 |ref=harv}} Published as:<br/>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.10.002|title=Social comparison and confidence: When thinking you're better than average predicts overconfidence (and when it does not)|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=102|issue=1|pages=76\u201394|year=2007|last1=Larrick|first1=Richard P.|last2=Burson|first2=Katherine A.|last3=Soll|first3=Jack B.|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Garcia |first1=S. |last2=Song |first2=H. |last3=Tesser |first3=A. |year=2010 |title=Tainted recommendations: The social comparison bias |journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=97\u2013101 |doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2010.06.002 |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~smgarcia/pubs/Social%20Comparison%20Bias.pdf |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418191234/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~smgarcia/pubs/Social%20Comparison%20Bias.pdf |archivedate=2016-04-18 }}\n*{{Cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Huguet |first1=P. |last2=Dumas |first2=F. |last3=Monteil |first3=J. |last4=Genestoux |first4=N. |year=2001 |title=Social comparison choices in the classroom: further evidence for students' upward comparison tendency and its beneficial impact on performance |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=557\u2013578 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.81}}\n*{{Cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Kaplan |first1=A. |last2=Haenlein |first2=M. |year=2010 |title=Users of the world, unite!

Limitations of these systems drove the need for a more universal navigation solution with greater accuracy.\n\nAlthough there were wide needs for accurate navigation in military and civilian sectors, almost none of those was seen as justification for the billions of dollars it would cost in research, development, deployment, and operation of a constellation of navigation satellites. During the [[Cold War]] [[arms race]], the nuclear threat to the existence of the United States was the one need that did justify this cost in the view of the United States Congress. This deterrent effect is why GPS was funded. It is also the reason for the ultra-secrecy at that time. The [[nuclear triad]] consisted of the United States Navy's [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBMs) along with [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[strategic bomber]]s and [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs). Considered vital to the [[nuclear strategy|nuclear deterrence]] posture, accurate determination of the SLBM launch position was a [[force multiplication|force multiplier]].\n\nPrecise navigation would enable United States [[ballistic missile submarine]]s to get an accurate fix of their positions before they launched their SLBMs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018151253/http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archivedate=October 18, 2007|title=Why Did the Department of Defense Develop GPS?|publisher=Trimble Navigation Ltd|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref> The USAF, with two thirds of the nuclear triad, also had requirements for a more accurate and reliable navigation system. The Navy and Air Force were developing their own technologies in parallel to solve what was essentially the same problem.\n\nTo increase the survivability of ICBMs, there was a proposal to use mobile launch platforms (comparable to the Russian [[RT-23 Molodets|SS-24]] and [[RT-2PM Topol|SS-25]]) and so the need to fix the launch position had similarity to the SLBM situation.\n\nIn 1960, the Air Force proposed a radio-navigation system called MOSAIC (MObile System for Accurate ICBM Control) that was essentially a 3-D&nbsp;[[LORAN]]. A follow-on study, Project&nbsp;57, was worked in 1963 and it was \"in this study that the GPS concept was born.\" That same year, the concept was pursued as Project&nbsp;621B, which had \"many of the attributes that you now see in GPS\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/01.html|title=Charting a Course Toward Global Navigation|publisher=The Aerospace Corporation|accessdate=October 14, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021101215923/http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/01.html|archivedate=November 1, 2002<!--, 01:01:18-->}}</ref> and promised increased accuracy for Air Force bombers as well as ICBMs.\n\nUpdates from the Navy TRANSIT system were too slow for the high speeds of Air Force operation.

This changed with President [[Bill Clinton]] signing on May 1, 2000 a policy directive to turn off Selective Availability to provide the same accuracy to civilians that was afforded to the military. The directive was proposed by the U.S. Secretary of Defense, [[William Perry]], in view of the widespread growth of [[differential GPS]] services by private industry to improve civilian accuracy. Moreover, the U.S. military was actively developing technologies to deny GPS service to potential adversaries on a regional basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngs.woc.noaa.gov/FGCS/info/sans_SA/docs/GPS_SA_Event_QAs.pdf |title=GPS & Selective Availability Q&A |publisher=NOAA] |accessdate=May 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050921115614/http://ngs.woc.noaa.gov/FGCS/info/sans_SA/docs/GPS_SA_Event_QAs.pdf |archivedate=September 21, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nSince its deployment, the U.S. has implemented several improvements to the GPS service, including new signals for civil use and increased accuracy and integrity for all users, all the while maintaining compatibility with existing GPS equipment. Modernization of the satellite system has been an ongoing initiative by the U.S. Department of Defense through a series of [[GPS Block IIIA|satellite acquisitions]] to meet the growing needs of the military, civilians, and the commercial market.\n\nAs of early 2015, high-quality, [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] grade, Standard Positioning Service (SPS) GPS receivers provided horizontal accuracy of better than {{convert|3.5|m|sp=us||}},<ref name=\"GPS Accuracy\">{{cite web|title=GPS Accuracy|url=http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/|website=GPS.gov|publisher=GPS.gov|accessdate=4 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416030006/http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/|archive-date=April 16, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> although many factors such as receiver quality and atmospheric issues can affect this accuracy.\n\nGPS is owned and operated by the United States government as a national resource.

The satellites carry very stable [[atomic clocks]] that are synchronized with one another and with the ground clocks. Any drift from time maintained on the ground is corrected daily. In the same manner, the satellite locations are known with great precision. GPS receivers have clocks as well, but they are less stable and less precise.\n\nEach GPS satellite continuously transmits a radio signal containing the current time and data about its position.  Since the speed of [[radio wave]]s is constant and independent of the satellite speed, the time delay between when the satellite transmits a signal and the receiver receives it is proportional to the distance from the satellite to the receiver.  A GPS receiver monitors multiple satellites and solves equations to determine the precise position of the receiver and its deviation from true time. At a minimum, four satellites must be in view of the receiver for it to compute four unknown quantities (three position coordinates and clock deviation from satellite time).\n\n=== More detailed description ===\nEach GPS satellite continually broadcasts a signal ([[carrier wave]] with [[modulation]]) that includes:\n* A [[Pseudorandom binary sequence|pseudorandom]] code (sequence of ones and zeros) that is known to the receiver. By time-aligning a receiver-generated version and the receiver-measured version of the code, the time of arrival (TOA) of a defined point in the code sequence, called an epoch, can be found in the receiver clock time scale\n* A message that includes the time of transmission (TOT) of the code epoch (in GPS time scale) and the satellite position at that time\n\nConceptually, the receiver measures the TOAs (according to its own clock) of four satellite signals. From the TOAs and the TOTs, the receiver forms four [[time of flight]] (TOF) values, which are (given the speed of light) approximately equivalent to receiver-satellite ranges plus time difference between the receiver and GPS satellites multiplied by speed of light, which are called as pseudo-ranges. The receiver then computes its three-dimensional position and clock deviation from the four TOFs.\n\nIn practice the receiver position (in three dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] with origin at the Earth's center) and the offset of the receiver clock relative to the GPS time are computed simultaneously, using the [[#Navigation equations|navigation equations]] to process the TOFs.\n\nThe receiver's Earth-centered solution location is usually converted to [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and height relative to an ellipsoidal Earth model. The height may then be further converted to height relative to the [[geoid]], which is essentially mean [[sea level]]. These coordinates may be displayed, such as on a [[moving map display]], or recorded or used by some other system, such as a vehicle guidance system.\n\n=== User-satellite geometry ===\nAlthough usually not formed explicitly in the receiver processing, the conceptual time differences of arrival (TDOAs) define the measurement geometry. Each TDOA corresponds to a [[hyperboloid]] of revolution (see [[Multilateration]]). The line connecting the two satellites involved (and its extensions) forms the axis of the hyperboloid. The receiver is located at the point where three hyperboloids intersect.<ref name=\"Abel1\">Abel, J.S. and Chaffee, J.W., \"Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions\", ''IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems'', vol. 26, no. 6, pp. 748\u201353, Sept. 1991.</ref><ref name=\"Fang\">Fang, B.T., \"Comments on \"Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions\" by J.S. Abel and J.W. Chaffee\", ''IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems'', vol. 28, no. 4, Oct. 1992.</ref>\n\nIt is sometimes incorrectly said that the user location is at the intersection of three spheres. While simpler to visualize, this is the case only if the receiver has a clock synchronized with the satellite clocks (i.e., the receiver measures true ranges to the satellites rather than range differences). There are marked performance benefits to the user carrying a clock synchronized with the satellites. Foremost is that only three satellites are needed to compute a position solution. If it were an essential part of the GPS concept that all users needed to carry a synchronized clock, a smaller number of satellites could be deployed, but the cost and complexity of the user equipment would increase.\n\n=== Receiver in continuous operation ===\nThe description above is representative of a receiver start-up situation. Most receivers have a [[track algorithm]], sometimes called a ''tracker'', that combines sets of satellite measurements collected at different times\u2014in effect, taking advantage of the fact that successive receiver positions are usually close to each other. After a set of measurements are processed, the tracker predicts the receiver location corresponding to the next set of satellite measurements. When the new measurements are collected, the receiver uses a weighting scheme to combine the new measurements with the tracker prediction. In general, a tracker can (a) improve receiver position and time accuracy, (b) reject bad measurements, and (c) estimate receiver speed and direction.\n\nThe disadvantage of a tracker is that changes in speed or direction can be computed only with a delay, and that derived direction becomes inaccurate when the distance traveled between two position measurements drops below or near the [[random error]] of position measurement. GPS units can use measurements of the [[Doppler shift]] of the signals received to compute velocity accurately.<ref>{{cite book |title=Global Positioning Systems, Inertial Navigation, and Integration |edition=2nd |first1=Mohinder S. |last1=Grewal |first2=Lawrence R. |last2=Weill |first3=Angus P. |last3=Andrews |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-470-09971-1 |pages=92\u201393 |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=6P7UNphJ1z8C}}}}, {{google books|plainurl=y|id=6P7UNphJ1z8C|page=92 |title=Extract of pages 92\u201393}}</ref> More advanced navigation systems use additional sensors like a [[compass]] or an [[inertial navigation system]] to complement GPS.\n\n=== Non-navigation applications ===\n{{for|a list of applications|#Applications}}\nGPS requires four or more satellites to be visible for accurate navigation. The solution of the [[#Navigation equations|navigation equations]] gives the position of the receiver along with the difference between the time kept by the receiver's on-board clock and the true time-of-day, thereby eliminating the need for a more precise and possibly impractical receiver based clock. Applications for GPS such as [[time transfer]], traffic signal timing, and [[IS-95#Physical layer|synchronization of cell phone base stations]], [[#Timekeeping|make use of]] this cheap and highly accurate timing. Some GPS applications use this time for display, or, other than for the basic position calculations, do not use it at all.\n\nAlthough four satellites are required for normal operation, fewer apply in special cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation. Some GPS receivers may use additional clues or assumptions such as reusing the last known [[altitude]], [[dead reckoning]], [[inertial navigation system|inertial navigation]], or including information from the vehicle computer, to give a (possibly degraded) position when fewer than four satellites are visible.<ref>{{cite web|title=Continuous Navigation Combining GPS with Sensor-Based Dead Reckoning|url=http://www.gpsworld.com/gpsworld/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=154870&pageID=6|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111202317/http://www.gpsworld.com/gpsworld/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=154870&pageID=6|archivedate=November 11, 2006|date=April 1, 2005|author1=Georg zur Bonsen |author2=Daniel Ammann |author3=Michael Ammann |author4=Etienne Favey |author5=Pascal Flammant |publisher=GPS World}}</ref><ref name=\"NAVGPS\">{{cite web|title=NAVSTAR GPS User Equipment Introduction|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf|publisher=United States Government|access-date=August 22, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910184805/http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf|archive-date=September 10, 2008|url-status=live}} Chapter 7</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=GPS Support Notes|url=http://www.navmanwireless.com/uploads/EK/C8/EKC8zb1ITsNwDqWcqLQxiQ/Support_Notes_GPS_OperatingParameters.pdf|date=January 19, 2007|accessdate=November 10, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327051208/http://www.navmanwireless.com/uploads/EK/C8/EKC8zb1ITsNwDqWcqLQxiQ/Support_Notes_GPS_OperatingParameters.pdf|archivedate=March 27, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2015}}\nThe current GPS consists of three major segments.

What is more, the OMA SUPL A-GPS standard has enabled lower cost deployment of A-GPS services that ensure a better and more consistent user experience necessary for the mass consumer market. The SUPL A-GPS standard allows network operators or handset manufacturers to deploy assistance services that reduce the time to first fix, lowers the power consumption, and enhances the sensitivity of the GPS receiver. The SUPL standard uses User Plane communication channels such as SMS and GPRS to transport the aiding data, as opposed to the control plane channels in networks, thereby reducing the load on the networks, as well as complexity and cost of service deployment. New business models have also become possible, ranging from hosted services for operators that want to minimize capital investments, to services deployed by handset vendors for end-users that cannot get similar services from their network operator yet.\n\nThe major handset software platforms and operating systems are evolving, ensuring easier integration of GPS functionality for handset manufacturers and more powerful features for application developers. Along with the improving performance of handsets, in terms of screen size, processing power and memory size, current handsets thus provide much better platforms for location-enabled applications and services than before.\n\nThe GPS value-chain was reshaped considerably in 2007 as several specialist GPS technology developers were acquired by wireless chipset vendors. These transactions are likely to enhance the possibilities to meet handset manufacturers' demand for integrated connectivity solutions that include GPS at ever lower price points to enable true mass market deployment.\n\nSales of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets grew to about 24.5 million units in 2007 according to independent analyst firm Berg Insight. Although the number is very small in comparison with the 150 million GPS-enabled CDMA handsets sold, the number is growing rapidly. Berg Insight estimates that shipments of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets will grow to 370&nbsp;million units in 2012, the equivalent of more than 26 percent of all GSM/WCDMA handsets sold that year. Including CDMA handsets, GPS-enabled handsets sales are estimated to reach about 560&nbsp;million, or 35&nbsp;percent of total handset shipments in 2012.\n\n-->\n\n==== Restrictions on civilian use ====\nThe U.S. government controls the export of some civilian receivers.

The week number is transmitted as a ten-[[bit]] field in the C/A and P(Y) navigation messages, and so it becomes zero again every 1,024&nbsp;weeks (19.6&nbsp;years). GPS week zero started at 00:00:00&nbsp;UTC (00:00:19&nbsp;TAI) on January 6, 1980, and the week number became zero again for the first time at 23:59:47&nbsp;UTC on August 21, 1999 (00:00:19&nbsp;TAI on August 22, 1999). It happened the second time at 23:59:42&nbsp;UTC on April 6, 2019. To determine the current Gregorian date, a GPS receiver must be provided with the approximate date (to within 3,584&nbsp;days) to correctly translate the GPS date signal. To address this concern in the future the modernized GPS civil navigation (CNAV) message will use a 13-bit field that only repeats every 8,192&nbsp;weeks (157&nbsp;years), thus lasting until 2137 (157&nbsp;years after GPS week zero).\n\n== Communication ==\n{{Main|GPS signals}}\n\nThe navigational signals transmitted by GPS satellites encode a variety of information including satellite positions, the state of the internal clocks, and the health of the network. These signals are transmitted on two separate carrier frequencies that are common to all satellites in the network. Two different encodings are used: a public encoding that enables lower resolution navigation, and an encrypted encoding used by the U.S. military.\n\n=== Message format ===\n:{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ {{nowrap|GPS message format}}\n!

Each complete message takes 750 seconds (12 1/2 minutes) to complete. The message structure has a basic format of a 1500-bit-long frame made up of five subframes, each subframe being 300 bits (6 seconds) long. Subframes 4 and 5 are [[commutation (telemetry)|subcommutated]] 25 times each, so that a complete data message requires the transmission of 25 full frames.

Although LightSquared had applied for a license to operate in the 1525 to 1559 band as early as 2003 and it was put out for public comment, the FCC asked LightSquared to form a study group with the GPS community to test GPS receivers and identify issue that might arise due to the larger signal power from the LightSquared terrestrial network. The GPS community had not objected to the LightSquared (formerly MSV and SkyTerra) applications until November 2010, when LightSquared applied for a modification to its Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC) authorization. This filing (SAT-MOD-20101118-00239) amounted to a request to run several orders of magnitude more power in the same frequency band for terrestrial base stations, essentially repurposing what was supposed to be a \"quiet neighborhood\" for signals from space as the equivalent of a cellular network. Testing in the first half of 2011 has demonstrated that the impact of the lower 10&nbsp;MHz of spectrum is minimal to GPS devices (less than 1% of the total GPS devices are affected).

If the almanac information is not in memory, the receiver enters a search mode until a lock is obtained on one of the satellites. To obtain a lock, it is necessary that there be an unobstructed line of sight from the receiver to the satellite. The receiver can then acquire the almanac and determine the satellites it should listen for. As it detects each satellite's signal, it identifies it by its distinct C/A&nbsp;code pattern. There can be a delay of up to 30&nbsp;seconds before the first estimate of position because of the need to read the ephemeris data.\n\nProcessing of the navigation message enables the determination of the time of transmission and the satellite position at this time.

Geometrical interpretations can enhance the understanding of these solution methods.\n\n==== Spheres ====\nThe measured ranges, called pseudoranges, contain clock errors. In a simplified idealization in which the ranges are synchronized, these true ranges represent the radii of spheres, each centered on one of the transmitting satellites. The solution for the position of the receiver is then at the intersection of the surfaces of these spheres. Signals from at minimum three satellites are required, and their three spheres would typically intersect at two points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0203-1-10-instruments/modern.htm|title=Modern navigation|work=math.nus.edu.sg|access-date=December 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226024421/http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0203-1-10-instruments/modern.htm|archive-date=December 26, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> One of the points is the location of the receiver, and the other moves rapidly in successive measurements and would not usually be on Earth's surface.\n\nIn practice, there are many sources of inaccuracy besides clock bias, including random errors as well as the potential for precision loss from subtracting numbers close to each other if the centers of the spheres are relatively close together. This means that the position calculated from three satellites alone is unlikely to be accurate enough. Data from more satellites can help because of the tendency for random errors to cancel out and also by giving a larger spread between the sphere centers. But at the same time, more spheres will not generally intersect at one point. Therefore, a near intersection gets computed, typically via least squares. The more signals available, the better the approximation is likely to be.\n\n==== Hyperboloids ====\nIf the pseudorange between the receiver and satellite ''i'' and the pseudorange between the receiver and satellite ''j'' are subtracted, {{nobreak|1=''p<sub>i</sub>'' \u2212 ''p<sub>j</sub>''}}, the common receiver clock bias (''b'') cancels out, resulting in a difference of distances {{nobreak|1=''d<sub>i</sub>'' \u2212 ''d<sub>j</sub>''}}. The locus of points having a constant difference in distance to two points (here, two satellites) is a [[hyperbola]] on a plane and a [[hyperboloid of revolution]] in 3D space (see [[Multilateration]]). Thus, from four pseudorange measurements, the receiver can be placed at the intersection of the surfaces of three hyperboloids each with [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] at a pair of satellites. With additional satellites, the multiple intersections are not necessarily unique, and a best-fitting solution is sought instead.<ref name=\"Abel1\" /><ref name=\"Fang\" /><ref>{{cite book|author1=Gilbert Strang|author2=Kai Borre|title=Linear Algebra, Geodesy, and GPS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MjNwWUY8jx4C&pg=PA449|year=1997|publisher=SIAM|isbn=978-0-9614088-6-2|pages=448\u2013449}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Audun Holme|title=Geometry: Our Cultural Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXwQGo8jyHUC&pg=PA338|year=2010|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-14441-7|page=338}}</ref><ref name=\"HWLW\">{{cite book|author1=B.

This produces large errors in the computed distances to the satellites. Therefore, in practice, the time difference between the receiver clock and the satellite time is defined as an unknown clock bias ''b''. The equations are then solved simultaneously for the receiver position and the clock bias.  The solution space [''x, y, z, b''] can be seen as a four-dimensional geometric space, and signals from at minimum four satellites are needed.

Error sources include signal arrival time measurements, numerical calculations, atmospheric effects (ionospheric/tropospheric delays), [[ephemeris]] and clock data, multipath signals, and natural and artificial interference. Magnitude of residual errors from these sources depends on geometric dilution of precision. Artificial errors may result from jamming devices and threaten ships and aircraft<ref>Attewill, Fred.

Such augmentation systems are generally named or described based on how the information arrives. Some systems transmit additional error information (such as clock drift, ephemera, or [[ionospheric delay]]), others characterize prior errors, while a third group provides additional navigational or vehicle information.\n\nExamples of augmentation systems include the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS), [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS), [[Differential GPS]] (DGPS), [[inertial navigation system]]s (INS) and [[Assisted GPS]]. The standard accuracy of about {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} can be augmented to {{convert|3|\u2013|5|m|ft|sp=us}} with DGPS, and to about {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} with WAAS.<ref>{{cite book |title=GPS For Dummies |first1=Joel |last1=McNamara |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-470-45785-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hbz4LYIrvuMC&pg=PA59 |page=59 |access-date=May 22, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704164219/http://books.google.com/books?id=Hbz4LYIrvuMC&pg=PA59 |archive-date=July 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Precise monitoring ===\nAccuracy can be improved through precise monitoring and measurement of existing GPS signals in additional or alternative ways.\n\nThe largest remaining error is usually the unpredictable delay through the [[ionosphere]]. The spacecraft broadcast ionospheric model parameters, but some errors remain. This is one reason GPS spacecraft transmit on at least two frequencies, L1 and L2. Ionospheric delay is a well-defined function of frequency and the [[total electron content]] (TEC) along the path, so measuring the arrival time difference between the frequencies determines TEC and thus the precise ionospheric delay at each frequency.\n\nMilitary receivers can decode the P(Y) code transmitted on both L1 and L2. Without decryption keys, it is still possible to use a ''codeless'' technique to compare the P(Y) codes on L1 and L2 to gain much of the same error information. This technique is slow, so it is currently available only on specialized surveying equipment. In the future, additional civilian codes are expected to be transmitted on the L2 and L5&nbsp;frequencies (see [[GPS modernization]]). All users will then be able to perform dual-frequency measurements and directly compute ionospheric delay errors.\n\nA second form of precise monitoring is called ''Carrier-Phase Enhancement'' (CPGPS). This corrects the error that arises because the pulse transition of the [[pseudorandom noise|PRN]] is not instantaneous, and thus the [[cross-correlation|correlation]] (satellite\u2013receiver sequence matching) operation is imperfect. CPGPS uses the L1 carrier wave, which has a [[frequency|period]] of <math> \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1575.42 \\times 10^6} = 0.63475\\,\\mathrm{ns} \\approx 1\\, \\mathrm{ns} \\ </math>, which is about one-thousandth of the C/A&nbsp;Gold code bit period of <math> \\frac{1\\, \\mathrm{s}}{1023 \\times 10^3} = 977.5 \\, \\mathrm{ns}   \\approx 1000 \\, \\mathrm{ns} \\ </math>, to act as an additional [[clock signal]] and resolve the uncertainty. The phase difference error in the normal GPS amounts to {{convert|2|\u2013|3|m|ft|sp=us|sigfig=1}} of ambiguity. CPGPS working to within 1% of perfect transition reduces this error to {{convert|3|cm|in|sp=us}} of ambiguity. By eliminating this error source, CPGPS coupled with DGPS normally realizes between {{convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|0|sp=us}} of absolute accuracy.\n\n''[[Relative Kinematic Positioning]]'' (RKP) is a third alternative for a precise GPS-based positioning system. In this approach, determination of range signal can be resolved to a precision of less than {{convert|10|cm|in|0|sp=us}}. This is done by resolving the number of cycles that the signal is transmitted and received by the receiver by using a combination of differential GPS (DGPS) correction data, transmitting GPS signal phase information and ambiguity resolution techniques via statistical tests\u2014possibly with processing in real-time ([[Real Time Kinematic|real-time kinematic positioning]], RTK).\n\n=== Carrier phase tracking (surveying) ===\n{{main|GNSS enhancement#Carrier-phase tracking (surveying)}}\nAnother method that is used in surveying applications is carrier phase tracking. The period of the carrier frequency multiplied by the speed of light gives the wavelength, which is about {{cvt|0.19|m|||}} for the L1&nbsp;carrier. Accuracy within 1% of wavelength in detecting the leading edge reduces this component of pseudorange error to as little as {{cvt|2|mm|||}}. This compares to {{cvt|3|m||}} for the C/A code and {{cvt|0.3|m|in|1|}} for the P&nbsp;code.\n\n{{convert|2|mm|spell=In|adj=on|sp=us}} accuracy requires measuring the total phase\u2014the number of waves multiplied by the wavelength plus the fractional wavelength, which requires specially equipped receivers. This method has many surveying applications. It is accurate enough for real-time tracking of the very slow motions of [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]], typically {{convert|0|-|100|mm|in|0|abbr=in}} per year.\n\nTriple differencing followed by numerical root finding, and a mathematical technique called [[least squares]] can estimate the position of one receiver given the position of another. First, compute the difference between satellites, then between receivers, and finally between epochs. Other orders of taking differences are equally valid. Detailed discussion of the errors is omitted.\n\nThe satellite carrier total phase can be measured with ambiguity as to the number of cycles. Let <math>\\ \\phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> denote the phase of the carrier of satellite ''j'' measured by receiver ''i'' at time <math>\\ \\ t_k </math>. This notation shows the meaning of the subscripts ''i, j,'' and ''k.'' The receiver (''r''), satellite (''s''), and time (''t'') come in alphabetical order as arguments of <math>\\ \\phi </math> and to balance readability and conciseness, let <math>\\ \\phi_{i,j,k} = \\phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> be a concise abbreviation. Also we define three functions, :<math>\\ \\Delta^r, \\Delta^s, \\Delta^t </math>, which return differences between receivers, satellites, and time points, respectively. Each function has variables with three subscripts as its arguments. These three functions are defined below. If <math>\\  \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math> is a function of the three integer arguments, ''i, j,'' and ''k'' then it is a valid argument for the functions, :<math>\\ \\Delta^r, \\Delta^s, \\Delta^t </math>, with the values defined as\n\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^r(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \\alpha_{i+1,j,k} - \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math>,\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^s(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \\alpha_{i,j+1,k} - \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math>, and\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \\alpha_{i,j,k+1} - \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math>&nbsp;.\n\nAlso if <math>\\  \\alpha_{i,j,k}\\ and\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} </math> are valid arguments for the three functions and ''a'' and ''b'' are constants then\n<math>\\ ( a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} ) </math> is a valid argument with values defined as\n\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^r(a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n}) = a \\ \\Delta^r(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \\ \\Delta^r(\\beta_{l,m,n})</math>,\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^s(a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} )= a \\ \\Delta^s(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \\ \\Delta^s(\\beta_{l,m,n})</math>, and\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} )= a \\ \\Delta^t(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \\ \\Delta^t(\\beta_{l,m,n})</math>&nbsp;.\n\nReceiver clock errors can be approximately eliminated by differencing the phases measured from satellite&nbsp;1 with that from satellite&nbsp;2 at the same epoch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/633.htm |title=Between-Satellite Differencing |publisher=Gmat.unsw.edu.au |accessdate=October 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306051358/http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/633.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> This difference is designated as <math>\\ \\Delta^s(\\phi_{1,1,1}) =  \\phi_{1,2,1} - \\phi_{1,1,1}</math>\n\nDouble differencing<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/635.htm |title=Double differencing |publisher=Gmat.unsw.edu.au |accessdate=October 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306051809/http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/635.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> computes the difference of receiver&nbsp;1's satellite difference from that of receiver&nbsp;2.

This eliminates the ambiguity associated with the integral number of wavelengths in carrier phase provided this ambiguity does not change with time. Thus the triple difference result eliminates practically all clock bias errors and the integer ambiguity. Atmospheric delay and satellite ephemeris errors have been significantly reduced. This triple difference is:\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(\\Delta^r(\\Delta^s(\\phi_{1,1,1}))) </math>\n\nTriple difference results can be used to estimate unknown variables. For example, if the position of receiver&nbsp;1 is known but the position of receiver&nbsp;2 unknown, it may be possible to estimate the position of receiver&nbsp;2 using numerical root finding and least squares. Triple difference results for three independent time pairs may be sufficient to solve for receiver&nbsp;2's three position components. This may require a numerical procedure.<ref name=\"NR1\">chapter on root finding and nonlinear sets of equations</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=William H.

This initial value can probably be provided from the navigation message and the intersection of sphere surfaces. Such a reasonable estimate can be key to successful multidimensional root finding. Iterating from three time pairs and a fairly good initial value produces one observed triple difference result for receiver&nbsp;2's position. Processing additional time pairs can improve accuracy, overdetermining the answer with multiple solutions. Least squares can estimate an overdetermined system. Least squares determines the position of receiver&nbsp;2 that best fits the observed triple difference results for receiver&nbsp;2 positions under the criterion of minimizing the sum of the squares.\n\n== Regulatory spectrum issues concerning GPS receivers ==\nIn the United States, GPS receivers are regulated under the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s (FCC) [[Title 47 CFR Part 15|Part 15]] rules.

On February 14, 2012, the FCC initiated proceedings to vacate LightSquared's Conditional Waiver Order based on the NTIA's conclusion that there was currently no practical way to mitigate potential GPS interference.\n\nGPS receiver manufacturers design GPS receivers to use spectrum beyond the GPS-allocated band. In some cases, GPS receivers are designed to use up to 400&nbsp;MHz of spectrum in either direction of the L1 frequency of 1575.42&nbsp;MHz, because mobile satellite services in those regions are broadcasting from space to ground, and at power levels commensurate with mobile satellite services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/news/javad-ashjaee-discuss-javad-gnss-lightsquared-tech-december-8-webinar-12337 |title=Javad Ashjaee GPS World webinar |date=December 8, 2011 |publisher=gpsworld.com |accessdate=December 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126033508/http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/news/javad-ashjaee-discuss-javad-gnss-lightsquared-tech-december-8-webinar-12337 |archivedate=November 26, 2011 }}</ref> As regulated under the FCC's Part 15 rules, GPS receivers are not warranted protection from signals outside GPS-allocated spectrum.<ref name=\"FCC.gov\" /> This is why GPS operates next to the Mobile Satellite Service band, and also why the Mobile Satellite Service band operates next to GPS. The symbiotic relationship of spectrum allocation ensures that users of both bands are able to operate cooperatively and freely.\n\nThe FCC adopted rules in February 2003 that allowed Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) licensees such as LightSquared to construct a small number of ancillary ground-based towers in their licensed spectrum to \"promote more efficient use of terrestrial wireless spectrum.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-03-15A1.pdf|title=FCC Order permitting mobile satellite services providers to provide an ancillary terrestrial component (ATC) to their satellite systems|work=Federal Communications Commission|publisher=FCC.gov|date=February 10, 2003|accessdate=December 13, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216043720/http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-03-15A1.pdf|archive-date=December 16, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> In those 2003 rules, the FCC stated \"As a preliminary matter, terrestrial [Commercial Mobile Radio Service (\u201cCMRS\u201d)] and MSS ATC are expected to have different prices, coverage, product acceptance and distribution; therefore, the two services appear, at best, to be imperfect substitutes for one another that would be operating in predominantly different market segments... MSS ATC is unlikely to compete directly with terrestrial CMRS for the same customer base...\". In 2004, the FCC clarified that the ground-based towers would be ancillary, noting that \"We will authorize MSS ATC subject to conditions that ensure that the added terrestrial component remains ancillary to the principal MSS offering. We do not intend, nor will we permit, the terrestrial component to become a stand-alone service.\"<ref name=\"hraunfoss.fcc.gov\" /> In July 2010, the FCC stated that it expected LightSquared to use its authority to offer an integrated satellite-terrestrial service to \"provide mobile broadband services similar to those provided by terrestrial mobile providers and enhance competition in the

Limitations of these systems drove the need for a more universal navigation solution with greater accuracy.\n\nAlthough there were wide needs for accurate navigation in military and civilian sectors, almost none of those was seen as justification for the billions of dollars it would cost in research, development, deployment, and operation of a constellation of navigation satellites. During the [[Cold War]] [[arms race]], the nuclear threat to the existence of the United States was the one need that did justify this cost in the view of the United States Congress. This deterrent effect is why GPS was funded. It is also the reason for the ultra-secrecy at that time. The [[nuclear triad]] consisted of the United States Navy's [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBMs) along with [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[strategic bomber]]s and [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs). Considered vital to the [[nuclear strategy|nuclear deterrence]] posture, accurate determination of the SLBM launch position was a [[force multiplication|force multiplier]].\n\nPrecise navigation would enable United States [[ballistic missile submarine]]s to get an accurate fix of their positions before they launched their SLBMs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018151253/http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archivedate=October 18, 2007|title=Why Did the Department of Defense Develop GPS?|publisher=Trimble Navigation Ltd|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref> The USAF, with two thirds of the nuclear triad, also had requirements for a more accurate and reliable navigation system. The Navy and Air Force were developing their own technologies in parallel to solve what was essentially the same problem.\n\nTo increase the survivability of ICBMs, there was a proposal to use mobile launch platforms (comparable to the Russian [[RT-23 Molodets|SS-24]] and [[RT-2PM Topol|SS-25]]) and so the need to fix the launch position had similarity to the SLBM situation.\n\nIn 1960, the Air Force proposed a radio-navigation system called MOSAIC (MObile System for Accurate ICBM Control) that was essentially a 3-D&nbsp;[[LORAN]]. A follow-on study, Project&nbsp;57, was worked in 1963 and it was \"in this study that the GPS concept was born.\" That same year, the concept was pursued as Project&nbsp;621B, which had \"many of the attributes that you now see in GPS\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/01.html|title=Charting a Course Toward Global Navigation|publisher=The Aerospace Corporation|accessdate=October 14, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021101215923/http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/01.html|archivedate=November 1, 2002<!--, 01:01:18-->}}</ref> and promised increased accuracy for Air Force bombers as well as ICBMs.\n\nUpdates from the Navy TRANSIT system were too slow for the high speeds of Air Force operation.

The satellites carry very stable [[atomic clocks]] that are synchronized with one another and with the ground clocks. Any drift from time maintained on the ground is corrected daily. In the same manner, the satellite locations are known with great precision. GPS receivers have clocks as well, but they are less stable and less precise.\n\nEach GPS satellite continuously transmits a radio signal containing the current time and data about its position.  Since the speed of [[radio wave]]s is constant and independent of the satellite speed, the time delay between when the satellite transmits a signal and the receiver receives it is proportional to the distance from the satellite to the receiver.  A GPS receiver monitors multiple satellites and solves equations to determine the precise position of the receiver and its deviation from true time. At a minimum, four satellites must be in view of the receiver for it to compute four unknown quantities (three position coordinates and clock deviation from satellite time).\n\n=== More detailed description ===\nEach GPS satellite continually broadcasts a signal ([[carrier wave]] with [[modulation]]) that includes:\n* A [[Pseudorandom binary sequence|pseudorandom]] code (sequence of ones and zeros) that is known to the receiver. By time-aligning a receiver-generated version and the receiver-measured version of the code, the time of arrival (TOA) of a defined point in the code sequence, called an epoch, can be found in the receiver clock time scale\n* A message that includes the time of transmission (TOT) of the code epoch (in GPS time scale) and the satellite position at that time\n\nConceptually, the receiver measures the TOAs (according to its own clock) of four satellite signals. From the TOAs and the TOTs, the receiver forms four [[time of flight]] (TOF) values, which are (given the speed of light) approximately equivalent to receiver-satellite ranges plus time difference between the receiver and GPS satellites multiplied by speed of light, which are called as pseudo-ranges. The receiver then computes its three-dimensional position and clock deviation from the four TOFs.\n\nIn practice the receiver position (in three dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] with origin at the Earth's center) and the offset of the receiver clock relative to the GPS time are computed simultaneously, using the [[#Navigation equations|navigation equations]] to process the TOFs.\n\nThe receiver's Earth-centered solution location is usually converted to [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and height relative to an ellipsoidal Earth model. The height may then be further converted to height relative to the [[geoid]], which is essentially mean [[sea level]]. These coordinates may be displayed, such as on a [[moving map display]], or recorded or used by some other system, such as a vehicle guidance system.\n\n=== User-satellite geometry ===\nAlthough usually not formed explicitly in the receiver processing, the conceptual time differences of arrival (TDOAs) define the measurement geometry. Each TDOA corresponds to a [[hyperboloid]] of revolution (see [[Multilateration]]). The line connecting the two satellites involved (and its extensions) forms the axis of the hyperboloid. The receiver is located at the point where three hyperboloids intersect.<ref name=\"Abel1\">Abel, J.S. and Chaffee, J.W., \"Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions\", ''IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems'', vol. 26, no. 6, pp. 748\u201353, Sept. 1991.</ref><ref name=\"Fang\">Fang, B.T., \"Comments on \"Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions\" by J.S. Abel and J.W. Chaffee\", ''IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems'', vol. 28, no. 4, Oct. 1992.</ref>\n\nIt is sometimes incorrectly said that the user location is at the intersection of three spheres. While simpler to visualize, this is the case only if the receiver has a clock synchronized with the satellite clocks (i.e., the receiver measures true ranges to the satellites rather than range differences). There are marked performance benefits to the user carrying a clock synchronized with the satellites. Foremost is that only three satellites are needed to compute a position solution. If it were an essential part of the GPS concept that all users needed to carry a synchronized clock, a smaller number of satellites could be deployed, but the cost and complexity of the user equipment would increase.\n\n=== Receiver in continuous operation ===\nThe description above is representative of a receiver start-up situation. Most receivers have a [[track algorithm]], sometimes called a ''tracker'', that combines sets of satellite measurements collected at different times\u2014in effect, taking advantage of the fact that successive receiver positions are usually close to each other. After a set of measurements are processed, the tracker predicts the receiver location corresponding to the next set of satellite measurements. When the new measurements are collected, the receiver uses a weighting scheme to combine the new measurements with the tracker prediction. In general, a tracker can (a) improve receiver position and time accuracy, (b) reject bad measurements, and (c) estimate receiver speed and direction.\n\nThe disadvantage of a tracker is that changes in speed or direction can be computed only with a delay, and that derived direction becomes inaccurate when the distance traveled between two position measurements drops below or near the [[random error]] of position measurement. GPS units can use measurements of the [[Doppler shift]] of the signals received to compute velocity accurately.<ref>{{cite book |title=Global Positioning Systems, Inertial Navigation, and Integration |edition=2nd |first1=Mohinder S. |last1=Grewal |first2=Lawrence R. |last2=Weill |first3=Angus P. |last3=Andrews |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-470-09971-1 |pages=92\u201393 |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=6P7UNphJ1z8C}}}}, {{google books|plainurl=y|id=6P7UNphJ1z8C|page=92 |title=Extract of pages 92\u201393}}</ref> More advanced navigation systems use additional sensors like a [[compass]] or an [[inertial navigation system]] to complement GPS.\n\n=== Non-navigation applications ===\n{{for|a list of applications|#Applications}}\nGPS requires four or more satellites to be visible for accurate navigation. The solution of the [[#Navigation equations|navigation equations]] gives the position of the receiver along with the difference between the time kept by the receiver's on-board clock and the true time-of-day, thereby eliminating the need for a more precise and possibly impractical receiver based clock. Applications for GPS such as [[time transfer]], traffic signal timing, and [[IS-95#Physical layer|synchronization of cell phone base stations]], [[#Timekeeping|make use of]] this cheap and highly accurate timing. Some GPS applications use this time for display, or, other than for the basic position calculations, do not use it at all.\n\nAlthough four satellites are required for normal operation, fewer apply in special cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation. Some GPS receivers may use additional clues or assumptions such as reusing the last known [[altitude]], [[dead reckoning]], [[inertial navigation system|inertial navigation]], or including information from the vehicle computer, to give a (possibly degraded) position when fewer than four satellites are visible.<ref>{{cite web|title=Continuous Navigation Combining GPS with Sensor-Based Dead Reckoning|url=http://www.gpsworld.com/gpsworld/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=154870&pageID=6|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111202317/http://www.gpsworld.com/gpsworld/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=154870&pageID=6|archivedate=November 11, 2006|date=April 1, 2005|author1=Georg zur Bonsen |author2=Daniel Ammann |author3=Michael Ammann |author4=Etienne Favey |author5=Pascal Flammant |publisher=GPS World}}</ref><ref name=\"NAVGPS\">{{cite web|title=NAVSTAR GPS User Equipment Introduction|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf|publisher=United States Government|access-date=August 22, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910184805/http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf|archive-date=September 10, 2008|url-status=live}} Chapter 7</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=GPS Support Notes|url=http://www.navmanwireless.com/uploads/EK/C8/EKC8zb1ITsNwDqWcqLQxiQ/Support_Notes_GPS_OperatingParameters.pdf|date=January 19, 2007|accessdate=November 10, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327051208/http://www.navmanwireless.com/uploads/EK/C8/EKC8zb1ITsNwDqWcqLQxiQ/Support_Notes_GPS_OperatingParameters.pdf|archivedate=March 27, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2015}}\nThe current GPS consists of three major segments.

What is more, the OMA SUPL A-GPS standard has enabled lower cost deployment of A-GPS services that ensure a better and more consistent user experience necessary for the mass consumer market. The SUPL A-GPS standard allows network operators or handset manufacturers to deploy assistance services that reduce the time to first fix, lowers the power consumption, and enhances the sensitivity of the GPS receiver. The SUPL standard uses User Plane communication channels such as SMS and GPRS to transport the aiding data, as opposed to the control plane channels in networks, thereby reducing the load on the networks, as well as complexity and cost of service deployment. New business models have also become possible, ranging from hosted services for operators that want to minimize capital investments, to services deployed by handset vendors for end-users that cannot get similar services from their network operator yet.\n\nThe major handset software platforms and operating systems are evolving, ensuring easier integration of GPS functionality for handset manufacturers and more powerful features for application developers. Along with the improving performance of handsets, in terms of screen size, processing power and memory size, current handsets thus provide much better platforms for location-enabled applications and services than before.\n\nThe GPS value-chain was reshaped considerably in 2007 as several specialist GPS technology developers were acquired by wireless chipset vendors. These transactions are likely to enhance the possibilities to meet handset manufacturers' demand for integrated connectivity solutions that include GPS at ever lower price points to enable true mass market deployment.\n\nSales of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets grew to about 24.5 million units in 2007 according to independent analyst firm Berg Insight. Although the number is very small in comparison with the 150 million GPS-enabled CDMA handsets sold, the number is growing rapidly. Berg Insight estimates that shipments of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets will grow to 370&nbsp;million units in 2012, the equivalent of more than 26 percent of all GSM/WCDMA handsets sold that year. Including CDMA handsets, GPS-enabled handsets sales are estimated to reach about 560&nbsp;million, or 35&nbsp;percent of total handset shipments in 2012.\n\n-->\n\n==== Restrictions on civilian use ====\nThe U.S. government controls the export of some civilian receivers.

The week number is transmitted as a ten-[[bit]] field in the C/A and P(Y) navigation messages, and so it becomes zero again every 1,024&nbsp;weeks (19.6&nbsp;years). GPS week zero started at 00:00:00&nbsp;UTC (00:00:19&nbsp;TAI) on January 6, 1980, and the week number became zero again for the first time at 23:59:47&nbsp;UTC on August 21, 1999 (00:00:19&nbsp;TAI on August 22, 1999). It happened the second time at 23:59:42&nbsp;UTC on April 6, 2019. To determine the current Gregorian date, a GPS receiver must be provided with the approximate date (to within 3,584&nbsp;days) to correctly translate the GPS date signal. To address this concern in the future the modernized GPS civil navigation (CNAV) message will use a 13-bit field that only repeats every 8,192&nbsp;weeks (157&nbsp;years), thus lasting until 2137 (157&nbsp;years after GPS week zero).\n\n== Communication ==\n{{Main|GPS signals}}\n\nThe navigational signals transmitted by GPS satellites encode a variety of information including satellite positions, the state of the internal clocks, and the health of the network. These signals are transmitted on two separate carrier frequencies that are common to all satellites in the network. Two different encodings are used: a public encoding that enables lower resolution navigation, and an encrypted encoding used by the U.S. military.\n\n=== Message format ===\n:{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ {{nowrap|GPS message format}}\n!

Each complete message takes 750 seconds (12 1/2 minutes) to complete. The message structure has a basic format of a 1500-bit-long frame made up of five subframes, each subframe being 300 bits (6 seconds) long. Subframes 4 and 5 are [[commutation (telemetry)|subcommutated]] 25 times each, so that a complete data message requires the transmission of 25 full frames. Each subframe consists of ten words, each 30 bits long. Thus, with 300 bits in a subframe times 5 subframes in a frame times 25 frames in a message, each message is 37,500 bits long. At a transmission rate of 50-bit/s, this gives 750 seconds to transmit an entire [[GPS signals#Almanac|almanac message (GPS)]].

Although LightSquared had applied for a license to operate in the 1525 to 1559 band as early as 2003 and it was put out for public comment, the FCC asked LightSquared to form a study group with the GPS community to test GPS receivers and identify issue that might arise due to the larger signal power from the LightSquared terrestrial network. The GPS community had not objected to the LightSquared (formerly MSV and SkyTerra) applications until November 2010, when LightSquared applied for a modification to its Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC) authorization. This filing (SAT-MOD-20101118-00239) amounted to a request to run several orders of magnitude more power in the same frequency band for terrestrial base stations, essentially repurposing what was supposed to be a \"quiet neighborhood\" for signals from space as the equivalent of a cellular network. Testing in the first half of 2011 has demonstrated that the impact of the lower 10&nbsp;MHz of spectrum is minimal to GPS devices (less than 1% of the total GPS devices are affected). The upper 10&nbsp;MHz intended for use by LightSquared may have some impact on GPS devices.

If the almanac information is not in memory, the receiver enters a search mode until a lock is obtained on one of the satellites. To obtain a lock, it is necessary that there be an unobstructed line of sight from the receiver to the satellite. The receiver can then acquire the almanac and determine the satellites it should listen for. As it detects each satellite's signal, it identifies it by its distinct C/A&nbsp;code pattern. There can be a delay of up to 30&nbsp;seconds before the first estimate of position because of the need to read the ephemeris data.\n\nProcessing of the navigation message enables the determination of the time of transmission and the satellite position at this time.

Receivers usually calculate a running estimate of the error in the calculated position. This is done by multiplying the basic resolution of the receiver by quantities called the [[Dilution of precision (navigation)|geometric dilution of position]] (GDOP) factors, calculated from the relative sky directions of the satellites used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html#Gdop|title=Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) and Visibility|first=Peter H.|last=Dana|publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder|accessdate=July 7, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050823013233/http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html#Gdop|archive-date=August 23, 2005|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The receiver location is expressed in a specific coordinate system, such as latitude and longitude using the [[WGS 84]] [[datum (geodesy)|geodetic datum]] or a country-specific system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html#PosVelTime|title=Receiver Position, Velocity, and Time|author=Peter H.

Geometrical interpretations can enhance the understanding of these solution methods.\n\n==== Spheres ====\nThe measured ranges, called pseudoranges, contain clock errors. In a simplified idealization in which the ranges are synchronized, these true ranges represent the radii of spheres, each centered on one of the transmitting satellites. The solution for the position of the receiver is then at the intersection of the surfaces of these spheres. Signals from at minimum three satellites are required, and their three spheres would typically intersect at two points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0203-1-10-instruments/modern.htm|title=Modern navigation|work=math.nus.edu.sg|access-date=December 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226024421/http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0203-1-10-instruments/modern.htm|archive-date=December 26, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> One of the points is the location of the receiver, and the other moves rapidly in successive measurements and would not usually be on Earth's surface.\n\nIn practice, there are many sources of inaccuracy besides clock bias, including random errors as well as the potential for precision loss from subtracting numbers close to each other if the centers of the spheres are relatively close together. This means that the position calculated from three satellites alone is unlikely to be accurate enough. Data from more satellites can help because of the tendency for random errors to cancel out and also by giving a larger spread between the sphere centers. But at the same time, more spheres will not generally intersect at one point. Therefore, a near intersection gets computed, typically via least squares. The more signals available, the better the approximation is likely to be.\n\n==== Hyperboloids ====\nIf the pseudorange between the receiver and satellite ''i'' and the pseudorange between the receiver and satellite ''j'' are subtracted, {{nobreak|1=''p<sub>i</sub>'' \u2212 ''p<sub>j</sub>''}}, the common receiver clock bias (''b'') cancels out, resulting in a difference of distances {{nobreak|1=''d<sub>i</sub>'' \u2212 ''d<sub>j</sub>''}}. The locus of points having a constant difference in distance to two points (here, two satellites) is a [[hyperbola]] on a plane and a [[hyperboloid of revolution]] in 3D space (see [[Multilateration]]). Thus, from four pseudorange measurements, the receiver can be placed at the intersection of the surfaces of three hyperboloids each with [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] at a pair of satellites. With additional satellites, the multiple intersections are not necessarily unique, and a best-fitting solution is sought instead.<ref name=\"Abel1\" /><ref name=\"Fang\" /><ref>{{cite book|author1=Gilbert Strang|author2=Kai Borre|title=Linear Algebra, Geodesy, and GPS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MjNwWUY8jx4C&pg=PA449|year=1997|publisher=SIAM|isbn=978-0-9614088-6-2|pages=448\u2013449}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Audun Holme|title=Geometry: Our Cultural Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXwQGo8jyHUC&pg=PA338|year=2010|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-14441-7|page=338}}</ref><ref name=\"HWLW\">{{cite book|author1=B.

This produces large errors in the computed distances to the satellites. Therefore, in practice, the time difference between the receiver clock and the satellite time is defined as an unknown clock bias ''b''. The equations are then solved simultaneously for the receiver position and the clock bias.  The solution space [''x, y, z, b''] can be seen as a four-dimensional geometric space, and signals from at minimum four satellites are needed. In that case each of the equations describes a [[spherical cone]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=GPS Solutions: Closed Forms, Critical and Special Configurations of P4P | doi=10.1007/PL00012897 | volume=5|issue=3 |journal=GPS Solutions|pages=29\u201341 | last1 = Grafarend | first1 = Erik W.|year=2002 }}</ref> with the cusp located at the satellite, and the base a sphere around the satellite.

The standard accuracy of about {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} can be augmented to {{convert|3|\u2013|5|m|ft|sp=us}} with DGPS, and to about {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} with WAAS.<ref>{{cite book |title=GPS For Dummies |first1=Joel |last1=McNamara |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-470-45785-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hbz4LYIrvuMC&pg=PA59 |page=59 |access-date=May 22, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704164219/http://books.google.com/books?id=Hbz4LYIrvuMC&pg=PA59 |archive-date=July 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Precise monitoring ===\nAccuracy can be improved through precise monitoring and measurement of existing GPS signals in additional or alternative ways.\n\nThe largest remaining error is usually the unpredictable delay through the [[ionosphere]]. The spacecraft broadcast ionospheric model parameters, but some errors remain. This is one reason GPS spacecraft transmit on at least two frequencies, L1 and L2. Ionospheric delay is a well-defined function of frequency and the [[total electron content]] (TEC) along the path, so measuring the arrival time difference between the frequencies determines TEC and thus the precise ionospheric delay at each frequency.\n\nMilitary receivers can decode the P(Y) code transmitted on both L1 and L2. Without decryption keys, it is still possible to use a ''codeless'' technique to compare the P(Y) codes on L1 and L2 to gain much of the same error information. This technique is slow, so it is currently available only on specialized surveying equipment. In the future, additional civilian codes are expected to be transmitted on the L2 and L5&nbsp;frequencies (see [[GPS modernization]]). All users will then be able to perform dual-frequency measurements and directly compute ionospheric delay errors.\n\nA second form of precise monitoring is called ''Carrier-Phase Enhancement'' (CPGPS). This corrects the error that arises because the pulse transition of the [[pseudorandom noise|PRN]] is not instantaneous, and thus the [[cross-correlation|correlation]] (satellite\u2013receiver sequence matching) operation is imperfect. CPGPS uses the L1 carrier wave, which has a [[frequency|period]] of <math> \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1575.42 \\times 10^6} = 0.63475\\,\\mathrm{ns} \\approx 1\\, \\mathrm{ns} \\ </math>, which is about one-thousandth of the C/A&nbsp;Gold code bit period of <math> \\frac{1\\, \\mathrm{s}}{1023 \\times 10^3} = 977.5 \\, \\mathrm{ns}   \\approx 1000 \\, \\mathrm{ns} \\ </math>, to act as an additional [[clock signal]] and resolve the uncertainty. The phase difference error in the normal GPS amounts to {{convert|2|\u2013|3|m|ft|sp=us|sigfig=1}} of ambiguity. CPGPS working to within 1% of perfect transition reduces this error to {{convert|3|cm|in|sp=us}} of ambiguity. By eliminating this error source, CPGPS coupled with DGPS normally realizes between {{convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|0|sp=us}} of absolute accuracy.\n\n''[[Relative Kinematic Positioning]]'' (RKP) is a third alternative for a precise GPS-based positioning system. In this approach, determination of range signal can be resolved to a precision of less than {{convert|10|cm|in|0|sp=us}}. This is done by resolving the number of cycles that the signal is transmitted and received by the receiver by using a combination of differential GPS (DGPS) correction data, transmitting GPS signal phase information and ambiguity resolution techniques via statistical tests\u2014possibly with processing in real-time ([[Real Time Kinematic|real-time kinematic positioning]], RTK).\n\n=== Carrier phase tracking (surveying) ===\n{{main|GNSS enhancement#Carrier-phase tracking (surveying)}}\nAnother method that is used in surveying applications is carrier phase tracking. The period of the carrier frequency multiplied by the speed of light gives the wavelength, which is about {{cvt|0.19|m|||}} for the L1&nbsp;carrier. Accuracy within 1% of wavelength in detecting the leading edge reduces this component of pseudorange error to as little as {{cvt|2|mm|||}}. This compares to {{cvt|3|m||}} for the C/A code and {{cvt|0.3|m|in|1|}} for the P&nbsp;code.\n\n{{convert|2|mm|spell=In|adj=on|sp=us}} accuracy requires measuring the total phase\u2014the number of waves multiplied by the wavelength plus the fractional wavelength, which requires specially equipped receivers. This method has many surveying applications. It is accurate enough for real-time tracking of the very slow motions of [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]], typically {{convert|0|-|100|mm|in|0|abbr=in}} per year.\n\nTriple differencing followed by numerical root finding, and a mathematical technique called [[least squares]] can estimate the position of one receiver given the position of another. First, compute the difference between satellites, then between receivers, and finally between epochs. Other orders of taking differences are equally valid. Detailed discussion of the errors is omitted.\n\nThe satellite carrier total phase can be measured with ambiguity as to the number of cycles. Let <math>\\ \\phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> denote the phase of the carrier of satellite ''j'' measured by receiver ''i'' at time <math>\\ \\ t_k </math>. This notation shows the meaning of the subscripts ''i, j,'' and ''k.'' The receiver (''r''), satellite (''s''), and time (''t'') come in alphabetical order as arguments of <math>\\ \\phi </math> and to balance readability and conciseness, let <math>\\ \\phi_{i,j,k} = \\phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> be a concise abbreviation. Also we define three functions, :<math>\\ \\Delta^r, \\Delta^s, \\Delta^t </math>, which return differences between receivers, satellites, and time points, respectively. Each function has variables with three subscripts as its arguments. These three functions are defined below. If <math>\\  \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math> is a function of the three integer arguments, ''i, j,'' and ''k'' then it is a valid argument for the functions, :<math>\\ \\Delta^r, \\Delta^s, \\Delta^t </math>, with the values defined as\n\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^r(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \\alpha_{i+1,j,k} - \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math>,\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^s(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \\alpha_{i,j+1,k} - \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math>, and\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \\alpha_{i,j,k+1} - \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math>&nbsp;.\n\nAlso if <math>\\  \\alpha_{i,j,k}\\ and\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} </math> are valid arguments for the three functions and ''a'' and ''b'' are constants then\n<math>\\ ( a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} ) </math> is a valid argument with values defined as\n\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^r(a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n}) = a \\ \\Delta^r(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \\ \\Delta^r(\\beta_{l,m,n})</math>,\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^s(a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} )= a \\ \\Delta^s(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \\ \\Delta^s(\\beta_{l,m,n})</math>, and\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} )= a \\ \\Delta^t(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \\ \\Delta^t(\\beta_{l,m,n})</math>&nbsp;.\n\nReceiver clock errors can be approximately eliminated by differencing the phases measured from satellite&nbsp;1 with that from satellite&nbsp;2 at the same epoch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/633.htm |title=Between-Satellite Differencing |publisher=Gmat.unsw.edu.au |accessdate=October 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306051358/http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/633.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> This difference is designated as <math>\\ \\Delta^s(\\phi_{1,1,1}) =  \\phi_{1,2,1} - \\phi_{1,1,1}</math>\n\nDouble differencing<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/635.htm |title=Double differencing |publisher=Gmat.unsw.edu.au |accessdate=October 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306051809/http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/635.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> computes the difference of receiver&nbsp;1's satellite difference from that of receiver&nbsp;2.

This eliminates the ambiguity associated with the integral number of wavelengths in carrier phase provided this ambiguity does not change with time. Thus the triple difference result eliminates practically all clock bias errors and the integer ambiguity. Atmospheric delay and satellite ephemeris errors have been significantly reduced. This triple difference is:\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(\\Delta^r(\\Delta^s(\\phi_{1,1,1}))) </math>\n\nTriple difference results can be used to estimate unknown variables. For example, if the position of receiver&nbsp;1 is known but the position of receiver&nbsp;2 unknown, it may be possible to estimate the position of receiver&nbsp;2 using numerical root finding and least squares. Triple difference results for three independent time pairs may be sufficient to solve for receiver&nbsp;2's three position components. This may require a numerical procedure.<ref name=\"NR1\">chapter on root finding and nonlinear sets of equations</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=William H.

This initial value can probably be provided from the navigation message and the intersection of sphere surfaces. Such a reasonable estimate can be key to successful multidimensional root finding. Iterating from three time pairs and a fairly good initial value produces one observed triple difference result for receiver&nbsp;2's position. Processing additional time pairs can improve accuracy, overdetermining the answer with multiple solutions. Least squares can estimate an overdetermined system. Least squares determines the position of receiver&nbsp;2 that best fits the observed triple difference results for receiver&nbsp;2 positions under the criterion of minimizing the sum of the squares.\n\n== Regulatory spectrum issues concerning GPS receivers ==\nIn the United States, GPS receivers are regulated under the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s (FCC) [[Title 47 CFR Part 15|Part 15]] rules.

The name of the rank is always the full phrase and is never shortened to [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]], which is a rank in various naval forces.\n\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE NATO OF CODES. THEY GO FROM 1 TO 10 AND ARE NOT THE SAME AS UNITED STATES O CODES WHICH RANK FROM 1 TO 11. OF-1 COVERS BOTH O-1 AND O-2-->\nAir commodore is a [[one-star rank]] and the most junior air officer rank, being immediately senior to [[group captain]] and immediately subordinate to [[air vice-marshal]]. It has a [[NATO]] ranking code of OF-6 and is equivalent to a [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|commodore]] in the [[Royal Navy]] or a [[brigadier]] in the [[British Army]] or the [[Royal Marines]]. Unlike these two ranks, however, it has always been a substantive rank. Additionally, air commodores have always been considered to be air officers whilst Royal Navy commodores have not since the Napoleonic Wars been classified as officers of flag rank, and British Army brigadiers have not been considered to be general officers since 1922 when they ceased to be titled as brigadier-generals. In other NATO forces, such as the [[United States Armed Forces]] and the [[Canadian Armed Forces]], the equivalent one-star rank is [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]].\n\nThe equivalent rank in the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]], [[Women's Royal Air Force]] (until 1968) and [[Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service]] (until 1980) was \"air commandant\".\n\n==Royal Air Force use and history==\nIn the present-day RAF, air commodores typically hold senior appointments within [[Group (air force)|groups]], acting directly in support of the [[air officer commanding]]. However, during the inter-war period, and in the case of the contemporary [[No. 83 Expeditionary Air Group (United Kingdom)|No. 83 Expeditionary Air Group]], the air officer commanding held or holds air commodore rank.  In the [[Air Training Corps]], an appointed air commodore holds ultimate authority over the cadet organisation as the [[Commandant Air Cadets]].\n\n===Origins===\nOn 1 April 1918, the newly created RAF adopted its officer rank titles from the [[British Army]], with officers at what is now air commodore holding the rank of [[brigadier-general]]. In response to the proposal that the RAF should use its own rank titles, it was suggested that the RAF might use the [[Royal Navy officer rank insignia|Royal Navy's officer ranks]], with the word \"air\" inserted before the naval rank title. Although the [[Admiralty]] objected to this simple modification of their rank titles, it was agreed that the RAF might base many of its officer rank titles on Navy officer ranks with differing pre-modifying terms. It was also suggested that [[air officer|air-officer]] ranks could be based on the term \"ardian\", which was derived from a combination of the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] words for \"chief\" (''ard'') and \"bird\" (''eun''), with the term \"fourth ardian\" or \"flight ardian\" being used for the equivalent to brigadier-general and commodore. However, the rank title based on the Navy rank was preferred and air commodore was adopted on 1 August 1919.\n\n===RAF insignia, command flag and star plate===\nThe rank insignia is a light-blue band on a broad black band worn on both the lower sleeves of the tunic or on the shoulders of the flying suit or the casual uniform. On the [[Mess dress|mess uniform]], air commodores wear a broad gold ring on both lower sleeves.\n\nThe command flag of an air commodore has one narrow red band running through the centre and is rectangular with a cut-away section giving it two tails. It is the only RAF command flag of this shape and it is similar in shape to that of a Royal Navy commodore's [[broad pennant]]. The vehicle star plate for an air commodore depicts a single white star (air commodore is equivalent to a one-star rank) on an air force blue background. RAF air commodores are classed as [[air officer]]s and as such have two rows of [[Scrambled egg (uniform)|gold oak leaves]] on the peak of their service dress hats.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:File-UK-Air-OF6-mess-insignia.svg|An RAF air commodore's sleeve mess insignia\nFile:RAF-Air Cdre-OF-6.png            |An RAF air commodore's sleeve on No. 1 service dress uniform\nImage:UK-Air-OF6-Flag.svg             |An air commodore's command flag\n</gallery>\n\n===Honorary air commodores, air commodores-in-chief and air commandants===\n{{See also|:Category:Honorary air commodores}}\n[[Image:Churchil at the Tehran Conference 1943.jpg|thumbnail|right|150px|Churchill in his air commodore's uniform at the 1943 Tehran Conference]]\nThe [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|reigning monarch]] may appoint honorary air commodores for RAF flying squadrons and stations.

It is designed to strengthen the bond between the military unit and the individual and promote the role of the air force amongst the public.\n\nServing officers, such as [[Prince Harry]], may be granted an equivalent appointment to the honorary rank. In such cases the individual is made an honorary air commandant and they retain their regular rank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Pressreleases/2008/ANNOUNCEMENTOFNEWROYALAIRFORCEHONORARYAPPOINTMENTS.aspx|title=New Royal Air Force honorary appointments|publisher=The Official Website of the British Monarchy|date=2 October 2008|accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nLarger air force organisations or formations may be honoured by having an [[air commodore-in-chief]] appointed in their name. These RAF appointments are rare and to date (2020) have been given to just five senior members of the royal family, of whom three were reigning or [[Prince of Wales|future]] monarchs of the United Kingdom. Air commodore-in-chief is not a rank and such an appointment does not convey the rank of air commodore upon the recipient.\n\n==Other air forces==\n\n===Commonwealth of Nations===\nThe rank of air commodore is also used in a number of the air forces in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], including the [[Bangladesh Air Force]], [[Ghana Air Force]], [[Indian Air Force]], [[Namibian Air Force]], [[Pakistan Air Force]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paf.gov.pk/ranks.html |title=PAKISTAN AIR FORCE - Official website |publisher=Paf.gov.pk |accessdate=15 March 2019}}</ref> [[Royal Australian Air Force]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/structure/rank-comparative/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530232935/https://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/structure/rank-comparative/ |archive-date=30 May 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] and [[Sri Lanka Air Force]].\n\nThe [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] used the rank until the unification of the [[Canadian Forces]] in 1968, when army-type rank titles were adopted. An air commodore then became a brigadier-general (following the US Armed Forces title, rather than the British [[brigadier]], which had been held by equivalent officers in the former [[Canadian Army]]). In official French Canadian usage, the rank title was ''commodore de l'air''. The position of honorary air commodore still exists in the [[Royal Canadian Air Cadets]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAs with the RAF, large air force organisations or formations in the other [[Commonwealth realms]] may be honoured by having an [[air commodore-in-chief]] appointed in their name. These appointments are rare and to date (2020) have been given to just three senior members of the royal family{{snd}}[[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] and [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]{{snd}}in just three non-UK Commonwealth air forces ([[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]], [[Royal New Zealand Air Force|RNZAF]], [[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]]). Air commodore-in-chief is not a rank and such an appointment does not convey the rank of air commodore upon the recipient.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:RAAF O7 rank.png        |An [[RAAF]] air commodore's rank insignia.\nFile:Canadian RCAF OF-6.svg   |An [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]] brigadier-general's rank insignia.\nFile:Air Commodore of IAF.png |An [[Indian Air Force|IAF]] air commodore's rank insignia.\nFile:NZ-Air-OF6.svg           |An [[Royal New Zealand Air Force|RNZAF]] air commodore's rank insignia.\nFile:13-Namibia Air Force-AIRCDRE.svg          |A [[Namibian Air Force]] air commodore's rank insignia.\n\n</gallery>\n\n===Non-Commonwealth countries===\nAir commodore, a [[calque]] or near-literal translation is also a rank in the [[Egyptian Air Force]], [[Royal Air Force of Oman]], the [[Royal Thai Air Force]] and the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].\n\nIn the [[Indonesian Air Force]] the rank of [[Indonesian military ranks|''Komodor Udara'']], a calque of \"air commodore\" was used until 1973. The present equivalent is [[Indonesian military ranks|''Marsekal Pertama'']], a calque of \"First Marshal\" and this is usually translated into English as air commodore.\n\nWhile the names of most ranks of the [[Hellenic Air Force]] (HAF) are [[Greek language]] calques of RAF ranks, the HAF equivalent of O-7/OF-6 is ''[[Taxiarch]]os tis aeroporias'', which may be literally translated from modern Greek as \"brigadier of the air force\" (or \"aviation brigadier\"). (A [[free translation]] of the army rank of ''taxiarchis'', which originated in ancient Greece, is \"one who orders\" and the Greek root \u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 ''taxis'' is also the basis of the aviation term [[taxiing|taxi]] \u2013 that is, to move one or more aircraft on the ground.)

The name of the rank is always the full phrase and is never shortened to [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]], which is a rank in various naval forces.\n\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE NATO OF CODES. THEY GO FROM 1 TO 10 AND ARE NOT THE SAME AS UNITED STATES O CODES WHICH RANK FROM 1 TO 11. OF-1 COVERS BOTH O-1 AND O-2-->\nAir commodore is a [[one-star rank]] and the most junior air officer rank, being immediately senior to [[group captain]] and immediately subordinate to [[air vice-marshal]]. It has a [[NATO]] ranking code of OF-6 and is equivalent to a [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|commodore]] in the [[Royal Navy]] or a [[brigadier]] in the [[British Army]] or the [[Royal Marines]]. Unlike these two ranks, however, it has always been a substantive rank. Additionally, air commodores have always been considered to be air officers whilst Royal Navy commodores have not since the Napoleonic Wars been classified as officers of flag rank, and British Army brigadiers have not been considered to be general officers since 1922 when they ceased to be titled as brigadier-generals. In other NATO forces, such as the [[United States Armed Forces]] and the [[Canadian Armed Forces]], the equivalent one-star rank is [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]].\n\nThe equivalent rank in the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]], [[Women's Royal Air Force]] (until 1968) and [[Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service]] (until 1980) was \"air commandant\".\n\n==Royal Air Force use and history==\nIn the present-day RAF, air commodores typically hold senior appointments within [[Group (air force)|groups]], acting directly in support of the [[air officer commanding]]. However, during the inter-war period, and in the case of the contemporary [[No. 83 Expeditionary Air Group (United Kingdom)|No. 83 Expeditionary Air Group]], the air officer commanding held or holds air commodore rank.  In the [[Air Training Corps]], an appointed air commodore holds ultimate authority over the cadet organisation as the [[Commandant Air Cadets]].\n\n===Origins===\nOn 1 April 1918, the newly created RAF adopted its officer rank titles from the [[British Army]], with officers at what is now air commodore holding the rank of [[brigadier-general]]. In response to the proposal that the RAF should use its own rank titles, it was suggested that the RAF might use the [[Royal Navy officer rank insignia|Royal Navy's officer ranks]], with the word \"air\" inserted before the naval rank title. Although the [[Admiralty]] objected to this simple modification of their rank titles, it was agreed that the RAF might base many of its officer rank titles on Navy officer ranks with differing pre-modifying terms. It was also suggested that [[air officer|air-officer]] ranks could be based on the term \"ardian\", which was derived from a combination of the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] words for \"chief\" (''ard'') and \"bird\" (''eun''), with the term \"fourth ardian\" or \"flight ardian\" being used for the equivalent to brigadier-general and commodore. However, the rank title based on the Navy rank was preferred and air commodore was adopted on 1 August 1919.\n\n===RAF insignia, command flag and star plate===\nThe rank insignia is a light-blue band on a broad black band worn on both the lower sleeves of the tunic or on the shoulders of the flying suit or the casual uniform. On the [[Mess dress|mess uniform]], air commodores wear a broad gold ring on both lower sleeves.\n\nThe command flag of an air commodore has one narrow red band running through the centre and is rectangular with a cut-away section giving it two tails. It is the only RAF command flag of this shape and it is similar in shape to that of a Royal Navy commodore's [[broad pennant]]. The vehicle star plate for an air commodore depicts a single white star (air commodore is equivalent to a one-star rank) on an air force blue background. RAF air commodores are classed as [[air officer]]s and as such have two rows of [[Scrambled egg (uniform)|gold oak leaves]] on the peak of their service dress hats.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:File-UK-Air-OF6-mess-insignia.svg|An RAF air commodore's sleeve mess insignia\nFile:RAF-Air Cdre-OF-6.png            |An RAF air commodore's sleeve on No. 1 service dress uniform\nImage:UK-Air-OF6-Flag.svg             |An air commodore's command flag\n</gallery>\n\n===Honorary air commodores, air commodores-in-chief and air commandants===\n{{See also|:Category:Honorary air commodores}}\n[[Image:Churchil at the Tehran Conference 1943.jpg|thumbnail|right|150px|Churchill in his air commodore's uniform at the 1943 Tehran Conference]]\nThe [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|reigning monarch]] may appoint honorary air commodores for RAF flying squadrons and stations.

It is designed to strengthen the bond between the military unit and the individual and promote the role of the air force amongst the public.\n\nServing officers, such as [[Prince Harry]], may be granted an equivalent appointment to the honorary rank. In such cases the individual is made an honorary air commandant and they retain their regular rank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Pressreleases/2008/ANNOUNCEMENTOFNEWROYALAIRFORCEHONORARYAPPOINTMENTS.aspx|title=New Royal Air Force honorary appointments|publisher=The Official Website of the British Monarchy|date=2 October 2008|accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nLarger air force organisations or formations may be honoured by having an [[air commodore-in-chief]] appointed in their name. These RAF appointments are rare and to date (2020) have been given to just five senior members of the royal family, of whom three were reigning or [[Prince of Wales|future]] monarchs of the United Kingdom. Air commodore-in-chief is not a rank and such an appointment does not convey the rank of air commodore upon the recipient.\n\n==Other air forces==\n\n===Commonwealth of Nations===\nThe rank of air commodore is also used in a number of the air forces in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], including the [[Bangladesh Air Force]], [[Ghana Air Force]], [[Indian Air Force]], [[Namibian Air Force]], [[Pakistan Air Force]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paf.gov.pk/ranks.html |title=PAKISTAN AIR FORCE - Official website |publisher=Paf.gov.pk |accessdate=15 March 2019}}</ref> [[Royal Australian Air Force]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/structure/rank-comparative/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530232935/https://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/structure/rank-comparative/ |archive-date=30 May 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] and [[Sri Lanka Air Force]].\n\nThe [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] used the rank until the unification of the [[Canadian Forces]] in 1968, when army-type rank titles were adopted. An air commodore then became a brigadier-general (following the US Armed Forces title, rather than the British [[brigadier]], which had been held by equivalent officers in the former [[Canadian Army]]). In official French Canadian usage, the rank title was ''commodore de l'air''. The position of honorary air commodore still exists in the [[Royal Canadian Air Cadets]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAs with the RAF, large air force organisations or formations in the other [[Commonwealth realms]] may be honoured by having an [[air commodore-in-chief]] appointed in their name. These appointments are rare and to date (2020) have been given to just three senior members of the royal family{{snd}}[[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] and [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]{{snd}}in just three non-UK Commonwealth air forces ([[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]], [[Royal New Zealand Air Force|RNZAF]], [[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]]). Air commodore-in-chief is not a rank and such an appointment does not convey the rank of air commodore upon the recipient.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:RAAF O7 rank.png        |An [[RAAF]] air commodore's rank insignia.\nFile:Canadian RCAF OF-6.svg   |An [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]] brigadier-general's rank insignia.\nFile:Air Commodore of IAF.png |An [[Indian Air Force|IAF]] air commodore's rank insignia.\nFile:NZ-Air-OF6.svg           |An [[Royal New Zealand Air Force|RNZAF]] air commodore's rank insignia.\n</gallery>\n\n===Non-Commonwealth countries===\nAir commodore, a [[calque]] or near-literal translation is also a rank in the [[Egyptian Air Force]], [[Royal Air Force of Oman]], the [[Royal Thai Air Force]] and the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].\n\nIn the [[Indonesian Air Force]] the rank of [[Indonesian military ranks|''Komodor Udara'']], a calque of \"air commodore\" was used until 1973. The present equivalent is [[Indonesian military ranks|''Marsekal Pertama'']], a calque of \"First Marshal\" and this is usually translated into English as air commodore.\n\nWhile the names of most ranks of the [[Hellenic Air Force]] (HAF) are [[Greek language]] calques of RAF ranks, the HAF equivalent of O-7/OF-6 is ''[[Taxiarch]]os tis aeroporias'', which may be literally translated from modern Greek as \"brigadier of the air force\" (or \"aviation brigadier\"). (A [[free translation]] of the army rank of ''taxiarchis'', which originated in ancient Greece, is \"one who orders\" and the Greek root \u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 ''taxis'' is also the basis of the aviation term [[taxiing|taxi]] \u2013 that is, to move one or more aircraft on the ground.) Nevertheless, ''Taxiarchos tis aeroporias'' is normally rendered into English as \"air commodore\" and the rank was introduced during the Second World War,{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} after the Greek armed forces were reconstituted in exile, often alongside or within Commonwealth military formations, such as [[RAF Middle East Command]].\n\nOther air forces have, or once had, an equivalent rank named simply commodore (or a derived term such as ''comodoro''), without the qualifying prefix \"air\".

Chinnaiah / Chinna (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) an orphan, a trusted servant, raised along with Babu in their house. They share a bond beyond a casual friendship, one of the brothers and it is acknowledged by Babu's mother Jagadamba (Santha Kumari) who treats both of equally. Once Chinna and Babu tease Parvathi (Savitri), a school teacher in their harbor school when she slaps Chinna thereafter they fall in love.  Diwanji (Gummadi) look after business affairs, is a crooked & cruel person who wants to grab the entire property. In many ways, he tries to cheat and manipulate Babu but at every step, Chinna stands as a barrier between them and protects his sovereign. Diwanji gets fed up with Chinna's behavior, insults him and remembers that he is, after all, a servant. Angered Babu, immediately gives Chinna entire authority on his property. Diwanji could not tolerate it, he uses innocence and pretends to resign the job. Here Jagadamba feels that it's good for everyone to separate Chinna & Babu. She offers a huge amount to Chinna and asks him to go away from Babu, so that, Babu could take up his responsibilities. But Chinna throws away the money and replies, he cannot live without Babu. Then Jagadamba pleads him, so, he gives her a word to do it. Knowing that Chinna is leaving Babu prays him to not do so but Chinna does not stand, therefore, Babu keeps the oath on him not to move which makes Chinna as a statue. At that moment, Jagadamba's diplomacy fails to bring them together. Time being, Babu marries a zamindar's daughter Padma (Kanchana).\n\nMeanwhile, Gopalakrishna humors and teases Chinna about Parvathi, and in a bid to force him to accept love for Parvathi, asks him to bring her to him for pleasure. He obliges and asks Parvathi the same. Heartbroken, she confronts and gives herself to Gopalakrishna who refuses her and explains the situation. She refuses to ever go back to Chinna and remains heartbroken and angry against him. In a bid to clean his image and push Chinna to senses, Gopalakrishna marries Padmavathi (Kanchana). With Chinna's help, she understands the complex character of Gopalakrishna and they form a good marital bond. Meanwhile, Parvathi continues to wither away. Labor problems persist in the factory with no one having a clue about how to handle them. Chinna is sent as a trojan horse into the labor camp by Babu to prey upon the belief and vulnerabilities of the workforce. With some acting and help from Gopalakrishna, Chinna establishes himself as a labor leader but his true intentions are only to serve his master. Parvathi sees through the drama and desperately tries to educate the labor masses against the plot to no avail. The blind belief of the laborers and their plights changes Chinna's heart. He confronts Gopalakrishna and stands up as their leader in a true light. Parvathi continues to not believe him and accuses him at will.\n\nBabu finds it impossible to bear the growing separation between him and Chinna and tries to lure him back to his camp. With each refusal of Chinna, Gopalakrishna's ego flares and it leads to violent behavior from him. In one instance, he snaps off at Simhalu (Relangi), a laborer, physically assaulting him. Babu is saved by Chinna from the mob. Chinna then tries to prove himself by asking Babu to apologize, who refuses. In uncontrollable fury, Gopalakrishna half-sanctions Chinna's murder. Diwan contrives to take these loose words into action. Knowing full well from Padmavathi's help that his life is under threat, Chinna continues on to a peaceful march for self-respect to Babu's house. This earns him back Parvathi's respect. Ignoring her pleas of life being more important, he marches on. The mob is controlled at the house by Chinna. Babu, despite carrying his gun to the mob, fails to point it to Chinna, but a counterplan by the Diwan backfires as Appalu (Chadalawada), who is the Diwan's henchman, times wrong and fires at Chinna who meets a heroic death. Babu realizes his mistakes but it is too late. Sensing ominous signs, Parvathi too falls at the feet of the local deity and dies. The culprits are all arrested by the police.

Settlement began in 1738, when Abijah Foster arrived with his wife and infant daughter.  In 1762, Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] incorporated the town as \"Ipswich\", and then in 1766 as \"New Ipswich\".  [[New Ipswich Academy]], later renamed Appleton Academy after benefactor [[Samuel Appleton (merchant)|Samuel Appleton]], was chartered in 1789,<ref>[http://www.nh.gov/nhes/elmi/htmlprofiles/newipswich.html New Ipswich, New Hampshire] at nh.gov. Retrieved February 21, 2009.</ref> the second oldest in [[New Hampshire]] after [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] in [[Exeter, New Hampshire|Exeter]]. It would also serve as high school for the nearby communities of [[Mason, New Hampshire|Mason]] and [[Greenville, New Hampshire|Greenville]]. Appleton Academy closed in 2012, due to the dangerous conditions of occupying it. In 1969, construction of Mascenic Regional High School was completed, rendering high school teaching in Appleton no more, although the building was still used to teach elementary schoolers and middle schoolers. In 1989 Boynton Middle school completed construction, so Appleton was from then to 2012 a elementary school.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Image:Baptist Church, New Ipswich, NH.jpg|thumb|right|Baptist Church c. 1912]]\nThe [[Souhegan River]] provided [[water power]] for mills, and in 1801, the first [[woolen]] mill in the state was established at New Ipswich, followed in 1804 by the first [[cotton]] mill.  Other early factories produced [[glass]], [[potash]] and [[linseed oil]].  [[Cabinet making]] craftsmen produced elegant furniture.  The town's affluence would be expressed in fine [[architecture]], an example of which is the [[Barrett House (New Ipswich, New Hampshire)|Barrett House]], used as a setting for the 1979 [[Merchant Ivory]] film of ''[[The Europeans]]'' by [[Henry James]].  Bypassed by the [[railroad]], the early mill town was preserved.\n\nIn the past half century, a notable influx of peoples of Finnish descent, particularly of the [[Apostolic Lutheran Church of America]], have settled in New Ipswich. Additionally, migrants from nearby Massachusetts make up a large percentage of new residents.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|33.1|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|32.8|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|0.3|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} is water, comprising 0.97% of the town.  New Ipswich is drained by the Souhegan River.  [[New Ipswich Mountain]], part of the [[Wapack Range]], is the highest point in the town, with an elevation of {{convert|1881|ft|m}} above [[sea level]]. Much of the town is made up of the wooded foothills of the Wapack Range. Secondary growth forests have reclaimed the vast majority of the pasture lands that dominated New Ipswich and much of New England at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\n=== Adjacent municipalities ===\n* [[Temple, New Hampshire]] (north)\n* [[Greenville, New Hampshire]] (east)\n* [[Mason, New Hampshire]] (southeast)\n* [[Ashby, Massachusetts]] (south)\n* [[Ashburnham, Massachusetts]] (southwest)\n* [[Rindge, New Hampshire]] (west)\n* [[Sharon, New Hampshire]] (northwest)\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1790= 1241\n|1800= 1266\n|1810= 1895\n|1820= 1278\n|1830= 1673\n|1840= 1578\n|1850= 1877\n|1860= 1701\n|1870= 1380\n|1880= 1222\n|1890= 969\n|1900= 911\n|1910= 927\n|1920= 869\n|1930= 838\n|1940= 940\n|1950= 1147\n|1960= 1455\n|1970= 1803\n|1980= 2433\n|1990= 4014\n|2000= 4289\n|2010= 5099\n|estyear=2017\n|estimate=5277\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2017\">{{cite web|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2017/PEPANNRES/0400000US33.06100|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2017 (PEPANNRES): Minor Civil Divisions \u2013 New Hampshire|accessdate=November 15, 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213183945/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2017/PEPANNRES/0400000US33.06100|archive-date=February 13, 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n[[Image:Main Street, New Ipswich, NH.jpg|thumb|left|Main Street in 1907]]\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 4,289 people, 1,350 households, and 1,089 families residing in the town.

In 1762, Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] incorporated the town as \"Ipswich\", and then in 1766 as \"New Ipswich\".  [[New Ipswich Academy]], later renamed Appleton Academy after benefactor [[Samuel Appleton (merchant)|Samuel Appleton]], was chartered in 1789,<ref>[http://www.nh.gov/nhes/elmi/htmlprofiles/newipswich.html New Ipswich, New Hampshire] at nh.gov. Retrieved February 21, 2009.</ref> the second oldest in [[New Hampshire]] after [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] in [[Exeter, New Hampshire|Exeter]].  It would also serve as high school for the nearby communities of [[Mason, New Hampshire|Mason]] and [[Greenville, New Hampshire|Greenville]].  Appleton Academy closed in 2012, due to the dangerous conditions of occupying it. In 1969, construction of Mascenic Regional High School was completed, rendering high school teaching in Appleton no more, Although the building was still used to teach elementary schoolers and middle schoolers. In 1989 Boynton Middle school completed construction, so Appleton was from then to 2012 a elementary school.\n\n\n[[Image:Baptist Church, New Ipswich, NH.jpg|thumb|right|Baptist Church c. 1912]]\nThe [[Souhegan River]] provided [[water power]] for mills, and in 1801, the first [[woolen]] mill in the state was established at New Ipswich, followed in 1804 by the first [[cotton]] mill.  Other early factories produced [[glass]], [[potash]] and [[linseed oil]].  [[Cabinet making]] craftsmen produced elegant furniture.  The town's affluence would be expressed in fine [[architecture]], an example of which is the [[Barrett House (New Ipswich, New Hampshire)|Barrett House]], used as a setting for the 1979 [[Merchant Ivory]] film of ''[[The Europeans]]'' by [[Henry James]].  Bypassed by the [[railroad]], the early mill town was preserved.\n\nIn the past half century, a notable influx of peoples of Finnish descent, particularly of the [[Apostolic Lutheran Church of America]], have settled in New Ipswich. Additionally, migrants from nearby Massachusetts make up a large percentage of new residents.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|33.1|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|32.8|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|0.3|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} is water, comprising 0.97% of the town.  New Ipswich is drained by the Souhegan River.  [[New Ipswich Mountain]], part of the [[Wapack Range]], is the highest point in the town, with an elevation of {{convert|1881|ft|m}} above [[sea level]]. Much of the town is made up of the wooded foothills of the Wapack Range. Secondary growth forests have reclaimed the vast majority of the pasture lands that dominated New Ipswich and much of New England at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\n=== Adjacent municipalities ===\n* [[Temple, New Hampshire]] (north)\n* [[Greenville, New Hampshire]] (east)\n* [[Mason, New Hampshire]] (southeast)\n* [[Ashby, Massachusetts]] (south)\n* [[Ashburnham, Massachusetts]] (southwest)\n* [[Rindge, New Hampshire]] (west)\n* [[Sharon, New Hampshire]] (northwest)\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1790= 1241\n|1800= 1266\n|1810= 1895\n|1820= 1278\n|1830= 1673\n|1840= 1578\n|1850= 1877\n|1860= 1701\n|1870= 1380\n|1880= 1222\n|1890= 969\n|1900= 911\n|1910= 927\n|1920= 869\n|1930= 838\n|1940= 940\n|1950= 1147\n|1960= 1455\n|1970= 1803\n|1980= 2433\n|1990= 4014\n|2000= 4289\n|2010= 5099\n|estyear=2017\n|estimate=5277\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2017\">{{cite web|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2017/PEPANNRES/0400000US33.06100|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2017 (PEPANNRES): Minor Civil Divisions \u2013 New Hampshire|accessdate=November 15, 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213183945/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2017/PEPANNRES/0400000US33.06100|archive-date=February 13, 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n[[Image:Main Street, New Ipswich, NH.jpg|thumb|left|Main Street in 1907]]\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 4,289 people, 1,350 households, and 1,089 families residing in the town.

Walters, who was Deputy Secretary-General of the [[League of Nations]], and a French mother. The family left Switzerland for England after the outbreak of World War II and Walters initially joined the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force|WAAF]] in 1941 (Service Number 2001920.<ref>Squadron Leader Beryl E. Escott, ''Mission Improbable: A salute to the RAF women of SOE in wartime France'', London, Patrick Stevens Limited, 1991.  {{ISBN|1-85260-289-9}}</ref>) On 6 July 1943 she was recruited into SOE and during the summer and autumn of that year underwent training as an agent at the [[List of SOE establishments|SOE Special Training School 23]] at Loch Morar, Scotland.<ref>National Archives, Kew, HS 9/339/2 (filed under her married name of Anne-Marie Comert)</ref>\n\n==World War II==\n===In France with SOE===\nSOE's appraisal of Walters after the completion of her training was cautionary. \"She is well-educated, intelligent, quick, practical, and cunning...[but] She will not hesitate always to make use of her physical attractiveness in gaining influence over men. In this respect she is likely to have a disturbing effect in any group in which she is a member.\" Nevertheless, she was approved to be sent to France as an agent of SOE.<ref>Gildea, pp. 149-150</ref>  \n\nThe first attempt to parachute her into France in December 1943 failed because of bad weather over the drop zone and ended with a return to England and a crash-landing at a diversionary airfield because of widespread fog. She suffered a minor head injury in the landing.<ref name=\"National Archives, Kew, HS 9/339/2\">National Archives, Kew, HS 9/339/2</ref><ref>Walters, Anne-Marie (2009), ''Moondrop to Gascony'' Wiltshire: Mojo Books, pp. 32-38</ref>\n\nIn the company of a fellow agent, [[:fr:Claude Arnault|Claude Arnault]] (code name ''N\u00e9ron,'' but more commonly called ''Jean-Claude''), she was successfully dropped into the [[Armagnac (province)|Armagnac]] area in SW France on the night of 3/4 January 1944,  to join [[George Reginald Starr|George Starr]]\u2019s [[SOE F Section networks#Wheelwright|WHEELWRIGHT]] network (also called circuit and ''reseau'').<ref>Foot M.R.D., ''SOE in France'', (Routledge 2004), 332.</ref> Walters acted as a courier for Starr until after D-Day. [[Yvonne Cormeau]] was Starr's wireless operator. Arnault, who was the same age as Walters, was an explosives expert. Walter's cover story was that she was a student from Paris recovering from pneumonia who was visiting a farmer friend of her fathers. She stayed with the family in their farmhouse at Mamoulens.  Starr's headquarters were {{convert|3|km|mile}} distant at [[Castelnau-sur-l'Auvignon]].<ref>Walters, pp. 46-56, 246; Google Earth</ref> Early in her stay in France, Starr visited her almost every day and she had to interrupt work to chat with him. She said she wished for more independence. In her book Walters never mentions the presence of Cormeau, the efficient wireless operator.<ref>Walters, pp. 46-56, 72, 246</ref>\n\nAs a courier, Walters traveled widely by bus, train, bicycle, and charcoal-powered vehicle around southwestern France. One of her first jobs was to organize the flight to [[Spain]] across the [[Pyrenees]] of a group of 15 members of the [[French Resistance]] who had escaped from a French prison. She also helped convey several suitcases full of explosives to [[Toulouse]] to blow up a powder factory.<ref>Escott, pp. 137-138</ref><ref>Walters, p. 72</ref>\n\nWalters, in the words of local historian Raymond Escholier, was well liked by the resistance fighters, the [[Maquis (World War II)|marquisards]].  She was regarded as \"the true sister of the marquisards.\"<ref>Glass, Charles (2018), ''They Fought Alone,'' New York: Penquin Press, p. 153</ref>\n\n===Battle of Castelnau===\nWith the [[Normandy Invasion]] on 6 June 1944, the [[Maquis (World War II)|maquis]] of the resistance became bolder and the Germans more aggressive in suppressing any opposition to their occupation of France.  Starr collected about 300 men, one-half French and one-half Spanish, and arms at Castelnau sur l'Auvignon, but on June 21 an estimated 2,000 soldiers of the German army attacked Starr's men. During the battle, Walters distributed hand grenades to the maquisards, buried incriminating documents, and collected SOE money and took it with her when she and the maquisards withdrew from the village. Nineteen of the maquisards were killed. After the battle, Starr and his men joined with other factions of the resistance to form the \"Armagnac Batallion\" commanded by a French officer, Maurice Parisot, which harried the Germany army in the region.<ref>Gildea, pp. 363-364</ref><ref>Escott, pp. 138-139</ref>\n\n===Starr wars===\nWalter's appraisal of Starr was unflattering. She later said, \"[Starr] is strictly an agent and neither a politician nor a military strategist...the guerrilla action he commanded was most unsuccessful.\" Starr was even more critical of his youthful courier. Among his complaints about Walters, was that she wore \"high Paris fashion,\" thus violating his principle that couriers should be inconspicuous.<ref>Hastings, Max (2013), ''Das Reich,'' Minneapolis: Zenith Press, p. 66</ref> He ordered her to leave France. On 31 July 1944, Starr sent a message to SOE headquarters in London explaining his action. \"Have had to send Colette [Walters] back because she is undisciplined in spite of my efforts to train her...Most indiscreet. Very man-mad, also disobedient...totally unsuitable.\" However, he acknowledged her courage and willingness to undertake any mission. She left France approximately August 1, 1944 and traveled through Spain en route to [[Algiers]].<ref>Hewson, David in Walters, Anne-Marie, ''Moondrop to Gascony,'' pp. 230-231</ref>\n\nIn Algiers, Walters met with British military authorities who proposed that she return to France to assist the military personnel involved in [[Operation Jedburgh]]. She was agreeable, but SOE vetoed that proposal and ordered her to return to London.<ref>Hewson, p. 230</ref>  \n\nWhen Walters returned to London, she wrote a report (which has not survived) to [[Maurice Buckmaster]], head of the French section of SOE.  Later, in another report, she said that while she was in France Starr had ordered her to be thrown into prison, accused her of having an affair with another agent and of spreading stories that he was having an affair with a female SOE agent.  Walters praised Starr's courage and abilities, but criticized him severely on other counts. Starr, she said, had a Russian bodyguard named Buresie who \"carried out absolutely horrible tortures\" on captured French collaborators. She said Starr was under the influence of his bodyguard and cited several examples of tortures. She added, however, that \"Had [Starr] not been influenced in all this....I am sure that he would never have started it [the tortures].\" <ref>Hewson, pp 231-233</ref> \n\nOn 1 November 1944, Starr, who had returned to London, was interviewed by SOE. He recounted \"with relish\" an incident of torture, causing consternation in the SOE although the interviewers said that he could not be blamed for the tortures committed by the French Resistance.  In February 1945, a court of enquiry with testimony from Starr, Walters, and others took place.  The part of the transcript of the enquiry containing Walter's testimony has disappeared from the record. On 28 February, the conclusion of the \"rather perfunctory court of enquiry\" (in the words of [[M.R.D. Foot]]),<ref>Foot, p. 436</ref> was that \"there is no justification whatever for any imputation against Lt. Col. Starr of inhumanity or cruel treatment to any prisoner at any time under his control or under the control or troops or resistance forces under his immediate command or control.\"<ref>Hewson, p. 235</ref>\n\n==Honours and awards==\nOn 17 July 1945, in recognition of her \"personal courage and willingness to undergo any danger,\" Walters was awarded the [[MBE (Order of the British Empire)|MBE]] (Civil list) for her work in occupied France<ref name=\"National Archives, Kew, HS 9/339/2\"/> and, from France, the [[Croix de Guerre]] and the [[M\u00e9daille de la Reconnaissance fran\u00e7aise]].<ref>Hewson, p. 236</ref><ref>''Le Batallion de Guerilla de l'Armagnac'' (Amicale du Bataillon de l'Armagnac et A.I.T.I. sarl, 2002), 77</ref>\n\n<center>\n[[File:Order of the British Empire (Civil) Ribbon.png|93px]]\n\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=39-45 Star BAR.svg|width=103}}\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=France and Germany Star BAR.svg|width=103}}\n[[File:Ribbon - Defence Medal.png|x29px]]\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=War Medal 1939\u20131945 (UK) ribbon.png|width=93}}\n\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Croix de Guerre 1939-1945 ribbon.svg|width=103}}\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Medaille de la Resistance ribbon.svg|width=103}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-align=center\n|colspan=4| Member of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (Civil)\n|-align=center\n|[[1939\u20131945 Star]]\n|[[France and Germany Star]]\n|[[Defence Medal (United Kingdom)|Defence Medal]]\n|[[War Medal 1939\u20131945|War Medal]]\n|-align=center\n|colspan=2|[[Croix de guerre 1939\u20131945 (France)|Croix de Guerre (France)]]\n|colspan=2|[[Resistance Medal|M\u00e9daille de la R\u00e9sistance]]\n|}\n</center>\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1946, Walters published an account of her experiences in ''Moondrop to Gascony'' (Macmillan, 1946; [http://www.moho-books.com/moondrop.html Moho Books], 2009).

The family left Switzerland for England after the outbreak of World War II and Walters initially joined the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force|WAAF]] in 1941 (Service Number 2001920.<ref>Squadron Leader Beryl E. Escott, ''Mission Improbable: A salute to the RAF women of SOE in wartime France'', London, Patrick Stevens Limited, 1991.  {{ISBN|1-85260-289-9}}</ref>) On 6 July 1943 she was recruited into SOE and during the summer and autumn of that year underwent training as an agent at the [[List of SOE establishments|SOE Special Training School 23]] at Loch Morar, Scotland.<ref>National Archives, Kew, HS 9/339/2 (filed under her married name of Anne-Marie Comert)</ref>\n\n==World War II==\n===In France with SOE===\nSOE's appraisal of Walters after the completion of her training was cautionary. \"She is well-educated, intelligent, quick, practical, and cunning...[but] She will not hesitate always to make use of her physical attractiveness in gaining influence over men. In this respect she is likely to have a disturbing effect in any group in which she is a member.\" Nevertheless, she was approved to be sent to France as an agent of SOE.<ref>Gildea, pp. 149-150</ref>  \n\nThe first attempt to parachute her into France in December 1943 failed because of bad weather over the drop zone and ended with a return to England and a crash-landing at a diversionary airfield because of widespread fog. She suffered a minor head injury in the landing.<ref name=\"National Archives, Kew, HS 9/339/2\">National Archives, Kew, HS 9/339/2</ref><ref>Walters, Anne-Marie (2009), ''Moondrop to Gascony'' Wiltshire: Mojo Books, pp. 32-38</ref>\n\nIn the company of a fellow agent, [[:fr:Claude Arnault|Claude Arnault]] (code name ''N\u00e9ron,'' but more commonly called ''Jean-Claude''), she was successfully dropped into the [[Armagnac (province)|Armagnac]] area in SW France on the night of 3/4 January 1944,  to join [[George Reginald Starr|George Starr]]\u2019s [[SOE F Section networks#Wheelwright|WHEELWRIGHT]] network (also called circuit and ''reseau'').<ref>Foot M.R.D., ''SOE in France'', (Routledge 2004), 332.</ref> Walters acted as a courier for Starr until after D-Day. [[Yvonne Cormeau]] was Starr's wireless operator. Arnault, who was the same age as Walters, was an explosives expert. Walter's cover story was that she was a student from Paris recovering from pneumonia who was visiting a farmer friend of her fathers. She stayed with the family in their farmhouse at Mamoulens.  Starr's headquarters were {{convert|3|km|mile}} distant at [[Castelnau-sur-l'Auvignon]].<ref>Walters, pp. 46-56, 246; Google Earth</ref> Early in her stay in France, Starr visited her almost every day and she had to interrupt work to chat with him. She said she wished for more independence. In her book Walters never mentions the presence of Cormeau, the efficient wireless operator.<ref>Walters, pp. 46-56, 72, 246</ref>\n\nAs a courier, Walters traveled widely by bus, train, bicycle, and charcoal-powered vehicle around southwestern France. One of her first jobs was to organize the flight to [[Spain]] across the [[Pyrenees]] of a group of 15 members of the [[French Resistance]] who had escaped from a French prison. She also helped convey several suitcases full of explosives to [[Toulouse]] to blow up a powder factory.<ref>Escott, pp. 137-138</ref><ref>Walters, p. 72</ref>\n\nWalters, in the words of local historian Raymond Escholier, was well liked by the resistance fighters, the [[Maquis (World War II)|marquisards]].  She was regarded as \"the true sister of the marquisards.\"<ref>Glass, Charles (2018), ''They Fought Alone,'' New York: Penquin Press, p. 153</ref>\n\n===Battle of Castelnau===\nWith the [[Normandy Invasion]] on 6 June 1944, the [[Maquis (World War II)|maquis]] of the resistance became bolder and the Germans more aggressive in suppressing any opposition to their occupation of France.  Starr collected about 300 men, one-half French and one-half Spanish, and arms at Castelnau sur l'Auvignon, but on June 21 an estimated 2,000 soldiers of the German army attacked Starr's men. During the battle, Walters distributed hand grenades to the maquisards, buried incriminating documents, and collected SOE money and took it with her when she and the maquisards withdrew from the village. Nineteen of the maquisards were killed. After the battle, Starr and his men joined with other factions of the resistance to form the \"Armagnac Batallion\" commanded by a French officer, Maurice Parisot, which harried the Germany army in the region.<ref>Gildea, pp. 363-364</ref><ref>Escott, pp. 138-139</ref>\n\n===Starr wars===\nWalter's appraisal of Starr was unflattering. She later said, \"[Starr] is strictly an agent and neither a politician nor a military strategist...the guerrilla action he commanded was most unsuccessful.\" Starr was even more critical of his youthful courier. Among his complaints about Walters, was that she wore \"high Paris fashion,\" thus violating his principle that couriers should be inconspicuous.<ref>Hastings, Max (2013), ''Das Reich,'' Minneapolis: Zenith Press, p. 66</ref> He ordered her to leave France. On 31 July 1944, Starr sent a message to SOE headquarters in London explaining his action. \"Have had to send Colette [Walters] back because she is undisciplined in spite of my efforts to train her...Most indiscreet. Very man-mad, also disobedient...totally unsuitable.\" However, he acknowledged her courage and willingness to undertake any mission. She left France approximately August 1, 1944 and traveled through Spain en route to [[Algiers]].<ref>Hewson, David in Walters, Anne-Marie, ''Moondrop to Gascony,'' pp. 230-231</ref>\n\nIn Algiers, Walters met with British military authorities who proposed that she return to France to assist the military personnel involved in [[Operation Jedburgh]]. She was agreeable, but SOE vetoed that proposal and ordered her to return to London.<ref>Hewson, p. 230</ref>  \n\nWhen Walters returned to London, she wrote a report (which has not survived) to [[Maurice Buckmaster]], head of the French section of SOE.  Later, in another report, she said that while she was in France Starr had ordered her to be thrown into prison, accused her of having an affair with another agent and of spreading stories that he was having an affair with a female SOE agent.  Walters praised Starr's courage and abilities, but criticized him severely on other counts. Starr, she said, had a Russian bodyguard named Buresie who \"carried out absolutely horrible tortures\" on captured French collaborators. She said Starr was under the influence of his bodyguard and cited several examples of tortures. She added, however, that \"Had [Starr] not been influenced in all this....I am sure that he would never have started it [the tortures].\" <ref>Hewson, pp 231-233</ref> \n\nOn 1 November 1944, Starr, who had returned to London, was interviewed by SOE. He recounted \"with relish\" an incident of torture, causing consternation in the SOE although the interviewers said that he could not be blamed for the tortures committed by the French Resistance.  In February 1945, a court of enquiry with testimony from Starr, Walters, and others took place.  The part of the transcript of the enquiry containing Walter's testimony has disappeared from the record. On 28 February, the conclusion of the \"rather perfunctory court of enquiry\" (in the words of [[M.R.D. Foot]]),<ref>Foot, p. 436</ref> was that \"there is no justification whatever for any imputation against Lt. Col. Starr of inhumanity or cruel treatment to any prisoner at any time under his control or under the control or troops or resistance forces under his immediate command or control.\"<ref>Hewson, p. 235</ref>\n\n==Honours and awards==\nOn 17 July 1945, in recognition of her \"personal courage and willingness to undergo any danger,\" Walters was awarded the [[MBE]] (Civil list) for her work in occupied France<ref name=\"National Archives, Kew, HS 9/339/2\"/> and, from France, the [[Croix de Guerre]] and the [[M\u00e9daille de la Reconnaissance fran\u00e7aise]].<ref>Hewson, p. 236</ref><ref>''Le Batallion de Guerilla de l'Armagnac'' (Amicale du Bataillon de l'Armagnac et A.I.T.I. sarl, 2002), 77</ref>\n\n<center>\n[[File:Order of the British Empire (Civil) Ribbon.png|93px]]\n\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=39-45 Star BAR.svg|width=103}}\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=France and Germany Star BAR.svg|width=103}}\n[[File:Ribbon - Defence Medal.png|x29px]]\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=War Medal 1939\u20131945 (UK) ribbon.png|width=93}}\n\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Croix de Guerre 1939-1945 ribbon.svg|width=103}}\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Medaille de la Resistance ribbon.svg|width=103}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-align=center\n|colspan=4| Member of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (Civil)\n|-align=center\n|[[1939\u20131945 Star]]\n|[[France and Germany Star]]\n|[[Defence Medal (United Kingdom)|Defence Medal]]\n|[[War Medal 1939\u20131945|War Medal]]\n|-align=center\n|colspan=2|[[Croix de guerre 1939\u20131945 (France)|Croix de Guerre (France)]]\n|colspan=2|[[Resistance Medal|M\u00e9daille de la R\u00e9sistance]]\n|}\n</center>\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1946, Walters published an account of her experiences in ''Moondrop to Gascony'' (Macmillan, 1946; [http://www.moho-books.com/moondrop.html Moho Books], 2009). The book provides a portrait of Starr (Le Patron in the book), although not referring directly to the problems between the two of them, and also of Arnault (Jean-Claude in the book) with whom Walters may have been romantically involved.<ref>Walters, ''passim''</ref> ''Moondrop to Gascony'' won the [[John Llewellyn Rhys Prize]] in 1947.\n\nAfter the war, she lived in the United States, Spain, and France and was a translator of Spanish, an editor, and owned a literary agency under her married name '''Anne-Marie Comert.''' In her later years, she suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease]]. She died in France in 1998 at the age of 75.<ref>Hewson, p. 236</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walters, Anne-Marie}}\n[[Category:Female wartime spies]]\n[[Category:Female resistance members of World War II]]\n[[Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire]]\n[[Category:British Special Operations Executive personnel]]\n[[Category:1923 births]]\n[[Category:1998 deaths]]\n[[Category:John Llewellyn Rhys Prize winners]]\n[[Category:Women's Auxiliary Air Force officers]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Croix de Guerre 1939\u20131945 (France)]]\n[[Category:Female recipients of the Croix de Guerre (France)]]\n[[Category:People from Geneva]]\n", "name_user": "Paradoctor", "label": "safe", "comment": "dab", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne-Marie_Walters"}
