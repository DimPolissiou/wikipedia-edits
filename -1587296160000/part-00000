Hot water or steam is produced centrally and then distributed through a network of insulated pipes to high population areas. Houses within a district heating area have heat exchangers installed instead of boilers for their heating and hot water requirements. The heat exchanger keeps the two water systems separate and means that heat can be adjusted as with a familiar domestic boiler. One simple but important innovation in the district heating network was the development of internally insulated pipes. The two pipes taking and receiving the return of water are placed inside a much larger pipe and insulating material is set so as to fill the figure eight shaped void between the two smaller and the large pipe. In 2013 district heating supplied over 60% of all households in Denmark with heating and hot water.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Globalcooperation/the_danish_energy_model.pdf|title=The Danish Energy Model: Innovative, Efficient and Sustainable |publisher=Danish Energy Agency|p=13last=|first=|date=|website= |access-date=19 April 2020 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200210095624/https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Globalcooperation/the_danish_energy_model.pdf |archivedate=10 February 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The development of district heating technology has led Denmark to become a world leader in industrial pump and thermostat designs and its products are used in many industries worldwide.\n\n[[Cogeneration]] is also widely used. This is a process that extracts the waste heat produced when generating electricity. Power stations designed to do this are known as [[Combined Heat and Power Generation|Combined Heat and Power]]<nowiki/> (CHP) stations. CHP stations in Denmark are often sized to provide the heat required for the local district heating system. Thus CHP stations produce both electricity for the grid and heat for district heating systems. Heat can be stored in large industrial hot water tanks for several days allowing electricity and heat supply to be provided time independently from each other. By 2013 the use of CHP stations had reduced the overall energy consumption in Denmark by 11%.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nDanish electricity generation has become increasingly decentralised with a move away from production in the large central power stations to many smaller locally based and mostly CHP stations. Many of these smaller stations use locally sourced bio energy sources including straw and wood pellets.\n\n== Energy consumption and objectives ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Gross energy consumption in Denmark (PJ), 1980\u20132018<ref>Source except where noted: {{cite report |url=https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/energistyrelsen/Nyheder/2015/hovedtal_fra_energistyrelsens_forelobige_energistatistik_for_2015.pdf |title=Key Figures from DEA's Preliminary Energy Statistics 2015 |publisher=[[Danish Energy Agency]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200418222149/https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/energistyrelsen/Nyheder/2015/hovedtal_fra_energistyrelsens_forelobige_energistatistik_for_2015.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2020 |url-status=live |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n|Unit: [[petajoules]] (PJ)\n!'''1980'''\n!'''1990'''\n!'''2000'''\n!'''2005'''\n!'''2010'''\n!'''2012'''\n!'''2013'''\n!'''2014'''\n!'''2015'''<ref name=\"energy statistics 2017\" />\n!'''2016'''<ref>{{cite report |url=https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energy_in_denmark_2016.pdf |title=Energy in Denmark 2016 |publisher=[[Danish Energy Agency]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200131232009/https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energy_in_denmark_2016.pdf |archivedate=31 January 2020 |url-status=live |accessdate=18 April 2020 |p=16}}</ref>\n!'''2017'''<ref name=\"energy statistics 2017\">{{cite report |url=https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energystatistics2017.pdf |title=Energy in Denmark 2017 |publisher=[[Danish Energy Agency]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200418223900/https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energystatistics2017.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2020 |url-status=live |accessdate=18 April 2020 |p=20}}</ref>\n!'''2018'''<ref name=\"energy statistics 2018\">{{cite report |url=https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energyindenmark2018.pdf |title=Energy in Denmark 2018 |publisher=[[Danish Energy Agency]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200418220633/https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energyindenmark2018.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2020 |url-status=live |accessdate=18 April 2020 |p=16}}</ref>\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''814'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''819'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''839'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''850'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''814'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''782'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''763'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''755'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''760'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''770'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''772'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''781'''\n|-\n|Oil\n| align=\"right\" |546\n| align=\"right\" |355\n| align=\"right\" |376\n| align=\"right\" |352\n| align=\"right\" |312\n| align=\"right\" |289\n| align=\"right\" |278\n| align=\"right\" |276\n| align=\"right\" |284\n| align=\"right\" |280\n| align=\"right\" |286\n| align=\"right\" |288\n|-\n|Natural gas\n| align=\"right\" |0\n| align=\"right\" |82\n| align=\"right\" |192\n| align=\"right\" |192\n| align=\"right\" |176\n| align=\"right\" |149\n| align=\"right\" |138\n| align=\"right\" |127\n| align=\"right\" |133\n| align=\"right\" |131\n| align=\"right\" |125\n| align=\"right\" |121\n|-\n|Coal{{efn|name=coke|Including [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] for 1980 and 2015\u20132018.}}\n| align=\"right\" |241\n| align=\"right\" |327\n| align=\"right\" |175\n| align=\"right\" |166\n| align=\"right\" |147\n| align=\"right\" |146\n| align=\"right\" |143\n| align=\"right\" |137\n| align=\"right\" |108\n| align=\"right\" |116\n| align=\"right\" |92\n| align=\"right\" |98\n|-\n|Waste, non-renewable\n| align=\"right\" |5\n| align=\"right\" |8\n| align=\"right\" |14\n| align=\"right\" |17\n| align=\"right\" |16\n| align=\"right\" |17\n| align=\"right\" |17\n| align=\"right\" |18\n| align=\"right\" |18\n| align=\"right\" |18\n| align=\"right\" |18\n| align=\"right\" |18\n|-\n|'''Renewable energy'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''22'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''48'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''81'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''123'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''163'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''180'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''186'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''196'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''219'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''225'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''252'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''257'''\n|}\n\nRenewable-energy consumption increased more than elevenfold from {{convert|22|PJ|TWh}} in 1980 to {{convert|257|PJ|TWh|abbr=on}} in 2018.<ref name=\"energy statistics 2018\" /> Whilst renewable-energy consumption was rising between 1990 and 2013, gross energy consumption fell by 7%.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/energistyrelsen/Publikationer/dk_model_revideret.pdf|title=The Danish Energy Model, Innovative, Efficient and Sustainable.

The next largest share is the transport sector at 33.6%, followed by the electricity sector at 19.8%. Total annual energy consumption is projected to be {{convert|16.4|Mtoe|TWh}} by 2020. In order to meet Denmarks overall target for 30% use of renewable energy in Gross final energy consumption, projected to {{convert|4.9|Mtoe|TWh|abbr=on}}, by 2020 (it was 17% in 2005) targets have been set for each sector. Renewable energy use is expected to be 39.8% in the heating and cooling sector, 51.9% in the electricity sector and 10.1% in the transport sector.\n\nThe energy measures above are gross final energy consumption. Another broader measure, [[primary energy]] consumption also includes energy used in the extraction of fuels (the energy sector) and energy lost in transformation (the transformation sector, i.e. converting heat to electricity in power plants or fuel energy to heat in heating plants) as well as gross final energy consumption for end users. In 2013 Denmark's total final energy consumption was {{convert|607|PJ|TWh}} whilst its primary energy consumption was {{convert|763|PJ|TWh}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/DK_Annual%20Report%202015_en.pdf|title=Denmark's annual reporting under Article 24(1) of the Energy Efficiency Directive|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Most of the approximately 25% difference is accounted for in losses in the transformation sector. These losses are likely to be most prevalent in [[Thermal power station|thermal electricity]] sectors, thus the use of renewable electricity will reduce CO2 emissions and fuels lost in the energy and transformation sectors as well as those in final consumption. Denmark is one of the world's most fuel efficient countries and the difference between the two measures is smaller than many other countries.\n\n== Electricity sector  ==\n\n=== Production by source ===\n{{Pie chart\n | caption=Percentage of electricity generation in Denmark by source in 2017 <ref name=\"2018 report\" />.\n | label1 = [[Wind power|Wind]]\n | value1 = 50.2 | color1 = #00b050\n | label2 = [[Wood fuel|Wood]]\n | value2 = 12.2 | color2 = #602e04\n | label3 = [[Solar power|Solar]]\n | value3 = 2.7 | color3 = #ffc000\n | label4 = [[Waste]]\n | value4 = 2.5 | color4 = #7030a0\n | label5 = [[Straw]]\n | value5 = 1.9 | color5 = #f15a17\n | label6 = [[Biogas]]\n | value6 = 1.9 | color6 = #c00000\n | label7 = [[Hydropower|Hydro]]\n | value7 = 0.1 | color7 = #00b0f0\n | label8 = [[Non-renewable resource|Non Renewable]]\n | value8 = 28.6 | color8 = #000000\n }}\n\nIn 2017 wind was the major source of Denmark's net electricity generation, with 50.2 percent of the total yearly production.

Total renewable electricity generation grew from 10.4 TWh in 2007 to 17.6 TWh by 2014, a rise of 69%. Since 2007 most of the growth in RE electricity generation continues to be the result of growing wind power generation (accounting for +56.9% of total generation growth), thermal generation from RE fuels added an additional 6.5%, Solar power has also made an impact as a new power source of an additional 597 GWh (5.7%) since 2012.\n\n=== Reduction in fossil fuel generated electricity  ===\n[[File:_Net_electricity_generation_from_renewable_and_fossil_fuel_sources_in_Denmark.png|right|459x459px|thumb|Net electricity generation from renewable and fossil fuel sources in Denmark]]\nRenewable energy generation in Denmark increased from 10.4 TWh to 17.6 TWh between 2007 and 2014.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Fossil fuel generation fell from 26.3 TWh in 2007 to 12.4 TWh in 2014.<ref name=\":5\"/><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Electricity generated from renewables first exceeded electricity from fossil fuels in 2012 and again in 2014.\n\nSo how does a country which generates the largest share of its electricity needs from wind power cope on calm windless days? Denmark sees this challenge as an opportunity to develop new solutions and in so doing is transforming its energy sector and upgrading its technological and engineering capability and is now exporting these worldwide. One of the ways the country manages it, is by exporting electricity on days when wind production is very high (Some days Denmark produces more electricity from wind power alone than the entire country requires). Much of the power is exported and stored in Norwegian and Swedish hydroelectric systems via the system of [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped storage]] (storing power for future use by pumping reservoir levels up higher). On calm days the power can be reimported. The country also imports and exports electricity to Germany and across the [[Governance of hydropower in Scandinavia|Nordic region]] which moves power to where it is most in demand given production conditions on each day. As electricity can be transported thousands of kilometres with only a few percentage point transmission losses the load and variability can be spread across a wider and more stable geographic area. These long distance transmission lines are being upgraded across both the Nordic region and more widely across Europe.\n\nThe country has also developed power plants which can increase their output much more rapidly than traditional ones to respond to fluctuating production from wind sources. Many of these plants are the many smaller and dispersed CHP power plants across the country. The production and dispersion of electricity across Denmark, the Nordic region and Germany can be viewed in real time on the Energinet.dk website. The site illustrates wind and power production, electricity imports and exports, and the contribution made by CHP plants to both district heating and stabilising electricity production.

Denmark was the world's leading windpower country in 2014 by percentage of demand coverage at 39% of Danish electricity consumption.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://energinet.dk/EN/KLIMA-OG-MILJOE/Miljoerapportering/VE-produktion/Sider/Vind.aspx|title=Wind power|website=energinet.dk|access-date=2016-05-14}}</ref>\n\nAmbitious plans for future development include increasing production from the 13.1 TWh produced in 2014 to 23.3 TWh by 2024, which would raise demand coverage from 39% to 61% over the period.<ref name=\":8\" /> Offshore and nearshore windpower is expected to grow quicker than land based wind power to reach almost parity with land based production by 2024 (49%).<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nDenmark often produces more electricity from windpower than the entire country requires and will export it for sale or for storage in hydroelectric dams in Norway and Sweden. Occasionally electricity prices turn negative for producers when there is a glut of electricity production and lack of demand abroad as well. One result of this has been the growth of electric boilers being installed in district heating plants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-pages.dk/energinet/126/|title=Wind power to combat climate change|website=www.e-pages.dk|access-date=2016-05-14}}</ref> When there is an excess of electricity the plants can use cheap electricity to heat the hot water instead of finite bio or fossil fuels. As wind production rises the problem of too much electricity being generated will also give rise to new challenges and solutions. Electric heating and cooling can also be used in the form of more efficient [[heat pump]]s to mop up excess electricity supply.

Overall about 2.6% of national electricity was generated by RE generation from waste.<ref name=\":103\"/> Denmark incinerates close to 3 million tonnes of waste each year to produce electricity and heat, most of it is produced domestically with a smaller share imported from abroad. There are 28 waste incineration plants in the country. The waste powered CHP plants may also co burn additional fossil fuels, including oil and natural gas, but increasingly biomass is used to improve the performance of waste energy production.

The largest source of [[Biogas]] is from manure, other sources include water treatment plants and landfill sites. Many of the smaller plants are located on farms and or other sources of biogas. Smaller biogas plants tend not to contribute heat to district heating networks. Denmark intends to increase production and use of biogas from {{convert|4|PJ|TWh}} consumption in 2015 to {{convert|17|PJ|TWh}} by 2020 with the goal of using 50% of manure in the country.<ref name=\":103\"/> Most of the new biogas is likely to be injected directly into the gas system and used for industry and transport.\n\n'''Biomass.'''\n\n[[Biomass]] provides the largest share of renewable energy in Denmark when considering the electricity sector, heating and cooling sector and transport sector combined.

Hot water or steam is produced centrally and then distributed through a network of insulated pipes to high population areas. Houses within a district heating area have heat exchangers installed instead of boilers for their heating and hot water requirements. The heat exchanger keeps the two water systems separate and means that heat can be adjusted as with a familiar domestic boiler. One simple but important innovation in the district heating network was the development of internally insulated pipes. The two pipes taking and receiving the return of water are placed inside a much larger pipe and insulating material is set so as to fill the figure eight shaped void between the two smaller and the large pipe. In 2013 district heating supplied over 60% of all households in Denmark with heating and hot water.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://stateofgreen.com/files/download/1401|title=pg.13, The Danish Energy Model, Innovative, Efficient and Sustainable.

This is a process that extracts the waste heat produced when generating electricity. Power stations designed to do this are known as [[Combined Heat and Power Generation|Combined Heat and Power]]<nowiki/> (CHP) stations. CHP stations in Denmark are often sized to provide the heat required for the local district heating system. Thus CHP stations produce both electricity for the grid and heat for district heating systems. Heat can be stored in large industrial hot water tanks for several days allowing electricity and heat supply to be provided time independently from each other. By 2013 the use of CHP stations had reduced the overall energy consumption in Denmark by 11%.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nDanish electricity generation has become increasingly decentralised with a move away from production in the large central power stations to many smaller locally based and mostly CHP stations. Many of these smaller stations use locally sourced bio energy sources including straw and wood pellets.\n\n== Energy consumption and objectives ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Gross energy consumption in Denmark (PJ), 1980\u20132018<ref>Source except where noted: {{cite report |url=https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/energistyrelsen/Nyheder/2015/hovedtal_fra_energistyrelsens_forelobige_energistatistik_for_2015.pdf |title=Key Figures from DEA's Preliminary Energy Statistics 2015 |publisher=[[Danish Energy Agency]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200418222149/https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/energistyrelsen/Nyheder/2015/hovedtal_fra_energistyrelsens_forelobige_energistatistik_for_2015.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2020 |url-status=live |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n|Unit: [[petajoules]] (PJ)\n!'''1980'''\n!'''1990'''\n!'''2000'''\n!'''2005'''\n!'''2010'''\n!'''2012'''\n!'''2013'''\n!'''2014'''\n!'''2015'''<ref name=\"energy statistics 2017\" />\n!'''2016'''<ref>{{cite report |url=https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energy_in_denmark_2016.pdf |title=Energy in Denmark 2016 |publisher=[[Danish Energy Agency]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200131232009/https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energy_in_denmark_2016.pdf |archivedate=31 January 2020 |url-status=live |accessdate=18 April 2020 |p=16}}</ref>\n!'''2017'''<ref name=\"energy statistics 2017\">{{cite report |url=https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energystatistics2017.pdf |title=Energy in Denmark 2017 |publisher=[[Danish Energy Agency]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200418223900/https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energystatistics2017.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2020 |url-status=live |accessdate=18 April 2020 |p=20}}</ref>\n!'''2018'''<ref name=\"energy statistics 2018\">{{cite report |url=https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energyindenmark2018.pdf |title=Energy in Denmark 2018 |publisher=[[Danish Energy Agency]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200418220633/https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Statistik/energyindenmark2018.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2020 |url-status=live |accessdate=18 April 2020 |p=16}}</ref>\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''814'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''819'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''839'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''850'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''814'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''782'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''763'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''755'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''760'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''770'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''772'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''781'''\n|-\n|Oil\n| align=\"right\" |546\n| align=\"right\" |355\n| align=\"right\" |376\n| align=\"right\" |352\n| align=\"right\" |312\n| align=\"right\" |289\n| align=\"right\" |278\n| align=\"right\" |276\n| align=\"right\" |284\n| align=\"right\" |280\n| align=\"right\" |286\n| align=\"right\" |288\n|-\n|Natural gas\n| align=\"right\" |0\n| align=\"right\" |82\n| align=\"right\" |192\n| align=\"right\" |192\n| align=\"right\" |176\n| align=\"right\" |149\n| align=\"right\" |138\n| align=\"right\" |127\n| align=\"right\" |133\n| align=\"right\" |131\n| align=\"right\" |125\n| align=\"right\" |121\n|-\n|Coal{{efn|name=coke|Including [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] for 1980 and 2015\u20132018.}}\n| align=\"right\" |241\n| align=\"right\" |327\n| align=\"right\" |175\n| align=\"right\" |166\n| align=\"right\" |147\n| align=\"right\" |146\n| align=\"right\" |143\n| align=\"right\" |137\n| align=\"right\" |108\n| align=\"right\" |116\n| align=\"right\" |92\n| align=\"right\" |98\n|-\n|Waste, non-renewable\n| align=\"right\" |5\n| align=\"right\" |8\n| align=\"right\" |14\n| align=\"right\" |17\n| align=\"right\" |16\n| align=\"right\" |17\n| align=\"right\" |17\n| align=\"right\" |18\n| align=\"right\" |18\n| align=\"right\" |18\n| align=\"right\" |18\n| align=\"right\" |18\n|-\n|'''Renewable energy'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''22'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''48'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''81'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''123'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''163'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''180'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''186'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''196'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''219'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''225'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''252'''\n| align=\"right\" |'''257'''\n|}\n\nRenewable-energy consumption increased more than elevenfold from {{convert|22|PJ|TWh}} in 1980 to {{convert|257|PJ|TWh|abbr=on}} in 2018.<ref name=\"energy statistics 2018\" /> Whilst renewable-energy consumption was rising between 1990 and 2013, gross energy consumption fell by 7%.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/energistyrelsen/Publikationer/dk_model_revideret.pdf|title=The Danish Energy Model, Innovative, Efficient and Sustainable.

The heating and cooling sector (also known as the thermal sector) includes domestic heating and air conditioning, industrial processes such as furnaces and any use of heat generally. The next largest share is the transport sector at 33.6%, followed by the electricity sector at 19.8%. Total annual energy consumption is projected to be {{convert|16.4|Mtoe|TWh}} by 2020. In order to meet Denmarks overall target for 30% use of renewable energy in Gross final energy consumption, projected to {{convert|4.9|Mtoe|TWh|abbr=on}}, by 2020 (it was 17% in 2005) targets have been set for each sector. Renewable energy use is expected to be 39.8% in the heating and cooling sector, 51.9% in the electricity sector and 10.1% in the transport sector.\n\nThe energy measures above are gross final energy consumption. Another broader measure, [[primary energy]] consumption also includes energy used in the extraction of fuels (the energy sector) and energy lost in transformation (the transformation sector, i.e. converting heat to electricity in power plants or fuel energy to heat in heating plants) as well as gross final energy consumption for end users. In 2013 Denmark's total final energy consumption was {{convert|607|PJ|TWh}} whilst its primary energy consumption was {{convert|763|PJ|TWh}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/DK_Annual%20Report%202015_en.pdf|title=Denmark's annual reporting under Article 24(1) of the Energy Efficiency Directive|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Most of the approximately 25% difference is accounted for in losses in the transformation sector. These losses are likely to be most prevalent in [[Thermal power station|thermal electricity]] sectors, thus the use of renewable electricity will reduce CO2 emissions and fuels lost in the energy and transformation sectors as well as those in final consumption. Denmark is one of the world's most fuel efficient countries and the difference between the two measures is smaller than many other countries.\n\n== Electricity sector  ==\n\n=== Production by source ===\n{{Pie chart\n | caption=Percentage of electricity generation in Denmark by source in 2017 <ref name=\"2018 report\" />.\n | label1 = [[Wind power|Wind]]\n | value1 = 50.2 | color1 = #00b050\n | label2 = [[Wood fuel|Wood]]\n | value2 = 12.2 | color2 = #602e04\n | label3 = [[Solar power|Solar]]\n | value3 = 2.7 | color3 = #ffc000\n | label4 = [[Waste]]\n | value4 = 2.5 | color4 = #7030a0\n | label5 = [[Straw]]\n | value5 = 1.9 | color5 = #f15a17\n | label6 = [[Biogas]]\n | value6 = 1.9 | color6 = #c00000\n | label7 = [[Hydropower|Hydro]]\n | value7 = 0.1 | color7 = #00b0f0\n | label8 = [[Non-renewable resource|Non Renewable]]\n | value8 = 28.6 | color8 = #000000\n }}\n\nIn 2017 wind was the major source of Denmark's net electricity generation, with 50.2 percent of the total yearly production.

Total renewable electricity generation grew from 10.4 TWh in 2007 to 17.6 TWh by 2014, a rise of 69%. Since 2007 most of the growth in RE electricity generation continues to be the result of growing wind power generation (accounting for +56.9% of total generation growth), thermal generation from RE fuels added an additional 6.5%, Solar power has also made an impact as a new power source of an additional 597 GWh (5.7%) since 2012.\n\n=== Reduction in fossil fuel generated electricity  ===\n[[File:_Net_electricity_generation_from_renewable_and_fossil_fuel_sources_in_Denmark.png|right|459x459px|thumb|Net electricity generation from renewable and fossil fuel sources in Denmark]]\nRenewable energy generation in Denmark increased from 10.4 TWh to 17.6 TWh between 2007 and 2014.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Fossil fuel generation fell from 26.3 TWh in 2007 to 12.4 TWh in 2014.<ref name=\":5\"/><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Electricity generated from renewables first exceeded electricity from fossil fuels in 2012 and again in 2014.\n\nSo how does a country which generates the largest share of its electricity needs from wind power cope on calm windless days? Denmark sees this challenge as an opportunity to develop new solutions and in so doing is transforming its energy sector and upgrading its technological and engineering capability and is now exporting these worldwide. One of the ways the country manages it, is by exporting electricity on days when wind production is very high (Some days Denmark produces more electricity from wind power alone than the entire country requires). Much of the power is exported and stored in Norwegian and Swedish hydroelectric systems via the system of [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped storage]] (storing power for future use by pumping reservoir levels up higher). On calm days the power can be reimported. The country also imports and exports electricity to Germany and across the [[Governance of hydropower in Scandinavia|Nordic region]] which moves power to where it is most in demand given production conditions on each day. As electricity can be transported thousands of kilometres with only a few percentage point transmission losses the load and variability can be spread across a wider and more stable geographic area. These long distance transmission lines are being upgraded across both the Nordic region and more widely across Europe.\n\nThe country has also developed power plants which can increase their output much more rapidly than traditional ones to respond to fluctuating production from wind sources. Many of these plants are the many smaller and dispersed CHP power plants across the country. The production and dispersion of electricity across Denmark, the Nordic region and Germany can be viewed in real time on the Energinet.dk website.

Occasionally electricity prices turn negative for producers when there is a glut of electricity production and lack of demand abroad as well. One result of this has been the growth of electric boilers being installed in district heating plants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-pages.dk/energinet/126/|title=Wind power to combat climate change|website=www.e-pages.dk|access-date=2016-05-14}}</ref> When there is an excess of electricity the plants can use cheap electricity to heat the hot water instead of finite bio or fossil fuels. As wind production rises the problem of too much electricity being generated will also give rise to new challenges and solutions. Electric heating and cooling can also be used in the form of more efficient [[heat pump]]s to mop up excess electricity supply.

[[Jacques Lacan]]'s ''Ecrits: A Selection'' includes an essay titled ''The Signification of the Phallus'' in which sexual differentiation is represented in terms of the difference between \"being\" and \"having\" the phallus, which for Lacan is the transcendent signifier of desire. Men are positioned as men insofar as they wish to ''have'' the phallus. Women, on the other hand, wish to ''be'' the phallus.  This difference between having and being explains some tragicomic aspects of sexual life.  Once a woman becomes, in the realm of the signifier, the phallus the man wants, he ceases to want it, because one cannot desire what one has, and the man may be drawn to other women. Similarly, though, for the woman, the gift of the phallus deprives the man of what he has, and thereby diminishes her desire.\n\nIn ''Gender Trouble'', [[Judith Butler]] explores Freud's and Lacan's discussions of the symbolic phallus by pointing out the connection between the phallus and the penis. She writes, \"The law requires conformity to its own notion of 'nature'. It gains its legitimacy through the binary and asymmetrical naturalization of bodies in which the phallus, though clearly not identical to the penis, deploys the penis as its naturalized instrument and sign\". In ''Bodies that Matter'', she further explores the possibilities for the phallus in her discussion of ''The Lesbian Phallus''. If, as she notes, Freud enumerates a set of analogies and substitutions that rhetorically affirm the fundamental transferability of the phallus from the penis elsewhere, then any number of other things might come to stand in for the phallus.\n\n==Modern use of the phallus==\nThe phallus is often used to advertise [[pornography]], as well as the sale of [[contraception]].

Barkin (voiced by [[Burt Reynolds]]), a German Shepherd that is murdered by his former friend, Carface Carruthers (voiced by [[Vic Tayback]], in his penultimate film role), but withdraws from his place in Heaven to return to Earth, where his best friend, Itchy Itchiford (voiced by [[Dom DeLuise]]), still lives, and they team up with a young orphan girl named Anne-Marie (voiced by [[Judith Barsi]] in her last film role), who teaches them an important lesson about kindness, friendship and love.\n\nThe film is an Irish, British and American venture, produced by [[Goldcrest Films]] and [[Sullivan Bluth Studios|Sullivan Bluth Studios Ireland Ltd.]]. On its cinema release, it competed directly with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]]'s ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', released on the same day. While it did not repeat the box-office success of Sullivan Bluth's previous feature films, ''[[An American Tail]]'' and ''[[The Land Before Time]]'', it was successful on home video, becoming one of the biggest-selling [[VHS]] releases ever. It inspired a [[All Dogs Go to Heaven 2|theatrical sequel]], a [[All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series|television series]], and a [[An All Dogs Christmas Carol|holiday direct-to-video film]].\n\n''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was released on [[DVD]] on November 17, 1998, and as an [[MGM Kids]] edition on March 6, 2001. It had a DVD double-feature release with its sequel on March 14, 2006, and January 18, 2011. The film was released in high definition for the first time on Blu-ray on March 29, 2011, without special features except the original theatrical trailer.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\nIn 1939 [[New Orleans]], Charlie B. Barkin and his best friend Itchy Itchiford escape from the [[Animal shelter|dog pound]] and return to their [[casino]] [[riverboat]] on the [[bayou]], formerly run by Charlie himself and his business partner, Carface Caruthers. Refusing to share the profits with Charlie, Carface had been responsible for Charlie and Itchy getting committed to the pound and persuades Charlie to leave town with half of the casino's earnings. Charlie agrees, but is later [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]] and killed by a car pushed downhill by Carface and his assistant, Killer. Charlie is sent to [[Heaven]] by default despite not having done any good deeds in his life; a [[whippet]] [[angel]] explains to him that because dogs are inherently good and loyal, all dogs go to Heaven and are entitled to paradise. Charlie cheats death by stealing a [[gold]] [[pocket watch]] representing his life and winding it back. As Charlie descends back to Earth, the whippet angel tells him that he can never return to Heaven; when the watch stops again, he will be sent to [[Hell]] instead. However, as long as the watch continues to run, Charlie will be immortal.\n\nAfter Charlie reunites with Itchy and plots revenge in the form of a rivaling business, they discover that Carface has kidnapped a young orphaned girl named Anne-Marie for her ability to talk to animals, which proves advantageous when betting on races. Charlie rescues her and promises to feed the [[Poverty|poor]] and help her find a family. The next day at the race track, Charlie steals a wallet from a couple as they talk to Anne-Marie and become alarmed by her ragged appearance. Charlie and Itchy use their winnings to build a successful casino in the junkyard where they live. Anne-Marie, upon realizing that she has been used, threatens to leave. To persuade her to stay, Charlie brings [[pizza]] to a family of poor puppies and their mother, Flo, at the old abandoned church. While there, Anne-Marie becomes angry at Charlie for stealing the wallet. As Charlie has a nightmare in which he is condemned to Hell, Anne-Marie returns the wallet to the couple, Kate and Harold. While they privately discuss adopting her, Charlie arrives and tricks her into leaving with him. Charlie and Anne-Marie narrowly escape an ambush by Carface and Killer and hide in an abandoned building, but the ground breaks and they fall into the lair of King Gator, a giant effeminate [[alligator]]. He and Charlie bond over a love of music and he lets them go, but Anne-Marie contracts [[pneumonia]].\n\nCarface and his thugs destroy Charlie's casino and attack Itchy. An injured Itchy limps back to the church and confronts Charlie about his relationship with Anne-Marie, who Itchy thinks matters more than him. In his exasperation, Charlie loudly proclaims that he is using her and will eventually \"dump her in an orphanage\". Anne-Marie overhears the conversation and tearfully runs away before she is kidnapped by Carface. Charlie follows them to Carface's casino, where he is ambushed by Carface and his thugs. They fight with Charlie, inadvertently setting an oil fire that soon engulfs the whole structure. Charlie's pained howls from their bites summon King Gator, who chases down and devours Carface. In the chaos, both Anne-Marie and the watch fall into the water. Unable to rescue both at the same time, Charlie rescues Anne-Marie and places her onto some driftwood and pushes her toward safety; however, the watch stops before he can reach it, ending his life. Sometime later, Kate and Harold adopt Anne-Marie, who has also adopted Itchy. Charlie, having sacrificed himself to save Anne-Marie, has earned back his place in Heaven, and is allowed to return in [[ghost]] form to reconcile with Anne-Marie. Leaving Itchy in her care, Charlie returns to Heaven, where Carface finally arrives and takes his own clock, vowing revenge against King Gator. As the whippet angel chases him and warns against using it, Charlie assures the audience that \"he'll be back\" before winking and retrieving his halo.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Charlie B. Barkin, a brash [[German Shepherd]] and a former [[Confidence trick|con artist]]. The character was designed specifically with Reynolds in mind for the role and the animators mimicked some of his mannerisms.\n** Reynolds is succeeded by [[Charlie Sheen]] for ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven 2]]'', and [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]] for ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series]]'' and ''[[An All Dogs Christmas Carol]]''. The model for the character of Charlie was a German Shepherd, appropriately named Burt. Burt the dog often spent time with the animators at the studio, even going with them during the studio's move to [[Ireland]].\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Itchy Itchiford, a [[Paranoia|paranoid]], [[Anxiety|anxious]] but loyal [[Dachshund]].\n** DeLuise reprised his role in ''All Dogs Go to Heaven 2'', the series and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol''.\n* [[Judith Barsi]] as Anne-Marie, a 7-year-old orphan girl with the [[Animal language|ability to talk to and understand animals]]. Her singing voice was performed by Anaida R. Garcia. This was Barsi's final film role before her murder in 1988. The ending credits song \"Love Survives\" was dedicated in her memory as her character became absent in the further franchise.\n* [[Vic Tayback]] as Carface Caruthers, a violent, [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] mixed blue-nosed [[American Pit Bull Terrier]]/[[Bulldog]] gangster. This was Tayback's final film role before his death in 1990. For ''All Dogs Go to Heaven 2'', ''All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series'' and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol'', [[Ernest Borgnine]] took Tayback's role.\n* [[Charles Nelson Reilly]] as Killer, a misnamed, fidgety, [[Neurosis|neurotic]] and spectacles-wearing [[Schnoodle]] who is Carface's [[comic relief]] sidekick. Reilly was the second original voice actor that reprised his role in the series and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol'' except for the sequel.\n* [[Loni Anderson]] as Flo, a female [[Rough Collie]] and Charlie's friend.\n* [[Melba Moore]] as a [[Whippet]] angel who welcomes deceased dogs into Heaven. She was named \"Annabelle\" in the 1996 sequel and its subsequent syndicated television series. [[Bebe Neuwirth]] succeeded Melba in this role.  \n* [[Ken Page]] as King Gator, an [[American alligator]] and [[New Orleans voodoo|voodoo]] [[witch doctor]] living below the streets of [[New Orleans]].\n* Rob Fuller and Earleen Carey as Kate and Harold, a married couple who later become Anne-Marie's adoptive parents.\n* [[Godfrey Quigley]] as [[Terrier]], a dog that appears when Itchy tells everyone Anne-Marie is in danger.\n* [[Anna Manahan]] as Stella Dallas, a horse that appears when Anne-Marie, Charlie, and Itchy are at the derby. She is against the Once Upon a Wintertime Team. \n* [[Candy Devine]] as Vera, a female gambling dog.\n\n==Production==\nThe earliest idea for the film was conceived by Don Bluth after finishing work on ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]''. The [[film treatment|treatment]] was originally about a canine [[private investigator|private eye]], and one of three short stories making up an [[anthology film]]. The character of a shaggy German Shepherd was designed specifically for Burt Reynolds. However, Bluth's first studio, [[Don Bluth Productions]], was going through a period of financial difficulty, ultimately having to declare bankruptcy, and the idea never made it beyond rough storyboards. The concept was revived by Bluth, [[John Pomeroy]] and [[Gary Goldman]], and rewritten by [[David N. Weiss]], collaborating with the producers from October through December 1987. They built around the title ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' and drew inspiration from films, such as ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', ''[[Little Miss Marker]]'' and ''[[A Guy Named Joe]]''. The film's title came from a book read to Bluth's fourth-grade class, and he resisted suggestions to change it, stating he liked how \"provocative\" it sounded, and how people reacted to the title alone.\n\nDuring the production of their previous feature film, Sullivan Bluth Studios had moved from [[Van Nuys, California]], to a state-of-the-art studio facility in [[Dublin]], Ireland, and the film was their first to begin production wholly at the Irish studio. It was also their first to be funded from sources outside of Hollywood, the previous two feature films, ''[[An American Tail]]'' and ''[[The Land Before Time]]'', had been backed by [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[Universal Pictures]], and executive producers [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[George Lucas]] (for ''The Land Before Time'' only) exercised a degree of control over the content of the films, a situation Bluth found disagreeable.<ref name=\"cawley_tail\">{{cite web |author=Cawley, John |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBtail.html |title=Don Bluth American Tail |publisher=The Animated Films of Don Bluth |accessdate=October 20, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"cawley_land\">Cawley, ''[http://www.cataroo.com/DBland.html The Land Before Time]''</ref> The studio found investment from UK-based Goldcrest Films in a US$70m deal to produce three animated feature films (though only two, ''[[Rock-a-Doodle]]'' and it, were completed under the deal).<ref name=\"cawley_ireland\">Cawley, ''[http://www.cataroo.com/DBireland.html At Home in Ireland]''</ref> The three founding members of the studio, Bluth, Pomeroy, and Goldman, had all moved to Ireland to set up the new facility, but during the film's production, John Pomeroy returned to the U.S. to head up a satellite studio which provided some of the animation for the film. Pomeroy also used his presence in the U.S. to generate early publicity for the film, including a presentation at the 1987 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\">{{cite web |author=Cawley, John |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBdogs.html |title=Don Bluth All Dogs Heaven |accessdate=October 20, 2015 |publisher=The Animated Films of Don Bluth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103084802/http://www.cataroo.com/DBdogs.html |archive-date=2014-01-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe film's lead voices, Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, had previously appeared together in five films. For this one, they requested them to record their parts in the studio together (in American animation, actors more commonly record their parts solo). Bluth agreed and allowed Reynolds and DeLuise to [[ad-lib]] extensively; Bluth later commented, \"their ad-libs were often better than the original script\".<ref name=\"beck\">*{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck|url-access=registration|date=October 2005|publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=1-55652-591-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/13 13\u201314]}} p.14</ref> However, Reynolds was more complimentary of the draft, warmly quipping, \"Great script, kid\", as he left the studio. Another pair of voices, those of Carface and Killer (Vic Tayback and Charles Nelson Reilly, respectively), also recorded together. Loni Anderson, who voices Flo, was Reynolds' then-wife.<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\" /> Child actress Judith Barsi, who voiced [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Ducky|Ducky]] in Bluth's previous film ''The Land Before Time'', was selected to voice Anne-Marie; she was killed in an apparent murder-suicide over a year before ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was released.<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\" />\n\nAs production neared completion, the studio held test screenings and decided that some of the scenes were too intense for younger viewers. Writer and producer Pomeroy decided to shorten Charlie's nightmare about being [[Damnation|condemned]]. Co-director Gary Goldman also agreed to the cut, recognizing that the concession needed to be made in the name of commercial appeal. Don Bluth owned a private 35-mm print of the movie with the cut-out scenes and planned to convince Goldcrest Films on releasing a director's cut of the film after returning from Ireland in the mid-1990s, but the print was eventually stolen from Bluth's locked storage room, diminishing hopes of this version being released on home media (though the cut-out scenes of Charlie's nightmare about being condemned was discovered by [[YouTube]] on October 29, 2016, therefore ''The Land Before Time'' was not included the cut-out scenes (due to being produced by Amblin Entertainment).<ref name=\"Ask Us Questions at donbluth.com\">Ask Us Questions at [donbluth.com]</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = All Dogs Go to Heaven Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = July 1, 1989<ref name=Amazon>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/All-Dogs-Heaven-Various-artists/dp/B00R4PB5E4 |title=All Dogs Go To Heaven: Various artists |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=October 20, 2015}}</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     = 33:18\n| label      = [[Curb Records]]\n| producer   = [[Ralph Burns]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = Don Bluth Music of Films\n | type       = soundtrack\n | prev_title = [[The Land Before Time]]\n | prev_year  = 1988\n | title      = All Dogs Go to Heaven\n | year       = 1989\n | next_title = [[Rock-a-Doodle]]\n | next_year  = 1992\n}}\n}}\n\nThe music for ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was composed by [[Ralph Burns]] with lyrics by [[Charles Strouse]], T.J.

Charles Nelson Reilly declined to return for the sequel film, but voiced Killer for the television productions.

Barkin (voiced by [[Burt Reynolds]]), a German Shepherd that is murdered by his former friend, Carface Carruthers (voiced by [[Vic Tayback]], in his penultimate film role), but withdraws from his place in Heaven to return to Earth, where his best friend, Itchy Itchiford (voiced by [[Dom DeLuise]]), still lives, and they team up with a young orphan girl named Anne-Marie (voiced by [[Judith Barsi]] in her last film role), who teaches them an important lesson about kindness, friendship and love.\n\nThe film is an Irish, British and American venture, produced by [[Goldcrest Films]] and [[Sullivan Bluth Studios|Sullivan Bluth Studios Ireland Ltd.]]. On its cinema release, it competed directly with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]]'s ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', released on the same day. While it did not repeat the box-office success of Sullivan Bluth's previous feature films, ''[[An American Tail]]'' and ''[[The Land Before Time]]'', it was successful on home video, becoming one of the biggest-selling [[VHS]] releases ever. It inspired a [[All Dogs Go to Heaven 2|theatrical sequel]], a [[All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series|television series]], and a [[An All Dogs Christmas Carol|holiday direct-to-video film]].\n\n''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was released on [[DVD]] on November 17, 1998, and as an [[MGM Kids]] edition on March 6, 2001. It had a DVD double-feature release with its sequel on March 14, 2006, and January 18, 2011. The film was released in high definition for the first time on Blu-ray on March 29, 2011, without special features except the original theatrical trailer.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\nIn 1939 [[New Orleans]], Charlie B. Barkin and his best friend Itchy Itchiford escape from the [[Animal shelter|dog pound]] and return to their [[casino]] [[riverboat]] on the [[bayou]], formerly run by Charlie himself and his business partner, Carface Caruthers. Refusing to share the profits with Charlie, Carface had been responsible for Charlie and Itchy getting committed to the pound and persuades Charlie to leave town with half of the casino's earnings. Charlie agrees, but is later [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]] and killed by a car pushed downhill by Carface and his assistant, Killer. Charlie is sent to [[Heaven]] by default despite not having done any good deeds in his life; a [[whippet]] [[angel]] explains to him that because dogs are inherently good and loyal, all dogs go to Heaven and are entitled to paradise. Charlie cheats death by stealing a [[gold]] [[pocket watch]] representing his life and winding it back. As Charlie descends back to Earth, the whippet angel tells him that he can never return to Heaven; when the watch stops again, he will be sent to [[Hell]] instead. However, as long as the watch continues to run, Charlie will be immortal.\n\nAfter Charlie reunites with Itchy and plots revenge in the form of a rivaling business, they discover that Carface has kidnapped a young orphaned girl named Anne-Marie for her ability to talk to animals, which proves advantageous when betting on races. Charlie rescues her and promises to feed the [[Poverty|poor]] and help her find a family. The next day at the race track, Charlie steals a wallet from a couple as they talk to Anne-Marie and become alarmed by her ragged appearance. Charlie and Itchy use their winnings to build a successful casino in the junkyard where they live. Anne-Marie, upon realizing that she has been used, threatens to leave. To persuade her to stay, Charlie brings [[pizza]] to a family of poor puppies and their mother, Flo, at the old abandoned church. While there, Anne-Marie becomes angry at Charlie for stealing the wallet. As Charlie has a nightmare in which he is condemned to Hell, Anne-Marie returns the wallet to the couple, Kate and Harold. While they privately discuss adopting her, Charlie arrives and tricks her into leaving with him. Charlie and Anne-Marie narrowly escape an ambush by Carface and Killer and hide in an abandoned building, but the ground breaks and they fall into the lair of King Gator, a giant effeminate [[alligator]]. He and Charlie bond over a love of music and he lets them go, but Anne-Marie contracts [[pneumonia]].\n\nCarface and his thugs destroy Charlie's casino and attack Itchy. An injured Itchy limps back to the church and confronts Charlie about his relationship with Anne-Marie, who Itchy thinks matters more than him. In his exasperation, Charlie loudly proclaims that he is using her and will eventually \"dump her in an orphanage\". Anne-Marie overhears the conversation and tearfully runs away before she is kidnapped by Carface. Charlie follows them to Carface's casino, where he is ambushed by Carface and his thugs. They fight with Charlie, inadvertently setting an oil fire that soon engulfs the whole structure. Charlie's pained howls from their bites summon King Gator, who chases down and devours Carface. In the chaos, both Anne-Marie and the watch fall into the water. Unable to rescue both at the same time, Charlie rescues Anne-Marie and places her onto some driftwood and pushes her toward safety; however, the watch stops before he can reach it, ending his life. Sometime later, Kate and Harold adopt Anne-Marie, who has also adopted Itchy. Charlie, having sacrificed himself to save Anne-Marie, has earned back his place in Heaven, and is allowed to return in [[ghost]] form to reconcile with Anne-Marie. Leaving Itchy in her care, Charlie returns to Heaven, where Carface finally arrives and takes his own clock, vowing revenge against King Gator. As the whippet angel chases him and warns against using it, Charlie assures the audience that \"he'll be back\" before winking and retrieving his halo.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Charlie B. Barkin, a brash [[German Shepherd]] and a former [[Confidence trick|con artist]]. The character was designed specifically with Reynolds in mind for the role and the animators mimicked some of his mannerisms.\n** Reynolds is succeeded by [[Charlie Sheen]] for ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven 2]]'', and [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]] for ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series]]'' and ''[[An All Dogs Christmas Carol]]''. The model for the character of Charlie was a German Shepherd, appropriately named Burt. Burt the dog often spent time with the animators at the studio, even going with them during the studio's move to [[Ireland]].\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Itchy Itchiford, a [[Paranoia|paranoid]], [[Anxiety|anxious]] but loyal [[Dachshund]].\n** DeLuise reprised his role in ''All Dogs Go to Heaven 2'', the series and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol''.\n* [[Judith Barsi]] as Anne-Marie, a 7-year-old orphan girl with the [[Animal language|ability to talk to and understand animals]]. Her singing voice was performed by Anaida R. Garcia. This was Barsi's final film role before her murder in 1988. The ending credits song \"Love Survives\" was dedicated in her memory as her character became absent in the further franchise.\n* [[Vic Tayback]] as Carface Caruthers, a violent, [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] mixed blue-nosed [[American Pit Bull Terrier]]/[[Bulldog]] gangster. This was Tayback's final film role before his death in 1990. For ''All Dogs Go to Heaven 2'', ''All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series'' and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol'', [[Ernest Borgnine]] took Tayback's role.\n* [[Charles Nelson Reilly]] as Killer, a misnamed, fidgety, [[Neurosis|neurotic]] and spectacles-wearing [[Schnoodle]] who is Carface's [[comic relief]] sidekick. Reilly was the second original voice actor that reprised his role in the series and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol'' except for the sequel.\n* [[Loni Anderson]] as Flo, a female [[Rough Collie]] and Charlie's friend.\n* [[Melba Moore]] as a [[Whippet]] angel who welcomes deceased dogs into Heaven. She was named \"Annabelle\" in the 1996 sequel and its subsequent syndicated television series. [[Bebe Neuwirth]] succeeded Melba in this role.  \n* [[Ken Page]] as King Gator, an [[American alligator]] and [[New Orleans voodoo|voodoo]] [[witch doctor]] living below the streets of [[New Orleans]].\n* Rob Fuller and Earleen Carey as Kate and Harold, a married couple who later become Anne-Marie's adoptive parents.\n* [[Godfrey Quigley]] as [[Terrier]], a dog that appears when Itchy tells everyone Anne-Marie is in danger.\n* [[Anna Manahan]] as Stella Dallas, a horse that appears when Anne-Marie, Charlie, and Itchy are at the derby. She is against the Once Upon a Wintertime Team. \n* [[Candy Devine]] as Vera, a female gambling dog.\n\n==Production==\nThe earliest idea for the film was conceived by Don Bluth after finishing work on ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]''. The [[film treatment|treatment]] was originally about a canine [[private investigator|private eye]], and one of three short stories making up an [[anthology film]]. The character of a shaggy German Shepherd was designed specifically for Burt Reynolds. However, Bluth's first studio, [[Don Bluth Productions]], was going through a period of financial difficulty, ultimately having to declare bankruptcy, and the idea never made it beyond rough storyboards. The concept was revived by Bluth, [[John Pomeroy]] and [[Gary Goldman]], and rewritten by [[David N. Weiss]], collaborating with the producers from October through December 1987. They built around the title ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' and drew inspiration from films, such as ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', ''[[Little Miss Marker]]'' and ''[[A Guy Named Joe]]''. The film's title came from a book read to Bluth's fourth-grade class, and he resisted suggestions to change it, stating he liked how \"provocative\" it sounded, and how people reacted to the title alone.\n\nDuring the production of their previous feature film, Sullivan Bluth Studios had moved from [[Van Nuys, California]], to a state-of-the-art studio facility in [[Dublin]], Ireland, and the film was their first to begin production wholly at the Irish studio. It was also their first to be funded from sources outside of Hollywood, the previous two feature films, ''[[An American Tail]]'' and ''[[The Land Before Time]]'', had been backed by [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[Universal Pictures]], and executive producers [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[George Lucas]] (for ''The Land Before Time'' only) exercised a degree of control over the content of the films, a situation Bluth found disagreeable.<ref name=\"cawley_tail\">{{cite web |author=Cawley, John |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBtail.html |title=Don Bluth American Tail |publisher=The Animated Films of Don Bluth |accessdate=October 20, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"cawley_land\">Cawley, ''[http://www.cataroo.com/DBland.html The Land Before Time]''</ref> The studio found investment from UK-based Goldcrest Films in a US$70m deal to produce three animated feature films (though only two, ''[[Rock-a-Doodle]]'' and it, were completed under the deal).<ref name=\"cawley_ireland\">Cawley, ''[http://www.cataroo.com/DBireland.html At Home in Ireland]''</ref> The three founding members of the studio, Bluth, Pomeroy, and Goldman, had all moved to Ireland to set up the new facility, but during the film's production, John Pomeroy returned to the U.S. to head up a satellite studio which provided some of the animation for the film. Pomeroy also used his presence in the U.S. to generate early publicity for the film, including a presentation at the 1987 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\">{{cite web |author=Cawley, John |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBdogs.html |title=Don Bluth All Dogs Heaven |accessdate=October 20, 2015 |publisher=The Animated Films of Don Bluth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103084802/http://www.cataroo.com/DBdogs.html |archive-date=2014-01-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe film's lead voices, Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, had previously appeared together in five films. For this one, they requested them to record their parts in the studio together (in American animation, actors more commonly record their parts solo). Bluth agreed and allowed Reynolds and DeLuise to [[ad-lib]] extensively; Bluth later commented, \"their ad-libs were often better than the original script\".<ref name=\"beck\">*{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck|url-access=registration|date=October 2005|publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=1-55652-591-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/13 13\u201314]}} p.14</ref> However, Reynolds was more complimentary of the draft, warmly quipping, \"Great script, kid\", as he left the studio. Another pair of voices, those of Carface and Killer (Vic Tayback and Charles Nelson Reilly, respectively), also recorded together. Loni Anderson, who voices Flo, was Reynolds' then-wife.<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\" /> Child actress Judith Barsi, who voiced [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Ducky|Ducky]] in Bluth's previous film ''The Land Before Time'', was selected to voice Anne-Marie; she was killed in an apparent murder-suicide over a year before ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was released.<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\" />\n\nAs production neared completion, the studio held test screenings and decided that some of the scenes were too intense for younger viewers. Writer and producer Pomeroy decided to shorten Charlie's nightmare about being [[Damnation|condemned]]. Co-director Gary Goldman also agreed to the cut, recognizing that the concession needed to be made in the name of commercial appeal. Don Bluth owned a private 35-mm print of the movie with the cut-out scenes and planned to convince Goldcrest Films on releasing a director's cut of the film after returning from Ireland in the mid-1990s, but the print was eventually stolen from Bluth's locked storage room, diminishing hopes of this version being released on home media (though the cut-out scenes of Charlie's nightmare about being condemned was discovered by [[YouTube]] on October 29, 2016, therefore ''The Land Before Time'' was not included the cut-out scenes (due to being produced by Amblin Entertainment).<ref name=\"Ask Us Questions at donbluth.com\">Ask Us Questions at [donbluth.com]</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = All Dogs Go to Heaven Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = July 1, 1989<ref name=Amazon>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/All-Dogs-Heaven-Various-artists/dp/B00R4PB5E4 |title=All Dogs Go To Heaven: Various artists |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=October 20, 2015}}</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     = 33:18\n| label      = [[Curb Records]]\n| producer   = [[Ralph Burns]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = Don Bluth Music of Films\n | type       = soundtrack\n | prev_title = [[The Land Before Time]]\n | prev_year  = 1988\n | title      = All Dogs Go to Heaven\n | year       = 1989\n | next_title = [[Rock-a-Doodle]]\n | next_year  = 1992\n}}\n}}\n\nThe music for ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was composed by [[Ralph Burns]] with lyrics by [[Charles Strouse]], T.J.

Somewhat unusually, production investors Goldcrest Films covered the cost of the [[release print]]s and the promotional campaign, in return for a greatly reduced distribution fee from UA. This was similar to the arrangement with United Artists when they distributed Bluth's first feature film, ''The Secret of NIMH''. Goldcrest Films invested $15 million in printing and promoting the film. Due to contractual issues, very little tie-in merchandise accompanied the film's theatrical release;<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\"/> [[All Dogs Go to Heaven (video game)|a computer game adaptation]] for the [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] system (with a free software package) was released, and restaurant chain [[Wendy's]] offered toys with their Kids' Meals or regular fries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrojunk.com/details_commercial/186/ |title=Wendy's All Dogs Go to Heaven Toys |publisher=Retro Junk |accessdate=October 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe film opened in North America on November 17, 1989, which was the same day as Disney's 28th full-length animated motion picture ''The Little Mermaid''; once again, Sullivan Bluth Studios' latest feature would be vying for box-office receipts with Disney's, just as their last two films (''An American Tail'' and ''The Land Before Time'') had. On its theatrical release, while still making its budget of $13.8 million back, the film's performance fell short of Sullivan Bluth Studios' previous box-office successes, grossing $27 million in North America alone, just over half of what ''An American Tail'' and ''The Land Before Time'' each took.<ref name=\"boxoffice\">{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/people/directors/DBLU.php|title=Don Bluth - Box Office |publisher=The Numbers |accessdate=October 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\n''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' received a nomination for \"Best Family Motion Picture: Adventure or Cartoon\" at the [[11th Youth in Film Awards|11th annual Youth in Film Awards]] ceremony, being beaten by Disney's ''The Little Mermaid''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://youngartistawards.org/pastnoms11.htm |title=11th Annual Awards |publisher=Young Artist Awards |accessdate=October 21, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906180308/http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms11.htm |archive-date=2015-09-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The home video release received an Award of Excellence from the [[Film Advisory Board]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmadvisoryboard.com/aoe/OnVideo.php |title=Film Advisory Board, Inc. |accessdate=December 30, 2014 |publisher=Film Advisory Board}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width:100%;\"\n|-\n!
