A lower than expected blood volume, for instance, from taking a low-salt diet in the absence of any salt-retaining tendency. Or heat causing vaso-dilation and worsening the effect of the relatively insufficient blood volume. The next stage is the adrenergic response. If there is underlying fear or anxiety (e.g., social circumstances), or acute fear (e.g., acute threat, [[Trypanophobia|needle phobia]]), the vaso-motor centre demands an increased pumping action by the heart (flight or fight response). This is set in motion via the adrenergic (sympathetic) outflow from the brain, but the heart is unable to meet requirements because of the low blood volume, or decreased return. A feedback response to the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]] is triggered via the afferent [[vagus nerve]]. The high (ineffective) sympathetic activity is thereby modulated by vagal (parasympathetic) outflow leading to excessive slowing of heart rate. The abnormality lies in this excessive vagal response causing loss of blood flow to the brain.<ref name=\":1\" /> The tilt-table test typically evokes the attack. Avoiding what brings on the syncope and possibly greater salt intake is often all that is needed.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite journal|last1=Kaufmann|first1=H|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=K|date=May 2002|title=Diagnosis and treatment of neurally mediated syncope.|journal=The Neurologist|volume=8|issue=3|pages=175\u201385|doi=10.1097/00127893-200205000-00004|pmid=12803689}}</ref>\n\nAssociated symptoms may be felt in the minutes leading up to a vasovagal episode and are referred to as the prodrome. These consist of light-headedness, confusion, pallor, nausea, salivation, sweating, tachycardia, blurred vision, and sudden urge to defecate among other symptoms.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nVasovagal syncope can be considered in two forms:\n\n*Isolated episodes of loss of consciousness, unheralded by any warning symptoms for more than a few moments. These tend to occur in the adolescent age group and may be associated with fasting, exercise, abdominal straining, or circumstances promoting vaso-dilation (e.g., heat, alcohol). The subject is invariably upright. The [[tilt-table test]], if performed, is generally negative.\n*Recurrent syncope with complex associated symptoms. This is neurally mediated syncope (NMS). It is associated with any of the following: preceding or succeeding sleepiness, preceding visual disturbance (\"spots before the eyes\"), sweating, lightheadedness.<ref name=NIH2020 /> The subject is usually but not always upright. The tilt-table test, if performed, is generally positive. It is relatively uncommon.\n\nSyncope has been linked with psychological triggers.<ref name=NIH2020 /> This includes fainting in response to the sight or thought of blood, needles, pain, and other emotionally stressful situations. One theory in [[evolutionary psychology]] is that fainting at the sight of blood might have evolved as a form of [[Apparent death|playing dead]] which increased survival from attackers and might have slowed blood loss in a primitive environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-babble/201302/why-do-some-people-faint-the-sight-blood|title=Why do Some People Faint at the Sight of Blood?|url-status=live|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20160801224802/http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain%2Dbabble/201302/why%2Ddo%2Dsome%2Dpeople%2Dfaint%2Dthe%2Dsight%2Dblood|archive-date=2017-09-06|access-date=2015-08-15}}</ref>  \"Blood-injury phobia\", as this is called, is experienced by about 15% of people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/swoon-at-the-sight-of-blood|title=Swoon at the Sight of Blood?

A non-combatant who has fainted signals that she or he is not a threat. This would explain the  association between fainting and stimuli such as bloodletting and injuries seen in [[blood-injection-injury type phobia]]s such as [[needle phobia]] as well as the gender differences.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bracha HS |title=Human brain evolution and the 'Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle:' Implications for the Reclassification of fear-circuitry-related traits in DSM-V and for studying resilience to warzone-related posttraumatic stress disorder |journal=Prog.

[[Aortic stenosis]] and [[mitral stenosis]] are the most common examples. Major valves of the heart become stiffened and reduce the efficiency of the hearts pumping action. This may not cause symptoms at rest but with exertion, the heart is unable to keep up with increased demands leading to syncope. Aortic stenosis presents with repeated episodes of syncope.<ref name=\":1\" /> Rarely, cardiac tumors such as atrial myxomas can also lead to syncope.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Structural cardiopulmonary disease====\nDiseases involving the shape and strength of the heart can be a cause of reduced blood flow to the brain, which increases risk for syncope.<ref name=NIH2020 /> The most common cause in this category is fainting associated with an acute myocardial infarction or ischemic event.

This may avert a complete collapse, but whether the sufferer sits down or falls down, the result of an ischaemic episode is a posture in which less blood pressure is required to achieve adequate blood flow. An individual with very little skin pigmentation may appear to have all color drained from his or her face at the onset of an episode.<ref name=NIH2020 /> This effect combined with the following collapse can make a strong and dramatic impression on bystanders.\n\n====Vertebro-basilar arterial disease====\nArterial disease in the upper spinal cord, or lower brain that causes syncope if there is a reduction in blood supply. This may occur with extending the neck or with use of medications to lower blood pressure.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Other causes===\nThere are other conditions which may cause or resemble syncope.\n\nSeizures and syncope can be difficult to differentiate. Both often present as sudden loss of consciousness and convulsive movements may be present or absent in either. Movements in syncope are typically brief and more irregular than seizures.<ref name=\":8\" /> [[Atonic seizure|Akinetic seizures]] can present with sudden loss of postural tone without associated tonic-clonic movements. Absence of a long post-ictal state is indicative of syncope rather than an akinetic seizure.\n\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage may result in syncope. Often this is in combination with sudden, severe headache. It may occur as a result of a ruptured aneurysm or head trauma.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dubosh Nicole M.|last2=Bellolio M.

For individuals who have problems with chronic fainting spells, therapy should focus on recognizing the triggers and learning techniques to keep from fainting.<ref name=\":12\" /> At the appearance of warning signs such as lightheadedness, nausea, or cold and clammy skin, counter-pressure maneuvers that involve gripping fingers into a fist, tensing the arms, and crossing the legs or squeezing the thighs together can be used to ward off a fainting spell.  After the symptoms have passed, [[sleep]] is recommended. Lifestyle modifications are important for treating people experiencing repeated syncopal episodes. Avoiding triggers and situations where loss of consciousness would be seriously hazardous (operating heavy machinery, commercial pilot, etc.) has been shown to be effective.\n\nIf fainting spells occur often without a triggering event, syncope may be a sign of an underlying heart disease.<ref name=\":4\" /> In the case where syncope is caused by cardiac disease, the treatment is much more sophisticated than that of [[vasovagal]] syncope and may involve [[artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemakers]] and [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillators]] depending on the precise cardiac cause.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Risk tools ===\nThe [[San Francisco Syncope Rule|San Francisco syncope rule]] was developed to isolate people who have higher risk for a serious cause of syncope.

recovery.<ref name=EB2014/> It is caused by a decrease in blood flow to the [[brain]], typically from [[hypotension|low blood pressure]].<ref name=EB2014/> There are sometimes [[prodrome|symptoms before the loss of consciousness]] such as [[lightheadedness]], [[diaphoresis|sweating]], [[pale skin]], blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, or feeling warm.<ref name=NIH2020 /><ref name=EB2014/> Syncope may also be associated with a short episode of muscle twitching.<ref name=EB2014/><ref name=NIH2020 /> When consciousness and muscle strength are not completely lost, it is called [[presyncope]].<ref name=EB2014/> It is recommended that presyncope be treated the same as syncope.<ref name=EB2014/>\n\n<!-- Cause -->\nCauses range from non-serious to potentially fatal.<ref name=EB2014/> There are three broad categories of causes: [[heart]] or [[blood vessel]] related; [[reflex syncope|reflex]], also known as [[Nervous system|neurally]] mediated; and [[orthostatic hypotension]].<ref name=EB2014/><ref name=NIH2020 /> Issues with the heart and blood vessels are the cause in about 10% and typically the most serious while neurally mediated is the most common.<ref name=EB2014/> Heart related causes may include an [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythm]], problems with the [[heart valve]]s or heart muscle and blockages of blood vessels from a [[pulmonary embolism]] or [[aortic dissection]] among others.<ref name=EB2014/> Neurally mediated syncope occurs when blood vessels expand and [[bradycardia|heart rate decreases]] inappropriately.<ref name=EB2014/> This may occur from either a triggering event such as exposure to blood, pain, strong feelings or a specific activity such as [[urination]], [[vomiting]], or [[coughing]].<ref name=EB2014/> Neurally mediated syncope may also occur when an area in the neck known as the [[carotid sinus]] is pressed.<ref name=EB2014/> The third type of syncope is due to a drop in blood pressure when changing position such as when standing up.<ref name=EB2014/> This is often due to medications that a person is taking but may also be related to [[dehydration]], significant bleeding or [[infection]].<ref name=EB2014/> There also seems to be a genetic component to syncope.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hadji-Turdeghal |first1=Katra |title=Genome-wide association study identifies locus at

[[prodrome]].<ref name=EB2014/> Low blood pressure and a fast heart rate after the event may indicate blood loss or dehydration, while [[Hypoxia (medical)|low blood oxygen levels]] may be seen following the event in those with pulmonary embolism.<ref name=EB2014/> More specific tests such as [[implantable loop recorder]]s, [[tilt table testing]] or [[carotid sinus massage]] may be useful in uncertain cases.<ref name=EB2014/> [[Computer tomography|Computed tomography]] (CT) is generally not required unless specific concerns are present.<ref name=EB2014/> Other causes of similar symptoms that should be considered include [[seizure]], [[stroke]], [[concussion]], [[Hypoxia (medical)|low blood oxygen]], [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], [[drug intoxication]] and some psychiatric

(situational) syncope is one of the most common types which may occur in response to any of a variety of triggers, such as scary, embarrassing or uneasy situations, during blood drawing, or moments of sudden unusually high stress.<ref name=NIH2020>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Syncope-Information-Page|title=Syncope Information Page {{!}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke|website=www.ninds.nih.gov|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> There are many different syncope syndromes which all fall under the umbrella of vasovagal syncope related by the same central mechanism.<ref name=NIH2020 /> First, the person is usually predisposed to decreased blood pressure by various environmental factors. A lower than expected blood volume, for instance, from taking a low-salt diet in the absence of any salt-retaining tendency. Or heat causing vaso-dilation and worsening the effect of the relatively insufficient blood volume. The next stage is the adrenergic response. If there is underlying fear or anxiety (e.g., social circumstances), or acute fear (e.g., acute threat, [[Trypanophobia|needle phobia]]), the vaso-motor centre demands an increased pumping action by the heart (flight or fight response). This is set in motion via the adrenergic (sympathetic) outflow from the brain, but the heart is unable to meet requirements because of the low blood volume, or decreased return. A feedback response to the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]] is triggered via the afferent [[vagus nerve]]. The high (ineffective) sympathetic activity is thereby modulated by vagal (parasympathetic) outflow leading to excessive slowing of heart rate. The abnormality lies in this excessive vagal response causing loss of blood flow to the brain.<ref name=\":1\" /> The tilt-table test typically evokes the attack. Avoiding what brings on the syncope and possibly greater salt intake is often all that is needed.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite journal|last1=Kaufmann|first1=H|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=K|date=May 2002|title=Diagnosis and treatment of neurally mediated syncope.|journal=The Neurologist|volume=8|issue=3|pages=175\u201385|doi=10.1097/00127893-200205000-00004|pmid=12803689}}</ref>\n\nAssociated symptoms may be felt in the minutes leading up to a vasovagal episode and are referred to as the prodrome. These consist of light-headedness, confusion, pallor, nausea, salivation, sweating, tachycardia, blurred vision, and sudden urge to defecate among other symptoms.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nVasovagal syncope can be considered in two forms:\n\n*Isolated episodes of loss of consciousness, unheralded by any warning symptoms for more than a few moments. These tend to occur in the adolescent age group and may be associated with fasting, exercise, abdominal straining, or circumstances promoting vaso-dilation (e.g., heat, alcohol). The subject is invariably upright. The [[tilt-table test]], if performed, is generally negative.\n*Recurrent syncope with complex associated symptoms. This is neurally mediated syncope (NMS). It is associated with any of the following: preceding or succeeding sleepiness, preceding visual disturbance (\"spots before the eyes\"), sweating, lightheadedness.<ref name=NIH2020 /> The subject is usually but not always upright. The tilt-table test, if performed, is generally positive. It is relatively uncommon.\n\nSyncope has been linked with psychological triggers.<ref name=NIH2020 /> This includes fainting in response to the sight or thought of blood, needles, pain, and other emotionally stressful situations. One theory in [[evolutionary psychology]] is that fainting at the sight of blood might have evolved as a form of [[Apparent death|playing dead]] which increased survival from attackers and might have slowed blood loss in a primitive environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-babble/201302/why-do-some-people-faint-the-sight-blood|title=Why do Some People Faint at the Sight of Blood?|url-status=live|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20160801224802/http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain%2Dbabble/201302/why%2Ddo%2Dsome%2Dpeople%2Dfaint%2Dthe%2Dsight%2Dblood|archive-date=2017-09-06|access-date=2015-08-15}}</ref>  \"Blood-injury phobia\", as this is called, is experienced by about 15% of people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/swoon-at-the-sight-of-blood|title=Swoon at the Sight of Blood?

A non-combatant who has fainted signals that she or he is not a threat. This would explain the  association between fainting and stimuli such as bloodletting and injuries seen in [[blood-injection-injury type phobia]]s such as [[needle phobia]] as well as the gender differences.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bracha HS |title=Human brain evolution and the 'Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle:' Implications for the Reclassification of fear-circuitry-related traits in DSM-V and for studying resilience to warzone-related posttraumatic stress disorder |journal=Prog.

[[Aortic stenosis]] and [[mitral stenosis]] are the most common examples. Major valves of the heart become stiffened and reduce the efficiency of the hearts pumping action. This may not cause symptoms at rest but with exertion, the heart is unable to keep up with increased demands leading to syncope.

It is as common or perhaps even more common than vasovagal syncope.\n\nThis may be due to medications, [[dehydration]], significant bleeding or [[infection]].<ref name=\"EB2014\" /> The most susceptible individuals are elderly frail individuals, or persons who are dehydrated from hot environments or inadequate fluid intake.<ref name=NIH2020 /> For example, medical students would be at risk for orthostatic hypotensive syncope while observing long surgeries in the operating room.<ref name=\"Jamjoom2009\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Jamjoom AA, Nikkar-Esfahani A, Fitzgerald JE|year=2009|title=Operating theatre related syncope in medical students: a cross sectional study|journal=BMC Med Educ|volume=9|pages=14|doi=10.1186/1472-6920-9-14|pmc=2657145|pmid=19284564}}</ref> There is also evidence that exercise training can help reduce orthostatic intolerance.<ref>{{cite book|title=Springer ''Reference''|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2011|chapter=Athletes and Sudden Cardiac Death|doi=10.1007/springerreference_188007}}</ref> More serious orthostatic hypotension is often the result of certain commonly prescribed medications such as diuretics, \u03b2-adrenergic blockers, other anti-hypertensives (including vasodilators), and [[nitroglycerin]].<ref name=NIH2020 /> In a small percentage of cases, the cause of orthostatic hypotensive faints is structural damage to the [[autonomic nervous system]] due to systemic diseases (e.g., [[amyloidosis]] or diabetes) or in neurological diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHyperadrenergic orthostatic hypotension refers to an orthostatic drop in blood pressure despite high levels of sympathetic adrenergic response. This occurs when a people with normal physiology is unable to compensate for >20% loss in intravascular volume.<ref name=\":11\" /> This may be due to blood loss, dehydration or [[Fluid compartments|third-spacing]]. On standing the person will experience reflex tachycardia (at least 20% increased over supine) and a drop in blood pressure.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension occurs when the person is unable to sustain a normal sympathetic response to blood pressure changes during movement despite adequate intravascular volume. There is little to no compensatory increase in heart rate or blood pressure when standing for up to 10 minutes. This is often due to an underlying disorder or medication use and is accompanied by other [[Adrenal insufficiency|hypoadrenergic signs]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Central nervous system ischemia===\nThe central ischemic response is triggered by an inadequate supply of oxygenated blood in the brain.<ref name=NIH2020 /> Common examples include [[stroke]]s and [[transient ischemic attack]]s. While these conditions often impair consciousness they rarely meet the medical definition of syncope. [[Vertebrobasilar artery stroke|Vertebrobasilar]] transient ischemic attacks may produce true syncope as a symptom.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe respiratory system may compensate for dropping oxygen levels through [[hyperventilation]], though a sudden [[Ischemia|ischemic]] episode may also proceed faster than the respiratory system can respond.<ref name=\":1\" />  These processes cause the typical symptoms of fainting: pale skin,  rapid breathing, nausea and weakness of the limbs, particularly of the legs.<ref name=NIH2020 /> If the ischemia is intense or prolonged, limb weakness progresses to collapse.<ref name=NIH2020 />  The weakness of the legs causes most people to sit or lie down if there is time to do so. This may avert a complete collapse, but whether the sufferer sits down or falls down, the result of an ischaemic episode is a posture in which less blood pressure is required to achieve adequate blood flow. An individual with very little skin pigmentation may appear to have all color drained from his or her face at the onset of an episode.<ref name=NIH2020 /> This effect combined with the following collapse can make a strong and dramatic impression on bystanders.\n\n====Vertebro-basilar arterial disease====\nArterial disease in the upper spinal cord, or lower brain that causes syncope if there is a reduction in blood supply. This may occur with extending the neck or with use of medications to lower blood pressure.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Other causes===\nThere are other conditions which may cause or resemble syncope.\n\nSeizures and syncope can be difficult to differentiate. Both often present as sudden loss of consciousness and convulsive movements may be present or absent in either. Movements in syncope are typically brief and more irregular than seizures.<ref name=\":8\" /> [[Atonic seizure|Akinetic seizures]] can present with sudden loss of postural tone without associated tonic-clonic movements. Absence of a long post-ictal state is indicative of syncope rather than an akinetic seizure.\n\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage may result in syncope. Often this is in combination with sudden, severe headache. It may occur as a result of a ruptured aneurysm or head trauma.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dubosh Nicole M.|last2=Bellolio M.

For individuals who have problems with chronic fainting spells, therapy should focus on recognizing the triggers and learning techniques to keep from fainting.<ref name=\":12\" /> At the appearance of warning signs such as lightheadedness, nausea, or cold and clammy skin, counter-pressure maneuvers that involve gripping fingers into a fist, tensing the arms, and crossing the legs or squeezing the thighs together can be used to ward off a fainting spell.  After the symptoms have passed, [[sleep]] is recommended. Lifestyle modifications are important for treating people experiencing repeated syncopal episodes. Avoiding triggers and situations where loss of consciousness would be seriously hazardous (operating heavy machinery, commercial pilot, etc.) has been shown to be effective.\n\nIf fainting spells occur often without a triggering event, syncope may be a sign of an underlying heart disease.<ref name=\":4\" /> In the case where syncope is caused by cardiac disease, the treatment is much more sophisticated than that of [[vasovagal]] syncope and may involve [[artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemakers]] and [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillators]] depending on the precise cardiac cause.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Risk tools ===\nThe [[San Francisco Syncope Rule|San Francisco syncope rule]] was developed to isolate people who have higher risk for a serious cause of syncope.

Access is by the D203 road from [[Fraisse-Cabard\u00e8s]] in the north-west passing through the length of the commune to the village then continuing south to [[Pennautier]]. There is also the D935 going south-east from the village to [[Villegailhenc]]. The north of the commune is quite rugged and heavily forested while the south of the commune is farmland with some patches of forest.\n\nThe ''Ruisseau de Trapel'' flows from the north-west passing north of the village and gathering tributaries as it continues south-east to join the [[Canal du Midi]] south of ''Les Pradels''. The ''Ruisseau de la Vallette'' also flows from further north-west to pass the village on the southern side before joining the ''Trapel''.

In 1820 a fragment with a Gallo-Roman funerary inscription was discovered.\n\nIn the 10th century Aragon belonged to the ''Abbey of Montolieu'' but, from the beginning of the 12th century, traces of the Lords of Aragon have been found. They then had large areas of land but they seem to have followed the [[Cathar]] cause. They were thus deprived of their property by the [[Inquisition]] although they received financial compensation. Their fief was then shared between the Royal Domain and the bishopric of Carcassonne but, even without the protection of lords, [[Catharism]] still survived in the village.\n[[File:Village d'Aragon.jpg|thumb|Aragon Village]]\n\nIn 1575 and in 1588 the [[Huguenots]] occupied the village. The [[Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon|Viscount of Turenne]] recaptured it in 1580.\n\nThe village experienced a period of prosperity in the late 18th century when looms for supplying the clothiers at [[Carcassonne]] brought additional revenue to the community.\n\nIn the 17th century, the lordship of Aragon belonged to ''Sebastian de Maurel'', whose daughter, ''Anne de Maurel d'Aragon'', was married in 1726 at Aragon to ''Pierre de Bancalis'', giving birth to the noble family ''Bancalis de Maurel d'Aragon''.\n\n===Heraldry===\n{{Blazon-arms\n|img1=Blason Aragon.svg\n|legend1=Arms of Aragon \n|text=\n\n'''Blazon:'''<br/>\n''Argent, a bend of Sable.''\n}}\n\n==Administration==\n'''List of Successive Mayors'''<ref>[http://www.francegenweb.org/mairesgenweb/resultcommune.php?id=12784 List of Mayors of France]</ref>\n{{Hidden begin\n|title=[[Mayor (France)|Mayors]] from the French Revolution to 1929\n|titlestyle = background:palegreen;\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 1820 a fragment with a Gallo-Roman funerary inscription was discovered.\n\nIn the 10th century Aragon belonged to the ''Abbey of Montolieu'' but, from the beginning of the 12th century, traces of the Lords of Aragon have been found. They then had large areas of land but they seem to have followed the [[Cathar]] cause. They were thus deprived of their property by the [[Inquisition]] although they received financial compensation. Their fief was then shared between the Royal Domain and the bishopric of Carcassonne but, even without the protection of lords, [[Catharism]] still survived in the village.\n[[File:Village d'Aragon.jpg|thumb|Aragon Village]]\n\nIn 1575 and in 1588 the [[Huguenots]] occupied the village. The [[Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon|Viscount of Turenne]] recaptured it in 1580.\n\nThe village experienced a period of prosperity in the late 18th century when looms for supplying the clothiers at [[Carcassonne]] brought additional revenue to the community.\n\nIn the 17th century, the lordship of Aragon belonged to ''Sebastian de Maurel'', whose daughter, ''Anne de Maurel d'Aragon'', was married in 1726 at Aragon to ''Pierre de Bancalis'', giving birth to the noble family ''Bancalis de Maurel d'Aragon''.\n\n===Heraldry===\n{{Blazon-arms\n|img1=Blason Aragon.svg\n|legend1=Arms of Aragon \n|text=\n\n'''Blazon:'''<br/>\n''Argent, a bend of Sable.''\n}}\n\n==Administration==\n'''List of Successive Mayors'''<ref>[http://www.francegenweb.org/mairesgenweb/resultcommune.php?id=12784 List of Mayors of France]</ref>\n{{Hidden begin\n|title=[[Mayor (France)|Mayors]] from the French Revolution to 1929\n|titlestyle = background:palegreen;\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

As part of its investigation, TSSA officials and the Ontario Fire Marshal are reviewing past inspections of the facility to determine the cause of the explosions.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-to-review-zoning-bylaws-after-propane-explosion-fire-1.697552 |title=Toronto to review zoning bylaws after propane explosion, fire |date=2008-08-11 |accessdate=2008-08-11 |publisher=[[CBC.ca]]}}</ref>\n\nThe explosion caused damage to one of Toronto's oldest Jewish [[cemetery|cemeteries]], the Mount Sinai Memorial Park.

Some residents claim that the community was not consulted or notified about the facility when it was being built. However, [[Shelley Carroll]], Toronto's acting deputy mayor, suggested that the facility had been zoned before many of the homes were built.<ref name=\"built\" />\n\nThe Technical Standards and Safety Authority, the agency that regulates fuel safety in Ontario, originally said that it had only inspected Sunrise once since it opened in 2005.

De Leon said he then went inside the facility's office to warn Saini to flee the building, but he refused.
