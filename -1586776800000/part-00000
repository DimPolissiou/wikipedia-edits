Its six-episode run began on 15 October 2012 at 10pm.\n\n==Plot==\n''Switch'' is an upbeat comedy-drama about four young witches trying to make their way in the big city where they live in [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], [[North London]]. They want to live a modern life, not one based on their mother's old-fashioned rituals.

Always immaculately dressed, Stella's the grown-up who goes out to work and pays all the bills, but her willingness to please can often see her getting into tricky situations. But despite the odd panic whenever things get out of control, it's Stella who's there to look after the other girls (and tidy the flat after them).

Debnath also commented on Fadipe's performance saying it was \"equally as strong\" as Stewart-Jarrett's.

He has lectured on mathematics and musical theater. He is best known for the pithy and humorous songs that he recorded in the 1950s and 1960s. His songs often parodied popular musical forms, though he usually created original melodies when doing so. A notable exception is \"[[The Elements (song)|The Elements]]\", in which he set the names of the [[chemical element]]s to the tune of the \"[[Major-General's Song]]\" from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Pirates of Penzance]]''.\n\nLehrer's early musical work typically dealt with non-topical subject matter and was noted for its [[black humor]] in songs such as \"[[Poisoning Pigeons in the Park]]\". In the 1960s, he produced a number of songs that dealt with social and political issues of the day, particularly when he wrote for the U.S. version of the television show ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]''. The popularity of these songs has far outlasted their topical subjects and references. Lehrer quoted a friend's explanation: \"Always predict the worst and you'll be hailed as a prophet.\"<ref>{{cite episode|last=Ford|first=Andrew|title=Tom Lehrer|series=The Music Show|transcript=Interview transcript|transcripturl=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/musicshow/tom-lehrer/3344656#transcript|date=July 8, 2006|station=[[Radio National]]|network=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref> In the early 1970s, Lehrer largely retired from public performances to devote his time to teaching mathematics and musical theater history at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].\n\n==Early life==\nTom Lehrer was born in 1928 to a secular Jewish family and grew up on [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper East Side]].<ref name=bensmith>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Ben|title=Looking For Tom Lehrer, Comedy's Mysterious Genius|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/tom-lehrer|accessdate=April 12, 2014|newspaper=[[BuzzFeed]]|date=April 9, 2014|authorlink=Ben Smith (journalist)}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Celebrities in Hell|year=2002|publisher=ChelCpress|isbn=9781569802144|page=72|author=Warren Allen Smith|chapter=Tom Lehrer|quote=He responded: No one is more dangerous than someone who thinks he has The Truth.

Lehrer's style consists of [[Parody music|parodying]] various forms of [[popular song]]. For example, his appreciation of [[list song]]s led him to write ''[[The Elements (song)|The Elements]]'', which lists the [[chemical element]]s to the tune of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Major-General's Song]]''.\n\nIn author [[Isaac Asimov]]'s second autobiographical volume ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recounted seeing Lehrer perform in a Boston nightclub on October 9, 1954. Lehrer sang cleverly about Jim getting it from Louise, and Sally from Jim, \"...and after a while you gathered the 'it' was venereal disease [the song was likely \"[[I Got It From Agnes|I Got It From Sally]]\" (in later versions \"Agnes\")]. Suddenly, as the combinations grew more grotesque, you realized he was satirizing every known perversion without using a single naughty phrase. It was clearly unsingable (in those days) outside a nightclub.\" Asimov also recalled a song that dealt with the [[Boston subway]] system, making use of the stations leading into town from Harvard, observing that the local subject-matter rendered the song useless for general distribution. Lehrer subsequently granted Asimov permission to print the lyrics to the subway song in his book. \"I haven't gone to nightclubs often,\" said Asimov, \"but of all the times I have gone, it was on this occasion that I had by far the best time.\"<ref>Asimov, Isaac, ''In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954\u20131978''. Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1980, p. 15.</ref>\n\n===Recordings===\nLehrer was encouraged by the success of his performances, so he paid $15 for some studio time in 1953 to record ''[[Songs by Tom Lehrer]]''. The initial pressing was 400 copies. Radio stations would not air his songs because of his controversial subjects, so he sold the album on campus at Harvard for $3,  {{Inflation|US|3|1953|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}, while \"several stores near the Harvard campus sold it for $3.50, taking only a minimal markup as a kind of community service.

Interest in his recordings spread by word of mouth. People played their records for friends, who then also wanted a copy.<ref name=\"Jim Bessman 1997\">Jim Bessman. \"Rhino Reissues Lehrer's Seminal 'Songs' Albums\".

It became a [[Cult following|cult success]] by word of mouth, despite being self-published and without promotion. Lehrer embarked on a series of concert tours and recorded a second album in 1959. He released the second album in two versions: the songs were the same, but ''[[More of Tom Lehrer]]'' was a studio recording and ''[[An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer]]'' was recorded live in concert.

Lehrer later performed these songs on the album ''[[That Was The Year That Was]]'' (1965) at which point people could hear them the way that he intended.\n\nIn 1966, [[David Frost]] invited him to contribute some of his classic compositions to his BBC program ''[[The Frost Report]]''. The show was transmitted live, and he pre-recorded all his segments at one performance. Lehrer was not featured in every edition, but his songs featured in an appropriate part of each show. At least two of his songs were not included on any of his LPs: a reworking of No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s \"That is the End of the News\" (with some new lyrics) and a comic explanation of how Britain might adapt to the [[Decimal Day|coming of decimal currency]].\n\nIn 1960, Lehrer toured Australia and New Zealand, performing a total of 33 concerts to great acclaim.<ref name=barryhansen/> Yet this occurred during a time in which he was \"banned, censored, mentioned in several houses of parliament and threatened with arrest\", in his words. In particular, \"Be Prepared\" drew advance resistance in Brisbane from the chief of police. He performed several unreleased songs in Australia, including \"The Masochism Tango\".<ref name=smh/>\n\nLehrer made a short tour in Norway and Denmark in 1967, where he performed some of the songs from the television program. The performance in Oslo on September 10 was recorded on video tape and aired locally that autumn, and this program was released on DVD some 40 years later. He performed as a prominent international guest at the ''Studenterforeningen'' (student association) in Copenhagen, which was televised, and he commented onstage that he might be America's \"revenge for [[Victor Borge]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/6funswede |title=The Tom Lehrer Wisdom Channel |publisher=YouTube |date=September 11, 1967 |accessdate=October 27, 2015}}</ref> He performed original songs in a Dodge automobile industrial film distributed primarily to automobile dealers and shown at promotional events in 1967, set in a fictional American wild west town and titled ''The Dodge Rebellion Theatre presents Ballads For '67''.<ref name=barryhansen/><ref>{{cite web|title=The Dodge industrial Film|url=http://home.broadpark.no/~emeyn/tl/dodge.html|website=The Tom Lehrer Wisdom Channel|access-date=March 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420112540/http://home.broadpark.no/~emeyn/tl/dodge.html#|archive-date=April 20, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> He attempted to adapt [[Sweeney Todd]] as a Broadway musical, working with [[Joe Raposo]], to star [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]].

The Reprise issue of ''Songs by Tom Lehrer'' was a stereo re-recording. This version was not issued on CD, but the songs were issued on the live ''[[Tom Lehrer Revisited]]'' CD. The live recording included bonus tracks \"L-Y\" and \"Silent E\", two of the ten songs that he wrote for the PBS children's educational series ''[[The Electric Company (1971 TV series)|The Electric Company]]''. Lehrer later commented that worldwide sales of the recordings under Reprise surpassed 1.8 million units in 1996. That same year, ''That Was The Year That Was'' went gold.<ref name=\"Jim Bessman 1997\"/>  The album liner notes promote his songs with self-deprecating humor, such as quoting a ''New York Times'' review from 1958: Mr. Lehrer's muse is \"not fettered by such inhibiting factors as taste.\"\n\n===Departure from the music scene===\nIn the 1970s, Lehrer concentrated on teaching mathematics and musical theater, although he also wrote ten songs for the educational children's television show ''[[The Electric Company]]''. His last public performance took place in 1972, on a fundraising tour for Democratic US presidential candidate [[George McGovern]].<ref name=bensmith/>\n\nThere is a false rumor that Lehrer gave up [[political satire]] when the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] was awarded to [[Henry Kissinger]] in 1973.

He observed that when he was moved to write and perform songs, he did, and when he was not, he did not, and that after a while he simply lost interest. Even though Lehrer was \"a hero of the anti-nuclear, civil rights left\" and covered its political issues in many of his songs, and even though he shared the [[New Left]]'s opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], and advocated for civil rights, he disliked the aesthetics of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] and stopped performing as the movement gained momentum.<ref name=bensmith/>\n\nLehrer's musical career was relatively brief.

Lehrer was not initially involved with the show, but he was pleased with it; he eventually gave the stage production his full support and updated several of his lyrics for the show.

It was accompanied by a small hardbound book containing an introduction by [[Dr. Demento]] and lyrics for all the songs. In 2010, [[Shout!

He has lectured on mathematics and musical theater. He is best known for the pithy and humorous songs that he recorded in the 1950s and 1960s. His songs often parodied popular musical forms, though he usually created original melodies when doing so. A notable exception is \"[[The Elements (song)|The Elements]]\", in which he set the names of the [[chemical element]]s to the tune of the \"[[Major-General's Song]]\" from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Pirates of Penzance]]''.\n\nLehrer's early musical work typically dealt with non-topical subject matter and was noted for its [[black humor]] in songs such as \"[[Poisoning Pigeons in the Park]]\". In the 1960s, he produced a number of songs that dealt with social and political issues of the day, particularly when he wrote for the U.S. version of the television show ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]''. The popularity of these songs has far outlasted their topical subjects and references.

Lehrer's style consists of [[Parody music|parodying]] various forms of [[popular song]]. For example, his appreciation of [[list song]]s led him to write ''[[The Elements (song)|The Elements]]'', which lists the [[chemical element]]s to the tune of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Major-General's Song]]''.\n\nIn author [[Isaac Asimov]]'s second autobiographical volume ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recounted seeing Lehrer perform in a Boston nightclub on October 9, 1954. Lehrer sang cleverly about Jim getting it from Louise, and Sally from Jim, \"...and after a while you gathered the 'it' was venereal disease [the song was likely \"[[I Got It From Agnes|I Got It From Sally]]\" (in later versions \"Agnes\")]. Suddenly, as the combinations grew more grotesque, you realized he was satirizing every known perversion without using a single naughty phrase. It was clearly unsingable (in those days) outside a nightclub.\" Asimov also recalled a song that dealt with the [[Boston subway]] system, making use of the stations leading into town from Harvard, observing that the local subject-matter rendered the song useless for general distribution. Lehrer subsequently granted Asimov permission to print the lyrics to the subway song in his book. \"I haven't gone to nightclubs often,\" said Asimov, \"but of all the times I have gone, it was on this occasion that I had by far the best time.\"<ref>Asimov, Isaac, ''In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954\u20131978''. Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1980, p. 15.</ref>\n\n===Recordings===\nLehrer was encouraged by the success of his performances, so he paid $15 for some studio time in 1953 to record ''[[Songs by Tom Lehrer]]''. The initial pressing was 400 copies. Radio stations would not air his songs because of his controversial subjects, so he sold the album on campus at Harvard for $3,  {{Inflation|US|3|1953|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}, while \"several stores near the Harvard campus sold it for $3.50, taking only a minimal markup as a kind of community service.

He released the second album in two versions: the songs were the same, but ''[[More of Tom Lehrer]]'' was a studio recording and ''[[An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer]]'' was recorded live in concert.

Lehrer later performed these songs on the album ''[[That Was The Year That Was]]'' (1965) at which point people could hear them the way that he intended.\n\nIn 1966, [[David Frost]] invited him to contribute some of his classic compositions to his BBC program ''[[The Frost Report]]''. The show was transmitted live, and he pre-recorded all his segments at one performance. Lehrer was not featured in every edition, but his songs featured in an appropriate part of each show. At least two of his songs were not included on any of his LPs: a reworking of No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s \"That is the End of the News\" (with some new lyrics) and a comic explanation of how Britain might adapt to the [[Decimal Day|coming of decimal currency]].\n\nIn 1960, Lehrer toured Australia and New Zealand, performing a total of 33 concerts to great acclaim.<ref name=barryhansen/> Yet this occurred during a time in which he was \"banned, censored, mentioned in several houses of parliament and threatened with arrest\", in his words.

The live recording included bonus tracks \"L-Y\" and \"Silent E\", two of the ten songs that he wrote for the PBS children's educational series ''[[The Electric Company (1971 TV series)|The Electric Company]]''. Lehrer later commented that worldwide sales of the recordings under Reprise surpassed 1.8 million units in 1996.

He observed that when he was moved to write and perform songs, he did, and when he was not, he did not, and that after a while he simply lost interest. Even though Lehrer was \"a hero of the anti-nuclear, civil rights left\" and covered its political issues in many of his songs, and even though he shared the [[New Left]]'s opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], and advocated for civil rights, he disliked the aesthetics of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] and stopped performing as the movement gained momentum.<ref name=bensmith/>\n\nLehrer's musical career was relatively brief.
