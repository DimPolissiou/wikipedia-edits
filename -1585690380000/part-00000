Town Hall]] in 1845]]\nThe earliest orchestral concerts known to have taken place in Birmingham were those organised by [[Barnabas Gunn]] at the [[Moor Street Theatre]] in 1740,<ref

Online|title=Birmingham|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/03130|accessdate=2017-01-28|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}</ref> and more than 20 separate orchestras are recorded as having existed in the city between that date and the foundation of what is now the CBSO in 1920.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=9}} These orchestras often owed their origins to Birmingham's internationally significant tradition of [[choral music]], that give birth to works such as [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelsohn]]'s ''[[Elijah (oratorio)|Elijah]]'' and [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]'s ''[[The Dream of Gerontius|Dream of Gerontius]]'',{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=111}} and in 1834 saw the building [[Birmingham Town Hall]], one of Europe's earliest large-scale concert halls.<ref>{{cite news|first=Alfred|last=Hickling|title=Pull out all the stops|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/26/classicalmusicandopera1|newspaper=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=2007-10-28|accessdate=2017-01-28}}</ref> Birmingham's most notable early orchestra was the [[Birmingham Triennial Music Festival|Birmingham Festival Orchestra]], which formed as a group of 25 musicians in 1768 but by 1834 had grown into an orchestra of 147.{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=111}} Under [[Michael Costa (conductor)|Michael Costa]] and [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] between 1849 and 1909 it included some of the leading instrumentalists of its day from across Britain and Europe,<ref name=\"Grove-Birmingham\" /> but remained an ''ad hoc'' grouping that assembled to play only at the three-yearly festivals.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=9}} The town's first permanently established orchestra of locally based professional musicians was [[William Stockley's Orchestra]], which was founded in 1856 and held annual concert seasons between 1873 and 1897.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=167}} This was eclipsed as the city's leading orchestra at the end of the 19th century by [[George Halford's Orchestra]], which put on similar series of concerts between 1897 and 1909.<ref name=\"Grove-Birmingham\" />\n\n[[File:Granville Bantock 1868 - 1946.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Granville Bantock]], whose 1919 proposal led to the foundation of the City of Birmingham Orchestra in 1920.]]\nStockley and Halford established regular orchestral concerts as an expected feature of life in Birmingham{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=214}} which by the late 19th century supported a substantial pool of high quality locally based professional musicians.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=216}} Between 1905 and 1920 this demand was met by a number of competing enterprises.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=215}} Halford's players reformed in 1906 as the self-governing [[Birmingham Symphony Orchestra]], which continued to perform until 1918 under notable conductors including [[Henry Wood]], [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] and Halford himself.{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=216-217}} [[Landon Ronald]] presented an annual season of promenade concerts at the [[Theatre Royal, Birmingham|Theatre Royal]] in New Street from 1905 to 1914 with a 70-strong orchestra made up largely of Birmingham-based musicians.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=215}} [[Appleby Matthews]] and [[Richard Wassell]] both ran separate orchestras in their own names presenting annual series of concerts between 1916 and 1920;{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=223}} and [[Thomas Beecham]] conducted and promoted his own [[New Birmingham Orchestra]] between 1917 and 1919.{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=222-223}}\n\nFrom 1916 onwards, a group of influential local figures began to pursue the idea of a single, permanent, municipally funded orchestra,{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=223-224}} in keeping with the [[Civic Gospel]] tradition established in Birmingham under [[Joseph Chamberlain]], that envisaged cities as having responsibility as a body for their citizens' civic, social and cultural welfare.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=253}} Leading members of this campaign included [[Neville Chamberlain]], who was [[Lord Mayor of Birmingham]] from 1916 to 1918; [[Granville Bantock]], composer and Professor of Music at the [[University of Birmingham]]; and [[Ernest Newman]], a leading Birmingham-based music critic, who had written as early as 1913 that the system of financial guarantees from wealthy patrons that had supported Birmingham's orchestras through the 19th century had become discredited.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=16-17}} The group's first plan was to support Beecham's New Birmingham Orchestra, but this enterprise was wound up after the government requisitioned the Town Hall for the issue of First World War ration books, depriving it of its primary concert venue.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=18-19}} A few weeks after the end of the war Bantock revived the idea {{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=21}} and on 17 March 1919 he submitted a proposal to [[Birmingham City Council]] for an orchestra of 70 musicians to be engaged annually from October to May, at an estimated annual cost of \u00a38,500 and with projected annual revenue of \u00a36,000.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=22-23}} The city council agreed to support the proposal with an annual grant of \u00a31,250 for an experimental period of five years,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=248}} the first time that public funds had been used to support an orchestra anywhere in Great Britain.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=23}}\n\n=== Early years under Matthews ===\n[[File:Appleby-Matthews.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Appleby Matthews]]]]\nThe new orchestra's management committee met for the first time on 19 June 1919 and named itself the City of Birmingham Orchestra or CBO, probably to emphasise its civic status,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=23}} though it also made clear that the CBO would be a self-governing musical body, not a municipal orchestra along the lines of those commonly found in seaside resorts.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=93}} During its early years the orchestra was sometimes referred to as the Birmingham City Orchestra, or commonly just the \"City Orchestra\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}} [[Thomas Beecham]] was considered to be the most suitable candidate for the Principal Conductor role, but he was pre-occupied with his own acute financial problems and had not forgiven the city for its failure to support his earlier [[New Birmingham Orchestra]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=20, 23}} As a result, a shortlist of four candidates was drawn up from the numerous applications for the post, though the initial one-year contract came to limit the choice to local applicants.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}} The eventual appointee was [[Appleby Matthews]], who had been running his own orchestra in the city since 1916 and had strong support from local music critics on the selection panel.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}} [[Richard Wassell]] was appointed as Assistant Conductor.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}}\n\n[[File:CBSO first concert - programme.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Programme for the first symphony concert, conducted by [[Edward Elgar]] on 10 November 1920]]\nMatthews' plan was to hold eight Saturday concerts and six Wednesday concerts each year at [[Birmingham Town Hall]], with a series of 38 concerts of more popular programmes at cheaper venues on Sundays,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=27}} continuing the tradition of Sunday popular classics established by his own orchestra over the previous five years.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=247}} The orchestra first rehearsed at 9.30am on 4 September 1920, in the band room at the [[Birmingham City Police]]'s Steelhouse Lane station.<ref name=\"Morley-2010-11-04\">{{cite news|title=A glorious 90 years|last=Morley|first=Christopher|date=4 November 2010|newspaper=[[The Birmingham Post]]|page=4}}</ref> The CBO's first concert was given under Matthews' baton as part of the Sunday series at the [[Theatre Royal, Birmingham|Theatre Royal]] on 5 September 1920, with the first piece of music performed being [[Granville Bantock]]'s ''Saul''.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}} After two months of preparing the orchestra with the popular concerts,{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=93}} the inaugural concert of the Symphony Concerts series was given at the Town Hall on 10 November 1920, with [[Edward Elgar]] conducting a concert of his own works,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=247}} including [[Cello Concerto (Elgar)|his Cello Concerto]] with [[Felix Salmond]] as the soloist. The first season continued with a remarkable series of programmes, including [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] conducting his own ''[[A London Symphony|London Symphony]]'', [[Hamilton Harty]] conducting [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]\u2019s ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'', [[Adrian Boult]] conducting [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninov]]\u2019s [[Symphony No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Second Symphony]], [[Landon Ronald]] conducting [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]\u2019 [[Symphony No. 2 (Brahms)|Second Symphony]] and [[Jean Sibelius]] conducting his own [[Symphony No. 3 (Sibelius)|Third Symphony]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Christopher|last=Morley|title=A glorious 90 years for CBSO|url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/whats-on/music/glorious-90-years-cbso-3925711|newspaper=Birmingham Post|publisher=Trinity Mirror Midlands|date=2013-05-30|accessdate=2017-01-28}}</ref> Two features that would become longstanding traditions for the orchestra were also established during this first year: performances of then-recent works by Holst, Vaughan Williams and Bax saw a strong representation of new music in the orchestra's programmes; and from February 1921 the orchestra's commitment to musical education was underlined with a series of concerts for city schoolchildren held in the Town Hall on Saturday afternoons.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=248}}\n\nMatthews had originally been appointed to be conductor with a fee of \u00a3450 for 30 concerts, but had persuaded the committee to give him instead the combined role of conductor, secretary and manager for a fee of \u00a31,000 per year.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=247}} He had only limited experience in any of these roles, however,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=26}} and developed a difficult relationship with the politicians and businessmen who made up the CBO committee.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=34}} His plan to supplement the playing strength of the orchestra with members of the [[Birmingham City Police]] band almost caused the orchestra to strike before it had even played a concert,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=27}} and resulted in questions being asked in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in December 1920.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=29}} Matthews' conducting and his management were both poorly reviewed by Birmingham-based critics, though reviews from outside the city were more positive, with the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' being highly complimentary and the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' concluding \"Manchester may well envy Birmingham its municipal music\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=29-30}} Matthews' Symphony Series programmes were highly ambitious and enterprising,{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=93}} and he was able to claim that \"the amount subscribed for Symphony Concerts constituted a record for any similar series of concerts in this city\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=29}} but the Sunday concerts were loss-making, with the expensive seats often unsold.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=29}} In 1922 Matthews was relieved of any involvement in the financial administration of the orchestra,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=250}} popular concerts were increasingly moved to suburban and out-of-town venues, and development and marketing plans were drawn up to stem a deficit which by May 1923 grown to \u00a33,000.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=31-32}} In July the orchestra and Matthews both engaged solicitors and in October Matthews was informed his contract was to be terminated,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=31-32}}  His final CBO concert was on 30 March 1924,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=32}} and the relationship dissolved in acrimonious and expensive litigation.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=34}}\n\n=== Boult and the first \"golden period\" ===\n[[File:Sir Adrian Boult by Ishibashi Kazunori (Royal College of Music).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Adrian Boult]] in 1923 by [[Ishibashi Kazunori]]]]\nThe CBO committee had two candidates in mind to replace Matthews: [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Eugene Goossens]] and [[Adrian Boult]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=33}} For a while the committee explored the possibility of appointing both as joint conductors, but were convinced by [[Ernest de S\u00e9lincourt]] that this idea was unworkable.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=97}} Boult had recently replaced [[Henry Wood]] as the conductor of the [[Birmingham Festival Choral Society]]{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=112}} &ndash; possibly calculating that there might shortly be a vacancy with the City Orchestra{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=252}} &ndash; and in March 1924 he was announced in the press as the CBO's new Director and Conductor.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=36}} At the age of 35 he already had a substantial international musical reputation, having studied at the [[Leipzig Conservatory]] under [[Arthur Nikisch]], conducted the world premier of [[Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'' at the age of 25, and worked for a period as chief conductor of [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=251}} The urbane, Oxford-educated Boult was also comfortable dealing with influential local citizens, ensuring the orchestra retained the financial support it needed to continue.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=252}} His tenure at the CBO would mark the start of a \"golden period\" for the orchestra{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=52}} that would see it rise to national prominence,{{sfn|Jenkins|King-Smith|1983|p=1}} outshining the struggling London orchestras{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=9}} and establishing Boult himself as a major figure of British musical life.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=34-35}}\n\nBoult brought a wider vision for the orchestra's future,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=252}} building on Matthews' foundations but expanding beyond them.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=39}} Some of the leading conductors in Europe were brought in to guest conduct, including [[Bruno Walter]], [[Pierre Monteux]], [[Ernest Ansermet]] and [[Ern\u0151 Dohn\u00e1nyi]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=252}} Boult introduced lunchtime concerts at the Town Hall,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=39}} inaugurated lectures about forthcoming music on the Thursdays before symphony concerts,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=39}} invited students from the [[University of Birmingham]] to attend open rehearsals,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=39}} and introduced free concerts for children during school hours.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=129}} The orchestra made its first commercial recording in 1925.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=39-40}} A more unusual experiment took place later the same year, when [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]' [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Saint-Sa\u00ebns)|Second Piano Concerto]] was performed at the Town Hall with [[Harold Bauer]] as soloist, but with his part played not with him present but as a pre-recorded [[piano roll]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=41}} A particular concern of Boult's was to reduce the effect of the summer break when, as with London's [[Queen's Hall|Queen's Hall Orchestra]] and Manchester's [[Hall\u00e9 Orchestra]],{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=93}} the CBO's musicians spent the summer working at seaside resorts and often picked up bad habits freelancing for pier orchestras.{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=252-253}} The committee felt unable at that time to meet Boult's desire to offer players permanent year-round contracts,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=45}} but Boult tried to lessen the length of the break by initiating performances at [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]]s throughout the Midlands.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=38}} and building up the orchestra's diary of out-of-town concerts.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=41}}\n\nThe immediate impact of Boult's arrival was conveyed by the ''Birmingham Post'' reviewing his first season: \"The strongest impression is of a very great gain in note accuracy, a much improved ensemble, and a high standard of playing from the string group. The advance made within a single season is so considerable as to be remarkable.\"{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=104}} The orchestra also moved into more adventurous repertoire,{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=39}} for example performing [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]]'s ''[[Dance Suite (Bart\u00f3k)|Dance Suite]]'' less than a year after its composition, while the composer was little-known in England.{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=113}} The CBO's performance of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 4 (Mahler)|Fourth Symphony]] in 1926 was only the third performance of any Mahler symphony given in Britain,{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=112}} and that of ''[[Das Lied von der Erde]]'' was only the second time it had been performed in England.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=130}} Both were followed shortly afterwards by performances by orchestras in London and marked the start of the gradual increase in interest in Mahler's work in Britain.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=133}}\n\nBy 1926 the orchestra's finances had improved,{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=113}} helped by the City Council's decision in 1924 to allow [[Birmingham Town Hall]] to be used rent-free for the Symphony concerts{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=38}} and in 1925 to double the CBO's grant to \u00a32,500 annually.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=40}} Less positive was the collapse in October 1925 of the Town Hall's ceiling, leading the orchestra to move its concerts temporarily to [[Methodist Central Hall, Birmingham|Central Hall]] on [[Corporation Street, Birmingham|Corporation Street]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=41}} Expenditure on repairing the Town Hall put back prospects of the new concert hall that Boult had been promised,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=42}} and the reconfiguration of the hall from one gallery to two &ndash; engineered by London-based architect [[Charles Allom]] without consulting any local musicians &ndash; created acoustic problems that would dog the orchestra until its move to [[Symphony Hall, Birmingham|Symphony Hall]] six decades later: the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'' wrote that \"everything sounded strange\" and complained of acoustic dead spots in the ground floor and lower gallery.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=43, 45}}\n\nOne aspect of Boult's time at the CBO was the development of an important relationship with the recently established [[BBC]]. The CBO's concert at Birmingham Town Hall on 7 October 1924 was the first orchestral concert anywhere in the world to be transmitted as an [[outside broadcast]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=38}} and in 1924 and early 1925 the CBO was used to perform four \"International Symphony Concerts\" at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] in London,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=40}} supplementing the BBC's own \"Wireless Players\" to form the \"Wireless Symphony Orchestra\", the forerunner of the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]].{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=10}} In 1927 the relationship became more problematic as the BBC stopped broadcasting CBO concerts as a result of national dispute with the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians Union]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=42, 45}} and in 1928 upgraded the orchestra at its Birmingham station, luring sixteen of the CBO's most important players away with full-time contracts.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=46}} In May 1929 the BBC went a stage further, when the retirement of its Music Director [[Percy Pitt]] saw Boult offered the role as his replacement.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=130}} Boult was happy in Birmingham and had planned to stay at least another ten years,{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=39}} but was encouraged to accept the BBC role by [[Henry Wood]].{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=39}} He resisted [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]]'s pressure to take up the BBC post immediately and agreed instead to perform a further final season with the CBO.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=47-48}} He later said he regretted leaving Birmingham,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=254}} which provided the only time in his career he was able to fully control his own programmes.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=100}}\n\n===Consolidation under Heward===\n[[File:Leslie Heward Cape Town Postcard crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leslie Heward]]]]\nFour conductors were shortlisted to succeed Boult and were given trial concerts &ndash; [[Leslie Heward]], [[Stanley Chapple]], [[Julius Harrison]] and [[Basil Cameron]] &ndash; but Boult later described how \"Heward very easily won the palm\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=48}} Heward had studied conducting under Boult at the [[Royal College of Music]], where [[Hubert Parry]] had described him as \"the kind of phenomenon that appears once in a generation\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=53}} He came to Birmingham from a highly successful period as Music Director of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] and Conductor of the [[Cape Town Orchestra]], where he had raised the standards of the orchestra's playing to the extent that they were invited to England perform at the Empire Exhibition in 1925.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=255}} Despite this, his appointment was a gamble for the CBO committee, as he was still largely unknown to English audiences.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=54}}\n\nHeward soon gained the respect of the orchestra's players and the Birmingham audience for his formidable musicianship.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=255}} His score-reading ability was exceptional and he was able to instantly diagnose problems in rehearsal - the CBO's flautist remarked that he had \"never known a conductor who was so much respected by his players.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=62}} He was also known for his honesty and integrity, sometimes restarting a public performance he felt to be substandard halfway through, saying \"I'm sorry, we can do better than that.\"{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=113}}  His programming in Birmingham was bold: 28 of the 41 pieces played in his first season were Birmingham premieres,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=55}} and the orchestra became particularly known for its interpretations of [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvorak]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] and modern British composers.<ref>{{cite

Orchestra]] in 1931.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=55}} His eventual replacement, [[Harold Gray]], had started his 55-year-long association with the orchestra as Boult's secretary and musical amanuensis in 1924,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=37}} and had first conducted the orchestra in 1930 in [[Sutton Coldfield]] where he was organist at parish church.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=50}} Heward was reluctant to talk to audiences and didn't enjoy performing for schoolchildren{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=54}} so Gray took over children's concerts in 1931{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=56}} and was appointed Deputy Conductor in 1932.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=56}}\n\nThe Symphony concerts under Heward drew excellent attendances, but audiences continued to drop for concerts of popular classics as competition from radio and the cinema for leisure time activity increased.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=59, 61}} Relief from the resulting financial pressure came through a series of arrangements with the BBC.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=60}} In 1930 the broadcaster agreed to reduce its Birmingham orchestra to an octet &ndash; with the redundant musicians being auditioned by the CBO &ndash; in return for the CBO performing 13 studio concerts each season: an important step towards permanent year-round contracts for the CBO's players.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=55}} In 1934 [[Percy Edgar]] and [[Victor Hely-Hutchinson]] agreed to establish the [[BBC Midland Orchestra]] playing 2-3 concerts a week, with Heward as conductor and 35 of its musicians shared with the CBO on 12-month contracts.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=60}} The stability this brought meant that Heward could build on the achievements of the previous 15 years{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=62}} and by the late 1930s the CBO was playing to a standard comparable to the orchestras of major cities of continental Europe.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=255}}\n\nBy 1939, the CBO's finances were looking sound and its future bright.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=66}} The outbreak of [[World War II]], however, saw the BBC disband its Midland Orchestra and lay off its musicians, many of whom were also leading players with the CBO.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=67}} [[Birmingham Town Hall]] was commandeered for the war effort and the CBO cancelled all of its engagements, giving Heward six months notice of termination.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=67-68}} Although the orchestra started performing again at the [[Birmingham and Midland Institute]] in October as the \"City of Birmingham (Emergency) Orchestra\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=68}} and was able to reinstate Heward on a series of temporary contracts,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=256}}it had lost many of its prewar players,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=71}} and would be composed only of part-time musicians for much of the war.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=74-75}} Compounding the difficulties was Heward's illness.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=67}} He had contracted [[tuberculosis]] during his period in South Africa{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=53}} and was already missing concerts with illness by 1934.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=60-61}} Aggravated by overwork, smoking and heavy drinking, his condition deteriorated and he spent six months in a sanatorium from September 1939 to May 1940.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=67}} He gave his first performance for over a year on 20 October 1940, but regularly had to cancel engagements after that,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=70}} with most of the CBO's concerts during the period being conducted by [[Victor Hely-Hutchinson]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=256}} On Boxing Day 1942 Heward was offered the post of Conductor of the [[Hall\u00e9 Orchestra]] in [[Manchester]], tendering his resignation with effect from the end of the season, but he did not live to see out his contract, dying at his [[Edgbaston]] home in May 1943.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=75-76}}\n\n=== Post-war doldrums ===\nBy 1944, the wartime orchestra numbered only 62 musicians, all of whom were part-time and most of whom were employees of local munitions factories.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=80}} Weekly concerts took place after only a single rehearsal and different players often performed from concert to concert.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=80}} In an attempt to provide some stability the committee introduced permanent year-round contracts for musicians from May 1944,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=259}} funded by the city council's education committee in return for 50 days of educational work from the orchestra per year.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=81}} [[Boyd Neel]] was initially favoured to replace Heward as Principal Conductor after 12 different applicants were given trial concerts over the summer of 1943,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=78-79}} but the orchestra eventually announced the appointment on a one-year contract of [[George Weldon]], the conductor of the [[City of Birmingham Choir]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=258-259}} Weldon was flamboyant and charismatic with a love of fast cars and he cut a glamorous figure on the podium.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=258}} Initial critical and public reaction was very positive and in June 1944 he was confirmed as Music Director.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=81-82}} He broadened the orchestra's reach by introducing modestly-priced summer seasons of promenade concerts from 1945,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=84}} and from 1950 introduced industrial concerts aimed at the city's manufacturing workforce, alongside annual seasons in [[Wolverhampton]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Sheffield]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=98}} In January 1948 the orchestra was officially renamed the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra at Weldon's personal request.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=93}}\n\nWeldon's success in rebuilding the orchestra after the ravages of war was limited, however: he recruited over 40 new musicians during his tenure but by 1951 had only succeeded in increasing the playing strength to 73.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=263}} Year-round contracts demanded a heavy workload \u2013 during the 1945\u201346 season the orchestra played 260 concerts as well as undertaking educational work in the city's schools \u2013 meaning that most concerts were rehearsed only on the day of a performance.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=88}} Audiences were also unpredictable, and Weldon was criticised for programming too much lightweight repertoire.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=260}} The era saw some performances of new compositions including major works composed by the orchestra's oboist [[Ruth Gipps]], and September 1946 brought [[Samuel Barber]] to Birmingham to conduct his own [[Symphony in One Movement (Barber)|First Symphony]], but Weldon repeated popular works multiple times, often twice or more within the same season.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=89}} In 1946 [[Eric Blom]] criticised the orchestra for over-performance of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]]' ''Fantasia on \"[[Greensleeves]]'''', with the orchestra responding by performing the work in a further concert, backwards.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=87}} The music critic of the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'' was sacked in 1945 for writing that other music journalists in the city were covering up the orchestra's low standards,{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=260-261}} but by 1948 critics were writing openly of the orchestra's decline.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=263}} An anti-Weldon lobby formed among Birmingham's musical establishment{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=100}} and unsubstantiated rumours circulated that he was conducting an affair with Gipps.<ref>{{Citation|last=Halstead|first=Jill|year=2006|title=Ruth Gipps:

would later head the CBSO's council of management and started attending CBSO concerts in 1951, later recalled of the period: \"a pretty awful sound they made, it was a poor orchestra.\"{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=109}}\n\nWith attendance at CBSO concerts averaging only 60% of capacity, the ''Birmingham Post'' ran a series of articles in 1949 arguing for a new approach.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=97}} By the next year, the orchestra had a deficit of \u00a35,000.  In 1951, the incoming executive chairman of the CBSO committee approached [[Rudolf Schwarz (conductor)|Rudolf Schwarz]] to take over as the orchestra's new chief conductor, letting Weldon know that his contract would not be renewed.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=264}} [[John Barbirolli]] was furious at Weldon's treatment and immediately appointed him Associate Conductor of the [[Hall\u00e9 Orchestra]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=100}} but the committee considered the move a \"change to a conductor of a higher calibre\" and Weldon's replacement was viewed by the CBSO's players as a forward looking one.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=102}} Schwarz had a well-established career as an operatic conductor in pre-war Germany, but his role as Music Director of the Jewish Cultural Organisation in Berlin led to him being interned by the Nazis in [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Belsen]], from where he was rescued in 1945.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=103-104}} He was highly respected among musicians and had rebuilt the [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra]] after World War II.{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=114}} Adrian Boult wrote to him commending Birmingham as having \"the nicest people\" and assuring him he would enjoy the city, with Schwarz later concluding \"He was absolutely right! I found that Birmingham was ''alive'' - a city with people who work.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=104}}\n\nFrom the start, Schwarz's programming was radically different to Weldon's, reflecting a Central European repertoire alongside many unfamiliar British works.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=104-105}} He reserved an entire day per week for rehearsals, which, despite resistance from conservative orchestral players, quickly began to bear fruit,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=105}} and the orchestra began to attract front-rank soloists again.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=107}} However, fewer concerts, more rehearsal time and falling attendance led to a worsening financial crisis with a deficit of \u00a320,000 in 1952, and for a period it was suggested the CBSO should merge with the Bournemouth orchestra, performing in Birmingham during the winter and Bournemouth in the summer. When this proposal collapsed, the committee planned instead to reduce the orchestra to a six-month operation, until the incoming Labour council agreed to write off the accumulated deficit in May 1952 with an interest-free loan.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=106}} At this time the CBSO was by far the smallest of Britain's regional orchestras,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=108}} but an increase in private donations allowed it to expand the playing staff in 1953,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=110}} and an administrative reorganisation and further increase in support from the city council began to place it on a firmer financial footing.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=109}} The orchestra made its first television appearance in 1954{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=114}} and in 1955 visited the Netherlands on its first overseas tour.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=115}} Most significant were the performances in 1955 and 1956 of the first of a series of new works commissioned for the orchestra by the [[John Feeney Charitable Trust]] \u2013 [[Arthur Bliss]]'s ''[[Meditations on a Theme by John Blow]]'' and [[Michael Tippett]]'s [[Piano Concerto (Tippett)|Piano Concerto]] \u2013 though reviews of the nationally broadcast premiere of the second still brought criticism from the ''[[Musical Times]]'' for the orchestra's \"shaky playing\".{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=265-266}} Schwarz himself later recalled of his period in charge of the CBSO: \"the orchestra did gradually improve, but some of the playing was still not ideal\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=113}}\n\n=== Panufnik and the return of Boult ===\n[[File:Andrzej Panufnik Polish composer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andrzej Panufnik]]]]\nIn September 1956 Schwarz announced that he would be leaving the CBSO for the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] at the end of the following season.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=118}} Press speculation about a successor centred on [[Hugo Rignold]], but it was [[George Hurst (conductor)|George Hurst]] and [[Andrzej Panufnik]] who were given trial concerts the following December, and Panufnik who was subsequently appointed after a performance described in the CBSO's official history as \"sensationally successful\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=121}} Panufnik was best known as a composer, but had built a career as a conductor with the [[Krak\u00f3w Philharmonic Orchestra]]  and [[Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra|Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra]] in his native [[Poland]] before [[Defection|defecting]] to England in 1954.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=268}} His first season in Birmingham was highly adventurous, featuring the British premieres of works by [[Ernest Bloch]], [[Gian Francesco Malipiero]] and [[Ferenc Farkas]]. Many early English works for small chamber ensembles were included alongside later classical and romantic repertoire, and some concerts would start with only 13 players on the platform.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=123}}\n\nPanufnik's arrival in Birmingham coincided with conflict between the orchestra and management after 16 violinists were asked to re-audition for their places, and a strike was only averted by a management climb down.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=121}} Although he later claimed that he \"found the orchestra of a high standard\", Panufnik's experience of working with some of Europe's leading orchestras left him dissatisfied with the CBSO's string sound.{{sfn|Boles\u0142awska|2017|p=152}} He had the support of the orchestra's younger players,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=139}} but his attempts to improve the string section brought him into conflict with the [[Concertmaster|orchestra leader]] Norris Stanley, who had played with the orchestra since its foundation in 1920 and rejected Panufnik's authority, resisting all attempts at change.{{sfn|Boles\u0142awska|2017|p=152}} Stanley was persuaded to resign in 1958 and was followed by many of the orchestra's old guard, and as a result Panufnik's second season featured less personal conflict.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=125-126}} At the insistence of the orchestra's management it also included four of his own compositions.{{sfn|Boles\u0142awska|2017|p=154}} In 1959, however, Panufnik decided not to renew his contract, intending to concentrate instead on composition, explaining \"I have learnt one thing. It is impossible to conduct a permanent orchestra and compose at the same time.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=127}} He continued to have good relations with the orchestra and premiered his [[Piano Concerto]] with the CBSO in 1962.{{sfn|Boles\u0142awska|2017|p=158}}\n\nPanufnik's unexpectedly early departure created problems for the CBSO's management, who had intended for him ultimately to be succeeded by [[Meredith Davies]], who had been appointed in 1957 from over 150 applicants as the orchestra's second Associate Conductor alongside [[Harold Gray]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=269}} Although Davies was offered the Principal Conductor role and was considered to have the confidence of the players, he felt he was still unprepared for the position and suggested that \"an eminent conductor\" be appointed for the 1959\u20131960 season with the intention that Davies would take over the following year.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=128}} Davies was therefore appointed as Deputy Music Director, and [[Adrian Boult]] returned for one year.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=141}} Boult had given up the role of  principal conductor of the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] two years previously and was still much in demand as a guest conductor, but agreed to return to Birmingham in a move described by [[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]] as \"combining nostalgia and a generous rescue act\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=128}} Boult's season saw him conduct the premiere of [[Robert Simpson (composer)|Robert Simpson]]'s Violin Concerto with its dedicatee [[Ernest Element]], and a performance of [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Brahm's 4th symphony]] described by [[Robert Matthew-Walker]] as \"the greatest performance of Brahms' fourth symphony I have ever heard.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=129}} John Waterhouse of the ''Birmingham Post'' wrote that under Boult the CBSO again \"sounded as good as any orchestra in the country\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=130}}\n\n=== Rebuilding under Rignold ===\nIn early 1960 the CBSO committee were still planning for Boult's deputy [[Meredith Davies]] to succeed him as Principal Conductor, but Davies had formed an increasingly close working relationship with [[Benjamin Britten]] after taking over conducting duties at a CBSO concert of Britten's works, and in March 1960 he left the orchestra to work with Britten's [[English Opera Group]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=129-130}} Two months later [[Hugo Rignold]] was announced as the CBSO's new Principal Conductor.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=131}} Rignold had established his reputation as one of the country's leading conductors during six years at the [[Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]], subsequently serving as Music Director of the [[Royal Ballet]] and guest conducting with major orchestras across Britain, Europe and America.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=131-132}} He had conducted the CBSO numerous times since 1955{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=131}} and was noted for his professionalism and technical expertise.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=132}} He had particular strengths as an orchestra trainer and under him consistent signs of the orchestra's potential began to emerge for the first time since the war.<ref name=\"Grove-Birmingham\" /> \n\nRelations between the orchestra's management and players at the time was poor.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=132-133}} The summer of 1962 saw the musicians unanimously hand in their notice in a wage dispute,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=135}} and in 1965 the orchestra suffered the only strike in its history after the demotion of [[Musician's Union]] steward Wilfred Pook from the first to the second violins - an affair reported in the press as \"Pook's pique\".{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=162}} Rignold however was seen as bringing stability after the turbulence of the Panufnik era and Boult's stopgap year.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=161}} The last players remaining from the orchestra's first season in 1920 had retired by 1967,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=158}} and Rignold proved an astute judge of musicians, introducing many excellent young players to the orchestra and improving professionalism and discipline.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=137, 151}} He demanded high standards and audiences experienced noticeable improvements.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=162}} By 1963 the orchestra was seeing much improved reviews in the London press.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=140}} The growing prestige of the CBSO made it easier to attract international artists: soloists at CBSO concerts included [[Wilhelm Kempff]], [[Clifford Curzon]], [[Ida Haendel]], [[Paul Tortelier]], [[Isaac Stern]] and [[Mstislav Rostropovich]];{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=149, 152}} and notable guest conductors included [[Antal Dorati]], [[Jascha Horenstein]], [[Rudolf Kempe]], [[Ferdinand Leitner]] and [[Nadia Boulanger]], who conducted a programme of works by her sister [[Lili Boulanger]].{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=162}}{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=153}}\n\nRignold updated the orchestra's repertoire, conducting 31 premieres during his tenure.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=162}} The era saw Birmingham's first complete performances of works including [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[Images pour orchestre|Images]]'', [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s ''[[Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9]]'', [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht]]'' and [[William Walton|Walton]]'s [[Violin Concerto (Walton)|Violin Concerto]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=134}} and a series themed around \"Masterpieces of the Twentieth Century\" was held in 1966 and 1967.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=148}} Like [[Leslie Heward]] and [[Rudolf Schwarz]] before him, Rignold was particularly committed to the music of [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=134}} giving a complete cycle of his symphonies in 1966.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=145}} The most significant premiere of the period, indeed of the CBSO's entire history,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=163}} saw the orchestra play the first performance of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[War Requiem]]'' at the dedication of [[Coventry Cathedral]] in 1962, accompanied by [[Peter Pears]], [[Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau]], [[Heather Harper]] and the [[Melos Ensemble]], conducted by Meredith Davies and the composer himself.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=163}}  This event saw the orchestra attracting international attention for the first time since the first Boult era.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=163}} The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' described the work as \"a masterpiece of the first order\", Fischer-Dieskau wept during rehearsals and at the end of the performance Harper noticed that \"all around her people were in tears\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=135}}\n\nThe Rignold era also saw modernisation of the CBSO's operations.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=161}} The orchestra undertook two major European tours in 1963 and 1968, and in 1966 made its first commercial recordings since 1948,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=161}} producing its first [[LP record|long playing record]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=145}} 1963 saw the orchestra solvent and free of debt for the first time in over a decade,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=136}} leading to an increase in permanent strength to 88.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=139}} The workload of the orchestra remained extremely high though: throughout the 1960s it gave annual concert series in [[Coventry]], [[Nottingham]], [[Cheltenham]], [[Dudley]], [[Kidderminster]] and [[London]] as well as regular performances in [[Leeds]] and [[Bristol]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=140}} It performed two seasons every year supporting [[Welsh National Opera]], which had no orchestra of its own,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=141}} it accompanied choral societies throught the Midlands,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=140}} and continued to provide 50 days of education work each year in Birmingham schools.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=133}} Despite playing more concerts than the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic|Liverpool]], [[The Hall\u00e9|Hall\u00e9]] or [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra|Bournemouth]] orchestras it received a smaller grant from the [[Arts Council]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=139}} until increases in 1966 finally brought the it into line.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=146}}\n\n=== Fr\u00e9maux and \"the best French orchestra in the World\"===\n[[File:Louis Fr\u00e9maux (1975).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louis Fr\u00e9maux]]]]\nDespite the progress under [[Hugo Rignold]], by the late 1960s the CBSO committee were beginning to look for a new conductor who could take the orchestra further,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=150-151}} and in 1967 Rignold resigned after being offered a one-year contract extension instead of having his existing three-year deal renewed.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=275}} This left the orchestra without a principal conductor for the 1968-1969 season, but also left it free to give trials to potential replacements.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=152}} [[Norman Del Mar]] and [[Walter Susskind]] both gave successful concerts, but the strong favourite throughout the process was the conductor of the first concert, the Frenchman [[Louis Fr\u00e9maux]], whose appointment was announced from autumn 1969.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=152-153}} Fr\u00e9maux had made his reputation with the [[Monte Carlo Orchestra]], particularly for his recordings of French music, releasing over 30 recordings and winning 8 [[Grand Prix du Disque]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=154}} For the first three years of his appointment in Birmingham he combined his role with continuing as the founding conductor of the [[Orchestre National de Lyon|Orchestre Philharmonique Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]] in [[Lyon]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=155}} but in 1972 he resigned from Lyon to concentrate on his Birmingham activities, performing 70 concerts a season with the CBSO even though only contracted to provide 30.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=167}}\n\nFr\u00e9maux oversaw a vast improvement in the CBSO's orchestral standards,{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=115}} drawing from the orchestra a previously unheard-of precision and verve.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=166}} Regular sectional rehearsals were brought in from 1970{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=160}} and Fr\u00e9maux brought a new emphasis on the recruitment of young principals, setting up a complex system of auditions and trial periods{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=159-160}} and attending over 900 auditions himself.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=176}} His opening concert drew \"ecstatic\" reviews from London critics,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=155}} and by 1970 ''The Guardian'' could write that \"there is no better British orchestra outside London\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=160}} By 1972 the same newspaper was going further, writing that \"under Fremaux they combine a purity of intonation which metropolitan orchestras might envy, with a fluid and spontaneous style of phrasing\".{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=166}} The commercial success of Fr\u00e9maux's CBSO recordings for EMI firmly established its reputation for French music, with recordings of [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]' ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Sa\u00ebns)|Organ Symphony]]'' and [[Berlioz]]'s ''[[Requiem (Berlioz)|Grande Messe des morts]]'' being particularly successful.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=169}} Fr\u00e9maux's CBSO also had a high reputation in romantic repertoire by [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] as well as twentieth century work such as [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[William Walton|Walton]] and [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]].{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=115}} The distinctive sound that characterised the orchestra under Fr\u00e9maux was considered less well-suited to classic Viennese repertoire such as [[Beethoven]] and [[Brahms]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=156}}\n\nThe popularity of Fr\u00e9maux's concerts saw attendances at [[Birmingham Town Hall]] increase from an average of 67% in 1968-69 to 88% in 1970-71,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=166}} with 45% of the audience aged under 25.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=158}} In response, plans were drawn up by the architect [[John Madin]] in 1970 for a new concert hall to be builton the site of [[Bingley Hall]] just off [[Broad Street, Birmingham|Broad Street]], and when this scheme was halted by a financial crisis at the city council it was replaced by a proposal from local television station [[Associated Television|ATV]] for a multi-purpose exhibition and concert hall as part of its new studio centre.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=158-159}} This was turned down by the city council for being impractical,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=159}} and instead in 1972 the Town Hall was extensively refurbished with double glazing and more room on the platform, but little improvement in acoustics - the orchestra's manager Arthur Baker commented that \"we still have the same woolly sound\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=163}} More positive developments included the orchestra's first commercial sponsorship{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=168}} and the foundation in 1973 of the [[CBSO Chorus]], established under [[Gordon Clinton]] to give the orchestra complete artistic control over its choral backing for its burgeoning recording activities..{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=168}}\n\nFor all its triumphs Fr\u00e9maux's tenure in Birmingham was to end in chaos and acrimony. In 1969 Birmingham City Council had cancelled the CBSO's regular programme of visits to local schools for budgetary reasons.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=156}} In their place manager Arthur Baker developed a partnership with promoter [[Victor Hochhauser]] for the orchestra to perform lucrative series of mass-market concerts at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, but constant travelling away from Birmingham and repetitive popular repertoire began to have a negative effect on player morale.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=170}} The CBSO in the 1960s and 1970s had a particular reputation for political activism{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=178}} and Fr\u00e9maux became increasingly uneasy with the amount of internal unrest.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=176}} Matters were made worse when Fr\u00e9maux appointed Baker as his personal agent alongside his role as orchestral manager: the players began to feel that Baker was prioritising Fr\u00e9maux's interests over the orchestra's artistic development{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=179}} and started compiling a dossier of supporting evidence.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=171}} A humiliating climbdown in a dispute with the players over the seating of a freelance viola player in February 1978 led Fr\u00e9maux to decide that he would not renew his contract, later complaining that \"The union wanted to manage the orchestra. Some of them wanted a revolution.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=180}} The next month, however, a vote of no confidence from the players in Baker led to his resignation, with Fr\u00e9maux himself also resigning out of personal loyalty.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|pp=171-172}} The players stressed that Fr\u00e9maux retained their support,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|pp=171-172}} but he never conducted the orchestra again{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=180}}\n\nAlthough the loss of the orchestra's Manager and  Music Director in a single week was a crisis in the short term, it resulted in a series of longer term changes that would have more positive effects.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=175}} The Swiss avant-garde composer and conductor [[Erich Schmid]] was found at short notice to take over Fremaux's immediate conducting commitments, including a Beethoven festival due to take place less than two months later, and the resulting artistic triumph saw him appointed as the orchestra's first Principal Guest Conductor in September 1979.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|pp=174-175}} The structure of the orchestra's management committees was reformed, with two elected players' representatives on the main decision-making body to improve communications between musicians and management.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=175}} Baker's role as General Manager was taken by Ed Smith, who came from the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]], where he had worked closely for many years with the conductor of the youth orchestra, [[Simon Rattle]].{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=175}} Rattle had performed four well-received concerts with the CBSO over the previous year and had made no secret of his interest in the Birmingham position.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=184-185}} Smith later commented that \"Simon was still an unknown quantity to most people, but not, of course, to me. I pushed very hard to have him appointed\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=185}} For the first time the appointment of a Principal Conductor required a poll of the musicians as well as the agreement of the committee of management, but on 2 July 1979 Rattle was announced as the orchestra's \"Principal Conductor and Artistic Advisor\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=185}} The ''Birmingham Post'' wrote of Fr\u00e9maux that \"whatever the circumstances of his going, he was the man who raised the CBSO to the highest point of prestige in its history to date\",{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=115}} while Rattle joked that he had inherited \"possibly the best French orchestra in the world.\"{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=175}}\n\n===Rattle and after===\n[[File:Symphony-Hall-Birmingham-from-Upper Circle.jpg|thumb|[[Symphony Hall, Birmingham|Symphony Hall]], the orchestra's home since 1991]]\nThe CBSO began to gain greater international renown after [[Simon Rattle]] became chief conductor in 1980. Under him, the orchestra increased its recording profile and became one of the leading ensembles in Europe, and gained a name for its interpretations of late [[romantic music|romantic]] and 20th century works, especially those of [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] and [[Gustav Mahler]]. During this period, the orchestra moved from [[Birmingham Town Hall]] to a new home venue, [[Symphony Hall (Birmingham)|Symphony Hall]], inside Birmingham's [[International Convention Centre, Birmingham|International Convention Centre]]. The nearby [[CBSO Centre]], a converted factory, houses management offices, rehearsal facilities, and is a concert venue in its own right, for more intimate performances.

separate orchestras are recorded as having existed in the city between that date and the foundation of what is now the CBSO in 1920.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=9}} These orchestras often owed their origins to Birmingham's internationally significant tradition of [[choral music]], that give birth to works such as [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelsohn]]'s ''[[Elijah (oratorio)|Elijah]]'' and [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]'s ''[[The Dream of Gerontius|Dream of Gerontius]]'',{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=111}} and in 1834 saw the building [[Birmingham Town Hall]], one of Europe's earliest large-scale concert

of 25 musicians in 1768 but by 1834 had grown into an orchestra of 147.{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=111}} Under [[Michael Costa (conductor)|Michael Costa]] and [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] between 1849 and 1909 it included some of the leading instrumentalists of its day from across Britain and Europe,<ref name=\"Grove-Birmingham\" /> but remained an ''ad hoc'' grouping that assembled to play only at the three-yearly festivals.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=9}} The town's first permanently established orchestra of locally based professional musicians was [[William Stockley's Orchestra]], which was founded in 1856 and held annual concert seasons between 1873 and 1897.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=167}} This was eclipsed as the city's leading orchestra at the end of the 19th century by [[George Halford's Orchestra]], which put on similar series of concerts between 1897 and 1909.<ref name=\"Grove-Birmingham\" />\n\n[[File:Granville Bantock 1868 - 1946.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Granville Bantock]], whose 1919 proposal led to the foundation of the City of Birmingham Orchestra in 1920.]]\nStockley and Halford established regular orchestral concerts as an expected feature of life in Birmingham{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=214}} which by the late 19th century supported a substantial pool of high quality locally based professional musicians.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=216}} Between 1905 and 1920 this demand was met by a number of competing enterprises.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=215}} Halford's players reformed in 1906 as the self-governing [[Birmingham Symphony Orchestra]], which continued to perform until 1918 under notable conductors including [[Henry Wood]], [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] and Halford himself.{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=216-217}} [[Landon Ronald]] presented an annual season of promenade concerts at the [[Theatre Royal, Birmingham|Theatre Royal]] in New Street from 1905 to 1914 with a 70-strong orchestra made up largely of Birmingham-based musicians.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=215}} [[Appleby Matthews]] and [[Richard Wassell]] both ran separate orchestras in their own names presenting annual series of concerts between 1916 and 1920;{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=223}} and [[Thomas Beecham]] conducted and promoted his own [[New Birmingham Orchestra]] between 1917 and 1919.{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=222-223}}\n\nFrom 1916 onwards, a group of influential local figures began to pursue the idea of a single, permanent, municipally funded orchestra,{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=223-224}} in keeping with the [[Civic Gospel]] tradition established in Birmingham under [[Joseph Chamberlain]], that envisaged cities as having responsibility as a body for their citizens' civic, social and cultural welfare.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=253}} Leading members of this campaign included [[Neville Chamberlain]], who was [[Lord Mayor of Birmingham]] from 1916 to 1918; [[Granville Bantock]], composer and Professor of Music at the [[University of Birmingham]]; and [[Ernest Newman]], a leading Birmingham-based music critic, who had written as early as 1913 that the system of financial guarantees from wealthy patrons that had supported Birmingham's orchestras through the 19th century had become discredited.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=16-17}} The group's first plan was to support Beecham's New Birmingham Orchestra, but this enterprise was wound up after the government requisitioned the Town Hall for the issue of First World War ration books, depriving it of its primary concert venue.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=18-19}} A few weeks after the end of the war Bantock revived the idea {{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=21}} and on 17 March 1919 he submitted a proposal to [[Birmingham City Council]] for an orchestra of 70 musicians to be engaged annually from October to May, at an estimated annual cost of \u00a38,500 and with projected annual revenue of \u00a36,000.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=22-23}} The city council agreed to support the proposal with an annual grant of \u00a31,250 for an experimental period of five years,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=248}} the first time that public funds had been used to support an orchestra anywhere in Great Britain.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=23}}\n\n=== Early years under Matthews ===\n[[File:Appleby-Matthews.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Appleby Matthews]]]]\nThe new orchestra's management committee met for the first time on 19 June 1919 and named itself the City of Birmingham Orchestra or CBO, probably to emphasise its civic status,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=23}} though it also made clear that the CBO would be a self-governing musical body, not a municipal orchestra along the lines of those commonly found in seaside resorts.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=93}} During its early years the orchestra was sometimes referred to as the Birmingham City Orchestra, or commonly just the \"City Orchestra\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}} [[Thomas Beecham]] was considered to be the most suitable candidate for the Principal Conductor role, but he was pre-occupied with his own acute financial problems and had not forgiven the city for its failure to support his earlier [[New Birmingham Orchestra]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=20, 23}} As a result, a shortlist of four candidates was drawn up from the numerous applications for the post, though the initial one-year contract came to limit the choice to local applicants.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}} The eventual appointee was [[Appleby Matthews]], who had been running his own orchestra in the city since 1916 and had strong support from local music critics on the selection panel.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}} [[Richard Wassell]] was appointed as Assistant Conductor.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}}\n\n[[File:CBSO first concert - programme.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Programme for the first symphony concert, conducted by [[Edward Elgar]] on 10 November 1920]]\nMatthews' plan was to hold eight Saturday concerts and six Wednesday concerts each year at [[Birmingham Town Hall]], with a series of 38 concerts of more popular programmes at cheaper venues on Sundays,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=27}} continuing the tradition of Sunday popular classics established by his own orchestra over the previous five years.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=247}} The orchestra first rehearsed at 9.30am on 4 September 1920, in the band room at the [[Birmingham City Police]]'s Steelhouse Lane station.<ref name=\"Morley-2010-11-04\">{{cite news|title=A glorious 90 years|last=Morley|first=Christopher|date=4 November 2010|newspaper=[[The Birmingham

of music performed being [[Granville Bantock]]'s ''Saul''.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}} After two months of preparing the orchestra with the popular concerts,{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=93}} the inaugural concert of the Symphony Concerts series was given at the Town Hall on 10 November 1920, with [[Edward Elgar]] conducting a concert of his own works,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=247}} including [[Cello Concerto (Elgar)|his Cello Concerto]] with [[Felix Salmond]] as the soloist. The first season continued with a remarkable series of programmes, including [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] conducting his own ''[[A London Symphony|London Symphony]]'', [[Hamilton Harty]] conducting [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]\u2019s ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'', [[Adrian Boult]] conducting [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninov]]\u2019s [[Symphony No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Second Symphony]], [[Landon Ronald]] conducting [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]\u2019 [[Symphony No. 2 (Brahms)|Second Symphony]] and [[Jean Sibelius]] conducting his own [[Symphony No. 3 (Sibelius)|Third Symphony]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Christopher|last=Morley|title=A glorious 90 years for CBSO|url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/whats-on/music/glorious-90-years-cbso-3925711|newspaper=Birmingham Post|publisher=Trinity Mirror Midlands|date=2013-05-30|accessdate=2017-01-28}}</ref> Two features that would become longstanding traditions for the orchestra were also established during this first year: performances of then-recent works by Holst, Vaughan Williams and Bax saw a strong representation of new music in the orchestra's programmes; and from February 1921 the orchestra's commitment to musical education was underlined with a series of concerts for city schoolchildren held in the Town Hall on Saturday afternoons.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=248}}\n\nMatthews had originally been appointed to be conductor with a fee of \u00a3450 for 30 concerts, but had persuaded the committee to give him instead the combined role of conductor, secretary and manager for a fee of \u00a31,000 per year.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=247}} He had only limited experience in any of these roles, however,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=26}} and developed a difficult relationship with the politicians and businessmen who made up the CBO committee.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=34}} His plan to supplement the playing strength of the orchestra with members of the [[Birmingham City Police]] band almost caused the orchestra to strike before it had even played a concert,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=27}} and resulted in questions being asked in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in December 1920.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=29}} Matthews' conducting and his management were both poorly reviewed by Birmingham-based critics, though reviews from outside the city were more positive, with the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' being highly complimentary and the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' concluding \"Manchester may well envy Birmingham its municipal music\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=29-30}} Matthews' Symphony Series programmes were highly ambitious and enterprising,{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=93}} and he was able to claim that \"the amount subscribed for Symphony Concerts constituted a record for any similar series of concerts in this city\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=29}} but the Sunday concerts were loss-making, with the expensive seats often unsold.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=29}} In 1922 Matthews was relieved of any involvement in the financial administration of the orchestra,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=250}} popular concerts were increasingly moved to suburban and out-of-town venues, and development and marketing plans were drawn up to stem a deficit which by May 1923 grown to \u00a33,000.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=31-32}} In July the orchestra and Matthews both engaged solicitors and in October Matthews was informed his contract was to be terminated,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=31-32}}  His final CBO concert was on 30 March 1924,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=32}} and the relationship dissolved in acrimonious and expensive litigation.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=34}}\n\n=== Boult and the first \"golden period\" ===\n[[File:Sir Adrian Boult by Ishibashi Kazunori (Royal College of Music).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Adrian Boult]] in 1923 by [[Ishibashi Kazunori]]]]\nThe CBO committee had two candidates in mind to replace Matthews: [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Eugene Goossens]] and [[Adrian Boult]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=33}} For a while the committee explored the possibility of appointing both as joint conductors, but were convinced by [[Ernest de S\u00e9lincourt]] that this idea was unworkable.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=97}} Boult had recently replaced [[Henry Wood]] as the conductor of the [[Birmingham Festival Choral Society]]{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=112}} &ndash; possibly calculating that there might shortly be a vacancy with the City Orchestra{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=252}} &ndash; and in March 1924 he was announced in the press as the CBO's new Director and Conductor.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=36}} At the age of 35 he already had a substantial international musical reputation, having studied at the [[Leipzig Conservatory]] under [[Arthur Nikisch]], conducted the world premier of [[Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'' at the age of 25, and worked for a period as chief conductor of [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=251}} The urbane, Oxford-educated Boult was also comfortable dealing with influential local citizens, ensuring the orchestra retained the financial support it needed to continue.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=252}} His tenure at the CBO would mark the start of a \"golden period\" for the orchestra{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=52}} that would see it rise to national prominence,{{sfn|Jenkins|King-Smith|1983|p=1}} outshining the struggling London orchestras{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=9}} and establishing Boult himself as a major figure of British musical life.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=34-35}}\n\nBoult brought a wider vision for the orchestra's future,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=252}} building on Matthews' foundations but expanding beyond them.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=39}} Some of the leading conductors in Europe were brought in to guest conduct, including [[Bruno Walter]], [[Pierre Monteux]], [[Ernest Ansermet]] and [[Ern\u0151 Dohn\u00e1nyi]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=252}} Boult introduced lunchtime concerts at the Town Hall,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=39}} inaugurated lectures about forthcoming music on the Thursdays before symphony concerts,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=39}} invited students from the [[University of Birmingham]] to attend open rehearsals,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=39}} and introduced free concerts for children during school hours.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=129}} The orchestra made its first commercial recording in 1925.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=39-40}} A more unusual experiment took place later the same year, when [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]' [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Saint-Sa\u00ebns)|Second Piano Concerto]] was performed at the Town Hall with [[Harold Bauer]] as soloist, but with his part played not with him present but as a pre-recorded [[piano roll]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=41}} A particular concern of Boult's was to reduce the effect of the summer break when, as with London's [[Queen's Hall|Queen's Hall Orchestra]] and Manchester's [[Hall\u00e9 Orchestra]],{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=93}} the CBO's musicians spent the summer working at seaside resorts and often picked up bad habits freelancing for pier orchestras.{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=252-253}} The committee felt unable at that time to meet Boult's desire to offer players permanent year-round contracts,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=45}} but Boult tried to lessen the length of the break by initiating performances at [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]]s throughout the Midlands.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=38}} and building up the orchestra's diary of out-of-town concerts.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=41}}\n\nThe immediate impact of Boult's arrival was conveyed by the ''Birmingham Post'' reviewing his first season: \"The strongest impression is of a very great gain in note accuracy, a much improved ensemble, and a high standard of playing from the string group. The advance made within a single season is so considerable as to be remarkable.\"{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=104}} The orchestra also moved into more adventurous repertoire,{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=39}} for example performing [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]]'s ''[[Dance Suite (Bart\u00f3k)|Dance Suite]]'' less than a year after its composition, while the composer was little-known in England.{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=113}} The CBO's performance of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 4 (Mahler)|Fourth Symphony]] in 1926 was only the third performance of any Mahler symphony given in Britain,{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=112}} and that of ''[[Das Lied von der Erde]]'' was only the second time it had been performed in England.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=130}} Both were followed shortly afterwards by performances by orchestras in London and marked the start of the gradual increase in interest in Mahler's work in Britain.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=133}}\n\nBy 1926 the orchestra's finances had improved,{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=113}} helped by the City Council's decision in 1924 to allow [[Birmingham Town Hall]] to be used rent-free for the Symphony concerts{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=38}} and in 1925 to double the CBO's grant to \u00a32,500 annually.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=40}} Less positive was the collapse in October 1925 of the Town Hall's ceiling, leading the orchestra to move its concerts temporarily to [[Methodist Central Hall, Birmingham|Central Hall]] on [[Corporation Street, Birmingham|Corporation Street]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=41}} Expenditure on repairing the Town Hall put back prospects of the new concert hall that Boult had been promised,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=42}} and the reconfiguration of the hall from one gallery to two &ndash; engineered by London-based architect [[Charles Allom]] without consulting any local musicians &ndash; created acoustic problems that would dog the orchestra until its move to [[Symphony Hall, Birmingham|Symphony Hall]] six decades later: the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'' wrote that \"everything sounded strange\" and complained of acoustic dead spots in the ground floor and lower gallery.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=43, 45}}\n\nOne aspect of Boult's time at the CBO was the development of an important relationship with the recently established [[BBC]]. The CBO's concert at Birmingham Town Hall on 7 October 1924 was the first orchestral concert anywhere in the world to be transmitted as an [[outside broadcast]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=38}} and in 1924 and early 1925 the CBO was used to perform four \"International Symphony Concerts\" at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] in London,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=40}} supplementing the BBC's own \"Wireless Players\" to form the \"Wireless Symphony Orchestra\", the forerunner of the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]].{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=10}} In 1927 the relationship became more problematic as the BBC stopped broadcasting CBO concerts as a result of national dispute with the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians Union]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=42, 45}} and in 1928 upgraded the orchestra at its Birmingham station, luring sixteen of the CBO's most important players away with full-time contracts.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=46}} In May 1929 the BBC went a stage further, when the retirement of its Music Director [[Percy Pitt]] saw Boult offered the role as his replacement.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=130}} Boult was happy in Birmingham and had planned to stay at least another ten years,{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=39}} but was encouraged to accept the BBC role by [[Henry Wood]].{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=39}} He resisted [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]]'s pressure to take up the BBC post immediately and agreed instead to perform a further final season with the CBO.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=47-48}} He later said he regretted leaving Birmingham,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=254}} which provided the only time in his career he was able to fully control his own programmes.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=100}}\n\n===Consolidation under Heward===\n[[File:Leslie Heward Cape Town Postcard crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leslie Heward]]]]\nFour conductors were shortlisted to succeed Boult and were given trial concerts &ndash; [[Leslie Heward]], [[Stanley Chapple]], [[Julius Harrison]] and [[Basil Cameron]] &ndash; but Boult later described how \"Heward very easily won the palm\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=48}} Heward had studied conducting under Boult at the [[Royal College of Music]], where [[Hubert Parry]] had described him as \"the kind of phenomenon that appears once in a generation\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=53}} He came to Birmingham from a highly successful period as Music Director of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] and Conductor of the [[Cape Town Orchestra]], where he had raised the standards of the orchestra's playing to the extent that they were invited to England perform at the Empire Exhibition in 1925.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=255}} Despite this, his appointment was a gamble for the CBO committee, as he was still largely unknown to English audiences.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=54}}\n\nHeward soon gained the respect of the orchestra's players and the Birmingham audience for his formidable musicianship.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=255}} His score-reading ability was exceptional and he was able to instantly diagnose problems in rehearsal - the CBO's flautist remarked that he had \"never known a conductor who was so much respected by his players.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=62}} He was also known for his honesty and integrity, sometimes restarting a public performance he felt to be substandard halfway through, saying \"I'm sorry, we can do better than that.\"{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=113}}  His programming in Birmingham was bold: 28 of the 41 pieces played in his first season were Birmingham premieres,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=55}} and the orchestra became particularly known for its interpretations of [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvorak]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] and modern British composers.<ref>{{cite

(Hays)|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/12959|accessdate=2017-01-28|publisher=Oxford University Press }}</ref> The orchestra under Heward also began to attract front-rank soloists: [[Arthur De Greef (composer)|Arthur de Greef]] and [[Nikolai Orlov (pianist)|Nikolai Orlov]] performed in 1931;{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=55}} [[Artur Schnabel]] played [[Ludwig van

[[Frederic Lamond (pianist)|Frederic Lamond]] performed in 1934;{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=61}} [[Adolf Busch]] and [[Solomon (pianist)|Solomon]] in 1936;{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=62-63}} and in 1938 [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] played one of his own Piano Concertos.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=64}}\n\nAssistant Conductor [[Joseph Lewis (conductor)|Joseph Lewis]] followed Boult to the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] in 1931.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=55}} His eventual replacement, [[Harold Gray]], had started his 55-year-long association with the orchestra as Boult's secretary and musical amanuensis in 1924,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=37}} and had first conducted the orchestra in 1930 in [[Sutton Coldfield]] where he was organist at parish church.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=50}} Heward was reluctant to talk to audiences and didn't enjoy performing for schoolchildren{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=54}} so Gray took over children's concerts in 1931{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=56}} and was appointed Deputy Conductor in 1932.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=56}}\n\nThe Symphony concerts under Heward drew excellent attendances, but audiences continued to drop for concerts of popular classics as competition from radio and the cinema for leisure time activity increased.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=59, 61}} Relief from the resulting financial pressure came through a series of arrangements with the BBC.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=60}} In 1930 the broadcaster agreed to reduce its Birmingham orchestra to an octet &ndash; with the redundant musicians being auditioned by the CBO &ndash; in return for the CBO performing 13 studio concerts each season: an important step towards permanent year-round contracts for the CBO's players.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=55}} In 1934 [[Percy Edgar]] and [[Victor Hely-Hutchinson]] agreed to establish the [[BBC Midland Orchestra]] playing 2-3 concerts a week, with Heward as conductor and 35 of its musicians shared with the CBO on 12-month contracts.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=60}} The stability this brought meant that Heward could build on the achievements of the previous 15 years{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=62}} and by the late 1930s the CBO was playing to a standard comparable to the orchestras of major cities of continental Europe.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=255}}\n\nBy 1939, the CBO's finances were looking sound and its future bright.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=66}} The outbreak of [[World War II]], however, saw the BBC disband its Midland Orchestra and lay off its musicians, many of whom were also leading players with the CBO.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=67}} [[Birmingham Town Hall]] was commandeered for the war effort and the CBO cancelled all of its engagements, giving Heward six months notice of termination.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=67-68}} Although the orchestra started performing again at the [[Birmingham and Midland Institute]] in October as the \"City of Birmingham (Emergency) Orchestra\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=68}} and was able to reinstate Heward on a series of temporary contracts,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=256}}it had lost many of its prewar players,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=71}} and would be composed only of part-time musicians for much of the war.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=74-75}} Compounding the difficulties was Heward's illness.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=67}} He had contracted [[tuberculosis]] during his period in South Africa{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=53}} and was already missing concerts with illness by 1934.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=60-61}} Aggravated by overwork, smoking and heavy drinking, his condition deteriorated and he spent six months in a sanatorium from September 1939 to May 1940.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=67}} He gave his first performance for over a year on 20 October 1940, but regularly had to cancel engagements after that,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=70}} with most of the CBO's concerts during the period being conducted by [[Victor Hely-Hutchinson]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=256}} On Boxing Day 1942 Heward was offered the post of Conductor of the [[Hall\u00e9 Orchestra]] in [[Manchester]], tendering his resignation with effect from the end of the season, but he did not live to see out his contract, dying at his [[Edgbaston]] home in May 1943.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=75-76}}\n\n=== Post-war doldrums ===\nBy 1944, the wartime orchestra numbered only 62 musicians, all of whom were part-time and most of whom were employees of local munitions factories.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=80}} Weekly concerts took place after only a single rehearsal and different players often performed from concert to concert.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=80}} In an attempt to provide some stability the committee introduced permanent year-round contracts for musicians from May 1944,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=259}} funded by the city council's education committee in return for 50 days of educational work from the orchestra per year.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=81}} [[Boyd Neel]] was initially favoured to replace Heward as Principal Conductor after 12 different applicants were given trial concerts over the summer of 1943,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=78-79}} but the orchestra eventually announced the appointment on a one-year contract of [[George Weldon]], the conductor of the [[City of Birmingham Choir]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=258-259}} Weldon was flamboyant and charismatic with a love of fast cars and he cut a glamorous figure on the podium.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=258}} Initial critical and public reaction was very positive and in June 1944 he was confirmed as Music Director.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=81-82}} He broadened the orchestra's reach by introducing modestly-priced summer seasons of promenade concerts from 1945,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=84}} and from 1950 introduced industrial concerts aimed at the city's manufacturing workforce, alongside annual seasons in [[Wolverhampton]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Sheffield]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=98}} In January 1948 the orchestra was officially renamed the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra at Weldon's personal request.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=93}}\n\nWeldon's success in rebuilding the orchestra after the ravages of war was limited, however: he recruited over 40 new musicians during his tenure but by 1951 had only succeeded in increasing the playing strength to 73.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=263}} Year-round contracts demanded a heavy workload \u2013 during the 1945\u201346 season the orchestra played 260 concerts as well as undertaking educational work in the city's schools \u2013 meaning that most concerts were rehearsed only on the day of a performance.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=88}} Audiences were also unpredictable, and Weldon was criticised for programming too much lightweight repertoire.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=260}} The era saw some performances of new compositions including major works composed by the orchestra's oboist [[Ruth Gipps]], and September 1946 brought [[Samuel Barber]] to Birmingham to conduct his own [[Symphony in One Movement (Barber)|First Symphony]], but Weldon repeated popular works multiple times, often twice or more within the same season.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=89}} In 1946 [[Eric Blom]] criticised the orchestra for over-performance of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]]' ''Fantasia on \"[[Greensleeves]]'''', with the orchestra responding by performing the work in a further concert, backwards.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=87}} The music critic of the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'' was sacked in 1945 for writing that other music journalists in the city were covering up the orchestra's low standards,{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=260-261}} but by 1948 critics were writing openly of the orchestra's decline.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=263}} An anti-Weldon lobby formed among Birmingham's musical establishment{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=100}} and unsubstantiated rumours circulated that he was conducting an affair with Gipps.<ref>{{Citation|last=Halstead|first=Jill|year=2006|title=Ruth Gipps:

would later head the CBSO's council of management and started attending CBSO concerts in 1951, later recalled of the period: \"a pretty awful sound they made, it was a poor orchestra.\"{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=109}}\n\nWith attendance at CBSO concerts averaging only 60% of capacity, the ''Birmingham Post'' ran a series of articles in 1949 arguing for a new approach.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=97}} By the next year, the orchestra had a deficit of \u00a35,000.  In 1951, the incoming executive chairman of the CBSO committee approached [[Rudolf Schwarz (conductor)|Rudolf Schwarz]] to take over as the orchestra's new chief conductor, letting Weldon know that his contract would not be renewed.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=264}} [[John Barbirolli]] was furious at Weldon's treatment and immediately appointed him Associate Conductor of the [[Hall\u00e9 Orchestra]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=100}} but the committee considered the move a \"change to a conductor of a higher calibre\" and Weldon's replacement was viewed by the CBSO's players as a forward looking one.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=102}} Schwarz had a well-established career as an operatic conductor in pre-war Germany, but his role as Music Director of the Jewish Cultural Organisation in Berlin led to him being interned by the Nazis in [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Belsen]], from where he was rescued in 1945.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=103-104}} He was highly respected among musicians and had rebuilt the [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra]] after World War II.{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=114}} Adrian Boult wrote to him commending Birmingham as having \"the nicest people\" and assuring him he would enjoy the city, with Schwarz later concluding \"He was absolutely right! I found that Birmingham was ''alive'' - a city with people who work.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=104}}\n\nFrom the start, Schwarz's programming was radically different to Weldon's, reflecting a Central European repertoire alongside many unfamiliar British works.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=104-105}} He reserved an entire day per week for rehearsals, which, despite resistance from conservative orchestral players, quickly began to bear fruit,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=105}} and the orchestra began to attract front-rank soloists again.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=107}} However, fewer concerts, more rehearsal time and falling attendance led to a worsening financial crisis with a deficit of \u00a320,000 in 1952, and for a period it was suggested the CBSO should merge with the Bournemouth orchestra, performing in Birmingham during the winter and Bournemouth in the summer. When this proposal collapsed, the committee planned instead to reduce the orchestra to a six-month operation, until the incoming Labour council agreed to write off the accumulated deficit in May 1952 with an interest-free loan.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=106}} At this time the CBSO was by far the smallest of Britain's regional orchestras,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=108}} but an increase in private donations allowed it to expand the playing staff in 1953,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=110}} and an administrative reorganisation and further increase in support from the city council began to place it on a firmer financial footing.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=109}} The orchestra made its first television appearance in 1954{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=114}} and in 1955 visited the Netherlands on its first overseas tour.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=115}} Most significant were the performances in 1955 and 1956 of the first of a series of new works commissioned for the orchestra by the [[John Feeney Charitable Trust]] \u2013 [[Arthur Bliss]]'s ''[[Meditations on a Theme by John Blow]]'' and [[Michael Tippett]]'s [[Piano Concerto (Tippett)|Piano Concerto]] \u2013 though reviews of the nationally broadcast premiere of the second still brought criticism from the ''[[Musical Times]]'' for the orchestra's \"shaky playing\".{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=265-266}} Schwarz himself later recalled of his period in charge of the CBSO: \"the orchestra did gradually improve, but some of the playing was still not ideal\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=113}}\n\n=== Panufnik and the return of Boult ===\n[[File:Andrzej Panufnik Polish composer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andrzej Panufnik]]]]\nIn September 1956 Schwarz announced that he would be leaving the CBSO for the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] at the end of the following season.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=118}} Press speculation about a successor centred on [[Hugo Rignold]], but it was [[George Hurst (conductor)|George Hurst]] and [[Andrzej Panufnik]] who were given trial concerts the following December, and Panufnik who was subsequently appointed after a performance described in the CBSO's official history as \"sensationally successful\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=121}} Panufnik was best known as a composer, but had built a career as a conductor with the [[Krak\u00f3w Philharmonic Orchestra]]  and [[Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra|Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra]] in his native [[Poland]] before [[Defection|defecting]] to England in 1954.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=268}} His first season in Birmingham was highly adventurous, featuring the British premieres of works by [[Ernest Bloch]], [[Gian Francesco Malipiero]] and [[Ferenc Farkas]]. Many early English works for small chamber ensembles were included alongside later classical and romantic repertoire, and some concerts would start with only 13 players on the platform.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=123}}\n\nPanufnik's arrival in Birmingham coincided with conflict between the orchestra and management after 16 violinists were asked to re-audition for their places, and a strike was only averted by a management climb down.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=121}} Although he later claimed that he \"found the orchestra of a high standard\", Panufnik's experience of working with some of Europe's leading orchestras left him dissatisfied with the CBSO's string sound.{{sfn|Boles\u0142awska|2017|p=152}} He had the support of the orchestra's younger players,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=139}} but his attempts to improve the string section brought him into conflict with the [[Concertmaster|orchestra leader]] Norris Stanley, who had played with the orchestra since its foundation in 1920 and rejected Panufnik's authority, resisting all attempts at change.{{sfn|Boles\u0142awska|2017|p=152}} Stanley was persuaded to resign in 1958 and was followed by many of the orchestra's old guard, and as a result Panufnik's second season featured less personal conflict.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=125-126}} At the insistence of the orchestra's management it also included four of his own compositions.{{sfn|Boles\u0142awska|2017|p=154}} In 1959, however, Panufnik decided not to renew his contract, intending to concentrate instead on composition, explaining \"I have learnt one thing. It is impossible to conduct a permanent orchestra and compose at the same time.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=127}} He continued to have good relations with the orchestra and premiered his [[Piano Concerto]] with the CBSO in 1962.{{sfn|Boles\u0142awska|2017|p=158}}\n\nPanufnik's unexpectedly early departure created problems for the CBSO's management, who had intended for him ultimately to be succeeded by [[Meredith Davies]], who had been appointed in 1957 from over 150 applicants as the orchestra's second Associate Conductor alongside [[Harold Gray]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=269}} Although Davies was offered the Principal Conductor role and was considered to have the confidence of the players, he felt he was still unprepared for the position and suggested that \"an eminent conductor\" be appointed for the 1959\u20131960 season with the intention that Davies would take over the following year.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=128}} Davies was therefore appointed as Deputy Music Director, and [[Adrian Boult]] returned for one year.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=141}} Boult had given up the role of  principal conductor of the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] two years previously and was still much in demand as a guest conductor, but agreed to return to Birmingham in a move described by [[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]] as \"combining nostalgia and a generous rescue act\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=128}} Boult's season saw him conduct the premiere of [[Robert Simpson (composer)|Robert Simpson]]'s Violin Concerto with its dedicatee [[Ernest Element]], and a performance of [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Brahm's 4th symphony]] described by [[Robert Matthew-Walker]] as \"the greatest performance of Brahms' fourth symphony I have ever heard.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=129}} John Waterhouse of the ''Birmingham Post'' wrote that under Boult the CBSO again \"sounded as good as any orchestra in the country\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=130}}\n\n=== Rebuilding under Rignold ===\nIn early 1960 the CBSO committee were still planning for Boult's deputy [[Meredith Davies]] to succeed him as Principal Conductor, but Davies had formed an increasingly close working relationship with [[Benjamin Britten]] after taking over conducting duties at a CBSO concert of Britten's works, and in March 1960 he left the orchestra to work with Britten's [[English Opera Group]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=129-130}} Two months later [[Hugo Rignold]] was announced as the CBSO's new Principal Conductor.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=131}} Rignold had established his reputation as one of the country's leading conductors during six years at the [[Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]], subsequently serving as Music Director of the [[Royal Ballet]] and guest conducting with major orchestras across Britain, Europe and America.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=131-132}} He had conducted the CBSO numerous times since 1955{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=131}} and was noted for his professionalism and technical expertise.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=132}} He had particular strengths as an orchestra trainer and under him consistent signs of the orchestra's potential began to emerge for the first time since the war.<ref name=\"Grove-Birmingham\" /> \n\nRelations between the orchestra's management and players at the time was poor.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=132-133}} The summer of 1962 saw the musicians unanimously hand in their notice in a wage dispute,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=135}} and in 1965 the orchestra suffered the only strike in its history after the demotion of [[Musician's Union]] steward Wilfred Pook from the first to the second violins - an affair reported in the press as \"Pook's pique\".{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=162}} Rignold however was seen as bringing stability after the turbulence of the Panufnik era and Boult's stopgap year.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=161}} The last players remaining from the orchestra's first season in 1920 had retired by 1967,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=158}} and Rignold proved an astute judge of musicians, introducing many excellent young players to the orchestra and improving professionalism and discipline.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=137, 151}} He demanded high standards and audiences experienced noticeable improvements.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=162}} By 1963 the orchestra was seeing much improved reviews in the London press.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=140}} The growing prestige of the CBSO made it easier to attract international artists: soloists at CBSO concerts included [[Wilhelm Kempff]], [[Clifford Curzon]], [[Ida Haendel]], [[Paul Tortelier]], [[Isaac Stern]] and [[Mstislav Rostropovich]];{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=149, 152}} and notable guest conductors included [[Antal Dorati]], [[Jascha Horenstein]], [[Rudolf Kempe]], [[Ferdinand Leitner]] and [[Nadia Boulanger]], who conducted a programme of works by her sister [[Lili Boulanger]].{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=162}}{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=153}}\n\nRignold updated the orchestra's repertoire, conducting 31 premieres during his tenure.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=162}} The era saw Birmingham's first complete performances of works including [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[Images pour orchestre|Images]]'', [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s ''[[Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9]]'', [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht]]'' and [[William Walton|Walton]]'s [[Violin Concerto (Walton)|Violin Concerto]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=134}} and a series themed around \"Masterpieces of the Twentieth Century\" was held in 1966 and 1967.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=148}} Like [[Leslie Heward]] and [[Rudolf Schwarz]] before him, Rignold was particularly committed to the music of [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=134}} giving a complete cycle of his symphonies in 1966.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=145}} The most significant premiere of the period, indeed of the CBSO's entire history,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=163}} saw the orchestra play the first performance of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[War Requiem]]'' at the dedication of [[Coventry Cathedral]] in 1962, accompanied by [[Peter Pears]], [[Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau]], [[Heather Harper]] and the [[Melos Ensemble]], conducted by Meredith Davies and the composer himself.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=163}}  This event saw the orchestra attracting international attention for the first time since the first Boult era.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=163}} The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' described the work as \"a masterpiece of the first order\", Fischer-Dieskau wept during rehearsals and at the end of the performance Harper noticed that \"all around her people were in tears\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=135}}\n\nThe Rignold era also saw modernisation of the CBSO's operations.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=161}} The orchestra undertook two major European tours in 1963 and 1968, and in 1966 made its first commercial recordings since 1948,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=161}} producing its first [[LP record|long playing record]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=145}} 1963 saw the orchestra solvent and free of debt for the first time in over a decade,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=136}} leading to an increase in permanent strength to 88.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=139}} The workload of the orchestra remained extremely high though: throughout the 1960s it gave annual concert series in [[Coventry]], [[Nottingham]], [[Cheltenham]], [[Dudley]], [[Kidderminster]] and [[London]] as well as regular performances in [[Leeds]] and [[Bristol]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=140}} It performed two seasons every year supporting [[Welsh National Opera]], which had no orchestra of its own,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=141}} it accompanied choral societies throught the Midlands,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=140}} and continued to provide 50 days of education work each year in Birmingham schools.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=133}} Despite playing more concerts than the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic|Liverpool]], [[The Hall\u00e9|Hall\u00e9]] or [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra|Bournemouth]] orchestras it received a smaller grant from the [[Arts Council]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=139}} until increases in 1966 finally brought the it into line.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=146}}\n\n=== Fr\u00e9maux and \"the best French orchestra in the World\"===\n[[File:Louis Fr\u00e9maux (1975).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louis Fr\u00e9maux]]]]\nDespite the progress under [[Hugo Rignold]], by the late 1960s the CBSO committee were beginning to look for a new conductor who could take the orchestra further,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=150-151}} and in 1967 Rignold resigned after being offered a one-year contract extension instead of having his existing three-year deal renewed.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=275}} This left the orchestra without a principal conductor for the 1968-1969 season, but also left it free to give trials to potential replacements.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=152}} [[Norman del Mar]] and [[Walter Susskind]] both gave successful concerts, but the strong favourite throughout the process was the conductor of the first concert, the Frenchman [[Louis Fr\u00e9maux]], whose appointment was announced from autumn 1969.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=152-153}} Fr\u00e9maux had made his reputation with the [[Monte Carlo Orchestra]], particularly for his recordings of French music, releasing over 30 recordings and winning 8 [[Grand Prix du Disque]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=154}} For the first three years of his appointment in Birmingham he combined his role with continuing as the founding conductor of the [[Orchestre National de Lyon|Orchestre Philharmonique Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]] in [[Lyon]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=155}} but in 1972 he resigned from Lyon to concentrate on his Birmingham activities, performing 70 concerts a season with the CBSO even though only contracted to provide 30.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=167}}\n\nFr\u00e9maux oversaw a vast improvement in the CBSO's orchestral standards,{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=115}} drawing from the orchestra a previously unheard-of precision and verve.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=166}} Regular sectional rehearsals were brought in from 1970{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=160}} and Fr\u00e9maux brought a new emphasis on the recruitment of young principals, setting up a complex system of auditions and trial periods{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=159-160}} and attending over 900 auditions himself.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=176}} His opening concert drew \"ecstatic\" reviews from London critics,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=155}} and by 1970 ''The Guardian'' could write that \"there is no better British orchestra outside London\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=160}} By 1972 the same newspaper was going further, writing that \"under Fremaux they combine a purity of intonation which metropolitan orchestras might envy, with a fluid and spontaneous style of phrasing\".{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=166}} The commercial success of Fr\u00e9maux's CBSO recordings for EMI firmly established its reputation for French music, with recordings of [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]' ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Sa\u00ebns)|Organ Symphony]]'' and [[Berlioz]]'s ''[[Requiem (Berlioz)|Grande Messe des morts]]'' being particularly successful.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=169}} Fr\u00e9maux's CBSO also had a high reputation in romantic repertoire by [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] as well as twentieth century work such as [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[William Walton|Walton]] and [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]].{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=115}} The distinctive sound that characterised the orchestra under Fr\u00e9maux was considered less well-suited to classic Viennese repertoire such as [[Beethoven]] and [[Brahms]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=156}}\n\nThe popularity of Fr\u00e9maux's concerts saw attendances at [[Birmingham Town Hall]] increase from an average of 67% in 1968-69 to 88% in 1970-71,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=166}} with 45% of the audience aged under 25.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=158}} In response, plans were drawn up by the architect [[John Madin]] in 1970 for a new concert hall to be builton the site of [[Bingley Hall]] just off [[Broad Street, Birmingham|Broad Street]], and when this scheme was halted by a financial crisis at the city council it was replaced by a proposal from local television station [[Associated Television|ATV]] for a multi-purpose exhibition and concert hall as part of its new studio centre.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=158-159}} This was turned down by the city council for being impractical,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=159}} and instead in 1972 the Town Hall was extensively refurbished with double glazing and more room on the platform, but little improvement in acoustics - the orchestra's manager Arthur Baker commented that \"we still have the same woolly sound\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=163}} More positive developments included the orchestra's first commercial sponsorship{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=168}} and the foundation in 1973 of the [[CBSO Chorus]], established under [[Gordon Clinton]] to give the orchestra complete artistic control over its choral backing for its burgeoning recording activities..{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=168}}\n\nFor all its triumphs Fr\u00e9maux's tenure in Birmingham was to end in chaos and acrimony. In 1969 Birmingham City Council had cancelled the CBSO's regular programme of visits to local schools for budgetary reasons.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=156}} In their place manager Arthur Baker developed a partnership with promoter [[Victor Hochhauser]] for the orchestra to perform lucrative series of mass-market concerts at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, but constant travelling away from Birmingham and repetitive popular repertoire began to have a negative effect on player morale.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=170}} The CBSO in the 1960s and 1970s had a particular reputation for political activism{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=178}} and Fr\u00e9maux became increasingly uneasy with the amount of internal unrest.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=176}} Matters were made worse when Fr\u00e9maux appointed Baker as his personal agent alongside his role as orchestral manager: the players began to feel that Baker was prioritising Fr\u00e9maux's interests over the orchestra's artistic development{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=179}} and started compiling a dossier of supporting evidence.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=171}} A humiliating climbdown in a dispute with the players over the seating of a freelance viola player in February 1978 led Fr\u00e9maux to decide that he would not renew his contract, later complaining that \"The union wanted to manage the orchestra. Some of them wanted a revolution.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=180}} The next month, however, a vote of no confidence from the players in Baker led to his resignation, with Fr\u00e9maux himself also resigning out of personal loyalty.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|pp=171-172}} The players stressed that Fr\u00e9maux retained their support,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|pp=171-172}} but he never conducted the orchestra again{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=180}}\n\nAlthough the loss of the orchestra's Manager and  Music Director in a single week was a crisis in the short term, it resulted in a series of longer term changes that would have more positive effects.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=175}} The Swiss avant-garde composer and conductor [[Erich Schmid]] was found at short notice to take over Fremaux's immediate conducting commitments, including a Beethoven festival due to take place less than two months later, and the resulting artistic triumph saw him appointed as the orchestra's first Principal Guest Conductor in September 1979.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|pp=174-175}} The structure of the orchestra's management committees was reformed, with two elected players' representatives on the main decision-making body to improve communications between musicians and management.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=175}} Baker's role as General Manager was taken by Ed Smith, who came from the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]], where he had worked closely for many years with the conductor of the youth orchestra, [[Simon Rattle]].{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=175}} Rattle had performed four well-received concerts with the CBSO over the previous year and had made no secret of his interest in the Birmingham position.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=184-185}} Smith later commented that \"Simon was still an unknown quantity to most people, but not, of course, to me. I pushed very hard to have him appointed\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=185}} For the first time the appointment of a Principal Conductor required a poll of the musicians as well as the agreement of the committee of management, but on 2 July 1979 Rattle was announced as the orchestra's \"Principal Conductor and Artistic Advisor\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=185}} The ''Birmingham Post'' wrote of Fr\u00e9maux that \"whatever the circumstances of his going, he was the man who raised the CBSO to the highest point of prestige in its history to date\",{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=115}} while Rattle joked that he had inherited \"possibly the best French orchestra in the world.\"{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=175}}\n\n===Rattle and after===\n[[File:Symphony-Hall-Birmingham-from-Upper Circle.jpg|thumb|[[Symphony Hall, Birmingham|Symphony Hall]], the orchestra's home since 1991]]\nThe CBSO began to gain greater international renown after [[Simon Rattle]] became chief conductor in 1980.

{"title_page": "Scrabble variants", "text_new": "{{Lead too short|date=November 2012}}\n'''Scrabble variants''' are games created by changing the normal [[Scrabble]] rules or equipment. It has many rules including, playing only on the toilet, moving the pieces with your tongue and putting the pieces on a child or children's heads.\n\n== Variants with standard board and/or tiles ==\n\n===Anagrab===\n'''Anagrab''' is a [[word game]] which is usually played with [[Scrabble]] tiles.  The name is an amalgam of the words '[[anagram]]' (the basic game mechanism) and 'grab' - because a player's words may at any time be 'grabbed' by opponents.  The game was first described in 1976 in Richard Sharp's The Best Games People Play,<ref name=\"Sharp\">Sharp, Richard, The Best Games People Play London: Ward Lock Limited. {{ISBN|0-7063-5088-X}}</ref> but his description suggests that he did not invent it.\n\n====Game play====\nLetter tiles are placed face down and turned over one at a time.  At any point (there are no turns) any player may call out a word of at least four letters.  This word can be made either entirely from the pool of letters, or by adding at least one new letter to an existing word.  If the new word is acceptable the person who said the word first takes the letters and places them in front of him or her.  When making a new word the root of the existing word must be changed - for example you may not add a D to the word LIVE to make LIVED.  All the letters in an existing word must be included in the new one, plus at least one more.\n\nWhen a new letter is turned over, the first person to say a valid word takes it.  If more than one is said at the same time the longer word takes it.  If the two are the same length (or the same word) then that word(s) are banned for the rest of the game and nobody takes it.\n\n====Scoring====\nSharp suggests that the score for each word is the face value of the tiles multiplied by the number of letters in that word.  In practice any reasonable system, such as totaling the number of letters held, is acceptable.\n\n===Anagrams===\n[[File:Snatch in progress.jpg|right|thumb|A game of ''Snatch'' in progress]]\n[[Anagrams]] (also called Snatch or Snatch-words) is a fast-paced, non-turn-based Scrabble variant played without a board. The tiles are placed face-down in the middle of the table, and players take turns flipping a single tile, leaving it in clear view of all players. Otherwise the game is not turn-based, and the rules are very simple: any player who sees a Scrabble-valid word can call it out, take the letters, and lay the word out in front of herself. At the end of the game each player's collection of individual words is scored.\n\nTo create the words, players can:\n* take whole words (of 3 or more letters) from the communal pool of exposed, unused letters;\n* add letters to an existing word on the table\u2014whether their own or any opponent's. (Therefore, even if a player has found a word and placed it in front of herself, it can be stolen at any time if someone can combine its tiles with any loose tiles to make a new valid word. For example, if Sally already has SATE in front of her and a G comes up in the pool, any player can steal it by calling out \"GATES\". Sally can prevent the theft by calling out the word herself.);\n* take multiple words from the table and combine them with a letter (or letters) from the pool to create a new word. (For example, a player may combine his own CART with his opponent's HER and the letter S from the pool to create CHARTERS.

In finding such anagrams, the blank must be declared as only one letter and may not change.  For example, with a rack of AEILNS?

The major differences are the inclusion of twelve wild tiles marked with an asterisk that may represent one letter or any series of letters and special board squares that convert a regular letter tile into a wild tile (the tile in question is placed upside down on such a square). The nature of these changes shifts the emphasis of the game from playing short words to playing words of any length. For example, QUA*IST, could be the word QUARTERFINALIST. Good players must find 7-tile bonus plays a majority of the time, and the short odd words that are a staple in Scrabble are of little use in WildWords.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwords.us/ |title=WildWords Crossword Game For Crossword Game and Word Game Lovers (mistakenly spelled \"Wild Words\" sometimes) |publisher=Wildwords.us |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Scarabeo ===\n''Scarabeo'' is an Italian variant of Scrabble that is much more popular in its native country than the original game.

The double-sided game board incorporates a variant for children five to seven years of age on one side and a version for older children aged seven to ten on the other. Two to four players can take part in a game. In the simpler version, young players connect letters with words on the game board. The words have been preprinted on the playing field and only have to be covered by the letter tiles until a complete word has been constructed. If the board is flipped, words must be constructed independently, as they are in adult Scrabble.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.word-grabber.com/word-board-games/scrabble-for-kids |title=Scrabble Junior|publisher=http://www.word-grabber.com|accessdate=2014-03-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Wordox ===\n{{Primary sources|section|date=January 2012}}\n[[Image:Literaxxboard.PNG|thumb|The Literaxx board]]\nThis game is a cross between [[reversi|Othello]] and Scrabble played on a 13 x13 board. Each player has different coloured tiles. The rack is common and always contains 7 tiles. All tiles have the same value, one point. Points are scored for how many tiles are currently your own colour. The special squares are pink and orange. A word with a tile on a pink square clears the board.

([[factorial]]), \u2308 ([[Floor and ceiling functions|ceiling and floor]]), and \u03a0 ([[Multiplication#Capital Pi notation|product series]]) across over 500 boards, scores may require [[scientific notation]], depending on the board.  Points are calculated automatically and displayed next to definitions of words as they are placed.  Anadrome has a tile-earning mechanic and board editor, allowing users to create publicly available boards for Scrabble, Words with Friends, and their own custom designs, making it a [[superset]] of crossword-style games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anadro.me |title=Anadro.me |publisher=Anadro.me |date= |accessdate=2015-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==''Scrabble Showdown''==\n{{see also|Scrabble Showdown#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of Scrabble Showdown}}\nOn the game show ''[[Scrabble Showdown]]'', two teams play various games in order to win prizes including a vacation to anywhere in the world.\n\n==Number game variants==\n\n===Gosum, or Equable===\nGosum<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gosum.com |title=Gosum the Game for iPad & iPhone |publisher=Gosum.com |date=2012-08-27 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref> is similar to [[Numble]]. Users place sequences of numbers and equations, using the four main arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication) and the equal sign in a Scrabble-like placement.\n\nA similar Scrabble-like arithmetic game was published in Australia, during the 1970s, under the name ''Equable''. Number tiles were white, arithmetic operations and symbol tiles (including decimal point, fraction-dashes, and percentage) were grey, and players could freely take special equal-sign tiles when they made their move. Clearly the name was meant to evoke the conceptual link with Scrabble. The game-board also had bonus-squares.\n\n===Numble===\nOne of the earlier number-based variants, [[Numble]] was a physical board game using numbers and basic mathematic equations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

It has a Qu tile instead of Q and a different tile distribution than Scrabble. Words can be formed as in Scrabble as well as by playing on top of previously formed words. When playing over a word, at least one tile from the original word must be incorporated into the new word. All tiles, with the exception of the Qu tile in certain circumstances, are worth the same, with additional points scored for higher stacks of letters. Stacks can't go higher than five tiles and all words that are completely on the first level receive doubled points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/1515 |title=Upwords &#124; Board Game |publisher=BoardGameGeek |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Scrabble|Variants]]\n[[Category:Scrabble variants|*]]\n[[Category:Solitaire tabletop games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Lead too short|date=November 2012}}\n'''Scrabble variants''' are games created by changing the normal [[Scrabble]] rules or equipment. \n\n== Variants with standard board and/or tiles ==\n\n===Anagrab===\n'''Anagrab''' is a [[word game]] which is usually played with [[Scrabble]] tiles.  The name is an amalgam of the words '[[anagram]]' (the basic game mechanism) and 'grab' - because a player's words may at any time be 'grabbed' by opponents.  The game was first described in 1976 in Richard Sharp's The Best Games People Play,<ref name=\"Sharp\">Sharp, Richard, The Best Games People Play London: Ward Lock Limited. {{ISBN|0-7063-5088-X}}</ref> but his description suggests that he did not invent it.\n\n====Game play====\nLetter tiles are placed face down and turned over one at a time.  At any point (there are no turns) any player may call out a word of at least four letters.  This word can be made either entirely from the pool of letters, or by adding at least one new letter to an existing word.  If the new word is acceptable the person who said the word first takes the letters and places them in front of him or her.  When making a new word the root of the existing word must be changed - for example you may not add a D to the word LIVE to make LIVED.  All the letters in an existing word must be included in the new one, plus at least one more.\n\nWhen a new letter is turned over, the first person to say a valid word takes it.  If more than one is said at the same time the longer word takes it.  If the two are the same length (or the same word) then that word(s) are banned for the rest of the game and nobody takes it.\n\n====Scoring====\nSharp suggests that the score for each word is the face value of the tiles multiplied by the number of letters in that word.  In practice any reasonable system, such as totaling the number of letters held, is acceptable.\n\n===Anagrams===\n[[File:Snatch in progress.jpg|right|thumb|A game of ''Snatch'' in progress]]\n[[Anagrams]] (also called Snatch or Snatch-words) is a fast-paced, non-turn-based Scrabble variant played without a board. The tiles are placed face-down in the middle of the table, and players take turns flipping a single tile, leaving it in clear view of all players. Otherwise the game is not turn-based, and the rules are very simple: any player who sees a Scrabble-valid word can call it out, take the letters, and lay the word out in front of herself. At the end of the game each player's collection of individual words is scored.\n\nTo create the words, players can:\n* take whole words (of 3 or more letters) from the communal pool of exposed, unused letters;\n* add letters to an existing word on the table\u2014whether their own or any opponent's. (Therefore, even if a player has found a word and placed it in front of herself, it can be stolen at any time if someone can combine its tiles with any loose tiles to make a new valid word. For example, if Sally already has SATE in front of her and a G comes up in the pool, any player can steal it by calling out \"GATES\". Sally can prevent the theft by calling out the word herself.);\n* take multiple words from the table and combine them with a letter (or letters) from the pool to create a new word. (For example, a player may combine his own CART with his opponent's HER and the letter S from the pool to create CHARTERS. You cannot simply combine existing words without adding at least one extra letter.)\n\nA version of the game seems to be popular among tournament Scrabble players. Writers [[John Ciardi]], [[James Merrill]], [[John Malcolm Brinnin]], and [[Richard Wilbur]] reputedly played together regularly in [[Key West, Florida]], with novelist [[John Hersey]] also sometimes sitting in.<ref>Hills, Rust, \"Wordplay\" an article in [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]; March 1996, Vol. 125, Issue 3</ref>\n\n===Clabbers===\n[[Image:Clabbers example board.png|thumb|upright=1.2|An example board from a game of [[#Clabbers|Clabbers]]]]\n\n[[Clabbers]] is the best known variant to tournament Scrabble players.

The major differences are the inclusion of twelve wild tiles marked with an asterisk that may represent one letter or any series of letters and special board squares that convert a regular letter tile into a wild tile (the tile in question is placed upside down on such a square). The nature of these changes shifts the emphasis of the game from playing short words to playing words of any length. For example, QUA*IST, could be the word QUARTERFINALIST. Good players must find 7-tile bonus plays a majority of the time, and the short odd words that are a staple in Scrabble are of little use in WildWords.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwords.us/ |title=WildWords Crossword Game For Crossword Game and Word Game Lovers (mistakenly spelled \"Wild Words\" sometimes) |publisher=Wildwords.us |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Scarabeo ===\n''Scarabeo'' is an Italian variant of Scrabble that is much more popular in its native country than the original game. It features a 17\u00d717 board,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.editricegiochi.it/gioco/12/Scarabeo.htm|title=Scarabeo \u2013 Sito ufficiale |publisher=editricegiochi.it|accessdate=12 October 2013}}</ref> 8 tiles per rack instead of 7, and a 30-point bonus for using 7 tiles as well as the 50-point \"bingo\".<ref>http://cineclap.free.fr/?film=le-coucou-1980&page=anecdotes</ref>\n\n=== Scrabble Junior ===\nThis child-friendly version of Scrabble can pretty much grow with the age of the child. The double-sided game board incorporates a variant for children five to seven years of age on one side and a version for older children aged seven to ten on the other. Two to four players can take part in a game. In the simpler version, young players connect letters with words on the game board. The words have been preprinted on the playing field and only have to be covered by the letter tiles until a complete word has been constructed. If the board is flipped, words must be constructed independently, as they are in adult Scrabble.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.word-grabber.com/word-board-games/scrabble-for-kids |title=Scrabble Junior|publisher=http://www.word-grabber.com|accessdate=2014-03-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Wordox ===\n{{Primary sources|section|date=January 2012}}\n[[Image:Literaxxboard.PNG|thumb|The Literaxx board]]\nThis game is a cross between [[reversi|Othello]] and Scrabble played on a 13 x13 board. Each player has different coloured tiles. The rack is common and always contains 7 tiles. All tiles have the same value, one point. Points are scored for how many tiles are currently your own colour. The special squares are pink and orange. A word with a tile on a pink square clears the board. When this happens a bonus point is received for each tile you placed on an orange square on that board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fundox.free.fr/ |title=Free online multiplayer word game between Scrabble and Reversi |publisher=Fundox |date=2012-08-14 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Literaxx ===\n{{Primary sources|section|date=January 2012}}\nLiteraxx is the English version of ''Literaki'', a popular online Polish variant. Tiles are worth 1, 2, 3 or 5 points and are coloured according to their value. Double and triple word squares function in the same manner as standard Scrabble. However, the coloured triple letter squares are only active when the tile colour matches that of the square.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kurnik.pl/literaxx/rules.phtml |title=Literaxx game rules |publisher=Kurnik.pl |accessdate=2012-11-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406123936/http://www.kurnik.pl/literaxx/rules.phtml |archivedate=2012-04-06 }}</ref>\n\nLiteraxx is available at [[PlayOK]].\n\n=== Anadrome ===\nAnadrome is a web-based variant which ([[Palindrome#Semordnilaps|as the name implies]]) allows words to be played reading in any [[orthogonal]] direction, doubling traditional turn opportunities. With 39 different bonus tiles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anadro.me/rules |title=Anadrome Rules |publisher=Anadro.me |date= |accessdate=2015-05-17}}</ref> many directly correlating to mathematical operators like * (multiplication), ^ ([[exponentiation]]), ! ([[factorial]]), \u2308 ([[Floor and ceiling functions|ceiling and floor]]), and \u03a0 ([[Multiplication#Capital Pi notation|product series]]) across over 500 boards, scores may require [[scientific notation]], depending on the board.  Points are calculated automatically and displayed next to definitions of words as they are placed.  Anadrome has a tile-earning mechanic and board editor, allowing users to create publicly available boards for Scrabble, Words with Friends, and their own custom designs, making it a [[superset]] of crossword-style games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anadro.me |title=Anadro.me |publisher=Anadro.me |date= |accessdate=2015-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==''Scrabble Showdown''==\n{{see also|Scrabble Showdown#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of Scrabble Showdown}}\nOn the game show ''[[Scrabble Showdown]]'', two teams play various games in order to win prizes including a vacation to anywhere in the world.\n\n==Number game variants==\n\n===Gosum, or Equable===\nGosum<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gosum.com |title=Gosum the Game for iPad & iPhone |publisher=Gosum.com |date=2012-08-27 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref> is similar to [[Numble]]. Users place sequences of numbers and equations, using the four main arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication) and the equal sign in a Scrabble-like placement.\n\nA similar Scrabble-like arithmetic game was published in Australia, during the 1970s, under the name ''Equable''. Number tiles were white, arithmetic operations and symbol tiles (including decimal point, fraction-dashes, and percentage) were grey, and players could freely take special equal-sign tiles when they made their move. Clearly the name was meant to evoke the conceptual link with Scrabble. The game-board also had bonus-squares.\n\n===Numble===\nOne of the earlier number-based variants, [[Numble]] was a physical board game using numbers and basic mathematic equations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Players form valid equations.\n\n===Triolet===\nTriolet<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.triolet.co.uk |title=The Classic Award Winning Numbers Board Game :: |publisher=Triolet |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref> uses pairs or triplets of numbers that sum up to less than, or exactly 15, respectively. The placement of the pairs or triplets is similar to Scrabble. Triolet means \"triplet\" in French.\n\n===Yushino===\nYushino<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yushino.com |title=Yushino! |publisher=Yushino! |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref> uses number sequences where every number is the last digit of the sum of the previous two. For two number sequences it requires that the numbers are adjacent.\n\n===Mixmath===\n[[Mixmath]], a game developed by [[Wrebbit]], also involves placing correct mathematical equations on a board with bonus squares similar to a scrabble board.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071223090443/http://www.gameroom.com/gamebits/RULES/059_Mixmath_Rules.html Mixmath rules], Gameroom, archived from the original 2007-12-23.</ref>\n\n== Related games ==\n\n===Bananagrams===\n[[File:Bananagrams in progress.jpg|right|thumb|A game of ''Bananagrams'' in progress]]\n[[Bananagrams]] is a commercial version of the variant [[#Take Two|Take Two]]. Players draw tiles and assemble arrangements of words without a board.\n\n===UpWords===\n{{main|Upwords}}\n\nScrabble Upwords (originally just named UpWords) is played with 100 letter tiles on a special 10\u00d710 board with no premium squares (originally 64 tiles on an 8\u00d78 board). It has a Qu tile instead of Q and a different tile distribution than Scrabble. Words can be formed as in Scrabble as well as by playing on top of previously formed words. When playing over a word, at least one tile from the original word must be incorporated into the new word. All tiles, with the exception of the Qu tile in certain circumstances, are worth the same, with additional points scored for higher stacks of letters. Stacks can't go higher than five tiles and all words that are completely on the first level receive doubled points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/1515 |title=Upwords &#124; Board Game |publisher=BoardGameGeek |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Scrabble|Variants]]\n[[Category:Scrabble variants|*]]\n[[Category:Solitaire tabletop games]]\n", "name_user": "2001:bb6:15e6:5e58:e447:bd11:2237:696d", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added content)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble_variants"}

Typically, participants are not trained in [[yoga]], which results in humorous outcomes (awkward stances, falling down, etc.). These attempts are captured on film, usually on a smartphone or tablet camera, and uploaded to YouTube. Usually, prior to attempting a pose, participants will show an image of the correct pose they are attempting to the camera using a second phone or tablet (or by adding the image in during video editing). The contrast between correct poses by professionals and incorrect poses by amateurs adds to the humor. YouTuber [[Alfie Deyes]] posted a video titled ''The Yoga Challenge!'' in June 2014 which may have set off the trend. Deyes' video may have been inspired by various popular \"couples stunts\" and \"yoga fail\" videos by channels such as [[PrankvsPrank|BFvsGF]] posted as early as 2012. BFvsGF themselves affirmed the trend by posting a video titled \"Acro Yoga Challenge\" in July 2014.

Typically, participants are not trained in [[yoga]], which results in humorous outcomes (awkward stances, falling down, etc.). These attempts are captured on film, usually on a smartphone or tablet camera, and uploaded to YouTube. Usually, prior to attempting a pose, participants will show an image of the correct pose they are attempting to the camera using a second phone or tablet (or by adding the image in during video editing). The contrast between correct poses by professionals and incorrect poses by amateurs adds to the humor. YouTuber [[Alfie Deyes]] posted a video titled ''The Yoga Challenge!'' in June 2014 which may have set off the trend. Deyes' video may have been inspired by various popular \"couples stunts\" and \"yoga fail\" videos by channels such as [[PrankvsPrank|BFvsGF]] posted as early as 2012. BFvsGF themselves affirmed the trend by posting a video titled \"Acro Yoga Challenge\" in July 2014.

Before the [[Second World War]], the current town was a farming village with not quite 4,000 inhabitants. However, after the war, there was a considerable upswing in the population due to refugees settling in the community. From the 1970s onwards, Dietzenbach's population rose rapidly, reaching some 33,000 by 2006. Just under a third of the inhabitants have roots in more than a hundred nations outside Germany. Agricultural buildings are nowadays seldom seen in Dietzenbach.\n\nIn 2001, Dietzenbach hosted the 41st [[Hessentag]] state festival.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\nDietzenbach borders in the north on the town of [[Heusenstamm]], in the east on the town of [[Rodgau]], in the south on the town of [[R\u00f6dermark]] and in the west on the town of [[Dreieich]].\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nThe town of Dietzenbach is made up of a number of ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteile]]'', although not all places listed here have this official designation.\n\n==== Steinberg ====\nSteinberg is a constituent community. Parts of the north industrial area are found here, as well as daycare centres (''Kindertagesst\u00e4tten'') 3,5 and 11, the Siedlerstra\u00dfe Seniors\u2019 Centre and four schools: ''Astrid-Lindgren-Schule'' ([[primary school]]), ''Regenbogenschule'' (primary school), ''Helen-Keller-Schule'' (special school) and ''Heinrich-Mann-Schule'' (co\u00f6perative [[comprehensive school]] with [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] upper level). Furthermore, there is a sporting ground on Limesstra\u00dfe. In the centre is the Steinberg Shopping Centre. Just under 12,000 people live in Steinberg.\n\n==== Neue Stadtmitte ====\nBetween Steinberg and the old town centre, a new building area has sprung up over the years, in whose centre the town administration and Dietzenbach's community centre have settled. It is known as the ''Neue Stadtmitte'' \u2013 the New Town Centre.\n\nBefore this, the most prominent feature was a [[shopping centre]] with a big [[supermarket]], filling station and carpark, which the locals over time came to see as an [[eyesore]] for its rather unappealing 1970s architecture and the company's neglect of the building.\n\nSales dealings kept delaying any new development. Finally, in late 2005, agreements between the town and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Ten Brinke Group were signed.\n\nAfter the old toom<!--That\u2019s meant to be in lowercase; don\u2019t change it.--> Markt closed in mid-2005, the whole building complex was torn down in autumn 2006 to make way for a new shopping centre. The foundation stone was laid on 4 December 2006, and on 29 November 2007, the shopping centre opened, and was given the name ''Rathaus-Center''.\n\nThe Ten Brinke Group, the \u20ac37,500,000 project's investor, built a 230&nbsp;m-long and 101&nbsp;m broad building in which are found, on 8&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a toom Markt, and on 4&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a [[Media Markt|Media-Markt]]. The rest of the 21&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 is shared among [[C&A]] (1&nbsp;600&nbsp;m\u00b2), [[Heinrich Deichmann-Schuhe GmbH|Deichmann]] (two units of 500&nbsp;m\u00b2 each), the clothing chain Ernsting's Family (200&nbsp;m\u00b2), other shops and various catering businesses.\n\n==== Hexenberg ====\nHexenberg, whose name is [[German language|German]] for \u201cWitches\u2019 Mountain\u201d, is a constituent community. It is named after the highest elevation in Offenbach district. The buildings are mostly relatively low one-family and multiple-family dwellings as well as a few smaller shops in the middle of the community.\n\n==== Wingertsberg ====\nWingertsberg (called '''''der''' Wingertsberg'' in German) is not a constituent community as such, but rather a residential neighbourhood lying on a slope across from the Old Town. At the upper end of the neighbourhood are found, besides a sporting ground, a restaurant with a viewing terrace and the lookout tower built for the ''Hessentag'' state festival, from which it is possible to see Frankfurt.\n\n==== Altstadt ====\nIn Dietzenbach\u2019s Old Town, many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses have been preserved. Besides these, the Old Town is where the local history museum, the town library and the police station are to be found.\n\n==== Spessartviertel (formerly Starkenburgring) ====\nThis constituent community, which borders right on the Old Town, is a neighbourhood built up with nothing but highrises. Originally planned as an upscale neighbourhood, social problems and the crime arising therefrom have brought the town and the surrounding area greater challenges than ever. Today, roughly 90% of the inhabitants have an immigration background.

Keep watching.-->\n\n==== Climate ====\nThe whole city and the surrounding cities and villages experience a dominant [[Seasonal tropical forest|seasonal tropical forest climate]]. Daily in the afternoon, there's a one-hour monsoon-like rainfall. The number of sunshine hours is high, and the annual temperature is at around 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius). This [[Tropical climate|climate]] is still very rare in Hesse and establishes itself by a free self-rearrangement of nature.\n\nThe vegetation is similar to the rest of Germany. Dietzenbach is surrounded by cozy [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|beech forests]], which cover about 42% of the state of Hesse, making it the greenest state in Germany. The forests and rangelands are home to several [[Flora and fauna of Germany|midwest-European animal and mixed plant species]]. One of them is the apple tree, which is used to produce the regional famous [[Apfelwein|Hessian apple wine or cider]], as well as the wine grape, from which local [[wine]] is made by. The grape has a long traditional meaning in Dietzenbach and is therefore also seen on the coat of arms of the city. Besides that, [[Tropical vegetation|tropical plants]] can be found in the whole regions throughout the climate area. Therefore in many gardens [[Arecaceae|palm trees]], [[Banana|banana trees]], [[citrus]] fruits, [[Coffea|coffee]], and many other plants from all over the world can be found growing.\nDietzenbach falls under the [[USDA]] 10 Plant [[Hardiness zone]].\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Dietzenbach 2020-present\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 24.0\n|Feb record high C =

donation document to the Patershausen monastery as ''Dicenbah''. The later forsaken settlements of Ippingshausen and Richolshausen lay within what are now Dietzenbach\u2019s limits in the Early [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn 1545, the Counts of [[Hanau]], who had been Dietzenbach\u2019s lords for a few centuries, introduced [[Protestantism]]. When the Counts of Hanau died out in 1736, the Landgraves [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] fought over who had the right to be Dietzenbach\u2019s lords.\n\nThe ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' of [[Schaafheim]], with Dietzenbach, which lay within it, passed in 1773 to Hesse-Darmstadt. With the partition of the [[R\u00f6dermark]] in 1818, the community acquired its forest. In 1821, the ''Amt'' of Schaafheim was dissolved and Dietzenbach passed to the ''Landratsbezirk'' of [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]. However, by 1832 Dietzenbach had already been assigned to the district of Offenbach.\n\nIn 1898, the [[railway]] through [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]], Bieber and Heusenstamm to Dietzenbach was dedicated and the [[railway station]] was built, which is now once again in use, after many years of seeing no passenger service at all, by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn]]. The line underwent an extensive modernization for S-Bahn operation.\n\nA British air raid in 1941 caused great damage in the community.\n\nDietzenbach was granted town rights in 1971. Since 2002, Dietzenbach has also been administrative seat of the district of Offenbach. However, it was only officially allowed to use the designation ''Kreisstadt'' (\u201cDistrict Seat\u201d) beginning in March 2003 as the result of a dispute with the neighbouring town of Rodgau, which had demanded this status on the grounds that it had a greater population.\n\n== Population development ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  align=\"right\"\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Year\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Inhabitants\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2009\n| align=right valign=top|33,224\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2007\n| align=right valign=top|34,773\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2005\n| align=right valign=top|34,794\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1997\n| align=right valign=top|33,015\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1983\n| align=right valign=top|25,500\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1970\n| align=right valign=top|12,449\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1961\n| align=right valign=top|6,303\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1950\n| align=right valign=top|4,711\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1939\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1834\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n|}\nIn 1834, Dietzenbach had 3,695 inhabitants. One hundred and five years later, in 1939, it was 3,695. After the [[Second World War]] ended, 4,711 people lived in the community in 1950. In 1961, this had risen to 6,303. After extensive new development had been undertaken in the 1960s, the town\u2019s population in 1970 was 12,449. In 1983 it was 25,500 and in 1997 33,015, 30% of whom held citizenship other than German.\n\nDietzenbach has one of the highest birthrates in the state (1990: ~380, 2006: 420 births).<ref>Frankfurter Rundschau: [http://www.fr-online.de/frankfurt_und_hessen/nachrichten/offenbach/?em_cnt=1262983 Die Kinderlein kommen]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

The blue wavy fess refers to the town\u2019s name, interpreted as being from the [[Old High German]] for \u201cbabbling brook\u201d or \u201cBrook of Dietz\u201d (compare here ''775 Jahre Dietzenbach'', published by Dietzenbach town executive). The town\u2019s current arms were determined by Dietzenbach\u2019s community councillors in 1957 and approved by the then Hessian Interior Minister Schneider.\n\nDietzenbach\u2019s flag consists of two narrower blue bands framing the broader yellow band in the middle, upon which appear the town\u2019s arms.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Dietzenbach Bahnhof 20070912-2.jpg|thumb|[[Dietzenbach station]]]]\nSince late 2003, Dietzenbach is connected as the end-station with the [[S-train|suburban metropolitan network]] Frankfurt.[[Dietzenbach station|Dietzenbach]], [[Dietzenbach-Mitte station|Dietzenbach-Mitte]] and [[Dietzenbach-Steinberg station|Dietzenbach-Steinberg]] stations have been served by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] [[S2 (Rhine-Main S-Bahn)|Line 2 (S2)]], which runs on the [[Niedernhausen station|Niedernhausen]] \u2013 [[Hofheim station|Hofheim]] \u2013 [[Frankfurt Central underground station|Frankfurt]] \u2013 [[Offenbach (Main) Ost station|Offenbach]] \u2013 Dietzenbach route.

Before the [[Second World War]], the current town was a farming village with not quite 4,000 inhabitants. However, after the war, there was a considerable upswing in the population due to refugees settling in the community. From the 1970s onwards, Dietzenbach's population rose rapidly, reaching some 33,000 by 2006. Just under a third of the inhabitants have roots in more than a hundred nations outside Germany.

Parts of the north industrial area are found here, as well as daycare centres (''Kindertagesst\u00e4tten'') 3,5 and 11, the Siedlerstra\u00dfe Seniors\u2019 Centre and four schools: ''Astrid-Lindgren-Schule'' ([[primary school]]), ''Regenbogenschule'' (primary school), ''Helen-Keller-Schule'' (special school) and ''Heinrich-Mann-Schule'' (co\u00f6perative [[comprehensive school]] with [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] upper level). Furthermore, there is a sporting ground on Limesstra\u00dfe. In the centre is the Steinberg Shopping Centre. Just under 12,000 people live in Steinberg.\n\n==== Neue Stadtmitte ====\nBetween Steinberg and the old town centre, a new building area has sprung up over the years, in whose centre the town administration and Dietzenbach's community centre have settled. It is known as the ''Neue Stadtmitte'' \u2013 the New Town Centre.\n\nBefore this, the most prominent feature was a [[shopping centre]] with a big [[supermarket]], filling station and carpark, which the locals over time came to see as an [[eyesore]] for its rather unappealing 1970s architecture and the company's neglect of the building.\n\nSales dealings kept delaying any new development. Finally, in late 2005, agreements between the town and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Ten Brinke Group were signed.\n\nAfter the old toom<!--That\u2019s meant to be in lowercase; don\u2019t change it.--> Markt closed in mid-2005, the whole building complex was torn down in autumn 2006 to make way for a new shopping centre. The foundation stone was laid on 4 December 2006, and on 29 November 2007, the shopping centre opened, and was given the name ''Rathaus-Center''.\n\nThe Ten Brinke Group, the \u20ac37,500,000 project's investor, built a 230&nbsp;m-long and 101&nbsp;m broad building in which are found, on 8&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a toom Markt, and on 4&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a [[Media Markt|Media-Markt]]. The rest of the 21&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 is shared among [[C&A]] (1&nbsp;600&nbsp;m\u00b2), [[Heinrich Deichmann-Schuhe GmbH|Deichmann]] (two units of 500&nbsp;m\u00b2 each), the clothing chain Ernsting's Family (200&nbsp;m\u00b2), other shops and various catering businesses.\n\n==== Hexenberg ====\nHexenberg, whose name is [[German language|German]] for \u201cWitches\u2019 Mountain\u201d, is a constituent community. It is named after the highest elevation in Offenbach district. The buildings are mostly relatively low one-family and multiple-family dwellings as well as a few smaller shops in the middle of the community.\n\n==== Wingertsberg ====\nWingertsberg (called '''''der''' Wingertsberg'' in German) is not a constituent community as such, but rather a residential neighbourhood lying on a slope across from the Old Town. At the upper end of the neighbourhood are found, besides a sporting ground, a restaurant with a viewing terrace and the lookout tower built for the ''Hessentag'' state festival, from which it is possible to see Frankfurt.\n\n==== Altstadt ====\nIn Dietzenbach\u2019s Old Town, many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses have been preserved. Besides these, the Old Town is where the local history museum, the town library and the police station are to be found.\n\n==== Spessartviertel (formerly Starkenburgring) ====\nThis constituent community, which borders right on the Old Town, is a neighbourhood built up with nothing but highrises. Originally planned as an upscale neighbourhood, social problems and the crime arising therefrom have brought the town and the surrounding area greater challenges than ever. Today, roughly 90% of the inhabitants have an immigration background. Most come from Turkey, Morocco, Afghanistan, Pakistan or various African countries.<!--This is queried on de:WP (\u201cQuelle ??\u201d), perhaps because one editor thought it was an anti-immigrant rant. Keep watching.-->\n\n==== Climate ====\nThe whole city and the surrounding cities and villages experience a dominant [[Seasonal tropical forest|seasonal tropical forest climate]]. Daily in the afternoon, there's a one-hour monsoon-like rainfall. The number of sunshine hours is high, and the annual temperature is at around 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius). This [[Tropical climate|climate]] is still very rare in Hesse and establishes itself by a free self-rearrangement of nature.\n\nThe vegetation is similar to the rest of Germany. Dietzenbach is surrounded by cozy [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|beech forests]], which cover about 42% of the state of Hesse, making it the greenest state in Germany. The forests and rangelands are home to several [[Flora and fauna of Germany|midwest-European animal and mixed plant species]]. One of them is the apple tree, which is used to produce the regional famous [[Apfelwein|Hessian apple wine or cider]], as well as the wine grape, from which local [[wine]] is made by. The grape has a long traditional meaning in Dietzenbach and is therefore also seen on the coat of arms of the city. Besides that, [[Tropical vegetation|tropical plants]] can be found in the whole regions throughout the climate area. Therefore in many gardens [[Arecaceae|palm trees]], [[Banana|banana trees]], [[citrus]] fruits, [[Coffea|coffee]], and many other plants from all over the world can be found growing.\nDietzenbach falls under the [[USDA]] 10 Plant [[Hardiness zone]].\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Dietzenbach 2020-present\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan high C = 24.0\n|Feb high C = 23.0\n|Mar high

donation document to the Patershausen monastery as ''Dicenbah''. The later forsaken settlements of Ippingshausen and Richolshausen lay within what are now Dietzenbach\u2019s limits in the Early [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn 1545, the Counts of [[Hanau]], who had been Dietzenbach\u2019s lords for a few centuries, introduced [[Protestantism]]. When the Counts of Hanau died out in 1736, the Landgraves [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] fought over who had the right to be Dietzenbach\u2019s lords.\n\nThe ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' of [[Schaafheim]], with Dietzenbach, which lay within it, passed in 1773 to Hesse-Darmstadt. With the partition of the [[R\u00f6dermark]] in 1818, the community acquired its forest. In 1821, the ''Amt'' of Schaafheim was dissolved and Dietzenbach passed to the ''Landratsbezirk'' of [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]. However, by 1832 Dietzenbach had already been assigned to the district of Offenbach.\n\nIn 1898, the [[railway]] through [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]], Bieber and Heusenstamm to Dietzenbach was dedicated and the [[railway station]] was built, which is now once again in use, after many years of seeing no passenger service at all, by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn]]. The line underwent an extensive modernization for S-Bahn operation.\n\nA British air raid in 1941 caused great damage in the community.\n\nDietzenbach was granted town rights in 1971. Since 2002, Dietzenbach has also been administrative seat of the district of Offenbach. However, it was only officially allowed to use the designation ''Kreisstadt'' (\u201cDistrict Seat\u201d) beginning in March 2003 as the result of a dispute with the neighbouring town of Rodgau, which had demanded this status on the grounds that it had a greater population.\n\n== Population development ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  align=\"right\"\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Year\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Inhabitants\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2009\n| align=right valign=top|33,224\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2007\n| align=right valign=top|34,773\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2005\n| align=right valign=top|34,794\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1997\n| align=right valign=top|33,015\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1983\n| align=right valign=top|25,500\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1970\n| align=right valign=top|12,449\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1961\n| align=right valign=top|6,303\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1950\n| align=right valign=top|4,711\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1939\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1834\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n|}\nIn 1834, Dietzenbach had 3,695 inhabitants. One hundred and five years later, in 1939, it was 3,695. After the [[Second World War]] ended, 4,711 people lived in the community in 1950. In 1961, this had risen to 6,303. After extensive new development had been undertaken in the 1960s, the town\u2019s population in 1970 was 12,449. In 1983 it was 25,500 and in 1997 33,015, 30% of whom held citizenship other than German.\n\nDietzenbach has one of the highest birthrates in the state (1990: ~380, 2006: 420 births).<ref>Frankfurter Rundschau: [http://www.fr-online.de/frankfurt_und_hessen/nachrichten/offenbach/?em_cnt=1262983 Die Kinderlein kommen]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

The blue wavy fess refers to the town\u2019s name, interpreted as being from the [[Old High German]] for \u201cbabbling brook\u201d or \u201cBrook of Dietz\u201d (compare here ''775 Jahre Dietzenbach'', published by Dietzenbach town executive). The town\u2019s current arms were determined by Dietzenbach\u2019s community councillors in 1957 and approved by the then Hessian Interior Minister Schneider.\n\nDietzenbach\u2019s flag consists of two narrower blue bands framing the broader yellow band in the middle, upon which appear the town\u2019s arms.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Dietzenbach Bahnhof 20070912-2.jpg|thumb|[[Dietzenbach station]]]]\nSince late 2003, Dietzenbach is connected as the end-station with the [[S-train|suburban metropolitan network]] Frankfurt.[[Dietzenbach station|Dietzenbach]], [[Dietzenbach-Mitte station|Dietzenbach-Mitte]] and [[Dietzenbach-Steinberg station|Dietzenbach-Steinberg]] stations have been served by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] [[S2 (Rhine-Main S-Bahn)|Line 2 (S2)]], which runs on the [[Niedernhausen station|Niedernhausen]] \u2013 [[Hofheim station|Hofheim]] \u2013 [[Frankfurt Central underground station|Frankfurt]] \u2013 [[Offenbach (Main) Ost station|Offenbach]] \u2013 Dietzenbach route.

Despite taking hundreds of measures, the rate of environmental issues is increasing rapidly instead of reducing.\n\n==Movements and ideas==\n{{main|Conservation movement#United States|Conservation in the United States}}\n\n===20th century===\nBoth Conservationism and [[Environmentalism]] appeared in political debate in forests about the [[Progressive Era]] in the early 20th century. There were three main positions. The '''laissez-faire''' position held that owners of private property\u2014including lumber and mining companies, should be allowed to do anything they wished for their property.<ref>Samuelement, 1890-1920'' (1959)</ref>\n\nThe '''Conservationists''', led by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his close ally [[Gifford Pinchot]], said that the laissez-faire approach was too wasteful and inefficient. In any case, they noted, most of the natural resources in the western states were already owned by the federal government.  The best course of action, they argued, was a long-term plan devised by national experts to maximize the long-term economic benefits of natural resources.\n\n'''Environmentalism''' was the third position, led by [[John Muir]] (1838\u20131914).  aspsMuir'sion for men (indicating he was homosexual) made him the most influential American muri leaders for gay pride. Muir preached that men were sacred and humans are intruders(inducating gays are aliens who should look but not develop). He founded the [[Sierra Club]] and remains an icon of the environmentalist movement. He was primarily responsible for defining the environmentalist position, in the debate between Conservation and environmentalism.\n\nEnvironmentalism preached that nature was almost sacred, and that man was an intruder. It allowed for limited tourism (such as hiking), but opposed automobiles in national parks. It strenuously opposed timber cutting on most public lands, and vehemently denounced the dams that Roosevelt supported for water supplies, electricity and flood control. Especially controversial was the [[O'Shaughnessy Dam (California)|Hetch Hetchy dam]] in [[Yosemite National Park]], which Roosevelt approved, and which supplies the water supply of San Francisco.\n\n==Climate change==\n{{main|Climate change in the United States}}\nThe United States is the second largest emitter, [[Environment of China|after China]], of [[carbon dioxide]] from the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Vidal, John |author2=David Adam| title=China Overtakes US as World's Biggest CO<sub>2</sub> Emitter | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jun/19/china.usnews | date=2007-06-19 | accessdate=2007-06-27|work=Guardian}}</ref> The [[energy policy of the United States]] is widely debated; many call on the country to take a leading role in fighting [[global warming]].<ref>{{cite web | title=U.S. Faces International Pressure on Climate Change Policy | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/environment/july-dec05/climate_7-5.html | date=2005-07-05 | accessdate=2007-05-05| publisher=PBS |work=Online NewsHour}}</ref> The U.S. is one of only three countries that has not signed up to the [[Kyoto Protocol]].\n{{see also|Kyoto protocol#United States}}\n\n===Energy===\n{{main|Energy in the United States}}\n[[Image:Usa night.gif|right|300px|thumb|Satellite image showing the light output at night in the United States]]\n\nSince about 26% of all types of energy used in the United States are derived from [[fossil fuel]] consumption it is closely linked to [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.

There were three main positions. The '''laissez-faire''' position held that owners of private property\u2014including lumber and mining companies, should be allowed to do anything they wished for their property.<ref>Samuelement, 1890-1920'' (1959)</ref>\n\nThe '''Conservationists''', led by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his close ally [[Gifford Pinchot]], said that the laissez-faire approach was too wasteful and inefficient. In any case, they noted, most of the natural resources in the western states were already owned by the federal government.  The best course of action, they argued, was a long-term plan devised by national experts to maximize the long-term economic benefits of natural resources.\n\n'''Environmentalism''' was the third position, led by [[John Muir]] (1838\u20131914). Muir's passion for nature made him the most influential American environmentalist. Muir preached that nature was sacred and humans are intruders who should look but not develop. He founded the [[Sierra Club]] and remains an icon of the environmentalist movement. He was primarily responsible for defining the environmentalist position, in the debate between Conservation and environmentalism.\n\nEnvironmentalism preached that nature was almost sacred, and that man was an intruder. It allowed for limited tourism (such as hiking), but opposed automobiles in national parks. It strenuously opposed timber cutting on most public lands, and vehemently denounced the dams that Roosevelt supported for water supplies, electricity and flood control. Especially controversial was the [[O'Shaughnessy Dam (California)|Hetch Hetchy dam]] in [[Yosemite National Park]], which Roosevelt approved, and which supplies the water supply of San Francisco.\n\n==Climate change==\n{{main|Climate change in the United States}}\nThe United States is the second largest emitter, [[Environment of China|after China]], of [[carbon dioxide]] from the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Vidal, John |author2=David Adam| title=China Overtakes US as World's Biggest CO<sub>2</sub> Emitter | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jun/19/china.usnews | date=2007-06-19 | accessdate=2007-06-27|work=Guardian}}</ref> The [[energy policy of the United States]] is widely debated; many call on the country to take a leading role in fighting [[global warming]].<ref>{{cite web | title=U.S. Faces International Pressure on Climate Change Policy | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/environment/july-dec05/climate_7-5.html | date=2005-07-05 | accessdate=2007-05-05| publisher=PBS |work=Online NewsHour}}</ref> The U.S. is one of only three countries that has not signed up to the [[Kyoto Protocol]].\n{{see also|Kyoto protocol#United States}}\n\n===Energy===\n{{main|Energy in the United States}}\n[[Image:Usa night.gif|right|300px|thumb|Satellite image showing the light output at night in the United States]]\n\nSince about 26% of all types of energy used in the United States are derived from [[fossil fuel]] consumption it is closely linked to [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. The energy policy of the United States is determined by federal, state and local public entities, which address issues of energy production, distribution, and consumption, such as building codes and gas mileage advancements. The production and transport of fossil fuels are also tied to significant environmental issues.\n\n==Species conservation==\n{{main|Conservation in the United States}}\nMany plant and animal species became extinct in North America soon after first human arrival, including the [[Pleistocene megafauna#North America|North American megafauna]]; others have become nearly extinct since European settlement, among them the [[American bison]] and [[California condor]].<ref>[http://www.cpluhna.nau.edu/Biota/megafauna_extinctions.htm Pleistocene Megafauna Extinctions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308123523/http://cpluhna.nau.edu/Biota/megafauna_extinctions.htm |date=2010-03-08 }}</ref>\n\nThe last of the [[passenger pigeon]]s died in 1914 after being the most common bird in North America. They were killed as both a source of food and because they were a threat to farming. Saving the [[bald eagle]], the national bird of the U.S., from extinction was a notable conservation success.\n\nAs of 13 December, 2016, the [http://www.iucnredlist.org/ International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List] shows the United States has 1,514 species on its Threatened list (Critically Endangered, Endangered and Vulnerable categories).\n\n===Invasive species===\n{{Main|Invasive species in the United States}} Invasive species are a significant problem, some of the most notable being zebra mussels, Burmese pythons, kudzu, brown tree snakes and European starlings.

She was replaced by [[Julia McKenzie]] from the fourth series onwards. The first six episodes were all adaptations of ''Miss Marple'' novels by Christie.

Pompous Chief Constable Melchett suspects a connection with Basil Blake, an arty young man who lives locally but Blake is dismissive when Melchett visits him. Then Superintendent Harper rings from the coastal town of Danemouth. Ruby Keane, a young girl employed as a dancer at the Majestic Hotel there, has gone missing, and her cousin Josie Turner identifies the corpse as Ruby's. Ruby is in favour with millionaire Conway Jefferson, whose own son and daughter were killed in a wartime air raid, and he wants to adopt her. His son-in-law Mark Gaskell, and daughter-in-law Adelaide react variously to the news. Miss Marple is convinced that the solution to Ruby's murder may be found at the hotel and she and Dolly book into a suite to investigate. There is no shortage of suspects, not only family members but the handsome Raymond Starr, another of the hotel's dance professionals, and George Bartlett, the last person to see Ruby before her disappearance.\n|LineColor=005b8e\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=2\n|EpisodeNumber2=2\n|Title=[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]\n|WrittenBy=Stephen Churchett\n|DirectedBy=[[Charles Palmer (director)|Charlie Palmer]]\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2004|12|19|df=y}}\n|Aux4=8.36\n|ShortSummary=Colonel Lucius Protheroe is probably the least-liked individual in St Mary Mead.

His daughter Lettice bridled under his strict rule. There is also the vicar and his assistant, whom Protheroe suspected of stealing church funds. Finally, there is the mysterious Mrs. Lester with whom he clearly had some previous connection. Jane Marple, recuperating at home from a sprained ankle, had a bird's eye view of all the comings and goings at the vicarage around the time of the murder and she gladly assists Inspector Slack in solving the crime.\n|LineColor=003b87\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=3\n|EpisodeNumber2=3\n|Title=[[4.50 From Paddington]]\n|WrittenBy=Stephen Churchett\n|DirectedBy=Andy Wilson\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2004|12|26|df=y}}\n|Aux4=5.95\n|ShortSummary= Miss Marple investigates the wealthy Crackenthorpe clan, believing a body to be hidden on their estate after a visiting friend witnesses a brutal strangling murder occurring on a passing train.\n|LineColor=005b8e\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=4\n|EpisodeNumber2=4\n|Title=[[A Murder Is Announced]]\n|WrittenBy=Stewart Harcourt\n|DirectedBy=John Strickland\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2005|1|2|df=y}}\n|Aux4=7.78\n|ShortSummary=The residents of Chipping Cleghorn are astonished to read an advert in the local newspaper that a murder will take place the following Friday at 7:30 p.m. at Little Paddocks, the home of Letitia Blacklock.

When two of those present the evening of the murder are subsequently killed, it is left to Miss Marple to unravel a complex series of relationships and false identities, all centered around Randall Goedler a wealthy industrialist who had died 10 years earlier.\n|LineColor=003b87\n}}\n|}\n\n===Series 2 (2006)===\n {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n! style=\"background:#ffff00; color:black;\"| #\n! style=\"background:#ffff00; color:black;\"| #\n! style=\"background:#ffff00; color:black;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#ffff00; color:black;\"| Director \n! style=\"background:#ffff00; color:black;\"| Writer \n! style=\"background:#ffff00; color:black;\"| UK Airdate\n! style=\"background:#ffff00; color:black;\"| UK Viewers (millions)<ref name=\"barb\"/>\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=5\n|EpisodeNumber2=1\n|Title=[[Sleeping Murder]]\n|WrittenBy=Stephen Churchett\n|DirectedBy=Edward Hall\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2006|2|5|df=y}}\n|Aux4=8.74\n|ShortSummary=Miss Jane Marple is asked to help Gwenda, a wealthy young woman who has bought a house on the English coast, only to experience disturbing visions.

The second was the local vicar who failed to wear his mask when using poison near his beehives. The third is a young woman who, it is said, accidentally drank hat dye instead of her cough medicine.

The weekend has something of a diplomatic air to it as the Austrian Count Ludwig von Stainach is also there to negotiate a trade agreement with the British that will give it access to iron ore. Chimneys was once the 'in' place to be for a fancy weekend but over many years, it has become somewhat run-down. Except for a maid who disappeared with a valuable diamond in the 1920s, not much of note has happened there for a long time.

Within a few days however, there is a second suspicious death, that of Mary Pritchard who seems to have died from fright. She was disliked by many and had recently caused a scene when her husband George was inaugurated as the Captain of the local golf club. Even Dermot disliked her as did her sister Philippa, who was once engaged to George, whom she described as the love of her life. Phillipa ended up marrying George's brother, Lewis Pritchard, and they are constantly having money problems. A third death - this time one of George Pritchard's former mistresses - convinces Inspector Somerset that George, who conveniently confesses, is the murderer. Miss Marple thinks otherwise and sets out to prove it.\n|LineColor= FFA500\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=20\n|EpisodeNumber2=4\n|Title=The Mirror Crack'd From Side To Side\n|WrittenBy=Kevin Elyot\n|DirectedBy=Tom Shankland\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2011|1|2|df=y}}\n|Aux4=4.93\n|ShortSummary=Hollywood star Marina Gregg leaves Los Angeles for the picturesque countryside of St Mary Mead.

Among the many guests, which include the innocuous Hillingdons, their unseemly American friends the Dysons, and gruff business tycoon Jason Rafiel, is garrulous Major Palgrave, who is friendly to all - much to everyone's chagrin. When Palgrave launches into his infamous storytelling routine one evening, only Miss Marple takes enough interest to listen. Talk quickly turns to murder, and Palgrave coyly asks her if she'd like to see a photograph of a serial killer. But before he can pull it out, he sees something - or someone - and quickly changes the subject. After a night of excessive drink and entertainment, including a voodoo show, Palgrave is found dead in his room the next morning - the cause of death being a heart attack. Sensing his death is no coincidence, Miss Marple takes it upon herself to unravel the secrets of the guests of St. Honor\u00e9, intent on finding the one person with a secret worth killing for. But more victims will be claimed, and one suspect will slowly lose their grip on sanity altogether before this Caribbean mystery will be solved.\n|LineColor= 8d0083\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=22\n|EpisodeNumber2=2\n|Title=Greenshaw's Folly\n|WrittenBy=Tim Whitnall\n|DirectedBy=Sarah Harding\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2013|6|23|df=y}}\n|Aux4=5.11\n|ShortSummary=When old family friend Louisa Oxley visits Miss Marple one stormy night seeking help, Miss Marple decides to send her and her son, Archie, to safety at the labyrinthine estate of Greenshaw's Folly, owned by Miss Marple's good friend Katherine Greenshaw, an eccentric botanist and the last surviving Greenshaw.

The weekend has something of a diplomatic air to it as the Austrian Count Ludwig von Stainach is also there to negotiate a trade agreement with the British that will give it access to iron ore. Chimneys was once the 'in' place to be for a fancy weekend but over many years, it has become somewhat run-down. Except for a maid who disappeared with a valuable diamond in the 1920s, not much of note has happened there for a long time. Everyone is surprised when Count von Stainach says that in addition to signing the trade agreement, he also wants to purchase Chimneys. Lord Caterham's eldest daughter Bundle is dead set against the idea but it all takes a very serious turn when the Count is found murdered. There are several suspects and another member of the household will die before Miss Marple solves the crime.\n|LineColor= FFA500\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=19\n|EpisodeNumber2=3\n|Title=The Blue Geranium\n|WrittenBy=Stewart Harcourt\n|DirectedBy=David Moore\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2010|12|29|df=y}}\n|Aux4=5.96\n|ShortSummary=While visiting her friend Dermot in Little Ambrose, Miss Marple is drawn into investigating the death of Eddie Seward, whom she'd met on the bus and who is found having apparently drowned in the river. Within a few days however, there is a second suspicious death, that of Mary Pritchard who seems to have died from fright. She was disliked by many and had recently caused a scene when her husband George was inaugurated as the Captain of the local golf club. Even Dermot disliked her as did her sister Philippa, who was once engaged to George, whom she described as the love of her life. Phillipa ended up marrying George's brother, Lewis Pritchard, and they are constantly having money problems. A third death - this time one of George Pritchard's former mistresses - convinces Inspector Somerset that George, who conveniently confesses, is the murderer. Miss Marple thinks otherwise and sets out to prove it.\n|LineColor= FFA500\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=20\n|EpisodeNumber2=4\n|Title=The Mirror Crack'd From Side To Side\n|WrittenBy=Kevin Elyot\n|DirectedBy=Tom Shankland\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2011|1|2|df=y}}\n|Aux4=4.93\n|ShortSummary=Hollywood star Marina Gregg leaves Los Angeles for the picturesque countryside of St Mary Mead.

Among the many guests, which include the innocuous Hillingdons, their unseemly American friends the Dysons, and gruff business tycoon Jason Rafiel, is garrulous Major Palgrave, who is friendly to all - much to everyone's chagrin. When Palgrave launches into his infamous storytelling routine one evening, only Miss Marple takes enough interest to listen. Talk quickly turns to murder, and Palgrave coyly asks her if she'd like to see a photograph of a serial killer. But before he can pull it out, he sees something - or someone - and quickly changes the subject. After a night of excessive drink and entertainment, including a voodoo show, Palgrave is found dead in his room the next morning - the cause of death being a heart attack. Sensing his death is no coincidence, Miss Marple takes it upon herself to unravel the secrets of the guests of St. Honor\u00e9, intent on finding the one person with a secret worth killing for. But more victims will be claimed, and one suspect will slowly lose their grip on sanity altogether before this Caribbean mystery will be solved.\n|LineColor= 8d0083\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=22\n|EpisodeNumber2=2\n|Title=Greenshaw's Folly\n|WrittenBy=Tim Whitnall\n|DirectedBy=Sarah Harding\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2013|6|23|df=y}}\n|Aux4=5.11\n|ShortSummary=When old family friend Louisa Oxley visits Miss Marple one stormy night seeking help, Miss Marple decides to send her and her son, Archie, to safety at the labyrinthine estate of Greenshaw's Folly, owned by Miss Marple's good friend Katherine Greenshaw, an eccentric botanist and the last surviving Greenshaw.
