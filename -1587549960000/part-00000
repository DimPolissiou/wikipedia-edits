The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires. Drawings and writings of children of the Spanish War were the result of a contest organized by Alfred Brauner among the children of Barcelona in 1938 on three themes: \"My life Before the War\", \"What I Saw from the War\" and \"How I See My Life after the War\". <ref name=thesis/>. It was then the beginning of their work on \"children who have lived through the war.\" 4000 drawings of refugee children and numerous essays were collected in Spain, which later, along with other drawings of children in war, offered a unique testimony of the conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of children. <ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 =Ibarz Serrat  | first1 = Virgilio  | authorlink = | title = Los dibujos infantiles de la guerra 1937-1938: el caso de la ni\u00f1a de Ballobar | doi = | journal = Diario del AltoArag\u00f3n | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2009  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref>.

These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires. Drawings and writings of children of the Spanish War were the result of a contest organized by Alfred Brauner among the children of Barcelona in 1938 on three themes: \"My life Before the War\", \"What I Saw from the War\" and \"How I See My Life after the War\". <ref name=thesis/>. It was then the beginning of their work on \"children who have lived through the war.\" 4000 drawings of refugee children and numerous essays were collected in Spain, which later, along with other drawings of children in war, offered a unique testimony of the conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of children. <ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 =Ibarz Serrat  | first1 = Virgilio  | authorlink = | title = Los dibujos infantiles de la guerra 1937-1938: el caso de la ni\u00f1a de Ballobar | doi = | journal = Diario del AltoArag\u00f3n | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2009  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref>.

These serve as meeting places for [[phreak]]ers, [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]], and [[computer security|security]] professionals.\n\nThe actual events, time-spans, and details of various themes of these conventions not only depends on the specific convention attended but also its perceived reputation. Typically the actual details of any given convention are couched in mild secrecy due to the legality of certain panels, as well as the willingness of attendees to explain themselves to law enforcement and less computer-savvy individuals (see [[hacker definition controversy]]).\n\nCommon topics include [[wardriving]], [[lockpicking]], corporate and network security, personal rights and freedoms, new technologies, as well as general 'geek' motifs. Some may also have contests and general collaborative events such as [[hackathon]]s.\n\n[[File:HackerCon Badges.jpg|thumb|right|A variety of electronic and non-electronic hacker conference badges]]\nOne facet of Hacker conferences that tends to differentiate many \"HackerCons\" from general computer security conferences, is the evolution of the conference badge. While many conferences use a fairly standard paper/plastic badge to identify attendees by name, many hacker con's have evolved to use more non-traditional badges, such as electronic PCB's with LED's, LCD screens, and can include wifi and advanced, often hidden functionality, to include games, that do not identify the individual, sometimes promoting a group identity or regional/local group affiliation. This has spurred the creation of so-called \"badgelife\" where different individuals and organizations (such as local hacker groups) may design, create, and sell or otherwise distribute a separate badge attendees wear in addition to their conference badge. These badges may be purchased, but some may have to be earned by completing a challenge at the conference. One of the rarest and most desirable badges is the [[DEF_CON#Black_Badge|DefCon Black Badge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbne9a/a-history-of-badgelife-def-cons-unlikely-obsession-with-artistic-circuit-boards |title=A History of Badgelife, Def Con's Unlikely Obsession with Artistic Circuit Boards |publisher=motherboard.vice.com |accessdate=2019-01-14}}</ref> While the use of the badges are traditionally associated with DefCon, their use has spread to other conferences.\n\n=== List of hacker conferences ===<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETIAL ORDER -->\n* AthCon, the largest hacker conference in South Eastern Europe taking place annually in Athens, Greece.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athcon.org |accessdate=May 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403092901/http://www.athcon.org/ |archivedate=April 3, 2010 | title=Internet Archive waybackmachine }}</ref>\n* [[Security BSides|BSides]], community conference that initially started in the US is now global.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.securitybsides.com |title=Security B-Sides |publisher=Securitybsides.com |accessdate=2013-04-05}}</ref>\n*[https://www.blackhoodie.re/ Blackhoodie], is a series of free, women-only reverse engineering conference offering workshops and talks.

These serve as meeting places for [[phreak]]ers, [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]], and [[computer security|security]] professionals.\n\nThe actual events, time-spans, and details of various themes of these conventions not only depends on the specific convention attended but also its perceived reputation. Typically the actual details of any given convention are couched in mild secrecy due to the legality of certain panels, as well as the willingness of attendees to explain themselves to law enforcement and less computer-savvy individuals (see [[hacker definition controversy]]).\n\nCommon topics include [[wardriving]], [[lockpicking]], corporate and network security, personal rights and freedoms, new technologies, as well as general 'geek' motifs. Some may also have contests and general collaborative events such as [[hackathon]]s.\n\n[[File:HackerCon Badges.jpg|thumb|right|A variety of electronic and non-electronic hacker conference badges]]\nOne facet of Hacker conferences that tends to differentiate many \"HackerCons\" from general computer security conferences, is the evolution of the conference badge. While many conferences use a fairly standard paper/plastic badge to identify attendees by name, many hacker con's have evolved to use more non-traditional badges, such as electronic PCB's with LED's, LCD screens, and can include wifi and advanced, often hidden functionality, to include games, that do not identify the individual, sometimes promoting a group identity or regional/local group affiliation. This has spurred the creation of so-called \"badgelife\" where different individuals and organizations (such as local hacker groups) may design, create, and sell or otherwise distribute a separate badge attendees wear in addition to their conference badge. These badges may be purchased, but some may have to be earned by completing a challenge at the conference. One of the rarest and most desirable badges is the [[DEF_CON#Black_Badge|DefCon Black Badge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbne9a/a-history-of-badgelife-def-cons-unlikely-obsession-with-artistic-circuit-boards |title=A History of Badgelife, Def Con's Unlikely Obsession with Artistic Circuit Boards |publisher=motherboard.vice.com |accessdate=2019-01-14}}</ref> While the use of the badges are traditionally associated with DefCon, their use has spread to other conferences.\n\n=== List of hacker conferences ===<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETIAL ORDER -->\n* AthCon, the largest hacker conference in South Eastern Europe taking place annually in Athens, Greece.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athcon.org |accessdate=May 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403092901/http://www.athcon.org/ |archivedate=April 3, 2010 | title=Internet Archive waybackmachine }}</ref>\n* [[Security BSides|BSides]], community conference that initially started in the US is now global.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.securitybsides.com |title=Security B-Sides |publisher=Securitybsides.com |accessdate=2013-04-05}}</ref>\n*[https://www.blackhoodie.re/ Blackhoodie], is a series of free, women-only reverse engineering conference offering workshops and talks.

Azerbaijan's regime is a curious hybrid, in which semi-presidential institutions operate in the larger context of authoritarianism. The author compares formal Constitutional provisions with the practice of politics in the country, suggesting that formal and informal sources of authority come together to enhance the effective powers of the presidency. In addition to the considerable formal powers laid out in the Constitution, Azerbaijan's president also benefits from the support of the ruling party and informal family and patronage networks. LaPorte concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of this symbiosis between formal and informal institutions in Azerbaijan's semi-presidential regime. |ref=harv }}</ref>}}\n| leader_title1                = [[President of Azerbaijan|President]]\n| leader_name1                = [[Ilham Aliyev]]\n| leader_title2                = [[Vice President of Azerbaijan|Vice President]]\n| leader_name2                = [[Mehriban Aliyeva]]\n| leader_title3                = [[Prime Minister of Azerbaijan|Prime Minister]]\n| leader_name3                = [[Ali Asadov]]\n| legislature                = [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|National Assembly]]\n| sovereignty_type                = [[History of Azerbaijan|Formation]]\n| established_event1                = [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Democratic Republic]]\n| established_date1                = 28 May 1918\n| established_event2                = [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Socialist Republic]]\n| established_date2                = 28 April 1920\n| established_event3                = Independence from [[Soviet Union]]\n| established_date3                = {{plainlist|\n* 30 August 1991 (declared)\n* 18 October 1991 (independence)\n* 25 December 1991 (completed)}}\n| established_event4                = [[Alma-Ata Protocol|Full membership into the CIS]]\n| established_date4                = 21 December 1991\n| established_event5                = [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 742|Admitted to the]] [[United Nations]]\n| established_date5                = 2 March 1992\n| established_event6                = {{nowrap|[[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] adopted}}\n| established_date6                = 12 November 1995\n| area_km2                = 86600\n| area_rank                = 112th\n| area_sq_mi                = 33436 <!-- Do not remove [[WP:MOSNUM]] -->\n| percent_water                = 1.6\n| population_estimate                = 10,027,874<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2020-02-09|title=Az\u0259rbaycanda \u0259hali say\u0131 da art\u0131b, bo\u015fanmalar da\u2026 -

The top or highest tier of the government is the Executive Power headed by President. The President appoints the Cabinet of Ministers and other high-ranking officials.

In June 2012, the President approved the new Regulation, which granted additional powers to Local Executive Authorities, strengthening their dominant position in Azerbaijan's local affairs<ref>{{cite web |title=Az\u0259rbaycan Prezidentinin R\u0259smi internet s\u0259hif\u0259si |url=https://president.az/ |website=president.az |language=az}}</ref> Chapter 9 of the Constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic addresses major issues of local self-government, such as the legal status of municipalities, types of local self-government bodies, their basic powers and relationships to other official entities. The other nominal tier of governance is municipalities (''B\u0259l\u0259diy\u0259'') and members of municipalities are elected by a general vote in Municipal elections every five years. Currently, there are 1,607 municipalities across the country. The Law on Municipal Elections and the Law on the Status of Municipalities were the first to be adopted in the field of local government (2 July 1999). The Law on Municipal Service regulates the activities of municipal employees, their rights, duties, labor conditions and social benefits, and outlines the structure of the executive apparatus and the organization of municipal service. The Law on the Status of Municipalities regulates the role and structure of municipal bodies and outlines state guarantees of legal and financial autonomy. The law pays special attention to the adoption and execution of municipal programs concerning social protection, social and economic development, and the local environment.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution.

The oldest versions of the Book of Dede Korkut consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among Turkic peoples living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves \"Turcoman\" rather than \"Oghuz,\" had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen.

Azerbaijan's regime is a curious hybrid, in which semi-presidential institutions operate in the larger context of authoritarianism. The author compares formal Constitutional provisions with the practice of politics in the country, suggesting that formal and informal sources of authority come together to enhance the effective powers of the presidency. In addition to the considerable formal powers laid out in the Constitution, Azerbaijan's president also benefits from the support of the ruling party and informal family and patronage networks. LaPorte concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of this symbiosis between formal and informal institutions in Azerbaijan's semi-presidential regime. |ref=harv }}</ref>}}\n| leader_title1                = [[President of Azerbaijan|President]]\n| leader_name1                = [[Ilham Aliyev]]\n| leader_title2                = [[Vice President of Azerbaijan|Vice President]]\n| leader_name2                = [[Mehriban Aliyeva]]\n| leader_title3                = [[Prime Minister of Azerbaijan|Prime Minister]]\n| leader_name3                = [[Ali Asadov]]\n| legislature                = [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|National Assembly]]\n| sovereignty_type                = [[History of Azerbaijan|Formation]]\n| established_event1                = [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Democratic Republic]]\n| established_date1                = 28 May 1918\n| established_event2                = [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Socialist Republic]]\n| established_date2                = 28 April 1920\n| established_event3                = Independence from [[Soviet Union]]\n| established_date3                = {{plainlist|\n* 30 August 1991 (declared)\n* 18 October 1991 (independence)\n* 25 December 1991 (completed)}}\n| established_event4                = [[Alma-Ata Protocol|Full membership into the CIS]]\n| established_date4                = 21 December 1991\n| established_event5                = [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 742|Admitted to the]] [[United Nations]]\n| established_date5                = 2 March 1992\n| established_event6                = {{nowrap|[[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] adopted}}\n| established_date6                = 12 November 1995\n| area_km2                = 86600\n| area_rank                = 112th\n| area_sq_mi                = 33436 <!-- Do not remove [[WP:MOSNUM]] -->\n| percent_water                = 1.6\n| population_estimate                = 10,027,874<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2020-02-09|title=Az\u0259rbaycanda \u0259hali say\u0131 da art\u0131b, bo\u015fanmalar da\u2026 -

The top or highest tier of the government is the Executive Power headed by President. The President appoints the Cabinet of Ministers and other high-ranking officials.

In June 2012, the President approved the new Regulation, which granted additional powers to Local Executive Authorities, strengthening their dominant position in Azerbaijan's local affairs<ref>{{cite web |title=Az\u0259rbaycan Prezidentinin R\u0259smi internet s\u0259hif\u0259si |url=https://president.az/ |website=president.az |language=az}}</ref> Chapter 9 of the Constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic addresses major issues of local self-government, such as the legal status of municipalities, types of local self-government bodies, their basic powers and relationships to other official entities. The other nominal tier of governance is municipalities (''B\u0259l\u0259diy\u0259'') and members of municipalities are elected by a general vote in Municipal elections every five years. Currently, there are 1,607 municipalities across the country. The Law on Municipal Elections and the Law on the Status of Municipalities were the first to be adopted in the field of local government (2 July 1999). The Law on Municipal Service regulates the activities of municipal employees, their rights, duties, labor conditions and social benefits, and outlines the structure of the executive apparatus and the organization of municipal service. The Law on the Status of Municipalities regulates the role and structure of municipal bodies and outlines state guarantees of legal and financial autonomy. The law pays special attention to the adoption and execution of municipal programs concerning social protection, social and economic development, and the local environment.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution.

The oldest versions of the Book of Dede Korkut consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among Turkic peoples living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves \"Turcoman\" rather than \"Oghuz,\" had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen.

The decision to release the Phaeton was, in part, a response to Mercedes' decision to compete directly with Volkswagen in the European marketplace with the low cost [[Mercedes-Benz A-Class#W168|A-Class]].\n\nIt was also intended to support the Volkswagen brand image. Although the [[Volkswagen Group]] already has a direct competitor in the full sized luxury segment, the [[Audi A8]], the Phaeton was intended to be more of a comfort oriented limousine, like the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]] and [[Lexus LS]], while the Audi A8 and [[BMW 7 Series]] are more sport oriented.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/car/02q3/volkswagen_phaeton_4motion_w-12-first_drive_review |title=Volkswagen Phaeton 4MOTION W-12 |department= First Drive Review - Auto Reviews |work=Car and Driver |date= |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/tests/comparison/living-large/page_6_-_living_large_page_6 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217101312/http://www.roadandtrack.com/tests/comparison/living-large/page_6_-_living_large_page_6 |archive-date=2011-02-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nInitial development of the Phaeton, given the internal project code VW611, began with Pi\u00ebch giving his engineers a list of ten parameters the car needed to fulfill.

This included new LED running lights, bi-xenon headlights and a new bumper with LED fog lights. The rear [[LED]] clusters were altered to mimic those found on facelifted Touran, Sharan, the new Touareg and the new Passat.\n\nThe interior benefited from some new technologies, but retained the 2009 MY layout. The Phaeton was offered as a normal wheelbase and long wheelbase models, with five seat layout or an optional four seat interior. In the five seat version, the front seats can be adjusted 12 ways. Standard features include all wheel drive, air suspension, and four zone automatic climate control. A multifunction steering wheel can be ordered in leather or wood leather.\n\n===New technologies===\n*[[Automatic Distance Control]] adaptive cruise control with new Stop&Go function\n*[[Front

(EBC), with emergency [[Brake Assist]] (BA).\n\nThe electronic differential lock (EDL) employed by Volkswagen is not, as the name suggests, a differential lock at all. Sensors monitor wheel speeds across an individual driven axle, and if one wheel is rotating substantially faster than the other (i.e. slipping) the EDL system momentarily brakes it. This effectively transfers power to the other wheel.\n\nVolkswagen was developing an electric version, but replaced it with their MEB2 platform for 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-geneva-motor-show/tesla-model-s-forces-radical-rethink-next-volkswagen-phaeton|title=Tesla Model S forces radical rethink for next Volkswagen Phaeton - Autocar|author=|date=|website=www.autocar.co.uk|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Volkswagen Phideon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n\n{{Volkswagen}}\n{{Volkswagen (Europe) timeline 1980 to date}}\n{{Volkswagen (North America) timeline 1980 to date}}\n\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 2002]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:2010s cars]]\n[[Category:Volkswagen vehicles|Phaeton]]\n[[Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Flagship vehicles]]\n[[Category:Full-size vehicles]]\n[[Category:Luxury vehicles]]\n[[Category:Limousines]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Cars powered by VR engines]]\n", "name_user": "Rawja", "label": "safe", "comment": "\"was\" produced, no longer \"is\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Phaeton"}

According to an interview with Nintendo game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the concept involved focusing on a new form of player interaction. \"The consensus was that power isn't everything for a console. Too many powerful consoles can't coexist. It's like having only ferocious [[dinosaur]]s. They might fight and hasten their own extinction.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2006/tc20061116_750580.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201013947/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2006/tc20061116_750580.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 1, 2006|title=The Big Ideas Behind Nintendo's Wii|date=December 1, 2006|access-date=August 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, game [[game engine|engineers]] and [[Game designer|designers]] were brought together to develop the concept further. By 2005 the controller interface had taken form, but a public showing at that year's [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) was canceled. Miyamoto stated that the company \"had some troubleshooting to do. So we decided not to reveal the controller and instead we displayed just the console.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> Nintendo president [[Satoru Iwata]] later unveiled and demonstrated the [[Wii Remote]] at the September [[Tokyo Game Show]].<ref name=\"TGSspeech\" />\n\nThe Wii also has a DVD player that could only be accessed if it was hacked<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/157099/hack-how-to-play-dvd-movies-on-your-nintendo-wii.html|title=Hack: How to play DVD movies on your Nintendo Wii|date=2009-01-14|website=PCWorld|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>.

Designer Ken'ichiro Ashida noted, \"We had the DS on our minds as we worked on the Wii. We thought about copying the DS's touch-panel interface and even came up with a prototype.\" The idea was eventually rejected because of the notion that the two gaming systems would be identical.

Third-party developers often skipped the Wii instead of making games for all three consoles simultaneously (\"blockbusters like the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' franchise either never arrive on Nintendo hardware or show up in neutered form\"). ''Forbes'' observed that of the most successful games of 2011 (''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]], [[Mass Effect 3]], [[Portal 2]], [[L.A. Noire]], [[Battlefield 3]], [[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]''), although all were released for PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, only ''Modern Warfare 3'' received a Wii version which was also the least positively received port of the game. The lack of third-party games may be exacerbated in the future, as Nintendo faces the \"dilemma of having fallen out of sync with its rivals in the console cycle\"; Microsoft and Sony would design their consoles to be more powerful than the [[Wii U]]. Strong third-party titles are seen as a key sign of a gaming console's health.<ref name=\"theglobeandmail\">{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/video-games/controller-freak/whats-wrong-with-nintendo/article2219854/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=What's wrong with Nintendo? | date=October 31, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/04/26/nintendo-reports-461-2m-in-losses-is-selling-3ds-below-cost/ | title=Nintendo Reports $461.2M in Losses | work=Forbes | first=Paul | last=Tassi | date=April 26, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/05/10/sony-posts-record-losses-as-playstation-sales-drop/ | title=Cardiac Arrests At Sony, Nintendo As Consoles Show Their Age | work=Forbes | first=Paul | last=Tassi}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', in suggesting why Nintendo posted a record loss of $926&nbsp;million for the initial six months of its 2011\u20132012 fiscal year, blamed the Wii's design for being \"short-sighted\". The Wii initially enjoyed phenomenal success because it was inexpensive (due to its being less sophisticated than its competitors) and introduced a \"gaming gimmick\". However, this approach meant that the Wii's hardware soon became outdated and could not keep up long-term (in contrast to more-advanced rivals such as Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, which were expected to continue doing well in 2012\u20132013) \"as both user desires and surrounding technologies evolved\" later in the [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|generation]]. Furthermore, price cuts and the introduction of motion-sensor controllers for the Xbox 360 and PS3 nullified advantages once held by the Wii. ''The Globe'' suggested that there were other reasons for Nintendo's poor financial performance, including a strong yen and a tepid reception to the Nintendo 3DS handheld as mobile gaming became popular on smartphones and tablets, such as the [[iPad]].<ref name=\"theglobeandmail\" />\n\n==={{anchor|System Sales}}Sales=== <!-- see [[WP:MSH]] about section names -->\n<!-- This section is linked from this article's infobox -->\n<!-- Do not change these numbers without a reference -->\n<!-- VGCHARTZ.COM and NEXGENWARS.COM are ''not'' reliable sources -->\n{{Main|Wii sales}}\n[[File:Wii sold out.jpg|thumb|right|The Wii sold out at an [[HMV]] on [[Oxford Street]]]]\n{{As of|2019|09|30|df=US}}, the Wii has sold 101.63&nbsp;million consoles worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/sales/hard_soft/|title=IR Information : Sales Data - Hardware and Software Sales Units|work=Nintendo Co., Ltd.}}</ref>\n\nSince its launch, monthly sales numbers of the console were generally higher than its competitors around the globe.

Too many powerful consoles can't coexist. It's like having only ferocious [[dinosaur]]s. They might fight and hasten their own extinction.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2006/tc20061116_750580.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201013947/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2006/tc20061116_750580.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 1, 2006|title=The Big Ideas Behind Nintendo's Wii|date=December 1, 2006|access-date=August 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, game [[game engine|engineers]] and [[Game designer|designers]] were brought together to develop the concept further. By 2005 the controller interface had taken form, but a public showing at that year's [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) was canceled. Miyamoto stated that the company \"had some troubleshooting to do.

Designer Ken'ichiro Ashida noted, \"We had the DS on our minds as we worked on the Wii.

Parental controls may also restrict Internet access, which blocks the [[Internet Channel]] and system-update features. Since the console is restricted to [[GameCube]] functionality when playing GameCube Game Discs, GameCube software is unaffected by Wii parental-control settings.<ref name=CNETParent>{{cite magazine|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-9880634-1.html|title=Super-Easy Game Play - Nintendo Wii Reviewi|magazine=PC Magazine|first=Will|last=Greenwald|date=February 29, 2008|accessdate=September 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\nEuropean units primarily use the [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]] rating system,<ref name=\"par_pegi\">{{cite news|url= http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/newsArt.cfm?artid=10948|title=Revolution To Feature Parental Controls|publisher=Nintendo World Report|date=November 16, 2005 |accessdate=September 25, 2008}}</ref> while North American units use the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] rating system.<ref name=\"par_esrb\">{{cite press release|url=https://www.nintendo.com/newsarticle?articleid=z5UnNGZpQKWULzG0z8R501PA5IHoNPr2|title=Nintendo Announces Play Control System For Next Hardware|publisher= Nintendo|date=November 16, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213012428/http://www.nintendo.com/newsarticle?articleid=z5UnNGZpQKWULzG0z8R501PA5IHoNPr2|archivedate=February 13, 2007}}</ref> The Wii supports the rating systems of many countries, including [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]] in Japan, the [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle|USK]] in Germany, the [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]] and [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] in the United Kingdom, the [[Australian Classification Board|ACB]] in Australia and the [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (New Zealand)|OFLC]] in New Zealand.

''Forbes'' observed that of the most successful games of 2011 (''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]], [[Mass Effect 3]], [[Portal 2]], [[L.A.

The Wii initially enjoyed phenomenal success because it was inexpensive (due to its being less sophisticated than its competitors) and introduced a \"gaming gimmick\". However, this approach meant that the Wii's hardware soon became outdated and could not keep up long-term (in contrast to more-advanced rivals such as Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, which were expected to continue doing well in 2012\u20132013) \"as both user desires and surrounding technologies evolved\" later in the [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|generation]].
