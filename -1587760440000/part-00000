He was also a recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{lang-de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}). The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.\n\n==Luftwaffe Ace in World War II==\nAs a ''Gefreiter'' flying with I/[[JG 27]] Werfft participated in the [[Battle of Britain]]; the two air victories which he scored against RAF [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters on 27 September 1940 was his first.\n\nWerrft served with JG 27 in North Africa during 1941-42, claiming five kills over the [[Desert Air Force]]. Werfft was commissioned as a ''Leutnant'' (Lieutenant) in late 1942. Service over Greece and the Balkans followed in 1943, where he claimed the destruction of a [[P-38 Lightning]] and three USAAF heavy bombers.\n\nWerfft claimed 11 more heavies in 1944, he was a ''Hauptmann'' (Captain) by October 1944. He was awarded the ''Ritterkreuz'' on 28 January 1945.\n\nAt the end of World War II he was a Major and ''gruppenkommandeur'' of III./JG 27, flying a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] G-6 fighter [https://www.aviationillustration.com/shop/popup_image.php?pID=1143&osCsid=dc890d2c87e567a0f3af324a3a44b888 (\"Yellow One\")] with a green fuselage band signifying dedication to ''Reich'' strategic airspace defence; he also had a total of 26 air kills.\n\nOn 3 May 1945 he disbanded his III./JG 27 in the Austrian Alps near [[Saalbach-Hinterglemm|Saalbach]], together with the acting unit commander ''Hauptmann'' [[Emil Clade]], eventually becoming a prisoner of war of the United States.\n\n==Pharmaceutical Entrepreneur==\nReturning to Austria after his release from captivity, Werfft established InterChemie GmbH, a Vienna-based pharmaceutical and chemical limited liability enterprise, in 1948. Among the first commercial activities of the fledgling trading company in this difficult post-war period was the Austrian sales representation for certain [[American Cyanamid]] products. By 1961 the firm had been restructured into a successor company, Werfft-Chemie GmbH. In the years following the founder's death in 1970, Werfft-Chemie continued, initially as a family-run business, but met with increasing economic difficulties. It was taken over by the Austrian [[Sanochemia Pharmazeutika]] Group in 1983 and was subsequently converted to a purely veterinary medicine company. The legacy of Werfft-Chemie survives under the name [http://www.alvetrawerfft.com Alvetra u. Werfft AG], a Sanochemia company with subsidiaries in several central and eastern European countries.\n\n==Summary of career==\n\n===Aerial victory claims===\nWerfft was credited with 26 enemy aircraft shot down, all of which on the Western Front, including five in North Africa. This figure includes 14 four-engined bombers.{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=222}}\n\n{{legend2|#fbec5d;|This along with the * (asterisk) indicates an ''Herausschuss'' (separation shot)\u2014a severely damaged heavy bomber forced to separate from his combat box which was counted as an aerial victory.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"12\" | Chronicle of aerial victories\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Victory\n!scope=\"col\"| Date\n!scope=\"col\"| Time\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\"| Type\n!scope=\"col\"| Location\n!scope=\"col\"| Unit\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"border-left: 3px solid grey;\" | Victory\n!scope=\"col\"| Date\n!scope=\"col\"| Time\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\"| Type\n!scope=\"col\"| Location\n!scope=\"col\"| Unit\n|-\n! colspan=\"12\" | \u2013 Claims with I.

It is possible that \"Wolfsberg\" is an error for [[Wolfsburg]], the site of the [[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagen]] headquarters and main factory, population 124,000 in 2018, {{convert|270|km|mi}} from Marburg and therefore within flying distance.</ref>\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n| style=\"border-left: 3px solid grey;\" | 22\n| 19 May 1944\n| 13:30\n| B-24\n| east Helmstedt\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n|-\n| 15\n| 2 April 1944\n| 10:42\n| B-24\n| northwest Wolfsberg\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n| style=\"border-left: 3px solid grey;\" | 23\n| 17 December 1944\n| 14:25\n| [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]]\n| northeast [[Coesfeld]]\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n|-\n| 16\n| 6 April 1944\n| 16:25\n| B-17\n| east Marburg\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n| style=\"border-left: 3px solid grey;\" | 24\n| 23 December 1944\n| 12:05\n| P-47\n| {{Convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest [[Bonn]]\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n|-\n| 17\n| 12 April 1944\n| 11:50\n| B-24\n| {{Convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast [[Eisenstadt]]\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n| style=\"border-left: 3px solid grey;\" | 25\n| 27 December 1944\n| 11:10\n| [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38]]\n| {{Convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} east [[Dinant]]\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n|-\n| style=\"background:#fbec5d;\" | 18*\n| 12 April 1944\n| 12:00\n| B-24\n| south [[\u00d6denburg]]\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n| style=\"border-left: 3px solid grey;\" | 26\n| 27 December 1944\n| 11:20\n| P-38\n| {{Convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest [[Losheim]]\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n|-\n| style=\"background:#fbec5d;\" | 19*\n| 23 May 1944\n| 13:45\n| B-24\n| {{Convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} east-southeast [[Gy\u0151r|Raab]]\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n| style=\"border-left: 3px solid grey;\" |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n</center>\n\n===Awards===\n* [[Iron Cross]] (1939) 2nd and 1st class\n* [[Honour Goblet of the Luftwaffe|Honour Goblet of the ''Luftwaffe'']] (''Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe'') on 15 July 1944{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=222}}\n* [[German Cross]] in Gold on 23 July 1944 as ''[[Leutnant]]'' in the III./''Jagdgeschwader'' 27{{sfn|Patzwall|Scherzer|2001|p=507}}\n* [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 28 January 1945 as ''[[Hauptmann]]'' and ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' of the III./''Jagdgeschwader'' 27{{sfn|Fellgiebel|2000|p=443}}{{refn|According to Scherzer as ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' of the [[Military reserve force|Reserves]]{{sfn|Scherzer|2007|p=779}}|group=\"Note\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"Note\"}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last=Fellgiebel\n  |first=Walther-Peer\n  |authorlink=Walther-Peer Fellgiebel\n  |year=2000\n  |origyear=1986\n  |title=Die Tr\u00e4ger des Ritterkreuzes des Eisernen Kreuzes 1939\u20131945 \u2014 Die Inhaber der h\u00f6chsten Auszeichnung des Zweiten Weltkrieges aller Wehrmachtteile\n  |trans-title=The Bearers of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross 1939\u20131945 \u2014 The Owners of the Highest Award of the Second World War of all Wehrmacht Branches\n  |language=German\n  |location=Friedberg, Germany\n  |publisher=Podzun-Pallas\n  |isbn=978-3-7909-0284-6\n  |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last=Obermaier\n  |first=Ernst\n  |year=1989\n  |title=Die Ritterkreuztr\u00e4ger der Luftwaffe Jagdflieger 1939 \u2013 1945\n  |trans-title=The Knight's Cross Bearers of the Luftwaffe Fighter Force 1939 \u2013 1945\n  |language=German\n  |location=Mainz, Germany\n  |publisher=Verlag Dieter Hoffmann\n  |isbn=978-3-87341-065-7\n  |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last1=Patzwall\n  |first1=Klaus D.\n  |last2=Scherzer\n  |first2=Veit\n  |year=2001\n  |title=Das Deutsche Kreuz 1941 \u2013 1945 Geschichte und Inhaber Band II\n  |trans-title=The German Cross 1941 \u2013 1945 History and Recipients Volume 2\n  |language=German\n  |location=Norderstedt, Germany\n  |publisher=Verlag Klaus D.

According to his [[hagiographies]], he was [[bishop of Paris|bishop]] of [[Diocese of Paris|Paris]] in the third century and, together with his companions Rusticus and Eleutherius, was martyred for his faith by [[decapitation]]. Some accounts placed this during [[Domitian]]'s [[Domitianic Persecution|persecution]] and identified St{{nbsp}}Denis of Paris with the [[Dionysius the Areopagite|Areopagite]] who was converted by [[Paul the Apostle]] and who served as the first [[bishop of Athens|bishop]] of [[diocese of Athens|Athens]]. Assuming Denis's historicity, it is now considered more likely that he suffered under the [[Decian persecution|persecution]] of the [[list of Roman emperors|emperor]] [[Decius]] shortly after {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}250. Denis is the most famous [[cephalophore]] in Christian legend, with a popular story claiming that the decapitated bishop picked up his head and walked several miles while preaching a sermon on repentance. He is [[veneration of saints|venerated]] in the [[Catholicism in France|Catholic Church]] as the [[patron saint]] of France and Paris and is accounted one of the [[Fourteen Holy Helpers]]. A chapel was raised at the site of his burial by a local Christian woman; it was later expanded into an [[Abbey of Saint Denis|abbey]] and [[basilica of Saint Denis|basilica]], around which grew up the French city of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], now a suburb of Paris.\n\n{{anchor|Etymology}}\n\n==Name==\nThe medieval and modern [[French name|French]] [[masculine name|masculine]] [[given name]] Denis derives from the Latin and Greek name '''[[Dionysius (disambiguation)|Dionysius]]'''. This saint is sometimes distinguished as {{nowrap|'''St Denis of Paris'''}} His name is also sometimes spelled '''Dennis''' and '''Denys'''.{{fact|date=June 2017}}\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Basilique Saint-Denis portail nord tympan.jpg|thumb|left|Beheading of Denis and of his companions, tympanum of the north portal of the [[Basilica of St Denis]].]]\n[[Gregory of Tours]]<ref>\"Beatus Dionysius Parisiorum episcopus diversis pro Christi nomine adfectus poenis praesentem vitam gladio immente finivit.\" \"History of the Franks I,\" 30.</ref> states that Denis was bishop of the [[Parisii (France)|Parisii]] and was martyred by being beheaded by a sword. The earliest document giving an account of his life and martyrdom, the ''\"Passio SS. Dionysii Rustici et Eleutherii\"'' dates from c. 600, is mistakenly attributed to the poet [[Venantius Fortunatus]], and is legendary. Nevertheless, it appears from the ''Passio'' that Denis was sent from [[Italy]] to convert [[Gaul]] in the third century, forging a link with the ''\"apostles to the Gauls\"'' reputed to have been sent out with six other missionary bishops under the direction of [[Pope Fabian]]. There Denis was appointed first Bishop of Paris.<ref name=SHMI>{{cite book|author=Fr. Paolo O.

At their instigation, Roman Governor arrested the missionaries. After a long imprisonment, Denis and two of his clergy were executed by beheading<ref name=SHMI /> on the highest hill in Paris (now [[Montmartre]]), which was likely to have been a [[druid]]ic holy place. The martyrdom of Denis and his companions is popularly believed to have given the site its current name, derived from the Latin ''Mons Martyrum'' ''\"The Martyrs' Mountain\"'',<ref name=\"softheday\"/> although the name is possibly derived from ''Mons Mercurii et Mons Martis'', ''Hill of Mercury and Mars''.<ref name=\"br\">{{cite web|url=http://www.montmartre.fr/html/legend.htm|title=L\u00e9gende Montmartre|website=www.montmartre.fr}}</ref> After his head was cut off, Denis is said to have picked it up and walked several miles from the summit of the hill, preaching a [[sermon]] the entire way, making him one of many [[cephalophore]]s in hagiology. Of the many accounts of this martyrdom, this is noted in detail in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' and in Butler's ''Lives Of The Saints''.<ref>This is the iconographic detail by which he may be identified, whether in the thirteenth-century sculpture at the [[Mus\u00e9e de Cluny]] (''illustration, in Veneration below'') or in the nineteenth-century figure in the portal of [[N\u00f4tre Dame de Paris]], part of [[Viollet-le-Duc]]'s restorations (''illustration, in infobox'').</ref> The site where he stopped preaching and actually died was marked by a small shrine that developed into the [[Saint Denis Basilica]], which became the burial place for the [[list of French monarchs|kings of France]].

The bodies of Denis, Eleutherius, and Rusticus were buried on the spot of their martyrdom, where the construction of the [[wiktionary:eponym|eponymous]] [[Saint Denis Basilica|basilica]] was begun by [[Genevieve]], assisted by the people of [[Paris]].<ref name=\"art\">{{cite web | last =Vadnal | first =Jane | title =Images of Medieval Art and Architecture: Saint Denis | work =Excerpt from \"Sacred and Legendary Art\" by Anna Jameson, 1911 | date =June 1998 | url =http://vrcoll.fa.pitt.edu/medart/texts/saints/Jameson/AJ-SLA-Denis.html | accessdate =2007-01-16}}</ref> Her ''Vita Sanctae Genovefae'' attests the presence of a shrine near the present basilica by the close of the fifth century.\n\n[[Dagobert I]], great-grandson of [[Chlothar I]] had the first Royal Basilica built. The Merovingian tradition was originally to bury kings as [[Clovis I|Clovis]] and [[Clotilde|Chlothildis]] in Paris, Abbey St-Genevieve/Genovefa as Clovis had ordered its construction in 502 AD. Yet Chilperic I had his own mother [[Aregund|Dowager Queen Aregunda]] buried at Saint Denis. His grandson was clearly following a family tradition. Aregunda's (death about 580 AD) tomb was discovered in 1959 and her burial items can be seen at Saint-Germain-en-Laye museum. A successor church was erected by [[Fulrad]], who became abbot in 749/50 and was closely linked with the accession of the Carolingians to the Merovingian throne.\n\nIn time, St{{nbsp}}Denis came to be regarded as the [[patron saint]] of the [[French people]], with [[Louis IX of France|St{{nbsp}}Louis]] the patron of the [[Kingdom of France|monarchy]] and [[list of French kings|royal dynasties]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} ''Saint Denis'' or ''Montjoie! Saint Denis!'' became the typical [[war-cry]] of the [[French army|French armies]]. The [[oriflamme]], which became the standard of France, was the banner consecrated upon his tomb. His veneration spread beyond France when, in 754, [[Pope Stephen II]] brought veneration of Saint Denis to Rome. Soon his ''[[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]]'' was prevalent throughout Europe.<ref name=\"art\"/> [[Abbot Suger]] removed the relics of Denis, and those associated with Rustique and Eleuth\u00e9re, from the crypt to reside under the high altar of the Saint-Denis he rebuilt, 1140-44.<ref>Suger, \"De rebus in administratione sua gestis,\" xxxi, and \"De Consecratione,\" v.</ref>\n\nIn traditional Catholic practice, Saint Denis is honoured as one of the [[Fourteen Holy Helpers]].

The names Rusticus and Eleutherius are non-historical. The feast of Saint Denis was added to the [[Calendar of Saints|Roman Calendar]] in the year 1568 by [[Pope Pius V]], although it had been celebrated since at least the year 800.\n\nSaint Denis is also a commemoration in many Anglican Provinces, including the [[Church of England]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/the-calendar/holydays.aspx |title=Holy Days |date=7 October 2017 |publisher=The Church of England }}</ref> and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prayerbook.ca/resources/bcponline/calendar/|title=The Calendar|date=16 October 2013|publisher=}}</ref> on October 9.\n\n==Confusion with Dionysius the Areopagite==\nSince at least the ninth century, the legends of [[Dionysius the Areopagite]] and Denis of Paris have often been confused. Around 814, [[Louis the Pious]] brought certain writings attributed to Dionysius the Areopagite to France, and since then it became common among the French legendary writers to argue that Denis of Paris was the same Dionysius who was a famous convert and disciple of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]].<ref name=\"art\"/> The confusion of the personalities of Saint Denis, Dionysius the Areopagite, and [[pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], the author of the writings ascribed to Dionysius brought to France by Louis, was initiated through an ''Areopagitica'' written in 836 by [[Hilduin]], Abbot of Saint-Denis, at the request of [[Louis the Pious]]. \"Hilduin was anxious to promote the dignity of his church, and it is to him that the quite unfounded identification of the patron saint with Dionysius the Areopagite and his consequent connexion<!--connexion in original--> with the apostolic age are due.\"<ref>A. Hamilton Thompson, reviewing Sumner McKnight Crosby, ''The Abbey of Saint-Denis, 475\u20131122''. Vol. I, in ''The English Historical Review'' '''58''' No. 231 (July 1943:357\u2013359) p 358. But Denis is already said to have been sent to Paris by [[Pope Clement I]] in the earliest Vita of St [[Genevieve]] (chapter 17, [http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb00000750.html?pageNo=222&sortIndex=010%3A020%3A0003%3A010%3A00%3A00 MGH, SS rer. Merov. 3, 222])</ref> Hilduin's attribution had been supported for centuries by the monastic community at [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]] and one of origins of their pride.  In ''[[Historia calamitatum]]'', [[Pierre Abelard]] gives a short account of the strength of this belief and the monastery's harsh opposition to challenges to their claim. Abelard jokingly pointed out a possibility that the founder of the Abbey could have been another Dionysius, who is mentioned as Dionysius of Corinth by [[Eusebius]]. This irritated the community so much that eventually Abelard left in bitterness. As late as the sixteenth century, scholars might still argue for an Eastern origin of the Basilica of Saint-Denis: one was Godefroi Tillman, in a long preface to a paraphrase of the ''Letters'' of the Areopagite, printed in Paris in 1538 by Charlotte Guillard.<ref>\"Georgii Pachymerae... Paraphrasis in decem Epistolas B. Dionysii Arepagitae\"; see Beatrice Beech, \"Charlotte Guillard: A Sixteenth-Century Business Woman,\" Renaissance Quarterly No. 36, 3 (Autumn 1983:345\u2013367) p. 349.</ref>  Most historiographers agree that this conflated legend is completely erroneous.<ref name=\"cathen\"/>\n\n==Depiction in art==\nDenis' headless walk has led to his being depicted in art decapitated and dressed as a [[bishop]], holding his own (often [[mitre]]d) [[cephalophore|head in his hands]].<ref name=\"art\"/> Handling the [[halo (religious symbol)|halo]] in this circumstance poses a unique challenge for the artist. Some put the halo where the head used to be; others have Saint Denis carrying the halo along with the head. Even more problematic than the halo was the issue of how much of his head Denis should be shown carrying. \n\nThroughout much of the Middle Ages, the Abbey of St Denis and the [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of [[Notre dame de paris|Notre-Dame Cathedral]] were in dispute over ownership of the saint's head.

According to his [[hagiographies]], he was [[bishop of Paris|bishop]] of [[Diocese of Paris|Paris]] in the third century and, together with his companions Rusticus and Eleutherius, was martyred for his faith by [[decapitation]]. Some accounts placed this during [[Domitian]]'s [[Domitianic Persecution|persecution]] and identified St{{nbsp}}Denis of Paris with the [[Dionysius the Areopagite|Areopagite]] who was converted by [[Paul the Apostle]] and who served as the first [[bishop of Athens|bishop]] of [[diocese of Athens|Athens]]. Assuming Denis's historicity, it is now considered more likely that he suffered under the [[Decian persecution|persecution]] of the [[list of Roman emperors|emperor]] [[Decius]] shortly after {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}250. Denis is the most famous [[cephalophore]] in Christian legend, with a popular story claiming that the decapitated bishop picked up his head and walked several miles while preaching a sermon on repentance. He is [[veneration of saints|venerated]] in the [[Catholicism in France|Catholic Church]] as the [[patron saint]] of France and Paris and is accounted one of the [[Fourteen Holy Helpers]]. A chapel was raised at the site of his burial by a local Christian woman; it was later expanded into an [[Abbey of Saint Denis|abbey]] and [[basilica of Saint Denis|basilica]], around which grew up the French city of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], now a suburb of Paris.\n\n{{anchor|Etymology}}\n\n==Name==\nThe medieval and modern [[French name|French]] [[masculine name|masculine]] [[given name]] Denis derives from the Latin and Greek name '''[[Dionysius (disambiguation)|Dionysius]]'''. This saint is sometimes distinguished as {{nowrap|'''St Denis of Paris'''}} His name is also sometimes spelled '''Dennis''' and '''Denys'''.{{fact|date=June 2017}}\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Basilique Saint-Denis portail nord tympan.jpg|thumb|left|Beheading of Denis and of his companions, tympanum of the north portal of the [[Basilica of St Denis]].]]\n[[Gregory of Tours]]<ref>\"Beatus Dionysius Parisiorum episcopus diversis pro Christi nomine adfectus poenis praesentem vitam gladio immente finivit.\" \"History of the Franks I,\" 30.</ref> states that Denis was bishop of the [[Parisii (France)|Parisii]] and was martyred by being beheaded by a sword. The earliest document giving an account of his life and martyrdom, the ''\"Passio SS. Dionysii Rustici et Eleutherii\"'' dates from c. 600, is mistakenly attributed to the poet [[Venantius Fortunatus]], and is legendary. Nevertheless, it appears from the ''Passio'' that Denis was sent from [[Italy]] to convert [[Gaul]] in the third century, forging a link with the ''\"apostles to the Gauls\"'' reputed to have been sent out with six other missionary bishops under the direction of [[Pope Fabian]].

At their instigation, Roman Governor arrested the missionaries. After a long imprisonment, Denis and two of his clergy were executed by beheading<ref name=SHMI /> on the highest hill in Paris (now [[Montmartre]]), which was likely to have been a [[druid]]ic holy place. The martyrdom of Denis and his companions is popularly believed to have given the site its current name, derived from the Latin ''Mons Martyrum'' ''\"The Martyrs' Mountain\"'',<ref name=\"softheday\"/> although the name is possibly derived from ''Mons Mercurii et Mons Martis'', ''Hill of Mercury and Mars''.<ref name=\"br\">{{cite web|url=http://www.montmartre.fr/html/legend.htm|title=L\u00e9gende Montmartre|website=www.montmartre.fr}}</ref> After his head was cut off, Denis is said to have picked it up and walked several miles from the summit of the hill, preaching a [[sermon]] the entire way, making him one of many [[cephalophore]]s in hagiology.

The Merovingian tradition was originally to bury kings as [[Clovis I|Clovis]] and [[Clotilde|Chlothildis]] in Paris, Abbey St-Genevieve/Genovefa as Clovis had ordered its construction in 502 AD. Yet Chilperic I had his own mother [[Aregund|Dowager Queen Aregunda]] buried at Saint Denis. His grandson was clearly following a family tradition. Aregunda's (death about 580 AD) tomb was discovered in 1959 and her burial items can be seen at Saint-Germain-en-Laye museum. A successor church was erected by [[Fulrad]], who became abbot in 749/50 and was closely linked with the accession of the Carolingians to the Merovingian throne.\n\nIn time, St{{nbsp}}Denis came to be regarded as the [[patron saint]] of the [[French people]], with [[Louis IX of France|St{{nbsp}}Louis]] the patron of the [[Kingdom of France|monarchy]] and [[list of French kings|royal dynasties]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} ''Saint Denis'' or ''Montjoie! Saint Denis!'' became the typical [[war-cry]] of the [[French army|French armies]]. The [[oriflamme]], which became the standard of France, was the banner consecrated upon his tomb.

The names Rusticus and Eleutherius are non-historical. The feast of Saint Denis was added to the [[Calendar of Saints|Roman Calendar]] in the year 1568 by [[Pope Pius V]], although it had been celebrated since at least the year 800.\n\nSaint Denis is also a commemoration in many Anglican Provinces, including the [[Church of England]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/the-calendar/holydays.aspx |title=Holy Days |date=7 October 2017 |publisher=The Church of England }}</ref> and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prayerbook.ca/resources/bcponline/calendar/|title=The Calendar|date=16 October 2013|publisher=}}</ref> on October 9.\n\n==Confusion with Dionysius the Areopagite==\nSince at least the ninth century, the legends of [[Dionysius the Areopagite]] and Denis of Paris have often been confused. Around 814, [[Louis the Pious]] brought certain writings attributed to Dionysius the Areopagite to France, and since then it became common among the French legendary writers to argue that Denis of Paris was the same Dionysius who was a famous convert and disciple of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]].<ref name=\"art\"/> The confusion of the personalities of Saint Denis, Dionysius the Areopagite, and [[pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], the author of the writings ascribed to Dionysius brought to France by Louis, was initiated through an ''Areopagitica'' written in 836 by [[Hilduin]], Abbot of Saint-Denis, at the request of [[Louis the Pious]]. \"Hilduin was anxious to promote the dignity of his church, and it is to him that the quite unfounded identification of the patron saint with Dionysius the Areopagite and his consequent connexion<!--connexion in original--> with the apostolic age are due.\"<ref>A. Hamilton Thompson, reviewing Sumner McKnight Crosby, ''The Abbey of Saint-Denis, 475\u20131122''. Vol. I, in ''The English Historical Review'' '''58''' No. 231 (July 1943:357\u2013359) p 358. But Denis is already said to have been sent to Paris by [[Pope Clement I]] in the earliest Vita of St [[Genevieve]] (chapter 17, [http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb00000750.html?pageNo=222&sortIndex=010%3A020%3A0003%3A010%3A00%3A00 MGH, SS rer. Merov. 3, 222])</ref> Hilduin's attribution had been supported for centuries by the monastic community at [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]] and one of origins of their pride.  In ''[[Historia calamitatum]]'', [[Pierre Abelard]] gives a short account of the strength of this belief and the monastery's harsh opposition to challenges to their claim. Abelard jokingly pointed out a possibility that the founder of the Abbey could have been another Dionysius, who is mentioned as Dionysius of Corinth by [[Eusebius]]. This irritated the community so much that eventually Abelard left in bitterness. As late as the sixteenth century, scholars might still argue for an Eastern origin of the Basilica of Saint-Denis: one was Godefroi Tillman, in a long preface to a paraphrase of the ''Letters'' of the Areopagite, printed in Paris in 1538 by Charlotte Guillard.<ref>\"Georgii Pachymerae... Paraphrasis in decem Epistolas B. Dionysii Arepagitae\"; see Beatrice Beech, \"Charlotte Guillard: A Sixteenth-Century Business Woman,\" Renaissance Quarterly No. 36, 3 (Autumn 1983:345\u2013367) p. 349.</ref>  Most historiographers agree that this conflated legend is completely erroneous.<ref name=\"cathen\"/>\n\n==Depiction in art==\nDenis' headless walk has led to his being depicted in art decapitated and dressed as a [[bishop]], holding his own (often [[mitre]]d) [[cephalophore|head in his hands]].<ref name=\"art\"/> Handling the [[halo (religious symbol)|halo]] in this circumstance poses a unique challenge for the artist. Some put the halo where the head used to be; others have Saint Denis carrying the halo along with the head. Even more problematic than the halo was the issue of how much of his head Denis should be shown carrying. \n\nThroughout much of the Middle Ages, the Abbey of St Denis and the [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of [[Notre dame de paris|Notre-Dame Cathedral]] were in dispute over ownership of the saint's head. The Abbey claimed that they had the entire body, whilst the Cathedral claimed to possess the top of his head which, they claimed, had been severed by the executioner's first blow.<ref>See Gabriel Spiegel, ''The Cult of St Denis and Capetian Kingship'', in ''Saints and their Cults'', Stephen Wilson (ed), 1985. p.144ff</ref> Thus while most depictions of St Denis show him holding his entire head, in others, the patrons have shown their support for the Cathedral's claim by depicting him carrying just the crown of his skull, as, for example in the mid 13th century window showing the story at [[Le Mans Cathedral]] (Bay 111).<ref name=\"SkullCrown\">{{cite web | last =Whatling | first =Stuart | title =Photographs of Le Mans Cathedral\u2014Outer Clerestory Windows\u2014Bay 111, Panel B5 | work =Corpus Narratologica | url =http://www.medievalart.org.uk/LeMans/111_pages/LeMans_Bay111_PanelB5.htm | accessdate =2009-06-15}}</ref>\n\nA 1317 illustrated manuscript depicting ''The Life of Saint Denis'', once owned by [[Philip V of France|King Philip V of France]] is preserved in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France|Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]] in Paris.

Her mother exposed her to artists such as [[Patti LaBelle]], and she was also influenced by the late [[disco]] singer [[Sylvester (singer)|Sylvester]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Salt-N-Pepa]].<ref name=\"playjones\"/>\n\nRoss attended [[Cohen College Prep High School|Walter L. Cohen High School]], where she continued to perform in choir and also became the choir director. This experience made her realize she could write and produce.<ref name=\"playjones\"/> According to Freedia, she initially suffered from stage-fright, and had to coax herself onto stage until she became comfortable performing.<ref name=\"playjones\"/>\n\nIn 1998, a young [[drag queen]] by the name of [[Katey Red]] performed [[bounce music]] at a club near the [[Melpomene Projects]] where Ross grew up. Ross, who had grown up four blocks away from Katey Red, began performing as a backup dancer and singer in Red's shows.<ref name=\"dee2010\"/> In 1999, Katey Red released ''Melpomene Block Party'' on the city's leading bounce label, Take Fo Records.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> Freedia adopted her stage name after a friend dubbed her \"Freedia\" (pronounced \"Freeda\"). According to Ross, \"I wanted a catchy name that rhymed, and my mother had a club called Diva that I worked for. I called myself the queen of diva\u2014so I coined it: Big Freedia Queen Diva.\"<ref name=\"playjones\"/>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Early years===\nIn 1999, Freedia released her first [[Single (music)|single]], \"An Ha, Oh Yeah,\" and began performing frequently in clubs and other venues in New Orleans. Other local hits included \"Rock Around the Clock\" and \"Gin 'N My System,\" which was later quoted by [[Lil Wayne]] on a mix tape. She released her first studio album, ''Queen Diva,'' in 2003.<ref name=\"zeichner2011\"/><ref name=\"fensterstock\"/><ref name=\"dodero2010\"/>\n\nFreedia was often described as an artist within the \"sissy bounce\" subgenre,<ref name=\"cadogan2007\"/> though she had stated \"there's no such thing as separating it into straight bounce and sissy bounce. It's all bounce music.\"<ref name=\"flaherty\"/> About her popularity with women at live shows, music journalist Alison Fensterstock wrote, \"When Freedia or Sissy Nobby's singing superaggressive, sexual lyrics about bad boyfriends or whatever, there's something about being able to be the 'I' in the sentence...it's tough to sing along about bitches and hoes when you're a girl. When you identify with Freedia, you're the agent of all this aggressive sexuality instead of its object.\"<ref name=\"dee2010\"/>\n\n[[Hurricane Katrina]] struck New Orleans in 2005, and Freedia, along with other bounce artists such as Katey Red and Freedia's protege Sissy Nobby, were forced to vacate the city. Freedia settled for several months in [[Texas]], where she began performing bounce shows for the locals, helping spread awareness of the genre like other displaced bounce artists. She moved back to New Orleans at the first opportunity. According to Freedia, \"The first club that reopened in New Orleans was Caesar's, and they called me immediately and said let's do a regular night with you here. So we started [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] Fridays. It was the only club open in the city, and a lot of people had a lot of money from Katrina, the checks and stuff, so the joy inside that club\u2014I don't think that'll ever come back.\"<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/>\n\nShe played six to ten shows a week at [[Block party|block parties]], nightclubs, strip clubs, and other venues while the city recuperated.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> According to Fensterstock, \"Freedia was one of the first artists to come back after the storm and start working, and [s]he worked really, really hard. If you lived here, it became impossible not to know who [s]he was.\"<ref name=\"dee2010\"/>\n\n===Mainstream exposure===\nFreedia first began to gain national exposure after a 2009 fest-closing gig with Katey Red and Sissy Nobby at the [[The New Orleans Bingo! Show|Bingo Parlour Tent]] and the 2009 [[Voodoo Music + Arts Experience|Voodoo Experience]].<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> On January 18, 2010, she self-released the album ''Big Freedia Hitz Vol. 1'' on Big Freedia Records.<ref name=\"sullivan2011\"/> The album was a collection of previously performed singles from 1999 to 2010.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/>\n\nIn March 2010, she was booked for a showcase of New Orleans bounce music at the [[South by Southwest]] music festival in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], but cancelled after an injury.

Her mother exposed her to artists such as [[Patti LaBelle]], and she was also influenced by the late [[disco]] singer [[Sylvester (singer)|Sylvester]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Salt-N-Pepa]].<ref name=\"playjones\"/>\n\nRoss attended [[Cohen College Prep High School|Walter L. Cohen High School]], where she continued to perform in choir and also became the choir director. This experience made her realize she could write and produce.<ref name=\"playjones\"/> According to Freedia, she initially suffered from stage-fright, and had to coax herself onto stage until she became comfortable performing.<ref name=\"playjones\"/>\n\nIn 1998, a young [[drag queen]] by the name of [[Katey Red]] performed [[bounce music]] at a club near the [[Melpomene Projects]] where Ross grew up. Ross, who had grown up four blocks away from Katey Red, began performing as a backup dancer and singer in Red's shows.<ref name=\"dee2010\"/> In 1999, Katey Red released ''Melpomene Block Party'' on the city's leading bounce label, Take Fo Records.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> Freedia adopted her stage name after a friend dubbed her \"Freedia\" (pronounced \"Freeda\"). According to Ross, \"I wanted a catchy name that rhymed, and my mother had a club called Diva that I worked for. I called myself the queen of diva\u2014so I coined it: Big Freedia Queen Diva.\"<ref name=\"playjones\"/>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Early years===\nIn 1999, Freedia released her first [[Single (music)|single]], \"An Ha, Oh Yeah,\" and began performing frequently in clubs and other venues in New Orleans. Other local hits included \"Rock Around the Clock\" and \"Gin 'N My System,\" which was later quoted by [[Lil Wayne]] on a mix tape. She released her first studio album, ''Queen Diva,'' in 2003.<ref name=\"zeichner2011\"/><ref name=\"fensterstock\"/><ref name=\"dodero2010\"/>\n\nFreedia was often described as an artist within the \"sissy bounce\" subgenre,<ref name=\"cadogan2007\"/> though she had stated \"there's no such thing as separating it into straight bounce and sissy bounce. It's all bounce music.\"<ref name=\"flaherty\"/> About her popularity with women at live shows, music journalist Alison Fensterstock wrote, \"When Freedia or Sissy Nobby's singing superaggressive, sexual lyrics about bad boyfriends or whatever, there's something about being able to be the 'I' in the sentence...it's tough to sing along about bitches and hoes when you're a girl. When you identify with Freedia, you're the agent of all this aggressive sexuality instead of its object.\"<ref name=\"dee2010\"/>\n\n[[Hurricane Katrina]] struck New Orleans in 2005, and Freedia, along with other bounce artists such as Katey Red and Freedia's protege Sissy Nobby, were forced to vacate the city. Freedia settled for several months in [[Texas]], where she began performing bounce shows for the locals, helping spread awareness of the genre like other displaced bounce artists. She moved back to New Orleans at the first opportunity. According to Freedia, \"The first club that reopened in New Orleans was Caesar's, and they called me immediately and said let's do a regular night with you here. So we started [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] Fridays. It was the only club open in the city, and a lot of people had a lot of money from Katrina, the checks and stuff, so the joy inside that club\u2014I don't think that'll ever come back.\"<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/>\n\nShe played six to ten shows a week at [[Block party|block parties]], nightclubs, strip clubs, and other venues while the city recuperated.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> According to Fensterstock, \"Freedia was one of the first artists to come back after the storm and start working, and [s]he worked really, really hard. If you lived here, it became impossible not to know who [s]he was.\"<ref name=\"dee2010\"/>\n\n===Mainstream exposure===\nFreedia first began to gain national exposure after a 2009 fest-closing gig with Katey Red and Sissy Nobby at the [[The New Orleans Bingo! Show|Bingo Parlour Tent]] and the 2009 [[Voodoo Music + Arts Experience|Voodoo Experience]].<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> On January 18, 2010, she self-released the album ''Big Freedia Hitz Vol. 1'' on Big Freedia Records.<ref name=\"sullivan2011\"/> The album was a collection of previously performed singles from 1999 to 2010.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/>\n\nIn March 2010, she was booked for a showcase of New Orleans bounce music at the [[South by Southwest]] music festival in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], but cancelled after an injury.

It was contested by the 33 clubs competing in the [[2013\u201314 Primeira Liga]] and [[2013\u201314 Segunda Liga]], the [[Portuguese football league system|top two tiers]] and only professional leagues in [[Football in Portugal|Portuguese football]]. The competition began in July 2013 with first-round matches and concluded on 7 May 2014, with the [[2014 Ta\u00e7a da Liga Final|final]] at the [[Est\u00e1dio Dr. Magalh\u00e3es Pessoa]] in [[Leiria]], where [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] defeated [[Rio Ave F.C.|Rio Ave]] 2\u20130 to win a fifth Ta\u00e7a da Liga title.\n\n== Format ==\nThe competition format for the 2013\u201314 edition consists of three rounds plus a knockout phase. In the first round, only teams competing in the [[2013\u201314 Segunda Liga]] (excluding reserve teams from Primeira Liga clubs) take part. The seventeen teams are drawn into four groups (three with four teams and one with five), where each team plays against the others in a single [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format. The group winners and runners-up advance to the second round.\n\nIn the second round, the eight teams that qualified from the previous round are joined by the six Primeira Liga teams placed ninth to 14th in [[2012\u201313 Primeira Liga|the previous season]] and the two teams promoted to [[2013\u201314 Primeira Liga]]. Two-legged home-and-away fixtures are played between Segunda Liga teams qualifying from the first round and Primeira Liga teams entering this round, and the winner advances to the third round.\n\nThe third round features the eight winners of the previous round the remaining eight Primeira Liga teams, ranked 1st to 8th in the previous season. Similarly to the first round, the sixteen teams are drawn into four groups of four teams, according to a seeding based on their classification in the previous season. Each team plays against the other three in a single round-robin format, and only the group winners advance to the knockout phase. The knockout phase consists of semi-finals and one final, both decided in one-legged fixtures. The final match is played at a neutral venue.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Round\n!Teams entering in this round\n!Teams advancing from previous round\n|-\n!First round<br/ >(17 teams)\n|\n*17 teams competing in the [[2013\u201314 Segunda Liga]]\n|\n|-\n!Second round<br />(16 teams)\n|\n*6 teams ranked 9th\u201314th in the [[2012\u201313 Primeira Liga]]\n*2 teams promoted to the [[2013\u201314 Primeira Liga]]\n|\n*4 group winners from the first round\n*4 group runners-up from the first round\n|-\n!Third round<br />(16 teams)\n|\n*8 teams ranked 1st\u20138th in the [[2012\u201313 Primeira Liga]]\n|\n*8 winners from the second round\n|-\n!Knockout phase<br />(4 teams)\n|\n|\n*4 group winners from the third round\n|}\n\n== Teams ==\nThe 33 teams competing in the two professional tiers of Portuguese football for the 2013\u201314 season are eligible to participate in this competition.

It was contested by the 33 clubs competing in the [[2013\u201314 Primeira Liga]] and [[2013\u201314 Segunda Liga]], the [[Portuguese football league system|top two tiers]] and only professional leagues in [[Football in Portugal|Portuguese football]]. The competition began in July 2013 with first-round matches and concluded on 7 May 2014, with the [[2014 Ta\u00e7a da Liga Final|final]] at the [[Est\u00e1dio Dr. Magalh\u00e3es Pessoa]] in [[Leiria]], where [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] defeated [[Rio Ave F.C.|Rio Ave]] 2\u20130 to win a fifth Ta\u00e7a da Liga title.\n\n== Format ==\nThe competition format for the 2013\u201314 edition consists of three rounds plus a knockout phase. In the first round, only teams competing in the [[2013\u201314 Segunda Liga]] (excluding reserve teams from Primeira Liga clubs) take part. The seventeen teams are drawn into four groups (three with four teams and one with five), where each team plays against the others in a single [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format. The group winners and runners-up advance to the second round.\n\nIn the second round, the eight teams that qualified from the previous round are joined by the six Primeira Liga teams placed ninth to 14th in [[2012\u201313 Primeira Liga|the previous season]] and the two teams promoted to [[2013\u201314 Primeira Liga]]. Two-legged home-and-away fixtures are played between Segunda Liga teams qualifying from the first round and Primeira Liga teams entering this round, and the winner advances to the third round.\n\nThe third round features the eight winners of the previous round the remaining eight Primeira Liga teams, ranked 1st to 8th in the previous season. Similarly to the first round, the sixteen teams are drawn into four groups of four teams, according to a seeding based on their classification in the previous season.

The organization is responsible for the daily news and information gathering of its news programs.\n\nIt serves the main [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]], the Regional Network Group, the UHF sports channel [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|S+A]], the cable channels [[ABS-CBN News Channel|ANC]] and [[DZMM TeleRadyo]], the international channel [[The Filipino Channel|TFC]], the flagship radio station [[DZMM-AM|DZMM]] and the regional radio networks [[DYAP-AM|DYAP 765 Palawan]], [[DYAB-AM|DYAB 1512 Cebu]] and [[DXAB|DXAB 1296 Davao]] and news websites [[ABS-CBNnews.com|news.abs-cbn.com]] and patrol.ph.\n\n==History==\n===News division===\nThe oldest of the two components, the news division began as the news section of two radio stations - DZBC (opened 1949) and DZAQ (opened 1950) both in the Manila area, and DZRI (opened 1951) in Pangasinan, all under the Bolinao Electronics Corporation and later under the Alto Broadcasting System, which broadcast news programs and commentary as part of their programming schedules. In 1956, the Chronicle Broadcasting Network, together with the first news broadcasts on DZXL, started the short-lived 24-hour station DZQL ''Radyo Reloj'' broadcasting news and current affairs until late 1959, the first station of its kind in the country. When the two networks merged in 1957, first as part of Bolinao Electronics Corporation and later on in 1961 adopting the ABS-CBN brand (which it changed its corporate name to ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation in 1967 and ABS-CBN Corporation in 2010), the news services of these four Manila stations, later reduced to three, were combined into a unified news service but then with separate programs, as the network began expanding with the purchase and later opening of additional stations, first in the Ilocos region and the Cordillera, and then into the Visayas islands, Mindanao, and southern parts of Luzon, with the national radio service broadcasting from the Chronicle Building along Aduana street, Intramuros, Manila, which began broadcasting the two Manila stations in 1958. Alongside them was a small television news service on DZAQ-TV 3 and DZXL-TV 9 with updates broadcast daily, owing to the lack of proper news programs from the beginning of broadcasts in late 1953, with both stations' news bureaus based in the television studios in Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City (opened in 1958).\n\nProper news programming on TV, however, would begin in 1960 when news coverage for the national elections began, followed by the first Filipino-language TV newscast, ''[[Balita Ngayon]]'', in 1966 on Channel 3 and in the following year with the English-language newscast ''[[The World Tonight (Philippine TV series)|The World Tonight]]'' on late nights, which is today the longest running English-language national newscast. Channel 9 followed suit with the long-running ''[[Newsbreak (TV program)|Newsbreak]]'' as well. By 1968, following the aftermath of the [[1968 Casiguran earthquake|magnitude 7.6 earthquake in Casiguran]] (in which [[Manila]] was severely affected by the quake), leading to the collapse of the Ruby Tower in August that same year, the joint radio and color television coverage of which was the first time ever for a Philippine media company to do so, DZAQ was later converted into a 24-hour Filipino language news and current affairs radio station, adopting the ''DZAQ Radyo Patrol 960'' branding under the initiative of former station manager [[Orly Mercado]], veteran broadcaster [[Joe Taruc]], Ben Aniceto, the then ABS-CBN program director and [[Chief engineer|Chief Engr.]] Emil Solidum, whose efforts led to the recruitment of the first generation of mobile field reporters for news coverage and flash reports, a first for any radio station at that time. The station would prove to be a leading source of breaking news stories in the late 1960s and before Martial Law stopped broadcasts in September 1972, Radyo Patrol services were operational in select regional stations, alongside an active service of regional programming in all provincial TV stations in addition to occasional nationwide broadcasts via satellite, the first for any station by then.\n\nIn July 1986, the news services of ABS-CBN were officially reactivated as part of the network's return to former owners, when DZMM was officially relaunched that month from the Benpres Building in the [[Ortigas Center]] District of Pasig City. The new station broadcast its newscasts twice daily, Mondays to Saturdays, with a Sunday midday news program.\n\n===Current affairs division===\nThe division traces its roots to the current affairs and commentary programming that both DZAQ and later on DZXL aired beginning in the mid-1950s in both Filipino and English, keeping listeners informed of the latest issues that affect Filipinos.\n\n==Divisions==\nThe division operates mainly and headquartered at ABS-CBN Broadcast Complex in [[Quezon City]] while the ABS-CBN regional stations also have their local news divisions, which is a big help in newsgathering for the whole network. It also has news bureaus in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Asia-Pacific]] and the [[Middle East]] with the help of [[The Filipino Channel]] (owned by ABS-CBN Global, Ltd.), these make ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs ahead among the other news organizations in the country as they were the largest and the most comprehensive when it comes to local and international newsgathering.\n\nThe division is currently headed by long-time journalist and former ABS-CBN's North America Bureau Chief, and now ABS-CBN's Senior Vice President for News and Current Affairs Ging Reyes. It is further subdivided into different subgroups:\n* '''Integrated News Operations Group''', headed by veteran ABS-CBN journalist and former DZMM Radyo Patrol Sais Trenta reporter, Claude Vitug.\n* '''News Gathering Group''', headed by veteran ABS-CBN journalist, former DZMM Radyo Patrol Sais Trenta reporter and former Middle East News Bureau chief, Dindo Amparo.\n* '''Current Affairs Group''', headed by experienced news department staff, Dondi Ocampo.\n* '''News Production Group''', headed by Marielle Gaceta-Catbagan.\n* '''Investigative and Research Group''', headed by experienced news department staff and former reporter for Manila Standard Today, Chi Almario-Gonzales.\n* '''ABS-CBN News Channel''', headed by its Chief Operating Officer and veteran ABS-CBN News correspondent and former ABS-CBN News North America Bureau Chief, Nadia Trinidad.\n* '''Regional Network Group News and Current Affairs''', headed by television journalist and former Head of News for ABS-CBN Iloilo, [[Stanley Palisada]].\n* '''Global News Bureaus''', headed by Alcuin Papa.\n* '''ABS-CBN News Digital''', headed by its executive editor and veteran ABS-CBN journalist, former senior political correspondent and former ABS-CBN News chief of reporters, Lynda Jumilla. \n* '''ABS-CBN Weather Center''' is the [[weather forecasting]] division of ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs.\n* '''[[DZMM-AM|DZMM Radyo Patrol 630]],''' ABS-CBN's flagship AM radio station headed by station manager, Marah Faner-Capuyan.\n* '''[[DZMM TeleRadyo]],''' ABS-CBN's flagship AM radio station on Television headed by station manager, Marah Faner-Capuyan.\n* ''DocuCentral'' is the producer of highly acclaimed documentaries shown on ABS-CBN's platforms.\n\nAside from regular programming, it also operates the [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] (ANC), the first and the only 24-hour [[English language]] news channel in the country. The division also operates a news website [[ABS-CBNnews.com]] in partnership with ''[[BusinessMirror]]''.\n\n[[File:ABS-CBN News & Current Affairs.png|thumb|right|200px|Logo used from 2000 to

The organization is responsible for the daily news and information gathering of its news programs.\n\nIt serves the main [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]], the Regional Network Group, the UHF sports channel [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|S+A]], the cable channels [[ABS-CBN News Channel|ANC]] and [[DZMM TeleRadyo]], the international channel [[The Filipino Channel|TFC]], the flagship radio station [[DZMM-AM|DZMM]] and the regional radio networks [[DYAP-AM|DYAP 765 Palawan]], [[DYAB-AM|DYAB 1512 Cebu]] and [[DXAB|DXAB 1296 Davao]] and news websites [[ABS-CBNnews.com|news.abs-cbn.com]] and patrol.ph.\n\n==History==\n===News division===\nThe oldest of the two components, the news division began as the news section of two radio stations - DZBC (opened 1949) and DZAQ (opened 1950) both in the Manila area, and DZRI (opened 1951) in Pangasinan, all under the Bolinao Electronics Corporation and later under the Alto Broadcasting System, which broadcast news programs and commentary as part of their programming schedules. In 1956, the Chronicle Broadcasting Network, together with the first news broadcasts on DZXL, started the shortlived 24-hour station DZQL ''Radyo Reloj'' broadcasting news and current affairs until late 1959, the first station of its kind in the country. When the two networks merged in 1957, first as part of Bolinao Electronics Corporation and later on in 1961 adopting the ABS-CBN brand (which it changed its corporate name to ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation in 1967 and ABS-CBN Corporation in 2010), the news services of these four Manila stations, later reduced to three, were combined into a unified news service but then with separate programs, as the network began expanding with the purchase and later opening of additional stations, first in the Ilocos region and the Cordillera, and then into the Visayas islands, Mindanao, and southern parts of Luzon, with the national radio service broadcasting from the Chronicle Building along Aduana street, Intramuros, Manila, which began broadcasting the two Manila stations in 1958. Alongside them was a small television news service on DZAQ-TV 3 and DZXL-TV 9 with updates broadcast daily, owing to the lack of proper news programs from the beginning of broadcasts in late 1953, with both stations' news bureaus based in the television studios in Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City (opened in 1958).\n\nProper news programming on TV, however, would begin in 1960 when news coverage for the national elections began, followed by the first Filipino-language TV newscast, ''[[Balita Ngayon]]'', in 1966 on Channel 3 and in the following year with the English-language newscast ''[[The World Tonight (Philippine TV series)|The World Tonight]]'' on late nights, which is today the longest running English-language national newscast. Channel 9 followed suit with the long-running ''[[Newsbreak (TV program)|Newsbreak]]'' as well. By 1968, following the aftermath of the [[1968 Casiguran earthquake|magnitude 7.6 earthquake in Casiguran]] (in which [[Manila]] was severely affected by the quake), leading to the collapse of the Ruby Tower in August that same year, the joint radio and color television coverage of which was the first time ever for a Philippine media company to do so, DZAQ was later converted into a 24-hour Filipino language news and current affairs radio station, adopting the ''DZAQ Radyo Patrol 960'' branding under the initiative of former station manager [[Orly Mercado]], veteran broadcaster [[Joe Taruc]], Ben Aniceto, the then ABS-CBN program director and [[Chief engineer|Chief Engr.]] Emil Solidum, whose efforts led to the recruitment of the first generation of mobile field reporters for news coverage and flash reports, a first for any radio station at that time. The station would prove to be a leading source of breaking news stories in the late 1960s and before Martial Law stopped broadcasts in September 1972, Radyo Patrol services were operational in select regional stations, alongside an active service of regional programming in all provincial TV stations in addition to occasional nationwide broadcasts via satellite, the first for any station by then.\n\nIn July of 1986, the news services of ABS-CBN were officially reactivated as part of the network's return to former owners, when DZMM was offically relaunched that month from the Benpres Building in the [[Ortigas Center]] District of Pasig City. The new station broadcast its newscasts twice daily, Mondays to Saturdays, with a Sunday midday news program.\n\n===Current affairs division===\nThe division traces its roots to the current affairs and commentary programming that both DZAQ and later on DZXL aired beginning in the mid-1950s in both Filipino and English, keeping listeners informed of the latest issues that affect Filipinos.\n\n==Divisions==\nThe division operates mainly and headquartered at ABS-CBN Broadcast Complex in [[Quezon City]] while the ABS-CBN regional stations also have their local news divisions, which is a big help in newsgathering for the whole network. It also has news bureaus in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Asia-Pacific]] and the [[Middle East]] with the help of [[The Filipino Channel]] (owned by ABS-CBN Global, Ltd.), these make ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs ahead among the other news organizations in the country as they were the largest and the most comprehensive when it comes to local and international newsgathering.\n\nThe division is currently headed by long-time journalist and former ABS-CBN\u2019s North America Bureau Chief, and now ABS-CBN's Senior Vice President for News and Current Affairs Ging Reyes. It is further subdivided into different subgroups:\n* '''Integrated News Operations Group''', headed by veteran ABS-CBN journalist and former DZMM Radyo Patrol Sais Trenta reporter, Claude Vitug.\n* '''News Gathering Group''', headed by veteran ABS-CBN journalist, former DZMM Radyo Patrol Sais Trenta reporter and former Middle East News Bureau chief, Dindo Amparo.\n* '''Current Affairs Group''', headed by experienced news department staff, Dondi Ocampo.\n* '''News Production Group''', headed by Marielle Gaceta-Catbagan.\n* '''Investigative and Research Group''', headed by experienced news department staff and former reporter for Manila Standard Today, Chi Almario-Gonzales.\n* '''ABS-CBN News Channel''', headed by its Chief Operating Officer and veteran ABS-CBN News correspondent and former ABS-CBN News North America Bureau Chief, Nadia Trinidad.\n* '''Regional Network Group News and Current Affairs''', headed by television journalist and former Head of News for ABS-CBN Iloilo, [[Stanley Palisada]].\n* '''Global News Bureaus''', headed by Alcuin Papa.\n* '''ABS-CBN News Digital''', headed by its executive editor and veteran ABS-CBN journalist, former senior political correspondent and former ABS-CBN News chief of reporters, Lynda Jumilla. \n* '''ABS-CBN Weather Center''' is the [[weather forecasting]] division of ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs.\n* '''[[DZMM-AM|DZMM Radyo Patrol 630]],''' ABS-CBN's flagship AM radio station headed by station manager, Marah Faner-Capuyan.\n* '''[[DZMM TeleRadyo]],''' ABS-CBN's flagship AM radio station on Television headed by station manager, Marah Faner-Capuyan.\n* ''DocuCentral'' is the producer of highly acclaimed documentaries shown on ABS-CBN's platforms.\n\nAside from regular programming, it also operates the [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] (ANC), the first and the only 24-hour [[English language]] news channel in the country. The division also operates a news website [[ABS-CBNnews.com]] in partnership with ''[[BusinessMirror]]''.\n\n[[File:ABS-CBN News & Current Affairs.png|thumb|right|200px|Logo used from 2000 to

Camp would not attend the trip East due to ill health.  Another important event to note is the football teams of Rush Medical College and Lake Forest combining for the remainder of the 1895 season.  Rush would bolster the Lake Forest ranks, while also attempting Lake Forest's reportedly impossible schedule of [[1895 Northwestern Purple football team|Northwestern]], [[1895 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], and [[1895 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]], who at the time had a combined record of 9-3, with Michigan undefeated.

Stevenson was the center of attention for the Athletics, holding the line firm and knocking back Newton's star player,Mr. Draper, numerous times throughout the contest.  Brown also had a good game, and Bartl got injured.  <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49425460/chicago-athletes-win-their-game-at/|title=Chicago Athletes Win Their Game at Newton, Mass, 4 To 0.|date=1895-10-27|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2020-04-24|pages=6}}</ref>\n\n===October 29: CAA at MIT===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= CAA vs MIT\n|Visitor= Chicago AA\n|Host= MIT Engineers\n|V1=24|V2=22\n|H1=0|H2=0\n|Date= October 29, 1895\n|Location= Cambridge, MA\n|TimeZone= EST\n|StartTime= 3:30pm\n|ElapsedTime= 40 minutes (two 20 minute halves)\n|Attendance= 500\n|Weather=\n|Referee= F.

The two teams were in poor condition, but MIT was worse, having six substitutes starting, instead of their more experienced players.  The football teams had also played a tie game in 1894, where both organizations were in their prime.  Slater was yet again a star player, pulling off 3 touchdowns, while Hadden played well in his new Right Tackle position, and scored 3 touchdowns himself.  Brown also had a great day, going 7 for 8 in PATs, with 2 touchdowns of his own.  Other players that put points on the board for CAA was Thomas with two and Huddelston with one.  With 4 minutes left to play the game was called, as MIT had absolutely no chance of recovering the deficit, and were thoroughly defeated.\n\n'''October 31st-''' The Philadelphia Inquirer named Chicago AA,\"strongest eleven in the west, college or otherwise.\"  The game against Penn decided to be at 3:00 in the afternoon, with an admission of 50 cents, and an extra 25 for reserved seating.  It would be played at Penn's own [[Franklin Field]], on the corner of 33rd and spruce streets.  The last time the Chicago Athletic Association played the Pennsylvania Quakers, it was 1892, and the situation at hand was remarkably similar to that of the 1895 contest.  Penn was 10-0, having shut out 9 and outscored their opponents 349 to 6.  Chicago lost that contest 10 to 12, but was the first opponent of the season to scored double digits against the Quakers.\n\n===October 29: CAA at Penn===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= CAA vs Penn\n|Visitor= Chicago AA\n|Host= Penn Quakers\n|V1=0|V2=4\n|H1=4|H2=8\n|Date= November 1, 1895\n|Location= Franklin Field, Philadelphia, PA\n|TimeZone= EST\n|StartTime= 3pm\n|ElapsedTime= \n|Attendance=\n|Weather=\n|Referee= [[Laurie Bliss]]\n|Umpire= Leonard and Hatfield\n|Injured= \n|Linesmen= Woodruff\n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\nCAA played rough, dirty in the eyes of some, as they lost to the superior university team of Pennsylvania, 4 to 12. CAA came into this prime matchup 6-1, while outscoring their opponents 142 to 8, and recording 6 shutouts.  Penn on the other hand, was 10-0, having shut out '''all ten opponents,''' and outscoring them 370 to 0.  They had won the last 22 contests they had played in, 19 being shutouts, and had not lost a contest since November 30th, 1893, against the [[1893 Harvard Crimson football team|Harvard Crimson]]. The game was actually considered a success for the CAA, as it was the first points scored against the Eastern school in their 1895 season.  Chicago AA was also the first team in the 1895 season to tie Penn at some point in the game (besides a 0-0 tie of course, as every contest starts off with both teams tied at 0), when Slater managed to score on Quakers, 4-4, midway through the 2nd half.  The Penn team was so beaten up by the semi-pros, John C. Bell, head of the University football committee, took out his Penn players in the fear that too many players would get injured.  Seeing as the score was still tied 4 to 4, he eventually let his players back in, where they would score two unanswered touchdowns for the final 4 to 12 score.  Penn was furious after the game, and on November 7th, they officially declared that the school would never play another athletic club, association, or non-collegiate team again, cancelling their 1895 matchup against undefeated Boston AA. The University juggernauts would end the season 14-0, and were declared national champions by the [[Billingsley Report]], [[Helms Athletic Foundation]], [[Houlgate System]], [[National Championship Foundation]], and co-national champions with [[1895 Yale Bulldogs football team|Yale]] by well-known football historian [[Parke H. Davis]] (all retroactively).\n\n==Roster==\nThere are a few things to note about the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association roster.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local, and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

The Indianapolis Journal described the CAA team as a machine, and gave credit to Brown, Slater, Camp, Hadden and Coffeen for good runs.

Camp would not attend the trip East due to ill health.  Another important event to note is the football teams of Rush Medical College and Lake Forest combining for the remainder of the 1895 season.  Rush would bolster the Lake Forest ranks, while also attempting Lake Forest's reportedly impossible schedule of [[1895 Northwestern Purple football team|Northwestern]], [[1895 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], and [[1895 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]], who at the time had a combined record of 9-3, with Michigan undefeated.  Lake Forest had also just come from contests between the likes of [[1895 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]] and [[1895 Chicago Maroons football team|Chicago]], who had beaten them 52 to 0 and 26 to 5 respectively.  They had even lost to the minor team Amour, 6 to 0, and so when a merger was proposed between them and Rush, the agreement was made.

Blaney attained another touchdown at the beginning of the next half, with Thomas also scoring the last touchdown, and Brown rounding out the score to 30 with his impeccable kicking.

With 10 seconds remaining, it was still Chicago's possession, and with one last shove at the Newton Defensive Line, Full Back Brown rolled into the endzone over a mass of players, achieving a walk-off touchdown and subsequent PAT.  The game could've been won in the first half, had Chicago AA not fumbled on the Newton AC 4 yard line, but besides that the game was close and both sides held up well.  Stevenson was the center of attention for the Athletics, holding the line firm and knocking back Newton's star player,Mr. Draper, numerous times throughout the contest.

The two teams were in poor condition, but MIT was worse, having six substitutes starting, instead of their more experienced players.  The football teams had also played a tie game in 1894, where both organizations were in their prime.  Slater was yet again a star player, pulling off 3 touchdowns, while Hadden played well in his new Right Tackle position, and scored 3 touchdowns himself.  Brown also had a great day, going 7 for 8 in PATs, with 2 touchdowns of his own.  Other players that put points on the board for CAA was Thomas with two and Huddelston with one.  With 4 minutes left to play the game was called, as MIT had absolutely no chance of recovering the deficit, and were thoroughly defeated.\n\n'''October 31st-''' The Philadelphia Inquirer named Chicago AA,\"strongest eleven in the west, college or otherwise.\"  The game against Penn decided to be at 3:00 in the afternoon, with an admission of 50 cents, and an extra 25 for reserved seating.  It would be played at Penn's own [[Franklin Field]], on the corner of 33rd and spruce streets.  The last time the Chicago Athletic Association played the Pennsylvania Quakers, it was 1892, and the situation at hand was remarkably similar to that of the 1895 contest.  Penn was 10-0, having shut out 9 and outscored their opponents 349 to 6.

CAA came into this prime matchup 6-1, while outscoring their opponents 142 to 8, and recording 6 shutouts.  Penn on the other hand, was 10-0, having shut out '''all ten opponents,''' and outscoring them 370 to 0.  They had won the last 22 contests they had played in, 19 being shutouts, and had not lost a contest since November 30th, 1893, against the [[1893 Harvard Crimson football team|Harvard Crimson]]. The game was actually considered a success for the CAA, as it was the first points scored against the Eastern school in their 1895 season.  Chicago AA was also the first team in the 1895 season to tie Penn at some point in the game (besides a 0-0 tie of course, as every contest starts off with both teams tied at 0), when Slater managed to score on Quakers, 4-4, midway through the 2nd half.  The Penn team was so beaten up by the semi-pros, John C. Bell, head of the University football committee, took out his Penn players in the fear that too many players would get injured.  Seeing as the score was still tied 4 to 4, he eventually let his players back in, where they would score two unanswered touchdowns for the final 4 to 12 score.  Penn was furious after the game, and on November 7th, they officially declared that the school would never play another athletic club, association, or non-collegiate team again, cancelling their 1895 matchup against undefeated Boston AA. The University juggernauts would end the season 14-0, and were declared national champions by the [[Billingsley Report]], [[Helms Athletic Foundation]], [[Houlgate System]], [[National Championship Foundation]], and co-national champions with [[1895 Yale Bulldogs football team|Yale]] by well-known football historian [[Parke H. Davis]] (all retroactively).\n\n==Roster==\nThere are a few things to note about the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association roster.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local, and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

From 1979 to 1982, he completed his thesis entitled \"Nitroallyl-halogenide und -ester als effiziente Verkn\u00fcpfungsreagenzien\" at ETH ([[Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule]]) Zurich (Switzerland) in Prof. [[Dieter Seebach]]'s group. He then spent 4 years at the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]] (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) at the [[Pierre and Marie Curie University|Pierre et Marie Curie University]] in [[Paris]] in the group of Prof. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Normant. During this period, he studied carbozincation reactions using [[allylic]] reagents and prepared [[Organometallic|bimetallic]] compounds bearing two different metals ([[Lithium]], [[Magnesium]] or [[Zinc]]) on the same carbon atom. He then joined Prof. Martin F. Semmelhack's laboratory for a [[Postdoctoral researcher|post-doctoral]] fellowship during which he worked on the use of [[indole]]s-[[chromium]] complexes in organic synthesis. In 1987, he accepted a position as [[Assistant professor|Assistant Professor]] in the Department of Chemistry at the [[University of Michigan]] at [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] (MI, USA) where he developed the first methods for the preparation of polyfunctional [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallic]] zinc species.

He studied chemistry at the IUT ([[University Institutes of Technology|Institut Universitaire de Technologie]]) in Strasbourg, then at the ENSCS (\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure de Chimie de Strasbourg). From 1979 to 1982, he completed his thesis entitled \"Nitroallyl-halogenide und -ester als effiziente Verkn\u00fcpfungsreagenzien\" at ETH ([[Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule]]) Zurich (Switzerland) in Prof. [[Dieter Seebach]]'s group. He then spent 4 years at the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]] (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) at the [[Pierre and Marie Curie University|Pierre et Marie Curie University]] in [[Paris]] in the group of Prof. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Normant. During this period, he studied carbozincation reactions using [[allylic]] reagents and prepared [[Organometallic|bimetallic]] compounds bearing two different metals ([[Lithium]], [[Magnesium]] or [[Zinc]]) on the same carbon atom. He then joined Prof. Martin F. Semmelhack's laboratory for a [[Postdoctoral researcher|post-doctoral]] fellowship during which he worked on the use of [[Indole|indoles]]-[[chromium]] complexes in organic synthesis. In 1987, he accepted a position as [[Assistant professor|Assistant Professor]] in the Department of Chemistry at the [[University of Michigan]] at [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] (MI, USA) where he developed the first methods for the preparation of polyfunctional [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallic]] zinc species. In 1991, he was promoted to [[Professor]] at the same University before moving to [[Marburg]] (Germany) in 1992, where he was offered a position as Professor of [[Organic chemistry|Organic Chemistry]] in the Department of Chemistry at the [[Philipps-Universit\u00e4t|Philips-Universit\u00e4t]] University. He continued his work on the chemistry of polyfunctional organozinciques and their use in [[asymmetric synthesis]]. In 1999, he was offered a position as Professor of Organic Chemistry at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t - LMU)<ref>{{cite web|title=LMU|url=http://www.knochel.cup.uni-muenchen.de/prof-dr-paul-knochel/curriculum-vitae/|publication-date=}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=D\u00e9partement de chimie de LMU|url=https://www.cup.lmu.de/en/departments/chemistry/people/prof-dr-paul-knochel/|publication-date=}}</ref> which he still holds in 2019. He has developed new methods for the preparation of polyfunctional organometallic species as well as numerous synthetic methods using organometallic reagents or catalysts.\n\n== Scientific work ==\nPaul Knochel has developed a series of new methods for the preparation of polyfunctional organometallic species of zinc<ref>Ellwart, M.; Knochel, P., \u00ab Preparation of Solid, Substituted Allylic Zinc Reagents and Their Reactions with Electrophiles \u00bb, ''Angew.

In the first round, only teams competing in the [[2012\u201313 Segunda Liga]] (excluding reserve teams from Primeira Liga clubs) take part. The sixteen teams are drawn into four groups of four teams, where each team plays against the other three in a single [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format. The group winners and runners-up advance to the second round. \nIn the second round, the eight teams that qualified from the previous round are joined by the six Primeira Liga teams placed 9th to 14th in [[2011\u201312 Primeira Liga|the previous season]] and the two teams promoted to [[2012\u201313 Primeira Liga]]. Two-legged home-and-away fixtures are played between Segunda Liga teams qualifying from the first round and Primeira Liga teams entering this round, and the winner advances to the third round.\n\nThe third round features the eight winners of the previous round the remaining eight Primeira Liga teams, ranked 1st to 8th in the previous season. Similarly to the first round, the sixteen teams are drawn into four groups of four teams, according to a seeding based on their classification in the previous season.

In the first round, only teams competing in the [[2012\u201313 Segunda Liga]] (excluding reserve teams from Primeira Liga clubs) take part. The sixteen teams are drawn into four groups of four teams, where each team plays against the other three in a single [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format. The group winners and runners-up advance to the second round. \nIn the second round, the eight teams that qualified from the previous round are joined by the six Primeira Liga teams placed 9th to 14th in [[2011\u201312 Primeira Liga|the previous season]] and the two teams promoted to [[2012\u201313 Primeira Liga]]. Two-legged home-and-away fixtures are played between Segunda Liga teams qualifying from the first round and Primeira Liga teams entering this round, and the winner advances to the third round.\n\nThe third round features the eight winners of the previous round the remaining eight Primeira Liga teams, ranked 1st to 8th in the previous season. Similarly to the first round, the sixteen teams are drawn into four groups of four teams, according to a seeding based on their classification in the previous season. Each team plays against the other three in a single round-robin format, and only the group winners advance to the knockout phase. The knockout phase consists of semi-finals and one final, both decided in one-legged fixtures. The final match is played at a neutral venue.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Round\n!Teams entering in this round\n!Teams advancing from previous round\n|-\n!First round<br/ >(16 teams)\n|\n*16 teams competing in the [[2012\u201313 Segunda Liga]]\n|\n|-\n!Second round<br />(16 teams)\n|\n*6 teams ranked 9th\u201314th in the [[2011\u201312 Primeira Liga]]\n*2 teams promoted to the [[2012\u201313 Primeira Liga]]\n|\n*4 group winners from the first round\n*4 group runners-up from the first round\n|-\n!Third round<br />(16 teams)\n|\n*8 teams ranked 1st\u20138th in the [[2011\u201312 Primeira Liga]]\n|\n*8 winners from the second round\n|-\n!Knockout phase<br />(4 teams)\n|\n|\n*4 group winners from the third round\n|}\n\n== Teams ==\nThe 32 teams competing in the two professional tiers of Portuguese football for the 2012\u201313 season are eligible to participate in this competition.

She described her early home life as a difficult one, in which she experienced abuse and financial hardship. She first attended an alternative school, which she liked, but she later moved to a public school in the sixth grade, which was \"...a huge, terrible change.\" When she was seventeen years old, Crabb enrolled in a [[Women's studies|Women's Studies]] class. During this time, \"...I started retreating from society and dealing with some abuse stuff.\" Some of her friends participated in heated protests against United States intervention in Central America. She did not attend the protests, but the brutal experiences of her friends left an impression on her. She then moved to [[Plainfield, Vermont]], where she worked at the [[Institute for social ecology|Institute for Social Ecology]] and lived for three years. During this period, she began to explore [[anarchism]] in her personal studies.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFollowing her time in Vermont, Crabb moved [[Portland, Oregon]]. She joined the local chapter of [[Food Not Bombs]], after seeing a listing in the local paper that stated some people were interested in starting a local chapter. She lived in a communal house during this period. However, she left the communal house after a falling out.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Doris zine ==\n \n\nIn 1993, Crabb moved [[Berkeley, California]], and she explains in interviews that she began her zine in this period.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|last1=Rasmussen|first1=Debbie|title=An Interview with Cindy Ovenrack Crabb|journal=Punk Planet|date=September\u2013October 2006|issue=75|url=http://zinewiki.com/An_Interview_with_Cindy_Ovenrack_Crabb|accessdate=19 December 2017}}</ref> She was inspired by [[Miranda July]] and [[Johanna Fateman]]\u2019s zine ''Snarla''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rasmussen|first1=Debbie|title=An Interview with Cindy Ovenrack Crabb|journal=Punk Planet|date=September\u2013October 2006|issue=75|url=http://zinewiki.com/An_Interview_with_Cindy_Ovenrack_Crabb|accessdate=19 December 2017}}</ref> She was particularly interested in [[Secrecy|secrets]], and her zine had a journal-like, confessional quality. As she explained in an interview, <blockquote>\"When I started ''Doris'', I was obsessed with secrets. I felt like everything was secret inside of me pretty much. I definitely had concrete secrets about abuse, about family, and about abusive situations I put myself in, and also feeling crazy. I was very afraid of going crazy. I also had secrets about how beautiful I thought things were. A lot of my friends were very tough and thought everything was disgusting capitalism. And I thought, 'But look at all this beautiful stuff just laying around in hidden places,' and that was secret too.\n\nThe main reason I started writing zines was because I was obsessed with how alienated people were. Why did we just talk about music and tattoos, or Foucault? I wanted to break the barriers of what you could talk about. In the beginning I wanted to learn to write about political stuff. And then I stopped caring as much about that.\"<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>Crabb became close friends with the [[Cometbus]] zine editor, [[Aaron Cometbus|Aaron Elliott]], and was later to form the bands Astrid Oto and The Blank Fight with Elliott.<ref>{{cite web|last1=(No Idea)|first1=Sean|title=Astrid Oto: Self-titled: CD|url=http://razorcake.org/archive-astrid-oto-self-titled|website=Razorcake|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=July 2009}}</ref> \n\nHer diaries, papers, and website are archived at the [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study]] at Harvard\u2019s [[Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Wax|url=http://wax.lib.harvard.edu/collections/archives.do?seed=1938&primColl=261&coll=261&lang=eng&liveWebUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dorisdorisdoris.com%2F|website=Schlesinger Library}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n=== Books and articles ===\n* \"How Jane Helped 11,000 Women Get Abortions When the Procedure Was Outlawed.\" ''Teen Vogue'' (2017).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/how-jane-helped-11000-women-get-abortions-when-the-procedure-was-outlawed|title=This Is What Life Was REALLY Like Before Abortion Was Legal|last=Crabb|first=Cindy|work=Teen Vogue|access-date=2017-12-23|language=en}}</ref>\n* Learning Good Consent: On Healthy Relationships and Survivor Support, (editor) AK Press (2016).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.akpress.org/learning-good-consent.html|title=Learning Good Consent  {{!}} AK Press|website=www.akpress.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-23}}</ref>\n* \"Feminism\u2026Anarchism\u2026Anarchafeminism\" (comic) in ''Perspectives on Anarchist Theory'' No. 29 IAS Press (2016).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.akpress.org/perspectivesonanarchisttheorymagazine.html|title=Perspectives On Anarchist Theory  {{!}} AK Press|website=www.akpress.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-23}}</ref>\n* \"Healthy Relationships\" (essay) in ''Stay Solid!

She described her early home life as a difficult one, in which she experienced abuse and financial hardship. She first attended an alternative school, which she liked, but she later moved to a public school in the sixth grade, which was \"...a huge, terrible change.\" When she was seventeen years old, Crabb enrolled in a [[Women's studies|Women's Studies]] class. During this time, \"...I started retreating from society and dealing with some abuse stuff.\" Some of her friends participated in heated protests against United States intervention in Central America. She did not attend the protests, but the brutal experiences of her friends left an impression on her. She then moved to [[Plainfield, Vermont]], where she worked at the [[Institute for social ecology|Institute for Social Ecology]] and lived for three years. During this period, she began to explore [[anarchism]] in her personal studies.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFollowing her time in Vermont, Crabb moved [[Portland, Oregon]]. She joined the local chapter of [[Food Not Bombs]], after seeing a listing in the local paper that stated some people were interested in starting a local chapter. She lived in a communal house during this period. However, she left the communal house after a falling out.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Doris zine ==\n \n\nIn 1993, Crabb moved [[Berkeley, California]], and she explains in interviews that she began her zine in this period.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|last1=Rasmussen|first1=Debbie|title=An Interview with Cindy Ovenrack Crabb|journal=Punk Planet|date=September\u2013October 2006|issue=75|url=http://zinewiki.com/An_Interview_with_Cindy_Ovenrack_Crabb|accessdate=19 December 2017}}</ref> She was inspired by [[Miranda July]] and [[Johanna Fateman]]\u2019s zine ''Snarla''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rasmussen|first1=Debbie|title=An Interview with Cindy Ovenrack Crabb|journal=Punk Planet|date=September\u2013October 2006|issue=75|url=http://zinewiki.com/An_Interview_with_Cindy_Ovenrack_Crabb|accessdate=19 December 2017}}</ref> She was particularly interested in [[Secrecy|secrets]], and her zine had a journal-like, confessional quality. As she explained in an interview, <blockquote>\"When I started ''Doris'', I was obsessed with secrets. I felt like everything was secret inside of me pretty much. I definitely had concrete secrets about abuse, about family, and about abusive situations I put myself in, and also feeling crazy. I was very afraid of going crazy. I also had secrets about how beautiful I thought things were. A lot of my friends were very tough and thought everything was disgusting capitalism. And I thought, 'But look at all this beautiful stuff just laying around in hidden places,' and that was secret too.\n\nThe main reason I started writing zines was because I was obsessed with how alienated people were. Why did we just talk about music and tattoos, or Foucault? I wanted to break the barriers of what you could talk about. In the beginning I wanted to learn to write about political stuff. And then I stopped caring as much about that.\"<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>Crabb became close friends with the [[Cometbus]] zine editor, [[Aaron Elliott]], and was later to form the bands Astrid Oto and The Blank Fight with Elliott.<ref>{{cite web|last1=(No Idea)|first1=Sean|title=Astrid Oto: Self-titled: CD|url=http://razorcake.org/archive-astrid-oto-self-titled|website=Razorcake|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=July 2009}}</ref> \n\nHer diaries, papers, and website are archived at the [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study]] at Harvard\u2019s [[Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Wax|url=http://wax.lib.harvard.edu/collections/archives.do?seed=1938&primColl=261&coll=261&lang=eng&liveWebUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dorisdorisdoris.com%2F|website=Schlesinger Library}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n=== Books and articles ===\n* \"How Jane Helped 11,000 Women Get Abortions When the Procedure Was Outlawed.\" ''Teen Vogue'' (2017).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/how-jane-helped-11000-women-get-abortions-when-the-procedure-was-outlawed|title=This Is What Life Was REALLY Like Before Abortion Was Legal|last=Crabb|first=Cindy|work=Teen Vogue|access-date=2017-12-23|language=en}}</ref>\n* Learning Good Consent: On Healthy Relationships and Survivor Support, (editor) AK Press (2016).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.akpress.org/learning-good-consent.html|title=Learning Good Consent  {{!}} AK Press|website=www.akpress.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-23}}</ref>\n* \"Feminism\u2026Anarchism\u2026Anarchafeminism\" (comic) in ''Perspectives on Anarchist Theory'' No. 29 IAS Press (2016).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.akpress.org/perspectivesonanarchisttheorymagazine.html|title=Perspectives On Anarchist Theory  {{!}} AK Press|website=www.akpress.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-23}}</ref>\n* \"Healthy Relationships\" (essay) in ''Stay Solid!

Filming begins. @trailerparkboysofficial @SWEARNET #SCF #SunnyvaleCorrectionalFacility}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1998, director [[Mike Clattenburg]] wrote and directed a [[short film]] titled ''[[List of Trailer Park Boys episodes#Specials|One Last Shot]],'' which was shot in black-and-white. The film followed the exploits of two friends, Rob ([[Robb Wells]]) and Gary Williams or GW ([[John Paul Tremblay]]), although it is not based in the same setting as Trailer Park Boys. It was the  first time Robb, John Paul and John Dunsworth worked together. In the 1999 [[feature film]] ''[[List of Trailer Park Boys episodes#Films|Trailer Park Boys]],''  the character Julian states to the camera that he wanted his life to be documented after receiving a telephone psychic's prediction that he would die soon. He hoped that the film would deter others from the life of crime he had chosen.\n\nThe feature film was shown at the [[Atlantic Film Festival]] in 1999, and it caught the attention of producer [[Barrie Dunn]], who saw the potential for a TV series. Clattenburg and Dunn, along with Wells and Tremblay, worked on a proposal for a 13-episode season of the show and traveled to [[Toronto]] to pitch the show to [[The Comedy Network]]. After being turned down, they suddenly decided to pitch the show to [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]] before returning home to [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nThey found that the network was receptive and sent them back with a commitment to a first season, with the provision that a second experienced producer (which ended up being Michael Volpe) be brought on board to assist the team. The first six 30-minute episodes were then written and filmed. Some modifications were made to the characters and storyline for the series, and more humor was added to the series in comparison to the film.\n\nThe biggest change from film to series was the addition of [[Mike Smith (actor)|Mike Smith]]'s \"Bubbles\" character, who was originally developed for the earlier short film ''[[The Cart Boy]]'', a film that Smith, Wells, Tremblay, and Clattenburg worked on together in 1995. Smith's character soon grew from a [[recurring character]] to one of the show's primary protagonists (although in the earlier film, \"Bubbles\" was the name of Smith's character's cat). ''Trailer Park Boys'' resided with Showcase for its first seven seasons.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Beginning|url=http://www.trailerparkboys.com/site_story.php|accessdate=December 9, 2008|publisher=TrailerParkBoys.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217074839/http://trailerparkboys.com/site_story.php|archivedate=December 17, 2008|df=}}</ref> Beginning with the eighth season, the series was released through [[Netflix]].\n\nEarly seasons were shot in various trailer parks in Nova Scotia, but the crew was not welcome to film again due to complaints from residents. Space was purchased and a functional trailer park set was built in Dartmouth for later seasons, giving the staff more freedom than at previous locations. When the series returned from hiatus beginning with Season 8, it was shot at Bible Hill Estates Trailer Park in [[Truro, Nova Scotia]], with every subsequent episode being filmed at that location. After the 12th season, they ceased filming at the location and removed all sets and props from Bible Hill Estates, which still exists as an operating land lease community.\n\n==Plot==\nEpisodes revolve around Sunnyvale Trailer Park residents Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles trying to make money through petty crimes while avoiding the police. Their schemes are complicated by the interference of the park's vindictive [[alcoholic]] supervisor Jim Lahey and his assistant and lover, Randy. Ricky and Julian's incompetence is rivaled by Lahey's drunken ineptitude.\n\nThroughout the series, Ricky and Julian (and Bubbles to a lesser degree) end up in and out of jail, with most of their schemes collapsing into failure. Later seasons adopted a cyclical formula: each season finale featured the boys' schemes succeeding, and their future looking optimistic, while the next season's premiere would show them explaining how everything had gone wrong in the interim. Fans learned to expect that seasons would somehow end with some or all of the main characters going to jail.\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of Trailer Park Boys characters}}\nEach character has his or her own trademark mannerism or trait. [[Julian (character)|Julian]] often takes a leadership role and devises schemes, all while holding a [[Cuba Libre]] on the rocks in his hand. [[Ricky LaFleur|Ricky]] believes himself to be dumb, and his speech is often laced with [[malapropism]]s that fans call \"Rickyisms\"; he lives in a dilapidated 1975 [[Chrysler New Yorker]], grows marijuana, and often displays a slovenly appearance. [[Bubbles (Trailer Park Boys)|Bubbles]] wears spectacles that magnify his eyes to an unusual extent, drives a go-kart, lives in a shed with many cats, and gets upset when Ricky and Julian fight; he is the least likely to face any repercussions for the trio's illegal activities. Alcoholic trailer park supervisor and ex-cop [[Jim Lahey]] usually attempts to derail the Boys' schemes, and nearly always shoehorns the word \"shit\" into his cautionary [[metaphor]]s that fans call \"Shitisms.\" [[Randy (Trailer Park Boys)|Randy]] is Lahey's assistant and lover; he never wears a shirt unless he absolutely has to and is often taunted for his large gut and addiction to cheeseburgers.\n\nThere are also a number of minor characters. Ricky's wheelchair-bound father Ray is a former trucker and self-declared [[Calvinist]], who is secretly committing [[disability fraud]], in addition to being an alcoholic and gambling addict. Barbara is the trailer park owner and Lahey's promiscuous ex-wife. Cory and Trevor are hapless best friends who assist and idolize Ricky and Julian, often unaware that they will serve as scapegoats when Ricky and Julian's plans inevitably go awry; Jacob later replaces Trevor after his disappearance from Sunnyvale. Lucy is the mother of Ricky's daughter Trinity, while Sarah, a friend, moved in with Lucy after Ricky's first imprisonment. J-Roc is a white aspiring rapper who genuinely thinks he is black; he is rarely seen without his friend Tyrone, who actually is black.\n\n===Main cast members===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\"| Character\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:13%;\"| Actor\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"12\" | Seasons\n|-\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 1\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 2\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 3\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 4\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 5\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 6\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 7\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 8\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 9\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 10\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 11\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 12\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Julian (character)|Julian]]\n| [[John Paul Tremblay]]\n| colspan=\"12\" {{cMain|Main}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Ricky (Trailer Park Boys)|Ricky]]\n| [[Robb Wells]]\n| colspan=\"12\" {{cMain|Main}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Bubbles (Trailer Park Boys)|Bubbles]]\n| [[Mike Smith (actor)|Mike Smith]]\n| colspan=\"12\" {{cMain|Main}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Jim Lahey]]\n| [[John Dunsworth]]\n| colspan=\"12\" {{cMain|Main}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Randy (Trailer Park Boys)|Randy]]\n| [[Patrick Roach]]\n| colspan=\"12\" {{cMain|Main}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Sarah\n| [[Sarah E.

Tension grew between the producers (Barrie Dunn and Mike Volpe) and Jackson due to working conditions and creative disagreements. Jackson gave notice that he would leave the show after season 6, as he was close friends with the series' creator Mike Clattenburg. Although Jackson had one more season to fulfill on his contract, no legal action was taken against him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://libcom.org/library/trailer-park-boys-what-really-happened-cory-trevor|title=Trailer Park Boys: What really happened to Cory and Trevor|website=libcom.org|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe producers and writers did not directly address the issue of Cory and Trevor leaving the show at the end of season 6, even though they knew of their impending departure for some time beforehand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://saintjohnshawn.com/2007/06/13/trailer-park-boys-what-really-happened-to-corey-and-trevor/ |title=Trailer Park Boys: What really happened to Corey and Trevor... |publisher=SaintJohnShawn.com |date=June 13, 2007 |accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref> Their departure from Sunnyvale was addressed in season 7 and their names have been part of the continuing storyline.

The show focuses on the misadventures of a group of [[trailer park]] residents, some of whom are [[ex-convict]]s, living in the fictional Sunnyvale Trailer Park in [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia]]. The television series, a continuation of Clattenburg's 1999 film of the same title, premiered on [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]] in 2001.<ref name=\"Abbott2010\">{{cite book|author=Stacey Abbott|title=The Cult TV Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gA7qK_VhVH0C&pg=PA84|accessdate=June 6, 2011|date=March 10, 2010|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84885-026-2|pages=84\u2013}}</ref> There are three films in the series: ''[[Trailer Park Boys: The Movie|The Movie]]'', released on October 6, 2006; ''[[Trailer Park Boys: Countdown to Liquor Day|Countdown to Liquor Day]]'', released on September 25, 2009; and ''[[Trailer Park Boys: Don't Legalize It|Don't Legalize It]]'', released on April 18, 2014.\n\nThe seventh and final season of the series' original run on Showcase ended in 2007, with its final episode, \"Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys\", premiering as a one-hour special on December 7, 2008.\n\nIn 2013, [[Robb Wells]], [[John Paul Tremblay]], and [[Mike Smith (actor)|Mike Smith]], the actors who portrayed [[Ricky LaFleur|Ricky]], [[Julian (character)|Julian]], and [[Bubbles (Trailer Park Boys)|Bubbles]], purchased the rights to the show from the original producers and created their own internet streaming network, \"Swearnet\". In March 2014, Swearnet began co-producing new seasons of the show, partnering with the streaming service [[Netflix]] to produce an eighth and ninth season, as well as three new specials. Season 8 premiered on September 5, 2014, followed by Season 9 on March 27, 2015.\n\nLater that year, the show received the green light for two more seasons and began production on Season 10.

Filming begins. @trailerparkboysofficial @SWEARNET #SCF #SunnyvaleCorrectionalFacility}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1998, director [[Mike Clattenburg]] wrote and directed a [[short film]] titled ''[[List of Trailer Park Boys episodes#Specials|One Last Shot]],'' which was shot in black-and-white. The film followed the exploits of two friends, Rob ([[Robb Wells]]) and Gary Williams or GW ([[John Paul Tremblay]]), although it is not based in the same setting as Trailer Park Boys. It was the  first time Robb, John Paul and John Dunsworth worked together. In the 1999 [[feature film]] ''[[List of Trailer Park Boys episodes#Specials|Trailer Park Boys]],''  the character Julian states to the camera that he wanted his life to be documented after receiving a telephone psychic's prediction that he would die soon. He hoped that the film would deter others from the life of crime he had chosen.\n\nThe feature film was shown at the [[Atlantic Film Festival]] in 1999, and it caught the attention of producer [[Barrie Dunn]], who saw the potential for a TV series. Clattenburg and Dunn, along with Wells and Tremblay, worked on a proposal for a 13-episode season of the show and traveled to [[Toronto]] to pitch the show to [[The Comedy Network]]. After being turned down, they suddenly decided to pitch the show to [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]] before returning home to [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nThey found that the network was receptive and sent them back with a commitment to a first season, with the provision that a second experienced producer (which ended up being Michael Volpe) be brought on board to assist the team. The first six 30-minute episodes were then written and filmed. Some modifications were made to the characters and storyline for the series, and more humor was added to the series in comparison to the film.\n\nThe biggest change from film to series was the addition of [[Mike Smith (actor)|Mike Smith]]'s \"Bubbles\" character, who was originally developed for the earlier short film ''[[The Cart Boy]]'', a film that Smith, Wells, Tremblay, and Clattenburg worked on together in 1995. Smith's character soon grew from a [[recurring character]] to one of the show's primary protagonists (although in the earlier film, \"Bubbles\" was the name of Smith's character's cat). ''Trailer Park Boys'' resided with Showcase for its first seven seasons.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Beginning|url=http://www.trailerparkboys.com/site_story.php|accessdate=December 9, 2008|publisher=TrailerParkBoys.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217074839/http://trailerparkboys.com/site_story.php|archivedate=December 17, 2008|df=}}</ref> Beginning with the eighth season, the series was released through [[Netflix]].\n\nEarly seasons were shot in various trailer parks in Nova Scotia, but the crew was not welcome to film again due to complaints from residents. Space was purchased and a functional trailer park set was built in Dartmouth for later seasons, giving the staff more freedom than at previous locations. When the series returned from hiatus beginning with Season 8, it was shot at Bible Hill Estates Trailer Park in [[Truro, Nova Scotia]], with every subsequent episode being filmed at that location. After the 12th season, they ceased filming at the location and removed all sets and props from Bible Hill Estates, which still exists as an operating land lease community.\n\n==Plot==\nEpisodes revolve around Sunnyvale Trailer Park residents Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles trying to make money through petty crimes while avoiding the police. Their schemes are complicated by the interference of the park's vindictive [[alcoholic]] supervisor Jim Lahey and his assistant and lover, Randy. Ricky and Julian's incompetence is rivaled by Lahey's drunken ineptitude.\n\nThroughout the series, Ricky and Julian (and Bubbles to a lesser degree) end up in and out of jail, with most of their schemes collapsing into failure. Later seasons adopted a cyclical formula: each season finale featured the boys' schemes succeeding, and their future looking optimistic, while the next season's premiere would show them explaining how everything had gone wrong in the interim. Fans learned to expect that seasons would somehow end with some or all of the main characters going to jail.\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of Trailer Park Boys characters}}\nEach character has his or her own trademark mannerism or trait. [[Julian (character)|Julian]] often takes a leadership role and devises schemes, all while holding a [[Cuba Libre]] on the rocks in his hand. [[Ricky LaFleur|Ricky]] believes himself to be dumb, and his speech is often laced with [[malapropism]]s that fans call \"Rickyisms\"; he lives in a dilapidated 1975 [[Chrysler New Yorker]], grows marijuana, and often displays a slovenly appearance. [[Bubbles (Trailer Park Boys)|Bubbles]] wears spectacles that magnify his eyes to an unusual extent, drives a go-kart, lives in a shed with many cats, and gets upset when Ricky and Julian fight; he is the least likely to face any repercussions for the trio's illegal activities. Alcoholic trailer park supervisor and ex-cop [[Jim Lahey]] usually attempts to derail the Boys' schemes, and nearly always shoehorns the word \"shit\" into his cautionary [[metaphor]]s that fans call \"Shitisms.\" [[Randy (Trailer Park Boys)|Randy]] is Lahey's assistant and lover; he never wears a shirt unless he absolutely has to and is often taunted for his large gut and addiction to cheeseburgers.\n\nThere are also a number of minor characters. Ricky's wheelchair-bound father Ray is a former trucker and self-declared [[Calvinist]], who is secretly committing [[disability fraud]], in addition to being an alcoholic and gambling addict. Barbara is the trailer park owner and Lahey's promiscuous ex-wife. Cory and Trevor are hapless best friends who assist and idolize Ricky and Julian, often unaware that they will serve as scapegoats when Ricky and Julian's plans inevitably go awry; Jacob later replaces Trevor after his disappearance from Sunnyvale. Lucy is the mother of Ricky's daughter Trinity, while Sarah, a friend, moved in with Lucy after Ricky's first imprisonment. J-Roc is a white aspiring rapper who genuinely thinks he is black; he is rarely seen without his friend Tyrone, who actually is black.\n\n===Main cast members===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\"| Character\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:13%;\"| Actor\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"12\" | Seasons\n|-\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 1\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 2\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 3\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 4\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 5\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 6\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 7\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 8\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 9\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 10\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 11\n!style=\"width:5%;\"| 12\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Julian (character)|Julian]]\n| [[John Paul Tremblay]]\n| colspan=\"12\" {{cMain|Main}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Ricky (Trailer Park Boys)|Ricky]]\n| [[Robb Wells]]\n| colspan=\"12\" {{cMain|Main}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Bubbles (Trailer Park Boys)|Bubbles]]\n| [[Mike Smith (actor)|Mike Smith]]\n| colspan=\"12\" {{cMain|Main}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Jim Lahey]]\n| [[John Dunsworth]]\n| colspan=\"12\" {{cMain|Main}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Randy (Trailer Park Boys)|Randy]]\n| [[Patrick Roach]]\n| colspan=\"12\" {{cMain|Main}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Sarah\n| [[Sarah E.

Tension grew between the producers (Barrie Dunn and Mike Volpe) and Jackson due to working conditions and creative disagreements. Jackson gave notice that he would leave the show after season 6, as he was close friends with the series' creator Mike Clattenburg. Although Jackson had one more season to fulfill on his contract, no legal action was taken against him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://libcom.org/library/trailer-park-boys-what-really-happened-cory-trevor|title=Trailer Park Boys: What really happened to Cory and Trevor|website=libcom.org|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe producers and writers did not directly address the issue of Cory and Trevor leaving the show at the end of season 6, even though they knew of their impending departure for some time beforehand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://saintjohnshawn.com/2007/06/13/trailer-park-boys-what-really-happened-to-corey-and-trevor/ |title=Trailer Park Boys: What really happened to Corey and Trevor... |publisher=SaintJohnShawn.com |date=June 13, 2007 |accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref> Their departure from Sunnyvale was addressed in season 7 and their names have been part of the continuing storyline.

The show is loosely scripted, with much of the dialogue ad-libbed from basic plot points. These aspects are intended to evoke a sense of [[Verisimilitude (fiction)|realism]]. The trio have stated that many of the show's most popular moments were not in the script.\n\nFurthering the myth that ''Trailer Park Boys'' is nonfiction, many of the actors (particularly [[Robb Wells]], [[John Paul Tremblay]], [[Mike Smith (actor)|Mike Smith]], [[John Dunsworth]] and [[Patrick Roach]]) often make public appearances [[breaking character|in character]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe show became very successful in many countries.
