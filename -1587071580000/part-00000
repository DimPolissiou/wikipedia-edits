Her superhero alias is Thunder Girl. She is very responsible, a straight A student, and tries to play by the \"no powers\" rule. She has telekinesis, freeze breath, and heat breath. In \"[[List of The Thundermans episodes#ep13|Thundersense]]\", Phoebe develops a new ability called Thundersense, which warns her if she and others are in danger. Since the beginning of the third season, Phoebe has been training to become a superhero and officially becomes Thunder Girl in \"[[List of The Thundermans episodes#ep69|Thundermans: Secret Revealed]]\". However, in \"[[List of The Thundermans episodes#ep82|Come What Mayhem]]\", during an attempt to stop one of Max's former pranks from going off, Phoebe accidentally absorbs Dark Mayhem's powers and turns evil. At the beginning of the series, Phoebe is 14 years old.<ref name=\"Series Order\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/02/nickelodeon-pilot-the-thundermans-picked-up-to-series-a-young-lead-recast/|title=Nickelodeon Pilot ''The Thundermans'' Picked Up to Series, a Young Lead Recast|work=Deadline Hollywood|author=Nellie Andreeva|date=February 14, 2013|access-date=March 31, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Maxiumus Octavius Max Thunderman ===\n{{visible anchor|Max Thunderman}} ([[Jack Griffo]]) is a twin to Phoebe and older brother to Nora, Billy, and Chloe. His powers include telekinesis, freeze breath, and heat breath. He is the antagonist-turned-anti-hero. Despite being raised within a family of superheroes, Max originally aspires to become a supervillain for the first three seasons. His sole reason was to not be second best to Phoebe as a hero. In \"[[List of The Thundermans episodes#ep69|Thundermans: Secret Revealed]]\", he finally has a change of heart and makes a life-changing decision to abandon the dark side and become a fighter for justice, using his powers and high-tech gadgets for the greater good. The fourth season focuses on Max readjusting to his new daily life as a superhero instead of an evil-doer, as he tackles challenges working with Phoebe in Z-Force training, which jeopardizes his friendship with Dr. Colosso. His basement bedroom serves as his secret lair, filled with high-tech gadgets and posters of the Villain League. In the fourth season, his lair has posters of the Z-Force and other superhero posters. His lair is accessible through a slide leading to his bed underneath a tea table next to the couch in the living room and it is also where he keeps his best friend and mentor, Dr. Colosso, a supervillain Thunder Man turned into a rabbit.

It is revealed that Barb gave birth to Billy in the air while her husband was transporting her to a hospital, implying that Billy likely hit his head after birth, which is probably why he is sometimes unintelligent.\n\n=== Hank Thunderman ===\nHank Thunderman ([[Chris Tallman]]) is the husband to Barb and father to Phoebe, Max, Nora, Billy, and Chloe. His superhero alias is Thunder Man. His superpowers are super-strength and flight. Hank has now half-unwillingly retired as a superhero in order to give his children a stable and normal home.

It is shown that Dr. Colosso likes Max very much.\n\nIn \"[[List of The Thundermans episodes#ep44|A Hero Is Born]]\", Dr. Colosso is temporarily turned back to his human form so he can go get an award, though it is actually a plot by fellow villains King Crab, Lady Web, and Scalestro to get him kicked out due to being inactive in villainy. Although the three Villain League members are unaware about him having been trapped in rabbit form all this time. Other times when Dr. Colosso is turned human is when Phoebe has him pose as her uncle on family game night and when he steals the animalizer in a plot to disrupt Hank and Barb's wedding vow renewal, similar to when he disrupted their first wedding.\n\nDr. Colosso's puppet is performed by [[The Chiodo Brothers|Stephen, Edward, and Charles Chiodo]], with assistance in later episodes from [[Kevin Carlson]].\n\n=== Evan ===\nEvan (Elijah Nelson) is a student at Hiddenville High and a member of Sarah's group of smart students.

He is a 50-year-old man with family, but looks like a teenage boy because his superpower is that he does not age.\n\n=== Sarah ===\nSarah (Keely Marshall) is a student at Hiddenville High who has an obsessive crush on Max. She is also a friend of Phoebe's. She is very smart and is the apparent leader of a group of smart students, commonly known as \"Sarah's Group\".\n\n=== Mrs. Wong ===\nMrs. Wong ([[Helen Hong]]) is the aunt of Darcy and the owner of a pizza restaurant who is never nice to anyone, especially to the Thundermans.\n\nIn \"[[List of The Thundermans episodes#ep6|This Looks Like a Job For...]]\" Phoebe and Max take up jobs in her restaurant, but end up getting fired after they inadvertently destroy her kitchen, thus igniting her contempt for the twins and their family. In \"[[List of The Thundermans episodes#ep69|Thundermans: Secret Revealed]]\", she exposes the Thundermans to the people in Hiddenville upon figuring out their secret identities. Later, it is revealed that her first name is Olympia. In \"[[List of The Thundermans episodes#ep71|Thundermans: Banished!]]\" her pizza restaurant is accidentally destroyed by Phoebe and Max's attempts to stop an explosion, causing Super President Kickbutt to relocate the Thundermans to Antarctica and reassign their post to Falcon Man's family. She later rebuilds it, only for Candi Falconman to crash through her roof. She is among the Hiddenville residents to be fooled by Super President Kickbutt's fake power-removal on the Thundermans.\n\n=== Principal Bradford ===\nPrincipal Tad Bradford<ref>{{cite episode|network=[[Nickelodeon]]|series=The Thundermans|season=4|number=10|title=[[List of The Thundermans episodes#ep79|May Z-Force Be with You]]|date=March 4, 2017|time=18:25|quote='''Principal Bradford''': Tad Bradford's life is not sad!}}</ref> ([[Jeff Meacham]]) is Hiddenville High's principal.

The Goose Creek men became leaders of the early Indian trade, and by the 1690s many held important offices in the colonial government. At first the Goose Creek men dealt mainly in [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|Indian slaves]], while later the [[deerskin trade]] dominated.

During the Cold War, the Naval Base (1902\u20131996) became the third largest U.S. homeport serving over 80 ships and submarines. In addition, the [[Charleston Naval Shipyard]] repaired frigates, destroyers, cruisers, sub tenders, and submarines. The shipyard was also equipped for the refueling of nuclear subs.\n\nDuring this period, the Weapons Station was the Atlantic Fleet's loadout base for all nuclear [[ballistic missile submarine]]s. Two SSBN \"Boomer\" squadrons and a sub tender were homeported at the Weapons Station, while one SSN attack squadron, [[Submarine Squadron 4]], and a sub tender were homeported at the Naval Base. At the 1996 closure of the Station's Polaris Missile Facility Atlantic (POMFLANT), over 2,500 nuclear warheads and their [[UGM-27 Polaris]], [[UGM-73 Poseidon]], and [[UGM-96 Trident I]] delivery missiles ([[SLBM]]) were stored and maintained, guarded by a U.S. Marine Corps security force company.\n\nIn 2010, the Air Force base (3,877 acres) and Naval Weapons Station (>17,000 acres) merged to form [[Joint Base Charleston]].

The Goose Creek men became leaders of the early Indian trade, and by the 1690s many held important offices in the colonial government. At first the Goose Creek men dealt mainly in [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|Indian slaves]], while later the [[deerskin trade]] dominated.

In addition, the [[Charleston Naval Shipyard]] repaired frigates, destroyers, cruisers, sub tenders, and submarines. The shipyard was also equipped for the refueling of nuclear subs.\n\nDuring this period, the Weapons Station was the Atlantic Fleet's loadout base for all nuclear [[ballistic missile submarine]]s. Two SSBN \"Boomer\" squadrons and a sub tender were homeported at the Weapons Station, while one SSN attack squadron, [[Submarine Squadron 4]], and a sub tender were homeported at the Naval Base. At the 1996 closure of the Station's Polaris Missile Facility Atlantic (POMFLANT), over 2,500 nuclear warheads and their [[UGM-27 Polaris]], [[UGM-73 Poseidon]], and [[UGM-96 Trident I]] delivery missiles ([[SLBM]]) were stored and maintained, guarded by a U.S. Marine Corps security force company.\n\nIn 2010, the Air Force base (3,877 acres) and Naval Weapons Station (>17,000 acres) merged to form [[Joint Base Charleston]].

These differences can occur due to the sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies with [[latitude]]. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale [[atmospheric circulation]]s: the Hadley Cell, the Ferrel Cell, the Polar Cell, and the [[jet stream]].  Weather systems in the [[mid-latitudes]], such as [[extratropical cyclone]]s, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow.  Because the Earth's [[Earth's rotation|axis]] is tilted relative to its orbital plane, [[sunlight]] is incident at different angles at different times of the year.  On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range \u00b140&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u221240&nbsp;\u00b0F to 100&nbsp;\u00b0F) annually.  Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's [[orbit]] can affect the amount and distribution of [[solar energy]] received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]].\n\nSurface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences.  Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes, as most atmospheric heating is due to contact with the Earth's surface while radiative losses to space are mostly constant.  Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] for a future time and a given location.  The Earth's weather system is a [[chaos theory|chaotic system]]; as a result, small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole.  Human attempts to [[weather control|control the weather]] have occurred throughout history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.\n\nStudying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth.  A famous landmark in the [[Solar System]], [[Jupiter]]'s [[Great Red Spot]], is an [[Anticyclone|anticyclonic]] storm known to have existed for at least 300 years.  However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies.  A [[stellar corona|star's corona]] is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System.  The movement of mass ejected from the [[Sun]] is known as the [[solar wind]].\n\n==Causes==\n[[Image:Stormclouds.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Stratocumulus cloud|Cumulus mediocris]] cloud surrounded by [[stratocumulus]]]]\nOn [[Earth]], the common [[List of meteorological phenomena|weather phenomena]] include wind, [[cloud]], rain, snow, [[fog]] and [[dust storm]]s.

These differences can occur due to the [[sun]] angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics.

Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy [[rain]], [[snow]] and the [[wind chill]], forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead to survive through them.\n\nTropical weather forecasting is different from that at higher latitudes. The sun shines more directly on the tropics than on higher latitudes (at least in the average over a year), which makes the tropics warm (Stevens 2011). And, the vertical direction (up, as one stands on the Earth's surface) is perpendicular to the Earth's axis of rotation at the equator, while the axis of rotation and the vertical are the same at the pole; this causes the Earth's rotation to influence the atmospheric circulation more strongly at high latitudes than low. Because of these two factors, clouds and rain storms in the tropics can occur more spontaneously compared to those at higher latitudes, where they are more tightly controlled by larger-scale forces in the atmosphere.

These differences can occur due to the sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies with [[latitude]]. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale [[atmospheric circulation]]s: the Hadley Cell, the Ferrel Cell, the Polar Cell, and the [[jet stream]].  Weather systems in the [[mid-latitudes]], such as [[extratropical cyclone]]s, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow.  Because the Earth's [[Earth's rotation|axis]] is tilted relative to its orbital plane, [[sunlight]] is incident at different angles at different times of the year.  On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range \u00b140&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u221240&nbsp;\u00b0F to 100&nbsp;\u00b0F) annually.  Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's [[orbit]] can affect the amount and distribution of [[solar energy]] received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]].\n\nSurface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences.  Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes, as most atmospheric heating is due to contact with the Earth's surface while radiative losses to space are mostly constant.  Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] for a future time and a given location.  The Earth's weather system is a [[chaos theory|chaotic system]]; as a result, small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole.  Human attempts to [[weather control|control the weather]] have occurred throughout history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.\n\nStudying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth.  A famous landmark in the [[Solar System]], [[Jupiter]]'s [[Great Red Spot]], is an [[Anticyclone|anticyclonic]] storm known to have existed for at least 300 years.

Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy [[rain]], [[snow]] and the [[wind chill]], forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead to survive through them.\n\nTropical weather forecasting is different from that at higher latitudes. The sun shines more directly on the tropics than on higher latitudes (at least in the average over a year), which makes the tropics warm (Stevens 2011). And, the vertical direction (up, as one stands on the Earth's surface) is perpendicular to the Earth's axis of rotation at the equator, while the axis of rotation and the vertical are the same at the pole; this causes the Earth's rotation to influence the atmospheric circulation more strongly at high latitudes than low. Because of these two factors, clouds and rain storms in the tropics can occur more spontaneously compared to those at higher latitudes, where they are more tightly controlled by larger-scale forces in the atmosphere. Because of these differences, clouds and rain are more difficult to forecast in the tropics than at higher latitudes. On the other hand, temperature is easily forecast in the tropics, because it doesn't change much.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/tropical-weather-84224797/|title=Tropical Weather {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|website=www.nature.com|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref>\n\n==Modification==\nThe aspiration to [[Weather modification|control the weather]] is evident throughout human history: from ancient rituals intended to bring rain for crops to the U.S. Military [[Operation Popeye]], an attempt to disrupt [[Military supply chain management|supply lines]] by lengthening the North Vietnamese [[monsoon]].

Inconsistencies in this wind and larger events on the surface of the star, such as [[coronal mass ejection]]s, form a system that has features analogous to conventional weather systems (such as pressure and wind) and is generally known as [[space weather]].  Coronal mass ejections have been tracked as far out in the [[Solar System]] as [[Saturn]].<ref>Bill Christensen.
