T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref> For example, if a person has learned in the past that every time they eat an apple, their throat becomes itchy and swollen, they might assume they are allergic to all fruit. When this person is offered a banana to eat, they reject it upon assuming they are also allergic to it through generalizing that all fruits cause the same reaction. Although this generalization about being allergic to all fruit based on experiences with one fruit could be correct in some cases, it may not be correct in all. Both positive and negative effects have been shown in education through learned generalization and its contrasting notion of [[discrimination learning]].\n\n== '''Overview''' ==\nGeneralization is understood to be directly tied to the [[Transfer of learning|transfer]] of [[knowledge]] across multiple situations.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=J. E.|last2=Shea|first2=T. M.|last3=Bauer|first3=A.M.|title=Generalization and the Effects of Consequences {{!}} Education.com|url=http://www.education.com/reference/article/generalization-effects-consequences/|website=www.education.com|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> The knowledge to be transferred is often referred to as abstractions, because the learner abstracts a rule or pattern of characteristics from previous experiences with similar stimuli.<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref> Generalization allows humans and animals to recognize the similarities in knowledge acquired in one circumstance, allowing for transfer of knowledge onto new situations. This idea rivals the theory of [[situated cognition]], instead stating that one can apply past knowledge to learning in new situations and environments.\n\nGeneralization can be supported and partly explained by the [[connectionism]] approach.<ref>Goldstein, B. E. (2015). Cognitive psychology: connecting mind research and everyday experience. W. Ross MacDonald School Resource Services Library.</ref> Just as artificial intelligences learn to distinguish between different categories by applying past learning to novel situations, humans and animals generalize previously learned properties and patterns onto new situations, thus ''connecting'' the novel experience to past experiences that are similar in one or more ways. This creates a pattern of connections that allows the learner to classify and make assumptions about the novel stimulus, such as when previous experience with seeing a canary allows the learner to predict what other birds will be like. This categorization is a foundational aspect of generalizing.\n\n== '''Research on Generalization''' ==\nIn scientific studies looking at generalization, a generalization gradient is often used. This tool is used to measure how often and how much animals or humans respond to certain stimuli, depending on whether the stimuli are perceived to be similar or different. The curvilinear shape of the gradient is achieved by placing the perceived similarity of a stimulus on the x-axis and the strength of the response on the y-axis.<ref>Boddez, Y., Bennett, M. P., van Esch, S., & Beckers, T. (2017). Bending rules: the shape of the perceptual generalisation gradient is sensitive to inference rules. Cognition & Emotion, 31(7), 1444\u20131452. https://doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2016.1230541</ref>  For example, when measuring responses to color, it is expected that subjects will respond to colors that are similar to each other, like shades of pink after being exposed to red, as opposed to a non-similar shade of blue.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gluck|first1=Mark A.|last2=Mercado|first2=Eduardo|last3=Myers|first3=Catherine E.|title=Learning and memory : from brain to behavior|date=2014|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9781429240147|page=212|edition=2nd}}</ref> The gradient is relatively predictable, with the response to similar stimuli being slightly less strong than the response to the conditioned stimulus, then steadily declining as the presented stimuli become increasingly dissimilar.<ref>The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica. (2019, September 30). Generalization. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.britannica.com/topic/generalization</nowiki></ref>\n\nSeveral studies have suggested that generalization is a fundamental and naturally-occurring learning process for humans. Nine-month-old infants require very few (sometimes only 3) experiences with a category before learning to generalize. In fact, infants generalize so well during early stages of development (such as learning to recognize specific sounds as language) that it can be hard for them to discriminate between variations of the generalized stimuli at later stages of development (such as failing to distinguish between the subtly different sounds of similar phonemes). One potential explanation for why children are such efficient learners is that they operate in accordance with the goal of making their world more predictable, therefore encouraging them to hold strongly to generalizations that effectively help them to navigate their environment.<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref>\n\nSome evidence suggests that children are born with innate processes for accurately generalizing things. For example, children tend to generalize based on taxonomic rather than thematic similarities (an experience with one ball leads to the child identifying other ball-shaped objects as \u201cball\u201d rather than labeling a bat as \u201cball\u201d because a bat is used to hit a ball).<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref>\n\nWakefield, Hall, James, and Goldin (2018) found that children are more flexible in generalizing new verbs when they are taught the verb by observing gestures as opposed to being taught by performing the action themselves.<ref>Wakefield, E. M., Hall, C., James, K. H., & Goldin, M. S. (2018). Gesture for generalization: gesture facilitates flexible learning of words for actions on objects. Developmental Science, 21(5), 1. https://doi.org/10.1111/desc.12656</ref> When helping a child learn a new word, providing more examples of the word increases the child\u2019s capacity to generalize the word to different contexts and situations. Furthermore, writing interventions for grade-school students yield better results when the intervention actively targets generalization as an outcome.<ref>Hier, B. O., Eckert, T. L., Viney, E. A., & Meisinger, E. (2019). Generalization and maintenance effects of writing fluency intervention strategies for elementary-age students: A randomized controlled trial. School Psychology Review, 48(4), 377. https://doi.org/10.17105/SPR-2017-0123.V48-4</ref>\n\nGeneralization has been shown to be refined and/or stabilized after sleep.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=14534586|year=2003|last1=Fenn|first1=KM|last2=Nusbaum|first2=HC|last3=Margoliash|first3=D|title=Consolidation during sleep of perceptual learning of spoken language|volume=425|issue=6958|pages=614\u20136|doi=10.1038/nature01951|journal=Nature}}</ref>\n\n== '''Implications''' ==\nWithout the ability to generalize, it would likely be very difficult to navigate the world in a useful way.<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref> For example, generalization is an important part of how humans learn to trust unfamiliar people<ref>FeldmanHall, O., Dunsmoor, J. E., Tompary, A., Hunter, L. E., Todorov, A., & Phelps, E. A. (2018). Stimulus generalization as a mechanism for learning to trust. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 115(7). doi: 10.1073/pnas.1715227115</ref> and a necessary element in language acquisition.<ref>Arnon, I., & Clark, E. V. (Eds.). (2011). ''Experience, variation and generalization: Learning a first language''. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://ebookcentral.proquest.com</nowiki></ref>\n\nFor a person who lacked the capacity to generalize from one experience to the next, every instance of a dog would be completely separated from other instances of dogs, so prior experience would do nothing to help the person know how to interact with this seemingly new stimulus.<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref> In fact, even if the person experienced the very same dog multiple times, he or she would have no way of knowing what to expect and each instance would be as if the individual were encountering a dog for the first time. Therefore, generalization is a valuable and integral part of learning and everyday life.\n\nGeneralization is shown to have implications on the use of the [[spacing effect]] in educational settings.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vlach|first1=Haley A.|title=The Spacing Effect in Children's Generalization of Knowledge: Allowing Children Time to Forget Promotes Their Ability to Learn|journal=Child Development Perspectives|date=September 2014|volume=8|issue=3|pages=163\u2013168|doi=10.1111/cdep.12079}}</ref> In the past, it was thought that the information forgotten between periods of learning when implementing [[spaced presentation]] inhibited generalization. In more recent years, this forgetting has been seen as promoting generalization through repetition of information during each occasion of spaced learning. The effects of gaining [[Long-term memory|long-term]] generalization knowledge through spaced learning can be compared with that of massed learning (lengthy and all at once; for example, cramming the night before an exam)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gluck|first1=Mark A.|last2=Mercado|first2=Eduardo|last3=Myers|first3=Catherine E.|title=Learning and memory : from brain to behavior|date=2014|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9781429240147|page=312|edition=2nd}}</ref> in which a person only gains [[Short-term memory|short-term]] knowledge, decreasing the likelihood of establishing generalization.\n\nGeneralization is also considered to be an important factor in [[procedural memory]], such as the near-automatic memory processes necessary for driving a car.<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref> Without being able to generalize from previous experiences driving, a person would essentially need to relearn how to drive every time he or she encountered a new street.\n\nNot all of generalization\u2019s effects are beneficial, however. An important part of learning is knowing when ''not'' to generalize, which is called discrimination learning. Were it not for discrimination learning, humans and animals would struggle to respond correctly to different situations.<ref>Cherry, K. (2019, November 26). How stimulus generalization influences learning. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-stimulus-generalization-2795885</nowiki></ref> For example, a dog may be trained to come to its owner when it hears a whistle.

When this person is offered a banana to eat, they reject it upon assuming they are also allergic to it through generalizing that all fruits cause the same reaction. Although this generalization about being allergic to all fruit based on experiences with one fruit could be correct in some cases, it may not be correct in all. Both positive and negative effects have been shown in education through learned generalization and its contrasting notion of [[discrimination learning]].\n\n== '''Overview''' ==\nGeneralization is understood to be directly tied to the [[Transfer of learning|transfer]] of [[knowledge]] across multiple situations.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=J.

T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref> Generalization allows humans and animals to recognize the similarities in knowledge acquired in one circumstance, allowing for transfer of knowledge onto new situations. This idea rivals the theory of [[situated cognition]], instead stating that one can apply past knowledge to learning in new situations and environments.\n\nGeneralization can be supported and partly explained by the [[connectionism]] approach.<ref>Goldstein, B. E. (2015). Cognitive psychology: connecting mind research and everyday experience. W. Ross MacDonald School Resource Services Library.</ref> Just as artificial intelligences learn to distinguish between different categories by applying past learning to novel situations, humans and animals generalize previously learned properties and patterns onto new situations, thus ''connecting'' the novel experience to past experiences that are similar in one or more ways. This creates a pattern of connections that allows the learner to classify and make assumptions about the novel stimulus, such as when previous experience with seeing a canary allows the learner to predict what other birds will be like. This categorization is a foundational aspect of generalizing.\n\n== '''Research on Generalization''' ==\nIn scientific studies looking at generalization, a generalization gradient is often used. This tool is used to measure how often and how much animals or humans respond to certain stimuli, depending on whether the stimuli are perceived to be similar or different. The curvilinear shape of the gradient is achieved by placing the perceived similarity of a stimulus on the x-axis and the strength of the response on the y-axis.<ref>Boddez, Y., Bennett, M. P., van Esch, S., & Beckers, T. (2017). Bending rules: the shape of the perceptual generalisation gradient is sensitive to inference rules.

(2019, September 30). Generalization. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.britannica.com/topic/generalization</nowiki></ref>\n\nSeveral studies have suggested that generalization is a fundamental and naturally occurring learning process for humans. 9-month-old infants require very few (sometimes only 3) experiences with a category before learning to generalize. In fact, infants generalize so well during early stages of development (such as learning to recognize specific sounds as language) that it can be hard for them to discriminate between variations of the generalized stimuli at later stages of development (such as failing to distinguish between the subtly different sounds of similar phonemes). One potential explanation for why children are such efficient learners is that they operate in accordance with the goal of making their world more predictable, therefore encouraging them to hold strongly to generalizations that effectively help them to navigate their environment.<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref>\n\nSome evidence suggests that children are born with innate processes for accurately generalizing things. For example, children tend to generalize based on taxonomic rather than thematic similarities (an experience with one ball leads to the child identifying other ball-shaped objects as \u201cball\u201d rather than labeling a bat as \u201cball\u201d because a bat is used to hit a ball).<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref>\n\nWakefield, Hall, James, and Goldin (2018) found that children are more flexible in generalizing new verbs when they are taught the verb by observing gestures as opposed to being taught by performing the action themselves.<ref>Wakefield, E. M., Hall, C., James, K. H., & Goldin, M. S. (2018). Gesture for generalization: gesture facilitates flexible learning of words for actions on objects. Developmental Science, 21(5), 1. https://doi.org/10.1111/desc.12656</ref> When helping a child learn a new word, providing more examples of the word increases the child\u2019s capacity to generalize the word to different contexts and situations.

''Experience, variation and generalization: Learning a first language''. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://ebookcentral.proquest.com</nowiki></ref>\n\nFor a person who lacked the capacity to generalize from one experience to the next, every instance of a dog would be completely separated from other instances of dogs, so prior experience would do nothing to help the person know how to interact with this seemingly new stimulus.<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref> In fact, even if the person experienced the very same dog multiple times, he or she would have no way of knowing what to expect and each instance would be as if the individual were encountering a dog for the first time. Therefore, generalization is a valuable and integral part of learning and everyday life.\n\nGeneralization is shown to have implications on the use of the [[spacing effect]] in educational settings.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vlach|first1=Haley A.|title=The Spacing Effect in Children's Generalization of Knowledge: Allowing Children Time to Forget Promotes Their Ability to Learn|journal=Child Development Perspectives|date=September 2014|volume=8|issue=3|pages=163\u2013168|doi=10.1111/cdep.12079}}</ref> In the past, it was thought that the information forgotten between periods of learning when implementing [[spaced presentation]] inhibited generalization. In more recent years, this forgetting has been seen as promoting generalization through repetition of information during each occasion of spaced learning. The effects of gaining [[Long-term memory|long-term]] generalization knowledge through spaced learning can be compared with that of massed learning (lengthy and all at once; for example, cramming the night before an exam)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gluck|first1=Mark A.|last2=Mercado|first2=Eduardo|last3=Myers|first3=Catherine E.|title=Learning and memory : from brain to behavior|date=2014|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9781429240147|page=312|edition=2nd}}</ref> in which a person only gains [[Short-term memory|short-term]] knowledge, decreasing the likelihood of establishing generalization.\n\nGeneralization is also considered to be an important factor in [[procedural memory]], such as the near-automatic memory processes necessary for driving a car.<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref> Without being able to generalize from previous experiences driving, a person would essentially need to relearn how to drive every time he or she encountered a new street.\n\nNot all of generalization\u2019s effects are beneficial, however. An important part of learning is knowing when ''not'' to generalize, which is called discrimination learning. Were it not for discrimination learning, humans and animals would struggle to respond correctly to different situations.<ref>Cherry, K. (2019, November 26). How stimulus generalization influences learning. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-stimulus-generalization-2795885</nowiki></ref> For example, a dog may be trained to come to its owner when it hears a whistle.

Digital convergence refers to the convergence of four industries into one conglomerate, ITTCE ([[IT industry|Information Technologies]], [[telecommunication industry|Telecommunication]], [[Consumer Electronics]], and  [[Entertainment industry|Entertainment]]). Previously separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications), and video can now share resources and interact with each other synergistically. Telecommunications convergence (also called \"network convergence\") describes emerging [[telecommunications]] technologies, and [[network architecture]] used to migrate multiple communications services into a single network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchnetworkingchannel.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid100_gci1310061,00.html|title=What is network convergence? - Definition from WhatIs.com|work=SearchITChannel|accessdate=17 June 2015}}</ref> Specifically this involves the converging of previously distinct media such as [[telephony]] and [[data communications]] into common interfaces on single devices, such as most smart phones can make phone calls and search the web.\n\n'''Media convergence''' is the interlinking of computing and other information technologies, media content, media companies and communication networks that have arisen as the result of the evolution and popularization of the Internet as well as the activities, products and services that have emerged in the digital media space.

Also included in this topic is the basis of computer networks, wherein many different operating systems are able to communicate via different [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]]. \nConvergent services, such as [[VoIP]], [[IPTV]], [[Smart TV]], and others, tend to replace the older technologies and thus can [[disruptive innovation|disrupt markets]].

These are all thanks to the digitization of content (movies, pictures, music, voice, text) and the development of connections methods. Reading emails on your TV via a connected smartphone, watch a streaming movie on the home theater connected to the Internet. Digital convergence simplifies our life into our living room. Formerly, each unit operated independently and networks were not interconnected. Today, information flows on the same network and are stored, read, viewed or listened via same types of equipment. Networks, technologies and content converge on a single device. Result: it saves time and simplifies life. Some examples of digital convergence are; 1. Windows 10. 2. The iPhone, Android or other smart phone devices. 3. Google Glass 4. iWatch 5. Drawing Tablets for PC's 6. Automatic washing machine.\n\n==Elements of Technology Convergence==\n\nThere are 5 elements of Technological Convergence which are: \n[1] Technology,It is a common for technologies that are viewed as very different to develop similar features with time that blur differences. In 1995, a television and a mobile phone were completely different devices. In recent years, they may have similar features such as the ability to connect to wifi, play rich internet-based media and run apps. People may use either their television or phone to play a game or communicate with relatives, using the same software. [2] Media & Content, a television and internet services were once viewed as separate but have begun to converge. It is likely that music, movies, video games and informational content will eventually converge to the point that they are no longer distinct formats. For example, future music may always come with an interactive music video that resembles a game. \n[3] Services application, in the late 1990s, there was a large difference between business and consumer software and services. With time, this line has blurred. Technology tends to move from a large number of highly specific tools towards a small set of flexible tools with broad applications. \n[4] [[Robot|Robots]] & Machines, it is increasingly common for machines such as [[Vehicle|vehicles]] or appliances to have semi-autonomous features that technically make them robots. \n[5] Virtual Reality, can be viewed as the convergence of real life with digital entities such as games and information environments.\n\n== History of media technological convergence ==\n\nCommunication networks were designed to carry different types of information independently. The older media, such as television and radio, are broadcasting networks with passive audiences. Convergence of telecommunication technology permits the manipulation of all forms of information, voice, data, and video.  Telecommunication has changed from a world of scarcity to one of seemingly limitless capacity.

Fixed and mobile operators were, for most of the 1990s, independent companies. Even when the same organization marketed both products, these were sold and serviced independently.\n\nIn the 1990s an implicit and often explicit assumption was that new media was going to replace the old media and Internet was going to replace broadcasting. In Nicholas Negroponte's ''[[Being Digital]]'', Negroponte predicts the collapse of broadcast networks in favor of an era of narrow-casting. He also suggests that no government regulation can shatter the [[media conglomerate]]. \"The monolithic empires of mass media are dissolving into an array of cottage industries... Media barons of today will be grasping to hold onto their centralized empires tomorrow.... The combined forces of technology and human nature will ultimately take a stronger hand in plurality than any laws Congress can invent.\"<ref>Negroponte, Nicholas. ''Being Digital''. Knopf, 1995. Print.</ref> The new media companies claimed that the old media would be absorbed fully and completely into the orbit of the emerging technologies. [[George Gilder]] dismisses such claims saying,{{clarify|date=April 2015}} \"The computer industry is converging with the television industry in the same sense that the automobile converged with the horse, the TV converged with the nickelodeon, the word-processing program converged with the typewriter, the CAD program converged with the drafting board, and digital desktop publishing converged with the Linotype machine and the letterpress.\" Gilder believes that computers had come not to transform mass culture but to destroy it.\n\nMedia companies put Media Convergence back to their agenda, after the [[dot-com bubble]] burst. Erstwhile Knight Ridder promulgated concept of portable magazines, newspaper, and books in 1994.<ref>{{citation |author=Smith, G. |title=Back to the Future: The Tablet computer that looks just like an iPad... but it is 17 Years Old |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1381528/Knight-Ridder-tablet-looks-just-like-iPad-17-YEARS-OLD.html |publisher=MailOnline |date=28 April 2011 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref>\"Within news corporations it became increasingly obvious that an editorial model based on mere replication in the internet of contents that had previously been written for print newspapers, radio, or television was no longer sufficient.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ram\u00f3n Salaverria, Media Convergence|url = https://online.journalism.utexas.edu/detail.php?story=251&year=2008|website = online.journalism.utexas.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-20|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151120215558/https://online.journalism.utexas.edu/detail.php?story=251&year=2008|archive-date = 2015-11-20|url-status = dead}}</ref> The rise of digital communication in the late 20th century has made it possible for media organizations (or individuals) to deliver text, audio, and video material over the same wired, wireless, or fiber-optic connections. At the same time, it inspired some media organizations to explore multimedia delivery of information. This digital convergence of news media, in particular, was called \"Mediamorphosis\" by researcher Roger Fidler [https://web.archive.org/web/20090315053135/http://rji.missouri.edu/staff-and-advisers/roger-fidler.php], in his 1997 book by that name.

Magazine Issue 071|accessdate=17 June 2015|date=April 1986}}</ref> As such, media business practice has been to identify the next \"black box\" to invest in and provide media for. This has caused a number of problems. Firstly, as \"black boxes\" are invented and abandoned, the individual is left with numerous devices that can perform the same task, rather than one dedicated for each task. For example, one may own both a computer and a video games console, subsequently owning two DVD players. This is contrary to the streamlined goal of the \"black box\" theory, and instead creates clutter.<ref>Jenkins 2006, 15</ref> Secondly, technological convergence tends to be experimental in nature. This has led to consumers owning technologies with additional functions that are harder, if not impractical, to use rather than one specific device. Many people would only watch the TV for the duration of the meal's cooking time, or whilst in the kitchen, but would not use the microwave as the household TV. These examples show that in many cases technological convergence is unnecessary or unneeded.\n\nFurthermore, although consumers primarily use a specialized media device for their needs, other \"black box\" devices that perform the same task can be used to suit their current situation. As a 2002 Cheskin Research report explained: \"...Your email needs and expectations are different whether you're at home, work, school, commuting, the airport, etc., and these different devices are designed to suit your needs for accessing content depending on where you are- your situated context.\" Despite the creation of \"black boxes\", intended to perform all tasks, the trend is to use devices that can suit the consumer's physical position.<ref>Cheskin Research. \"Designing Digital Experiences for Youth\", Market Insights Series, Fall 2002 pp. 8\u20139</ref> Due to the variable utility of portable technology, convergence occurs in high-end mobile devices. They incorporate multimedia services, GPS, Internet access, and mobile telephony into a single device, heralding the rise of what has been termed the \"smartphone,\" a device designed to remove the need to carry multiple devices. Convergence of media occurs when multiple products come together to form one product with the advantages of all of them, also known as the black box. This idea of one technology, concocted by [[Henry Jenkins]], has become known more as a fallacy because of the inability to actually put all technical pieces into one. For example, while people can have e-mail and Internet on their phone, they still want full computers with Internet and e-mail in addition. Mobile phones are a good example, in that they incorporate [[digital camera]]s, mp3 players, [[dictaphone|voice recorder]]s, and other devices. For the consumer, it means more features in less space; for [[media conglomerate]]s it means remaining competitive.\n\nHowever, convergence has a downside. Particularly in initial forms, converged devices are frequently less functional and reliable than their component parts (e.g., a mobile phone's web browser may not render some web pages correctly, due to not supporting certain rendering methods, such as the [[iPhone]] browser not supporting [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] content). As the number of functions in a single device escalates, the ability of that device to serve its original function decreases.<ref>Jenkins, H. 2006. ''Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide'' New York: New York University Press.</ref> As Rheingold asserts, technological convergence holds immense potential for the \"improvement of life and liberty in some ways and (could) degrade it in others\".<ref name=\"Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82\"/> He believes the same technology has the potential to be \"used as both a weapon of social control and a means of resistance\".<ref name=\"Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82\"/> Since technology has evolved in the past ten years or so, companies are beginning to converge technologies to create demand for new products. This includes phone companies integrating [[3G]] and [[4G]] on their phones. In the mid 20th century, television converged the technologies of movies and radio, and television is now being converged with the mobile phone industry and the Internet. Phone calls are also being made with the use of personal computers. Converging technologies combine multiple technologies into one. Newer mobile phones feature cameras, and can hold images, videos, music, and other media. Manufacturers now integrate more advanced features, such as video recording, GPS receivers, data storage, and security mechanisms into the traditional cellphone.\n\n==Convergence on the internet==\nThe role of the [[internet]] has changed from its original use as a communication tool to easier and faster access to information and services, mainly through a [[broadband]] connection. The television, radio and newspapers were the world's media for accessing news and entertainment; now, all three media have converged into one, and people all over the world can read and hear news and other information on the internet. The convergence of the internet and conventional TV became popular in the 2010s, through [[Smart TV]], also sometimes referred to as \"Connected TV\" or \"Hybrid TV\", (not to be confused with [[IPTV]], [[Internet TV]], or with [[Web television|Web TV]]). Smart TV is used to describe the current trend of integration of the Internet and [[Web 2.0]] features into modern [[television set]]s and [[set-top box]]es, as well as the technological convergence between computers and these television sets or set-top boxes. These new [[information appliance|devices]] most often also have a much higher focus on [[online]] [[interactive media]], [[Internet TV]], [[over-the-top content]], as well as [[video on demand|on-demand]] [[streaming media]], and less focus on traditional [[broadcasting|broadcast]] media like previous generations of [[television set]]s and [[set-top box]]es always have had.<ref name=\"businessinsider1\">{{cite web|author=Steve Kovach |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-2010-12 |title=What Is A Smart TV? |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=December 8, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Digital convergence==\nDigital Convergence means inclination for various innovations, media sources, content that become similar with the time. It enables the convergence of access devices and content as well as the industry participant operations and strategy.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Digital Product Management, Technology and Practice: Interdisciplinary Perspectives: Interdisciplinary Perspectives|last=Strader|first=Troy|publisher=Business Science Reference|year=2011|isbn=9781616928773|location=Hershey, PA|pages=113}}</ref> This is how this type of technological convergence creates opportunities, particularly in the area of product development and growth strategies for digital product companies.<ref name=\":0\" /> The same can be said in the case of individual content producers such as vloggers in the [[YouTube]] video-sharing platform. The convergence in this example is demonstrated in the involvement of the Internet, home devices such as smart television, camera, the YouTube application, and the digital content. In this setup, there are the so-called \"spokes\",<ref>{{Cite book|title=Strategies and Policies in Digital Convergence|last=Park|first=Sangin|publisher=Idea Group Reference|year=2007|isbn=978-1599041568|location=Hershey, PA|pages=106}}</ref> which are the devices that connect to a central hub, which could either be the smart TV or PC. Here, the Internet serves as the intermediary, particularly through its interactivity tools and social networking, in order to create unique mixes of products and services via horizontal integration.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe above example highlights how digital convergence encompasses three phenomena:\n\n# previously stand-alone devices are being connected by networks and software, significantly enhancing functionalities;\n# previously stand-alone products are being converged onto the same platform, creating hybrid products in the process; and,\n# companies are crossing traditional boundaries such as hardware and software to provide new products and new sources of competition.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marketing of High-technology Products and Innovations|last=Mohr|first=Jakki|last2=Sengupta|first2=Sanjit|last3=Slater|first3=Stanley|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2010|isbn=9780136049968|location=Upper Saddle, NJ|pages=271}}</ref>\n\nAnother example is the convergence of different types of digital contents. According to Harry Strasser, former CTO of [[Siemens]] \"[digital convergence will substantially impact people's lifestyle and work style]\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/1110194|title=A Computing Studio Method for Teaching Design Thinking|journal=Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University|last=Van der Post|first=L.|date=2010|pages=12\u201349}}</ref>\n\n==Convergence in the marketplace==\nConvergence is a global marketplace dynamic in which different companies and sectors are being brought together, both as competitors and collaborators, across traditional boundaries of industry and technology. In a world dominated by convergence, many traditional products, services and types of companies will become less relevant, but a stunning array of new ones is possible. An array of technology developments act as accelerators of convergence, including mobility, analytics, cloud, digital and social networks. As a disruptive force, convergence is a threat to the unprepared, but a tremendous growth opportunity for companies that can out-innovate and out-execute their ever-expanding list of competitors under dramatically new marketplace rules. With convergence, lines are blurred as companies diversify outside of their original markets. For instance, mobile services are increasingly an important part of the automobile; chemicals companies work with agribusiness; device manufacturers sell music, video and books; booksellers become consumer device companies; search and advertising companies become telecommunications companies (\"telcos\"); media companies act like telcos and vice versa; retailers act like financial services companies and vice versa; cosmetics companies work with pharmaceutical companies; and more. Mobile phone usage broadens dramatically, enabling users to make payments online, watch videos, or even adjusting their home thermostat while away at work.\n\n==Media convergence{{anchor|Media}}==\nGenerally, media convergence refers to the merging of both old and new media and can be seen as a product, a system or a process. Jenkins states that convergence is, \"the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behaviour of media audiences who would go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they wanted\"<ref>Jenkins (2006) Convergence Culture : Where Old and New Media Collide, pg 2</ref> According to Jenkins, there are five areas of convergence: technological, economic, social or organic, cultural and global.<ref>The Handbook of global online journalism, edited by Eugenia Siapera and  Andreas Vilglis, pg 26</ref> So media convergence is not just a technological shift or a technological process, it also includes shifts within the industrial, cultural, and social paradigms that encourage the consumer to seek out new information. Convergence, simply put, is how individual consumers interact with others on a social level and use various media platforms to create new experiences, new forms of media and content that connect us socially, and not just to other consumers, but to the corporate producers of media in ways that have not been as readily accessible in the past. However, Lugmayr and Dal Zotto argued, that media convergence takes place on technology, content, consumer, business model, and management level.<ref>Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 1, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783662482926</ref><ref>Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 2, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783662482926</ref> They argue, that media convergence is a matter of evolution and can be described through the triadic phenomenon of convergence, divergence, and coexistence. Today's digital media ecosystems coexist, as e.g. mobile app stores provide vendor lock-ins into particular eco-systems; some technology platforms are converging under one technology, due to e.g. the usage of common communication protocols as in digital TV; and other media are diverging, as e.g. media content offerings are more and more specializing and provides a space for niche media.<ref>Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence is NOT King: The Triadic Phenomenon of Media 'Convergence-Divergence-Coexistance' is King. Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 1, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302467971_Media_Convergence_is_NOT_King_The_Triadic_Phenomenon_of_Media_Convergence-Divergence-Coexistence_IS_King</ref>\n\nAdvances in technology bring the ability for technological convergence that Rheingold believes can alter the \"social-side effects,\" in that \"the virtual, social and physical world are colliding, merging and coordinating.\"<ref name=\"Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82\">Rheingold, Howard (2000) Smart Mobs: the next social revolution, Perseus, Cambridge, Massachusetts, pp 157\u201382</ref> It was predicted in the late 1980s,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1988-02-compute-magazine|title=COMPUTE! magazine issue 93 Feb 1988|quote=If the wheels behind the CD-ROM industry have their way, this product will help open the door to a brave, new multimedia world for  microcomputers, where the computer is intimately linked with the other household electronics, and every gadget in the house reads  tons of video, audio, and text data from CD-ROM disks. |date=February 1988}}</ref> around the time that [[CD-ROM]] was becoming commonplace, that a [[digital revolution]] would take place, and that old media would be pushed to one side by [[new media]]. Broadcasting is increasingly being replaced by the Internet, enabling consumers all over the world the freedom to access their preferred media content more easily and at a more available rate than ever before.\n\nHowever, when the [[dot-com bubble]] of the 1990s suddenly popped, that poured cold water over the talk of such a digital revolution.<ref>Jenkins, H. (2008) Convergence Culture : Where Old and New Media Collide, 2nd ed., p.6</ref> In today's society, the idea of media convergence has once again emerged as a key point of reference as newer as well as established media companies attempt to visualize the future of the entertainment industry. If this revolutionary digital paradigm shift presumed that old media would be increasingly replaced by new media, the convergence paradigm that is currently emerging suggests that new and old media would interact in more complex ways than previously predicted. The paradigm shift that followed the digital revolution assumed that new media was going to change everything. When the dot com market crashed, there was a tendency to imagine that nothing had changed. The real truth lay somewhere in between as there were so many aspects of the current media environment to take into consideration. Many industry leaders are increasingly reverting to media convergence as a way of making sense in an era of disorientating change. In that respect, media convergence in theory is essentially an old concept taking on a new meaning. Media convergence, in reality, is more than just a shift in technology. It alters relationships between industries, technologies, audiences, genres and markets. Media convergence changes the rationality media industries operate in, and the way that media consumers process news and entertainment. Media convergence is essentially a process and not an outcome, so no single black box controls the flow of media. With proliferation of different media channels and increasing portability of new telecommunications and computing technologies, we have entered into an era where media constantly surrounds us.<ref>{{cite web|last=Steiner | first=Tobias | title=Under the Macroscope: Convergence in the US Television Market between 2000 and 2014 | url=https://www.academia.edu/2017902 | work=academia.edu|accessdate=4 Aug 2015}}</ref>\n\nMedia convergence requires that media companies rethink existing assumptions about media from the consumer's point of view, as these affect marketing and programming decisions. Media producers must respond to newly empowered consumers.\nConversely, it would seem that hardware is instead diverging whilst media content is converging. Media has developed into brands that can offer content in a number of forms. Two examples of this are ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[The Matrix]]''. Both are films, but are also books, video games, cartoons, and action figures. Branding encourages expansion of one concept, rather than the creation of new ideas.<ref>Jenkins 2006, p.101-112</ref> In contrast, hardware has diversified to accommodate media convergence. Hardware must be specific to each function. While most scholars argue that the flow of cross-media is accelerating,<ref>Jenkins H, Deuze M (2008) Editorial: Convergence culture. Convergence 14(1): 5\u00a1V12.</ref> O'Donnell suggests, especially between films and video game, the semblance of media convergence is misunderstood by people outside of the media production industry. The conglomeration of media industry continues to sell the same story line in different media. For example, Batman is  in comics, films, anime, and games. However, the data to create the image of batman in each media is created individually by different teams of creators. The same character and the same visual effect repetitively appear in different media is because of the synergy of media industry to make them similar as possible.  In addition, convergence does not happen when the game of two different consoles is produced. No flows between two consoles because it is faster to create game from scratch for the industry.<ref>O'Donnell, Casey. \"Games Are Not Convergence: The Lost Promise Of Digital Production And Convergence.\" Convergence: The Journal of Research Into New Media Technologies 17.3 (2011): 271\u2013286.

Reuters, a major international news service, has created and staffed a news \u201cisland\u201d in the popular online virtual reality environment Second Life (www.secondlife.com, accessed January 3, 2008). Open to anyone, Second Life has emerged as a compelling 3D virtual reality for millions of citizens around the world who have created avatars (virtual representations of themselves) to populate and live in an altered state where personal flight is a reality, altered egos can flourish, and real money (US$1,296,257 were spent during the 24 hours concluding at 10:19&nbsp;a.m. eastern time January 7, 2008) can be made without ever setting foot into the real world. The Reuters Island in Second Life is a virtual version of the Reuters real-world news service but covering the domain of Second Life for the citizens of Second Life (numbering 11,807,742 residents as of January 5, 2008).<ref>Pavlic J.

Media convergence has two roles, the first is the technological merging of different media channels \u2013 for example, magazines, radio programs, TV shows, and movies, now are available on the Internet through laptops, iPads, and smartphones. As discussed in ''Media Culture'' (by Campbell), convergence of technology is not new. It has been going on since the late 1920s.  An example is RCA, the Radio Corporation of America, which purchased Victor Talking Machine Company and introduced machines that could receive radio and play recorded music.  Next came the TV, and radio lost some of its appeal as people started watching television, which has both talking and music as well as visuals.  As technology advances, convergence of media change to keep up. The second definition of media convergence Campbell discusses is cross-platform by media companies. This usually involves consolidating various media holdings, such as cable, phone, television (over the air, satellite, cable) and Internet access under one corporate umbrella. This is not for the consumer to have more media choices, this is for the benefit of the company to cut down on costs and maximize its profits.<ref name=Campbell>Campbell, Richard, Christopher R.

The convergence culture is an important factor in [[transmedia storytelling]].  Convergence culture introduces new stories and arguments from one form of media into many.

It becomes a story not only told in the movies but in [[The Animatrix|animated shorts]], video games and comic books, three different media platforms. Online, a wiki is created to keep track of the story's expanding canon. Fan films, discussion forums, and social media pages also form, expanding The Matrix to different online platforms.

Because average people can now access their interests on many types of media they can also have more of a say. Fans and consumers are able to participate in the creation and circulation of new content. Some companies take advantage of this and search for feedback from their customers through social media and sharing sites such as [[YouTube]]. \nBesides marketing and entertainment, convergence culture has also affected the way we interact with news and information. We can access news on multiple levels of media from the radio, TV, newspapers, and the internet. The internet allows more people to be able to report the news through independent broadcasts and therefore allows a multitude of perspectives to be put forward and accessed by people in many different areas. Convergence allows news to be gathered on a much larger scale. For instance, photographs were taken of torture at [[Abu Ghraib]]. These photos were shared and eventually posted on the internet. This led to the breaking of a news story in newspapers, on TV, and the internet.<ref name=\"Jenkens 2009\"/>\n\nMedia scholar Henry Jenkins has described the media convergence with [[participatory culture]] as:\n\n{{quote|...a \"catalyst\" for amateur digital film-making and what this case study suggests about the future directions popular culture may take. Star Wars fan films represent the intersection of two significant cultural trends\u2014the corporate movement towards media convergence and the unleashing of significant new tools, which enable the grassroots archiving, annotation, appropriation, and recirculation of media content. These fan films build on long-standing practices of the fan community but they also reflect the influence of this changed technological environment that has dramatically lowered the costs of film production and distribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/cms/People/henry3/starwars.html|title=MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing|accessdate=17 June 2015}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Cell phone convergence ===\n[[File:Librem5 phone convergence - screen keyboard mouse.jpg|thumb|Mobile/desktop convergence: the [[Librem 5]] mobile, when connected to a keyboard, screen, and mouse, runs as a desktop computer.]]\nThe social function of the cell phone changes as the technology converges. Because of technological advancement, cell phones function as more than just as a phone. They contain an internet connection, video players, MP3 players, gaming, and a camera.

Because of the [[Net neutrality|neutrality of the internet]] and the [[End-to-end principle|end-to-end design]], the power structure of the internet was designed to avoid discrimination between applications. Mexico's [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] campaign for land rights was one of the most influential case in the information age; Manuel Castells defines the Zapatistas as \"the first informational guerrilla movement\".<ref>Castells, 2004:82</ref> The Zapatista uprising had been marginalized by the popular press. The Zapatistas were able to construct a grassroots, decentralized social movement by using the internet. The Zapatistas Effect, observed by Cleaver,<ref>Cleaver, 1998</ref> continues to organize social movements on a global scale. A sophisticated webmetric analysis, which maps the links between different websites and seeks to identify important nodal points in a network, demonstrates that the Zapatistas cause binds together hundreds of global NGOs.<ref>Garrido and Halavais, 2003:181</ref> The majority of the social movement organized by Zapatistas targets their campaign especially against global neoliberalism.<ref>Cleaver, 1988:630</ref> A successful social movement not only need online support but also protest on the street.

In addition to its growth, FCC is tentative to set regulation on VoIP in order to promote competition in the telecommunication industry.<ref>Written in 2011, 10, 27</ref> There is not a clear line between telecommunication service and the information service because of the growth of the new convergent media. Historically, telecommunication is subject to state regulation. The state of California concerned about the increasing popularity of internet telephony will eventually obliterate funding for the [[Universal Service Fund]]<ref>Kopytoff, V. (2005). Internet Phones in Spotlight, Companies face more scrutiny by U.S., state agencies. IP Telephony News, March, 2005.</ref> Some states attempt to assert their traditional role of common carrier oversight onto this new technology.<ref>Cutler, J (2004).

''Electronic Commerce and Law Report'' (Vol. 9, No.7) 156-57</ref> Meisel and Needles (2005) suggests that the FCC, federal courts, and state regulatory bodies on access line charges will directly impact the speed in which Internet telephony market grows.<ref>Meisel, J., Needles, M. Voice over Internet protocol development and public policy Implications. INFO: ''the journal of policy, regulation and strategy for telecommunications, information and media,'' Vol.7, Number 3, 2005.</ref> On one hand, the FCC is hesitant to regulate convergent technology because VoIP with different feature from the old Telecommunication; no fixed model to build legislature yet. On the other hand, the regulations is needed because Service over the internet might be quickly replaced telecommunication service, which will affect the entire economy.\n\nConvergence has also raised several debates about classification of certain telecommunications services. As the lines between data transmission, and voice and media transmission are eroded, regulators are faced with the task of how best to classify the converging segments of the telecommunication sector. Traditionally, telecommunication regulation has focused on the operation of physical infrastructure, networks, and access to network. No content is regulated in the telecommunication because the content is considered private. In contrast, film and Television are regulated by contents. The rating system regulates its distribution to the audience. Self-regulation is promoted by the industry. Bogle senior persuaded the entire industry to pay 0.1 percent levy on all advertising and the money was used to give authority to the Advertising Standards Authority, which keeps the government away from setting legislature in the media industry.<ref>PERSPECTIVE: Media convergence puts self-regulation at top of the agenda.\" Campaign 1 Nov. 2002: 02. General Reference Center GOLD. Web. 13 Oct. 2011</ref>\n\nThe premises to regulate the new media, two-ways communications, concerns much about the change from old media to new media. Each medium has different features and characteristics. First, internet, the new medium, manipulates all form of information \u2013 voice, data and video. Second, the old regulation on the old media, such as radio and Television, emphasized its regulation on the scarcity of the channels. Internet, on the other hand, has the limitless capacity, due to the end-to-end design. Third, Two-ways communication encourages interactivity between the content producers and the audiences. \n\"...Fundamental basis for classification, therefore, is to consider the need for regulation in terms of either market failure or in the public interests\"(Blackman).<ref>\nBlackman, Colin.

Wu and Lessig (2004) set out two reasons to adapt neutral network model for computer networks. First, \"a neutral network eliminates the risk of future discrimination, providing more incentive to invest in broadband application development.\" Second, \"neutral network facilitates fair competition among application, no bias between applications.\"<ref>Wu, T., Lessig, L. EX Parte Submission in CS Docket No. 02-52. August, 2004.</ref> The two reasons also coincide with FCC's interest to stimulate investment and enhance innovation in broadband technology and services.<ref>FCC, 2004d</ref><ref>FCC (2004d). Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, March 11, 2004</ref>\nDespite regulatory efforts of deregulation, privatization, and liberalization, the  infrastructure barrier has been a negative factor in achieving effective competition. \"Kim et al. argues that IP dissociates the telephony application from the infrastructure and Internet telephony is at the forefront of such dissociation.\"<ref>Kim, et al.

Proceedings of 15th Portland International Conference on Technology Management.</ref>  The neutrality of the network is very important for fair competition.<ref>Wu, T. (2004). Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination, Journal of Telecommunications & High Technology Law, Vol. 2.</ref> As the former FCC Charman [[Michael Powell]] put it: \"From its inception, the Internet was designed, as those present during the course of its creating will tell you, to prevent government or a corporation or anyone else from controlling it. It was designed to defeat [[discrimination]] against users, ideas and technologies\".<ref>FCC (2004f). Remarks of Michael J. Copps: Federal Communications Commissioner: The Beginning Of The End Of The Internet? Discrimination, Closed Networks, And The Future of Cyberspace New America Foundation, Washington, Dc. October 9, 2003.</ref> Because of these reasons, Shin concludes that regulator should make sure to regulate application and infrastructure separately.\n\nThe layered model was first proposed by Solum and Chug, Sicker, and Nakahata. Sicker, Warbach and Witt have supported using a layered model to regulate the telecommunications industry with the emergence of convergence services. Many researchers have different layered approach, but they all agree that the emergence of convergent technology will create challenges and ambiguities for regulations.<ref name = \"Shin\"/> The key point of the layered model is that it reflects the reality of network architecture, and current business model.<ref name = \"Whitt\">Whitt, R.S. (2004). A Horizontal Leap Forward: Formulating a New Communications\nPublic Policy Framework Based on the Network Layers Mode. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS\nLAW JOURNAL, Vol. 56, Number 3, 2004.</ref>\nThe layered Model consists of 1. Access Layer \u2013 where the physical infrastructure resides: copper wires, cable, or fiber optic. 2. transport layer \u2013 the provider of service. 3. Application layer \u2013  the interface between the data and the users. 4. content layer \u2013 the layer which users see.<ref name = \"Whitt\"/> In ''Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications'', Shin combines the Layered Model and Network Neutrality as the principle to regulate the future convergent Media Industry.<ref>Shin, D. , Kim, W. and Lee, D. , 2006-06-16 \"Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications\" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, Dresden International Congress Centre, Dresden, Germany Online <PDF>. 2011-03-14 from http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p91470_index.html</ref>\n\n==Example: Messaging==\nCombination services include those that integrate SMS with voice, such as voice SMS. Providers include Bubble Motion, Jott, Kirusa, and SpinVox. Several operators have launched services that combine SMS with mobile instant messaging (MIM) and presence. Text-to-landline services also exist, where subscribers can send text messages to any landline phone and are charged at standard rates. The text messages are converted into spoken language. This service has been popular in America, where fixed and mobile numbers are similar. Inbound SMS has been converging to enable reception of different formats (SMS, voice, MMS, etc.). In April 2008, O2 UK launched voice-enabled shortcodes, adding voice functionality to the five-digit codes already used for SMS. This type of convergence is helpful for media companies, broadcasters, enterprises, call centres and help desks who need to develop a consistent contact strategy with the consumer. Because SMS is very popular today, it became relevant to include [[text messaging]] as a contact possibility for consumers. To avoid having multiple numbers (one for voice calls, another one for SMS), a simple way is to merge the reception of both formats under one number. This means that a consumer can text or call one number and be sure that the message will be received.\n\n==Example: Mobile==\n\"Mobile service provisions\" refers not only to the ability to purchase mobile phone services, but the ability to wirelessly access everything: voice, Internet, audio, and video. Advancements in [[WiMAX]] and other leading edge technologies provide the ability to transfer information over a wireless link at a variety of speeds, distances, and non-line-of-sight conditions.\n\n==Example: Multi-play in telecommunications==\nMulti-play is a marketing term describing the provision of different telecommunication services, such as [[Internet access]], television, telephone, and mobile phone service, by organisations that traditionally only offered one or two of these services. Multi-play is a catch-all phrase; usually, the terms [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] (voice, video and data) or quadruple play (voice, video, data and wireless) are used to describe a more specific meaning. A dual play service is a marketing term for the provisioning of the two services: it can be high-speed Internet ([[digital subscriber line]]) and telephone service over a single broadband connection in the case of phone companies, or high-speed Internet ([[cable modem]]) and TV service over a single broadband connection in the case of cable TV companies. The convergence can also concern the underlying communication [[infrastructure]]. An example of this is a [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] service, where communication services are packaged allowing consumers to purchase TV, Internet, and [[telephony]] in one subscription. The broadband cable market is transforming as pay-TV providers move aggressively into what was once considered the telco space. Meanwhile, customer expectations have risen as consumer and business customers alike seek rich content, multi-use devices, networked products and converged services including on-demand video, digital TV, high speed Internet, VoIP, and wireless applications. It is uncharted territory for most broadband companies.\n\nA quadruple play service combines the [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] service of broadband Internet access, television, and telephone with [[wireless]] service provisions.<ref>[http://www.d2tech.com/4-news/2007/07-10-29a.htm Integrated Design for VoIP-Enabled Quadruple Play Devices] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226070457/http://www.d2tech.com/4-news/2007/07-10-29a.htm |date=2007-12-26 }}</ref> This service set is also sometimes humorously referred to as \"The [[Fantastic Four]]\" or \"Grand Slam\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cedmagazine.com/cable-consortium-mobilizes-quad-play.aspx|title=Cable consortium mobilizes quad-play with Sprint|work=CED|accessdate=17 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927040031/http://www.cedmagazine.com/cable-consortium-mobilizes-quad-play.aspx|archivedate=27 September 2011}}</ref> A fundamental aspect of the quadruple play is not only the long-awaited broadband convergence but also the players involved. Many of them, from the largest global service providers to whom we connect today via wires and cables to the smallest of startup service providers are interested. Opportunities are attractive: the big three telecom services \u2013 [[telephony]], cable television, and [[wireless]]\u2014could combine their industries. In the UK, the merger of [[Virgin Media|NTL:Telewest]] and [[Virgin Mobile]] resulted in a company offering a quadruple play of cable television, broadband Internet, home telephone, and mobile telephone services.\n\n==Example: Home network==\nEarly in the 21st century, home LAN convergence so rapidly integrated home [[Router (computing)|router]]s, [[wireless access point]]s, and [[DSL modem]]s that users were hard put to identify the resulting box they used to connect their computers to their Internet service. A general term for such a combined device is a [[residential gateway]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Computer multitasking]] (the software equivalent of a converged device)\n* [[Convergence (telecommunications)]]\n* [[Dongle]], can facilitate inclusion of non-converged devices.\n* [[eRhetoric|Digital rhetoric]]\n* [[Generic Access Network]]\n** [[UMA Today]]\n* [[IP Multimedia Subsystem]] (IMS)\n* [[Mobile VoIP]]\n* [[Next Generation Networks]]\n** [[Next generation network services]]\n* [[Post-convergent]]\n* [[Second screen]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Jenkins, H.

Digital convergence refers to the convergence of four industries into one conglomerate, ITTCE ([[IT industry|Information Technologies]], [[telecommunication industry|Telecommunication]], [[Consumer Electronics]], and  [[Entertainment industry|Entertainment]]). Previously separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications), and video can now share resources and interact with each other synergistically. Telecommunications convergence (also called \"network convergence\") describes emerging [[telecommunications]] technologies, and [[network architecture]] used to migrate multiple communications services into a single network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchnetworkingchannel.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid100_gci1310061,00.html|title=What is network convergence? - Definition from WhatIs.com|work=SearchITChannel|accessdate=17 June 2015}}</ref> Specifically this involves the converging of previously distinct media such as [[telephony]] and [[data communications]] into common interfaces on single devices, such as most smart phones can make phone calls and search the web.\n\n'''Media convergence''' is the interlinking of computing and other information technologies, media content, media companies and communication networks that have arisen as the result of the evolution and popularization of the Internet as well as the activities, products and services that have emerged in the digital media space. Closely linked to the multilevel process of media convergence are also several developments in different areas of the media and communication sector which are also summarized under the term of [[media deconvergence]].

Formerly, each unit operated independently and networks were not interconnected. Today, information flows on the same network and are stored, read, viewed or listened via same types of equipment. Networks, technologies and content converge on a single device. Result: it saves time and simplifies life. Some examples of digital convergence are; 1. Windows 10. 2. The iPhone, Android or other smart phone devices. 3. Google Glass 4. iWatch 5. Drawing Tablets for PC\u2019s 6. Automatic washing machine.\n\n==Elements of Technology Convergence==\n\nThere are 5 elements of Technological Convergence which are: \n[1] Technology,It is a common for technologies that are viewed as very different to develop similar features with time that blur differences. In 1995, a television and a mobile phone were completely different devices. In recent years, they may have similar features such as the ability to connect to wifi, play rich internet-based media and run apps. People may use either their television or phone to play a game or communicate with relatives, using the same software. [2] Media & Content, a television and internet services were once viewed as separate but have begun to converge. It is likely that music, movies, video games and informational content will eventually converge to the point that they are no longer distinct formats. For example, future music may always come with an interactive music video that resembles a game. \n[3] Services application, in the late 1990s, there was a large difference between business and consumer software and services. With time, this line has blurred. Technology tends to move from a large number of highly specific tools towards a small set of flexible tools with broad applications. \n[4] [[Robot|Robots]] & Machines, it is increasingly common for machines such as [[Vehicle|vehicles]] or appliances to have semi-autonomous features that technically make them robots. \n[5] Virtual Reality, can be viewed as the convergence of real life with digital entities such as games and information environments.\n\n== History of media technological convergence ==\n\nCommunication networks were designed to carry different types of information independently. The older media, such as television and radio, are broadcasting networks with passive audiences. Convergence of telecommunication technology permits the manipulation of all forms of information, voice, data, and video.  Telecommunication has changed from a world of scarcity to one of seemingly limitless capacity. Consequently, the possibility of audience interactivity morphs the passive audience into an engaged audience.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Blackman|first=Colin|journal=Telecommunication Policy|title=Convergence between telecommunications and other media|year=1998|volume=22|issue=Elsevier Science Ltd|pages=163\u2013170|doi=10.1016/s0308-5961(98)00003-2}}</ref> The historical roots of convergence can be traced back to the emergence of [[mobile telephony]] and the [[Internet]], although the term properly applies only from the point in marketing history when fixed and mobile telephony began to be offered by operators as joined products. Fixed and mobile operators were, for most of the 1990s, independent companies. Even when the same organization marketed both products, these were sold and serviced independently.\n\nIn the 1990s an implicit and often explicit assumption was that new media was going to replace the old media and Internet was going to replace broadcasting. In Nicholas Negroponte's ''[[Being Digital]]'', Negroponte predicts the collapse of broadcast networks in favor of an era of narrow-casting. He also suggests that no government regulation can shatter the [[media conglomerate]]. \"The monolithic empires of mass media are dissolving into an array of cottage industries... Media barons of today will be grasping to hold onto their centralized empires tomorrow.... The combined forces of technology and human nature will ultimately take a stronger hand in plurality than any laws Congress can invent.\"<ref>Negroponte, Nicholas. ''Being Digital''. Knopf, 1995. Print.</ref> The new media companies claimed that the old media would be absorbed fully and completely into the orbit of the emerging technologies. [[George Gilder]] dismisses such claims saying,{{clarify|date=April 2015}} \"The computer industry is converging with the television industry in the same sense that the automobile converged with the horse, the TV converged with the nickelodeon, the word-processing program converged with the typewriter, the CAD program converged with the drafting board, and digital desktop publishing converged with the Linotype machine and the letterpress.\" Gilder believes that computers had come not to transform mass culture but to destroy it.\n\nMedia companies put Media Convergence back to their agenda, after the [[dot-com bubble]] burst. Erstwhile Knight Ridder promulgated concept of portable magazines, newspaper, and books in 1994.<ref>{{citation |author=Smith, G. |title=Back to the Future: The Tablet computer that looks just like an iPad... but it is 17 Years Old |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1381528/Knight-Ridder-tablet-looks-just-like-iPad-17-YEARS-OLD.html |publisher=MailOnline |date=28 April 2011 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref>\"Within news corporations it became increasingly obvious that an editorial model based on mere replication in the internet of contents that had previously been written for print newspapers, radio, or television was no longer sufficient.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ram\u00f3n Salaverria, Media Convergence|url = https://online.journalism.utexas.edu/detail.php?story=251&year=2008|website = online.journalism.utexas.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-20|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151120215558/https://online.journalism.utexas.edu/detail.php?story=251&year=2008|archive-date = 2015-11-20|url-status = dead}}</ref> The rise of digital communication in the late 20th century has made it possible for media organizations (or individuals) to deliver text, audio, and video material over the same wired, wireless, or fiber-optic connections. At the same time, it inspired some media organizations to explore multimedia delivery of information. This digital convergence of news media, in particular, was called \"Mediamorphosis\" by researcher Roger Fidler [https://web.archive.org/web/20090315053135/http://rji.missouri.edu/staff-and-advisers/roger-fidler.php], in his 1997 book by that name.

Magazine Issue 071|accessdate=17 June 2015|date=April 1986}}</ref> As such, media business practice has been to identify the next \"black box\" to invest in and provide media for. This has caused a number of problems. Firstly, as \"black boxes\" are invented and abandoned, the individual is left with numerous devices that can perform the same task, rather than one dedicated for each task. For example, one may own both a computer and a video games console, subsequently owning two DVD players. This is contrary to the streamlined goal of the \"black box\" theory, and instead creates clutter.<ref>Jenkins 2006, 15</ref> Secondly, technological convergence tends to be experimental in nature. This has led to consumers owning technologies with additional functions that are harder, if not impractical, to use rather than one specific device. Many people would only watch the TV for the duration of the meal's cooking time, or whilst in the kitchen, but would not use the microwave as the household TV. These examples show that in many cases technological convergence is unnecessary or unneeded.\n\nFurthermore, although consumers primarily use a specialized media device for their needs, other \"black box\" devices that perform the same task can be used to suit their current situation. As a 2002 Cheskin Research report explained: \"...Your email needs and expectations are different whether you're at home, work, school, commuting, the airport, etc., and these different devices are designed to suit your needs for accessing content depending on where you are- your situated context.\" Despite the creation of \"black boxes\", intended to perform all tasks, the trend is to use devices that can suit the consumer's physical position.<ref>Cheskin Research. \"Designing Digital Experiences for Youth\", Market Insights Series, Fall 2002 pp. 8\u20139</ref> Due to the variable utility of portable technology, convergence occurs in high-end mobile devices. They incorporate multimedia services, GPS, Internet access, and mobile telephony into a single device, heralding the rise of what has been termed the \"smartphone,\" a device designed to remove the need to carry multiple devices. Convergence of media occurs when multiple products come together to form one product with the advantages of all of them, also known as the black box. This idea of one technology, concocted by [[Henry Jenkins]], has become known more as a fallacy because of the inability to actually put all technical pieces into one. For example, while people can have e-mail and Internet on their phone, they still want full computers with Internet and e-mail in addition. Mobile phones are a good example, in that they incorporate [[digital camera]]s, mp3 players, [[dictaphone|voice recorder]]s, and other devices. For the consumer, it means more features in less space; for [[media conglomerate]]s it means remaining competitive.\n\nHowever, convergence has a downside. Particularly in initial forms, converged devices are frequently less functional and reliable than their component parts (e.g., a mobile phone's web browser may not render some web pages correctly, due to not supporting certain rendering methods, such as the [[iPhone]] browser not supporting [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] content). As the number of functions in a single device escalates, the ability of that device to serve its original function decreases.<ref>Jenkins, H. 2006. ''Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide'' New York: New York University Press.</ref> As Rheingold asserts, technological convergence holds immense potential for the \"improvement of life and liberty in some ways and (could) degrade it in others\".<ref name=\"Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82\"/> He believes the same technology has the potential to be \"used as both a weapon of social control and a means of resistance\".<ref name=\"Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82\"/> Since technology has evolved in the past ten years or so, companies are beginning to converge technologies to create demand for new products. This includes phone companies integrating [[3G]] and [[4G]] on their phones. In the mid 20th century, television converged the technologies of movies and radio, and television is now being converged with the mobile phone industry and the Internet. Phone calls are also being made with the use of personal computers. Converging technologies combine multiple technologies into one. Newer mobile phones feature cameras, and can hold images, videos, music, and other media. Manufacturers now integrate more advanced features, such as video recording, GPS receivers, data storage, and security mechanisms into the traditional cellphone.\n\n==Convergence on the internet==\nThe role of the [[internet]] has changed from its original use as a communication tool to easier and faster access to information and services, mainly through a [[broadband]] connection. The television, radio and newspapers were the world's media for accessing news and entertainment; now, all three media have converged into one, and people all over the world can read and hear news and other information on the internet. The convergence of the internet and conventional TV became popular in the 2010s, through [[Smart TV]], also sometimes referred to as \"Connected TV\" or \"Hybrid TV\", (not to be confused with [[IPTV]], [[Internet TV]], or with [[Web television|Web TV]]). Smart TV is used to describe the current trend of integration of the Internet and [[Web 2.0]] features into modern [[television set]]s and [[set-top box]]es, as well as the technological convergence between computers and these television sets or set-top boxes. These new [[information appliance|devices]] most often also have a much higher focus on [[online]] [[interactive media]], [[Internet TV]], [[over-the-top content]], as well as [[video on demand|on-demand]] [[streaming media]], and less focus on traditional [[broadcasting|broadcast]] media like previous generations of [[television set]]s and [[set-top box]]es always have had.<ref name=\"businessinsider1\">{{cite web|author=Steve Kovach |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-2010-12 |title=What Is A Smart TV? |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=December 8, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Digital convergence==\nDigital Convergence means inclination for various innovations, media sources, content that become similar with the time. It enables the convergence of access devices and content as well as the industry participant operations and strategy.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Digital Product Management, Technology and Practice: Interdisciplinary Perspectives: Interdisciplinary Perspectives|last=Strader|first=Troy|publisher=Business Science Reference|year=2011|isbn=9781616928773|location=Hershey, PA|pages=113}}</ref> This is how this type of technological convergence creates opportunities, particularly in the area of product development and growth strategies for digital product companies.<ref name=\":0\" /> The same can be said in the case of individual content producers such as vloggers in the [[YouTube]] video-sharing platform. The convergence in this example is demonstrated in the involvement of the Internet, home devices such as smart television, camera, the YouTube application, and the digital content. In this setup, there are the so-called \"spokes\",<ref>{{Cite book|title=Strategies and Policies in Digital Convergence|last=Park|first=Sangin|publisher=Idea Group Reference|year=2007|isbn=978-1599041568|location=Hershey, PA|pages=106}}</ref> which are the devices that connect to a central hub, which could either be the smart TV or PC. Here, the Internet serves as the intermediary, particularly through its interactivity tools and social networking, in order to create unique mixes of products and services via horizontal integration.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe above example highlights how digital convergence encompasses three phenomena:\n\n# previously stand-alone devices are being connected by networks and software, significantly enhancing functionalities;\n# previously stand-alone products are being converged onto the same platform, creating hybrid products in the process; and,\n# companies are crossing traditional boundaries such as hardware and software to provide new products and new sources of competition.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marketing of High-technology Products and Innovations|last=Mohr|first=Jakki|last2=Sengupta|first2=Sanjit|last3=Slater|first3=Stanley|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2010|isbn=9780136049968|location=Upper Saddle, NJ|pages=271}}</ref>\n\nAnother example is the convergence of different types of digital contents. According to Harry Strasser, former CTO of [[Siemens]] \"[digital convergence will substantially impact people's lifestyle and work style]\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/1110194|title=A Computing Studio Method for Teaching Design Thinking|journal=Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University|last=Van der Post|first=L.|date=2010|pages=12\u201349}}</ref>\n\n==Convergence in the marketplace==\nConvergence is a global marketplace dynamic in which different companies and sectors are being brought together, both as competitors and collaborators, across traditional boundaries of industry and technology. In a world dominated by convergence, many traditional products, services and types of companies will become less relevant, but a stunning array of new ones is possible. An array of technology developments act as accelerators of convergence, including mobility, analytics, cloud, digital and social networks. As a disruptive force, convergence is a threat to the unprepared, but a tremendous growth opportunity for companies that can out-innovate and out-execute their ever-expanding list of competitors under dramatically new marketplace rules. With convergence, lines are blurred as companies diversify outside of their original markets. For instance, mobile services are increasingly an important part of the automobile; chemicals companies work with agribusiness; device manufacturers sell music, video and books; booksellers become consumer device companies; search and advertising companies become telecommunications companies (\"telcos\"); media companies act like telcos and vice versa; retailers act like financial services companies and vice versa; cosmetics companies work with pharmaceutical companies; and more. Mobile phone usage broadens dramatically, enabling users to make payments online, watch videos, or even adjusting their home thermostat while away at work.\n\n==Media convergence{{anchor|Media}}==\nGenerally, media convergence refers to the merging of both old and new media and can be seen as a product, a system or a process. Jenkins states that convergence is, \"the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behaviour of media audiences who would go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they wanted\"<ref>Jenkins (2006) Convergence Culture : Where Old and New Media Collide, pg 2</ref> According to Jenkins, there are five areas of convergence: technological, economic, social or organic, cultural and global.<ref>The Handbook of global online journalism, edited by Eugenia Siapera and  Andreas Vilglis, pg 26</ref> So media convergence is not just a technological shift or a technological process, it also includes shifts within the industrial, cultural, and social paradigms that encourage the consumer to seek out new information. Convergence, simply put, is how individual consumers interact with others on a social level and use various media platforms to create new experiences, new forms of media and content that connect us socially, and not just to other consumers, but to the corporate producers of media in ways that have not been as readily accessible in the past. However, Lugmayr and Dal Zotto argued, that media convergence takes place on technology, content, consumer, business model, and management level.<ref>Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 1, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783662482926</ref><ref>Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 2, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783662482926</ref> They argue, that media convergence is a matter of evolution and can be described through the triadic phenomenon of convergence, divergence, and coexistence. Today's digital media ecosystems coexist, as e.g. mobile app stores provide vendor lock-ins into particular eco-systems; some technology platforms are converging under one technology, due to e.g. the usage of common communication protocols as in digital TV; and other media are diverging, as e.g. media content offerings are more and more specializing and provides a space for niche media.<ref>Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence is NOT King: The Triadic Phenomenon of Media 'Convergence-Divergence-Coexistance' is King. Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 1, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302467971_Media_Convergence_is_NOT_King_The_Triadic_Phenomenon_of_Media_Convergence-Divergence-Coexistence_IS_King</ref>\n\nAdvances in technology bring the ability for technological convergence that Rheingold believes can alter the \"social-side effects,\" in that \"the virtual, social and physical world are colliding, merging and coordinating.\"<ref name=\"Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82\">Rheingold, Howard (2000) Smart Mobs: the next social revolution, Perseus, Cambridge, Massachusetts, pp 157\u201382</ref> It was predicted in the late 1980s,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1988-02-compute-magazine|title=COMPUTE! magazine issue 93 Feb 1988|quote=If the wheels behind the CD-ROM industry have their way, this product will help open the door to a brave, new multimedia world for  microcomputers, where the computer is intimately linked with the other household electronics, and every gadget in the house reads  tons of video, audio, and text data from CD-ROM disks. |date=February 1988}}</ref> around the time that [[CD-ROM]] was becoming commonplace, that a [[digital revolution]] would take place, and that old media would be pushed to one side by [[new media]]. Broadcasting is increasingly being replaced by the Internet, enabling consumers all over the world the freedom to access their preferred media content more easily and at a more available rate than ever before.\n\nHowever, when the [[dot-com bubble]] of the 1990s suddenly popped, that poured cold water over the talk of such a digital revolution.<ref>Jenkins, H. (2008) Convergence Culture : Where Old and New Media Collide, 2nd ed., p.6</ref> In today's society, the idea of media convergence has once again emerged as a key point of reference as newer as well as established media companies attempt to visualize the future of the entertainment industry. If this revolutionary digital paradigm shift presumed that old media would be increasingly replaced by new media, the convergence paradigm that is currently emerging suggests that new and old media would interact in more complex ways than previously predicted. The paradigm shift that followed the digital revolution assumed that new media was going to change everything. When the dot com market crashed, there was a tendency to imagine that nothing had changed. The real truth lay somewhere in between as there were so many aspects of the current media environment to take into consideration. Many industry leaders are increasingly reverting to media convergence as a way of making sense in an era of disorientating change. In that respect, media convergence in theory is essentially an old concept taking on a new meaning. Media convergence, in reality, is more than just a shift in technology. It alters relationships between industries, technologies, audiences, genres and markets. Media convergence changes the rationality media industries operate in, and the way that media consumers process news and entertainment. Media convergence is essentially a process and not an outcome, so no single black box controls the flow of media. With proliferation of different media channels and increasing portability of new telecommunications and computing technologies, we have entered into an era where media constantly surrounds us.<ref>{{cite web|last=Steiner | first=Tobias | title=Under the Macroscope: Convergence in the US Television Market between 2000 and 2014 | url=https://www.academia.edu/2017902 | work=academia.edu|accessdate=4 Aug 2015}}</ref>\n\nMedia convergence requires that media companies rethink existing assumptions about media from the consumer's point of view, as these affect marketing and programming decisions. Media producers must respond to newly empowered consumers.\nConversely, it would seem that hardware is instead diverging whilst media content is converging. Media has developed into brands that can offer content in a number of forms. Two examples of this are ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[The Matrix]]''. Both are films, but are also books, video games, cartoons, and action figures. Branding encourages expansion of one concept, rather than the creation of new ideas.<ref>Jenkins 2006, p.101-112</ref> In contrast, hardware has diversified to accommodate media convergence. Hardware must be specific to each function. While most scholars argue that the flow of cross-media is accelerating,<ref>Jenkins H, Deuze M (2008) Editorial: Convergence culture. Convergence 14(1): 5\u00a1V12.</ref> O'Donnell suggests, especially between films and video game, the semblance of media convergence is misunderstood by people outside of the media production industry. The conglomeration of media industry continues to sell the same story line in different media. For example, Batman is  in comics, films, anime, and games. However, the data to create the image of batman in each media is created individually by different teams of creators. The same character and the same visual effect repetitively appear in different media is because of the synergy of media industry to make them similar as possible.  In addition, convergence does not happen when the game of two different consoles is produced. No flows between two consoles because it is faster to create game from scratch for the industry.<ref>O'Donnell, Casey. \"Games Are Not Convergence: The Lost Promise Of Digital Production And Convergence.\" Convergence: The Journal of Research Into New Media Technologies 17.3 (2011): 271\u2013286.

Reuters, a major international news service, has created and staffed a news \u201cisland\u201d in the popular online virtual reality environment Second Life (www.secondlife.com, accessed January 3, 2008). Open to anyone, Second Life has emerged as a compelling 3D virtual reality for millions of citizens around the world who have created avatars (virtual representations of themselves) to populate and live in an altered state where personal flight is a reality, altered egos can flourish, and real money (US$1,296,257 were spent during the 24 hours concluding at 10:19&nbsp;a.m. eastern time January 7, 2008) can be made without ever setting foot into the real world.

Media convergence has two roles, the first is the technological merging of different media channels \u2013 for example, magazines, radio programs, TV shows, and movies, now are available on the Internet through laptops, iPads, and smartphones. As discussed in ''Media Culture'' (by Campbell), convergence of technology is not new. It has been going on since the late 1920s.  An example is RCA, the Radio Corporation of America, which purchased Victor Talking Machine Company and introduced machines that could receive radio and play recorded music.  Next came the TV, and radio lost some of its appeal as people started watching television, which has both talking and music as well as visuals.  As technology advances, convergence of media change to keep up. The second definition of media convergence Campbell discusses is cross-platform by media companies. This usually involves consolidating various media holdings, such as cable, phone, television (over the air, satellite, cable) and Internet access under one corporate umbrella. This is not for the consumer to have more media choices, this is for the benefit of the company to cut down on costs and maximize its profits.<ref name=Campbell>Campbell, Richard, Christopher R.

The convergence culture is an important factor in [[transmedia storytelling]].  Convergence culture introduces new stories and arguments from one form of media into many. Transmedia storytelling is defined by Jenkins as a process \"where integral elements of a fiction get dispersed systematically across multiple delivery channels for the purpose of creating a unified and coordinated entertainment experience. Ideally, each medium makes its own unique contribution to the unfolding of the story\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://henryjenkins.org/2011/08/defining_transmedia_further_re.html#sthash.xLqb8MkC.dpuf |title= Transmedia 202: Further Reflections |date=August 1, 2011 |accessdate= April 26, 2017}}</ref> For instance, [[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]] starts as a [[The Matrix|film]], which is followed by two other instalments, but in a convergence culture it is not constrained to that form. It becomes a story not only told in the movies but in [[The Animatrix|animated shorts]], video games and comic books, three different media platforms. Online, a wiki is created to keep track of the story's expanding canon. Fan films, discussion forums, and social media pages also form, expanding The Matrix to different online platforms. Convergence culture took what started as a film and expanded it across almost every type of media.<ref name=\"Jenkens 2009\">HCD Media Group, . Henry Jenkins. 2009. Video.

Because average people can now access their interests on many types of media they can also have more of a say. Fans and consumers are able to participate in the creation and circulation of new content. Some companies take advantage of this and search for feedback from their customers through social media and sharing sites such as [[YouTube]]. \nBesides marketing and entertainment, convergence culture has also affected the way we interact with news and information. We can access news on multiple levels of media from the radio, TV, newspapers, and the internet. The internet allows more people to be able to report the news through independent broadcasts and therefore allows a multitude of perspectives to be put forward and accessed by people in many different areas. Convergence allows news to be gathered on a much larger scale. For instance, photographs were taken of torture at [[Abu Ghraib]]. These photos were shared and eventually posted on the internet. This led to the breaking of a news story in newspapers, on TV, and the internet.<ref name=\"Jenkens 2009\"/>\n\nMedia scholar Henry Jenkins has described the media convergence with [[participatory culture]] as:\n\n{{quote|...a \"catalyst\" for amateur digital film-making and what this case study suggests about the future directions popular culture may take. Star Wars fan films represent the intersection of two significant cultural trends\u2014the corporate movement towards media convergence and the unleashing of significant new tools, which enable the grassroots archiving, annotation, appropriation, and recirculation of media content. These fan films build on long-standing practices of the fan community but they also reflect the influence of this changed technological environment that has dramatically lowered the costs of film production and distribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/cms/People/henry3/starwars.html|title=MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing|accessdate=17 June 2015}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Cell phone convergence ===\n[[File:Librem5 phone convergence - screen keyboard mouse.jpg|thumb|Mobile/desktop convergence: the [[Librem 5]] mobile, when connected to a keyboard, screen, and mouse, runs as a desktop computer.]]\nThe social function of the cell phone changes as the technology converges. Because of technological advancement, cell phones function as more than just as a phone. They contain an internet connection, video players, MP3 players, gaming, and a camera.

Because of the [[Net neutrality|neutrality of the internet]] and the [[End-to-end principle|end-to-end design]], the power structure of the internet was designed to avoid discrimination between applications. Mexico's [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] campaign for land rights was one of the most influential case in the information age; Manuel Castells defines the Zapatistas as \"the first informational guerrilla movement\".<ref>Castells, 2004:82</ref> The Zapatista uprising had been marginalized by the popular press. The Zapatistas were able to construct a grassroots, decentralized social movement by using the internet. The Zapatistas Effect, observed by Cleaver,<ref>Cleaver, 1998</ref> continues to organize social movements on a global scale. A sophisticated webmetric analysis, which maps the links between different websites and seeks to identify important nodal points in a network, demonstrates that the Zapatistas cause binds together hundreds of global NGOs.<ref>Garrido and Halavais, 2003:181</ref> The majority of the social movement organized by Zapatistas targets their campaign especially against global neoliberalism.<ref>Cleaver, 1988:630</ref> A successful social movement not only need online support but also protest on the street. Papic wrote, \"Social Media Alone Do Not Instigate Revolutions\", which discusses how the use of social media in social movements needs good organization both online and offline.<ref>Papic, M., Noonan, S.

In addition to its growth, FCC is tentative to set regulation on VoIP in order to promote competition in the telecommunication industry.<ref>Written in 2011, 10, 27</ref> There is not a clear line between telecommunication service and the information service because of the growth of the new convergent media. Historically, telecommunication is subject to state regulation. The state of California concerned about the increasing popularity of internet telephony will eventually obliterate funding for the [[Universal Service Fund]]<ref>Kopytoff, V. (2005). Internet Phones in Spotlight, Companies face more scrutiny by U.S., state agencies. IP Telephony News, March, 2005.</ref> Some states attempt to assert their traditional role of common carrier oversight onto this new technology.<ref>Cutler, J (2004). California Regulator Vote to Exammine Rules to Control Voice Over Internet Protocol. ''Electronic Commerce and Law Report'' (Vol. 9, No.7) 156-57</ref> Meisel and Needles (2005) suggests that the FCC, federal courts, and state regulatory bodies on access line charges will directly impact the speed in which Internet telephony market grows.<ref>Meisel, J., Needles, M. Voice over Internet protocol development and public policy Implications. INFO: ''the journal of policy, regulation and strategy for telecommunications, information and media,'' Vol.7, Number 3, 2005.</ref> On one hand, the FCC is hesitant to regulate convergent technology because VoIP with different feature from the old Telecommunication; no fixed model to build legislature yet. On the other hand, the regulations is needed because Service over the internet might be quickly replaced telecommunication service, which will affect the entire economy.\n\nConvergence has also raised several debates about classification of certain telecommunications services. As the lines between data transmission, and voice and media transmission are eroded, regulators are faced with the task of how best to classify the converging segments of the telecommunication sector. Traditionally, telecommunication regulation has focused on the operation of physical infrastructure, networks, and access to network. No content is regulated in the telecommunication because the content is considered private. In contrast, film and Television are regulated by contents. The rating system regulates its distribution to the audience. Self-regulation is promoted by the industry. Bogle senior persuaded the entire industry to pay 0.1 percent levy on all advertising and the money was used to give authority to the Advertising Standards Authority, which keeps the government away from setting legislature in the media industry.<ref>PERSPECTIVE: Media convergence puts self-regulation at top of the agenda.\" Campaign 1 Nov. 2002: 02. General Reference Center GOLD. Web. 13 Oct. 2011</ref>\n\nThe premises to regulate the new media, two-ways communications, concerns much about the change from old media to new media. Each medium has different features and characteristics. First, internet, the new medium, manipulates all form of information \u2013 voice, data and video. Second, the old regulation on the old media, such as radio and Television, emphasized its regulation on the scarcity of the channels. Internet, on the other hand, has the limitless capacity, due to the end-to-end design. Third, Two-ways communication encourages interactivity between the content producers and the audiences. \n\"...Fundamental basis for classification, therefore, is to consider the need for regulation in terms of either market failure or in the public interests\"(Blackman).<ref>\nBlackman, Colin.

Wu and Lessig (2004) set out two reasons to adapt neutral network model for computer networks. First, \"a neutral network eliminates the risk of future discrimination, providing more incentive to invest in broadband application development.\" Second, \"neutral network facilitates fair competition among application, no bias between applications.\"<ref>Wu, T., Lessig, L. EX Parte Submission in CS Docket No. 02-52. August, 2004.</ref> The two reasons also coincide with FCC's interest to stimulate investment and enhance innovation in broadband technology and services.<ref>FCC, 2004d</ref><ref>FCC (2004d). Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, March 11, 2004</ref>\nDespite regulatory efforts of deregulation, privatization, and liberalization, the  infrastructure barrier has been a negative factor in achieving effective competition. \"Kim et al. argues that IP dissociates the telephony application from the infrastructure and Internet telephony is at the forefront of such dissociation.\"<ref>Kim, et al. Regulating Internet telephony: The Challenges and the Opportunities. Proceedings of 15th Portland International Conference on Technology Management.</ref>  The neutrality of the network is very important for fair competition.<ref>Wu, T. (2004). Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination, Journal of Telecommunications & High Technology Law, Vol. 2.</ref> As the former FCC Charman [[Michael Powell]] put it: \"From its inception, the Internet was designed, as those present during the course of its creating will tell you, to prevent government or a corporation or anyone else from controlling it. It was designed to defeat [[discrimination]] against users, ideas and technologies\".<ref>FCC (2004f). Remarks of Michael J. Copps: Federal Communications Commissioner: The Beginning Of The End Of The Internet? Discrimination, Closed Networks, And The Future of Cyberspace New America Foundation, Washington, Dc. October 9, 2003.</ref> Because of these reasons, Shin concludes that regulator should make sure to regulate application and infrastructure separately.\n\nThe layered model was first proposed by Solum and Chug, Sicker, and Nakahata. Sicker, Warbach and Witt have supported using a layered model to regulate the telecommunications industry with the emergence of convergence services. Many researchers have different layered approach, but they all agree that the emergence of convergent technology will create challenges and ambiguities for regulations.<ref name = \"Shin\"/> The key point of the layered model is that it reflects the reality of network architecture, and current business model.<ref name = \"Whitt\">Whitt, R.S. (2004). A Horizontal Leap Forward: Formulating a New Communications\nPublic Policy Framework Based on the Network Layers Mode. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS\nLAW JOURNAL, Vol. 56, Number 3, 2004.</ref>\nThe layered Model consists of 1. Access Layer \u2013 where the physical infrastructure resides: copper wires, cable, or fiber optic. 2. transport layer \u2013 the provider of service. 3. Application layer \u2013  the interface between the data and the users. 4. content layer \u2013 the layer which users see.<ref name = \"Whitt\"/> In ''Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications'', Shin combines the Layered Model and Network Neutrality as the principle to regulate the future convergent Media Industry.<ref>Shin, D. , Kim, W. and Lee, D. , 2006-06-16 \"Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications\" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, Dresden International Congress Centre, Dresden, Germany Online <PDF>. 2011-03-14 from http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p91470_index.html</ref>\n\n==Example: Messaging==\nCombination services include those that integrate SMS with voice, such as voice SMS. Providers include Bubble Motion, Jott, Kirusa, and SpinVox. Several operators have launched services that combine SMS with mobile instant messaging (MIM) and presence. Text-to-landline services also exist, where subscribers can send text messages to any landline phone and are charged at standard rates. The text messages are converted into spoken language. This service has been popular in America, where fixed and mobile numbers are similar. Inbound SMS has been converging to enable reception of different formats (SMS, voice, MMS, etc.). In April 2008, O2 UK launched voice-enabled shortcodes, adding voice functionality to the five-digit codes already used for SMS. This type of convergence is helpful for media companies, broadcasters, enterprises, call centres and help desks who need to develop a consistent contact strategy with the consumer. Because SMS is very popular today, it became relevant to include [[text messaging]] as a contact possibility for consumers. To avoid having multiple numbers (one for voice calls, another one for SMS), a simple way is to merge the reception of both formats under one number. This means that a consumer can text or call one number and be sure that the message will be received.\n\n==Example: Mobile==\n\"Mobile service provisions\" refers not only to the ability to purchase mobile phone services, but the ability to wirelessly access everything: voice, Internet, audio, and video. Advancements in [[WiMAX]] and other leading edge technologies provide the ability to transfer information over a wireless link at a variety of speeds, distances, and non-line-of-sight conditions.\n\n==Example: Multi-play in telecommunications==\nMulti-play is a marketing term describing the provision of different telecommunication services, such as [[Internet access]], television, telephone, and mobile phone service, by organisations that traditionally only offered one or two of these services. Multi-play is a catch-all phrase; usually, the terms [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] (voice, video and data) or quadruple play (voice, video, data and wireless) are used to describe a more specific meaning. A dual play service is a marketing term for the provisioning of the two services: it can be high-speed Internet ([[digital subscriber line]]) and telephone service over a single broadband connection in the case of phone companies, or high-speed Internet ([[cable modem]]) and TV service over a single broadband connection in the case of cable TV companies. The convergence can also concern the underlying communication [[infrastructure]]. An example of this is a [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] service, where communication services are packaged allowing consumers to purchase TV, Internet, and [[telephony]] in one subscription. The broadband cable market is transforming as pay-TV providers move aggressively into what was once considered the telco space. Meanwhile, customer expectations have risen as consumer and business customers alike seek rich content, multi-use devices, networked products and converged services including on-demand video, digital TV, high speed Internet, VoIP, and wireless applications. It is uncharted territory for most broadband companies.\n\nA quadruple play service combines the [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] service of broadband Internet access, television, and telephone with [[wireless]] service provisions.<ref>[http://www.d2tech.com/4-news/2007/07-10-29a.htm Integrated Design for VoIP-Enabled Quadruple Play Devices] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226070457/http://www.d2tech.com/4-news/2007/07-10-29a.htm |date=2007-12-26 }}</ref> This service set is also sometimes humorously referred to as \"The [[Fantastic Four]]\" or \"Grand Slam\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cedmagazine.com/cable-consortium-mobilizes-quad-play.aspx|title=Cable consortium mobilizes quad-play with Sprint|work=CED|accessdate=17 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927040031/http://www.cedmagazine.com/cable-consortium-mobilizes-quad-play.aspx|archivedate=27 September 2011}}</ref> A fundamental aspect of the quadruple play is not only the long-awaited broadband convergence but also the players involved. Many of them, from the largest global service providers to whom we connect today via wires and cables to the smallest of startup service providers are interested. Opportunities are attractive: the big three telecom services \u2013 [[telephony]], cable television, and [[wireless]]\u2014could combine their industries. In the UK, the merger of [[Virgin Media|NTL:Telewest]] and [[Virgin Mobile]] resulted in a company offering a quadruple play of cable television, broadband Internet, home telephone, and mobile telephone services.\n\n==Example: Home network==\nEarly in the 21st century, home LAN convergence so rapidly integrated home [[Router (computing)|router]]s, [[wireless access point]]s, and [[DSL modem]]s that users were hard put to identify the resulting box they used to connect their computers to their Internet service. A general term for such a combined device is a [[residential gateway]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Computer multitasking]] (the software equivalent of a converged device)\n* [[Convergence (telecommunications)]]\n* [[Dongle]], can facilitate inclusion of non-converged devices.\n* [[eRhetoric|Digital rhetoric]]\n* [[Generic Access Network]]\n** [[UMA Today]]\n* [[IP Multimedia Subsystem]] (IMS)\n* [[Mobile VoIP]]\n* [[Next Generation Networks]]\n** [[Next generation network services]]\n* [[Post-convergent]]\n* [[Second screen]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Jenkins, H.

Historically, the livelihoods of indigenous Amazonian peoples have depended on the forest for food, shelter, water, fibre, fuel and medicines. The forest is also interconnected with their identity and cosmology. For this reason the deforestation rates are lower in indigenous territories, despite pressures encouraging deforestation being stronger.<ref name=\":0\" /> Many indigenous people are being affected by the deforestation in the Amazon.

Until 2015, only eight percent of Amazonian deforestation occurred in forests inhabited by indigenous peoples, while 88% occurred in the less than 50% of the Amazon area that is neither indigenous territory nor protected area. Historically, the livelihoods of indigenous Amazonian peoples have depended on the forest for food, shelter, water, fibre, fuel and medicines. The forest is also interconnected with their identity and cosmology. For this reason, the deforestation rates are lower in Indigenous Territories, despite pressures encouraging deforestation being stronger.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |last1=Josse |first1=Carmen |title=Indigenous peoples are key stakeholders |url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/indispensable-role-local-communities-protection-amazonian-forests |website=D+C, Development and cooperation}}</ref>\n\nThe native tribes of the Amazon have often been abused during the Amazon's deforestation.

The demand for this land has originated partly from a desire to improve Brazil's economic status. Many people, including ranchers and land swindlers from the southeast, have wanted to claim the land for their own financial gain. As of the beginning of 2019, the new president of Brazil, [[Jair Bolsonaro]], has made an executive order that permits the agriculture ministry to regulate the land that tribal members inhabit in the Amazon. This act is essentially declaring war on the indigenous people in the fight for their territory.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/>\n\nIn the past, mining locations were allowed to be constructed in the territory of an isolated tribal group called [[Yanomami]]. Because of the conditions that these indigenous people were subjected to, many of them developed health problems, including [[tuberculosis]]. If their land is used for new development, many of the tribal groups will be forced out of their homes and many may die. On top of the mistreatment of these people, the forest itself will be taken advantage of and many of the indigenous peoples' resources for daily life will be stripped from them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.survivalinternational.org/tribes/brazilian|title=Brazilian Indians|date=2019|website=Survival}}</ref>\n\n==Future of the Amazon rainforest==\nUsing the 2005 deforestation rates, it was estimated that the Amazon rainforest would be reduced by 40% in two decades.<ref>Wallace, Scott (January 2007) [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/01/amazon-rain-forest/wallace-text \"Last of the Amazon\"].

Until 2015, only 8% of Amazonian deforestation occurred in forests inhabited by indigenous peoples, while 88% of occurred in the less than 50% of the Amazon area that is neither indigenous territory nor protected area. Historically, the livelihoods of indigenous Amazonian peoples have depended on the forest for food, shelter, water, fibre, fuel and medicines. The forest is also interconnected with their identity and cosmology. For this reason the deforestation rates are lower in indigenous territories, despite pressures encouraging deforestation being stronger.<ref name=\":0\" /> Many indigenous people are being affected by the deforestation in the Amazon. They have their homes here and live off the land, thus when there is deforestation and purposeful fires, it endangers their lives\n\nAccording to 2018 satellite data compiled by a deforestation monitoring program called Prodes, deforestation has hit its highest rate in a decade. About 7,900 sq km (3,050 sq miles) of the rainforest was destroyed between August 2017 and July 2018. Most of the deforestation occurred in the states of [[Mato Grosso]] and [[Par\u00e1]].

Until 2015, only eight percent of Amazonian deforestation occurred in forests inhabited by indigenous peoples, while 88% occurred in the less than 50% of the Amazon area that is neither indigenous territory nor protected area. Historically, the livelihoods of indigenous Amazonian peoples have depended on the forest for food, shelter, water, fibre, fuel and medicines.

The demand for this land has originated partly from a desire to improve Brazil's economic status. Many people, including ranchers and land swindlers from the southeast, have wanted to claim the land for their own financial gain. As of the beginning of 2019, the new president of Brazil, [[Jair Bolsonaro]], has made an executive order that permits the agriculture ministry to regulate the land that tribal members inhabit in the Amazon. This act is essentially declaring war on the indigenous people in the fight for their territory.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/>\n\nIn the past, mining locations were allowed to be constructed in the territory of an isolated tribal group called [[Yanomami]]. Because of the conditions that these indigenous people were subjected to, many of them developed health problems, including [[tuberculosis]]. If their land is used for new development, many of the tribal groups will be forced out of their homes and many may die. On top of the mistreatment of these people, the forest itself will be taken advantage of and many of the indigenous peoples' resources for daily life will be stripped from them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.survivalinternational.org/tribes/brazilian|title=Brazilian Indians|date=2019|website=Survival}}</ref>\n\n==Future of the Amazon rainforest==\nUsing the 2005 deforestation rates, it was estimated that the Amazon rainforest would be reduced by 40% in two decades.<ref>Wallace, Scott (January 2007) [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/01/amazon-rain-forest/wallace-text \"Last of the Amazon\"].

Stretching from [[Kongens Nytorv]] to the harbour front just south of the [[Royal Danish Playhouse|Royal Playhouse]], it is lined by brightly coloured 17th and early 18th century [[townhouse]]s and bars, cafes and restaurants. The canal harbours many historical wooden ships.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Nyhavn (Rosens Kort, 1674(.jpg|thumb|160px|Nyhavn seen on a detail from Rosen's Map of Copenhagen, 1674]]\nNyhavn was constructed by [[Christian V of Denmark|King Christian V]] from 1670 to 1675, dug by Swedish prisoners of war from the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658\u20131660)|Dano-Swedish War 1658\u20131660]]. It is a gateway from the sea to the old inner city at [[Kongens Nytorv]] (King's Square), where ships handled cargo and fishermens' catch. It was notorious for beer, sailors, and prostitution. Danish author [[Hans Christian Andersen]] lived at Nyhavn for some 18 years.\n\nThe first bridge across Nyhavn opened on [[1874 in Denmark|1874]]. It was a temporary wooden footbridge. It was replaced by the current bridge in 1912.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nyhavns-skipperlaug.dk/Wikka/wikka.php?wakka=AnDet |title=Nyhavns historie |language=Danish |work=Nyhavns Skipperlaug |accessdate=2 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nyhavn, Copenhagen (Denmark) 01.jpg|left|thumb|The canal]]\nAs ocean-going ships grew larger, Nyhavn was taken over by internal Danish small vessel freight traffic. After World War II land transport took over this role and small vessel traffic disappeared from the Port of Copenhagen, leaving Nyhavn largely deserted of ships.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the Nyhavn Society (Danish: Nyhavnsforeningen) was founded with the aim of revitalising the area. In 1977, Nyhavn was inaugurated as a veteran ship and museum harbour by Copenhagen's Lord Mayor [[Egon Weidekamp]]. In 1980 Nyhavn quay was [[pedestrianised]]; it had been used as a parking area in the previous years which had coincided with a dwindling of harbour activities.<ref name=publicspaces >{{cite book |last1=Gehl |first1=Jan |last2=Gemz\u00f8e |first2=Lars |title=Public Spaces, Public Life, Copenhagen |year=1996 |isbn=877-407-305-2 |publisher=The Danish Noob Architectural Press and the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts |page=20}}</ref> Since then it has become a popular spot for tourists and locals alike, serving the function of a square according to architects [[Jan Gehl]] and Lars Gemz\u00f8e.<ref name=publicspaces />\n\n==Buildings==\n[[File:Nyhavn, Copenhagen, Denmark.jpg|thumb|600 px|Panorama of north side of Nyhavn]]\nThe northern side of Nyhavn is lined by brightly coloured townhouses built with wood, bricks, and plaster. The oldest house, at No. 9, dates from 1681.\n\nBetween 1845 and 1864, [[Hans Christian Andersen]] lived at [[Nyhavn 67|No. 67]], where a memorial plaque now stands. From 1871-1875 Andersen lived at Nyhavn 18,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://visithcandersen.dk/nyhavn_18.htm/ |title=Nyhavn 18 |work=H. C.

From the foundation of the heritage harbour in 1977, the south side of the canal has been reserved for museum ships owned by the [[National Museum of Denmark|Danish National Museum]], which received a donation of carefully restored ships from [[A. P. Moller-Maersk Group|A. P. M\u00f8ller]], while the northern side of the canal was put at the disposal of the Nyhavn Society and privately owned, still usable wooden ships.\nHarbor ships include:\n* ''[[Lightvessel Gedser Rev|Lightvessel XVII Gedser Rev]]'' \u2013 [[lightvessel]] built in [[Odense]] in 1895, in operation until 1972, then acquired by the National Museum and now serving as a museum ship.\n* ''Svalan af Nyhavn'' \u2013 [[galleass]] built in Jungfrusund in 1924\n* ''Anna M\u00f8ller'' \u2013 galleass built in [[Randers]] in 1906\n* ''MA-RI'' \u2013 purpose-built smuggling ship built in 1920; [[Boarding (attack)|boarded]] by custom authorities off [[Helsing\u00f8r|Elsinore]] with smuggling goods aboard in 1923, then confiscated and sold on auction, then operated both as a fishing vessel and as a ferry between [[Poland]] and [[Bornholm]], again as a smuggling vessel.\n* ''Mira'' \u2013 two-masted [[schooner]] built in [[F\u00e5borg]] in 1898, considered one of the finest ships of the Danish small vessel traffic of the time. For many years it transported [[chalk]] from [[Stevns Peninsula|Stevns]]. The first ship on the north side of Nyhavn, coming from Kongens Nytorv.\n* ''[[B\u00e5dteatret|The Boat Theatre]]'' - a [[Lighter (barge)|lighter]]-type [[barge]] built in Copenhagen in 1898, since 1972 operated as a theatre boat.\n\n==The Memorial Anchor==\n[[Image:Anker Nyhavn.jpg|right|thumb|The Memorial Anchor at the end of Nyhavn]]\nThe great Memorial Anchor (Danish: Mindeankeret) at the end of Nyhavn, where it meets Kongens Nytorv, is a monument commemorating the more than 1,700 Danish officers and sailors in service for the [[Royal Danish Navy|Navy]], merchant fleet or [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]], who sacrificed their lives during [[World War II]]. The Anchor was inaugurated in 1951, replacing a temporary wooden cross erected on the spot in 1945, and has a plaque with a monogram of King [[Frederik VII of Denmark|Frederik VII]] on it. The Memorial Anchor is from 1872 and was used on the Frigate Fyn (Funen), which was docked at [[Holmen Naval Base]] during the Second World War. Every year on May 5 \u2013 Denmark's Liberation day 1945 \u2013 an official ceremony is held to honour and commemorate the fallen at the Memorial Anchor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenet.dk/CPH-Nyhavn.htm |title=Nyhavn |work=Copenhagen Portal |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Bars and restaurants==\n[[Image:Nyhavn 24-6-2003.JPG|right|thumb|Bars and restaurants lining the northern, sunny side of Nyhavn]]\nAlong its northern, sunnier side, Nyhavn is lined with many bars and restaurants facing the harbor.  Nyhavn serves as a hub of canal tours, but it can be chilly.\n\n==Transport==\n[[Kongens Nytorv station|Kongens Nytorv metro station]] is located at the end of Nyhavn, though situated at the far end of the namesake square outside [[Magasin du Nord]]. The station is served by both lines [[M1 (Copenhagen)|M1]] and [[M2 (Copenhagen)|M2]] of the [[Copenhagen Metro]].\n\nThe [[Copenhagen Harbour Buses]] has a stop at the mouth of Nyhavn. All four routes of the harbour buses, [[Copenhagen Harbour Buses#901 & 902|Routes 901, 902]], [[Copenhagen Harbour Buses#903|903]] and [[Copenhagen Harbour Buses#904|904]], stop at the bus stop next to the [[Royal Danish Playhouse|Royal Playhouse]].\n\nIn 2016 the [[Inderhavnsbroen|Inner Harbor Bridge]] (Inderhavnsbro) connecting Nyhavn and Christianshavn was opened after years of setbacks and delays.

Stretching from [[Kongens Nytorv]] to the harbour front just south of the [[Royal Danish Playhouse|Royal Playhouse]], it is lined by brightly coloured 17th and early 18th century [[townhouse]]s and bars, cafes and restaurants. The canal harbours many historical wooden ships.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Nyhavn (Rosens Kort, 1674(.jpg|thumb|160px|Nyhavn seen on a detail from Rosen's Map of Copenhagen, 1674]]\nNyhavn was constructed by [[Christian V of Denmark|King Christian V]] from 1670 to 1675, dug by Swedish prisoners of war from the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658\u20131660)|Dano-Swedish War 1658\u20131660]]. It is a gateway from the sea to the old inner city at [[Kongens Nytorv]] (King's Square), where ships handled cargo and fishermens' catch. It was notorious for beer, sailors, and prostitution. Danish author [[Hans Christian Andersen]] lived at Nyhavn for some 18 years.\n\nThe first bridge across Nyhavn opened on [[1874 in Denmark|1874]]. It was a temporary wooden footbridge. It was replaced by the current bridge in 1912.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nyhavns-skipperlaug.dk/Wikka/wikka.php?wakka=AnDet |title=Nyhavns historie |language=Danish |work=Nyhavns Skipperlaug |accessdate=2 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nyhavn, Copenhagen (Denmark) 01.jpg|left|thumb|The canal]]\nAs ocean-going ships grew larger, Nyhavn was taken over by internal Danish small vessel freight traffic. After World War II land transport took over this role and small vessel traffic disappeared from the Port of Copenhagen, leaving Nyhavn largely deserted of ships.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the Nyhavn Society (Danish: Nyhavnsforeningen) was founded with the aim of revitalising the area. In 1977, Nyhavn was inaugurated as a veteran ship and museum harbour by Copenhagen's Lord Mayor [[Egon Weidekamp]]. In 1980 Nyhavn quay was [[pedestrianised]]; it had been used as a parking area in the previous years which had coincided with a dwindling of harbour activities.<ref name=publicspaces >{{cite book |last1=Gehl |first1=Jan |last2=Gemz\u00f8e |first2=Lars |title=Public Spaces, Public Life, Copenhagen |year=1996 |isbn=877-407-305-2 |publisher=The Danish Noob Architectural Press and the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts |page=20}}</ref> Since then it has become a popular spot for tourists and locals alike, serving the function of a square according to architects [[Jan Gehl]] and Lars Gemz\u00f8e.<ref name=publicspaces />\n\n==Buildings==\n[[File:Nyhavn, Copenhagen, Denmark.jpg|thumb|600 px|Panorama of north side of Nyhavn]]\nThe northern side of Nyhavn is lined by brightly coloured townhouses built with wood, bricks, and plaster.

From the foundation of the heritage harbour in 1977, the south side of the canal has been reserved for museum ships owned by the [[National Museum of Denmark|Danish National Museum]], which received a donation of carefully restored ships from [[A. P. Moller-Maersk Group|A. P. M\u00f8ller]], while the northern side of the canal was put at the disposal of the Nyhavn Society and privately owned, still usable wooden ships.\nHarbor ships include:\n* ''[[Lightvessel Gedser Rev|Lightvessel XVII Gedser Rev]]'' \u2013 [[lightvessel]] built in [[Odense]] in 1895, in operation until 1972, then acquired by the National Museum and now serving as a museum ship.\n* ''Svalan af Nyhavn'' \u2013 [[galleass]] built in Jungfrusund in 1924\n* ''Anna M\u00f8ller'' \u2013 galleass built in [[Randers]] in 1906\n* ''MA-RI'' \u2013 purpose-built smuggling ship built in 1920; [[Boarding (attack)|boarded]] by custom authorities off [[Helsing\u00f8r|Elsinore]] with smuggling goods aboard in 1923, then confiscated and sold on auction, then operated both as a fishing vessel and as a ferry between [[Poland]] and [[Bornholm]], again as a smuggling vessel.\n* ''Mira'' \u2013 two-masted [[schooner]] built in [[F\u00e5borg]] in 1898, considered one of the finest ships of the Danish small vessel traffic of the time.

The Anchor was inaugurated in 1951, replacing a temporary wooden cross erected on the spot in 1945, and has a plaque with a monogram of King [[Frederik VII of Denmark|Frederik VII]] on it. The Memorial Anchor is from 1872 and was used on the Frigate Fyn (Funen), which was docked at [[Holmen Naval Base]] during the Second World War.

Her height was 142&nbsp;cm, which is small even by contemporary standards; skinfolds point at a stout body.\n\nA first examination in 1976 by [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] Bruno Kaufmann revealed that [[Mercury sulfide]] (found in the whole body, especially in the lungs), prevented decay and was responsible for the mummification. Atmospheric conditions within the coffin and grave chamber also prevented [[microbes]] from breaking down the corpse.<ref>Spektrum der Wissenschaft; Spezial Arch\u00e4ologie - Geschichte - Kultur 3/2018, S. 76ff (german)</ref>\n\n==Recent research==\nSince 2015, the mummy has been investigated using modern methods at the [[Natural History Museum of Basel]]. [[CT scan|Computer tomography]] revealed [[atherosclerosis]] of the abdominal [[aorta]] and [[gall stones|gallstones]], pointing at a diet consisting mainly of carbohydrates and fatty meat. During her lifetime, the woman had lost all the teeth in her upper jaw due to a sugary diet and oral hygiene neglect; her lower incisors and canines, although [[Tooth decay|decayed]], were preserved.\n[[File:Behandlung mit Quecksilberd\u00e4mpfen.jpeg|thumb|Treatment with mercury vapour.

Mercury was indeed found in the body of Anna Catharina Bischoff, but with the data available at present, it is not possible to ascertain whether this had actually led to her death. Thus, the cause of her death cannot be proven beyond doubt.

When the workers lifted the memorial slab labeled number 11, they discovered a grave underneath with three coffins. In 2016, Marie-Louise Gamma and Diana Gysin, members of Basel's citizen-researchers who discover and transcribe historic sources, discovered the relevant text in contractor Blendinger's notes, describing the text on the memorial slab as follows (in the original in German):\n\n''Memorial slab no. 11, walled grave, contains 3 coffins. Here rests with God the noble and honorable Isaak Byschoff, former Hospital Master, died peacefully on 2 November 1709. At the age of 67 years minus ... months. Awaiting his Blissful resurrection in Jesus Christ. Here rests with God the honorable and virtuous Catharina Gyssendorfferin, housemistress, wife of Isaak Byschoff, the former Hospital Master. Died blissfully on 9 August ao 1697, aged 41 years. Awaiting blissful resurrection. (105)''\n\nThe number 105 references the memorial slab register of the Barf\u00fcsser Church of 1771, containing 110 family gravesites and information about the buried. It is kept in the State Archive of Basel City as StABS Bauakten JJ 32 bis 33\u2019. In position 105 for the gravesite of the Hospital Master Bischoff, it is noted that his granddaughter Anna Catharina Bischoff was buried in August 1787.\n\nMoreover, Blendinger noted:\n\n''N.b. Under this slab there was a walled grave (without soil), wherein 2 black and one yellow coffins, all well-preserved, were located. In the two black coffins were male, in the yellow one a small female corpse. They were all well preserved and resembled mummies, for their bodies were dried out only, their clothes still pleated; hair, teeth and fingernails still intact. Once they were taken out and inspected, they were buried again in the crypt, but covered with soil.\n''\nThus for the first time there was a name for the mummy. Blendinger's description of the \"small female corpse\" coincides with the mummy of Anna Catharina Bischoff exhumed in 1975 for the second time.\n\n==Genealogy== \n[[File:Boris Johnson official portrait (cropped).jpg |thumb|upright|A descendant of the Barf\u00fcsser Church lady: the UK Prime Minister and Fromer Mayor of London [[Boris Johnson]]]]\n\nA research team of the Institute of Mummy Research of [[Eurac Research]] in [[Bozen]] succeeded in isolating the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] [[DNA]] of the mummy and identifying a variant of the [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|haplogroup U]], providing the basis for scientific identification. Female descendants of the mummy needed to be found to compare their saliva with the mummy's DNA. The team of genealogists of Basel's citizen-researchers undertook this painstaking task and drew a family tree of the female line with information drawn from church and marriage records and internet groups.  (A further project of the Citizen Science was, for example, the research on [[Theo the Pipe Smoker]].)\n\nJustina Froben, born 1512, was identified as Anna Catharina Bischoff's oldest ancestor, seven generations back: the daughter of the printer [[Johann Froben]] in Basel. From her, Marie-Louise Gamma and Diana Gysin were able to reconstruct an uninterrupted female line over 15 generations, from the beginning of the 16th century to Rosemary Probst-Ryhiner in the present.

She was born on 23 March 1719 as the oldest of five siblings, of which only her younger sister Anna Margaretha survived past childhood. Her parents were the reformed pastor Johann Jakob Bischoff (1683\u20131733) and Augusta Margaretha Burckhardt (1697\u20131735). The family was well-off and lived in the centre of Strasbourg in a ten-room, two-story house with a maid.\n\nHer father died in 1733 aged 49, when Anna Catharina was 14. The same year, the widow Augusta Margaretha Burckhardt returned with her two young daughters to Basel, her city of origin. Just before the move, Anna Catharina met her future husband, Lucas Gernler (1704\u20131781), 15 years her senior. In 1732/33 he acted as a substitute for her father in [[Wolfisheim]], where services were held. Later, he would be his successor.\n\nAfter their wedding in 1738 in Basel, the couple returned to Strasbourg, where Anna Catherina gave birth to seven children, of which only two daughters survived past childhood. Augusta remained single and the other, Anna Katharina Gernler (1739\u20131776), married the German historian and diplomat Christian Friedrich Pfeffel von Kriegelstein. She died in Versailles in 1776 aged 37.\n\nIn 1781, Lucas Gernler died from a stroke aged 77, leaving behind countless letters and a church [[hymnal]]; a year later, Anna Catharina, then 62, moved to Basel. Until her death she likely lived with her younger sister Anna Margareta Geym\u00fcller-Bischoff (1724\u20131804), who had married a wealthy trader.<ref>Gerhard Hotz et al.: Der r\u00e4tselhafte Mumienfund aus der Barf\u00fcsserkirche in Basel; Schweizerische Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Familienforschung in der Schweiz; Jahrbuch 2018, Vol. 45, S. 35\u201364</ref>\n\nAnna Catharina's great-grandson Karl Maximilian von Pfeffel (1811\u20131890) later married the illegitimate daughter of [[Prince Paul of W\u00fcrttemberg]], Karoline von Rothenburg.

The skull belongs to a roughly 25-year-old man, the rest of the skeleton to a roughly 40-year-old woman.

When the workers lifted the memorial slab labeled number 11, they discovered a grave underneath with three coffins. In 2016, Marie-Louise Gamma and Diana Gysin, members of Basel's citizen-researchers who discover and transcribe historic sources, discovered the relevant text in contractor Blendinger's notes, describing the text on the memorial slab as follows (in the original in German):\n\n''Memorial slab no. 11, walled grave, contains 3 coffins. Here rests with God the noble and honorable Isaak Byschoff, former Hospital Master, died peacefully on 2 November 1709. At the age of 67 years minus ... months. Awaiting his Blissful resurrection in Jesus Christ. Here rests with God the honorable and virtuous Catharina Gyssendorfferin, housemistress, wife of Isaak Byschoff, the former Hospital Master. Died blissfully on 9 August ao 1697, aged 41 years. Awaiting blissful resurrection. (105)''\n\nThe number 105 references the memorial slab register of the Barf\u00fcsser Church of 1771, containing 110 family gravesites and information about the buried. It is kept in the State Archive of Basel City as StABS Bauakten JJ 32 bis 33\u2019. In position 105 for the gravesite of the Hospital Master Bischoff, it is noted that his granddaughter Anna Catharina Bischoff was buried in August 1787.\n\nMoreover, Blendinger noted:\n\n''N.b. Under this slab there was a walled grave (without soil), wherein 2 black and one yellow coffins, all well-preserved, were located. In the two black coffins were male, in the yellow one a small female corpse. They were all well preserved and resembled mummies, for their bodies were dried out only, their clothes still pleated; hair, teeth and fingernails still intact. Once they were taken out and inspected, they were buried again in the crypt, but covered with soil.\n''\nThus for the first time there was a name for the mummy. Blendinger's description of the \"small female corpse\" coincides with the mummy of Anna Catharina Bischoff exhumed in 1975 for the second time.\n\n==Genealogy== \n[[File:Boris Johnson official portrait (cropped).jpg |thumb|upright|A descendant of the Barf\u00fcsser Church lady: the UK Prime Minister and Fromer Mayor of London [[Boris Johnson]]]]\n\nA research team of the Institute of Mummy Research of [[Eurac Research]] in [[Bozen]] succeeded in isolating the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] [[DNA]] of the mummy and identifying a variant of the [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|haplogroup U]], providing the basis for scientific identification. Female descendants of the mummy needed to be found to compare their saliva with the mummy's DNA. The team of genealogists of Basel's citizen-researchers undertook this painstaking task and drew a family tree of the female line with information drawn from church and marriage records and internet groups.  (A further project of the Citizen Science was, for example, the research on [[Theo the Pipe Smoker]].)\n\nJustina Froben, born 1512, was identified as Anna Catharina Bischoff's oldest ancestor, seven generations back: the daughter of the printer [[Johann Froben]] in Basel. From her, Marie-Louise Gamma and Diana Gysin were able to reconstruct an uninterrupted female line over 15 generations, from the beginning of the 16th century to Rosemary Probst-Ryhiner in the present. A second line was identified in the US, to where one of Anna Catharina Bischoff's descendants had emigrated in the 19th century.

When the workers lifted the memorial slab labeled number 11, they discovered a grave underneath with three coffins. In 2016, Marie-Louise Gamma and Diana Gysin, members of Basel's citizen-researchers who discover and transcribe historic sources, discovered the relevant text in contractor Blendinger's notes, describing the text on the memorial slab as follows (in the original in German):\n\n''Memorial slab no. 11, walled grave, contains 3 coffins. Here rests with God the noble and honorable Isaak Byschoff, former Hospital Master, died peacefully on 2 November 1709. At the age of 67 years minus ... months.

(105)''\n\nThe number 105 references the memorial slab register of the Barf\u00fcsser Church of 1771, containing 110 family gravesites and information about the buried. It is kept in the State Archive of Basel City as StABS Bauakten JJ 32 bis 33\u2019. In position 105 for the gravesite of the Hospital Master Bischoff, it is noted that his granddaughter Anna Catharina Bischoff was buried in August 1787.\n\nMoreover, Blendinger noted:\n\n''N.b. Under this slab there was a walled grave (without soil), wherein 2 black and one yellow coffins, all well-preserved, were located. In the two black coffins were male, in the yellow one a small female corpse. They were all well preserved and resembled mummies, for their bodies were dried out only, their clothes still pleated; hair, teeth and fingernails still intact. Once they were taken out and inspected, they were buried again in the crypt, but covered with soil.\n''\nThus for the first time there was a name for the mummy. Blendinger's description of the \"small female corpse\" coincides with the mummy of Anna Catharina Bischoff exhumed in 1975 for the second time.\n\n==Genealogy== \n[[File:Boris Johnson official portrait (cropped).jpg |thumb|upright|A descendant of the Barf\u00fcsser Church lady: the UK Prime Minister and Fromer Mayor of London [[Boris Johnson]]]]\n\nA research team of the Institute of Mummy Research of [[Eurac Research]] in [[Bozen]] succeeded in isolating the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] [[DNA]] of the mummy and identifying a variant of the [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|haplogroup U]], providing the basis for scientific identification. Female descendants of the mummy needed to be found to compare their saliva with the mummy's DNA. The team of genealogists of Basel's citizen-researchers undertook this painstaking task and drew a family tree of the female line with information drawn from church and marriage records and internet groups.  (A further project of the Citizen Science was, for example, the research on [[Theo the Pipe Smoker]].)\n\nJustina Froben, born 1512, was identified as Anna Catharina Bischoff's oldest ancestor, seven generations back: the daughter of the printer [[Johann Froben]] in Basel.

A second line was identified in the US, to where one of Anna Catharina Bischoff's descendants had emigrated in the 19th century. DNA samples of both families were [[Genealogical DNA test|analysed]], both revealing a coincidence with the mummy's DNA of over 99.8%.

She was born on 23 March 1719 as the oldest of five siblings, of which only her younger sister Anna Margaretha survived past childhood. Her parents were the reformed pastor Johann Jakob Bischoff (1683\u20131733) and Augusta Margaretha Burckhardt (1697\u20131735). The family was well-off and lived in the centre of Strasbourg in a ten-room, two-story house with a maid.\n\nHer father died in 1733 aged 49, when Anna Catharina was 14. The same year, the widow Augusta Margaretha Burckhardt returned with her two young daughters to Basel, her city of origin. Just before the move, Anna Catharina met her future husband, Lucas Gernler (1704\u20131781), 15 years her senior. In 1732/33 he acted as a substitute for her father in [[Wolfisheim]], where services were held. Later, he would be his successor.\n\nAfter their wedding in 1738 in Basel, the couple returned to Strasbourg, where Anna Catherina gave birth to seven children, of which only two daughters survived past childhood. Augusta remained single and the other, Anna Katharina Gernler (1739\u20131776), married the German historian and diplomat Christian Friedrich Pfeffel von Kriegelstein. She died in Versailles in 1776 aged 37.\n\nIn 1781, Lucas Gernler died from a stroke aged 77, leaving behind countless letters and a church [[hymnal]]; a year later, Anna Catharina, then 62, moved to Basel. Until her death she likely lived with her younger sister Anna Margareta Geym\u00fcller-Bischoff (1724\u20131804), who had married a wealthy trader.<ref>Gerhard Hotz et al.: Der r\u00e4tselhafte Mumienfund aus der Barf\u00fcsserkirche in Basel; Schweizerische Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Familienforschung in der Schweiz; Jahrbuch 2018, Vol. 45, S. 35\u201364</ref>\n\nAnna Catharina's great-grandson Karl Maximilian von Pfeffel (1811\u20131890) later married the illegitimate daughter of [[Prince Paul of W\u00fcrttemberg]], Karoline von Rothenburg.

The skull belongs to a roughly 25-year-old man, the rest of the skeleton to a roughly 40-year-old woman. It could be the remains of Catharina's grandmother Catharina Gysend\u00f6rffer, buried in 1697 aged 41.

The mummy was mostly intact: only the head and feet had decomposed while parts of her dress and hair were conserved. Her height was 142&nbsp;cm, which is small even by contemporary standards; skinfolds point at a stout body.\n\nA first examination in 1976 by [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] Bruno Kaufmann revealed that [[Mercury sulfide]] (found in the whole body, especially in the lungs), prevented decay and was responsible for the mummification. Atmospheric conditions within the coffin and grave chamber also prevented [[microbes]] from breaking down the corpse.<ref>Spektrum der Wissenschaft; Spezial Arch\u00e4ologie - Geschichte - Kultur 3/2018, S. 76ff (german)</ref>\n\n==Recent research==\nSince 2015, the mummy has been investigated using modern methods at the [[Natural History Museum of Basel]]. [[CT scan|Computer tomography]] revealed [[atherosclerosis]] of the abdominal [[aorta]] and [[gall stones|gallstones]], pointing at a diet consisting mainly of carbohydrates and fatty meat. During her lifetime, the woman had lost all the teeth in her upper jaw due to a sugary diet and oral hygiene neglect; her lower incisors and canines, although [[Tooth decay|decayed]], were preserved.\n[[File:Behandlung mit Quecksilberd\u00e4mpfen.jpeg|thumb|Treatment with mercury vapour. In a small chamber, mercury vapour was inhaled. Illustration of the 17th century]]\n\nThe detection of [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] in the lungs and other organs of Anna Catharina Bischoff led the medical historians of the 1970s to the conclusion that the woman had undergone a mercury inhalation therapy. In those days, it was the usual method of treatment, which, however, was only administered to patients with severe cases of [[syphilis]].<ref>[https://www.geni.com/people/Anna-Catharina/6000000044219255864 geni.com]</ref>\n\nModern analytical methods for measuring the level of mercury exposure indicate that the amount administered was below the threshold to have caused [[mercury poisoning]]. Mercury was indeed found in the body of Anna Catharina Bischoff, but with the data available at present, it is not possible to ascertain whether this had actually led to her death. Thus, the cause of her death cannot be proven beyond doubt. Further investigation is necessary to indicate whether this was caused by the syphilis or a combination of syphilis and mercury exposure. <ref>Report Thomas Briellmann, forensic toxicologist, University Basel</ref>\n\n==Identification== \n[[File:Aktennotiz Blendinger.jpg|thumb|upright|File note by contractor Blendinger]]\nAccording to the prominent position of her grave, it can be deduced that the deceased was a member of a privileged class\u2014the location was reserved for members of the high clergy or dignitaries.<ref>[https://www.bzbasel.ch/basel/basel-stadt/die-identitaet-der-basler-barfuesser-mumie-ist-entschluesselt-die-blutlinie-fuehrt-in-bekannte-kreise-132128489 www.bzbasel.ch of 25 january 2018 (German)]</ref>\n \nChurch archive documents show that the shaft in front of the choir had been opened once before 1843 when the nave of the church was transformed into a commercial warehouse. When the workers lifted the memorial slab labeled number 11, they discovered a grave underneath with three coffins. In 2016, Marie-Louise Gamma and Diana Gysin, members of Basel's citizen-researchers who discover and transcribe historic sources, discovered the relevant text in contractor Blendinger's notes, describing the text on the memorial slab as follows (in the original in German):\n\n''Memorial slab no. 11, walled grave, contains 3 coffins. Here rests with God the noble and honorable Isaak Byschoff, former Hospital Master, died peacefully on 2 November 1709. At the age of 67 years minus ... months. Awaiting his Blissful resurrection in Jesus Christ. Here rests with God the honorable and virtuous Catharina Gyssendorfferin, housemistress, wife of Isaak Byschoff, the former Hospital Master. Died blissfully on 9 August ao 1697, aged 41 years. Awaiting blissful resurrection. (105)''\n\nThe number 105 references the memorial slab register of the Barf\u00fcsser Church of 1771, containing 110 family gravesites and information about the buried. It is kept in the State Archive of Basel City as StABS Bauakten JJ 32 bis 33\u2019. In position 105 for the gravesite of the Hospital Master Bischoff, it is noted that his granddaughter Anna Catharina Bischoff was buried in August 1787.\n\nMoreover, Blendinger noted:\n\n''N.b. Under this slab there was a walled grave (without soil), wherein 2 black and one yellow coffins, all well-preserved, were located. In the two black coffins were male, in the yellow one a small female corpse. They were all well preserved and resembled mummies, for their bodies were dried out only, their clothes still pleated; hair, teeth and fingernails still intact. Once they were taken out and inspected, they were buried again in the crypt, but covered with soil.\n''\nThus for the first time there was a name for the mummy. Blendinger's description of the \"small female corpse\" coincides with the mummy of Anna Catharina Bischoff exhumed in 1975 for the second time.\n\n==Genealogy== \n[[File:Boris Johnson official portrait (cropped).jpg |thumb|upright|A descendant of the Barf\u00fcsser Church lady: the UK Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]]]]\n\nA research team of the Institute of Mummy Research of [[Eurac Research]] in [[Bozen]] succeeded in isolating the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] [[DNA]] of the mummy and identifying a variant of the [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|haplogroup U]], providing the basis for scientific identification. Female descendants of the mummy needed to be found to compare their saliva with the mummy's DNA. The team of genealogists of Basel's citizen-researchers undertook this painstaking task and drew a family tree of the female line with information drawn from church and marriage records and internet groups.  (A further project of the Citizen Science was, for example, the research on [[Theo the Pipe Smoker]].)\n\nJustina Froben, born 1512, was identified as Anna Catharina Bischoff's oldest ancestor, seven generations back: the daughter of the printer [[Johann Froben]] in Basel. From her, Marie-Louise Gamma and Diana Gysin were able to reconstruct an uninterrupted female line over 15 generations, from the beginning of the 16th century to Rosemary Probst-Ryhiner in the present. A second line was identified in the US, to where one of Anna Catharina Bischoff's descendants had emigrated in the 19th century. DNA samples of both families were [[Genealogical DNA test|analysed]], both revealing a coincidence with the mummy's DNA of over 99.8%. It was thereby proven that Anna Catharina Bischoff, born on 23 March 1719 in Strasburg, was buried on 30 August 1787 in Basel.<ref> Gerhard Hotz et al.: Der r\u00e4tselhafte Mumienfund aus der Barf\u00fcsserkirche in Basel; Schweizerische Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Familienforschung in der Schweiz; Jahrbuch 2018, Vol. 45, S. 35\u201364</ref>\n\nA direct connection through Anna Catharina Bischoff's son-in-law Christian Friedrich Pfeffel von Kriegelstein leads to the British politician [[Boris Johnson]]; his great-grandmother was Marie Luise [[Pfeffel family|von Pfeffel]].<ref>[https://www.bzbasel.ch/basel/basel-stadt/die-identitaet-der-basler-barfuesser-mumie-ist-entschluesselt-die-blutlinie-fuehrt-in-bekannte-kreise-132128489 www.bzbasel.ch. 25.

She was born on 23 March 1719 as the oldest of five siblings, of which only her younger sister Anna Margaretha survived past childhood. Her parents were the reformed pastor Johann Jakob Bischoff (1683\u20131733) and Augusta Margaretha Burckhardt (1697\u20131735). The family was well-off and lived in the centre of Strasbourg in a ten-room, two-story house with a maid.\n\nHer father died in 1733 aged 49, when Anna Catharina was 14. The same year, the widow Augusta Margaretha Burckhardt returned with her two young daughters to Basel, her city of origin. Just before the move, Anna Catharina met her future husband, Lucas Gernler (1704\u20131781), 15 years her senior. In 1732/33 he acted as a substitute for her father in [[Wolfisheim]], where services were held. Later, he would be his successor.\n\nAfter their wedding in 1738 in Basel, the couple returned to Strasbourg, where Anna Catherina gave birth to seven children, of which only two daughters survived past childhood. Augusta remained single and the other, Anna Katharina Gernler (1739\u20131776), married the German historian and diplomat Christian Friedrich Pfeffel von Kriegelstein. She died in Versailles in 1776 aged 37.\n\nIn 1781, Lucas Gernler died from a stroke aged 77, leaving behind countless letters and a church [[hymnal]]; a year later, Anna Catharina, then 62, moved to Basel. Until her death she likely lived with her younger sister Anna Margareta Geym\u00fcller-Bischoff (1724\u20131804), who had married a wealthy trader.<ref>Gerhard Hotz et al.: Der r\u00e4tselhafte Mumienfund aus der Barf\u00fcsserkirche in Basel; Schweizerische Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Familienforschung in der Schweiz; Jahrbuch 2018, Vol. 45, S. 35\u201364</ref>\n\nAnna Catharina's great-grandson Karl Maximilian von Pfeffel (1811\u20131890) later married the illegitimate daughter of [[Prince Paul of W\u00fcrttemberg]], Karoline von Rothenburg. The couple are the great-great-grandparents of Boris Johnson, who thereby is a descendant of the lady of the Barf\u00fcsser Church in the seventh generation.<ref>[https://www.nmbs.ch/home/info_angebote/mediencorner/pressebilder/barfuessermumie.html nmbs.ch]</ref>\n\n==Open questions==\nA team of 40 from the fields of [[anthropology]], [[genealogy]], [[Forensic science|forensic medicine]], [[molecular biology]], [[history of medicine]] and [[toxicology]] conducted the research underpinning the identification of the dead woman. Despite these comprehensive inquiries, several questions remain open, such as:\n* What is the significance of the striking position of the hands?\n* What happened to the two mummies of males mentioned 1843 by Blendinger?\n* What is the origin of the skeleton found in 1975 in the upper coffin? The skull belongs to a roughly 25-year-old man, the rest of the skeleton to a roughly 40-year-old woman. It could be the remains of Catharina's grandmother Catharina Gysend\u00f6rffer, buried in 1697 aged 41. The identity of the male, to whom the skull belonged, has not been ascertained.<ref>Spektrum der Wissenschaft; Spezial Arch\u00e4ologie - Geschichte - Kultur 3/2018, S. 82</ref>\n* Was there a correspondence between Anna Catharina Bischoff and her daughter Katharina Gernler (1739-1776)? If yes, in which archive could the letters been found?\n* Is there a portrait of Anna Catharina Bischoff and her husband Lucas Gernler?\n\nThe team keeps researching with the objective to answer the open questions and to make the life and work of Anna Catharina Bischoff available to a wider interested public in form of a book.
