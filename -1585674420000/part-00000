The most important are the following:\n* [[Dacian language|Dacian]] name having the same root \"nap\" (cf. ancient [[Armenian language|Armenian]] root \"nap\") as that of the Dacian river Naparis attested by [[Herodotus]], but with an augmentative suffix uk/ok i.e. over, great<ref>Tomaschek  (1883) 406</ref>\n* Name derived from that of the Dacianized [[Scythian]] tribe known as the Napae<ref>P\u00e2rvan (1982)  p.165 and p.82</ref>\n* Name probably akin to an indigenous ([[Thracian]]) element in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the word n\u0103p\u00e2rc\u0103 'viper' cf. [[Albanian language|Albanian]] nep\u00ebrk\u00eb, nep\u00ebrtk\u00eb<ref>Paliga (2006) 142</ref>\n* Name derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] term ''napos'' ({{lang|grc|\u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2}}), meaning \"timbered valley\"\n* Name derived from the [[Indo-European root]] ''*sn\u0101-p-'' ([[Indogermanisches etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch|Pokorny]] 971-2), \"to flow, to swim, damp\".{{sfn|Luk\u00e1cs|2005|p=14}}\n\nIndependent of these hypotheses, scholars agree that the name of the settlement predates the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Roman conquest]] (AD 106).{{sfn|Luk\u00e1cs|2005|p=14}}\n\n=== Pre-Roman times ===\n\nThe oldest human settlement near [[Cluj]], dating from the [[Neolithic Age]], is at [[Gura Baciului]], near [[Suceagu]], in the valley of a tributary of the [[Nad\u0103\u0219 River (Some\u0219)|Nad\u0103\u0219 river]] and nearby the [[Hoia Forest]]. The settlement dates back to 6000\u20135500 BCE, making it the oldest in [[Transylvania]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Archaeologists have connected it with the [[Star\u010devo\u2013K\u0151r\u00f6s\u2013Cri\u015f culture]], and other similar settlements have been discovered since: a tomb from this same culture in the [[M\u0103n\u0103\u0219tur]] district, and another settlement  on the [[Strada Memorandumului]].\n\nTraces of the [[Thracians|Thracian]]-[[Dacians]] and [[Celts]] suggest that the region was occupied intermittently throughout the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age|Iron]] Ages. As economies centered around cattle-raising developed in the [[Pannonian plain]], the importance of the salt trade with the [[Transylvanian Plain]] became ever more important. Two major routes, one running north\u2013south and the other east\u2013west, met on the right end of a ford under the promontory of a hill, today named Cet\u0103\u021buie. Presumably there was at one time a [[Dacia]]n fortress controlling this central communication point, which would later have been destroyed in the early 18th century construction of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]] fortifications.\n\n=== Roman times ===\n[[File:Napoca Roman fort.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Napoca (castra)|The fort of Roman city]] ]]\n[[File:Milliarum of Aiton, modern copy erected in Turda, Romania in 1993.jpg|thumb|right|''Milliarium of Aiton'', the oldest known epigraphical attestation of Napoca \u2013 a copy erected in June 1993 in front of the [[Turda]] Post Office]]\nThe Romans conquered [[Dacia]] between AD 101 and 106 under [[Trajan]], and a Roman settlement of Napoca is first recorded on a milestone found in 1758 in the nearby [[Aiton, Cluj|Aiton]] commune.<ref name=\"roman\">Lazarovici ''et al.'' 1997, pp. 202\u20133 (6.2 Cluj in the Old and Ancient Epochs)</ref>\n\nThe [[Milliarium of Aiton]] is an ancient Roman milestone (''milliarium'') dating from 108 AD, shortly after the [[Roman conquest of Dacia|conquest]], evidence of the construction of a road from [[Potaissa]] to Napoca.

Kolozsvar-Klausenburg became a [[royal free city]] in 1405. By this time the number of Saxon and [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] inhabitants was equal, and King [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|Matthias Corvinus]] (born in Klausenburg in 1440) ordered that the office of the chief judge should alternate between Hungarians and Saxons.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe [[lovers of Cluj-Napoca]] are believed to have lived between 1450 and 1550.\n\n[[Image:Johannes de Thurocz 164 Cod Pal germ 156 Chronica Hungarorum.jpg|thumb|left|Matthias Corvinus heraldry as depicted in [[Johannes de Thurocz]]'s manuscript (1490)]]\n\n==Principality of Transylvania==\n{{Main|Principality of Transylvania (1571\u20131711)}}\nIn 1541 Klausenburg became part of the autonomous ''Principality of Transylvania'' after the [[Ottoman Turks]] occupied the central part of the Hungarian Kingdom. Although [[Alba Iulia]] served as political capital for the Principality of Siebenb\u00fcrgen (Transylvania), Klausenburg was the main cultural and religious center for the principality. In 1581, [[Stefan Batory]], Governor of Transylvania, took the initiative in founding a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] academy in Klausenburg.\n\nBetween 1545 and 1570, large numbers of [[Germans]] (Saxons) left the city due to the introduction of [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] doctrines. The remaining Germans were assimilated to Hungarians, and the city became a centre for Hungarian nobility and intellectuals. With the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699, Klausenburg became part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].\n\n==Austrian Empire and Grand Principality of Transylvania==\n[[Image:Cluj-Napoca at 1759 (by Janos Szakal).jpg|thumb|The town in 1759]]\nFrom 1790 to 1848 and again from 1861 to 1867, Klausenburg was the capital of the [[Grand Principality of Transylvania]] (Siebenb\u00fcrgen) within the [[Austrian Empire]]; the city was also the seat of the Transylvanian diets. Beginning in 1830, the city became the centre of the Hungarian national movement within the principality. During the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Revolutions of 1848]], Klausenburg was taken and garrisoned in December by Hungarian troops under the command of the [[Poland|Polish]] general [[J\u00f3zef Bem]].\n\nIn 1776, Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] founded a German university in Cluj. But this enterprise was not to survive long, Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] replacing the university with the famous Piarist Highschool, where the teaching was done in Latin. The first Hungarian-language newspaper was published in Klausenburg in 1791, and the first Hungarian theatrical company was established in 1792. In 1798, the city was heavily damaged by a fire.\n\nFor lighting, oil lamps were introduced in 1826, gas lamps in 1861 and electric lights in 1906.<ref>Lazarovici et al. 1997, p.73 (4.1 Centru al mi\u015fc\u0103rii revolu\u0163ionare)</ref>\n\n==Austro-Hungarian Empire==\n[[File:Josephinische Landaufnahme pg083.jpg|right|Cluj-Napoca in the Grand Duchy of Transylvania maps, 1769\u20131773. Josephinische Landesaufnahme|300px|thumb]]\n\nAfter the [[Ausgleich]] (compromise) which created [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1867, Klausenburg and Transylvania were again integrated into the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. During this time, Kolozsvar was among the largest and most important cities of the kingdom, and was the seat of [[Kolozs]] County. In 1897, the Hungarian government decided that only Hungarian place names should be used and therefore prohibited the use of the German or Romanian versions of the city's name in official government documents.<ref name=\"castellan89\">Georges Castellan, ''A history of the Romanians'', [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], 1989, pp.148</ref>\n\nIn 1872, the authorities established a University in Cluj, <!--({{lang-ro|Universitatea din Cluj}}, {{lang-hu|Kolozsv\u00e1ri Tudom\u00e1nyegyetem}})--> with teaching exclusively in Hungarian, which caused discontent amongst the Romanian population. In 1881 the University was renamed ''Franz Joseph University'' after Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]].\n\n==Twentieth century==\n\nAfter [[World War I]], Cluj became part of the [[Kingdom of Romania]], along with the rest of [[Transylvania]]. The Romanian authorities took over the University of Cluj, transforming it into a Romanian institution. On May 12, 1919, the Romanian University of Cluj was set up, with [[Ferdinand I of Romania|King Ferdinand]] proclaiming the University open on February 1, 1920.\n\nIn 1940 Cluj was returned to Hungary through the [[Second Vienna Award]], but Hungarian forces in the city were defeated by the [[Red Army|Soviet]] and [[Romania]]n armies in October 1944. Cluj was restored to Romania by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Treaty of Paris]] in 1947. The [[Romanian People's Tribunals|Northern Transylvania People's Tribunal]] was set up in Cluj by the post-World War II government of Romania, overseen by the [[Allied Commission|Allied Control Commission]], to try suspected war criminals. The Cluj Tribunal passed a total of 100 death sentences, 163 sentences of life imprisonment, and a range of other sentences.\n\nCluj had 16,763 inhabitants of Jewish ancestry in 1941. After the German occupation of Hungary in March 1944, the city's Jews were forced into [[ghetto]]s under conditions of intense overcrowding and practically no facilities. Liquidation of the ghetto occurred through six deportations to [[Auschwitz]] between May and June 1944. Despite facing severe sanctions from the [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy|Horthy]] administration, many Jews escaped across the border to Romania with the assistance of Romanian peasants of neighboring villages. They were then able to flee Europe from the Romanian [[Black Sea]] port of [[Constan\u0163a]]. Other Jews originating from East European{{which|date=February 2014}} countries were helped to escape from Europe by an Anti-Nazi group led by the Jewish Joint and Romanian politicians in Cluj and Bucharest. The leader of this network, between 1943 and 1944, was [[Raoul \u015eorban]].\n\n[[Image:CJROuniexterior.JPG|thumb|left|[[Babe\u015f-Bolyai University]]]]\nAfter World War II, the Romanian university (which had moved to [[Sibiu]] and [[Timi\u0219oara]] in the aftermath of the Second Vienna Award) returned to Cluj and took the name \"Babe\u015f\", after the scientist [[Victor Babe\u015f]]. Parts of the Hungarian university moved to [[Szeged]] and were later named [[University of Szeged]], which became one of the most distinguished universities in Hungary and in Central Europe. The remaining parts formed the Hungarian University of Cluj and took the name \"Bolyai\", after the mathematician [[J\u00e1nos Bolyai]]. The two universities, the Romanian Babe\u015f University and the Hungarian Bolyai University, merged in 1959 forming the [[Babe\u015f-Bolyai University]], with teaching in both Romanian and Hungarian. Nowadays, this is the largest university in Romania.\n\nHungarians remained the majority of the city's population until the 1960s, when for the first time in its long history, Romanians outnumbered Hungarians. According to the 1966 census, the city's population of 185,663 was composed of 56% Romanians and 41% Hungarians. Until 1974 the official Romanian name of the city was Cluj. It was renamed to Cluj-Napoca by the [[Communist Romania|Communist government]] to recognize it as the site of the Roman colony Napoca.\n\n==After the Romanian revolution==\n\nFollowing the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], the nationalist politician [[Gheorghe Funar]] became mayor for 12 years. His tenure was marked by strong Romanian nationalistic and anti-Hungarian ideas. A number of public art projects were undertaken by the city with the aim of highlighting Romanian symbols of the city, most of them regarded by Hungarian ethnics as a way of obscuring the city's Hungarian ancestry. In June 2004 Gheorghe Funar was voted out of office. He was replaced by [[Emil Boc]] of the Democratic Party. The laws on municipal bilingualism have not been applied in administration as the 2002 city census showed less than 20% Hungarians.\n\nIn 1994 and 2000, Cluj-Napoca hosted the [[Central European Olympiad in Informatics]] (CEOI). It thus made Romania not only the first country to have hosted the CEOI, but also the first country to have hosted it a second time.\n\nThe city is known in [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jewish]] history for the founding of the [[Klausenberg (Hasidic dynasty)|Sanz-Klausenburg]] dynasty.<ref>{{cite book| last= Rabinowicz | first = Tzvi M.| title = The Encyclopedia of Hasidism | isbn= 1-56821-123-6 | publisher=Jason Aronson, Inc. | year = 1996}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 Cluj was awarded the \"European Youth Capital\" title.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Napoca (castra)|Clus castra]]\n* [[Prehistory of Transylvania]]\n* [[Ancient history of Transylvania]]\n* [[History of Transylvania]]\n* [[Celts in Transylvania]]\n* [[Dacia]]\n* [[National Museum of Transylvanian History]]\n* [[Timeline of Cluj-Napoca]]\n* [[Coat of arms of Cluj-Napoca]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\na.{{note label|a|a|none}} The engraving, dating back to 1617, was executed by Georg Houfnagel after the painting of Egidius van der Rye (the original was done in the workshop of Braun and Hagenberg).\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{see also|Timeline of Cluj-Napoca#Bibliography}}\n\n=== Ancient ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n|ref            = {{sfnRef|Tabula Peutingeriana}}\n|last           = Anonymous\n|title          = Tabula Peutingeriana\n|url            = http://www.tabula-peutingeriana.de/tp/tpx.html\n|year           = 1\u20134th century AD\n|language       = Latin\n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n=== Modern ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | author=Bennett Julian | title = Trajan: optimus princeps| publisher=Indiana University Press; 2nd edition | year = 2001 | id = {{ISBN|0-253-21435-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-253-21435-5}} }}\n* {{cite book | author=Gheorghe Bodea| title = Clujul vechi \u015fi nou | publisher=ProfImage | year = 2002 | isbn = 973-0-02539-8 }}\n* {{cite book |author1=Gh.

The most important are the following:\n* [[Dacian language|Dacian]] name having the same root \"nap\" (cf. ancient [[Armenian language|Armenian]] root \"nap\") as that of the Dacian river Naparis attested by [[Herodotus]], but with an augmentative suffix uk/ok i.e. over, great<ref>Tomaschek  (1883) 406</ref>\n* Name derived from that of the Dacianized [[Scythian]] tribe known as the Napae<ref>P\u00e2rvan (1982)  p.165 and p.82</ref>\n* Name probably akin to an indigenous ([[Thracian]]) element in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the word n\u0103p\u00e2rc\u0103 'viper' cf. [[Albanian language|Albanian]] nep\u00ebrk\u00eb, nep\u00ebrtk\u00eb<ref>Paliga (2006) 142</ref>\n* Name derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] term ''napos'' ({{lang|grc|\u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2}}), meaning \"timbered valley\"\n* Name derived from the [[Indo-European root]] ''*sn\u0101-p-'' ([[Indogermanisches etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch|Pokorny]] 971-2), \"to flow, to swim, damp\".{{sfn|Luk\u00e1cs|2005|p=14}}\n\nIndependent of these hypotheses, scholars agree that the name of the settlement predates the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Roman conquest]] (AD 106).{{sfn|Luk\u00e1cs|2005|p=14}}\n\n=== Pre-Roman times ===\n\nThe oldest human settlement near [[Cluj]], dating from the [[Neolithic Age]], is at [[Gura Baciului]], near [[Suceagu]], in the valley of a tributary of the [[Nad\u0103\u0219 River (Some\u0219)|Nad\u0103\u0219 river]] and nearby the [[Hoia Forest]]. The settlement dates back to 6000\u20135500 BCE, making it the oldest in [[Transylvania]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Archaeologists have connected it with the [[Star\u010devo\u2013K\u0151r\u00f6s\u2013Cri\u015f culture]], and other similar settlements have been discovered since: a tomb from this same culture in the [[M\u0103n\u0103\u0219tur]] district, and another settlement  on the [[Strada Memorandumului]].\n\nTraces of the [[Thracians|Thracian]]-[[Dacians]] and [[Celts]] suggest that the region was occupied intermittently throughout the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age|Iron]] Ages. As economies centered around cattle-raising developed in the [[Pannonian plain]], the importance of the salt trade with the [[Transylvanian Plain]] became ever more important. Two major routes, one running north\u2013south and the other east\u2013west, met on the right end of a ford under the promontory of a hill, today named Cet\u0103\u021buie. Presumably there was at one time a [[Dacia]]n fortress controlling this central communication point, which would later have been destroyed in the early 18th century construction of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]] fortifications.\n\n=== Roman times ===\n[[File:Napoca Roman fort.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Napoca (castra)|The fort of Roman city]] ]]\n[[File:Milliarum of Aiton, modern copy erected in Turda, Romania in 1993.jpg|thumb|right|''Milliarium of Aiton'', the oldest known epigraphical attestation of Napoca \u2013 a copy erected in June 1993 in front of the [[Turda]] Post Office]]\nThe Romans conquered [[Dacia]] between AD 101 and 106 under [[Trajan]], and a Roman settlement of Napoca is first recorded on a milestone found in 1758 in the nearby [[Aiton, Cluj|Aiton]] commune.<ref name=\"roman\">Lazarovici ''et al.'' 1997, pp. 202\u20133 (6.2 Cluj in the Old and Ancient Epochs)</ref>\n\nThe [[Milliarium of Aiton]] is an ancient Roman milestone (''milliarium'') dating from 108 AD, shortly after the [[Roman conquest of Dacia|conquest]], evidence of the construction of a road from [[Potaissa]] to Napoca.

Although [[Alba Iulia]] served as political capital for the Principality of Siebenb\u00fcrgen (Transylvania), Klausenburg was the main cultural and religious center for the principality. In 1581, [[Stefan Batory]], Governor of Transylvania, took the initiative in founding a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] academy in Klausenburg.\n\nBetween 1545 and 1570, large numbers of [[Germans]] (Saxons) left the city due to the introduction of [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] doctrines. The remaining Germans were assimilated to Hungarians, and the city became a centre for Hungarian nobility and intellectuals. With the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699, Klausenburg became part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].\n\n==Austrian Empire and Grand Principality of Transylvania==\n[[Image:Cluj-Napoca at 1759 (by Janos Szakal).jpg|thumb|The town in 1759]]\nFrom 1790 to 1848 and again from 1861 to 1867, Klausenburg was the capital of the [[Grand Principality of Transylvania]] (Siebenb\u00fcrgen) within the [[Austrian Empire]]; the city was also the seat of the Transylvanian diets. Beginning in 1830, the city became the centre of the Hungarian national movement within the principality. During the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Revolutions of 1848]], Klausenburg was taken and garrisoned in December by Hungarian troops under the command of the [[Poland|Polish]] general [[J\u00f3zef Bem]].\n\nIn 1776, Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] founded a German university in Cluj. But this enterprise was not to survive long, Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] replacing the university with the famous Piarist Highschool, where the teaching was done in Latin. The first Hungarian-language newspaper was published in Klausenburg in 1791, and the first Hungarian theatrical company was established in 1792. In 1798, the city was heavily damaged by a fire.\n\nFor lighting, oil lamps were introduced in 1826, gas lamps in 1861 and electric lights in 1906.<ref>Lazarovici et al. 1997, p.73 (4.1 Centru al mi\u015fc\u0103rii revolu\u0163ionare)</ref>\n\n==Austro-Hungarian Empire==\n[[File:Josephinische Landaufnahme pg083.jpg|right|Cluj-Napoca in the Grand Duchy of Transylvania maps, 1769\u20131773.

During this time, Kolozsvar was among the largest and most important cities of the kingdom, and was the seat of [[Kolozs]] County. In 1897, the Hungarian government decided that only Hungarian place names should be used and therefore prohibited the use of the German or Romanian versions of the city's name in official government documents.<ref name=\"castellan89\">Georges Castellan, ''A history of the Romanians'', [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], 1989, pp.148</ref>\n\nIn 1872, the authorities established a University in Cluj, <!--({{lang-ro|Universitatea din Cluj}}, {{lang-hu|Kolozsv\u00e1ri Tudom\u00e1nyegyetem}})--> with teaching exclusively in Hungarian, which caused discontent amongst the Romanian population. In 1881 the University was renamed ''Franz Joseph University'' after Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]].\n\n==Twentieth century==\n\nAfter [[World War I]], Cluj became part of the [[Kingdom of Romania]], along with the rest of [[Transylvania]]. The Romanian authorities took over the University of Cluj, transforming it into a Romanian institution. On May 12, 1919, the Romanian University of Cluj was set up, with [[Ferdinand I of Romania|King Ferdinand]] proclaiming the University open on February 1, 1920.\n\nIn 1940 Cluj was returned to Hungary through the [[Second Vienna Award]], but Hungarian forces in the city were defeated by the [[Red Army|Soviet]] and [[Romania]]n armies in October 1944. Cluj was restored to Romania by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Treaty of Paris]] in 1947. The [[Romanian People's Tribunals|Northern Transylvania People's Tribunal]] was set up in Cluj by the post-World War II government of Romania, overseen by the [[Allied Commission|Allied Control Commission]], to try suspected war criminals. The Cluj Tribunal passed a total of 100 death sentences, 163 sentences of life imprisonment, and a range of other sentences.\n\nCluj had 16,763 inhabitants of Jewish ancestry in 1941. After the German occupation of Hungary in March 1944, the city's Jews were forced into [[ghetto]]s under conditions of intense overcrowding and practically no facilities. Liquidation of the ghetto occurred through six deportations to [[Auschwitz]] between May and June 1944. Despite facing severe sanctions from the [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy|Horthy]] administration, many Jews escaped across the border to Romania with the assistance of Romanian peasants of neighboring villages. They were then able to flee Europe from the Romanian [[Black Sea]] port of [[Constan\u0163a]]. Other Jews originating from East European{{which|date=February 2014}} countries were helped to escape from Europe by an Anti-Nazi group led by the Jewish Joint and Romanian politicians in Cluj and Bucharest. The leader of this network, between 1943 and 1944, was [[Raoul \u015eorban]].\n\n[[Image:CJROuniexterior.JPG|thumb|left|[[Babe\u015f-Bolyai University]]]]\nAfter World War II, the Romanian university (which had moved to [[Sibiu]] and [[Timi\u015foara]] in the aftermath of the Second Vienna Award) returned to Cluj and took the name \"Babe\u015f\", after the scientist [[Victor Babe\u015f]]. Parts of the Hungarian university moved to [[Szeged]] and were later named [[University of Szeged]], which became one of the most distinguished universities in Hungary and in Central Europe. The remaining parts formed the Hungarian University of Cluj and took the name \"Bolyai\", after the mathematician [[J\u00e1nos Bolyai]]. The two universities, the Romanian Babe\u015f University and the Hungarian Bolyai University, merged in 1959 forming the [[Babe\u015f-Bolyai University]], with teaching in both Romanian and Hungarian. Nowadays, this is the largest university in Romania.\n\nHungarians remained the majority of the city's population until the 1960s, when for the first time in its long history, Romanians outnumbered Hungarians. According to the 1966 census, the city's population of 185,663 was composed of 56% Romanians and 41% Hungarians. Until 1974 the official Romanian name of the city was Cluj. It was renamed to Cluj-Napoca by the [[Communist Romania|Communist government]] to recognize it as the site of the Roman colony Napoca.\n\n==After the Romanian revolution==\n\nFollowing the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], the nationalist politician [[Gheorghe Funar]] became mayor for 12 years. His tenure was marked by strong Romanian nationalistic and anti-Hungarian ideas. A number of public art projects were undertaken by the city with the aim of highlighting Romanian symbols of the city, most of them regarded by Hungarian ethnics as a way of obscuring the city's Hungarian ancestry. In June 2004 Gheorghe Funar was voted out of office. He was replaced by [[Emil Boc]] of the Democratic Party. The laws on municipal bilingualism have not been applied in administration as the 2002 city census showed less than 20% Hungarians.\n\nIn 1994 and 2000, Cluj-Napoca hosted the [[Central European Olympiad in Informatics]] (CEOI). It thus made Romania not only the first country to have hosted the CEOI, but also the first country to have hosted it a second time.\n\nThe city is known in [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jewish]] history for the founding of the [[Klausenberg (Hasidic dynasty)|Sanz-Klausenburg]] dynasty.<ref>{{cite book| last= Rabinowicz | first = Tzvi M.| title = The Encyclopedia of Hasidism | isbn= 1-56821-123-6 | publisher=Jason Aronson, Inc. | year = 1996}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 Cluj was awarded the \"European Youth Capital\" title.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Napoca (castra)|Clus castra]]\n* [[Prehistory of Transylvania]]\n* [[Ancient history of Transylvania]]\n* [[History of Transylvania]]\n* [[Celts in Transylvania]]\n* [[Dacia]]\n* [[National Museum of Transylvanian History]]\n* [[Timeline of Cluj-Napoca]]\n* [[Coat of arms of Cluj-Napoca]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\na.{{note label|a|a|none}} The engraving, dating back to 1617, was executed by Georg Houfnagel after the painting of Egidius van der Rye (the original was done in the workshop of Braun and Hagenberg).\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{see also|Timeline of Cluj-Napoca#Bibliography}}\n\n=== Ancient ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n|ref            = {{sfnRef|Tabula Peutingeriana}}\n|last           = Anonymous\n|title          = Tabula Peutingeriana\n|url            = http://www.tabula-peutingeriana.de/tp/tpx.html\n|year           = 1\u20134th century AD\n|language       = Latin\n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n=== Modern ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | author=Bennett Julian | title = Trajan: optimus princeps| publisher=Indiana University Press; 2nd edition | year = 2001 | id = {{ISBN|0-253-21435-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-253-21435-5}} }}\n* {{cite book | author=Gheorghe Bodea| title = Clujul vechi \u015fi nou | publisher=ProfImage | year = 2002 | isbn = 973-0-02539-8 }}\n* {{cite book |author1=Gh.

{"title_page": "International psychology", "text_new": "'''International''' or '''global psychology''' is an emerging branch of [[psychology]] that focuses on the worldwide enterprise of psychology in terms of communication and networking, cross-cultural comparison, [[scholarship]], practice, and pedagogy (Stevens & Gielen, 2007). Often, the terms international psychology, global psychology, [[Psychology#W.E.I.R.D. Psychological Research, Global Practice, and Transnational Psychology|transnational psychology]], and cross-cultural psychology are used interchangeably, but their purposes are subtly and importantly different: Global means worldwide, international means across and between nations, transnational means to transcend the nation-state, cross-cultural means across cultures. In contrast, the term \u201cmulticultural\u201d is more often used to refer to ethnic and other [[Cultural identity|cultural differences]] existing within a given nation rather than to global or international comparisons.\n\n== Definitions and scope==\n'''International psychology''' is concerned with the emergence and practice of psychology in different parts of the [[world]] (Stevens & Gielen, 2007). It advocates committed involvement in worldwide and regional psychology and policy-making organizations such as the [[International Union of Psychological Science]] (IUPsyS includes 87 national psychology associations and more than 20 international/regional associations), the International Association of [[Applied psychology|Applied Psychology]] (IAAP), the International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology (IACCP), the [[icpweb.org|International Council of Psychologists]] (ICP), the European Federation of Psychologists\u2019 Associations (EFPA: it includes 36 national psychology associations), the Sociedad Interamericana de Psicolog\u00eda (SIP), the recently founded Pan-African Psychological Union (PAPU), and others. In addition, there exist more than 100 international psychology organizations each focusing on a specific subdiscipline. The goal is to establish psychology as a global discipline that in its theories, research practices, applications, and ethical aspirations is focused on the psychological study of humanity as a whole while avoiding as much as possible ethnocentric biases and preoccupations (McCormick & Constantable, 2015; Stevens & Wedding, 2004). For an annotated bibliography on international psychology that covers 156 publications, see Takooshian, Gielen, Rich, and Velayo (2016).\n\nIn contrast, the term '''global psychology''' is more frequently used to refer to the worldwide investigation of global issues and phenomena from a  psychological and psychocultural point of view. Examples include the investigation of subjective well being, identification and treatment of [[mental health]] problems, the psychological dimensions of family systems, [[gender role]]s and gender-typed behavior, [[childrearing]] practices, cognitive and emotional functioning, international attitudes, [[value system]]s, intergroup conflicts, threats to the natural environment, societal transformation and national development, the struggles of disempowered groups (such as women, children, immigrants, and refugees) as seen in a global perspective (Stevens & Gielen, 2007).\n\n'''Cross-cultural psychology''' may be defined as the relativistic study of behavior and mental processes in different cultures,<ref name=\"McHugh2007\">{{cite book | last = McHugh | first1 = N.

An example would be the investigation of child-rearing practices and their psychological consequences between distinctly different groups.  Cultural psychology focuses on the relationship between psychology and culture (such as language, traditions, predominant values, and socialization practices) within a culture and how it affects individual human functioning. Both cultural and cross-cultural psychology constitute important elements of global psychology. Cross-cultural psychology emerged during the 1960s-1970s as a separate [[Science|field of study]] with a definite identity; it is thus older than the more general field of international psychology, which is only now emerging as a distinct discipline.\n\n[[The Oxford English Dictionary]] (1993) defines global as, \u201c\u2026pertaining to or involving the world, worldwide\u201d (p.&nbsp;1101) and international as, \u201cExisting, occurring, or carried on between nations\u2026Agreed on by many nations; used by, or able to be used by (the people of) many nations\u201d (p.&nbsp;1397). At present the term international psychology is in wider use although Stevens and Gielen (2007) prefer the term global psychology, to underline the increasingly global nature of psychological phenomena and problems together with their [[Scientific method|scientific investigation]] and efforts to ameliorate them. More generally, the emergence and intensification of an international psychology movement is part and parcel of the broader process of globalization in the scientific, economic, technological, sociocultural, political and ecological spheres. It reflects and makes use of the increasingly global flow of information, ideas, and peoples. In addition, globalization in psychology has led to the ''de facto'' use of English as the predominant means of communication so that academics in many parts of the world are now expected to read and publish in English-language journals.\n\nKurtis, Adams, Grabe, and Else-Quest have proposed a '''transnational psychology''' in order to counter the Western bias in the field of psychology. Transnational psychology applies transnational feminist lenses, developed through interdisciplinary work in postcolonial and feminist studies, to the field of psychology to study, understand, and address the impact of colonization, imperialism, and globalization. This approach uses a context-sensitive cultural psychology lens to reconsider, de-naturalize, and de-universalize psychological science. Kurtis and Adams suggested that people in the non-Western, \"Majority World\" (areas where the majority of the world's population lives), should be viewed as resources for revising traditional psychological science.<ref name=\"KurtisAdams2015\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Kurtis | first1 = T. | last2 = Adams | first2 = G. | title = Decolonizing liberation: Toward a transnational feminist psychology | journal = Journal of Social and Political Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 388\u2013413 | doi = 10.5964/jspp.v3i1.326 | jstor = 3178747 | date = 2015 | ref = | url = https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/1808/21823/1/AdamsG_2015.pdf }}</ref> In addition, Bhatia believes that a '''transnational cultural psychology''' is needed examine the psychology of diasporas, who are impacted by globalization and consequently have many \u201chomes,\u201d languages, and selves.<ref name=\"Bhatia2010\">{{Cite journal | last = Bhatia | first = S. | title = Theorizing indigenous psychology | journal = Theory & Psychology | volume = 20 | pages = 137\u2013140 | doi = 10.1177/0959354309345640| jstor = | date = 2010 | ref = }}</ref><ref name=\"Transnational Psychology\">{{cite book | last1 = Collins | first1 = L.

Psychological Research, Global Practice, and Transnational Psychology|transnational psychology]] is concerned with uncovering the particularities of the psychology of groups without regard to nation-state boundaries and is opposed to universalization. Because American psychologists dominated the field of psychology especially in the decades after World War II, they frequently ignored contributions from other parts of the world and claimed, whether explicitly or implicitly, that their theories, concepts, ethical standards, and empirical findings applied to all\u2014or at least most\u2014people around the world. In addition, because they largely ignored books and journals not written in English, American psychology became a largely monocultural and monolinguistic discipline (Draguns, 2001). Consequently, it is a key goal of internationally oriented psychologists both in the US and elsewhere to turn psychology into a more universally and less culturally biased discipline that contributes to human welfare everywhere while strengthening \"world consciouness\" rather than ethnocentric and potentially violent forms of nationalism or extremist religious preoccupations (Leong, Pickren, Leach, & Marsella, 2012). Practical advice about how best to internationalize the teaching of psychology can be found in the handbooks of Rich, Gielen, and Takooshian (2017) and Keith (2018).\n\n== Foci ==\nMajor foci of international psychology include:\n\n* The worldwide study of psychological processes and phenomena (e.g., Gielen, 2016; Hofstede, 2001).\n* Macro-level interventions and policy making, for example, international efforts to reduce [[HIV|HIV infections]] based on psychological research (Wessells & Dawes, 2007), to assess and reduce ethnic conflicts (Landis & Albert, 2013), and to further global mental health (Patel, Minas, Cohen, & Prince, 2014).\n* Micro-level interventions, for example, counseling and psychotherapy, [[school psychology]], and interventions in organizations (e.g., Aycan, Kanungo, & Mendon\u00e7a, 2014; Moodley, Gielen, & Wu, 2013; Pedersen, Lonner, Draguns, & Trimble, 2015).\n* International networking and international psychology organizations and conferences, such as IUPsyS, IAAP, IACCP, EFPA, SIP, APA\u2019s Division 52 \u2013 International Psychology, APA's Office of International Affairs, and the [[Institute for International and Cross-Cultural Psychology]] (IICCP) (Merenda, 1995).\n* Supporting efforts to internationalize psychology education by infusing global, international, and cultural perspectives into the curriculum, providing international and cross-cultural training experiences, increasing international faculty and student exchange, and forming collaborative research programs (Heine, 2016; Leong et al., 2012; McCarthy, Dickson, Cranney, Trapp, & Karandashev, 2012; Rich & Gielen, 2015; Rich, Gielen, & Takooshian, 2017; Takooshian, Gielen, Plous, Rich, & Velayo, 2016). \n* Rewriting the [[history of psychology]] from a global and less ethnocentric point of view, together with corresponding changes in the curriculum (Baker, 2012; Brock, 2007; Leong et al., 2012; Rich & Gielen, 2015; Takooshian, Gielen, Plous, Rich, & Velayo, 2016).\n* Establishing shared training standards, professional regulations, and codes of [[ethics]] (Pettifor, 2007; Leach, Stevens, Lindsay, Ferrero, & Korkut, 2012), such as the Universal Declaration of Ethical Principles for Psychologists (2008), which has been adopted by the IUPsyS and its 87 national member organizations (Leach, Stevens, Lindsay, Ferrero, & Korkut, 2012).\n* Representing psychology at the United Nations especially in the context of non-governmental organizations (NGO's). An important step in this regard was taken in 2012, when The Psychology of NGOs Accredited at the United Nations (PCUN) was established by a group of psychology-based NGOs. These NGOs advocate for the inclusion of psychological perspectives, research, and practice, for instance when formulating and implementing the UN's [[Sustainable Development Goals]].\n*Based in part on the advocacy of psychologists such as Judy Kuriansky, Chair of the Psychology Coalition of NGOs at the United Nations, mental health and well-being have for the first time been included in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Supported by the World Bank Group and the World Health Organization (2016), mental health specialists are now succeeding in moving mental health issues from the periphery closer to the center of worldwide efforts to improve global health.\n\n==History==\n\nModern scientific psychology had an international dimension from its beginnings in the late 19th century. [[Wilhelm Wundt]] (1832-1920), for instance, the father of modern experimental psychology, supervised approximately 190 doctoral students from at least 10 countries. Similarly, the First International Congress of Physiological Psychology in 1889, in [[Paris]], included more than 200   participants from 20 countries (Sabourin & Cooper, 2014). Although psychology developed first in [[Europe]], it soon began to prosper in the [[United States]] as well. Altogether, modern scientific psychology remained a predominantly western enterprise till well after [[World War II]] although modern psychology was already present in the early 1900s in some nonwestern countries such as India, Japan, and Mexico. During the 1930s many prominent psychologists from Germany and Austria emigrated to the United States. As a result of these developments, psychology in the United States assumed worldwide leadership, but also grew increasingly monocultural, monolingual, and ethnocentric in character (see David and Buchanan, 2003, and Bullock, 2012, for timelines of important events in the history of international psychology). However, there is now an increased awareness among U.S. psychologists that U.S. psychology must take into account global developments in order to fully represent the world of psychology. For instance, the [[American Psychological Association]] established in 1997 an International Psychology Division (Division 52), which currently has about 600 members.\n\nDuring the last three to four decades, especially, psychology has expanded worldwide and assumed a global presence. Stevens and Gielen (2007) and some others have estimated that there are over one million psychologists.  This estimate is based on local definitions of what it means to be a professional psychologist: in most countries the prerequisite is a [[Master's degree]] or Diploma in psychology, whereas in others (e.g., Brazil) a professionally oriented [[Bachelor\u2019s degree]] that incorporates a period of supervised practice enables one to gain admission to a licensing examination. The global estimate includes well over 320,000 psychologists in Europe, at least 250,000 in Latin America, and 225,000 in the United States. The country with the highest density of psychologists is Argentina. In addition, psychology has gained ground in East and [[Southeast Asia]] and is increasingly visible in [[Majority Muslim countries|Muslim countries]] such as [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Iran]], and [[Lebanon]] (Ahmed & Gielen, 1998; Baker, 2012; Stevens & Wedding, 2004). In [[sub-Saharan Africa]], psychology is well developed in [[South Africa]], but less present though expanding in the other regions.  For more detailed information, see the edited volume by Stevens and Wedding (2004) which  includes analyses of the status of psychology in 27 [[countries]] located on all inhabited [[continents]]. The handbook by Baker (2012) reviews the respective histories of psychology in 27 countries and regions around the world while the volume by Rich and Gielen (2015) focuses on 17 past and present pathfinders in the realm of international psychology. The contributions respectively to Moodley, Gielen, and Wu (2013) and Gerstein et al. (2009) analyze the status of counseling psychology and psychotherapy in numerous countries.\n\nIn general, psychology as a discipline has prospered in well-to-do, urbanized, and individualistic countries and cultures but it is frequently considered an unnecessary luxury in the poorer and more rural regions of the world where the treatment of physical health problems by modern healthcare workers and indigenous healers is likely to take precedence over the identification and treatment of [[mental health]] problems (Leung & Zhang, 1995; O'Gorman, Shum, Halford, & Ogilvie, 2012). Such problems are frequently treated by indigenous healers who tend to rely on supernatural explanations for their identification and treatment. However, a global mental health movement that has been strongly influenced by psychiatrists is gathering steam. This makes it likely that in the future, greater resources will be allocated to mental health problems especially in medium-income countries (Patel et al., 2014). Countries where psychology is both influential and especially well developed include The Netherlands, Switzerland, Israel, Germany, USA, United Kingdom, Australia, Indonesia, Austria, the Scandinavian countries, and Argentina (especially psychoanalysis).\n\n== Trends ==\n\nPerhaps the best measure of trends within international psychology is within its organizations, through new membership, conference topics, and cooperative research across borders. For example, the International Union of [[Psychological science|Psychological Science]] (IUPsyS) has seen an increase of new member countries from [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Eastern Europe]], and [[Latin America]] in the past 15 years; membership in such organizations represents a desire and need in these countries for networking, training, accreditation, expansion of scientific research, and international recognition (Stevens & Gielen, 2007). Correspondingly, international psychology conferences are now increasingly taking place in both Western and non-Western countries. IUPSyS's quadrennial International Congresses of Psychology (ICP), for instance, have been and will be taking place in Beijing (2004), Berlin (2008), Cape Town (2012), Yokohama (2016), and Prague (2020). Similarly, the quadrennial Congresses of Applied Psychology offered by IAAP, the largest international psychology organization for individual members, have taken or will take place around the globe in cities such as San Francisco (1998), Singapore (2002), Athens (2006), Melbourne (2010), Paris (2014), and Montreal (2018).\n\nTrends in global psychology point to the sustained growth, specialization, and feminization of psychology, and the emergence of contextually sensitive paradigms.\n\nThe number of psychologists, psychology students, and psychology programs worldwide continues to grow steadily, proving that one of the goals of globalization is being met.  However, much work still needs to be done to bring psychology to underdeveloped areas, and to increase the resources and development of the field in countries where it has already taken hold (Adair & Ka\u011fit\u00e7iba\u015fi, 1995; Stevens & Wedding, 2004).\n\nSpecialization is a growing trend, with each nation focusing specializations on its own needs and goals. Also, communication within these specializations is being facilitated through the [[World Wide Web]] and the emergence and growth of specialized [[international organization]]s and journals in subfields of psychology. Although access to the Internet is frequently still limited in [[Developing country|low-income countries]], it has nevertheless improved considerably in recent years thus facilitating the exchange of scientific and professional information as well as research data. The ''Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology'', for instance, is increasingly publishing papers by large teams of international psychologists that compare psychological phenomena across numerous countries located on all inhabited continents. Moreover, high impact psychological journals published in North America and Europe have broadened their scope by increasingly accepting articles by international and non-Western authors including those residing in East Asian countries.\n\nFeminization in psychology is another trend, as women are beginning to dominate the field in Europe, Latin America, Canada, the United States, and parts of Asia. A trend within this trend is the continued dominance of male psychologists within business and academia, whereas women tend to work more frequently in school, counseling, and clinical settings.\n\nFinally, with the globalization of psychology comes the demand for more culturally sensitive paradigms (Heine, 2016). Traditionally, psychology was taught in the Western context, reflecting the norms, values, and data of those particular regions. Increasing awareness that this psychology does not sufficiently address culturally specific as well as global issues and therefore does not fully apply to some cultures has led to the call for indigenous psychologies, or at least an alternative psychology to the mainstream, reductionistic paradigm which may be applied to most, if not all, cultures (Kim, Yang, & Hwang, 2006). Prominent centers of [[indigenous psychology]] include Mexico, the Philippines, [[South Korea]], and Taiwan. Moreover, the increasing inclusion of globally collected data of psychological relevance is gradually undermining the traditionally ethnocentric nature of psychology as taught in the United States and elsewhere in the West (e.g., Hofstede, 2001). Theoretically, indigenous psychologists emphasizing culturally sensitive paradigms tend to see themselves as cultural rather than as cross-cultural psychologists. Moreover, global psychology profits from an emphasis on interdisciplinary cooperation with experts from fields such as cultural and psychological anthropology, sociology, behavioral economics, and political science. This holds true because behavior patterns are generally  influenced by a broad array of forces that may vary from society to society.\n\n== Professional regulations and ethical standards ==\n\nMany countries around the world have professional regulations for the practice of psychology. \u201cWith some exceptions, the existence of professional regulation reflects the level of development of professional psychology in that country. A profession needs to establish an identity and credibility before there is something to be regulated\u201d (Pettifor, 2007, p.&nbsp;312). In the 36 European countries represented in EFPA, a major effort is underway to unify the basic academic curriculum as well as other requirements underlying the training and certification of psychologists. These countries have established specific yet wide-ranging guidelines for a European [[Diploma]] in Psychology comparable to a Master\u2019s level [[Higher education|university education]] of six years duration that includes supervised practice. The diploma will enable psychologists trained in one country to practice in other European countries and is likely to influence the education and practice of psychologists in other parts of the world as well.\n\nCountries that currently have limited or no regulation of the profession include [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Japan]], [[Kenya]], [[Kuwait]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]] and [[Turkey]]. Several of these countries are working toward licensing legislation, and several have developed ethical standards of practice to guide.\nMany national psychology associations have adopted a [[Ethical code|code of ethics]] such as, for instance, APA\u2019s Ethical Principles of Psychologists and [[Code of Conduct]]. EFPA has adopted several codes of ethics in recent years, and the five [[Nordic countries]] (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) adopted a unified code of ethics in 1988, which they revised in 1998 to be more consistent with EFPA\u2019s meta-code (Pettifor, 2007). Moreover, IUPsyS and IAAP adopted, in 2008, a Universal Declaration of Ethical Principles for Psychologists. Such codes and declarations tend to be aspirational in nature.\n\n== Conclusion ==\n\nThe scope of scientific psychology and its practice have expanded enormously from its early beginnings in the 19th century to today. This holds true for all post-industrial countries and increasingly for some modernizing nations such as Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, and Turkey. In contrast, psychology remains much less visible in the poorer countries and especially so in their rural areas. The expansion of psychology into the nonwestern world has led to an increasing awareness of the role of cultural factors in psychological functioning together with repeated calls to \u201cindigenize\u201d psychology (Kim, Yang, & Hwang, 2006). International contacts among psychologists as well as joint research and applied projects across national and geographic boundaries have prospered thanks to the rapidly evolving technologies of transportation and  [[Telecommunication|electronic communication]]. Consequently, one may safely predict that the cross-cultural, global, and international dimensions of psychology will become more prominent in the foreseeable future.\n\n== Representative journals and newsletters ==\n* Applied Psychology: An International Journal (IAAP)\n* Asian Journal of [[Social psychology|Social Psychology]] (Asian Association of Social Psychology/Japanese [[Group dynamics|Group Dynamics]] Association)\n* [[European Psychologist]] (EFPA)\n* International Journal of Psychology (IUPsyS)\n* International Perspectives in Psychology: Research, Practice, Consultation (APA Division 52)\n* International Psychologist (ICP)\n* International Psychology Bulletin (APA Division 52)\n* Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology (IACCP)\n* Psychology International [http://www.apa.org/pi www.apa.org/pi]\n* Revista Interamericana de Psicolog\u00eda/Interamerican Journal of Psychology (SIP)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Additional References and Further Reading ==\n*{{cite journal |last=Adair |first=J.

Often, the terms international psychology, global psychology, [[Psychology#W.E.I.R.D. Psychological Research, Global Practice, and Transnational Psychology|transnational psychology]], and cross-cultural psychology are used interchangeably, but their purposes are subtly and importantly different: Global means worldwide, international means across and between nations, transnational means to transcend the nation-state, cross-cultural means across cultures. In contrast, the term \u201cmulticultural\u201d is more often used to refer to ethnic and other [[Cultural identity|cultural differences]] existing within a given nation rather than to global or international comparisons.\n\n== Definitions and scope==\n'''International psychology''' is concerned with the emergence and practice of psychology in different parts of the [[world]] (Stevens & Gielen, 2007). It advocates committed involvement in worldwide and regional psychology and policy-making organizations such as the [[International Union of Psychological Science]] (IUPsyS includes 87 national psychology associations and more than 20 international/regional associations), the International Association of [[Applied psychology|Applied Psychology]] (IAAP), the International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology (IACCP), the [[icpweb.org|International Council of Psychologists]] (ICP), the European Federation of Psychologists\u2019 Associations (EFPA: it includes 36 national psychology associations), the Sociedad Interamericana de Psicolog\u00eda (SIP), the recently founded Pan-African Psychological Union (PAPU), and others. In addition, there exist more than 100 international psychology organizations each focusing on a specific subdiscipline. The goal is to establish psychology as a global discipline that in its theories, research practices, applications, and ethical aspirations is focused on the psychological study of humanity as a whole while avoiding as much as possible ethnocentric biases and preoccupations (McCormick & Constantable, 2015; Stevens & Wedding, 2004). For an annotated bibliography on international psychology that covers 156 publications, see Takooshian, Gielen, Rich, and Velayo (2016).\n\nIn contrast, the term '''global psychology''' is more frequently used to refer to the worldwide investigation of global issues and phenomena from a  psychological and psychocultural point of view. Examples include the investigation of subjective well being, identification and treatment of [[mental health]] problems, the psychological dimensions of family systems, [[gender role]]s and gender-typed behavior, [[childrearing]] practices, cognitive and emotional functioning, international attitudes, [[value system]]s, intergroup conflicts, threats to the natural environment, societal transformation and national development, the struggles of disempowered groups (such as women, children, immigrants, and refugees) as seen in a global perspective (Stevens & Gielen, 2007).\n\n'''Cross-cultural psychology''' may be defined as the relativistic study of behavior and mental processes in different cultures,<ref name=\"McHugh2007\">{{cite book | last = McHugh | first1 = N.

An example would be the investigation of child-rearing practices and their psychological consequences between distinctly different groups.  Cultural psychology focuses on the relationship between psychology and culture (such as language, traditions, predominant values, and socialization practices) within a culture and how it affects individual human functioning. Both cultural and cross-cultural psychology constitute important elements of global psychology. Cross-cultural psychology emerged during the 1960s-1970s as a separate [[Science|field of study]] with a definite identity; it is thus older than the more general field of international psychology, which is only now emerging as a distinct discipline.\n\n[[The Oxford English Dictionary]] (1993) defines global as, \u201c\u2026pertaining to or involving the world, worldwide\u201d (p.&nbsp;1101) and international as, \u201cExisting, occurring, or carried on between nations\u2026Agreed on by many nations; used by, or able to be used by (the people of) many nations\u201d (p.&nbsp;1397). At present the term international psychology is in wider use although Stevens and Gielen (2007) prefer the term global psychology, to underline the increasingly global nature of psychological phenomena and problems together with their [[Scientific method|scientific investigation]] and efforts to ameliorate them. More generally, the emergence and intensification of an international psychology movement is part and parcel of the broader process of globalization in the scientific, economic, technological, sociocultural, political and ecological spheres. It reflects and makes use of the increasingly global flow of information, ideas, and peoples. In addition, globalization in psychology has led to the ''de facto'' use of English as the predominant means of communication so that academics in many parts of the world are now expected to read and publish in English-language journals.\n\nKurtis, Adams, Grabe, and Else-Quest have proposed a '''transnational psychology''' in order to counter the Western bias in the field of psychology. Transnational psychology applies transnational feminist lenses, developed through interdisciplinary work in postcolonial and feminist studies, to the field of psychology to study, understand, and address the impact of colonization, imperialism, and globalization. This approach uses a context-sensitive cultural psychology lens to reconsider, de-naturalize, and de-universalize psychological science. Kurtis and Adams suggested that people in the non-Western, \"Majority World\" (areas where the majority of the world's population lives), should be viewed as resources for revising traditional psychological science.<ref name=\"KurtisAdams2015\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Kurtis | first1 = T. | last2 = Adams | first2 = G. | title = Decolonizing liberation: Toward a transnational feminist psychology | journal = Journal of Social and Political Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 388\u2013413 | doi = 10.5964/jspp.v3i1.326 | jstor = 3178747 | date = 2015 | ref = | url = https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/1808/21823/1/AdamsG_2015.pdf }}</ref> In addition, Bhatia believes that a '''transnational cultural psychology''' is needed examine the psychology of diasporas, who are impacted by globalization and consequently have many \u201chomes,\u201d languages, and selves.<ref name=\"Bhatia2010\">{{Cite journal | last = Bhatia | first = S. | title = Theorizing indigenous psychology | journal = Theory & Psychology | volume = 20 | pages = 137\u2013140 | doi = 10.1177/0959354309345640| jstor = | date = 2010 | ref = }}</ref><ref name=\"Transnational Psychology\">{{cite book | last1 = Collins | first1 = L.

Psychological Research, Global Practice, and Transnational Psychology|transnational psychology]] is concerned with uncovering the particularities of the psychology of groups without regard to nation-state boundaries and is opposed to universalization. Because American psychologists dominated the field of psychology especially in the decades after World War II, they frequently ignored contributions from other parts of the world and claimed, whether explicitly or implicitly, that their theories, concepts, ethical standards, and empirical findings applied to all\u2014or at least most\u2014people around the world. In addition, because they largely ignored books and journals not written in English, American psychology became a largely monocultural and monolinguistic discipline (Draguns, 2001). Consequently, it is a key goal of internationally oriented psychologists both in the US and elsewhere to turn psychology into a more universally and less culturally biased discipline that contributes to human welfare everywhere while strengthening \"world consciouness\" rather than ethnocentric and potentially violent forms of nationalism or extremist religious preoccupations (Leong, Pickren, Leach, & Marsella, 2012). Practical advice about how best to internationalize the teaching of psychology can be found in the handbooks of Rich, Gielen, and Takooshian (2017) and Keith (2018).\n\n== Foci ==\nMajor foci of international psychology include:\n\n* The worldwide study of psychological processes and phenomena (e.g., Gielen, 2016; Hofstede, 2001).\n* Macro-level interventions and policy making, for example, international efforts to reduce [[HIV|HIV infections]] based on psychological research (Wessells & Dawes, 2007), to assess and reduce ethnic conflicts (Landis & Albert, 2013), and to further global mental health (Patel, Minas, Cohen, & Prince, 2014).\n* Micro-level interventions, for example, counseling and psychotherapy, [[school psychology]], and interventions in organizations (e.g., Aycan, Kanungo, & Mendon\u00e7a, 2014; Moodley, Gielen, & Wu, 2013; Pedersen, Lonner, Draguns, & Trimble, 2015).\n* International networking and international psychology organizations and conferences, such as IUPsyS, IAAP, IACCP, EFPA, SIP, APA\u2019s Division 52 \u2013 International Psychology, APA's Office of International Affairs, and the [[Institute for International and Cross-Cultural Psychology]] (IICCP) (Merenda, 1995).\n* Supporting efforts to internationalize psychology education by infusing global, international, and cultural perspectives into the curriculum, providing international and cross-cultural training experiences, increasing international faculty and student exchange, and forming collaborative research programs (Heine, 2016; Leong et al., 2012; McCarthy, Dickson, Cranney, Trapp, & Karandashev, 2012; Rich & Gielen, 2015; Rich, Gielen, & Takooshian, 2017; Takooshian, Gielen, Plous, Rich, & Velayo, 2016). \n* Rewriting the [[history of psychology]] from a global and less ethnocentric point of view, together with corresponding changes in the curriculum (Baker, 2012; Brock, 2007; Leong et al., 2012; Rich & Gielen, 2015; Takooshian, Gielen, Plous, Rich, & Velayo, 2016).\n* Establishing shared training standards, professional regulations, and codes of [[ethics]] (Pettifor, 2007; Leach, Stevens, Lindsay, Ferrero, & Korkut, 2012), such as the Universal Declaration of Ethical Principles for Psychologists (2008), which has been adopted by the IUPsyS and its 87 national member organizations (Leach, Stevens, Lindsay, Ferrero, & Korkut, 2012).\n* Representing psychology at the United Nations especially in the context of non-governmental organizations (NGO's). An important step in this regard was taken in 2012, when The Psychology of NGOs Accredited at the United Nations (PCUN) was established by a group of psychology-based NGOs. These NGOs advocate for the inclusion of psychological perspectives, research, and practice, for instance when formulating and implementing the UN's [[Sustainable Development Goals]].\n*Based in part on the advocacy of psychologists such as Judy Kuriansky, Chair of the Psychology Coalition of NGOs at the United Nations, mental health and well-being have for the first time been included in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Supported by the World Bank Group and the World Health Organization (2016), mental health specialists are now succeeding in moving mental health issues from the periphery closer to the center of worldwide efforts to improve global health.\n\n==History==\n\nModern scientific psychology had an international dimension from its beginnings in the late 19th century. [[Wilhelm Wundt]] (1832-1920), for instance, the father of modern experimental psychology, supervised approximately 190 doctoral students from at least 10 countries. Similarly, the First International Congress of Physiological Psychology in 1889, in [[Paris]], included more than 200   participants from 20 countries (Sabourin & Cooper, 2014). Although psychology developed first in [[Europe]], it soon began to prosper in the [[United States]] as well. Altogether, modern scientific psychology remained a predominantly western enterprise till well after [[World War II]] although modern psychology was already present in the early 1900s in some nonwestern countries such as India, Japan, and Mexico. During the 1930s many prominent psychologists from Germany and Austria emigrated to the United States. As a result of these developments, psychology in the United States assumed worldwide leadership, but also grew increasingly monocultural, monolingual, and ethnocentric in character (see David and Buchanan, 2003, and Bullock, 2012, for timelines of important events in the history of international psychology). However, there is now an increased awareness among U.S. psychologists that U.S. psychology must take into account global developments in order to fully represent the world of psychology. For instance, the [[American Psychological Association]] established in 1997 an International Psychology Division (Division 52), which currently has about 600 members.\n\nDuring the last three to four decades, especially, psychology has expanded worldwide and assumed a global presence. Stevens and Gielen (2007) and some others have estimated that there are over one million psychologists.  This estimate is based on local definitions of what it means to be a professional psychologist: in most countries the prerequisite is a [[Master's degree]] or Diploma in psychology, whereas in others (e.g., Brazil) a professionally oriented [[Bachelor\u2019s degree]] that incorporates a period of supervised practice enables one to gain admission to a licensing examination. The global estimate includes well over 320,000 psychologists in Europe, at least 250,000 in Latin America, and 225,000 in the United States. The country with the highest density of psychologists is Argentina. In addition, psychology has gained ground in East and [[Southeast Asia]] and is increasingly visible in [[Majority Muslim countries|Muslim countries]] such as [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Iran]], and [[Lebanon]] (Ahmed & Gielen, 1998; Baker, 2012; Stevens & Wedding, 2004). In [[sub-Saharan Africa]], psychology is well developed in [[South Africa]], but less present though expanding in the other regions.  For more detailed information, see the edited volume by Stevens and Wedding (2004) which  includes analyses of the status of psychology in 27 [[countries]] located on all inhabited [[continents]]. The handbook by Baker (2012) reviews the respective histories of psychology in 27 countries and regions around the world while the volume by Rich and Gielen (2015) focuses on 17 past and present pathfinders in the realm of international psychology. The contributions respectively to Moodley, Gielen, and Wu (2013) and Gerstein et al. (2009) analyze the status of counseling psychology and psychotherapy in numerous countries.\n\nIn general, psychology as a discipline has prospered in well-to-do, urbanized, and individualistic countries and cultures but it is frequently considered an unnecessary luxury in the poorer and more rural regions of the world where the treatment of physical health problems by modern healthcare workers and indigenous healers is likely to take precedence over the identification and treatment of [[mental health]] problems (Leung & Zhang, 1995; O'Gorman, Shum, Halford, & Ogilvie, 2012). Such problems are frequently treated by indigenous healers who tend to rely on supernatural explanations for their identification and treatment. However, a global mental health movement that has been strongly influenced by psychiatrists is gathering steam. This makes it likely that in the future, greater resources will be allocated to mental health problems especially in medium-income countries (Patel et al., 2014). Countries where psychology is both influential and especially well developed include The Netherlands, Switzerland, Israel, Germany, USA, United Kingdom, Australia, Indonesia, Austria, the Scandinavian countries, and Argentina (especially psychoanalysis).\n\n== Trends ==\n\nPerhaps the best measure of trends within international psychology is within its organizations, through new membership, conference topics, and cooperative research across borders. For example, the International Union of [[Psychological science|Psychological Science]] (IUPsyS) has seen an increase of new member countries from [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Eastern Europe]], and [[Latin America]] in the past 15 years; membership in such organizations represents a desire and need in these countries for networking, training, accreditation, expansion of scientific research, and international recognition (Stevens & Gielen, 2007). Correspondingly, international psychology conferences are now increasingly taking place in both Western and non-Western countries. IUPSyS's quadrennial International Congresses of Psychology (ICP), for instance, have been and will be taking place in Beijing (2004), Berlin (2008), Cape Town (2012), Yokohama (2016), and Prague (2020). Similarly, the quadrennial Congresses of Applied Psychology offered by IAAP, the largest international psychology organization for individual members, have taken or will take place around the globe in cities such as San Francisco (1998), Singapore (2002), Athens (2006), Melbourne (2010), Paris (2014), and Montreal (2018).\n\nTrends in global psychology point to the sustained growth, specialization, and feminization of psychology, and the emergence of contextually sensitive paradigms.\n\nThe number of psychologists, psychology students, and psychology programs worldwide continues to grow steadily, proving that one of the goals of globalization is being met.  However, much work still needs to be done to bring psychology to underdeveloped areas, and to increase the resources and development of the field in countries where it has already taken hold (Adair & Ka\u011fit\u00e7iba\u015fi, 1995; Stevens & Wedding, 2004).\n\nSpecialization is a growing trend, with each nation focusing specializations on its own needs and goals. Also, communication within these specializations is being facilitated through the [[World Wide Web]] and the emergence and growth of specialized [[international organization]]s and journals in subfields of psychology. Although access to the Internet is frequently still limited in [[Developing country|low-income countries]], it has nevertheless improved considerably in recent years thus facilitating the exchange of scientific and professional information as well as research data. The ''Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology'', for instance, is increasingly publishing papers by large teams of international psychologists that compare psychological phenomena across numerous countries located on all inhabited continents. Moreover, high impact psychological journals published in North America and Europe have broadened their scope by increasingly accepting articles by international and non-Western authors including those residing in East Asian countries.\n\nFeminization in psychology is another trend, as women are beginning to dominate the field in Europe, Latin America, Canada, the United States, and parts of Asia. A trend within this trend is the continued dominance of male psychologists within business and academia, whereas women tend to work more frequently in school, counseling, and clinical settings.\n\nFinally, with the globalization of psychology comes the demand for more culturally sensitive paradigms (Heine, 2016). Traditionally, psychology was taught in the Western context, reflecting the norms, values, and data of those particular regions. Increasing awareness that this psychology does not sufficiently address culturally specific as well as global issues and therefore does not fully apply to some cultures has led to the call for indigenous psychologies, or at least an alternative psychology to the mainstream, reductionistic paradigm which may be applied to most, if not all, cultures (Kim, Yang, & Hwang, 2006). Prominent centers of [[indigenous psychology]] include Mexico, the Philippines, [[South Korea]], and Taiwan. Moreover, the increasing inclusion of globally collected data of psychological relevance is gradually undermining the traditionally ethnocentric nature of psychology as taught in the United States and elsewhere in the West (e.g., Hofstede, 2001). Theoretically, indigenous psychologists emphasizing culturally sensitive paradigms tend to see themselves as cultural rather than as cross-cultural psychologists. Moreover, global psychology profits from an emphasis on interdisciplinary cooperation with experts from fields such as cultural and psychological anthropology, sociology, behavioral economics, and political science. This holds true because behavior patterns are generally  influenced by a broad array of forces that may vary from society to society.\n\n== Professional regulations and ethical standards ==\n\nMany countries around the world have professional regulations for the practice of psychology. \u201cWith some exceptions, the existence of professional regulation reflects the level of development of professional psychology in that country. A profession needs to establish an identity and credibility before there is something to be regulated\u201d (Pettifor, 2007, p.&nbsp;312). In the 36 European countries represented in EFPA, a major effort is underway to unify the basic academic curriculum as well as other requirements underlying the training and certification of psychologists. These countries have established specific yet wide-ranging guidelines for a European [[Diploma]] in Psychology comparable to a Master\u2019s level [[Higher education|university education]] of six years duration that includes supervised practice. The diploma will enable psychologists trained in one country to practice in other European countries and is likely to influence the education and practice of psychologists in other parts of the world as well.\n\nCountries that currently have limited or no regulation of the profession include [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Japan]], [[Kenya]], [[Kuwait]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]] and [[Turkey]]. Several of these countries are working toward licensing legislation, and several have developed ethical standards of practice to guide.\nMany national psychology associations have adopted a [[Ethical code|code of ethics]] such as, for instance, APA\u2019s Ethical Principles of Psychologists and [[Code of Conduct]]. EFPA has adopted several codes of ethics in recent years, and the five [[Nordic countries]] (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) adopted a unified code of ethics in 1988, which they revised in 1998 to be more consistent with EFPA\u2019s meta-code (Pettifor, 2007). Moreover, IUPsyS and IAAP adopted, in 2008, a Universal Declaration of Ethical Principles for Psychologists. Such codes and declarations tend to be aspirational in nature.\n\n== Conclusion ==\n\nThe scope of scientific psychology and its practice have expanded enormously from its early beginnings in the 19th century to today. This holds true for all post-industrial countries and increasingly for some modernizing nations such as Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, and Turkey. In contrast, psychology remains much less visible in the poorer countries and especially so in their rural areas. The expansion of psychology into the nonwestern world has led to an increasing awareness of the role of cultural factors in psychological functioning together with repeated calls to \u201cindigenize\u201d psychology (Kim, Yang, & Hwang, 2006). International contacts among psychologists as well as joint research and applied projects across national and geographic boundaries have prospered thanks to the rapidly evolving technologies of transportation and  [[Telecommunication|electronic communication]]. Consequently, one may safely predict that the cross-cultural, global, and international dimensions of psychology will become more prominent in the foreseeable future.\n\n== Representative journals and newsletters ==\n* Applied Psychology: An International Journal (IAAP)\n* Asian Journal of [[Social psychology|Social Psychology]] (Asian Association of Social Psychology/Japanese [[Group dynamics|Group Dynamics]] Association)\n* [[European Psychologist]] (EFPA)\n* International Journal of Psychology (IUPsyS)\n* International Perspectives in Psychology: Research, Practice, Consultation (APA Division 52)\n* International Psychologist (ICP)\n* International Psychology Bulletin (APA Division 52)\n* Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology (IACCP)\n* Psychology International [http://www.apa.org/pi www.apa.org/pi]\n* Revista Interamericana de Psicolog\u00eda/Interamerican Journal of Psychology (SIP)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Additional References and Further Reading ==\n*{{cite journal |last=Adair |first=J.
