The local [[hardiness zone]] is 6b.\n\n==History==\n\n=== 1685 to 1906===\nThe original inhabitants of Wyomissing were [[Lenape]] (Delaware) Native Americans, who lived along the banks of Wyomissing Creek. The name ''Wyomissing'' is from the [[Delaware language]], meaning \"the land of flats\".<ref>Bright, William (2004). ''Native American Place Names of the United States''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 576</ref> Much of Berks County was transferred from the Native Americans to [[William Penn]] in 1685. Title to the land that much of Wyomissing is built upon was in two parcels, an eastern tract and a western tract, which were divided by a northwesterly line in the vicinity of Lake Avenue. One of the earliest industries in the area was the Evans Grist Mill. This building still stands at the corner of Old Mill Road and Old Wyomissing Road.\n \nIn 1896, present-day Wyomissing began to take form when Thomas P. Merritt (a Reading lumber dealer) acquired {{convert|600|acre}}. Albert Thalheimer, David H. Keiser, Marthias Mengel, and [[Levi Walter Mengel]] joined Thomas R. Merrit in organizing the Reading Suburban Real Estate Company. Shortly afterwards Wyomissing Industries, manufacturer of textile machinery, was established by the firm of Thun & Janssen along the [[Reading Railroad]] just west of Van Reed Road (today named Park Road). Ferdinand Thun, Henry K Janssen, and Gustav Oberlaender became known as \"The Big Three of Wyomissing Industries.<ref name=Reading>[https://www.readingeagle.com/resources/article/ferdinand-thun-and-henry-k-janssen-were-destined-for-shared-success Ferdinand Thun and Henry K Janssen were destined for shared success] 16 January 2018 article in Reading Eagle</ref> Wyomissing Industries comprised Narrow Fabric Co., Textile Machine Works and Berkshire Knitting Mills.<ref name=Reading/> This spurred development, and soon there were many developers working to build Wyomissing.\n \nIn 1904 and 1905, Thun and Janssen called town meetings to discuss setting up a borough government. Eventually petitions were filed with the courts for the establishment of a borough, signed by 61 resident property owners and 39 non-resident property owners. \n \nOn July 2, 1906, the court issued the final decree of the incorporation of the Borough of Wyomissing.\n\n===1907 to present===\nBetween 1906 and the 1940s, several additional tracts of land were annexed to the borough from Spring and Cumru townships. However, 1949-1950 saw the largest annexation, With the addition of the area north of the railroad tracts known as Berkshire Heights. This drastically changed the borough map.\n \nFrom that point forward, the borough changed from farmland to a large residential and commercial community. The last farmland worked in the borough was part of the Hartman Farm at the intersection of Woodland and Papermill roads. This land was sold into commercial development in the early 1990s. This includes the area now called \"Woodmill Commons\", where DSW Shoes, Old Navy and other businesses now are located.\n\nIn 2002, Wyomissing merged with its smaller neighbor, Wyomissing Hills.\n\n==Economy==\nWyomissing is a thriving commercial office and retail center, in large part due to its proximity to [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]]. The [[Berkshire Mall (Pennsylvania)|Berkshire Mall]] is located in Wyomissing along with several other large shopping centers with their retail giants and restaurants. As crime soared in Reading throughout the 1990s, companies and corporations relocated from the city to newer, Class A office space in the borough. In addition to a suburban layout, the greater Wyomissing area is at the crossroads of U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 422|422]] and [[U.S. Route 222|222]], providing immediate highway access to the rest of the greater [[Philadelphia]] and Berks County region. Several large corporations are headquartered in Wyomissing, including [[Penn National Gaming]], the second largest [[gambling|gaming]] company in the U.S., [[Boscov's]] Inc., one of the last family-owned department store chains in the U.S., and [[Carpenter Technology Corporation]]. [[UGI Corporation|UGI]] and [[VF Corporation]] have major operations in the borough. [[Sovereign Bank]] was previously headquartered here. Wyomissing has outpaced the rest of the Southeastern Pennsylvania region in job growth, registering an average job growth of 13.3% per year from 2000 to 2006. Financial giants [[Merrill Lynch]], [[Goldman Sachs]], and [[Citibank]] are developing data backup centers using the region's close proximity to major fiber optic lines running down the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 985\n|1920= 2062\n|1930= 3111\n|1940= 3320\n|1950= 4187\n|1960= 5044\n|1970= 7136\n|1980= 6551\n|1990= 7332\n|2000= 8587\n|2010= 10461\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=10499\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=June 11, 2013 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 8,587 people, 3,359 households, and 2,096 families residing in the borough.

The local [[hardiness zone]] is 6b.\n\n==History==\n\n=== 1685 to 1906===\nThe original inhabitants of Wyomissing were [[Lenape]] (Delaware) Native Americans, who lived along the banks of Wyomissing Creek. The name ''Wyomissing'' is from the [[Delaware language]], meaning \"the land of flats\".<ref>Bright, William (2004). ''Native American Place Names of the United States''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 576</ref> Much of Berks County was transferred from the Native Americans to [[William Penn]] in 1685. Title to the land that much of Wyomissing is built upon was in two parcels, an eastern tract and a western tract, which were divided by a northwesterly line in the vicinity of Lake Avenue. One of the earliest industries in the area was the Evans Grist Mill. This building still stands at the corner of Old Mill Road and Old Wyomissing Road.\n \nIn 1896, present-day Wyomissing began to take form when Thomas P. Merritt (a Reading lumber dealer) acquired {{convert|600|acre}}. Albert Thalheimer, David H. Keiser, Marthias Mengel, and [[Levi Walter Mengel]] joined Thomas R. Merrit in organizing the Reading Suburban Real Estate Company. Shortly afterwards Wyomissing Industries, manufacturer of textile machinery, was established by the firm of Thun & Janssen along the [[Reading Railroad]] just west of Van Reed Road (today named Park Road). Ferdinand Thun, Henry K Janssen, and Gustav Oberlaender became known as \"The Big Three of Wyomissing Industries.<ref name=Reading>[https://www.readingeagle.com/resources/article/ferdinand-thun-and-henry-k-janssen-were-destined-for-shared-success Ferdinand Thun and Henry K Janssen were destined for shared success] 16 January 2018 article in Reading Eagle</ref> Wyomissing Industries comprised Narrow Fabric Co., Textile Machine Works and Berkshire Knitting Mills.<ref name=Reading/> This spurred development, and soon there were many developers working to build Wyomissing.\n \nIn 1904 and 1905, Thun and Janssen called town meetings to discuss setting up a borough government. Eventually petitions were filed with the courts for the establishment of a borough, signed by 61 resident property owners and 39 non-resident property owners. \n \nOn July 2, 1906, the court issued the final decree of the incorporation of the Borough of Wyomissing.\n\n===1907 to present===\nBetween 1906 and the 1940s, several additional tracts of land were annexed to the borough from Spring and Cumru townships. However, 1949-1950 saw the largest annexation, With the addition of the area north of the railroad tracts known as Berkshire Heights. This drastically changed the borough map.\n \nFrom that point forward, the borough changed from farmland to a large residential and commercial community. The last farmland worked in the borough was part of the Hartman Farm at the intersection of Woodland and Papermill roads. This land was sold into commercial development in the early 1990s. This includes the area now called \"Woodmill Commons\", where DSW Shoes, Old Navy and other businesses now are located.\n\nIn 2002, Wyomissing merged with its smaller neighbor, Wyomissing Hills.\n\n==Economy==\nWyomissing is a thriving commercial office and retail center, in large part due to its proximity to [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]]. The [[Berkshire Mall (Pennsylvania)|Berkshire Mall]] is located in Wyomissing along with several other large shopping centers with their retail giants and restaurants. As crime soared in Reading throughout the 1990s, companies and corporations relocated from the city to newer, Class A office space in the borough. In addition to a suburban layout, the greater Wyomissing area is at the crossroads of U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 422|422]] and [[U.S. Route 222|222]], providing immediate highway access to the rest of the greater [[Philadelphia]] and Berks County region. Several large corporations are headquartered in Wyomissing, including [[Penn National Gaming]], the second largest [[gambling|gaming]] company in the U.S., [[Boscov's]] Inc., one of the last family-owned department store chains in the U.S., and [[Carpenter Technology Corporation]]. [[UGI Corporation|UGI]] and [[VF Corporation]] have major operations in the borough. [[Sovereign Bank]] was previously headquartered here. Wyomissing has outpaced the rest of the Southeastern Pennsylvania region in job growth, registering an average job growth of 13.3% per year from 2000 to 2006. Financial giants [[Merrill Lynch]], [[Goldman Sachs]], and [[Citibank]] are developing data backup centers using the region's close proximity to major fiber optic lines running down the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 985\n|1920= 2062\n|1930= 3111\n|1940= 3320\n|1950= 4187\n|1960= 5044\n|1970= 7136\n|1980= 6551\n|1990= 7332\n|2000= 8587\n|2010= 10461\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=10499\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=June 11, 2013 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 8,587 people, 3,359 households, and 2,096 families residing in the borough.

In the 19th century an iron furnace and woolen mill were the main industrial operations, both owned and operated by Peter Graff I.\n\nThe town's first settlers were a mix of eastern Pennsylvanians and newly arrived immigrants of [[Ulster Scots people|Scotch-Irish]], German and English background. Other ethnic groups would arrive in the early 20th century in small numbers. Other later industries included tile block and clay drain pipe manufacturing, aluminum ladder and specialty tool and die production, limestone mining, and underground mushroom farming. The town hosts several merchants including the Worthington Hardware, Grumpy's Pizza (formerly Cade's Tomato Pie), Carlesi's Restaurant, Moonlight Credit Union, Wo-Town Market (formerly Long's Market) and Bowser's Feed Store, four Protestant churches, a community park, several civic organizations (including a public library), and a community center and municipal complex housed in the former Junior/Senior High School.

A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough Council consists of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle.<ref name=DataBook>''2012 New Jersey Legislative District Data Book'', [[Rutgers University]] [[Edward J.

The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.<ref>Cerra, Michael F.

{"title_page": "Regeneration in humans", "text_new": "'''Regeneration in humans''' is the regrowth of lost tissues or organs in response to injury. This is in contrast to [[wound healing]], which involves closing up the injury site with a [[scar]]. Some tissues such as skin and large organs including the liver regrow quite readily, while others have been thought to have little or no capacity for regeneration. However ongoing research, particularly in the heart and lungs, suggests that there is hope for a variety of tissues and organs to eventually become regeneration-capable.\n\n==History of human tissue regeneration==\nIn humans with non-injured tissues, the tissue is naturally regenerated over time; by default these tissues have new cells available to replace expended cells. For example, the body regenerates a full bone within 10 years, while non-injured skin tissue is regenerated within two weeks.<ref name=tedOrgans2009/> With injured tissue, the body usually has a different response \u2013 this emergency response usually involves building a degree of scar tissue over a time period longer than a regenerative response, as has been proven clinically<ref name=Cubison2006>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cubison TC, Pape SA, Parkhouse N |title=Evidence for the link between healing time and the development of hypertrophic scars (HTS) in paediatric burns due to scald injury |journal=Burns |volume=32 |issue=8 |pages=992\u20139 |date=December 2006  |pmid=16901651 |doi=10.1016/j.burns.2006.02.007}}</ref> and via observation.

These include the liver, fingertips, and endometrium. More information is now known regarding the passive replacement of tissues in the human body, as well as the mechanics of [[stem cell]]s.

The regenerative capacity of the mammalian kidney is limited compared to that of lower vertebrates.\n\nIn the mammalian kidney, the regeneration of the tubular component following an acute injury is well known. Recently regeneration of the [[glomerulus]] has also been documented. Following an acute injury, the proximal tubule is damaged more, and the injured epithelial cells slough off the basement membrane of the nephron. The surviving epithelial cells, however, undergo migration, dedifferentiation, proliferation, and redifferentiation to replenish the epithelial lining of the proximal tubule after injury. Recently, the presence and participation of kidney [[stem cell]]s in the tubular regeneration has been shown. However, the concept of kidney stem cells is currently emerging. In addition to the surviving tubular epithelial cells and kidney stem cells, the bone marrow stem cells have also been shown to participate in regeneration of the proximal tubule, however, the mechanisms remain controversial. Recently, studies examining the capacity of bone marrow stem cells to differentiate into renal cells are emerging.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kurinji | year = 2009 | title = In Vitro Differentiation of MSC into Cells with a Renal Tubular Epithelial-Like Phenotype | journal = Renal Failure | volume = 31 | issue = 6| pages = 492\u2013502 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1080/08860220902928981| pmid = 19839827 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nLike other organs, the kidney is also known to regenerate completely in lower vertebrates such as fish.

This is in contrast to [[wound healing]], which involves closing up the injury site with a [[scar]]. Some tissues such as skin and large organs including the liver regrow quite readily, while others have been thought to have little or no capacity for regeneration. However ongoing research, particularly in the heart and lungs, suggests that there is hope for a variety of tissues and organs to eventually become regeneration-capable.\n\n==History of human tissue regeneration==\nIn humans with non-injured tissues, the tissue is naturally regenerated over time; by default these tissues have new cells available to replace expended cells. For example, the body regenerates a full bone within 10 years, while non-injured skin tissue is regenerated within two weeks.<ref name=tedOrgans2009/> With injured tissue, the body usually has a different response \u2013 this emergency response usually involves building a degree of scar tissue over a time period longer than a regenerative response, as has been proven clinically<ref name=Cubison2006>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cubison TC, Pape SA, Parkhouse N |title=Evidence for the link between healing time and the development of hypertrophic scars (HTS) in paediatric burns due to scald injury |journal=Burns |volume=32 |issue=8 |pages=992\u20139 |date=December 2006  |pmid=16901651 |doi=10.1016/j.burns.2006.02.007}}</ref> and via observation.

The regenerative capacity of the mammalian kidney is limited compared to that of lower vertebrates.\n\nIn the mammalian kidney, the regeneration of the tubular component following an acute injury is well known. Recently regeneration of the [[glomerulus]] has also been documented. Following an acute injury, the proximal tubule is damaged more, and the injured epithelial cells slough off the basement membrane of the nephron. The surviving epithelial cells, however, undergo migration, dedifferentiation, proliferation, and redifferentiation to replenish the epithelial lining of the proximal tubule after injury. Recently, the presence and participation of kidney [[stem cell]]s in the tubular regeneration has been shown. However, the concept of kidney stem cells is currently emerging. In addition to the surviving tubular epithelial cells and kidney stem cells, the bone marrow stem cells have also been shown to participate in regeneration of the proximal tubule, however, the mechanisms remain controversial.
