{"title_page": "History of the Jews in Central Asia", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=October 2019}} \nThe '''history of the Jews in Central Asia''' dates back centuries, where [[Jews]] <nowiki/>have lived in countries including [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tajikistan]].\n\n==Kazakhstan==\n{{main|History of the Jews in Kazakhstan}}\n\n[[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Joseph Stalin]] forcibly moved thousands of Jews from other parts of the [[Soviet Union]] to the [[Kazakh SSR]]. During [[the Holocaust]] 8,000 Jews fled to [[Kazakhstan]].\n\nKazakhstan's Jewish population rapidly increased between 1926 and 1959, being almost eight times larger in 1959 than in 1926. Kazakhstan's Jewish population slowly declined between 1959 and 1989, followed by a much larger decline after the [[fall of Communism]] between 1989 and 2002 due to massive Jewish [[emigration]], mostly [[aliyah|to Israel]].\n\n==Kyrgyzstan==\n{{main|History of the Jews in Kyrgyzstan}}\n\nUntil the 20th century, most Jews living in the Kyrgyz areas were of the [[Bukharan Jews|Bukharan Jewish]] community. However, during the 20th century, large numbers of European Jews began to emigrate to Kyrgyzstan which was then part of the [[Soviet Union]], and a small number still live in that country.\n\nAccording to a census held in 1896, Jews represented about 2% of the region total population. Ashkenazi Jews first arrived to Kyrgyzstan with its conquest by the Russians. After [[World War I]], more and more Ashkenazi Jews came to Kyrgyzstan. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], more than 20,000 Ashkenazi Jews fled to Kyrgyzstan from the Nazi-occupied western parts of the Soviet Union. After the Second World War the percentage of the Jewish population began to decline and in early 2001 the Jews represented only 0.03% of the total population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/kyrgyzstan|title=Jewish Community go Kyrgyzstan|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot Open Databases Project, The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Mongolia==\n{{main|History of the Jews in Mongolia}}\n\nThe Mongolian Jews date back to the 19th-century trade routes between [[Siberia]]n-[[Jewish people|Jewish]] merchants and the [[Mongols|Mongolians]]. This resulted in some Jewish families entering [[Mongolia]]. Before 1920, most Jews that arrived in Mongolia were of [[Russian people|Russian]] background, and had fled the chaos of the [[Russian Civil War]].\n\nA number of Jews left the country in search of better economic opportunities.

They inspired Retinger to write three volumes on the tumultuous events of that Latin American republic.<ref name = \"Podg\u00f3rski\"/> The Mexican years were punctuated by trips back to Europe where he took on the role of Representative in the United Kingdom of the Polish Socialist Party (1924\u20131928). In 1926 he married his second wife, Stella, with whom he travelled to Mexico on one occasion. After her death in 1933 his two daughters were left in the care of their maternal grandmother and were estranged from him until the 1950s.\n\nIn the rest of the interwar period, he published many contributions in periodicals, such as the Polish ''Wiadomo\u015bci Literackie'' (Literary News), on literary and political subjects.<ref name=\"Oleks\"/>\n\n==Building blocks on the table==\n[[File:W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski, 1923.jpg|thumb|150px|[[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], Polish prime minister in 1923]]\nDuring [[World War II]], Retinger who was in [[London]], was involved in arranging for Polish troops to be transferred to Britain from France.

In order not to tread on Soviet toes, the British altered their position and refused to back Sikorski's negotiations with the eight smaller European states. In his speech on the Council of Europe, [[Winston Churchill]] [https://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1941-1945-war-leader/national-address/ BBC radio broadcast] on 21 March 1943 referred to the necessity of smaller nations forming groupings, but that it was too early to go into detail. The most Retinger was able to achieve was to push through the [[Sikorski-Mayski Agreement]], signed on 30 July 1941, which provided for the formation of the [[Anders' army]], thus ridding Stalin of the immediate human problem posed by the hundreds of thousands of Polish [[Prisoner of war|POW]]s and deportees from the [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u201345)|Soviet occupied]] [[Kresy Zachodnie|Kresy]] regions of the former [[Second Polish Republic]], who after an arduous odyssey across thousands of miles would eventually end up as the [[United Kingdom]]'s human problem.<ref>{{cite book|author=Anders, Lt.-General W\u0142adys\u0142aw|title= An Army in Exile|publisher= MacMillan & Co.

The spare seat on the plane went to Sikorski's daughter who died with her father.<ref name=\"Oleks\"/> Retinger was devastated by this turn of events. His relationship with Sikorski's successor, [[Stanislaw Mikolajczyk]] was much more ambivalent, but he obtained his consent for a special mission to Poland under [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] in April 1944.<ref>Bu\u0142hak, W\u0142adys\u0142aw. \"The Foreign Office and the [[Special Operations Executive]] and the Expedition of J\u00f3zef Hieronim Retinger to Poland, April\u2013July 1944\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. 61, no. 3, 2016, pp. 33\u201357.</ref>\n\nWith an SOE brief and without prior training, Retinger, aged 56, parachuted into [[German-occupied Poland|occupied Poland]] with 2nd Lt. [[Tadeusz Chciuk-Celt]], (see [[Tadeusz Chciuk-Celt#Operation \"Salamander\"|Operation Salamander]]), to meet with Polish underground figures, to deliver money to the Polish underground, and to \"explain to his fellow Poles in the homeland 'how are we going to lose this war'\".<ref name=\"The Global Manipulators\">{{cite book|last1=Eringer|first1=Robert|author-link=Robert Eringer|title=The Global Manipulators|publisher=Pentacle Books|asin=B00546KTEM|oclc=26551991}}</ref>{{rp|pages=16\u201322}} <ref name = \"JR\"/>{{rp|page=265}}<ref name=\"Marcus E. Ethridge 2017\"/>  Following at least one assassination attempt on him, Retinger expressed his frustration thus:\n\n{{blockquote|You know why I came.  The [Underground] [[Government Delegation for Poland|Delegate]] knows as well.... They know that I only want to convince them that it will be necessary in the future to cooperate with the Communists, because no English are coming here, only Russians.  If we do not get along with them somehow, it will be a terrible tragedy, because we well know what [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and the [[NKVD]] [Interior Ministry of the Soviet Union] are. And it's about trying to make people here understand this fact. And they want to murder me!}}<ref name=\"Marcus E. Ethridge 2017\"/>\n\nThe latter quip was a reference to elements in the [[Polish Underground Army]], the [[Armia Krajowa|AK]] who were convinced Retinger was not serving the interests of his country and should therefore be \"removed\". One apparent attempt to liquidate him in Poland was on the grounds of a \"death sentence\" to be carried out on the alleged orders of general [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]]. It was foiled by the intervention of an old friend and [[Armia Krajowa|AK fighter]], Tadeusz Gebethner.<ref>{{cite web|title=The story of Tadeusz Gebethner|url=https://sprawiedliwi.org.pl/en/stories-of-rescue/story-tadeusz-gebethner|publisher=sprawiedliwi.org.pl |access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref> There was also an attempt during his visit in occupied Poland to poison him, which failed. On his return to London, he spent some time in the [[Dorchester Hotel]] in London's [[Park Lane, London|Park Lane]] recovering from his ordeal of the trip, which left him lame in one leg for the rest of his life, possibly due to the [[Polyneuritis]] brought on by the poison.

Working in particular with Britain's [[Duncan Sandys]], incidentally Churchill's son-in-law, he took on the lion's share of the work and became Honorary Secretary General of the [[European Movement]]. He organised the 1948 [[Congress of Europe|Hague Congress]] which brought together the two camps of those for a unified Europe and those in favour of a federal Europe.<ref name=\"Lane\"/> During the congress, Retinger networked assiduously among the delegates, who included the Vatican diplomat, [[Giovanni Montini]], the future [[Pope Paul VI]].

The spare seat on the plane went to Sikorski's daughter who died with her father.<ref name=\"Oleks\"/> Retinger was devastated by this turn of events.

One apparent attempt to liquidate him in Poland was on the grounds of a \"death sentence\" to be carried out on the alleged orders of general [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]].
