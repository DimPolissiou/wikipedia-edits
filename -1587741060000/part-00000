It began airing on December 5, 2005, hosted by stand-up comedian [[Ben Bailey]], and aired its last episode on September 28, 2012. The show was revived on December 4, 2017. It is part of the global ''[[Cash Cab (British game show)|Cash Cab]]'' franchise that originated in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile Bailey's show took place in New York City, some episodes of season six took place in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].  Contestants who ultimately hailed the Cash Cab were not made aware that they were part of the game until they hired the cab and Bailey informed them of the show and its rules.\n\nOn August 8, 2007, Discovery Channel began airing a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] edition of the program, ''Cash Cab: After Dark'', in which contestants were picked up near or after sunset as well as overnight and the cash value of the questions was double that of the regular version of the show. The questions were usually more difficult than the daytime version.\n\nOn September 19, 2019, it was announced that the series would be revived. It premiered on October 7, 2019 on [[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Bravo Is Reviving the Popular Emmy Award-Winning Gameshow \"Cash Cab\" from Lion Television|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/07/02/bravo-is-reviving-the-popular-emmy-award-winning-gameshow-cash-cab-from-lion-television-213110/20190702bravo01/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=July 2, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bravo's Revival of Popular Gameshow \"Cash Cab\" Premieres Monday, October 7 at 11:30PM ET/PT|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/09/19/bravos-revival-of-popular-gameshow-cash-cab-premieres-monday-october-7-at-1130pm-et-pt-136414/20190919bravo01/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=September 19, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bravotv.com/cash-cab/episode-guide|title=Episode Guide {{!}} Cash Cab|date=2019-09-19|website=Bravo TV Official Site|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast history==\nAccording to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Discovery Channel initially ordered 40 episodes from Lion Television (with Executive Producers Tom Cohen, Allison Corn, and Tony Tackaberry with Ben Bailey being the most recent) and taping of the initial run was completed in November 2005 before the show premiered that December.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2005/scene/news/lion-tv-strikes-it-rich-with-format-shows-1117933650|title=Lion TV strikes it rich with format shows|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 29, 2005}}</ref> A new set of 40 episodes were taped and aired in 2006 and 2007.

Season 9 premiered on July 27, 2018 with a special [[Shark Week]] episode to coincide with the 30th Anniversary of Shark Week.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cash-cab-renewed-at-discovery-channel-1111515/|title='Cash Cab' Renewed at Discovery Channel (Exclusive)|last=Nordyke|first=Kimberly|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nWhen the potential contestants enter the cab and state their destination, they are made aware that they are in the Cash Cab as ceiling lights and a fanfare plays inside, accompanied by the host's greeting.  While the only rules given on-camera after the introduction and before asking \"Do you want to play?\" pertain to his or her driving and the \"three strikes and you're out\" rule, the contestants are also informed that once their traveling begins, the cab will not take detours of any kind unless directed by a police officer, stop sign, traffic light or other legal means of diverting traffic. Bailey or Melewski offers them the chance to get out of the cab if they do not wish to play, and contestants who choose to play the game must stay in the cab until they reach their destination or get three strikes.\n\nFor the first season, the first five questions were worth $25 each, the next five questions were worth $50 each, and any question thereafter was worth $100. For the second season, the first four questions were worth $25 each, the next four were worth $50 each, and the ninth and succeeding questions were worth $100. In ''Cash Cab: After Dark'' - and beginning with the regular episodes of Season 3 - all of the money values were doubled to $50, $100, and $200. Beginning in the fourth season, some games were designated as Double Ride games, making the question values $100, $200, and $400.\n\nEach wrong answer earns the contestant(s) a strike. On the third strike, they forfeit all their winnings and Bailey or Melewski will immediately pull over and kick them out of the cab. Once players have exited the Cash Cab, a camera crew from the trailing production van is already on the street waiting to tape their departure.\n\n===Red Light Challenge===\nWhen a contestant has won at least $200 or $300 in a normal game or an After Dark game - or at least $400 or $600 on a Double Ride, and the cab is forced to stop at a traffic light, Bailey or Melewski will announce a Red Light Challenge. He or she reads a question that has multiple correct answers usually four to seven and the passenger(s) have 30 seconds to give those answers; they do not always have to give all of the answers. Since there is no penalty for an incorrect answer, giving all the correct answers in the allotted time is worth $250 or $500 during Double Ride games regardless of how many incorrect answers a contestant might also blurt out along the way. The contestant does not receive the extra $250 (or $500) if the 30-second time limit runs out; it is also not counted as a strike, and the contestant doesn't lose any accumulated money. While only one Red Light Challenge is usually played per game, beginning in Season 4 there are multiple Red Light Challenges during certain games at least two per game with the second for accumulating at least $1,000 in revival season it was sponsored by Cash app\n\n===Shout-Outs===\nContestants have two forms of help known as \"Shout-Outs\" at their disposal during the game; each can be used only once, and neither may be used on a Red Light Challenge or a Video Bonus. In the Mobile Shout-Out, the contestant makes a phone call to someone they choose by means of a cell phone either provided by Bailey or Melewski or one belonging to a contestant if they have one. The call can take up to a maximum of 15 seconds before the contestant has to give an answer, with the result being either additional money or a strike. The contestant may also elect to use a Street Shout-Out, in which Bailey or Melewski immediately pulls the cab to a curb so that anyone on the sidewalk can be asked for help, without any official time limit. A second Street Shout-Out is included on a Double Ride meaning they can ask another person but no second Mobile Shout-out meaning they can't call another person. In the revived Cash Cab, the Mobile Shout-Out was replaced by the Social Media Shout-Out, in which Ben activates Facebook Live so that those on the site may help the contestant.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://people.com/tv/cash-cab-back-discovery-channel/|title=Cash Cab Is Coming Back to TV (with Celebrity Guests!)

Bailey/Melewski plays a video clip and asks the contestant(s) a single question based on its content. If the question is answered correctly, the contestant(s) win double what they have earned so far, but if they are wrong, they lose all of their money \"at the very last moment\", as Bailey says, and \"leave with nothing but a cab ride\".\n\nUnlike some other versions of the game, U.S. contestants who decline to attempt the Video Bonus are not shown the question they would have been asked.\n\n===Double Ride===\nBeginning in Season 4, this rarely occurring part of the show happens when randomly selected passengers are able to win double the amount of money of a normal game. The first four questions are worth $100, the second four are worth $200 and the rest until the end of the game are worth $400. The \"Red Light Challenge\" is worth $500.\n\n==Record payouts==\nThe current record of $6,200 won on one ride is held by Sam Meyer (riding solo, on a Double Ride, taking and winning the Double-or-Nothing Video Bonus question) on the episode that aired May 18, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121443709962505255?mod=opinion_journal_leisure_art|title= He Drives This Game-Show Vehicle|newspaper = The Wall Street Journal | first=Joanne | last=Kaufman | date=June 26, 2008}}</ref> This topped the old record held by contestants Sean Devney and Steve Irolla, two New York City tour guides who won $4,100 after answering the \"Video Bonus\" question correctly. They reached their final destination with two strikes (both on $200 questions).\n\n==Special editions==\nOne episode of the program was a special celebrity edition, featuring actor [[Thomas Haden Church]] of ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', [[National Hockey League|NHL]] players [[Jed Ortmeyer]] and [[Ryan Hollweg]] of the [[New York Rangers]] and journalist [[Harry Smith (US journalist)|Harry Smith]], formerly of [[CBS]]' ''[[The Early Show]]''. All played for a charity of their choice, and Discovery Channel matched the contestants' winnings. Another episode was a special in which the passengers were asked questions relating to the 2008 film ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]''. In this episode, the host of ''[[Cash Cab (Canadian game show)|Cash Cab: Canada]]'', [[Adam Growe]], was driving the cab instead of [[Ben Bailey]].\n\nOn April 21, 2009, Discovery aired a charity episode of ''Cash Cab'' for its 250th episode featuring two rides by boat crew members from ''[[Deadliest Catch]]''. ''[[FV Time Bandit|Time Bandit]]'' co-captain Andy Hillstrand and Josh Harris, son of ''[[FV Cornelia Marie|Cornelia Marie]]'' captain [[Phil Harris (fisherman)|Phil Harris]], went against [[Sig Hansen]] (captain of the [[FV Northwestern|''Northwestern'']]) and his two brothers. All cash values were doubled from the Season 3 payouts, the passengers received a second Street Shout-Out, and all money earned was donated by the passengers to the charities of their choice.\n\nIn the ''Cash Cab: Las Vegas'' episodes, filmed in May 2010 and broadcast beginning in August of that year,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.vegaschatter.com/story/2010/8/9/114010/3894/vegas-travel/Cash+Cab+Shouts+Out+To+Vegas+Tonightl?mod=art|title= Cash Cab Shouts Out To Vegas Tonight|publisher = Vegas Chatter | date=August 9, 2010}}</ref> celebrities play for charity and civilians play for themselves.

The rear of the cab behind the seats contains ten recording decks and other production equipment.\n\nThe lighting and the music that go off when contestants enter the cab consist of a switchboard that is connected to an [[iPod]] and the car stereo. The Video Bonus monitor is a DVD player that is embedded to the back of the front passenger seat.\n\nSome contestants are randomly picked as they walk along the sidewalk, while others are selected in advance.

It premiered on October 7, 2019 on [[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Bravo Is Reviving the Popular Emmy Award-Winning Gameshow \"Cash Cab\" from Lion Television|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/07/02/bravo-is-reviving-the-popular-emmy-award-winning-gameshow-cash-cab-from-lion-television-213110/20190702bravo01/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=July 2, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bravo's Revival of Popular Gameshow \"Cash Cab\" Premieres Monday, October 7 at 11:30PM ET/PT|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/09/19/bravos-revival-of-popular-gameshow-cash-cab-premieres-monday-october-7-at-1130pm-et-pt-136414/20190919bravo01/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=September 19, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bravotv.com/cash-cab/episode-guide|title=Episode Guide {{!}} Cash Cab|date=2019-09-19|website=Bravo TV Official Site|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast history==\nAccording to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Discovery Channel initially ordered 40 episodes from Lion Television (with Executive Producers Tom Cohen, Allison Corn, and Tony Tackaberry with Ben Bailey being the most recent) and taping of the initial run was completed in November 2005 before the show premiered that December.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2005/scene/news/lion-tv-strikes-it-rich-with-format-shows-1117933650|title=Lion TV strikes it rich with format shows|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 29, 2005}}</ref> A new set of 40 episodes were taped and aired in 2006 and 2007.

Another 40 episodes were taped for airing in 2010 and 2011.\n\nThe sixth season premiered on February 14, 2011, at 6:00 p.m. E/P. During a hiatus, Ben Bailey did a standup special recounting his time as host of the show. He correctly stated in the special that the show has been cancelled for the last two years (taping for the then-current series wrapped in 2008), however, a renewal offer was made after the standup concert was taped during 2011 returning the show to the schedule.

Season 9 premiered on July 27, 2018 with a special [[Shark Week]] episode to coincide with the 30th Anniversary of Shark Week.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cash-cab-renewed-at-discovery-channel-1111515/|title='Cash Cab' Renewed at Discovery Channel (Exclusive)|last=Nordyke|first=Kimberly|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nWhen the potential contestants enter the cab and state their destination, they are made aware that they are in the Cash Cab as ceiling lights and a fanfare plays inside, accompanied by the host's greeting.  While the only rules given on-camera after the introduction and before asking \"Do you want to play?\" pertain to his or her driving and the \"three strikes and you're out\" rule, the contestants are also informed that once their traveling begins, the cab will not take detours of any kind unless directed by a police officer, stop sign, traffic light or other legal means of diverting traffic. Bailey or Melewski offers them the chance to get out of the cab if they do not wish to play, and contestants who choose to play the game must stay in the cab until they reach their destination or get three strikes.\n\nFor the first season, the first five questions were worth $25 each, the next five questions were worth $50 each, and any question thereafter was worth $100. For the second season, the first four questions were worth $25 each, the next four were worth $50 each, and the ninth and succeeding questions were worth $100. In ''Cash Cab: After Dark'' - and beginning with the regular episodes of Season 3 - all of the money values were doubled to $50, $100, and $200. Beginning in the fourth season, some games were designated as Double Ride games, making the question values $100, $200, and $400.\n\nEach wrong answer earns the contestant(s) a strike. On the third strike, they forfeit all their winnings and Bailey or Melewski will immediately pull over and kick them out of the cab. Once players have exited the Cash Cab, a camera crew from the trailing production van is already on the street waiting to tape their departure.\n\n===Red Light Challenge===\nWhen a contestant has won at least $200 or $300 in a normal game or an After Dark game - or at least $400 or $600 on a Double Ride, and the cab is forced to stop at a traffic light, Bailey or Melewski will announce a Red Light Challenge. He or she reads a question that has multiple correct answers usually four to seven and the passenger(s) have 30 seconds to give those answers; they do not always have to give all of the answers. Since there is no penalty for an incorrect answer, giving all the correct answers in the allotted time is worth $250 or $500 during Double Ride games regardless of how many incorrect answers a contestant might also blurt out along the way. The contestant does not receive the extra $250 (or $500) if the 30-second time limit runs out; it is also not counted as a strike, and the contestant doesn't lose any accumulated money. While only one Red Light Challenge is usually played per game, beginning in Season 4 there are multiple Red Light Challenges during certain games at least two per game with the second for accumulating at least $1,000 in revival season it was sponsored by Cash app\n\n===Shout-Outs===\nContestants have two forms of help known as \"Shout-Outs\" at their disposal during the game; each can be used only once, and neither may be used on a Red Light Challenge or a Video Bonus. In the Mobile Shout-Out, the contestant makes a phone call to someone they choose by means of a cell phone either provided by Bailey or Melewski or one belonging to a contestant if they have one. The call can take up to a maximum of 15 seconds before the contestant has to give an answer, with the result being either additional money or a strike. The contestant may also elect to use a Street Shout-Out, in which Bailey or Melewski immediately pulls the cab to a curb so that anyone on the sidewalk can be asked for help, without any official time limit. A second Street Shout-Out is included on a Double Ride meaning they can ask another person but no second Mobile Shout-out meaning they can't call another person. In the revived Cash Cab, the Mobile Shout-Out was replaced by the Social Media Shout-Out, in which Ben activates Facebook Live so that those on the site may help the contestant.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://people.com/tv/cash-cab-back-discovery-channel/|title=Cash Cab Is Coming Back to TV (with Celebrity Guests!)

Bailey/Melewski plays a video clip and asks the contestant(s) a single question based on its content. If the question is answered correctly, the contestant(s) win double what they have earned so far, but if they are wrong, they lose all of their money \"at the very last moment\", as Bailey says, and \"leave with nothing but a cab ride\".\n\nUnlike some other versions of the game, U.S. contestants who decline to attempt the Video Bonus are not shown the question they would have been asked.\n\n===Double Ride===\nBeginning in Season 4, this rarely occurring part of the show happens when randomly selected passengers are able to win double the amount of money of a normal game. The first four questions are worth $100, the second four are worth $200 and the rest until the end of the game are worth $400. The \"Red Light Challenge\" is worth $500.\n\n==Record payouts==\nThe current record of $6,200 won on one ride is held by Sam Meyer (riding solo, on a Double Ride, taking and winning the Double-or-Nothing Video Bonus question) on the episode that aired May 18, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121443709962505255?mod=opinion_journal_leisure_art|title= He Drives This Game-Show Vehicle|newspaper = The Wall Street Journal | first=Joanne | last=Kaufman | date=June 26, 2008}}</ref> This topped the old record held by contestants Sean Devney and Steve Irolla, two New York City tour guides who won $4,100 after answering the \"Video Bonus\" question correctly. They reached their final destination with two strikes (both on $200 questions).\n\n==Special editions==\nOne episode of the program was a special celebrity edition, featuring actor [[Thomas Haden Church]] of ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', [[National Hockey League|NHL]] players [[Jed Ortmeyer]] and [[Ryan Hollweg]] of the [[New York Rangers]] and journalist [[Harry Smith (US journalist)|Harry Smith]], formerly of [[CBS]]' ''[[The Early Show]]''. All played for a charity of their choice, and Discovery Channel matched the contestants' winnings. Another episode was a special in which the passengers were asked questions relating to the 2008 film ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]''. In this episode, the host of ''[[Cash Cab (Canadian game show)|Cash Cab: Canada]]'', [[Adam Growe]], was driving the cab instead of [[Ben Bailey]].\n\nOn April 21, 2009, Discovery aired a charity episode of ''Cash Cab'' for its 250th episode featuring two rides by boat crew members from ''[[Deadliest Catch]]''. ''[[FV Time Bandit|Time Bandit]]'' co-captain Andy Hillstrand and Josh Harris, son of ''[[FV Cornelia Marie|Cornelia Marie]]'' captain [[Phil Harris (fisherman)|Phil Harris]], went against [[Sig Hansen]] (captain of the [[FV Northwestern|''Northwestern'']]) and his two brothers.

The rear of the cab behind the seats contains ten recording decks and other production equipment.\n\nThe lighting and the music that go off when contestants enter the cab consist of a switchboard that is connected to an [[iPod]] and the car stereo. The Video Bonus monitor is a DVD player that is embedded to the back of the front passenger seat.\n\nSome contestants are randomly picked as they walk along the sidewalk, while others are selected in advance.

It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on April 6, 2005.\n\nIn the episode, the boys try to lose their baseball games on purpose so they can play video games all summer, instead of dealing with baseball. Meanwhile, Randy trains to fight the other fathers at the games.\n\n==Plot==\nNone of the boys playing for the South Park Cows, the town's [[Little League Baseball]] team, enjoy the sport at all. They find baseball boring and play only because of their parents' enthusiasm for the sport.\n\nWhen they win their final game, they are at first overjoyed, believing the season is over and they have the rest of the summer to enjoy - only until they discover, to their horror, that since they finished first in their [[Division (sport)|division]], they will have to continue playing in the post-season playoffs. During a 'celebration' meal, the team discusses plans to lose on purpose while making it look like they are trying.\n\nHowever, South Park realize that the other teams also want out, and have actually trained to lose games.  The South Park Cows end up winning again and again against opponents whose efforts at throwing games are more successful, and they eventually get to the state championship game. To their horror, they realize that if they win, their season will start again on the national circuit, meaning they will have to play baseball for the whole summer.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s father [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy]] has taken up the hobby of being a \"[[Trash-talk|trash-talking dad]]\", being generally obnoxious at every game so as to get into fights with other, equally obnoxious fathers. While training to be the best fighter he can be, Randy becomes terrified when he meets the Denver Little League team's \"Bat Dad\", who wears a purple [[Batman]] [[Batsuit#Cowl|cowl]] and cape, is much bigger than him, and behaves even more obnoxiously. He decides not to attend the game in fear that he isn't good enough.\n\n[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] tells the team that they need someone who \"totally sucks ass\" to join their team. [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] says he knows just the person: his nerdy cousin [[Kyle Schwartz]], who is terrible at all sports.\n\nStan and the others play their game against Denver, who, like the other opponents, do not want to win either. Even drafting Kyle's cousin fails, as the other team is the best yet at intentionally losing. Just as it seems the South Park team is sure to win, Randy shows up and begins a huge fight with Bat Dad that spills onto the field. Randy continues to fight as the boys cheer him on, leaving the officials to disqualify South Park, and the team celebrates, Randy upset the boys lost and realizing he\u2019s getting arrested, Stan thanks him for getting them disqualified, raising his confidence.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode's idea originally came from series co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] thinking that the children of South Park would look cute in baseball uniforms. Parker and Stone also were not fans of baseball themselves so it made sense to have the boys hate baseball. The choice to go ahead with a baseball-themed episode did create some problems animation-wise, however, as most of the children look nearly identical wearing the same uniforms. A lot of time was spent on ensuring that each character was distinguishable from each other. For example, [[Butters Stotch]] and [[Stan Marsh]] look identical with the same attire. To rectify this, Stan's hair is more prominent than Butters' and Butters has a speaking line early.<ref name=\"commentary\">{{cite video | people=Parker, Trey; Stone, Matt|date=2005|title=''South Park'' season 9 DVD commentary for the episode \"The Losing Edge\"|url=http://southpark.cc.com/clips/wvcytk/creator-commentary-the-losing-edge | medium=DVD|publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref> The episode's plot was originally going to be used in '' [[Best Friends Forever (South Park)|Best Friends Forever]] '' but was put on hold when they came up with an episode based on the [[Terri Schiavo case]] instead.\n\nAccording to the DVD commentary, \"this was a really, really hard episode to do\" because sports episodes in general aren't easy but also because the teams are trying to lose. Because they are trying to lose on purpose, new rules are needed which makes it different from any actual sport. The character of Bat Dad made it easier for Parker and Stone, however, as if it got too difficult, they could cut to Bat Dad.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s09e05-the-losing-edge \"The Losing Edge\"] Full episode at South Park Studios\n* [http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/episodes/s09e05-the-losing-edge \"The Losing Edge\"] Episode guide at South Park Studios\n* [http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/The_Losing_Edge \"The Losing Edge\"] South Park Archives (Wikia)\n* {{IMDb episode|0763051}}\n* {{Tv.com episode|414873}}\n\n{{South Park episodes|9}}\n\n{{Colorado Rockies}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Losing Edge}}\n[[Category:South Park (season 9) episodes]]\n[[Category:Baseball animation]]\n[[Category:Colorado Rockies]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television episode\n| title = The Losing Edge\n| series = South Park\n| image =\n| caption =\n| season = 9\n| episode = 5\n| airdate = {{Start date|2005|4|6}}\n| production = 905\n| writer = Trey Parker\n| director = [[Trey Parker]]\n| music = \"[[You're the Best]]\"<br>by [[Joe Esposito (singer)|Joe Esposito]]\n| guests = [[Diedrich Bader]] as Bat Dad\n| episode_list = List of South Park episodes\n| season_list =\n| prev = [[Best Friends Forever (South Park)|Best Friends Forever]]\n| next = [[The Death of Eric Cartman]]\n}}\n\n\"'''The Losing Edge'''\" is the fifth episode in the [[South Park (season 9)|ninth season]] of the American [[cartoon series|animated television series]] ''[[South Park]]''.

Just as it seems the South Park team is sure to win, Randy shows up and begins a huge fight with Bat Dad that spills onto the field. Randy continues to fight as the boys cheer him on, leaving the officials to disqualify South Park, and the team celebrates, Randy upset the boys lost and realizing he\u2019s getting arrested, Stan thanks him for getting them disqualified, raising his confidence.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode's idea originally came from series co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] thinking that the children of South Park would look cute in baseball uniforms. Parker and Stone also were not fans of baseball themselves so it made sense to have the boys hate baseball. The choice to go ahead with a baseball-themed episode did create some problems animation-wise, however, as most of the children look nearly identical wearing the same uniforms. A lot of time was spent on ensuring that each character was distinguishable from each other. For example, [[Butters Stotch]] and [[Stan Marsh]] look identical with the same attire. To rectify this, Stan's hair is more prominent than Butters' and Butters has a speaking line early.<ref name=\"commentary\">{{cite video | people=Parker, Trey; Stone, Matt|date=2005|title=''South Park'' season 9 DVD commentary for the episode \"The Losing Edge\"|url=http://southpark.cc.com/clips/wvcytk/creator-commentary-the-losing-edge | medium=DVD|publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref> The episode's plot was originally going to be used in '' [[Best Friends Forever (South Park)|Best Friends Forever]] '' but was put on hold when they came up with an episode based on the [[Terri Schiavo case]] instead.\n\nAccording to the DVD commentary, \"this was a really, really hard episode to do\" because sports episodes in general aren't easy but also because the teams are trying to lose. Because they are trying to lose on purpose, new rules are needed which makes it different from any actual sport. The character of Bat Dad made it easier for Parker and Stone, however, as if it got too difficult, they could cut to Bat Dad.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s09e05-the-losing-edge \"The Losing Edge\"] Full episode at South Park Studios\n* [http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/episodes/s09e05-the-losing-edge \"The Losing Edge\"] Episode guide at South Park Studios\n* [http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/The_Losing_Edge \"The Losing Edge\"] South Park Archives (Wikia)\n* {{IMDb episode|0763051}}\n* {{Tv.com episode|414873}}\n\n{{South Park episodes|9}}\n\n{{Colorado Rockies}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Losing Edge}}\n[[Category:South Park (season 9) episodes]]\n[[Category:Baseball animation]]\n[[Category:Colorado Rockies]]\n", "name_user": "Gonnym", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Losing_Edge"}

It is the 36th episode to be aired, and the first aired episode produced for the season. The episode is rated TV-PG-DV on Fox and TV-14 on [[Adult Swim]]. It was written by [[Mark Hentemann]] and directed by [[Pete Michels]], both firsts in the ''Family Guy'' series.\n\nThe scenes in this episode featuring slow motion use more frames of animation than other scenes. The episode features guest performances of [[Michael Chiklis]], [[Gary Cole]], [[Hugh Downs]], [[Ralph Garman]], D.D. Howard, [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Josh Peck]], [[Tara Strong]], [[Nicole Sullivan]], [[Abe Vigoda]], and [[Lisa Wilhoit]], as well as several recurring voice actors for the series.\n\n==Plot summary==\nChannel 5 announces that they want two high school interns. [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], who has a crush on news anchor [[Tom Tucker (Family Guy)|Tom Tucker]], applies and is selected entirely due to her perceived unattractiveness. The other intern turns out to be [[Neil Goldman (Family Guy)|Neil Goldman]], who himself has a crush on Meg, but she does not feel the same way. When the Mass Media Murderer threatens to kill [[Hugh Downs]] atop City Hall, Tom and Diane decide to send the interns to cover the event (rather than go themselves, thinking that the Murderer will kill anyone who arrives at the scene). The news copter is shot down. Fearing death and lamenting that she never got her first kiss, Meg kisses Neil (envisioning Tom Tucker), but Hugh Downs captures the Mass Media Murderer. That night, Neil shows the kiss on the news but does not mention that she only kissed him because she thought she was going to die. Because of this, everyone now thinks that he and Meg are a couple. The next day, Neil gives everyone at school a T-shirt showing the kiss, and later in the night, Meg has to suffer through a dinner with his parents. In return, she goes on TV to declare that she hates Neil Goldman, and that she only kissed him because she thought she was going to die. She then conducts on-the-street interviews, asking if anyone would kiss Neil. No one would; not even his own father Mort. A very despondent Neil threatens to jump off the City Hall roof. Meg's image of Tom Tucker is shattered when she realizes he does not want to save Neil, but just get a funny story for ratings. Neil falls, but Meg breaks his fall. She tells him that just because she does not like him, it does not mean she wants him to kill himself. Neil tells her that he did not want to kill himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter and [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] buy [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] a [[tricycle]], which Stewie absolutely loves. A bully steals Stewie's tricycle. He gets no help from the police and, when he attempts to bulk up to fight the bully, a gym just tries to hard-sell him a membership. In retaliation, Stewie captures the bully with a net launcher and ties him up in the basement to interrogate him. However, just as Stewie is about to start torturing the bully, Lois appears with the tricycle, which she found abandoned on the street.\n\nIn another subplot, at the beginning of the episode, a man calls Peter a phony, because he pretended to play a keyboard to a pre-recorded soundtrack at the toy store where Stewie's tricycle is bought. The man then proceeds to paint PHONY on Peter's car and humiliate him in public. The episode ends with the man calling Neil a phony when he reveals he was never planning to jump.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Mark Hentemann by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Mark Hentemann wrote his first episode.]]\nThis episode was written by [[Mark Hentemann]] and directed by [[Pete Michels]], both firsts in the ''Family Guy'' series, during the course of the [[Family Guy (season 3)|third production season]].\n\nIn addition to the regular cast, [[Michael Chiklis]], [[Hugh Downs]], [[Josh Peck]], [[Abe Vigoda]]; Voice Actors: [[Gary Cole]],  [[Ralph Garman]],  D.D.

It is the 14th episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' to be aired. It was the last episode produced for season one but aired in season two.\n__NOTOC__\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[Lois Griffin|Lois]] is named director of the Quahog Players theater group production upon the previous director's death, and she decides to produce ''[[The King and I]]''. When [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] auditions poorly for the show with the theme song to ''[[Land of the Lost (1974 TV series)|Land of the Lost]]'', Lois names him producer in the hopes of keeping him out of the way, but Peter gradually takes over, radically changing the play. He gets the play mentioned on the news by casting newscaster [[List of Family Guy characters#Quahog Channel 5 News|Diane Simmons]] as [[Anna Leonowens]], trying his best to make the play perfect for Lois and him.\n\nPeter also adds material inspired by ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' and ''[[Flashdance]]''. Later Lois finds everyone discussing on a \"brilliant\" idea Peter has had, the Siamese children (being children from [[Siam]]) are not children, but aliens. Everyone agrees to the idea, but Lois hates it. It then turns out that Peter's ideas for the play are actually helping its popularity, in fact, the play becomes sold out. Instead of cheering like everyone else, Lois quits out of extreme anger over Peter and leaves him as the director. Lois tries to get back at Peter by making \"creative changes\" to his breakfast (like adding fish and undone eggs). Peter's constant changes frustrate Diane into quitting, so he plays Anna himself.\n\nPeter\u2019s version of ''The King and I'' depicts a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic future]] set in the ruined world of 2015 after the ninth nuclear world war (''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' reference). The world \"is a grim future filled with lots of explosions and partial nudity\", ruled by an oppressive King, played by [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]. ANNA is an \"'''A'''utomaton '''N'''uclear '''N'''eo-human '''A'''ndroid\", a [[robot]] [[ninja]] from the planet [[England]] sent to rid the world of the King's tyranny. ANNA, not confused by the bikini-clad Siamese \"children's\" (actually women) all-female sex orgy, [[kung fu (term)|kung fu]] fights with the King and defeats him, changing Siam into the [[United States|United States of America]].\n\nLois attends the premiere, but to her surprise, the show is a hit. She then scolds the audience for applauding the show, claiming that the show is an example of pure trash. She seemingly embarrasses Peter, but Peter then lets out an astonishingly long [[fart]] on stage that everyone hears, and they clap again, completely ignoring Lois, and making Peter one of the most popular people in Quahog. Later, Peter comes back from a celebration party, but thanks Lois for giving him the chance to express himself and making the show possible (as if she had quit to make him popular, though it is clear that she did this to get him humiliated). Lois, feeling a bit guilty for the way she acted, admits she was not supportive of Peter's work, and also admits that the show must have been good in the way that people found it entertaining. Peter is touched by her words and promises to get her the job as director again next year, then immediately asks, \"Hey, were you there when I farted?\"\n\n==Reception==\nIn his 2008 review, Ahsan Haque of [[IGN]], rating the episode a 9/10, said that \"The King Is Dead\" is \"entertaining from start to finish\" and it has \"very little filler material\". He also noted that the episode contains \"countless sight-gags and some subtle references that can only be caught after repeated viewings\".<ref name=ign>{{cite web |author=Haque, Ahsan |title=Family Guy: \"The King Is Dead\" Review |publisher=IGN |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/902/902783p1.html |accessdate=2009-12-02 |date=26 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* Callaghan, Steve. \u201cThe King Is Dead.\u201d ''Family Guy: The Official Episode Guide Seasons 1\u20133''.

Peter's constant changes frustrate Diane into quitting, so he plays Anna himself.\n\nPeter\u2019s version of ''The King and I'' depicts a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic future]] set in the ruined world of 2015 after the ninth nuclear world war (''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' reference). The world \"is a grim future filled with lots of explosions and partial nudity\", ruled by an oppressive King, played by [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]. ANNA is an \"'''A'''utomaton '''N'''uclear '''N'''eo-human '''A'''ndroid\", a [[robot]] [[ninja]] from the planet [[England]] sent to rid the world of the King's tyranny. ANNA, not confused by the bikini-clad Siamese \"children's\" (actually women) all-female sex orgy, [[kung fu (term)|kung fu]] fights with the King and defeats him, changing Siam into the [[United States|United States of America]].\n\nLois attends the premiere, but to her surprise, the show is a hit. She then scolds the audience for applauding the show, claiming that the show is an example of pure trash. She seemingly embarrasses Peter, but Peter then lets out an astonishingly long [[fart]] on stage that everyone hears, and they clap again, completely ignoring Lois, and making Peter one of the most popular people in Quahog. Later, Peter comes back from a celebration party, but thanks Lois for giving him the chance to express himself and making the show possible (as if she had quit to make him popular, though it is clear that she did this to get him humiliated). Lois, feeling a bit guilty for the way she acted, admits she was not supportive of Peter's work, and also admits that the show must have been good in the way that people found it entertaining. Peter is touched by her words and promises to get her the job as director again next year, then immediately asks, \"Hey, were you there when I farted?\"\n\n==Reception==\nIn his 2008 review, Ahsan Haque of [[IGN]], rating the episode a 9/10, said that \"The King Is Dead\" is \"entertaining from start to finish\" and it has \"very little filler material\". He also noted that the episode contains \"countless sight-gags and some subtle references that can only be caught after repeated viewings\".<ref name=ign>{{cite web |author=Haque, Ahsan |title=Family Guy: \"The King Is Dead\" Review |publisher=IGN |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/902/902783p1.html |accessdate=2009-12-02 |date=26 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* Callaghan, Steve. \u201cThe King Is Dead.\u201d ''Family Guy: The Official Episode Guide Seasons 1\u20133''.

The road connects Tennessee's three largest cities\u2014[[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]\u2014and crosses all of Tennessee's physiographical provinces and [[Grand Divisions of Tennessee|Grand Divisions]]\u2014the [[Mississippi Embayment]] and [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in [[West Tennessee]], the [[Highland Rim]] and [[Nashville Basin]] in [[Middle Tennessee]], and the [[Cumberland Plateau]], [[Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province]], and [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge Province]] in [[East Tennessee]]. The Tennessee section of I-40 is {{convert|452|mi|km}} long, the longest of any state on the route.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===West Tennessee===\n====Memphis====\n[[File:Hernando de Soto Bridge Memphis.jpg|thumb|left|The Hernando de Soto Bridge, where I-40 crosses the [[Mississippi River]] into [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]]]\n\nI-40 enters Tennessee via the six lane [[Hernando de Soto Bridge]], which spans the Mississippi River at river mile 736. Immediately within the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the interstate passes across the southern half of [[Mud Island, Memphis|Mud Island]] before crossing the [[Wolf River (Tennessee)|Wolf River Harbor]] into downtown Memphis. Throughout Memphis, the highway contains a minimum of six through lanes, except through major interchanges. Upon reaching Memphis, I-40 immediately has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 51 in Tennessee|U.S. Route&nbsp;51]] (US&nbsp;51), and {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} from the state line is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]], where I-40 abruptly turns north, following a route formerly designated as part of I-240. (For the next {{convert|10|mi|km|disp=sqbr}}, this segment is designated as the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Expressway.) About one mile later, I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 14|State Route 14]] (SR&nbsp;14, Jackson Avenue), and about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, the highway crosses the Wolf River again and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Tennessee State Route 300|SR&nbsp;300]], a controlled-access connector to US&nbsp;51. At this interchange, the Interstate turns sharp east. Passing first near the neighborhoods of [[Frayser, Memphis|Frayser]] and [[Raleigh, Memphis|Raleigh]], about {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} later, I-40 crosses the Wolf River for a third time as the highway turns southeast, and has an interchange with SR&nbsp;14 again. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 204|SR&nbsp;204]] (Covington Pike), and {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, I-40 comes to a complicated interchange with [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;64]]/[[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;70]]/[[U.S. Route 79 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;79]], I-240 southbound and Sam Cooper Boulevard eastbound, and turns sharp northeast, leaving Memphis. For the next several miles the highway is known as the Isaac Hayes Memorial Highway and is eight lanes, the left lanes functioning as [[HOV lane]]s during [[rush hour]], passing through several major suburbs of Memphis, including [[Bartlett, Tennessee|Bartlett]], [[Cordova, Tennessee|Cordova]], and [[Lakeland, Tennessee|Lakeland]]. At exit 18, which is US&nbsp;64, the highway narrows to six lanes, and to four lanes a short distance beyond. Several miles later, near [[Arlington, Tennessee|Arlington]], at exit 24, is a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[Interstate 269|I-269]]/[[Tennessee State Route 385|SR&nbsp;385]].\n\n====Gulf coastal plain====\n\nAbout one mile east of Arlington, I-40 enters [[Fayette County, Tennessee|Fayette County]], and about another mile later crosses the [[Loosahatchie River]] and leaves the Memphis area, traversing through the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in a very flat and straight stretch of mostly farmland with some rural woodlands, bypassing most cities and communities. At exit 35 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 59|SR 59]], which connects to [[Covington, Tennessee|Covington]] and  [[Somerville, Tennessee|Somerville]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Haywood County, Tennessee|Haywood County]], and about {{convert|10|mi|km}} later, the highway turns north and enters the [[Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge]] and crosses the [[Hatchie River]]. Upon exiting the refuge about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, I-40 turns east and passes just southeast of Brownsville, where it has an interchange first with [[Tennessee State Route 76|SR 76]], which also connects to Somerville. Eight miles later is an interchange with US 70, and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]]. Entering [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], at mile marker 78, the crosses the [[South Fork of the Forked Deer River|South Fork]] of the [[Forked Deer River]]. Passing through the northern half of the city, I-40 has a total of six exits in Jackson. First, at mile 79, is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 412 in Tennessee|US 412]] (which connects to [[Alamo, Tennessee|Alamo]] and [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]]), then about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later an interchange with the [[Tennessee State Route 186#U.S. Route 45 Bypass|US 45 Bypass]]. About {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 45|US 45]], which also connects to [[Humboldt, Tennessee|Humboldt]] and [[Milan, Tennessee|Milan]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70, which also connects to Huntington, Tennessee|Huntington]], and I-40 leaves Jackson at this point. From this point, I-40 continues east northeast through a sparsely populated area of farmland and woodlands, and about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later enters [[Henderson County, Tennessee|Henderson County]]. About {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, near the community of [[Parkers Crossroads, Tennessee|Parkers Crossroads]], I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 22|SR 22]], a major north-south connector route in west Tennessee, which, at this interchange, is signed as a connector to [[Lexington, Tennessee|Lexington]] and Huntington. A few miles later, I-40 crosses the [[Big Sandy River (Tennessee)|Big Sandy River]] before proceeding through the northern half of the [[Natchez Trace State Park]], and around milepost 120 enters [[Decatur County, Tennessee|Decatur County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 641|US 641]]/[[Tennessee State Route 69|SR 69]], another major north-south corridor, which at this point connects to [[Camden, Tennessee|Camden]] and [[Decaturville, Tennessee|Decaturville]]. I-40 then enters [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]], and about {{convert|6|mi|km}} later,   descends about {{convert|400|ft|m}} on a steep grade over the course of a mile, the westbound lanes gaining a [[truck climbing lane]], before crossing the [[Tennessee River]] into [[Middle Tennessee]] on the {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} [[Jimmy Mann Evans Memorial Bridge]]. This river crossing is also located within the [[Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n===Middle Tennessee===\n====Western highland rim====\n\nUpon crossing the Tennessee River into [[Humphreys County, Tennessee|Humphreys County]], I-40 traverses through mostly vast woodlands in the rugged hills of the Western [[Highland Rim]] for a considerable distance. This section is characterized by several noticeable upgrades and downgrades, with mostly minor curves. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} beyond the Tennessee River is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 13|SR 13]], which connects to [[Linden, Tennessee|Linden]] and [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]]. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 crosses into [[Hickman County, Tennessee|Hickman County]] and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 50|SR 50]], which connects to [[Centerville, Tennessee|Centerville]]. I-40 then crosses the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]], traveling through mostly wooded areas characterized by further rugged terrain, and at mile 163 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 48|SR 48]], the first exit for [[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]]. I-40 then enters [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]], and shortly beyond this point crosses the [[Piney River (Middle Tennessee)|Piney River]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]], the second Dickson exit which also connects to Centerville and [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]]. Approaching the urban parts of the [[Nashville metropolitan area]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]], the outer southern beltway around Nashville. The highway continues through mostly woodlands and rugged terrain, and crossing into [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], I-40 briefly enters a steep ascent, gaining a truck climbing lane on the eastbound side, and {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond I-840 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]], which connects to the Nashville suburbs of [[Fairview, Tennessee|Fairview]] and [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]. A few miles later, I-40 enters [[Cheatham County, Tennessee|Cheatham County]], and descends into the [[Nashville Basin]] between mile markers 186 and 188, and still in a predominantly rural area, has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 248|SR 248]] in [[Kingston Springs, Tennessee|Kingston Springs]]. I-40 the crosses the [[Harpeth River]] twice over a distsnce of about {{convert|1|mi|km}}.\n\n====Nashville====\n[[File:Destinations from Interstate 40-65 (Exit 209, 209A, 209B) in Nashville.JPG|thumb|right|Destination sign for exit 209/209A/209B in Nashville ]]\nAround milepost 191, I-40 enters [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], and a few miles later crosses the Harpeth River for a third time. About a mile later, near\n[[Bellevue, Tennessee|Bellevue]], I-40 widens to six lanes, entering the urban outskirts of Nashville, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]]. Three miles later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 251|SR 251]] ([[Old Hickory Boulevard]]), and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70. Widening to eight lanes, three miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 155|SR 155]] (Briley Pkwy, White Bridge Road), including the western terminus of the northern controlled-access beltway around Nashville. About two miles later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|I-440]], the southern loop around central Nashville. Two miles later, I-40 enters [[Downtown Nashville]], and begins a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]], turning southeast. As part of the route around downtown Nashville known locally as the Downtown Loop, the two concurrent routs have interchanges with US 70 (Charlotte Avenue) and US 70S/[[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|431]] (Broadway), as well as two surface streets, Church Street and Demonbreun Street. About two miles later the two concurrent routes turn east northeast, and I-65 splits off and heads south. Briefly on its own for about {{convert|1|mi|km}}, I-40 crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31A|US 31A]]/[[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee\u2013Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41A]] (4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue), before beginning a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 24#Tennessee|I-24]] and turning southeast. About {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-24 splits off, and I-40 turns east. The eastern terminus of I-440 is also directly accessible from the east bound lanes of I-40 at this interchange, and [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]], which crosses I-24 before this interchange, is also directly accessible from I-40 at this interchange.\n\n[[File:Interstate 40 @ Beckwith.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 near Mount Juliet, east of Nashville]]\nAbout {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with SR 155 (Briley Parkway) near the [[Nashville International Airport]], and about a mile later, the eastbound lanes have a direct access partial-y exit to a surface road to the airport. The westbound lanes of I-40 are only accessible from this interchange. Less than a half mile later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 255|SR 255]] (Donelson Pike), and beginning here, the left lanes of I-40 function as HOV lanes during rush hour. Passing near [[J. Percy Priest Dam]], I-40 has an interchange with Stewarts Ferry Pike, then crosses the [[Stones River]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 45|SR 45]] (Old Hickory Boulevard). Also at this interchange is a separate partial y interchange which provides access to SR 45 via a bypass which junctions with SR 45 about {{convert|3/4|mi|km}} north of I-40. This bypass is only accessible via the eastbound lanes of I-40, and the westbound lanes are only accessible from it. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and few miles later has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 171|SR 171]] near the Nashville suburb of [[Mount Juliet, Tennessee|Mount Juliet]]. Six miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]], which connects to [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]].  About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later and about {{convert|25|mi|km}} east of Nashville, the route narrows back to four lanes and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-840 a few miles east of [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]]. I-40 the enters Lebanon and has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]] and US 70.\n\n====Western Highland Rim and Cumberland Plateau====\nFor the next roughly {{convert|50|mi|km}}, I-40 continues across mostly open farmland, passing near mostly small communities. About {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Lebanon, I-40 enters [[Smith County, Tennessee|Smith County]], and less than {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later I-40 begins a steep ascent where the eastbound lanes gain a truck climbing lane. This lane terminates about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} later, and about {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} beyond this point is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 53|SR 53]] near [[Carthage, Tennessee|Carthage]] and [[Gordonsville, Tennessee|Gordonsville]]. Between mileposts 263 and 266, I-40 crosses the meandering [[Caney Fork River]] five times before crossing into [[Putnam County, Tennessee|Putnam County]] and beginning its ascent out of the [[Eastern Highland Rim]] onto the [[Cumberland Plateau]]. At milepost 268, I-40 has an interchange once again with SR 96, and a few miles later reaches an elevation of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} for the first time in the state near [[Silver Point, Tennessee|Silver Point]], and beginning at the edge of the table-top rim at mile marker 272 near [[Baxter, Tennessee|Baxter]], the interstate remains relatively flat across the plateau. I-40 then immediately has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 56|SR 56]] southbound/[[Tennessee State Route 141|SR 141]], which connect to [[Smithville, Tennessee|Smithville]] and [[McMinnville, Tennessee|McMinnville]]. Beginning a concurrency with SR 56 at this point, the latter route splits off {{convert|7|mi|km}} later, heading north towards [[Gainesboro, Tennessee|Gainesboro]]. Reaching [[Cookeville, Tennessee|Cookeville]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has a total of five interchanges,\nincluding with [[Tennessee State Route 111|SR 111]], a major north-south connector to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and US [[U.S. Route 70N|70N]]. Beginning a few miles beyond this point, I-40 begins another steep uphill ascent, protracted over a distance of about {{convert|5|mi}}, reaching an elevation of nearly {{convert|2,000|ft|m}}. Through this section, the speed limit reduces to 65 mph, and 55 mph for trucks on the westbound descent. Continuing through a predominantly wooded area, continues for about {{convert|10|mi|km}} through a predominantly wooded area, before reaching [[Monterey, Tennessee|Monterey]] a few miles later, where the route has two interchanges with US 70N, which contain concurrencies with [[Tennessee State Route 84|SR 84]] and [[Tennessee State Route 62|SR 62]], respectively. A short distance later, I-40 reaches an elevation of over {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} for the first time in Tennessee, before crossing into [[Cumberland County, Tennessee|Cumberland County]] and [[East Tennessee]] about {{convert|1/4|mi|km}}.\n\n===East Tennessee===\n\n====Cumberland Plateau and Tennessee Valley====\n[[File:Cumberland-plateau-i40-tn1.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 descending [[Walden Ridge]], miles 341\u2013346]]\n\nAfter ascending further up into the Walden Ridge/Cumberland Plateau and passing through Monterey, I-40 remains relatively flat and straight as it continues across the Cumberland Plateau. At mile 308, I-40 crosses the [[Tennessee Divide]], where the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Tennessee River]] watersheds meet. The divide is marked in the eastbound lanes with a sign reading \"Entering [[Emory River]] watershed.\" In the westbound counterparts is a sign noting the beginning of the Caney Fork watershed. About ten miles later, I-40 reaches [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville]], and has three interchanges, including one  with [[U.S. Route 127 in Tennessee|US 127]], which also conbects to [[Jamestown, Tennessee|Jamestown]]. \nEast of Crossville, the [[Crab Orchard Mountains]], the southern fringe of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], come into view as the road descends several hundred feet. At mile 329, the interstate enters Crab Orchard Gap and proceeds through a narrow valley once prone to [[landslide|rockslide]]s. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with US 70 near the town of [[Crab Orchard, Tennessee|Crab Orchard]]. Beyond this point, the Interstate descends into a short depression before crossing into [[Roane County, Tennessee|Roane County]] and mile 340, entering the [[Eastern Time Zone]]. Shortly thereafter the road begins its descent of the Cumberland Plateau into the [[Tennessee Valley]] and the speed limit drops to 60&nbsp;mph in the eastbound lanes. I-40 hugs the slopes of the plateau's [[Walden Ridge]] escarpment for several miles, containing what some describe as dramatic views of the Tennessee Valley below to the south, before reaching the base of the plateau at mile 347 between [[Harriman, Tennessee|Harriman]] and [[Rockwood, Tennessee|Rockwood]], and containing an interchange with [[U.S. Route 27 in Tennessee|US 27]]. As it enters the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|Ridge-and-Valley]] province of the Appalachians, of which the Tennessee Valley is a part, I-40 crosses a series of ridges and valleys characteristic of the region's topography. About {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 29|SR 29]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, the road crosses the Clinch River, with the [[Kingston Fossil Plant]] and its {{convert|1,000|ft|m|adj=on}} twin smokestacks dominating the view to the north. About {{convert|1|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 58|SR 58]] southbound in [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]], and at this point, I-40 begins a brief concurrency with SR 58. After ascending a short and relatively steep ridge out of the Clinch River Valley, SR 58 splits off to the north about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, heading towards [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]]. Continuing through the relatively rugged terrain of the Great Appalachian Valley and crossing additional ridges, I-40 crosses into [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon County]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 321|US 321]]/[[Tennessee State Route 95|SR 95]] near Lenoir city, before reaching I-75 about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Knoxville====\n{{See also|Interstate 75 in Tennessee#Knoxville}}\n[[File:TN I40 East-I75 North West Knoxville.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 concurrent with I-75 in Knoxville]]\nAt exit 368, about 20 miles west southwest of downtown Knoxville, I-40 merges with [[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]], which continues to the southwest to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and the two routes turn east northeast, carrying six through lanes, and cross into [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox County]] a short distance later. Throughout this concurrency, exits are numbered according to I-40 mileage. The two highways pass through several of the western suburbs of Knoxville,  including [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]], and have interchanges with a few surface streets. At exit 374 ([[Tennessee State Route 131|SR 131]]/Lovell Road), the highway widens to eight lanes and at the next exit, about {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} later, is an interchange with the [[Pellissippi Parkway]] (SR 162 westbound, I-140 eastbound), which connects to Oak Ridge and [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]], respectively. Continuing through western Knoxville, the two rputes have interchanges with additional surface streets, before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11 in Tennessee|US 11]]/70 {{convert|4|mi|km}} later near the [[West Hills, Knoxville|West Hills]] neighborhood. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 332|SR 332]] (Northshore Drive), and the separate Papermill Drive and Weisgarber Road. Two miles later, at exit 385, is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 640|I-640]], a beltway which passes northwest of downtown Knoxville. Also at this exit, I-75 splits off from I-40 onto a concurrency with I-640, splitting off a few miles later and heading towards [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. The route then enters downtown Knoxville, containing a minimum of six through lanes through the entirety of central Knoxville, as well as several short segments of [[auxiliary lane]]s between exits. Passing near the main campus of the [[University of Tennessee]], as well as several residential neighborhoods, about \n{{convert|1.5|mi|km}} past I-640 is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 129 in Tennessee|US 129]], which connects to [[McGhee Tyson Airport]] and is a route to the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. One mile later is an interchange with SR 62 (Western Avenue), and a mile beyond this point is an interchange with [[Interstate 275 (Tennessee)|I-275]]. About {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} later, in a complicated interchange, I-40 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 441 in Tennessee|US 441]] south (Henley Street), and begins a brief concurrency with this route, which splits off about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, along with [[Tennessee State Route 158|SR 158]] westbound, as controlled-access [[James White Parkway]]. I-40 then curves sharp north, and about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, sharp east again before coming to an interchange with a connector road to US 441. I-40 then crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with a surface street before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11W|US 11W]] (Rutledge Pike). The highway then enters a predominantly residential area, passing next to the [[Knoxville Zoo]], before coming to an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-640 and leaving Knoxville less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later. Also at this interchange, I-40 begins a brief (unsigned) concurrency with [[U.S. Route 25W|US 25W]], which splits off a little over {{convert|1|mi|km}} later at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11E|US 11E]]/70 (Asheville Highway). Leaving Knoxville, I-40 crosses the [[Holston River]] about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Smoky Mountains and Pigeon River gorge====\n[[File:Mount-cammerer-I40-tn1.jpg|thumb|right|I-40 near mile 441, with [[Mount Cammerer]] rising in the distance]]\nContinuing east as a six-lane highway, I-40 travels through a semi-rural residential area before crossing into [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]]. A few miles later, at exit 407, near [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]], I-40 has an interchange with the northern terminus of the [[Great Smoky Mountains Parkway]] ([[Tennessee State Route 66|SR 66]]). This interchange is the primary means of access to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, as well as the tourist attractions in the cities of Sevierville, [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]] and [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]], and, as a result, is reportedly one of the busiest and most congested non-interstate exits in the state. A few miles later, I-40 crosses into [[Jefferson County, Tennessee|Jefferson County]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US25W/70 in [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]]. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 92|SR 92]], also in Dandridge. Four miles later, at exit 421 is the interchange with the southern terminus of [[Interstate 81 in Tennessee|I-81]], which runs into [[Northeast Tennessee]] to the so called \"[[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]]\" of [[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]], [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]], and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]]. At this interchange, I-40 reduces back to four lanes and turns sharp southeast, crossing the [[Douglas Dam]] impoundment of the [[French Broad River]] about {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} later, as well as into [[Cocke County, Tennessee|Cocke County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 411 in Tennessee|US 411]]/70S/25 near [[Newport, Tennessee|Newport]]. Traveling along the northern base of English Mountain for a few miles, I-40 has an interchange with US 321 three miles later. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later the road has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 73|SR 73]] near [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]], and turns south through the gap between English Mountain and Stone Mountain, revealing a dramatic view of the {{convert|4928|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Mount Cammerer]] at the northeastern end of the Great Smokies range. Also at this point, I-40 enters thr [[Cherokee National Forest]] and proceeds into the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee\u2013North Carolina)|Pigeon River Gorge]] through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], closely following the north bank of the river. This section is extremely curvy and the speed limit reduces to 55&nbsp;mph due to its susceptibility to accidents. This stretch is also prone to rockslides, and contains mesh nets along some of the cliff slopes as preventative measures. A few miles later I-40 crosses the Pigeon River and has an interchange with the [[Foothills Parkway]], before crossing the pigeon river again about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later and curving sharply to the east. A bout {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, the route curves to the south again near the unincorporated community of [[Hartford, Tennessee|Hartford]] before entering North Carolina about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n===Music Highway===\nThe term '''Music Highway''' refers to a section of I-40 between Memphis and Nashville. I-40 was designated as such by an act of the Tennessee Legislature in 1997 \"from the eastern boundary of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] to the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]],\" a distance of about {{convert|222|mi|km}}. I-40 is designated as such because of the rich music history in Memphis, Nashville, and the areas in between. Memphis is known as \"the Home of the Blues and the Birthplace of Rock and Roll.\" Nashville is known as \"Music City USA\" for its influence on numerous types of music, especially [[Country music|country]]. Several cities and towns between the two, such as [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], [[Brownsville, Tennessee|Brownsville]], [[Nutbush, Tennessee|Nutbush]], [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]] and others were birthplaces or homes of numerous singers and songwriters. Signs that display the words \"Music Highway\" along with music notes are erected in both directions along I-40, especially at the borders of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] and [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]].<ref name=MH>{{cite web |url = http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |title = Public Chapter 124 Senate Bill No. 122 |publisher = State of Tennessee |access-date = September 26, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111014104711/http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |archive-date = October 14, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Construction and early history===\n\nThe Tennessee leg of I-40 was part of the original {{convert|1047|mi|km}} of Interstate Highways authorized for Tennessee by the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]].

The road connects Tennessee's three largest cities\u2014[[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]\u2014and crosses all of Tennessee's physiographical provinces and [[Grand Divisions of Tennessee|Grand Divisions]]\u2014the [[Mississippi Embayment]] and [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in [[West Tennessee]], the [[Highland Rim]] and [[Nashville Basin]] in [[Middle Tennessee]], and the [[Cumberland Plateau]], [[Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province]], and [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge Province]] in [[East Tennessee]]. The Tennessee section of I-40 is {{convert|452|mi|km}} long, the longest of any state on the route.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===West Tennessee===\n====Memphis====\n[[File:Hernando de Soto Bridge Memphis.jpg|thumb|left|The Hernando de Soto Bridge, where I-40 crosses the [[Mississippi River]] into [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]]]\n\nI-40 enters Tennessee via the six lane [[Hernando de Soto Bridge]], which spans the Mississippi River at river mile 736. Immediately within the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the interstate passes across the southern half of [[Mud Island, Memphis|Mud Island]] before crossing the [[Wolf River (Tennessee)|Wolf River Harbor]] into downtown Memphis. Throughout Memphis, the highway contains a minimum of six through lanes, except through major interchanges. Upon reaching Memphis, I-40 immediately has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 51 in Tennessee|U.S. Route&nbsp;51]] (US&nbsp;51), and {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} from the state line is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]], where I-40 abruptly turns north, following a route formerly designated as part of I-240. (For the next {{convert|10|mi|km|disp=sqbr}}, this segment is designated as the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Expressway.) About one mile later, I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 14|State Route 14]] (SR&nbsp;14, Jackson Avenue), and about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, the highway crosses the Wolf River again and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Tennessee State Route 300|SR&nbsp;300]], a controlled-access connector to US&nbsp;51. At this interchange, the Interstate turns sharp east. Passing first near the neighborhoods of [[Frayser, Memphis|Frayser]] and [[Raleigh, Memphis|Raleigh]], about {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} later, I-40 crosses the Wolf River for a third time as the highway turns southeast, and has an interchange with SR&nbsp;14 again. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 204|SR&nbsp;204]] (Covington Pike), and {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, I-40 comes to a complicated interchange with [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;64]]/[[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;70]]/[[U.S. Route 79 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;79]], I-240 southbound and Sam Cooper Boulevard eastbound, and turns sharp northeast, leaving Memphis. For the next several miles the highway is known as the Isaac Hayes Memorial Highway and is eight lanes, the left lanes functioning as [[HOV lane]]s during [[rush hour]], passing through several major suburbs of Memphis, including [[Bartlett, Tennessee|Bartlett]], [[Cordova, Tennessee|Cordova]], and [[Lakeland, Tennessee|Lakeland]]. At exit 18, which is US&nbsp;64, the highway narrows to six lanes, and to four lanes a short distance beyond. Several miles later, near [[Arlington, Tennessee|Arlington]], at exit 24, is a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[Interstate 269|I-269]]/[[Tennessee State Route 385|SR&nbsp;385]].\n\n====Gulf coastal plain====\n\nAbout one mile east of Arlington, I-40 enters [[Fayette County, Tennessee|Fayette County]], and about another mile later crosses the [[Loosahatchie River]] and leaves the Memphis area, traversing through the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in a very flat and straight stretch of mostly farmland with some rural woodlands, bypassing most cities and communities. At exit 35 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 59|SR 59]], which connects to [[Covington, Tennessee|Covington]] and  [[Somerville, Tennessee|Somerville]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Haywood County, Tennessee|Haywood County]], and about {{convert|10|mi|km}} later, the highway turns north and enters the [[Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge]] and crosses the [[Hatchie River]]. Upon exiting the refuge about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, I-40 turns east and passes just southeast of Brownsville, where it has an interchange first with [[Tennessee State Route 76|SR 76]], which also connects to Somerville. Eight miles later is an interchange with US 70, and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]]. Entering [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], at mile marker 78, the crosses the [[South Fork of the Forked Deer River|South Fork]] of the [[Forked Deer River]]. Passing through the northern half of the city, I-40 has a total of six exits in Jackson. First, at mile 79, is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 412 in Tennessee|US 412]] (which connects to [[Alamo, Tennessee|Alamo]] and [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]]), then about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later an interchange with the [[Tennessee State Route 186#U.S. Route 45 Bypass|US 45 Bypass]]. About {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 45|US 45]], which also connects to [[Humboldt, Tennessee|Humboldt]] and [[Milan, Tennessee|Milan]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70, which also connects to Huntington, Tennessee|Huntington]], and I-40 leaves Jackson at this point. From this point, I-40 continues east northeast through a sparsely populated area of farmland and woodlands, and about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later enters [[Henderson County, Tennessee|Henderson County]]. About {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, near the community of [[Parkers Crossroads, Tennessee|Parkers Crossroads]], I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 22|SR 22]], a major north-south connector route in west Tennessee, which, at this interchange, is signed as a connector to [[Lexington, Tennessee|Lexington]] and Huntington. A few miles later, I-40 crosses the [[Big Sandy River (Tennessee)|Big Sandy River]] before proceeding through the northern half of the [[Natchez Trace State Park]], and around milepost 120 enters [[Decatur County, Tennessee|Decatur County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 641|US 641]]/[[Tennessee State Route 69|SR 69]], another major north-south corridor, which at this point connects to [[Camden, Tennessee|Camden]] and [[Decaturville, Tennessee|Decaturville]]. I-40 then enters [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]], and about {{convert|6|mi|km}} later,   descends about {{convert|400|ft|m}} on a steep grade over the course of a mile, the westbound lanes gaining a [[truck climbing lane]], before crossing the [[Tennessee River]] into [[Middle Tennessee]] on the {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} [[Jimmy Mann Evans Memorial Bridge]]. This river crossing is also located within the [[Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n===Middle Tennessee===\n====Western highland rim====\n\nUpon crossing the Tennessee River into [[Humphreys County, Tennessee|Humphreys County]], I-40 traverses through mostly vast woodlands in the rugged hills of the Western [[Highland Rim]] for a considerable distance. This section is characterized by several noticeable upgrades and downgrades, with mostly minor curves. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} beyond the Tennessee River is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 13|SR 13]], which connects to [[Linden, Tennessee|Linden]] and [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]]. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 crosses into [[Hickman County, Tennessee|Hickman County]] and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 50|SR 50]], which connects to [[Centerville, Tennessee|Centerville]]. I-40 then crosses the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]], traveling through mostly wooded areas characterized by further rugged terrain, and at mile 163 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 48|SR 48]], the first exit for [[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]]. I-40 then enters [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]], and shortly beyond this point crosses the [[Piney River (Middle Tennessee)|Piney River]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]], the second Dickson exit which also connects to Centerville and [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]]. Approaching the urban parts of the [[Nashville metropolitan area]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]], the outer southern beltway around Nashville. The highway continues through mostly woodlands and rugged terrain, and crossing into [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], I-40 briefly enters a steep ascent, gaining a truck climbing lane on the eastbound side, and {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond I-840 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]], which connects to the Nashville suburbs of [[Fairview, Tennessee|Fairview]] and [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]. A few miles later, I-40 enters [[Cheatham County, Tennessee|Cheatham County]], and descends into the [[Nashville Basin]] between mile markers 186 and 188, and still in a predominantly rural area, has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 248|SR 248]] in [[Kingston Springs, Tennessee|Kingston Springs]]. I-40 the crosses the [[Harpeth River]] twice over a distsnce of about {{convert|1|mi|km}}.\n\n====Nashville====\n[[File:Destinations from Interstate 40-65 (Exit 209, 209A, 209B) in Nashville.JPG|thumb|right|Destination sign for exit 209/209A/209B in Nashville ]]\nAround milepost 191, I-40 enters [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], and a few miles later crosses the Harpeth River for a third time. About a mile later, near\n[[Bellevue, Tennessee|Bellevue]], I-40 widens to six lanes, entering the urban outskirts of Nashville, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]]. Three miles later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 251|SR 251]] ([[Old Hickory Boulevard]]), and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70. Widening to eight lanes, three miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 155|SR 155]] (Briley Pkwy, White Bridge Road), including the western terminus of the northern controlled-access beltway around Nashville. About two miles later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|I-440]], the southern loop around central Nashville. Two miles later, I-40 enters [[Downtown Nashville]], and begins a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]], turning southeast. As part of the route around downtown Nashville known locally as the Downtown Loop, the two concurrent routs have interchanges with US 70 (Charlotte Avenue) and US 70S/[[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|431]] (Broadway), as well as two surface streets, Church Street and Demonbreun Street. About two miles later the two concurrent routes turn east northeast, and I-65 splits off and heads south. Briefly on its own for about {{convert|1|mi|km}}, I-40 crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31A|US 31A]]/[[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee\u2013Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41A]] (4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue), before beginning a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 24#Tennessee|I-24]] and turning southeast. About {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-24 splits off, and I-40 turns east. The eastern terminus of I-440 is also directly accessible from the east bound lanes of I-40 at this interchange, and [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]], which crosses I-24 before this interchange, is also directly accessible from I-40 at this interchange.\n\n[[File:Interstate 40 @ Beckwith.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 near Mount Juliet, east of Nashville]]\nAbout {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with SR 155 (Briley Parkway) near the [[Nashville International Airport]], and about a mile later, the eastbound lanes have a direct access partial-y exit to a surface road to the airport. The westbound lanes of I-40 are only accessible from this interchange. Less than a half mile later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 255|SR 255]] (Donelson Pike), and beginning here, the left lanes of I-40 function as HOV lanes during rush hour. Passing near [[J. Percy Priest Dam]], I-40 has an interchange with Stewarts Ferry Pike, then crosses the [[Stones River]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 45|SR 45]] (Old Hickory Boulevard). Also at this interchange is a separate partial y interchange which provides access to SR 45 via a bypass which junctions with SR 45 about {{convert|3/4|mi|km}} north of I-40. This bypass is only accessible via the eastbound lanes of I-40, and the westbound lanes are only accessible from it. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and few miles later has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 171|SR 171]] near the Nashville suburb of [[Mount Juliet, Tennessee|Mount Juliet]]. Six miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]], which connects to [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]].  About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later and about {{convert|25|mi|km}} east of Nashville, the route narrows back to four lanes and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-840 a few miles east of [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]]. I-40 the enters Lebanon and has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]] and US 70.\n\n====Western Highland Rim and Cumberland Plateau====\nFor the next roughly {{convert|50|mi|km}}, I-40 continues across mostly open farmland, passing near mostly small communities. About {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Lebanon, I-40 enters [[Smith County, Tennessee|Smith County]], and less than {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later I-40 begins a steep ascent where the eastbound lanes gain a truck climbing lane. This lane terminates about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} later, and about {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} beyond this point is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 53|SR 53]] near [[Carthage, Tennessee|Carthage]] and [[Gordonsville, Tennessee|Gordonsville]]. Between mileposts 263 and 266, I-40 crosses the meandering [[Caney Fork River]] five times before crossing into [[Putnam County, Tennessee|Putnam County]] and beginning its ascent out of the [[Eastern Highland Rim]] onto the [[Cumberland Plateau]]. At milepost 268, I-40 has an interchange once again with SR 96, and a few miles later reaches an elevation of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} for the first time in the state near [[Silver Point, Tennessee|Silver Point]], and beginning at the edge of the table-top rim at mile marker 272 near [[Baxter, Tennessee|Baxter]], the interstate remains relatively flat across the plateau. I-40 then immediately has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 56|SR 56]] southbound/[[Tennessee State Route 141|SR 141]], which connect to [[Smithville, Tennessee|Smithville]] and [[McMinnville, Tennessee|McMinnville]]. Beginning a concurrency with SR 56 at this point, the latter route splits off {{convert|7|mi|km}} later, heading north towards [[Gainesboro, Tennessee|Gainesboro]]. Reaching [[Cookeville, Tennessee|Cookeville]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has a total of five interchanges,\nincluding with [[Tennessee State Route 111|SR 111]], a major north-south connector to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and US [[U.S. Route 70N|70N]]. Beginning a few miles beyond this point, I-40 begins another steep uphill ascent, protracted over a distance of about {{convert|5|mi}}, reaching an elevation of nearly {{convert|2,000|ft|m}}. Through this section, the speed limit reduces to 65 mph, and 55 mph for trucks on the westbound descent. Continuing through a predominantly wooded area, continues for about {{convert|10|mi|km}} through a predominantly wooded area, before reaching [[Monterey, Tennessee|Monterey]] a few miles later, where the route has two interchanges with US 70N, which contain concurrencies with [[Tennessee State Route 84|SR 84]] and [[Tennessee State Route 62|SR 62]], respectively. A short distance later, I-40 reaches an elevation of over {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} for the first time in Tennessee, before crossing into [[Cumberland County, Tennessee|Cumberland County]] and [[East Tennessee]] about {{convert|1/4|mi|km}}.\n\n===East Tennessee===\n\n====Cumberland Plateau and Tennessee Valley====\n[[File:Cumberland-plateau-i40-tn1.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 descending [[Walden Ridge]], miles 341\u2013346]]\n\nAfter ascending further up into the Walden Ridge/Cumberland Plateau and passing through Monterey, I-40 remains relatively flat and straight as it continues across the Cumberland Plateau. At mile 308, I-40 crosses the [[Tennessee Divide]], where the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Tennessee River]] watersheds meet. The divide is marked in the eastbound lanes with a sign reading \"Entering [[Emory River]] watershed.\" In the westbound counterparts is a sign noting the beginning of the Caney Fork watershed. About ten miles later, I-40 reaches [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville]], and has three interchanges, including one  with [[U.S. Route 127 in Tennessee|US 127]], which also conbects to [[Jamestown, Tennessee|Jamestown]]. \nEast of Crossville, the [[Crab Orchard Mountains]], the southern fringe of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], come into view as the road descends several hundred feet. At mile 329, the interstate enters Crab Orchard Gap and proceeds through a narrow valley once prone to [[landslide|rockslide]]s. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with US 70 near the town of [[Crab Orchard, Tennessee|Crab Orchard]]. Beyond this point, the Interstate descends into a short depression before crossing into [[Roane County, Tennessee|Roane County]] and mile 340, entering the [[Eastern Time Zone]]. Shortly thereafter the road begins its descent of the Cumberland Plateau into the [[Tennessee Valley]] and the speed limit drops to 60&nbsp;mph in the eastbound lanes. I-40 hugs the slopes of the plateau's [[Walden Ridge]] escarpment for several miles, containing what some describe as dramatic views of the Tennessee Valley below to the south, before reaching the base of the plateau at mile 347 between [[Harriman, Tennessee|Harriman]] and [[Rockwood, Tennessee|Rockwood]], and containing an interchange with [[U.S. Route 27 in Tennessee|US 27]]. As it enters the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|Ridge-and-Valley]] province of the Appalachians, of which the Tennessee Valley is a part, I-40 crosses a series of ridges and valleys characteristic of the region's topography. About {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 29|SR 29]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, the road crosses the Clinch River, with the [[Kingston Fossil Plant]] and its {{convert|1,000|ft|m|adj=on}} twin smokestacks dominating the view to the north. About {{convert|1|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 58|SR 58]] southbound in [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]], and at this point, I-40 begins a brief concurrency with SR 58. After ascending a short and relatively steep ridge out of the Clinch River Valley, SR 58 splits off to the north about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, heading towards [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]]. Continuing through the relatively rugged terrain of the Great Appalachian Valley and crossing additional ridges, I-40 crosses into [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon County]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 321|US 321]]/[[Tennessee State Route 95|SR 95]] near Lenoir city, before reaching I-75 about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Knoxville====\n{{See also|Interstate 75 in Tennessee#Knoxville}}\n[[File:TN I40 East-I75 North West Knoxville.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 concurrent with I-75 in Knoxville]]\nAt exit 368, about 20 miles west southwest of downtown Knoxville, I-40 merges with [[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]], which continues to the southwest to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and the two routes turn east northeast, carrying six through lanes, and cross into [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox County]] a short distance later. Throughout this concurrency, exits are numbered according to I-40 mileage. The two highways pass through several of the western suburbs of Knoxville,  including [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]], and have interchanges with a few surface streets. At exit 374 ([[Tennessee State Route 131|SR 131]]/Lovell Road), the highway widens to eight lanes and at the next exit, about {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} later, is an interchange with the [[Pellissippi Parkway]] (SR 162 westbound, I-140 eastbound), which connects to Oak Ridge and [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]], respectively. Continuing through western Knoxville, the two rputes have interchanges with additional surface streets, before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11 in Tennessee|US 11]]/70 {{convert|4|mi|km}} later near the [[West Hills, Knoxville|West Hills]] neighborhood. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 332|SR 332]] (Northshore Drive), and the separate Papermill Drive and Weisgarber Road. Two miles later, at exit 385, is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 640|I-640]], a beltway which passes northwest of downtown Knoxville. Also at this exit, I-75 splits off from I-40 onto a concurrency with I-640, splitting off a few miles later and heading towards [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. The route then enters downtown Knoxville, containing a minimum of six through lanes through the entirety of central Knoxville, as well as several short segments of [[auxiliary lane]]s between exits. Passing near the main campus of the [[University of Tennessee]], as well as several residential neighborhoods, about \n{{convert|1.5|mi|km}} past I-640 is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 129 in Tennessee|US 129]], which connects to [[McGhee Tyson Airport]] and is a route to the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. One mile later is an interchange with SR 62 (Western Avenue), and a mile beyond this point is an interchange with [[Interstate 275 (Tennessee)|I-275]]. About {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} later, in a complicated interchange, I-40 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 441 in Tennessee|US 441]] south (Henley Street), and begins a brief concurrency with this route, which splits off about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, along with [[Tennessee State Route 158|SR 158]] westbound, as controlled-access [[James White Parkway]]. I-40 then curves sharp north, and about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, sharp east again before coming to an interchange with a connector road to US 441. I-40 then crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with a surface street before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11W|US 11W]] (Rutledge Pike). The highway then enters a predominantly residential area, passing next to the [[Knoxville Zoo]], before coming to an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-640 and leaving Knoxville less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later. Also at this interchange, I-40 begins a brief (unsigned) concurrency with [[U.S. Route 25W|US 25W]], which splits off a little over {{convert|1|mi|km}} later at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11E|US 11E]]/70 (Asheville Highway). Leaving Knoxville, I-40 crosses the [[Holston River]] about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Smoky Mountains and Pigeon River gorge====\n[[File:Mount-cammerer-I40-tn1.jpg|thumb|right|I-40 near mile 441, with [[Mount Cammerer]] rising in the distance]]\nContinuing east as a six-lane highway, I-40 travels through a semi-rural residential area before crossing into [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]]. A few miles later, at exit 407, near [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]], I-40 has an interchange with the northern terminus of the [[Great Smoky Mountains Parkway]] ([[Tennessee State Route 66|SR 66]]). This interchange is the primary means of access to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, as well as the tourist attractions in the cities of Sevierville, [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]] and [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]], and, as a result, is reportedly one of the busiest and most congested non-interstate exits in the state. A few miles later, I-40 crosses into [[Jefferson County, Tennessee|Jefferson County]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US25W/70 in [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]]. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 92|SR 92]], also in Dandridge. Four miles later, at exit 421 is the interchange with the southern terminus of [[Interstate 81 in Tennessee|I-81]], which runs into [[Northeast Tennessee]] to the so called \"[[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]]\" of [[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]], [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]], and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]]. At this interchange, I-40 reduces back to four lanes and turns sharp southeast, crossing the [[Douglas Dam]] impoundment of the [[French Broad River]] about {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} later, as well as into [[Cocke County, Tennessee|Cocke County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 411 in Tennessee|US 411]]/70S/25 near [[Newport, Tennessee|Newport]]. Traveling along the northern base of English Mountain for a few miles, I-40 has an interchange with US 321 three miles later. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later the road has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 73|SR 73]] near [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]], and turns south through the gap between English Mountain and Stone Mountain, revealing a dramatic view of the {{convert|4928|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Mount Cammerer]] at the northeastern end of the Great Smokies range. Also at this point, I-40 enters thr [[Cherokee National Forest]] and proceeds into the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee\u2013North Carolina)|Pigeon River Gorge]] through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], closely following the north bank of the river. This section is extremely curvy and the speed limit reduces to 55&nbsp;mph due to its susceptibility to accidents. This stretch is also prone to rockslides, and contains mesh nets along some of the cliff slopes as preventative measures. A few miles later I-40 crosses the Pigeon River and has an interchange with the [[Foothills Parkway]], before crossing the pigeon river again about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later and curving sharply to the east. A bout {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, the route curves to the south again near the unincorporated community of [[Hartford, Tennessee|Hartford]] before entering North Carolina about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n===Music Highway===\nThe term '''Music Highway''' refers to a section of I-40 between Memphis and Nashville. I-40 was designated as such by an act of the Tennessee Legislature in 1997 \"from the eastern boundary of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] to the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]],\" a distance of about {{convert|222|mi|km}}. I-40 is designated as such because of the rich music history in Memphis, Nashville, and the areas in between. Memphis is known as \"the Home of the Blues and the Birthplace of Rock and Roll.\" Nashville is known as \"Music City USA\" for its influence on numerous types of music, especially [[Country music|country]]. Several cities and towns between the two, such as [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], [[Brownsville, Tennessee|Brownsville]], [[Nutbush, Tennessee|Nutbush]], [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]] and others were birthplaces or homes of numerous singers and songwriters. Signs that display the words \"Music Highway\" along with music notes are erected in both directions along I-40, especially at the borders of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] and [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]].<ref name=MH>{{cite web |url = http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |title = Public Chapter 124 Senate Bill No. 122 |publisher = State of Tennessee |access-date = September 26, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111014104711/http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |archive-date = October 14, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Construction and early history===\n\nThe Tennessee leg of I-40 was part of the original {{convert|1047|mi|km}} of Interstate Highways authorized for Tennessee by the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]].

[[Landslide|Rockslides]], especially along the eastern [[Cumberland Plateau]] and in the Pigeon River Gorge, have been a persistent problem since the road's construction.\n\n====Crab Orchard====\n\nIn December 1986, a truck driver was killed when his truck skidded across some rocks that had spilled across the road just east of [[Crab Orchard, Tennessee|Crab Orchard]] (between miles 331 and 333). In response, the [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]] (TDOT) flattened the cutslopes along this stretch of Interstate and moved the road {{convert|60|ft|m}} away from the problematic cliffside.<ref name=moore3>{{harvp|Moore|1994|pp=120\u2013131}}.</ref>\n\nTwenty rockslides occurred along the Walden Ridge section (miles 341\u2013346) of the eastern plateau in 1968 alone, prompting various remedial measures throughout the 1970s, including the employment of rock buttresses, gabion walls,{{clarify|date=April 2016|reason=or just link it something that explains what this is}} and horizontal drains.

Throughout the 1970s, this stretch of I-40 was repeatedly shut down by rockslides, sometimes for several weeks at a time. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, TDOT dug over {{convert|24000|ft|m}} of horizontal drains, blasted out large volumes of unstable rocks, and installed massive mesh catchment fences.<ref name=moore3 /> Nevertheless, rockslides in 1985 and 1997 again forced the closure of I-40 in the Pigeon River Gorge for several weeks.<ref name=wral>{{cite news |url = http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/163821/# |title = I-40 Closed in Both Directions: Another Rock Slide |location = Raleigh, NC |publisher = [[WRAL-TV]] |date = July 1, 1997 |access-date = October 23, 2009 }}</ref> Additional stabilization measures were implemented, including the blasting of loose rock, the installation of rock bolts, and the construction of a better drainage system.<ref>{{cite journal |first1 = Corry |last1 = Goumans |first2 = Dwayne |last2 = Wallace |lastauthoramp = yes |url = http://www.isee.org/tis/Proceed/General/99genv1/99v116g.pdf |format = PDF |title = I-40 Rockslide Causes Mountains of Problems |journal = Complete Abstracts of the ISEE Proceedings |volume = 1G |year = 1999 |page = 167 |access-date = October 23, 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030902015037/http://www.isee.org/tis/Proceed/General/99genv1/99v116g.pdf |archive-date = September 2, 2003 }}</ref> In spite of these measures, another massive rock slide occurred in the Pigeon River Gorge on October 26, 2009, blocking all lanes just across the border at North Carolina mile 3.

One particularly problematic stretch is a section of I-40 between miles 365 and 367 in Loudon County, which is underlain by cavernous rock strata. In the 1970s and 1980s, TDOT employed numerous stabilization measures in this area, including backfilling existing sinkholes with limestone, collapsing potential sinkholes, and paving roadside ditches to prevent surface water from seeping into the volatile soil.<ref name=moore3 />\n\n==Exit list==\n{{jcttop|exit|length_ref=}}\n{{jctint|exit\n|river=[[Mississippi River]]\n|lspan=2\n|mile=0.00\n|mspan=2\n|road={{jct|state=AR|I|40|dir1=west|city1=Little Rock}}\n|notes=Continuation into [[Arkansas]]}}\n{{jctbridge|exit\n|mile=none\n|bridge=[[Hernando de Soto Bridge]]}}\n{{TNint|exit\n|county=Shelby\n|cspan=23\n|location=Memphis\n|lspan=19\n|mile=0.91\n|exit=1\n|road=Riverside Drive / Front Street&nbsp;\u2013 [[Downtown Memphis, Tennessee|Downtown Memphis]]\n|notes=Western end of [[Music Highway (Tennessee)|Music Highway]] designation}}\n{{TNint|exit\n|mile=1.15\n|exit=1A\n|type=incomplete\n|road=2nd Street / 3rd Street ([[Tennessee State Route 3|SR&nbsp;3]] / [[Tennessee State Route 14|SR&nbsp;14]])\n|notes=Westbound exit and eastbound entrance}}\n{{TNint|exit\n|mile=1.60\n|exit=1B\n|road={{jct|state=TN|US|51|name1=Danny Thomas Boulevard, [[Tennessee State Route 1|SR&nbsp;1]]}}\n|notes=Signed as exits 1C (south) and 1D (north) westbound}}\n{{TNint|exit\n|mile=2.68\n|exit=1E\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=TN|I|240|dir1=south|road=Madison Avenue|location1=[[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson Miss.]]}}\n|notes=Western end of future [[Interstate 69 in Tennessee|I-69]] overlap;

Written by [[B. J. Novak]] and directed by [[Ken Kwapis]], the episode first aired in the United States on October 11, 2005 on [[NBC]]. The episode features [[Amy Adams]] as Jim's girlfriend, Katy.\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In the episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) takes it upon himself to teach [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) about business, but soon everyone is forced to evacuate the office due to a fire. While outside, Michael continues to show an interest in Ryan, causing [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) to be jealous. Meanwhile, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) organizes games to play outside.\n\nAccording to B. J. Novak, the episode was \"a fun one to film\". Although the cast and crew appear to be cold in the finished episode, \"The Fire\" was filmed in 100-degree weather; thus, the actors \"couldn't look hot\" and had to pretend to shiver. The firemen in the scene were played by actual firemen, and their costumes were designed in order to look like authentic Scranton firefighters.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) learns that [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) and [[List of characters from The Office (US T.V. series)#Katy Moore|Katy Moore]] ([[Amy Adams]]) have started dating. [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) gives [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) a glowing checkpoint review. When Ryan expresses his interest in starting his own business someday, Michael takes it upon himself to teach Ryan the \"ten rules of business\". The fire alarm sounds, and while [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) and [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) both attempt to take charge of the evacuation, Michael pushes others out of the way in his escape out of the building.\n\nThe employees play games to pass the time, including \"Desert Island Picks\" and \"Who Would You Do?\" When Ryan reveals that he is attending business school at night, Michael becomes enamored of his newfound prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Dwight becomes noticeably jealous of Ryan's favor with Michael, and he is seen sulking in his car to the tune \"[[Everybody Hurts]]\" by [[R.E.M.]] When Michael mentions that he left his cell phone in the office, Dwight rushes back into the building to fetch it.\n\nMichael asks Ryan to call his cell phone to help Dwight find it. The phone rings, which happens to be in Michael's pocket. Dwight emerges, coughing, from the building and reveals that the fire was started by Ryan, who left a [[pita|cheese pita]] in the toaster-oven set to \"oven\" instead of \"toaster\". Dwight and Michael mock Ryan and dub him \"The Fire Guy\" by doing a song parody of the [[Billy Joel]] song \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\".\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Amy Adams (29708985502) (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Amy Adams]] guest starred in the episode, playing Katy.]]\n\n\"The Fire\" was the fourth episode of the series directed by [[Ken Kwapis]].

Written by [[B. J. Novak]] and directed by [[Ken Kwapis]], the episode first aired in the United States on October 11, 2005 on [[NBC]]. The episode features [[Amy Adams]] as Jim's girlfriend, Katy.\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In the episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) takes it upon himself to teach [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) about business, but soon everyone is forced to evacuate the office due to a fire. While outside, Michael continues to show an interest in Ryan, causing [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) to be jealous. Meanwhile, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) organizes games to play outside.\n\nAccording to B. J. Novak, the episode was \"a fun one to film\". Although the cast and crew appear to be cold in the finished episode, \"The Fire\" was filmed in 100-degree weather; thus, the actors \"couldn't look hot\" and had to pretend to shiver. The firemen in the scene were played by actual firemen, and their costumes were designed in order to look like authentic Scranton firefighters.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) learns that [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) and [[List of characters from The Office (US T.V. series)#Katy Moore|Katy Moore]] ([[Amy Adams]]) have started dating. [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) gives [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) a glowing checkpoint review. When Ryan expresses his interest in starting his own business someday, Michael takes it upon himself to teach Ryan the \"ten rules of business\". The fire alarm sounds, and while [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) and [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) both attempt to take charge of the evacuation, Michael pushes others out of the way in his escape out of the building.\n\nThe employees play games to pass the time, including \"Desert Island Picks\" and \"Who Would You Do?\" When Ryan reveals that he is attending business school at night, Michael becomes enamored of his newfound prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Dwight becomes noticeably jealous of Ryan's favor with Michael, and he is seen sulking in his car to the tune \"[[Everybody Hurts]]\" by [[R.E.M.]] When Michael mentions that he left his cell phone in the office, Dwight rushes back into the building to fetch it.\n\nMichael asks Ryan to call his cell phone to help Dwight find it. The phone rings, which happens to be in Michael's pocket. Dwight emerges, coughing, from the building and reveals that the fire was started by Ryan, who left a [[pita|cheese pita]] in the toaster-oven set to \"oven\" instead of \"toaster\". Dwight and Michael mock Ryan and dub him \"The Fire Guy\" by doing a song parody of the [[Billy Joel]] song \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\".\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Amy Adams (29708985502) (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Amy Adams]] guest starred in the episode, playing Katy.]]\n\n\"The Fire\" was the fourth episode of the series directed by [[Ken Kwapis]].

When he later attempts to do a Yoda voice, Ryan misinterprets it as an impression of [[Fozzie Bear]] (ironically, both characters are portrayed by puppeteer [[Frank Oz]]). When Dwight is dejectedly listening to music in his car, he is playing \"[[Everybody Hurts]]\" by [[R.E.M.]] Dwight and Michael's \"Ryan Started the Fire\" is an thinly veiled song parody of the [[Billy Joel]] song \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\".<ref name=\"Alli\"/>\n\nDuring the game of desert island, many of the employees reference specific films and books. Angela says she would take [[The Bible]], ''[[A Purpose Driven Life]]'', and ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', but only to burn the latter. Dwight notes that he would take the ''[[Physicians' Desk Reference]]'', but hollow it out and fill it with supplies; he also states we would bring ''[[Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone]]'' or ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' in case he got bored.
