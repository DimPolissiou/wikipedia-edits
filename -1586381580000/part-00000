Following the death of [[Taliesin Williams]] in 1847, Davies proclaimed himself ''archdruid'', and from about 1853 he began to hold religious and druidical services near the Rocking Stone at [[Pontypridd]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Pontypridd and Rhondda Valleys|last=Morien|first=|publisher=|year=1903|isbn=|location=|pages=82-92}}</ref> For about 25 years the practice of holding meetings at the hour of equinoxes and solstices became a Glamorgan tradition,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/pdfplus/10.3366/rom.2006.12.1.65&usg=AOvVaw0mgV8Y5VD2uAiIQ8ERLySn|title=Many Faces of Iolo Morganwg|last=|first=|date=|website=www.google.com|doi=10.3366/rom.2006.12.1.65&usg=aovvaw0mgv8y5vd2uaiiq8erlysn|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> and Davies published a number of books on druidism. Much of his Neo druidic writings were nothing more than a continuation of the 18th-century revival and thus are built largely around writings produced in the 18th century and after by second-hand sources and theorists. Nevertheless, Davies was considered by some of his contemporaries as an expert in the field.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Welsh poets]]\n[[Category:Neo-druidism in Britain]]\n[[Category:Watchmakers]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Davies_(Myfyr_Morganwg)"}

He founded and served as the spiritual and first military leader of the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohad]] movement, a puritanical reform movement launched among the [[Masmuda]] [[Berber people|Berbers]] of the [[Atlas Mountains]]. Ibn Tumart launched an open revolt against the ruling [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] during the 1120s. After his death his followers, the Almohads, went on to conquer much of North Africa and part of Spain.\n\n==Biography==\n\n=== Early life ===\n\nMany of the details of Ibn Tumart's life were recorded by [[hagiography|hagiographers]], whose accounts probably mix legendary elements from the [[Almohad]] doctrine of their founding figure and spiritual leader.<ref>A French translation of the relation of the Almohad hagiographer [[Mohammed al-Baydhaq]], can be found in  L\u00e9vi-Proven\u00e7al (1928). A Spanish translation of the arguably most reliable Almohad chronicle ''[[al-Bayan al-Mughrib]]'' of [[Ibn Idhari|Ibn Idhari al-Marrakushi]], can be found in Huici Miranda (1951).  Ibn Idhari was a principal source for the account, ''Kitab al-'Ibar'', of [[Ibn Khaldun]].  [[Ibn Khallikan]]'s entry on Ibn Tumart can be found in English translation in ''Biographical Dictionary'', 1843 M. de Slane trans., Paris, vol. 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eeE80B81GfgC&pg=PA205#v=onepage&q&f=false p.205])</ref> Ibn Tumart was born sometime between 1078 and 1082 in the small village of [[Igiliz]] (exact location uncertain<ref>Fromherz (2005: p.177) identifies Igiliz (and Ibn Tumart's nearby cave) with the modern small village of Igli, some 30 km east of [[Taroudannt]] in the [[Sous]] valley</ref>) in the [[Sous]] valley of southern [[Morocco]].<ref name = kennedy>H.

Elfasi, editor, ''General History of Africa, Africa from the Seventh to the Eleventh Century'', ch.4, p. 99</ref>\n\nIbn Tumart came from a humble family and his father was a lamp-lighter at the mosque.<ref>History of [[Ibn Khaldun]]</ref> By his own declaration and that of his followers, he claimed to be descendant of [[Idriss I]], a descendant of Hassan, the grandson of the Prophet [[Muhammad]], who took refuge in Morocco in the 8th-century.<ref>For an attempt to trace this professed Sharifian lineage, see Ibn Khallikan's entry.</ref> However, and despite being supported by [[Ibn Khaldun]], this ascendency is today largely disputed.<ref name=\"EI2\" /> At the time, it was common for Berber leaders and tribes to claim a [[Sharif]] lineage in order to gain religious authority.<ref>Even today the claim of Shariffian lineage of Morocco's current ruling dynasty, the [[Alaouite dynasty|Alaouites]], is largely disputed</ref>\n\nAt the time, Morocco, [[al-Andalus]] and large parts of [[Maghreb]], were ruled by the [[Almoravids]], a [[Maliki]] puritanical [[Sanhaja|Saharan Sanhaja]] Berber movements, who founded the city of [[Marrakesh]] and are credited with spreading Islam to much of [[West Africa]]. To pursue his education, Ibn Tumart went as a young man (c.&nbsp;1106) to [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Qortoba]], which was at the time the biggest centre of learning in the Almoravids dominion, where he was a disciple of [[at-Turtushi]]. Thereafter, Ibn Tumart went east to deepen his studies where he came under the influence [[al-Ghazali]]'s ideas (Almohad historians support that he met and studied under al-Ghazali, but modern historians maintain that it is unknown whether this encounter actually happened).<ref>Julian, p. 93; Ibn Khallikan, p.206</ref> He appears in [[Baghdad]] soon after, and there he attached himself to the [[Ash'ari]]te school of theology and the [[Zahiri]]te school of jurisprudence, but with the creed of [[Ibn Hazm]] which differed significantly from early Zahirites in its rejection of [[Taqlid]] and reliance on reason.<ref>De Lacy O'leary, ''Arabic Thought and Its Place in History'', p. 249. Courier Dover Publications, 1939. {{ISBN|9780486149554}}</ref>\n\n=== Doctrines ===\n\nIt was probably while in Baghdad that Ibn Tumart began to develop a system of his own by combining the teachings of his Ash'arite masters with parts of the doctrines of others, with a touch of [[Sufism|Sufi]] mysticism imbibed from the great teacher [[al-Ghazali]].<ref name=kojiro>[[Kojiro Nakamura]], \"Ibn Mada's Criticism of Arab Grammarians.\" ''Orient'', v. 10, pp. 89\u2013113. 1974</ref> Hagiographers report that Ibn Tumart was in al-Ghazali's presence when news arrived that the Almoravids had proscribed and publicly burned his recent great work, ''Ihya' Ulum al-Din'', upon which al-Ghazali is said to have turned to Ibn Tumart and charged him, as a native of those lands, with the mission of setting the Almoravids right.<ref name = kennedy/>\n\nIbn Tumart's main principle was a rigid unitarianism (''[[tawhid]]'') which denied the existence of the [[God in Islam#Other attributes|attributes of God]] as incompatible with his unity and therefore [[Shirk (Islam)|a polytheistic idea]].<ref name=kojiro/> Ibn Tumart represented a revolt against what he perceived as [[anthropomorphism]] in the Muslim orthodoxy, but he was a rigid predestinarian and a strict observer of the law. He laid the blame for the \"theological flaws\" of the nation upon the ruling dynasty of the Almoravids. Ibn Thumart strongly opposed their sponsorship of the [[Maliki]] school of jurisprudence, whom he accused of neglecting the [[Sunnah]] and [[Hadith]] (traditions and sayings of the Prophet and his companions) and relying too much on ''[[ijma]]'' (consensus of jurists) and other sources, an anathema to the stricter [[Zahiri]]sm favored by Ibn Tumart. Ibn Tumart condemned the subtle reasoning of Maliki scholars as \"innovations\" (''[[bid\u2018ah]]''), obscurantist, perverse and possibly heretical (a charge previously made by Ibn Hazm and al-Ghazali, and the main reason why their works were proscribed by Almoravid authorities.).<ref name=kojiro/> Ibn Tumart also blamed the Almoravid governance for the latitude he found in Maghrebi society, notably the public sale of wine and pork in the markets, something the [[Qur'an]] forbids. Another reform was the destruction or hiding of any type of religious art in mosques. His rule and the rule of the Almohads after were [[Almohad reforms|full of reforms]] that attempted to turn the area under his control into a place where his doctrines held sway.\n\nIbn Tumart's followers took up the name \"''al-Muwwahidun''\", meaning those who affirm the unity of God. Spanish authors wrote that down as \"''Almohades''\", by which \"Almohads\" entered other languages.\n\n=== Return to the Maghreb ===\n\nAfter his studies in Baghdad, Ibn Tumart is claimed in one account to have proceeded on pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] (''[[hajj]]''), but was so bubbling with Ash'arite doctrines and a one-minded zeal to 'correct' the mores of the people he came across that he quickly made a nuisance of himself and was expelled from the city.<ref>Ibn Khallikan, p. 206</ref> He proceeded to [[Cairo]], and thereon to [[Alexandria]], where he took a ship back to the [[Maghreb]] in 1117/18. The journey was not without incident - Ibn Tumart took it upon himself to toss the ship's flasks of wine overboard and set about lecturing (or harassing) the sailors to ensure they adhered to correct prayer times and number of genuflections; in some reports, the sailors got fed up and threw Ibn Tumart overboard, only to find him still bobbing a half-day later and fished him back (he is also reported in different chronicles of having either caused or calmed a storm at sea).<ref>Wasserstein (2003)</ref>\n\nAfter touching at [[Tripoli]], Ibn Tumart landed in [[Mahdia]] and proceed on to [[Tunis]] and then [[B\u00e9ja\u00efa|Bejaia]], preaching a puritan, simplistic Islam along the way. Waving his puritan's staff among crowds of listeners, Ibn Tumart complained of the mixing of sexes in public, the production of wine and music, and the fashion of veiling men unveiling women (a custom among the [[Sanhaja]] Berbers of the [[Sahara Desert]], that had spread to urban centers with the Almoravids). Setting himself up on the steps of mosques and schools, Ibn Tumart challenged everyone who came close to debate \u2013 unwary Maliki jurists and scholars frequently got an earful.\n\nHis antics and fiery preaching prompted fed-up authorities to hustle him along from town to town. After being expelled from [[Bejaia]], Ibn Tumart set himself up c.1119 at an encampment in [[Mellala]] (a few miles south of the city), where he began receiving his first followers and adherents. Among these were al-Bashir (a scholar, who would become his chief strategist), [[Abd al-Mu'min]] (a [[Zenata]] Berber who would become his eventual successor) and [[Mohammed al-Baydhaq|Abu Bakr Muhammad al-Baydhaq]] (who would later write the ''Kitab al-Ansab'', the chronicle of the Almohads.) It was at Mellala that Ibn Tumart and his close companions began forging a plan of political action.\n\nIn 1120, Ibn Tumart and his small band of followers headed west into [[Morocco]]. He stopped by [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]], the intellectual capital of Morocco, and engaged in polemical debates with the leading Malikite scholars of the city. Having exhausted them, the ''[[ulama]]'' of Fez decided they had enough and expelled him from the city. He proceeded south, hurried along from town to town like a vagabond (reportedly, he and his companions had to swim across the [[Bou Regreg]], as they could not afford the ferry passage). Shortly after his arrival in [[Marrakesh]], Ibn Tumart is said to have successfully sought out the Almoravid ruler [[Ali ibn Yusuf]] at a local mosque. In the famous encounter, when ordered to acknowledge the presence of the emir, Ibn Tumart reportedly replied \"Where is the emir? I see only women here!\" - an insulting reference to the [[tagelmust]] veil worn by the Almoravid ruling class.<ref>Messier (2010: p. 141)</ref> (According to one source, Ibn Tumart attacked the emir's own sister for going unveiled).\n\nCharged with fomenting rebellion, Ibn Tumart defended himself before the emir and his leading advisors. Presenting himself as a mere scholar, a voice for reform, Ibn Tumart set about lecturing the emir and his leading advisors about the dangers of innovations and the centrality of the Sunnah. When the emir's own scholars reminded him the Almoravids too embraced puritanical ideals, and were committed to the Sunnah, Ibn Tumart pointed out that the Almoravids professed puritanism had been clouded and deviated by \"obscurantists\", drawing attention to the ample evidence of laxity and impiety that prevailed in their dominions. When countered that at least on points of doctrine, there was little difference between them, Ibn Tumart brought out more emphasis on his own peculiar doctrines on the ''tawhid'' and the attributes. After a lengthy examination, the Almoravid jurists of Marrakesh concluded Ibn Tumart, however learned, was blasphemous and dangerous, insinuating he was probably a [[Kharijite]] agitator, and recommended he should be executed or imprisoned. The Almoravid emir, however, decided to merely expel him from the city, after a [[flogging]] of fourteen lashes.<ref name = kennedy/>  \n  \nIbn Tumart proceeded to [[Aghmat]] and immediately resumed his old behavior - destroying every jug of wine in sight, haranguing passers-by for impious behavior or dress, engaging locals in controversial debate. The ulama of Aghmat complained to the emir, who changed his mind and decided to have Ibn Tumart arrested after all. He was saved by the timely intervention of Abu Ibrahim Ismail Ibn Yasallali al-Hazraji (\"Ismail Igig\"), a prominent chieftain of the Hazraja tribe of the Masmuda, who helped him escape the city. Ibn Tumart took the road towards the Sous valley, to hide among his own people, the Haghra.\n\n=== Cave of Igiliz ===\n\nBefore the end of 1120, Ibn Tumart arrived at his home village of Igiliz in the Sous valley (exact location uncertain).<ref>See Fromherz (2005).</ref> Almost immediately, Ibn Tumart set himself up in a nearby mountain cave (a conscious echo of the Prophet Muhammad's withdraw to the cave of [[Cave of Hira|Hira]]). His bizarre retreat, his ascetic lifestyle, probably combined with rumors of his being a [[faith healer]] and small miracle-worker, gave the local people the initial impression that he was a [[Wali|holy man]] with supernatural powers (a point de-emphasized by later hagiographers).<ref name = kennedy/> But he soon set about spreading his principal message of puritanical reform. He preached in vernacular [[Berber languages|Berber]]. His oratory skill and crowd-moving eloquence are frequently referred to in the chronicles.\n\nTowards the end of [[Ramadan]] in late 1121, in a particularly moving sermon, Ibn Tumart reviewed his failure to persuade the Almoravids to reform by argument. After the sermon, having already claimed to be a [[sayyid|descendant]] of [[Muhammad]], Ibn Tumart suddenly 'revealed' himself as the true [[Mahdi]], the expected divinely guided justicer. He was promptly recognized as such by his audience. This was effectively a declaration of war on the Almoravid state. For to reject or resist the Mahdi's interpretations was equivalent to resisting God, and thus punishable with death as [[apostasy]].<ref name = kennedy/>\n\n(Notions of ''mahdism'' were not unfamiliar in this part of Morocco - not long before, the Sous valley had been a hotbed of [[Waqifite Shia|Waqafite Shi'iism]], a remnant of [[Fatimid]] influence, and descendance from the Prophet had been the principle recommendation of the fondly remembered [[Idrisid]]s).\n\nAt some point he was visited by [[Abu Hafs Umar ibn Yahya al-Hintati]] (\"Umar Hintati\"), a prominent [[Hintata]] chieftain (and stem of the future [[Hafsid]]s). Omar Hintati was immediately impressed and invited Ibn Tumart to take refuge among the [[Masmuda]] tribes of the [[High Atlas]], where he would be better protected from the Almoravid authorities. In 1122, Ibn Tumart abandoned his cave and climbed up the High Atlas.<ref name = kennedy/>\n\nIn later years, Ibn Tumart's path from the cave of Igiliz to mountain fort of Tinmel - another conscious echo of the Prophet's life (the ''[[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]'' from Mecca to Medina) - would become a popular pilgrimage route for the Almohad faithful. The cave itself was preserved as a shrine for many years, where apparently Almohad partisans, regardless of their origin or background, would ceremonially reject their past affiliations and be \"adopted\" into Ibn Tumart's Hargha tribe).<ref>Fromherz (2005: p. 181)</ref>\n\n=== Tinmel and the Almohad rebellion ===\n[[image:Tinmel mosque.jpg|thumb|Mosque erected in 1156 in honor of Ibn Tumart at [[Tinmel]], once part of a large fortified complex, the first headquarters of the [[Almohads]].]]\n\nIbn Tumart urged his followers to arms in open revolt against the [[Almoravid]]s, to fulfill the mission of purifying the Almoravid state. In 1122, or shortly thereafter (c. 1124<ref>Messier (2010:148)</ref>) he founded a [[ribat]] at [[Tinmel]] (or 'Tin Mal', meaning \"(she who is) white\"), in a small valley of the Nfis in the middle of the High Atlas. Tinmel was an impregnable fortified complex, which would serve both as spiritual center and military headquarters of the Almohad rebellion. It is during this period that he wrote a series of monographs on various doctrines for the instruction of his men. These disparate works were later collected and compiled in 1183\u201384, on the order of the Almohad caliph Yusuf ibn Abd al-Ma'mun (later translated in French in 1903, under the title ''Livre d'Ibn Toumert''.)\n\nSix principal [[Masmuda]] tribes adhered to the Almohad rebellion: Ibn Tumart's own Hargha tribe (from the [[Anti-Atlas]]) and the Ganfisa, the Gadmiwa, the Hintata, the Haskura and the Hazraja (roughly from west to east, along the [[High Atlas]] range).<ref>Julien, p.99</ref>\n\n[[image:Almohad_Masmuda_tribes.png|thumb|400px|Approximate locations of the main Masmuda tribes that adhered to the Almohads]]\nFor the next eight years, the Almohad revolt was largely confined to an irresolute guerilla war through the ravines and peaks of the Atlas range. The principal damage done by the Almohads at this stage was the disruption of Almoravid tax-collection, and rendering insecure (or altogether impassable) the roads and mountain passes south of Marrakesh. The [[Sous]] valley, surrounded on three sides by Almohadist Masmuda mountaineers, was nearly cut off and isolated. Of more particular concern to the Almoravids was their threat to the [[Ourika River|Ourika]] and [[Tizi n'Tichka]] passes, that connected Marrakesh to the [[Draa River|Draa]] valley on the other side of the High Atlas. These were the principal routes to the all-important city of [[Sijilmassa]], gateway of the [[trans-Saharan trade]], by which gold came from west Africa to Morocco. But the Almoravids were unable to send enough manpower through the narrow passes to dislodge the Almohad rebels from their easily defended mountain strongpoints. The Almoravid authorities reconciled themselves to setting up strongpoints to confine them (most famously the fortress of [[Tasghimout]] that protected the approach to [[Aghmat]]), while exploring alternative routes through more easterly passes.<ref name = kennedy/><ref>Messier, 2010: p.153-54)</ref>\n\nIbn Tumart's closest companion and chief strategist, al-Bashir, took upon himself the role of political commissar, enforcing doctrinal discipline among the Masmuda tribesmen, often with a heavy head. This culminated in an infamous purge (''tamyiz'') conducted by al-Bashir in the winter of 1129\u201330, with mass executions of disloyal partisans, which has been characterized as a brief \"reign of terror\".<ref name = kennedy/><ref>Messier (2010: p. 149) reports 15,000 men of Tinmel area were killed, and their wives and belongings distributed among the Almohad warriors.</ref>\n\n=== Battle of al-Buhayra ===\n\nIn early 1130, the Almohads finally descended from the mountains for their first sizeable attack on the Almoravids in the lowlands. It was a disaster. Al-Bashir (others report Abd al-Mu'min<ref>Messier (2010: p. 150\u201351)</ref>) led the Almohad armies first against [[Aghmat]]. They quickly defeated the Almoravid force that came out the meet them, and then chased their fleeing remnant back to [[Marrakesh]]. The Almohads set up a siege camp before Marrakesh, the first recorded siege of the Almoravid capital, whose walls had only recently been erected. The Almoravid emir Ali ibn Yusuf immediately called upon reinforcements from other parts of Morocco. After forty days of siege, in May (others date April 14, 1130<ref>Messier (2010: p. 151)</ref>), heartened by news of the approach of a relief column from Sijilmassa, the Almoravids sallied from Marrakesh in force and crushed the Almohads in the bloody [[Battle of al-Buhayra]] (named after a large garden east of the city). The Almohads were routed, suffering huge human losses - 12,000 men from the Hargha alone. Al-Bashir and several other leading figures were killed in action.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Islam'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=tPsUAAAAIAAJ&lpg=PA592&ots=tDnAHS-glP&dq=battle%20of%20al-Buhayra&pg=PA592#v=onepage&q&f=false p.592]</ref> If not for a sudden torrential rain that broke up the fighting and allowed the remnant to escape back to the mountains, the Almohads might have been finished off then and there.\n\nIn a bizarre and chilling footnote in the aftermath, it is said that Ibn Tumart returned to the battlefield at night with some of his followers, and ordered them to bury themselves in the field with a small straw to breathe by. Then, to invigorate the rest of the demoralized Almohads, he challenged those who doubted the righteousness of their cause, to go to the battlefield and ask the dead themselves if they were enjoying the blisses of heaven after falling in the fight for God's cause. When they heard the positive reply from the buried men, they were assuaged. To prevent the ruse from being revealed, it is said Ibn Thumart left them buried there, filling their straws so they would suffocate.<ref>[[James Edward Budgett-Meakin]], (1899) ''The Moorish Empire: a historical epitome'', London: Sonnenschein, [https://archive.org/details/ldpd_6769876_000/page/n94 p.69]</ref>\n\n== Almohads after Ibn Tumart ==\n\nIbn Tumart died in August 1130, only a few months after the disastrous defeat at al-Buhayra.<ref name = kennedy/> That the Almohad movement did not immediately collapse by the combined blows of the crushing defeat and large losses at the walls of Marrakesh, and the deaths of not only their spiritual leader, but also their chief military commanders, is testament to the careful organization that Ibn Tumart had built up at Tinmel.\n\nIbn Tumart had set up the Almohad commune as a minutely detailed pyramidical hierarchy with fourteen grades. At the top was the ''Ahl ad-Dar'' (the Mahdi's family), supplemented by a privy council known as the Council of Ten (''Ahl al-jam\u0101\u02bf\u0101'') which included the Ifriqiyan migrants who had first joined Ibn Tumart in Mellala. There was also a wider consultative \"Council of Fifty\", composed of the ''[[sheikh]]s'' of the major [[Masmuda]] Berber tribes - the Hargha (Ibn Tumart's tribe, which had primacy in the hierarchy among the tribes), the Ganfisa, the Gadmiwa, the Hintata, the Haskura and the Hazraja.<ref name = kennedy/> The Almohad military had been organized as arranged \"units\" named by tribe, with sub-units and internal hierarchies carefully and exactly spelled out. There were also organized groups of ''Talba'' and ''Huffaz'', the preachers that had been the original missionaries and spreaders of Ibn Tumart's message.\n\n===The Council of Ten===\n\nIbn Tumart organized the inner 'Council of Ten' (''Ahl al-jam\u0101\u02bf\u0101''), composed of the ten who had first borne witness to Ibn Tumart as ''Mahdi''. Several of them were drawn from the core of followers that Ibn Tumart had picked up in Ifriqiya (esp. while holding camp at [[Mallala, Algeria|Mallala]], outside of Bejaia, in 1119-20); others were local leaders drawn from the local Masmuda Berbers who had proven early adherents. Although the list has some variations and there is some dispute in names, the Council of Ten is frequently identified as follows:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aOeLAi38h4YC|title=The Almohads: The Rise of an Islamic Empire|last=Fromherz|first=Allen J.|date=|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2012|isbn=9781780764054|location=|pages=123\u2013124|language=en}}</ref>\n\n{|align=\"left\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+\n! width=\"200\" | Name || Notes\n|-\n| align=\"left\"|[[Abd al-Mu'min]] ibn Ali||align=\"left\"|originally from Tagra (near [[Tlemcen]], modern Algeria), Abd al-Mu'min was a Berber of the Kumiya tribe of the [[Zenata]] confederation.<ref>Julien, p.93</ref> Abd al-Mu'min adhered at Mellala, and was given the appellation of \"Lamp of the Almohads\" (''Siraj al-Muwahhidin'').

But it seems more probable (although passed over in the chronicles) that there was an intense power struggle for succession in the aftermath of Ibn Tumart's death.<ref name = kennedy/> With half the Council of Ten killed at al-Buhayra, Abd al-Mu'min laid claim as the \"successor\" of the Ibn Tumart (the term \"[[caliph]]\", as \"successor\" of the Mahdi emerged only later, in conscious imitation of the term's original use for the \"successors\" of the [[Prophet Muhammad]].) Abd al-Mu'min's claim was challenged by Ibn Malwiya (another survivor of the Ten) as well as by the Ahl al-Dar (Ibn Tumart's brothers).\n\nExactly how Abd al-Mu'min imposed himself is uncertain. As a [[Zenata]] Berber, Abd al-Mu'min was an alien among the Masmuda. But that foreignness itself might have recommended him as a neutral choice to the Masmuda ''sheikhs'', as it would avoid the appearance of favoritism towards any particular tribe. Nonetheless it is reported that the more easterly Masmuda tribes, the Haskura and the Harzaja, rejected Abd al-Mu'min's leadership and broke away from the Almohad coalition at this stage.<ref>Messier (2010: p. 153)</ref> Abd al-Mu'min would have to force them back to the fold. (Ibn Khaldun reports (improbably) that Abd al-Ma'mun managed to conceal the death of Ibn Tumart for nearly two years, in order to gather allies and marry the daughter of Omar Hintati, who would become his principal ally.) His principal rival Ibn Malwiya was captured, condemned and executed by 1132, and Ibn Tumart's own family soon disappears from significance, their roles eclipsed by Abd al-Mu'min's own family, the future dynasty of Almohad caliphs. Whatever doubts lingered about Abd al-Mu'min's leadership certainly dissipated a decade later, when Abd al-Mu'min led the renewed Almohads down from the mountains on a seven-year campaign of conquest of Morocco, culminating in the fall of Marrakesh in 1147.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Written by Ibn Tumart===\n* {{in lang|ar}} ''Le livre de Mohammed Ibn Toumert, mahdi des Almohades'', 1903 edition, [[Ign\u00e1c Goldziher]], editor, [[Algiers]]: P.

Courier Dover Publications, 1939. {{ISBN|9780486149554}}</ref>\n\n=== Doctrines ===\n\nIt was probably while in Baghdad that Ibn Tumart began to develop a system of his own by combining the teachings of his Ash'arite masters with parts of the doctrines of others, with a touch of [[Sufism|Sufi]] mysticism imbibed from the great teacher [[al-Ghazali]].<ref name=kojiro>[[Kojiro Nakamura]], \"Ibn Mada's Criticism of Arab Grammarians.\" ''Orient'', v. 10, pp. 89\u2013113. 1974</ref> Hagiographers report that Ibn Tumart was in al-Ghazali's presence when news arrived that the Almoravids had proscribed and publicly burned his recent great work, ''Ihya' Ulum al-Din'', upon which al-Ghazali is said to have turned to Ibn Tumart and charged him, as a native of those lands, with the mission of setting the Almoravids right.<ref name = kennedy/>\n\nIbn Tumart's main principle was a rigid unitarianism (''[[tawhid]]'') which denied the existence of the [[God in Islam#Other attributes|attributes of God]] as incompatible with his unity and therefore [[Shirk (Islam)|a polytheistic idea]].<ref name=kojiro/> Ibn Tumart represented a revolt against what he perceived as [[anthropomorphism]] in the Muslim orthodoxy, but he was a rigid predestinarian and a strict observer of the law. He laid the blame for the \"theological flaws\" of the nation upon the ruling dynasty of the Almoravids. Ibn Thumart strongly opposed their sponsorship of the [[Maliki]] school of jurisprudence, whom he accused of neglecting the [[Sunnah]] and [[Hadith]] (traditions and sayings of the Prophet and his companions) and relying too much on ''[[ijma]]'' (consensus of jurists) and other sources, an anathema to the stricter [[Zahiri]]sm favored by Ibn Tumart. Ibn Tumart condemned the subtle reasoning of Maliki scholars as \"innovations\" (''[[bid\u2018ah]]''), obscurantist, perverse and possibly heretical (a charge previously made by Ibn Hazm and al-Ghazali, and the main reason why their works were proscribed by Almoravid authorities.).<ref name=kojiro/> Ibn Tumart also blamed the Almoravid governance for the latitude he found in Maghrebi society, notably the public sale of wine and pork in the markets, something the [[Qur'an]] forbids. Another reform was the destruction or hiding of any type of religious art in mosques. His rule and the rule of the Almohads after were [[Almohad reforms|full of reforms]] that attempted to turn the area under his control into a place where his doctrines held sway.\n\nIbn Tumart's followers took up the name \"''al-Muwwahidun''\", meaning those who affirm the unity of God. Spanish authors wrote that down as \"''Almohades''\", by which \"Almohads\" entered other languages.\n\n=== Return to the Maghreb ===\n\nAfter his studies in Baghdad, Ibn Tumart is claimed in one account to have proceeded on pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] (''[[hajj]]''), but was so bubbling with Ash'arite doctrines and a one-minded zeal to 'correct' the mores of the people he came across that he quickly made a nuisance of himself and was expelled from the city.<ref>Ibn Khallikan, p. 206</ref> He proceeded to [[Cairo]], and thereon to [[Alexandria]], where he took a ship back to the [[Maghreb]] in 1117/18. The journey was not without incident - Ibn Tumart took it upon himself to toss the ship's flasks of wine overboard and set about lecturing (or harassing) the sailors to ensure they adhered to correct prayer times and number of genuflections; in some reports, the sailors got fed up and threw Ibn Tumart overboard, only to find him still bobbing a half-day later and fished him back (he is also reported in different chronicles of having either caused or calmed a storm at sea).<ref>Wasserstein (2003)</ref>\n\nAfter touching at [[Tripoli]], Ibn Tumart landed in [[Mahdia]] and proceed on to [[Tunis]] and then [[B\u00e9ja\u00efa|Bejaia]], preaching a puritan, simplistic Islam along the way. Waving his puritan's staff among crowds of listeners, Ibn Tumart complained of the mixing of sexes in public, the production of wine and music, and the fashion of veiling men unveiling women (a custom among the [[Sanhaja]] Berbers of the [[Sahara Desert]], that had spread to urban centers with the Almoravids). Setting himself up on the steps of mosques and schools, Ibn Tumart challenged everyone who came close to debate \u2013 unwary Maliki jurists and scholars frequently got an earful.\n\nHis antics and fiery preaching prompted fed-up authorities to hustle him along from town to town. After being expelled from [[Bejaia]], Ibn Tumart set himself up c.1119 at an encampment in [[Mellala]] (a few miles south of the city), where he began receiving his first followers and adherents. Among these were al-Bashir (a scholar, who would become his chief strategist), [[Abd al-Mu'min]] (a [[Zenata]] Berber who would become his eventual successor) and [[Mohammed al-Baydhaq|Abu Bakr Muhammad al-Baydhaq]] (who would later write the ''Kitab al-Ansab'', the chronicle of the Almohads.) It was at Mellala that Ibn Tumart and his close companions began forging a plan of political action.\n\nIn 1120, Ibn Tumart and his small band of followers headed west into [[Morocco]]. He stopped by [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]], the intellectual capital of Morocco, and engaged in polemical debates with the leading Malikite scholars of the city. Having exhausted them, the ''[[ulama]]'' of Fez decided they had enough and expelled him from the city. He proceeded south, hurried along from town to town like a vagabond (reportedly, he and his companions had to swim across the [[Bou Regreg]], as they could not afford the ferry passage). Shortly after his arrival in [[Marrakesh]], Ibn Tumart is said to have successfully sought out the Almoravid ruler [[Ali ibn Yusuf]] at a local mosque. In the famous encounter, when ordered to acknowledge the presence of the emir, Ibn Tumart reportedly replied \"Where is the emir? I see only women here!\" - an insulting reference to the [[tagelmust]] veil worn by the Almoravid ruling class.<ref>Messier (2010: p. 141)</ref> (According to one source, Ibn Tumart attacked the emir's own sister for going unveiled).\n\nCharged with fomenting rebellion, Ibn Tumart defended himself before the emir and his leading advisors. Presenting himself as a mere scholar, a voice for reform, Ibn Tumart set about lecturing the emir and his leading advisors about the dangers of innovations and the centrality of the Sunnah. When the emir's own scholars reminded him the Almoravids too embraced puritanical ideals, and were committed to the Sunnah, Ibn Tumart pointed out that the Almoravids professed puritanism had been clouded and deviated by \"obscurantists\", drawing attention to the ample evidence of laxity and impiety that prevailed in their dominions. When countered that at least on points of doctrine, there was little difference between them, Ibn Tumart brought out more emphasis on his own peculiar doctrines on the ''tawhid'' and the attributes. After a lengthy examination, the Almoravid jurists of Marrakesh concluded Ibn Tumart, however learned, was blasphemous and dangerous, insinuating he was probably a [[Kharijite]] agitator, and recommended he should be executed or imprisoned. The Almoravid emir, however, decided to merely expel him from the city, after a [[flogging]] of fourteen lashes.<ref name = kennedy/>  \n  \nIbn Tumart proceeded to [[Aghmat]] and immediately resumed his old behavior - destroying every jug of wine in sight, haranguing passers-by for impious behavior or dress, engaging locals in controversial debate. The ulama of Aghmat complained to the emir, who changed his mind and decided to have Ibn Tumart arrested after all. He was saved by the timely intervention of Abu Ibrahim Ismail Ibn Yasallali al-Hazraji (\"Ismail Igig\"), a prominent chieftain of the Hazraja tribe of the Masmuda, who helped him escape the city. Ibn Tumart took the road towards the Sous valley, to hide among his own people, the Haghra.\n\n=== Cave of Igiliz ===\n\nBefore the end of 1120, Ibn Tumart arrived at his home village of Igiliz in the Sous valley (exact location uncertain).<ref>See Fromherz (2005).</ref> Almost immediately, Ibn Tumart set himself up in a nearby mountain cave (a conscious echo of the Prophet Muhammad's withdraw to the cave of [[Cave of Hira|Hira]]). His bizarre retreat, his ascetic lifestyle, probably combined with rumors of his being a [[faith healer]] and small miracle-worker, gave the local people the initial impression that he was a [[Wali|holy man]] with supernatural powers (a point de-emphasized by later hagiographers).<ref name = kennedy/> But he soon set about spreading his principal message of puritanical reform. He preached in vernacular [[Berber languages|Berber]]. His oratory skill and crowd-moving eloquence are frequently referred to in the chronicles.\n\nTowards the end of [[Ramadan]] in late 1121, in a particularly moving sermon, Ibn Tumart reviewed his failure to persuade the Almoravids to reform by argument. After the sermon, having already claimed to be a [[sayyid|descendant]] of [[Muhammad]], Ibn Tumart suddenly 'revealed' himself as the true [[Mahdi]], the expected divinely guided justicer. He was promptly recognized as such by his audience. This was effectively a declaration of war on the Almoravid state. For to reject or resist the Mahdi's interpretations was equivalent to resisting God, and thus punishable with death as [[apostasy]].<ref name = kennedy/>\n\n(Notions of ''mahdism'' were not unfamiliar in this part of Morocco - not long before, the Sous valley had been a hotbed of [[Waqifite Shia|Waqafite Shi'iism]], a remnant of [[Fatimid]] influence, and descendance from the Prophet had been the principle recommendation of the fondly remembered [[Idrisid]]s).\n\nAt some point he was visited by [[Abu Hafs Umar ibn Yahya al-Hintati]] (\"Umar Hintati\"), a prominent [[Hintata]] chieftain (and stem of the future [[Hafsid]]s). Omar Hintati was immediately impressed and invited Ibn Tumart to take refuge among the [[Masmuda]] tribes of the [[High Atlas]], where he would be better protected from the Almoravid authorities. In 1122, Ibn Tumart abandoned his cave and climbed up the High Atlas.<ref name = kennedy/>\n\nIn later years, Ibn Tumart's path from the cave of Igiliz to mountain fort of Tinmel - another conscious echo of the Prophet's life (the ''[[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]'' from Mecca to Medina) - would become a popular pilgrimage route for the Almohad faithful. The cave itself was preserved as a shrine for many years, where apparently Almohad partisans, regardless of their origin or background, would ceremonially reject their past affiliations and be \"adopted\" into Ibn Tumart's Hargha tribe).<ref>Fromherz (2005: p. 181)</ref>\n\n=== Tinmel and the Almohad rebellion ===\n[[image:Tinmel mosque.jpg|thumb|Mosque erected in 1156 in honor of Ibn Tumart at [[Tinmel]], once part of a large fortified complex, the first headquarters of the [[Almohads]].]]\n\nIbn Tumart urged his followers to arms in open revolt against the [[Almoravid]]s, to fulfill the mission of purifying the Almoravid state. In 1122, or shortly thereafter (c. 1124<ref>Messier (2010:148)</ref>) he founded a [[ribat]] at [[Tinmel]] (or 'Tin Mal', meaning \"(she who is) white\"), in a small valley of the Nfis in the middle of the High Atlas. Tinmel was an impregnable fortified complex, which would serve both as spiritual center and military headquarters of the Almohad rebellion. It is during this period that he wrote a series of monographs on various doctrines for the instruction of his men. These disparate works were later collected and compiled in 1183\u201384, on the order of the Almohad caliph Yusuf ibn Abd al-Ma'mun (later translated in French in 1903, under the title ''Livre d'Ibn Toumert''.)\n\nSix principal [[Masmuda]] tribes adhered to the Almohad rebellion: Ibn Tumart's own Hargha tribe (from the [[Anti-Atlas]]) and the Ganfisa, the Gadmiwa, the Hintata, the Haskura and the Hazraja (roughly from west to east, along the [[High Atlas]] range).<ref>Julien, p.99</ref>\n\n[[image:Almohad_Masmuda_tribes.png|thumb|400px|Approximate locations of the main Masmuda tribes that adhered to the Almohads]]\nFor the next eight years, the Almohad revolt was largely confined to an irresolute guerilla war through the ravines and peaks of the Atlas range. The principal damage done by the Almohads at this stage was the disruption of Almoravid tax-collection, and rendering insecure (or altogether impassable) the roads and mountain passes south of Marrakesh. The [[Sous]] valley, surrounded on three sides by Almohadist Masmuda mountaineers, was nearly cut off and isolated. Of more particular concern to the Almoravids was their threat to the [[Ourika River|Ourika]] and [[Tizi n'Tichka]] passes, that connected Marrakesh to the [[Draa River|Draa]] valley on the other side of the High Atlas. These were the principal routes to the all-important city of [[Sijilmassa]], gateway of the [[trans-Saharan trade]], by which gold came from west Africa to Morocco. But the Almoravids were unable to send enough manpower through the narrow passes to dislodge the Almohad rebels from their easily defended mountain strongpoints. The Almoravid authorities reconciled themselves to setting up strongpoints to confine them (most famously the fortress of [[Tasghimout]] that protected the approach to [[Aghmat]]), while exploring alternative routes through more easterly passes.<ref name = kennedy/><ref>Messier, 2010: p.153-54)</ref>\n\nIbn Tumart's closest companion and chief strategist, al-Bashir, took upon himself the role of political commissar, enforcing doctrinal discipline among the Masmuda tribesmen, often with a heavy head. This culminated in an infamous purge (''tamyiz'') conducted by al-Bashir in the winter of 1129\u201330, with mass executions of disloyal partisans, which has been characterized as a brief \"reign of terror\".<ref name = kennedy/><ref>Messier (2010: p. 149) reports 15,000 men of Tinmel area were killed, and their wives and belongings distributed among the Almohad warriors.</ref>\n\n=== Battle of al-Buhayra ===\n\nIn early 1130, the Almohads finally descended from the mountains for their first sizeable attack on the Almoravids in the lowlands. It was a disaster. Al-Bashir (others report Abd al-Mu'min<ref>Messier (2010: p. 150\u201351)</ref>) led the Almohad armies first against [[Aghmat]]. They quickly defeated the Almoravid force that came out the meet them, and then chased their fleeing remnant back to [[Marrakesh]]. The Almohads set up a siege camp before Marrakesh, the first recorded siege of the Almoravid capital, whose walls had only recently been erected. The Almoravid emir Ali ibn Yusuf immediately called upon reinforcements from other parts of Morocco. After forty days of siege, in May (others date April 14, 1130<ref>Messier (2010: p. 151)</ref>), heartened by news of the approach of a relief column from Sijilmassa, the Almoravids sallied from Marrakesh in force and crushed the Almohads in the bloody [[Battle of al-Buhayra]] (named after a large garden east of the city). The Almohads were routed, suffering huge human losses - 12,000 men from the Hargha alone. Al-Bashir and several other leading figures were killed in action.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Islam'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=tPsUAAAAIAAJ&lpg=PA592&ots=tDnAHS-glP&dq=battle%20of%20al-Buhayra&pg=PA592#v=onepage&q&f=false p.592]</ref> If not for a sudden torrential rain that broke up the fighting and allowed the remnant to escape back to the mountains, the Almohads might have been finished off then and there.\n\nIn a bizarre and chilling footnote in the aftermath, it is said that Ibn Tumart returned to the battlefield at night with some of his followers, and ordered them to bury themselves in the field with a small straw to breathe by. Then, to invigorate the rest of the demoralized Almohads, he challenged those who doubted the righteousness of their cause, to go to the battlefield and ask the dead themselves if they were enjoying the blisses of heaven after falling in the fight for God's cause. When they heard the positive reply from the buried men, they were assuaged. To prevent the ruse from being revealed, it is said Ibn Thumart left them buried there, filling their straws so they would suffocate.<ref>[[James Edward Budgett-Meakin]], (1899) ''The Moorish Empire: a historical epitome'', London: Sonnenschein, [https://archive.org/details/ldpd_6769876_000/page/n94 p.69]</ref>\n\n== Almohads after Ibn Tumart ==\n\nIbn Tumart died in August 1130, only a few months after the disastrous defeat at al-Buhayra.<ref name = kennedy/> That the Almohad movement did not immediately collapse by the combined blows of the crushing defeat and large losses at the walls of Marrakesh, and the deaths of not only their spiritual leader, but also their chief military commanders, is testament to the careful organization that Ibn Tumart had built up at Tinmel.\n\nIbn Tumart had set up the Almohad commune as a minutely detailed pyramidical hierarchy with fourteen grades. At the top was the ''Ahl ad-Dar'' (the Mahdi's family), supplemented by a privy council known as the Council of Ten (''Ahl al-jam\u0101\u02bf\u0101'') which included the Ifriqiyan migrants who had first joined Ibn Tumart in Mellala. There was also a wider consultative \"Council of Fifty\", composed of the ''[[sheikh]]s'' of the major [[Masmuda]] Berber tribes - the Hargha (Ibn Tumart's tribe, which had primacy in the hierarchy among the tribes), the Ganfisa, the Gadmiwa, the Hintata, the Haskura and the Hazraja.<ref name = kennedy/> The Almohad military had been organized as arranged \"units\" named by tribe, with sub-units and internal hierarchies carefully and exactly spelled out. There were also organized groups of ''Talba'' and ''Huffaz'', the preachers that had been the original missionaries and spreaders of Ibn Tumart's message.\n\n===The Council of Ten===\n\nIbn Tumart organized the inner 'Council of Ten' (''Ahl al-jam\u0101\u02bf\u0101''), composed of the ten who had first borne witness to Ibn Tumart as ''Mahdi''. Several of them were drawn from the core of followers that Ibn Tumart had picked up in Ifriqiya (esp. while holding camp at [[Mallala, Algeria|Mallala]], outside of Bejaia, in 1119-20); others were local leaders drawn from the local Masmuda Berbers who had proven early adherents. Although the list has some variations and there is some dispute in names, the Council of Ten is frequently identified as follows:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aOeLAi38h4YC|title=The Almohads: The Rise of an Islamic Empire|last=Fromherz|first=Allen J.|date=|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2012|isbn=9781780764054|location=|pages=123\u2013124|language=en}}</ref>\n\n{|align=\"left\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+\n! width=\"200\" | Name || Notes\n|-\n| align=\"left\"|[[Abd al-Mu'min]] ibn Ali||align=\"left\"|originally from Tagra (near [[Tlemcen]], modern Algeria), Abd al-Mu'min was a Berber of the Kumiya tribe of the [[Zenata]] confederation.<ref>Julien, p.93</ref> Abd al-Mu'min adhered at Mellala, and was given the appellation of \"Lamp of the Almohads\" (''Siraj al-Muwahhidin'').

But it seems more probable (although passed over in the chronicles) that there was an intense power struggle for succession in the aftermath of Ibn Tumart's death.<ref name = kennedy/> With half the Council of Ten killed at al-Buhayra, Abd al-Mu'min laid claim as the \"successor\" of the Ibn Tumart (the term \"[[caliph]]\", as \"successor\" of the Mahdi emerged only later, in conscious imitation of the term's original use for the \"successors\" of the [[Prophet Muhammad]].) Abd al-Mu'min's claim was challenged by Ibn Malwiya (another survivor of the Ten) as well as by the Ahl al-Dar (Ibn Tumart's brothers).\n\nExactly how Abd al-Mu'min imposed himself is uncertain. As a [[Zenata]] Berber, Abd al-Mu'min was an alien among the Masmuda. But that foreignness itself might have recommended him as a neutral choice to the Masmuda ''sheikhs'', as it would avoid the appearance of favoritism towards any particular tribe. Nonetheless it is reported that the more easterly Masmuda tribes, the Haskura and the Harzaja, rejected Abd al-Mu'min's leadership and broke away from the Almohad coalition at this stage.<ref>Messier (2010: p. 153)</ref> Abd al-Mu'min would have to force them back to the fold. (Ibn Khaldun reports (improbably) that Abd al-Ma'mun managed to conceal the death of Ibn Tumart for nearly two years, in order to gather allies and marry the daughter of Omar Hintati, who would become his principal ally.) His principal rival Ibn Malwiya was captured, condemned and executed by 1132, and Ibn Tumart's own family soon disappears from significance, their roles eclipsed by Abd al-Mu'min's own family, the future dynasty of Almohad caliphs. Whatever doubts lingered about Abd al-Mu'min's leadership certainly dissipated a decade later, when Abd al-Mu'min led the renewed Almohads down from the mountains on a seven-year campaign of conquest of Morocco, culminating in the fall of Marrakesh in 1147.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Written by Ibn Tumart===\n* {{in lang|ar}} ''Le livre de Mohammed Ibn Toumert, mahdi des Almohades'', 1903 edition, [[Ign\u00e1c Goldziher]], editor, [[Algiers]]: P.
