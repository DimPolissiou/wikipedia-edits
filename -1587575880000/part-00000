[[Hal Draper]] defined socialism from above as the philosophy which employs an [[elite]] [[Administration (government)|administration]] to run the [[socialist state]]. The other side of socialism is a more democratic [[socialism from below]].<ref name=\"Two Souls\">{{cite web|last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Two Souls of Socialism|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/twosouls/twosouls.htm|date=1963}}</ref> Draper viewed socialism from below as being the purer, more [[Marxist]] version of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite book|last=Young|first=James D.|title=Socialism Since 1889: A Biographical History|date=1988|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|location=Totowa|isbn=978-0-389-20813-6}}</ref> [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were devoutly opposed to any socialist institution that was \"conducive to superstitious authoritarianism\". Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently. In either case, this new ruling class is likely to see its goal as an Education Dictatorship over the masses \u2013 to Do Them Good, of course \u2013 the dictatorship being exercised by an elite party which suppresses all control from below, or by benevolent despots or Savior-Leaders of some kind, or by Shaw's \"Supermen,\" by eugenic manipulators, by Proudhon's \"anarchist\" managers or Saint-Simon's technocrats or their more modern equivalents \u2013 with up-to-date terms and new verbal screens which can be hailed as fresh social theory as against \"nineteenth-century Marxism.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/>}}\n\nThe idea of socialism from above is much more frequently discussed in elite circles than socialism from below\u2014even if that is the Marxist ideal\u2014because it is more practical.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n=== Utopian socialism ===\nThe first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent. [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] is regarded as the first individual to coin the term [[socialism]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html|title=Adam Smith|publisher=Macrohistory|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/socfrombel/sfb_2.htm|title=Birth of the Socialist Idea|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/> The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to progress.<ref>Newman, Michael (2005). ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century. He recognized and was acutely critical of the trends of socialism from above in collectivism, including theories that were based in voluntary cooperation.<ref name=\"Ebenstein\">{{cite book|last=Ebenstein|first=Alan|author-link=Alan O.

According to Hayek, it is in this way that it becomes possible for [[totalitarian]] leaders to rise to power as happened in the years following World War I.<ref name=\"Hayek\"/> [[Austrian School]] economists such as Hayek and his mentor [[Ludwig Mises]] also continually used the word ''socialism'' as a synonym for authoritarian socialism, central planning and state socialism, conflating it with fascism,<ref name=\"Mises\">Mises, Ludwig (1936) [1922].

In reply, Hayek warned against confusing \"totalitarianism with authoritarianism\" and said that he was unaware of \"any totalitarian governments in Latin America.

''Economic Devolution in Eastern Europe''. New York: Praeger.</ref> The central planning authority is responsible for five specific tasks:\n# Determining the criteria for the economic calculations of the planning decisions.\n# Determining and quantifying targets to be achieved within the a specified period.\n# Coordinating targets to ensure the plan is consistent and reliable.\n# Determining the methods to ensure the realization of the plan.\n# Revising targets in accordance to changing economic calculations.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/>\n\nThe planning process involved the creation of one-year plans, five-year plans and long-term plans. The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations. The long-term plans encompassed a global strategy development. This plan was about goals for the state and society, not about individual responsibilities. Structural changes were a main theme.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/><ref>Sejna, Jan (1986). ''Decision-Making in Communist Countries: An Inside View''.

It has been argued that authoritarian socialist states failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of [[state enterprise]]s in their administrative, command allocation of [[resources]] and [[commodities]] and the lack of [[democracy]] in the political systems that the authoritarian socialist economies were combined with. A form of competitive socialism that rejects [[dictatorship]] and authoritarian allocation of resources in favor of [[economic democracy]] could work and prove superior to the [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First|last1=Gregory|first1=Paul|last2=Stuart|first2=Robert|publisher=South-Western College Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-618-26181-8|page=152}}</ref> Others have argued that a central deficiency of such economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, but that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.<ref>Mandel, Ernest (1986).

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

[[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods.

''Alternative Economic Models of Transition''. Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971).

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Systematic economic challenges ===\n{{see also|Soviet-type economic planning}}\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998). ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

[https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1931/02/04.htm \"The Tasks of Business Executives\"].</ref> Acknowledging this inadequacy, Stalin ordered that resources slotted for consumption be redirected to production or exported as a temporary sacrifice on the part of the population for the sake of rapid growth.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The model was successful initially, with ideology and nationalism promoting morale despite shortages in resources such as food and construction materials for housing. Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era. The Soviet attempt to [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivize agriculture]], transforming the Soviet Union from one of the world's largest exporters of grain to the world's largest importer of grain, was widely replicated despite its failure.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Many historians claim that extermination was the fate of a wide variety of people during Stalin's regime such as political opponents, ideological rivals, suspect party members, accused military officers, kulaks, lower-class families, former members of the societal elites, ethnic groups, religious groups and the relatives and sympathizers of these offenders.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/><ref name=\"The Case\"/><ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> These deaths occurred as a result of collectivization, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag. As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\" /> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\" />\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialization and social equalization of Arab nations and often were characterized by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|date=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far. They allowed important political and economic gains to be made by workers, encouraged land redistribution, unseated oligarchical political powers and implemented [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substituting]] industrialization development strategies.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\nWith the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] following the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991 as well as the push for [[democratization]], many Arab states have moved toward a model of fiscal discipline proposed by the [[Washington Consensus]].<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Although authoritarian leaders of those states implemented democratic institutions during the 1980s and 1990s, their multi-party elections created an arena in which business elites could lobby for personal interests while largely silencing the lower class.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Economic liberalization in these regions yielded economies that led to regimes built on the support of rent-seeking urban elites, with political opposition inviting the prospect of political marginalization and even retaliation.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\n==== Resistance to democratization ====\n[[File:WOSM-WAGGGS-Arab Region.svg|thumb|[[Arab world]]]]\nA great deal of debate has been paid by the field of comparative politics to how the Arab region was able to avoid the [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave of democratization]].

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness. [...] But the government cannot and must not do it all. It must be helped by the party. [...] Our party must be the consciousness of the masses\".<ref name=\"Gregor\"/>\n\n==== Ghana ====\nIn the same vein as Senghor, socialist leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]] sought to advance this one-party, nationalized form of socialist obedience. Nkrumah stressed the importance of government-owned property and resources.

However, elite landowners questioned the legitimacy of Nkrumah's power. Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state. Gradually, those who were not granted or did not desire entrance into the party created regions blocs.<ref name=\"Redl\">{{cite book|last=Riedl|first=Rachel|title=Authoritarian Origins of Democratic Party Systems in Africa|date=February 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=108}}</ref> The [[Ashanti people|Asante]] emerged as a regional force capable political sway.

In the system, all Tanzanains were encouraged to run for office, with no campaign funding allowed. Speeches in the election would not focus on the national issues, but rather on the quality of the individual, each of whom would be closely controlled by TANU.<ref name=\"Pratt\"/> Structurally, the power was shared along regional boundaries, giving increased policy making power and resource allocation to these regions.

The other side of socialism is a more democratic [[socialism from below]].<ref name=\"Two Souls\">{{cite web|last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Two Souls of Socialism|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/twosouls/twosouls.htm|date=1963}}</ref> Draper viewed socialism from below as being the purer, more [[Marxist]] version of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite book|last=Young|first=James D.|title=Socialism Since 1889: A Biographical History|date=1988|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|location=Totowa|isbn=978-0-389-20813-6}}</ref> [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were devoutly opposed to any socialist institution that was \"conducive to superstitious authoritarianism\". Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently.

Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century.

In reply, Hayek warned against confusing \"totalitarianism with authoritarianism\" and said that he was unaware of \"any totalitarian governments in Latin America.

The party's decisions are so integrated into public life that its economic and non-economic decisions are part of their overall actions.\n* State ownership of the means of production in which natural resources and capital belong to society.\n* Central economic planning, the main characteristic of an authoritarian, state socialist economy. The market is planned by a central government agency, generally a state planning commission.\n* Socially-equitable distribution of the national income in which goods and services are provided for free by the state that supplement private consumption.\n\nThis economic model is greatly characterized by the government's central planning.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\">Wilczynski, J.

[...] The sale of labour power is abolished and labour necessarily becomes creative. Everyone participates in running their institutions and society as a whole.

''Economic Devolution in Eastern Europe''. New York: Praeger.</ref> The central planning authority is responsible for five specific tasks:\n# Determining the criteria for the economic calculations of the planning decisions.\n# Determining and quantifying targets to be achieved within the a specified period.\n# Coordinating targets to ensure the plan is consistent and reliable.\n# Determining the methods to ensure the realization of the plan.\n# Revising targets in accordance to changing economic calculations.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/>\n\nThe planning process involved the creation of one-year plans, five-year plans and long-term plans. The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations. The long-term plans encompassed a global strategy development. This plan was about goals for the state and society, not about individual responsibilities. Structural changes were a main theme.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/><ref>Sejna, Jan (1986). ''Decision-Making in Communist Countries: An Inside View''.

It has been argued that authoritarian socialist states failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of [[state enterprise]]s in their administrative, command allocation of [[resources]] and [[commodities]] and the lack of [[democracy]] in the political systems that the authoritarian socialist economies were combined with. A form of competitive socialism that rejects [[dictatorship]] and authoritarian allocation of resources in favor of [[economic democracy]] could work and prove superior to the [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First|last1=Gregory|first1=Paul|last2=Stuart|first2=Robert|publisher=South-Western College Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-618-26181-8|page=152}}</ref> Others have argued that a central deficiency of such economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, but that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.<ref>Mandel, Ernest (1986).

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

[[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland.

Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods.

''Alternative Economic Models of Transition''. Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971).

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Systematic economic challenges ===\n{{see also|Soviet-type economic planning}}\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998). ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era. The Soviet attempt to [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivize agriculture]], transforming the Soviet Union from one of the world's largest exporters of grain to the world's largest importer of grain, was widely replicated despite its failure.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Many historians claim that extermination was the fate of a wide variety of people during Stalin's regime such as political opponents, ideological rivals, suspect party members, accused military officers, kulaks, lower-class families, former members of the societal elites, ethnic groups, religious groups and the relatives and sympathizers of these offenders.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/><ref name=\"The Case\"/><ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> These deaths occurred as a result of collectivization, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag. As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n==== Maoism ====\n[[Maoism]] is an adapted Sino-centric version of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].<ref name=\"Esh\">{{cite journal|last=Esherick|first=Joseph W.|title=On the \"Restoration of Capitalism\": Mao and Marxist Theory|journal=Modern China|date=January 1979|volume=5|issue=1|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1177/009770047900500102}}</ref> While believing in [[democratic centralism]], where party decisions are brought about by scrutiny and debate and then are binding upon all members of the party once implemented, Mao did not accept dissenters to the party's decisions.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> Through the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], Mao attempted to purge any subversive idea\u2014especially capitalist or Western threat\u2014with heavy force, justifying his actions as the necessary way for the central authority to keep power.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Mao emphasized the importance of cultural heritage and individual choice as a way of creating this national unity. He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\" /> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\" />\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialization and social equalization of Arab nations and often were characterized by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|date=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness. [...] But the government cannot and must not do it all. It must be helped by the party. [...] Our party must be the consciousness of the masses\".<ref name=\"Gregor\"/>\n\n==== Ghana ====\nIn the same vein as Senghor, socialist leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]] sought to advance this one-party, nationalized form of socialist obedience. Nkrumah stressed the importance of government-owned property and resources.

However, elite landowners questioned the legitimacy of Nkrumah's power. Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state. Gradually, those who were not granted or did not desire entrance into the party created regions blocs.<ref name=\"Redl\">{{cite book|last=Riedl|first=Rachel|title=Authoritarian Origins of Democratic Party Systems in Africa|date=February 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=108}}</ref> The [[Ashanti people|Asante]] emerged as a regional force capable political sway.

In the system, all Tanzanains were encouraged to run for office, with no campaign funding allowed. Speeches in the election would not focus on the national issues, but rather on the quality of the individual, each of whom would be closely controlled by TANU.<ref name=\"Pratt\"/> Structurally, the power was shared along regional boundaries, giving increased policy making power and resource allocation to these regions.

He would frequently pack dense mounds of snow in front of his position to conceal himself, provide padding for his rifle, and reduce the characteristic puff of snow stirred up by the muzzle blast.

The first idea at American, a special \"loyalty fare\", was modified and expanded to offer free first class tickets and upgrades to first class for companions, or discounted coach tickets. Membership was seeded by searching AA's SABRE computer reservations system for recurring phone numbers. The 130,000 most frequent flyers, plus an additional 60,000 members of AA's Admirals Club were pre-enrolled and sent letters with their new account numbers. The name was selected by AA's advertising agency, and is consistent with other American Airlines programs featuring \"AA\" in the name and logo. The logo was designed by [[Massimo Vignelli]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vignelli.com/clients/corpro.html |title=Poster |website=Vignelli.com |accessdate=2016-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207102220/http://www.vignelli.com/clients/corpro.html |archive-date=December 7, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLess than a week later, rival [[United Airlines]] launched its [[MileagePlus]] program; other airlines followed in the ensuing months and years. The rapid appearance of competition changed the nature of the program, and as airlines began to compete on the features of their frequent flyer programs, AAdvantage liberalized its rules, established partnerships with hotel and rental car agencies, and offered promotions such as extra free beverages. In 1982 AAdvantage also became the first program to cooperate with an international carrier; members could accrue and redeem miles on British Airways flights to Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Big 2\u20135 \u2013 Celebrating 25 Years of Frequent Flyer Programs |url=http://www.insideflyer.com/articles/o2.php?key=89 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130126105757/http://www.insideflyer.com/articles/o2.php?key=89 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 26, 2013 |publisher=Frequent Flyer Network |website=Insideflyer.com |accessdate=June 28, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, major airlines, including American, offered triple miles.

The first idea at American, a special \"loyalty fare\", was modified and expanded to offer free first class tickets and upgrades to first class for companions, or discounted coach tickets. Membership was seeded by searching AA's SABRE computer reservations system for recurring phone numbers. The 130,000 most frequent flyers, plus an additional 60,000 members of AA's Admirals Club were pre-enrolled and sent letters with their new account numbers. The name was selected by AA's advertising agency, and is consistent with other American Airlines programs featuring \"AA\" in the name and logo. The logo was designed by [[Massimo Vignelli]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vignelli.com/clients/corpro.html |title=Poster |website=Vignelli.com |accessdate=2016-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207102220/http://www.vignelli.com/clients/corpro.html |archive-date=December 7, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLess than a week later, rival [[United Airlines]] launched its [[MileagePlus]] program; other airlines followed in the ensuing months and years. The rapid appearance of competition changed the nature of the program, and as airlines began to compete on the features of their frequent flyer programs, AAdvantage liberalized its rules, established partnerships with hotel and rental car agencies, and offered promotions such as extra free beverages. In 1982 AAdvantage also became the first program to cooperate with an international carrier; members could accrue and redeem miles on British Airways flights to Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Big 2\u20135 \u2013 Celebrating 25 Years of Frequent Flyer Programs |url=http://www.insideflyer.com/articles/o2.php?key=89 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130126105757/http://www.insideflyer.com/articles/o2.php?key=89 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 26, 2013 |publisher=Frequent Flyer Network |website=Insideflyer.com |accessdate=June 28, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, major airlines, including American, offered triple miles.

The plot centers on a [[pandemic]] of a weaponized strain of [[influenza]] that kills almost the entire world population. The few survivors, united in groups, establish a new social system and engage in confrontation with each other. In writing the book, King sought to create an epic in the spirit of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' that was set in contemporary America. The book was difficult for King to write because of the large number of characters and storylines.\n\nIn 1990, ''The Stand'' was reprinted as a ''Complete and Uncut Edition''. King restored some fragments of texts that were initially reduced, revised the order of the chapters, shifted the novel's setting from 1980 to 10 years forward, and accordingly corrected a number of cultural references. The ''Complete and Uncut Edition'' of ''The Stand'' is considered to be King's longest stand-alone work. The book has sold 4.5 million copies.\n\n''The Stand'' was highly appreciated by literary critics and is considered one of King's best novels. It has been included in lists of the best books of all time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', the [[Modern Library]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] and the [[BBC]]. Reviewers praised the believability of the story, the relevance of the issues raised and the liveliness of the characters, but criticized the protractedness of individual episodes, the plot dualism and the deliberate denouement. A [[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|self-titled miniseries]] based on the novel was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1994. From 2008 to 2012, [[Marvel Comics]] published a [[The Stand (comics)|series of comics]] written by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] and illustrated by [[Mike Perkins]]. A [[The Stand (upcoming miniseries)|miniseries]] to air on [[CBS All Access]] is in development.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nAn extremely contagious and lethal strain of [[influenza]], resistant to antibodies and vaccines, is developed as a [[Biological warfare|biological weapon]] within a secret [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] laboratory, and is accidentally released. The ''Complete and Uncut Edition'' includes a prologue detailing the development of the virus and the security breach that causes its release. The laboratory staff die, but security guard Charles Campion manages to escape and takes his family out of state. After a couple of days, his car crashes at a gas station in Arnette, Texas. The gas station employees and ambulance workers are infected when they take the dying Campion out of his car and to a hospital. The gas station owner infects his cousin, a highway patrolman, and the virus rapidly spreads uncontrollably from there. The [[United States Army]] attempts to isolate Arnette, going as far as to execute unarmed civilians, but the efforts are in vain \u2013 the virus, christened by journalists as the \"superflu\" or \"Captain Trips\", spreads across the country and travels beyond its borders, triggering a global [[pandemic]] of apocalyptic proportions. Approximately 99.4% of the world's population is infected and killed within a month. A prism of several personal tragedies describes the collapse of society, explosions of violence, the inability of the government and [[martial law]] to stop the pandemic, and the near-extinction of humanity. Many survivors of the virus also die, unable to accept the loss of their loved ones or survive in a world where they must fend for themselves.\n\nStuart Redman, one of the gas station employees, proves immune to the virus. He is forcibly held in a specialized center in Stovington, Vermont, in the hope that a treatment can be made. Redman escapes after the center's staff dies; he is forced to kill one of the members in self-defense. He meets with sociology professor Glen Bateman, pregnant college student Frannie Goldsmith, and teenage outcast Harold Lauder. Larry Underwood, a disillusioned pop singer, joins the group in the wake of his mother's death. Stuart and Frannie are drawn to each other and become lovers, to Harold's disappointment and resentment. The group share a common dream in which they see a 106-year-old black woman living in [[Hemingford, Nebraska|Hemingford Home, Nebraska]].<ref>King used Hemingford, NE for both novels, ''The Stand'', and ''It'', America's heartland location for Mother Abagail. '''The Denver Post''', ''USA Weekend'', March 19\u201320, 2010, usaweekend.com, page 2.</ref> The woman, Abagail Freemantle \u2013 better known as \"Mother Abagail\" \u2013 becomes the group's spiritual leader. She brings the group to [[Boulder, Colorado]], to which other survivors are attracted by her telepathic appeals. New additions to the group include Nick Andros, a [[deaf-mute]] deputy from Shoyo, Arkansas; Tom Cullen, a kind-hearted, mentally challenged man from May, Oklahoma; Nadine Cross, a teacher from New Hampshire; and Ralph Brentner, a good-natured farmer from Oklahoma. The group attempts to build a new society. They call their land the \"Free Zone\", organize funeral brigades and restore a supply of electricity.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Randall Flagg]], a \"dark man\" possessing supernatural abilities, creates his own society from people called by his visions. The people worship Flagg as a messiah and joyfully submit to his fascist dictatorship, in which drug addicts are crucified. Flagg rescues potentially cannibalistic prisoner Lloyd Henreid and makes him his right-hand man. A [[Pyromania|pyromaniac]] nicknamed \"the Trashcan Man\", after destroying oil tanks in [[Gary, Indiana]] and meeting a madman named \"the Kid\", joins Flagg's group and becomes a weapons specialist. Flagg prepares for war with Boulder. Mother Abagail, feeling that she has become prideful due to her pleasure at being a public figure, disappears into the wilderness on a journey of spiritual reconciliation. During her absence, the Free Zone's leadership committee decides to secretly send three people to Flagg's territory to act as spies. Harold and Nadine, tempted by Flagg through their dreams, stage an attack on the committee with a bomb. The explosion kills several people, but most of the committee members avoid the explosion thanks to Mother Abagail's return. Before dying of exhaustion, Mother Abagail reports God's will \u2013 Stuart, Glen, Larry and Ralph must go to Las Vegas and destroy Flagg.\n\nStuart breaks his leg en route and persuades the others to go on without him, telling them that God will provide for him if that is what is meant to happen. The remaining three are soon taken prisoner by Flagg's army. When Glen refuses to grovel before Flagg, he is killed by Lloyd. Flagg gathers his entire collective to witness the execution of Ralph and Larry. Moments before they are to be killed, the Trashcan Man arrives with a retrieved [[nuclear warhead]]. Flagg conjures a magical ball of energy in an attempt to silence a dissenter, but it is transformed into a giant glowing hand \u2014 \"the Hand of God\" \u2014 which detonates the bomb, destroying Las Vegas and killing all of Flagg's followers, in addition to Larry and Ralph. The inhabitants of Boulder anxiously await the birth of Frannie's baby. They fear that the child may not possess an immunity to the superflu and may die, implying a permanent end to humanity. Soon after she gives birth to her son, Stuart returns to Boulder, having been rescued first by a dog, Kojak, and then by Tom, the only survivor of the three Free Zone spies. The baby, Peter, manages to fight off the superflu. Stuart and Frannie decide to leave Boulder and move to [[Ogunquit]] as society is slowly reestablished. The ''Complete and Uncut Edition'' includes an [[epilogue]] in which Flagg, having survived the nuclear explosion, wakes up somewhere in the Southern Hemisphere. Regaining his former strength, he begins recruiting adherents among a preliterate, dark-skinned people.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Stand characters}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn [[Danse Macabre (book)|''Danse Macabre'']], King writes about the origins of ''The Stand'' at some length. One source was [[Patty Hearst]]'s case. The original idea was to create a novel about the episode because \"it seemed that only a novel might really succeed in explaining all the contradictions\".\n\nThe author also mentions [[George R. Stewart]]'s novel ''[[Earth Abides]]'', which describes the odyssey of one of the last human survivors after the population is nearly annihilated by a plague, as one of the main inspirations:\n\n<blockquote>\nWith my Patty Hearst book, I never found the right way in... and during that entire six-week period, something else was nagging very quietly at the back of my mind. It was a news story I had read about an accidental CBW spill in Utah. (...) This article called up memories of a novel called ''Earth Abides'', by George R.

I just couldn't figure out how to do it. Then . . . after my wife and kids and I moved to Boulder, Colorado, I saw a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' segment on CBW (chemical-biological warfare). I never forgot the gruesome footage of the test mice shuddering, convulsing, and dying, all in twenty seconds or less. That got me remembering a chemical spill in Utah, that [[Dugway sheep incident|killed a bunch of sheep]] (these were canisters on their way to some burial ground; they fell off the truck and ruptured). I remembered a news reporter saying, 'If the winds had been blowing the other way, there was [[Salt Lake City]].' This incident later served as the basis of a movie called ''[[Rage (1972 film)|Rage]]'', starring [[George C. Scott]], but before it was released, I was deep into ''The Stand'', finally writing my American fantasy epic, set in a plague-decimated USA. Only instead of a hobbit, my hero was a Texan named Stu Redman, and instead of a Dark Lord, my villain was a ruthless drifter and supernatural madman named [[Randall Flagg]]. The land of [[Mordor]] ('where the shadows lie,' according to [[Tolkien]]) was played by Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = King\n  | first = Stephen\n  | title = ''Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition'': The Inspiration\n  | url=http://www.stephenking.com/library/novel/stand:_the_complete__uncut_edition_the_inspiration.html\n  | accessdate = 2008-08-24 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile writing ''The Stand'', King nearly stopped because of [[writer's block]].<ref>''On Writing'', Stephen King, 2000.</ref> Eventually, he reached the conclusion that the heroes were becoming too complacent, and were beginning to repeat all the same mistakes of their old society. In an attempt to resolve this, he added the part of the storyline where Harold and Nadine construct a bomb, which explodes in a Free Zone committee meeting, killing Nick Andros, Chad Norris, and Susan Stern. Later, Mother Abagail explains on her deathbed that God permitted the bombing because He was dissatisfied with the heroes' focus on petty politics, and not on the ultimate quest of destroying Flagg. When telling this story, King sardonically observed that the bomb saved the book, and that he only had to kill half of the core cast to do this.\n\n== Publication history ==\n\nThe novel was originally published in 1978 in hardcover, with a setting date of 1980, in abridged form. The first paperback release in 1980 changed the setting date to 1985. The novel marks the first appearance of [[Randall Flagg]], King's recurring antagonist, whom King would bring back many times in his later writings.\n\n{{Infobox book|\n| name         = The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition\n| title_orig   =\n| translator   =\n| image        = The Stand Uncut.jpg\n| caption      = ''The Complete and Uncut Edition'' cover\n| author       = [[Stephen King]]\n| cover_artist = John Cayea\n| country      = US\n| language     = English\n| series       =\n| genre        = [[Postapocalyptic]]\n| publisher    = [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]\n| release_date = May 1990\n| media_type   = Print\n| pages        = 1,152\n| isbn         = 978-0-385-19957-5\n| preceded_by  =\n| followed_by  =\n}}\n\nIn 1990, an unabridged edition of ''The Stand'' was published, billed as ''The Complete and Uncut Edition''.

During the 1980s, Stephen King had planned a theatrical film, with [[George A. Romero]] directing and himself writing, not trusting anybody else with the project. However, writing a workable screenplay proved difficult, due to the novel's length. King talked about adapting it for television, but was informed that the television networks did not \"want to see the end of the world, particularly in prime time.\" Eventually King allowed screenwriter [[Rospo Pallenberg]], who was a fan of ''The Stand'', to write his own adaptation of the novel. Pallenberg's script would clock the film in at close to three hours, while still staying true to the novel. Everyone liked the script; however, just as it was about to finally come together, [[Warner Bros.]] backed out of the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060708173256/http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2006 |title=THE RISE AND FALL OF \"THE STAND\" |publisher=subcin.com |author=Hixx, Don Alex |accessdate=2013-04-18 |df=mdy-all }}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] eventually offered Stephen King the chance to make ''The Stand'' into an eight-hour [[television miniseries|miniseries]].

The plot centers on a [[pandemic]] of a weaponized strain of [[influenza]] that kills almost the entire world population. The few survivors, united in groups, establish a new social system and engage in confrontation with each other. In writing the book, King sought to create an epic in the spirit of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' that was set in contemporary America. The book was difficult for King to write because of the large number of characters and storylines.\n\nIn 1990, ''The Stand'' was reprinted as a ''Complete and Uncut Edition''. King restored some fragments of texts that were initially reduced, revised the order of the chapters, shifted the novel's setting from 1980 to 10 years forward, and accordingly corrected a number of cultural references. The ''Complete and Uncut Edition'' of ''The Stand'' is considered to be King's longest stand-alone work. The book has sold 4.5 million copies.\n\n''The Stand'' was highly appreciated by literary critics and is considered one of King's best novels. It has been included in lists of the best books of all time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', the [[Modern Library]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] and the [[BBC]]. Reviewers praised the believability of the story, the relevance of the issues raised and the liveliness of the characters, but criticized the protractedness of individual episodes, the plot dualism and the deliberate denouement. A [[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|self-titled miniseries]] based on the novel was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1994. From 2008 to 2012, [[Marvel Comics]] published a [[The Stand (comics)|series of comics]] written by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] and illustrated by [[Mike Perkins]]. A [[The Stand (upcoming miniseries)|miniseries]] to air on [[CBS All Access]] is in development.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nAn extremely contagious and lethal strain of [[influenza]], resistant to antibodies and vaccines, is developed as a [[Biological warfare|biological weapon]] within a secret [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] laboratory, and is accidentally released. The ''Complete and Uncut Edition'' includes a prologue detailing the development of the virus and the security breach that causes its release. The laboratory staff die, but security guard Charles Campion manages to escape and takes his family out of state. After a couple of days, his car crashes at a gas station in Arnette, Texas. The gas station employees and ambulance workers are infected when they take the dying Campion out of his car and to a hospital. The gas station owner infects his cousin, a highway patrolman, and the virus rapidly spreads uncontrollably from there. The [[United States Army]] attempts to isolate Arnette, going as far as to execute unarmed civilians, but the efforts are in vain \u2013 the virus, christened by journalists as the \"superflu\" or \"Captain Trips\", spreads across the country and travels beyond its borders, triggering a global [[pandemic]] of apocalyptic proportions. Approximately 99.4% of the world's population is infected and killed within a month. A prism of several personal tragedies describes the collapse of society, explosions of violence, the inability of the government and [[martial law]] to stop the pandemic, and the near-extinction of humanity. Many survivors of the virus also die, unable to accept the loss of their loved ones or survive in a world where they must fend for themselves.\n\nStuart Redman, one of the gas station employees, proves immune to the virus. He is forcibly held in a specialized center in Stovington, Vermont, in the hope that a treatment can be made. Redman escapes after the center's staff dies; he is forced to kill one of the members in self-defense. He meets with sociology professor Glen Bateman, pregnant college student Frannie Goldsmith, and teenage outcast Harold Lauder. Larry Underwood, a disillusioned pop singer, joins the group in the wake of his mother's death. Stuart and Frannie are drawn to each other and become lovers, to Harold's disappointment and resentment. The group share a common dream in which they see a 108-year-old black woman living in [[Hemingford, Nebraska|Hemingford Home, Nebraska]].<ref>King used Hemingford, NE for both novels, ''The Stand'', and ''It'', America's heartland location for Mother Abagail. '''The Denver Post''', ''USA Weekend'', March 19\u201320, 2010, usaweekend.com, page 2.</ref> The woman, Abagail Freemantle \u2013 better known as \"Mother Abagail\" \u2013 becomes the group's spiritual leader. She brings the group to [[Boulder, Colorado]], to which other survivors are attracted by her telepathic appeals. New additions to the group include Nick Andros, a [[deaf-mute]] deputy from Shoyo, Arkansas; Tom Cullen, a kind-hearted, mentally challenged man from May, Oklahoma; Nadine Cross, a teacher from New Hampshire; and Ralph Brentner, a good-natured farmer from Oklahoma. The group attempts to build a new society. They call their land the \"Free Zone\", organize funeral brigades and restore a supply of electricity.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Randall Flagg]], a \"dark man\" possessing supernatural abilities, creates his own society from people called by his visions. The people worship Flagg as a messiah and joyfully submit to his fascist dictatorship, in which drug addicts are crucified. Flagg rescues potentially cannibalistic prisoner Lloyd Henreid and makes him his right-hand man. A [[Pyromania|pyromaniac]] nicknamed \"the Trashcan Man\", after destroying oil tanks in [[Gary, Indiana]] and meeting a madman named \"the Kid\", joins Flagg's group and becomes a weapons specialist. Flagg prepares for war with Boulder. Mother Abagail, feeling that she has become prideful due to her pleasure at being a public figure, disappears into the wilderness on a journey of spiritual reconciliation. During her absence, the Free Zone's leadership committee decides to secretly send three people to Flagg's territory to act as spies. Harold and Nadine, tempted by Flagg through their dreams, stage an attack on the committee with a bomb. The explosion kills several people, but most of the committee members avoid the explosion thanks to Mother Abagail's return. Before dying of exhaustion, Mother Abagail reports God's will \u2013 Stuart, Glen, Larry and Ralph must go to Las Vegas and destroy Flagg.\n\nStuart breaks his leg en route and persuades the others to go on without him, telling them that God will provide for him if that is what is meant to happen. The remaining three are soon taken prisoner by Flagg's army. When Glen refuses to grovel before Flagg, he is killed by Lloyd. Flagg gathers his entire collective to witness the execution of Ralph and Larry. Moments before they are to be killed, the Trashcan Man arrives with a retrieved [[nuclear warhead]]. Flagg conjures a magical ball of energy in an attempt to silence a dissenter, but it is transformed into a giant glowing hand \u2014 \"the Hand of God\" \u2014 which detonates the bomb, destroying Las Vegas and killing all of Flagg's followers, in addition to Larry and Ralph. The inhabitants of Boulder anxiously await the birth of Frannie's baby. They fear that the child may not possess an immunity to the superflu and may die, implying a permanent end to humanity. Soon after she gives birth to her son, Stuart returns to Boulder, having been rescued first by a dog, Kojak, and then by Tom, the only survivor of the three Free Zone spies. The baby, Peter, manages to fight off the superflu. Stuart and Frannie decide to leave Boulder and move to [[Ogunquit]] as society is slowly reestablished. The ''Complete and Uncut Edition'' includes an [[epilogue]] in which Flagg, having survived the nuclear explosion, wakes up somewhere in the Southern Hemisphere. Regaining his former strength, he begins recruiting adherents among a preliterate, dark-skinned people.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Stand characters}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn [[Danse Macabre (book)|''Danse Macabre'']], King writes about the origins of ''The Stand'' at some length. One source was [[Patty Hearst]]'s case. The original idea was to create a novel about the episode because \"it seemed that only a novel might really succeed in explaining all the contradictions\".\n\nThe author also mentions [[George R. Stewart]]'s novel ''[[Earth Abides]]'', which describes the odyssey of one of the last human survivors after the population is nearly annihilated by a plague, as one of the main inspirations:\n\n<blockquote>\nWith my Patty Hearst book, I never found the right way in... and during that entire six-week period, something else was nagging very quietly at the back of my mind. It was a news story I had read about an accidental CBW spill in Utah. (...) This article called up memories of a novel called ''Earth Abides'', by George R. Stewart.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n(...) and one day while sitting at my typewriter, (...) I wrote\u2014just to write something: The world comes to an end but everybody in the SLA is somehow immune. Snake bit them. I looked at that for a while and then typed: No more gas shortages. That was sort of cheerful, in a horrible sort of way.\n<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = King\n  | first = Stephen\n  | authorlink = Stephen King\n  | title = Stephen King's Danse Macabre\n  | publisher = Berkeley Trade\n  | page = 370\n  | isbn = 0-425-18160-X }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n''The Stand'' was also planned by King as an epic ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''\u2013type story in a contemporary American setting:\n\n<blockquote>For a long time\u2014ten years, at least\u2014I had wanted to write a fantasy epic like ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', only with an American setting. I just couldn't figure out how to do it. Then . . . after my wife and kids and I moved to Boulder, Colorado, I saw a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' segment on CBW (chemical-biological warfare). I never forgot the gruesome footage of the test mice shuddering, convulsing, and dying, all in twenty seconds or less. That got me remembering a chemical spill in Utah, that [[Dugway sheep incident|killed a bunch of sheep]] (these were canisters on their way to some burial ground; they fell off the truck and ruptured). I remembered a news reporter saying, 'If the winds had been blowing the other way, there was [[Salt Lake City]].' This incident later served as the basis of a movie called ''[[Rage (1972 film)|Rage]]'', starring [[George C. Scott]], but before it was released, I was deep into ''The Stand'', finally writing my American fantasy epic, set in a plague-decimated USA. Only instead of a hobbit, my hero was a Texan named Stu Redman, and instead of a Dark Lord, my villain was a ruthless drifter and supernatural madman named [[Randall Flagg]]. The land of [[Mordor]] ('where the shadows lie,' according to [[Tolkien]]) was played by Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = King\n  | first = Stephen\n  | title = ''Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition'': The Inspiration\n  | url=http://www.stephenking.com/library/novel/stand:_the_complete__uncut_edition_the_inspiration.html\n  | accessdate = 2008-08-24 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile writing ''The Stand'', King nearly stopped because of [[writer's block]].<ref>''On Writing'', Stephen King, 2000.</ref> Eventually, he reached the conclusion that the heroes were becoming too complacent, and were beginning to repeat all the same mistakes of their old society. In an attempt to resolve this, he added the part of the storyline where Harold and Nadine construct a bomb, which explodes in a Free Zone committee meeting, killing Nick Andros, Chad Norris, and Susan Stern. Later, Mother Abagail explains on her deathbed that God permitted the bombing because He was dissatisfied with the heroes' focus on petty politics, and not on the ultimate quest of destroying Flagg. When telling this story, King sardonically observed that the bomb saved the book, and that he only had to kill half of the core cast to do this.\n\n== Publication history ==\n\nThe novel was originally published in 1978 in hardcover, with a setting date of 1980, in abridged form. The first paperback release in 1980 changed the setting date to 1985. The novel marks the first appearance of [[Randall Flagg]], King's recurring antagonist, whom King would bring back many times in his later writings.\n\n{{Infobox book|\n| name         = The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition\n| title_orig   =\n| translator   =\n| image        = The Stand Uncut.jpg\n| caption      = ''The Complete and Uncut Edition'' cover\n| author       = [[Stephen King]]\n| cover_artist = John Cayea\n| country      = US\n| language     = English\n| series       =\n| genre        = [[Postapocalyptic]]\n| publisher    = [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]\n| release_date = May 1990\n| media_type   = Print\n| pages        = 1,152\n| isbn         = 978-0-385-19957-5\n| preceded_by  =\n| followed_by  =\n}}\n\nIn 1990, an unabridged edition of ''The Stand'' was published, billed as ''The Complete and Uncut Edition''. Published in hardcover by Doubleday in May 1990, this became the longest book published by King at 1,152 pages. When the novel was originally published in 1978, Doubleday warned King that the book's size would make it too expensive for the market to bear.<ref>{{cite book |last= King |first= Stephen |date= 1990 |title= The Stand: The Complete And Uncut Edition |publisher= [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |page= xiii |isbn=978-0-307-74368-8 }}</ref> As a result, he cut about 400 pages (around 150,000 words) from the original manuscript. This edition reinstates most of the deleted pages (as selected by King), as well as updates the setting from the 1980s to the 1990s.

Additionally, Doubleday published a deluxe edition of ''The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition'', limited to 1,250 numbered copies and 52 lettered copies.

During the 1980s, Stephen King had planned a theatrical film, with [[George A. Romero]] directing and himself writing, not trusting anybody else with the project. However, writing a workable screenplay proved difficult, due to the novel's length. King talked about adapting it for television, but was informed that the television networks did not \"want to see the end of the world, particularly in prime time.\" Eventually King allowed screenwriter [[Rospo Pallenberg]], who was a fan of ''The Stand'', to write his own adaptation of the novel. Pallenberg's script would clock the film in at close to three hours, while still staying true to the novel. Everyone liked the script; however, just as it was about to finally come together, [[Warner Bros.]] backed out of the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060708173256/http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2006 |title=THE RISE AND FALL OF \"THE STAND\" |publisher=subcin.com |author=Hixx, Don Alex |accessdate=2013-04-18 |df=mdy-all }}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] eventually offered Stephen King the chance to make ''The Stand'' into an eight-hour [[television miniseries|miniseries]].

A race track also may feature [[grandstand]]s or concourses. Racetracks are also used in the study of [[animal locomotion]].  Some motorsport tracks are called '''speedways'''.\n\nA '''racetrack''' is a permanent facility or building. '''Racecourse''' is an alternate term for a [[horse racing]] track, found in countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[India]], [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Race tracks built for bicycles are known as '''[[velodrome]]s'''. '''Circuit''' is a common alternate term for racetrack, given the circuit configuration of most race tracks, allowing races to occur over several laps.\n\nA '''race course''', as opposed to a ''racecourse'', is a non-permanent track for sports, particularly [[road running]], [[water sports]], [[road racing]], or [[rallying]]. Many sports usually held on racetracks also can occur on temporary tracks, such as the [[Monaco Grand Prix]] in [[Formula One]].\n\n[[File:Racecourse In Chester3.jpg|thumb|A typical racecourse]]\n\n==History==\nThere is some evidence of racetracks being developed in several ancient civilizations. The most developed ancient racetracks were the [[hippodrome]]s of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and the circuses of the [[Roman Empire]]. Both of these structures were designed for horse and [[chariot]] racing. The stadium of the [[Circus Maximus]] in [[Ancient Rome]] could hold 200,000 spectators.\n\nRacing facilities existed during the [[Middle Ages]], and there are records of a public racecourse being opened at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]] in London in 1174. In 1780 the [[Earl of Derby]] created a horse-racing course on his estate at Epsom; the [[Epsom Derby|English Derby]] continues to be held there today. Racecourses in the [[British Isles]] are based on grass, known as turf tracks. In the United States, the race tracks are dirt.\n\n[[File:1911boardtrackracing.jpg|thumb|right|Motorcycles racing on a highly banked board track in 1911]]\nWith the advent of the automobile in the late nineteenth/early twentieth century, racetracks were designed to suit the nature of powered machines. The earliest tracks were modified horse racing courses. Racing automobiles in such facilities began in September 1896, at Narragansett Park in [[Cranston, Rhode Island]]. The [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] was opened in August 1909.\n\nBeginning in the early 1900s, motorcycle races were run on high, banked, wooden race tracks called [[board track racing|board tracks]]. During the 1920s, many of the races on the [[American Automobile Association|AAA]] Championship circuit were run on such board tracks.\nModern racetracks are designed with spectator safety being paramount, following incidents of spectator and [[track marshal]]s fatalities. These often involve run off areas, barriers, and high fencing.\n\n\nRacing Track (TV Series)\n\nPremiere: Sep 24, 2004\n\nFinale: Dec 14, 2019\n\n\nUPN Seasons 1-2\n\nThe CW Seasons 3-16\n\n\nUPN\n\nSeason One: September 24, 2004 - April 29, 2005 First 26 Episodes\n\nSeason Two: September 18, 2005 - April 23, 2006 Next 26 Episodes\n\n\nThe CW\n\nSeason Three: September 23, 2006 - May 5, 2007 26 Episodes\n\nSeason Four: September 16, 2007 - April 27, 2008 26 Episodes\n\nSeason Five: September 26, 2008 - April 24, 2009 26 Episodes\n\nSeason Six: September 12, 2009 - May 1, 2010 First 25 Episodes\n\nSeason Seven: September 18, 2010 - April 30, 2011 26 Episodes\n\nSeason Eight: September 17, 2011 - April 28, 2012 26 Episodes\n\nSeason Nine: September 15, 2012 - March 23, 2013 22 Episodes\n\nSeason Ten: September 21, 2013 - March 15, 2014 21 Episodes\n\nSeason Eleven: September 27, 2014 - May 2, 2015 26 Episodes\n\nSeason Twelve: October 10, 2015 - May 7, 2016 26 Episodes\n\nSeason Thirteen: October 1, 2016 - May 6, 2017 26 Episodes\n\nSeason Fourteen: October 14, 2017 - May 5, 2018 Final 26 Episodes\n\nSeason Fifteen: October 13, 2018 - May 4, 2019 Last 25 Episodes\n\nSeason Sixteen: October 12, 2019 - December 14, 2019 10 Episodes\n\n==Sports==\n\n[[File:Vbjkhsdfwkueyew0076.JPG|thumb|[[Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace]] Racetrack showing safety fencing]]\n[[File:Ice Racing.jpg|thumb|right|Motorcycle ice racing]]\n[[Image:In Car Micheal Fitzgerald Cork Racing.jpg|thumb|right|View of a race track from a race car at Wakefield Park, Australia]]\nRacetracks are used for:\n\n===Animal sports===\n* [[Camel racing]]\n* [[Greyhound racing]]\n* [[Harness racing]]\n* [[Horse racing]]\n\n===Human sports===\n* [[Bobsleigh]]\n* [[Cycle sport]]\n* [[Skeleton (sport)]]\n* [[Track and field]]\n\n===Motor sports===\n* [[Auto racing]]\n* [[Drag racing]]\n* [[Kart racing]]\n* [[Motorcycle racing]]\n* [[Stock car racing]]\n* [[Track racing]] (motorcycles)\n* [[Truck racing]]\n* [[Drift racing]]\n\n==Configurations==\n[[File:Hongkongjockeyclub.jpg|thumb|Horseracing track, [[Happy Valley Racecourse]] in Hong Kong, showing grandstands]]\n\nSome racetracks offer little in the way of permanent infrastructure other than the track; others incorporate spectator facilities such as grandstands, [[hospitality]] or facilities for competitors, such as pit lanes and garages, paddocks and stables.

A race track also may feature [[grandstand]]s or concourses. Racetracks are also used in the study of [[animal locomotion]].  Some motorsport tracks are called '''speedways'''.\n\nA '''racetrack''' is a permanent facility or building. '''Racecourse''' is an alternate term for a [[horse racing]] track, found in countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[India]], [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Race tracks built for bicycles are known as '''[[velodrome]]s'''. '''Circuit''' is a common alternate term for racetrack, given the circuit configuration of most race tracks, allowing races to occur over several laps.\n\nA '''race course''', as opposed to a ''racecourse'', is a non-permanent track for sports, particularly [[road running]], [[water sports]], [[road racing]], or [[rallying]]. Many sports usually held on racetracks also can occur on temporary tracks, such as the [[Monaco Grand Prix]] in [[Formula One]].\n\n[[File:Racecourse In Chester3.jpg|thumb|A typical racecourse]]\n\n==History==\nThere is some evidence of racetracks being developed in several ancient civilizations. The most developed ancient racetracks were the [[hippodrome]]s of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and the circuses of the [[Roman Empire]]. Both of these structures were designed for horse and [[chariot]] racing. The stadium of the [[Circus Maximus]] in [[Ancient Rome]] could hold 200,000 spectators.\n\nRacing facilities existed during the [[Middle Ages]], and there are records of a public racecourse being opened at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]] in London in 1174. In 1780 the [[Earl of Derby]] created a horse-racing course on his estate at Epsom; the [[Epsom Derby|English Derby]] continues to be held there today. Racecourses in the [[British Isles]] are based on grass, known as turf tracks. In the United States, the race tracks are dirt.\n\n[[File:1911boardtrackracing.jpg|thumb|right|Motorcycles racing on a highly banked board track in 1911]]\nWith the advent of the automobile in the late nineteenth/early twentieth century, racetracks were designed to suit the nature of powered machines. The earliest tracks were modified horse racing courses. Racing automobiles in such facilities began in September 1896, at Narragansett Park in [[Cranston, Rhode Island]]. The [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] was opened in August 1909.\n\nBeginning in the early 1900s, motorcycle races were run on high, banked, wooden race tracks called [[board track racing|board tracks]].
