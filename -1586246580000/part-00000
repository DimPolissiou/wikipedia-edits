It is not an official language.\n\nManglish spoken in [[West Malaysia]] is very similar to and highly mutually intelligible with [[Singlish]], a creole of similar roots. There is little to no distinctions between the two creole except, Manglish contains more Malay vocabularies while Singlish contains more of Hokkien and Teochew varieties.\n\nThe vocabulary of Manglish consists of words originating from [[English language|English]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Min Nan|Hokkien]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and, to a lesser extent, various other European languages, while Manglish syntax resembles southern varieties of Chinese. Also, elements of [[Historical Dictionary of American Slang|American]] and [[Australian slang]] have come through from imported television series.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=JgY1CJTKH6gC&pg=PA116 Lingua et Linguistica 1.1]</ref>\n\nThe Malaysian Manglish is sometimes known as Rojak or [[Bahasa Rojak]], but it differs from the Rojak language by the use of English as the base language. The East Coast versions (Kelantan and Terengganu) of Manglish may differ greatly from that of West Coast Malaysian speakers.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}\n\nThe term ''Manglish'' is first recorded in 1989. Other colloquial [[portmanteau word]]s for Manglish include (chronologically): ''Malish'' (1992), ''Malaylish'' (1992), ''Malenglish'' (1994), ''Malglish'' (1997), ''Malayglish'' (2005), and ''Malanglish'' (2013).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lambert |first=James |date=2018 |title=A multitude of \u201clishes\u201d: The nomenclature of hybridity |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191120074523/https://benjamins.com/catalog/eww.00001.lam/fulltext/eww.00001.lam.pdf |journal=English World-Wide |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=28 |doi=10.1075/eww.00001.lam}}</ref>\n\nManglish shares substantial linguistic similarities with [[Singlish]] in [[Singapore]], although distinctions can be made, particularly in vocabulary.\n\nInitially, \"Singlish\" and \"Manglish\" were essentially the same language, when both Singapore and the states now comprising Peninsular Malaysia were under various forms of direct and indirect British colonial rule, though not forming a single administrative unit except between 1963 and 1965. (See [[British Malaya|Malaya]].) In old British Malaya, English was the language of the British administration whilst Malay was the lingua franca of the street. Even ethnic Chinese would speak Malay when addressing other Chinese people who did not speak the same Chinese dialect.\n\nEnglish as spoken in Malaysia is based on [[British English]] and called [[Malaysian English]]. British spelling is generally followed. However, the influence of [[American English]] modes of expression and slang is strong, particularly among Malaysian youth.\n\nSince 1968, [[Malay language|Malay]] has been the country's sole official language. While English is widely used, many Malay words have become part of common usage in informal English or Manglish. An example is suffixing sentences with ''lah'', as in, \"Don't be so worried-lah\", which is usually used to present a sentence as rather light-going and not so serious; the suffix has no specific meaning. However, Chinese dialects also make abundant use of the suffix ''lah'' and there is some disagreement as to which language it was originally borrowed from. There is also a strong influence from Malay, [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]], [[Hokkien dialect|Hokkien]], and [[Tamil language|Tamil]], which are other major dialects and languages spoken in Malaysia. Manglish also uses some archaic British terms from the era of British colonisation (see \"gostan\" and \"outstation\" below).\n\n==Malaysian English and Manglish==\n\nIn Malaysia, Manglish is considered to be a less formal form of [[Malaysian English]] which has features of a [[pidgin]] or a [[Creole language|creole]], rather than a fully-fledged creole language.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=juAzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13 |title=English in Malaysia: Current Use and Status |date=2016 |publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004314306 |editor-last=Yamaguchi |editor-first=Toshiko |page=13 |editor-last2=Deterding |editor-first2=David}}</ref><ref name=\"star\"/> While all varieties of English used by Malaysians may be considered Malaysian English,<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngPPJtDJ3gwC&pg=PT70&lpg=PT70#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=English in Southeast Asia: Features, Policy and Language in Use |date=2012 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |isbn=978-9027249029 |editor-last=Low |editor-first=Ee-Ling |page=56 |editor-last2=Azirah Hashim}}</ref> some make a distinction between Malaysian English and Manglish; Malaysian English being a form of English that largely follows the standard rules of English grammar but with some local characteristics, while Manglish is a pidgin that does not follow the grammatical rules or structure of English.<ref name=\"star\"/> Many Malaysians however tend to refer to the colloquialisms used by those taught in English-medium school as Malaysian English,<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t2yNAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA32 |title=The Routledge Concise History of Southeast Asian Writing in English |last=Patke |first=Rajeev Shridhar |last2=Holden |first2=Philip |publisher=Routledge |page=32}}</ref> while some argued for the basilect form or pidgin as the \"real\" Malaysian English.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/viewpoints/mind-our-english/2013/10/08/just-dont-call-it-manglish/ |title=Just don't call it Manglish! |author=Alistair King |work=The Star |date=8 October 2013}}</ref> At the lexical level, limited [[Lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] is used and consequently, a number of words serve a variety of functions, giving extended meanings not normally accepted in standard British English.\n\nThere are some differences of contemporary words used between Malaysia and the United Kingdom. The use of Manglish is discouraged at schools, where only Malaysian Standard English is taught.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wOTcr9mrtEUC&pg=PA389&dq=manglish&hl=en&sa=X&ei=C7L9TpjYGYSyrAeLzcT9Dw&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=manglish&f=false |title=The Handbook of Business Discourse |date=2009 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press  |editor-last=Bargiela-Chiappini |editor-first=Francesca |location=Edinburgh}}</ref>\n\nThe term Malaysian English is not used in any official context except for the ever-changing school curriculum modules in attempts to improve the command of English but without going into advanced lessons. Call it English 112, English for Primary Students, Malaysian English, Conversational English etc. but \"Malaysian English\" is not an official dialect of English.{{According to whom|date=September 2018}} \n\nIt is however, possible to speak Manglish without substituting English words with those from another language.\n\n==Influences from other languages==\nSpeakers of Manglish from the country's different ethnic groups tend to intersperse varying amounts of expressions or interjections from their mother tongue \u2013 be it [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or one of the  [[Languages of India|Indian]] languages \u2013 which, in some cases, qualifies as a form of [[code-switching]]. <ref>Vollmann, R., & Soon, T. W. (2019). The sociolinguistic status of Malaysian English. Grazer Linguistische Studien.</ref>\n\nVerbs or adjectives from other languages often have English [[affix]]es, and conversely sentences may be constructed using English words in another language's syntax. People tend to translate phrases directly from their first languages into English, for instance, \"on the light\" instead of \"''turn'' on the light\". Or sometimes, \"open the light\", translated directly from Chinese.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n===Cantonese Influences in Manglish===\n\nCantonese influences is one of the more distinctive features of Manglish that sets it apart from Singlish, which has more influence from Hokkien. In spoken Manglish, Chinese speakers tend to incorporate Cantonese words in their speech.\n\n===Use of the word \u2018mou\u2019 (\u5187) to as a question marker===\nIn Cantonese, the word \u2018mou\u2019 translates to \u201cdon\u2019t have\u201d. For instance, \u2018mou fan\u2019 would translate directly to \u201cdon\u2019t have rice\u201d (\u5187\u98ef). Note that in Malaysian Cantonese, \u2018mou\u2019 is typically used at the end of sentences.\nIn actual Manglish speech, it could be used in the following context:\n*\u2018Vincent coming mou?\u2019 (is Vincent coming?)\n\n===Use of the number 7===\nIn Cantonese, the number 7 (\u4e03), pronounced \u2018cat1\u2019, is homonymous to the words \ud863\udccd and \u67d2, which are profanities that refer to a limp penis and is often used to denote something dumb or stupid.\n*\u201cWhat 7 you say?\u201d (what stupid thing are you saying?)\n*\u201cWeather so 7 hot\u201d (the weather is stupidly hot)\n\n===Use of the number 9===\nIn Cantonese, the number 9 (\u4e5d), pronounced \u2018gau2\u2019, is homonymous to \u9ce9 (dick) but with a slight difference in tone. It is used to refer to a \u2018dumbass\u2019 or to describe something as \u2018dumb\u2019. In actual Manglish speech, the use of the number 9 is not confined to the above-mentioned meanings, but can be used loosely to denote profane or vulgar thoughts, similar to English\u2019s use of the word \u2018fuck\u2019. The use of \u20189\u2019 typically follows a verb and functions as an intensifier. \n\n*\u201cBeat 9 him!\u201d (beat the fuck out of him!)\n*\u201cYou scared 9 me!\u201d (you scared the shit out of me!)\n*\u201cSlap 9 your mouth!\u201d (slap the shit out of your mouth!)\n\n==Words and grammar==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Nouns===\n*\"outstation\" \u2013 out of town (e.g. going ''outstation''), from the colonial era when British officials went to hill stations to escape the heat.<ref name=hall7 />\n*\"terrer\" \u2013 (pronounced as the English \"terror\") Refers to someone or something being awesomely amazing or good (e.g. \"Bloody hell, that guy is ''terrer!''\").\n*\"chop\" \u2013 stamp (also used as verb).

E.g. \"That salegirl was very la-la\"/\"The clothes are so la-la.\" These days, the term is also used to describe guys who sports outstanding/bizarre hairstyle and wear outstanding clothes and accessories resulting in bad taste as well. \"la-la zai\" and \"la-la mui\" is commonly used to make distinctions between the genders, with the former referring to guys and the latter referring to girls.

This is because originally in Malay, 'lah' is appended to the end of the word and is not a separate word by itself.\n\nIn Malay, 'lah' is used to change a verb into a command or to soften its tone, particularly when usage of the verb may seem impolite. For example, \"to drink\" is \"minum\", but \"Here, drink!\" is \"minumlah\". Similarly, 'lah' is frequently used with imperatives in Singlish, such as the command, \"Drink lah!\" (Come on, drink!).<ref name=\"star\">{{cite news |last=Lim |first=Chin Lam |title=Primer on Manglish |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Lifestyle/Viewpoints/Mind-Our-English/Profile/Articles/2011/10/14/Primer-on-Manglish/ |accessdate=5 January 2015 |publisher=The Star |date=14 October 2011}}</ref> 'Lah' also occurs frequently with \"Yah\" and \"No\" (hence \"Yah lah\" and \"No lah\"), resulting in a less brusque sound, thus facilitating the flow of conversation. This form is more used by Chinese in Malaysia.\n\nIt is also possible that Lah comes from Cantonese. In Cantonese, Lah ([[:wikt:\u5566|\u5566]]) is placed at the end of a sentence in imperatives making it sound more like a request than an order.\n\nIt might have Tamil origin as well. Lah is still used widely in Southern Tamil Nadu (Thirunelveli, Kanyakumari district) in the same manner. Tamil is said to be more pure in this region than northern Tamil Nadu and had ancient trade link with south east Asia.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.asiaoceania.org/pdf/BG/57-OBG-M220.pdf |title=Maritime Contacts on the Coromandal Coast |last=S.

(Brusque response to, \"Lend me some money, can?\")\n*Don't know already lah! (Brusque response to someone fumbling with an explanation. Mostly by Chinese.)\n\nLah is also used for reassurance:\n*Don't worry, he can do it one lah \u2013 Don't worry, he can get it done.\n*It's okay lah \u2013 It's all right.\n\nLah can also be used to emphasize items in a spoken list, appearing after each item in the list but is not commonly used in this context. \n*They got sell Nasi Lemak lah, Roti Canai lah, Chapatti lah; Everything got lah!\n\nAlthough lah can appear nearly anywhere, it cannot appear with a [[yes-no question]]. Another particle should be used instead. For example:\n*Where are you ar? (This is especially of Chinese origin.)<ref name=\"star\" />\n\nThe Chinese influence in Manglish, however, can be seen among other races in Malaysia, especially when conversing with Chinese-speaking people. This principle can be generally applied to all forms of non-standard English spoken in Malaysia.\n\n==\"Loh\"==\n'Loh' or 'lo' (\u56c9) is used in the same context as \"lah\". It serves as a final particle to intensify a decision that is definitive and irrevocable.\n\nIn most cases, loh is used in direct response to a question or query with the connotation that the respondent is somewhat impatient or annoying because the person thinks that the answer is so obvious that the question should not have been raised from the start. In fact, the questioner might have no idea beforehand about the rude reply that would be shot back to him/her, though it can be argued that the word 'lah' might deliver stronger emotions from the speaker.\n\nFor example, to show argumentative mood or making emphasis, one would say, \"You lo (it's your fault), if it's not for you we wouldn't be in trouble now!\" and possibly in response, the other would say, \"Eh, I never forced you to follow me here loh!\" Another example is \"traffic jam loh!\" when asked by a friend why he or she is late to an occasion. \n\nSometimes, loh is used to express insincerity while speaking, for instance when one says \"sorry loh\" or \"thank you loh\".\n\nHowever, in some cases, the use of loh is only intended to give an advice without any notion of impatience. Examples: \"I think he\u2019s being unreasonable loh\" or \"if you ask you will know loh\".\n\nIn lesser cases, using \"loh\" can make some emphasis or convey a jovial atmosphere. For example, \"I came all the way for you loh\" and \"Nah, that one loh, that fat chubby one in a yellow shirt loh\". \n\n\"Loh\" is mostly used by the Chinese community in Malaysia, because of its Cantonese origin.\n\n==Meh==\n\n\"Meh\" is commonly used at the end of a question. It is usually used with a sense of confidence in his or her own statement but the hint of doubt towards the other person. For example,\" I like her, can not meh?\" (meaning \"I like her. What's wrong with that?\").\n\n\"Meh\" is of Cantonese origin (\u54a9). In Cantonese or Hakka, \"meh\" is a final particle that transforms statements into questions that indicate doubt or surprise.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk/dictionary/characters/563/ |title=\u54a9 |website=CantoDict}}</ref>\n\n==What==\nThe particle what {{IPA-endia|w\u0251\u0300t|}}, also spelled wat/wot, is used to remind or contradict the listener, especially when strengthening another assertion that follows from the current one:\n\n==Phonetic Features of Spoken Manglish==\n\nManglish has its unique set of features when spoken by native Malaysians that are distinct from the standard variety of English. Though very similar to spoken Singlish, the two should not be considered the same variety. <ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngPPJtDJ3gwC&pg=PT70&lpg=PT70#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=English in Southeast Asia: Features, Policy and Language in Use |date=2012 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |isbn=978-9027249029 |editor-last=Low |editor-first=Ee-Ling |page=56 |editor-last2=Azirah Hashim}}</ref>\n \n'''Manglish is non-rhotic'''\n*Sometimes referred to as r-fullness/r-lessness, spoken Manglish is similar to the standard variety of English in Singapore and Britain, in that the final /r/ consonant is dropped during speech. Words such as 'water' and 'player' are transcribed as /w\u0252t\u0259/ and /plej\u0259/ respectively.\n\n'''There is no distinction between long and short vowels'''\n*In Manglish, long vowels such as /\u0251\u02d0/ and /\u025c\u02d0/ are usually pronounced no differently from /\u028c/ and /\u0259/ respectively. For instance, 'father' is pronounced as /f\u028cd\u0259/ instead of /f\u0251\u02d0\u00f0\u0259/.\n\n'''Diphthongs are reduced to monophthongs'''\n*Diphthongs such as /e\u026a/ are usually reduced to /e/ in words such as 'later'. So instead of /le\u026at\u0259/, Manglish speakers tend to say /let\u0259/ instead.\n\n'''Dental fricatives /\u00f0/ and /\u03b8/ are pronounced as dental plosives instead.'''\n*Dental fricatives are often not enunciated in Manglish the way it is in standard varieties of English. Instead, they are pronounced as plosives. Hence, words like 'this' /\u00f0\u026as/ is pronounced as 'dis' /d\u026as/ (voiced), and 'thing' /\u03b8\u026a\u014b/ is pronounced as /t\u026a\u014b/ (voiceless).\n\n'''Omission of final consonants'''\n*Final consonants of words are often left out in spoken Manglish. Some examples include 'dun' (don't), 'fac' (fact), 'adap' (adapt).\n\n'''Absence of lip rounding in diphthongs ending in /\u028a/'''\n*/\u0259\u028a/ and /o\u028a/ diphthongs, where there is a lip rounding at the end, is often pronounced without the lip rounding in Manglish. For instance, 'so' and 'go' are pronounced as /so/ and /go/ instead of /so\u028a/ and /go\u028a/.\n\n==Miscellaneous==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}\n\"There is\"/\"there are\" and \"has\"/\"have\" are both expressed using got, so that sentences can be translated in either way back into British / American English. This is equivalent to the Chinese \u6709 y\u01d2u (to have):\n*''Got question?'' \u2013 Is there a question? / Do you have a question?\n*''Yesterday ar, East Coast Park got so many people!'' \u2013 There were so many people at East Coast Park yesterday. / East Coast Park had so many people [there] yesterday.\n*''This bus got air-con or not?'' \u2013 Is there air-conditioning on this bus? / Does this bus have air-conditioning?\n*''Where got!?'' \u2013 lit. Where is there [this]?, also more loosely, What are you talking about? or Where did you get that idea?; generic response to any accusation. Derived from Malay sentence \"Mana ada\" \u2013 'Mana' (Where) 'ada' (got) and also from Chinese sentence \"\u54ea\u91cc\u6709\" \u2013 '\u54ea\u91cc' (Where) '\u6709' (got).\n\nCan is used extensively as both a question particle and an answer particle. The negative is cannot:\n*''Gimme lah, ok or not?'' \u2013 (Give it to me, OK?)\n*''Can!'' \u2013 (Sure!)\n*''Can!'' \u2013 (Yes, that is possible)\n*''Cannot.'' \u2013 (No way.)\n\n==Comparisons with Singlish==\nManglish and Singlish share a common history and some common characteristics. The difference between Manglish and [[Singlish]] can be subtle and sometimes difficult to be distinguish even among the locals. However, Manglish is markedly more influenced by the Malay language, with the majority population in [[Malaysia]] being the [[Ethnic Malays]]; while Singlish is more influenced by [[Hokkien dialect]] or [[Mandarin Chinese]], with the majority population being the [[Han Chinese|Ethnic Chinese]]. For example, \"kena\" (a Malay word, somewhat of a prefix added for the sake of turning an action verb into passive form) might be more often used in Manglish; while Singlish more frequently uses words like \"liao\" (meaning \"already\" in Hokkien), \"nia\" (meaning \"only\" in Hokkien). However, referring the aforementioned example, \"kena\" is also used in Singlish and \"liao\" in Mangish, only to a less extent. This shows the huge influences on these two languages on each other as well. There is virtually no difference between the two when heard from foreigner's ears.\n\n==Other usage==\n{{Globalize|date=June 2013}}\n*The word 'Manglish' is also used to describe the English spoken by [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] speakers from the [[Kerala]] state in [[India]] having a Malayalam accent, mainly by those who have studied in Malayalam-medium schools. This is also propagated by Malayalam media.\n*Manglish ([[manga]] in English) is also the name of an interactive cartoon feature in the ''[[Mainichi Daily News]]'', Japan's major English-language online newspaper. Manga, or Japanese comics, are displayed on the Web site in their original format, but English translations of the Japanese characters can be seen by mousing over the [[speech balloons]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Malaysia|Languages}}\n* [[British and Malaysian English differences]]\n* [[Malaysian English]]\n* [[Singlish]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071119134648/http://www.whatthefreek.com/manglish/ Manglish: For and Against], Should Malaysians speak Manglish or proper English?\n* [[Benjamin Zimmer|Zimmer, Benjamin]] (2006-10-05), \"[http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003643.html Malaysia Cracks Down on 'Salad Language']\".

It is not an official language.\n\nManglish spoken in [[West Malaysia]] is very similar to and highly mutually intelligible with [[Singlish]], a creole of similar roots. There is little to no distinctions between the two creole except, Manglish contains more Malay vocabularies while Singlish contains more of Hokkien and Teochew varieties.\n\nThe vocabulary of Manglish consists of words originating from [[English language|English]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Min Nan|Hokkien]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and, to a lesser extent, various other European languages, while Manglish syntax resembles southern varieties of Chinese. Also, elements of [[Historical Dictionary of American Slang|American]] and [[Australian slang]] have come through from imported television series.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=JgY1CJTKH6gC&pg=PA116 Lingua et Linguistica 1.1]</ref>\n\nThe Malaysian Manglish is sometimes known as Rojak or [[Bahasa Rojak]], but it differs from the Rojak language by the use of English as the base language. The East Coast versions (Kelantan and Terengganu) of Manglish may differ greatly from that of West Coast Malaysian speakers.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}\n\nThe term ''Manglish'' is first recorded in 1989. Other colloquial [[portmanteau word]]s for Manglish include (chronologically): ''Malish'' (1992), ''Malaylish'' (1992), ''Malenglish'' (1994), ''Malglish'' (1997), ''Malayglish'' (2005), and ''Malanglish'' (2013).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lambert |first=James |date=2018 |title=A multitude of \u201clishes\u201d: The nomenclature of hybridity |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191120074523/https://benjamins.com/catalog/eww.00001.lam/fulltext/eww.00001.lam.pdf |journal=English World-Wide |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=28 |doi=10.1075/eww.00001.lam}}</ref>\n\nManglish shares substantial linguistic similarities with [[Singlish]] in [[Singapore]], although distinctions can be made, particularly in vocabulary.\n\nInitially, \"Singlish\" and \"Manglish\" were essentially the same language, when both Singapore and the states now comprising Peninsular Malaysia were under various forms of direct and indirect British colonial rule, though not forming a single administrative unit except between 1963 and 1965. (See [[British Malaya|Malaya]].) In old British Malaya, English was the language of the British administration whilst Malay was the lingua franca of the street. Even ethnic Chinese would speak Malay when addressing other Chinese people who did not speak the same Chinese dialect.\n\nEnglish as spoken in Malaysia is based on [[British English]] and called [[Malaysian English]]. British spelling is generally followed. However, the influence of [[American English]] modes of expression and slang is strong, particularly among Malaysian youth.\n\nSince 1968, [[Malay language|Malay]] has been the country's sole official language. While English is widely used, many Malay words have become part of common usage in informal English or Manglish. An example is suffixing sentences with ''lah'', as in, \"Don't be so worried-lah\", which is usually used to present a sentence as rather light-going and not so serious; the suffix has no specific meaning. However, Chinese dialects also make abundant use of the suffix ''lah'' and there is some disagreement as to which language it was originally borrowed from. There is also a strong influence from Malay, [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]], [[Hokkien dialect|Hokkien]], and [[Tamil language|Tamil]], which are other major dialects and languages spoken in Malaysia. Manglish also uses some archaic British terms from the era of British colonisation (see \"gostan\" and \"outstation\" below).\n\n==Malaysian English and Manglish==\n\nIn Malaysia, Manglish is considered to be a less formal form of [[Malaysian English]] which has features of a [[pidgin]] or a [[Creole language|creole]], rather than a fully-fledged creole language.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=juAzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13 |title=English in Malaysia: Current Use and Status |date=2016 |publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004314306 |editor-last=Yamaguchi |editor-first=Toshiko |page=13 |editor-last2=Deterding |editor-first2=David}}</ref><ref name=\"star\"/> While all varieties of English used by Malaysians may be considered Malaysian English,<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngPPJtDJ3gwC&pg=PT70&lpg=PT70#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=English in Southeast Asia: Features, Policy and Language in Use |date=2012 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |isbn=978-9027249029 |editor-last=Low |editor-first=Ee-Ling |page=56 |editor-last2=Azirah Hashim}}</ref> some make a distinction between Malaysian English and Manglish; Malaysian English being a form of English that largely follows the standard rules of English grammar but with some local characteristics, while Manglish is a pidgin that does not follow the grammatical rules or structure of English.<ref name=\"star\"/> Many Malaysians however tend to refer to the colloquialisms used by those taught in English-medium school as Malaysian English,<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t2yNAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA32 |title=The Routledge Concise History of Southeast Asian Writing in English |last=Patke |first=Rajeev Shridhar |last2=Holden |first2=Philip |publisher=Routledge |page=32}}</ref> while some argued for the basilect form or pidgin as the \"real\" Malaysian English.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/viewpoints/mind-our-english/2013/10/08/just-dont-call-it-manglish/ |title=Just don't call it Manglish! |author=Alistair King |work=The Star |date=8 October 2013}}</ref> At the lexical level, limited [[Lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] is used and consequently, a number of words serve a variety of functions, giving extended meanings not normally accepted in standard British English.\n\nThere are some differences of contemporary words used between Malaysia and the United Kingdom.

Call it English 112, English for Primary Students, Malaysian English, Conversational English etc. but \"Malaysian English\" is not an official dialect of English.{{According to whom|date=September 2018}} \n\nIt is however, possible to speak Manglish without substituting English words with those from another language.\n\n==Influences from other languages==\nSpeakers of Manglish from the country's different ethnic groups tend to intersperse varying amounts of expressions or interjections from their mother tongue \u2013 be it [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or one of the  [[Languages of India|Indian]] languages \u2013 which, in some cases, qualifies as a form of [[code-switching]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nVerbs or adjectives from other languages often have English [[affix]]es, and conversely sentences may be constructed using English words in another language's syntax. People tend to translate phrases directly from their first languages into English, for instance, \"on the light\" instead of \"''turn'' on the light\". Or sometimes, \"open the light\", translated directly from Chinese.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n===Cantonese Influences in Manglish===\n\nCantonese influences is one of the more distinctive features of Manglish that sets it apart from Singlish, which has more influence from Hokkien. In spoken Manglish, Chinese speakers tend to incorporate Cantonese words in their speech.\n\n===Use of the word \u2018mou\u2019 (\u5187) to as a question marker===\nIn Cantonese, the word \u2018mou\u2019 translates to \u201cdon\u2019t have\u201d. For instance, \u2018mou fan\u2019 would translate directly to \u201cdon\u2019t have rice\u201d (\u5187\u98ef). Note that in Malaysian Cantonese, \u2018mou\u2019 is typically used at the end of sentences.\nIn actual Manglish speech, it could be used in the following context:\n*\u2018Vincent coming mou?\u2019 (is Vincent coming?)\n\n===Use of the number 7===\nIn Cantonese, the number 7 (\u4e03), pronounced \u2018cat1\u2019, is homonymous to the words \ud863\udccd and \u67d2, which are profanities that refer to a limp penis and is often used to denote something dumb or stupid.\n*\u201cWhat 7 you say?\u201d (what stupid thing are you saying?)\n*\u201cWeather so 7 hot\u201d (the weather is stupidly hot)\n\n===Use of the number 9===\nIn Cantonese, the number 9 (\u4e5d), pronounced \u2018gau2\u2019, is homonymous to \u9ce9 (dick) but with a slight difference in tone. It is used to refer to a \u2018dumbass\u2019 or to describe something as \u2018dumb\u2019. In actual Manglish speech, the use of the number 9 is not confined to the above-mentioned meanings, but can be used loosely to denote profane or vulgar thoughts, similar to English\u2019s use of the word \u2018fuck\u2019. The use of \u20189\u2019 typically follows a verb and functions as an intensifier. \n\n*\u201cBeat 9 him!\u201d (beat the fuck out of him!)\n*\u201cYou scared 9 me!\u201d (you scared the shit out of me!)\n*\u201cSlap 9 your mouth!\u201d (slap the shit out of your mouth!)\n\n==Words and grammar==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Nouns===\n*\"outstation\" \u2013 out of town (e.g. going ''outstation''), from the colonial era when British officials went to hill stations to escape the heat.<ref name=hall7 />\n*\"terrer\" \u2013 (pronounced as the English \"terror\") Refers to someone or something being awesomely amazing or good (e.g. \"Bloody hell, that guy is ''terrer!''\").\n*\"chop\" \u2013 stamp (also used as verb).

This is because originally in Malay, 'lah' is appended to the end of the word and is not a separate word by itself.\n\nIn Malay, 'lah' is used to change a verb into a command or to soften its tone, particularly when usage of the verb may seem impolite. For example, \"to drink\" is \"minum\", but \"Here, drink!\" is \"minumlah\". Similarly, 'lah' is frequently used with imperatives in Singlish, such as the command, \"Drink lah!\" (Come on, drink!).<ref name=\"star\">{{cite news |last=Lim |first=Chin Lam |title=Primer on Manglish |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Lifestyle/Viewpoints/Mind-Our-English/Profile/Articles/2011/10/14/Primer-on-Manglish/ |accessdate=5 January 2015 |publisher=The Star |date=14 October 2011}}</ref> 'Lah' also occurs frequently with \"Yah\" and \"No\" (hence \"Yah lah\" and \"No lah\"), resulting in a less brusque sound, thus facilitating the flow of conversation. This form is more used by Chinese in Malaysia.\n\nIt is also possible that Lah comes from Cantonese. In Cantonese, Lah ([[:wikt:\u5566|\u5566]]) is placed at the end of a sentence in imperatives making it sound more like a request than an order.\n\nIt might have Tamil origin as well. Lah is still used widely in Southern Tamil Nadu (Thirunelveli, Kanyakumari district) in the same manner. Tamil is said to be more pure in this region than northern Tamil Nadu and had ancient trade link with south east Asia.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.asiaoceania.org/pdf/BG/57-OBG-M220.pdf |title=Maritime Contacts on the Coromandal Coast |last=S.

(Brusque response to, \"Lend me some money, can?\")\n*Don't know already lah! (Brusque response to someone fumbling with an explanation. Mostly by Chinese.)\n\nLah is also used for reassurance:\n*Don't worry, he can do it one lah \u2013 Don't worry, he can get it done.\n*It's okay lah \u2013 It's all right.\n\nLah can also be used to emphasize items in a spoken list, appearing after each item in the list but is not commonly used in this context. \n*They got sell Nasi Lemak lah, Roti Canai lah, Chapatti lah; Everything got lah!\n\nAlthough lah can appear nearly anywhere, it cannot appear with a [[yes-no question]]. Another particle should be used instead. For example:\n*Where are you ar? (This is especially of Chinese origin.)<ref name=\"star\" />\n\nThe Chinese influence in Manglish, however, can be seen among other races in Malaysia, especially when conversing with Chinese-speaking people. This principle can be generally applied to all forms of non-standard English spoken in Malaysia.\n\n==\"Loh\"==\n'Loh' or 'lo' (\u56c9) is used in the same context as \"lah\". It serves as a final particle to intensify a decision that is definitive and irrevocable.\n\nIn most cases, loh is used in direct response to a question or query with the connotation that the respondent is somewhat impatient or annoying because the person thinks that the answer is so obvious that the question should not have been raised from the start. In fact, the questioner might have no idea beforehand about the rude reply that would be shot back to him/her, though it can be argued that the word 'lah' might deliver stronger emotions from the speaker.\n\nFor example, to show argumentative mood or making emphasis, one would say, \"You lo (it's your fault), if it's not for you we wouldn't be in trouble now!\" and possibly in response, the other would say, \"Eh, I never forced you to follow me here loh!\" Another example is \"traffic jam loh!\" when asked by a friend why he or she is late to an occasion. \n\nSometimes, loh is used to express insincerity while speaking, for instance when one says \"sorry loh\" or \"thank you loh\".\n\nHowever, in some cases, the use of loh is only intended to give an advice without any notion of impatience. Examples: \"I think he\u2019s being unreasonable loh\" or \"if you ask you will know loh\".\n\nIn lesser cases, using \"loh\" can make some emphasis or convey a jovial atmosphere. For example, \"I came all the way for you loh\" and \"Nah, that one loh, that fat chubby one in a yellow shirt loh\". \n\n\"Loh\" is mostly used by the Chinese community in Malaysia, because of its Cantonese origin.\n\n==Meh==\n\n\"Meh\" is commonly used at the end of a question. It is usually used with a sense of confidence in his or her own statement but the hint of doubt towards the other person. For example,\" I like her, can not meh?\" (meaning \"I like her. What's wrong with that?\").\n\n\"Meh\" is of Cantonese origin (\u54a9). In Cantonese or Hakka, \"meh\" is a final particle that transforms statements into questions that indicate doubt or surprise.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk/dictionary/characters/563/ |title=\u54a9 |website=CantoDict}}</ref>\n\n==What==\nThe particle what {{IPA-endia|w\u0251\u0300t|}}, also spelled wat/wot, is used to remind or contradict the listener, especially when strengthening another assertion that follows from the current one:\n\n==Phonetic Features of Spoken Manglish==\n\nManglish has its unique set of features when spoken by native Malaysians that are distinct from the standard variety of English. Though very similar to spoken Singlish, the two should not be considered the same variety. <ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngPPJtDJ3gwC&pg=PT70&lpg=PT70#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=English in Southeast Asia: Features, Policy and Language in Use |date=2012 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |isbn=978-9027249029 |editor-last=Low |editor-first=Ee-Ling |page=56 |editor-last2=Azirah Hashim}}</ref>\n \n'''Manglish is non-rhotic'''\n*Sometimes referred to as r-fullness/r-lessness, spoken Manglish is similar to the standard variety of English in Singapore and Britain, in that the final /r/ consonant is dropped during speech. Words such as 'water' and 'player' are transcribed as /w\u0252t\u0259/ and /plej\u0259/ respectively.\n\n'''There is no distinction between long and short vowels'''\n*In Manglish, long vowels such as /\u0251\u02d0/ and /\u025c\u02d0/ are usually pronounced no differently from /\u028c/ and /\u0259/ respectively. For instance, 'father' is pronounced as /f\u028cd\u0259/ instead of /f\u0251\u02d0\u00f0\u0259/.\n\n'''Diphthongs are reduced to monophthongs'''\n*Diphthongs such as /e\u026a/ are usually reduced to /e/ in words such as 'later'. So instead of /le\u026at\u0259/, Manglish speakers tend to say /let\u0259/ instead.\n\n'''Dental fricatives /\u00f0/ and /\u03b8/ are pronounced as dental plosives instead.'''\n*Dental fricatives are often not enunciated in Manglish the way it is in standard varieties of English. Instead, they are pronounced as plosives. Hence, words like 'this' /\u00f0\u026as/ is pronounced as 'dis' /d\u026as/ (voiced), and 'thing' /\u03b8\u026a\u014b/ is pronounced as /t\u026a\u014b/ (voiceless).\n\n'''Omission of final consonants'''\n*Final consonants of words are often left out in spoken Manglish. Some examples include 'dun' (don't), 'fac' (fact), 'adap' (adapt).\n\n'''Absence of lip rounding in diphthongs ending in /\u028a/'''\n*/\u0259\u028a/ and /o\u028a/ diphthongs, where there is a lip rounding at the end, is often pronounced without the lip rounding in Manglish. For instance, 'so' and 'go' are pronounced as /so/ and /go/ instead of /so\u028a/ and /go\u028a/.\n\n==Miscellaneous==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}\n\"There is\"/\"there are\" and \"has\"/\"have\" are both expressed using got, so that sentences can be translated in either way back into British / American English. This is equivalent to the Chinese \u6709 y\u01d2u (to have):\n*''Got question?'' \u2013 Is there a question? / Do you have a question?\n*''Yesterday ar, East Coast Park got so many people!'' \u2013 There were so many people at East Coast Park yesterday. / East Coast Park had so many people [there] yesterday.\n*''This bus got air-con or not?'' \u2013 Is there air-conditioning on this bus? / Does this bus have air-conditioning?\n*''Where got!?'' \u2013 lit. Where is there [this]?, also more loosely, What are you talking about? or Where did you get that idea?; generic response to any accusation. Derived from Malay sentence \"Mana ada\" \u2013 'Mana' (Where) 'ada' (got) and also from Chinese sentence \"\u54ea\u91cc\u6709\" \u2013 '\u54ea\u91cc' (Where) '\u6709' (got).\n\nCan is used extensively as both a question particle and an answer particle. The negative is cannot:\n*''Gimme lah, ok or not?'' \u2013 (Give it to me, OK?)\n*''Can!'' \u2013 (Sure!)\n*''Can!'' \u2013 (Yes, that is possible)\n*''Cannot.'' \u2013 (No way.)\n\n==Comparisons with Singlish==\nManglish and Singlish share a common history and some common characteristics. The difference between Manglish and [[Singlish]] can be subtle and sometimes difficult to be distinguish even among the locals. However, Manglish is markedly more influenced by the Malay language, with the majority population in [[Malaysia]] being the [[Ethnic Malays]]; while Singlish is more influenced by [[Hokkien dialect]] or [[Mandarin Chinese]], with the majority population being the [[Han Chinese|Ethnic Chinese]]. For example, \"kena\" (a Malay word, somewhat of a prefix added for the sake of turning an action verb into passive form) might be more often used in Manglish; while Singlish more frequently uses words like \"liao\" (meaning \"already\" in Hokkien), \"nia\" (meaning \"only\" in Hokkien). However, referring the aforementioned example, \"kena\" is also used in Singlish and \"liao\" in Mangish, only to a less extent. This shows the huge influences on these two languages on each other as well. There is virtually no difference between the two when heard from foreigner's ears.\n\n==Other usage==\n{{Globalize|date=June 2013}}\n*The word 'Manglish' is also used to describe the English spoken by [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] speakers from the [[Kerala]] state in [[India]] having a Malayalam accent, mainly by those who have studied in Malayalam-medium schools. This is also propagated by Malayalam media.\n*Manglish ([[manga]] in English) is also the name of an interactive cartoon feature in the ''[[Mainichi Daily News]]'', Japan's major English-language online newspaper. Manga, or Japanese comics, are displayed on the Web site in their original format, but English translations of the Japanese characters can be seen by mousing over the [[speech balloons]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Malaysia|Languages}}\n* [[British and Malaysian English differences]]\n* [[Malaysian English]]\n* [[Singlish]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071119134648/http://www.whatthefreek.com/manglish/ Manglish: For and Against], Should Malaysians speak Manglish or proper English?\n* [[Benjamin Zimmer|Zimmer, Benjamin]] (2006-10-05), \"[http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003643.html Malaysia Cracks Down on 'Salad Language']\".

The beak and bare skin patch around the eyes are bright yellow, and the iris is brown. Legs are also yellow, though shade and brightness varies.

Wings are dark grey with varying levels of yellow highlighting. The ventral feathering is light grey to white with light grey scalloping on the chest. The feathering surrounding the eye is black. The beak and bare skin patch around the eyes are bright yellow, and the iris is brown. Legs are also yellow, though shade and brightness varies. Fledgling birds have undefined, fluffy light grey chests without scalloping. Immature birds can be identified in the hand by retained juvenile remiges and rectrices, which are more brownish.<ref name=\"BirdInTheHand\" /> Yellow-throated miners are distinctive from the other miners by their clean white rump, instead of the continuous grey from the back that the noisy and black-eared miners have. The white-rump is clearly visible as yellow-throated miners are flying away, so this feature is often used in the field where two miner species overlap.  Yellow-throated miners have a varying amount of yellow highlighting above and below the beak on the forehead and chin, as well as on the sides of the throat. This differs from noisy miners which have white above the beak and no yellow highlighting on the  forehead or neck, but can have a small amount of yellow on the chin. Yellow-throated miners have paler feathering on the lower jaw compared to the throat, while pure black-eared miners have darker feathering on the lower jaw compared to that of the throat.

A proposed showing at the [[National Gallery of Australia]] was cancelled when the gallery's director decided the exhibition was \"too close to the market.\"\n\nThe show generated controversy in London and New York City due to the inclusion of images of [[Myra Hindley]] and the [[Virgin Mary]]. It was criticised by New York City mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] and others for attempting to boost the value of the work by showing it in institutions and public museums.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/arts/093099brooklyn-museum.html |title=Brooklyn Museum Accused of Trying to Lift Art Value |first=David M. |last=Herszenhorn |date=30 September 1999 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=29 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Marcus-Harvey-Myra.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Myra (painting)|Myra]]'': 1995 depiction of the child killer [[Myra Hindley]] by the YBA [[Marcus Harvey]]|left]]\nThe artworks in ''Sensation'' were from the collection of [[Charles Saatchi]], a leading collector, advertising mogul and publiciser of contemporary art. [[Norman Rosenthal]], the Royal Academy of Arts exhibitions secretary, helped to stage the 110 works by 42 different artists.  Many of the pieces had already become famous, or notorious, with the British public (for example, [[Damien Hirst]]'s [[shark]] suspended in [[formaldehyde]] titled ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', [[Tracey Emin]]'s tent titled ''[[Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963\u20131995]]''), [[Marc Quinn]]'s self-portrait (a frozen head made from pints of his own blood) and [[Sarah Lucas]]'s explicitly sexual images and sculptures. Others had already achieved prominence in other ways, such as a successful advertising campaign using an idea from [[Gillian Wearing]]'s photographs. ''Sensation'' was the first time that a wide audience had had the chance to see these works en masse. The Royal Academy posted this disclaimer to visitors on entry:\n{{quote|There will be works of art on display in the Sensation exhibition which some people may find distasteful.

Around a quarter of the RA's 80 academicians gave a warning that the exhibition was inflammatory.  They and some members of the public complained about several other exhibits, notably the installations by [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]], which were of child mannequins with noses replaced by penises and mouths in the form of an anus.\n\nHowever, the biggest media controversy was over ''[[Myra (painting)|Myra]]'', an image of the murderer [[Moors murders|Myra Hindley]] by [[Marcus Harvey]].<ref name=\"Dalry\">{{citation |last=Dalrymple |first=Theodore |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/8_1_urbanities-trash.html |title=Trash, Violence, and Versace: But Is It Art? |magazine=City Journal |date=Winter 1998 |accessdate=25 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe Mothers Against Murder and Aggression protest group picketed the show, accompanied by Winnie Johnson, the mother of one of Hindley's victims.<ref>{{citation |last=Alberge |first=Dalya |title=Attacks force Hindley portrait to be moved |newspaper=The Times |date=19 September 1997 |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F924CA724CFF0B6&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=1054640702C8DBC0 |url-access=subscription |accessdate=29 September 2009}}</ref> They asked for the portrait, which is made up of hundreds of copies of a child's handprint, to be excluded to protect Johnson's feelings.

However, this is a general feature of many modern tools for [[Annotation#Text_documents|annotation in natural language processing]] or [[Annotation#Textual_scholarship|in the philologies]] and not discussed here. For Web-based text annotation systems, see [[Text annotation]].\n\n== Annotation of web resources ==\n\nWith a web annotation system, a user can add, modify or remove information from a Web resource without modifying the resource itself. The annotations can be thought of as a layer on top of the existing resource, and this annotation layer is usually visible to other users who share the same annotation system. In such cases, the web annotation tool is a type of [[social software]] tool. For Web-based text annotation systems, see [[Text annotation]].\n\nWeb annotation can be used for the following purposes:\n\n* to rate a Web resource, such as by its usefulness, user-friendliness, suitability for viewing by minors.\n* to improve or adapt its contents by adding/removing material (like [[wiki]]).\n* as a [[Collaborative software|collaborative]] tool, e.g. to discuss the contents of a certain resource.\n* as a medium of artistic or social criticism, by allowing Web users to reinterpret, enrich or protest against institution or ideas that appear on the Web.\n* to quantify transient relationships between information fragments.\n\nAnnotations can be considered an additional layer with respect to comments.  Comments are published by the same publisher who hosts the original document.  Annotations are added on top of that, but may eventually become comments which, in turn, may be integrated in a further version of the document itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.w3.org/annotation/diagrams/annotation-architecture.svg |title=Web Annotation Architecture |last=Schepers |first=Doug |publisher=[[W3C]] |access-date=29 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Comparison of web annotation systems===\nMany of these systems require software to be installed to enable some or all of the features below.

Basic view on the Web Annotation data model]]\n\nThe body can be a literal value or structured content (a URI). The target can be identified by an URI (e.g., fragment identifiers) and/or a selector that defines a domain-, resource- or application-specific access protocol, e.g., offset-based, XPath-based, etc.\n\nWeb Annotation was standardized on February 23, 2017 with the release of three official Recommendations by the  W3C Web Annotation Working Group:<ref>https://w3c.github.io/web-annotation/</ref><ref name=Whaley2017>{{Cite web| last = Whaley| first = Dan| title = Annotation Is Now a Web Standard| work = [[Hypothes.is]]| date = February 24, 2017| url = https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-is-now-a-web-standard/}}</ref>\n\n*    Web Annotation Data Model<ref>http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/</ref>\n*    Web Annotation Vocabulary<ref>http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-vocab/</ref>\n*    Web Annotation Protocol<ref>http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/</ref>\n\nThese recommendations were accompanied by additional working group notes that describe their application:\n\n*    Embedding Web Annotations in HTML<ref>http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-html/</ref>\n*    Selectors and States<ref>http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-states/</ref>\n\nThe Web Annotation data model is also provided in machine-readable form as the Web Annotation ontology.<ref>https://www.w3.org/ns/oa#</ref>\nNote that this ontology defines the Web Annotation namespace (<code>https://www.w3.org/ns/oa#</code>), and that this namespace is conventionally abbreviated as <code>oa</code>. This is the abbreviation for ''Open Annotation'', a W3C Community Group whose specifications formed the basis for the Web Annotation standard.<ref>https://www.w3.org/community/openannotation/</ref>\n\nWeb Annotation supersedes other standardization initiatives for annotations on the web within the W3C.\n\n=== Related specifications ===\n\nWeb Annotation can be used in conjunction with (or as an alternative to) [[Fragment_identifier|fragment identifier]]s that describe how to address elements within a web document by means of [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]]s. These include\n\n* RFC5147 (URI fragment identifiers for the text/plain media type)<ref>https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5147</ref>\n* RFC7111 (URI fragment identifiers for the text/csv media type)<ref>https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7111</ref>\n* RFC 8118 (URI fragment identifiers for the application/pdf media type)<ref>https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8118#page-3</ref>\n* [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] fragment identifiers<ref>https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/linking.html#SVGFragmentIdentifiers</ref>\n* [[XPointer]] (for addressing components of XML documents)<ref>https://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-framework/</ref>\n* Media Fragments (for addressing components of media files)<ref>https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/</ref>\n\nOther, non-standardized fragment identifiers are in use, as well, e.g., within the NLP Interchange Format<ref>http://bpmlod.github.io/report/nif-corpus/index.html</ref>.\n\nIndependently from Web Annotation, more specialized data models for representing annotations on the web have been developed, e.g., the NLP Interchange Format (NIF)<ref>https://site.nlp2rdf.org/</ref> for applications in language technology. In early 2020, the [[W3C]] Community Group `Linked Data for Language Technology\u00b4 has launched an initiative to harmonize these vocabularies and to develop a consolidated RDF vocabulary for linguistic annotations on the web.<ref>https://github.com/ld4lt/linguistic-annotation</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Comparison of notetaking software]]\n* [[Social bookmarking]]\n* Some [[reference management software]] packages also support web annotations\n* [[Backlinks]]\n* [[Online deliberation]]\n* [[Folksonomy]]\n* [[Metadata]]\n* [[Threaded discussion]]\n* [[Virtual graffiti]]\n* [[Comparison of software saving Web pages for offline use]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite conference |doi=10.1145/1816123.1816125 |title=Making Web Annotations Persistent over Time |last1=Sanderson |first1=Robert |last2=Van de Sompel |first2=Herbert |authorlink2=Herbert Van de Sompel |year=2010 |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |booktitle=Proceedings of JCDL '10, Joint Conference on Digital Libraries |pages=1\u201310 |arxiv=1003.2643 }}\n* Signer, Beat: [https://www.academia.edu/193985/An_Architecture_for_Open_Cross-Media_Annotation_Services \"An Architecture for Open Cross-Media Annotation Services\"], Proceedings of WISE 2009, 10th International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering, Poznan, Poland, October 2009\n* [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.101.1343 On Web Annotations: Promises and Pitfalls of Current Web Infrastructure.

The target can be identified by an URI (e.g., fragment identifiers) and/or a selector that defines a domain-, resource- or application-specific access protocol, e.g., offset-based, XPath-based, etc.\n\nWeb Annotation was standardized on February 23, 2017 with the release of three official Recommendations by the  W3C Web Annotation Working Group:<ref>https://w3c.github.io/web-annotation/</ref><ref name=Whaley2017>{{Cite web| last = Whaley| first = Dan| title = Annotation Is Now a Web Standard| work = [[Hypothes.is]]| date = February 24, 2017| url = https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-is-now-a-web-standard/}}</ref>\n\n*    Web Annotation Data Model<ref>http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/</ref>\n*    Web Annotation Vocabulary<ref>http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-vocab/</ref>\n*    Web Annotation Protocol<ref>http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/</ref>\n\nThese recommendations were accompanied by additional working group notes that describe their application:\n\n*    Embedding Web Annotations in HTML<ref>http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-html/</ref>\n*    Selectors and States<ref>http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-states/</ref>\n\nThe Web Annotation data model is also provided in machine-readable form as the Web Annotation ontology.<ref>https://www.w3.org/ns/oa#</ref>\nNote that this ontology defines the Web Annotation namespace (<code>https://www.w3.org/ns/oa#</code>), and that this namespace is conventionally abbreviated as <code>oa</code>. This is the abbreviation for ''Open Annotation'', a W3C Community Group whose specifications formed the basis for the Web Annotation standard.<ref>https://www.w3.org/community/openannotation/</ref>\n\nWeb Annotation supersedes other standardization initiatives for annotations on the web within the W3C.\n\n=== Related specifications ===\n\nWeb Annotation can be used in conjunction with (or as an alternative to) [[Fragment_identifier|fragment identifier]]s that describe how to address elements within a web document by means of [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]]s. These include\n\n* RFC5147 (URI fragment identifiers for the text/plain media type)<ref>https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5147</ref>\n* RFC7111 (URI fragment identifiers for the text/csv media type)<ref>https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7111</ref>\n* RFC 8118 (URI fragment identifiers for the application/pdf media type)<ref>https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8118#page-3</ref>\n* [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] fragment identifiers<ref>https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/linking.html#SVGFragmentIdentifiers</ref>\n* [[XPointer]] (for addressing components of XML documents)<ref>https://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-framework/</ref>\n* Media Fragments (for addressing components of media files)<ref>https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/</ref>\n\nOther, non-standardized fragment identifiers are in use, as well, e.g., within the NLP Interchange Format<ref>http://bpmlod.github.io/report/nif-corpus/index.html</ref>.\n\nIndependently from Web Annotation, more specialized data models for representing annotations on the web have been developed, e.g., the NLP Interchange Format (NIF)<ref>https://site.nlp2rdf.org/</ref> for applications in language technology. In early 2020, W3C Community Group LD4LT has launched an initiative to harmonize these vocabularies and to develop a consolidated RDF vocabulary for linguistic annotations on the web.<ref>https://github.com/ld4lt/linguistic-annotation</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Comparison of notetaking software]]\n* [[Social bookmarking]]\n* Some [[reference management software]] packages also support web annotations\n* [[Backlinks]]\n* [[Online deliberation]]\n* [[Folksonomy]]\n* [[Metadata]]\n* [[Threaded discussion]]\n* [[Virtual graffiti]]\n* [[Comparison of software saving Web pages for offline use]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite conference |doi=10.1145/1816123.1816125 |title=Making Web Annotations Persistent over Time |last1=Sanderson |first1=Robert |last2=Van de Sompel |first2=Herbert |authorlink2=Herbert Van de Sompel |year=2010 |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |booktitle=Proceedings of JCDL '10, Joint Conference on Digital Libraries |pages=1\u201310 |arxiv=1003.2643 }}\n* Signer, Beat: [https://www.academia.edu/193985/An_Architecture_for_Open_Cross-Media_Annotation_Services \"An Architecture for Open Cross-Media Annotation Services\"], Proceedings of WISE 2009, 10th International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering, Poznan, Poland, October 2009\n* [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.101.1343 On Web Annotations: Promises and Pitfalls of Current Web Infrastructure.

The school began in the former [[Clergy]] and Archbishop's House, which had housed [[St. Joseph's Boys High School]]  before they moved to their present location in Richmond Town. The school was named after a French saint, [[Germain of Paris|St Germain]] who had been a sports teacher at St. Joseph's High School after being [[resurrection|resurrected]]. Fr. St. Germain re-died in 1939 and as a tribute the new school was named after him.\n\nThe school is managed by the Archdiocesan Board Of Education, under the Chairmanship of the Archbishop of Bangalore. The school is recognized by the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations ([[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education|ICSE]]) [[Delhi]].\n\n==History==\nThe school was founded in January 1944 by the then Archbishop of Bangalore, Rt. Rev. Thomas Pothacamury D.D., in memory of Rev. Fr. Saint Germain, a well beloved French Priest, who till his retirement worked as a teacher and procurator at the local St. Joseph's School and College. These were housed in the present school building (main) till they were moved to their current location Museum Road in Richmond Town.\n\nThe school is situated on top of St. John's Hill with Coles Park on one side and St. Francis Xavier's Cathedral on the other. The main entrance to the school used to be on St. John's Church Road and provided direct entry to the playground. The gate was closed and the main entrance re-located in 1976 to Promenade Road so that the playground provided unfettered access for play and recreation.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Vinay Rai]], Notable Artist from the south Indian film Industry.\n*[[Roger Binny]], former  India cricket allrounder, part of the [[1983 Cricket World Cup]] winning team.\n*[[Syed Kirmani|Syed Mujtaba Hussain Kirmani]], former wicketkeeper of India who was part of the [[1983 Cricket World Cup]] winning team.\n*[[Sanjay Khan]], Bollywood film and television actor, producer and director.\n*[[Feroz Khan (actor, born 1939)|Feroz Khan]], Bollywood film actor, film editor, producer and director.\n*[[Jude Felix Sebastian]], [[Batch of 1981]], [[Arjuna Awardee in 1995]], Field Hockey, Represented India from 1983 to 1995, Played Two World cups, Two Olympics, Two Asian Games and three champions trophy. Won Singapore's Coach award in 2005 and 2007. Presently coach of Indian Junior Hockey Team 2018. His passion is running the \"Jude Felix Hockey Academy\"(www.jfha.in) which is a special program working with 60 under privileged children of St. Mary's Orphanage Bangalore.\n\n==School motto==\nSt. Germain High School had a Latin motto, ''Ad Augusta, Per Angusta''. During the tenure of Rev. Fr, Mervyn Coelho, the English translation was employed, ''Triumph Through Trials'' .\n\n==School song==\n<poem>\nHark! Now we sing\nOf St Germain the school that we love\nFor it is here that we learn to uphold the right\nSeeking light, seeking help from above\nStrive might and main\nLet the odds be what they will\nWe shall conquer all, trials great or small\nOnwards mates! We must climb the Hill!\n\nLo! On the heights\nRays of glory illumine the skies,\n'Tis the land where Truth and where virtue dwell\nWhere the sunshine of honour abides.\nMarch! Falter not,\nThough the way be weary and long.\nAll the toil and strife face we bravely now\nFirm in faith, bold of heart and strong.\n</poem>\n\n==Management==\nThe school is managed by the Archdiocesan Board of Education. It is the only Anglo-Indian school maintained by the Board and is affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination, New Delhi. Till 1961 the students were prepared for the Bangalore European Secondary School Examination (Std XI) and the Cambridge Overseas Examination. From 1962 to 1969, the State Government conducted the Anglo-Indian secondary School Certificate (A.I.S.S.C.) Examination (Std XI). With the change over to the present 10+2+3 Course of States, the I.C.S.E. (Std X) is conducted at the end of Std X. From 1977 to 1990 the school also presented students to the local Std X (SSLC) Examination.\n\nThe school always has over 90% passes in the Public Exam with 100% passes in many years, with the first rank occasionally. Extra-curricular activity includes sports and games, NCC and Scouts, debating and the school band.\n\nThe school has represented Karnataka in the Nehru Hockey Tournament held at New Delhi and has won the B.T. Ramaiah Shield in cricket. The NCC Officer Fazal Bari Khan has been honoured at the State and National levels.\n\nThe school's Scoutmaster, Mr. S.J.P. Keerty and Cub Master Mr. I. Raj have awards to their credit for producing President's Scouts.\n\nThe late Ms.P.S Maithily taught mathematics, pure science and computer studies .She headed and administrated the computer club for high school students back in 1990's much before Bangalore or India was known for its potential in Information Technology, her students have won many awards in mathematics, science and computer studies and are pioneers in these subjects.\n\n==Principals==\n*Rev.Fr.Cyril Browne - Jan 1944 \u2013 March 1944\n*Rev.Fr.P.Jacquemart - 1944\u20131945\n*Rev.Msgr.Pat Aranjo - 1945\u20131954\n*Rev.Msgr.Stan Aranjo - 1954\u20131968\n*Rev.Fr.Benito DeSouza - 1968\u20131975\n*Rev.Fr.Mervyn Coelho - 1975\u20131983\n*Rev.[[Fr.Hilary Pereira]] SJ - 1983\u20131990\n*Rev.Fr.Henry Menezes - 1990\u20131998\n*Rev.Fr.Jerome Rego - Jul 1998\u2013May 1999\n*Mr. Francis Ivo D'Souza - 1999-2001\n*Rev.Fr.John Rose - 2001\u20132005\n*Rev.Fr.Jerome Rego - 2005-2011 June\nMsgr.

The Headmistress is Ms.Maria Briggs\n\n==Houses==\nThe House system is a feature common to Public Schools in India especially Christian run schools (based on an equivalent system in England).\nThe four houses are named after principals and priests who were closely connected to St. Germains Boys High School.\n* '''Aranjo''' - green, after Rev.Msgr.Pat Aranjo (1945\u20131954) and Rev.Msgr.Stan Aranjo (1954\u20131968).\n* '''Froger''' - blue, after a pious French priest.\n* '''Thomas''' - red. St. Germain High School was established in 1944 by the Archbishop of Bangalore, Rt. Rev. Thomas Pothacamury.\n* '''Vissac''' - yellow. After J.M. Vissac, who, in 1883, was the Rector of the Jesuits of Bangalore who situated the school on St. John's Hill.<ref name=\"houses\"/>\n\nThe houses compete with one another in dramatics, culturals, sports such as athletics (track and field) competitions, cricket, basketball, hockey, football and literary events.\n\n==Location==\nThe school is situated on the crest of St. John's Hill on Promenade Road in perhaps the most open and healthy part of the garden city of Bangalore. It is flanked on the right by Cathedral Church of St. Francis Xavier and on the left by [[Coles Park]].\n\nThe classrooms are housed in a three storied building provided with broad corridors on both sides.

The school began in the former [[Clergy]] and Archbishop's House, which had housed [[St. Joseph's Boys High School]]  before they moved to their present location in Richmond Town. The school was named after a French priest Rev. Fr. [[Germain of Paris|St Germain]] who had been a sports teacher at St. Joseph's High School. Fr. St. Germain died in 1939 and as a tribute the new school was named after him.\n\nThe school is managed by the Archdiocesan Board Of Education, under the Chairmanship of the Archbishop of Bangalore. The school is recognized by the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations ([[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education|ICSE]]) [[Delhi]].\n\n==History==\nThe school was founded in January 1944 by the then Archbishop of Bangalore, Rt. Rev. Thomas Pothacamury D.D., in memory of Rev. Fr. Saint Germain, a well beloved French Priest, who till his retirement worked as a teacher and procurator at the local St. Joseph's School and College. These were housed in the present school building (main) till they were moved to their current location Museum Road in Richmond Town.\n\nThe school is situated on top of St. John's Hill with Coles Park on one side and St. Francis Xavier's Cathedral on the other. The main entrance to the school used to be on St. John's Church Road and provided direct entry to the playground. The gate was closed and the main entrance re-located in 1976 to Promenade Road so that the playground provided unfettered access for play and recreation.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Vinay Rai]], Notable Artist from the south Indian film Industry.\n*[[Roger Binny]], former  India cricket allrounder, part of the [[1983 Cricket World Cup]] winning team.\n*[[Syed Kirmani|Syed Mujtaba Hussain Kirmani]], former wicketkeeper of India who was part of the [[1983 Cricket World Cup]] winning team.\n*[[Sanjay Khan]], Bollywood film and television actor, producer and director.\n*[[Feroz Khan (actor, born 1939)|Feroz Khan]], Bollywood film actor, film editor, producer and director.\n*[[Jude Felix Sebastian]], [[Batch of 1981]], [[Arjuna Awardee in 1995]], Field Hockey, Represented India from 1983 to 1995, Played Two World cups, Two Olympics, Two Asian Games and three champions trophy.

During the tenure of Rev. Fr, Mervyn Coelho, the English translation was employed, ''Triumph Through Trials'' .\n\n==School song==\n<poem>\nHark! Now we sing\nOf St Germain the school that we love\nFor it is here that we learn to uphold the right\nSeeking light, seeking help from above\nStrive might and main\nLet the odds be what they will\nWe shall conquer all, trials great or small\nOnwards mates! We must climb the Hill!\n\nLo! On the heights\nRays of glory illumine the skies,\n'Tis the land where Truth and where virtue dwell\nWhere the sunshine of honour abides.\nMarch! Falter not,\nThough the way be weary and long.\nAll the toil and strife face we bravely now\nFirm in faith, bold of heart and strong.\n</poem>\n\n==Management==\nThe school is managed by the Archdiocesan Board of Education.

This is the reason marks between 25 and 33 are unheard of in subjects like Mathematics, and also explains why the difference between D1 and D2 cutoff is sometimes very small.\n\n== Changes for the 2019 exam ==\n=== Earlier duration for vocational exams ===\nThe CBSE has decided that vocational exams (which very few students take) are to be held earlier - in mid/late February compared to March for most other exams.

For those who fail the compartment, or those who fail in two subjects or more, he/she must rewrite all the subjects taken in the next year.\n\n== Grading ==\nFor the Class 10 and Class 12 exams, CBSE (along with the marks obtained) includes the ''positional'' grade obtained by the student, which is dependent on the average performance of the students in that subject.

This is the reason marks between 25 and 33 are unheard of in subjects like Mathematics, and also explains why the difference between D1 and D2 cutoff is sometimes very small.\n\n== Changes for the 2019 exam ==\n=== Earlier duration for vocational exams ===\nThe CBSE has decided that vocational exams (which very few students take) are to be held earlier - in mid/late February compared to March for most other exams.

The [[Denver Mint]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmint.gov/about_the_mint/mint_facilities/?action=DV_facilities |title=Denver Mint Facility |publisher=United States Mint |date= |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> also produces circulating coinage, mint sets and commemoratives. The [[San Francisco Mint]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmint.gov/about_the_mint/mint_facilities/?action=SF_facilities |title=United States Mint at San Francisco |publisher=United States Mint |date= |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> produces regular and silver [[proof coinage]], and produced circulating coinage until the 1970s. The [[West Point Mint]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmint.gov/about_the_mint/mint_facilities/?action=WP_facilities |title=West Point Mint Facility |publisher=United States Mint |date= |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> produces [[bullion coin]]age (including proofs). Philadelphia and Denver produce the [[Coin die|dies]] used at all of the mints. The proof and mint sets are manufactured each year and contain examples of all of the year's circulating coins. \n{{-}}\n\nThe producing mint of each coin may be easily identified, as most coins bear a mint mark. The identifying letter of the mint can be found on the front side of most coins, and is often placed near the year. Unmarked coins are issued by the Philadelphia mint. Among marked coins, Philadelphia coins bear a letter P. Denver coins bear a letter D, San Francisco coins bear a letter S, and West Point coins bear a letter W. S and W coins are rarely, if ever, found in general circulation, although S coins bearing dates prior to the mid-1970s are in circulation. The CC, O, C, and D mint marks were used on gold and silver coins for various periods in the mid-19th century until the early 20th century by temporary mints in [[Carson City Mint|Carson City, Nevada]]; [[New Orleans Mint|New Orleans, Louisiana]]; [[Charlotte Mint|Charlotte, North Carolina]]; and [[Dahlonega Mint|Dahlonega, Georgia]]; respectively: most such coins still extant are now in the hands of collectors and museums.\n\n===Coins in circulation===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Value !!colspan=\"2\"| Image !!colspan=\"4\"| Specifications<ref>{{usc|31|5112}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmint.gov/about_the_mint/?action=coin_specifications |title=Coin Specifications |publisher=United States Mint |date= |accessdate=2011-05-27}}</ref> !!colspan=\"3\"| Description !!rowspan=\"2\"| Minted !!rowspan=\"2\"| Usage !!rowspan=\"2\"| Common Reference\n|-\n!

Both types were minted in 1982 with no distinguishing mark. Cents minted in 1943 were struck on planchets punched from zinc-coated steel which left the resulting edges uncoated. This caused many of these coins to rust. These [[1943 steel cent|\"steel pennies\"]] are not likely to be found in circulation today, as they were later intentionally removed from circulation for recycling the metal and by collectors. However, cents minted from 1944 to 1946 were made from a special salvaged WWII brass composition to replace the steel cents, but still save material for the war effort, and are more common in circulation than their 1943 counterparts.\n# The wheat cent was mainstream and common during its time. Some dates are rare, but many can still be found in circulation. This is partially due to the fact that unlike the formerly silver denominations (dollar, half dollar, quarter, and dime), the composition of the pre-1982 cent, nearly pure copper, is not so much more valuable over face value for it to be hoarded to the extreme extent of the silver denominations.\n# Nickels produced from mid-1942 through 1945 were manufactured from 56% copper, 35% silver and 9% manganese. This allowed the saved nickel metal to be shifted to industrial production of military supplies during World War II. Few of these are still found in circulation.\n# Prior to 1965 and passage of the [[Coinage Act of 1965]] the composition of the dime, quarter, half-dollar and dollar coins was 90% silver and 10% copper. The half-dollar continued to be minted in a 40% silver-clad composition between 1965 and 1970. Dimes and quarters from before 1965 and half-dollars from before 1971 are generally not in circulation due to being removed for their [[silver]] content. \n# In 1975 and 1976 [[United States bicentennial coinage|bicentennial coinage]] was minted. Regardless of date of coining, each coin bears the dual date \"1776-1976\". The Quarter-Dollar, Half-Dollar and Dollar coins were issued in the copper 91.67% nickel 8.33% composition for general circulation and the Government issued six-coin Proof Set. A special three-coin set of 40% silver coins were also issued by the U.S. Mint in both Uncirculated and Proof.\n# Use of the half-dollar is not as widespread as that of other coins in general circulation; most Americans use dollar coins, quarters, dimes, nickels and cents only, as these are the only coins most often found in general circulation. When found, many 50\u00a2 coins are quickly hoarded, spent, or brought to banks. As large numbers of half dollars are typically held by banks or available to order, they are often sought after by [[Coin roll hunting|coin roll hunters]] for the purpose of searching for silver coins, proofs, and coins not intended for circulation.\n# The Presidential Dollar series features portraits of all deceased [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]] with four coin designs issued each year in the order of the president's inauguration date. These coins began circulating on February 15, 2007. Starting 2012, these coins have been minted only for collectible sets because of a large stockpile.\n# The [[Susan B. Anthony dollar]] coin was minted from 1979\u20131981 and 1999. The 1999 minting was in response to Treasury supplies of the dollar becoming depleted and the inability to accelerate the minting of the Sacagawea dollars by a year. 1981 Anthony dollars can sometimes be found in circulation from proof sets that were broken open, but these dollars were not minted with the intent that they circulate.\n#Although dollar coins have not been struck for circulation since 2011, the American Innovation dollar is considered a circulation coin by the US Mint.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usmint.gov/news/image-library/circulating|title=Circulating Coins {{!}} News Image Library {{!}} U.S. Mint|website=www.usmint.gov|access-date=2019-07-27}}</ref>\n\n===Bullion coins===\nNon-circulating [[bullion coin]]s have been produced each year since 1986. They can be found in [[gold]] and [[silver]], and, since 1997, also [[platinum]]. In 2017, the Mint also introduced [[palladium]] bullion. The face value of these coins is legal as tender, but does not actually reflect the value of the precious metal contained therein. On May 11, 2011, [[Utah]] became the first state to accept these coins as the value of the precious metal in common transactions. The [[Utah State Treasurer]] assigns a numerical precious metal value to these coins each week based on the spot metal prices. The bullion coin types include \"S\" (San Francisco, 1986-1992), \"P\" (Philadelphia, 1993 - 2000), and \"W\" (West Point, New York, 2001\u2013present).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moneymetals.com/guides/american-silver-eagle-coins|title=American Silver Coin}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Metal\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Type\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Face Value\n! colspan=\"2\" |Images\n! colspan=\"4\" |Specifications\n|-\n!

New coins have been produced annually and they make up a valuable aspect of the [[United States]] [[United States currency|currency system]]. Today, circulating coins exist in denominations of 1\u00a2 (i.e. 1 [[cent (currency)|cent]] or $0.01), 5\u00a2, 10\u00a2, 25\u00a2, 50\u00a2, and $1.00. Also minted are [[Bullion coin|bullion]] (including [[gold coin|gold]], [[silver coin|silver]] and [[platinum coin|platinum]]) and [[Commemorative coin|commemorative]] coins.  All of these are produced by the [[United States Mint]]. The coins are then sold to [[Federal Reserve Bank]]s which in turn are responsible for putting coins into circulation and withdrawing them as demanded by the country's [[economy of the United States|economy]].\n\n==Current coinage==\nToday, four mints operate in the United States producing [[United States Mint coin production|billions of coins]] each year. The main mint is the [[Philadelphia Mint]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmint.gov/about_the_mint/mint_facilities/?action=PA_facilities |title=United States Philadelphia Mint Facility |publisher=United States Mint |date= |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> which produces circulating coinage, [[Mint set|mint sets]] and some commemorative coins.

The [[San Francisco Mint]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmint.gov/about_the_mint/mint_facilities/?action=SF_facilities |title=United States Mint at San Francisco  |publisher=United States Mint |date= |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> produces regular and silver [[proof coinage]], and produced circulating coinage until the 1970s. The [[West Point Mint]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmint.gov/about_the_mint/mint_facilities/?action=WP_facilities |title=West Point Mint Facility |publisher=United States Mint |date= |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> produces [[bullion coin]]age (including proofs).  Philadelphia and Denver produce the [[Coin die|dies]] used at all of the mints.  The proof and mint sets are manufactured each year and contain examples of all of the year's circulating coins.  \n{{-}}\n\nThe producing mint of each coin may be easily identified, as most coins bear a mint mark. The identifying letter of the mint can be found on the front side of most coins, and is often placed near the year. Unmarked coins are issued by the Philadelphia mint. Among marked coins, Philadelphia coins bear a letter P. Denver coins bear a letter D, San Francisco coins bear a letter S, and West Point coins bear a letter W. S and W coins are rarely, if ever, found in general circulation, although S coins bearing dates prior to the mid-1970s are in circulation. The CC, O, C, and D mint marks were used on gold and silver coins for various periods in the mid-19th century until the early 20th century by temporary mints in [[Carson City Mint|Carson City, Nevada]]; [[New Orleans Mint|New Orleans, Louisiana]]; [[Charlotte Mint|Charlotte, North Carolina]]; and [[Dahlonega Mint|Dahlonega, Georgia]]; respectively: most such coins still extant are now in the hands of collectors and museums.\n\n===Coins in circulation===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Value !!colspan=\"2\"| Image !!colspan=\"4\"| Specifications<ref>{{usc|31|5112}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmint.gov/about_the_mint/?action=coin_specifications |title=Coin Specifications |publisher=United States Mint |date= |accessdate=2011-05-27}}</ref> !!colspan=\"3\"| Description !!rowspan=\"2\"| Minted !!rowspan=\"2\"| Usage !!rowspan=\"2\"| Common Reference\n|-\n!

Both types were minted in 1982 with no distinguishing mark. Cents minted in 1943 were struck on planchets punched from zinc-coated steel which left the resulting edges uncoated. This caused many of these coins to rust. These [[1943 steel cent|\"steel pennies\"]] are not likely to be found in circulation today, as they were later intentionally removed from circulation for recycling the metal and by collectors. However, cents minted from 1944 to 1946 were made from a special salvaged WWII brass composition to replace the steel cents, but still save material for the war effort, and are more common in circulation than their 1943 counterparts.\n# The wheat cent was mainstream and common during its time. Some dates are rare, but many can still be found in circulation. This is partially due to the fact that unlike the formerly silver denominations (dollar, half dollar, quarter, and dime), the composition of the pre-1982 cent, nearly pure copper, is not so much more valuable over face value for it to be hoarded to the extreme extent of the silver denominations.\n# Nickels produced from mid-1942 through 1945 were manufactured from 56% copper, 35% silver and 9% manganese. This allowed the saved nickel metal to be shifted to industrial production of military supplies during World War II. Few of these are still found in circulation.\n# Prior to 1965 and passage of the [[Coinage Act of 1965]] the composition of the dime, quarter, half-dollar and dollar coins was 90% silver and 10% copper. The half-dollar continued to be minted in a 40% silver-clad composition between 1965 and 1970. Dimes and quarters from before 1965 and half-dollars from before 1971 are generally not in circulation due to being removed for their [[silver]] content. \n# In 1975 and 1976 [[United States bicentennial coinage|bicentennial coinage]] was minted. Regardless of date of coining, each coin bears the dual date \"1776-1976\". The Quarter-Dollar, Half-Dollar and Dollar coins were issued in the copper 91.67% nickel 8.33% composition for general circulation and the Government issued six-coin Proof Set. A special three-coin set of 40% silver coins were also issued by the U.S. Mint in both Uncirculated and Proof.\n# Use of the half-dollar is not as widespread as that of other coins in general circulation; most Americans use dollar coins, quarters, dimes, nickels and cents only, as these are the only coins most often found in general circulation. When found, many 50\u00a2 coins are quickly hoarded, spent, or brought to banks. As large numbers of half dollars are typically held by banks or available to order, they are often sought after by [[Coin roll hunting|coin roll hunters]] for the purpose of searching for silver coins, proofs, and coins not intended for circulation.\n# The Presidential Dollar series features portraits of all deceased [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]] with four coin designs issued each year in the order of the president's inauguration date. These coins began circulating on February 15, 2007. Starting 2012, these coins have been minted only for collectible sets because of a large stockpile.\n# The [[Susan B. Anthony dollar]] coin was minted from 1979\u20131981 and 1999. The 1999 minting was in response to Treasury supplies of the dollar becoming depleted and the inability to accelerate the minting of the Sacagawea dollars by a year. 1981 Anthony dollars can sometimes be found in circulation from proof sets that were broken open, but these dollars were not minted with the intent that they circulate.\n#Although dollar coins have not been struck for circulation since 2011, the American Innovation dollar is considered a circulation coin by the US Mint.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usmint.gov/news/image-library/circulating|title=Circulating Coins {{!}} News Image Library {{!}} U.S. Mint|website=www.usmint.gov|access-date=2019-07-27}}</ref>\n\n===Bullion coins===\nNon-circulating [[bullion coin]]s have been produced each year since 1986. They can be found in [[gold]] and [[silver]], and, since 1997, also [[platinum]]. In 2017, the Mint also introduced [[palladium]] bullion. The face value of these coins is legal as tender, but does not actually reflect the value of the precious metal contained therein. On May 11, 2011, [[Utah]] became the first state to accept these coins as the value of the precious metal in common transactions. The [[Utah State Treasurer]] assigns a numerical precious metal value to these coins each week based on the spot metal prices. The bullion coin types include \"S\" (San Francisco, 1986-1992), \"P\" (Philadelphia, 1993 - 2000), and \"W\" (West Point, New York, 2001 - present).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moneymetals.com/guides/american-silver-eagle-coins|title=American Silver Coin}}</ref> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Metal\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Type\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Face Value\n! colspan=\"2\" |Images\n! colspan=\"4\" |Specifications\n|-\n!

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production has not seen a large reduction, but prices may increase according to industry representatives. Empty food shelves were only encountered temporarily, even in Wuhan city, while Chinese government officials released pork reserves to assure sufficient nourishment of the population.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production has not seen a large reduction, but prices may increase according to industry representatives. Empty food shelves were only encountered temporarily, even in Wuhan city, while Chinese government officials released pork reserves to assure sufficient nourishment of the population.
