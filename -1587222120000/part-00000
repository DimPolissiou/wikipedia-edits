Blazars are highly variable sources, often undergoing rapid and dramatic fluctuations in brightness on short timescales (hours to days). Some blazar jets exhibit apparent [[superluminal motion]], another consequence of material in the jet traveling toward the observer at nearly the speed of light.\n\nThe blazar category includes [[BL Lacertae object|BL Lac objects]] and [[OVV quasar|optically violently variable (OVV) quasars]]. The generally accepted theory is that BL Lac objects are intrinsically low-power [[radio galaxy|radio galaxies]] while OVV quasars are intrinsically powerful radio-loud [[quasar]]s. The name \"blazar\" was coined in 1978 by astronomer [[Edward Spiegel]] to denote the combination of these two classes.\n\nIn visible-wavelength images, most blazars appear compact and pointlike, but high-resolution images reveal that they are located at the centers of [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Urry |first1=C.

Gas, dust and the occasional star are captured and spiral into this central black hole, creating a hot [[accretion disc|accretion disk]] which generates enormous amounts of energy in the form of [[photon]]s, [[electron]]s, [[positron]]s and other [[elementary particle]]s. This region is relatively small, approximately 10<sup>\u22123</sup> [[parsec]]s in size.\n\nThere is also a larger opaque [[toroid]] extending several parsecs from the black hole, containing a hot gas with embedded regions of higher density. These \"clouds\" can absorb and re-emit energy from regions closer to the black hole. On Earth, the clouds are detected as soham pandey is great , a pair of [[relativistic jet]]s carries highly energetic [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] away from the AGN. The jet is [[Collimated beam|collimated]] by a combination of intense magnetic fields and powerful winds from the accretion disk and toroid. Inside the jet, high energy photons and particles interact with each other and the strong magnetic field. These relativistic jets can extend as far as many tens of [[parsec|kiloparsecs]] from the central black hole.\n\nAll of these regions can produce a variety of observed energy, mostly in the form of a nonthermal spectrum ranging from very low-frequency radio to extremely energetic gamma rays, with a high [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] (typically a few percent) at some frequencies. The nonthermal spectrum consists of [[synchrotron radiation]] in the radio to X-ray range, and [[Compton scattering|inverse Compton emission]] in the X-ray to gamma-ray region. A thermal spectrum peaking in the ultraviolet region and faint optical emission lines are also present in OVV quasars, but faint or non-existent in BL Lac objects.\n\n==Relativistic beaming==\n\nThe observed emission from a blazar is greatly enhanced by [[special relativity|relativistic effects]] in the jet, a process called [[relativistic beaming]]. The bulk speed of the plasma that constitutes the jet can be in the range of 95%&ndash;99% of the speed of light, although individual particles move at higher speeds in various directions.\n\nThe relationship between the luminosity emitted in the rest frame of the jet and the luminosity observed from Earth depends on the characteristics of the jet. These include whether the luminosity arises from a shock front or a series of brighter blobs in the jet, as well as details of the magnetic fields within the jet and their interaction with the moving particles.\n\nA simple model of [[relativistic beaming|beaming]] illustrates the basic relativistic effects connecting the luminosity in the rest frame of the jet, ''S''<sub>e</sub>, and the luminosity observed on Earth, ''S''<sub>o</sub>:  ''S''<sub>o</sub> is proportional to ''S''<sub>e</sub>&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;''D''<sup>2</sup>, where ''D is'' the [[relativistic beaming|doppler factor]].\n\nWhen considered in much more detail, three relativistic effects are involved:\n\n* Relativistic aberration contributes a factor of ''D''<sup>2</sup>. Aberration is a consequence of special relativity where directions which appear isotropic in the rest frame (in this case, the jet) appear pushed towards the direction of motion in the observer's frame (in this case, Earth).\n* Time dilation contributes a factor of ''D''<sup>+1</sup>. This effect speeds up the apparent release of energy. If the jet emits a burst of energy every minute in its own rest frame, this release would be observed on Earth as much more frequent, perhaps every ten seconds.\n* Windowing can contribute a factor of ''D''<sup>\u22121</sup> and then works to decrease boosting. This happens for a steady flow because there are then ''D'' fewer elements of fluid within the observed window, as each element has been expanded by factor ''D''. However, for a freely propagating blob of material, the radiation is boosted by the full ''D''<sup>+3</sup>.\n\n===Example===\nConsider a jet with an angle to the line of sight \u03b8&nbsp;=&nbsp;5\u00b0 and a speed of 99.9% of the speed of light. The luminosity observed from Earth is 70 times greater than the emitted luminosity. However, if \u03b8 is at the minimum value of 0\u00b0 the jet will appear 600 times brighter from Earth.\n\n===Beaming away===\nRelativistic beaming also has another critical consequence. The jet which is not approaching Earth will appear dimmer because of the same relativistic effects. Therefore, two intrinsically identical jets will appear significantly asymmetric. In the example given above any jet where \u03b8&nbsp;>&nbsp;35\u00b0 will be observed on Earth as less luminous than it would be from the rest frame of the jet.\n\nA further consequence is that a population of intrinsically identical AGN scattered in space with random jet orientations will look like a very inhomogeneous population on Earth. The few objects where \u03b8 is small will have one very bright jet, while the rest will apparently have considerably weaker jets. Those where \u03b8 varies from 90\u00b0 will appear to have asymmetric jets.\n\nThis is the essence behind the connection between blazars and radio galaxies. AGN which have jets oriented close to the line of sight with Earth can appear extremely different from other AGN even if they are intrinsically identical.\n\n==Discovery==\nMany of the brighter blazars were first identified, not as powerful distant galaxies, but as [[irregular variable]] stars in our own galaxy. These blazars, like genuine irregular variable stars, changed in brightness on periods of days or years, but with no pattern.\n\nThe early development of [[radio astronomy]] had shown that there are many bright radio sources in the sky. By the end of the 1950s, the [[Angular resolution|resolution]] of [[radio telescope]]s was sufficient to identify specific radio sources with optical counterparts, leading to the discovery of [[quasar]]s. Blazars were highly represented among these early quasars, and the first redshift was found for [[3C 273]], a highly variable quasar which is also a blazar.\n\nIn 1968, a similar connection was made between the \"variable star\" [[BL Lacertae]] and a powerful radio source VRO 42.22.01.<ref>Schmitt J. L. (1968): \"BL Lac identified as radio source\", ''Nature'' 218, 663</ref> BL Lacertae shows many of the characteristics of quasars, but the optical [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] was devoid of the spectral lines used to determine redshift. Faint indications of an underlying galaxy\u2014proof that BL Lacertae was not a star\u2014were found in 1974.\n\nThe extragalactic nature of BL Lacertae was not a surprise. In 1972 a few variable optical and radio sources were grouped together and proposed as a new class of galaxy: [[BL Lac object|BL Lacertae-type objects]].

Gas, dust and the occasional star are captured and spiral into this central black hole, creating a hot [[accretion disc|accretion disk]] which generates enormous amounts of energy in the form of [[photon]]s, [[electron]]s, [[positron]]s and other [[elementary particle]]s. This region is relatively small, approximately 10<sup>\u22123</sup> [[parsec]]s in size.\n\nThere is also a larger opaque [[toroid]] extending several parsecs from the black hole, containing a hot gas with embedded regions of higher density. These \"clouds\" can absorb and re-emit energy from regions closer to the black hole. On Earth, the clouds are detected as [[spectral line|emission lines]] in the blazar [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]].\n\nPerpendicular to the accretion disk, a pair of [[relativistic jet]]s carries highly energetic [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] away from the AGN. The jet is [[Collimated beam|collimated]] by a combination of intense magnetic fields and powerful winds from the accretion disk and toroid. Inside the jet, high energy photons and particles interact with each other and the strong magnetic field. These relativistic jets can extend as far as many tens of [[parsec|kiloparsecs]] from the central black hole.\n\nAll of these regions can produce a variety of observed energy, mostly in the form of a nonthermal spectrum ranging from very low-frequency radio to extremely energetic gamma rays, with a high [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] (typically a few percent) at some frequencies. The nonthermal spectrum consists of [[synchrotron radiation]] in the radio to X-ray range, and [[Compton scattering|inverse Compton emission]] in the X-ray to gamma-ray region. A thermal spectrum peaking in the ultraviolet region and faint optical emission lines are also present in OVV quasars, but faint or non-existent in BL Lac objects.\n\n==Relativistic beaming==\n\nThe observed emission from a blazar is greatly enhanced by [[special relativity|relativistic effects]] in the jet, a process called [[relativistic beaming]].
