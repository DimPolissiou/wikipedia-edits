It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of the franchise]] and is the third in a [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|series of shows]] that lead to ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' crossover miniseries. The series is produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], with Coker serving as [[showrunner]].\n\n[[Mike Colter]] stars as Luke Cage, a former convict with superhuman strength and unbreakable skin who now fights crime and corruption. [[Simone Missick]], [[Theo Rossi]], [[Rosario Dawson]], and [[Alfre Woodard]] also star, with [[Mahershala Ali]] and [[Erik LaRay Harvey]] joining them for [[Luke Cage (season 1)|season one]], and [[Mustafa Shakir]] and [[Gabrielle Dennis]] joining for [[Luke Cage (season 2)|season two]]. Development of the series began in late 2013. In December 2014, Colter was cast as Cage, to appear first in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Marvel's Jessica Jones]]'', with Coker hired as the showrunner in March 2015. The series is filmed in New York City, looking to replicate the unique culture and atmosphere of [[Harlem]].\n\nAll episodes of the first season premiered on September 30, 2016. They were met with positive reviews. In December 2016, Netflix renewed ''Luke Cage'' for a second season, which was released on June 22, 2018. Following creative differences between Netflix and the series' writers during the development of a third season, Netflix canceled the series on October 19, 2018.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\nWhen a sabotaged experiment gives him super strength and unbreakable skin, [[Luke Cage]] becomes a fugitive attempting to rebuild his life in [[Harlem]] and must soon confront his past and fight a battle for the heart of his city.<ref name=\"Dillard\" /> After clearing his name, Cage becomes a hero and celebrity in Harlem, only to encounter a new threat that makes him confront the line between hero and villain.<ref name=\"S2Premiere\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Luke Cage characters}}\n<!-- Order per the series' opening credits, specifically episode 107 where all names are listed. -->\n* [[Mike Colter]] as [[Luke Cage]]: <br />Former convict Carl Lucas was given superhuman strength and unbreakable skin, and now fights crime under the name Luke Cage.<ref name=\"Colter\" /><ref name=\"NetflixPosts\" /><ref name=\"Colter2\" /><ref name=\"CarlLucas\" /> Colter portrayed the character differently in the series than he had previously in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Marvel's Jessica Jones]]'', explaining, \"You're not always the same person around everyone you know ... you might not necessarily behave the same way around your mom that you would with your wife or your boss\".<ref name=\"JJLCDiff\" /> The character uses his signature catch phrase 'Sweet Christmas' from the comics in the series,<ref name=\"ColterPhrase\" /> but sparingly, with the character often \"opting instead for pensive silence\"; composer [[Adrian Younge]] said, \"He's a black superhero, but he's a different type of black alpha male. He's not bombastic. You rarely see a modern black male character who is soulful and intelligent.\"<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> Colter put on {{convert|30|lb|kg}} of muscle for the role.<ref name=\"ColterAol\" /> David Austin and Clifton Cutrary portray a young and teenage Lucas, respectively.\n* [[Mahershala Ali]] as [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Stokes)|Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes]]: <br />The owner of the Harlem's Paradise nightclub and the cousin of Mariah Dillard who deals in illegal operations.<ref name=\"Ali\" /><ref name=\"Ali2\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016TVLine\" /> Ali described Stokes as \"a ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]''-type villain\",<ref name=\"AliGodfather\" /> while Head of [[Marvel Television]] [[Jeph Loeb]] referred to him as \"the other hero of the story\", continuing the tradition of previous [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Marvel Netflix]] villains [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] and [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]].<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /> Showrunner [[Cheo Hodari Coker]], a former music journalist, said that the attitude of rapper [[The Notorious B.I.G.|Biggie Smalls]] particularly influenced his version of Cottonmouth.<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /><ref name=\"CokerSmalls\" /> Ali took the role knowing that Stokes would die early on in the series, saying the experience \"was like shooting a film ... I found myself excited by a character's departure, because I felt like this was something I could give my all to for a period of time before saying 'peace' to him\".<ref name=\"AliEW\" /> Elijah Boothe portrays a young Stokes.\n* [[Simone Missick]] as [[Misty Knight|Mercedes \"Misty\" Knight]]: <br />A Harlem NYPD Detective with a strong sense of justice, who is determined to learn about Cage.<ref name=\"Missick\" /><ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /> Missick said, \"She's her own person. She's not the wife. She's not a girlfriend. She's not a sidepiece or a sidekick.\"<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /> Missick described Misty Knight as \"a person who has a very strong moral compass who is absolutely dedicated to protecting her community\", adding her proudest moment in playing the character, was the fact that she \"believes in the system, even though... [with] our current times, it's difficult to believe in the system.\"<ref name=\"MissickWhaleyCBR\" /> In the series, Knight has what Missick called a \"superpower\" referred to as 'Misty Vision' that allows her to look at a crime scene and deduce what happened.<ref name=\"MissickH&F\" />\n* [[Theo Rossi]] as [[Shades (comics)|Hernan \"Shades\" Alvarez]]: <br />A relentless, menacing, smooth and manipulative, street smart criminal working for Diamondback with ties to Cage's past.<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016Villains\" /><ref name=\"Rossi\" /><ref name=\"DoGEE112\" /> Loeb called Shades \"kind of the [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] of ''Luke Cage''\", \"the ultimate opportunist\".<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" />\n* [[Erik LaRay Harvey]] as [[Diamondback (Willis Stryker)|Willis Stryker / Diamondback]]: <br />A powerful arms dealer who is Cage's half-brother and the one who framed him for the crime that sent him to Seagate Prison.<ref name=\"Harvey\" /><ref name=\"HarveyEW\" /> Harvey talked about the character's illegitimacy, saying being  \"called a bastard his whole life... [is] what drives Willis ... He gets sent away because of his father's actions and then once he's in the jail system, he just gets tortured. After all that, his mind's been twisted and warped, and he's developed this sensitivity that's almost psychopathic.\" The character is always seen smiling when killing or defaming Cage's name, which is \"just his way of dealing with his pain. He smiles through his pain.\"<ref name=\"HarveyEW\" /> Jared Kemp portrays a teenage Stryker.\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]]: <br />A former nurse in Hell's Kitchen, whose friendship with Cage will affect both of their lives. Dawson reprises her role from the previous Marvel Netflix series.<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"Rossi\" /> \"Because she plays a nurse that basically seems to be in the right place at the right time, and she's very good at helping out superheroes who are in need, and I think you will see some of that in ''Luke Cage'',\" said Colter. \"Ultimately I think she's going to be a very good companion for Luke. I think she's someone that Luke needs in his life at this time.\"<ref name=\"ClaireTemple\" />\n* [[Alfre Woodard]] as [[Black Mariah (comics)|Mariah Dillard]]: <br />A local councilwoman and Stokes' cousin looking to bring change to Harlem, whose life is \"thrown into turmoil\" by the actions of Cage and Stokes.<ref name=\"Dillard\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /> Though Dillard is not necessarily a criminal herself, she does feel a responsibility to her family, including Stokes.<ref name=\"SDCC2016Villains\" /> Woodard, who lives in Harlem, was convinced to join the project after Coker proved his love of Harlem and its culture.<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> The series' version of the character is significantly different from the comics' Black Mariah, but Coker wanted to pay homage to her origins by using \"Black Mariah\" as a nickname. It is ultimately used by Stokes as a personal insult from their past growing up together, in retaliation to Dillard verbally attacking him.<ref name=\"BlackMariah\" /> Megan Miller portrays a young Dillard.\n* [[Gabrielle Dennis]] as [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Tilda Johnson]]: An [[Alternative medicine#Holistic therapy|holistic doctor]] and the daughter of Mariah Dillard who cannot stay out of trouble in Harlem.<ref name=\"LukeCage2Cast\" /> \n* [[Mustafa Shakir]] as [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|John McIver / Bushmaster]]: The leader of a Jamaican gang called the Stylers, who uses folk magic to gain powers almost equal to Cage's and who obsessively pursues revenge against the Stokes family.<ref name=\"LukeCage2Cast\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Series overview\n| released     = y\n| allreleased  = y\n\n| color1       = #3E290C\n| link1        = #Season 1 (2016)\n| episodes1    = 13\n| start1       = {{Start date|2016|9|30}}\n\n| color2       = #93A9A7\n| link2        = #Season 2 (2018)\n| episodes2    = 13\n| start2       = {{Start date|2018|6|22}}\n}}\n\n===Season 1 (2016)===\n{{main|Luke Cage (season 1)}}\n{{:Luke Cage (season 1)}}\n<!-- To edit the episodes in this section, you need to edit the article listed above. -->\n\n===Season 2 (2018)===\n{{main|Luke Cage (season 2)}}\n{{:Luke Cage (season 2)}}\n<!-- To edit the episodes in this section, you need to edit the article listed above. -->\n\n==Production==\n{{see also|1=Luke Cage (season 1)#Production|label 1=Production of season 1|2=Luke Cage (season 2)#Production|label 2=season 2}}\n\n===Development===\nIn May 2013, [[Marvel Studios]] reacquired the rights to [[Luke Cage]] from [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] / [[Columbia Pictures]],<ref name=\"MarvelRights\" /> after a feature film had been in development at Columbia since 2003,<ref name=\"ColumbiaFilm\" /> to no avail. By October 2013, [[Marvel Television]] was preparing four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, to present to [[video on demand]] services and cable providers, with [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Instant Video|Amazon]], and [[WGN America]] expressing interest.<ref name=\"DeadlineOct2013\" /> A few weeks later, Marvel and Disney announced that Marvel Television and [[ABC Studios]] would provide Netflix with live action series centered around Luke Cage, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Jessica Jones]], and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], leading up to a miniseries based on the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref name=\"DeadlineNov2013\" />\n\nMarvel began their search for a showrunner in 2014,<ref name=\"WiredAug2016\" /> and in late March 2015, Netflix and Marvel announced [[Cheo Hodari Coker]] in that role and revealed the title of the series to be ''Marvel's Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"Coker\" /> Coker was inspired to become the series showrunner \"when he realized the ramifications of a series about a black man with impenetrable skin and how that might empower him to take on both criminals and crooked authority figures\";<ref name=\"WiredAug2016\" /> he pitched the series to Netflix as an examination of Harlem, \"like what ''[[The Wire]]'' did for Baltimore.\"<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> Charles Murray, Alison Engel, Allie Goss, Kris Henigman, Cindy Holland, [[Alan Fine (executive)|Alan Fine]], [[Stan Lee]], [[Joe Queseda]], [[Dan Buckley]], and Jim Chory also serve as executive producers.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> The series was originally intended to be the fourth of the announced series from Netflix, debuting after ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Marvel's Iron Fist]]'', but it was fast-tracked to be the third series, after Cage was introduced in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Marvel's Jessica Jones]]'' and became a breakout star, with Marvel wanting to \"follow the momentum\".<ref name=\"OriginallyFourth\" /> In December 2016, Netflix renewed the series for a second season.<ref name=\"Season2\" />\n\n===Writing===\nCharles Murray, Kayla Cooper, and Nathan Jackson served as writers on the series.<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel3\" /> Coker noted that the majority of the series' writers are African-American, \"a rarity on television\".<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> After signing on to the series, Coker was able to read the first two scripts of both ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Marvel's Daredevil]]'' and ''Jessica Jones'', giving him an idea of the quality of writing for those series, and how important the development of their villains was.<ref name=\"CokerGQ\" /> Actor [[Mike Colter]] described the series as having \"soul\" and \"intensity\", compared to the \"dark action\" of ''Daredevil'' and the \"noir feel\" of ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"ColterDec2015\" /> Coker described \"a powerful fusion of dark drama, hip-hop, and classic superhero action\" while being \"''The Wire'' of Marvel television, because we really deal with a lot of different issues.\"<ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> Jason Tanz of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' likened the series to [[Blaxploitation|neo-blaxploitation]],<ref name=\"WiredAug2016\" /> which Coker agreed with in that \"blaxploitation is [just] black characters being able to assert themselves in a visual world\", stating that he felt the series was more specifically a \"hip-hop [[Western (genre)#Contemporary Western|Western]]\", comparing its characters and setting to [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' of films (with Cage the [[Man with No Name]], for example).<ref name=\"CokerGQ\" /> Each episode title of the series is named after a song title from hip-hop duos: the first season's from [[Gang Starr]],<ref name=\"GangStarrTitles\" /> and the second season's from [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]].<ref name=\"S2EpTitles\" />\n\nWhen asked whether the series would feel as \"adult\" as ''Jessica Jones'', Colter replied, \"if you think ''Jessica'' is adult then we're still keeping up with that pace ... we'll continue along those lines of PG-16+\".<ref name=\"MossColterJJNYCC\" /> On whether ''Luke Cage'' would address current race issues, including [[Black Lives Matter]], given the character's past (a wrongfully imprisoned black man), Colter said, \"this is not necessarily the platform to hit it head on\" but \"the things that he's going through will ring true for a lot of people in law enforcement\" and on the street.<ref name=\"ColterDec2015\" /> Loeb said on the issue, \"Luke Cage, when he came on the scene in the early 70s was for all intents and purposes the first black superhero. Given what's going on present day, it just resonates.\" Coker stated that Cage is \"someone that the community can touch and go to\", adding, \"There's never been a time in history where having a bulletproof black man\" has been so important.<ref name=\"SDCC2016EW\" /> ''Luke Cage'' was also the first MCU property to use the word \"[[nigger]]\" or \"[[nigga]]\", with Marvel having complete trust in Coker's use of it: the word is used casually in the series, though some characters, including Cage, prefer not to use it. Coker said the intent was never to use it \"in a way where it's flippant. I used it from the standpoint of, if we were going to eavesdrop on a conversation with African American people, with nobody else around, when would this word be used and how would it get used.\" Coker also likened the use in the series to \"the way music used to treat it,\" not having it be \"every other word of every other chorus, because at that point, it just gets silly.\"<ref name=\"WPBTS\" />\n\n===Casting===\nBy November 2014, [[Lance Gross]], Colter, and [[Cleo Anthony]] were in contention for the role of Luke Cage, which was envisioned as a recurring role on ''Jessica Jones'' before headlining ''Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"Casting\" /> Colter was confirmed in the role the next month, as a series regular.<ref name=\"Colter\" /> He signed on for the two series without reading any scripts.<ref name=\"NYCC2015\" /> In August 2015, [[Alfre Woodard]], who portrays [[Miriam Sharpe]] in the MCU film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'',<ref name=\"WoodardCapCW\" /> was in talks to join the cast,<ref name=\"Woodard\" /> and the following month she was confirmed as a series regular, portraying [[Black Mariah (comics)|Mariah Dillard]].<ref name=\"Dillard\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /> Also announced as cast in September were [[Theo Rossi]] as Shades,<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"Rossi\" /> [[Simone Missick]] as [[Misty Knight]],<ref name=\"Missick\" /><ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /> and [[Mahershala Ali]] as [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Stokes)|Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes]].<ref name=\"Ali\" /> In November, [[Rosario Dawson]] was confirmed to be reprising her role of [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]] from previous MCU Netflix series.<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"Rossi\" /> In March 2016, set photos revealed [[Erik LaRay Harvey]] had been cast as [[Diamondback (Willis Stryker)|Willis Stryker / Diamondback]].<ref name=\"Harvey\" /> Harvey's involvement was not officially announced by Marvel prior to the series' release, and he agreed not to do any publicity for it to not \"ruin the twist\" of Stryker being the series' main villain.<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" />\n\nColter, Missick, Rossi, Dawson, and Woodard returned for the second season.<ref name=\"LukeCage2Cast\" /> In July 2017, [[Mustafa Shakir]] and [[Gabrielle Dennis]] joined the cast, as [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|John McIver]] and [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Tilda Johnson]], respectively.<ref name=\"LukeCage2Cast\" />\n\n===Design===\nStephanie Maslansky, the costume designer for ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'', serves as costume designer for ''Luke Cage'' as well. The series sees Cage have a wardrobe evolution from his initial look of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket that was introduced in ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"Maslansky\" /> Maslansky took inspiration from the comics illustrations, as she did on the other Marvel Netflix series, but also looked to the \"rich and colorful history\" of Harlem, and Coker's own vision.<ref name=\"MaslanskyE\" /> In looking to pay homage to Cage's original costume with his updated clothing for the series, Maslansky and Coker considered \"the idea of him wearing a gold hoodie, a gold T-shirt, but those just seemed too on the nose, and just too bright for a guy who is trying to keep his identity quiet.\" Instead, Maslansky lined the insides of all of Cage's hoodies with yellow, so the color could frame the character's face in close ups.<ref name=\"MaslanskyVogue\" /> The series' title sequence, which uses yellow overtones, blends a silhouette of Luke Cage with images of Harlem.<ref name=\"TitleSequence\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming for the series takes place in New York City,<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> significantly in Harlem, where the series is set. Coker described the neighborhood as \"the only place in the city where you see those wide boulevards. We really wanted to capture the color, the rhythm of the streets\".<ref name=\"CokerTCA2016\" /> For example, the production had the opportunity to film at a barbershop in [[Greenwich Village]] \"that would've been a little easier for us to shoot in\", but Coker said \"the opportunity to film it in Harlem was irresistible. I didn't want us to talk about Harlem and then not film in Harlem.\"<ref name=\"CBRHarlem\" /> Sound stage work also takes place in New York.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> Manuel Billeter serves as director of photography for the series, after doing the same for ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"Billeter\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects for the series were completed by FuseFX,<ref name=\"FuseFX\" /> with Greg Anderson serving as visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"VarietyFX\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{further|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\nIn April 2016, Coker revealed that [[Adrian Younge]] and [[Ali Shaheed Muhammad]] were composing the series' score,<ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> describing it as \"a confluence of multiple genres, a bit of ['90s] hip-hop, soul, psychedelic rock and classical\",<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /><ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> with \"a lot of different musical appearances\".<ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> Coker had contacted Younge and Muhammad separately, asking if they would like to work together on the series, not knowing that the pair were already working together on an album.<ref name=\"LCSpin\" /> Younge and Muhammad took inspiration from [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Ennio Morricone]], and Muhammad's group [[A Tribe Called Quest]],<ref name=\"StreetLevelMusic/Film\" /> with Younge saying, \"we wanted to make something great. Not just for black people or minorities, just something great that just happens to be based on our culture.\"<ref name=\"StreetLevelMusic/Film\" /> A soundtrack album for the [[Luke Cage (soundtrack)|first season]] was released on October 7, digitally and pressed on yellow vinyl by Mondo.<ref name=\"LiveScore\" /><ref name=\"VinylRelease\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\n''Luke Cage'' is the third of the ordered Netflix series after ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'', and was followed by ''Iron Fist'', which lead to the miniseries, ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"OriginallyFourth\" /><ref name=\"DaredevilFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"CageThird\" /> In November 2013, [[Disney]] CEO [[Bob Iger]] stated that if the characters prove popular on Netflix, \"It's quite possible that they could become feature films,\"<ref name=\"VarietyTVNov2013\" /> which was echoed by Sarandos in July 2015.<ref name=\"SarandosJuly2015\" /> In August 2014, [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] in ''Daredevil'', stated that after the \"series stuff with Netflix\", Marvel has \"a bigger plan to branch out\".<ref name=\"D'OnofrioFuture\" /> In March 2015, Loeb spoke on the ability for the series to crossover with the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|MCU films]] and the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#ABC series|ABC television series]], saying, \"It all exists in the same universe. As it is now, in the same way that our films started out as self-contained and then by the time we got to ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', it became more practical for [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] to do a little crossover into ''[[Thor: The Dark World|Thor 2]]'' and for [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] to appear at the end of ''[[Iron Man 3]]''. We have to earn that. The audience needs to understand who all of these characters are and what the world is before you then start co-mingling in terms of where it's going.\"<ref name=\"LoebDigitalSpy\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n[[Disney Consumer Products]] created a small line of products to cater to a more adult audience, given the show's edgier tone. Paul Gitter, senior VP of Marvel Licensing for Disney Consumer Products explained that the focus would be more on teens and adults than very young people, with products at outlets like [[Hot Topic]].

The data, which came from Netflix's \"1,300 'taste communities' around the world, where subscribers are grouped based on what they watch\", showed that viewers would not watch the series in chronological order by release, rather starting with ''Jessica Jones'', then ''Daredevil'', ''Luke Cage'' and finally ''Iron Fist''. Todd Yellin, Netflix's vice president of product innovation, noted that audiences watch the series \"in order of how they're interested in them and how they learn about them.\" Netflix's data also showed that a viewer watching ''Luke Cage'' would most often then move on to ''Iron Fist'', with Yellin figuring that ''Jessica Jones'' and ''Luke Cage'' would have paired up more, given that Cage was introduced on ''Jessica Jones''. The data also revealed that fans of ''[[Stranger Things]]'' and other series that explore \"the dark side of society\" such as ''[[Black Mirror]]'', ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' and the documentary ''[[Amanda Knox (film)|Amanda Knox]]'' led viewers to starting ''Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"NetflixAug2017ViewingPatterns\" /> In October 2018, Crimson Hexagon, a consumer insights company, released data that examined the \"social-media buzz\" for the series to try to correlate it with potential viewership. The data showed that when the first season premiered in September 2016, the season had over 300,000 Twitter and Instagram posts regarding it, and when the second season was released in June 2018, the posts had declined dramatically to under 50,000.<ref name=\"CrimsonHexagonData\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin:10px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Critical response\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Metacritic]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#3E290C;\"|\n| [[Luke Cage (season 1)#Critical response|1]]\n| 92% (72 reviews)<ref name=\"LCS1RT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/luke_cage/s01/|title=Marvel's Luke Cage: Season 1 (2016)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=February 26, 2020}}</ref>\n| 79 (30 reviews)<ref name=\"LCS1MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-luke-cage|title=Marvel's Luke Cage : Season 1|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#93a9a7;\"|\n| [[Luke Cage (season 2)#Critical response|2]]\n| 85% (62 reviews)<ref name=\"LCS2RT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/luke_cage/s02/|title=Marvel's Luke Cage: Season 2 (2018)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=March 12, 2020}}</ref>\n| 64 (13 reviews)<ref name=\"LCS2MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-luke-cage/season-2|title=Marvel's Luke Cage : Season 2|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=June 29, 2018}}</ref>\n|}\n\nThe review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 92% approval rating with an average rating of 7.95/10 based on 72 reviews.

During the week of October 15, detailed scripts for the first half of those 10 episodes were delivered to Netflix and Marvel, incorporating ideas that had been plotted out for six months and notes received from Netflix and Marvel executives. Some of the executives had issues with these scripts, despite featuring many of the notes they asked to be included, with the creative differences devolving into \"behind-the-scenes turmoil\" by the end of the week, with some demands that a new showrunner be found for the season. With Marvel and Netflix on opposite sides of this disagreement, and the series being costly for Netflix even though they do not own the property, \"the only viable exit strategy\" was cancellation, with the series officially canceled by Netflix on October 19, 2018. ''Deadline Hollywood'' noted that, unlike fellow series ''Iron Fist'' which had been canceled a week earlier, Marvel had no plans to continue or revive the series on another platform such as [[Disney+]],<ref name=\"Cancellation\" /> especially since, per the original deal between Marvel and Netflix for the series, the characters cannot appear in any non-Netflix series or films for at least two years following the cancellation of ''Luke Cage'', as reported by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.<ref name=\"TwoYearWait\" /> [[Kevin A. Mayer]], chairman of [[Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International]], noted that, while it had not yet been discussed, it was a possibility that Disney+ could revive the series.<ref name=\"Disney+Possible\" /> In February 2019, [[Hulu]]'s senior vice president of originals Craig Erwich said that the streaming service was open to reviving the series, along with the other former Netflix series.<ref name=\"HuluInterestFeb2019\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"MarvelRights\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/marvel-cliffhanger-robert-downey-jrs-518837 |title=A Spago dinner sets the stage for Downey's epic contract talks that could lead to more \"Avengers\" and \"Iron Man 4\" \u2013 or a new Tony Stark |last1=Kit |first1=Borys |last2=Bond |first2=Paul |date=May 7, 2013 |accessdate=May 8, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GgpzZ0sH?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/marvel-cliffhanger-robert-downey-jrs-518837 |archivedate=May 17, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ColumbiaFilm\">{{cite web |url=http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-103449310/col-locks-up-cage-rights-marvel-character-screenbound |title=Col locks up 'Cage' rights: Marvel character screen-bound.

[[Marvel Comics]] [[Luke Cage|character of the same name]]. It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of the franchise]] and is the third in a [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|series of shows]] that lead to ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' crossover miniseries. The series is produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], with Coker serving as [[showrunner]].\n\n[[Mike Colter]] stars as Luke Cage, a former convict with superhuman strength and unbreakable skin who now fights crime and corruption. [[Simone Missick]], [[Theo Rossi]], [[Rosario Dawson]], and [[Alfre Woodard]] also star, with [[Mahershala Ali]] and [[Erik LaRay Harvey]] joining them for [[Luke Cage (season 1)|season one]], and [[Mustafa Shakir]] and [[Gabrielle Dennis]] joining for [[Luke Cage (season 2)|season two]]. Development of the series began in late 2013. In December 2014, Colter was cast as Cage, to appear first in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Marvel's Jessica Jones]]'', with Coker hired as the showrunner in March 2015. The series is filmed in New York City, looking to replicate the unique culture and atmosphere of [[Harlem]].\n\nAll episodes of the first season premiered on September 30, 2016. They were met with positive reviews. In December 2016, Netflix renewed ''Luke Cage'' for a second season, which was released on June 22, 2018. Following creative differences between Netflix and the series' writers during the development of a third season, Netflix canceled the series on October 19, 2018.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\nWhen a sabotaged experiment gives him super strength and unbreakable skin, [[Luke Cage]] becomes a fugitive attempting to rebuild his life in [[Harlem]] and must soon confront his past and fight a battle for the heart of his city.<ref name=\"Dillard\" /> After clearing his name, Cage becomes a hero and celebrity in Harlem, only to encounter a new threat that makes him confront the line between hero and villain.<ref name=\"S2Premiere\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Luke Cage characters}}\n<!-- Order per the series' opening credits, specifically episode 107 where all names are listed. -->\n* [[Mike Colter]] as [[Luke Cage]]: <br />Former convict Carl Lucas was given superhuman strength and unbreakable skin, and now fights crime under the name Luke Cage.<ref name=\"Colter\" /><ref name=\"NetflixPosts\" /><ref name=\"Colter2\" /><ref name=\"CarlLucas\" /> Colter portrayed the character differently in the series than he had previously in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Marvel's Jessica Jones]]'', explaining, \"You're not always the same person around everyone you know ... you might not necessarily behave the same way around your mom that you would with your wife or your boss\".<ref name=\"JJLCDiff\" /> The character uses his signature catch phrase 'Sweet Christmas' from the comics in the series,<ref name=\"ColterPhrase\" /> but sparingly, with the character often \"opting instead for pensive silence\"; composer [[Adrian Younge]] said, \"He's a black superhero, but he's a different type of black alpha male. He's not bombastic. You rarely see a modern black male character who is soulful and intelligent.\"<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> Colter put on {{convert|30|lb|kg}} of muscle for the role.<ref name=\"ColterAol\" /> David Austin and Clifton Cutrary portray a young and teenage Lucas, respectively.\n* [[Mahershala Ali]] as [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Stokes)|Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes]]: <br />The owner of the Harlem's Paradise nightclub and the cousin of Mariah Dillard who deals in illegal operations.<ref name=\"Ali\" /><ref name=\"Ali2\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016TVLine\" /> Ali described Stokes as \"a ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]''-type villain\",<ref name=\"AliGodfather\" /> while Head of [[Marvel Television]] [[Jeph Loeb]] referred to him as \"the other hero of the story\", continuing the tradition of previous [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Marvel Netflix]] villains [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] and [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]].<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /> Showrunner [[Cheo Hodari Coker]], a former music journalist, said that the attitude of rapper [[The Notorious B.I.G.|Biggie Smalls]] particularly influenced his version of Cottonmouth.<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /><ref name=\"CokerSmalls\" /> Ali took the role knowing that Stokes would die early on in the series, saying the experience \"was like shooting a film ... I found myself excited by a character's departure, because I felt like this was something I could give my all to for a period of time before saying 'peace' to him\".<ref name=\"AliEW\" /> Elijah Boothe portrays a young Stokes.\n* [[Simone Missick]] as [[Misty Knight|Mercedes \"Misty\" Knight]]: <br />A Harlem NYPD Detective with a strong sense of justice, who is determined to learn about Cage.<ref name=\"Missick\" /><ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /> Missick said, \"She's her own person. She's not the wife. She's not a girlfriend. She's not a sidepiece or a sidekick.\"<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /> Missick described Misty Knight as \"a person who has a very strong moral compass who is absolutely dedicated to protecting her community\", adding her proudest moment in playing the character, was the fact that she \"believes in the system, even though... [with] our current times, it's difficult to believe in the system.\"<ref name=\"MissickWhaleyCBR\" /> In the series, Knight has what Missick called a \"superpower\" referred to as 'Misty Vision' that allows her to look at a crime scene and deduce what happened.<ref name=\"MissickH&F\" />\n* [[Theo Rossi]] as [[Shades (comics)|Hernan \"Shades\" Alvarez]]: <br />A relentless, menacing, smooth and manipulative, street smart criminal working for Diamondback with ties to Cage's past.<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016Villains\" /><ref name=\"Rossi\" /><ref name=\"DoGEE112\" /> Loeb called Shades \"kind of the [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] of ''Luke Cage''\", \"the ultimate opportunist\".<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" />\n* [[Erik LaRay Harvey]] as [[Diamondback (Willis Stryker)|Willis Stryker / Diamondback]]: <br />A powerful arms dealer who is Cage's half-brother and the one who framed him for the crime that sent him to Seagate Prison.<ref name=\"Harvey\" /><ref name=\"HarveyEW\" /> Harvey talked about the character's illegitimacy, saying being  \"called a bastard his whole life... [is] what drives Willis ... He gets sent away because of his father's actions and then once he's in the jail system, he just gets tortured. After all that, his mind's been twisted and warped, and he's developed this sensitivity that's almost psychopathic.\" The character is always seen smiling when killing or defaming Cage's name, which is \"just his way of dealing with his pain. He smiles through his pain.\"<ref name=\"HarveyEW\" /> Jared Kemp portrays a teenage Stryker.\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]]: <br />A former nurse in Hell's Kitchen, whose friendship with Cage will affect both of their lives. Dawson reprises her role from the previous Marvel Netflix series.<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"Rossi\" /> \"Because she plays a nurse that basically seems to be in the right place at the right time, and she's very good at helping out superheroes who are in need, and I think you will see some of that in ''Luke Cage'',\" said Colter. \"Ultimately I think she's going to be a very good companion for Luke. I think she's someone that Luke needs in his life at this time.\"<ref name=\"ClaireTemple\" />\n* [[Alfre Woodard]] as [[Black Mariah (comics)|Mariah Dillard]]: <br />A local councilwoman and Stokes' cousin looking to bring change to Harlem, whose life is \"thrown into turmoil\" by the actions of Cage and Stokes.<ref name=\"Dillard\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /> Though Dillard is not necessarily a criminal herself, she does feel a responsibility to her family, including Stokes.<ref name=\"SDCC2016Villains\" /> Woodard, who lives in Harlem, was convinced to join the project after Coker proved his love of Harlem and its culture.<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> The series' version of the character is significantly different from the comics' Black Mariah, but Coker wanted to pay homage to her origins by using \"Black Mariah\" as a nickname. It is ultimately used by Stokes as a personal insult from their past growing up together, in retaliation to Dillard verbally attacking him.<ref name=\"BlackMariah\" /> Megan Miller portrays a young Dillard.\n* [[Gabrielle Dennis]] as [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Tilda Johnson]]: An [[Alternative medicine#Holistic therapy|holistic doctor]] and the daughter of Mariah Dillard who cannot stay out of trouble in Harlem.<ref name=\"LukeCage2Cast\" /> \n* [[Mustafa Shakir]] as [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|John McIver / Bushmaster]]: The leader of a Jamaican gang called the Stylers, who uses folk magic to gain powers almost equal to Cage's and who obsessively pursues revenge against the Stokes family.<ref name=\"LukeCage2Cast\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Series overview\n| released     = y\n| allreleased  = y\n\n| color1       = #3E290C\n| link1        = #Season 1 (2016)\n| episodes1    = 13\n| start1       = {{Start date|2016|9|30}}\n\n| color2       = #93A9A7\n| link2        = #Season 2 (2018)\n| episodes2    = 13\n| start2       = {{Start date|2018|6|22}}\n}}\n\n===Season 1 (2016)===\n{{main|Luke Cage (season 1)}}\n{{:Luke Cage (season 1)}}\n<!-- To edit the episodes in this section, you need to edit the article listed above. -->\n\n===Season 2 (2018)===\n{{main|Luke Cage (season 2)}}\n{{:Luke Cage (season 2)}}\n<!-- To edit the episodes in this section, you need to edit the article listed above. -->\n\n==Production==\n{{see also|1=Luke Cage (season 1)#Production|label 1=Production of season 1|2=Luke Cage (season 2)#Production|label 2=season 2}}\n\n===Development===\nIn May 2013, [[Marvel Studios]] reacquired the rights to [[Luke Cage]] from [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] / [[Columbia Pictures]],<ref name=\"MarvelRights\" /> after a feature film had been in development at Columbia since 2003,<ref name=\"ColumbiaFilm\" /> to no avail. By October 2013, [[Marvel Television]] was preparing four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, to present to [[video on demand]] services and cable providers, with [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Instant Video|Amazon]], and [[WGN America]] expressing interest.<ref name=\"DeadlineOct2013\" /> A few weeks later, Marvel and Disney announced that Marvel Television and [[ABC Studios]] would provide Netflix with live action series centered around Luke Cage, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Jessica Jones]], and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], leading up to a miniseries based on the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref name=\"DeadlineNov2013\" />\n\nMarvel began their search for a showrunner in 2014,<ref name=\"WiredAug2016\" /> and in late March 2015, Netflix and Marvel announced [[Cheo Hodari Coker]] in that role and revealed the title of the series to be ''Marvel's Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"Coker\" /> Coker was inspired to become the series showrunner \"when he realized the ramifications of a series about a black man with impenetrable skin and how that might empower him to take on both criminals and crooked authority figures\";<ref name=\"WiredAug2016\" /> he pitched the series to Netflix as an examination of Harlem, \"like what ''[[The Wire]]'' did for Baltimore.\"<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> Charles Murray, Alison Engel, Allie Goss, Kris Henigman, Cindy Holland, [[Alan Fine (executive)|Alan Fine]], [[Stan Lee]], [[Joe Queseda]], [[Dan Buckley]], and Jim Chory also serve as executive producers.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> The series was originally intended to be the fourth of the announced series from Netflix, debuting after ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Marvel's Iron Fist]]'', but it was fast-tracked to be the third series, after Cage was introduced in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Marvel's Jessica Jones]]'' and became a breakout star, with Marvel wanting to \"follow the momentum\".<ref name=\"OriginallyFourth\" /> In December 2016, Netflix renewed the series for a second season.<ref name=\"Season2\" />\n\n===Writing===\nCharles Murray, Kayla Cooper, and Nathan Jackson served as writers on the series.<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel3\" /> Coker noted that the majority of the series' writers are African-American, \"a rarity on television\".<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> After signing on to the series, Coker was able to read the first two scripts of both ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Marvel's Daredevil]]'' and ''Jessica Jones'', giving him an idea of the quality of writing for those series, and how important the development of their villains was.<ref name=\"CokerGQ\" /> Actor [[Mike Colter]] described the series as having \"soul\" and \"intensity\", compared to the \"dark action\" of ''Daredevil'' and the \"noir feel\" of ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"ColterDec2015\" /> Coker described \"a powerful fusion of dark drama, hip-hop, and classic superhero action\" while being \"''The Wire'' of Marvel television, because we really deal with a lot of different issues.\"<ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> Jason Tanz of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' likened the series to [[Blaxploitation|neo-blaxploitation]],<ref name=\"WiredAug2016\" /> which Coker agreed with in that \"blaxploitation is [just] black characters being able to assert themselves in a visual world\", stating that he felt the series was more specifically a \"hip-hop [[Western (genre)#Contemporary Western|Western]]\", comparing its characters and setting to [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' of films (with Cage the [[Man with No Name]], for example).<ref name=\"CokerGQ\" /> Each episode title of the series is named after a song title from hip-hop duos: the first season's from [[Gang Starr]],<ref name=\"GangStarrTitles\" /> and the second season's from [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]].<ref name=\"S2EpTitles\" />\n\nWhen asked whether the series would feel as \"adult\" as ''Jessica Jones'', Colter replied, \"if you think ''Jessica'' is adult then we're still keeping up with that pace ... we'll continue along those lines of PG-16+\".<ref name=\"MossColterJJNYCC\" /> On whether ''Luke Cage'' would address current race issues, including [[Black Lives Matter]], given the character's past (a wrongfully imprisoned black man), Colter said, \"this is not necessarily the platform to hit it head on\" but \"the things that he's going through will ring true for a lot of people in law enforcement\" and on the street.<ref name=\"ColterDec2015\" /> Loeb said on the issue, \"Luke Cage, when he came on the scene in the early 70s was for all intents and purposes the first black superhero. Given what's going on present day, it just resonates.\" Coker stated that Cage is \"someone that the community can touch and go to\", adding, \"There's never been a time in history where having a bulletproof black man\" has been so important.<ref name=\"SDCC2016EW\" /> ''Luke Cage'' was also the first MCU property to use the word \"[[nigger]]\" or \"[[nigga]]\", with Marvel having complete trust in Coker's use of it: the word is used casually in the series, though some characters, including Cage, prefer not to use it. Coker said the intent was never to use it \"in a way where it's flippant. I used it from the standpoint of, if we were going to eavesdrop on a conversation with African American people, with nobody else around, when would this word be used and how would it get used.\" Coker also likened the use in the series to \"the way music used to treat it,\" not having it be \"every other word of every other chorus, because at that point, it just gets silly.\"<ref name=\"WPBTS\" />\n\n===Casting===\nBy November 2014, [[Lance Gross]], Colter, and [[Cleo Anthony]] were in contention for the role of Luke Cage, which was envisioned as a recurring role on ''Jessica Jones'' before headlining ''Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"Casting\" /> Colter was confirmed in the role the next month, as a series regular.<ref name=\"Colter\" /> He signed on for the two series without reading any scripts.<ref name=\"NYCC2015\" /> In August 2015, [[Alfre Woodard]], who portrays [[Miriam Sharpe]] in the MCU film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'',<ref name=\"WoodardCapCW\" /> was in talks to join the cast,<ref name=\"Woodard\" /> and the following month she was confirmed as a series regular, portraying [[Black Mariah (comics)|Mariah Dillard]].<ref name=\"Dillard\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /> Also announced as cast in September were [[Theo Rossi]] as Shades,<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"Rossi\" /> [[Simone Missick]] as [[Misty Knight]],<ref name=\"Missick\" /><ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /> and [[Mahershala Ali]] as [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Stokes)|Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes]].<ref name=\"Ali\" /> In November, [[Rosario Dawson]] was confirmed to be reprising her role of [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]] from previous MCU Netflix series.<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"Rossi\" /> In March 2016, set photos revealed [[Erik LaRay Harvey]] had been cast as [[Diamondback (Willis Stryker)|Willis Stryker / Diamondback]].<ref name=\"Harvey\" /> Harvey's involvement was not officially announced by Marvel prior to the series' release, and he agreed not to do any publicity for it to not \"ruin the twist\" of Stryker being the series' main villain.<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" />\n\nColter, Missick, Rossi, Dawson, and Woodard returned for the second season.<ref name=\"LukeCage2Cast\" /> In July 2017, [[Mustafa Shakir]] and [[Gabrielle Dennis]] joined the cast, as [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|John McIver]] and [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Tilda Johnson]], respectively.<ref name=\"LukeCage2Cast\" />\n\n===Design===\nStephanie Maslansky, the costume designer for ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'', serves as costume designer for ''Luke Cage'' as well. The series sees Cage have a wardrobe evolution from his initial look of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket that was introduced in ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"Maslansky\" /> Maslansky took inspiration from the comics illustrations, as she did on the other Marvel Netflix series, but also looked to the \"rich and colorful history\" of Harlem, and Coker's own vision.<ref name=\"MaslanskyE\" /> In looking to pay homage to Cage's original costume with his updated clothing for the series, Maslansky and Coker considered \"the idea of him wearing a gold hoodie, a gold T-shirt, but those just seemed too on the nose, and just too bright for a guy who is trying to keep his identity quiet.\" Instead, Maslansky lined the insides of all of Cage's hoodies with yellow, so the color could frame the character's face in close ups.<ref name=\"MaslanskyVogue\" /> The series' title sequence, which uses yellow overtones, blends a silhouette of Luke Cage with images of Harlem.<ref name=\"TitleSequence\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming for the series takes place in New York City,<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> significantly in Harlem, where the series is set. Coker described the neighborhood as \"the only place in the city where you see those wide boulevards. We really wanted to capture the color, the rhythm of the streets\".<ref name=\"CokerTCA2016\" /> For example, the production had the opportunity to film at a barbershop in [[Greenwich Village]] \"that would've been a little easier for us to shoot in\", but Coker said \"the opportunity to film it in Harlem was irresistible. I didn't want us to talk about Harlem and then not film in Harlem.\"<ref name=\"CBRHarlem\" /> Sound stage work also takes place in New York.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> Manuel Billeter serves as director of photography for the series, after doing the same for ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"Billeter\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects for the series were completed by FuseFX,<ref name=\"FuseFX\" /> with Greg Anderson serving as visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"VarietyFX\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{further|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\nIn April 2016, Coker revealed that [[Adrian Younge]] and [[Ali Shaheed Muhammad]] were composing the series' score,<ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> describing it as \"a confluence of multiple genres, a bit of ['90s] hip-hop, soul, psychedelic rock and classical\",<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /><ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> with \"a lot of different musical appearances\".<ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> Coker had contacted Younge and Muhammad separately, asking if they would like to work together on the series, not knowing that the pair were already working together on an album.<ref name=\"LCSpin\" /> Younge and Muhammad took inspiration from [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Ennio Morricone]], and Muhammad's group [[A Tribe Called Quest]],<ref name=\"StreetLevelMusic/Film\" /> with Younge saying, \"we wanted to make something great. Not just for black people or minorities, just something great that just happens to be based on our culture.\"<ref name=\"StreetLevelMusic/Film\" /> A soundtrack album for the [[Luke Cage (soundtrack)|first season]] was released on October 7, digitally and pressed on yellow vinyl by Mondo.<ref name=\"LiveScore\" /><ref name=\"VinylRelease\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\n''Luke Cage'' is the third of the ordered Netflix series after ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'', and was followed by ''Iron Fist'', which lead to the miniseries, ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"OriginallyFourth\" /><ref name=\"DaredevilFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"CageThird\" /> In November 2013, [[Disney]] CEO [[Bob Iger]] stated that if the characters prove popular on Netflix, \"It's quite possible that they could become feature films,\"<ref name=\"VarietyTVNov2013\" /> which was echoed by Sarandos in July 2015.<ref name=\"SarandosJuly2015\" /> In August 2014, [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] in ''Daredevil'', stated that after the \"series stuff with Netflix\", Marvel has \"a bigger plan to branch out\".<ref name=\"D'OnofrioFuture\" /> In March 2015, Loeb spoke on the ability for the series to crossover with the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|MCU films]] and the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#ABC series|ABC television series]], saying, \"It all exists in the same universe. As it is now, in the same way that our films started out as self-contained and then by the time we got to ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', it became more practical for [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] to do a little crossover into ''[[Thor: The Dark World|Thor 2]]'' and for [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] to appear at the end of ''[[Iron Man 3]]''. We have to earn that. The audience needs to understand who all of these characters are and what the world is before you then start co-mingling in terms of where it's going.\"<ref name=\"LoebDigitalSpy\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Luke Cage'' is available on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix, in all territories where it is available,<ref name=\"Coker\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]] and [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" /> The first season was enhanced to be available in HDR after its initial release by post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref name=\"HDR\" /> The episodes of each season were released simultaneously, as opposed to a serialized format, to encourage [[binge-watching]], a format which has been successful for [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix|other Netflix original series]].<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" />\n\n===Marketing===\n[[Disney Consumer Products]] created a small line of products to cater to a more adult audience, given the show's edgier tone. Paul Gitter, senior VP of Marvel Licensing for Disney Consumer Products explained that the focus would be more on teens and adults than very young people, with products at outlets like [[Hot Topic]]. Additionally, a Marvel Knights merchandise program was created to support the series, which creates new opportunities for individual product lines and collector focused products. Licensing partners wanted to pair up with Marvel, despite this not being a film project, given its previous successes.<ref name=\"Merchandise\" />\n\n===Home media===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 8px\" colspan=\"3\"| [[DVD]] release dates\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 8px\" colspan=\"2\"| [[Blu-ray]] release dates\n|-\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[Blu-ray#A|Region A]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[Blu-ray#B|Region B]]\n|-\n!

The data, which came from Netflix's \"1,300 'taste communities' around the world, where subscribers are grouped based on what they watch\", showed that viewers would not watch the series in chronological order by release, rather starting with ''Jessica Jones'', then ''Daredevil'', ''Luke Cage'' and finally ''Iron Fist''. Todd Yellin, Netflix's vice president of product innovation, noted that audiences watch the series \"in order of how they're interested in them and how they learn about them.\" Netflix's data also showed that a viewer watching ''Luke Cage'' would most often then move on to ''Iron Fist'', with Yellin figuring that ''Jessica Jones'' and ''Luke Cage'' would have paired up more, given that Cage was introduced on ''Jessica Jones''. The data also revealed that fans of ''[[Stranger Things]]'' and other series that explore \"the dark side of society\" such as ''[[Black Mirror]]'', ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' and the documentary ''[[Amanda Knox (film)|Amanda Knox]]'' led viewers to starting ''Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"NetflixAug2017ViewingPatterns\" /> In October 2018, Crimson Hexagon, a consumer insights company, released data that examined the \"social-media buzz\" for the series to try to correlate it with potential viewership. The data showed that when the first season premiered in September 2016, the season had over 300,000 Twitter and Instagram posts regarding it, and when the second season was released in June 2018, the posts had declined dramatically to under 50,000.<ref name=\"CrimsonHexagonData\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin:10px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Critical response\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Metacritic]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#3E290C;\"|\n| [[Luke Cage (season 1)#Critical response|1]]\n| 92% (72 reviews)<ref name=\"LCS1RT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/luke_cage/s01/|title=Marvel's Luke Cage: Season 1 (2016)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=February 26, 2020}}</ref>\n| 79 (30 reviews)<ref name=\"LCS1MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-luke-cage|title=Marvel's Luke Cage : Season 1|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#93a9a7;\"|\n| [[Luke Cage (season 2)#Critical response|2]]\n| 85% (62 reviews)<ref name=\"LCS2RT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/luke_cage/s02/|title=Marvel's Luke Cage: Season 2 (2018)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=March 12, 2020}}</ref>\n| 64 (13 reviews)<ref name=\"LCS2MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-luke-cage/season-2|title=Marvel's Luke Cage : Season 2|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=June 29, 2018}}</ref>\n|}\n\nThe review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 92% approval rating with an average rating of 7.95/10 based on 72 reviews.

During the week of October 15, detailed scripts for the first half of those 10 episodes were delivered to Netflix and Marvel, incorporating ideas that had been plotted out for six months and notes received from Netflix and Marvel executives. Some of the executives had issues with these scripts, despite featuring many of the notes they asked to be included, with the creative differences devolving into \"behind-the-scenes turmoil\" by the end of the week, with some demands that a new showrunner be found for the season. With Marvel and Netflix on opposite sides of this disagreement, and the series being costly for Netflix even though they do not own the property, \"the only viable exit strategy\" was cancellation, with the series officially canceled by Netflix on October 19, 2018. ''Deadline Hollywood'' noted that, unlike fellow series ''Iron Fist'' which had been canceled a week earlier, Marvel had no plans to continue or revive the series on another platform such as [[Disney+]],<ref name=\"Cancellation\" /> especially since, per the original deal between Marvel and Netflix for the series, the characters cannot appear in any non-Netflix series or films for at least two years following the cancellation of ''Luke Cage'', as reported by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.<ref name=\"TwoYearWait\" /> [[Kevin A. Mayer]], chairman of [[Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International]], noted that, while it had not yet been discussed, it was a possibility that Disney+ could revive the series.<ref name=\"Disney+Possible\" /> In February 2019, [[Hulu]]'s senior vice president of originals Craig Erwich said that the streaming service was open to reviving the series, along with the other former Netflix series.<ref name=\"HuluInterestFeb2019\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"MarvelRights\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/marvel-cliffhanger-robert-downey-jrs-518837 |title=A Spago dinner sets the stage for Downey's epic contract talks that could lead to more \"Avengers\" and \"Iron Man 4\" \u2013 or a new Tony Stark |last1=Kit |first1=Borys |last2=Bond |first2=Paul |date=May 7, 2013 |accessdate=May 8, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GgpzZ0sH?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/marvel-cliffhanger-robert-downey-jrs-518837 |archivedate=May 17, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ColumbiaFilm\">{{cite web |url=http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-103449310/col-locks-up-cage-rights-marvel-character-screenbound |title=Col locks up 'Cage' rights: Marvel character screen-bound.

Ahmad Faraz was often compared to [[Muhammad Iqbal]] and [[Faiz Ahmed Faiz]].\n\nSingers like [[Mehdi Hasan]], [[Ghulam Ali (singer)|Ghulam Ali]], [[Jagjit Singh]] and [[Runa Laila]] greatly popularized his poetry by singing his [[ghazal]]s in films and in concerts.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n\nAhmad Faraz served as Chairman of the National Book Foundation in [[Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206192954/http://ahmadfaraztrust.org/about_faraz.html|title=AhamadFarazTrust.org|date=6 February 2016|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>\n\n===Political activity===\nFaraz was arrested for writing poems that criticised military rulers in [[Pakistan]] during the reign of General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] .  Following that arrest, he went into a self-imposed exile.<ref name=\"BBC Urdu\"/> He stayed for 6 years in Britain, Canada and Europe before returning to [[Pakistan]], where he was initially appointed as Chairman of the [[Pakistan Academy of Letters]] and later chairperson of the [[Islamabad]]-based National Book Foundation for several years. He has been awarded with numerous national and international awards. In 2006, he returned the [[Hilal-e-Imtiaz]] award he was given in 2004.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n\n[[File:The_tomb_stone_of_Ahmed_Faraz_containing_his_own_verse.jpg|thumb|Right|200px| Ahmad Faraz's tombstone]]\n\n===Death and legacy===\nEarlier in 2008, after a fall in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, there were false rumors of his death while he was being treated in a Chicago hospital. But he was able to return to his homeland, Pakistan. Then later, Ahmad Faraz died of [[kidney failure]], confirmed by his son Shibli Faraz, in a private hospital in Islamabad on 25 August 2008.

{"title_page": "Road signs in New Zealand", "text_new": "'''Road signs in New Zealand''' are similar to those set by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]]. While New Zealand is not a signatory to the convention, its [[road sign]]s are generally close in shape and function. New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

language|M\u0101ori]]: '''''Waka Kotahi''''') uses a [[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway. KMP and ERP signs are reset to zero at the beginning of each RS.\n<gallery>\nFile:Established Route Point Sign.jpg|'''ERP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 3km)\nFile:Kilometre Marker Post Sign.jpg|'''KMP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 1km)\nFile:Route Station Marker Sign.jpg|'''RS Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 591)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Speed limits in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Traffic signs}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Road signs by country|New Zealand]]\n", "text_old": "'''Road signs in New Zealand''' are similar to those set by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]]. While New Zealand is not a signatory to the convention, its [[road sign]]s are generally close in shape and function. New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

language|M\u0101ori]]: '''''Waka Kotahi''''') uses a [[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway. KMP and ERP signs are reset to zero at the beginning of each RS.\n<gallery>\nFile:Established Route Point Sign.jpg|'''ERP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 3km)\nFile:Kilometre Marker Post Sign.jpg|'''KMP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 1km)\nFile:Route Station Marker Sign.jpg|'''RS Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 591)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Speed limits in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Traffic signs}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Road signs by country|New Zealand]]\n", "name_user": "Fry1989", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File renamed:File:New Zealand road sign R1-8.1 (obsolete).svg\u2192File:New Zealand road sign R1-8.1 (1987\u20132016).svgCorrect file name to add years of use.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_New_Zealand"}

The village is a city now known as [[Tallassee, Alabama]], which Is located on the banks of the Tallapoosa River about twenty miles upstream from Fort Toulouse where the Tallapoosa and the Coosa Rivers meet to form the Alabama River. The inhabitants of the original Talisi village and of the current city of Tallassee were a mixture of all races. The Creek were among the Southeastern Native Americans who held slaves.

In 1832, a few Seminole chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Payne's Landing]], by which they agreed to give up their Florida lands in exchange for lands west of the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Indian Territory]].

In retaliation, the US Indian agent, [[Wiley Thompson]], declared that those chiefs were deposed from their positions. As US relations with the Seminole deteriorated, Thompson forbade the sale of guns and ammunition to them. Osceola, a young warrior rising to prominence, resented this ban. He felt it equated the Seminole with [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]], who were forbidden by law to carry arms.<ref>Hatch 2012, pp. 82\u201385</ref>\n\nThompson considered Osceola to be a friend and gave him a rifle. Osceola had a habit of barging into Thompson's office and shouting complaints at him. On one occasion Osceola quarreled with Thompson, who had the warrior locked up at [[Fort King]] for two nights until he agreed to be more respectful. In order to secure his release, Osceola agreed to sign the Treaty of Payne's Landing and to bring his followers into the fort. After his humiliating imprisonment, Osceola secretly prepared vengeance against Thompson.<ref>Hatch 2012, p. 90</ref>\n\nOn December 28, 1835, Osceola, with the same rifle Thompson gave him, killed the Indian agent. Osceola and his followers shot six others outside Fort King, while another group of Seminole ambushed and killed a column of US Army, more than 100 troops, who were marching from [[Fort Brooke]] to Fort King. Americans called this event the [[Dade Massacre]]. These nearly simultaneous attacks catalyzed the [[Second Seminole War]] with the United States.<ref>Mishall, John and Mary Lou Mishall. 2004.

Of mixed parentage, including [[Muscogee people|Creek]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[African American]], and English, he was considered born to his mother's people in the Creek [[matrilineal]] [[kinship]] system. He was reared by her in the Creek tradition. When he was a child, they migrated to Florida with other [[Red Stick]] refugees after their group's defeat in 1814 in the [[Creek Wars]]. There they became part of what was known as the Seminole people.\n\nIn 1836, Osceola led a small group of warriors in the Seminole resistance during the [[Second Seminole War]], when the United States tried to [[Indian Removal|remove]] the tribe from their lands in [[Florida Territory|Florida]] to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. He became an adviser to [[Micanopy]], the principal chief of the Seminole from 1825 to 1849.<ref name=myths>[http://tfn.net/~cdk901/osceola.htm \"Osceola, the Man and the Myths\"], retrieved January 11, 2007  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061202105713/http://tfn.net/~cdk901/osceola.htm |date=December 2, 2006 }}</ref> Osceola led the Seminole resistance to [[Indian Removal|removal]] until he was captured on October 21, 1837, by deception, under a flag of truce,<ref>Mahon, John K.

The village is a city now known as [[Tallassee, Alabama]], which Is located on the banks of the Tallapoosa River about twenty miles upstream from Fort Toulouse where the Tallapoosa and the Coosa Rivers meet to form the Alabama River. The inhabitants of the original Talisi village and of the current city of Tallassee were a mixture of all races. The Creek were among the Southeastern Native Americans who held slaves.

With them, he had at least five children.

In 1832, a few Seminole chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Payne's Landing]], by which they agreed to give up their Florida lands in exchange for lands west of the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Indian Territory]]. According to legend, Osceola stabbed the treaty with his knife, although there are no contemporary reports of this.<ref>Hatch 2012, pp. 87\u201389</ref> Donald L. Fixico, an American Indian historian, says he made a research trip to the National Archives to see the original Treaty of Fort Gibson (also known as the [[Treaty of Payne's Landing]]), and that upon close inspection, he observed that it had \"a small triangular hole shaped like the point of a knife blade\".<ref name=\"Fixico2017\">{{cite book|author=Donald L.

In retaliation, the US Indian agent, [[Wiley Thompson]], declared that those chiefs were deposed from their positions. As US relations with the Seminole deteriorated, Thompson forbade the sale of guns and ammunition to them. Osceola, a young warrior rising to prominence, resented this ban. He felt it equated the Seminole with [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]], who were forbidden by law to carry arms.<ref>Hatch 2012, pp. 82\u201385</ref>\n\nThompson considered Osceola to be a friend and gave him a rifle. Osceola had a habit of barging into Thompson's office and shouting complaints at him. On one occasion Osceola quarreled with Thompson, who had the warrior locked up at [[Fort King]] for two nights until he agreed to be more respectful. In order to secure his release, Osceola agreed to sign the Treaty of Payne's Landing and to bring his followers into the fort. After his humiliating imprisonment, Osceola secretly prepared vengeance against Thompson.<ref>Hatch 2012, p. 90</ref>\n\nOn December 28, 1835, Osceola, with the same rifle Thompson gave him, killed the Indian agent. Osceola and his followers shot six others outside Fort King, while another group of Seminole ambushed and killed a column of US Army, more than 100 troops, who were marching from [[Fort Brooke]] to Fort King. Americans called this event the [[Dade Massacre]]. These nearly simultaneous attacks catalyzed the [[Second Seminole War]] with the United States.<ref>Mishall, John and Mary Lou Mishall. 2004.

There's a lot to mine from in her backstory and in her present day situation\".<ref name=\"WrapS2Jan2016\" /> Actress [[Krysten Ritter]] said that the second season would evolve from the first, and that for Jones, \"The first season was in her head and the second season is in her heart,\"<ref name=\"RitterAug2017\" /> adding that Jones \"is in a pretty dark headspace\" at the beginning of the season and that the season would be \"more of an emotional thriller this time.\"<ref name=\"EWDec2017\" /> On whether Tennant could return for the second season, Rosenberg said, \"Sure, when you have David Tennant, you want him around forever....But the show is called ''Jessica Jones'' and the story is about Jessica's arc and how does that play out in its best form?\" It was noted that Kilgrave would be \"hard to top\", though, with [[Marvel Television]] head [[Jeph Loeb]] saying, \"One of the things that's important about any Marvel show is your hero is often defined by how strong your antagonist is,\"<ref name=\"TennantReturn?\" /> with Rosenberg adding that the objective for the new villain, or villains, for the season would be not to match or do what was done with Kilgrave.<ref name=\"TCAAug2016\" /><ref name=\"RosenbergAug2016\" /> As Kilgrave does appear in the season, Rosenberg felt it was important to have him return to \"be that mirror again\" for Jones, as he is \"such a part of her construction and her dilemma\".<ref name=\"EWDec2017\" />\n\nRosenberg also hoped to \"further expand on the ensemble and on Jessica's world\" by giving more screen time to supporting characters,<ref name=\"RosenbergSecondSeason\" /><ref name=\"RosenbergNerdistMay2016\" /> noting that in the first season, \"the trick of a show that's called ''Jessica Jones'' [is if] she's not in the scene, it's not a guarantee that scene will end up in the final picture. You have to earn secondary character stories. You have to flesh them out enough so that they can eventually carry stories of their own\" in future seasons.<ref name=\"RosenbergNerdistMay2016\" /> She also wanted to continue to explore the relationship between Jones and [[Patsy Walker|Trish Walker]], stating \"That is the core relationship in the piece. It is about female friendship, it is about how friends evolve\u2014they're sisters, really\u2014and it's about how they evolve and ping off each other.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergAug2016\"/> On Jones becoming famous after her heroics in the first season, Ritter said, \"She keeps her circle small because she doesn't want people in her life, so there's no textbook on how to deal with new popularity or new eyes on you.\"<ref name=\"RitterAug2017\"/> Speaking on the social issues she hoped to tackle in the season, after covering \"issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [and] issues of consent\" while also exploring \"feminism and being a woman in this world\" in the first, Rosenberg said, \"I'm not quite sure yet what the social issues are that we're dealing with [in season 2]. We're just trying to find some resonance for [Jessica Jones] and a new place to push her, to give Krysten something new to play and really push the boundaries of the character.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergAug2016\"/> \n\nAfter much of the first season was taken from the ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' comic book, Rosenberg wanted to continue that trend with the second season, but acknowledged that \"the MCU is very different from the comics in terms of its mythology. In the books there were things building towards \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\" and all that, and here that's not the case. The nature of that is we're probably not going to be able to continue to do parallel storylines [to ''Alias'']\".<ref name=\"WrapS2Jan2016\"/> On having Jones continue to struggle with the same issues in the second season, Loeb said, \"The end of the [first season]\u2014and it was one of the things that was very important when we talked about the end of the first [season]\u2014was that it wasn't, 'Ooh, I triumphed and now I can get in my hovercar and join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].' That wasn't the story we were interested in telling.\"<ref name=\"LoebIGNJan2016\"/> Rosenberg elaborated by comparing the ''Jessica Jones'' to her previous series ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', saying that she learned \"you can advance the character, but you never want to cure the character. With [[Dexter Morgan|Dexter]], the moment he felt guilt or accepted that he was 'bad,' the show's over. He's no longer a sociopath. The equivalent for us would be if Jessica somehow recovered from the damage that had been done to her. People don't just heal\".<ref name=\"RosenbergSept2016\"/> She added that Jones' killing of Kilgrave at the end of the first season was \"a life changing experience\" and something that would affect the character going forward.<ref name=\"RosenbergNerdistMay2016\"/> Rosenberg also stated that the season would be \"about digging deeper into this chaos and peeling back those layers [of Jones' life], just going to the core of her being\" after the first season focused on Jones' trauma and facing her abuser.<ref name=\"EWDec2017\" />\n\n===Casting===\nAfter the season was ordered, several main cast members revealed that they would return for the second season, including Ritter as Jessica Jones,<ref name=\"Ritter\" /> [[Rachael Taylor]] as Patricia \"Trish\" Walker,<ref name=\"Taylor\" /><ref name=\"TaylorReturn\" /> and [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]].<ref name=\"Moss\" /><ref name=\"MossReturn\" /> [[Eka Darville]] also reprises his role as Malcolm Ducasse.<ref name=\"DarvilleReturn\" /> In March 2017, [[J. R. Ramirez]] was cast as Oscar Arocho, which was revealed in July after the airing of his character's death on ''[[Power (TV series)|Power]]''.<ref name=\"Ramirez\" /><ref name=\"Ramirez2\" /> In April 2017, [[Janet McTeer]] was cast in an undisclosed role, described as someone who has \"an enormous impact on Jessica's life.\"<ref name=\"McTeerCast\" /> She was revealed to be playing [[Mrs. Campbell (comics)|Alisa Jones]], Jessica's mother,<ref name=\"McTeerRole\" /> who was briefly portrayed in flashbacks by [[Miriam Shor]] in the first season.<ref name=\"ShorAlisa\" /> By July, [[Leah Gibson]] had also joined the cast,<ref name=\"Gibson\" /> in the role of Inez Green.<ref name=\"InezGreen\" /> Also joining in the season is [[Terry Chen]] as Pryce Cheng.<ref name=\"Chen\" />\n\nIn August 2017, [[David Tennant]] was confirmed to be reprising his role as [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]],<ref name=\"Tennant\" /> appearing as a hallucination,<ref name=\"TennantHallucination\" /> with [[Wil Traval]] also returning as [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Will Simpson]].<ref name=\"TravalS2\" /> Recurring characters in the season include [[Rebecca De Mornay]] reprises her role as Dorothy Walker,<ref name=\"DigitalSpyReview\" /> Kevin Chacon as Vido Arocho<ref name=\"ColliderEasterEggs\" /> and [[Callum Keith Rennie]] as [[Karl Malus]].<ref name=\"McTeerRole\" /> [[Elden Henson]] and [[Rob Morgan (actor)|Rob Morgan]] reprise their roles as [[Foggy Nelson]] and [[Turk Barrett]] from previous Marvel Netflix series, respectively.<ref name=\"Henson\" /><ref name=\"Morgan\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began the week of April 3, 2017 in New York City, once again using the [[working title]] ''Violet''.<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> This followed the end of production on ''The Defenders'' in March,<ref name=\"DefendersFinished\" /> with Ritter having indicated in May 2016 that the season would film [[Back to back film production|back-to-back]] with ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"BackToBackFilming\" /> Filming occurred at the [[Long Island Aquarium and Exhibition Center]].<ref name=\"LIAquarium\" /> Filming for the season wrapped on September 14, 2017.<ref name=\"FilmingWrap\" />\n\nApproaching the second season, Rosenberg wanted to increase the number of female directors working on the series as a further push for representation. This was a goal that \"Marvel was completely on board with\", and given the demand of many talented female directors at the time, the series' producers looked to book only female directors first, and approach male directors later in the pre-production phase if needed. Another member of the production suggested that the series book only female directors for the season, which Rosenberg \"hadn't contemplated [as a] concept prior to that conversation\". She quickly made that the goal of the production, and in October 2016, Rosenberg confirmed that all 13 episodes of the season would be directed by women.<ref name=\"FemaleDirectors\" /> Oscar's paintings in the season were created by comic book artist [[David W.

She felt \"[t]he season really starts to kick into gear.. once we\u2019re introduced to the central mystery: the truth behind IGH,\" with the season getting \"better and better as it goes along.\" However, as with previous Marvel Netflix series, the season suffered from pacing issues, featuring \"a minimal or non-existent score, scenes that go on for too long, and a limited number of edits that add up to everything feeling like it\u2019s happening in real time. It\u2019s not as bad as any other Marvel series on Netflix in this regard \u2014 not even close \u2014 but it\u2019s still a problem, and one that has unbelievably still not been addressed in terms of episode count (or shorter runtimes within episodes).\" Keene also felt the season missed a \"driving force\" by not having David Tennant back as Kilgrave, but was glad the season largely ignored the events of ''The Defenders'' to focus on Jones and her relationships.<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" /> Awarding the season a \"B\", Liz Shannon Miller from [[IndieWire]] said the season's all-female directors kept \"the show\u2019s noir bent in place though doesn\u2019t push too hard into the realm of art \u2014 but the clean approach works, as does Ritter\u2019s always grounded and believable performance.\" She also enjoyed the Hogarth medical storyline, saying it was \"one of the most compelling new storylines\", despite it not connecting to the overall larger narrative through the first five episodes. For Miller, Janet McTeer was \"the most dynamic element of these early episodes. While she has potential as a foil, there\u2019s not enough of her to keep us hooked, not to mention the lack of the emotional hook that we had with Kilgrave in season 1.\" Miller also felt the plot lacked direction, and agreed with Keene about the pacing issues.<ref name=\"IndieWireReview\" />\n\n''[[Digital Spy]]''{{'}}s Jo Berry said in her review, \"While the beginning of the new season lacks the focus of the first, and is missing a truly menacing bad guy for Jessica to go up against, the new additions and expanded storylines don't detract from Ritter's powerhouse performance... Pacing quibbles aside, this is a darkly enjoyable return for Jessica Jones, thanks to the strong scripts, slick direction and Ritter's gripping performance.\"<ref name=\"DigitalSpyReview\" /> In a more mixed review, ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s David Betancourt noted the season \"lacks shock value\". While Ritter \"still brings her A-game... It\u2019s the lack of Kilgrave that at first seems to be what\u2019s missing from season 2.\" He did praise the supporting cast, feeling Darville \"has a standout performance\" as Malcolm, with his connection to the larger storyline \"surprising and enjoyable to watch\", and also praising Taylor, adding it \"wouldn\u2019t hurt to bring [Taylor] in\" as her comics alter ego Hellcat, to help the season that \"lags at the beginning\".<ref name=\"WashingtonPostReview\" />\n\nConversely, Susana Polo from ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' was left disappointed and bored by the early episodes, also noting the lack of compelling antagonist for the season. She said, \"I don\u2019t see ''Jessica Jones''{{'}} second season winning over anyone who was lukewarm about her first \u2014 or anyone who skipped it entirely. I\u2019m a big fan, and even I left these first five episodes wondering exactly what had happened to the series that gripped me and never let go in 2015.\"<ref name=\"PolygonReview\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"SarandosMultipleSeasons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/daredevil_bloodline_kimmy_schmidt_premiere_date_netflix-2015-01 |title=Netflix announces 'Daredevil,' 'Bloodline,' 'Kimmy Schmidt' premiere dates |last=Schwartz |first=Terri |publisher=[[Zap2It]] |date=January 7, 2015 |accessdate=January 10, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VTyOGUNY?url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/daredevil_bloodline_kimmy_schmidt_premiere_date_netflix-2015-01 |archivedate=January 10, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SarandosJuly2015\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/28/netflix-on-marvel-series-release-plan-and-if-punisher-could-get-a-spinoff |title=Netflix On Marvel Series Release Plan And If Punisher Could Get A Spinoff |last=Goldman |first=Eric |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=July 28, 2015 |accessdate=July 28, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aMsAdcZ1?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/28/netflix-on-marvel-series-release-plan-and-if-punisher-could-get-a-spinoff |archivedate=July 28, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\">{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/jessica-jones-krysten-ritter-melissa-rosenberg-interview-nycc/ |title=Krysten Ritter & Showrunner Melissa Rosenberg Talk 'Jessica Jones' at NYCC |last=Weintraub |first=Steve |publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date=October 12, 2015 |accessdate=October 15, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cHchpv7S?url=http://collider.com/jessica-jones-krysten-ritter-melissa-rosenberg-interview-nycc/ |archivedate=October 14, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"RosenbergVarietyNov2015\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/features/jessica-jones-marvel-melissa-rosenberg-1201644912/ |title='Jessica Jones' Showrunner Melissa Rosenberg Talks About Her Tough Heroine |last=Ryan |first=Maureen |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 20, 2015 |accessdate=November 21, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dD7rxT4f?url=http://variety.com/2015/tv/features/jessica-jones-marvel-melissa-rosenberg-1201644912/ |archivedate=November 21, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"RosenbergSecondSeason\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/11/jessica-jones-spoilers-marvel-melissa-rosenberg-krysten-ritter-luke-cage-1201628832/ |title='Marvel's Jessica Jones' EP Melissa Rosenberg On Luke Cage, Season 2, 'Supergirl' & Gender Parity In Hollywood |last=Patten |first=Dominic |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=November 18, 2015 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6d9BxvVEQ?url=http://deadline.com/2015/11/jessica-jones-spoilers-marvel-melissa-rosenberg-krysten-ritter-luke-cage-1201628832/ |archivedate=November 19, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"S2Order\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/jessica-jones-season-2-netflix-krysten-ritter-mike-colter-luke-cage-1201666573/ |title='Jessica Jones' Renewed for Season 2 on Netflix |last=Friedlander |first=Whitney |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=January 17, 2016 |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ebvyYfnL?url=http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/jessica-jones-season-2-netflix-krysten-ritter-mike-colter-luke-cage-1201666573/ |archivedate=January 17, 2016 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"TennantReturn?\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/731416/do-jessica-jones-and-luke-cage-have-a-future-krysten-ritter-hopes-so |title=Do Jessica Jones and Luke Cage Have a Future?

One of Kozlov's army patients believes that Simpson is behind this, and Jones suspects that he also killed Coleman. Walker asks Malcolm Ducasse, Jones's neighbor and work partner, to help her rather than further involve the reluctant Jones. Walker confronts Maximilian Tatum, a director, about the sexual relationship they had when she was a child actress working for him, threatening to publicly reveal this unless he helps her get access to records at a hospital he has influence over. After Tatum refuses, Walker runs into Simpson. Jones also arrives, having tracked Walker down when she did not answer her phone.

Hansen was a doctor at the hospital where Jones was taken following the accident that killed her family. Jones and Walker find Hansen's apartment empty, and a charred human head in the basement. Walker uses her radio show to ask the public for information on Hansen, and receives a call from a woman claiming to be Hansen.

Ryback is released from prison, and attempts to heal Hogarth, but cannot promise that it will work. During a live broadcast of her radio show, Trish, under the influence of the IGH drug, rails against the superficiality of her show's programming and quits. She is offered a desirable job on television, but realizes that she has run out of the drug. Arocho, whose relationship with Jessica has become less hostile and more romantic, comes to Jessica when his ex-wife kidnaps their son Vido.

Jessica explains everything to Trish and Ducasse, but tells them to stay away. She finds Malus and convinces him to go to a country with no extradition so Alisa can talk about him without fear of him being caught. He first waits for a new passport provided by Arocho, and also tells Jessica that he never treated Ryback. Hogarth does not believe Jessica when she says this, but arrives home to find Green and Ryback have robbed her (and thus realizes she was not cured).

Jessica berates Ducasse for not trusting her, and for taking advantage of their working relationship. They both agree that he should no longer work for her. Malus takes Trish to the old IGH facility, where he begins to put her through the same process that changed Jessica and Alisa. Jessica arrives and stops the procedure, and then is almost convinced by her hallucination of Kilgrave to murder Malus. She stops herself, but he decides to end his own life.

They then go to the nearby amusement park Playland, where Alisa decides to wait until the police arrive. Trish sees a news report on the traffic accident and talks to Costa about the road blocks.

There's a lot to mine from in her backstory and in her present day situation\".<ref name=\"WrapS2Jan2016\" /> Actress [[Krysten Ritter]] said that the second season would evolve from the first, and that for Jones, \"The first season was in her head and the second season is in her heart,\"<ref name=\"RitterAug2017\" /> adding that Jones \"is in a pretty dark headspace\" at the beginning of the season and that the season would be \"more of an emotional thriller this time.\"<ref name=\"EWDec2017\" /> On whether Tennant could return for the second season, Rosenberg said, \"Sure, when you have David Tennant, you want him around forever....But the show is called ''Jessica Jones'' and the story is about Jessica's arc and how does that play out in its best form?\" It was noted that Kilgrave would be \"hard to top\", though, with [[Marvel Television]] head [[Jeph Loeb]] saying, \"One of the things that's important about any Marvel show is your hero is often defined by how strong your antagonist is,\"<ref name=\"TennantReturn?\" /> with Rosenberg adding that the objective for the new villain, or villains, for the season would be not to match or do what was done with Kilgrave.<ref name=\"TCAAug2016\" /><ref name=\"RosenbergAug2016\" /> As Kilgrave does appear in the season, Rosenberg felt it was important to have him return to \"be that mirror again\" for Jones, as he is \"such a part of her construction and her dilemma\".<ref name=\"EWDec2017\" />\n\nRosenberg also hoped to \"further expand on the ensemble and on Jessica's world\" by giving more screen time to supporting characters,<ref name=\"RosenbergSecondSeason\" /><ref name=\"RosenbergNerdistMay2016\" /> noting that in the first season, \"the trick of a show that's called ''Jessica Jones'' [is if] she's not in the scene, it's not a guarantee that scene will end up in the final picture. You have to earn secondary character stories. You have to flesh them out enough so that they can eventually carry stories of their own\" in future seasons.<ref name=\"RosenbergNerdistMay2016\" /> She also wanted to continue to explore the relationship between Jones and [[Patsy Walker|Trish Walker]], stating \"That is the core relationship in the piece. It is about female friendship, it is about how friends evolve\u2014they're sisters, really\u2014and it's about how they evolve and ping off each other.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergAug2016\"/> On Jones becoming famous after her heroics in the first season, Ritter said, \"She keeps her circle small because she doesn't want people in her life, so there's no textbook on how to deal with new popularity or new eyes on you.\"<ref name=\"RitterAug2017\"/> Speaking on the social issues she hoped to tackle in the season, after covering \"issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [and] issues of consent\" while also exploring \"feminism and being a woman in this world\" in the first, Rosenberg said, \"I'm not quite sure yet what the social issues are that we're dealing with [in season 2]. We're just trying to find some resonance for [Jessica Jones] and a new place to push her, to give Krysten something new to play and really push the boundaries of the character.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergAug2016\"/> \n\nAfter much of the first season was taken from the ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' comic book, Rosenberg wanted to continue that trend with the second season, but acknowledged that \"the MCU is very different from the comics in terms of its mythology. In the books there were things building towards \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\" and all that, and here that's not the case. The nature of that is we're probably not going to be able to continue to do parallel storylines [to ''Alias'']\".<ref name=\"WrapS2Jan2016\"/> On having Jones continue to struggle with the same issues in the second season, Loeb said, \"The end of the [first season]\u2014and it was one of the things that was very important when we talked about the end of the first [season]\u2014was that it wasn't, 'Ooh, I triumphed and now I can get in my hovercar and join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].' That wasn't the story we were interested in telling.\"<ref name=\"LoebIGNJan2016\"/> Rosenberg elaborated by comparing the ''Jessica Jones'' to her previous series ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', saying that she learned \"you can advance the character, but you never want to cure the character. With [[Dexter Morgan|Dexter]], the moment he felt guilt or accepted that he was 'bad,' the show's over. He's no longer a sociopath. The equivalent for us would be if Jessica somehow recovered from the damage that had been done to her. People don't just heal\".<ref name=\"RosenbergSept2016\"/> She added that Jones' killing of Kilgrave at the end of the first season was \"a life changing experience\" and something that would affect the character going forward.<ref name=\"RosenbergNerdistMay2016\"/> Rosenberg also stated that the season would be \"about digging deeper into this chaos and peeling back those layers [of Jones' life], just going to the core of her being\" after the first season focused on Jones' trauma and facing her abuser.<ref name=\"EWDec2017\" />\n\n===Casting===\nAfter the season was ordered, several main cast members revealed that they would return for the second season, including Ritter as Jessica Jones,<ref name=\"Ritter\" /> [[Rachael Taylor]] as Patricia \"Trish\" Walker,<ref name=\"Taylor\" /><ref name=\"TaylorReturn\" /> and [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]].<ref name=\"Moss\" /><ref name=\"MossReturn\" /> [[Eka Darville]] also reprises his role as Malcolm Ducasse.<ref name=\"DarvilleReturn\" /> In March 2017, [[J. R. Ramirez]] was cast as Oscar Arocho, which was revealed in July after the airing of his character's death on ''[[Power (TV series)|Power]]''.<ref name=\"Ramirez\" /><ref name=\"Ramirez2\" /> In April 2017, [[Janet McTeer]] was cast in an undisclosed role, described as someone who has \"an enormous impact on Jessica's life.\"<ref name=\"McTeerCast\" /> She was revealed to be playing [[Mrs. Campbell (comics)|Alisa Jones]], Jessica's mother,<ref name=\"McTeerRole\" /> who was briefly portrayed in flashbacks by [[Miriam Shor]] in the first season.<ref name=\"ShorAlisa\" /> By July, [[Leah Gibson]] had also joined the cast,<ref name=\"Gibson\" /> in the role of Inez Green.<ref name=\"InezGreen\" /> Also joining in the season is [[Terry Chen]] as Pryce Cheng.<ref name=\"Chen\" />\n\nIn August 2017, [[David Tennant]] was confirmed to be reprising his role as [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]],<ref name=\"Tennant\" /> appearing as a hallucination,<ref name=\"TennantHallucination\" /> with [[Wil Traval]] also returning as [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Will Simpson]].<ref name=\"TravalS2\" /> Recurring characters in the season include [[Rebecca De Mornay]] reprises her role as Dorothy Walker,<ref name=\"DigitalSpyReview\" /> Kevin Chacon as Vido Arocho<ref name=\"ColliderEasterEggs\" /> and [[Callum Keith Rennie]] as [[Karl Malus]].<ref name=\"McTeerRole\" /> [[Elden Henson]] and [[Rob Morgan (actor)|Rob Morgan]] reprise their roles as [[Foggy Nelson]] and [[Turk Barrett]] from previous Marvel Netflix series, respectively.<ref name=\"Henson\" /><ref name=\"Morgan\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began the week of April 3, 2017 in New York City, once again using the [[working title]] ''Violet''.<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> This followed the end of production on ''The Defenders'' in March,<ref name=\"DefendersFinished\" /> with Ritter having indicated in May 2016 that the season would film [[Back to back film production|back-to-back]] with ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"BackToBackFilming\" /> Filming occurred at the [[Long Island Aquarium and Exhibition Center]].<ref name=\"LIAquarium\" /> Filming for the season wrapped on September 14, 2017.<ref name=\"FilmingWrap\" />\n\nApproaching the second season, Rosenberg wanted to increase the number of female directors working on the series as a further push for representation. This was a goal that \"Marvel was completely on board with\", and given the demand of many talented female directors at the time, the series' producers looked to book only female directors first, and approach male directors later in the pre-production phase if needed. Another member of the production suggested that the series book only female directors for the season, which Rosenberg \"hadn't contemplated [as a] concept prior to that conversation\". She quickly made that the goal of the production, and in October 2016, Rosenberg confirmed that all 13 episodes of the season would be directed by women.<ref name=\"FemaleDirectors\" /> Oscar's paintings in the season were created by comic book artist [[David W.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"While ''Jessica Jones'' is a slower burn with less focus than its inaugural season, its enticing new character arc more fully details the most charismatic Defender.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/jessica_jones/s02|title=Marvel's Jessica Jones: Season 2 (2018)|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned the season a score of 70 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref name=\"JJMC2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-jessica-jones/season-2|title=Marvel's Jessica Jones: Season 2 Reviews|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=March 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn her review of the first five episodes of the season, Allison Keene of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] gave the season 4 out of 5 stars. She felt \"[t]he season really starts to kick into gear.. once we\u2019re introduced to the central mystery: the truth behind IGH,\" with the season getting \"better and better as it goes along.\" However, as with previous Marvel Netflix series, the season suffered from pacing issues, featuring \"a minimal or non-existent score, scenes that go on for too long, and a limited number of edits that add up to everything feeling like it\u2019s happening in real time. It\u2019s not as bad as any other Marvel series on Netflix in this regard \u2014 not even close \u2014 but it\u2019s still a problem, and one that has unbelievably still not been addressed in terms of episode count (or shorter runtimes within episodes).\" Keene also felt the season missed a \"driving force\" by not having David Tennant back as Kilgrave, but was glad the season largely ignored the events of ''The Defenders'' to focus on Jones and her relationships.<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" /> Awarding the season a \"B\", Liz Shannon Miller from [[IndieWire]] said the season's all-female directors kept \"the show\u2019s noir bent in place though doesn\u2019t push too hard into the realm of art \u2014 but the clean approach works, as does Ritter\u2019s always grounded and believable performance.\" She also enjoyed the Hogarth medical storyline, saying it was \"one of the most compelling new storylines\", despite it not connecting to the overall larger narrative through the first five episodes. For Miller, Janet McTeer was \"the most dynamic element of these early episodes. While she has potential as a foil, there\u2019s not enough of her to keep us hooked, not to mention the lack of the emotional hook that we had with Kilgrave in season 1.\" Miller also felt the plot lacked direction, and agreed with Keene about the pacing issues.<ref name=\"IndieWireReview\" />\n\n''[[Digital Spy]]''{{'}}s Jo Berry said in her review, \"While the beginning of the new season lacks the focus of the first, and is missing a truly menacing bad guy for Jessica to go up against, the new additions and expanded storylines don't detract from Ritter's powerhouse performance... Pacing quibbles aside, this is a darkly enjoyable return for Jessica Jones, thanks to the strong scripts, slick direction and Ritter's gripping performance.\"<ref name=\"DigitalSpyReview\" /> In a more mixed review, ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s David Betancourt noted the season \"lacks shock value\". While Ritter \"still brings her A-game... It\u2019s the lack of Kilgrave that at first seems to be what\u2019s missing from season 2.\" He did praise the supporting cast, feeling Darville \"has a standout performance\" as Malcolm, with his connection to the larger storyline \"surprising and enjoyable to watch\", and also praising Taylor, adding it \"wouldn\u2019t hurt to bring [Taylor] in\" as her comics alter ego Hellcat, to help the season that \"lags at the beginning\".<ref name=\"WashingtonPostReview\" />\n\nConversely, Susana Polo from ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' was left disappointed and bored by the early episodes, also noting the lack of compelling antagonist for the season. She said, \"I don\u2019t see ''Jessica Jones''{{'}} second season winning over anyone who was lukewarm about her first \u2014 or anyone who skipped it entirely. I\u2019m a big fan, and even I left these first five episodes wondering exactly what had happened to the series that gripped me and never let go in 2015.\"<ref name=\"PolygonReview\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"SarandosMultipleSeasons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/daredevil_bloodline_kimmy_schmidt_premiere_date_netflix-2015-01 |title=Netflix announces 'Daredevil,' 'Bloodline,' 'Kimmy Schmidt' premiere dates |last=Schwartz |first=Terri |publisher=[[Zap2It]] |date=January 7, 2015 |accessdate=January 10, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VTyOGUNY?url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/daredevil_bloodline_kimmy_schmidt_premiere_date_netflix-2015-01 |archivedate=January 10, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SarandosJuly2015\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/28/netflix-on-marvel-series-release-plan-and-if-punisher-could-get-a-spinoff |title=Netflix On Marvel Series Release Plan And If Punisher Could Get A Spinoff |last=Goldman |first=Eric |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=July 28, 2015 |accessdate=July 28, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aMsAdcZ1?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/28/netflix-on-marvel-series-release-plan-and-if-punisher-could-get-a-spinoff |archivedate=July 28, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\">{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/jessica-jones-krysten-ritter-melissa-rosenberg-interview-nycc/ |title=Krysten Ritter & Showrunner Melissa Rosenberg Talk 'Jessica Jones' at NYCC |last=Weintraub |first=Steve |publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date=October 12, 2015 |accessdate=October 15, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cHchpv7S?url=http://collider.com/jessica-jones-krysten-ritter-melissa-rosenberg-interview-nycc/ |archivedate=October 14, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"RosenbergVarietyNov2015\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/features/jessica-jones-marvel-melissa-rosenberg-1201644912/ |title='Jessica Jones' Showrunner Melissa Rosenberg Talks About Her Tough Heroine |last=Ryan |first=Maureen |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 20, 2015 |accessdate=November 21, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dD7rxT4f?url=http://variety.com/2015/tv/features/jessica-jones-marvel-melissa-rosenberg-1201644912/ |archivedate=November 21, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"RosenbergSecondSeason\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/11/jessica-jones-spoilers-marvel-melissa-rosenberg-krysten-ritter-luke-cage-1201628832/ |title='Marvel's Jessica Jones' EP Melissa Rosenberg On Luke Cage, Season 2, 'Supergirl' & Gender Parity In Hollywood |last=Patten |first=Dominic |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=November 18, 2015 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6d9BxvVEQ?url=http://deadline.com/2015/11/jessica-jones-spoilers-marvel-melissa-rosenberg-krysten-ritter-luke-cage-1201628832/ |archivedate=November 19, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"S2Order\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/jessica-jones-season-2-netflix-krysten-ritter-mike-colter-luke-cage-1201666573/ |title='Jessica Jones' Renewed for Season 2 on Netflix |last=Friedlander |first=Whitney |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=January 17, 2016 |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ebvyYfnL?url=http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/jessica-jones-season-2-netflix-krysten-ritter-mike-colter-luke-cage-1201666573/ |archivedate=January 17, 2016 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"TennantReturn?\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/731416/do-jessica-jones-and-luke-cage-have-a-future-krysten-ritter-hopes-so |title=Do Jessica Jones and Luke Cage Have a Future?

Several constitutional amendments (the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]], [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth]], and [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth]] specifically) require that voting rights of U.S. citizens cannot be abridged on account of race, color, previous condition of servitude, sex, or age for those above 18; the constitution as originally written did not establish any such rights during 1787\u20131870, except that if a state permitted a person to vote for the \"most numerous branch\" of its state legislature, it was required to permit that person to vote in elections for members of the United States House of Representatives.<ref>U.S. Const. Art. I, s. 2, cl. 1.</ref> In the absence of a specific federal law or constitutional provision, each state is given considerable discretion to establish qualifications for suffrage and candidacy within its own respective jurisdiction; in addition, states and lower level jurisdictions establish election systems, such as [[at-large]] or [[single member district]] elections for county councils or school boards. Beyond qualifications for suffrage, rules and regulations concerning voting (such as the [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]]) have been contested since the advent of [[Jim Crow laws]] and related provisions that indirectly disenfranchised racial minorities.\n\nA historic turning point arrived when the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] under Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] [[Reynolds v. Sims|ruled in 1964]] that both houses of all state legislatures had to be based on election districts that were relatively equal in population size, under the \"[[one man, one vote]]\" principle.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theconstitutionproject.com/portfolio/one-person-one-vote/|title=One Person, One Vote {{!}} The Constitution Project|website=www.theconstitutionproject.com|access-date=2019-09-24}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/one-person-one-vote-a-history/399476/|title=The Case That Could Bring Down 'One Person, One Vote'|last=Smith|first=J.

In 1972, the [[Burger Court]] ruled that state legislatures had to redistrict every ten years based on census results; at that point, many had not redistricted for decades, often leading to a rural bias.\n\nIn other cases{{Which|date=June 2016}}, particularly for county or municipal elections, [[at-large]] voting has been repeatedly challenged when found to dilute the voting power of significant minorities in violation of the Voting Rights Act. In the early 20th century, numerous cities established small commission forms of government in the belief that \"better government\" could result from the suppression of ward politics. Commissioners were elected by the majority of voters, excluding candidates who could not afford large campaigns or who appealed to a minority. Generally the solution to such violations has been to adopt [[single-member district]]s (SMDs), but alternative election systems, such as [[limited voting]] or [[cumulative voting]], have also been used since the late 20th century to correct for dilution of voting power and enable minorities to elect candidates of their choice.\n\nThe [[District of Columbia]] and five major [[territories of the United States]] have [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|one non-voting member]] each (in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]) and no representation in the [[U.S. Senate]]. People in the U.S. territories cannot vote for [[president of the United States]].<ref name=\"Territories_vote\">{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/3736845/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-voting-rights/|title=Watch John Oliver Cast His Ballot for Voting Rights for U.S. Territories|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref> People in the District of Columbia can vote for the president because of the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-third Amendment]].\n\n== Background ==\nThe right to vote is the foundation of any democracy. Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] for example wrote in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'', 377 U.S. 533, 555 (1964): \u201cThe right to vote freely for the candidate of one\u2019s choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of [[Representative democracy|representative government]]. [...] Undoubtedly, the right of suffrage is a fundamental in a free and democratic society. Especially since the right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is preservative of other basic civil and political rights, any alleged infringement of the right of citizens to vote must be carefully and meticulously scrutinized.\u201d Justice [[Hugo Black]] shared the same sentinent by stating in ''[[Wesberry v. Sanders]]'', 376 U.S. 1, 17 (1964): \u201cNo right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election of those who make the laws under which, as good citizens, we must live. Other rights, even the most basic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined.\u201d\n\nIn the [[Thirteen Colonies#17th century|17th-century Thirteen Colonies]], [[suffrage]] was often restricted by [[property qualification]]s or with a [[religious test]]. In 1660, [[Plymouth Colony]] restricted suffrage with a specified property qualification, and in 1671, Plymouth Colony restricted suffrage further to only [[Freeman (Colonial)|freemen]] \"[[Puritans|orthodox in the fundamentals of religion]]\". [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] in mid-century also restricted suffrage with a specified property qualification and a religious test, and in [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], the [[Province of Carolina]], and the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]] voting rights were [[History of antisemitism in the United States#Colonial era|restricted to Christians only]]. Under the [[The Duke's Laws|Duke's Laws]] in colonial [[Province of New York|New York]], suffrage did not require a religious test but was restricted to [[Land tenure|landholders]]. In [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], all [[White Americans|white]] [[Freeman (Colonial)|freemen]] were allowed to vote until suffrage was restricted temporarily to [[Household#Government definitions|householders]] from 1655 to 1656, to [[Freehold (law)|freeholders]] from 1670 to 1676, and following the death of [[Nathaniel Bacon (Virginia)|Nathaniel Bacon]] in 1676, to freeholders permanently. [[Quakers]] were not permitted to vote in Plymouth Colony or in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], and along with [[Baptists in the United States|Baptists]], were not permitted to vote in several other colonies as well, and [[Catholic Church in the Thirteen Colonies|Catholics]] were [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]] following the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688\u20131689) in [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], [[Province of Carolina|Carolina]], and [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]].<ref name=\"Barck & Lefler pp. 258\u2013259\">{{cite book|last1=Barck|first1=Oscar T.|last2=Lefler|first2=Hugh T.|year=1958|title=Colonial America|place=New York|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]]|pages=258\u2013259}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Thirteen Colonies#18th century|18th-century Thirteen Colonies]], suffrage was restricted to white males with the following property qualifications:<ref name=\"Barck & Lefler pp. 259\u2013260\">{{cite book|last1=Barck|first1=Oscar T.|last2=Lefler|first2=Hugh T.|year=1958|title=Colonial America|place=New York|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]]|pages=259\u2013260}}</ref>\n\n* [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]]: an [[Estate (law)|estate]] worth [[\u00a3sd|40 shillings]] annually or [[Connecticut pound|\u00a340]] of [[personal property]]\n* [[Delaware Colony|Delaware]]: fifty acres of land (twelve [[Arable land|under cultivation]]) or [[Delaware pound|\u00a340]] of personal property\n* [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]]: fifty acres of land\n* [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]]: fifty acres of land and [[Maryland pound|\u00a340]] personal property\n* [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay]]: an estate worth 40 shillings annually or [[Massachusetts pound|\u00a340]] of personal property\n* [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]]: [[New Hampshire pound|\u00a350]] of personal property\n* [[Province of New Jersey|New Jersey]]: one-hundred acres of land, or real estate or personal property [[New Jersey pound|\u00a350]]\n* [[Province of New York|New York]]: [[New York pound|\u00a340]] of personal property or ownership of land\n* [[Province of North Carolina|North Carolina]]: fifty acres of land\n* [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]]: fifty acres of land or [[Pennsylvania pound|\u00a350]] of personal property\n* [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]]: personal property worth [[Rhode Island pound|\u00a340]] or yielding 50 shillings annually\n* [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]]: one-hundred acres of [[Property tax in the United States|land on which taxes were paid]]; or a [[Townhouse|town house]] or [[Land lot|lot]] worth [[South Carolina pound|\u00a360]] on which taxes were paid; or payment of 10 shillings in taxes\n* [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]]: fifty acres of vacant land, twenty-fives acres of cultivated land, and a house twelve feet by twelve feet; or a town lot and a house twelve feet by twelve\n\nThe [[United States Constitution]] did not originally define who was eligible to vote, allowing each state to determine who was eligible.

These extensions state that voting rights cannot be denied or abridged based on the following:\n* \"Race, color, or previous condition of servitude\" (Fifteenth Amendment, 1870)\n* \"On account of sex\" (Nineteenth Amendment, 1920)\n* \"By reason of failure to pay any [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] or other tax\" for federal elections (Twenty-fourth Amendment, 1964)<ref group=\"Note\">For state elections: ''[[Harper v.

These reforms in the 19th and 20th centuries extended the franchise to non-whites, those who do not own property, women, and those 18\u201321 years old.\n\nSince the \"right to vote\" is not explicitly stated in the U.S. Constitution except in the above referenced amendments, and only in reference to the fact that the franchise cannot be denied or abridged based solely on the aforementioned qualifications, the \"right to vote\" is perhaps better understood, in layman's terms, as only prohibiting certain forms of legal discrimination in establishing qualifications for suffrage. States may deny the \"right to vote\" for other reasons. For example, many states require eligible citizens to register to vote a set number of days prior to the election in order to vote. More controversial restrictions include those laws that [[felony disenfranchisement|prohibit convicted felons from voting]], even those who have served their sentences. Another example, seen in ''[[Bush v.

These treaties formed agreements between two sovereign nations, stating that Native American people were citizens of their tribe, living within the boundaries of the United States. The treaties were negotiated by the executive branch and ratified by the U.S. Senate. It said that native tribes would give up their rights to hunt and live on huge parcels of land that they had inhabited in exchange for trade goods, yearly cash [[Life annuity|annuity]] payments, and assurances that no further demands would be made on them. Most often, part of the land would be \"reserved\" exclusively for the tribe's use.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nur|first=Alio|title=A Long History of Treaties|url=http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/stories/0701_0140.html|publisher=Native American Citizenship|accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1800s, many native tribes gradually lost claim to the lands they had inhabited for centuries through the federal government's [[Indian Removal]] policy to relocate tribes from the Southeast and Northwest to west of the [[Mississippi River]]. European-American settlers continued to encroach on western lands. Only in 1879, in the [[Standing Bear]] trial, were American Indians recognized as persons in the eyes of the United States government. Judge [[Elmer Scipio Dundy]] of [[Nebraska]] declared that Indians were people within the meaning of the laws, and they had the rights associated with a writ of [[habeas corpus]]. However, Judge Dundy left unsettled the question as to whether Native Americans were guaranteed US citizenship.<ref>{{cite web|last=Alio|first=Nur|title=Native American Citizenship|url=http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/stories/0701_0140.html|publisher=nebraska studies.org|accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Native Americans were born within the national boundaries of the United States, those on reservations were considered citizens of their own tribes, rather than of the United States. They were denied the right to vote because they were not considered citizens by law and were thus ineligible. Many Native Americans were told they would become citizens if they gave up their tribal affiliations in 1887 under the [[Dawes Act]], which allocated communal lands to individual households and was intended to aid in the assimilation of Native Americans into majority culture. This still did not guarantee their right to vote. In 1924, the remaining Native Americans, estimated at about one-third, became United States citizens through the [[Indian Citizenship Act]]. Many western states, however, continued to restrict Native American ability to vote through property requirements, economic pressures, hiding the polls, and condoning of physical violence against those who voted.<ref>{{cite web|last=Alio|first=NUr|title=Native American Citizenship|url=http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/stories/0701_0140.html|publisher=nebraska studies.org|accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref> Since the late 20th century, they have been protected under provisions of the Voting Rights Act as a racial minority, and in some areas, language minority, gaining election materials in their native languages.\n\n=== Religious test ===\n\nIn several [[Thirteen Colonies|British North American colonies]], before and after the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], [[Jew]]s, [[Quakers]] and/or [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] were excluded from the franchise and/or from running for elections.<ref name=williamson1960>{{Citation\n|title=American Suffrage.

In 1869, the Fifteenth Amendment prohibited the government from denying a citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's \"race, color, or previous condition of servitude\".

Some states also prohibited them from voting.<ref name=\"Alio\" />\n\nThe Fifteenth Amendment, one of three ratified after the [[American Civil War]] to grant freedmen full rights of citizenship, prevented any state from denying the right to vote to any citizen based on race. This was primarily related to protecting the franchise of freedmen, but it also applied to non-white minorities, such as [[History of Mexican Americans in Texas|Mexican Americans in Texas]]. The state governments under [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] adopted new state constitutions or amendments designed to protect the ability of freedmen to vote. The white resistance to black suffrage after the war regularly erupted into violence as white groups tried to protect their power. Particularly in the [[U.S. Southern states|South]], in the aftermath of the Civil War whites made efforts to suppress [[Free negro|freedmen]]'s voting. In the 1860s, secret [[vigilante]] groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) used violence and intimidation to keep freedmen in a controlled role and reestablish white supremacy. But, black freedmen registered and voted in high numbers, and many were elected to local offices through the 1880s.\n\nIn the mid-1870s, the insurgencies continued with a rise in more powerful white [[paramilitary organizations|paramilitary groups]], such as the [[White League]], originating in [[Louisiana]] in 1874 after a disputed gubernatorial election; and the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], originating in [[Mississippi]] in 1875 and developing numerous chapters in North and [[South Carolina]]; as well as other \"White Line\" rifle clubs. They operated openly, were more organized than the KKK, and directed their efforts at political goals: to disrupt Republican organizing, turn Republicans out of office, and intimidate or kill blacks to suppress black voting.

Economic tactics such as eviction from rental housing or termination of employment were also used to suppress the black vote. White Democrats regained power in state legislatures across the South by the late 1870s, and the federal government withdrew its troops as a result of a national compromise related to the presidency, officially ending Reconstruction.\n\nAfrican Americans were a majority in three Southern states following the Civil War, and represented over 40% of the population in four other states. While they did not elect a majority of African Americans to office in any state legislature during Reconstruction, whites still feared and resented the political power exercised by freedmen.<ref>Gabriel J.

In the late 19th century, a Populist-Republican coalition in several states gained governorships and some congressional seats in 1894. To prevent such a coalition from forming again and reduce election violence, the Democratic Party, dominant in all southern state legislatures, took action to disfranchise most blacks and many poor whites outright.\n\nFrom 1890 to 1908, ten of the eleven former Confederate states completed political suppression and exclusion of these groups by ratifying new constitutions or amendments which incorporated provisions to make voter registration more difficult. These included such requirements as payment of [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], complicated record keeping, complicated timing of registration and length of residency in relation to elections, with related record-keeping requirements; [[felony disenfranchisement]] focusing on crimes thought to be committed by African Americans,<ref>Gabriel J.

[[African Americans|Blacks]] were often denied the right to vote on this basis. Even well-educated blacks were often told they had \"failed\" such a test, if in fact, it had been administered. On the other hand, illiterate [[whites]] were sometimes allowed to vote through a \"[[grandfather clause]],\" which waived literacy requirements if one's grandfather had been a qualified voter before 1866, or had served as a soldier, or was from a foreign country. As most blacks had grandfathers who were slaves before 1866 and could not have fulfilled any of those conditions, they could not use the grandfather clause exemption. Selective enforcement of the [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] was frequently also used to disqualify black and poor white voters. As a result of these measures, at the turn of the century voter rolls dropped markedly across the South. Most blacks and many poor whites were excluded from the political system for decades. Unable to vote, they were also excluded from juries or running for any office.\n\nIn Alabama, for example, its 1901 constitution restricted the franchise for poor whites as well as blacks. It contained requirements for payment of cumulative [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], completion of [[literacy tests]], and increased residency at state, county and precinct levels, effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchising]] tens of thousands of [[Poor White|poor whites]] as well as most blacks.

Pildes, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 \"Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon\"], ''Constitutional Commentary'' 17 (2000): 13-14, accessed Mar 10, 2008</ref> The Supreme Court's upholding of [[Mississippi]]'s new constitution, in ''[[Williams v. Mississippi]]'' (1898), encouraged other states to follow the Mississippi plan of disfranchisement. African Americans brought other legal challenges, as in ''[[Giles v. Harris]]'' (1903) and ''Giles v. Teasley'' (1904), but the Supreme Court upheld [[Alabama]] constitutional provisions. In 1915, Oklahoma was the last state to append a [[grandfather clause]] to its literacy requirement due to Supreme Court cases.\n\nFrom early in the 20th century, the newly established [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] ([[NAACP]]) took the lead in organizing or supporting legal challenges to segregation and disfranchisement. Gradually they planned the strategy of which cases to take forward. In ''Guinn v. United States'' (1915), the first case in which the NAACP filed a brief, the Supreme Court struck down the grandfather clause in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Maryland]]. Other states in which it was used had to retract their legislation as well. The challenge was successful.\n\nBut, nearly as rapidly as the Supreme Court determined a specific provision was unconstitutional, state legislatures developed new statutes to continue disenfranchisement. For instance, in ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' (1944), the Supreme Court struck down the use of state-sanctioned all-white primaries by the Democratic Party in the South. States developed new restrictions on black voting; Alabama passed a law giving county registrars more authority as to which questions they asked applicants in comprehension or literacy tests. The NAACP continued with steady progress in legal challenges to disenfranchisement and segregation.\n\nIn 1957, Congress passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]] to implement the Fifteenth Amendment. It established the [[United States Civil Rights Commission]]; among its duties is to investigate voter discrimination.\n\nAs late as 1962, programs such as [[Operation Eagle Eye (United States)|Operation Eagle Eye]] in Arizona attempted to stymie minority voting through literacy tests. The Twenty-fourth Amendment was ratified in 1964 to prohibit poll taxes as a condition of voter registration and voting in federal elections. Many states continued to use them in state elections as a means of reducing the number of voters.\n\nThe [[American Civil Rights Movement]], through such events as the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] and Freedom Summer in Mississippi, gained passage by the [[United States Congress]] of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which authorized federal oversight of voter registration and election practices and other enforcement of voting rights. Congress passed the legislation because it found \"case by case litigation was inadequate to combat widespread and persistent discrimination in voting\". Activism by African Americans helped secure an expanded and protected franchise that has benefited all Americans, including racial and language minorities.\n\nThe bill provided for federal oversight, if necessary, to ensure just voter registration and election procedures. The rate of African-American registration and voting in Southern states climbed dramatically and quickly, but it has taken years of federal oversight to work out the processes and overcome local resistance. In addition, it was not until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in ''[[Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections]]'' (1966) that all state poll taxes (for state elections) were officially declared unconstitutional as violating the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the Fourteenth Amendment. This removed a burden on the poor.<ref name=Scher2015>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=POzqBgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA13&pg=PR9#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Politics of Disenfranchisement: Why is it So Hard to Vote in America?|last=Scher|first=Richard K.|date=2015|page=viii-ix|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317455363}}</ref><ref name=NHLTS2009>{{Cite paper|date=2009|title=Civil Rights in America: Racial Voting Rights|url=https://www.nps.gov/nhl/learn/themes/CivilRights_VotingRights.pdf|journal=|publisher=A National Historic Landmarks Theme Study}}</ref>\n\nLegal challenges have continued under the Voting Rights Act, primarily in areas of redistricting and election systems, for instance, challenging [[at-large]] election systems that effectively reduce the ability of minority groups to elect candidates of their choice. Such challenges have particularly occurred at the county and municipal level, including for school boards, where exclusion of minority groups and candidates at such levels has been persistent in some areas of the country. This reduces the ability of women and minorities to participate in the political system and gain entry-level experience.\n\n=== Women ===\n\n{{See also|Women's suffrage in the United States}}\n\nA parallel, yet separate, movement was that for [[women's suffrage]]. Leaders of the suffrage movement included [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], and [[Alice Paul]]. In some ways this, too, could be said to have grown out of the [[American Civil War]], as women had been strong leaders of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] movement. Middle- and upper-class women generally became more politically active in the northern tier during and after the war.\n\nIn 1848, the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first [[women's rights]] convention, was held in [[Seneca Falls, New York]]. Of the 300 present, 68 women and 32 men signed the [[Declaration of Sentiments]] which defined the women's rights movement. The first [[National Women's Rights Convention]] took place in 1850 in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], attracting more than 1,000 participants. This national convention was held yearly through 1860.\n\nWhen Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton formed the National Women Suffrage Association, their goal was to help women gain voting rights through reliance on the Constitution. Also, in 1869 [[Lucy Stone]] and [[Henry Browne Blackwell|Henry Blackwell]] formed the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA). However, AWSA focused on gaining voting rights for women through the amendment process. Although these two organization were fighting for the same cause, it was not until 1890 that they merged to form the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA). After the merger of the two organizations, the (NAWSA) waged a state-by-state campaign to obtain voting rights for women.\n\n[[Wyoming]] was the first state in which women were able to vote, although it was a condition of the transition to statehood. [[Utah]] was the second territory to allow women to vote, but the federal [[Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act]] of 1887 repealed woman's suffrage in Utah. Colorado was the first established state to allow women to vote on the same basis as men. Some other states also extended the franchise to women before the Constitution was amended to this purpose.\n\nDuring the 1910s Alice Paul, assisted by [[Lucy Burns]] and many others, organized such events and organizations as the [[1913 Women's Suffrage Parade]], the [[National Woman's Party]], and the [[Silent Sentinels]]. At the culmination of the suffragists' requests and protests, ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment gave women the right to vote in time to participate in the [[President of the United States|Presidential]] election of [[US Presidential election, 1920|1920]].\n\nAnother political movement that was largely driven by women in the same era was the anti-[[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] [[Temperance movement]], which led to the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] and [[Prohibition]].<ref>{{cite web|last=alio|first=nur|title=women|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/womenstimeline1.html|publisher=Women's Rights Movement in the U.S.|accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Washington, D.C. ===\n\n[[Washington, D.C.]], was created from a portion of the states of Maryland and Virginia in 1801. The Virginia portion was [[Cession|retroceded]] (returned) to Virginia upon request of the residents, by an Act of Congress in 1846 to protect slavery, and restore state and federal voting rights in that portion of Virginia. When Maryland delegated a portion of its land to Congress so it could be used as the Nation's capital, Congress did not continue Maryland Voting Laws. It canceled all state and federal elections starting with 1802. Local elections limped on in some neighborhoods, until 1871, when local elections were also forbidden by the U.S. Congress. The U.S. Congress is the National Legislature. Under Article&nbsp;I, Section&nbsp;8, Clause 17, Congress has the sole authority to exercise \"Exclusive Legislature in all cases whatsoever\" over the nation's capital and over federal military bases. Active disfranchisement is typically a States Rights Legislative issue, where the removal of voting rights is permitted. At the national level, the federal government typically ignored voting rights issues, or affirmed that they were extended.\n\nCongress, when exercising \"exclusive legislation\" over U.S. Military Bases in the United States, and Washington, D.C., viewed its power as strong enough to remove all voting rights. All state and federal elections were canceled by Congress in D.C. and all of Maryland's voting Rights laws no longer applied to D.C. when Maryland gave up that land. Congress did not pass laws to establish local voting processes in the District of Columbia. This omission of law strategy to disfranchise is contained in the Congressional debates in Annals of Congress in 1800 and 1801.\n\nIn 1986, the US Congress voted to restore voting rights on U.S. Military bases for all state and federal elections.\n\nD.C. citizens were granted the right to vote in Presidential elections in 1961 after ratification of the Twenty-third Amendment. The citizens and territory converted in 1801 were represented by [[John Chew Thomas]] from Maryland's 2nd, and [[William Craik (politician)|William Craik]] from Maryland's 3rd Congressional Districts, which were redrawn and removed from the city.\n\nNo full Congressional elections have been held since in D.C., a gap continuing since 1801. Congress created a non-voting substitute for a U.S. Congressman, a Delegate, between 1871\u20131875, but then abolished that post as well. Congress permitted restoration of local elections and [[home rule]] for the District on December 24, 1973. In 1971, Congress still opposed restoring the position of a full U.S. Congressman for Washington, D.C. That year it re-established the position of non-voting Delegate to the U.S. Congress.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1881791,00.html|title=A Brief History of Washington, D.C.|last=James|first=Randy|date=2009-02-26|newspaper=Time|access-date=2017-02-16|work=|issn=0040-781X|via=}}</ref><!--Needs expansion to give Congressional reasoning against representation for the District; might also compare to residents of other national capitals, but most were organic, rather than created separately as was the District-->\n\n=== Young people ===\n\n{{See also|Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution}}\n[[File:Voting Rights for 17-year-olds in US States.svg|thumb|right|250px|Some states (shown in blue) allow 17-year-olds to vote in primaries/caucuses if their 18th birthday is before the general election.]]\n\nA third voting rights movement was won in the 1960s to lower the voting age from twenty-one to eighteen. Activists noted that most of the young men who were being [[conscription|drafted]] to fight in the [[Vietnam War]] were too young to have any voice in the selection of the leaders who were sending them to fight. Some states had already lowered the voting age: notably [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Hawaii]], had already permitted voting by persons younger than twenty-one.\n\nThe Twenty-sixth Amendment, ratified in 1971, prohibits federal and state laws which set a minimum voting age higher than 18 years.

Some states allow only individuals on probation to vote. Others allow individuals on parole and probation.

By the early 21st century, there have been numerous court cases to help protect the voting rights of persons without a fixed address. Low income and homeless citizens face some obstacles in registering to vote. These obstacles include establishing residency, providing a mailing address, and showing proof of identification. A residency requirement varies from state to state. States cannot require citizens to show residency of more than 30 days before Election Day. The states of Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming allow voters to register on Election Day. North Dakota does not require voters to register.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barder|title=American Government and Politics Today|year=2011\u20132012|publisher=Suzanne Jeans|page=313}}</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, homeless persons in all states have the right to register and vote if they satisfy other conditions. In most states, when registering to vote, homeless voters may designate any place of residence, including a street corner, a park, a shelter, or any other location where an individual stays at night. A citizen may have only one residency during registration, but they may switch their registration each time they change locations.<ref>[https://www.fvap.gov/info/laws/voting-residency-guidelines \"Voting Residency Guidelines\"], [[Federal Voting Assistance Program]]</ref> Designating residency is needed to prove that the citizen lives within the district where he or she wishes to vote. Some states also require a mailing address in order to send out the voter ID card, which the individual must show on Election Day. Some states allow individuals to use PO Boxes as mailing addresses; other states allow the address to be that of a local shelter, advocacy organization, outreach center, or anywhere else that accepts mail on behalf of a person registering to vote. States such as Arizona and Nebraska allow homeless citizens to use county court houses or county clerks' offices as mailing address.\n\nStates that do not require a mailing address include Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Montana, New Jersey, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.<ref>[http://www.nationalhomeless.org/projects/vote/Manual_2011.pdf]</ref>\n\nAll potential voters face new requirements since 2002, when President Bush signed the [[Help America Vote Act]] (HAVA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eac.gov/about_the_eac/help_america_vote_act.aspx |title=Help America Vote Act of 2002, HAVA &#124; The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) |publisher= Election Assistance Commission |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act |title=Help America Vote Act |publisher=OpenCongress Wiki |accessdate=2013-06-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625083933/http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act |archivedate=2013-06-25 }}</ref> It requires voters to provide their [[Driver's license in the United States|driver's license numbers]], or the last four digits of their [[Social Security Number]] on their voter registration form.

Nonprofits, like homeless shelters and [[food bank]]s, set up a voter registration party to help homeless citizens to register. The nonprofit workers must remain nonpartisan when assisting in the registration process.\n\n==== Court cases involving homeless voting ====\n\nVoting rights of the American homeless is an issue that has been addressed in the courts since the 1980s. Each state is responsible for voting regulations in their area; however, many states throughout America have adopted similar laws regarding homeless citizen voting. Disenfranchising the homeless is considered a violation of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment's [[Equal Protection Clause]]. Many arguments have been made against homeless people being able to vote. Their status of true citizenship has been called into question because of their lack of residency. However, the courts have ruled on more than one occasion in favor of the homeless voting.\n\nOne of the first court cases regarding homeless voting was ''Pitts v. Black'' (1984) in the US District Court of Southern New York, which ruled that disenfranchising homeless citizens is a direct violation of the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case involved the New York Election Board and homeless individuals assisted by the [[Coalition for the Homeless]], among others. The Election Board denied the individuals the right to vote because they resided on the street or in shelters. The Election Board contended that residency required some claim (such as rent) or ownership of the area on which they resided.<ref name=\"members.fortunecity.com\">{{cite web|title=''Marthaann E.

Menzel'', and ''Walters v. Weed'', also addressed the residency question of homeless voters:\n* ''Collier v. Menzel'' (1985): The Santa Barbara District Court case established that a residence could be a certain location rather than a specific address. Howard Menzel, the county clerk, rejected three voter registration applications on the grounds that proper addresses were not provided. The applications simply stated a public park as the applicants' residence. The court overruled the clerk's decision and defined a residence as any fixed location where a person habitually sleeps and where living quarters are set up. In their final decisions, the court stated that denying a citizen the right to vote due to residence in a public park, is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection clause.<ref name=\"nationalhomeless.org\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=''Collier v.

Property restrictions, duration of residency restrictions, and, for school boards, restrictions of the franchise to voters with children, remained in force. In a series of rulings from 1969 to 1973, the Court ruled that the franchise could be restricted in some cases to those \"primarily interested\" or \"primarily affected\" by the outcome of a specialized election, but not in the case of school boards or bond issues, which affected taxation to be paid by all residents.<ref name=\"justia voter\">{{Citation\n|url=http://supreme.justia.com/constitution/amendment-14/92-voter-qualifications.html\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031112234/http://supreme.justia.com/constitution/amendment-14/92-voter-qualifications.html\n|archivedate=2006-10-31\n|title=U.S. Constitution Annotated\n|accessdate=2008-04-18\n|publisher=Justia}}</ref> In ''Ball v.

While states were permitted to require voters to register for a political party 30 days before an election, or to require them to vote in only one party primary, the state could not prevent a voter from voting in a party primary if the voter has voted in another party's primary in the last 23 months.<ref name=\"justia voter\" /> The Court also ruled that a state may not mandate a \"closed primary\" system and bar independents from voting in a party's primary against the wishes of the party.

This is because D.C. is a federal district and not a state and, under the Constitution, only states are apportioned congresspersons.\n\nDistrict of Columbia citizens had voting rights removed in 1801 by Congress, when Maryland delegated that portion of its land to Congress. Congress incrementally removed effective local control or [[home rule]] by 1871. It restored some home rule in 1971, but maintained the authority to override any local laws. Washington, D.C., does not have full representation in the U.S. House or Senate. The Twenty-third Amendment, restoring U.S. Presidential Election after a 164-year-gap, is the only known limit to Congressional \"exclusive legislature\" from Article I-8-17, forcing Congress to enforce for the first time Amendments 14, 15, 19, 24, and 26. It gave the District of Columbia three [[U.S. Electoral College|electors]] and hence the right to vote for [[President of the United States|President]], but not full U.S. Congresspersons nor U.S. Senators. In 1978, another amendment was proposed which would have restored to the District a full seat, but it failed to receive ratification by a sufficient number of states within the seven years required.\n\n{{as of|2013}}, [[District of Columbia voting rights#Proposal during administration of Barack Obama|a bill]] is pending in Congress that would treat the District of Columbia as \"a congressional district for purposes of representation in the House of Representatives\", and permit United States citizens residing in the capital to vote for a member to represent them in the House of Representatives.

The petition indicated that it was presented on behalf of the members of the Statehood Solidarity Committee and all other U.S. citizens resident in the District of Columbia. The petition alleged that the United States was responsible for violations of Articles&nbsp;II (right to equality before law) and XX (right to vote and to participate in government) of the [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]] in connection with the inability of citizens of the District of Columbia to vote for and elect a representative to the U.S. Congress. On December 29, 2003, The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights having examined the information and arguments provided by the parties on the question of admissibility. Without prejudging the merits of the matter, the Commission decided to admit the present petition in respect of Articles&nbsp;II and XX of the American Declaration. In addition, the Commission concluded that the United States violates the Petitioners' rights under Articles&nbsp;II and XX of the [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]] by denying District of Columbia [[Citizenship in the United States|citizens]] an effective opportunity to participate in their [[United States Congress|federal legislature]].<ref>[http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/oas1203w.pdf Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (Organization of American States) REPORT N\u00ba 98/03*] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001020855/http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/oas1203w.pdf |date=2011-10-01 }}</ref>\n\n=== Overseas and nonresident citizens ===\n\nU.S. citizens residing overseas who would otherwise have the right to vote are guaranteed the right to vote in federal elections by the [[Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act]] ([[UOCAVA]]) of 1986.<ref name=\"usdoj.gov\" /> As a practical matter, individual states implement UOCAVA.\n\nA citizen who has never resided in the United States can vote if a parent is eligible to vote in certain states.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.fvap.gov/reference/nev-res/index.html\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723194403/http://www.fvap.gov/reference/nev-res/index.html\n|archivedate=2008-07-23\n|title=Federal Voting Assistance Program\n|publisher=FVAP|accessdate=2008-09-30}}</ref> In some of these states the citizen can vote in local, state and federal elections, in others in federal elections only.\n\n=== U.S. territories ===\n\nU.S. citizens and non-citizen [[U.S. national|nationals]] who reside in [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]], or the [[United States Virgin Islands]] are not allowed to vote in U.S. national and presidential elections, as these [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] belong to the United States but do not have presidential electors. The U.S. Constitution requires a voter to be resident in one of the 50 states or in the District of Columbia to vote in federal elections. To say that the Constitution does not require extension of federal voting rights to U.S. territories residents does not, however, exclude the possibility that the Constitution may permit their enfranchisement under another source of law. Statehood or a constitutional amendment would allow people in the U.S. territories to vote in federal elections.<ref name=iguartia />\n\nLike the District of Columbia, territories of the United States do not have [[U.S. senators]] representing them in the senate, and they each have one [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|member of the House of Representatives who is not allowed to vote]].<ref name=\"Territories_vote\"/>\n\n==== Puerto Rico ====\n\n{{Main|Voting rights in Puerto Rico}}\n\n[[Puerto Rico]] is an [[insular area]]\u2014a [[United States]] [[Organized territory|territory]] that is neither a part of one of the fifty [[U.S. state|states]] nor a part of the [[District of Columbia]], the nation's [[federal district]]. Insular areas, such as Puerto Rico, the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] and [[Guam]], are not allowed to choose electors in [[U.S. presidential election]]s or elect voting members to the [[U.S. Congress]]. This grows out of [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article&nbsp;I]] and [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article&nbsp;II]] of the [[United States Constitution]], which specifically mandate that electors are to be chosen by \"the People of the several States\". In 1961, the Twenty-third Amendment extended the right to choose electors to the District of Columbia.\n\nAny [[U.S. citizen]] who resides in Puerto Rico (whether a [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] or not) is effectively disenfranchised at the national level. Although the Republican Party and Democratic Party chapters in Puerto Rico have selected voting delegates to the national nominating conventions participating in U.S. presidential primaries or caucuses, U.S. citizens not residing in one of the 50 states or in the District of Columbia may not vote in federal elections.\n\nVarious scholars (including a prominent U.S. judge in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]]) conclude that the U.S. national-electoral process is not fully democratic due to U.S. government disenfranchisement of U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico.<ref>Torruella, Juan R.

Different courts have reached different conclusions regarding what sort of restrictions, often in terms of [[ballot access]], public debate inclusion, filing fees, and residency requirements, may be imposed.\n\nIn ''[[Williams v. Rhodes]]'' (1968), the United States Supreme Court struck down [[Ohio]] ballot access laws on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and Fourteenth Amendment grounds. However, it subsequently upheld such laws in several other cases. States can require an independent or minor party candidate to collect signatures as high as five percent of the total votes cast in a particular preceding election before the court will intervene.\n\nThe Supreme Court has also upheld a state ban on cross-party endorsements (also known as [[electoral fusion]]) and primary write-in votes.\n\n== Noncitizen voting ==\n\n{{Main|Right of foreigners to vote in the United States}}\n\nMore than 40 states or territories, including colonies before the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], have at some time allowed noncitizens who satisfied residential requirements to vote in some or all elections.

Several constitutional amendments (the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]], [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth]], and [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth]] specifically) require that voting rights of U.S. citizens cannot be abridged on account of race, color, previous condition of servitude, sex, or age for those above 18; the constitution as originally written did not establish any such rights during 1787\u20131870, except that if a state permitted a person to vote for the \"most numerous branch\" of its state legislature, it was required to permit that person to vote in elections for members of the United States House of Representatives.<ref>U.S. Const. Art. I, s. 2, cl. 1.</ref> In the absence of a specific federal law or constitutional provision, each state is given considerable discretion to establish qualifications for suffrage and candidacy within its own respective jurisdiction; in addition, states and lower level jurisdictions establish election systems, such as [[at-large]] or [[single member district]] elections for county councils or school boards. Beyond qualifications for suffrage, rules and regulations concerning voting (such as the [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]]) have been contested since the advent of [[Jim Crow laws]] and related provisions that indirectly disenfranchised racial minorities.\n\nA historic turning point arrived when the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] under Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] [[Reynolds v.

In 1972, the [[Burger Court]] ruled that state legislatures had to redistrict every ten years based on census results; at that point, many had not redistricted for decades, often leading to a rural bias.\n\nIn other cases{{Which|date=June 2016}}, particularly for county or municipal elections, [[at-large]] voting has been repeatedly challenged when found to dilute the voting power of significant minorities in violation of the Voting Rights Act. In the early 20th century, numerous cities established small commission forms of government in the belief that \"better government\" could result from the suppression of ward politics. Commissioners were elected by the majority of voters, excluding candidates who could not afford large campaigns or who appealed to a minority. Generally the solution to such violations has been to adopt [[single-member district]]s (SMDs), but alternative election systems, such as [[limited voting]] or [[cumulative voting]], have also been used since the late 20th century to correct for dilution of voting power and enable minorities to elect candidates of their choice.\n\nThe [[District of Columbia]] and five major [[territories of the United States]] have [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|one non-voting member]] each (in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]) and no representation in the [[U.S. Senate]].

Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] for example wrote in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'', 377 U.S. 533, 555 (1964): \u201cThe right to vote freely for the candidate of one\u2019s choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of [[Representative democracy|representative government]].\u201d Justice [[Hugo Black]] added in ''[[Wesberry v. Sanders]]'', 376 U.S. 1, 17 (1964): \u201cNo right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election of those who make the laws under which, as good citizens, we must live. Other rights, even the most basic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined.\u201d\n\nIn the [[Thirteen Colonies#17th century|17th-century Thirteen Colonies]], [[suffrage]] was often restricted by [[property qualification]]s or with a [[religious test]]. In 1660, [[Plymouth Colony]] restricted suffrage with a specified property qualification, and in 1671, Plymouth Colony restricted suffrage further to only [[Freeman (Colonial)|freemen]] \"[[Puritans|orthodox in the fundamentals of religion]]\". [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] in mid-century also restricted suffrage with a specified property qualification and a religious test, and in [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], the [[Province of Carolina]], and the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]] voting rights were [[History of antisemitism in the United States#Colonial era|restricted to Christians only]]. Under the [[The Duke's Laws|Duke's Laws]] in colonial [[Province of New York|New York]], suffrage did not require a religious test but was restricted to [[Land tenure|landholders]]. In [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], all [[White Americans|white]] [[Freeman (Colonial)|freemen]] were allowed to vote until suffrage was restricted temporarily to [[Household#Government definitions|householders]] from 1655 to 1656, to [[Freehold (law)|freeholders]] from 1670 to 1676, and following the death of [[Nathaniel Bacon (Virginia)|Nathaniel Bacon]] in 1676, to freeholders permanently.

These extensions state that voting rights cannot be denied or abridged based on the following:\n* \"Race, color, or previous condition of servitude\" (Fifteenth Amendment, 1870)\n* \"On account of sex\" (Nineteenth Amendment, 1920)\n* \"By reason of failure to pay any [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] or other tax\" for federal elections (Twenty-fourth Amendment, 1964)<ref group=\"Note\">For state elections: ''[[Harper v.

These reforms in the 19th and 20th centuries extended the franchise to non-whites, those who do not own property, women, and those 18\u201321 years old.\n\nSince the \"right to vote\" is not explicitly stated in the U.S. Constitution except in the above referenced amendments, and only in reference to the fact that the franchise cannot be denied or abridged based solely on the aforementioned qualifications, the \"right to vote\" is perhaps better understood, in layman's terms, as only prohibiting certain forms of legal discrimination in establishing qualifications for suffrage. States may deny the \"right to vote\" for other reasons. For example, many states require eligible citizens to register to vote a set number of days prior to the election in order to vote. More controversial restrictions include those laws that [[felony disenfranchisement|prohibit convicted felons from voting]], even those who have served their sentences. Another example, seen in ''[[Bush v.

These treaties formed agreements between two sovereign nations, stating that Native American people were citizens of their tribe, living within the boundaries of the United States. The treaties were negotiated by the executive branch and ratified by the U.S. Senate. It said that native tribes would give up their rights to hunt and live on huge parcels of land that they had inhabited in exchange for trade goods, yearly cash [[Life annuity|annuity]] payments, and assurances that no further demands would be made on them. Most often, part of the land would be \"reserved\" exclusively for the tribe's use.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nur|first=Alio|title=A Long History of Treaties|url=http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/stories/0701_0140.html|publisher=Native American Citizenship|accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1800s, many native tribes gradually lost claim to the lands they had inhabited for centuries through the federal government's [[Indian Removal]] policy to relocate tribes from the Southeast and Northwest to west of the [[Mississippi River]]. European-American settlers continued to encroach on western lands. Only in 1879, in the [[Standing Bear]] trial, were American Indians recognized as persons in the eyes of the United States government. Judge [[Elmer Scipio Dundy]] of [[Nebraska]] declared that Indians were people within the meaning of the laws, and they had the rights associated with a writ of [[habeas corpus]]. However, Judge Dundy left unsettled the question as to whether Native Americans were guaranteed US citizenship.<ref>{{cite web|last=Alio|first=Nur|title=Native American Citizenship|url=http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/stories/0701_0140.html|publisher=nebraska studies.org|accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Native Americans were born within the national boundaries of the United States, those on reservations were considered citizens of their own tribes, rather than of the United States. They were denied the right to vote because they were not considered citizens by law and were thus ineligible. Many Native Americans were told they would become citizens if they gave up their tribal affiliations in 1887 under the [[Dawes Act]], which allocated communal lands to individual households and was intended to aid in the assimilation of Native Americans into majority culture. This still did not guarantee their right to vote. In 1924, the remaining Native Americans, estimated at about one-third, became United States citizens through the [[Indian Citizenship Act]].

In 1869, the Fifteenth Amendment prohibited the government from denying a citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's \"race, color, or previous condition of servitude\".

They attempted to control their movement, assembly, working conditions and other civil rights. Some states also prohibited them from voting.<ref name=\"Alio\" />\n\nThe Fifteenth Amendment, one of three ratified after the [[American Civil War]] to grant freedmen full rights of citizenship, prevented any state from denying the right to vote to any citizen based on race. This was primarily related to protecting the franchise of freedmen, but it also applied to non-white minorities, such as [[History of Mexican Americans in Texas|Mexican Americans in Texas]]. The state governments under [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] adopted new state constitutions or amendments designed to protect the ability of freedmen to vote. The white resistance to black suffrage after the war regularly erupted into violence as white groups tried to protect their power. Particularly in the [[U.S. Southern states|South]], in the aftermath of the Civil War whites made efforts to suppress [[Free negro|freedmen]]'s voting. In the 1860s, secret [[vigilante]] groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) used violence and intimidation to keep freedmen in a controlled role and reestablish white supremacy. But, black freedmen registered and voted in high numbers, and many were elected to local offices through the 1880s.\n\nIn the mid-1870s, the insurgencies continued with a rise in more powerful white [[paramilitary organizations|paramilitary groups]], such as the [[White League]], originating in [[Louisiana]] in 1874 after a disputed gubernatorial election; and the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], originating in [[Mississippi]] in 1875 and developing numerous chapters in North and [[South Carolina]]; as well as other \"White Line\" rifle clubs. They operated openly, were more organized than the KKK, and directed their efforts at political goals: to disrupt Republican organizing, turn Republicans out of office, and intimidate or kill blacks to suppress black voting. They worked as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party\".<ref name=rable>{{cite book|last=Rable|first=George C.|title=But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction|date=2007|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=[[Athens, Georgia|Athens, GA]]|isbn=978-0-8203-3011-2|page=132 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qn37CH-i9IC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> For instance, estimates were that 150 blacks were killed in North Carolina before the 1876 elections. Economic tactics such as eviction from rental housing or termination of employment were also used to suppress the black vote. White Democrats regained power in state legislatures across the South by the late 1870s, and the federal government withdrew its troops as a result of a national compromise related to the presidency, officially ending Reconstruction.\n\nAfrican Americans were a majority in three Southern states following the Civil War, and represented over 40% of the population in four other states. While they did not elect a majority of African Americans to office in any state legislature during Reconstruction, whites still feared and resented the political power exercised by freedmen.<ref>Gabriel J.

In the late 19th century, a Populist-Republican coalition in several states gained governorships and some congressional seats in 1894. To prevent such a coalition from forming again and reduce election violence, the Democratic Party, dominant in all southern state legislatures, took action to disfranchise most blacks and many poor whites outright.\n\nFrom 1890 to 1908, ten of the eleven former Confederate states completed political suppression and exclusion of these groups by ratifying new constitutions or amendments which incorporated provisions to make voter registration more difficult. These included such requirements as payment of [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], complicated record keeping, complicated timing of registration and length of residency in relation to elections, with related record-keeping requirements; [[felony disenfranchisement]] focusing on crimes thought to be committed by African Americans,<ref>Gabriel J.

[[African Americans|Blacks]] were often denied the right to vote on this basis. Even well-educated blacks were often told they had \"failed\" such a test, if in fact, it had been administered. On the other hand, illiterate [[whites]] were sometimes allowed to vote through a \"[[grandfather clause]],\" which waived literacy requirements if one's grandfather had been a qualified voter before 1866, or had served as a soldier, or was from a foreign country. As most blacks had grandfathers who were slaves before 1866 and could not have fulfilled any of those conditions, they could not use the grandfather clause exemption. Selective enforcement of the [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] was frequently also used to disqualify black and poor white voters. As a result of these measures, at the turn of the century voter rolls dropped markedly across the South. Most blacks and many poor whites were excluded from the political system for decades. Unable to vote, they were also excluded from juries or running for any office.\n\nIn Alabama, for example, its 1901 constitution restricted the franchise for poor whites as well as blacks. It contained requirements for payment of cumulative [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], completion of [[literacy tests]], and increased residency at state, county and precinct levels, effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchising]] tens of thousands of [[Poor White|poor whites]] as well as most blacks. Historian J. Morgan Kousser found, \"They disfranchised these whites as willingly as they deprived blacks of the vote.\"<ref>J. Morgan Kousser.''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974</ref> By 1941, more whites than blacks in total had been disenfranchised.<ref name=\"Glenn Feldman 2004, pp. 135\u2013136\">Glenn Feldman, ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp.&nbsp;135\u2013136</ref>\n\n==== Legal challenges to disfranchisement ====\n\nAlthough African Americans quickly began legal challenges to such provisions in the 19th century, it was years before any were successful before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. [[Booker T. Washington]], better known for his public stance of trying to work within societal constraints of the period at [[Tuskegee University]], secretly helped fund and arrange representation for numerous legal challenges to disfranchisement. He called upon wealthy Northern allies and philanthropists to raise funds for the cause.<ref>Richard H. Pildes, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 \"Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon\"], ''Constitutional Commentary'' 17 (2000): 13-14, accessed Mar 10, 2008</ref> The Supreme Court's upholding of [[Mississippi]]'s new constitution, in ''[[Williams v. Mississippi]]'' (1898), encouraged other states to follow the Mississippi plan of disfranchisement. African Americans brought other legal challenges, as in ''[[Giles v. Harris]]'' (1903) and ''Giles v. Teasley'' (1904), but the Supreme Court upheld [[Alabama]] constitutional provisions. In 1915, Oklahoma was the last state to append a [[grandfather clause]] to its literacy requirement due to Supreme Court cases.\n\nFrom early in the 20th century, the newly established [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] ([[NAACP]]) took the lead in organizing or supporting legal challenges to segregation and disfranchisement. Gradually they planned the strategy of which cases to take forward. In ''Guinn v. United States'' (1915), the first case in which the NAACP filed a brief, the Supreme Court struck down the grandfather clause in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Maryland]]. Other states in which it was used had to retract their legislation as well. The challenge was successful.\n\nBut, nearly as rapidly as the Supreme Court determined a specific provision was unconstitutional, state legislatures developed new statutes to continue disenfranchisement. For instance, in ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' (1944), the Supreme Court struck down the use of state-sanctioned all-white primaries by the Democratic Party in the South. States developed new restrictions on black voting; Alabama passed a law giving county registrars more authority as to which questions they asked applicants in comprehension or literacy tests. The NAACP continued with steady progress in legal challenges to disenfranchisement and segregation.\n\nIn 1957, Congress passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]] to implement the Fifteenth Amendment. It established the [[United States Civil Rights Commission]]; among its duties is to investigate voter discrimination.\n\nAs late as 1962, programs such as [[Operation Eagle Eye (United States)|Operation Eagle Eye]] in Arizona attempted to stymie minority voting through literacy tests. The Twenty-fourth Amendment was ratified in 1964 to prohibit poll taxes as a condition of voter registration and voting in federal elections. Many states continued to use them in state elections as a means of reducing the number of voters.\n\nThe [[American Civil Rights Movement]], through such events as the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] and Freedom Summer in Mississippi, gained passage by the [[United States Congress]] of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which authorized federal oversight of voter registration and election practices and other enforcement of voting rights. Congress passed the legislation because it found \"case by case litigation was inadequate to combat widespread and persistent discrimination in voting\". Activism by African Americans helped secure an expanded and protected franchise that has benefited all Americans, including racial and language minorities.\n\nThe bill provided for federal oversight, if necessary, to ensure just voter registration and election procedures. The rate of African-American registration and voting in Southern states climbed dramatically and quickly, but it has taken years of federal oversight to work out the processes and overcome local resistance. In addition, it was not until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in ''[[Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections]]'' (1966) that all state poll taxes (for state elections) were officially declared unconstitutional as violating the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the Fourteenth Amendment. This removed a burden on the poor.<ref name=Scher2015>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=POzqBgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA13&pg=PR9#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Politics of Disenfranchisement: Why is it So Hard to Vote in America?|last=Scher|first=Richard K.|date=2015|page=viii-ix|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317455363}}</ref><ref name=NHLTS2009>{{Cite paper|date=2009|title=Civil Rights in America: Racial Voting Rights|url=https://www.nps.gov/nhl/learn/themes/CivilRights_VotingRights.pdf|journal=|publisher=A National Historic Landmarks Theme Study}}</ref>\n\nLegal challenges have continued under the Voting Rights Act, primarily in areas of redistricting and election systems, for instance, challenging [[at-large]] election systems that effectively reduce the ability of minority groups to elect candidates of their choice. Such challenges have particularly occurred at the county and municipal level, including for school boards, where exclusion of minority groups and candidates at such levels has been persistent in some areas of the country. This reduces the ability of women and minorities to participate in the political system and gain entry-level experience.\n\n=== Women ===\n\n{{See also|Women's suffrage in the United States}}\n\nA parallel, yet separate, movement was that for [[women's suffrage]]. Leaders of the suffrage movement included [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], and [[Alice Paul]]. In some ways this, too, could be said to have grown out of the [[American Civil War]], as women had been strong leaders of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] movement. Middle- and upper-class women generally became more politically active in the northern tier during and after the war.\n\nIn 1848, the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first [[women's rights]] convention, was held in [[Seneca Falls, New York]]. Of the 300 present, 68 women and 32 men signed the [[Declaration of Sentiments]] which defined the women's rights movement. The first [[National Women's Rights Convention]] took place in 1850 in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], attracting more than 1,000 participants. This national convention was held yearly through 1860.\n\nWhen Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton formed the National Women Suffrage Association, their goal was to help women gain voting rights through reliance on the Constitution. Also, in 1869 [[Lucy Stone]] and [[Henry Browne Blackwell|Henry Blackwell]] formed the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA). However, AWSA focused on gaining voting rights for women through the amendment process. Although these two organization were fighting for the same cause, it was not until 1890 that they merged to form the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA). After the merger of the two organizations, the (NAWSA) waged a state-by-state campaign to obtain voting rights for women.\n\n[[Wyoming]] was the first state in which women were able to vote, although it was a condition of the transition to statehood. [[Utah]] was the second territory to allow women to vote, but the federal [[Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act]] of 1887 repealed woman's suffrage in Utah. Colorado was the first established state to allow women to vote on the same basis as men. Some other states also extended the franchise to women before the Constitution was amended to this purpose.\n\nDuring the 1910s Alice Paul, assisted by [[Lucy Burns]] and many others, organized such events and organizations as the [[1913 Women's Suffrage Parade]], the [[National Woman's Party]], and the [[Silent Sentinels]]. At the culmination of the suffragists' requests and protests, ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment gave women the right to vote in time to participate in the [[President of the United States|Presidential]] election of [[US Presidential election, 1920|1920]].\n\nAnother political movement that was largely driven by women in the same era was the anti-[[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] [[Temperance movement]], which led to the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] and [[Prohibition]].<ref>{{cite web|last=alio|first=nur|title=women|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/womenstimeline1.html|publisher=Women's Rights Movement in the U.S.|accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Washington, D.C. ===\n\n[[Washington, D.C.]], was created from a portion of the states of Maryland and Virginia in 1801. The Virginia portion was [[Cession|retroceded]] (returned) to Virginia upon request of the residents, by an Act of Congress in 1846 to protect slavery, and restore state and federal voting rights in that portion of Virginia. When Maryland delegated a portion of its land to Congress so it could be used as the Nation's capital, Congress did not continue Maryland Voting Laws. It canceled all state and federal elections starting with 1802. Local elections limped on in some neighborhoods, until 1871, when local elections were also forbidden by the U.S. Congress. The U.S. Congress is the National Legislature. Under Article&nbsp;I, Section&nbsp;8, Clause 17, Congress has the sole authority to exercise \"Exclusive Legislature in all cases whatsoever\" over the nation's capital and over federal military bases. Active disfranchisement is typically a States Rights Legislative issue, where the removal of voting rights is permitted. At the national level, the federal government typically ignored voting rights issues, or affirmed that they were extended.\n\nCongress, when exercising \"exclusive legislation\" over U.S. Military Bases in the United States, and Washington, D.C., viewed its power as strong enough to remove all voting rights. All state and federal elections were canceled by Congress in D.C. and all of Maryland's voting Rights laws no longer applied to D.C. when Maryland gave up that land. Congress did not pass laws to establish local voting processes in the District of Columbia. This omission of law strategy to disfranchise is contained in the Congressional debates in Annals of Congress in 1800 and 1801.\n\nIn 1986, the US Congress voted to restore voting rights on U.S. Military bases for all state and federal elections.\n\nD.C. citizens were granted the right to vote in Presidential elections in 1961 after ratification of the Twenty-third Amendment. The citizens and territory converted in 1801 were represented by [[John Chew Thomas]] from Maryland's 2nd, and [[William Craik (politician)|William Craik]] from Maryland's 3rd Congressional Districts, which were redrawn and removed from the city.\n\nNo full Congressional elections have been held since in D.C., a gap continuing since 1801. Congress created a non-voting substitute for a U.S. Congressman, a Delegate, between 1871\u20131875, but then abolished that post as well. Congress permitted restoration of local elections and [[home rule]] for the District on December 24, 1973. In 1971, Congress still opposed restoring the position of a full U.S. Congressman for Washington, D.C.

By the early 21st century, there have been numerous court cases to help protect the voting rights of persons without a fixed address. Low income and homeless citizens face some obstacles in registering to vote. These obstacles include establishing residency, providing a mailing address, and showing proof of identification. A residency requirement varies from state to state. States cannot require citizens to show residency of more than 30 days before Election Day. The states of Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming allow voters to register on Election Day. North Dakota does not require voters to register.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barder|title=American Government and Politics Today|year=2011\u20132012|publisher=Suzanne Jeans|page=313}}</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, homeless persons in all states have the right to register and vote if they satisfy other conditions. In most states, when registering to vote, homeless voters may designate any place of residence, including a street corner, a park, a shelter, or any other location where an individual stays at night. A citizen may have only one residency during registration, but they may switch their registration each time they change locations.<ref>[https://www.fvap.gov/info/laws/voting-residency-guidelines \"Voting Residency Guidelines\"], [[Federal Voting Assistance Program]]</ref> Designating residency is needed to prove that the citizen lives within the district where he or she wishes to vote. Some states also require a mailing address in order to send out the voter ID card, which the individual must show on Election Day. Some states allow individuals to use PO Boxes as mailing addresses; other states allow the address to be that of a local shelter, advocacy organization, outreach center, or anywhere else that accepts mail on behalf of a person registering to vote. States such as Arizona and Nebraska allow homeless citizens to use county court houses or county clerks' offices as mailing address.\n\nStates that do not require a mailing address include Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Montana, New Jersey, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.<ref>[http://www.nationalhomeless.org/projects/vote/Manual_2011.pdf]</ref>\n\nAll potential voters face new requirements since 2002, when President Bush signed the [[Help America Vote Act]] (HAVA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eac.gov/about_the_eac/help_america_vote_act.aspx |title=Help America Vote Act of 2002, HAVA &#124; The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) |publisher= Election Assistance Commission |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act |title=Help America Vote Act |publisher=OpenCongress Wiki |accessdate=2013-06-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625083933/http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act |archivedate=2013-06-25 }}</ref> It requires voters to provide their [[Driver's license in the United States|driver's license numbers]], or the last four digits of their [[Social Security Number]] on their voter registration form. This has been enforced.\n\n[[The National Coalition for the Homeless]] (NCH) assists nonprofit organizations, in getting lower income and homeless citizens registered to vote. In 1992, the NCH created a campaign called \"You don't need a home to vote\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/legislative/homeless.html |title=Protect Homeless and their Right to Vote |access-date=2011-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406111350/http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/legislative/homeless.html |archive-date=2012-04-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This campaign provided useful resources and guidelines for nonprofit organizations to follow when assisting citizens to register. Nonprofits, like homeless shelters and [[food bank]]s, set up a voter registration party to help homeless citizens to register. The nonprofit workers must remain nonpartisan when assisting in the registration process.\n\n==== Court cases involving homeless voting ====\n\nVoting rights of the American homeless is an issue that has been addressed in the courts since the 1980s. Each state is responsible for voting regulations in their area; however, many states throughout America have adopted similar laws regarding homeless citizen voting. Disenfranchising the homeless is considered a violation of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment's [[Equal Protection Clause]]. Many arguments have been made against homeless people being able to vote. Their status of true citizenship has been called into question because of their lack of residency. However, the courts have ruled on more than one occasion in favor of the homeless voting.\n\nOne of the first court cases regarding homeless voting was ''Pitts v. Black'' (1984) in the US District Court of Southern New York, which ruled that disenfranchising homeless citizens is a direct violation of the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case involved the New York Election Board and homeless individuals assisted by the [[Coalition for the Homeless]], among others. The Election Board denied the individuals the right to vote because they resided on the street or in shelters. The Election Board contended that residency required some claim (such as rent) or ownership of the area on which they resided.<ref name=\"members.fortunecity.com\">{{cite web|title=''Marthaann E.

Menzel'', and ''Walters v. Weed'', also addressed the residency question of homeless voters:\n* ''Collier v. Menzel'' (1985): The Santa Barbara District Court case established that a residence could be a certain location rather than a specific address. Howard Menzel, the county clerk, rejected three voter registration applications on the grounds that proper addresses were not provided. The applications simply stated a public park as the applicants' residence. The court overruled the clerk's decision and defined a residence as any fixed location where a person habitually sleeps and where living quarters are set up. In their final decisions, the court stated that denying a citizen the right to vote due to residence in a public park, is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection clause.<ref name=\"nationalhomeless.org\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=''Collier v.

Property restrictions, duration of residency restrictions, and, for school boards, restrictions of the franchise to voters with children, remained in force. In a series of rulings from 1969 to 1973, the Court ruled that the franchise could be restricted in some cases to those \"primarily interested\" or \"primarily affected\" by the outcome of a specialized election, but not in the case of school boards or bond issues, which affected taxation to be paid by all residents.<ref name=\"justia voter\">{{Citation\n|url=http://supreme.justia.com/constitution/amendment-14/92-voter-qualifications.html\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031112234/http://supreme.justia.com/constitution/amendment-14/92-voter-qualifications.html\n|archivedate=2006-10-31\n|title=U.S. Constitution Annotated\n|accessdate=2008-04-18\n|publisher=Justia}}</ref> In ''Ball v.

While states were permitted to require voters to register for a political party 30 days before an election, or to require them to vote in only one party primary, the state could not prevent a voter from voting in a party primary if the voter has voted in another party's primary in the last 23 months.<ref name=\"justia voter\" /> The Court also ruled that a state may not mandate a \"closed primary\" system and bar independents from voting in a party's primary against the wishes of the party.

The Supreme Court of the United States struck down the franchise restriction under the Fifteenth Amendment in ''[[Rice v.

State of Hawai'i'' a few months later.\n\n== Current status by region ==\n\n=== District of Columbia ===\n\n{{Main|District of Columbia voting rights}}\n\nCitizens of the nation's capital, [[Washington, D.C.]], have not been apportioned a representative or US senator in Congress. This is because D.C. is a federal district and not a state and, under the Constitution, only states are apportioned congresspersons.\n\nDistrict of Columbia citizens had voting rights removed in 1801 by Congress, when Maryland delegated that portion of its land to Congress. Congress incrementally removed effective local control or [[home rule]] by 1871. It restored some home rule in 1971, but maintained the authority to override any local laws. Washington, D.C., does not have full representation in the U.S. House or Senate. The Twenty-third Amendment, restoring U.S. Presidential Election after a 164-year-gap, is the only known limit to Congressional \"exclusive legislature\" from Article I-8-17, forcing Congress to enforce for the first time Amendments 14, 15, 19, 24, and 26. It gave the District of Columbia three [[U.S. Electoral College|electors]] and hence the right to vote for [[President of the United States|President]], but not full U.S. Congresspersons nor U.S. Senators. In 1978, another amendment was proposed which would have restored to the District a full seat, but it failed to receive ratification by a sufficient number of states within the seven years required.\n\n{{as of|2013}}, [[District of Columbia voting rights#Proposal during administration of Barack Obama|a bill]] is pending in Congress that would treat the District of Columbia as \"a congressional district for purposes of representation in the House of Representatives\", and permit United States citizens residing in the capital to vote for a member to represent them in the House of Representatives.

The petition indicated that it was presented on behalf of the members of the Statehood Solidarity Committee and all other U.S. citizens resident in the District of Columbia. The petition alleged that the United States was responsible for violations of Articles&nbsp;II (right to equality before law) and XX (right to vote and to participate in government) of the [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]] in connection with the inability of citizens of the District of Columbia to vote for and elect a representative to the U.S. Congress. On December 29, 2003, The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights having examined the information and arguments provided by the parties on the question of admissibility.

This grows out of [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article&nbsp;I]] and [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article&nbsp;II]] of the [[United States Constitution]], which specifically mandate that electors are to be chosen by \"the People of the several States\". In 1961, the Twenty-third Amendment extended the right to choose electors to the District of Columbia.\n\nAny [[U.S. citizen]] who resides in Puerto Rico (whether a [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] or not) is effectively disenfranchised at the national level. Although the Republican Party and Democratic Party chapters in Puerto Rico have selected voting delegates to the national nominating conventions participating in U.S. presidential primaries or caucuses, U.S. citizens not residing in one of the 50 states or in the District of Columbia may not vote in federal elections.\n\nVarious scholars (including a prominent U.S. judge in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]]) conclude that the U.S. national-electoral process is not fully democratic due to U.S. government disenfranchisement of U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico.<ref>Torruella, Juan R.

Judge [[Kermit Lipez]] wrote in a concurring opinion, however, that the [[en banc]] majority's conclusion that the ICCPR is non-self-executing is ripe for reconsideration in a new en banc proceeding, and that if issues highlighted in a partial dissent by Judge [[Juan R.

See U.S. Constitutional Amendment\u2002XXIII.51.\u2002Indeed, a bill is now pending in Congress that would treat the District of Columbia as \"a congressional district for purposes of representation in the House of Representatives\", and permit United States citizens residing in the capitol to vote for members of the House of Representatives. See District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act, S.160, 111th Congress (passed by the Senate, February 26, 2009) (2009).52 \u2002However, the United States has not taken similar \"steps\" with regard to the five million United States citizens who reside in the other U.S. territories, of which close to four million are residents of Puerto Rico. This inaction is in clear violation of the United States' obligations under the ICCPR\".<ref name=iguartia />\n\n== Accessibility ==\n\nFederal legislation such as the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA), the [[National Voter Registration Act of 1993]] (NVRA, or \"Motor-Voter Act\") and the Help America Vote Act of 2001 (HAVA) help to address some of the concerns of disabled and non-English speaking voters in the United States.\n\nSome studies have shown that polling places are inaccessible to disabled voters.<ref name=\"accessiblesociety.org\">{{cite web|last=alio|first=nur|title=People with Disabilities and Voting|url=http://www.accessiblesociety.org/topics/voting/|publisher=The Center for an Accessible Society|accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref> The [[Federal Election Commission]] reported that, in violation of state and federal laws, more than 20,000 polling places across the nation are inaccessible, depriving people with disabilities of their fundamental right to vote.\n\nIn 1999, the Attorney General of the State of New York ran a check of polling places around the state to see if they were accessible to voters with disabilities and found many problems. A study of three upstate counties of New York found fewer than 10 percent of polling places fully compliant with state and federal laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/polling-places-found-inaccessible-disabled|title=Polling Places Found Inaccessible To Disabled|last=|first=|date=1999-11-01|website=New York State Attorney General|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}</ref>\n\nMany polling booths are set in church basements or in upstairs meeting halls where there are no ramps or elevators. This means problems not just for people who use [[wheelchair]]s, but for people using canes or walkers too. And in most states people who are blind do not have access to [[Braille]] ballot to vote; they have to bring someone along to vote for them. Studies have shown that people with disabilities are more interested in government and public affairs than most and are more eager to participate in the democratic process.\n<ref name=\"accessiblesociety.org\" /> Many election officials urge people with disabilities to vote absentee, however some disabled individuals see this as an inferior form of participation.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?inPS=true&prodId=GVRL&userGroupName=txshracd2602&resultListType=RELATED_DOCUMENT&contentSegment=9781412927130&isBOBIndex=true&docId=GALE&#124;CX3469300622#1272|title = Encyclopedia of Disability|date = 2006|access-date = |website = |publisher = SAGE Reference|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nVoter turnout is lower among the disabled. In the [[2012 United States presidential election]] 56.8% of people with disabilities reported voting, compared to the 62.5% of eligible citizens without disabilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://smlr.rutgers.edu/disability-and-voting-survey-report-2012-elections|title = Disability and Voting Survey Report 2012 Election|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = Rutgers University|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n== Candidacy requirements ==\n\nJurisprudence concerning candidacy rights and the rights of citizens to create a political party are less clear than voting rights. Different courts have reached different conclusions regarding what sort of restrictions, often in terms of [[ballot access]], public debate inclusion, filing fees, and residency requirements, may be imposed.\n\nIn ''[[Williams v. Rhodes]]'' (1968), the United States Supreme Court struck down [[Ohio]] ballot access laws on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and Fourteenth Amendment grounds. However, it subsequently upheld such laws in several other cases. States can require an independent or minor party candidate to collect signatures as high as five percent of the total votes cast in a particular preceding election before the court will intervene.\n\nThe Supreme Court has also upheld a state ban on cross-party endorsements (also known as [[electoral fusion]]) and primary write-in votes.\n\n== Noncitizen voting ==\n\n{{Main|Right of foreigners to vote in the United States}}\n\nMore than 40 states or territories, including colonies before the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], have at some time allowed noncitizens who satisfied residential requirements to vote in some or all elections. This in part reflected the strong continuing immigration to the United States. Some cities like [[Chicago]], towns or villages (in Maryland) today allow noncitizen residents to vote in school or local elections.<ref name=raskin1993>{{Citation\n|url = http://www.sou.edu/polisci/pavlich/Raskin_Aliens.htm\n|title=Legal aliens, local citizens: The historical, constitutional and theoretical meanings of Alien suffrage\n|first=Jamin B.\n|last=Raskin\n|author-link=Jamie Raskin\n|publisher=Southern Oregon University\n|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review\n|volume=141\n|issue=4\n|date=April 1993\n|pages=1391\u20131470\n|accessdate=2007-12-03\n|doi=10.2307/3312345\n|format=<sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=author%3ARaskin+intitle%3ALegal+aliens%2C+local+citizens%3A+The+historical%2C+constitutional+and+theoretical+meanings+of+Alien+suffrage&as_publication=University+of+Pennsylvania+Law+Review&as_ylo=1993&as_yhi=1993&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup>\n|jstor=3312345\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081103002119/http://www.sou.edu/polisci/pavlich/Raskin_Aliens.htm\n|archivedate=2008-11-03 }}</ref><ref name=\"williamson1960\" /><ref name=hayduk2006>{{Citation\n|title=Democracy For All: Restoring Immigrant Voting Rights In The United States\n|first=Ronald\n|last=Hayduk\n|publisher=Routledge\n|year=2006\n|isbn=978-0-415-95073-2 }}</ref><ref group=\"Note\">See also [[:fr:Droit de vote des \u00e9trangers aux \u00c9tats-Unis|Droit de vote des \u00e9trangers aux \u00c9tats-Unis]] {{in lang|fr}}.</ref> In 1875, the Supreme Court in ''[[Minor v.
