The area was chosen near to [[Dubai]], to attract passengers from the city of Dubai, rather than travel to the busier [[Sharjah International Airport]]. The planned location originally was [[Jebel Ali]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airport-technology.com/features/feature1741/feature1741-2.html |title=As a response to soaring passenger numbers, major airport expansion projects are taking place throughout the UAE. |publisher=Airport Technology |accessdate=16 July 2009}}{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe original master plan for the existing airport initially involved a dual-terminal and one runway configuration over two phases with provisions for another two passenger terminals in the near future. Phase 1 included the construction for the first passenger terminal, the first runway, 70 aircraft parking bays, support facilities and structures, including a large maintenance [[hangar]], the first fire station, workshops and administrative offices, an airfreight complex, two cargo agents' buildings, in-flight catering kitchens and a {{convert|87|m|abbr=on}} [[Air traffic control|control tower]]. Construction for the second phase would commence immediately after the completion of Phase 1 and include the second runway, 50 new aircraft parking bays in addition to the existing 70 bays, a second fire station and a third cargo agent building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://old.projectsmonitor.com/detailnews.asp?newsid=14744 |title=$82 bn earmarked for Dubai airport expansion |publisher=Projectsmonitor.com |date=22 October 2007 |accessdate=16 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123910/http://old.projectsmonitor.com/detailnews.asp?newsid=14744 |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nThe third phase included construction of a new terminal (now the parts of Terminal 1's main building and Concourse C) and an additional 60 parking bays, as well as new aircraft maintenance facility. Then, in the early 2000s (decade) a new master plan was introduced which began the development of the current concourses and terminal infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://travel.theemiratesnetwork.com/airports/dubai.php |title=Dubai International Airport [DXB/OMDB&#93; \u2013 TEN Travel & Tourism [UAE&#93; |publisher=Travel.theemiratesnetwork.com |accessdate=16 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125185212/http://travel.theemiratesnetwork.com/airports/dubai.php |archivedate=25 November 2010  }}</ref>\n\nPaul Griffiths (Dubai Airports' CEO) in his interview to ''[[Vision (magazine)|Vision]]'' magazine, cited plans to build infrastructure to support the expansion of Emirates and budget airline flydubai, and ascend the ranks of global aviation hubs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vision.ae/en/special_report/delivering_the_vision_dubai_international_airport|title=Dubai Airport \u2013 Delivering the vision...

Terminals 1 and 3 are directly connected with a common transit area, with airside passengers being able to move freely between the terminals without going through immigration, while Terminal 2 is on the opposite side of the airport. For transiting passengers, a shuttle service runs between the terminals, with a journey time of around 20 minutes from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1 and 30 minutes to Terminal 3. Passengers in Terminal 3 who need to transfer between concourse A and the rest of the Terminal have to travel via an automated [[people mover]]. Also after early 2016 when the construction of Concourse D was done, there is now an automated people mover between concourse D and Terminal 1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsbombardier-build-automated-people-mover-system-dubai-airport|title=Bombardier to build automated people mover system at Dubai Airport|accessdate=1 June 2015}}{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}</ref>\n\nSituated beside Terminal 2 is the Executive Flights Terminal, which has its own [[Airport check-in|check-in]] facilities for premium passengers and where transportation to aircraft in any of the other terminals is by personal buggy.\n\nThe three passenger terminals have a total handling capacity of around 80&nbsp;million passengers a year.\n\nTerminals 1 and 3 cater to international passengers, whilst Terminal 2 is for budget passengers and passengers flying to the subcontinent and Persian Gulf region; Terminals 1 and 3 handle 85% of the passenger traffic and the Executive Flights terminal is for the higher-end travellers and important guests.\n\n====Terminal 1====\nTerminal 1 has a capacity of 15 million passengers. It is used by over 100 airlines and is connected to Concourse D by an automated people mover. It is spread over an area of {{convert|520000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} and offers 221 check-in counters.\n\nThe Terminal was originally built to handle 18 million passengers; however, with extreme congestion at the terminal, the airport was forced to expand the terminal to accommodate with the opening of 28 remote gates. Over the years, more mobile gates were added to the airport bringing the total as of 2010 to 28.\n\nIn 2013, Dubai Airports announced a major renovation for Terminal 1 and Concourse C. The renovations include upgraded baggage systems, replacement of check-in desks and a more spacious departure hall. Arrivals will also see improvements to help reduce waiting times. The renovation was completed by the middle of 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/major-renovations-planned-for-dubai-airports-terminal-1|title=Major renovations planned for Dubai Airport's Terminal 1|author=Ramola Talwar Badam|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n;Concourse D\nPlanning begun for further expansion of Dubai Airport, with the construction of Terminal 4, it was revealed on the day Emirates completed its phased operations at the new Terminal 3, on 14 November 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/538287-dubai-airports-no-decision-yet-on-terminal-4|title=Dubai Airports: No decision yet on Terminal 4|publisher=ArabianBusiness.com|date=15 November 2008|accessdate=16 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206045621/http://www.arabianbusiness.com/538287-dubai-airports-no-decision-yet-on-terminal-4|archive-date=6 December 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nAccording to Dubai Airport officials, plans for Terminal 4 had begun and extensions would be made to Terminal 3.

It also will see [[The Emirates Group|Emirates]] take over the operation at Concourse C, along with concourse A and B which it will already be operating. All remaining airlines will shift to Concourse D, or move to [[Al Maktoum International Airport]]. The airport projects that international passenger and cargo traffic will increase at an average annual growth rate of 7.2% and 6.7%, respectively, and that by 2020 passenger numbers at Dubai International Airport will reach 98.5 million and cargo volumes will top 4.1 million tonnes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/business/aviation/dubai-airports-to-launch-plans-for-concourse-4-this-year-1.802950?localLinksEnabled=false |title=Dubai Airports to launch plans for Concourse 4 this year |publisher=gulfnews |date=4 May 2011|accessdate=23 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nConcourse D will have a capacity of 15 million passengers, include 17 gates and will be connected to Terminal 1 via an automated people mover.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.zawya.com/story/Dubai_Airport_to_handle_200_million_passengers_by_2030-ZAWYA20150313034436/ |title=Dubai Airport to handle 200 million passengers by 2030 |publisher=Zawya |date=12 March 2015 |accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref> On 6 February 2016, members of the public were invited to trial the concourse in preparation for its opening.

Dubai Airport also invested $3.5 billion into a new Concourse A, exclusively for handling Emirates A380s. With the changes made, the airport does not expect embarking and disembarking passengers and baggage from the A380 to take longer than it does for Boeing 747-400s, which carry fewer passengers. On 16 July 2008, Dubai Airport unveiled the first of two specially-built gates capable of handling the aircraft. Costing $10 million, the gates will enable passengers to get on the upper cabin of the new 555-seater aircraft directly from the gate hold rooms. The hold rooms themselves have been enlarged to cater for the larger number of passengers flying the A380s. In addition to the two gates at Terminal 1, five more A380-capable gates were opened at concourse B on 14 October 2008.

The area was chosen near to [[Dubai]], to attract passengers from the city of Dubai, rather than travel to the busier [[Sharjah International Airport]]. The planned location originally was [[Jebel Ali]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airport-technology.com/features/feature1741/feature1741-2.html |title=As a response to soaring passenger numbers, major airport expansion projects are taking place throughout the UAE. |publisher=Airport Technology |accessdate=16 July 2009}}{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe original master plan for the existing airport initially involved a dual-terminal and one runway configuration over two phases with provisions for another two passenger terminals in the near future. Phase 1 included the construction for the first passenger terminal, the first runway, 70 aircraft parking bays, support facilities and structures, including a large maintenance [[hangar]], the first fire station, workshops and administrative offices, an airfreight complex, two cargo agents' buildings, in-flight catering kitchens and a {{convert|87|m|abbr=on}} [[Air traffic control|control tower]]. Construction for the second phase would commence immediately after the completion of Phase 1 and include the second runway, 50 new aircraft parking bays in addition to the existing 70 bays, a second fire station and a third cargo agent building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://old.projectsmonitor.com/detailnews.asp?newsid=14744 |title=$82 bn earmarked for Dubai airport expansion |publisher=Projectsmonitor.com |date=22 October 2007 |accessdate=16 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123910/http://old.projectsmonitor.com/detailnews.asp?newsid=14744 |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nThe third phase included construction of a new terminal (now the parts of Terminal 1's main building and Concourse C) and an additional 60 parking bays, as well as new aircraft maintenance facility. Then, in the early 2000s (decade) a new master plan was introduced which began the development of the current concourses and terminal infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://travel.theemiratesnetwork.com/airports/dubai.php |title=Dubai International Airport [DXB/OMDB&#93; \u2013 TEN Travel & Tourism [UAE&#93; |publisher=Travel.theemiratesnetwork.com |accessdate=16 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125185212/http://travel.theemiratesnetwork.com/airports/dubai.php |archivedate=25 November 2010  }}</ref>\n\nPaul Griffiths (Dubai Airports' CEO) in his interview to ''[[Vision (magazine)|Vision]]'' magazine, cited plans to build infrastructure to support the expansion of Emirates and budget airline flydubai, and ascend the ranks of global aviation hubs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vision.ae/en/special_report/delivering_the_vision_dubai_international_airport|title=Dubai Airport \u2013 Delivering the vision...

Terminal 1 has one concourse (concourse D), Terminal 2 is set apart from the other two main buildings and Terminal 3 is divided into Concourse A, B, and C.

Terminals 1 and 3 are directly connected with a common transit area, with airside passengers being able to move freely between the terminals without going through immigration, while Terminal 2 is on the opposite side of the airport. For transiting passengers, a shuttle service runs between the terminals, with a journey time of around 20 minutes from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1 and 30 minutes to Terminal 3. Passengers in Terminal 3 who need to transfer between concourse A and the rest of the Terminal have to travel via an automated [[people mover]]. Also after early 2016 when the construction of Concourse D was done, there is now an automated people mover between concourse D and Terminal 1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsbombardier-build-automated-people-mover-system-dubai-airport|title=Bombardier to build automated people mover system at Dubai Airport|accessdate=1 June 2015}}{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}</ref>\n\nSituated beside Terminal 2 is the Executive Flights Terminal, which has its own [[Airport check-in|check-in]] facilities for premium passengers and where transportation to aircraft in any of the other terminals is by personal buggy.\n\nThe three passenger terminals have a total handling capacity of around 80&nbsp;million passengers a year.\n\nTerminals 1 and 3 cater to international passengers, whilst Terminal 2 is for budget passengers and passengers flying to the subcontinent and Persian Gulf region; Terminals 1 and 3 handle 85% of the passenger traffic and the Executive Flights terminal is for the higher-end travellers and important guests.\n\n====Terminal 1====\nTerminal 1 has a capacity of 15 million passengers. It is used by over 100 airlines and is connected to Concourse D by an automated people mover. It is spread over an area of {{convert|520000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} and offers 221 check-in counters.\n\nThe Terminal was originally built to handle 18 million passengers; however, with extreme congestion at the terminal, the airport was forced to expand the terminal to accommodate with the opening of 28 remote gates. Over the years, more mobile gates were added to the airport bringing the total as of 2010 to 28.\n\nIn 2013, Dubai Airports announced a major renovation for Terminal 1 and Concourse C. The renovations include upgraded baggage systems, replacement of check-in desks and a more spacious departure hall. Arrivals will also see improvements to help reduce waiting times. The renovation was completed by the middle of 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/major-renovations-planned-for-dubai-airports-terminal-1|title=Major renovations planned for Dubai Airport's Terminal 1|author=Ramola Talwar Badam|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n;Concourse D\nPlanning begun for further expansion of Dubai Airport, with the construction of Terminal 4, it was revealed on the day Emirates completed its phased operations at the new Terminal 3, on 14 November 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/538287-dubai-airports-no-decision-yet-on-terminal-4|title=Dubai Airports: No decision yet on Terminal 4|publisher=ArabianBusiness.com|date=15 November 2008|accessdate=16 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206045621/http://www.arabianbusiness.com/538287-dubai-airports-no-decision-yet-on-terminal-4|archive-date=6 December 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nAccording to Dubai Airport officials, plans for Terminal 4 had begun and extensions would be made to Terminal 3.

It also will see [[The Emirates Group|Emirates]] take over the operation at Concourse C, along with concourse A and B which it will already be operating. All remaining airlines will shift to Concourse D, or move to [[Al Maktoum International Airport]]. The airport projects that international passenger and cargo traffic will increase at an average annual growth rate of 7.2% and 6.7%, respectively, and that by 2020 passenger numbers at Dubai International Airport will reach 98.5 million and cargo volumes will top 4.1 million tonnes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/business/aviation/dubai-airports-to-launch-plans-for-concourse-4-this-year-1.802950?localLinksEnabled=false |title=Dubai Airports to launch plans for Concourse 4 this year |publisher=gulfnews |date=4 May 2011|accessdate=23 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nConcourse D will have a capacity of 15 million passengers, include 17 gates and will be connected to Terminal 1 via an automated people mover.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.zawya.com/story/Dubai_Airport_to_handle_200_million_passengers_by_2030-ZAWYA20150313034436/ |title=Dubai Airport to handle 200 million passengers by 2030 |publisher=Zawya |date=12 March 2015 |accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref> On 6 February 2016, members of the public were invited to trial the concourse in preparation for its opening.

Dubai Airport also invested $3.5 billion into a new Concourse A, exclusively for handling Emirates A380s. With the changes made, the airport does not expect embarking and disembarking passengers and baggage from the A380 to take longer than it does for Boeing 747-400s, which carry fewer passengers. On 16 July 2008, Dubai Airport unveiled the first of two specially-built gates capable of handling the aircraft. Costing $10 million, the gates will enable passengers to get on the upper cabin of the new 555-seater aircraft directly from the gate hold rooms. The hold rooms themselves have been enlarged to cater for the larger number of passengers flying the A380s. In addition to the two gates at Terminal 1, five more A380-capable gates were opened at concourse B on 14 October 2008.

It is the second busiest airport of the country in terms of the volume of passengers served annually.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nThe airport opened for civil aviation in 1964. The Balice airport was a military site until 28 February 1968. Four years later the first passenger terminal was built there.\n\nIn 1988 the authorities decided to build a new terminal that was opened for public use in 1993. In 1995, the entire apron was modernized.\n\nIn 1995 the airport's name was changed from Krak\u00f3w\u2013Balice Airport to John Paul II International Airport Krak\u00f3w\u2013Balice, to honor [[Pope John Paul II]], who spent many years of his life in Krak\u00f3w and had served as [[Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w]] from 1963 until his elevation to the Papacy in 1978. For marketing reasons, the official name was further \"streamlined\" on 4 September 2007 as ''Krak\u00f3w Airport im. Jana Paw\u0142a II''.\n\n===Development since the 2000s===\nThe airport was modernized once more in 2002, and since then new international connections have been established.\n\nIn 2003, when [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] low-cost carrier [[Ryanair]] became interested in starting a service from the John Paul II International Airport, the airport authorities refused to reduce the [[landing fee]]s. In response, the regional authorities of Krak\u00f3w and [[Lesser Poland Voivodeship]] decided to build a new airport near the existing one, using the infrastructure of the military airbase adjacent to the shared runway. Finally an agreement was reached, and the existing airport was opened to Ryanair and other low-cost carriers such as [[Germanwings]], [[EasyJet]], and [[Centralwings]].\n\nOn 1 March 2007, a separate domestic terminal (T2) was opened. At that time, plans were underway to begin construction of a new terminal.\n\nA seven-story parking garage opposite T1 became fully operational in May 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2012.org.pl/pl/miasta-gospodarze/krakow/aktualnoci/14111-na-lotnisku-w-krakowie-powstaje-wielopoziomowy-parking.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111054249/http://www.2012.org.pl/pl/miasta-gospodarze/krakow/aktualnoci/14111-na-lotnisku-w-krakowie-powstaje-wielopoziomowy-parking.html|title=Na lotnisku w Krakowie powstaje wielopoziomowy parking |language=Polish |publisher=www.2012.org.pl |date=2009-12-18 |archivedate=2010-01-11 |accessdate=2011-09-11}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 December 2012, Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair announced it would be opening its second Polish base in Krak\u00f3w basing two [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800]] aircraft at the airport from 31 March 2013, which allows the carrier to increase the number of the routes from Krak\u00f3w to 31.\n\nKrak\u00f3w Airport is the second busiest airport in the country after [[Warsaw Chopin Airport]]. The airport has good growth prospects, as almost 8 million people live within {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} of it. The airport also has a favorable location on the network of existing and planned [[motorway]]s in this region of Poland.\n\n==Facilities==\n===Terminal===\n11 April 2013 saw the beginning of construction works of a new airport terminal, which is adjacent to the existing old terminal building. The works on the new terminal were completed in December 2016. The terminal serves all-year-round, 24 hours a day, both domestic as well as international flights. The expected maximum capacity of the terminal is up to 8 million passengers handled in a year (over twice as much as the airport served in 2012).

Normal city tariff applies thus making it by far the cheapest public transport connection to the city centre, at 4.60z\u0142 (allowing for bus/tram transfers within 50 minutes from boarding). Public buses can be used after purchasing tickets from a ticket machine located in the arrival hall, at the bus stop (with cash or credit card) or from ticket machines that can be found in most buses (sometimes with either coins or card only). All tickets have to be validated after getting on a bus. It is also possible to use private-owned bus and minibus services connecting the airport with the city center or other cities in Poland.

It is the second busiest airport of the country in terms of the volume of passengers served annually.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nThe airport opened for civil aviation in 1964. The Balice airport was a military site until 28 February 1968. Four years later the first passenger terminal was built there.\n\nIn 1988 the authorities decided to build a new terminal that was opened for public use in 1993. In 1995, the entire apron was modernized.\n\nIn 1995 the airport's name was changed from Krak\u00f3w\u2013Balice Airport to John Paul II International Airport Krak\u00f3w\u2013Balice, to honor [[Pope John Paul II]], who spent many years of his life in Krak\u00f3w and had served as [[Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w]] from 1963 until his elevation to the Papacy in 1978. For marketing reasons, the official name was further \"streamlined\" on 4 September 2007 as ''Krak\u00f3w Airport im. Jana Paw\u0142a II''.\n\n===Development since the 2000s===\nThe airport was modernized once more in 2002, and since then new international connections have been established.\n\nIn 2003, when [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] low-cost carrier [[Ryanair]] became interested in starting a service from the John Paul II International Airport, the airport authorities refused to reduce the [[landing fee]]s. In response, the regional authorities of Krak\u00f3w and [[Lesser Poland Voivodeship]] decided to build a new airport near the existing one, using the infrastructure of the military airbase adjacent to the shared runway. Finally an agreement was reached, and the existing airport was opened to Ryanair and other low-cost carriers such as [[Germanwings]], [[EasyJet]], and [[Centralwings]].\n\nOn 1 March 2007, a separate domestic terminal (T2) was opened. At that time, plans were underway to begin construction of a new terminal.\n\nA seven-story parking garage opposite T1 became fully operational in May 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2012.org.pl/pl/miasta-gospodarze/krakow/aktualnoci/14111-na-lotnisku-w-krakowie-powstaje-wielopoziomowy-parking.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111054249/http://www.2012.org.pl/pl/miasta-gospodarze/krakow/aktualnoci/14111-na-lotnisku-w-krakowie-powstaje-wielopoziomowy-parking.html|title=Na lotnisku w Krakowie powstaje wielopoziomowy parking |language=Polish |publisher=www.2012.org.pl |date=2009-12-18 |archivedate=2010-01-11 |accessdate=2011-09-11}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 December 2012, Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair announced it would be opening its second Polish base in Krak\u00f3w basing two [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800]] aircraft at the airport from 31 March 2013, which allows the carrier to increase the number of the routes from Krak\u00f3w to 31.\n\nKrak\u00f3w Airport is the second busiest airport in the country after [[Warsaw Chopin Airport]]. The airport has good growth prospects, as almost 8 million people live within {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} of it. The airport also has a favorable location on the network of existing and planned [[motorway]]s in this region of Poland.\n\n==Facilities==\n===Terminal===\n11 April 2013 saw the beginning of construction works of a new airport terminal, which is adjacent to the existing old terminal building. The works on the new terminal were completed in December 2016. The terminal serves all-year-round, 24 hours a day, both domestic as well as international flights. The expected maximum capacity of the terminal is up to 8 million passengers handled in a year (over twice as much as the airport served in 2012). It is also possible to handle transfer passengers irrespective of the routes ([[Schengen Area#Air travel|Schengen]]/Non-Schengen destinations). The terminal has a new luggage handling system and a roofed footbridge connecting the terminal to a hotel, a multi-level parking lot and the railway station, with direct railway link to [[Krak\u00f3w G\u0142\u00f3wny railway station|Krak\u00f3w G\u0142\u00f3wny]] by [[Koleje Ma\u0142opolskie]].\n\n===Runway===\nThe airport has one concrete [[runway]], number 07/25, {{convert|2550|x|60|m|abbr=on|0}}.\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n{{Airport destination list\n<!-- -->\n| [[Aegean Airlines]] | '''Seasonal:''' [[Athens International Airport|Athens]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Nowa trasa z Krakowa!

Normal city tariff applies thus making it by far the cheapest public transport connection to the city centre, at 4.60z\u0142 (allowing for bus/tram transfers within 50 minutes from boarding). Public buses can be used after purchasing tickets from a ticket machine located in the arrival hall, at the bus stop (with cash or credit card) or from ticket machines that can be found in most buses (sometimes with either coins or card only). All tickets have to be validated after getting on a bus. It is also possible to use private-owned bus and minibus services connecting the airport with the city center or other cities in Poland.

The reverse of the banknote featured a depiction of the Philippine declaration of independence by Emilio Aguinaldo on June 12, 1898.\n\nSecurity features of the banknote included a security thread, scattered red & blue visible fibers, and fluorescent printing.\n\nThe [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] has stopped printing this banknote in 1996 (with its last production year is 1995), and it has been replaced by an [[Philippine five peso coin|equivalent coin]].\n\n===10-peso banknote===\nThe 10-peso banknote designed by Rafael Asuncion was issued months after the 5-peso banknote was issued.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored brown.\n\nThe obverse side of the 10-peso banknote featured [[Apolinario Mabini]] on the left and [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] on the right. Bonifacio was the founder of the [[Katipunan]] (KKK), a secret society established to fight the Spanish colonial government. Mabini was the Philippines' first [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]] and [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]]. Depicted on the right side was one of the flags of the Katipunan (see [[Flags of the Philippine Revolution]]), the ''Kartilya ng Katipunan'', and a letter written by Mabini.\n\nThe reverse side of the banknote featured the [[Barasoain Church]] in [[Malolos, Bulacan]], site of the first Philippine Congress and where the [[Constitution of the Philippines|Malolos Constitution]] was drafted. The right portion depicted the initiation rites of the Katipunan. Members accepted into the society had to sign their name on the society's roster using their own blood. The design was previously used on the 5-peso  \"Pilipino\" and \"Ang Bagong Lipunan\" notes.\n\nBefore 1997, the 10-peso banknote only depicted Mabini and the Barasoain Church. In recent years, the banknote has since been replaced with a [[Bi-metallic coins|bi-metallic]] 10-peso coin also bearing the effigies of Bonifacio and Mabini.\n\nThe Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has stopped printing this banknote in 2002 (with its last production year is 2001) and was replaced by a [[Philippine ten peso coin|ten peso coin]].\n\n===20-peso banknote===\nThe 20 peso bill was designed by Angel Cacnio. The obverse side of the 20-peso banknote featured [[Manuel L. Quezon]], first president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]. Along the right side of the banknote was the coat-of-arms of the Commonwealth, and two of Quezon's notable accomplishments. The first was \"''Wikang Pambans\u00e2''\", which is [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"national language\". In 1937, the [[Commission on the Filipino Language|National Language Institute]] was founded to establish a single national language for the Philippines. This eventually became the [[Filipino language]],  which is largely based on Tagalog. The second was the \"''Saligang Batas 1935''\" or the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution of the Philippines]]. This was the first real constitution that was nationally effected and large parts of it survive in the current constitution.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored orange.\n\nThe reverse side of the 20-peso banknote depicted [[Malaca\u00f1an Palace]], more popularly known as Malaca\u00f1ang, the residence of the [[President of the Philippines]], along the banks of the [[Pasig River]]. Quezon was the first Philippine president to live in the Palace.\n\n===50-peso banknote===\nDepicted on the front side of the fifty-peso was [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]], the second president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]. He served as president from 1944, after Quezon's death, to 1946, when the United States granted the Philippines' independence.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored red and was designed by Rafael Asuncion.\n\nThe [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]] was featured on the reverse side of the banknote. This building used to be the Legislative Building, where the House of Representatives that Osmena presided over as Speaker from 1907 to 1922 was located. The building and then renamed Executive House during the Martial Law period and was labeled as such in the fifty-peso banknote until recently.\n\n===100-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 100-peso banknote featured [[Manuel Roxas]], the first president of the independent Philippine Republic. This independence was shown at the right side where the [[Flag of the Philippines|Philippine flag]] was raised while the flag of the [[United States]] was lowered on July 4, 1946.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored violet and was designed by Angel Cacnio.\n\nThe reverse side of the banknote depicted the Manila compound of the ''Bangko Sentral''.\n\nThe 100-peso banknote was the smallest-valued banknote to have the new security features implemented in recent years. But before the advent of the new security features, the 100-peso banknote was interesting for having other security features. On the front side was a barely visible \"100\" logo above the signatures of the president and the Central Bank governor. This logo was best seen on crisp new 100-peso banknotes. On the reverse side, the top row of windows of the main building had the words \"''Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas''\" (\"Central Bank of the Philippines\") running the whole length.\n\nThe 100-peso banknote became the subject of controversy after banknotes printed in France in time for the [[Christmas in the Philippines|Christmas season]] were printed with the President's name misspelled, the first in Philippine history.  The banknotes, of which a small amount were still in circulation and were legal tender until 2015, spelled the President's name as \"Gloria Macapagal-'''Arrovo'''\" versus the correct [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]. The incident was subsequently the subject of public humor as soon as the issue made national headlines. The BSP probed the mistake and corrected the error afterwards.\n\n===200-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 200-peso banknote featured the portrait of [[Diosdado Macapagal]]. It also featured the [[Aguinaldo Shrine]] in [[Kawit, Cavite]].\n\nThe back side of the banknote featured a scene from [[Second EDSA Revolution|EDSA II]], with [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], Macapagal's daughter, being sworn in as [[President of the Philippines|president]] by Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide, Jr.]] in January 2001. The little girl holding a [[Bible]] in between Arroyo and Davide is Cecilia Paz Razon Abad, daughter of Philippine Budget and Management Secretary [[Florencio Abad]] and [[Batanes]] [[Congress of the Philippines|Representative]] Henedina Razon-Abad.<ref>[http://news.inq7.net/nation/index.php?index=1&story_id=63539]</ref>\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored green.  This note was also a commemorative banknote, released in 2002 to commemorate [[Independence Day (Philippines)|Philippine independence]].\n\nThe banknote was the subject of criticism by the [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]].  They said that the legal tender should only feature deceased national heroes and not an incumbent President.  Although, it wasn't the first time that a legal tender featured a sitting President.  Legal tender coinage was minted to commemorate the inauguration of [[Manuel L. Quezon]] as [[President of the Philippines]] in 1935. Emergency currency during World War II had many instances where provincial emergency currency boards placed the image of then President [[Manuel L. Quezon]]. In 1975, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas released a 5-peso coin featuring the face of then President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].  Former presidents [[Fidel Ramos]] and [[Joseph Estrada]] was also pictured in a limited commemorative 2000-peso banknote that honors the 100-year celebration of Philippine Independence. Also a limited commemorative gold 1000-peso banknote with the picture of former President [[Joseph Estrada]] was also issued to honor the 100-year celebration of Philippine Independence. Also, every banknote series since 1935 has borne the facsimile signature of the incumbent [[President of the Philippines]].\n\nSome critics including Father [[Robert Reyes]] also pointed out that featuring Gloria Arroyo in the 200-peso note could be an electioneering tactic ahead of the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 Philippine elections]].<ref>http://www.newsflash.org/2002/04/be/be002037.htm</ref>\n\n===500-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 500-peso banknote featured the portrait of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] To the right of the banknote, there were two popular quotes from Aquino: \"Faith in our people and faith in God\", and \"The Filipino is worth dying for\", under which was signed his nickname, \"Ninoy\". There was also the signature of Aquino, a typewriter with his initials (\"B.S.A.J.\"), and a dove of peace.  A Philippine flag was also to the right of his portrait, near the central part of the front side.\n\nThe reverse side featured a collage of various images in relation to Aquino.  He was (in front of an article about \"[[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cav]]\", out of some of the pictures) a journalist for the ''[[Manila Times]]'', a senator (the pioneer of the Study Now, Pay Later education program), the mayor in his hometown of [[Concepcion, Tarlac|Concepcion]], the governor of [[Tarlac]], and was the main driving force behind the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986,<ref name=\"EDSA 1986\"/><ref name=\"EDSA 1986-2\"/> some three years after his death in 1983.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored yellow.\n\nIt was also interesting to note that unlike the names of the figures on the bills, \"Benigno S. Aquino, Jr.\" was written in gold-colored, cursive writing with a green laurel wreath as opposed to the name being simply written as with the other banknotes.\n\nBefore this note was printed, the 500-peso banknote designed by Romeo Mananquil was to feature [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and was its reverse was to be the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]]. The [[People Power Revolution]] caused it to be replaced by the current 500-peso banknote. Remnants of this version of the banknote were only for media purposes.\n\nOn August 16, 2009, a proposal was made by the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]]  to have former President [[Corazon Aquino|Cory Aquino]] accompany her husband, [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Ninoy Aquino]] on the banknote. The new design was included in the 500-peso NGC note.\n\n===1,000-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 1,000-peso banknote featured the portraits of [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]], Chief Justice;  [[Josefa Llanes Escoda]], civic worker and one of the founders of the [[Girl Scouts of the Philippines]];  and [[Vicente Lim]], a general in the Philippine Army, first Filipino graduate of [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]: the three are considered heroes of the resistance against the Japanese occupation of the Philippines.  It also featured the [[eternal flame]], [[Bay laurel|laurel leaves]], and bank seal.\n\nThe back of the banknote featured the [[Banaue Rice Terraces]], [[Manunggul Jar]] cover and Langgal.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored blue and was designed by Romeo Mananquil.\n\nSecurity features of the banknote included optically variable ink, a security thread, scattered red & blue visible fibers, and fluorescent printing. The words \"Central Bank of the Philippines\" were microprinted in the lower left border on the face of the note.\n\n==Coins==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n|+ BSP Coin Series (1995-2017)\n! colspan=\"2\"| Image \n! rowspan=\"2\"| Face Value \n! colspan=\"4\"| Technical parameters \n! colspan=\"3\"| Description \n! colspan=\"2\"| Years of Issue\n|- \n!

The reverse of the banknote featured a depiction of the Philippine declaration of independence by Emilio Aguinaldo on June 12, 1898.\n\nSecurity features of the banknote included a security thread, scattered red & blue visible fibers, and fluorescent printing.\n\nThe [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] has stopped printing this banknote in 1996 (with its last production year is 1995), and it has been replaced by an [[Philippine five peso coin|equivalent coin]].\n\n===10-peso banknote===\nThe 10-peso banknote designed by Rafael Asuncion was issued months after the 5-peso banknote was issued.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored brown.\n\nThe obverse side of the 10-peso banknote featured [[Apolinario Mabini]] on the left and [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] on the right. Bonifacio was the founder of the [[Katipunan]] (KKK), a secret society established to fight the Spanish colonial government. Mabini was the Philippines' first [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]] and [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]]. Depicted on the right side was one of the flags of the Katipunan (see [[Flags of the Philippine Revolution]]), the ''Kartilya ng Katipunan'', and a letter written by Mabini.\n\nThe reverse side of the banknote featured the [[Barasoain Church]] in [[Malolos, Bulacan]], site of the first Philippine Congress and where the [[Constitution of the Philippines|Malolos Constitution]] was drafted. The right portion depicted the initiation rites of the Katipunan. Members accepted into the society had to sign their name on the society's roster using their own blood. The design was previously used on the 5-peso  \"Pilipino\" and \"Ang Bagong Lipunan\" notes.\n\nBefore 1997, the 10-peso banknote only depicted Mabini and the Barasoain Church. In recent years, the banknote has since been replaced with a [[Bi-metallic coins|bi-metallic]] 10-peso coin also bearing the effigies of Bonifacio and Mabini.\n\nThe Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has stopped printing this banknote in 2002 (with its last production year is 2001) and was replaced by a [[Philippine ten peso coin|ten peso coin]].\n\n===20-peso banknote===\nThe 20 peso bill was designed by Angel Cacnio. The obverse side of the 20-peso banknote featured [[Manuel L. Quezon]], first president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]. Along the right side of the banknote was the coat-of-arms of the Commonwealth, and two of Quezon's notable accomplishments. The first was \"''Wikang Pambans\u00e2''\", which is [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"national language\". In 1937, the [[Commission on the Filipino Language|National Language Institute]] was founded to establish a single national language for the Philippines. This eventually became the [[Filipino language]],  which is largely based on Tagalog. The second was the \"''Saligang Batas 1935''\" or the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution of the Philippines]]. This was the first real constitution that was nationally effected and large parts of it survive in the current constitution.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored orange.\n\nThe reverse side of the 20-peso banknote depicted [[Malaca\u00f1an Palace]], more popularly known as Malaca\u00f1ang, the residence of the [[President of the Philippines]], along the banks of the [[Pasig River]]. Quezon was the first Philippine president to live in the Palace.\n\n===50-peso banknote===\nDepicted on the front side of the fifty-peso was [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]], the second president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]. He served as president from 1944, after Quezon's death, to 1946, when the United States granted the Philippines' independence.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored red and was designed by Rafael Asuncion.\n\nThe [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]] was featured on the reverse side of the banknote. This building used to be the Legislative Building, where the House of Representatives that Osmena presided over as Speaker from 1907 to 1922 was located. The building and then renamed Executive House during the Martial Law period and was labeled as such in the fifty-peso banknote until recently.\n\n===100-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 100-peso banknote featured [[Manuel Roxas]], the first president of the independent Philippine Republic. This independence was shown at the right side where the [[Flag of the Philippines|Philippine flag]] was raised while the flag of the [[United States]] was lowered on July 4, 1946.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored violet and was designed by Angel Cacnio.\n\nThe reverse side of the banknote depicted the Manila compound of the ''Bangko Sentral''.\n\nThe 100-peso banknote was the smallest-valued banknote to have the new security features implemented in recent years. But before the advent of the new security features, the 100-peso banknote was interesting for having other security features. On the front side was a barely visible \"100\" logo above the signatures of the president and the Central Bank governor. This logo was best seen on crisp new 100-peso banknotes. On the reverse side, the top row of windows of the main building had the words \"''Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas''\" (\"Central Bank of the Philippines\") running the whole length.\n\nThe 100-peso banknote became the subject of controversy after banknotes printed in France in time for the [[Christmas in the Philippines|Christmas season]] were printed with the President's name misspelled, the first in Philippine history.  The banknotes, of which a small amount were still in circulation and were legal tender until 2015, spelled the President's name as \"Gloria Macapagal-'''Arrovo'''\" versus the correct [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]. The incident was subsequently the subject of public humor as soon as the issue made national headlines. The BSP probed the mistake and corrected the error afterwards.\n\n===200-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 200-peso banknote featured the portrait of [[Diosdado Macapagal]]. It also featured the [[Aguinaldo Shrine]] in [[Kawit, Cavite]].\n\nThe back side of the banknote featured a scene from [[Second EDSA Revolution|EDSA II]], with [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], Macapagal's daughter, being sworn in as [[President of the Philippines|president]] by Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide, Jr.]] in January 2001. The little girl holding a [[Bible]] in between Arroyo and Davide is Cecilia Paz Razon Abad, daughter of Philippine Budget and Management Secretary [[Florencio Abad]] and [[Batanes]] [[Congress of the Philippines|Representative]] Henedina Razon-Abad.<ref>[http://news.inq7.net/nation/index.php?index=1&story_id=63539]</ref>\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored green.  This note was also a commemorative banknote, released in 2002 to commemorate [[Independence Day (Philippines)|Philippine independence]].\n\nThe banknote was the subject of criticism by the [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]].  They said that the legal tender should only feature deceased national heroes and not an incumbent President.  Although, it wasn't the first time that a legal tender featured a sitting President.  Legal tender coinage was minted to commemorate the inauguration of [[Manuel L. Quezon]] as [[President of the Philippines]] in 1935. Emergency currency during World War II had many instances where provincial emergency currency boards placed the image of then President [[Manuel L. Quezon]]. In 1975, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas released a 5-peso coin featuring the face of then President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].  Former presidents [[Fidel Ramos]] and [[Joseph Estrada]] was also pictured in a limited commemorative 2000-peso banknote that honors the 100-year celebration of Philippine Independence. Also a limited commemorative gold 1000-peso banknote with the picture of former President [[Joseph Estrada]] was also issued to honor the 100-year celebration of Philippine Independence. Also, every banknote series since 1935 has borne the facsimile signature of the incumbent [[President of the Philippines]].\n\nSome critics including Father [[Robert Reyes]] also pointed out that featuring Gloria Arroyo in the 200-peso note could be an electioneering tactic ahead of the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 Philippine elections]].<ref>http://www.newsflash.org/2002/04/be/be002037.htm</ref>\n\n===500-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 500-peso banknote featured the portrait of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] To the right of the banknote, there were two popular quotes from Aquino: \"Faith in our people and faith in God\", and \"The Filipino is worth dying for\", under which was signed his nickname, \"Ninoy\". There was also the signature of Aquino, a typewriter with his initials (\"B.S.A.J.\"), and a dove of peace.  A Philippine flag was also to the right of his portrait, near the central part of the front side.\n\nThe reverse side featured a collage of various images in relation to Aquino.  He was (in front of an article about \"[[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cav]]\", out of some of the pictures) a journalist for the ''[[Manila Times]]'', a senator (the pioneer of the Study Now, Pay Later education program), the mayor in his hometown of [[Concepcion, Tarlac|Concepcion]], the governor of [[Tarlac]], and was the main driving force behind the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986,<ref name=\"EDSA 1986\"/><ref name=\"EDSA 1986-2\"/> some three years after his death in 1983.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored yellow.\n\nIt was also interesting to note that unlike the names of the figures on the bills, \"Benigno S. Aquino, Jr.\" was written in gold-colored, cursive writing with a green laurel wreath as opposed to the name being simply written as with the other banknotes.\n\nBefore this note was printed, the 500-peso banknote designed by Romeo Mananquil was to feature [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and was its reverse was to be the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]]. The [[People Power Revolution]] caused it to be replaced by the current 500-peso banknote. Remnants of this version of the banknote were only for media purposes.\n\nOn August 16, 2009, a proposal was made by the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]]  to have former President [[Corazon Aquino|Cory Aquino]] accompany her husband, [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Ninoy Aquino]] on the banknote. The new design was included in the 500-peso NGC note.\n\n===1,000-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 1,000-peso banknote featured the portraits of [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]], Chief Justice;  [[Josefa Llanes Escoda]], civic worker and one of the founders of the [[Girl Scouts of the Philippines]];  and [[Vicente Lim]], a general in the Philippine Army, first Filipino graduate of [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]: the three are considered heroes of the resistance against the Japanese occupation of the Philippines.  It also featured the [[eternal flame]], [[Bay laurel|laurel leaves]], and bank seal.\n\nThe back of the banknote featured the [[Banaue Rice Terraces]], [[Manunggul Jar]] cover and Langgal.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored blue and was designed by Romeo Mananquil.\n\nSecurity features of the banknote included optically variable ink, a security thread, scattered red & blue visible fibers, and fluorescent printing. The words \"Central Bank of the Philippines\" were microprinted in the lower left border on the face of the note.\n\n==Coins==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n|+ BSP Coin Series (1995-2017)\n! colspan=\"2\"| Image \n! rowspan=\"2\"| Face Value \n! colspan=\"4\"| Technical parameters \n! colspan=\"3\"| Description \n! colspan=\"2\"| Years of Issue\n|- \n!

According to his mother, he displayed a precocious artistic enthusiasm early in life:\n\n<blockquote>\"My mother recognized my talent for drawing when I was a toddler, and she maintains that I could hold a pencil correctly before my two legs could support me. I would sit on the floor for hours drawing spiders on my fingers and toes, and filling sheets of butcher's paper with doodles and scribbles.\"<ref name=\"bio\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708145722/http://www.chluaid.com/brackenwood/bio.htm|title=Adam Phillips' old bio}} (Wayback Machine)</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Walt Disney Australia ===\nIn 1989, Phillips moved to [[Queensland]] to find work. He was later injured in an industrial accident, and he dedicated himself to drawing during his convalescence. In 1993, he was hired by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] to work as a [[tweening|tweener]] in Sydney and promoted to the position of character animator two years later. He became the effects director in 1998, a role in which he worked on several Disney sequel films.

However, in 2010 Phillips partnered with programmer and fellow animator [[Sean McGee]] to start work on a ''Brackenwood''-branded video game titled ''Dashkin'', which would serve as a sequel to ''The Last of the Dashkin''.<ref name=\"dashkin dies\">Phillips, Adam. {{Cite web|url=https://bitey.com/dashkin-dies-in-the-end/|title=Dashkin dies in the end}}, Bitey.com</ref> It would be a high-speed side-scroller, all made in Adobe Flash.<ref name=\"dashkin game\">Phillips, Adam. {{Cite web|url=https://bitey.com/new-brackenwood-stuff/|title=New Brackenwood stuff}}, Bitey.com</ref> While still working as a freelance animator for EA2D in 2011, Phillips showed their progress on the ''Dashkin'' game to his colleagues at the studio. Not long after, EA2D was renamed Bioware San Francisco and had begun to search for established 2D IPs on Flash game sites, such as [[Newgrounds]]. EA2D asked Phillips if he would be interested for them to work with him on making ''Dashkin'' a social game on Facebook, and after discussing it with McGee, he agreed. While initially worried about the game having [[microtransaction]]s, Phillips reasoned that it could help ''Brackenwood'' reach a larger audience. A small team came together, file sharing and version control were put in place, but as Phillips and McGee got to the contract stage, EA2D began to go through some big changes and their boss advised them to take the ''Dashkin'' IP back. Not long after, their boss left the company to co-found [[Rumble Games]], and most of the EA2D Phillips had been a part of disbanded after a few months. Phillips and McGee had already begun overhauling ''Dashkin'' into a social game but they had no money left and only about 5% of the game completed.<ref name=\"dashkin dies\" /><ref name=\"dashkin dream lives\">Smith, Stephanie. {{Cite web|url=http://cliqist.com/2016/05/31/dashkin-dream-lives-just-not-game/|title=Dashkin The Dream Lives On, Just Not As A Game}}, Cliqist, 31 May 2016</ref><ref name=\"dashkin game 2\">Phillips, Adam. {{Cite web|url=https://bitey.com/dashkin-game/|title=''Dashkin'' game}}, Bitey.com</ref> After shopping the IP around to some Flash portals and getting rejected, Phillips and McGee launched a [[Kickstarter]] fundraiser to fund the project. They received US$27,333 in donations towards making the game.<ref name=\"dashkin kickstarter\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/27467991/dashkin-a-game-of-high-speed-challenges-through-br|title=Dashkin: a game of high speed challenges through Brackenwood}}, Kickstarter.com</ref> After five years of working together, the two collaborators' schedules would not allow them to continue. Phillips had also found that the limitations of Adobe Flash were hindering the performance of the game considerably, and so the project was cancelled in 2015.<ref name=\"dashkin dies\" /><ref name=\"dashkin dream lives\" />\n\n=== Working on ''Bob's Burgers'' ===\nSince May 2014, Phillips has been working as an assistant director on the American animated comedy television series ''[[Bob's Burgers]]''. Before becoming assistant director, Phillips did occasional freelance visual effects animation on the show. To this day, working as an assistant director on ''Bob's Burgers'' is still Phillips' full-time job.<ref name=\"linkedin\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillips/?originalSubdomain=au|title=Adam Phillips' Linkedin page}}</ref><ref name=\"imdb\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0680185/|title=Adam Phillips' IMDb page}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2014, Phillips created an animated GIF of the coach of the Mexican national soccer team, [[Miguel Herrera]], transforming into a Super Saiyan, a concept from the manga and anime ''[[Dragon Ball]]''. Using footage of Herrera gesturing wildly and excitedly on a TV broadcast following Mexico's win over Croatia, Phillips superimposed yellow hair, green eyes, glowing aura effects, and lightning on it.

According to the ''Dashkin'' dev blog, it was to be a speed-based side-scrolling platformer built with [[Unreal Engine 4]], and was going to be split into three parts, one of which was to be a story mode that would serve as a direct sequel to Phillips' latest conventional ''Brackenwood'' movie, ''The Last of the Dashkin''. He had partnered with Kirk Sexton of Wrong Dojo Inc., who he had met at EA2D when Sexton was working there as a server engineer. Sexton had previous experience with programming for video games, so his role became that of a programmer on the project, while Phillips would be responsible for the majority of the art assets and the story. The project was a feature in a large article by Toon Boom, the company developing Toon Boom Harmony, which is the 2D animation software Phillips uses and an industry standard.<ref name=\"toon boom game\">Mak, Philip. {{Cite web|url=https://blog.toonboom.com/bring-it-on-bitey-check-out-adam-phillips-brackensack-video-game|title=Bring it on, Bitey!

During this period, he also began writing book chapters for flash guides.\n\n=== Personal projects ===\nAt the end of 2004, Phillips left Disney \"to pursue [his] own interests.\"<ref name=\"cold hard flash 1\">Simpson, Aaron. {{Cite web|url=http://coldhardflash.com/2005/06/adam-phillips-part-1.html|title=Adam Phillips, Mayor of Brackenwood, Part 1}}, Cold Hard Flash, 13 June 2005</ref><ref name=\"cold hard flash 2\">Simpson, Aaron. {{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118024133/http://www.coldhardflash.com/2005/06/adam-phillips-part-2.html|title=Adam Phillips, Mayor of Brackenwood, Part 2}}, Cold Hard Flash, 15 June 2005 (Wayback Machine)</ref><ref name=\"cold hard flash 3\">Simpson, Aaron. {{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323093314/http://www.coldhardflash.com/2005/06/adam-phillips-part-3.html|title=Adam Phillips, Mayor of Brackenwood, Part 3}}, Cold Hard Flash, 17 June 2005 (Wayback Machine)</ref><ref name=\"sunday arts\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvAd2ZZX50|title=Sunday Arts - Adam Phillips segment}}, ABC Sunday Arts</ref> Since that time he has produced much content for his ''Brackenwood'' setting, including ''Prowlies at the River'', said to be in the Top 5 Most Influential Flash Films of all time according to the now defunct ColdHardFlash.com that used to be run by [[Aaron Simpson (producer)|Aaron Simpson]], the producer of [[Kids' WB]] and [[JibJab]].<ref name=\"cold hard flash influential\">Simpson, Aaron. {{Cite web|url=http://coldhardflash.com/2006/09/flash-animation-10.html|title=The Flash Animation 10 \u2013 Most Influential}}, Cold Hard Flash, 21 September 2006</ref><ref name=\"cartoon brew 10 most influential\">Amidi, Amid. {{Cite web|url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/old-brew/top-10-most-influential-online-flash-cartoons-2172.html|title=Top 10 Most Influential Online Flash Cartoons}}, Cartoon Brew, 21 September 2006 6:53 am</ref><ref name=\"awn\">Moody, Annemarie. {{Cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/news/coldhardflashcom-announces-10-best-flash-films|title=ColdHardFlash.com Announces The 10 Best Flash Films}}, Animation World Network, Thursday, 12 June 2008, 12:00am</ref> The movie also won the TGSNT 2 competition's grand prize.

However, in 2010 Phillips partnered with programmer and fellow animator [[Sean McGee]] to start work on a ''Brackenwood''-branded video game titled ''Dashkin'', which would serve as a sequel to ''The Last of the Dashkin''.<ref name=\"dashkin dies\">Phillips, Adam. {{Cite web|url=https://bitey.com/dashkin-dies-in-the-end/|title=Dashkin dies in the end}}, Bitey.com</ref> It would be a high-speed side-scroller, all made in Adobe Flash.<ref name=\"dashkin game\">Phillips, Adam. {{Cite web|url=https://bitey.com/new-brackenwood-stuff/|title=New Brackenwood stuff}}, Bitey.com</ref> While still working as a freelance animator for EA2D in 2011, Phillips showed their progress on the ''Dashkin'' game to his colleagues at the studio. Not long after, EA2D was renamed Bioware San Francisco and had begun to search for established 2D IPs on Flash game sites, such as [[Newgrounds]]. EA2D asked Phillips if he would be interested for them to work with him on making ''Dashkin'' a social game on Facebook, and after discussing it with McGee, he agreed. While initially worried about the game having [[microtransaction]]s, Phillips reasoned that it could help ''Brackenwood'' reach a larger audience. A small team came together, file sharing and version control were put in place, but as Phillips and McGee got to the contract stage, EA2D began to go through some big changes and their boss advised them to take the ''Dashkin'' IP back. Not long after, their boss left the company to co-found [[Rumble Games]], and most of the EA2D Phillips had been a part of disbanded after a few months. Phillips and McGee had already begun overhauling ''Dashkin'' into a social game but they had no money left and only about 5% of the game completed.<ref name=\"dashkin dies\" /><ref name=\"dashkin dream lives\">Smith, Stephanie. {{Cite web|url=http://cliqist.com/2016/05/31/dashkin-dream-lives-just-not-game/|title=Dashkin The Dream Lives On, Just Not As A Game}}, Cliqist, 31 May 2016</ref><ref name=\"dashkin game 2\">Phillips, Adam. {{Cite web|url=https://bitey.com/dashkin-game/|title=''Dashkin'' game}}, Bitey.com</ref> After shopping the IP around to some Flash portals and getting rejected, Phillips and McGee launched a [[Kickstarter]] fundraiser to fund the project.

Phillips had also found that the limitations of Adobe Flash were hindering the performance of the game considerably, and so the project was cancelled in 2015.<ref name=\"dashkin dies\" /><ref name=\"dashkin dream lives\" />\n\n=== Working on ''Bob's Burgers'' ===\nSince May 2014, Phillips has been working as an assistant director on the American animated comedy television series ''[[Bob's Burgers]]''. Before becoming assistant director, Phillips did occasional freelance visual effects animation on the show. To this day, working as an assistant director on ''Bob's Burgers'' is still Phillips' full-time job.<ref name=\"linkedin\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillips/?originalSubdomain=au|title=Adam Phillips' Linkedin page}}</ref><ref name=\"imdb\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0680185/|title=Adam Phillips' IMDb page}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2014, Phillips created an animated GIF of the coach of the Mexican national soccer team, [[Miguel Herrera]], transforming into a Super Saiyan, a concept from the manga and anime ''[[Dragon Ball]]''. Using footage of Herrera gesturing wildly and excitedly on a TV broadcast following Mexico's win over Croatia, Phillips superimposed yellow hair, green eyes, glowing aura effects, and lightning on it. It became an [[Internet meme]] and the most viral reaction GIF of the World Cup at the time, being viewed over seven million times.

According to the ''Dashkin'' dev blog, it was to be a speed-based side-scrolling platformer built with [[Unreal Engine 4]], and was going to be split into three parts, one of which was to be a story mode that would serve as a direct sequel to Phillips' latest conventional ''Brackenwood'' movie, ''The Last of the Dashkin''. He had partnered with Kirk Sexton of Wrong Dojo Inc., who he had met at EA2D when Sexton was working there as a server engineer. Sexton had previous experience with programming for video games, so his role became that of a programmer on the project, while Phillips would be responsible for the majority of the art assets and the story. The project was a feature in a large article by Toon Boom, the company developing Toon Boom Harmony, which is the 2D animation software Phillips uses and an industry standard.<ref name=\"toon boom game\">Mak, Philip. {{Cite web|url=https://blog.toonboom.com/bring-it-on-bitey-check-out-adam-phillips-brackensack-video-game|title=Bring it on, Bitey!

They were used until 1896.\n\n===First Philippine Republic===\nThe [[First Philippine Republic|revolutionary republic]] of [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] ordered the issuance of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100-peso banknotes which were signed by Messrs. [[Pedro A. Paterno]], Telesforo Chuidan and Mariano Limjap to avoid counterfeiting. However, only the 1 and 5-peso banknotes have been printed and circulated to some areas by the end of the short-lived First Republic.\n\n===American Period===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 175\n | footer = [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] design proof (top) and issued note (bottom) of the 1924 Philippine one peso.

In 1908, the [[El Banco Espa\u00f1ol Filipino]] was allowed to print banknotes in the following denominations with text in Spanish: Cinco (5), Diez (10), Veinte (20), Cincuenta (50), Cien (100) and Dos Cientos (200) Pesos. In 1912, the bank was renamed [[Bank of the Philippine Islands]] (BPI) and henceforth issued the same banknotes in English.\n\nIn 1918, the Silver Certificates were replaced by the Treasury Certificates issued with government-backing of bonds issued by the United States Government in the following denominations: One, Two, Five, Ten, Twenty, Fifty, One Hundred and Five Hundred Pesos. In 1916, the [[Philippine National Bank]] (PNB) was created to administer the state-holding shares and print banknotes without any quota from the [[Philippine Assembly]]. They printed banknotes in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 pesos.

The following months, a new 10-peso banknote with the face of [[Apolinario Mabini]]. In March 3, 1986, a new 20-peso banknote appeared. After the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]]<ref name= \"EDSA 1986-a\"/><ref name= \"EDSA 1986-b\">{{cite web|url=http://xiaochua.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/41-nararamdaman-mong-kapatid-mo-ang-kapwa-mo-pilipino.jpg?w=500|title=People Power Revolution 1986}}</ref> and the new [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]] was promulgated, the Central Bank issued a new 50, 100- and for the second time a new 500-peso banknote with the face of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]]. In 1991, the Central Bank issued for the first time a new 1000-peso banknote, containing the portraits of [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]], [[Josefa Llanes Escoda]] and [[Vicente Lim]].\n\nAfter the passage of the New Central Bank Act of 1993, the ''New Design Series'', which was initiated in 1985, was slightly changed because of the new seal of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. In 1998, the 100,000-peso Centennial banknote, measuring 8.5\"x14\", accredited by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the world's largest legal tender note. It was issued in very limited quantity during the celebration of the Centennial of Philippine Independence. In 2001, the Bangko Sentral issued upgraded 1000, 500, and 100-peso banknotes with new hi-tech security features to combat counterfeiting. During the Estrada Administration, the practice in use since the Commonwealth, of reproducing the signature of the [[President of the Philippines]] over the legend \"President of the Philippines\" was abandoned in favor of explicitly stating the president's name.  In 2002, the Bangko Sentral issued a new 200-peso banknote with the security features found on the upgraded 1000, 500, and 100-peso banknotes and has the face of former President [[Diosdado Macapagal]]. His daughter, [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], is at the back of the 200-peso banknote which showed her being sworn into office at the [[EDSA Shrine]].

This color was changed by the printers to account for practical printing concerns. The designers further explains that printing banknotes is not like printing brochures. Due to the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printing]] and limited printing capability of banknote printers, it can only produce a limited full color reproduction.\n\nThe alleged mislocation of the Tubbataha Reef on the one thousand peso note was due to a security feature, a smaller version of the featured species on the bills' reverse (which is also featured on all banknote denominations) was located on top of the exact location of the Tubbataha Reef on the map. Giving the option of either moving the key security feature on the standard position or locating the Tubbataha marker correctly, the bills' French printers, [[Oberthur Technologies]], decided to move the reef marker slightly south on the Philippine map.<ref>[http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view/20110101-312041/The-pesos-makeover-from-an-insiders-view The peso\u2019s makeover from an insider\u2019s view ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206122807/http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view/20110101-312041/The-pesos-makeover-from-an-insiders-view |date=February 6, 2015 }}, Daxim Lucas, [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]], January 1, 2011</ref>\n\n==Higher denominations==\n[[File:Php bill 2000.jpg|thumb|Philippine Centennial led by [[Fidel V.

Another version, with the same design but measured at 160 x 66&nbsp;mm, was also planned to be issued as legal tender in 2001, but due to the ouster of President Joseph Estrada as the result of the [[EDSA Revolution of 2001|Second EDSA revolution (EDSA People Power II)]], the notes were stored in the vaults of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. As of 2010, the bank was considering destroying the bulk of the unissued notes (known as the \"New Millennium\" or \"Erap\" notes), saving only 50,000 of the five million pieces to be demonetized for \"historical, educational, numismatic, or other purposes\".

The front side of each banknote features prominent people along with buildings, and events in the country's history while the reverse side depicts landmarks and animals.\n\n==History==\nOn May 1, 1852, the first commercial bank of the Philippines, [[Bank of the Philippine Islands|El Banco Espa\u00f1ol Filipino de Isabel II]] issued the following denominations initially 10, 25, 50 and 200 pesos fuertes (strong pesos). They were used until 1896.\n\n===First Philippine Republic===\nThe [[First Philippine Republic|revolutionary republic]] of [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] ordered the issuance of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100-peso banknotes which were signed by Messrs. [[Pedro A. Paterno]], Telesforo Chuidan and Mariano Limjap to avoid counterfeiting. However, only the 1 and 5-peso banknotes have been printed and circulated to some areas by the end of the short-lived First Republic.\n\n===American Period===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 175\n | footer = [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] design proof (top) and issued note (bottom) of the 1924 Philippine one peso.

In 1908, the [[El Banco Espa\u00f1ol Filipino]] was allowed to print banknotes in the following denominations with text in Spanish: Cinco (5), Diez (10), Veinte (20), Cincuenta (50), Cien (100) and Dos Cientos (200) Pesos. In 1912, the bank was renamed [[Bank of the Philippine Islands]] (BPI) and henceforth issued the same banknotes in English.\n\nIn 1918, the Silver Certificates were replaced by the Treasury Certificates issued with government-backing of bonds issued by the United States Government in the following denominations: One, Two, Five, Ten, Twenty, Fifty, One Hundred and Five Hundred Pesos. In 1916, the [[Philippine National Bank]] (PNB) was created to administer the state-holding shares and print banknotes without any quota from the [[Philippine Assembly]]. They printed banknotes in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 pesos. During World War I, the PNB issued emergency notes printed on cardboard paper in the following denominations: 10, 20, 50 centavos and 1 peso. Also overprinted BPI Notes in Five, Ten and Twenty Pesos due to the lack of currency.\n\nThe [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] issued Treasury Certificates with the seal of the new government but still circulated the BPI and PNB banknotes.\n\n===Japanese government-issued Philippine peso===\n{{main|Japanese government-issued Philippine peso}}\n\n====1942 series====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:175px;\"| Image\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px; \"| Value\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Issue date\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:50px;\"| Series\n|-\n\n|[[File:PHI-102b-Japanese Government (Philippines)-1 Centavo (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|1 centavo\n|1942\n|First\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-103b-Japanese Government (Philippines)-5 Centavos (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|5 centavos\n|1942\n|First\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-104b-Japanese Government (Philippines)-10 Centavos (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|10 centavos\n|1942\n|First\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-105b-Japanese Government (Philippines)-50 Centavos (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|50 centavos\n|1942\n|First\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-106-Japanese Government (Philippines)-1 Peso (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|1 peso\n|1942\n|First\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-107A-Japanese Government (Philippines)-5 Pesos (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|5 pesos\n|1942\n|First\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-108-Japanese Government (Philippines)-10 Pesos (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|10 pesos\n|1942\n|First\n|}\n\n====1943-1945 series====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:175px;\"| Image\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px; \"| Value\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Issue date\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:50px;\"| Series\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-109-Japanese Government (Philippines)-1 Peso (1943).jpg|175px]]\n|1 peso\n|1943\n|Second\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-110-Japanese Government (Philippines)-5 Pesos (1943).jpg|175px]]\n|5 pesos\n|1943\n|Second \n|-\n|[[File:PHI-111-Japanese Government (Philippines)-10 Pesos (1943).jpg|175px]]\n|10 pesos\n|1943\n|Second\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-112-Japanese Government (Philippines)-100 Pesos (1944).jpg|175px]]\n|100 pesos\n|1944\n|Second\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-114-Japanese Government (Philippines)-500 Pesos (1944).jpg|175px]]\n|500 pesos\n|1944\n|Second \n|-\n|[[File:PHI-115-Japanese Government (Philippines)-1000 Pesos (1945).jpg|175px]]\n|1,000 pesos\n|1945\n|Second \n|-\n|}\n\n==Banknotes issued by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas==\n===\"VICTORY-CBP\" banknotes===\nThe banknotes first issued by today's [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] (formerly the \"Central Bank of the Philippines\") were the VICTORY-CBP Overprints in 1949, which were merely overprints of older American-era banknotes.

The one peso bill was replaced with the [[Philippine two peso bill|two peso bill]], which features the same elements of the demonetized Pilipino series one peso bill.\n\nOn September 7, 1978, the Security Printing Plant in [[Quezon City]] was inaugurated to produce the banknotes.\n\nThe banknotes were still legal tender even after the introduction of the [[New Design Series]] banknotes, however it is seldom used after the [[People Power Revolution|EDSA Revolution]].<ref name= \"EDSA 1986-a\">{{cite web|url=http://propagandaphotos.wordpress.com/2011/10/22/people-power-an-eyewitness-history/|title=People Power: An eyewitness history}}</ref> The banknotes were eventually demonetized on February 2, 1996 (but can still be exchange with legal tender currency to the Central Bank until February 1, 1996)<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cWcVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=igsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4928%2C4696327 FM era notes, Demonetization ordered], By Ramon Tomeldan, [[Manila Standard]], January 30, 1992</ref> after clamors that the banknotes can be used to buy votes for the [[1992 Philippine presidential election|1992 Presidential Elections]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZWcVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=igsEAAAAIBAJ&dq=lipunan&pg=6182%2C2115669 Solons want 'Mickey' Marcos money scrapped], by Gerry Jacinto, [[Manila Standard]], January 14, 1992</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"9\"| ''Ang Bagong Lipunan'' (New Society) Series\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"| Image !!rowspan=\"2\"| Value !!rowspan=\"2\"| Dimensions !!rowspan=\"2\"| Main Color !!colspan=\"2\"| Description !!colspan=\"2\"| Year\n|-\n!

The following months, a new 10-peso banknote with the face of [[Apolinario Mabini]]. In March 3, 1986, a new 20-peso banknote appeared. After the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]]<ref name= \"EDSA 1986-a\"/><ref name= \"EDSA 1986-b\">{{cite web|url=http://xiaochua.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/41-nararamdaman-mong-kapatid-mo-ang-kapwa-mo-pilipino.jpg?w=500|title=People Power Revolution 1986}}</ref> and the new [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]] was promulgated, the Central Bank issued a new 50, 100- and for the second time a new 500-peso banknote with the face of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]]. In 1991, the Central Bank issued for the first time a new 1000-peso banknote, containing the portraits of [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]], [[Josefa Llanes Escoda]] and [[Vicente Lim]].\n\nAfter the passage of the New Central Bank Act of 1993, the ''New Design Series'', which was initiated in 1985, was slightly changed because of the new seal of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. In 1998, the 100,000-peso Centennial banknote, measuring 8.5\"x14\", accredited by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the world's largest legal tender note. It was issued in very limited quantity during the celebration of the Centennial of Philippine Independence. In 2001, the Bangko Sentral issued upgraded 1000, 500, and 100-peso banknotes with new hi-tech security features to combat counterfeiting. During the Estrada Administration, the practice in use since the Commonwealth, of reproducing the signature of the [[President of the Philippines]] over the legend \"President of the Philippines\" was abandoned in favor of explicitly stating the president's name.  In 2002, the Bangko Sentral issued a new 200-peso banknote with the security features found on the upgraded 1000, 500, and 100-peso banknotes and has the face of former President [[Diosdado Macapagal]]. His daughter, [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], is at the back of the 200-peso banknote which showed her being sworn into office at the [[EDSA Shrine]]. She is the first president whose image has been included in a banknote while in office since emergency currency was issued by various provincial currency boards during World War II.\n\nThe series was renamed the '''BSP Series''' in 1993 when the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] was reestablished as the central monetary authority.\n\nThe '''New Design Series''' had less security features. (only the visible fibers, value panel, security thread and watermark.)\n\nOn July 8, 2009, the BSP announced that it would recall all bank notes made of abaca cotton soon and replace it with an all-polymer series. However, this is still in the planning stage, with no specific date set for printing and replacements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/business/2009/07/09/484627/bangko-sentral-may-issue-polymer-money|title=Bangko Sentral may issue polymer money {{!}} Philstar.com|website=philstar.com|access-date=2018-09-01}}</ref>\n\nThe '''BSP Series''' added more security features such as another glossy security thread, iridescent strip, fluorescent printing, optically variable ink, and microprints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philmoney.blogspot.com/search/label/Security%20Features |title=Security Features in Present Money |publisher=Philmoney.blogspot.com |date=2004-02-27 |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref>\n\nThese banknotes were legal tender alongside the ''New Generation Currency'' series until the end of 2015, when the ''New Generation Currency'' series became a single circulating set.<ref name=abs_dm_2016>{{cite web|title=Still hanging on to your old peso bills?

This color was changed by the printers to account for practical printing concerns. The designers further explains that printing banknotes is not like printing brochures. Due to the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printing]] and limited printing capability of banknote printers, it can only produce a limited full color reproduction.\n\nThe alleged mislocation of the Tubbataha Reef on the one thousand peso note was due to a security feature, a smaller version of the featured species on the bills' reverse (which is also featured on all banknote denominations) was located on top of the exact location of the Tubbataha Reef on the map. Giving the option of either moving the key security feature on the standard position or locating the Tubbataha marker correctly, the bills' French printers, [[Oberthur Technologies]], decided to move the reef marker slightly south on the Philippine map.<ref>[http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view/20110101-312041/The-pesos-makeover-from-an-insiders-view The peso\u2019s makeover from an insider\u2019s view ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206122807/http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view/20110101-312041/The-pesos-makeover-from-an-insiders-view |date=February 6, 2015 }}, Daxim Lucas, [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]], January 1, 2011</ref>\n\n==Higher denominations==\n[[File:Php bill 2000.jpg|thumb|Philippine Centennial led by [[Fidel V.

Another version, with the same design but measured at 160 x 66&nbsp;mm, was also planned to be issued as legal tender in 2001, but due to the ouster of President Joseph Estrada as the result of the [[EDSA Revolution of 2001|Second EDSA revolution (EDSA People Power II)]], the notes were stored in the vaults of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. As of 2010, the bank was considering destroying the bulk of the unissued notes (known as the \"New Millennium\" or \"Erap\" notes), saving only 50,000 of the five million pieces to be demonetized for \"historical, educational, numismatic, or other purposes\". However it was not until 2012 that the bank began selling this numismatic product in a folder that clearly stipulates that the notes are not legal tender.<ref>[http://banknotenews.com/files/62cffb5907033609d088ea312b647626-2296.php Philippines new 2,000-peso numismatic product confirmed] BanknoteNews.com.

The \"Dinky\" is named for its slightly smaller than normal (7/8) body size. Usually fitted with a two [[humbucker]] pickup configuration, some models also include [[Single coil|single-coil]] [[Pickup (music technology)|pickups]] and/or just one bridge humbucker. The fretboard can be made out of [[ebony]], [[rosewood]] and more recently [[maple]], or rock maple, with 24 jumbo frets and is always built with a bolt-on neck. Most of the guitars have a [[Floyd Rose]] original or licensed tremolo, and a locking nut to help maintain stable tuning. Some Dinkys have [[Bridge (instrument)#Electric guitar bridges|hardtail]], or String-Thru bridges. The Jackson Dinky is usually preferred by players of [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].\n\n==The models==\nThe Dinky is the most common Jackson in production today with over 15 variants on the current market. These are below arranged in the series that they are given by Jackson Guitars.\n\n===USA Select series===\nThere is only one Dinky in this series: the '''DK1'''.

The DK2s are made from alder with a maple bolt-on neck. The fingerboard is Rosewood with 24 frets. The DK2 model has three Seymour Duncan pickups; two are single-coil, the third (the bridge) is a [[humbucker]]. Variants include:\n\n*'''DK2L''': The left-handed version of the DK2\n*'''[[Jackson DK2M|DK2M]]''': A DK2 with a maple fingerboard and unpainted maple [[headstock]]. This uses two humbuckers (authentic Seymour Duncan).\n*'''DK2S''': A DK2 with an alternative 'Sustainiac Driver' neck pickup.\n*'''DK2T''': A string-through-body DK2 with adjustable [[Tune-O-Matic]] bridge, with two Seymour Duncan humbucker pickups.\n*'''DK2FF''': A DK2 with an abalone flame inlay on the neck.\n*'''DK2FS''': A DK2 with Firestorm Boost Switch for extra gain.\n*'''DK3''': Same specs as the DK2, except the pickup configuration is H/S/H.

It was listed in 2000 Guitar Player Price guide as having a list price of $949 which is $50 more than the regular DK2.  Could very well be the only Jackson with H/S/H configuration and shark fin fret markers.\n*'''DR3''': Same as DK3 but with reverse headstock and reverse shark fin inlays and a pickup configuration of H/H.\n\n===Pro series Artist Signature===\nThere are three Dinkys in this series and each of the Pro Series Artist Signature models puts an individual spin on the basic Dinky design.\n\n*'''Christian Olde Wolbers Signature''': A Dinky with a distinct camouflage graphic on both the body and [[headstock]].

The earlier DKMG has two passive EMG-HZ [[humbucker]]s with an active boost control. The newer models consist of active EMGs 81 and 85. The DKMG has two variant models:\n\n*'''DKMG ''': The DKMG  with a licensed locking Floyd Rose bridge.\n*'''DKMGT''': The DKMGT with string-through-body, Tune-O-Matic style adjustable fixed bridge.\n*'''DXMG''':  The DXMG with sharktooth inlays and licensed Floyd Rose bridge (most JT580LP).\n\nA similar variant of this is the DXMG which had a non arched basswood body (as of 2006, previous years used alder) and alternative pickups (EMG-HZs) without the boost. But it's DX designation makes it part of the X-Series, with neck/headstock binding and pickups differentiating it from a DX10D.

This signature model comes with one [[Humbucker|humbucking pickup]] and no others.\n*'''Christian Olde Wolbers Signature 7-string''': This Dinky (offered in Camo, Red and Black finishes) matches the specs of the Christian Olde Wolbers Signature and adds a 7th string.\n*'''Adrian Smith San Dimas Dinky''': New for 2009, [[Iron Maiden]] guitarist [[Adrian Smith]] now has a signature Dinky. The Dinky comes with a San Dimas style headstock, and in two different designs.  One design features an ebony fingerboard and a white pickguard.  The second design comes with a maple fingerboard and a black pickguard.  Both guitars feature a [[DiMarzio]] Super Distortion bridge humbucking pickup, along with two Hot Samarium Strat pickups and a [[Floyd Rose]] double-locking Tremolo bridge.\n\n===MG series===\nThe MG series features three Dinkys. The DKMG features an arch top Alder body. Flame Maple veneer tops on translucent colors are available on later models, and maple bolt-on neck with a  reverse headstock.  The 24-fret fingerboard is made from rosewood with Jackson's trademark Mother-Of-Pearl \"Piranha Tooth\" inlays and also features a bound neck.  The earlier DKMG has two passive EMG-HZ [[humbucker]]s with an active boost control. The newer models consist of active EMGs 81 and 85. The DKMG has two variant models:\n\n*'''DKMG ''': The DKMG  with a licensed locking Floyd Rose bridge.\n*'''DKMGT''': The DKMGT with string-through-body, Tune-O-Matic style adjustable fixed bridge.\n*'''DXMG''':  The DXMG with sharktooth inlays and licensed Floyd Rose bridge (most JT580LP).\n\nA similar variant of this is the DXMG which had a non arched basswood body (as of 2006, previous years used alder) and alternative pickups (EMG-HZs) without the boost. But it's DX designation makes it part of the X-Series, with neck/headstock binding and pickups differentiating it from a DX10D. Early model DXMGs were made in Japan, and made from alder, while later models (after 2006) were made in India and has basswood body. DXMGs are now discontinued.\n\n===X series===\nThere is one Dinky model in the X series: The [[DKXT]]. The DKXT has an arch top basswood body with a bolt on maple neck. The rosewood fingerboard has 24 frets. The pickups are [[EMG, Inc.|EMG]]; passive humbuckers. The DKXT features Through-Body Strings bridge.\n\n===Performer Series===\nThe performer series were produced prior to the Fender takeover.\nThis range includes the Jackson RR7, a seven-string Randy Rhoads design, with lower quality hardware. This series also included dinky style guitars, which were, for the most part, fully loaded, having 3 humbucker pickups, reverse headstocks, 24 frets and floyd rose tremolos. These guitars are low-end models that were built in Korea (and later Japan).\n\n===JS series===\nThere are nine Dinkys in the entry level JS series\n\n*'''JS1''': Two [[humbucker|humbucking pickups]], both Jackson made. It has a fulcrum bridge. The body is made from Indian Cedro and the neck from maple.\n*'''JS11''': Two [[humbucker|humbucking pickups]], both Jackson made. It has a fulcrum bridge. The body is made from Indian Cedro and the neck from maple.\n*'''JS20''': The JS20 has 22 frets and a normal headstock.  The Jackson catalog from the early 2000's list the body as alder.

The whole NAS base is a tenant of the Italian Air Force, which has the military and the administrative control.<ref>http://www.carabinieri.it/editoria/rassegna-dell-arma/la-rassegna/anno-2011/n-3---luglio-settembre/studi/le-basi-militari-alleate-in-italia-aspetti-di-rilevanza-per-l-attivit%C3%A0-di-polizia-militare</ref> It serves as an Italian base for the [[:it:41\u00ba Stormo|41\u00ba Stormo Antisom]] (41st Antisubmarine Warfare Wing).\nNAS Sigonella acts also as landlord to more than 40 other U.S. commands and activities. It is located {{convert|15|km|NM|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} west and {{convert|11|km|NM|0|abbr=on}} south of the city of [[Catania]], and some {{convert|40|km|NM|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Mount Etna]].\n\nBecause of its location near the center of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], '''NASSIG''' is well placed to support operations by the [[United States Sixth Fleet|U.S. 6th Fleet]], other U.S. military units, and U.S. allies and coalition partners.\n\nAmong the aircraft that fly from this island base are Italian Air Force ATR 72 MP ( which replaced the [[Breguet Br.1150 Atlantic]] in 2017) and [[U.S. Air Force]] [[C-130]], [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III|C-17]] and [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy|C-5]] airlifters, [[KC-135]] and [[KC-10]] [[Tanker (aircraft)|tanker]]s and U.S. Navy [[P-3 Orion]]s, [[Boeing P-8 Poseidon|P-8 Poseidon]]<nowiki/>s, [[C-2 Greyhound]]s and [[McDonnell Douglas C-9|C-9B Skytrain II]]s and [[C-40 Clipper|C-40A Clippers]].\n\nIt is one of the most frequently used stops for U.S. airlift aircraft bound from [[CONUS|the continental United States]] to [[Southwest Asia]] and the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\nNAS Sigonella has the best claim to be hub of U.S. naval air operations in the Mediterranean. The base command is landlord to more than 40 other U.S. units. Among the largest are a rotating P-3C patrol squadron; a Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station; and a U.S. Naval Hospital. The hospital was built in 1992. Previously, there was only a clinic and the closest U.S. Naval Hospital was at [[Naples]].  Sigonella is home to more than 4,000 troops, civilian personnel, and family members.\n\nNAS Sigonella is the Navy's second largest security command, second only to that located at [[Naval Support Activity Bahrain]]. NAS Sigonella also has a large support of security personnel from NR NSF Sigonella, a Navy Reserve command based out of NOSC Detroit at [[Selfridge ANGB]], Michigan.\n\nThe base comprises two sections: NAS I was the site of the original U.S. base but is now a support facility, and NAS II which includes the runways, operations and most tenant commands. NAS I also contains the Navy Exchange and Commissary, the school, and some homes, mainly for the commodore of Task Force 67, the air station commanding officer, air station executive officer and commanding officers of tenant activities. NAS I also is host to other facilities, mainly for entertainment. NAS II is now only used as a service base.\n\n==History==\nThe United States Naval Air Facility (NAF), Sigonella, was established 15 June 1959; its first commanding officer was Captain Walter J. Frazier. The facility was conceived in the early 1950s, when plans to base U.S. Navy [[P-2 Neptune|P2V Neptune]]s at [[\u0126al Far|Hal Far]], [[Malta]] began to outgrow the facility.\n\nWhen there was no room for expansion at Malta, the U.S. Navy obtained [[NATO]] backing to be hosted by Sicilians. Italy made land available under a temporary agreement signed 25 June 1957. Six days later, Landing Ship Tank ([[Tank landing ship|LST]]s) began to deliver equipment from the Malta base.\n\nGround was broken in September, and construction on the administrative area at NAF I was started in 1958. It was built on top of an airfield where damaged fighters and bombers of the [[Luftwaffe|German Air Force]] had once landed during the [[Second World War]]. The first Americans arrived for work at Sigonella in March 1959\u2014six months before any buildings were ready\u2014and so worked for six months in [[Catania]] at a large warehouse complex called Magazzino Generale (General Warehouse), which is opposite the cemetery on the right side of the street as one enters Catania from the base.\n\nBy the end of August 1959, the NAF II airfield was available for daylight flights under [[visual flight rules]] (VFR); 24 flights were logged by 31 August.\n\nOne of Sigonella's first buildings was what is now the [[American Forces Network]] (AFN) building. In 1958, that building was Sigonella's vector (pest) control center, where [[rat]] poison was stored. The [[United States Army|Army]] [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] next used the building for their offices, later sharing it with Special Services, or what is now called [[Morale, Welfare and Recreation]] (MWR). Around 1966, AFN came to Sigonella and joined Special Services, which soon moved out, leaving the building to the broadcasters.\n\nSigonella's first flood occurred mid-September 1959. The [[Dittaino]] Bridge between NAF I and NAF II was under six feet of water on 20 September and all traffic had to go through Catania. Power outages accompanied the floods.\n\nIn 1965 the [[Aeronautica Militare|Italian Air Force]] sited at Sigonella the [[:it:41\u00ba Stormo|41st Antisubmarine Warfare Wing]] (86st Gruppo and 88st Gruppo) with mixed crews from the Air Force and Navy.\n\nIn the 1980s, \"Naval Air Facility\" Sigonella was redesignated as a \"Naval Air Station\".\n\nIn 1983 the base was named after [[World War II]] pilot Captain Cosimo Di Palma ([[:it:Cosimo Di Palma|it]]), who was shot down by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' while on a mission with the [[Italian Co-belligerent Air Force]] and was honored with the [[Medal of Military Valor|Gold medal of Military Valor]].\n[[File:US_Navy_051214-N-1120L-001_U.S._Navy_Sailors_assigned_to_Explosive_Ordnance_Disposal_Mobile_Unit_Eight_(EODMU-8),_prepare_to_load_their_zodiac_pontoon_boat_onto_a_trailer_following_an_initial_exploration_of_the_Marinai_housing.jpg|thumb|left|230px|NAS Sigonella during flooding in December 2005.]]\n\nOn the night of 10 October 1985, there were tense hours on NAS II when the Italian [[Carabinieri]], [[Italian Air Force]], and the US Army's [[Delta Force]] came close to firing upon one another following the interception by US Navy [[F-14 Tomcat]] fighters of an Egyptian [[Boeing 737]] airliner carrying the hijackers of the Italian cruise ship, the [[MS Achille Lauro|Achille Lauro]], which had been commandeered by members of the [[PLO]] on 7 October. The hijackers had killed a Jewish-American citizen [[Leon Klinghoffer]]. The F-14s instructed the Egyptian plane to land at Sigonella where the Americans had planned to take the hijackers into custody. The Italian Prime Minister [[Bettino Craxi]] instead claimed the hijackers were under Italian jurisdiction. The Italian authorities therefore refused to allow the SEALs to board the plane, threatening to open fire on the Americans had they made an attempt to do so. This move was supposedly dictated both by security concerns about [[terrorism|terrorists]] targeting Italy if the United States had had it their way, and by the Italian tradition of [[diplomacy]] with the [[Arab world]]. The ensuing stand-off lasted throughout the night, until President [[Ronald Reagan]] gave the orders for the Americans to stand down.\n[[File:US_Navy_060823-N-3013W-003_Aviation_Ordnanceman_3rd_Class_Giancarlo_Rosasarias_of_Los_Angeles,_Calif.,_directs_the_taxi_pilot_to_straighten_his_direction_of_movement_in_order_to_properly_park_a_P-3C_Orion,_after_returning_from.jpg|thumb|A taxiway on NAS Sigonella]]\nIn late 1985, work crews belonging to NMCB 133 were repairing and installing sidewalks in the housing area at NAS I when they uncovered a small stockpile of Luftwaffe antiaircraft ammunition. The stockpile had apparently belonged to an antiaircraft position that had been buried during raids in the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Allied invasion of 1943]].<ref>Stars and Stripes Europe, 25 October 1985</ref>\n\nOn 1 April 2004, the [[Defense Logistics Agency]] (DLA) opened Defense Depot Sigonella Italy on NAS II to serve as a supply base for the Mediterranean.  DLA also provides fuel and property disposal from NAS II.\n\nSigonella suffered its second major flood mid December 2005.  Over 400 service members and family evacuated. In 2006, a newly installed protective [[berm]] prevented a nearly second consecutive year of flooding.\n\nWhen NATO took [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military intervention]] to [[Libya]] in 2011, NAS Sigonella played an important role in US [[Operation Odyssey Dawn]] because of its short distance to the country. As Libya remained unstable in 2013, a Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force\u2013Crisis Response unit was formed and an element of this was moved to the base to be within V-22 range of Libya.<ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/article/20130515/DEFREG04/305150025 \"US Repositioning 200 Marines in Italy as Precaution for Libya Unrest.\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.stripes.com/news/marine-rapid-reaction-unit-moved-to-italy-amid-escalating-crisis-in-libya-1.221073 \"Marine rapid reaction unit moved to Italy amid escalating crisis in Libya.\"]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Italy]], most of the base including recreational facilities, daycare programs and the school were shut down in order to slow the spread of the Covid-19 Coronavirus.<ref>[https://www.stripes.com/news/facilities-on-us-bases-shuttered-as-italy-closes-just-about-everything-to-fight-coronavirus-1.622202 \"Facilities on US bases shuttered as Italy closes just about everything to fight coronavirus\"]</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n===Airport===\n[[File:US Navy 030325-N-9693M-001 Sicily's volcano, Mt.

Also in Marinai is [https://web.archive.org/web/20120423132615/http://troop53.connorpeet.com/ Boy Scout Troop 53] and Cub Scout Pack 53. Previously, \"Mineo\" was used as a housing base, but has since been returned to Italian Nationals and is no longer in service.  Temporarily deployed unaccompanied military personnel, typically from rotational squadrons deployed from the United States, are housed in bachelor enlisted quarters and bachelor officer quarters located at NAS II.\n\nFrom 1987 to 2002, there was a base housing development ''Villaggio Costanzo'' which was located in the village of Santa Maria La Stella, in the [[comune]] of [[Aci Sant'Antonio]], and approximately 60 minutes from NAS I. \nThe closest community to the base is [[Motta Sant'Anastasia]], where many military personnel and their families live in rented accommodation ''on the economy''. Relations between the Americans and the local Italian nationals are cordial, despite some anti-American demonstrations outside the base protesting the [[Iraq War]]. Many Italian nationals are employed as civilian workers at the base.\n<gallery>\nFile:US Navy 030313-N-9693M-005 Members assigned to the \"Gray Wolves\" of Electronic Attack Squadron One Four Two (VAQ-142) maneuver an EA-6B Prowler into position for a maintenance check.jpg\nFile:US Navy 030506-N-0020T-003 Lt. j.g.

Sigonella is home to more than 4,000 troops, civilian personnel, and family members.\n\nNAS Sigonella is the Navy's second largest security command, second only to that located at [[Naval Support Activity Bahrain]]. NAS Sigonella also has a large support of security personnel from NR NSF Sigonella, a Navy Reserve command based out of NOSC Detroit at [[Selfridge ANGB]], Michigan.\n\nThe base comprises two sections: NAS I was the site of the original U.S. base but is now a support facility, and NAS II which includes the runways, operations and most tenant commands. NAS I also contains the Navy Exchange and Commissary, the school, and some homes, mainly for the commodore of Task Force 67, the air station commanding officer, air station executive officer and commanding officers of tenant activities. NAS I also is host to other facilities, mainly for entertainment. NAS II is now only used as a service base.\n\n==History==\nThe United States Naval Air Facility (NAF), Sigonella, was established 15 June 1959; its first commanding officer was Captain Walter J. Frazier. The facility was conceived in the early 1950s, when plans to base U.S. Navy [[P-2 Neptune|P2V Neptune]]s at [[\u0126al Far|Hal Far]], [[Malta]] began to outgrow the facility.\n\nWhen there was no room for expansion at Malta, the U.S. Navy obtained [[NATO]] backing to be hosted by Sicilians. Italy made land available under a temporary agreement signed 25 June 1957. Six days later, Landing Ship Tank ([[Tank landing ship|LST]]s) began to deliver equipment from the Malta base.\n\nGround was broken in September, and construction on the administrative area at NAF I was started in 1958. It was built on top of an airfield where damaged fighters and bombers of the [[Luftwaffe|German Air Force]] had once landed during the [[Second World War]]. The first Americans arrived for work at Sigonella in March 1959\u2014six months before any buildings were ready\u2014and so worked for six months in [[Catania]] at a large warehouse complex called Magazzino Generale (General Warehouse), which is opposite the cemetery on the right side of the street as one enters Catania from the base.\n\nBy the end of August 1959, the NAF II airfield was available for daylight flights under [[visual flight rules]] (VFR); 24 flights were logged by 31 August.\n\nOne of Sigonella's first buildings was what is now the [[American Forces Network]] (AFN) building. In 1958, that building was Sigonella's vector (pest) control center, where [[rat]] poison was stored. The [[United States Army|Army]] [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] next used the building for their offices, later sharing it with Special Services, or what is now called [[Morale, Welfare and Recreation]] (MWR). Around 1966, AFN came to Sigonella and joined Special Services, which soon moved out, leaving the building to the broadcasters.\n\nSigonella's first flood occurred mid-September 1959. The [[Dittaino]] Bridge between NAF I and NAF II was under six feet of water on 20 September and all traffic had to go through Catania. Power outages accompanied the floods.\n\nIn 1965 the [[Aeronautica Militare|Italian Air Force]] sited at Sigonella the [[:it:41\u00ba Stormo|41st Antisubmarine Warfare Wing]] (86st Gruppo and 88st Gruppo) with mixed crews from the Air Force and Navy.\n\nIn the 1980s, \"Naval Air Facility\" Sigonella was redesignated as a \"Naval Air Station\".\n\nIn 1983 the base was named after [[World War II]] pilot Captain Cosimo Di Palma ([[:it:Cosimo Di Palma|it]]), who was shot down by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' while on a mission with the [[Italian Co-belligerent Air Force]] and was honored with the [[Medal of Military Valor|Gold medal of Military Valor]].\n[[File:US_Navy_051214-N-1120L-001_U.S._Navy_Sailors_assigned_to_Explosive_Ordnance_Disposal_Mobile_Unit_Eight_(EODMU-8),_prepare_to_load_their_zodiac_pontoon_boat_onto_a_trailer_following_an_initial_exploration_of_the_Marinai_housing.jpg|thumb|left|230px|NAS Sigonella during flooding in December 2005.]]\n\nOn the night of 10 October 1985, there were tense hours on NAS II when the Italian [[Carabinieri]], [[Italian Air Force]], and the US Army's [[Delta Force]] came close to firing upon one another following the interception by US Navy [[F-14 Tomcat]] fighters of an Egyptian [[Boeing 737]] airliner carrying the hijackers of the Italian cruise ship, the [[MS Achille Lauro|Achille Lauro]], which had been commandeered by members of the [[PLO]] on 7 October. The hijackers had killed a Jewish-American citizen [[Leon Klinghoffer]]. The F-14s instructed the Egyptian plane to land at Sigonella where the Americans had planned to take the hijackers into custody. The Italian Prime Minister [[Bettino Craxi]] instead claimed the hijackers were under Italian jurisdiction. The Italian authorities therefore refused to allow the SEALs to board the plane, threatening to open fire on the Americans had they made an attempt to do so. This move was supposedly dictated both by security concerns about [[terrorism|terrorists]] targeting Italy if the United States had had it their way, and by the Italian tradition of [[diplomacy]] with the [[Arab world]]. The ensuing stand-off lasted throughout the night, until President [[Ronald Reagan]] gave the orders for the Americans to stand down.\n[[File:US_Navy_060823-N-3013W-003_Aviation_Ordnanceman_3rd_Class_Giancarlo_Rosasarias_of_Los_Angeles,_Calif.,_directs_the_taxi_pilot_to_straighten_his_direction_of_movement_in_order_to_properly_park_a_P-3C_Orion,_after_returning_from.jpg|thumb|A taxiway on NAS Sigonella]]\nIn late 1985, work crews belonging to NMCB 133 were repairing and installing sidewalks in the housing area at NAS I when they uncovered a small stockpile of Luftwaffe antiaircraft ammunition. The stockpile had apparently belonged to an antiaircraft position that had been buried during raids in the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Allied invasion of 1943]].<ref>Stars and Stripes Europe, 25 October 1985</ref>\n\nOn 1 April 2004, the [[Defense Logistics Agency]] (DLA) opened Defense Depot Sigonella Italy on NAS II to serve as a supply base for the Mediterranean.  DLA also provides fuel and property disposal from NAS II.\n\nSigonella suffered its second major flood mid December 2005.  Over 400 service members and family evacuated. In 2006, a newly installed protective [[berm]] prevented a nearly second consecutive year of flooding.\n\nWhen NATO took [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military intervention]] to [[Libya]] in 2011, NAS Sigonella played an important role in US [[Operation Odyssey Dawn]] because of its short distance to the country. As Libya remained unstable in 2013, a Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force\u2013Crisis Response unit was formed and an element of this was moved to the base to be within V-22 range of Libya.<ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/article/20130515/DEFREG04/305150025 \"US Repositioning 200 Marines in Italy as Precaution for Libya Unrest.\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.stripes.com/news/marine-rapid-reaction-unit-moved-to-italy-amid-escalating-crisis-in-libya-1.221073 \"Marine rapid reaction unit moved to Italy amid escalating crisis in Libya.\"]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Italy]], most of the base including recreational facilities, daycare programs and the school were shut down in order to slow the spread of the virus.<ref>[https://www.stripes.com/news/facilities-on-us-bases-shuttered-as-italy-closes-just-about-everything-to-fight-coronavirus-1.622202 \"Facilities on US bases shuttered as Italy closes just about everything to fight coronavirus\"]</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n===Airport===\n[[File:US Navy 030325-N-9693M-001 Sicily's volcano, Mt.

Previously, \"Mineo\" was used as a housing base, but has since been returned to Italian Nationals and is no longer in service.  Temporarily deployed unaccompanied military personnel, typically from rotational squadrons deployed from the United States, are housed in bachelor enlisted quarters and bachelor officer quarters located at NAS II.\n\nFrom 1987 to 2002, there was a base housing development ''Villaggio Costanzo'' which was located in the village of Santa Maria La Stella, in the [[comune]] of [[Aci Sant'Antonio]], and approximately 60 minutes from NAS I. \nThe closest community to the base is [[Motta Sant'Anastasia]], where many military personnel and their families live in rented accommodation ''on the economy''. Relations between the Americans and the local Italian nationals are cordial, despite some anti-American demonstrations outside the base protesting the [[Iraq War]]. Many Italian nationals are employed as civilian workers at the base.\n<gallery>\nFile:US Navy 030313-N-9693M-005 Members assigned to the \"Gray Wolves\" of Electronic Attack Squadron One Four Two (VAQ-142) maneuver an EA-6B Prowler into position for a maintenance check.jpg\nFile:US Navy 030506-N-0020T-003 Lt. j.g.

Linguist John Swales defined discourse communities as \"groups that have goals or purposes, and use communication to achieve these goals.\"<ref name=\":1\">Borg, Erik. [http://eltj.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/4/398.full.pdf+html Discourse communities] (ELT Journal 57:4)</ref>\n\nSome examples of a discourse community might be those who read and/or contribute to a particular  academic journal, or members of an email list for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] fans. Each discourse community has its own unwritten rules about what can be said and how it can be said: for instance, the journal will not accept an article with the claim that \"Discourse is the coolest concept\"; on the other hand, members of the email list may or may not appreciate a Freudian analysis of Madonna's latest single.  Most people move within and between different discourse communities every day.\n\nSince the discourse community itself is intangible, it is easier to imagine discourse communities in terms of the fora in which they operate.  The hypothetical journal and email list can each be seen as an example of a forum, or a \"concrete, local manifestation of the operation of the discourse community.\"<ref name=\"porter\">Porter, J. (1992).  Audience and Rhetoric: An Archaeological Composition of the Discourse Community.  New Jersey: Prentice Hall.</ref>\n\nThe term was first used by [[sociolinguist]] Martin Nystrand in 1982,<ref name=\"nystrand\">Nystrand, M.

New York: Academic</ref> and further developed by American linguist [[John Swales]].<ref name=\"swales\">[[John Swales|Swales, J. M.]] (1990) ''Genre Analysis: English in academic and research settings''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>  Writing about the acquisition of academic writing styles of those who are learning [[English as an additional language]], Swales presents six defining characteristics:\n\n:A discourse community:\n:# has a broadly agreed set of common public goals.\n:# has mechanisms of intercommunication among its members.\n:# uses its participatory mechanisms primarily to provide information and feedback.\n:# utilizes and hence possesses one or more genres in the communicative furtherance of its aims.\n:# in addition to owning [[genre]]s, it has acquired some specific [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]].\n:# has a threshold level of members with a suitable degree of relevant content and discoursal expertise.\n\n[[James Porter (scholar)|James Porter]] defined the discourse community as: \"a local and temporary constraining system, defined by a body of texts (or more generally, practices) that are unified by a common focus.  A discourse community is a textual system with stated and unstated conventions, a vital history, mechanisms for wielding power, institutional hierarchies, vested interests, and so on.\" Porter held the belief that all new ideas added to a discourse community had an impact on the group, changing it forever. <ref name=\"porter\" />\n\n[[Argumentation theory|Argumentation theorists]] [[Chaim Perelman]] and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyceta offer the following statement on the conditioned nature of all discourse, which has applicability to the concept of discourse community: \"All language is the language of community, be this a community bound by biological ties, or by the practice of a common discipline or technique.  The terms used, their meaning, their definition, can only be understood in the context of the habits, ways of thought, methods, external circumstances, and tradition known to the users of those terms.  A deviation from usage requires justification ...\"<ref name=\"Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyceta\">Perelman, Chaim and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyceta (1969) ''The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation''.

(1992) ''Academic Discourse and Critical Consciousness.'' Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press.</ref>  In other words, one cannot simply produce any text\u2014it must fit the standards of the discourse community to which it is appealing.  If one wants to become a member of a certain discourse community, it requires more than learning the lingo.  It requires understanding concepts and expectations set up within that community.\n\nThe language used by discourse communities can be described as a [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] or diatype, and members generally join a discourse community through training or personal persuasion. This is in contrast to the [[speech community]] (or the \u2019native discourse community,\u2019 to use Bizzell's term), who speak a language or [[dialect]] inherited by birth or adoption. Ideas from speech communities and interpretive communities were what lead to the emergence of the notion of discourse communities. <ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n==Designing a discourse community==\n[[File:Discourse Community Map.png|thumb|A discourse community map created for fitness|left|502x502px]] \nOne tool that is commonly used for designing a discourse community is a map. \nThe map could provide the common goals, values, specialized vocabulary and specialized genre of the discourse community.

These students were given few opportunities to contribute in the classroom and when they did, they would only be permitted to echo someone else's voice on particular views and opinions.

Discourse can be connected to the concept of audience in that both the audience and the writer partake in a series of historical contingencies that place the writer and audience into a larger conversation with one another. It is an \"identity kit\" of sorts: \"A Discourse is a sort of 'identity kit' which comes complete with the appropriate costume and instructions on how to act, talk, and often write, so as to take on a particular social role that others will recognize. Imagine what an identity kit to play the role of Sherlock Holmes would involve: certain clothes, certain ways of using language (oral language and print), certain attitudes and beliefs, allegiance to a certain life style, and certain ways of interacting with others. We can call all these factors together, as they are integrated around the identity of 'Sherlock Holmes, Master Detective' the 'Sherlock Holmes Discourse'. This example also makes clear that 'Discourse', as I am using the term, does not involve just talk or just language. (Gee 142) Furthermore, discourses are not individualistic, but rather community-based, in official (institutional frameworks) capacities, unofficial (social groups) capacities, or both. Specifically, \"Discourses are always embedded in a medley of social institutions, and often involve various 'props' like books and magazines of various sorts, laboratories, classrooms, buildings of various sorts, various technologies, and a myriad of other objects from sewing needles (for sewing circles) through birds (for bird watchers) to basketball courts and basketballs (for basketball players)\" (143).\n\nRegarding contemporary rhetorical communities, Zappen, et al., states, \"Thus a contemporary rhetorical community is less a collection of people joined by shared beliefs and values than a public space or forum that permits these people to engage each other and form limited or local communities of belief.\"<ref>Zappen, James P., Laura J.

Linguist John Swales defined discourse communities as \"groups that have goals or purposes, and use communication to achieve these goals.\"<ref name=\":1\">Borg, Erik.

Each discourse community has its own unwritten rules about what can be said and how it can be said: for instance, the journal will not accept an article with the claim that \"Discourse is the coolest concept\"; on the other hand, members of the email list may or may not appreciate a Freudian analysis of Madonna's latest single.  Most people move within and between different discourse communities every day.\n\nSince the discourse community itself is intangible, it is easier to imagine discourse communities in terms of the fora in which they operate.  The hypothetical journal and email list can each be seen as an example of a forum, or a \"concrete, local manifestation of the operation of the discourse community.\"<ref name=\"porter\">Porter, J. (1992).  Audience and Rhetoric: An Archaeological Composition of the Discourse Community.  New Jersey: Prentice Hall.</ref>\n\nThe term was first used by [[sociolinguist]] Martin Nystrand in 1982,<ref name=\"nystrand\">Nystrand, M. (1982) ''What Writers Know: The Language, Process, and Structure of Written Discourse.'' New York: Academic</ref> and further developed by American linguist [[John Swales]].<ref name=\"swales\">[[John Swales|Swales, J. M.]] (1990) ''Genre Analysis: English in academic and research settings''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>  Writing about the acquisition of academic writing styles of those who are learning [[English as an additional language]], Swales presents six defining characteristics:\n\n:A discourse community:\n:# has a broadly agreed set of common public goals.\n:# has mechanisms of intercommunication among its members.\n:# uses its participatory mechanisms primarily to provide information and feedback.\n:# utilizes and hence possesses one or more genres in the communicative furtherance of its aims.\n:# in addition to owning [[genre]]s, it has acquired some specific [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]].\n:# has a threshold level of members with a suitable degree of relevant content and discoursal expertise.\n\n[[James Porter (scholar)|James Porter]] defined the discourse community as: \"a local and temporary constraining system, defined by a body of texts (or more generally, practices) that are unified by a common focus.  A discourse community is a textual system with stated and unstated conventions, a vital history, mechanisms for wielding power, institutional hierarchies, vested interests, and so on.\" Porter held the belief that all new ideas added to a discourse community had an impact on the group, changing it forever. <ref name=\"porter\" />\n\n[[Argumentation theory|Argumentation theorists]] [[Chaim Perelman]] and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyceta offer the following statement on the conditioned nature of all discourse, which has applicability to the concept of discourse community: \"All language is the language of community, be this a community bound by biological ties, or by the practice of a common discipline or technique.  The terms used, their meaning, their definition, can only be understood in the context of the habits, ways of thought, methods, external circumstances, and tradition known to the users of those terms.  A deviation from usage requires justification ...\"<ref name=\"Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyceta\">Perelman, Chaim and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyceta (1969) ''The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation''. Trans.  John Wilkinson and Purcell Weaver.</ref>\n\n\"Producing text within a discourse community,\" according to [[Patricia Bizzell]], \"cannot take place unless the writer can define her goals in terms of the community's interpretive conventions.\"<ref name=\"bizzell\">Bizzell, P. (1992) ''Academic Discourse and Critical Consciousness.'' Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press.</ref>  In other words, one cannot simply produce any text\u2014it must fit the standards of the discourse community to which it is appealing.  If one wants to become a member of a certain discourse community, it requires more than learning the lingo.  It requires understanding concepts and expectations set up within that community.\n\nThe language used by discourse communities can be described as a [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] or diatype, and members generally join a discourse community through training or personal persuasion. This is in contrast to the [[speech community]] (or the \u2019native discourse community,\u2019 to use Bizzell's term), who speak a language or [[dialect]] inherited by birth or adoption. Ideas from speech communities and interpretive communities were what lead to the emergence of the notion of discourse communities. <ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n==Designing a discourse community==\n[[File:Discourse Community Map.png|thumb|A discourse community map created for fitness|left|502x502px]] \nOne tool that is commonly used for designing a discourse community is a map. \nThe map could provide the common goals, values, specialized vocabulary and specialized genre of the discourse community.

According to Swales this may be why the term \"discourse community\" is now being replaced by \"community of practice,\" which is a term from sociocultural theory. \"Community of practice\" is defined clearly as having \"mutual engagement\" and \"joint enterprise\" which separates it from the more widely accepted implications of a discourse community.  <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Borg|first=E.|date=2003-10-01|title=Discourse community|journal=ELT Journal|language=en|volume=57|issue=4|pages=398\u2013400|doi=10.1093/elt/57.4.398|issn=0951-0893}}</ref>A community of practice requires a group of people negotiating work and working toward a common goal using shared or common resources.<ref name=\":0\"/> These virtual discourse communities consist of a group of people brought together \"by natural will and a set of shared ideas and ideals\".<ref>Kowch, E., & Schwier.

Members of the discourse community take on either assigned or maintained roles which serve as discursive authority, rights, expectations and constraints.

The circulation of texts form groups of communities that might not otherwise existed prior to being untied by the circulation of documents. \"These and other social complexities suggest a more subtle and varied sociological vocabulary is needed to describe the set of relations within text circulation networks as well as to describe the ways genres mediate the actions and relations within these social collectivities, such as that provided by sociocultural theories of genre and activity.\"<ref>Bazerman, C.

These people begin to adapt to standards of that discourse community. However, involvement in one discourse community does not hinder participation in other groups based on a pursuit of a common goal. In some cases, under specific standards, traces of discourse interference may appear from other standards.<ref>Duszak, A. (1997). Culture and styles of academic discourse.

Their study discusses their frustration with the overwhelming number of school policies and practices which create obstacles for certain student voices to be heard,\nminimizing lower-track students' input shaping mainstream academic curriculum. These students were given few opportunities to contribute in the classroom and when they did, they would only be permitted to echo someone else's voice on particular views and opinions. With resentment, Yerrick and Gilbert state \"There was no attempt to match the home-based discourse with the academic discourse promoted in the classroom, as has been proven problematic through other studies as well.\"<ref>Yerrick, R.
