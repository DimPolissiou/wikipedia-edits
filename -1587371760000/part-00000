{"title_page": "List of visitors of the International Space Station", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\nThis is a list of all of the visitors to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), including long-term crew, short-term visitors, and space tourists, in alphabetical order. ISS crew names are in '''bold'''. The suffix ''(twice, thrice, ...)'' refers to the individual's number of spaceflights to the ISS, not the total [[List of spaceflight records#Most spaceflights|number of spaceflights]]. Entries without a flag symbol indicate that the individual was an American citizen at launch. Entries without a female symbol ([[File:Symbol venus.svg|10px]]) are men.\n\n== Statistics ==\n[[File:ISS Visitors.svg|right|400px]]\n{{As of|2017|07|28|df=US}}, 227 individuals have made 393 spaceflights to the ISS, including the six people currently at the ISS ([[Expedition 56]]). Two men made five spaceflights to the ISS, while five people made four, 29 people made three and 85 people made two. Note that this list assigns individuals with [[dual citizenship]] to their country of primary residence at time of launch (for example, the [[Iran]]ian-[[United States|American]] space tourist [[Anousheh Ansari]] is only listed under the [[United States]]).\n\nAll private space travel is aboard the Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft]]. When only two crew members are required in the three seat Soyuz, and additional cargo is not sent, the additional seat is sold to the general public through [[Space Adventures]]. Private travelers remain on the ISS during handover from one expedition crew to the next, generally a week or two. The [[NASA]]  [[Space Shuttle]] carried seven crew members, and the longest docking with the ISS was 11 days. Many visitors to the ISS were accommodated for short periods during NASA shuttle dockings. NASA stated it was \"not interested\" in [[private spaceflight]] from the beginning of the ISS and has not changed its position.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bridges |first=Andrew |url=http://www.space.com/news/spacestation/mir_tour_iss_001101.html |title=The ISS won't be hosting paying guests anytime soon - at least not as far as NASA is concerned |publisher=SPACE.com |date=2000-11-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002185427/http://www.space.com/news/spacestation/mir_tour_iss_001101.html |archivedate=2009-10-02}}</ref>\n\n===Long-term ISS crew, by nationality===\n[[File:Tracy Caldwell Dyson in Cupola ISS.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Tracy Caldwell Dyson]] in the ''[[Cupola (ISS module)|Cupola]]'' module of the International Space Station observing [[Earth]]]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Nationality\n!ISS Crew/Members\n|-\n| {{flag|United States}} || 51\n|-\n| {{flag|Russia}} || 39\n|-\n| {{flag|Japan}} || 6 \n|-\n| {{flag|Germany}} || 3\n|-\n| {{flag|Italy}} || 3\n|-\n| {{flag|France}} || 2\n|-\n| {{flag|Canada}} || 2\n|-\n| {{flag|Belgium}} || 1\n|-\n| {{flag|Netherlands}} || 1\n|-\n| {{flag|United Kingdom}} || 1\n|-\n| '''Total''' || 109\n|}\n\n===All visitors, by nationality===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Nationality\n!Flights<!--individuals times flights.

ISS crew names are in '''bold'''. The suffix ''(twice, thrice, ...)'' refers to the individual's number of spaceflights to the ISS, not his or her total [[List of spaceflight records#Most spaceflights|number of spaceflights]]. Entries without a flag symbol indicate that the individual was an American citizen at launch. Entries without a female symbol ([[File:Symbol venus.svg|10px]]) are men.\n\n== Statistics ==\n[[File:ISS Visitors.svg|right|400px]]\n{{As of|2017|07|28|df=US}}, 227 individuals have made 393 spaceflights to the ISS, including the six people currently at the ISS ([[Expedition 56]]). Two men made five spaceflights to the ISS, while five people made four, 29 people made three and 85 people made two. Note that this list assigns individuals with [[dual citizenship]] to their country of primary residence at time of launch (for example, the [[Iran]]ian-[[United States|American]] space tourist [[Anousheh Ansari]] is only listed under the [[United States]]).\n\nAll private space travel is aboard the Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft]]. When only two crew members are required in the three seat Soyuz, and additional cargo is not sent, the additional seat is sold to the general public through [[Space Adventures]]. Private travelers remain on the ISS during handover from one expedition crew to the next, generally a week or two. The [[NASA]]  [[Space Shuttle]] carried seven crew members, and the longest docking with the ISS was 11 days. Many visitors to the ISS were accommodated for short periods during NASA shuttle dockings. NASA stated it was \"not interested\" in [[private spaceflight]] from the beginning of the ISS and has not changed its position.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bridges |first=Andrew |url=http://www.space.com/news/spacestation/mir_tour_iss_001101.html |title=The ISS won't be hosting paying guests anytime soon - at least not as far as NASA is concerned |publisher=SPACE.com |date=2000-11-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002185427/http://www.space.com/news/spacestation/mir_tour_iss_001101.html |archivedate=2009-10-02}}</ref>\n\n===Long-term ISS crew, by nationality===\n[[File:Tracy Caldwell Dyson in Cupola ISS.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Tracy Caldwell Dyson]] in the ''[[Cupola (ISS module)|Cupola]]'' module of the International Space Station observing [[Earth]]]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Nationality\n!ISS Crew/Members\n|-\n| {{flag|United States}} || 51\n|-\n| {{flag|Russia}} || 39\n|-\n| {{flag|Japan}} || 6 \n|-\n| {{flag|Germany}} || 3\n|-\n| {{flag|Italy}} || 3\n|-\n| {{flag|France}} || 2\n|-\n| {{flag|Canada}} || 2\n|-\n| {{flag|Belgium}} || 1\n|-\n| {{flag|Netherlands}} || 1\n|-\n| {{flag|United Kingdom}} || 1\n|-\n| '''Total''' || 109\n|}\n\n===All visitors, by nationality===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Nationality\n!Flights<!--individuals times flights.

Rico swallows Dave's collection of [[snowglobes]] along with a canister of a green substance called the Medusa Serum before the four escape and are chased through the canals and streets of Venice by Dave's henchmen.\n\nWhen cornered, they are rescued by a group of animals from an [[Arctic]] elite undercover inter-species task force agency called \"The North Wind\" consisting of their leader, a [[wolf]] whose name is classified in which Skipper mistakenly calls him \"Classified\" throughout this film, a [[harp seal]] demolitionist named Short Fuse, a [[polar bear]] named Corporal, and an intelligent [[snowy owl]] named Eva, who Kowalski instantly falls in love with. Their mission is to help animals who can't help themselves and have been fighting Dave to protect the penguin population.\n\nAt their hideout, their communication systems are hacked by Dave, who reveals that he has an enormous supply of the Medusa Serum and that he intends to capture the penguins out of every zoo he was kicked out of. Viewing the penguins as a hindrance to their mission, Classified tranquilizes the group and sends them to their most remote base (which happens to be on [[Madagascar]]) but the penguins awaken mid-flight and crash land in the [[Sahara Desert]] before making their way to [[Shanghai, China]], which they mistake for [[Dublin, Ireland]]. Discovering Dave's next target in Shanghai using Dave's snowglobe collection, the penguins ship themselves to the same current location and make their way to the zoo. Skipper disguises Private as a mermaid-tailed penguin (a tourist attraction) to distract Dave from his real target, but Private is captured along with the Shanghai penguins after the North Wind arrives to put a stop to Dave's plan. The penguins take the North Wind's high-tech plane to give chase, but inadvertently self-destruct the machine. They manage to track Private to an island base, using a tracking device planted on him when Classified darted them before planting them in a flight to Madagascar. \n\nMeanwhile, on the island, Dave demonstrates his way to use the medusa serum to genetically mutate the penguins into hideous monsters as an effort to make humans disgusted by them as revenge. Skipper and Classified argue on the best means to rescue the captives and stop Dave, finally settling on Classified's plan of a frontal assault and Skipper agrees to act as a diversion. The North Wind manages to corner Dave in his lair only to be captured by Dave's henchmen as well as the other penguins. Dave demonstrates his mutation ray at full power on Private, apparently disintegrating him with the beam, but unbeknownst to them he escapes at the last minute by using a paper clip he swallowed earlier. Private rescues the North Wind members, who want to [[tactical formation|regroup]] due to lack of equipment, but Private, not wanting to leave anyone behind goes to stop Dave. As Dave's submarine docks at [[New York City|New York]] with the promise of returning the penguins he found to the zoo, he turns the ray on the rest of the penguins, mutating them all into hideous monsters. The city erupts into chaos as the brainwashed, mutated penguins run amok on the terrified human crowd. Getting Skipper, Kowalski and Rico back to their senses, Private decides to connect himself into the ray to return them to normal. After fending off Dave and his henchman, they manage to turn all the penguins back to normal in one huge blast.\n\nPrivate is left partially mutated from the machine while the rest of the penguins are restored to normal. Despite his strange new look, the Penguins show their gratitude and new-found respect for Private. Dave (who was caught in the blast) has been turned into a pipsqueak version of himself and is trapped in a snow globe where he is admired by a little girl. Finally seeing one another as equals, Classified promises to grant the Penguins anything they want. In addition to Kowalski getting a kiss from Eva, the Penguins are given their own jet packs and they then fly off above the clouds looking for their new adventures.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], the Penguins return to the circus and plug Mort into the ray and use him to revert Private back to normal. Mort does not appear to show any side effects from the ray until he manages to swallow King Julien whole, much to the latter's amusement.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{See also|List of Madagascar (franchise) characters}}\n[[File:John Malkovich & Benedict Cumberbatch, Penguins of Madagascar, SDCC 2014.jpg|thumb|[[John Malkovich]] and [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] talking at the ''Penguins of Madagascar'' panel at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]]]\n* [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] as Skipper, the leader of the [[penguin]]s.<ref name=USATPeek>{{cite news|last1=Truitt|first1=Brian|title=Sneak Peek: 'Penguins of Madagascar'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/06/08/penguins-of-madagascar-first-look/9727597/|accessdate=June 9, 2014|work=USA Today|date=June 8, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] as Kowalski, the brains of the penguins.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[Christopher Knights]] as Private, the rookie of the penguins.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as Rico,<ref name=VarietyReview>{{cite news|last1=Berkshire|first1=Geoff|title=Film Review: \u2018Penguins of Madagascar\u2019|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-penguins-of-madagascar-1201353894/|accessdate=November 12, 2014|work=Variety|date=November 12, 2014}}</ref> the loose cannon of the penguins.\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as Classified, a British [[wolf]] and team leader of the North Wind.<ref name=WrapCumberMalko /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/11/benedict-cumberbatch-penguins-of-madagascar |title=Benedict Cumberbatch to voice wolf in new Madagascar movie |first=Ben |last=Beaumont-Thomas |date=June 11, 2014|publisher=The Guardian|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/11/26/7290373/benedict-cumberbatch-penguins |title=Here are some of Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s most oddly sexy lines from Penguins of Madagascar |first=Emily Todd |last=VanDerWerff |date=November 26, 2014 |website=Vox}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/penguins-of-madagascar-actor-benedict-cumberbatch-thinks-he-worked-on-a-disney-film-105013.html |title=Benedict Cumberbatch Thinks 'Penguins of Madagascar' is A Disney Film |date=October 24, 2014 |website=Cartoon Brew}}</ref>\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Short Fuse, a Belgian explosive and demolitions expert [[harp seal]] and a member of the North Wind.<ref name=WrapDateSwitch>{{cite web|last=Cunningham|first=Todd|title=DreamWorks Animation Switches Release Dates on \u2018Penguins of Madagascar\u2019 and \u2018Home\u2019|url=https://www.thewrap.com/dreamworks-animation-switches-release-dates-on-penguins-of-madagascar-and-home/|publisher=The Wrap|accessdate=May 21, 2014|date=May 20, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Annet Mahendru]] as Eva, a Russian [[snowy owl]], Kowalski's love interest, and the north wind's intelligence analyst.<ref name=\"USATPeek\" />\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Corporal, a Norwegian [[polar bear]] and a member of the North Wind who serves as the muscle.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Dave, a villainous and disgruntled [[octopus]] who has the human disguise of Dr. Octavius Brine.<ref name=\"WrapCumberMalko\" /><ref name=\"USATPeek\" /><ref name=\"EWTralierSpies\">{{cite news|last1=McHenry|first1=Jackson|title='The Penguins of Madagascar' trailer: Spies and Benedict Cumberbatch -- VIDEO|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/06/11/penguins-madagascar-benedict-cumberbatch/|accessdate=June 13, 2014|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 11, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Werner Herzog]] as a documentary filmmaker.<ref name=SlashFilmRecap>{{cite web|last1=Han|first1=Angie|title=Penguins of Madagascar\u2019 Footage Recap and Panel Highlights [Comic Con 2014]|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/penguins-of-madagascar-footage-comic-con/|publisher=/Film|accessdate=July 25, 2014|date=July 25, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]] as King Julien XIII, a [[ring-tailed lemur]].\n* [[Andy Richter]] as Mort, a [[Goodman's mouse lemur]].\n\n==Production==\nA [[direct-to-video]] film featuring the penguins had been in the works since 2005 when the first ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' film was released, with a release date initially planned for 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fritz|first=Ben|title=D'Works will rely on animal instinct|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117929100|accessdate=October 27, 2011|newspaper=Variety|date=September 14, 2005}}</ref> The studio announced in March 2011 that the penguin characters would be given their own feature film to be directed by [[Simon J.

After saving it from a pack of [[leopard seals]] on an abandoned ship, and accidentally setting themselves adrift on an iceberg, the egg hatches into their new member, Private, (before the events of the [[Madagascar (2005 film)|first film]]).\n\nTen years later (after the events of the [[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted|previous film]]), the penguins decide to leave the circus to celebrate Private's birthday by breaking into [[United States Bullion Depository|Fort Knox]] in order to treat him to a discontinued snack called \"Cheezy Dibbles\" in the vending machine of their break room. Despite this, Private begins to feel out of place with the team, as he is constantly described as being the \"secretary/mascot\".\n\nSuddenly, they are abducted by the machine and sent to [[Venice]], [[Italy]] by Dr. Octavius Brine, a renowned geneticist who reveals he is actually an octopus named Dave, who has grown resentful of penguins after their cuteness had him shunned from every zoo and aquarium across the globe. Rico swallows Dave's collection of [[snowglobes]] along with a canister of a green substance called the Medusa Serum before the four escape and are chased through the canals and streets of Venice by Dave's henchmen.\n\nWhen cornered, they are rescued by a group of animals from an [[Arctic]] elite undercover inter-species task force agency called \"The North Wind\" consisting of their leader, a [[wolf]] whose name is classified in which Skipper mistakenly calls him \"Classified\" throughout this film, a [[harp seal]] demolitionist named Short Fuse, a [[polar bear]] named Corporal, and an intelligent [[snowy owl]] named Eva, who Kowalski instantly falls in love with. Their mission is to help animals who can't help themselves and have been fighting Dave to protect the penguin population.\n\nAt their hideout, their communication systems are hacked by Dave, who reveals that he has an enormous supply of the Medusa Serum and that he intends to capture the penguins out of every zoo he was kicked out of. Viewing the penguins as a hindrance to their mission, Classified tranquilizes the group and sends them to their most remote base (which happens to be on [[Madagascar]]) but the penguins awaken mid-flight and crash land in the [[Sahara Desert]] before making their way to [[Shanghai, China]], which they mistake for [[Dublin, Ireland]]. Discovering Dave's next target in Shanghai using Dave's snowglobe collection, the penguins ship themselves to the same current location and make their way to the zoo. Skipper disguises Private as a mermaid-tailed penguin (a tourist attraction) to distract Dave from his real target, but Private is captured along with the Shanghai penguins after the North Wind arrives to put a stop to Dave's plan. The penguins take the North Wind's high-tech plane to give chase, but inadvertently self-destruct the machine. They manage to track Private to an island base, using a tracking device planted on him when Classified darted them before planting them in a flight to Madagascar. \n\nMeanwhile, on the island, Dave demonstrates his way to use the medusa serum to genetically mutate the penguins into hideous monsters as an effort to make humans disgusted by them as revenge. Skipper and Classified argue on the best means to rescue the captives and stop Dave, finally settling on Classified's plan of a frontal assault and Skipper agrees to act as a diversion. The North Wind manages to corner Dave in his lair only to be captured by Dave's henchmen as well as the other penguins. Dave demonstrates his mutation ray at full power on Private, apparently disintegrating him with the beam, but unbeknownst to them he escapes at the last minute by using a paper clip he swallowed earlier. Private rescues the North Wind members, who want to [[tactical formation|regroup]] due to lack of equipment, but Private, not wanting to leave anyone behind goes to stop Dave. As Dave's submarine docks at [[New York City|New York]] with the promise of returning the penguins he found to the zoo, he turns the ray on the rest of the penguins, mutating them all into hideous monsters. The city erupts into chaos as the brainwashed, mutated penguins run amok on the terrified human crowd. Getting Skipper, Kowalski and Rico back to their senses, Private decides to connect himself into the ray to return them to normal. After fending off Dave and his henchman, they manage to turn all the penguins back to normal in one huge blast.\n\nPrivate is left partially mutated from the machine while the rest of the penguins are restored to normal. Despite his strange new look, the Penguins show their gratitude and new-found respect for Private. Dave (who was caught in the blast) has been turned into a pipsqueak version of himself and is trapped in a snow globe where he is admired by a little girl. Finally seeing one another as equals, Classified promises to grant the Penguins anything they want. In addition to Kowalski getting a kiss from Eva, the Penguins are given their own jet packs and they then fly off above the clouds looking for their new adventures.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], the Penguins return to the circus and plug Mort into the ray and use him to revert Private back to normal. Mort does not appear to show any side effects from the ray until he manages to swallow King Julien whole, much to the latter's amusement.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{See also|List of Madagascar (franchise) characters}}\n[[File:John Malkovich & Benedict Cumberbatch, Penguins of Madagascar, SDCC 2014.jpg|thumb|[[John Malkovich]] and [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] talking at the ''Penguins of Madagascar'' panel at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]]]\n* [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] as Skipper, the leader of the [[penguin]]s.<ref name=USATPeek>{{cite news|last1=Truitt|first1=Brian|title=Sneak Peek: 'Penguins of Madagascar'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/06/08/penguins-of-madagascar-first-look/9727597/|accessdate=June 9, 2014|work=USA Today|date=June 8, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] as Kowalski, the brains of the penguins.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[Christopher Knights]] as Private, the rookie of the penguins.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as Rico,<ref name=VarietyReview>{{cite news|last1=Berkshire|first1=Geoff|title=Film Review: \u2018Penguins of Madagascar\u2019|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-penguins-of-madagascar-1201353894/|accessdate=November 12, 2014|work=Variety|date=November 12, 2014}}</ref> the loose cannon of the penguins.\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as Classified, a British [[wolf]] and team leader of the North Wind.<ref name=WrapCumberMalko /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/11/benedict-cumberbatch-penguins-of-madagascar |title=Benedict Cumberbatch to voice wolf in new Madagascar movie |first=Ben |last=Beaumont-Thomas |date=June 11, 2014|publisher=The Guardian|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/11/26/7290373/benedict-cumberbatch-penguins |title=Here are some of Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s most oddly sexy lines from Penguins of Madagascar |first=Emily Todd |last=VanDerWerff |date=November 26, 2014 |website=Vox}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/penguins-of-madagascar-actor-benedict-cumberbatch-thinks-he-worked-on-a-disney-film-105013.html |title=Benedict Cumberbatch Thinks 'Penguins of Madagascar' is A Disney Film |date=October 24, 2014 |website=Cartoon Brew}}</ref>\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Short Fuse, a Belgian explosive and demolitions expert [[harp seal]] and a member of the North Wind.<ref name=WrapDateSwitch>{{cite web|last=Cunningham|first=Todd|title=DreamWorks Animation Switches Release Dates on \u2018Penguins of Madagascar\u2019 and \u2018Home\u2019|url=https://www.thewrap.com/dreamworks-animation-switches-release-dates-on-penguins-of-madagascar-and-home/|publisher=The Wrap|accessdate=May 21, 2014|date=May 20, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Annet Mahendru]] as Eva, a Russian [[snowy owl]], Kowalski's love interest, and the north wind's intelligence analyst.<ref name=\"USATPeek\" />\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Corporal, a Norwegian [[polar bear]] and a member of the North Wind who serves as the muscle.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Dave, a villainous and disgruntled [[octopus]] who has the human disguise of Dr. Octavius Brine.<ref name=\"WrapCumberMalko\" /><ref name=\"USATPeek\" /><ref name=\"EWTralierSpies\">{{cite news|last1=McHenry|first1=Jackson|title='The Penguins of Madagascar' trailer: Spies and Benedict Cumberbatch -- VIDEO|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/06/11/penguins-madagascar-benedict-cumberbatch/|accessdate=June 13, 2014|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 11, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Werner Herzog]] as a documentary filmmaker.<ref name=SlashFilmRecap>{{cite web|last1=Han|first1=Angie|title=Penguins of Madagascar\u2019 Footage Recap and Panel Highlights [Comic Con 2014]|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/penguins-of-madagascar-footage-comic-con/|publisher=/Film|accessdate=July 25, 2014|date=July 25, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]] as King Julien XIII, a [[ring-tailed lemur]].\n* [[Andy Richter]] as Mort, a [[Goodman's mouse lemur]].\n\n==Production==\nA [[direct-to-video]] film featuring the penguins had been in the works since 2005 when the first ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' film was released, with a release date initially planned for 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fritz|first=Ben|title=D'Works will rely on animal instinct|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117929100|accessdate=October 27, 2011|newspaper=Variety|date=September 14, 2005}}</ref> The studio announced in March 2011 that the penguin characters would be given their own feature film to be directed by [[Simon J.

This is indicated by a number (or sometimes two), indicating the fraction involved. The [[Musical note|notes]] involved are also often grouped with a bracket or (in older notation) a slur.\n\nThe most common type of tuplet is the triplet.\n==Terminology==\nThe modern term 'tuplet' come from  [[rebracketing]] of compond word like quintu(s)-(u)plet and sex(s)-(u)plet, and from related mathematical terms such as \"[[tuple]]\", \"-uplet\" and \"-plet\", which are used to form terms denoting [[multiplet]]s (''Oxford English Dictionary'', entries \"multiplet\", \"-plet, ''comb. form''\", \"-let, ''suffix''\", and \"-et, ''suffix''<sup>1</sup>\"). An alternative modern term, \"irrational rhythm\", was originally borrowed from Greek [[Meter (poetry)|prosody]] where it referred to \"a syllable having a metrical value not corresponding to its actual time-value, or ... a metrical foot containing such a syllable\" (''Oxford English Dictionary'', entry \"irrational\"). The term would be incorrect if used in the [[irrational number|mathematical sense]] (because the note-values are [[rational number|rational]] fractions) or in the more general sense of \"unreasonable, utterly illogical, absurd\".\n\nAlternative terms found occasionally are \"artificial division\" {{harv|Jones|1974|loc=19}}, \"abnormal divisions\" {{harv|Donato|1963|loc=34}}, \"irregular rhythm\" {{harv|Read|1964|loc=181}}, and \"irregular rhythmic groupings\" {{harv|Kennedy|1994}}. The term \"[[polyrhythm]]\" (or \"polymeter\"), sometimes incorrectly used of \"tuplets\", actually refers to the simultaneous use of opposing time signatures {{harv|Read|1964|loc=167}}.\n\nBesides \"triplet\", the terms \"duplet\", \"quadruplet\", \"quintuplet\", \"sextuplet\", \"septuplet\", and \"octuplet\" are used frequently. The terms \"nonuplet\", \"decuplet\", \"undecuplet\", \"dodecuplet\", and \"tredecuplet\" had been suggested but up until 1925 had not caught on ({{harvnb|Dunstan|1925}}, {{Page needed|date=September 2013}}). By 1964 the terms \"nonuplet\" and \"decuplet\" were usual, while subdivisions by greater numbers were more commonly described as \"group of eleven notes\", \"group of twelve notes\", and so on {{harv|Read|1964|loc=189}}.\n\n== Triplet ==\n\nThe most common tuplet {{harv|Schonbrun|2007|loc=8}} is the '''triplet''' ([[German language|Ger.]] ''Triole'', [[French language|Fr.]] ''triolet'', [[Italian language|It.]] ''terzina'' or ''tripletta'', [[Spanish language|Sp.]] ''tresillo''). Whereas normally two [[quarter note]]s (crotchets) are the same [[duration (music)|duration]] as a [[half note]] (minim), three triplet quarter notes have that same duration, so the duration of a triplet quarter note is {{2/3}} the [[duration (music)|duration]] of a standard quarter note.\n\n: <score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\"> \\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 2/4\n   \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n   c4 c\n   \\tuplet 3/2 { c4 c c }\n}\n</score>\n\nSimilarly, three triplet [[eighth notes]] (quavers) are equal in duration to one quarter note. If several note values appear under the triplet bracket, they are all affected the same way, reduced to {{2/3}} their original duration.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\"> \\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 2/4\n   \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n   c8 c c c\n   \\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c } \\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c }\n}\n</score>\n\nThe triplet indication may also apply to notes of different values, for example a quarter note followed by one eighth note, in which case the quarter note may be regarded as two triplet eighths tied together {{harv|Gehrkens|1921|loc=19}}.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\"> \\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 2/4\n   \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n   \\tuplet 3/2 { c4 c8 } \\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c4 }\n}\n</score>\n\nIn some older scores, rhythms like this would be notated as a [[Dotted note|dotted]] eighth note and a sixteenth note as a kind of shorthand {{harv|Troeger|2003|loc=172}} presumably so that the beaming more clearly shows the beats.\n\n== Tuplet notation ==\n\n=== Notation ===\nTuplets are typically notated either with a bracket or with a number above or below the [[Beam (music)|beam]] if the notes are beamed together. Sometimes, the tuplet is notated with a [[ratio]] (instead of just a number) \u2014 with the first number in the ratio indicating the number of notes in the tuplet and the second number indicating the number of normal notes they have the same duration as \u2014 or with a ratio and a note value.\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 5/4\n   \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n   \\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c }\n   \\once \\override TupletBracket.bracket-visibility = ##t \\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c }\n   \\once \\override TupletNumber.text = #tuplet-number::calc-fraction-text \\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c }\n     \\once \\override TupletNumber.text =\n    #(tuplet-number::append-note-wrapper\n      (tuplet-number::non-default-tuplet-fraction-text 3 2) \"8\") \\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c }\n} }\n</score>\n\n=== Rhythm ===\n\n==== Simple meter ====\nFor other tuplets, the number indicates a [[ratio]] to the next ''lower'' normal value in the prevailing meter (a [[Power of two|power of 2]] in [[simple meter]]). So a '''quintuplet''' ('''quintolet''' or '''pentuplet''' {{harv|Cunningham|2007|loc=111}}) indicated with the numeral 5 means that five of the indicated note value total the [[duration (music)|duration]] normally occupied by four (or, as a division of a dotted note in compound time, three), equivalent to the ''second'' higher note value. For example, five quintuplet eighth notes total the same duration as a half note (or, in {{music|time|3|8}} or compound meters such as {{music|time|6|8}}, {{music|time|9|8}}, etc. time, a dotted quarter note).\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\"> \\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 2/4\n   \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n   c8 c c c\n   \\tuplet 5/4 { c8 c c c c }\n   c2\n}\n</score>\n\nSome numbers are used inconsistently: for example '''septuplets''' ('''septolets''' or '''septimoles''') usually indicate 7 notes in the [[duration (music)|duration]] of 4\u2014or in compound meter 7 for 6\u2014but may sometimes be used to mean 7 notes in the duration of 8 {{harv|Read|1964|loc=183\u201384}}. Thus, a septuplet lasting a whole note can be written with either quarter notes (7:4) or eighth notes (7:8).\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\"> \\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 4/4\n   \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n   \\tuplet 7/4 { c4 c c c c c c }\n   \\tuplet 7/8 { c8 c c c c c c }\n}\n</score>\n\nTo avoid ambiguity, composers sometimes write the ratio explicitly instead of just a single number. This is also done for cases like 7:11, where the validity of this practice is established by the complexity of the figure. A French alternative is to write ''pour'' (\"for\") or ''de'' (\"of\") in place of the colon, or above the bracketed \"irregular\" number {{harv|Read|1964|loc=219\u201321}}. This reflects the French usage of, for example, \"six-pour-quatre\" as an alternative name for the ''sextolet'' ({{harvnb|Damour, Burnett, and Elwart|1838|loc=79}}; {{harvnb|Hubbard|1924|loc=480}}).\n\nThere are disagreements about the '''sextuplet''' (pronounced with stress on the first syllable, according to {{harvnb|Baker|1895|loc=177}})\u2014which is also called '''sestole''', '''sestolet''', '''sextole''', or '''sextolet''' ({{harvnb|Baker|1895|loc=177}}; {{harvnb|Cooper|1973|loc=32}}; {{harvnb|Latham|2002}}; {{harvnb|Shedlock|1876|loc=62, 68, 87, 93}}; {{harvnb|Stainer and Barrett|1876|loc=395}}; {{harvnb|Taylor|1879\u201389}}; {{harvnb|Taylor|2001}}). This six-part division may be regarded either as a triplet with each note divided in half (2 + 2 + 2)\u2014therefore with an accent on the first, third, and fifth notes\u2014or else as an ordinary duple pattern with each note subdivided into triplets (3 + 3) and accented on both the first and fourth notes. This is indicated by the beaming in the example below.\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\"> \\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 2/4\n   \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n   \\tuplet 6/4 { c16 \\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 c \\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 c c }\n   \\tuplet 6/4 { c16 c \\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 c c c }\n}\n</score>\n\nSome authorities treat both groupings as equally valid forms ({{harvnb|Damour, Burnett, and Elwart|1838|loc=80}}; {{harvnb|K\u00f6hler|1858|loc=2:52\u201353}}; {{harvnb|Latham|2002}}; {{harvnb|Marx|1853|loc=114}}; {{harvnb|Read|1964|loc=215}}), while others dispute this, holding the first type to be the \"true\" (or \"real\") sextuplet, and the second type to be properly a \"double triplet\", which should always be written and named as such ({{harvnb|Kastner|1838|loc=94}}; {{harvnb|Riemann|1884|loc=134\u201335}}; {{harvnb|Taylor|1879\u201389|loc=3:478}}). Some go so far as to call the latter, when written with a numeral 6, a \"false\" sextuplet ({{harvnb|Baker|1895|loc=177}}; {{harvnb|Lobe|1881|loc=36}}; {{harvnb|Shedlock|1876|loc=62}}). Still others, on the contrary, define the sextuplet precisely and solely as the double triplet ({{harvnb|Stainer and Barrett|1876|loc=395}}; {{harvnb|Sembos|2006|loc=86}}), and a few more, while accepting the distinction, contend that the true sextuplet has no internal subdivisions\u2014only the first note of the group should be accented ({{harvnb|Riemann|1884|loc=134}}; {{harvnb|Taylor|1879\u201389|loc=3:478}}; {{harvnb|Taylor|2001}}).\n\n==== Compound meter ====\nIn [[compound meter (music)|compound meter]], even-numbered tuplets can indicate that a note value is changed in relation to the [[dot (music)|dotted]] version of the next higher [[note value]]. Thus, two '''duplet''' [[eighth note]]s (most often used in {{music|time|6|8}} [[Metre (music)|meter]]) take the time normally totaled by three eighth notes, equal to a dotted quarter note. Four '''quadruplet''' (or '''quartole''') eighth notes would also equal a dotted quarter note. The duplet eighth note is thus exactly the same duration as a dotted eighth note, but the duplet notation is far more common in compound meters {{harv|Jones|1974|loc=20}}.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\"> \\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 6/8\n   \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n   c8 c c c c c\n   \\tuplet 2/3 { c8 c } c8. c\n   \\tuplet 4/3 { c8 c c c } c16. c c c\n   c2.\n}\n</score>\n\nA duplet in compound time is more often written as 2:3 (a dotted quarter note split into two duplet eighth notes) than 2:{{frac|1|1|2}} (a dotted quarter note split into two duplet quarter notes), even though the former is inconsistent with a quadruplet also being written as 4:3 (a dotted quarter note split into four quadruplet eighth notes) {{harv|Anon.|1997\u20132000}}.\n\n=== Nested tuplets ===\nOn occasion, tuplets are used \"inside\" tuplets. These are referred to as ''nested tuplets''.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\"> \\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 2/4\n   \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 68\n   \\once \\override TupletBracket.bracket-visibility = ##t \\tuplet 5/4 {c8[ \\tuplet 3/2 { c16 c c] } c4 \\tuplet 7/4 { c32[ c c c c c c] } } c2\n}\n</score>\n\n== Counting ==\nTuplets can produce rhythms such as the [[hemiola]] or may be used as [[polyrhythm]]s when played against the regular duration. They are [[extrametric]] [[rhythmic unit]]s. The example below shows sextuplets in quintuplet time.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" override_midi=\"Sextuplet against five rhythm.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n<< \\relative c' {\n   \\override Staff.StaffSymbol.line-positions = #'(-2 2)\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 5/4\n   \\override TupletNumber.text = #tuplet-number::calc-fraction-text\n   \\tuplet 6/5 { e4 e e e e e } e4\n} \\\\ \\relative c' {\n   a4 a a a a a\n}\n>>\n</score>\n\nTuplets may be [[Counting (music)|counted]], most often at extremely slow tempos, using the [[lowest common multiple|least common multiple]] (LCM) between the original and tuplet divisions. For example, with a 3-against-2 tuplet (triplets) the LCM is 6. Since {{nowrap|1=6 \u00f7 2 = 3}} and {{nowrap|1=6 \u00f7 3 = 2}} the quarter notes fall every three counts (overlined) and the triplets every two (underlined):\n\n:{| style=\"width: 1.2in;\"\n|<span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\"><u>1</u></span>\n|2\n|<u>3</u>\n|<span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">4</span>\n|<u>5</u>\n|6\n|}\n\nThis is fairly easily brought up to tempo, and depending on the music may be counted in tempo, while 7-against-4, having an LCM of 28, may be counted at extremely slow tempos but must be played intuitively (\"felt out\") at tempo:\n\n:{| style=\"width: 8in;\"\n|<span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\"><u>1</u></span>\n|2\n|3\n|4\n|<u>5</u>\n|6\n|7\n|<span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">8</span>\n|<u>9</u>\n|10\n|11\n|12\n|<u>13</u>\n|14\n|<span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">15</span>\n|16\n|<u>17</u>\n|18\n|19\n|20\n|<u>21</u>\n|<span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">22</span>\n|23\n|24\n|<u>25</u>\n|26\n|27\n|28\n|}\nTo play a half-note ([[Minim (music)|minim]]) triplet accurately in a [[bar (music)|bar]] of {{music|time|4|4}}, count eighth-note triplets and tie them together in groups of four\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\">\n<< \\relative c' {\n   \\override Staff.StaffSymbol.line-positions = #'(-2 2)\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 4/4\n   \\tuplet 3/2 { e4.~ e8 e4~ e e8~ e4. } e4\n} \\\\ \\relative c' {\n   \\tuplet 3/2 { a2 a a } a4\n}\n>>\n</score>\n\nWith a stress on each target note, one would count: '''1''' \u2013 2 \u2013 3&nbsp;&nbsp;1 \u2013 '''2''' \u2013 3&nbsp;&nbsp;1 \u2013 2 \u2013 '''3'''&nbsp;&nbsp;1 \u2013 2 \u2013 3&nbsp;&nbsp;'''1'''\nThe same principle can be applied to quintuplets, septuplets, and so on.\n\n== Quadruplet figure in drumming ==\n{{anchor|Quadruplet}}In [[drums|drumming]], \"quadruplet\" refers to one group of three sixteenth-note triplets \"with an extra [non-tuplet eighth] note added on to the end\", thus filling one beat in {{music|time|4|4}} time {{harv|Peckman|2007|loc=127\u201328}}, with four notes of ''un''equal value.

This is indicated by a number (or sometimes two), indicating the fraction involved. The [[Musical note|notes]] involved are also often grouped with a bracket or (in older notation) a slur.\n\nThe most common type of tuplet is the triplet.\n==Terminology==\nThe modern term 'tuplet' comes from a [[rebracketing]] of compound words like quintu(s)-(u)plet and sextu(s)-(u)plet, and from related mathematical terms such as \"[[tuple]]\", \"-uplet\" and \"-plet\", which are used to form terms denoting [[multiplet]]s (''Oxford English Dictionary'', entries \"multiplet\", \"-plet, ''comb. form''\", \"-let, ''suffix''\", and \"-et, ''suffix''<sup>1</sup>\"). An alternative modern term, \"irrational rhythm\", was originally borrowed from Greek [[Meter (poetry)|prosody]] where it referred to \"a syllable having a metrical value not corresponding to its actual time-value, or ... a metrical foot containing such a syllable\" (''Oxford English Dictionary'', entry \"irrational\"). The term would be incorrect if used in the [[irrational number|mathematical sense]] (because the note-values are [[rational number|rational]] fractions) or in the more general sense of \"unreasonable, utterly illogical, absurd\".\n\nAlternative terms found occasionally are \"artificial division\" {{harv|Jones|1974|loc=19}}, \"abnormal divisions\" {{harv|Donato|1963|loc=34}}, \"irregular rhythm\" {{harv|Read|1964|loc=181}}, and \"irregular rhythmic groupings\" {{harv|Kennedy|1994}}. The term \"[[polyrhythm]]\" (or \"polymeter\"), sometimes incorrectly used of \"tuplets\", actually refers to the simultaneous use of opposing time signatures {{harv|Read|1964|loc=167}}.\n\nBesides \"triplet\", the terms \"duplet\", \"quadruplet\", \"quintuplet\", \"sextuplet\", \"septuplet\", and \"octuplet\" are used frequently. The terms \"nonuplet\", \"decuplet\", \"undecuplet\", \"dodecuplet\", and \"tredecuplet\" had been suggested but up until 1925 had not caught on ({{harvnb|Dunstan|1925}}, {{Page needed|date=September 2013}}). By 1964 the terms \"nonuplet\" and \"decuplet\" were usual, while subdivisions by greater numbers were more commonly described as \"group of eleven notes\", \"group of twelve notes\", and so on {{harv|Read|1964|loc=189}}.\n\n== Triplet ==\n\nThe most common tuplet {{harv|Schonbrun|2007|loc=8}} is the '''triplet''' ([[German language|Ger.]] ''Triole'', [[French language|Fr.]] ''triolet'', [[Italian language|It.]] ''terzina'' or ''tripletta'', [[Spanish language|Sp.]] ''tresillo''). Whereas normally two [[quarter note]]s (crotchets) are the same [[duration (music)|duration]] as a [[half note]] (minim), three triplet quarter notes have that same duration, so the duration of a triplet quarter note is {{2/3}} the [[duration (music)|duration]] of a standard quarter note.\n\n: <score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\"> \\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 2/4\n   \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n   c4 c\n   \\tuplet 3/2 { c4 c c }\n}\n</score>\n\nSimilarly, three triplet [[eighth notes]] (quavers) are equal in duration to one quarter note. If several note values appear under the triplet bracket, they are all affected the same way, reduced to {{2/3}} their original duration.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\"> \\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 2/4\n   \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n   c8 c c c\n   \\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c } \\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c }\n}\n</score>\n\nThe triplet indication may also apply to notes of different values, for example a quarter note followed by one eighth note, in which case the quarter note may be regarded as two triplet eighths tied together {{harv|Gehrkens|1921|loc=19}}.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\"> \\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 2/4\n   \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n   \\tuplet 3/2 { c4 c8 } \\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c4 }\n}\n</score>\n\nIn some older scores, rhythms like this would be notated as a [[Dotted note|dotted]] eighth note and a sixteenth note as a kind of shorthand {{harv|Troeger|2003|loc=172}} presumably so that the beaming more clearly shows the beats.\n\n== Tuplet notation ==\n\n=== Notation ===\nTuplets are typically notated either with a bracket or with a number above or below the [[Beam (music)|beam]] if the notes are beamed together. Sometimes, the tuplet is notated with a [[ratio]] (instead of just a number) \u2014 with the first number in the ratio indicating the number of notes in the tuplet and the second number indicating the number of normal notes they have the same duration as \u2014 or with a ratio and a note value.\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 5/4\n   \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n   \\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c }\n   \\once \\override TupletBracket.bracket-visibility = ##t \\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c }\n   \\once \\override TupletNumber.text = #tuplet-number::calc-fraction-text \\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c }\n     \\once \\override TupletNumber.text =\n    #(tuplet-number::append-note-wrapper\n      (tuplet-number::non-default-tuplet-fraction-text 3 2) \"8\") \\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c }\n} }\n</score>\n\n=== Rhythm ===\n\n==== Simple meter ====\nFor other tuplets, the number indicates a [[ratio]] to the next ''lower'' normal value in the prevailing meter (a [[Power of two|power of 2]] in [[simple meter]]). So a '''quintuplet''' ('''quintolet''' or '''pentuplet''' {{harv|Cunningham|2007|loc=111}}) indicated with the numeral 5 means that five of the indicated note value total the [[duration (music)|duration]] normally occupied by four (or, as a division of a dotted note in compound time, three), equivalent to the ''second'' higher note value. For example, five quintuplet eighth notes total the same duration as a half note (or, in {{music|time|3|8}} or compound meters such as {{music|time|6|8}}, {{music|time|9|8}}, etc. time, a dotted quarter note).\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\"> \\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 2/4\n   \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n   c8 c c c\n   \\tuplet 5/4 { c8 c c c c }\n   c2\n}\n</score>\n\nSome numbers are used inconsistently: for example '''septuplets''' ('''septolets''' or '''septimoles''') usually indicate 7 notes in the [[duration (music)|duration]] of 4\u2014or in compound meter 7 for 6\u2014but may sometimes be used to mean 7 notes in the duration of 8 {{harv|Read|1964|loc=183\u201384}}. Thus, a septuplet lasting a whole note can be written with either quarter notes (7:4) or eighth notes (7:8).\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\"> \\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 4/4\n   \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n   \\tuplet 7/4 { c4 c c c c c c }\n   \\tuplet 7/8 { c8 c c c c c c }\n}\n</score>\n\nTo avoid ambiguity, composers sometimes write the ratio explicitly instead of just a single number. This is also done for cases like 7:11, where the validity of this practice is established by the complexity of the figure. A French alternative is to write ''pour'' (\"for\") or ''de'' (\"of\") in place of the colon, or above the bracketed \"irregular\" number {{harv|Read|1964|loc=219\u201321}}. This reflects the French usage of, for example, \"six-pour-quatre\" as an alternative name for the ''sextolet'' ({{harvnb|Damour, Burnett, and Elwart|1838|loc=79}}; {{harvnb|Hubbard|1924|loc=480}}).\n\nThere are disagreements about the '''sextuplet''' (pronounced with stress on the first syllable, according to {{harvnb|Baker|1895|loc=177}})\u2014which is also called '''sestole''', '''sestolet''', '''sextole''', or '''sextolet''' ({{harvnb|Baker|1895|loc=177}}; {{harvnb|Cooper|1973|loc=32}}; {{harvnb|Latham|2002}}; {{harvnb|Shedlock|1876|loc=62, 68, 87, 93}}; {{harvnb|Stainer and Barrett|1876|loc=395}}; {{harvnb|Taylor|1879\u201389}}; {{harvnb|Taylor|2001}}). This six-part division may be regarded either as a triplet with each note divided in half (2 + 2 + 2)\u2014therefore with an accent on the first, third, and fifth notes\u2014or else as an ordinary duple pattern with each note subdivided into triplets (3 + 3) and accented on both the first and fourth notes. This is indicated by the beaming in the example below.\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\"> \\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 2/4\n   \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n   \\tuplet 6/4 { c16 \\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 c \\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 c c }\n   \\tuplet 6/4 { c16 c \\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 c c c }\n}\n</score>\n\nSome authorities treat both groupings as equally valid forms ({{harvnb|Damour, Burnett, and Elwart|1838|loc=80}}; {{harvnb|K\u00f6hler|1858|loc=2:52\u201353}}; {{harvnb|Latham|2002}}; {{harvnb|Marx|1853|loc=114}}; {{harvnb|Read|1964|loc=215}}), while others dispute this, holding the first type to be the \"true\" (or \"real\") sextuplet, and the second type to be properly a \"double triplet\", which should always be written and named as such ({{harvnb|Kastner|1838|loc=94}}; {{harvnb|Riemann|1884|loc=134\u201335}}; {{harvnb|Taylor|1879\u201389|loc=3:478}}). Some go so far as to call the latter, when written with a numeral 6, a \"false\" sextuplet ({{harvnb|Baker|1895|loc=177}}; {{harvnb|Lobe|1881|loc=36}}; {{harvnb|Shedlock|1876|loc=62}}). Still others, on the contrary, define the sextuplet precisely and solely as the double triplet ({{harvnb|Stainer and Barrett|1876|loc=395}}; {{harvnb|Sembos|2006|loc=86}}), and a few more, while accepting the distinction, contend that the true sextuplet has no internal subdivisions\u2014only the first note of the group should be accented ({{harvnb|Riemann|1884|loc=134}}; {{harvnb|Taylor|1879\u201389|loc=3:478}}; {{harvnb|Taylor|2001}}).\n\n==== Compound meter ====\nIn [[compound meter (music)|compound meter]], even-numbered tuplets can indicate that a note value is changed in relation to the [[dot (music)|dotted]] version of the next higher [[note value]]. Thus, two '''duplet''' [[eighth note]]s (most often used in {{music|time|6|8}} [[Metre (music)|meter]]) take the time normally totaled by three eighth notes, equal to a dotted quarter note. Four '''quadruplet''' (or '''quartole''') eighth notes would also equal a dotted quarter note. The duplet eighth note is thus exactly the same duration as a dotted eighth note, but the duplet notation is far more common in compound meters {{harv|Jones|1974|loc=20}}.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\"> \\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 6/8\n   \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n   c8 c c c c c\n   \\tuplet 2/3 { c8 c } c8. c\n   \\tuplet 4/3 { c8 c c c } c16. c c c\n   c2.\n}\n</score>\n\nA duplet in compound time is more often written as 2:3 (a dotted quarter note split into two duplet eighth notes) than 2:{{frac|1|1|2}} (a dotted quarter note split into two duplet quarter notes), even though the former is inconsistent with a quadruplet also being written as 4:3 (a dotted quarter note split into four quadruplet eighth notes) {{harv|Anon.|1997\u20132000}}.\n\n=== Nested tuplets ===\nOn occasion, tuplets are used \"inside\" tuplets. These are referred to as ''nested tuplets''.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\"> \\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 2/4\n   \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 68\n   \\once \\override TupletBracket.bracket-visibility = ##t \\tuplet 5/4 {c8[ \\tuplet 3/2 { c16 c c] } c4 \\tuplet 7/4 { c32[ c c c c c c] } } c2\n}\n</score>\n\n== Counting ==\nTuplets can produce rhythms such as the [[hemiola]] or may be used as [[polyrhythm]]s when played against the regular duration. They are [[extrametric]] [[rhythmic unit]]s. The example below shows sextuplets in quintuplet time.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" override_midi=\"Sextuplet against five rhythm.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n<< \\relative c' {\n   \\override Staff.StaffSymbol.line-positions = #'(-2 2)\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 5/4\n   \\override TupletNumber.text = #tuplet-number::calc-fraction-text\n   \\tuplet 6/5 { e4 e e e e e } e4\n} \\\\ \\relative c' {\n   a4 a a a a a\n}\n>>\n</score>\n\nTuplets may be [[Counting (music)|counted]], most often at extremely slow tempos, using the [[lowest common multiple|least common multiple]] (LCM) between the original and tuplet divisions. For example, with a 3-against-2 tuplet (triplets) the LCM is 6.
