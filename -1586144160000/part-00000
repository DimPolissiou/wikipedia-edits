Set in [[Chicago]] in the [[Jazz Age|jazz age]], the musical is based on a [[Chicago (play)|1926 play of the same name]] by reporter [[Maurine Dallas Watkins]], about actual criminals and the crimes on which she reported. The story is a [[satire]] on [[Political corruption|corruption]] in the administration of [[criminal justice]] and the concept of the \"celebrity criminal\".\n\nThe original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opened in 1975 at the [[46th Street Theatre]]<ref name=\"ChitaRivera.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chitarivera.com/productions/chicago.htm|title=Chicago|accessdate=January 6, 2009}}</ref> and ran for 936 performances, until 1977. Bob Fosse choreographed the original production, and his style is strongly identified with the show. It debuted in the [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1979, where it ran for 600 performances. ''Chicago'' was revived on Broadway in 1996, and a year later in the West End.\n\nThe 1996 Broadway production holds the record as the longest-running musical revival and the longest-running American musical in Broadway history. It is the second [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|longest-running show to ever run on Broadway]], behind only ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''. ''Chicago'' surpassed ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' on November 23, 2014, when it played its 7,486th performance.<ref>Gans, Andrew. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/all-that-jazz-chicago-becomes-second-longest-running-broadway-show-tonight-335960 \"\"All That Jazz\": ''Chicago'' Becomes Second Longest-Running Broadway Show Tonight\"] Playbill.com, November 23, 2014</ref> The West End revival became the longest-running American musical in West End history. ''Chicago'' has been staged in numerous productions around the world, and has toured extensively in the United States and United Kingdom. The [[Chicago (2002 film)|2002 film version]] of the musical won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].\n\n==History==\nThe musical ''Chicago'' is based on [[Chicago (play)|a play]] of the same name by reporter and playwright [[Maurine Dallas Watkins]], who was assigned to cover the 1924 trials of accused murderers [[Beulah Annan]] and [[Belva Gaertner]] for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.  In the early 1920s, Chicago's press and public became riveted by the subject of homicides committed by women. Several high-profile cases arose, which generally involved women killing their lovers or husbands. These cases were tried against a backdrop of changing views of women in the [[jazz age]], and a long string of acquittals by [[Cook County]] juries of female murderers (juries at the time were all male, and convicted murderers generally faced death by hanging). A lore arose that, in Chicago, feminine or attractive women could not be convicted. The ''Chicago Tribune'' generally favored the prosecution's case, while still presenting the details of these women's lives. Its rivals at the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst papers]] were more pro-defendant, and employed what were derisively called \"sob-sisters\" \u2013 women reporters who focused on the plight, attractiveness, redemption, or grace of the female defendants. Regardless of stance, the press covered several of these women as celebrities.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Girls of Murder City: fame, lust, and the beautiful killers that inspired ''Chicago'' | publisher=Penguin Group /Viking Press |author=Perry, Douglas | year=2010 | location=New York | pages=1\u20137, 16\u201318, 57\u201358 | isbn=978-0-670-02197-0}}</ref>\n\nAnnan, the model for the character of [[Roxie Hart]], was 23 when she was accused of the April 3, 1924,<ref name=Grubb>{{cite book |title=Razzle Dazzle: The Life and Work of Bob Fosse |last=Grubb |first=Kevin Boyd |year=1989 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-312-03414-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/razzledazzlelife0000grub/page/193 193\u2013203] |url=https://archive.org/details/razzledazzlelife0000grub/page/193 }}</ref> murder of Harry Kalstedt, who served as the basis for the Fred Casely character.  The ''Tribune'' reported that Annan played the [[foxtrot]] record ''Hula Lou'' over and over for two hours before calling her husband to say she killed a man who \"tried to make love to her\".   Her husband Albert Annan inspired the character, Amos Hart. Albert was an auto mechanic who bankrupted himself to defend his wife, only for her to publicly dump him the day after she was acquitted. [[Velma Kelly]] is based on Gaertner, who was a cabaret singer, and society divorc\u00e9e. The body of Walter Law was discovered slumped over the steering wheel of Gaertner's abandoned car on March 12, 1924. Two police officers testified that they had seen a woman getting into the car and shortly thereafter heard gunshots. A bottle of gin and an automatic pistol were found on the floor of the car. Lawyers William Scott Stewart and W. W. O'Brien were models for a composite character in ''Chicago'', [[Billy Flynn (Chicago)|Billy Flynn]]. Just days apart, separate juries acquitted both women.<ref>McConnell, Virginia A.

The show received both good box-office sales and newspaper notices and was mounted on Broadway in 1926, running 172 performances. [[Cecil B. DeMille]] produced a [[silent film]] version, ''[[Chicago (1927 film)|Chicago]]'' (1927), starring former [[Mack Sennett]] bathing beauty [[Phyllis Haver]] as Roxie Hart. It was later remade as ''[[Roxie Hart (film)|Roxie Hart]]'' (1942) starring [[Ginger Rogers]], but in this version, Roxie was accused of murder without having really committed it.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Gwen Verdon]] read the play and asked her husband, Bob Fosse, about the possibility of creating a musical adaptation. Fosse (himself a native of  Chicago) approached playwright Watkins numerous times to buy the rights, but she repeatedly declined; by this point she may have regretted that Annan and Gaertner had been allowed to walk free, and that her treatment of them should not be glamorized.<ref name=Grubb /> Nonetheless, upon her death in 1969, her [[Estate (law)|estate]] sold the rights to producer Richard Fryer, Verdon, and Fosse.<ref name=Grubb /> [[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]] began work on the musical score, modeling each number on a traditional [[vaudeville]] number or a vaudeville performer. This format made explicit the show's comparison between \"justice\", \"show-business\", and contemporary society. Ebb and Fosse penned the book of the musical, and Fosse also directed and [[choreography|choreographed]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n=== Act I ===\n[[Velma Kelly]] is a [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]] who welcomes the audience to tonight's show (\"[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]\"). Interplayed with the opening number, the scene cuts to February 14, 1928 in the bedroom of chorus girl [[Roxie Hart]], where she murders Fred Casely as he attempts to break off an affair with her.\n\nRoxie convinces her husband Amos that the victim was a burglar, and Amos agrees to take the blame. Roxie expresses her appreciation of her husband's willingness to do anything for her (\"Funny Honey\"). However, when the police mention the deceased's name, Amos belatedly realizes that Roxie has lied to him. Roxie, feeling betrayed, confesses and is arrested. She is sent to the women's block in the [[Courthouse Place|Cook County Jail]], where several women accused of killing their lovers are held (\"[[Cell Block Tango]]\"); among the inmates is Velma Kelly, revealing herself to have been involved in the death of her husband and sister, though she denies committing the act. The block is presided over by Matron \"Mama\" Morton, whose system of taking [[bribery|bribes]] (\"When You're Good to Mama\") perfectly suits her clientele. She has helped Velma become the media's top murderer-of-the-week and is acting as a booking agent for Velma's big return to vaudeville.\n\nVelma is not happy to see Roxie, who is stealing not only her limelight but also her lawyer, [[Billy Flynn (Chicago)|Billy Flynn]]. Roxie convinces Amos to pay for Billy Flynn to be her lawyer (\"A Tap Dance\"), though Amos lacks the funds. Eagerly awaited by his all-woman clientele, Billy sings his anthem, complete with a chorus of fan dancers (\"All I Care About\"). Billy takes Roxie's case before realizing Amos doesn't have the money; to make up the difference, he turns the case into a [[media circus]] and rearranges her story for consumption by sympathetic tabloid columnist Mary Sunshine (\"A Little Bit of Good\"), hoping to sell proceeds in an auction. Roxie's press conference turns into a ventriloquist act, with Billy dictating a new version of the truth (\"We Both Reached for the Gun\") to the reporters while Roxie mouths the words.\n\nRoxie becomes the most popular celebrity in Chicago, as she boastfully proclaims while planning for her future career in vaudeville (\"Roxie\"). As Roxie's fame grows, Velma's notoriety subsides, and in an act of desperation she tries to talk Roxie into recreating the sister act (\"I Can't Do It Alone\"). Roxie turns her down, only to find her own headlines replaced by the latest sordid crime of passion (\"Chicago After Midnight\"). Separately, Roxie and Velma realize there is no one they can count on but themselves (\"My Own Best Friend\"), and Roxie decides that being pregnant in prison would put her back on the front page.\n\n===Act II===\nVelma returns to introduce the opening act, resentful of Roxie's manipulation of the system (\"I Know a Girl\") and ability to seduce a doctor into saying Roxie is pregnant; as Roxie emerges, she sings gleefully of the future of her unborn (nonexistent) child (\"Me and My Baby\"). Amos proudly claims paternity, but still, nobody notices him, and Billy exposes holes in Roxie's story by noting that she and Amos had not had sex in four months, meaning if she were pregnant, the child was not Amos's, in hopes that Amos will divorce her and look like a villain, which Amos almost does (\"Mr. Cellophane\"). Velma tries to show Billy all the tricks she has planned for her trial (\"When Velma Takes The Stand\"), which Roxie treats skeptically. Roxie, upset with being treated like a \"common criminal\" and considering herself a celebrity, has a heated argument with Billy and fires him; Billy warns her that her kind of [[15 minutes of fame|celebrity is fleeting]] and that she would be just as famous hanging from a noose. At that moment, Roxie witnesses one of her fellow inmates, a Hungarian woman who insisted her innocence but could not speak English and whose public lawyer refused to defend her, as she is hanged (\"Hungarian Rope Trick\").\n\nThe trial date arrives, and the now freshly terrified Roxie runs back to Billy, who calms Roxie by suggesting she will be fine so long as she makes a show of the trial (\"Razzle Dazzle\"). Billy uses Amos as a pawn, turning around and insisting that Amos is actually the father of Roxie's child. Roxie steals all of Velma's schtick, down to the rhinestone garter, to the dismay of Mama and Velma (\"Class\"). As promised, Billy gets Roxie acquitted, but just as the verdict is announced, some even more sensational crime pulls the press away, and Roxie's fleeting celebrity life is over. Billy leaves, done with the case, admitting that he only did it for the money. Amos tries to get Roxie to come home and forget the ordeal, but she is more concerned with the end of her brief run of fame and admits she isn't pregnant, leaving Amos in the dust.\n\nThe final scene cuts to a Chicago vaudeville theater, where Roxie and Velma (acquitted off-stage) are performing a new act in which they bittersweetly sing about modern life (\"Nowadays\"). The former Mary Sunshine, revealed during the trial to actually be a man in drag, takes his natural male form as a pushy vaudeville promoter, shaping Roxie and Velma's dance (\"Hot Honey Rag\") to make it as sexy as possible. The show ends with a brief finale (\"Finale\").<ref>Plot Summary based on that of Bill Rosenfield, copyright 1997 BMG Music</ref>\n\n==Musical numbers==\n\n;1975 Original Broadway Production\n'''''\"Chicago: A Musical Vaudeville\"'''''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 1\n* \"Overture\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]\" \u2013 Velma Kelly and Company\n* \"Funny Honey\" \u2013 Roxie Hart, Amos Hart, Sergeant Fogarty \n* \"[[Cell Block Tango]]\" \u2013 Velma and the Girls\n* \"When You're Good to Mama\" \u2013 Matron \"Mama\" Morton\n* \"Tap Dance\" - Roxie, Amos, and Boys\n* \"All I Care About\" \u2013 Billy Flynn and the Girls\n* \"A Little Bit of Good\" \u2013 Mary Sunshine\n* \"We Both Reached for the Gun\" \u2013 Billy, Roxie, Mary Sunshine\n* \"Roxie\" \u2013 Roxie and Boys\n* \"I Can't Do It Alone\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Chicago After Midnight\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"My Own Best Friend\" \u2013 Roxie and Velma\n\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 2\n* \"I Know a Girl\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Me and My Baby\" \u2013 Roxie and Company\n* \"Mr. Cellophane\" \u2013 Amos Hart\n* \"When Velma Takes the Stand\" \u2013 Velma and Boys\n* \"Razzle Dazzle\" \u2013 Billy and Company\n* \"Class\" \u2013 Velma and Morton\n* \"Nowadays\" \u2013 Roxie\n* Finale: \"Nowadays\"/\"R.S.V.P\"/\"Keep It Hot\" \u2013 Roxie and Velma \u2020\n{{col-end}}\n\n;1996 Revival Production\n'''''\"Chicago: The Musical\"'''''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 1\n* \"Overture\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]\" \u2013 Velma Kelly and Company\n* \"Funny Honey\" \u2013 Roxie Hart\n* \"[[Cell Block Tango]]\" \u2013 Velma and the Murderesses\n* \"When You're Good to Mama\" \u2013 Matron \"Mama\" Morton\n* \"Tap Dance\" - Roxie, Amos, and Boys\n* \"All I Care About\" \u2013 Billy Flynn and the Girls\n* \"A Little Bit of Good\" \u2013 Mary Sunshine\n* \"We Both Reached for the Gun\" \u2013 Billy, Roxie, Mary and the Reporters\n* \"Roxie\" \u2013 Roxie and the Boys\n* \"I Can't Do It Alone\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"I Can't Do It Alone (Reprise)\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Chicago After Midnight\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"My Own Best Friend\" \u2013 Roxie and Velma\n* \"Finale Act I: All That Jazz (Reprise)\" \u2013 Velma\n\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 2\n* \"Entr'acte\"  \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"I Know a Girl\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Me and My Baby\" \u2013 Roxie and Company\n* \"Mr. Cellophane\" \u2013 Amos Hart\n* \"When Velma Takes the Stand\" \u2013 Velma and the Boys\n* \"Razzle Dazzle\" \u2013 Billy and Company\n* \"Class\" \u2013 Velma and Mama Morton\n* \"Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag\" \u2013 Velma and Roxie\n* \"Finale Act II: All That Jazz (Reprise)\" \u2013 Company\n{{col-end}}\n\n<small>\u2020 In the 1975 Original Broadway Production and its Playbill, there are a few contradicting song lists.

Her hanging sets up the climax of the musical.\n\n====One-scene characters====\n*Sergeant Fogarty: Police officer who arrests Roxie and investigates Fred's murder.\n*Liz, Annie, Mona and June: Four other inmates who appear only in \"[[Cell Block Tango]].\"\n*Aaron: Katalin's indifferent [[public defender]], who prefers to cut [[plea deal]]s instead of actually defending his clients.\n*Martin Harrison: assistant district attorney who prosecutes Roxie. Harrison only appears during the trial but is mentioned earlier.\n\nThe ensemble also calls for a judge, jury foreman, gynecologist, court clerk, newspaper reporters, male sycophants for Roxie and Velma, and other miscellaneous roles, which are usually held as [[dual role]]s by other members of the ensemble.\n\n==Musical and staging style==\nAccording to Fred Ebb, he wrote the book in a vaudeville style because \"the characters were performers. Every musical moment in the show was loosely modeled on someone else: Roxie was [[Helen Morgan]], Velma was [[Texas Guinan]], Billy Flynn was [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]], Mama Morton was [[Sophie Tucker]].\" Kander elaborates that the reason the show was called a vaudeville \"is because many of the songs we wrote are related to specific performers like those you mentioned, and Eddie Cantor and Bert Williams as well.\"<ref name=light>{{cite book|last1=Kander|first1=John|last2=Ebb|first2=Fred|last3=Lawrence|first3=Greg|title=Colored Lights: Forty Years of Words and Music, Show Biz, Collaboration, and All That Jazz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qJKRpOcNxE8C|date=October 2004|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-571-21169-2|pages=128\u2013129}}</ref>\n\nIt was through the initial production, and not the writing, that many of the \"traditional\" ''Chicago'' staging conventions were developed:\n\nThe double snap in \"Razzle Dazzle\" was added as an afterthought at the suggestion of Fred Ebb to John Kander. Kander explains: \"I remember when we wrote \"Razzle Dazzle\", before we took it in and played it for Bob, you [Ebb] said with absolute confidence 'Try adding a couple of finger snaps to it. Bobby will love that.' We added them...and as soon as he heard the finger snaps, he loved the song.\"<ref name=light/> During rehearsals, \"Razzle Dazzle\" was originally staged as an orgy on the steps of the courthouse. Fosse was talked out of allowing this staging, when Jerry Orbach \"convinced him that he was missing the Brechtian subtlety intrinsic in the number.\"<ref name=leve>Leve, James.

The piece was cut and replaced with \"Nowadays\". Instrumental sections of \"Loopin' the Loop\" can still be heard in the Overture.<ref name=leve/> Two other sections termed \"Keep It Hot\" and \"RSVP\" were cut from the finale as well.\n\nAnother principal character, a theatrical agent named Harry Glassman, was played by [[David Rounds]], whose role was to exploit the notoriety of the prisoners for his own gain. He also served as the evening's [[Master of Ceremonies|M.C]]. This character's role and the song \"Ten Percent\" was cut,<ref>Bloom, Ken; Vlastnik, Frank; and Orbach, Jerry.

One of the original lyrics \"Every guy is a snot/Every girl is a twat\" was restored for the 2002 movie, although the entire number was cut from the final release of the movie.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Productions==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n[[File:Michael O'Haughey and Jerry Orbach in Chicago musical.JPG|thumb|right| M.

Bob Fosse choreographed the original production, and his style is strongly identified with the show. It debuted in the [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1979, where it ran for 600 performances. ''Chicago'' was revived on Broadway in 1996, and a year later in the West End.\n\nThe 1996 Broadway production holds the record as the longest-running musical revival and the longest-running American musical in Broadway history. It is the second [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|longest-running show to ever run on Broadway]], behind only ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''. ''Chicago'' surpassed ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' on November 23, 2014, when it played its 7,486th performance.<ref>Gans, Andrew. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/all-that-jazz-chicago-becomes-second-longest-running-broadway-show-tonight-335960 \"\"All That Jazz\": ''Chicago'' Becomes Second Longest-Running Broadway Show Tonight\"] Playbill.com, November 23, 2014</ref> The West End revival became the longest-running American musical in West End history. ''Chicago'' has been staged in numerous productions around the world, and has toured extensively in the United States and United Kingdom. The [[Chicago (2002 film)|2002 film version]] of the musical won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].\n\n==History==\nThe musical ''Chicago'' is based on [[Chicago (play)|a play]] of the same name by reporter and playwright [[Maurine Dallas Watkins]], who was assigned to cover the 1924 trials of accused murderers [[Beulah Annan]] and [[Belva Gaertner]] for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.  In the early 1920s, Chicago's press and public became riveted by the subject of homicides committed by women. Several high-profile cases arose, which generally involved women killing their lovers or husbands. These cases were tried against a backdrop of changing views of women in the [[jazz age]], and a long string of acquittals by [[Cook County]] juries of female murderers (juries at the time were all male, and convicted murderers generally faced death by hanging). A lore arose that, in Chicago, feminine or attractive women could not be convicted. The ''Chicago Tribune'' generally favored the prosecution's case, while still presenting the details of these women's lives. Its rivals at the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst papers]] were more pro-defendant, and employed what were derisively called \"sob-sisters\" \u2013 women reporters who focused on the plight, attractiveness, redemption, or grace of the female defendants.

The ''Tribune'' reported that Annan played the [[foxtrot]] record ''Hula Lou'' over and over for two hours before calling her husband to say she killed a man who \"tried to make love to her\".   Her husband Albert Annan inspired the character, Amos Hart. Albert was an auto mechanic who bankrupted himself to defend his wife, only for her to publicly dump him the day after she was acquitted. [[Velma Kelly]] is based on Gaertner, who was a cabaret singer, and society divorc\u00e9e. The body of Walter Law was discovered slumped over the steering wheel of Gaertner's abandoned car on March 12, 1924. Two police officers testified that they had seen a woman getting into the car and shortly thereafter heard gunshots. A bottle of gin and an automatic pistol were found on the floor of the car. Lawyers William Scott Stewart and W. W. O'Brien were models for a composite character in ''Chicago'', [[Billy Flynn (Chicago)|Billy Flynn]]. Just days apart, separate juries acquitted both women.<ref>McConnell, Virginia A.

The show received both good box-office sales and newspaper notices and was mounted on Broadway in 1926, running 172 performances. [[Cecil B. DeMille]] produced a [[silent film]] version, ''[[Chicago (1927 film)|Chicago]]'' (1927), starring former [[Mack Sennett]] bathing beauty [[Phyllis Haver]] as Roxie Hart. It was later remade as ''[[Roxie Hart (film)|Roxie Hart]]'' (1942) starring [[Ginger Rogers]], but in this version, Roxie was accused of murder without having really committed it.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Gwen Verdon]] read the play and asked her husband, Bob Fosse, about the possibility of creating a musical adaptation. Fosse (himself a native of  Chicago) approached playwright Watkins numerous times to buy the rights, but she repeatedly declined; by this point she may have regretted that Annan and Gaertner had been allowed to walk free, and that her treatment of them should not be glamorized.<ref name=Grubb /> Nonetheless, upon her death in 1969, her [[Estate (law)|estate]] sold the rights to producer Richard Fryer, Verdon, and Fosse.<ref name=Grubb /> [[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]] began work on the musical score, modeling each number on a traditional [[vaudeville]] number or a vaudeville performer. This format made explicit the show's comparison between \"justice\", \"show-business\", and contemporary society. Ebb and Fosse penned the book of the musical, and Fosse also directed and [[choreography|choreographed]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n=== Act I ===\n[[Velma Kelly]] is a [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]] who welcomes the audience to tonight's show (\"[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]\"). Interplayed with the opening number, the scene cuts to February 14, 1928 in the bedroom of chorus girl [[Roxie Hart]], where she murders Fred Casely as he attempts to break off an affair with her.\n\nRoxie convinces her husband Amos that the victim was a burglar, and Amos agrees to take the blame. Roxie expresses her appreciation of her husband's willingness to do anything for her (\"Funny Honey\"). However, when the police mention the deceased's name, Amos belatedly realizes that Roxie has lied to him. Roxie, feeling betrayed, confesses and is arrested. She is sent to the women's block in the [[Courthouse Place|Cook County Jail]], where several women accused of killing their lovers are held (\"[[Cell Block Tango]]\"); among the inmates is Velma Kelly, revealing herself to have been involved in the death of her husband and sister, though she denies committing the act. The block is presided over by Matron \"Mama\" Morton, whose system of taking [[bribery|bribes]] (\"When You're Good to Mama\") perfectly suits her clientele. She has helped Velma become the media's top murderer-of-the-week and is acting as a booking agent for Velma's big return to vaudeville.\n\nVelma is not happy to see Roxie, who is stealing not only her limelight but also her lawyer, [[Billy Flynn (Chicago)|Billy Flynn]]. Roxie convinces Amos to pay for Billy Flynn to be her lawyer (\"A Tap Dance\"), though Amos lacks the funds. Eagerly awaited by his all-woman clientele, Billy sings his anthem, complete with a chorus of fan dancers (\"All I Care About\"). Billy takes Roxie's case before realizing Amos doesn't have the money; to make up the difference, he turns the case into a [[media circus]] and rearranges her story for consumption by sympathetic tabloid columnist Mary Sunshine (\"A Little Bit of Good\"), hoping to sell proceeds in an auction. Roxie's press conference turns into a ventriloquist act, with Billy dictating a new version of the truth (\"We Both Reached for the Gun\") to the reporters while Roxie mouths the words.\n\nRoxie becomes the most popular celebrity in Chicago, as she boastfully proclaims while planning for her future career in vaudeville (\"Roxie\"). As Roxie's fame grows, Velma's notoriety subsides, and in an act of desperation she tries to talk Roxie into recreating the sister act (\"I Can't Do It Alone\"). Roxie turns her down, only to find her own headlines replaced by the latest sordid crime of passion (\"Chicago After Midnight\"). Separately, Roxie and Velma realize there is no one they can count on but themselves (\"My Own Best Friend\"), and Roxie decides that being pregnant in prison would put her back on the front page.\n\n===Act II===\nVelma returns to introduce the opening act, resentful of Roxie's manipulation of the system (\"I Know a Girl\") and ability to seduce a doctor into saying Roxie is pregnant; as Roxie emerges, she sings gleefully of the future of her unborn (nonexistent) child (\"Me and My Baby\"). Amos proudly claims paternity, but still, nobody notices him, and Billy exposes holes in Roxie's story by noting that she and Amos had not had sex in four months, meaning if she were pregnant, the child was not Amos's, in hopes that Amos will divorce her and look like a villain, which Amos almost does (\"Mr. Cellophane\"). Velma tries to show Billy all the tricks she has planned for her trial (\"When Velma Takes The Stand\"), which Roxie treats skeptically. Roxie, upset with being treated like a \"common criminal\" and considering herself a celebrity, has a heated argument with Billy and fires him; Billy warns her that her kind of [[15 minutes of fame|celebrity is fleeting]] and that she would be just as famous hanging from a noose. At that moment, Roxie witnesses one of her fellow inmates, a Hungarian woman who insisted her innocence but could not speak English and whose public lawyer refused to defend her, as she is hanged (\"Hungarian Rope Trick\").\n\nThe trial date arrives, and the now freshly terrified Roxie runs back to Billy, who calms Roxie by suggesting she will be fine so long as she makes a show of the trial (\"Razzle Dazzle\"). Billy uses Amos as a pawn, turning around and insisting that Amos is actually the father of Roxie's child. Roxie steals all of Velma's schtick, down to the rhinestone garter, to the dismay of Mama and Velma (\"Class\"). As promised, Billy gets Roxie acquitted, but just as the verdict is announced, some even more sensational crime pulls the press away, and Roxie's fleeting celebrity life is over. Billy leaves, done with the case, admitting that he only did it for the money. Amos tries to get Roxie to come home and forget the ordeal, but she is more concerned with the end of her brief run of fame and admits she isn't pregnant, leaving Amos in the dust.\n\nThe final scene cuts to a Chicago vaudeville theater, where Roxie and Velma (acquitted off-stage) are performing a new act in which they bittersweetly sing about modern life (\"Nowadays\"). The former Mary Sunshine, revealed during the trial to actually be a man in drag, takes his natural male form as a pushy vaudeville promoter, shaping Roxie and Velma's dance (\"Hot Honey Rag\") to make it as sexy as possible. The show ends with a brief finale (\"Finale\").<ref>Plot Summary based on that of Bill Rosenfield, copyright 1997 BMG Music</ref>\n\n==Musical numbers==\n\n;1975 Original Broadway Production\n'''''\"Chicago: A Musical Vaudeville\"'''''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 1\n* \"Overture\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]\" \u2013 Velma Kelly and Company\n* \"Funny Honey\" \u2013 Roxie Hart, Amos Hart, Sergeant Fogarty \n* \"[[Cell Block Tango]]\" \u2013 Velma and the Girls\n* \"When You're Good to Mama\" \u2013 Matron \"Mama\" Morton\n* \"Tap Dance\" - Roxie, Amos, and Boys\n* \"All I Care About\" \u2013 Billy Flynn and the Girls\n* \"A Little Bit of Good\" \u2013 Mary Sunshine\n* \"We Both Reached for the Gun\" \u2013 Billy, Roxie, Mary Sunshine\n* \"Roxie\" \u2013 Roxie and Boys\n* \"I Can't Do It Alone\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Chicago After Midnight\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"My Own Best Friend\" \u2013 Roxie and Velma\n\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 2\n* \"I Know a Girl\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Me and My Baby\" \u2013 Roxie and Company\n* \"Mr. Cellophane\" \u2013 Amos Hart\n* \"When Velma Takes the Stand\" \u2013 Velma and Boys\n* \"Razzle Dazzle\" \u2013 Billy and Company\n* \"Class\" \u2013 Velma and Morton\n* \"Nowadays\" \u2013 Roxie\n* Finale: \"Nowadays\"/\"R.S.V.P\"/\"Keep It Hot\" \u2013 Roxie and Velma \u2020\n{{col-end}}\n\n;1996 Revival Production\n'''''\"Chicago: The Musical\"'''''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 1\n* \"Overture\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]\" \u2013 Velma Kelly and Company\n* \"Funny Honey\" \u2013 Roxie Hart\n* \"[[Cell Block Tango]]\" \u2013 Velma and the Murderesses\n* \"When You're Good to Mama\" \u2013 Matron \"Mama\" Morton\n* \"Tap Dance\" - Roxie, Amos, and Boys\n* \"All I Care About\" \u2013 Billy Flynn and the Girls\n* \"A Little Bit of Good\" \u2013 Mary Sunshine\n* \"We Both Reached for the Gun\" \u2013 Billy, Roxie, Mary and the Reporters\n* \"Roxie\" \u2013 Roxie and the Boys\n* \"I Can't Do It Alone\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"I Can't Do It Alone (Reprise)\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Chicago After Midnight\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"My Own Best Friend\" \u2013 Roxie and Velma\n* \"Finale Act I: All That Jazz (Reprise)\" \u2013 Velma\n\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 2\n* \"Entr'acte\"  \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"I Know a Girl\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Me and My Baby\" \u2013 Roxie and Company\n* \"Mr. Cellophane\" \u2013 Amos Hart\n* \"When Velma Takes the Stand\" \u2013 Velma and the Boys\n* \"Razzle Dazzle\" \u2013 Billy and Company\n* \"Class\" \u2013 Velma and Mama Morton\n* \"Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag\" \u2013 Velma and Roxie\n* \"Finale Act II: All That Jazz (Reprise)\" \u2013 Company\n{{col-end}}\n\n<small>\u2020 In the 1975 Original Broadway Production and its Playbill, there are a few contradicting song lists.

Every musical moment in the show was loosely modeled on someone else: Roxie was [[Helen Morgan]], Velma was [[Texas Guinan]], Billy Flynn was [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]], Mama Morton was [[Sophie Tucker]].\" Kander elaborates that the reason the show was called a vaudeville \"is because many of the songs we wrote are related to specific performers like those you mentioned, and Eddie Cantor and Bert Williams as well.\"<ref name=light>{{cite book|last1=Kander|first1=John|last2=Ebb|first2=Fred|last3=Lawrence|first3=Greg|title=Colored Lights: Forty Years of Words and Music, Show Biz, Collaboration, and All That Jazz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qJKRpOcNxE8C|date=October 2004|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-571-21169-2|pages=128\u2013129}}</ref>\n\nIt was through the initial production, and not the writing, that many of the \"traditional\" ''Chicago'' staging conventions were developed:\n\nThe double snap in \"Razzle Dazzle\" was added as an afterthought at the suggestion of Fred Ebb to John Kander. Kander explains: \"I remember when we wrote \"Razzle Dazzle\", before we took it in and played it for Bob, you [Ebb] said with absolute confidence 'Try adding a couple of finger snaps to it. Bobby will love that.' We added them...and as soon as he heard the finger snaps, he loved the song.\"<ref name=light/> During rehearsals, \"Razzle Dazzle\" was originally staged as an orgy on the steps of the courthouse. Fosse was talked out of allowing this staging, when Jerry Orbach \"convinced him that he was missing the Brechtian subtlety intrinsic in the number.\"<ref name=leve>Leve, James.

The piece was cut and replaced with \"Nowadays\". Instrumental sections of \"Loopin' the Loop\" can still be heard in the Overture.<ref name=leve/> Two other sections termed \"Keep It Hot\" and \"RSVP\" were cut from the finale as well.\n\nAnother principal character, a theatrical agent named Harry Glassman, was played by [[David Rounds]], whose role was to exploit the notoriety of the prisoners for his own gain. He also served as the evening's [[Master of Ceremonies|M.C]]. This character's role and the song \"Ten Percent\" was cut,<ref>Bloom, Ken; Vlastnik, Frank; and Orbach, Jerry.

To stop such people from coming to see him, Mian Mir posted his ''mureeds'' (disciples) at the gate of his house.<ref name=\"Dawn\">[https://www.dawn.com/news/1235304 A Sufi, a Sikh and their message of love &ndash; A journey from Lahore to Amritsar], Dawn newspaper, Updated 20 May 2017, Retrieved 20 June 2017</ref>\n\nOnce, [[Jahangir]], the Mughal emperor, with all his retinue came to pay homage to the great faqir. He came with all the pomp and show that befitted an emperor. Mian Mir's sentinels however, stopped the emperor at the gate and requested him to wait until their master had given permission to enter. Jahangir felt slighted. No one had ever dared delay or question his entry to any place in his kingdom. Yet he controlled his temper and composed himself. He waited for permission. After a while, he was ushered into Mian Mir's presence. Unable to hide his wounded vanity, Jahangir, as soon as he entered, told Mian Mir in [[Persian language|Persian]]: ''Ba dar-e-darvis darbane naa-bayd'' (\"On the doorstep of a faqir, there should be no sentry\"). The reply from Mian Mir was, \"Babayd keh sage dunia na ayad\" (So that selfish men may not enter).<ref name=economictimes>{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/the-speaking-tree/who-was-the-emperor-jahangir-or-mian-mir/ |website=The Economic Times|author=KJS Ahluwalia|date=31 May 2016|title=Who was the emperor? Jahangir or Mian Mir? |accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe emperor was embarrassed and asked for forgiveness. Then, with folded hands, Jahangir requested Mian Mir to pray for the success of the campaign which he intended to launch for the conquest of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. Meanwhile, a poor man entered and, bowing his head to Mian Mir, made an offering of a [[rupee]] before him. The Sufi asked the devotee to pick up the rupee and give it to the poorest, neediest person in the audience. The devotee went from one [[dervish]] to another but none accepted the rupee. The devotee returned to Mian Mir with the rupee saying: \"Master, none of the dervishes will accept the rupee. None is in need, it seems.\"<ref name=economictimes/>\n\n\"Go and give this rupee to him,\" said the faqir, pointing to Jahangir. \"He is the poorest and most needy of the lot. Not content with a big kingdom, he covets the kingdom of the Deccan. For that, he has come all the way from [[Delhi]] to beg. His hunger is like a fire that burns all the more furiously with more wood. It has made him needy, greedy and grim. Go and give the rupee to him.\"<ref name=economictimes/>\n\n== Mian Mir and Sikhism ==\n\nAccording to Sikh tradition, the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] guru [[Guru Arjan Dev]] met Mian Mir during their stay in [[Lahore]]. This tradition does not appear in the early Sikh literature, and is first mentioned in the 18th and 19th century chronicles. However, it may be possible that this tradition is historically true, and may have been suppressed during the earlier period because of Sikhs' conflicts with the Muslim [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] and [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]].<ref name=\"Pashaura_2006\"/>\n\n=== Legend about foundation of Harmandir Sahib ===\n\nAccording to ''Tawarikh-i-Punjab'' (1848), written by Ghulam Muhayy-ud-Din alias Bute Shah, Mian Mir laid the foundation of the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] shrine [[Harmandir Sahib]] (Golden Temple), at the request of [[Guru Arjan Dev]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Surindar Singh Kohli |title=The Sikh and Sikhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ED0syBKqafMC&pg=PA68 |publisher=Atlantic |page=68 }}</ref> Although the earliest Sikh records state that the foundation stone was laid by Guru Arjan himself, the later Sikh records mention the legend that appears in ''Tawarikh-i-Punjab''.

To stop such people from coming to see him, Mian Mir posted his ''mureeds'' (disciples) at the gate of his house.<ref name=\"Dawn\">[https://www.dawn.com/news/1235304 A Sufi, a Sikh and their message of love &ndash; A journey from Lahore to Amritsar], Dawn newspaper, Updated 20 May 2017, Retrieved 20 June 2017</ref>\n\nOnce, [[Jahangir]], the Mughal emperor, with all his retinue came to pay homage to the great faqir. He came with all the pomp and show that befitted an emperor. Mian Mir's sentinels however, stopped the emperor at the gate and requested him to wait until their master had given permission to enter. Jahangir felt slighted. No one had ever dared delay or question his entry to any place in his kingdom. Yet he controlled his temper and composed himself. He waited for permission. After a while, he was ushered into Mian Mir's presence. Unable to hide his wounded vanity, Jahangir, as soon as he entered, told Mian Mir in [[Persian language|Persian]]: ''Ba dar-e-darvis darbane naa-bayd'' (\"On the doorstep of a faqir, there should be no sentry\"). The reply from Mian Mir was, \"Babayd keh sage dunia na ayad\" (So that selfish men may not enter).<ref name=economictimes>{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/the-speaking-tree/who-was-the-emperor-jahangir-or-mian-mir/ |website=The Economic Times|author=KJS Ahluwalia|date=31 May 2016|title=Who was the emperor? Jahangir or Mian Mir? |accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe emperor was embarrassed and asked for forgiveness. Then, with folded hands, Jahangir requested Mian Mir to pray for the success of the campaign which he intended to launch for the conquest of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. Meanwhile, a poor man entered and, bowing his head to Mian Mir, made an offering of a [[rupee]] before him. The Sufi asked the devotee to pick up the rupee and give it to the poorest, neediest person in the audience. The devotee went from one [[dervish]] to another but none accepted the rupee. The devotee returned to Mian Mir with the rupee saying: \"Master, none of the dervishes will accept the rupee. None is in need, it seems.\"<ref name=economictimes/>\n\n\"Go and give this rupee to him,\" said the faqir, pointing to Jahangir. \"He is the poorest and most needy of the lot. Not content with a big kingdom, he covets the kingdom of the Deccan. For that, he has come all the way from [[Delhi]] to beg. His hunger is like a fire that burns all the more furiously with more wood. It has made him needy, greedy and grim. Go and give the rupee to him.\"<ref name=economictimes/>\n\n== Mian Mir and Sikhism ==\n\nAccording to Sikh tradition, the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] guru [[Guru Arjan Dev]] met Mian Mir during their stay in [[Lahore]]. This tradition does not appear in the early Sikh literature, and is first mentioned in the 18th and 19th century chronicles. However, it may be possible that this tradition is historically true, and may have been suppressed during the earlier period because of Sikhs' conflicts with the Muslim [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] and [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]].<ref name=\"Pashaura_2006\"/>\n\n=== Legend about foundation of Harmandir Sahib ===\n\nAccording to ''Tawarikh-i-Punjab'' (1848), written by Ghulam Muhayy-ud-Din alias Bute Shah, Mian Mir laid the foundation of the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] shrine [[Harmandir Sahib]] (Golden Temple), at the request of [[Guru Arjan Dev]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Surindar Singh Kohli |title=The Sikh and Sikhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ED0syBKqafMC&pg=PA68 |publisher=Atlantic |page=68 }}</ref> Although the earliest Sikh records state that the foundation stone was laid by Guru Arjan himself, the later Sikh records mention the legend that appears in ''Tawarikh-i-Punjab''.

Martinez-Ruiz's work interrogates and traces the connections between the [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] traditions of graphic writing prevalent in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] & [[Angola]] and the [[Palo (religion)|Palo Monte]] traditions in [[Cuba]]. More broadly, Martinez-Ruiz's research challenges the disciplinary boundaries of [[art history]] to unfold the rich and valuable [[visual communication]], [[ethnography]], [[ecology]] and [[Cosmology|cosmologies]] by and through the art and cultural heritage  of African Atlantic [[diaspora]]s. Martinez-Ruiz received his BA at the [[University of Havana]] in 1994 and his PhD from [[Yale University]] in 2004. At Yale he was a student of [[Robert Farris Thompson]], who wrote the ''Flash of the Spirit: African and Afro-American Art and Philosophy.''  Martinez-Ruiz grew up in Cuba Oriente, the eastern provinces of Cuba and later moved to Havana.  At the age of 18 he was drafted into the Cuban military and was sent to Angola as a soldier.  Upon his return to Cuba, he finished his degree began teaching Caribbean art and working in film, at the [[Instituto Superior de Arte]], in Havana, and Havana University. In this capacity he was able to return to Angola to collaborate with other artists on a film. The film project became a point of entry into the Kongo graphic writing systems and rock painting studies that has informed his research for over 27 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://afropop.org/articles/hip-deep-interview-barbaro-martinez-ruiz|title=Afropop Worldwide {{!}} Hip Deep Interview: Dr. B\u00e1rbaro Mart\u00ednez Ruiz|website=Afropop Worldwide|language=en|access-date=2019-03-15}}</ref>\n\n==Selected publications==\n*''Kongo Graphic Writing and Other Narratives of the Sign'', Temple University Press, 2013 (English)\n*''El Colegio de M\u00e9xico'', 2012 (Spanish)\n*''Faisal Abdu\u2019Allah: On the Art of Dislocation'', Atlantic Center of Modern Art Press, 2012\n*''Art and Emancipation in Jamaica: Isaac Mendes Belisario and his Worlds'', [[Yale University Press]], 2007 (College Art Association Alfred H.
