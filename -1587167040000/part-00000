He explained that people surrounding him (even his own parents) made him feel like he was not normal and treated him differently as a result. Eventually, he would act out and get sent to an [[alternative school]] after expulsion.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/joyner-lucas-announces-new-album-adhd-news.62031.html|title=Joyner Lucas Announces New Album \"ADHD\"|last=|first=|date=August 31, 2019|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/adhd-joyner-lucas-identity-crisis-or-art-imitating-life-news.90843.html|title=ADHD: Joyner Lucas' Identity Crisis Or Art Imitating Life?|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref>\n\n== Feuds ==\n=== Logic ===\nAccording to Lucas, when he was on [[Tech N9ne]] tour bus, he heard some records from Tech's album [[The Storm (Tech N9ne album)|''The Storm'']]. Lucas expressed interest on collaborating with [[Logic (rapper)|Logic]] on the song \"Sriracha\" and felt that it could add to the display of fast-flow rapping, and Tech acquiesced.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2017/12/joyner-lucas-logic-beef-everyday-struggle|title=Joyner Lucas Goes Into Detail About His Issues With Logic|last=Diep|first=Eric|date=December 6, 2017|work=Complex|access-date=}}</ref> Logic was originally slated to be the only feature on \"Sriracha\", but when he spent over six months to deliver his verse, Lucas hopped on the track to offer his own track. Joyner stated that when they got the record back, he could tell that Logic was not \"too happy\" about him being on the track once he heard it.<ref name=\":1\" /> On his remix of [[Future (rapper)|Future]]'s \"[[Mask Off]]\", Joyner, unhappy by the work Logic turned in after taking nearly half a year to edit his verse, directly addressed the disappointing display. Both Joyner Lucas and Tech N9ne were upset with Logic for not emulating the same quick flow and serving up tired, lazy bars.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/joyner-lucas-vs-logic-beef-a-timeline-news.46408.html|title=Joyner Lucas Vs. Logic Beef: A Timeline|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref>\n\nAfter Logic's hit song \"[[1-800-273-8255 (song)|1-800-273-8255]]\" peaked at number three on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100]]'', Joyner Lucas immediately took offense and argued that the track was named in order to bring direct competition to his project, ''508-507-2209''. With both Logic's single and Lucas' mixtape dealing with the issue of mental health representation and resource allocation, Lucas was careful to not slam the track too hard.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhen Logic dropped his song \"Yuck\" from his mixtape ''[[Bobby Tarantino II]]'' in March 2018, the veiled diss inside the song was quickly spotted by Lucas and his fans, despite Logic saying that there was no diss in the song [https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8262625/logic-denies-dissing-joyner-lucas-yuck-bobby-tarantino-ii-video]. Seemingly nonplussed by the insult, Lucas dared Logic to call him out directly on [[Twitter]]. That same month, Joyner took aim at Logic's song \"[[44 More]]\" and his album ''[[Everybody (Logic album)|Everybody]]'' on his remix of [[BlocBoy JB]]'s \"[[Look Alive (BlocBoy JB song)|Look Alive]]\".<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 2019, the two rappers ended their feud, which was revealed when Logic made a guest appearance on Joyner Lucas' song \"[[ISIS (Joyner Lucas song)|ISIS]]\", the third single from ''ADHD''. Lucas kept the name of the collaborator a secret until he released the song.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/05/joyner-lucas-logic-squash-beef-isis-new-song/|title=Joyner Lucas and Logic Squash Beef, Join Forces for New Song, Video \"ISIS\": Listen|last=Berry|first=Peter A.|website=XXL Mag|language=en|access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Hopsin ===\nIn September 2018, when a fan asked [[Los Angeles]] rapper [[Hopsin]] on [[Twitter]] who would win in a [[rap battle]] between him and Joyner Lucas, Hopsin implied that he was the better MC when he replied, \"That's a dumb question that I'm sure you already know the answer to.\" Not long after, Lucas commented, \"Hold up. @Hopsin wtf is that supposed to mean???\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2018/09/hopsin-and-joyner-lucas-beefing|title=It Looks Like Hopsin and Joyner Lucas Are Beefing on Social Media|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> In his response, Hopsin stated that he would \"b[r]eak his soul\" and also dissed Logic in the comment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireboobookitty.com/2018/09/joyner-lucas-hopsin-beef-logic-gets-dragged/|title=Joyner Lucas Hopsin Beef - Logic Gets Dragged|last=LLC|first=Empire BBK|date=2018-09-24|website=Empire BBK|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> This dispute would prove to be short-lived, when in less than two days Hopsin shared a screenshot of a [[FaceTime]] call with Lucas, indicating that they finally made peace, but still wanted people to consider who would beat the other in a rap battle. While the majority favored Hopsin, Lucas was adamant without arguing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.48534/title.hopsin-joyner-lucas-exchange-twitter-smoke-they-need-more-people|title=Hopsin & Joyner Lucas Squash Their Twitter \"Beef\"|last=https://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX-|date=2018-09-22|website=HipHopDX|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Tory Lanez ===\nJoyner Lucas' feud with Canadian recording artist [[Tory Lanez]] began over matters similar to his beef with Hopsin. On November 19, 2018, Lanez claimed that he was a better rapper than Joyner Lucas on an [[Instagram]] Live session. Incredulous, Lucas immediately responded by inviting Lanez to a battle rapping challenge and telling him to let the public decide who is better. The next day, Lanez dropped a freestyle over Eminem's \"Lucky You\", of which Lucas made a guest appearance on. In less than 24 hours, Joyner responded with his freestyle over \"[[Litty]]\" by [[Meek Mill]] featuring Tory Lanez, also targeting rapper [[Trippie Redd]], who joined Tory's Instagram Live and slandered Joyner's name as well. Shortly after, Lanez retaliated with his own freestyle of \"Litty\", titled \"Litty Again\", taking shots at Joyner's collaboration with Eminem. Lucas' [[answer song]] was a freestyle of [[Kodak Black]]'s \"[[Zeze (song)|Zeze]]\". On the track, he mentions Tory's being accused of plagiarism in 2016, when listeners noticed that the ending of Lanez's song \"4am Flex\" was similar to [[Kendrick Lamar]]'s \"The Art of Peer Pressure\". Joyner also accuses him of copying rapper [[Don Q (rapper)|Don Q]]'s flow on his 2017 Funkmaster Flex freestyle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hotawardhiphop.com/editorials-tory-lanez-joyner-lucas-lyrical-beef/|title=Editorials: Tory Lanez and Joyner Lucas Lyrical Beef|last=Hotawardhiphop|date=2018-11-27|website=Hotawardhiphop  Media|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-14}}</ref> On November 23, Tory posted on Instagram a video of him declaring victory in the feud and celebrating.

Both Joyner Lucas and Tech N9ne were upset with Logic for not emulating the same quick flow and serving up tired, lazy bars.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/joyner-lucas-vs-logic-beef-a-timeline-news.46408.html|title=Joyner Lucas Vs. Logic Beef: A Timeline|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref>\n\nAfter Logic's hit song \"[[1-800-273-8255 (song)|1-800-273-8255]]\" peaked at number three on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100]]'', Joyner Lucas immediately took offense and argued that the track was named in order to bring direct competition to his project, ''508-507-2209''. With both Logic's single and Lucas' mixtape dealing with the issue of mental health representation and resource allocation, Lucas was careful to not slam the track too hard.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhen Logic dropped his song \"Yuck\" from his mixtape ''[[Bobby Tarantino II]]'' in March 2018, the veiled diss inside the song was quickly spotted by Lucas and his fans, despite Logic saying that there was no diss in the song [https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8262625/logic-denies-dissing-joyner-lucas-yuck-bobby-tarantino-ii-video]. Seemingly nonplussed by the insult, Lucas dared Logic to call him out directly on [[Twitter]]. That same month, Joyner took aim at Logic's song \"[[44 More]]\" and his album ''[[Everybody (Logic album)|Everybody]]'' on his remix of [[BlocBoy JB]]'s \"[[Look Alive (BlocBoy JB song)|Look Alive]]\".<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 2019, the two rappers ended their feud, which was revealed when Logic made a guest appearance on Joyner Lucas' song \"[[ISIS (Joyner Lucas song)|ISIS]]\", the third single from ''ADHD''. Lucas kept the name of the collaborator a secret until he released the song.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/05/joyner-lucas-logic-squash-beef-isis-new-song/|title=Joyner Lucas and Logic Squash Beef, Join Forces for New Song, Video \"ISIS\": Listen|last=Berry|first=Peter A.|website=XXL Mag|language=en|access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Hopsin ===\nIn September 2018, when a fan asked [[Los Angeles]] rapper [[Hopsin]] on [[Twitter]] who would win in a [[rap battle]] between him and Joyner Lucas, Hopsin implied that he was the better MC when he replied, \"That's a dumb question that I'm sure you already know the answer to.\" Not long after, Lucas commented, \"Hold up. @Hopsin wtf is that supposed to mean???\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2018/09/hopsin-and-joyner-lucas-beefing|title=It Looks Like Hopsin and Joyner Lucas Are Beefing on Social Media|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> In his response, Hopsin stated that he would \"b[r]eak his soul\" and also dissed Logic in the comment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireboobookitty.com/2018/09/joyner-lucas-hopsin-beef-logic-gets-dragged/|title=Joyner Lucas Hopsin Beef - Logic Gets Dragged|last=LLC|first=Empire BBK|date=2018-09-24|website=Empire BBK|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> This dispute would prove to be short-lived, when in less than two days Hopsin shared a screenshot of a [[FaceTime]] call with Lucas, indicating that they finally made peace, but still wanted people to consider who would beat the other in a rap battle. While the majority favored Hopsin, Lucas was adamant without arguing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.48534/title.hopsin-joyner-lucas-exchange-twitter-smoke-they-need-more-people|title=Hopsin & Joyner Lucas Squash Their Twitter \"Beef\"|last=https://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX-|date=2018-09-22|website=HipHopDX|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Tory Lanez ===\nJoyner Lucas' feud with Canadian recording artist [[Tory Lanez]] began over matters similar to his beef with Hopsin. On November 19, 2018, Lanez claimed that he was a better rapper than Joyner Lucas on an [[Instagram]] Live session. Incredulous, Lucas immediately responded by inviting Lanez to a battle rapping challenge and telling him to let the public decide who is better. The next day, Lanez dropped a freestyle over Eminem's \"Lucky You\", of which Lucas made a guest appearance on. In less than 24 hours, Joyner responded with his freestyle over \"[[Litty]]\" by [[Meek Mill]] featuring Tory Lanez, also targeting rapper [[Trippie Redd]], who joined Tory's Instagram Live and slandered Joyner's name as well. Shortly after, Lanez retaliated with his own freestyle of \"Litty\", titled \"Litty Again\", taking shots at Joyner's collaboration with Eminem. Lucas' [[answer song]] was a freestyle of [[Kodak Black]]'s \"[[Zeze (song)|Zeze]]\". On the track, he mentions Tory's being accused of plagiarism in 2016, when listeners noticed that the ending Lanez's song \"4am Flex\" was similar to [[Kendrick Lamar]]'s \"The Art of Peer Pressure\". Joyner also accuses him of copying rapper [[Don Q (rapper)|Don Q]]'s flow on his 2017 Funkmaster Flex freestyle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hotawardhiphop.com/editorials-tory-lanez-joyner-lucas-lyrical-beef/|title=Editorials: Tory Lanez and Joyner Lucas Lyrical Beef|last=Hotawardhiphop|date=2018-11-27|website=Hotawardhiphop  Media|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-14}}</ref> On November 23, Tory posted on Instagram a video of him declaring victory in the feud and celebrating. Displeased, Lucas reposted the video with his own comment, with a reference to Lanez as a singer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/a/tory-lanez-declares-victory-in-feud-with-joyner-lucas|title=Tory Lanez Declares Victory In Feud With Joyner Lucas|website=Genius|language=en|access-date=2019-09-14}}</ref>\n\nThe end of this rivalry was made public on August 8, 2019, when Joyner Lucas and Tory Lanez collaborated on their remix of \"[[Suge (song)|Suge]]\" by [[DaBaby]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tory-lanez-and-joyner-lucas-take-competition-to-the-court-news.89120.html|title=Tory Lanez & Joyner Lucas Take Competition To The Court|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2019-09-14}}</ref>\n\n==Honors and awards==\n===Grammy Awards===\nThe Grammy Awards are held annually by the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]].

Charlotte Bront\u00eb has been called the \"first historian of the private consciousness\", and the literary ancestor of writers like [[Marcel Proust|Proust]] and [[James Joyce|Joyce]].<ref name = Burt224>{{cite book| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=bdtJx5KrZkMC&pg=PA224&dq=%22first+historian+of+the+private+consciousness%22#v=onepage&q=%22first%20historian%20of%20the%20private%20consciousness%22&f=false| title = The Literature 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Novelists, Playwrights, and Poets of All Time| first = Daniel S.| last = Burt| publisher= Infobase Publishing| year = 2008| isbn =  9781438127064}}</ref>\n\nThe book contains elements of [[social criticism]], with a strong sense of Christian morality at its core, and is considered by many to be ahead of its time because of Jane's individualistic character and how the novel approaches the topics of [[Class discrimination|class]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[religion]] and [[feminism]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Madwoman in the Attic|url=https://archive.org/details/madwomaninattic00sand|url-access=registration|authors=Gilbert, Sandra & Gubar, Susan |publisher=Yale University Press|date=1979}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author= Martin, Robert B. |title=Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Novels: The Accents of Persuasion|location=New York |publisher=Norton| date=1966}}</ref> It, along with [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', is one of the most famous romance novels of all time.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Roberts|first=Timothy|title=Jane Eyre|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=8}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n''Jane Eyre'' is divided into 38 chapters. It was originally [[Three-volume novel|published in three volumes]] in the 19th century, comprising chapters 1 to 15, 16 to 27, and 28 to 38.\n\nThe second edition was dedicated to [[William Makepeace Thackeray]].\n\nThe novel is a first-person narrative from the perspective of the title character. The novel's setting is somewhere in the north of England, late in the reign of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] (1760\u20131820).{{efn|name=date|The exact time setting of the novel is impossible to determine, as several references in the text are contradictory. For example, [[Marmion (poem)|''Marmion'']] (pub. 1808) is referred to in Chapter 32 as a \"new publication\", but Ad\u00e8le mentions crossing the Channel by steamship, impossible before 1816.}} It goes through five distinct stages: Jane's childhood at Gateshead Hall, where she is emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she gains friends and role models but suffers privations and oppression; her time as [[governess]] at Thornfield Hall, where she falls in love with her mysterious employer, Edward Fairfax Rochester; her time in the Moor House, during which her earnest but cold clergyman cousin, St. John Rivers, proposes to her; and ultimately her reunion with, and marriage to, her beloved Rochester. Throughout these sections, the novel provides perspectives on a number of important social issues and ideas, many of which are critical of the status quo.\n\n===Jane's childhood===\n[[File:P30b.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Young Jane argues with her guardian Mrs. Reed of Gateshead, illustration by [[F. H. Townsend]]]]\nJane Eyre, aged 10, lives with her maternal uncle's family, the Reeds, as a result of her uncle's dying wish. Jane was [[orphan]]ed several years earlier when her parents died of [[typhus]]. Mr. Reed, Jane's uncle, was the only member of the Reed family who was ever kind to Jane. Jane's aunt, Sarah Reed, dislikes her, abuses her, and treats her as a burden, and discourages her children from associating with Jane. Jane, as a result, becomes defensive against her cruel judgement. The nursemaid, Bessie, proves to be Jane's only ally in the household, even though Bessie occasionally scolds Jane harshly. Excluded from the family activities, Jane leads an unhappy childhood, with only a doll and books with which to entertain herself.\n\nOne day, as punishment for defending herself against her cousin John Reed, Jane is relegated to the ''red room'' in which her late uncle had died; there, she faints from panic after she thinks she has seen his ghost. The red room is significant because it lays the grounds for the \"ambiguous relationship between parents and children\" which plays out in all of Jane's future relationships with male figures throughout the novel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?&id=GALE&#124;A141169742&v=2.1&it=r&p=LitRC&sw=w|title=Jane Eyre in the red-room: Madeleine Wood explores the consequences of Jane's childhood trauma|last=Wood|first=Madeleine|access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref> She is subsequently attended to by the kindly [[apothecary]] Mr. Lloyd to whom Jane reveals how unhappy she is living at Gateshead Hall. He recommends to Mrs. Reed that Jane should be sent to school, an idea Mrs. Reed happily supports. Mrs. Reed then enlists the aid of the harsh Mr. Brocklehurst, who is the director of Lowood Institution, a [[charity school]] for girls, to enroll Jane. Mrs. Reed cautions Mr. Brocklehurst that Jane has a \"tendency for deceit\", which he interprets as her being a \"liar\". Before Jane leaves, however, she confronts Mrs. Reed and declares that she'll never call her \"aunt\" again. Jane also tells Mrs. Reed and her daughters, Georgiana and Eliza, that they are the ones who are deceitful, and that she will tell everyone at Lowood how cruelly the Reeds treated her. Mrs. Reed is hurt badly by these words, but does not have the courage or tenacity to show this.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bront\u00eb|first1=Charlotte|title=Jane Eyre|url=https://archive.org/details/janeeyreautobiog02bron|date=16 October 1847|publisher=Smith, Elder & Co.|location=London, England|pages=[https://archive.org/details/janeeyreautobiog02bron/page/105 105]}}</ref>\n\n===Lowood===\nAt Lowood Institution, a school for poor and orphaned girls, Jane soon finds that life is harsh. She attempts to fit in and befriends an older girl, Helen Burns. During a class session, her new friend is criticised for her poor stance and dirty nails, and receives a lashing as a result. Later, Jane tells Helen that she could not have borne such public humiliation, but Helen philosophically tells her that it would be her duty to do so. Jane then tells Helen how badly she has been treated by Mrs Reed, but Helen tells her that she would be far happier if she did not bear grudges. In due course, Mr Brocklehurst visits the school. While Jane is trying to make herself look inconspicuous, she accidentally drops her slate, thereby drawing attention to herself. She is then forced to stand on a stool, and is branded a sinner and a liar. Later, Miss Temple, the caring superintendent, facilitates Jane's self-defence and publicly clears her of any wrongdoing. Helen and Miss Temple are Jane's two main role models who positively guide her development, despite the harsh treatment she has received from many others.\n\nThe 80 pupils at Lowood are subjected to cold rooms, poor meals, and thin clothing. Many students fall ill when a [[typhus]] epidemic strikes; Helen dies of [[Tuberculosis|consumption]] in Jane's arms. When Mr. Brocklehurst's maltreatment of the students is discovered, several benefactors erect a new building and install a sympathetic management committee to moderate Mr. Brocklehurst's harsh rule. Conditions at the school then improve dramatically.\n\n=== Thornfield Hall ===\n{{main|Thornfield Hall}}\nAfter six years as a student and two as a teacher at Lowood, Jane decides to leave in pursuit of a new life, growing bored of her life at Lowood. Her friend and confidante, Miss Temple, also leaves after getting married. She advertises her services as a [[governess]]. A housekeeper at Thornfield Hall, Alice Fairfax, replies to Jane's advertisement. Jane takes the position, teaching Ad\u00e8le Varens, a young French girl.\n\nOne night, while Jane is walking to a nearby town, a horseman passes her. The horse slips on ice and throws the rider. Despite the rider's surliness, Jane helps him get back onto his horse. Later, back at Thornfield, she learns that this man is Edward Rochester, master of the house. Ad\u00e8le was left in his care when her mother abandoned her.  It is not immediately apparent whether Ad\u00e8le is Rochester's daughter or not.\n\nAt Jane's first meeting with Mr. Rochester, he teases her, accusing her of bewitching his horse to make him fall. Jane is able to stand up to his initially arrogant manner, despite his strange behaviour. Mr. Rochester and Jane soon come to enjoy each other's company, and spend many evenings together.\n\nOdd things start to happen at the house, such as a strange laugh being heard, a mysterious fire in Mr. Rochester's room (from which Jane saves Rochester by rousing him and throwing water on him and the fire), and an attack on a house-guest named Mr. Mason.\n\nAfter Jane saves Mr. Rochester from the fire, he thanks her tenderly and emotionally, and that night Jane feels strange emotions of her own towards him. The next day however he leaves unexpectedly for a distant party gathering, and several days later returns with the whole party, including the beautiful and talented Blanche Ingram. Jane sees that Blanche and Mr. Rochester favour each other and starts to feel jealous, particularly because she also sees that Blanche is snobbish and heartless.\n\nJane then receives word that Mrs. Reed has suffered a stroke and is calling for her. Jane returns to Gateshead and remains there for a month to tend to her dying aunt. Mrs. Reed confesses to Jane that she wronged her, bringing forth a letter from Jane's paternal uncle, Mr. John Eyre, in which he asks for her to live with him and be his heir. Mrs. Reed admits to telling Mr. Eyre that Jane had died of fever at Lowood. Soon afterward, Mrs. Reed dies, and Jane helps her cousins after the funeral before returning to Thornfield.\n[[File:P323b.jpg|thumb|left|200px|St. John Rivers admits Jane to Moor House, illustration by F. H. Townsend]]\n\nBack at Thornfield, Jane broods over Mr. Rochester's rumoured impending marriage to Blanche Ingram. However, one midsummer evening, Rochester baits Jane by saying how much he will miss her after getting married and how she will soon forget him. The normally self-controlled Jane reveals her feelings for him. Rochester then is sure that Jane is sincerely in love with him, and he proposes marriage. Jane is at first skeptical of his sincerity, before accepting his proposal. She then writes to her Uncle John, telling him of her happy news.\n\nAs she prepares for her wedding, Jane's forebodings arise when a strange woman sneaks into her room one night and rips her wedding veil in two. As with the previous mysterious events, Mr. Rochester attributes the incident to Grace Poole, one of his servants. During the wedding ceremony, however, Mr. Mason and a lawyer declare that Mr. Rochester cannot marry because he is already married to Mr. Mason's sister, Bertha. Mr. Rochester admits this is true but explains that his father tricked him into the marriage for her money. Once they were united, he discovered that she was rapidly descending into [[congenital]] madness, and so he eventually locked her away in Thornfield, hiring Grace Poole as a nurse to look after her. When Grace gets drunk, Rochester's wife escapes and causes the strange happenings at Thornfield.\n\nIt turns out that Jane's uncle, Mr. John Eyre, is a friend of Mr. Mason's and was visited by him soon after Mr. Eyre received Jane's letter about her impending marriage. After the marriage ceremony is broken off, Mr. Rochester asks Jane to go with him to the south of France, and live with him as husband and wife, even though they cannot be married. Jane is tempted but must stay true to her Christian values and beliefs. Refusing to go against her principles, and despite her love for him, Jane leaves Thornfield at dawn before anyone else is up.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bront\u00eb|first=Charlotte|title=Jane Eyre|year=2008|publisher=Wilder Publications|location=Radford, Virginia|isbn=978-1604594119}}</ref>\n\n===Other employment===\nJane travels as far from Thornfield as she can using the little money she had previously saved. She accidentally leaves her bundle of possessions on the coach and is forced to sleep on the moor. She unsuccessfully attempts to trade her handkerchief and gloves for food. Exhausted and starving, she eventually makes her way to the home of Diana and Mary Rivers, but is turned away by the housekeeper. She collapses on the doorstep, preparing for her death. St. John Rivers, Diana and Mary's brother and a clergyman, rescues her. After she regains her health, St. John finds Jane a teaching position at a nearby village school. Jane becomes good friends with the sisters, but St. John remains aloof.\n\nThe sisters leave for governess jobs, and St. John becomes somewhat closer to Jane. St. John learns Jane's true identity and astounds her by telling her that her uncle, John Eyre, has died and left her his entire fortune of 20,000 [[Pound sterling|pounds]] (equivalent to just under $1.7 million in 2018<ref>calculated using the UK [[Retail Price Index]]: {{cite web |url=https://www.uwyo.edu/numimage/currency.htm|title=Currency Converter, Pounds Sterling to Dollars, 1264 to Present (Java)}}</ref>). When Jane questions him further, St. John reveals that John Eyre is also his and his sisters' uncle. They had once hoped for a share of the inheritance but were left virtually nothing. Jane, overjoyed by finding that she has living and friendly family members, insists on sharing the money equally with her cousins, and Diana and Mary come back to live at Moor House.\n\n===Proposals===\nThinking that the pious and conscientious Jane will make a suitable missionary's wife, St. John asks her to marry him and to go with him to [[India]], not out of love, but out of duty. Jane initially accepts going to India but rejects the marriage proposal, suggesting they travel as brother and sister. As soon as Jane's resolve against marriage to St. John begins to weaken, she mystically hears Mr. Rochester's voice calling her name. Jane then returns to Thornfield to find only blackened ruins. She learns that Mr. Rochester's wife set the house on fire and committed suicide by jumping from the roof. In his rescue attempts, Mr. Rochester lost a hand and his eyesight. Jane reunites with him, but he fears that she will be repulsed by his condition. \"Am I hideous, Jane?\", he asks. \"Very, sir; you always were, you know\", she replies. When Jane assures him of her love and tells him that she will never leave him, Mr. Rochester proposes again, and they are married. He eventually recovers sight enough to see their newborn son.\n\n==Major characters==\nIn order of first line of dialogue:\n\n===Chapter 1===\n* '''[[Jane Eyre (character)|Jane Eyre]]''': The novel's narrator and protagonist, she eventually becomes the second wife of Edward Rochester.  Orphaned as a baby, Jane struggles through her nearly loveless childhood and becomes governess at Thornfield Hall. Though facially plain, Jane is passionate and strongly principled, and values freedom and independence.  She also has a strong conscience and is a determined Christian.  She is ten at the beginning of the novel, and nineteen or twenty at the end of the main narrative. As the final chapter of the novel states that she has been married to Edward Rochester for ten years, she is approximately thirty at its completion.\n* '''Mrs. Sarah Reed:''' (n\u00e9e '''Gibson''') Jane's maternal aunt by marriage, who reluctantly adopted Jane in accordance with her late husband's wishes.  According to Mrs. Reed, he pitied Jane and often cared for her more than for his own children. Mrs. Reed's resentment leads her to abuse and neglect the girl. She lies to Mr. Brocklehurst about Jane's tendency to lie, preparing him to be severe with Jane when she arrives at Brocklehurst's Lowood School.\n* '''John Reed:''' Jane's fourteen-year-old cousin who bullies her incessantly, sometimes in his mother's presence. John eventually ruins himself as an adult by drinking and gambling, and is rumoured to have committed suicide.\n* '''Eliza Reed:''' Jane's thirteen-year-old first cousin. Envious of her more attractive younger sister and a slave to rigid routine, she self-righteously devotes herself to religion. She leaves for a nunnery near Lisle after her mother's death, determined to estrange herself from her sister.\n* '''Georgiana Reed:''' Jane's eleven-year-old first cousin. Although beautiful and indulged, she is insolent and spiteful. Her elder sister Eliza foils Georgiana's marriage to the wealthy Lord Edwin Vere, when the couple are about to elope. Georgiana eventually marries a, \"wealthy worn-out man of fashion.\"\n* '''Bessie Lee:''' The nursemaid at Gateshead. She often treats Jane kindly, telling her stories and singing her songs, but she has a quick temper. Later, she marries Robert Leaven with whom she has three children.\n\n===Chapter 3===\n* '''Mr. Lloyd:''' A compassionate apothecary who recommends that Jane be sent to school. Later, he writes a letter to Miss Temple confirming Jane's account of her childhood and thereby clears Jane of Mrs. Reed's charge of lying.\n\n===Chapter 4===\n* '''Mr. Brocklehurst:''' The clergyman, director, and treasurer of Lowood School, whose maltreatment of the pupils is eventually exposed. A religious traditionalist, he advocates for his charges the most harsh, plain, and disciplined possible lifestyle, but not, hypocritically, for himself and his own family. His second daughter Augusta exclaimed, \"Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood look\u2026 they looked at my dress and mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.\"\n\n===Chapter 5===\n* '''Miss Maria Temple:''' The kind superintendent of Lowood School, who treats the pupils with respect and compassion. She helps clear Jane of Mr. Brocklehurst's false accusation of deceit and cares for Helen in her last days. Eventually, she marries Reverend Naysmith.\n* '''Miss Scatcherd:''' A sour and strict teacher at Lowood. She constantly punishes Helen Burns for her untidiness but fails to see Helen's substantial good points.\n* '''Helen Burns:''' Jane's best friend at Lowood School. She refuses to hate those who abuse her, trusts in God, and prays for peace one day in heaven. She teaches Jane to trust Christianity and dies of consumption in Jane's arms. [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], in her biography of the Bront\u00eb sisters, wrote that Helen Burns was 'an exact transcript' of [[Maria Bront\u00eb]], who died of consumption at age 11.<ref>{{cite book |last= Gaskell |first=Elizabeth |title= The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb |volume= 1 |year=1857 |publisher= Smith, Elder & Co. |page=73 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jzUJAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA73}}</ref>\n\n===Chapter 11===\n* '''Mrs. Alice Fairfax:''' The elderly, kind widow and the housekeeper of Thornfield Hall; distantly related to the Rochesters.\n* '''Ad\u00e8le Varens:'''{{efn|Pronounced {{IPA-fr |a.d\u025bl va.\u0281\u025b\u0303|}}.{{citation needed|date= February 2019}}}} An excitable French child to whom Jane is a governess at Thornfield. Ad\u00e8le's mother was a dancer named C\u00e9line. She was Mr. Rochester's mistress and claimed that Ad\u00e8le was Mr. Rochester's daughter, though he refuses to believe it due to C\u00e9line's unfaithfulness and Ad\u00e8le's apparent lack of resemblance to him. Ad\u00e8le seems to believe that her mother is dead (she tells Jane in chapter 11, \"I lived long ago with mamma, but she is gone to the Holy Virgin\"). Mr Rochester later tells Jane that C\u00e9line actually abandoned Ad\u00e8le and \"ran away to Italy with a musician or singer\" (ch. 15). Ad\u00e8le and Jane develop a strong liking for one another, and although Mr. Rochester places Ad\u00e8le in a strict school after Jane flees Thornfield, Jane visits Ad\u00e8le after her return and finds a better, less severe school for her. When Ad\u00e8le is old enough to leave school, Jane describes her as \"a pleasing and obliging companion \u2013 docile, good-tempered and well-principled\", and considers her kindness to Ad\u00e8le well repaid.\n* '''Grace Poole:''' \"\u2026a woman of between thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard, plain face\u2026\" Mr. Rochester pays her a very high salary to keep his mad wife, Bertha, hidden and quiet.  Grace is often used as an explanation for odd happenings at the house such as strange laughter that was heard not long after Jane arrived. She has a weakness for drinking that occasionally allows Bertha to escape.\n\n===Chapter 12===\n* '''Edward Fairfax Rochester:''' The master of Thornfield Hall. A [[Byronic hero]], he has a face \"dark, strong, and stern.\" He married Bertha Mason years before the novel begins.\n* '''Leah:''' The housemaid at Thornfield Hall, wife of John the manservant.\n\n===Chapter 17===\n* '''Blanche Ingram:''' Young [[socialite]] whom Mr. Rochester is planning to marry.  Though possessed of great beauty and talent, she treats social inferiors, Jane in particular, with undisguised contempt.  Mr. Rochester exposes her and her mother's mercenary motivations when he puts out a rumour that he is far less wealthy than they imagine.\n\n===Chapter 18===\n* '''Richard Mason:''' An Englishman whose arrival at Thornfield Hall from the West Indies unsettles Mr. Rochester. He is the brother of Rochester's first wife, the woman in the attic, and still cares for his sister's well-being.  During the wedding ceremony of Jane and Mr. Rochester, he exposes the bigamous nature of the marriage.\n\n===Chapter 21===\n* '''Robert Leaven:''' The coachman at Gateshead, who brings Jane the news of the death of the dissolute John Reed, an event which has brought on Mrs. Reed's stroke. He informs her of Mrs. Reed's wish to see Jane before she dies.\n\n===Chapter 26===\n* '''[[Bertha Mason|Bertha Antoinetta Mason]]:''' The first wife of Edward Rochester. After their wedding, her mental health began to deteriorate, and she is now violent and in a state of intense derangement, apparently unable to speak or go into society.  Mr. Rochester, who insists that he was tricked into the marriage by a family who knew Bertha was likely to develop this condition, has kept Bertha locked in the attic at Thornfield for years. She is supervised and cared for by Grace Poole, whose drinking sometimes allows Bertha to escape. After Richard Mason puts an end to Jane and Mr. Rochester's wedding, Rochester finally introduces Jane to Bertha: \"In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure ran backwards and forwards. What it was, whether beast or human being, one could not, at first sight, tell\u2026 it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a mane, hid its head and face.\" Eventually, Bertha sets fire to Thornfield Hall and throws herself to her death from the roof. Bertha is viewed as Jane's \"double\": Jane is pious and just, while Bertha is savage and animalistic.<ref>{{Cite book |title= Madwoman in the Attic after Thirty Years| first =Gilbert I | last = Gubar II |publisher= University of Missouri Press |year= 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Chapter 28===\n* '''Diana and Mary Rivers:''' Sisters in a remote house who take Jane in when she is hungry and friendless, having left Thornfield Hall without making any arrangements for herself. Financially poor but intellectually curious, the sisters are deeply engrossed in reading the evening Jane appears at their door. Eventually, they are revealed to be Jane's cousins.

Helen Burns's death from tuberculosis (referred to as consumption) recalls the deaths of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's sisters, Elizabeth and Maria, who died of the disease in childhood as a result of the conditions at their school, the Clergy Daughters School at [[Cowan Bridge]], near [[Tunstall, Lancashire]]. Mr. Brocklehurst is based on Rev. [[William Carus Wilson]] (1791\u20131859), the Evangelical minister who ran the school. Additionally, John Reed's decline into alcoholism and dissolution recalls the life of Charlotte's brother Branwell, who became an [[opium]] and alcohol addict in the years preceding his death. Finally, like Jane, Charlotte became a governess. These facts were revealed to the public in ''[[The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'' (1857) by Charlotte's friend and fellow novelist [[Elizabeth Gaskell]].<ref name=\"Davies\">[[Stevie Davies]], Introduction and Notes to ''Jane Eyre''.

It was originally [[Three-volume novel|published in three volumes]] in the 19th century, comprising chapters 1 to 15, 16 to 27, and 28 to 38.\n\nThe second edition was dedicated to [[William Makepeace Thackeray]].\n\nThe novel is a first-person narrative from the perspective of the title character. The novel's setting is somewhere in the north of England, late in the reign of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] (1760\u20131820).{{efn|name=date|The exact time setting of the novel is impossible to determine, as several references in the text are contradictory. For example, [[Marmion (poem)|''Marmion'']] (pub. 1808) is referred to in Chapter 32 as a \"new publication\", but Ad\u00e8le mentions crossing the Channel by steamship, impossible before 1816.}} It goes through five distinct stages: Jane's childhood at Gateshead Hall, where she is emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she gains friends and role models but suffers privations and oppression; her time as [[governess]] at Thornfield Hall, where she falls in love with her mysterious employer, Edward Fairfax Rochester; her time in the Moor House, during which her earnest but cold clergyman cousin, St. John Rivers, proposes to her; and ultimately her reunion with, and marriage to, her beloved Rochester. Throughout these sections, the novel provides perspectives on a number of important social issues and ideas, many of which are critical of the status quo.\n\n===Jane's childhood===\n[[File:P30b.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Young Jane argues with her guardian Mrs. Reed of Gateshead, illustration by [[F. H. Townsend]]]]\nJane Eyre, aged 10, lives with her maternal uncle's family, the Reeds, as a result of her uncle's dying wish. Jane was [[orphan]]ed several years earlier when her parents died of [[typhus]]. Mr. Reed, Jane's uncle, was the only member of the Reed family who was ever kind to Jane. Jane's aunt, Sarah Reed, dislikes her, abuses her, and treats her as a burden, and discourages her children from associating with Jane. Jane, as a result, becomes defensive against her cruel judgement. The nursemaid, Bessie, proves to be Jane's only ally in the household, even though Bessie occasionally scolds Jane harshly. Excluded from the family activities, Jane leads an unhappy childhood, with only a doll and books with which to entertain herself.\n\nOne day, as punishment for defending herself against her cousin John Reed, Jane is relegated to the ''red room'' in which her late uncle had died; there, she faints from panic after she thinks she has seen his ghost. The red room is significant because it lays the grounds for the \"ambiguous relationship between parents and children\" which plays out in all of Jane's future relationships with male figures throughout the novel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?&id=GALE&#124;A141169742&v=2.1&it=r&p=LitRC&sw=w|title=Jane Eyre in the red-room: Madeleine Wood explores the consequences of Jane's childhood trauma|last=Wood|first=Madeleine|access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref> She is subsequently attended to by the kindly [[apothecary]] Mr. Lloyd to whom Jane reveals how unhappy she is living at Gateshead Hall. He recommends to Mrs. Reed that Jane should be sent to school, an idea Mrs. Reed happily supports. Mrs. Reed then enlists the aid of the harsh Mr. Brocklehurst, who is the director of Lowood Institution, a [[charity school]] for girls, to enroll Jane. Mrs. Reed cautions Mr. Brocklehurst that Jane has a \"tendency for deceit\", which he interprets as her being a \"liar\". Before Jane leaves, however, she confronts Mrs. Reed and declares that she'll never call her \"aunt\" again. Jane also tells Mrs. Reed and her daughters, Georgiana and Eliza, that they are the ones who are deceitful, and that she will tell everyone at Lowood how cruelly the Reeds treated her. Mrs. Reed is hurt badly by these words, but does not have the courage or tenacity to show this.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bront\u00eb|first1=Charlotte|title=Jane Eyre|url=https://archive.org/details/janeeyreautobiog02bron|date=16 October 1847|publisher=Smith, Elder & Co.|location=London, England|pages=[https://archive.org/details/janeeyreautobiog02bron/page/105 105]}}</ref>\n\n===Lowood===\nAt Lowood Institution, a school for poor and orphaned girls, Jane soon finds that life is harsh. She attempts to fit in and befriends an older girl, Helen Burns. During a class session, her new friend is criticised for her poor stance and dirty nails, and receives a lashing as a result. Later, Jane tells Helen that she could not have borne such public humiliation, but Helen philosophically tells her that it would be her duty to do so. Jane then tells Helen how badly she has been treated by Mrs Reed, but Helen tells her that she would be far happier if she did not bear grudges. In due course, Mr Brocklehurst visits the school. While Jane is trying to make herself look inconspicuous, she accidentally drops her slate, thereby drawing attention to herself. She is then forced to stand on a stool, and is branded a sinner and a liar. Later, Miss Temple, the caring superintendent, facilitates Jane's self-defence and publicly clears her of any wrong doing. Helen and Miss Temple are Jane's two main role models who positively guide her development, despite the harsh treatment she has received from many others.\n\nThe 80 pupils at Lowood are subjected to cold rooms, poor meals, and thin clothing. Many students fall ill when a [[typhus]] epidemic strikes; Helen dies of [[Tuberculosis|consumption]] in Jane's arms. When Mr. Brocklehurst's maltreatment of the students is discovered, several benefactors erect a new building and install a sympathetic management committee to moderate Mr. Brocklehurst's harsh rule. Conditions at the school then improve dramatically.\n\n=== Thornfield Hall ===\n{{main|Thornfield Hall}}\nAfter six years as a student and two as a teacher at Lowood, Jane decides to leave in pursuit of a new life, growing bored of her life at Lowood. Her friend and confidante, Miss Temple, also leaves after getting married. She advertises her services as a [[governess]]. A housekeeper at Thornfield Hall, Alice Fairfax, replies to Jane's advertisement. Jane takes the position, teaching Ad\u00e8le Varens, a young French girl.\n\nOne night, while Jane is walking to a nearby town, a horseman passes her. The horse slips on ice and throws the rider. Despite the rider's surliness, Jane helps him get back onto his horse. Later, back at Thornfield, she learns that this man is Edward Rochester, master of the house. Ad\u00e8le was left in his care when her mother abandoned her.  It is not immediately apparent whether Ad\u00e8le is Rochester's daughter or not.\n\nAt Jane's first meeting with Mr. Rochester, he teases her, accusing her of bewitching his horse to make him fall. Jane is able to stand up to his initially arrogant manner, despite his strange behaviour. Mr. Rochester and Jane soon come to enjoy each other's company, and spend many evenings together.\n\nOdd things start to happen at the house, such as a strange laugh being heard, a mysterious fire in Mr. Rochester's room (from which Jane saves Rochester by rousing him and throwing water on him and the fire), and an attack on a house-guest named Mr. Mason.\n\nAfter Jane saves Mr. Rochester from the fire, he thanks her tenderly and emotionally, and that night Jane feels strange emotions of her own towards him. The next day however he leaves unexpectedly for a distant party gathering, and several days later returns with the whole party, including the beautiful and talented Blanche Ingram. Jane sees that Blanche and Mr. Rochester favour each other and starts to feel jealous, particularly because she also sees that Blanche is snobbish and heartless.\n\nJane then receives word that Mrs. Reed has suffered a stroke and is calling for her. Jane returns to Gateshead and remains there for a month to tend to her dying aunt. Mrs. Reed confesses to Jane that she wronged her, bringing forth a letter from Jane's paternal uncle, Mr. John Eyre, in which he asks for her to live with him and be his heir. Mrs. Reed admits to telling Mr. Eyre that Jane had died of fever at Lowood. Soon afterward, Mrs. Reed dies, and Jane helps her cousins after the funeral before returning to Thornfield.\n[[File:P323b.jpg|thumb|left|200px|St. John Rivers admits Jane to Moor House, illustration by F. H. Townsend]]\n\nBack at Thornfield, Jane broods over Mr. Rochester's rumoured impending marriage to Blanche Ingram. However, one midsummer evening, Rochester baits Jane by saying how much he will miss her after getting married and how she will soon forget him. The normally self-controlled Jane reveals her feelings for him. Rochester then is sure that Jane is sincerely in love with him, and he proposes marriage. Jane is at first skeptical of his sincerity, before accepting his proposal. She then writes to her Uncle John, telling him of her happy news.\n\nAs she prepares for her wedding, Jane's forebodings arise when a strange woman sneaks into her room one night and rips her wedding veil in two. As with the previous mysterious events, Mr. Rochester attributes the incident to Grace Poole, one of his servants. During the wedding ceremony, however, Mr. Mason and a lawyer declare that Mr. Rochester cannot marry because he is already married to Mr. Mason's sister, Bertha. Mr. Rochester admits this is true but explains that his father tricked him into the marriage for her money. Once they were united, he discovered that she was rapidly descending into [[congenital]] madness, and so he eventually locked her away in Thornfield, hiring Grace Poole as a nurse to look after her. When Grace gets drunk, Rochester's wife escapes and causes the strange happenings at Thornfield.\n\nIt turns out that Jane's uncle, Mr. John Eyre, is a friend of Mr. Mason's and was visited by him soon after Mr. Eyre received Jane's letter about her impending marriage. After the marriage ceremony is broken off, Mr. Rochester asks Jane to go with him to the south of France, and live with him as husband and wife, even though they cannot be married. Jane is tempted but must stay true to her Christian values and beliefs. Refusing to go against her principles, and despite her love for him, Jane leaves Thornfield at dawn before anyone else is up.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bront\u00eb|first=Charlotte|title=Jane Eyre|year=2008|publisher=Wilder Publications|location=Radford, Virginia|isbn=978-1604594119}}</ref>\n\n===Other employment===\nJane travels as far from Thornfield as she can using the little money she had previously saved. She accidentally leaves her bundle of possessions on the coach and is forced to sleep on the moor. She unsuccessfully attempts to trade her handkerchief and gloves for food. Exhausted and starving, she eventually makes her way to the home of Diana and Mary Rivers, but is turned away by the housekeeper. She collapses on the doorstep, preparing for her death. St. John Rivers, Diana and Mary's brother and a clergyman, rescues her. After she regains her health, St. John finds Jane a teaching position at a nearby village school. Jane becomes good friends with the sisters, but St. John remains aloof.\n\nThe sisters leave for governess jobs, and St. John becomes somewhat closer to Jane. St. John learns Jane's true identity and astounds her by telling her that her uncle, John Eyre, has died and left her his entire fortune of 20,000 [[Pound sterling|pounds]] (equivalent to just under $1.7 million in 2018<ref>calculated using the UK [[Retail Price Index]]: {{cite web |url=https://www.uwyo.edu/numimage/currency.htm|title=Currency Converter, Pounds Sterling to Dollars, 1264 to Present (Java)}}</ref>). When Jane questions him further, St. John reveals that John Eyre is also his and his sisters' uncle. They had once hoped for a share of the inheritance but were left virtually nothing. Jane, overjoyed by finding that she has living and friendly family members, insists on sharing the money equally with her cousins, and Diana and Mary come back to live at Moor House.\n\n===Proposals===\nThinking that the pious and conscientious Jane will make a suitable missionary's wife, St. John asks her to marry him and to go with him to [[India]], not out of love, but out of duty. Jane initially accepts going to India but rejects the marriage proposal, suggesting they travel as brother and sister. As soon as Jane's resolve against marriage to St. John begins to weaken, she mystically hears Mr. Rochester's voice calling her name. Jane then returns to Thornfield to find only blackened ruins. She learns that Mr. Rochester's wife set the house on fire and committed suicide by jumping from the roof. In his rescue attempts, Mr. Rochester lost a hand and his eyesight. Jane reunites with him, but he fears that she will be repulsed by his condition. \"Am I hideous, Jane?\", he asks. \"Very, sir; you always were, you know\", she replies. When Jane assures him of her love and tells him that she will never leave him, Mr. Rochester proposes again, and they are married. He eventually recovers sight enough to see their newborn son.\n\n==Major characters==\nIn order of first line of dialogue:\n\n===Chapter 1===\n* '''[[Jane Eyre (character)|Jane Eyre]]''': The novel's narrator and protagonist, she eventually becomes the second wife of Edward Rochester.  Orphaned as a baby, Jane struggles through her nearly loveless childhood and becomes governess at Thornfield Hall. Though facially plain, Jane is passionate and strongly principled, and values freedom and independence.  She also has a strong conscience and is a determined Christian.  She is ten at the beginning of the novel, and nineteen or twenty at the end of the main narrative. As the final chapter of the novel states that she has been married to Edward Rochester for ten years, she is approximately thirty at its completion.\n* '''Mrs. Sarah Reed:''' (n\u00e9e '''Gibson''') Jane's maternal aunt by marriage, who reluctantly adopted Jane in accordance with her late husband's wishes.  According to Mrs. Reed, he pitied Jane and often cared for her more than for his own children. Mrs. Reed's resentment leads her to abuse and neglect the girl. She lies to Mr. Brocklehurst about Jane's tendency to lie, preparing him to be severe with Jane when she arrives at Brocklehurst's Lowood School.\n* '''John Reed:''' Jane's fourteen-year-old cousin who bullies her incessantly, sometimes in his mother's presence. John eventually ruins himself as an adult by drinking and gambling, and is rumoured to have committed suicide.\n* '''Eliza Reed:''' Jane's thirteen-year-old first cousin. Envious of her more attractive younger sister and a slave to rigid routine, she self-righteously devotes herself to religion. She leaves for a nunnery near Lisle after her mother's death, determined to estrange herself from her sister.\n* '''Georgiana Reed:''' Jane's eleven-year-old first cousin. Although beautiful and indulged, she is insolent and spiteful. Her elder sister Eliza foils Georgiana's marriage to the wealthy Lord Edwin Vere, when the couple are about to elope. Georgiana eventually marries a, \"wealthy worn-out man of fashion.\"\n* '''Bessie Lee:''' The nursemaid at Gateshead. She often treats Jane kindly, telling her stories and singing her songs, but she has a quick temper. Later, she marries Robert Leaven with whom she has three children.\n\n===Chapter 3===\n* '''Mr. Lloyd:''' A compassionate apothecary who recommends that Jane be sent to school. Later, he writes a letter to Miss Temple confirming Jane's account of her childhood and thereby clears Jane of Mrs. Reed's charge of lying.\n\n===Chapter 4===\n* '''Mr. Brocklehurst:''' The clergyman, director, and treasurer of Lowood School, whose maltreatment of the pupils is eventually exposed. A religious traditionalist, he advocates for his charges the most harsh, plain, and disciplined possible lifestyle, but not, hypocritically, for himself and his own family. His second daughter Augusta exclaimed, \"Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood look\u2026 they looked at my dress and mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.\"\n\n===Chapter 5===\n* '''Miss Maria Temple:''' The kind superintendent of Lowood School, who treats the pupils with respect and compassion. She helps clear Jane of Mr. Brocklehurst's false accusation of deceit and cares for Helen in her last days. Eventually, she marries Reverend Naysmith.\n* '''Miss Scatcherd:''' A sour and strict teacher at Lowood. She constantly punishes Helen Burns for her untidiness but fails to see Helen's substantial good points.\n* '''Helen Burns:''' Jane's best friend at Lowood School. She refuses to hate those who abuse her, trusts in God, and prays for peace one day in heaven. She teaches Jane to trust Christianity and dies of consumption in Jane's arms.

She was Mr. Rochester's mistress and claimed that Ad\u00e8le was Mr. Rochester's daughter, though he refuses to believe it due to C\u00e9line's unfaithfulness and Ad\u00e8le's apparent lack of resemblance to him. Ad\u00e8le seems to believe that her mother is dead (she tells Jane in chapter 11, \"I lived long ago with mamma, but she is gone to the Holy Virgin\"). Mr Rochester later tells Jane that C\u00e9line actually abandoned Ad\u00e8le and \"ran away to Italy with a musician or singer\" (ch. 15). Ad\u00e8le and Jane develop a strong liking for one another, and although Mr. Rochester places Ad\u00e8le in a strict school after Jane flees Thornfield, Jane visits Ad\u00e8le after her return and finds a better, less severe school for her. When Ad\u00e8le is old enough to leave school, Jane describes her as \"a pleasing and obliging companion \u2013 docile, good-tempered and well-principled\", and considers her kindness to Ad\u00e8le well repaid.\n* '''Grace Poole:''' \"\u2026a woman of between thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard, plain face\u2026\" Mr. Rochester pays her a very high salary to keep his mad wife, Bertha, hidden and quiet.

Though possessed of great beauty and talent, she treats social inferiors, Jane in particular, with undisguised contempt.

Mr. Rochester, who insists that he was tricked into the marriage by a family who knew Bertha was likely to develop this condition, has kept Bertha locked in the attic at Thornfield for years. She is supervised and cared for by Grace Poole, whose drinking sometimes allows Bertha to escape. After Richard Mason puts an end to Jane and Mr. Rochester's wedding, Rochester finally introduces Jane to Bertha: \"In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure ran backwards and forwards. What it was, whether beast or human being, one could not, at first sight, tell\u2026 it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a mane, hid its head and face.\" Eventually, Bertha sets fire to Thornfield Hall and throws herself to her death from the roof. Bertha is viewed as Jane's \"double\": Jane is pious and just, while Bertha is savage and animalistic.<ref>{{Cite book |title= Madwoman in the Attic after Thirty Years| first =Gilbert I | last = Gubar II |publisher= University of Missouri Press |year= 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Chapter 28===\n* '''Diana and Mary Rivers:''' Sisters in a remote house who take Jane in when she is hungry and friendless, having left Thornfield Hall without making any arrangements for herself.

Helen Burns's death from tuberculosis (referred to as consumption) recalls the deaths of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's sisters, Elizabeth and Maria, who died of the disease in childhood as a result of the conditions at their school, the Clergy Daughters School at [[Cowan Bridge]], near [[Tunstall, Lancashire]]. Mr. Brocklehurst is based on Rev. [[William Carus Wilson]] (1791\u20131859), the Evangelical minister who ran the school. Additionally, John Reed's decline into alcoholism and dissolution recalls the life of Charlotte's brother Branwell, who became an [[opium]] and alcohol addict in the years preceding his death. Finally, like Jane, Charlotte became a governess. These facts were revealed to the public in ''[[The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'' (1857) by Charlotte's friend and fellow novelist [[Elizabeth Gaskell]].<ref name=\"Davies\">[[Stevie Davies]], Introduction and Notes to ''Jane Eyre''.

superhero [[Thing (comics)|Thing]])\n\nDespite the show's title, the two segments remained separate and did not cross over with one another. The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title ''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros.

The other books of hadith are [[Sunan Abu Dawood]], [[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]], [[Al-Sunan al-Sughra]] and [[Sunan ibn Majah]]. However the [[Maliki]]s, one of the four Sunni \"schools of thought\" (''[[madhhab]]s''), traditionally reject Sunan ibn Majah and assert the canonical status of [[Muwatta Imam Malik]].  \n*In the [[Twelver]] Shi'a branch of Islam, the canonical hadith collections are ''[[the Four Books]]'': [[Kitab al-Kafi]], [[Man la yahduruhu al-Faqih]], [[Tahdhib al-Ahkam]], and [[Al-Istibsar]]. \n*In the [[Ibadi]] branch of Islam, the main canonical collection is the [[Tartib al-Musnad]]. This is an expansion of the earlier [[Jami Sahih]] collection, which retains canonical status in its own right.\n*The [[Ismaili]] shia sects use the [[Daim al-Islam]] as hadith collections. \n*The [[Ahmadiyya]] sect generally rely on the Sunni canons.\n*Some minor groups, collectively known as [[Quranists]], reject the authority of the hadith collections altogether.<ref name=\"Aisha Y.

Narrators who took the side of [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]] rather than [[Ali]], in the disputes over leadership that followed the death of Muhammad, are seen as unreliable by the Shia; narrations sourced to [[Ali]] and the family of Muhammad, and to their supporters, are preferred. Sunni scholars put trust in narrators such as [[Aisha]], whom Shia reject. Differences in hadith collections have contributed to differences in worship practices and shari'a law and have hardened the dividing line between the two traditions.\n\n====Extent and nature in the Sunni tradition====\nIn the Sunni tradition, the number of such texts is somewhere between seven and thirteen thousand,{{#tag:ref|See the references and discussion by Abdul Fattah Abu Ghuddah ''Thalathatu rasa'il fi ulum al-hadith; risalat abi dawud ila ahl makkata fi wasf sunanihi'', pg 36, footnote.

If,  say, ten companions record a text reporting a single incident in the life of Muhammad, hadith scholars can count this as ten hadiths. So Musnad Ahmad, for example, has over 30,000 hadiths\u2014but this count includes texts that are repeated in order to record slight variations within the text or within the chains of narrations.

They have their own extensive hadith literature. The best-known hadith collections are [[The Four Books]], which were compiled by three authors who are known as the 'Three Muhammads'.<ref name=\"Momen, Moojan 1985, p.174\">Momen, Moojan, ''Introduction to Shi'i Islam'', Yale University Press, 1985, p.174.</ref> The Four Books are: ''Kitab al-Kafi'' by [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni]] al-Razi (329 [[Hijri year|AH]]), ''Man la yahduruhu al-Faqih'' by [[Al-Shaykh al-Saduq|Muhammad ibn Babuya]] and ''Al-Tahdhib'' and ''Al-Istibsar'' both by [[Shaykh Tusi|Shaykh Muhammad Tusi]]. Shi'a clerics also make use of extensive collections and commentaries by later authors.\n\nUnlike Sunnis, the majority of Shia do not consider any of their hadith collections to be sahih (authentic) in their entirety. Therefore, every individual hadith in a specific collection must be investigated separately to determine its authenticity. However, the Akhbari school does take all hadith from the four books as authentic.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mohammad A. Shomali|title=Shi'i Islam: Origins, Faith and Practices|date=2003|publisher=ICAS Press|isbn=9781904063117|page=35|edition=reprint}}</ref>\n\nThe importance of hadith in the Shia school of thought is well documented. This can be captured by Ali ibn Abi Talib, cousin of Muhammad, when he narrated that \"Whoever of our Shia (followers) knows our [[Shariah]] and takes out the weak of our followers from the darkness of ignorance to the light of knowledge (Hadith) which we (Ahl al-Bayt) have gifted to them, he on the day of judgement will come with a crown on his head.

Then all those whomever he had taught in the worldly life anything of goodness, or had opened from his heart a lock of ignorance or had removed his doubts will come out.\"<ref name=\"Kafi2013\"/>\n\nRegarding the importance of maintaining accuracy in recording hadith, it has been documented that [[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the great grandson of Muhammad, has said that \"Holding back in a doubtful issue is better than entering destruction. Your not narrating a Hadith is better than you narrating a Hadith in which you have not studied thoroughly. On every truth, there is a reality. Above every right thing, there is a light.

This is achieved by \n*the individual narrators involved in its transmission, \n*the scale of the report's transmission, \n*analyzing the text of the report, and \n*the routes through which the report was transmitted.\n\nOn the basis of these criteria, various classifications were devised for hadith. The earliest comprehensive work in hadith studies was [[Ramahurmuzi|Abu Muhammad al-Ramahurmuzi's]] ''al-Muhaddith al-Fasil'', while another significant work was [[Hakim al-Nishaburi|al-Hakim al-Naysaburi]]'s ''Ma\u2018rifat \u2018ulum al-hadith''. Ibn al-Salah's [[Introduction to the Science of Hadith|''\u02bbUlum al-hadith'']] is considered the standard classical reference on hadith studies.<ref name=\"H-EoI\"/> Some schools of Hadith methodology apply as many as sixteen separate tests.<ref name=\"Shafi\"/>\n\n===Biographical evaluation===\n{{Main|Biographical evaluation}}\nBiographical analysis (''[[Biographical evaluation|\u2018ilm al-rij\u0101l]]'', lit. \"science of people\", also \"science of ''Asma Al-Rijal' or ''\u2018ilm al-jar\u1e25 wa al-ta\u02bbd\u012bl'' (\"science of discrediting and accrediting\"), in which details about the transmitter are scrutinized. This includes analyzing their date and place of birth; familial connections; teachers and students; religiosity; moral behaviour; literary output; their travels; as well as their date of death. Based upon these criteria, the reliability (''thiq\u0101t'') of the transmitter is assessed. Also determined is whether the individual was actually able to transmit the report, which is deduced from their contemporaneity and geographical proximity with the other transmitters in the chain.<ref>Berg (2000) p. 8</ref><ref name=\"Shafi\">{{cite web |last1=Shafi |first1=Mohammad |title=The HADITH - How it was Collected and Compiled |url=http://www.daralislam.org/portals/0/Publications/TheHADITHHowitwasCollectedandCompiled.pdf |website=Dar al-Islam |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref> Examples of biographical dictionaries include: [[Abd al-Ghani al-Maqdisi]]'s ''[[Al-Kamal fi Asma' al-Rijal]]'', Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani's ''Tahdh\u012bb al-Tahdh\u012bb'' and [[al-Dhahabi]]'s ''Tadhkirat al-huffaz''.<ref>See:\n* Robinson (2003) pp. 69\u201370;\n* Lucas (2004) p. 15</ref>\n\n===Scale of transmission===\nHadith on matters of importance needed to come through a number of independent chains,<ref name=\"Shafi\"/> this was known as the scale of transmission. Reports that passed through many reliable transmitters in many ''isnad'' up until their collection and transcription are known as ''[[Hadith terminology#Mutawatir|mutaw\u0101tir]]''. These reports are considered the most authoritative as they pass through so many different routes that collusion between all of the transmitters becomes an impossibility. Reports not meeting this standard are known  as ''[[Hadith terminology#Ahaad|aahad]]'', and are of several different types.<ref name=\"H-EoI\"/>\n\n===Analyzing text===\nAccording to Muhammad Shafi, Hadith whose isnad has been scrutinized then have their text or ''matn'' examined for\n*contradiction of the Quran<ref name=\"Shafi\"/>\n*contradiction of reliable hadith<ref name=\"Shafi\"/>\n*making sense, being logical<ref name=\"Shafi\"/>\n*being a report about the importance of an individual (or individuals) which is transmitted only through their supporters or family, and which is not supported by reports from other independent channels.<ref name=\"Shafi\"/>\n\nHowever, [[Joseph Schacht]] states that the \"whole technical criticism of traditions ... is mainly based on criticism of isnads\", which he (and others) believe to be ineffective in eliminating fraudulent hadith.<ref name=\"[Schacht-1950_163]\">{{cite book| last1=Schacht |first1=Joseph |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon |date=1950 |p=163}}</ref>\n\n===Terminology: admissible and inadmissible hadiths===\n{{Main|Hadith terminology}}\nHaving been evaluated, hadith may be categorized.

'Provided the chain was uninterrupted and its individual links deemed trustworthy persons, the Hadith was accepted as binding law.

Then the generation following them received it, thus conveying it to those after them and so on. So a companion would say, \"I heard the Prophet say such and such.\" The Follower would then say, \"I heard a companion say, 'I heard the Prophet.'\" The one after him would then say, \"I heard someone say, 'I heard a Companion say, 'I heard the Prophet...''\" and so on.<ref>''Ilm al-Rijal wa Ahimiyatih'', by Mualami, p. 16, Dar al-Rayah.</ref>\n\n===Different schools===\nDifferent branches of Islam refer to different collections of hadith, though the same incident may be found in hadith in different collections:\n*In the Sunni branch of Islam, the canonical hadith collections are ''[[Kutub al-Sittah|the six books]]'', of which [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]] generally have the highest status. The other books of hadith are [[Sunan Abu Dawood]], [[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]], [[Al-Sunan al-Sughra]] and [[Sunan ibn Majah]]. However the [[Maliki]]s, one of the four Sunni \"schools of thought\" (''[[madhhab]]s''), traditionally reject Sunan ibn Majah and assert the canonical status of [[Muwatta Imam Malik]].  \n*In the [[Twelver]] Shi'a branch of Islam, the canonical hadith collections are ''[[the Four Books]]'': [[Kitab al-Kafi]], [[Man la yahduruhu al-Faqih]], [[Tahdhib al-Ahkam]], and [[Al-Istibsar]]. \n*In the [[Ibadi]] branch of Islam, the main canonical collection is the [[Tartib al-Musnad]]. This is an expansion of the earlier [[Jami Sahih]] collection, which retains canonical status in its own right.\n*The [[Ismaili]] shia sects use the [[Daim al-Islam]] as hadith collections. \n*The [[Ahmadiyya]] sect generally rely on the Sunni canons.\n*Some minor groups, collectively known as [[Quranists]], reject the authority of the hadith collections altogether.<ref name=\"Aisha Y. Musa 2013\"/><ref name=\"Neal Robinson 2013 pp. 85-89\"/>\n\nIn general, the difference between Shi'a and Sunni collections is that Shia give preference to hadiths credited to the Prophet's family and close associates (''[[Ahl al-Bayt]]''), while Sunnis do not consider family lineage in evaluating hadith and sunnah narrated by any of twelve thousand companions of Muhammad.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web|title=Religions.

Narrators who took the side of [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]] rather than [[Ali]], in the disputes over leadership that followed the death of Muhammad, are seen as unreliable by the Shia; narrations sourced to [[Ali]] and the family of Muhammad, and to their supporters, are preferred. Sunni scholars put trust in narrators such as [[Aisha]], whom Shia reject. Differences in hadith collections have contributed to differences in worship practices and shari'a law and have hardened the dividing line between the two traditions.\n\n====Extent and nature in the Sunni tradition====\nIn the Sunni tradition, the number of such texts is somewhere between seven and thirteen thousand,{{#tag:ref|See the references and discussion by Abdul Fattah Abu Ghuddah ''Thalathatu rasa'il fi ulum al-hadith; risalat abi dawud ila ahl makkata fi wasf sunanihi'', pg 36, footnote.

If,  say, ten companions record a text reporting a single incident in the life of Muhammad, hadith scholars can count this as ten hadiths. So Musnad Ahmad, for example, has over 30,000 hadiths\u2014but this count includes texts that are repeated in order to record slight variations within the text or within the chains of narrations. Identifying the narrators of the various texts, comparing their narrations of the same texts to identify both the soundest reporting of a text and the reporters who are most sound in their reporting occupied experts of hadith throughout the 2nd century.

This auxiliary literature has contributed to making their study the place of departure for any serious study of hadith. In addition, Bukhari and Muslim in particular, claimed that they were collecting only the soundest of sound hadiths.

Some are more general, like the ''mu\u1e63annaf'', the ''mu\u02bfjam'', and the ''j\u0101mi\u02bf'', and some more specific, either characterized by the topics treated, like the ''sunan'' (restricted to legal-liturgical traditions), or by its composition, like the [[Forty hadith|''arba\u02bf\u012bniyy\u0101t'']] (collections of forty hadiths).<ref name=\"siddiqi\">Muhammad Zubayr Siddiqi, ''Hadith Literature'', Cambridge, Islamic Texts Society, 1993, edited and revised by Abdal Hakim Murad.</ref>\n\n====Extent and nature in the Shia tradition====\nShi'a Muslims seldom if ever use the [[six major hadith collections]] followed by the Sunni, as they do not trust many of the Sunni narrators and transmitters. They have their own extensive hadith literature. The best-known hadith collections are [[The Four Books]], which were compiled by three authors who are known as the 'Three Muhammads'.<ref name=\"Momen, Moojan 1985, p.174\">Momen, Moojan, ''Introduction to Shi'i Islam'', Yale University Press, 1985, p.174.</ref> The Four Books are: ''Kitab al-Kafi'' by [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni]] al-Razi (329 [[Hijri year|AH]]), ''Man la yahduruhu al-Faqih'' by [[Al-Shaykh al-Saduq|Muhammad ibn Babuya]] and ''Al-Tahdhib'' and ''Al-Istibsar'' both by [[Shaykh Tusi|Shaykh Muhammad Tusi]]. Shi'a clerics also make use of extensive collections and commentaries by later authors.\n\nUnlike Sunnis, the majority of Shia do not consider any of their hadith collections to be sahih (authentic) in their entirety. Therefore, every individual hadith in a specific collection must be investigated separately to determine its authenticity. However, the Akhbari school does take all hadith from the four books as authentic.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mohammad A. Shomali|title=Shi'i Islam: Origins, Faith and Practices|date=2003|publisher=ICAS Press|isbn=9781904063117|page=35|edition=reprint}}</ref>\n\nThe importance of hadith in the Shia school of thought is well documented. This can be captured by Ali ibn Abi Talib, cousin of Muhammad, when he narrated that \"Whoever of our Shia (followers) knows our [[Shariah]] and takes out the weak of our followers from the darkness of ignorance to the light of knowledge (Hadith) which we (Ahl al-Bayt) have gifted to them, he on the day of judgement will come with a crown on his head. It will shine among the people gathered on the plain of resurrection.\"<ref name=\"Kafi2013\"/> [[Hassan al-Askari]], a descendant of Muhammad, gave support to this narration, stating \"Whoever he had taken out in the worldly life from the darkness of ignorance can hold to his light to be taken out of the darkness of the plain of resurrection to the garden (paradise). Then all those whomever he had taught in the worldly life anything of goodness, or had opened from his heart a lock of ignorance or had removed his doubts will come out.\"<ref name=\"Kafi2013\"/>\n\nRegarding the importance of maintaining accuracy in recording hadith, it has been documented that [[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the great grandson of Muhammad, has said that \"Holding back in a doubtful issue is better than entering destruction. Your not narrating a Hadith is better than you narrating a Hadith in which you have not studied thoroughly. On every truth, there is a reality. Above every right thing, there is a light. Whatever agrees with the book of Allah you must take it and whatever disagrees you must leave it alone.\"<ref name=\"Kafi2013\">{{cite book|last1=ibn Ya\u2019qub al-Kulayni|first1=Abu Ja\u2019far Muhammad|title=Kitab al-Kafi|date=February 2013|publisher=The Islamic Seminary Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-9890016-2-5|edition=eBook}}</ref>{{rp|10}} Al-Baqir also emphasized the selfless devotion of Ahl al-Bayt to preserving the traditions of Muhammad through his conversation with [[Jabir ibn Abd Allah]], an old companion of Muhammad. He (Al-Baqir) said, \"Oh Jabir, had we spoken to you from our opinions and desires, we would be counted among those who are destroyed. We speak to you of the hadith which we treasure from the Messenger of Allah, Oh Allah grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to your cause, just as they treasure their gold and silver.\"<ref name=\"Kafi2013\" /> Further, it has been narrated that [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the son of al-Baqir, has said the following regarding hadith: \"You must write it down; you will not memorize until you write it down.\"<ref name= Kafi2013/>{{rp|33}}\n\n===Modern usage===\n[[File:Forty hadith nawawi taught by Sheikh Usama al Azhari in Sultan Hassan Mosque.JPG|thumb|[[Imam Nawawi's Forty Hadith]] taught in the [[Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan]] in Cairo, Egypt]]\nThe mainstream sects consider hadith to be essential supplements to, and clarifications of, the Quran, Islam's holy book, as well as for clarifying issues pertaining to Islamic jurisprudence. [[Ibn al-Salah]], a hadith specialist, described the relationship between hadith and other aspect of the religion by saying: \"It is the science most pervasive in respect to the other sciences in their various branches, in particular to jurisprudence being the most important of them.\"<ref>''Ulum al-Hadith'' by Ibn al-Salah, p. 5, Dar al-Fikr, with the verification of Nur al-Din al-\u2018Itr.</ref> \"The intended meaning of 'other sciences' here are those pertaining to religion,\" explains Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, \"Quranic exegesis, hadith, and jurisprudence.

As for Quranic [[exegesis]], then the preferred manner of explaining the speech of God is by means of what has been accepted as a statement of Muhammad.

{"title_page": "Fyffe Christie", "text_new": "{{short description|British artist}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2013}}\n{{Use British English|date=December 2013}}\n'''Fyffe William George Christie''' (2 February 1918, [[Bushey]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]], \u2013 6 March 1979) was a British [[figurative artist]] and [[mural]] painter. He served in the [[British Army]] during [[World War II]] as a [[Bagpipers|bagpiper]] and [[stretcher bearer]]. He began painting during the war and attended the [[Glasgow School of Art]] from 1946 to 1951. After graduating, he began painting murals, including ''Christ Feeding the People'' (1950-1951) and various others in Glasgow, including one in the [[Glasgow University Union]]. Christie then moved to London, where he taught at various schools and continued painting.\n\n==Early years==\nFyffe Christie was born in the English town of [[Bushey]], Hertfordshire, in 1918. His father was a Scot, George Fyffe Christie, a freelance commercial artist who illustrated children's books and cartoon postcards featuring children and animals. As a commercial artist father George may have been attracted to Bushey by its closeness to London and the town's reputation as an artistic colony as previously established by the artist [[Hubert Herkomer]]. It was there that George met and married an English girl, Fyffe's mother Ethel.\n\nAround 1930 Ethel died and at the age of twelve Fyffe moved back to Glasgow with his father and younger brother Andrew to live together with his uncle David and aunt Tiz in Glasgow's [[Pollokshields]] district. Fyffe Christie suffered from severe [[dyslexia]] and was unable to read until diagnosed at the age of twelve, after which he became a keen scholar and avid reader, including [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. He was also fully [[ambidextrous]] and struggled as the teachers of that time insisted he write only with his right hand. Two years later tragedy struck again as brother Andrew died. Fyffe showed an early interest in drawing and painting, and developed a lifelong love of music, particularly classical music and opera, while he himself learned to play the [[bagpipes]]. Father George Christie had some commercial success with his creation of the cartoon strip ''Scottikin O' the Bulletin'' in the popular Glasgow newspaper the ''Bulletin'' but he struggled financially through the years of the recession however and so he discouraged Fyffe's artistic ambition. Due to economic hardship Christie had to leave school early, despite his academic abilities and George Christie insisted his son begin a career in the more secure legal profession. After two years working in a lawyers office Fyffe left and began an apprenticeship arranged for him as a lithographic draughtsman but he remained unhappy and frustrated with his life.\n\n==World War Two==\nAt the outset of The Second World War Fyffe Christie joined the [[British Army]] as a [[bagpipes|bagpiper]] (pipers at that time also served a dual role as [[stretcher bearer]]s while in the field), attending a course at the [[Army School of Piping]] in [[Edinburgh Castle]]. He was then posted to the 9th battalion the [[Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)|Cameronians]] (Scottish Rifles). The battalion was in continuous action after landing at [[Arromanches]] following the [[D-Day]] landings, 6 June 1944 and suffered heavy casualties as they fought for eleven months from [[Normandy]] into Northern Germany. In his article 'Fyffe Christie: Scottish Soldier and Artist' in the regimental magazine 'The Covenanter' friend Dr.Ted Allan CBE described how the battalion received its baptism of fire on its first attack to take the village of [[Haut Du Bosq]] when its casualties totalled 120 killed and wounded, followed by bitter fighting in the orchards around [[Eterville]] while resisting a German counterattack. Christie witnessed the most horrific scenes as the battalion marched down a road in the [[Falaise Gap]] following the virtual annihilation of the retreating German Army.\n\nDuring rest periods Christie began to sketch and paint the scenes and landscapes around him in ink and watercolours as a refuge and way of coping with what he witnessed in combat, Allan states that Christie maintained that this was \"not just art but a defence mechanism\".<ref>Allan, Ted, [http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1bjk0/TheCovenanter2003Edi/resources/35.htm \"Fyffe Christie: Scottish Soldier and Artist\"], \"The Covenanter\", 2003, p38</ref> These sketches and watercolours are now held in the Cameronian's Regimental Museum, the [[National Museum of Scotland]] in Edinburgh, and the [[Imperial War Museum]], London; while the majority are with the [[Second World War Experience Centre]] in Leeds. Many of the young soldiers he served with were [[illiterate]] and, having overcome his own childhood [[dyslexia]], Christie often helped his comrades by reading their letters from home and writing their replies for them. Ted Allan described how pipers were popular figures during the liberation of towns as the battalion fought its way towards Germany, the men of the regiment forming a particular and lasting bond with the people of [[Tilburg]] in the Netherlands in this way.<ref name=\"Allan-p37\">Allan, Ted, [http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1bjk0/TheCovenanter2003Edi/resources/35.htm \"Fyffe Christie: Scottish Soldier and Artist\"], \"The Covenanter\", 2003, p37</ref> Shortly afterwards the men of 9th battalion were involved in the battle for [[Moylands]] Woods, a particularly brutal fight and prelude to the advance into Germany itself. The battalion had frequently been opposed by elite German parachute units (often of the 7th Division) but as the fighting progressed the men found themselves increasingly facing fanatical [[Hitler Youth]] and the old men of the [[Volksturm]]. In the advance into Germany there was also the discovery of [[Concentration Camps]], yet Allan also refers to an incident in which humanity took precedence and a surrender was arranged in the middle of a battle on the basis that the Cameronian stretcher bearers entered an uncleared [[minefield]] in order to extricate the German wounded\".<ref name=\"Allan-p37\" />  \n\nIn the same Covenanter article Fyffe's wife Eleanor Christie explained that his father George's opposition to an artistic career lessened as he was greatly impressed by the quality of the sketches and watercolours Fyffe was sending home from the front while at the same time Fyffe was also greatly encouraged by his comrades who admired his paintings. Fyffe later told her that it was in the last days of the war, as he stood in a bombed out German railway station gazing out at the landscape that he made the final decision to become an artist\".<ref name=\"Allan-p39\">Allan, Ted, [http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1bjk0/TheCovenanter2003Edi/resources/35.htm \"Fyffe Christie: Scottish Soldier and Artist\"], \"The Covenanter\", 2003, p39</ref> The Imperial War Museum now owns one of Christie's watercolours of [[L\u00fcbeck]] Station and it might possibly be that Christie reached his decision while painting this watercolour. As Eleanor Christie explains in the article \"His lifelong interest in landscape painting was more than just a joy and relaxation from the more serious business of mural painting and teaching; it answered a deep-felt need to re-affirm his belief in the solid reality of the world and its ability to regenerate itself and beauty\".<ref name=\"Allan-p39\" />\nThe battalion were clearing pockets of SS troops from the [[Sachsenwald]] Forest when [[VE Day]] arrived. In his youth he had become interested in religion and evangelical movements, after the war he remained religious but was never affiliated to any specific church. Eleanor Christie recalled that some years after the war Christie began painting a huge war mural some 12 foot long at their home depicting the field of battle with dead and dying soldiers painted in grim grey and brown colours. Possibly this may have been the road which the battalion marched through in the [[Falaise Gap]] episode, a road which had been literally bulldozed clear of the smashed remnants of the retreating German army to allow the Allied troops to advance. Eleanor Christie states that Fyffe spoke little of the war and this was his only attempt at a direct catharsis. He destroyed the painting shortly after completion.\n\n==Glasgow School of Art==\nChristie attended the [[Glasgow School of Art]] from 1946 to 1951, He loved the art of the early [[Italian Renaissance]], especially [[Giotto]] and [[Piero Della Francesca]] and after two years of general studies began to specialise studying [[stained glass]] and [[mural painting]] under [[Walter Pritchard]] (Christie exhibited a mural stained glass window at the Edinburgh Festival titled ''The Last Supper'' in 1951). Biographer Ted Allan was, like Christie, a veteran who enrolled at the school immediately after the war and in his article in ''The Covenanter'' describes the difficulties of these older men and women returning to study after years of war and the hardship of living on a tight government grant as he describes Christie living on a diet of [[kippers]] and getting into trouble with his landlady through his attempts to brew beer in his bedsit and even grow tobacco in his window box\".<ref>Allan, Ted, [http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1bjk0/TheCovenanter2003Edi/resources/35.htm \"Fyffe Christie: Scottish Soldier and Artist\"], \"The Covenanter\", 2003, p35</ref> Teacher Walter Pritchard was a respected figure in mural art and Christie worked with him in the painting of a large mural behind the altar of St. Francis-in-the-East church in [[Bridgeton, Glasgow|Bridgeton]], Glasgow. Christie also worked with Pritchard and an unknown artist whose surname was Roy painting a series of murals in the Curler's Tavern in [[Byres Road]] in the West End of Glasgow, Christie's contribution being a mural on the English folk song [[Widicome Fair]] while Pritchard took the [[Robert Burns]] poem [[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam O' Shanter]] for his subject and Roy created caricatures of historic figures using the bar's regulars including the Scottish Poet (Pritchard's lodger at the time) [[Hugh McDiarmid]], as models. Christie had a lifelong love of music and this would be a recurring theme in his work. In the 1970s these murals were threatened as new owners intended to remove them but this was successfully opposed by the Glasgow [[People's Palace, Glasgow|People's Palace]] Museum curators [[Elspeth King]] and Michael Donnelly. Some years later during another refurbishment, and with Elspeth King no longer at the People's Palace Museum, the murals were thrown out. Only Roy's murals survived, being salvaged from a rubbish skip by one of the barmaids, and these now hang on the walls of the [[Kelvinside Hillhead Parish Church, Glasgow#History|\u00d2ran M\u00f3r]] Bar, formerly a church and now a bar and arts venue in Glasgow's Byres Road\".<ref>Gray,Alasdair,personal communication, October,2010, p1</ref>\n\nChristie won the Newbery Medal in 1950 for the most distinguished student of his year. In 1951 father George Christie died and Fyffe undertook a postgraduate's study year and a six-month travelling scholarship to France, Germany and Italy. He had also begun teaching evening classes at the School of Art and there he met his wife, student Eleanor Munro, the couple marrying on Fyffe's return to Scotland in 1952.\n\n==''Christ Feeding the People''==\n\nIn the post-diploma year of 1950-1951 Christie painted the [[mural]] of ''Christ Feeding the People'' for the [[Iona Community]]. The work was commissioned by the dynamic founder and leader of the community the Reverend [[George MacLeod]] who had been responsible for the reconstruction of [[Iona Abbey]] on the Island of [[Iona]] off Scotland's west coast. The 35 foot long mural painted on eight panels covered the walls of the community centre cafe on Clyde Street, Glasgow which was open to the public as a community centre and to provide cheap and nutritious food to visitors and the city's homeless. Christie depicted the huge scene of an interior with ordinary folk, men returning from work and women baking and bathing children, while the figure of Jesus was placed at the centre of the activity and the act of the breaking of bread placed at the heart of community life. As Christine Jardine wrote in an article in the Scottish Herald Newspaper the work was intended to be in accord with the community's declared aim of \"rebuilding the common life\"<ref>Jardine, C., \"A desire to be kept in the picture\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 1 February 2011</ref> and it arguably achieved this by depicting ordinary community life in a contemporary Glasgow setting. Robert Radford wrote \"The allegorical references to the labour of men and women and to community and service are, in essence, biblical but also universal, expressing the potential for transcendence of normality which this work shares with Spencer's [[Sandham Memorial Chapel|Memorial Chapel at Burghclere]]\".<ref>Buckman, D., Jordanova, L. and Radford, R., Nature and Humanity, the work of Fyffe Christie: 1918-1979, (Sansom & Company, Bristol, 2004), p.2</ref> \n\nThe mural became familiar to the generations of Glaswegians who frequented the centre. Shortly after completion of the work the newspaper ''The Glasgow Herald'' ran an article on mural art in Scotland and the work of the muralists [[Walter Pritchard]], William Crosbie and Christie, the \"powerful simplicity\" of Christie's Iona Community mural drawing particular praise.<ref>Buckman, D., Jordanova, L. and Radford, R., Nature and Humanity, the work of Fyffe Christie: 1918-1979, (Sansom & Company, Bristol, 2004), p.7</ref> Christie preferred to paint directly onto the wall but the Iona Community specified that the commission was completed on panels. Fortunately this allowed the work to be saved following the closure and demolition of the centre. The mural was exhibited at an Edinburgh gallery shortly after the closure and then disappeared for two decades, whereabouts unknown, before being mysteriously rediscovered and put up for sale by an English art dealer in the 1990s. Disputes over ownership arose and there was some enthusiastic coverage in the Scottish press, ''The Scotsman'' and ''Glasgow Herald'' newspapers, regarding the significance of the mural and the need for it to return to Scotland<ref>Jardine,C.,\"A desire to be kept in the picture\", The Herald [Glasgow] Scotland, 21 Sep. 1998</ref><ref>Henry,C.,\"An oasis, a wonder wall\", The Herald [Glasgow] Scotland, 31 May 1999, p.2</ref> Despite this, and despite an offer by the art dealer to sell it to a Scottish buyer for only the cost of his purchase and restoration, and despite its being put on exhibition at the [[St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art]] in Glasgow the City Council showed little enthusiasm and argued that there was nowhere in the city suitable for displaying such a large mural. the head of Curatorial Service Mr. Mark O'Neill stating that \"We would not be able to guarantee it a permanent display...It is so big that it would take up an entire picture gallery and you would have to remove, for example, all of the Scottish colourists.\".<ref>Jardine, C., \"Bid to retrieve mural of Christ meeting Clydesiders\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 31 Aug 1998</ref>\nThe work was subsequently sold to an unknown private buyer at auction in London in 1998, its current location is unknown.\n\n==The Glasgow Murals==\n[[File:Fyffechristiemarystuart.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Detail [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], Glasgow University Union]]\nIn the austere economic years following the Second World War Christie found that although his work was admired it was difficult for him to obtain commissions. In his Bibliographical Essay David Buckman wrote \"Christie's contribution to the resurgence of secular and religious Scottish mural painting at this time has never been adequately acknowledged\".<ref>Buckman, D., Jordanova, L. and Radford, R., Nature and Humanity, the work of Fyffe Christie: 1918-1979, (Sansom & Company, Bristol, 2004),p.7</ref> Of the few murals he did paint many are gone, some have been painted over while one painted in collaboration with artist Gavin Alston at Crossmyloof Ice Rink in Glasgow was lost when the building was demolished. A mural illustrating Children's Nursery Rhymes for a house in [[Bearsden]], Glasgow, was lost when the house was taken over by tenants from the American Consulate. A few works do still survive such as the ''Children's Games'' mural, 1955, in Hillhead Primary School, Glasgow which was composed of four or five panels each approximately 4&nbsp;ft X 5&nbsp;ft\n\nAt the James Bridie Memorial Room in [[Glasgow University Union]] there is the mural based on the song ''West End Perk'' by [[James Bridie]] the playwright and poet. The work was originally sited near the entrance to the [[Citizens Theatre]] in Glasgow before being purchased by the James Bridie Trust for the Memorial Room. Christie used a muted palette which perhaps give his murals a [[tapestry]] like quality, although today this can be partly due to the fading of the original colours. He also avoided painting monumental works with larger than life figures, preferring his painting to remain human in scale.\n\nChristie's interest in music and piping continued and he became a member of the Glasgow University Piping Society. This led to a commission to paint panels illustrating the history of the piobaireachd or [[pibroch]] for the Glasgow College of Piping which was completed in 1954. The panel illustrates many well known pipe tunes or [[Ceol Mor]] such as ''Lament for Donald Ban'' and ''The Big Spree''. Later the mural was stored away and forgotten for many years when the College moved to a new address in Glasgow's Otago Street. In recent years it was re-discovered and when the College was re-built the mural was properly restored and is now on display in the meeting room where it can be viewed by appointment.\n\nFyffe and Eleanor Christie worked as art teachers in Glasgow (Eleanor studying sculpture) until 1957 when they decided that they had to leave for better job prospects in England.\n\n==London==\nChristie taught at the Gurney School for Disadvantaged Children in [[Ilford]] before moving to the Park Modern School (later the Barking Abbey School) where he taught until retirement.\n\nThe couple lived in the Ilford suburb of Seven Kings before moving to a smaller flat in [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]]. During his career at the school he produced around 200 informal portrait drawings of his pupils mostly executed between 1964 and 1974 which later featured in exhibitions, the 'Children and Childhood Exhibition' at the City Arts Centre in Edinburgh, 1989; and at the Bethnal Green Museum of Childhood Exhibition in 1991. In her essay 'Children, Poses, Portraiture' Ludmilla Jordanova wrote \"I believe these portraits are profoundly moving because they generate in viewers an immediate and vivid sense of the ambiguities of teenage years, of being in between.\".<ref>Buckman, D., Jordanova, L. and Radford, R., Nature and Humanity, the work of Fyffe Christie: 1918-1979, (Sansom & Company, Bristol, 2004), p.38</ref>\n\nNot long after their move to London a solo exhibition was held at Foley's Gallery in Charing Cross Road in 1958 which attracted favourable reviews in the ''Glasgow Herald''. At this time Christie was attempting to adapt the mural genre into something suitable for a domestic interior and this took the form of \"portable murals\", draught screens with illustrations including \"[[The Lady of Shalott]]\" and \"[[The Magic Flute]]\".<ref name=\"Glasgow Herald\">Glasgow Herald Newspaper: 20 August 1958, page 6, column G</ref> Christie was not however a self-publicist and the ascendancy of abstract art in the latter 20th century led to fewer commissions for figurative artists.\nHe did continue to paint murals when the opportunity arose, often undertaking the work for the cost of the paint and allowing his teaching to subsidize his art. One commission was of ''A Modern Pilgrim's Progress'' a 12 foot by 27 foot 'Duresco' painted directly onto the walls of the Little Ilford Baptist Tabernacle in London in 1961, Christie carrying out this work voluntarily. This mural has survived although the colours have faded badly through sunlight and it is in need of restoration.\n\nChristie was perhaps influenced by various styles and painters in the various genres he worked with, Robert Radford has drawn some comparisons with his oil painting and the work of [[Giorgione]], [[C\u00e9zanne]] and [[Matisse]] for example, and his [[Still Life]] painting with the [[Scottish Colourists]] [[Francis Cadell (artist)|F.C.B. Cadell]] and [[Samuel Peploe]].<ref>Buckman, D., Jordanova, L. and Radford, R., Nature and Humanity, the work of Fyffe Christie:1918-1979, (Sansom & Company, Bristol, 2004), pp 2-3</ref> His murals with their stylised figures have often been compared with those of the English artist [[Stanley Spencer]], in an article in The Glasgow Herald in 1958 on Christie's exhibition one London Art Critic noted \"In these panel works the influence of Stanley Spencer can be traced, but with a symbolism of Christie's own\"<ref name=\"Glasgow Herald\" /> Spencer was born and grew up in the village of [[Cookham]], just north of London and not far from Christie's birthplace of [[Bushey]]. Spencer, like Christie, experienced war, the First World War, serving like Christie in a medical capacity with the Royal Army Medical Corp. Robert Radford described Christie's service as stretcher bearer as \" work which demands an encounter with the limits of human experience from the preciousness and frailty of the body to the courage and vitality of the spirit subjected to the extremities of danger and pain. It is significant how closely this matched the experience of Stanley Spencer in the previous Great War, an artist whose example must have informed at some level Christie's subsequent work as a muralist.\".<ref>Buckman, D., Jordanova, L. and Radford, R., Nature and Humanity, the work of Fyffe Christie: 1918-1979, (Sansom & Company, Bristol, 2004), p.1</ref> But Spencer was of an earlier generation and any further links are tentative, for instance the Scottish artist and draughtsman [[Muirhead Bone]] was a close friend of Spencer while Bone's brother William was Christie's drawing teacher at the Glasgow School of Art. The stylised mules painted at the top of Christie's Pilgrim's Progress mural also bear a notable resemblance to those painted by Spencer in his mural at the [[Sandham Memorial Chapel]] and his painting ''Travoys with Wounded Soldiers Arriving at a Dressing Station at Smol'', Macedonia of 1919, held by the [[Imperial War Museum]] and it might possibly be argued that this minor feature in the Ilford mural is a passing homage to Spencer.\n\nOther commissions included a Nativity Scene at St. Margaret's [[Stamford Rivers]], England, and ''The Seasons'' painted circa 1970 for the Lennard Day Hospital, [[Bromley Hospital]], in Kent, England (relocated to the Canada Wing of the [[Orpington Hospital]]). Christie also painted the battle of the [[Greeks]] and [[Troy|Trojans]] before the walls of [[Troy]] directly onto the wall for the Spartan Cafe in Bromley in Kent which was probably painted over when new owners took over.\nChristie's lifelong love of landscape painting also continued unabated, painting with his wife Eleanor on holidays in Scotland (particularly the Ayrshire and Argyle coast), England, France and Italy. As he worked he would attract crowds ohildren who would ask \"'How much would that picture cost?' On getting his dry, invariable retort to that question - '\u00a3100' their amazement was unvarying.\".<ref>Buckman, D., Jordanova, L. and Radford, R., Nature and Humanity, the work of Fyffe Christie: 1918-1979, (Sansom & Company, Bristol, 2004), p.8</ref> Children would also be fascinated when the [[ambidextrous]] Christie would paint with both hands.\n\nIn the 1970s Christie attended Saturday morning life classes at the [[Sir John Cass School of Art]] and in 1973 he began a series of around 40 large figure compositions of nudes, oil on canvas, often painting in the living room of the small flat in which he and wife Eleanor lived, often working under artificial light. Other works included still lives. Many of these are now owned by several galleries in England, only one is held by a Scottish Gallery, The Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum but it is not on display at present.\n\nFyffe Christie suffered a heart attack in 1976 and considered retiring to allow himself to devote his final years to painting, but he could not afford such a move and continued working. He died on 6 March 1979, the same year in which he and Eleanor held a joint show locally at Woodlands Art Gallery in London.\n\n==Posthumous Exhibitions==\nPosthumous shows included:\nExhibition of Drawings at the Glasgow School of Art.\nCyril Gerber Fine Art, Glasgow, 1988.\nFairhurst Gallery, Fulham, London, 1988.\n'Children & Childhood' Exhibition, City Art Centre, Edinburgh, 1989.\nExhibition of his schoolchildren drawings was held at the Bethnal Green Museum of Childhood, 1991.\nExhibition, Blackheath Concert Halls.\nExhibition, Norwich.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Buckman, D., Jordanova, L. and Radford, R., ''Nature and Humanity, the work of Fyffe Christie: 1918-1979'', (Sansom & Company, Bristol, 2004)\n* Glasgow Herald Newspaper: 11 November 1950, page 6, column A\n* Glasgow Herald Newspaper: 17 August 1951, page 6, column D\n* Glasgow Herald Newspaper: 20 August 1958, page 6, column G\n* Glasgow Herald Newspaper: 14 March 1979, page 6, column G\n* Smith, K., \"Tangled Web\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 3 December 2009\n* Jardine, C., \"Dispute over missing mural\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 26 Aug 1998\n* Jardine, C., \"Bid to retrieve mural of Christ meeting Clydesiders\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 31 Aug 1998\n* Jardine, C., \"A desire to be kept in the picture\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 1 February 2011\n* Brocklehurst, J.C., \"Mural belongs to Glasgow\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 9 Sep 1998\n* Jardine, C., \"Scottish bids for mural encouraged\" & \"A desire to be kept in the picture\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 21 Sep 1998\n* Dalton, A., \"Iona group wants to buy back mural\", The Scotsman Newspaper, 21 Aug 1998\n* Tinning, W., \"Iona mural may be lost to Scotland\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 14 May 1999\n* Henry, C., \"An oasis, a wonder wall\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 31 May 1999\n* The Scotsman: 21 August 1998, Alastair Dalton\n* Glasgow Bulletin Newspaper:\n* Allan, Ted, [http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1bjk0/TheCovenanter2003Edi/resources/35.htm/ \"Fyffe Christie: Scottish Soldier and Artist\"], \"The Covenanter\", 2003, pp35\u201339\n\n==External links==\n* [http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1bjk0/TheCovenanter2003Edi/resources/index.htm?referrerUrl=http%3A//www.yudu.com/item/details/71148/The-Covenanter---2003-Edition/ The Covenanter Magazine article page 35]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090302132811/http://www.cameronians.com/history.htm Cameronian website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091123102831/http://www.wartimememoriesproject.com/ww2/allied/cameronians.php Cameronian website]\n* [http://www.ourglasgowstory.com/story.php?sid=81/ Walter Pritchard]\n* [http://www.college-of-piping.co.uk/acatalog/info.html/Glasgow College of Piping Website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120420045609/http://www.bridgetonstfrancis.org/Pages/default.aspx St. Francis in the East Website]\n* [https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/the-words-that-i-used-to-know/id401824944/ West End Perk Song]\n* [http://www.pbase.com/taggart51/image/90240490/ The Stanford Church Mural]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Christie, Fyffe}}\n[[Category:1918 births]]\n[[Category:1979 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century English painters]]\n[[Category:English male painters]]\n[[Category:Scottish muralists]]\n[[Category:English muralists]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the Glasgow School of Art]]\n[[Category:Anglo-Scots]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|British artist}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2013}}\n{{Use British English|date=December 2013}}\n'''Fyffe William George Christie''' (2 February 1918, [[Bushey]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]], \u2013 6 March 1979) British [[figurative artist]] and [[mural]] painter.\n\n==Early years==\nFyffe Christie was born in the English town of [[Bushey]], Hertfordshire, in 1918.  His father was a Scot, George Fyffe Christie, a freelance commercial artist who illustrated children's books and cartoon postcards featuring children and animals. As a commercial artist father George may have been attracted to Bushey by its closeness to London and the town's reputation as an artistic colony as previously established by the artist [[Hubert Herkomer]].  It was there that George met and married an English girl, Fyffe's mother Ethel.\n\nAround 1930 Ethel died and at the age of twelve Fyffe moved back to Glasgow with his father and younger brother Andrew to live together with his uncle David and aunt Tiz in Glasgow's [[Pollokshields]] district.  Fyffe Christie suffered from severe [[dyslexia]] and was unable to read until diagnosed at the age of twelve, after which he became a keen scholar and avid reader, including [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].  He was also fully [[ambidextrous]] and struggled as the teachers of that time insisted he write only with his right hand. Two years later tragedy struck again as brother Andrew died.  Fyffe showed an early interest in drawing and painting, and developed a lifelong love of music, particularly classical music and opera, while he himself learned to play the [[bagpipes]].  Father George Christie had some commercial success with his creation of the cartoon strip ''Scottikin O' the Bulletin'' in the popular Glasgow newspaper the ''Bulletin'' but he struggled financially through the years of the recession however and so he discouraged Fyffe's artistic ambition.  Due to economic hardship Christie had to leave school early, despite his academic abilities and George Christie insisted his son begin a career in the more secure legal profession.  After two years working in a lawyers office Fyffe left and began an apprenticeship arranged for him as a lithographic draughtsman but he remained unhappy and frustrated with his life.\n\n==World War Two==\nAt the outset of The Second World War Fyffe Christie joined the [[British Army]] as a [[bagpipes|bagpiper]] (pipers at that time also served a dual role as [[stretcher bearer]]s while in the field), attending a course at the [[Army School of Piping]] in [[Edinburgh Castle]].  He was then posted to the 9th battalion the [[Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)|Cameronians]] (Scottish Rifles).  The battalion was in continuous action after landing at [[Arromanches]] following the [[D-Day]] landings, 6 June 1944 and suffered heavy casualties as they fought for eleven months from [[Normandy]] into Northern Germany.  In his article 'Fyffe Christie: Scottish Soldier and Artist' in the regimental magazine 'The Covenanter' friend Dr.Ted Allan CBE described how the battalion received its baptism of fire on its first attack to take the village of [[Haut Du Bosq]] when its casualties totalled 120 killed and wounded, followed by bitter fighting in the orchards around [[Eterville]] while resisting a German counterattack.  Christie witnessed the most horrific scenes as the battalion marched down a road in the [[Falaise Gap]] following the virtual annihilation of the retreating German Army.\n\nDuring rest periods Christie began to sketch and paint the scenes and landscapes around him in ink and watercolours as a refuge and way of coping with what he witnessed in combat, Allan states that Christie maintained that this was \"not just art but a defence mechanism\".<ref>Allan, Ted, [http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1bjk0/TheCovenanter2003Edi/resources/35.htm \"Fyffe Christie: Scottish Soldier and Artist\"], \"The Covenanter\", 2003, p38</ref>   These sketches and watercolours are now held in the Cameronian's Regimental Museum, the [[National Museum of Scotland]] in Edinburgh, and the [[Imperial War Museum]], London; while the majority are with the [[Second World War Experience Centre]] in Leeds.  Many of the young soldiers he served with were [[illiterate]] and, having overcome his own childhood [[dyslexia]], Christie often helped his comrades by reading their letters from home and writing their replies for them.  Ted Allan described how pipers were popular figures during the liberation of towns as the battalion fought its way towards Germany, the men of the regiment forming a particular and lasting bond with the people of [[Tilburg]] in the Netherlands in this way.<ref name=\"Allan-p37\">Allan, Ted, [http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1bjk0/TheCovenanter2003Edi/resources/35.htm \"Fyffe Christie: Scottish Soldier and Artist\"], \"The Covenanter\", 2003, p37</ref>  Shortly afterwards the men of 9th battalion were involved in the battle for [[Moylands]] Woods, a particularly brutal fight and prelude to the advance into Germany itself.  The battalion had frequently been opposed by elite German parachute units (often of the 7th Division) but as the fighting progressed the men found themselves increasingly facing fanatical [[Hitler Youth]] and the old men of the [[Volksturm]].  In the advance into Germany there was also the discovery of [[Concentration Camps]], yet Allan also refers to an incident in which humanity took precedence and a surrender was arranged in the middle of a battle on the basis that the Cameronian stretcher bearers entered an uncleared [[minefield]] in order to extricate the German wounded\".<ref name=\"Allan-p37\" />  \n\nIn the same Covenanter article Fyffe's wife Eleanor Christie explained that his father George's opposition to an artistic career lessened as he was greatly impressed by the quality of the sketches and watercolours Fyffe was sending home from the front while at the same time Fyffe was also greatly encouraged by his comrades who admired his paintings.  Fyffe later told her that it was in the last days of the war, as he stood in a bombed out German railway station gazing out at the landscape that he made the final decision to become an artist\".<ref name=\"Allan-p39\">Allan, Ted, [http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1bjk0/TheCovenanter2003Edi/resources/35.htm \"Fyffe Christie: Scottish Soldier and Artist\"], \"The Covenanter\", 2003, p39</ref>  The Imperial War Museum now owns one of Christie's watercolours of [[L\u00fcbeck]] Station and it might possibly be that Christie reached his decision while painting this watercolour.  As Eleanor Christie explains in the article \"His lifelong interest in landscape painting was more than just a joy and relaxation from the more serious business of mural painting and teaching; it answered a deep-felt need to re-affirm his belief in the solid reality of the world and its ability to regenerate itself and beauty\".<ref name=\"Allan-p39\" />\nThe battalion were clearing pockets of SS troops from the [[Sachsenwald]] Forest when [[VE Day]] arrived.  In his youth he had become interested in religion and evangelical movements, after the war he remained religious but was never affiliated to any specific church.  Eleanor Christie recalled that some years after the war Christie began painting a huge war mural some 12 foot long at their home depicting the field of battle with dead and dying soldiers painted in grim grey and brown colours.  Possibly this may have been the road which the battalion marched through in the [[Falaise Gap]] episode, a road which had been literally bulldozed clear of the smashed remnants of the retreating German army to allow the Allied troops to advance.  Eleanor Christie states that Fyffe spoke little of the war and this was his only attempt at a direct catharsis.  He destroyed the painting shortly after completion.\n\n==Glasgow School of Art==\nChristie attended the [[Glasgow School of Art]] from 1946 to 1951,  He loved the art of the early [[Italian Renaissance]], especially [[Giotto]] and [[Piero Della Francesca]] and after two years of general studies began to specialise studying [[stained glass]] and [[mural painting]] under [[Walter Pritchard]] (Christie exhibited a mural stained glass window at the Edinburgh Festival titled ''The Last Supper'' in 1951).  Biographer Ted Allan was, like Christie, a veteran who enrolled at the school immediately after the war and in his article in ''The Covenanter'' describes the difficulties of these older men and women returning to study after years of war and the hardship of living on a tight government grant as he describes Christie living on a diet of [[kippers]] and getting into trouble with his landlady through his attempts to brew beer in his bedsit and even grow tobacco in his window box\".<ref>Allan, Ted, [http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1bjk0/TheCovenanter2003Edi/resources/35.htm \"Fyffe Christie: Scottish Soldier and Artist\"], \"The Covenanter\", 2003, p35</ref>  Teacher Walter Pritchard was a respected figure in mural art and Christie worked with him in the painting of a large mural behind the altar of St. Francis-in-the-East church in [[Bridgeton, Glasgow|Bridgeton]], Glasgow.  Christie also worked with Pritchard and an unknown artist whose surname was Roy painting a series of murals in the Curler's Tavern in [[Byres Road]] in the West End of Glasgow, Christie's contribution being a mural on the English folk song [[Widicome Fair]] while Pritchard took the [[Robert Burns]] poem [[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam O' Shanter]] for his subject and Roy created caricatures of historic figures using the bar's regulars including the Scottish Poet (Pritchard's lodger at the time) [[Hugh McDiarmid]], as models.  Christie had a lifelong love of music and this would be a recurring theme in his work.  In the 1970s these murals were threatened as new owners intended to remove them but this was successfully opposed by the Glasgow [[People's Palace, Glasgow|People's Palace]] Museum curators [[Elspeth King]] and Michael Donnelly.  Some years later during another refurbishment, and with Elspeth King no longer at the People's Palace Museum, the murals were thrown out.  Only Roy's murals survived, being salvaged from a rubbish skip by one of the barmaids, and these now hang on the walls of the [[Kelvinside Hillhead Parish Church, Glasgow#History|\u00d2ran M\u00f3r]] Bar, formerly a church and now a bar and arts venue in Glasgow's Byres Road\".<ref>Gray,Alasdair,personal communication, October,2010, p1</ref>\n\nChristie won the [[Newbery Medal]] in 1950 for the most distinguished student of his year.  In 1951 father George Christie died and Fyffe undertook a postgraduate's study year and a six-month travelling scholarship to France, Germany and Italy.  He had also begun teaching evening classes at the School of Art and there he met his wife, student Eleanor Munro, the couple marrying on Fyffe's return to Scotland in 1952.\n\n==Christ Feeding the People==\n\nIn the post-diploma year of 1950-1 Christie painted the [[mural]] of ''Christ Feeding the People'' for the [[Iona Community]].  The work was commissioned by the dynamic founder and leader of the community the Reverend [[George MacLeod]] who had been responsible for the reconstruction of [[Iona Abbey]] on the Island of [[Iona]] off Scotland's west coast.  The 35 foot long mural painted on eight panels covered the walls of the community centre cafe on Clyde Street, Glasgow which was open to the public as a community centre and to provide cheap and nutritious food to visitors and the city's homeless. Christie depicted the huge scene of an interior with ordinary folk, men returning from work and women baking and bathing children, while the figure of Jesus was placed at the centre of the activity and the act of the breaking of bread placed at the heart of community life.  As Christine Jardine wrote in an article in the Scottish Herald Newspaper the work was intended to be in accord with the community's declared aim of \"rebuilding the common life\"<ref>Jardine, C., \"A desire to be kept in the picture\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 1 February 2011</ref> and it arguably achieved this by depicting ordinary community life in a contemporary Glasgow setting.  Robert Radford wrote \"The allegorical references to the labour of men and women and to community and service are, in essence, biblical but also universal, expressing the potential for transcendence of normality which this work shares with Spencer's [[Sandham Memorial Chapel|Memorial Chapel at Burghclere]]\".<ref>Buckman, D., Jordanova, L. and Radford, R., Nature and Humanity, the work of Fyffe Christie: 1918-1979, (Sansom & Company, Bristol, 2004), p.2</ref>  The mural became familiar to the generations of Glaswegians who frequented the centre. Shortly after completion of the work the newspaper ''The Glasgow Herald'' ran an article on mural art in Scotland and the work of the muralists [[Walter Pritchard]], William Crosbie and Christie, the \"powerful simplicity\" of Christie's Iona Community mural drawing particular praise.<ref>Buckman, D., Jordanova, L. and Radford, R., Nature and Humanity, the work of Fyffe Christie: 1918-1979, (Sansom & Company, Bristol, 2004), p.7</ref>  Christie preferred to paint directly onto the wall but the Iona Community specified that the commission was completed on panels.  Fortunately this allowed the work to be saved following the closure and demolition of the centre.  The mural was exhibited at an Edinburgh gallery shortly after the closure and then disappeared for two decades, whereabouts unknown, before being mysteriously rediscovered and put up for sale by an English art dealer in the 1990s.  Disputes over ownership arose and there was some enthusiastic coverage in the Scottish press, ''The Scotsman'' and ''Glasgow Herald'' newspapers, regarding the significance of the mural and the need for it to return to Scotland<ref>Jardine,C.,\"A desire to be kept in the picture\", The Herald [Glasgow] Scotland, 21 Sep. 1998</ref><ref>Henry,C.,\"An oasis, a wonder wall\", The Herald [Glasgow] Scotland, 31 May 1999, p.2</ref>  Despite this, and despite an offer by the art dealer to sell it to a Scottish buyer for only the cost of his purchase and restoration, and despite its being put on exhibition at the [[St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art]] in Glasgow the City Council showed little enthusiasm and argued that there was nowhere in the city suitable for displaying such a large mural.  the head of Curatorial Service Mr. Mark O'Neill stating that \"We would not be able to guarantee it a permanent display...It is so big that it would take up an entire picture gallery and you would have to remove, for example, all of the Scottish colourists.\".<ref>Jardine, C., \"Bid to retrieve mural of Christ meeting Clydesiders\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 31 Aug 1998</ref>\nThe work was subsequently sold to an unknown private buyer at auction in London in 1998, its current location is unknown.\n\n==The Glasgow Murals==\n[[File:Fyffechristiemarystuart.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Detail [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], Glasgow University Union]]\nIn the austere economic years following the Second World War Christie found that although his work was admired it was difficult for him to obtain commissions.  In his Bibliographical Essay David Buckman wrote \"Christie's contribution to the resurgence of secular and religious Scottish mural painting at this time has never been adequately acknowledged\".<ref>Buckman, D., Jordanova, L. and Radford, R., Nature and Humanity, the work of Fyffe Christie: 1918-1979, (Sansom & Company, Bristol, 2004),p.7</ref> Of the few murals he did paint many are gone, some have been painted over while one painted in collaboration with artist Gavin Alston at Crossmyloof Ice Rink in Glasgow was lost when the building was demolished.  A mural illustrating Children's Nursery Rhymes for a house in [[Bearsden]], Glasgow, was lost when the house was taken over by tenants from the American Consulate.  A few works do still survive such as the ''Children's Games'' mural, 1955, in Hillhead Primary School, Glasgow which was composed of four or five panels each approximately 4&nbsp;ft X 5&nbsp;ft\n\nAt the James Bridie Memorial Room in [[Glasgow University Union]] there is the mural based on the song ''West End Perk'' by [[James Bridie]] the playwright and poet.  The work was originally sited near the entrance to the [[Citizens Theatre]] in Glasgow before being purchased by the James Bridie Trust for the Memorial Room.  Christie used a muted palette which perhaps give his murals a [[tapestry]] like quality, although today this can be partly due to the fading of the original colours.  He also avoided painting monumental works with larger than life figures, preferring his painting to remain human in scale.\n\nChristie's interest in music and piping continued and he became a member of the Glasgow University Piping Society.  This led to a commission to paint panels illustrating the history of the piobaireachd or [[pibroch]] for the Glasgow College of Piping which was completed in 1954.  The panel illustrates many well known pipe tunes or [[Ceol Mor]] such as ''Lament for Donald Ban'' and ''The Big Spree''.  Later the mural was stored away and forgotten for many years when the College moved to a new address in Glasgow's Otago Street. In recent years it was re-discovered and when the College was re-built the mural was properly restored and is now on display in the meeting room where it can be viewed by appointment.\n\nFyffe and Eleanor Christie worked as art teachers in Glasgow (Eleanor studying sculpture) until 1957 when they decided that they had to leave for better job prospects in England.\n\n==London==\nChristie taught at the Gurney School for Disadvantaged Children in [[Ilford]] before moving to the Park Modern School (later the Barking Abbey School) where he taught until retirement.\n\nThe couple lived in the Ilford suburb of Seven Kings before moving to a smaller flat in [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]].  During his career at the school he produced around 200 informal portrait drawings of his pupils mostly executed between 1964 and 1974 which later featured in exhibitions, the 'Children and Childhood Exhibition' at the City Arts Centre in Edinburgh, 1989; and at the Bethnal Green Museum of Childhood Exhibition in 1991.  In her essay 'Children, Poses, Portraiture' Ludmilla Jordanova wrote \"I believe these portraits are profoundly moving because they generate in viewers an immediate and vivid sense of the ambiguities of teenage years, of being in between.\".<ref>Buckman, D., Jordanova, L. and Radford, R., Nature and Humanity, the work of Fyffe Christie: 1918-1979, (Sansom & Company, Bristol, 2004), p.38</ref>\n\nNot long after their move to London a solo exhibition was held at Foley's Gallery in Charing Cross Road in 1958 which attracted favourable reviews in the ''Glasgow Herald''.  At this time Christie was attempting to adapt the mural genre into something suitable for a domestic interior and this took the form of \"portable murals\", draught screens with illustrations including \"[[The Lady of Shalott]]\" and \"[[The Magic Flute]]\".<ref name=\"Glasgow Herald\">Glasgow Herald Newspaper: 20 August 1958, page 6, column G</ref>  Christie was not however a self-publicist and the ascendancy of abstract art in the latter 20th century led to fewer commissions for figurative artists.\nHe did continue to paint murals when the opportunity arose, often undertaking the work for the cost of the paint and allowing his teaching to subsidize his art.  One commission was of ''A Modern Pilgrim's Progress'' a 12 foot by 27 foot 'Duresco' painted directly onto the walls of the Little Ilford Baptist Tabernacle in London in 1961, Christie carrying out this work voluntarily.  This mural has survived although the colours have faded badly through sunlight and it is in need of restoration.\n\nChristie was perhaps influenced by various styles and painters in the various genres he worked with, Robert Radford has drawn some comparisons with his oil painting and the work of [[Giorgione]], [[C\u00e9zanne]] and [[Matisse]] for example, and his [[Still Life]] painting with the [[Scottish Colourists]] [[Francis Cadell (artist)|F.C.B. Cadell]] and [[Samuel Peploe]].<ref>Buckman, D., Jordanova, L. and Radford, R., Nature and Humanity, the work of Fyffe Christie:1918-1979, (Sansom & Company, Bristol, 2004), pp 2-3</ref>  His murals with their stylised figures have often been compared with those of the English artist [[Stanley Spencer]], in an article in The Glasgow Herald in 1958 on Christie's exhibition one London Art Critic noted \"In these panel works the influence of Stanley Spencer can be traced, but with a symbolism of Christie's own\"<ref name=\"Glasgow Herald\" />  Spencer was born and grew up in the village of [[Cookham]], just north of London and not far from Christie's birthplace of [[Bushey]].  Spencer, like Christie, experienced war, the First World War, serving like Christie in a medical capacity with the Royal Army Medical Corp.  Robert Radford described Christie's service as stretcher bearer as \" work which demands an encounter with the limits of human experience from the preciousness and frailty of the body to the courage and vitality of the spirit subjected to the extremities of danger and pain.  It is significant how closely this matched the experience of Stanley Spencer in the previous Great War, an artist whose example must have informed at some level Christie's subsequent work as a muralist.\".<ref>Buckman, D., Jordanova, L. and Radford, R., Nature and Humanity, the work of Fyffe Christie: 1918-1979, (Sansom & Company, Bristol, 2004), p.1</ref>    But Spencer was of an earlier generation and any further links are tentative, for instance the Scottish artist and draughtsman [[Muirhead Bone]] was a close friend of Spencer while Bone's brother William was Christie's drawing teacher at the Glasgow School of Art.  The stylised mules painted at the top of Christie's Pilgrim's Progress mural also bear a notable resemblance to those painted by Spencer in his mural at the [[Sandham Memorial Chapel]] and his painting ''Travoys with Wounded Soldiers Arriving at a Dressing Station at Smol'', Macedonia of 1919, held by the [[Imperial War Museum]] and it might possibly be argued that this minor feature in the Ilford mural is a passing homage to Spencer.\n\nOther commissions included a Nativity Scene at St. Margaret's [[Stamford Rivers]], England, and ''The Seasons'' painted circa 1970 for the Lennard Day Hospital, [[Bromley Hospital]], in Kent, England (relocated to the Canada Wing of the [[Orpington Hospital]]).  Christie also painted the battle of the [[Greeks]] and [[Troy|Trojans]] before the walls of [[Troy]] directly onto the wall for the Spartan Cafe in Bromley in Kent which was probably painted over when new owners took over.\nChristie's lifelong love of landscape painting also continued unabated, painting with his wife Eleanor on holidays in Scotland (particularly the Ayrshire and Argyle coast), England, France and Italy.  As he worked he would attract crowds ohildren who would ask \"'How much would that picture cost?' On getting his dry, invariable retort to that question - '\u00a3100' their amazement was unvarying.\".<ref>Buckman, D., Jordanova, L. and Radford, R., Nature and Humanity, the work of Fyffe Christie: 1918-1979, (Sansom & Company, Bristol, 2004), p.8</ref>  Children would also be fascinated when the [[ambidextrous]] Christie would paint with both hands.\n\nIn the 1970s Christie attended Saturday morning life classes at the [[Sir John Cass School of Art]] and in 1973 he began a series of around 40 large figure compositions of nudes, oil on canvas, often painting in the living room of the small flat in which he and wife Eleanor lived, often working under artificial light.  Other works included still lives.  Many of these are now owned by several galleries in England, only one is held by a Scottish Gallery, The Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum but it is not on display at present.\n\nFyffe Christie suffered a heart attack in 1976 and considered retiring to allow himself to devote his final years to painting, but he could not afford such a move and continued working.  He died on 6 March 1979, the same year in which he and Eleanor held a joint show locally at Woodlands Art Gallery in London.\n\n==Posthumous Exhibitions==\nPosthumous shows included:\nExhibition of Drawings at the Glasgow School of Art.\nCyril Gerber Fine Art, Glasgow, 1988.\nFairhurst Gallery, Fulham, London, 1988.\n'Children & Childhood' Exhibition, City Art Centre, Edinburgh, 1989.\nExhibition of his schoolchildren drawings was held at the Bethnal Green Museum of Childhood, 1991.\nExhibition, Blackheath Concert Halls.\nExhibition, Norwich.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Buckman, D., Jordanova, L. and Radford, R., ''Nature and Humanity, the work of Fyffe Christie: 1918-1979'', (Sansom & Company, Bristol, 2004)\n* Glasgow Herald Newspaper: 11 November 1950, page 6, column A\n* Glasgow Herald Newspaper: 17 August 1951, page 6, column D\n* Glasgow Herald Newspaper: 20 August 1958, page 6, column G\n* Glasgow Herald Newspaper: 14 March 1979, page 6, column G\n* Smith, K., \"Tangled Web\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 3 December 2009\n* Jardine, C., \"Dispute over missing mural\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 26 Aug 1998\n* Jardine, C., \"Bid to retrieve mural of Christ meeting Clydesiders\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 31 Aug 1998\n* Jardine, C., \"A desire to be kept in the picture\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 1 February 2011\n* Brocklehurst, J.C., \"Mural belongs to Glasgow\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 9 Sep 1998\n* Jardine, C., \"Scottish bids for mural encouraged\" & \"A desire to be kept in the picture\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 21 Sep 1998\n* Dalton, A., \"Iona group wants to buy back mural\", The Scotsman Newspaper, 21 Aug 1998\n* Tinning, W., \"Iona mural may be lost to Scotland\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 14 May 1999\n* Henry, C., \"An oasis, a wonder wall\", Scottish [Glasgow] Herald Newspaper, 31 May 1999\n* The Scotsman: 21 August 1998, Alastair Dalton\n* Glasgow Bulletin Newspaper:\n* Allan, Ted, [http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1bjk0/TheCovenanter2003Edi/resources/35.htm/ \"Fyffe Christie: Scottish Soldier and Artist\"], \"The Covenanter\", 2003, pp35\u201339\n\n==External links==\n* [http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1bjk0/TheCovenanter2003Edi/resources/index.htm?referrerUrl=http%3A//www.yudu.com/item/details/71148/The-Covenanter---2003-Edition/ The Covenanter Magazine article page 35]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090302132811/http://www.cameronians.com/history.htm Cameronian website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091123102831/http://www.wartimememoriesproject.com/ww2/allied/cameronians.php Cameronian website]\n* [http://www.ourglasgowstory.com/story.php?sid=81/ Walter Pritchard]\n* [http://www.college-of-piping.co.uk/acatalog/info.html/Glasgow College of Piping Website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120420045609/http://www.bridgetonstfrancis.org/Pages/default.aspx St. Francis in the East Website]\n* [https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/the-words-that-i-used-to-know/id401824944/ West End Perk Song]\n* [http://www.pbase.com/taggart51/image/90240490/ The Stanford Church Mural]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Christie, Fyffe}}\n[[Category:1918 births]]\n[[Category:1979 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century English painters]]\n[[Category:English male painters]]\n[[Category:Scottish muralists]]\n[[Category:English muralists]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the Glasgow School of Art]]\n[[Category:Anglo-Scots]]\n", "name_user": "Eddie891", "label": "safe", "comment": "ce, add lede", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyffe_Christie"}
