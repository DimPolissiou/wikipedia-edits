Harsh reparations exacted by the Prussians after the war resulted in the loss of the French regions of [[Alsace]] (keeping the [[Territoire de Belfort]]) and [[Lorraine]] (the northeastern part, i.e. present-day [[Moselle (department)|department of Moselle]]), social upheaval, and the establishment of the [[Paris Commune]].  The early governments of the Third Republic considered re-establishing the monarchy, but disagreement as to the nature of that monarchy and the rightful occupant of the throne could not be resolved. Consequently, the Third Republic, originally envisioned as a [[provisional government]], instead became the permanent form of government of France.\n\nThe [[French Constitutional Laws of 1875]] defined the composition of the Third Republic. It consisted of a [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] and a [[Senate of France|Senate]] to form the legislative branch of government and a [[List of Presidents of France#French Third Republic (1870\u20131940)|president]] to serve as head of state.  Calls for the re-establishment of the monarchy dominated the tenures of the first two presidents, [[Adolphe Thiers]] and [[Patrice de MacMahon]], but growing support for the republican form of government among the French populace and a series of republican presidents in the 1880s gradually quashed prospects of a monarchical restoration.\n\nThe Third Republic established many [[French colonial empire|French colonial possessions]], including [[French Indochina]], [[French Madagascar]], [[French Polynesia]], and large territories in [[French West Africa|West Africa]] during the [[Scramble for Africa]], all of them acquired during the last two decades of the 19th century.  The early years of the 20th century were dominated by the [[Democratic Republican Alliance]], which was originally conceived as a [[centre-left]] political alliance, but over time became the main [[centre-right]] party.  The period from the start of [[World War I]] to the late 1930s featured sharply polarized politics, between the Democratic Republican Alliance and the [[Radical Party (France)|Radicals]].  The government fell less than a year after the outbreak of World War II, when German forces [[occupied France|occupied much of France]], and was replaced by the rival governments of [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s [[Free France]] (''La France libre'') and [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]]'s [[Vichy France]] (''L'\u00c9tat fran\u00e7ais'').\n\n[[Adolphe Thiers]] called republicanism in the 1870s \"the form of government that divides France least\"; however, politics under the Third Republic were sharply polarized. On the left stood Reformist France, heir to the [[French Revolution]]. On the right stood conservative France, rooted in the peasantry, the Roman Catholic Church and the army.<ref>{{cite book |first=Maurice |last=Larkin |authorlink=Maurice Larkin |title=Religion, Politics and Preferment in France since 1890: La Belle Epoque and its Legacy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-521-52270-0 |page=3 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=7rPaeTm4lm4C |page=3 }} }}</ref> In spite of France's sharply divided electorate and persistent attempts to overthrow it, the Third Republic endured for seventy years, which as of 2020 makes it the longest lasting system of government in France since the collapse of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'' in 1789.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Franco-Prussian War}}\n[[File:Maurice Neumont, War is the National Industry of Prussia, 1917, Cornell CUL PJM 1185 01.jpg|thumb|A French propaganda poster from 1917 is captioned with an 18th-century quote: \"Even in 1788, Mirabeau was saying that War is the National Industry of Prussia.\"]]\nThe [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870\u20131871 resulted in the defeat of France and the overthrow of Emperor [[Napoleon III]] and his [[Second French Empire]]. After Napoleon's capture by the Prussians at the [[Battle of Sedan]] (1 September 1870), Parisian deputies led by L\u00e9on Gambetta established the [[Government of National Defence]] as a provisional government on 4 September 1870. The deputies then selected General [[Louis-Jules Trochu]] to serve as its president. This first government of the Third Republic ruled during the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]] (19 September 1870 \u2013 28 January 1871). As Paris was cut off from the rest of unoccupied France, the Minister of War, [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]], who succeeded in leaving Paris in a hot air balloon, established the headquarters of the provisional republican government in the city of [[Tours]] on the Loire river.\n\nAfter the French surrender in January 1871, the provisional Government of National Defence disbanded, and national elections were called with the aim of creating a new French government. [[Franco-Prussian War#Prussian reaction and withdrawal|French territories occupied by Prussia]] at this time did not participate. The resulting conservative National Assembly elected [[Adolphe Thiers]] as head of a provisional government, nominally (\"head of the executive branch of the Republic pending a decision on the institutions of France\"). Due to the revolutionary and left-wing political climate that prevailed in the Parisian population, the right-wing government chose the royal palace of [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]] as its headquarters.\n\nThe new government negotiated a peace settlement with the newly proclaimed [[German Empire]]: the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]] signed on 10 May 1871. To prompt the Prussians to leave France, the government passed a variety of financial laws, such as the controversial ''Law of Maturities'', to pay reparations. In Paris, resentment against the government built and from late March \u2013 May 1871, Paris workers and [[National Guard (France)|National Guards]] revolted and established the [[Paris Commune]], which maintained a radical left-wing regime for two months until its bloody suppression by the Thiers government in May 1871. The following repression of the {{lang|fr|[[communards]]}} would have disastrous consequences for the [[labour movement]].\n\n===Parliamentary monarchy===\n[[File:France Chambre des deputes 1871.png|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Composition of the national Assembly \u2013 1871]]\n[[February 1871 French legislative election|The French legislative election of 1871]], held in the aftermath of the collapse of the regime of Napoleon III, resulted in a monarchist majority in the French National Assembly that was favourable to making a peace agreement with Prussia. The \"[[Legitimists]]\" in the National Assembly supported the candidacy of a descendant of King [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], the last monarch from the senior line of the [[Bourbon Dynasty]], to assume the French throne: his grandson [[Henri, Comte de Chambord]], alias \"Henry V.\" The [[Orl\u00e9anist]]s supported a descendant of King [[Louis Philippe I]], the cousin of Charles X who replaced him as the French monarch in 1830: his grandson [[Louis-Philippe, Comte de Paris]]. The [[Bonapartists]] were marginalized due to the defeat of Napol\u00e9on III and were unable to advance the candidacy of any member of his family, the [[Bonaparte family]]. Legitimists and Orl\u00e9anists came to a compromise, eventually, whereby the childless Comte de Chambord would be recognised as king, with the Comte de Paris recognised as his heir. Consequently, in 1871 the throne was offered to the Comte de Chambord.<ref>D.W. Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870\u20131939)'' (1940) pp 77\u2013105.</ref>\n\nChambord believed the restored monarchy had to eliminate all traces of the Revolution (including most famously the [[Flag of France|Tricolor flag]]) in order to restore the unity between the monarchy and the nation, which the revolution had sundered apart. Compromise on this was impossible if the nation were to be made whole again.  The general population, however, was unwilling to abandon the Tricolor flag. Monarchists therefore resigned themselves to wait for the death of the aging, childless Chambord, when the throne could be offered to his more liberal heir, the Comte de Paris. A \"temporary\" republican government was therefore established. Chambord lived on until 1883, but by that time, enthusiasm for a monarchy had faded, and as a result the Comte de Paris was never offered the French throne.<ref>Steven D. Kale, \"The Monarchy According to the King: The Ideological Content of the 'Drapeau Blanc,' 1871\u20131873.\" ''French History'' (1988) 2#4 pp 399\u2013426.</ref>\n\n===''Ordre Moral'' government===\n{{further|16 May 1877 crisis}}\n[[File:La Basilica del sagrado Coraz\u00f3n de Montmartre.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, Paris|Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Basilica]] was built as a symbol of the ''Ordre Moral''.]]\n\nFollowing the French surrender to Prussia in January 1871, concluding the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the transitional [[Government of National Defense]] established a new seat of government at [[Versailles]] due to the encirclement of Paris by Prussian forces. New representatives were elected in February of that year, constituting the government which would come to evolve into the Third Republic. These representatives \u2013 predominantly conservative republicans \u2013 enacted a series of legislation which prompted resistance and outcry from radical and leftist elements of the republican movement. In Paris, a series of public altercations broke out between the Versailles-aligned Parisian government and the city's radical socialists. The radicals ultimately rejected the authority of Versailles, responding with the foundation of the [[Paris Commune]] in March.\n\nThe principles underpinning the Commune were viewed as morally degenerate by French conservatives at large while the government at Versailles sought to maintain the tenuous post-war stability which it had established. In May, the regular [[French Armed Forces]], under the command of [[Patrice de MacMahon]] and the Versailles government, marched on Paris and succeeded in dismantling the Commune during would become known as [[Paris Commune#\"Bloody Week\"|The Bloody Week]]. The term '''''ordre moral''''' (\"moral order\") subsequently came to be applied to the budding Third Republic due to the perceived restoration of conservative policies and values following the suppression of the Commune.<ref>D.W. Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870\u20131939)'' (1940) pp 106\u201313.</ref>\n\nDe MacMahon, his popularity having been bolstered by his response to the Commune, was later elected [[President of France|President of the Republic]] in May 1873 and would hold the office until January 1879. A staunch [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] conservative with [[Legitimists|Legitimist]] sympathies and a noted mistrust of secularists, de MacMahon grew to be increasingly at odds with the French parliament as liberal and secular republicans gained legislative majority during his presidency.\n\nIn February 1875, a series of parliamentary acts established the [[French Constitutional Laws of 1875|constitutional laws of the new republic]]. At its head was a President of the Republic. A two-chamber parliament consisting of a directly-elected [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] and an indirectly-elected [[Senate of France|Senate]] was created, along with a ministry under the President of the Council ([[prime minister]]), who was nominally answerable to both the President of the Republic and the legislature. Throughout the 1870s, the issue of whether a monarchy should replace or oversee the republic dominated public debate.\n\n[[File:1887 Bettanier Der Schwarze Fleck anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|In France, schoolchildren were taught not to forget the lost regions of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], which were coloured in black on maps.]]\nThe elections of 1876 demonstrated a high degree of public support for the increasingly anti-monarchist direction of the republican movement. A decisive Republican majority was elected to the Chamber of Deputies while the monarchist majority in the Senate was maintained by only one seat. President de MacMahon responded in May 1877, attempting to quell the Republicans' rising popularity and limit their political influence through a series of actions which would become known in France as [[16 May 1877 crisis|''le seize Mai'']].\n\nOn 16 May 1877, de MacMahon forced the resignation of [[Moderate Republicans (France)|Moderate Republican]] prime minister [[Jules Simon]] and appointed the [[Orl\u00e9anist]] [[Albert, duc de Broglie|Albert de Broglie]] to the office. When the Chamber of Deputies expressed outrage at the appointment, believing the transition of authority to be illegitimate and refusing to cooperate with either de MacMahon or de Broglie, de MacMahon dissolved the Chamber and called for a new general election to be held the following October. De MacMahon was subsequently accused by Republicans and republican sympathizers of attempting to stage a constitutional coup d'\u00e9tat, a claim which he publicly denied.\n\nThe October elections again brought a Republican majority to the Chamber of Deputies, further affirming public opinion. The Republicans would go on to gain a majority in the Senate by January 1879, establishing dominance in both houses and effectively ending the potential for a monarchist restoration. De MacMahon himself resigned on 30 January 1879 to be succeeded by the [[Opportunist Republicans|moderate]] [[Jules Gr\u00e9vy]].<ref>Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870\u20131939)'' (1940) pp 127\u201343.</ref>\n\n===Opportunist Republicans===\n{{further|Opportunist Republicans}}\n\nFollowing the 16 May crisis in 1877, [[Legitimist]]s were pushed out of power, and the Republic was finally governed by republicans referred to as [[Opportunist Republicans]] for their support of moderate social and political changes in order to establish the new regime firmly. The [[Jules Ferry laws]] that made [[public education]] free, mandatory, and secular (''[[la\u00efcit\u00e9|la\u0457que]]''), were voted in 1881 and 1882, one of the first signs of the expanding civic powers of the Republic. From that time onward, public education was no longer under the exclusive control of the Catholic congregations.<ref>D.W. Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870\u20131939)'' (1940) pp 144\u201379.</ref>\n\nTo discourage French monarchism as a serious political force, the [[French Crown Jewels]] were broken up and sold in 1885. Only a few crowns, their precious gems replaced by coloured glass, were kept.\n\n===Boulanger crisis===\n[[File:Georges_Ernest_Boulanger_by_Atelier_Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Georges Ernest Boulanger]], nicknamed G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Revanche]]\nIn 1889, the Republic was rocked by a sudden political crisis precipitated by General [[Georges Boulanger]]. An enormously popular general, he won a series of elections in which he would resign his seat in the Chamber of Deputies and run again in another district. At the apogee of his popularity in January 1889, he posed the threat of a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and the establishment of a dictatorship. With his base of support in the working districts of Paris and other cities, plus rural traditionalist Catholics and royalists, he promoted an aggressive nationalism aimed against Germany.  The elections of September 1889 marked a decisive defeat for the Boulangists.  They were defeated by the changes in the electoral laws that prevented Boulanger from running in multiple constituencies; by the government's aggressive opposition; and by the absence of the general himself, who placed himself in self-imposed exile to be with his mistress.  The fall of Boulanger severely undermined the political strength of the conservative and royalist elements within France; they would not recover their strength until 1940.<ref>Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870\u20131939)'' (1940) pp 183\u2013213.</ref>\n\nRevisionist scholars have argued that the Boulangist movement more often represented elements of the radical left rather than the extreme right. Their work is part of an emerging consensus that France's radical right was formed in part during the Dreyfus era by men who had been Boulangist partisans of the radical left a decade earlier.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Mazgaj |title=The Origins of the French Radical Right: A Historiographical Essay |journal=[[French Historical Studies]] |year=1987 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=287\u2013315 |jstor=286267 |doi=10.2307/286267 }}</ref>\n\n===Panama scandal===\n{{main|Panama scandals}}\nThe [[Panama scandals]] of 1892 involved the enormous cost of a failed attempt to build the [[Panama Canal]]. Due to disease, death, inefficiency, and widespread corruption, the [[Panama Canal Company]] handling the massive project went bankrupt, with millions in losses. It is regarded as the largest monetary corruption scandal of the 19th century. Close to a billion francs were lost when the French government took bribes to keep quiet about the Panama Canal Company's financial troubles.<ref>David McCullough, ''The path between the seas: the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870\u20131914'' (2001) pp 45\u2013242.</ref>\n\n===The welfare state and public health===\n{{cns|The state had a smaller role in France than in Germany before the First World War.

Because it was so threatening to so many interests, the proposal was debated and postponed for 20 years before becoming law in 1902. Implementation finally came when the government realized that contagious diseases had a national security impact in weakening military recruits, and keeping the population growth rate well below Germany's.<ref>Ann-Louise Shapiro, \"Private Rights, Public Interest, and Professional Jurisdiction: The French Public Health Law of 1902.\" ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' 54.1 (1980): 4+</ref> Another theory put forth is that the low rate of French population growth, relative to Germany, was due to a lower French birth rate perhaps due to the provision under French Revolutionary law that land must be divided up among all the sons (or a large compensation paid) \u2014 this led peasants to not want more than one son.

The conduct of the affair has become a modern and universal symbol of injustice. It remains one of the most striking examples of a complex miscarriage of justice in which a central role was played by the press and public opinion.  At issue was blatant [[anti-Semitism]] as practiced by the [[French Army]] and defended by conservatives and Catholic traditionalists against secular centre-left, left and republican forces, including most Jews.

[[Alfred Dreyfus]]]]\n\nThe affair began in November 1894 with the conviction for treason of Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a young French artillery officer of [[History of Jews in Alsace|Alsatian Jewish descent]]. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for communicating French military secrets to the German Embassy in Paris and sent to the penal colony at [[Devil's Island]] in [[French Guiana]] (nicknamed ''la guillotine s\u00e8che'', the dry guillotine), where he spent almost five years.\n\nTwo years later, evidence came to light that identified a French Army major named [[Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy]] as the real spy. After high-ranking military officials suppressed the new evidence, a military court unanimously acquitted Esterhazy. In response, the Army brought up additional charges against Dreyfus based on false documents. Word of the military court's attempts to frame Dreyfus began to spread, chiefly owing to the polemic ''[[J'accuse (letter)|J'accuse]]'', a vehement open letter published in a Paris newspaper in January 1898 by the notable writer [[\u00c9mile Zola]]. Activists put pressure on the government to re-open the case.\n\nIn 1899, Dreyfus was returned to France for another trial. The intense political and judicial scandal that ensued divided French society between those who supported Dreyfus (now called \"Dreyfusards\"), such as [[Anatole France]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]], and those who condemned him (the anti-Dreyfusards), such as [[\u00c9douard Drumont]], the director and publisher of the anti-Semitic newspaper ''[[La Libre Parole]]''. The new trial resulted in another conviction and a 10-year sentence, but Dreyfus was given a pardon and set free. Eventually all the accusations against him were demonstrated to be baseless, and in 1906, Dreyfus was exonerated and re-instated as a major in the French Army.\n\nFrom 1894 to 1906, the scandal divided France deeply and lastingly into two opposing camps: the pro-Army \"anti-Dreyfusards\" composed of conservatives, Catholic traditionalists and monarchists who generally lost the initiative to the anti-clerical, pro-republican \"Dreyfusards\", with strong support from intellectuals and teachers. It embittered French politics and facilitated the increasing influence of radical politicians on both sides of the political spectrum.\n\n==Social history==\n{{main|Belle \u00c9poque}}\n\n===Newspapers===\nThe democratic political structure was supported by the proliferation of politicized newspapers. The circulation of the daily press in Paris went from 1 million in 1870 to 5 million in 1910; it later reached 6 million in 1939.  Advertising grew rapidly, providing a steady financial basis for publishing, but it did not cover all of the costs involved and had to be supplemented by secret subsidies from commercial interests that wanted favourable reporting.  A new liberal press law of 1881 abandoned the restrictive practices that had been typical for a century. [[R. Hoe & Company|High-speed rotary Hoe presses]], introduced in the 1860s, facilitated quick turnaround time and cheaper publication.  New types of popular newspapers, especially ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'', reached an audience more interested in diverse entertainment and gossip than hard news.  It captured a quarter of the Parisian market and forced the rest to lower their prices.  The main dailies employed their own journalists who competed for news flashes. All newspapers relied upon the Agence Havas (now [[Agence France-Presse]]), a telegraphic news service with a network of reporters and contracts with [[Reuters]] to provide world service.

They also took payments for favourable notices in news articles of commercial products. Sometimes, a newspaper would blackmail a business by threatening to publish unfavorable information unless the business immediately started advertising in the paper. Foreign governments, especially Russia and Turkey, secretly paid the press hundreds of thousands of francs a year to guarantee favourable coverage of the bonds it was selling in Paris. When the real news was bad about Russia, as during its 1905 Revolution or during its war with Japan, it raised the ante to millions.  During the World War, newspapers became more of a propaganda agency on behalf of the war effort and avoided critical commentary.  They seldom reported the achievements of the Allies, crediting all the good news to the French army.  In a sentence, the newspapers were not independent champions of the truth, but secretly paid advertisements for banking.<ref>See {{cite book |first=Theodore |last=Zeldin |authorlink=Theodore Zeldin |title=France: 1848\u20131945 |year=1977 |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=978-0-19-822125-8 |chapter=Newspapers and corruption |pages=492\u2013573 }} Also, pp 522\u201324 on foreign subsidies.</ref>\n\nThe World War ended a golden era for the press. Their younger staff members were drafted, and male replacements could not be found (female journalists were not considered suitable.) Rail transportation was rationed and less paper and ink came in, and fewer copies could be shipped out. Inflation raised the price of newsprint, which was always in short supply. The cover price went up, circulation fell and many of the 242 dailies published outside Paris closed down. The government set up the Interministerial Press Commission to supervise the press closely. A separate agency imposed tight censorship that led to blank spaces where news reports or editorials were disallowed. The dailies sometimes were limited to only two pages instead of the usual four, leading one satirical paper to try to report the war news in the same spirit:\n: War News.

By 1939, its circulation was over 1.7 million, double that of its nearest rival the tabloid ''[[Le Petit Parisien]]''. In addition to its daily paper, ''Paris Soir'' sponsored a highly successful women's magazine [[Marie Claire|''Marie-Claire'']].

The French clergy and bishops were closely associated with the monarchists and many of its hierarchy were from noble families. Republicans were based in the [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] middle class, who saw the Church's alliance with the monarchists as a political threat to republicanism, and a threat to the modern spirit of progress. The republicans detested the Church for its political and class affiliations; for them, the Church represented the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]], a time in French history most republicans hoped was long behind them.  The republicans were strengthened by Protestant and Jewish support.  Numerous laws were passed to weaken the Catholic Church. In 1879, priests were excluded from the administrative committees of hospitals and boards of charity; in 1880, new measures were directed against the religious congregations; from 1880 to 1890 came the substitution of lay women for nuns in many hospitals; in 1882, the [[Jules Ferry laws|Ferry school laws]] were passed.

Religious instruction in all schools was forbidden, and religious orders were forbidden to teach in them. Funds were appropriated from religious schools to build more state schools.

Membership was open to everyone, not just Catholics. It sought to gather all the \"honest people\" and to be the melting pot sought by Leo XIII where Catholics and moderate Republicans would unite to support a policy of tolerance and social progress. Its motto summarized its program: \"Liberty for all; equality before the law; better conditions for the workers.\" However, the \"old republicans\" were few, and it did not manage to regroup all Catholics, as it was shunned by monarchists, Christian democrats, and [[Integrist]]s. In the end, it recruited mostly among the liberal-Catholics ([[Jacques Piou]]) and the Social Catholics ([[Albert de Mun]]).  The ALP was drawn into battle from its very beginnings (its first steps coincided with the beginning of the Combes ministry and its anticlerical combat policy), as religious matters were at the heart of its preoccupations. It defended the Church in the name of liberty and common law. Fiercely fought by the ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]'', the movement declined from 1908, when it lost the support of Rome.

France rebuilt its Army, emphasizing modernization in such features as new artillery, and after 1905 invested heavily in military aircraft. Most important in restoring prestige was a strong emphasis on the growing French Empire, which brought prestige, despite large financial costs.  Very few French families settled in the colonies, and they were too poor in natural resources and trade to significantly benefit the overall economy. Nevertheless, they were second in size only to the British Empire, provided prestige in world affairs, and gave an opportunity for Catholics (under heavy attack by the Republicans in Parliament) to devote their energies to spread French culture and civilization worldwide.  An extremely expensive investment in building the Panama Canal was a total failure, in terms of money, many deaths by disease, and political scandal.<ref>Jean-Marie Mayeur and Madeleine Reb\u00e9rioux, ''The Third Republic from its Origins to the Great War, 1871\u20131914'' (1984), pp 155\u201361, 168\u201369, 272\u201378.</ref> Bismarck was fired in 1890, and after that German foreign policy was confused and misdirected. For example, Berlin broke its close ties with St. Petersburg, allowing the French to enter through heavy financial investment, and a Paris-St Petersburg military alliance that proved essential and durable. Germany feuded with Britain, which encouraged London and Paris to drop their grievances over Egypt and Africa, reaching a compromise whereby the French recognized British primacy in Egypt, while Britain recognized French primacy in Morocco.  This enabled Britain and France to move closer together, finally achieving an informal military relationship after 1904.<ref>Jeremy D.

Permanent professional diplomats and bureaucrats had developed their own traditions of how to operate at the [[Quai d'Orsay]] (where the Foreign Ministry was located), and their style changed little from generation to generation.<ref>J.F.V. Keiger, ''France and the World since 1870'' (2001) pp 25 \u2013 47.</ref> Most of the diplomats came from high status aristocratic families.  Although France was one of the few republics in Europe, its diplomats mingled smoothly with the aristocratic representatives at the royal courts.  Prime ministers and leading politicians generally paid little attention to foreign affairs, allowing a handful of senior men to control policy.  In the decades before the First World War they dominated the embassies in the 10 major countries where France had an ambassador (elsewhere, they sent lower-ranking ministers).  They included [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]], the foreign minister from 1898 to 1905; [[Paul Cambon]], in London, 1890\u20131920; [[Jean Jules Jusserand|Jules Jusserand]], in Washington from 1902 to 1924; and Camille Barr\u00e8re, in Rome from 1897 to 1924.  In terms of foreign policy, there was general agreement about the need for high protective tariffs, which kept agricultural prices high.  After the defeat by the Germans, there was a strong widespread anti-German sentiment focused on revanchism and regaining Alsace and Lorraine.  The Empire was a matter of great pride, and service as administrators, soldiers and missionaries was a high status occupation.<ref>Felix Gilbert, David Clay Large, ''The End of the European Era: 1890 to the Present'' (2002) p 64-65.</ref>\nFrench foreign policy from 1871 to 1914 showed a dramatic transformation from a humiliated power with no friends and not much of an empire in 1871, to the centerpiece of the European alliance system in 1914, with a flourishing colonial empire that was second in size only to Great Britain. Although religion was a hotly contested matter in domestic politics, the Catholic Church made missionary work and church building a specialty in the colonies. Most Frenchmen ignored foreign policy; its issues were a low priority in politics.<ref>Gordon Wright, ''France in Modern Times'' (5th ed 1995) pp 288\u201399.</ref><ref>Martin S. Alexander and J. F.

Under heavy pressure the French withdrew, securing Anglo-Egyptian control over the area. The status quo was recognised by an agreement between the two states acknowledging British control over Egypt, while France became the dominant power in [[Morocco]], but France suffered a humiliating defeat overall.<ref>D.W.

Conflicts with China over Indochina climaxed during the [[Sino-French War]] (1884\u20131885).

France secured an alliance with the [[Russian Empire]] in 1894 after diplomatic talks between Germany and Russia had failed to produce any working agreement. The [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] served as the cornerstone of French foreign policy until 1917. A further link with Russia was provided by vast French investments and loans before 1914. In 1904, French foreign minister [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]] negotiated the ''[[Entente Cordiale]]'' with [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]], the British Foreign Secretary, an agreement that ended a long period of Anglo-French tensions and hostility. The ''Entente Cordiale'', which functioned as an informal Anglo-French alliance, was further strengthened by the [[First Moroccan Crisis|First]] and [[Agadir Crisis|Second Moroccan crises]] of 1905 and 1911, and by secret military and naval staff talks. Delcass\u00e9's rapprochement with Britain was controversial in France as [[Anglophobia]] was prominent around the start of the 20th century, sentiments that had been much reinforced by the [[Fashoda Incident]] of 1898, in which Britain and France had almost gone to war, and by the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], in which French public opinion was very much on the side of Britain's enemies.<ref>T.

In Algeria, land held by rich [[settler]]s rose from 1,600,000 hectares in 1890 to 2,700,000 hectares in 1940; combined with similar operations in Morocco and Tunisia, the result was that North African agriculture became one of the most efficient in the world. Metropolitan France was a captive market, so large landowners could borrow large sums in Paris to modernize agricultural techniques with tractors and mechanized equipment. The result was a dramatic increase in the export of wheat, corn, peaches, and olive oil.

Nevertheless, by 1918 France was producing more munitions and artillery than its allies, while supplying virtually all of the heavy equipment needed by the arriving American army. (The Americans left their heavy weapons at home in order to use the available transports to send as many soldiers as possible.) Building on foundations laid in the early months of the war, the Ministry of War matched production to the operational and tactical needs of the army, with an emphasis on meeting the insatiable demands for artillery.

The Bloc was supported by business and finance and was friendly toward the army and the Church. Its main goals were revenge against Germany, economic prosperity for French business and stability in domestic affairs.

Anti-democratic groups, such as the [[French Communist Party|Communists]] on the left and royalists on the right, played relatively minor roles.\n\nThe flow of [[World War I reparations|reparations from Germany]] played a central role in strengthening French finances.

The horrible devastation of the war, including the death of 1.5&nbsp;million French soldiers, the devastation of much of the steel and coal regions, and the long-term costs for veterans, were always remembered. France demanded that Germany assume many of the costs incurred from the war through annual reparation payments. French foreign and security policy used the balance of power and alliance politics to compel Germany to comply with its obligations under the Treaty of Versailles.  the problem was that the United States and Britain rejected a defensive alliance. Potential allies in Eastern Europe, such as Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia were too weak to confront Germany. Russia had been the long term French ally in the East, but now it was controlled by deeply distrusted in Paris.  France's transition to a more conciliatory policy in 1924 was a response to pressure from Britain and the United States, as well as to French weakness.<ref>Jacques N\u00e9r\u00e9, ''The foreign policy of France from 1914 to 1945'' (1975) pp 11\u201399.</ref>\n\nFrance enthusiastically joined the [[League of Nations]] in 1919, but felt betrayed by President [[Woodrow Wilson]], when his promises that the United States would sign a defence treaty with France and join the League were [[league of Nations#Global representation|rejected by the United States Congress]]. The main goal of French foreign policy was to preserve French power and neutralize the threat posed by Germany. When Germany fell behind in reparations payments in 1923, France [[occupation of Ruhr|seized the industrialized Ruhr region]]. The British Labour Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]], who viewed reparations as impossible to pay successfully, pressured French Premier [[\u00c9douard Herriot]] into a series of concessions to Germany. In total, France received \u00a31600&nbsp;million from Germany before reparations ended in 1932, but France had to pay war debts to the United States, and thus the net gain was only about \u00a3600&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite book |first=Maurice |last=Larkin |title=France since the Popular Front: Government and People, 1936\u20131986 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-19-873034-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/francesincepopul0000lark/page/9 9] |url=https://archive.org/details/francesincepopul0000lark/page/9 }}</ref>\n\nFrance tried to create a web of defensive treaties against Germany with Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.

When [[Stalin]] told French Communists to collaborate with others on the left in 1934, a [[popular front]] was made possible with an emphasis on unity against fascism. In 1936, the Socialists and the Radicals formed a coalition, with Communist support, to complete it.<ref>{{cite book |first=Julian |last=Jackson |title=The Popular Front in France: Defending Democracy, 1934\u201338 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-521-31252-3 }}</ref>\n\nThe Popular Front's narrow victory in the [[1936 French legislative election|elections of the spring of 1936]] brought to power a government headed by the Socialists in alliance with the Radicals.  The Communists supported its domestic policies, but did not take any seats in the cabinet.  The prime minister was L\u00e9on Blum, a technocratic socialist who avoided making decisions. In two years in office, it focused on labour law changes sought by the trade unions, especially the mandatory [[40-hour work week]], down from 48 hours. All workers were given a two-week [[paid vacation]]. A [[collective bargaining]] law facilitated union growth; membership soared from 1,000,000 to 5,000,000 in one year, and workers' political strength was enhanced when the Communist and non-Communist unions joined together. The government [[Nationalization#France|nationalized]] the armaments industry and tried to seize control of the [[Bank of France]] in an effort to break the power of the richest 200 families in the country. Farmers received higher prices, and the government purchased surplus wheat, but farmers had to pay higher taxes. Wave after wave of strikes hit French industry in 1936. Wage rates went up 48%, but the work week was cut back by 17%, and the cost of living rose 46%, so there was little real gain to the average worker. The higher prices for French products resulted in a decline in overseas sales, which the government tried to neutralize by [[devaluation|devaluing]] the franc, a measure that led to a reduction in the value of bonds and savings accounts. The overall result was significant damage to the French economy, and a lower [[Economic growth|rate of growth]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Maurice |last=Larkin |title=France since the Popular Front: Government and People, 1936\u20131986 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-19-873034-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/francesincepopul0000lark/page/55 55\u201360] |url=https://archive.org/details/francesincepopul0000lark/page/55 }}</ref>\n\nMost historians judge the Popular Front a failure, although some call it a partial success.

France lost Alsace and most of Lorraine, and had to pay a cash indemnity to the new nation of Germany.\n* 1871: The [[Paris Commune]]. In a formal sense the Paris Commune of 1871 was simply the local authority that exercised power in Paris for two months in the spring of 1871. It was separate from that of the new government under [[Adolphe Thiers]]. The regime came to an end after a bloody suppression by Thiers's government in May 1871.\n* 1872\u201373: After the nation faced the immediate political problems, it needed to establish a permanent form of government. Thiers wanted to base it on the constitutional monarchy of Britain, however he realized France would have to remain republican. In expressing this belief, he violated the Pact of Bordeaux, angering the Monarchists in the Assembly. As a result, he was forced to resign in 1873.\n* 1873: Marshal MacMahon, a conservative Roman Catholic, was made President of the Republic. The Duc de Broglie, an Orleanist, as the prime minister. Unintentionally, the Monarchists had replaced an absolute monarchy by a parliamentary one.\n* Feb 1875: Series of parliamentary Acts established the organic or constitutional laws of the new republic. At its apex was a President of the Republic. A two-chamber parliament was created, along with a ministry under the ''President of the Council'', who was nominally answerable to both the President of the Republic and Parliament.\n* May 1877: with public opinion swinging heavily in favour of a republic, the President of the Republic, [[Patrice MacMahon]], himself a monarchist, made one last desperate attempt to salvage the monarchical cause by dismissing the republic-minded Prime Minister Jules Simon and reappointing the monarchist leader the Duc de Broglie to office. He then dissolved parliament and called a general election. If his hope had been to halt the move towards republicanism, it backfired spectacularly, with the President being accused of having staged a constitutional coup d'\u00e9tat, known as {{lang|fr|le seize Mai}} after the date when it happened.\n* 1879: Republicans returned triumphant, finally killing off the prospect of a restored French monarchy by gaining control of the Senate on 5 January 1879. MacMahon himself resigned on 30 January 1879, leaving a seriously weakened presidency in the shape of Jules Gr\u00e9vy.\n* 1880: The Jesuits and several other religious orders were dissolved, and their members were forbidden to teach in state schools.\n* 1881: Following the 16 May crisis in 1877, Legitimists were pushed out of power, and the Republic was finally governed by republicans, called Opportunist Republicans as they were in favour of moderate changes to firmly establish the new regime. The Jules Ferry laws on free, mandatory and secular public education, voted in 1881 and 1882, were one of the first sign of this republican control of the Republic, as public education was not any more in the exclusive control of the Catholic congregations.\n* 1882: Religious instruction was removed from all state schools. The measures were accompanied by the abolition of chaplains in the armed forces and the removal of nuns from hospitals. Due to the fact that France was mainly Roman Catholic, this was greatly opposed.\n* 1889: The Republic was rocked by the sudden but short-timed Boulanger crisis spawning the rise of the modern intellectual [[\u00c9mile Zola]]. Later, the Panama scandals also were quickly criticized by the press.\n* 1893: Following anarchist [[Auguste Vaillant]]'s bombing at the National Assembly, killing nobody but injuring one, deputies voted the {{lang|fr|lois sc\u00e9l\u00e9rates}} which limited the [[Law on the Freedom of the Press of 29 July 1881|1881 freedom of the press laws]]. The following year, President [[Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] was stabbed to death by Italian anarchist Caserio.\n* 1894: The [[Dreyfus Affair]]: a Jewish artillery officer, [[Alfred Dreyfus]], was arrested on charges relating to conspiracy and espionage. Allegedly, Dreyfus had handed over important military documents discussing the designs of a new French artillery piece to a German military attach\u00e9 named [[Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen|Max von Schwartzkoppen]].\n* 1894: The [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] was formed.\n* 1898: Writer \u00c9mile Zola published an article entitled {{lang|fr|J'Accuse...!}} The article alleged an anti-Semitic conspiracy in the highest ranks of the military to scapegoat Dreyfus, tacitly supported by the government and the Catholic Church. The [[Fashoda Incident]] nearly causes an Anglo-French war.\n* 1901: The Radical-Socialist Party is founded and remained the most important party of the Third Republic starting at the end of the 19th century. The same year, followers of [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]], such as [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]], who became President of the Council in the 1920s, created the Democratic Republican Alliance (ARD), which became the main center-right party after World War I and the parliamentary disappearance of monarchists and Bonapartists.\n* 1904: French foreign minister [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]] negotiated with Lord Lansdowne, the British Foreign Secretary, the {{lang|fr|[[Entente Cordiale]]}} in 1904.\n* 1905: The government introduced the law on the separation of Church and State, heavily supported by Emile Combes, who had been strictly enforcing the 1901 voluntary association law and the 1904 law on religious congregations' freedom of teaching (more than 2,500 private teaching establishments were by then closed by the state, causing bitter opposition from the Catholic and conservative population).\n* 1906: It became apparent that the documents handed over to Schwartzkoppen by Dreyfus in 1894 were a forgery and thus Dreyfus was pardoned after serving 12 years in prison.\n* 1914: After SFIO (French Section of the Workers' International) leader [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]]'s assassination a few days before the German invasion of Belgium, the French socialist movement, as the whole of the Second International, abandoned its antimilitarist positions and joined the national war effort.

Harsh reparations exacted by the Prussians after the war resulted in the loss of the French regions of [[Alsace]] (keeping the [[Territoire de Belfort]]) and [[Lorraine]] (the northeastern part, i.e. present-day [[Moselle (department)|department of Moselle]]), social upheaval, and the establishment of the [[Paris Commune]].  The early governments of the Third Republic considered re-establishing the monarchy, but disagreement as to the nature of that monarchy and the rightful occupant of the throne could not be resolved. Consequently, the Third Republic, originally envisioned as a [[provisional government]], instead became the permanent form of government of France.\n\nThe [[French Constitutional Laws of 1875]] defined the composition of the Third Republic. It consisted of a [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] and a [[Senate of France|Senate]] to form the legislative branch of government and a [[List of Presidents of France#French Third Republic (1870\u20131940)|president]] to serve as head of state.  Calls for the re-establishment of the monarchy dominated the tenures of the first two presidents, [[Adolphe Thiers]] and [[Patrice de MacMahon]], but growing support for the republican form of government among the French populace and a series of republican presidents in the 1880s gradually quashed prospects of a monarchical restoration.\n\nThe Third Republic established many [[French colonial empire|French colonial possessions]], including [[French Indochina]], [[French Madagascar]], [[French Polynesia]], and large territories in [[French West Africa|West Africa]] during the [[Scramble for Africa]], all of them acquired during the last two decades of the 19th century.  The early years of the 20th century were dominated by the [[Democratic Republican Alliance]], which was originally conceived as a [[centre-left]] political alliance, but over time became the main [[centre-right]] party.  The period from the start of [[World War I]] to the late 1930s featured sharply polarized politics, between the Democratic Republican Alliance and the [[Radical Party (France)|Radicals]].  The government fell less than a year after the outbreak of World War II, when German forces [[occupied France|occupied much of France]], and was replaced by the rival governments of [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s [[Free France]] (''La France libre'') and [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]]'s [[Vichy France]] (''L'\u00c9tat fran\u00e7ais'').\n\n[[Adolphe Thiers]] called republicanism in the 1870s \"the form of government that divides France least\"; however, politics under the Third Republic were sharply polarized. On the left stood Reformist France, heir to the [[French Revolution]]. On the right stood conservative France, rooted in the peasantry, the Roman Catholic Church and the army.<ref>{{cite book |first=Maurice |last=Larkin |authorlink=Maurice Larkin |title=Religion, Politics and Preferment in France since 1890: La Belle Epoque and its Legacy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-521-52270-0 |page=3 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=7rPaeTm4lm4C |page=3 }} }}</ref> In spite of France's sharply divided electorate and persistent attempts to overthrow it, the Third Republic endured for seventy years, which as of 2020 makes it the longest lasting system of government in France since the collapse of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'' in 1789.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Franco-Prussian War}}\n[[File:Maurice Neumont, War is the National Industry of Prussia, 1917, Cornell CUL PJM 1185 01.jpg|thumb|A French propaganda poster from 1917 is captioned with an 18th-century quote: \"Even in 1788, Mirabeau was saying that War is the National Industry of Prussia.\"]]\nThe [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870\u20131871 resulted in the defeat of France and the overthrow of Emperor [[Napoleon III]] and his [[Second French Empire]]. After Napoleon's capture by the Prussians at the [[Battle of Sedan]] (1 September 1870), Parisian deputies led by L\u00e9on Gambetta established the [[Government of National Defence]] as a provisional government on 4 September 1870. The deputies then selected General [[Louis-Jules Trochu]] to serve as its president. This first government of the Third Republic ruled during the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]] (19 September 1870 \u2013 28 January 1871). As Paris was cut off from the rest of unoccupied France, the Minister of War, [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]], who succeeded in leaving Paris in a hot air balloon, established the headquarters of the provisional republican government in the city of [[Tours]] on the Loire river.\n\nAfter the French surrender in January 1871, the provisional Government of National Defence disbanded, and national elections were called with the aim of creating a new French government. [[Franco-Prussian War#Prussian reaction and withdrawal|French territories occupied by Prussia]] at this time did not participate. The resulting conservative National Assembly elected [[Adolphe Thiers]] as head of a provisional government, nominally (\"head of the executive branch of the Republic pending a decision on the institutions of France\"). Due to the revolutionary and left-wing political climate that prevailed in the Parisian population, the right-wing government chose the royal palace of [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]] as its headquarters.\n\nThe new government negotiated a peace settlement with the newly proclaimed [[German Empire]]: the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]] signed on 10 May 1871. To prompt the Prussians to leave France, the government passed a variety of financial laws, such as the controversial ''Law of Maturities'', to pay reparations. In Paris, resentment against the government built and from late March \u2013 May 1871, Paris workers and [[National Guard (France)|National Guards]] revolted and established the [[Paris Commune]], which maintained a radical left-wing regime for two months until its bloody suppression by the Thiers government in May 1871. The following repression of the {{lang|fr|[[communards]]}} would have disastrous consequences for the [[labour movement]].\n\n===Parliamentary monarchy===\n[[File:France Chambre des deputes 1871.png|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Composition of the national Assembly \u2013 1871]]\n[[February 1871 French legislative election|The French legislative election of 1871]], held in the aftermath of the collapse of the regime of Napoleon III, resulted in a monarchist majority in the French National Assembly that was favourable to making a peace agreement with Prussia. The \"[[Legitimists]]\" in the National Assembly supported the candidacy of a descendant of King [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], the last monarch from the senior line of the [[Bourbon Dynasty]], to assume the French throne: his grandson [[Henri, Comte de Chambord]], alias \"Henry V.\" The [[Orl\u00e9anist]]s supported a descendant of King [[Louis Philippe I]], the cousin of Charles X who replaced him as the French monarch in 1830: his grandson [[Louis-Philippe, Comte de Paris]]. The [[Bonapartists]] were marginalized due to the defeat of Napol\u00e9on III and were unable to advance the candidacy of any member of his family, the [[Bonaparte family]]. Legitimists and Orl\u00e9anists came to a compromise, eventually, whereby the childless Comte de Chambord would be recognised as king, with the Comte de Paris recognised as his heir. Consequently, in 1871 the throne was offered to the Comte de Chambord.<ref>D.W. Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870-1939)'' (1940) pp 77-105.</ref>\n\nChambord believed the restored monarchy had to eliminate all traces of the Revolution (including most famously the [[Flag of France|Tricolor flag]]) in order to restore the unity between the monarchy and the nation, which the revolution had sundered apart. Compromise on this was impossible if the nation were to be made whole again.  The general population, however, was unwilling to abandon the Tricolor flag. Monarchists therefore resigned themselves to wait for the death of the aging, childless Chambord, when the throne could be offered to his more liberal heir, the Comte de Paris. A \"temporary\" republican government was therefore established. Chambord lived on until 1883, but by that time, enthusiasm for a monarchy had faded, and as a result the Comte de Paris was never offered the French throne.<ref>Steven D. Kale, \"The Monarchy According to the King: The Ideological Content of the 'Drapeau Blanc,' 1871-1873.\" ''French History'' (1988) 2#4 pp 399-426.</ref>\n\n===''Ordre Moral'' government===\n{{further|16 May 1877 crisis}}\n[[File:La Basilica del sagrado Coraz\u00f3n de Montmartre.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, Paris|Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Basilica]] was built as a symbol of the ''Ordre Moral''.]]\n\nFollowing the French surrender to Prussia in January 1871, concluding the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the transitional [[Government of National Defense]] established a new seat of government at [[Versailles]] due to the encirclement of Paris by Prussian forces. New representatives were elected in February of that year, constituting the government which would come to evolve into the Third Republic. These representatives - predominantly conservative republicans - enacted a series of legislation which prompted resistance and outcry from radical and leftist elements of the republican movement. In Paris, a series of public altercations broke out between the Versailles-aligned Parisian government and the city's radical socialists. The radicals ultimately rejected the authority of Versailles, responding with the foundation of the [[Paris Commune]] in March.\n\nThe principles underpinning the Commune were viewed as morally degenerate by French conservatives at large while the government at Versailles sought to maintain the tenuous post-war stability which it had established. In May, the regular [[French Armed Forces]], under the command of [[Patrice de MacMahon]] and the Versailles government, marched on Paris and succeeded in dismantling the Commune during would become known as [[Paris Commune#\"Bloody Week\"|The Bloody Week]]. The term '''''ordre moral''''' (\"moral order\") subsequently came to be applied to the budding Third Republic due to the perceived restoration of conservative policies and values following the suppression of the Commune.<ref>D.W. Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870-1939)'' (1940) pp 106-13.</ref>\n\nDe MacMahon, his popularity having been bolstered by his response to the Commune, was later elected [[President of France|President of the Republic]] in May 1873 and would hold the office until January 1879. A staunch [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] conservative with [[Legitimists|Legitimist]] sympathies and a noted mistrust of secularists, de MacMahon grew to be increasingly at odds with the French parliament as liberal and secular republicans gained legislative majority during his presidency.\n\nIn February 1875, a series of parliamentary acts established the [[French Constitutional Laws of 1875|constitutional laws of the new republic]]. At its head was a President of the Republic. A two-chamber parliament consisting of a directly-elected [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] and an indirectly-elected [[Senate of France|Senate]] was created, along with a ministry under the President of the Council ([[prime minister]]), who was nominally answerable to both the President of the Republic and the legislature. Throughout the 1870s, the issue of whether a monarchy should replace or oversee the republic dominated public debate.\n\n[[File:1887 Bettanier Der Schwarze Fleck anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|In France, schoolchildren were taught not to forget the lost regions of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], which were coloured in black on maps.]]\nThe elections of 1876 demonstrated a high degree of public support for the increasingly anti-monarchist direction of the republican movement. A decisive Republican majority was elected to the Chamber of Deputies while the monarchist majority in the Senate was maintained by only one seat. President de MacMahon responded in May 1877, attempting to quell the Republicans' rising popularity and limit their political influence through a series of actions which would become known in France as [[16 May 1877 crisis|''le seize Mai'']].\n\nOn 16 May 1877, de MacMahon forced the resignation of [[Moderate Republicans (France)|Moderate Republican]] prime minister [[Jules Simon]] and appointed the [[Orl\u00e9anist]] [[Albert, duc de Broglie|Albert de Broglie]] to the office. When the Chamber of Deputies expressed outrage at the appointment, believing the transition of authority to be illegitimate and refusing to cooperate with either de MacMahon or de Broglie, de MacMahon dissolved the Chamber and called for a new general election to be held the following October. De MacMahon was subsequently accused by Republicans and republican sympathizers of attempting to stage a constitutional coup d'\u00e9tat, a claim which he publicly denied.\n\nThe October elections again brought a Republican majority to the Chamber of Deputies, further affirming public opinion. The Republicans would go on to gain a majority in the Senate by January 1879, establishing dominance in both houses and effectively ending the potential for a monarchist restoration. De MacMahon himself resigned on 30 January 1879 to be succeeded by the [[Opportunist Republicans|moderate]] [[Jules Gr\u00e9vy]].<ref>Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870-1939)'' (1940) pp 127-43.</ref>\n\n===Opportunist Republicans===\n{{further|Opportunist Republicans}}\n\nFollowing the 16 May crisis in 1877, [[Legitimist]]s were pushed out of power, and the Republic was finally governed by republicans referred to as [[Opportunist Republicans]] for their support of moderate social and political changes in order to establish the new regime firmly. The [[Jules Ferry laws]] that made [[public education]] free, mandatory, and secular (''[[la\u00efcit\u00e9|la\u0457que]]''), were voted in 1881 and 1882, one of the first signs of the expanding civic powers of the Republic. From that time onward, public education was no longer under the exclusive control of the Catholic congregations.<ref>D.W. Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870-1939)'' (1940) pp 144-79.</ref>\n\nTo discourage French monarchism as a serious political force, the [[French Crown Jewels]] were broken up and sold in 1885. Only a few crowns, their precious gems replaced by coloured glass, were kept.\n\n===Boulanger crisis===\n[[File:Georges_Ernest_Boulanger_by_Atelier_Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Georges Ernest Boulanger]], nicknamed G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Revanche]]\nIn 1889, the Republic was rocked by a sudden political crisis precipitated by General [[Georges Boulanger]]. An enormously popular general, he won a series of elections in which he would resign his seat in the Chamber of Deputies and run again in another district. At the apogee of his popularity in January 1889, he posed the threat of a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and the establishment of a dictatorship. With his base of support in the working districts of Paris and other cities, plus rural traditionalist Catholics and royalists, he promoted an aggressive nationalism aimed against Germany.  The elections of September 1889 marked a decisive defeat for the Boulangists.  They were defeated by the changes in the electoral laws that prevented Boulanger from running in multiple constituencies; by the government's aggressive opposition; and by the absence of the general himself, who placed himself in self-imposed exile to be with his mistress.  The fall of Boulanger severely undermined the political strength of the conservative and royalist elements within France; they would not recover their strength until 1940.<ref>Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870-1939)'' (1940) pp 183-213.</ref>\n\nRevisionist scholars have argued that the Boulangist movement more often represented elements of the radical left rather than the extreme right. Their work is part of an emerging consensus that France's radical right was formed in part during the Dreyfus era by men who had been Boulangist partisans of the radical left a decade earlier.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Mazgaj |title=The Origins of the French Radical Right: A Historiographical Essay |journal=[[French Historical Studies]] |year=1987 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=287\u2013315 |jstor=286267 |doi=10.2307/286267 }}</ref>\n\n===Panama scandal===\n{{main|Panama scandals}}\nThe [[Panama scandals]] of 1892 involved the enormous cost of a failed attempt to build the [[Panama Canal]]. Due to disease, death, inefficiency, and widespread corruption, the [[Panama Canal Company]] handling the massive project went bankrupt, with millions in losses. It is regarded as the largest monetary corruption scandal of the 19th century. Close to a billion francs were lost when the French government took bribes to keep quiet about the Panama Canal Company's financial troubles.<ref>David McCullough, ''The path between the seas: the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914'' (2001) pp 45-242.</ref>\n\n===The welfare state and public health===\n{{cns|The state had a smaller role in France than in Germany before the First World War.

The conduct of the affair has become a modern and universal symbol of injustice. It remains one of the most striking examples of a complex miscarriage of justice in which a central role was played by the press and public opinion.  At issue was blatant [[anti-Semitism]] as practiced by the [[French Army]] and defended by conservatives and Catholic traditionalists against secular centre-left, left and republican forces, including most Jews. In the end, the latter triumphed.<ref>{{cite book |first=Piers Paul |last=Read |title=The Dreyfus Affair |location=New York |publisher=Bloomsbury Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-60819-432-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Stephen |last=Wilson |title=Antisemitism and Jewish Response in France during the Dreyfus Affair |journal=[[European History Quarterly|European Studies Review]] |year=1976 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=225\u2013248 |doi=10.1177/026569147600600203 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:AlfredDreyfus.jpg|thumb|Capt. [[Alfred Dreyfus]]]]\n\nThe affair began in November 1894 with the conviction for treason of Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a young French artillery officer of [[History of Jews in Alsace|Alsatian Jewish descent]]. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for communicating French military secrets to the German Embassy in Paris and sent to the penal colony at [[Devil's Island]] in [[French Guiana]] (nicknamed ''la guillotine s\u00e8che'', the dry guillotine), where he spent almost five years.\n\nTwo years later, evidence came to light that identified a French Army major named [[Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy]] as the real spy. After high-ranking military officials suppressed the new evidence, a military court unanimously acquitted Esterhazy. In response, the Army brought up additional charges against Dreyfus based on false documents. Word of the military court's attempts to frame Dreyfus began to spread, chiefly owing to the polemic ''[[J'accuse (letter)|J'accuse]]'', a vehement open letter published in a Paris newspaper in January 1898 by the notable writer [[\u00c9mile Zola]]. Activists put pressure on the government to re-open the case.\n\nIn 1899, Dreyfus was returned to France for another trial. The intense political and judicial scandal that ensued divided French society between those who supported Dreyfus (now called \"Dreyfusards\"), such as [[Anatole France]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]], and those who condemned him (the anti-Dreyfusards), such as [[\u00c9douard Drumont]], the director and publisher of the anti-Semitic newspaper ''[[La Libre Parole]]''. The new trial resulted in another conviction and a 10-year sentence, but Dreyfus was given a pardon and set free. Eventually all the accusations against him were demonstrated to be baseless, and in 1906, Dreyfus was exonerated and re-instated as a major in the French Army.\n\nFrom 1894 to 1906, the scandal divided France deeply and lastingly into two opposing camps: the pro-Army \"anti-Dreyfusards\" composed of conservatives, Catholic traditionalists and monarchists who generally lost the initiative to the anti-clerical, pro-republican \"Dreyfusards\", with strong support from intellectuals and teachers. It embittered French politics and facilitated the increasing influence of radical politicians on both sides of the political spectrum.\n\n==Social history==\n{{main|Belle \u00c9poque}}\n\n===Newspapers===\nThe democratic political structure was supported by the proliferation of politicized newspapers. The circulation of the daily press in Paris went from 1 million in 1870 to 5 million in 1910; it later reached 6 million in 1939.  Advertising grew rapidly, providing a steady financial basis for publishing, but it did not cover all of the costs involved and had to be supplemented by secret subsidies from commercial interests that wanted favourable reporting.  A new liberal press law of 1881 abandoned the restrictive practices that had been typical for a century. [[R. Hoe & Company|High-speed rotary Hoe presses]], introduced in the 1860s, facilitated quick turnaround time and cheaper publication.  New types of popular newspapers, especially ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'', reached an audience more interested in diverse entertainment and gossip than hard news.  It captured a quarter of the Parisian market and forced the rest to lower their prices.  The main dailies employed their own journalists who competed for news flashes. All newspapers relied upon the Agence Havas (now [[Agence France-Presse]]), a telegraphic news service with a network of reporters and contracts with [[Reuters]] to provide world service.

They also took payments for favourable notices in news articles of commercial products. Sometimes, a newspaper would blackmail a business by threatening to publish unfavorable information unless the business immediately started advertising in the paper. Foreign governments, especially Russia and Turkey, secretly paid the press hundreds of thousands of francs a year to guarantee favourable coverage of the bonds it was selling in Paris. When the real news was bad about Russia, as during its 1905 Revolution or during its war with Japan, it raised the ante to millions.  During the World War, newspapers became more of a propaganda agency on behalf of the war effort and avoided critical commentary.  They seldom reported the achievements of the Allies, crediting all the good news to the French army.  In a sentence, the newspapers were not independent champions of the truth, but secretly paid advertisements for banking.<ref>See {{cite book |first=Theodore |last=Zeldin |authorlink=Theodore Zeldin |title=France: 1848\u20131945 |year=1977 |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=978-0-19-822125-8 |chapter=Newspapers and corruption |pages=492\u2013573 }} Also, pp 522\u201324 on foreign subsidies.</ref>\n\nThe World War ended a golden era for the press. Their younger staff members were drafted, and male replacements could not be found (female journalists were not considered suitable.) Rail transportation was rationed and less paper and ink came in, and fewer copies could be shipped out. Inflation raised the price of newsprint, which was always in short supply. The cover price went up, circulation fell and many of the 242 dailies published outside Paris closed down. The government set up the Interministerial Press Commission to supervise the press closely. A separate agency imposed tight censorship that led to blank spaces where news reports or editorials were disallowed. The dailies sometimes were limited to only two pages instead of the usual four, leading one satirical paper to try to report the war news in the same spirit:\n: War News.

By 1939, its circulation was over 1.7 million, double that of its nearest rival the tabloid ''[[Le Petit Parisien]]''. In addition to its daily paper, ''Paris Soir'' sponsored a highly successful women's magazine [[Marie Claire|''Marie-Claire'']].

The French clergy and bishops were closely associated with the monarchists and many of its hierarchy were from noble families. Republicans were based in the [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] middle class, who saw the Church's alliance with the monarchists as a political threat to republicanism, and a threat to the modern spirit of progress. The republicans detested the Church for its political and class affiliations; for them, the Church represented the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]], a time in French history most republicans hoped was long behind them.  The republicans were strengthened by Protestant and Jewish support.  Numerous laws were passed to weaken the Catholic Church. In 1879, priests were excluded from the administrative committees of hospitals and boards of charity; in 1880, new measures were directed against the religious congregations; from 1880 to 1890 came the substitution of lay women for nuns in many hospitals; in 1882, the [[Jules Ferry laws|Ferry school laws]] were passed.

Religious instruction in all schools was forbidden, and religious orders were forbidden to teach in them. Funds were appropriated from religious schools to build more state schools.

The Liberal Action was founded in 1901 by [[Jacques Piou]] and [[Albert de Mun]], former monarchists who switched to republicanism at the request of Pope [[Leo XIII]].

Membership was open to everyone, not just Catholics. It sought to gather all the \"honest people\" and to be the melting pot sought by Leo XIII where Catholics and moderate Republicans would unite to support a policy of tolerance and social progress. Its motto summarized its program: \"Liberty for all; equality before the law; better conditions for the workers.\" However, the \"old republicans\" were few, and it did not manage to regroup all Catholics, as it was shunned by monarchists, Christian democrats, and [[Integrist]]s. In the end, it recruited mostly among the liberal-Catholics ([[Jacques Piou]]) and the Social Catholics ([[Albert de Mun]]).  The ALP was drawn into battle from its very beginnings (its first steps coincided with the beginning of the Combes ministry and its anticlerical combat policy), as religious matters were at the heart of its preoccupations. It defended the Church in the name of liberty and common law. Fiercely fought by the ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]'', the movement declined from 1908, when it lost the support of Rome.

However, in practice, masses and rituals continued to be performed.\n\nCombes was vigorously opposed by all the Conservative parties, who saw the mass closure of church schools as a persecution of religion. Combs led the anti-clerical coalition on the left, facing opposition primarily organized by the pro-Catholic ALP.  The ALP had a stronger popular base, with better financing and a stronger network of newspapers, but had far fewer seats in parliament.<ref name=\"online\"/>\n\nThe Combes government worked with Masonic lodges to create a secret surveillance of all army officers to make sure that devout Catholics would not be promoted. Exposed as the [[Affaire Des Fiches]], the scandal undermined support for the Combes government, and he resigned.

On 10 February 1905, the Chamber declared that \"the attitude of the Vatican\" had rendered the separation of Church and State inevitable and the law of the separation of church and state was passed in December 1905.

Bismarck's decision came in response to popular demand, and the Army's demand for a strong frontier. It was not necessary since France was much weaker militarily than Germany, but it forced Bismarck to orient German foreign policy to block France from having any major allies. Alsace and Lorraine were a grievance for some years, but by 1890 had largely faded away with the French realization that nostalgia was not as useful as modernization. France rebuilt its Army, emphasizing modernization in such features as new artillery, and after 1905 invested heavily in military aircraft. Most important in restoring prestige was a strong emphasis on the growing French Empire, which brought prestige, despite large financial costs.  Very few French families settled in the colonies, and they were too poor in natural resources and trade to significantly benefit the overall economy. Nevertheless, they were second in size only to the British Empire, provided prestige in world affairs, and gave an opportunity for Catholics (under heavy attack by the Republicans in Parliament) to devote their energies to spread French culture and civilization worldwide.  An extremely expensive investment in building the Panama Canal was a total failure, in terms of money, many deaths by disease, and political scandal.<ref>Jean-Marie Mayeur and Madeleine Reb\u00e9rioux, ''The Third Republic from its Origins to the Great War, 1871\u20131914'' (1984), pp 155-61, 168-69, 272-78.</ref> Bismarck was fired in 1890, and after that German foreign policy was confused and misdirected.

Although France was one of the few republics in Europe, its diplomats mingled smoothly with the aristocratic representatives at the royal courts.  Prime ministers and leading politicians generally paid little attention to foreign affairs, allowing a handful of senior men to control policy.  In the decades before the First World War they dominated the embassies in the 10 major countries where France had an ambassador (elsewhere, they sent lower-ranking ministers).  They included [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]], the foreign minister from 1898 to 1905; [[Paul Cambon]], in London, 1890-1920; [[Jean Jules Jusserand|Jules Jusserand]], in Washington from 1902 to 1924; and Camille Barr\u00e8re, in Rome from 1897 to 1924.  In terms of foreign policy, there was general agreement about the need for high protective tariffs, which kept agricultural prices high.  After the defeat by the Germans, there was a strong widespread anti-German sentiment focused on revanchism and regaining Alsace and Lorraine.  The Empire was a matter of great pride, and service as administrators, soldiers and missionaries was a high status occupation.<ref>Felix Gilbert, David Clay Large, ''The End of the European Era: 1890 to the Present'' (2002) p 64-65.</ref>\nFrench foreign policy from 1871 to 1914 showed a dramatic transformation from a humiliated power with no friends and not much of an empire in 1871, to the centerpiece of the European alliance system in 1914, with a flourishing colonial empire that was second in size only to Great Britain. Although religion was a hotly contested matter in domestic politics, the Catholic Church made missionary work and church building a specialty in the colonies.

Under heavy pressure the French withdrew, securing Anglo-Egyptian control over the area. The status quo was recognised by an agreement between the two states acknowledging British control over Egypt, while France became the dominant power in [[Morocco]], but France suffered a humiliating defeat overall.<ref>D.W.

France secured an alliance with the [[Russian Empire]] in 1894 after diplomatic talks between Germany and Russia had failed to produce any working agreement. The [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] served as the cornerstone of French foreign policy until 1917. A further link with Russia was provided by vast French investments and loans before 1914. In 1904, French foreign minister [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]] negotiated the ''[[Entente Cordiale]]'' with [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]], the British Foreign Secretary, an agreement that ended a long period of Anglo-French tensions and hostility. The ''Entente Cordiale'', which functioned as an informal Anglo-French alliance, was further strengthened by the [[First Moroccan Crisis|First]] and [[Agadir Crisis|Second Moroccan crises]] of 1905 and 1911, and by secret military and naval staff talks. Delcass\u00e9's rapprochement with Britain was controversial in France as [[Anglophobia]] was prominent around the start of the 20th century, sentiments that had been much reinforced by the [[Fashoda Incident]] of 1898, in which Britain and France had almost gone to war, and by the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], in which French public opinion was very much on the side of Britain's enemies.<ref>T.

Metropolitan France was a captive market, so large landowners could borrow large sums in Paris to modernize agricultural techniques with tractors and mechanized equipment.

(The Americans left their heavy weapons at home in order to use the available transports to send as many soldiers as possible.) Building on foundations laid in the early months of the war, the Ministry of War matched production to the operational and tactical needs of the army, with an emphasis on meeting the insatiable demands for artillery.

Anti-democratic groups, such as the [[French Communist Party|Communists]] on the left and royalists on the right, played relatively minor roles.\n\nThe flow of [[World War I reparations|reparations from Germany]] played a central role in strengthening French finances. The government began a large-scale reconstruction program to repair wartime damages, and was burdened with a very large [[Government debt|public debt]]. Taxation policies were inefficient, with widespread evasion, and when the financial crisis grew worse in 1926, Poincar\u00e9 levied new taxes, reformed the system of tax collection, and drastically reduced government spending to balance the budget and stabilize the [[French franc|franc]]. Holders of the national debt lost 80% of the face value of their [[Government bond|bonds]], but runaway [[inflation]] did not occur. From 1926 to 1929, the French economy prospered and manufacturing flourished.\n\nForeign observers in the 1920s noted the excesses of the French upper classes, but emphasized the rapid re-building of the [[German occupation of north-east France during World War I|regions of northeastern France that had seen warfare and occupation]].

This was funded by a lottery\u2014the first one allowed in France since 1836. The lottery immediately became popular, and became a major foundation of the annual budget. Although the Great Depression was not yet severe, the lottery appealed to charitable impulses, greed, and respect for veterans.

The horrible devastation of the war, including the death of 1.5&nbsp;million French soldiers, the devastation of much of the steel and coal regions, and the long-term costs for veterans, were always remembered. France demanded that Germany assume many of the costs incurred from the war through annual reparation payments. French foreign and security policy used the balance of power and alliance politics to compel Germany to comply with its obligations under the Treaty of Versailles.  the problem was that the United States and Britain rejected a defensive alliance. Potential allies in Eastern Europe, such as Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia were too weak to confront Germany. Russia had been the long term French ally in the East, but now it was controlled by deeply distrusted in Paris.  France's transition to a more conciliatory policy in 1924 was a response to pressure from Britain and the United States, as well as to French weakness.<ref>Jacques N\u00e9r\u00e9, ''The foreign policy of France from 1914 to 1945'' (1975) pp 11-99.</ref>\n\nFrance enthusiastically joined the [[League of Nations]] in 1919, but felt betrayed by President [[Woodrow Wilson]], when his promises that the United States would sign a defence treaty with France and join the League were [[league of Nations#Global representation|rejected by the United States Congress]]. The main goal of French foreign policy was to preserve French power and neutralize the threat posed by Germany. When Germany fell behind in reparations payments in 1923, France [[occupation of Ruhr|seized the industrialized Ruhr region]]. The British Labour Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]], who viewed reparations as impossible to pay successfully, pressured French Premier [[\u00c9douard Herriot]] into a series of concessions to Germany. In total, France received \u00a31600&nbsp;million from Germany before reparations ended in 1932, but France had to pay war debts to the United States, and thus the net gain was only about \u00a3600&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite book |first=Maurice |last=Larkin |title=France since the Popular Front: Government and People, 1936\u20131986 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-19-873034-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/francesincepopul0000lark/page/9 9] |url=https://archive.org/details/francesincepopul0000lark/page/9 }}</ref>\n\nFrance tried to create a web of defensive treaties against Germany with Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. There was little effort to build up the military strength or technological capabilities of these small allies, and they remained weak and divided among themselves.

When [[Stalin]] told French Communists to collaborate with others on the left in 1934, a [[popular front]] was made possible with an emphasis on unity against fascism. In 1936, the Socialists and the Radicals formed a coalition, with Communist support, to complete it.<ref>{{cite book |first=Julian |last=Jackson |title=The Popular Front in France: Defending Democracy, 1934\u201338 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-521-31252-3 }}</ref>\n\nThe Popular Front's narrow victory in the [[1936 French legislative election|elections of the spring of 1936]] brought to power a government headed by the Socialists in alliance with the Radicals.  The Communists supported its domestic policies, but did not take any seats in the cabinet.  The prime minister was L\u00e9on Blum, a technocratic socialist who avoided making decisions. In two years in office, it focused on labour law changes sought by the trade unions, especially the mandatory [[40-hour work week]], down from 48 hours. All workers were given a two-week [[paid vacation]]. A [[collective bargaining]] law facilitated union growth; membership soared from 1,000,000 to 5,000,000 in one year, and workers' political strength was enhanced when the Communist and non-Communist unions joined together. The government [[Nationalization#France|nationalized]] the armaments industry and tried to seize control of the [[Bank of France]] in an effort to break the power of the richest 200 families in the country. Farmers received higher prices, and the government purchased surplus wheat, but farmers had to pay higher taxes. Wave after wave of strikes hit French industry in 1936. Wage rates went up 48%, but the work week was cut back by 17%, and the cost of living rose 46%, so there was little real gain to the average worker. The higher prices for French products resulted in a decline in overseas sales, which the government tried to neutralize by [[devaluation|devaluing]] the franc, a measure that led to a reduction in the value of bonds and savings accounts. The overall result was significant damage to the French economy, and a lower [[Economic growth|rate of growth]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Maurice |last=Larkin |title=France since the Popular Front: Government and People, 1936\u20131986 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-19-873034-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/francesincepopul0000lark/page/55 55\u201360] |url=https://archive.org/details/francesincepopul0000lark/page/55 }}</ref>\n\nMost historians judge the Popular Front a failure, although some call it a partial success.

France lost Alsace and most of Lorraine, and had to pay a cash indemnity to the new nation of Germany.\n* 1871: The [[Paris Commune]]. In a formal sense the Paris Commune of 1871 was simply the local authority that exercised power in Paris for two months in the spring of 1871. It was separate from that of the new government under [[Adolphe Thiers]]. The regime came to an end after a bloody suppression by Thiers's government in May 1871.\n* 1872\u201373: After the nation faced the immediate political problems, it needed to establish a permanent form of government. Thiers wanted to base it on the constitutional monarchy of Britain, however he realized France would have to remain republican. In expressing this belief, he violated the Pact of Bordeaux, angering the Monarchists in the Assembly. As a result, he was forced to resign in 1873.\n* 1873: Marshal MacMahon, a conservative Roman Catholic, was made President of the Republic. The Duc de Broglie, an Orleanist, as the prime minister. Unintentionally, the Monarchists had replaced an absolute monarchy by a parliamentary one.\n* Feb 1875: Series of parliamentary Acts established the organic or constitutional laws of the new republic. At its apex was a President of the Republic. A two-chamber parliament was created, along with a ministry under the ''President of the Council'', who was nominally answerable to both the President of the Republic and Parliament.\n* May 1877: with public opinion swinging heavily in favour of a republic, the President of the Republic, [[Patrice MacMahon]], himself a monarchist, made one last desperate attempt to salvage the monarchical cause by dismissing the republic-minded Prime Minister Jules Simon and reappointing the monarchist leader the Duc de Broglie to office. He then dissolved parliament and called a general election. If his hope had been to halt the move towards republicanism, it backfired spectacularly, with the President being accused of having staged a constitutional coup d'\u00e9tat, known as {{lang|fr|le seize Mai}} after the date when it happened.\n* 1879: Republicans returned triumphant, finally killing off the prospect of a restored French monarchy by gaining control of the Senate on 5 January 1879. MacMahon himself resigned on 30 January 1879, leaving a seriously weakened presidency in the shape of Jules Gr\u00e9vy.\n* 1880: The Jesuits and several other religious orders were dissolved, and their members were forbidden to teach in state schools.\n* 1881: Following the 16 May crisis in 1877, Legitimists were pushed out of power, and the Republic was finally governed by republicans, called Opportunist Republicans as they were in favour of moderate changes to firmly establish the new regime. The Jules Ferry laws on free, mandatory and secular public education, voted in 1881 and 1882, were one of the first sign of this republican control of the Republic, as public education was not any more in the exclusive control of the Catholic congregations.\n* 1882: Religious instruction was removed from all state schools. The measures were accompanied by the abolition of chaplains in the armed forces and the removal of nuns from hospitals. Due to the fact that France was mainly Roman Catholic, this was greatly opposed.\n* 1889: The Republic was rocked by the sudden but short-timed Boulanger crisis spawning the rise of the modern intellectual [[\u00c9mile Zola]]. Later, the Panama scandals also were quickly criticized by the press.\n* 1893: Following anarchist [[Auguste Vaillant]]'s bombing at the National Assembly, killing nobody but injuring one, deputies voted the {{lang|fr|lois sc\u00e9l\u00e9rates}} which limited the [[Law on the Freedom of the Press of 29 July 1881|1881 freedom of the press laws]]. The following year, President [[Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] was stabbed to death by Italian anarchist Caserio.\n* 1894: The [[Dreyfus Affair]]: a Jewish artillery officer, [[Alfred Dreyfus]], was arrested on charges relating to conspiracy and espionage. Allegedly, Dreyfus had handed over important military documents discussing the designs of a new French artillery piece to a German military attach\u00e9 named [[Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen|Max von Schwartzkoppen]].\n* 1894: The [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] was formed.\n* 1898: Writer \u00c9mile Zola published an article entitled {{lang|fr|J'Accuse...!}} The article alleged an anti-Semitic conspiracy in the highest ranks of the military to scapegoat Dreyfus, tacitly supported by the government and the Catholic Church. The [[Fashoda Incident]] nearly causes an Anglo-French war.\n* 1901: The Radical-Socialist Party is founded and remained the most important party of the Third Republic starting at the end of the 19th century. The same year, followers of [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]], such as [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]], who became President of the Council in the 1920s, created the Democratic Republican Alliance (ARD), which became the main center-right party after World War I and the parliamentary disappearance of monarchists and Bonapartists.\n* 1904: French foreign minister [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]] negotiated with Lord Lansdowne, the British Foreign Secretary, the {{lang|fr|[[Entente Cordiale]]}} in 1904.\n* 1905: The government introduced the law on the separation of Church and State, heavily supported by Emile Combes, who had been strictly enforcing the 1901 voluntary association law and the 1904 law on religious congregations' freedom of teaching (more than 2,500 private teaching establishments were by then closed by the state, causing bitter opposition from the Catholic and conservative population).\n* 1906: It became apparent that the documents handed over to Schwartzkoppen by Dreyfus in 1894 were a forgery and thus Dreyfus was pardoned after serving 12 years in prison.\n* 1914: After SFIO (French Section of the Workers' International) leader [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]]'s assassination a few days before the German invasion of Belgium, the French socialist movement, as the whole of the Second International, abandoned its antimilitarist positions and joined the national war effort.

He was the longest serving of the original [[BBC Radio 1]] DJs, broadcasting regularly from 1967 until his death in 2004.\n\nHe was one of the first broadcasters to play [[psychedelic rock]] and [[progressive rock]] records on British radio, and he is widely acknowledged for promoting artists working in a multitude of genres including [[pop music|pop]], [[dub reggae]], [[punk rock]] and [[post-punk]], [[electronic music]] and [[dance music]], [[indie rock]], [[extreme metal]], and [[British hip hop]]. Fellow DJ [[Paul Gambaccini]] described Peel as \"the most important man in music for about a dozen years\".\n\nPeel's Radio 1 shows were notable for the regular \"[[List of Peel sessions|Peel sessions]]\", which usually consisted of four songs recorded by an artist live in the BBC's studios, and which often provided the first major national coverage to bands that would later achieve great fame. Another popular feature of his shows was the annual [[Festive Fifty]] countdown of his listeners' favourite records of the year.<ref>Garner, Ken. ''The Peel Sessions: A story of teenage dreams and one man's love of new music''. Random House, 2010.</ref>\n\nPeel appeared occasionally on British television as one of the presenters of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in the 1980s, and he provided [[voice-over]] commentary for a number of BBC programmes. He became popular with the audience of [[BBC Radio 4]] for his ''[[Home Truths]]'' programme, which ran from the 1990s, featuring unusual stories from listeners' domestic lives.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Peel was born in [[Heswall]] Nursing Home<ref>{{cite book|title=Margrave of the Marshes|author=Peel, John|year=2005|page=7|quote= described in his autobiography as \"Heswall Cottage Hospital\"}}</ref><ref name= OxDict>{{cite web |url= https://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/94387|title=Peel, John [real name John Robert Parker Ravenscroft] (1939\u20132004), radio and television broadcaster |work= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | accessdate= 13 May 2019 }}</ref> in Heswall on the [[Wirral Peninsula]], near [[Liverpool]], the third son of Robert Leslie Ravenscroft, a successful [[cotton]] merchant,<ref name=\"Heatley\">{{Cite book |last=Heatley|first=Michael|title=John Peel: A Life in Music |year= 2004| publisher= Michael O'Mara Books| page=12|isbn=1-84317-151-1}}</ref> and his wife Joan Mary (n\u00e9e Swainson).<ref name= OxDict /> He grew up in the nearby village of [[Burton, Ellesmere Port and Neston|Burton]].{{sfn|Heatley|p=12}} He was educated as a boarder at [[Shrewsbury School]],{{sfn|Heatley|p=17}} where one of his contemporaries was future [[Monty Python]] member [[Michael Palin]].<ref>{{imdb title| id= 0814163| title= John Peel's Record Box}}, 2005</ref>\n\nThe solitary Peel was an avid radio listener and record collector from an early age, cutting his teeth on fare offered by the [[American Forces Network]] and [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]].<ref name=Flipside>{{cite journal| first1= Andy |last1= Chapman |first2= Coal| last2= Latter| title= John Peel| work= Flipside| number= 65 |date= Spring 1990| pages= 47\u201349}}</ref> He later recalled an early desire to host a radio programme of his own \"so that I could play music that I heard and wanted others to hear.\"<ref name=Flipside />\n\nHis housemaster, R.

Whilst in Rochdale during the week, he stayed in a bed-and-breakfast in the area of Milkstone Road and Drake Street and would develop long-term associations with the town as the years progressed.\n\n==Career==\n===United States===\nIn 1960, aged 21, Peel went to the United States to work for a [[cotton growing|cotton producer]] who had business dealings with his father.{{sfn|Heatley|p=26-27}} Once this job finished, he took a number of others, including working as a travelling [[Insurance policy|insurance salesman]]. While in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], where the insurance company he worked for was based, he conversed with the presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]], and his running mate [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], who were touring the city during the 1960 election campaign, and took photographs of them.\n\nFollowing Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, Peel passed himself off as a reporter for the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'' in order to attend the arraignment of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]. He and a friend can be seen in the footage of the 22/23 November midnight [[press conference]] at the [[Dallas Police Department]] when Oswald was paraded before the media.<ref>{{cite interview| first= John | last= Peel| work= Fillerzine| number= 5| date= September 1996| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aHDJy0R8nQ| title= John Peel in Dallas}}</ref> He later phoned in the story to the ''Echo''.\n\nWhile working for the insurance company, Peel wrote programs for [[punched card]] entry for an [[IBM 1410]] computer (which led to his entry in ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]'' noting him as a former [[computer programmer]]), and he got his first radio job, albeit unpaid, working for [[WRR (AM)]] in Dallas. There, he presented the second hour of the Monday night programme ''Kat's Karavan'', which was primarily hosted by the American singer and radio personality [[Jim Lowe]]. Following this, and as [[Beatlemania]] hit the United States, Peel got a job with the Dallas radio station KLIF<!--wl links to Norwegian Climate and Pollution Agency--> as the official [[The Beatles|Beatles]] correspondent on the strength of his connection to Liverpool. He later worked for [[KOKC (AM)|KOMA]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], until 1965 when he moved to [[KKDD|KMEN]] in [[San Bernardino, California]], using the name John Ravencroft to present the breakfast show.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/events/peel/perfumed_garden.shtml |title=6 Music \u2013 Events \u2013 Peeling Back The Years |publisher=BBC |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Return to Britain===\nPeel returned to England in early 1967 and found work with the offshore [[UK pirate radio|pirate radio]] station [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]]. He was offered the midnight-to-two shift, which gradually developed into a programme called ''[[The Perfumed Garden (radio show)|The Perfumed Garden]]'' (some thought it was named after an erotic book famous at the time \u2013 which Peel claimed never to have read). It was on \"Big L\" that he first adopted the name \"John Peel\" (the name was suggested by a Radio London secretary) and established himself as a distinctive radio voice.\n\nPeel's show was an outlet for the music of the [[UK underground]] scene. He played classic [[blues]], [[folk music]] and [[psychedelic rock]], with an emphasis on the new music emerging from [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]]. As important as the musical content of the programme was the personal \u2013 sometimes confessional \u2013 tone of Peel's presentation, and the listener participation it engendered. Underground events he had attended during his periods of shore leave, like the [[UFO Club]] and \"[[The 14 Hour Technicolor Dream]]\", together with [[causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres]] like the drug \"busts\" of the [[Rolling Stones]] and [[John \"Hoppy\" Hopkins]], were discussed between records. All this was far removed from Radio London's daytime format. Listeners sent Peel letters, poems, and records from their own collections, so that the programme became a vehicle for two-way communication; by the final week of Radio London he was receiving far more mail than any other DJ on the station.<ref name=\"djhistory\">{{Cite web| url= http://www.djhistory.com/djhistory/archiveInterviewDisplay.php?interview_id=43| first= Bill |last= Brewster| date=30 April 2004| website= DJHistory.com |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080216184646/http://www.djhistory.com/djhistory/archiveInterviewDisplay.php?interview_id=43 | title= Archive Interviews: John Peel |archive-date=16 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nAfter the closure of Radio London in 1967, Peel wrote a column, ''The Perfumed Garden'', for the underground newspaper the ''[[International Times]]'' (from autumn 1967 to mid-1969), in which he showed himself to be a committed, if critical, supporter of the ideals of the underground. A ''Perfumed Garden'' mailing list was set up by a group of keen listeners, which facilitated contacts and gave rise to numerous small-scale, local arts projects typical of the time, including the poetry magazine ''Sol''.\n\n===BBC career===\n[[File:John Peel in record shop.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Peel in a record shop in [[Bochum, Germany]]]]\nWhen Radio London closed down on 14 August 1967, John Peel joined the BBC's new pop music station, [[BBC Radio 1]], which began broadcasting the following month. Unlike Big L, Radio 1 was not a full-time station, but a hybrid of recorded music and live studio orchestras. Peel recalled, \"I was one of the first lot on Radio 1 and I think it was mainly because ... Radio 1 had no real idea what they were doing so they had to take people off the pirate ships because there wasn't anybody else.\" Peel presented a programme called ''[[Top Gear (radio show)|Top Gear]]''. At first he was obliged to share presentation duties with other DJs ([[Pete Drummond]] and [[Tommy Vance]] were among his co-hosts) but in February 1968 he was given sole charge of ''Top Gear''; he continued to present the show until it ended in 1975. Peel played an eclectic mix of the music that caught his attention, which he would continue to do throughout his career.\n\nIn 1969, after hosting a trailer for a BBC programme on VD on his ''Night Ride'' programme, Peel received significant media attention because he divulged on air that he had suffered from a [[sexually transmitted disease]] earlier that year. This admission was later used in an attempt to discredit him when he appeared as a defence witness in the 1971 ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' obscenity trial.\n\nThe ''Night Ride'' programme, advertised by the BBC as an exploration of words and music, seemed to take up from where ''The Perfumed Garden'' had left off. It featured rock, folk, blues, classical and electronic music. A unique feature of the programme was the inclusion of tracks, mostly of exotic non-Western music, drawn from the [[BBC Sound Archive]]; the most popular of these were gathered on a BBC Records LP, ''John Peel's Archive Things'' (1970). ''Night Ride''  also featured poetry readings and numerous interviews with a wide range of guests, including his friends [[Marc Bolan]], journalist and musician [[Mick Farren]], poet Pete Roche, and singer-songwriter [[Bridget St John]] and stars such as [[the Byrds]], the Rolling Stones and [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]]. The programme captured much of the creative activity of the underground scene. Its anti-establishment stance and unpredictability did not find approval with the BBC hierarchy, and it ended in September 1969 after 18 months. In his sleeve notes to the ''Archive Things'' LP Peel calls the free-form nature of ''Night Ride'' his preferred radio format. His subsequent shows featured a mixture of records and live sessions, a format that would characterise his Radio 1 programmes for the rest of his career.\n\n===Punk era===\nPeel's enthusiasm for music outside the mainstream occasionally brought him into conflict with the Radio 1 hierarchy. On one occasion, the then-station controller [[Derek Chinnery]] contacted John Walters and asked him to confirm that the show was not playing any [[punk rock|punk]], which he (Chinnery) had read about in the press and of which he disapproved. Chinnery was evidently somewhat surprised by Walters' reply that in recent weeks they had been playing little else.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.simongarfield.com/assets/pdfs/books_extracts/the_nations_favourite.pdf| title= Simon Garfield interview with John Peel| format= PDF| work= Simongarfield.com| accessdate= 9 February 2013| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080626133533/http://www.simongarfield.com/assets/pdfs/books_extracts/the_nations_favourite.pdf| archive-date= 26 June 2008| url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1990 interview, Peel recalled his 1976 discovery of the first album by New York punk band the [[Ramones]] as a seminal event:\n{{quote|At that time almost all the new bands {{sic|comprised|expected=consisted| of}} people who had previously been in successful bands who had broken up then reformed.... Well I played the first Ramones LP \u2014 it was identical to the first time I had heard [[Little Richard]] \u2014 the intensity was frightening! So I played five or six tracks on the next show and immediately I received mail from people demanding that I never play stuff like that again. Whenever that happens I always go in the opposite direction, so I played more and it was great! It was a classic case of changing courses in mid-stream and in a month the average age of the audience dropped by 10 years and the whole social class changed \u2014 which I was very pleased about.<ref name=Flipside />}}\n\nIn 1979 Peel stated: \"They leave you to get on with it. I'm paid money by the BBC not to go off and work for a commercial radio station ... I wouldn't want to go to one anyway, because they wouldn't let me do what the BBC let me do.\"<ref name= \"Hepworth\">{{cite interview| interviewer= David Hepworth| last= Peel| first= John | title= Forty is More Fun: John Peel, Superfan, Talks to David Hepworth| work= [[Smash Hits]]| publisher= EMAP National Publications Ltd| date= 4\u201317 October 1979| page= 15}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:JP Peel Acres.jpg|thumb|Peel Acres in [[Great Finborough]], Suffolk]]\nPeel's reputation as an important DJ who broke unsigned acts into the mainstream was such that young hopefuls sent him an enormous number of records, CDs, and tapes. When he returned home from a three-week holiday at the end of 1986 there were 173 LPs, 91 12\"s and 179 7\"s waiting for him. In 1983 Alan Melina and Jeff Chegwin, the music publishers for then-unsigned artist [[Billy Bragg]], drove to the Radio 1 studios with a mushroom [[biryani]] and a copy of his record after hearing Peel mention that he was hungry; the subsequent airplay launched Billy Bragg's career.<ref>{{cite book| authorlink= Andrew Collins (broadcaster) | first= Andrew | last= Collins| title= Still Suitable for Miners (Billy Bragg: The Official Biography)| edition= Revised |publisher= Virgin Books| year= 2002| isbn= }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:JP Homestudio.jpg|thumb|Studio at Peel Acres]]\n\nIn addition to his Radio 1 show, Peel broadcast as a disc jockey on the [[BBC World Service]], on the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]] (''John Peel's Music on BFBS'') for 30 years, [[NPO 3FM|VPRO Radio3]] in the Netherlands, [[Radiomafia|YLE Radio Mafia]] in Finland, [[Hitradio \u00d63|\u00d63]] in Austria (Nachtexpress), and on Radio 4U, Radio Eins (Peel ...), [[Radio Bremen]] (Ritz) and some independent radio stations around FSK Hamburg in Germany. As a result of his BFBS programme he was voted, in Germany, \"Top DJ in Europe\".\n\nPeel was an occasional presenter of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' on BBC1 from the late 1960s until the 1990s, and in particular from 1982 to 1987 when he appeared regularly. In 1971 he appeared not as presenter but performer, alongside [[Faces (band)|Rod Stewart and the Faces]], pretending to play [[mandolin]] on \"[[Maggie May]]\". He often presented the BBC's television coverage of music events, notably the [[Glastonbury Festival]].\n\n===Later years===\nBetween 1995 and 1997, Peel presented ''Offspring'', a show about children, on [[BBC Radio 4]]. In 1998, ''Offspring'' grew into the magazine-style documentary show ''[[Home Truths]]''. When he took on the job presenting the programme, which was about everyday life in British families, Peel requested that it be free from celebrities, as he found real-life stories more entertaining. ''Home Truths'' was described by occasional stand-in presenter [[John Walters (broadcaster)|John Walters]] as being \"about people who had fridges called Renfrewshire\". Peel also made regular contributions to BBC Two's humorous look at the irritations of modern life ''[[Grumpy Old Men (TV show)|Grumpy Old Men]]''.

Peel married Sheila on 31 August 1974. The reception was in London's [[Regent's Park]], with Walters as best man. Peel wore [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] football colours (red) and walked down the aisle to the song \"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\". Their [[Herding dog|sheepdog]], Woggle, served as a [[bridesmaid]]. [[Rod Stewart]] and [[Graham Chapman]] attended.\n\nIn the 1970s, Peel and Sheila moved to a [[thatch]]ed cottage in the village of [[Great Finborough]] near [[Stowmarket]] in [[Suffolk]], nicknamed Peel Acres. In later years Peel broadcast many of his shows from a studio in the house, with Sheila and their children often being involved or at least mentioned. Peel's passion for [[Liverpool F.C.]] was reflected in his children's names: William Robert [[Anfield]], Alexandra Mary Anfield, Thomas James [[Kenny Dalglish|Dalglish]], and Florence Victoria [[Bill Shankly|Shankly]]. His later shows also regularly featured live performances (broadcast live, unlike the pre-recorded Peel sessions), mostly from BBC [[Maida Vale Studios]] in West London, but occasionally in the Peel Acres [[living room]].\n\nAt the age of 62 he was diagnosed with [[diabetes]], following many years of fatigue.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1573676.stm |title= John Peel 'relieved' to be diabetic |work=BBC News |date=1 October 2001 |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nPeel died suddenly at the age of 65 from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on 25 October 2004, on a working holiday in the [[Tahuantinsuyu|Inca]] city of [[Cusco]] in Peru. Shortly after the announcement of his death, tributes began to arrive from fans and supporters both in public and private life. On 26 October 2004 [[BBC Radio 1]] cleared its schedules to broadcast a day of tributes. London's ''Evening Standard'' boards that afternoon read \"the day the music died\", quoting [[Don McLean]]'s hit \"[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]\".\n\nPeel had often spoken wryly of his eventual death. He once said on the show ''[[Room 101 (British TV series)|Room 101]]'', \"I've always imagined I'd die by driving into the back of a truck while trying to read the name on a cassette and people would say, 'He would have wanted to go that way.'

Peel's stand-in on his Radio 1 slot, [[Rob da Bank]], also played the song at the start of the final show before his funeral. Another time, Peel said he would like to be remembered with a gospel song. He stated that the final record he would play would be the [[C. L. Franklin|Rev C. L.

The sessions originally came about due to restrictions imposed on the BBC by the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]] and [[Phonographic Performance Limited]] which represented the record companies dominated by the [[EMI]] cartel. Because of these restrictions the BBC had been forced to hire bands and orchestras to render [[cover versions]] of recorded music. The theory behind this device was that it would create employment and force people to buy records and not listen to them free of charge on the air. One of the reasons why the offshore broadcasting stations of the 1960s were called \"pirates\" was because they operated outside of British laws and were not bound by the [[needle time]] restriction on the number of records they could play on the air.\n\nThe BBC employed its own house bands and orchestras and it also engaged outside bands to record exclusive tracks for its programmes in BBC studios. This was the reason why Peel was able to use \"session men\" in his own programmes. Sessions were usually four tracks recorded and mixed in a single day; as such they often had a rough and ready, demo-like feel, somewhere between a live performance and a finished recording. During the 37 years Peel remained on [[BBC Radio 1]], over 4,000 sessions were recorded by over 2,000 artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions |title=Radio 1 \u2013 Keeping It Peel \u2013 Sessions |publisher=BBC |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> Many classic Peel Sessions have been released on record, particularly by the [[Strange Fruit Records|Strange Fruit]] label.\n\n===Festive Fifty===\n{{Main|Festive Fifty}}\nAn annual tradition of Peel's Radio 1 show was the [[Festive Fifty]]\u2014a countdown of the best tracks of the year as voted for by the listeners. Despite Peel's eclectic play list, the Festive Fifty tended to be composed largely of \"white boys with guitars\", as Peel complained in 1988. In 1991 the broadcast of the chart was cancelled due to a lack of votes, although many have speculated that it was because it didn't feature a single entry from the dance acts that Peel had been championing that year{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. Topped by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\", this Phantom Fifty was eventually broadcast at the rate of one track per programme in 1993.<ref name=\"F50\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/festive50s/ |title=Radio 1 \u2013 Keeping it Peel \u2013 Festive 50s |publisher=BBC |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref>  The 1997 chart was initially cancelled due to the lack of air-time Peel had been allocated for the period, but enough \"spontaneous\" votes were received over the phone that a Festive Thirty-One was compiled and broadcast.<ref name=\"F50\"/>\n\nPeel wrote that \"The Festive 50 dates back to what was doubtless a crisp September morning in the early-to-mid Seventies, when John Walters and I were musing on life in his uniquely squalid office. In our waggish way, we decided to mock the enthusiasm of the Radio 1 management of the time for programmes with [[alliterative]] titles. Content, we felt, was of less importance than a snappy ''Radio Times'' billing. In the course of our historic meeting we had, I imagine, some fine reasons for dismissing the idea of a Festive 40 and going instead for a Festive 50, a decision that was to ruin my Decembers for years to come, condemning me to night after night at home with a ledger, when I could have been out and about having fun, fun, fun.\"<ref>Peel, J., \"Bang Bang hits the tops\", ''[[The Times]]'' (London), {{ISSN|0140-0460}}, 2 January 1993, Features section p. SR.12.</ref>\n\nAfter his death, the Festive Fifty was continued on Radio 1 by [[Rob da Bank]], [[Huw Stephens]] and [[Ras Kwame]] for two years, but then given to Peel-inspired Internet radio station [[Dandelion Radio]], which continues to be compiled.\n\n===Dandelion Records and Strange Fruit===\nIn 1969 Peel founded [[Dandelion Records]] (named after his pet hamster) so he could release the debut album by [[Bridget St John]], which he also produced. The label released 27 albums by 18 different artists before folding in 1972. Of its albums, ''[[There is Some Fun Going Forward]]'' was a [[Sampler (record)|sampler]] intended to present its acts to a wide audience, but Dandelion was never a great success, with only two releases charting nationally: [[Medicine Head]] in the UK with \"(And the) Pictures in the Sky\" and [[Beau (guitarist)|Beau]] in [[Lebanon]] with \"1917 Revolution.\" Having had an affinity with the Manchester area from working in a cotton mill in Rochdale in 1959\nPeel signed Manchester bands [[Stack Waddy]] and [[Tractor (band)|Tractor]] to Dandelion and was always supportive of both bands throughout his life. It is alleged that Peel spotted a Rochdale postmark on the envelope containing the tape sent to him by Tractor, then called \"The Way We Live\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/northwest/series11/week2_tractor_bands.shtml|title=BBC Inside Out -|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs Peel stated:\n\n<blockquote>It was never a success financially. In fact, we lost money, if I remember correctly, on every single release bar one. I did quite like it but it was terribly indulgent. Not as indulgent as it would have been had I not had a business partner, admittedly... I liked having a label. It enabled you to put out stuff that you liked without, in those days, having to worry about whether it was going to work commercially. I've never been a good business man.</blockquote>\n\nPeel appeared on one Dandelion release: the [[David Bedford]] album ''[[Nurses Song with Elephants]]'', recorded at the Marquee Studios, as part of a group playing twenty-seven plastic pipe twirlers on the track \"Some Bright Stars for Queen's College\".\n\nIn the 1980s Peel set up [[Strange Fruit Records]] with Clive Selwood to release material recorded by the BBC for Peel Sessions.\n\n===Production (albums)===\n* 1969: ''Mike Hart Bleeds'' \u2013 [[Mike Hart (poet)|Mike Hart]]\n* 1969: ''The Year of the Great Leap Sideways'' \u2013 Occasional Word Ensemble\n* 1969: ''Soundtrack'' \u2013 [[Principal Edwards Magic Theatre]]\n* 1970: ''New Bottles Old Medicine'' \u2013 [[Medicine Head]]\n* 1970: ''Burnin' Red Ivanhoe'' \u2013 Burnin' Red Ivanhoe (co-produced w/ [[Tony Reeves]])\n* 1970: ''The Asmoto Running Band'' \u2013 [[Principal Edwards Magic Theatre]]\n* 1972: ''[[Bugger Off!]]'' \u2013 [[Stack Waddy]]\n\nJohn Peel is sometimes confused with the more prolific record producer Jonathan Peel, who was an in-house music producer for [[EMI]] before going freelance in 1970.<ref>Billboard, 30 May 1970</ref>\n\n===Favourite music===\nJohn Peel wrote in his autobiography, ''[[Margrave]] of the Marshes'', that the band of which he owned the most records was [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]]. Regulars in the [[Festive 50]], and easily recognised by vocalist [[Mark E. Smith]]'s distinctive delivery, The Fall became synonymous with Peel's Radio 1 show through the 1980s and 1990s. Peel kept in contact with many of the artists he championed but only met Smith on two, apparently awkward, occasions.\n\n[[The Misunderstood]] is the only band that Peel ever personally managed\u2014he first met the band in Riverside, California in 1966 and convinced them to move to London. He championed their music throughout his career; in 1968, he described their 1966 single \"[[I Can Take You to the Sun]]\" as \"the best popular record that's ever been recorded.\"<ref>John Peel, ''[[Top Gear (radio show)|Top Gear]]'' ([[BBC Radio 1]]), 8 November 1968.</ref> and shortly before his death, he stated, \"If I had to list the ten greatest performances I've seen in my life, one would be The Misunderstood at Pandora's Box, Hollywood, 1966 ...

He also described [[Lianne Hall]] as one of the great English voices.\n\nIn 1997 ''[[The Guardian]]'' asked Peel to list his top 20 albums. He listed [[Captain Beefheart]]'s ''[[Trout Mask Replica]]'' as his number 1, having previously described it as \"a work of art\". The top 20 also included LPs by [[The Velvet Underground]], [[The Ramones]], [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], [[Misty in Roots]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Neil Young]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Four Brothers (band)|The Four Brothers]], [[Dave Clarke (techno DJ)|Dave Clarke]], [[Richard and Linda Thompson]] and [[The Rolling Stones]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/oct/12/johnpeel.popandrock |title=The Peel detective |last1=Dennis |first1=Jon|date=12 October 2005 |website=[[theguardian.com]] |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nA longer list of his favourite singles was revealed in 2005 when the contents of a wooden box in which he stored the records that meant the most to him were made public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/peel2005.htm |title=Rocklist.net...The Records That John Peel Loved The Most |publisher=Rocklistmusic.co.uk |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> The box was the subject of a television documentary, ''[[John Peel's Record Box]]''.

He was the longest serving of the original [[BBC Radio 1]] DJs, broadcasting regularly from 1967 until his death in 2004.\n\nHe was one of the first broadcasters to play [[psychedelic rock]] and [[progressive rock]] records on British radio, and he is widely acknowledged for promoting artists working in a multitude of genres including [[pop music|pop]], [[dub reggae]], [[punk rock]] and [[post-punk]], [[electronic music]] and [[dance music]], [[indie rock]], [[extreme metal]], and [[British hip hop]]. Fellow DJ [[Paul Gambaccini]] described Peel as \"the most important man in music for about a dozen years\".\n\nPeel's Radio 1 shows were notable for the regular \"[[List of Peel sessions|Peel sessions]]\", which usually consisted of four songs recorded by an artist live in the BBC's studios, and which often provided the first major national coverage to bands that would later achieve great fame. Another popular feature of his shows was the annual [[Festive Fifty]] countdown of his listeners' favourite records of the year.<ref>Garner, Ken. ''The Peel Sessions: A story of teenage dreams and one man's love of new music''. Random House, 2010.</ref>\n\nPeel appeared occasionally on British television as one of the presenters of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in the 1980s, and he provided [[voice-over]] commentary for a number of BBC programmes. He became popular with the audience of [[BBC Radio 4]] for his ''[[Home Truths]]'' programme, which ran from the 1990s, featuring unusual stories from listeners' domestic lives.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Peel was born in [[Heswall]] Nursing Home<ref>{{cite book|title=Margrave of the Marshes|author=Peel, John|year=2005|page=7|quote= described in his autobiography as \"Heswall Cottage Hospital\"}}</ref><ref name= OxDict>{{cite web |url= https://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/94387|title=Peel, John [real name John Robert Parker Ravenscroft] (1939\u20132004), radio and television broadcaster |work= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | accessdate= 13 May 2019 }}</ref> in Heswall on the [[Wirral Peninsula]], near [[Liverpool]], the third son of Robert Leslie Ravenscroft, a successful [[cotton]] merchant,<ref name=\"Heatley\">{{Cite book |last=Heatley|first=Michael|title=John Peel: A Life in Music |year= 2004| publisher= Michael O'Mara Books| page=12|isbn=1-84317-151-1}}</ref> and his wife Joan Mary (n\u00e9e Swainson).<ref name= OxDict /> He grew up in the nearby village of [[Burton, Ellesmere Port and Neston|Burton]].{{sfn|Heatley|p=12}} He was educated as a boarder at [[Shrewsbury School]],{{sfn|Heatley|p=17}} where one of his contemporaries was future [[Monty Python]] member [[Michael Palin]].<ref>{{imdb title| id= 0814163| title= John Peel's Record Box}}, 2005</ref>\n\nThe solitary Peel was an avid radio listener and record collector from an early age, cutting his teeth on fare offered by the [[American Forces Network]] and [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]].<ref name=Flipside>{{cite journal| first1= Andy |last1= Chapman |first2= Coal| last2= Latter| title= John Peel| work= Flipside| number= 65 |date= Spring 1990| pages= 47\u201349}}</ref> He later recalled an early desire to host a radio programme of his own \"so that I could play music that I heard and wanted others to hear.\"<ref name=Flipside />\n\nHis housemaster, R.

Whilst in Rochdale during the week, he stayed in a bed-and-breakfast in the area of Milkstone Road and Drake Street and would develop long-term associations with the town as the years progressed.\n\n==Career==\n===United States===\nIn 1960, aged 21, Peel went to the United States to work for a [[cotton growing|cotton producer]] who had business dealings with his father.{{sfn|Heatley|p=26-27}} Once this job finished, he took a number of others, including working as a travelling [[Insurance policy|insurance salesman]]. While in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], where the insurance company he worked for was based, he conversed with the presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]], and his running mate [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], who were touring the city during the 1960 election campaign, and took photographs of them.\n\nFollowing Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, Peel passed himself off as a reporter for the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'' in order to attend the arraignment of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]. He and a friend can be seen in the footage of the 22/23 November midnight [[press conference]] at the [[Dallas Police Department]] when Oswald was paraded before the media.<ref>{{cite interview| first= John | last= Peel| work= Fillerzine| number= 5| date= September 1996| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aHDJy0R8nQ| title= John Peel in Dallas}}</ref> He later phoned in the story to the ''Echo''.\n\nWhile working for the insurance company, Peel wrote programs for [[punched card]] entry for an [[IBM 1410]] computer (which led to his entry in ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]'' noting him as a former [[computer programmer]]), and he got his first radio job, albeit unpaid, working for [[WRR (AM)]] in Dallas. There, he presented the second hour of the Monday night programme ''Kat's Karavan'', which was primarily hosted by the American singer and radio personality [[Jim Lowe]]. Following this, and as [[Beatlemania]] hit the United States, Peel got a job with the Dallas radio station KLIF<!--wl links to Norwegian Climate and Pollution Agency--> as the official [[The Beatles|Beatles]] correspondent on the strength of his connection to Liverpool. He later worked for [[KOKC (AM)|KOMA]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], until 1965 when he moved to [[KKDD|KMEN]] in [[San Bernardino, California]], using the name John Ravencroft to present the breakfast show.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/events/peel/perfumed_garden.shtml |title=6 Music \u2013 Events \u2013 Peeling Back The Years |publisher=BBC |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Return to Britain===\nPeel returned to England in early 1967 and found work with the offshore [[UK pirate radio|pirate radio]] station [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]]. He was offered the midnight-to-two shift, which gradually developed into a programme called ''[[The Perfumed Garden (radio show)|The Perfumed Garden]]'' (some thought it was named after an erotic book famous at the time \u2013 which Peel claimed never to have read). It was on \"Big L\" that he first adopted the name \"John Peel\" (the name was suggested by a Radio London secretary) and established himself as a distinctive radio voice.\n\nPeel's show was an outlet for the music of the [[UK underground]] scene. He played classic [[blues]], [[folk music]] and [[psychedelic rock]], with an emphasis on the new music emerging from [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]]. As important as the musical content of the programme was the personal \u2013 sometimes confessional \u2013 tone of Peel's presentation, and the listener participation it engendered. Underground events he had attended during his periods of shore leave, like the [[UFO Club]] and \"[[The 14 Hour Technicolor Dream]]\", together with [[causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres]] like the drug \"busts\" of the [[Rolling Stones]] and [[John \"Hoppy\" Hopkins]], were discussed between records. All this was far removed from Radio London's daytime format. Listeners sent Peel letters, poems, and records from their own collections, so that the programme became a vehicle for two-way communication; by the final week of Radio London he was receiving far more mail than any other DJ on the station.<ref name=\"djhistory\">{{Cite web| url= http://www.djhistory.com/djhistory/archiveInterviewDisplay.php?interview_id=43| first= Bill |last= Brewster| date=30 April 2004| website= DJHistory.com |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080216184646/http://www.djhistory.com/djhistory/archiveInterviewDisplay.php?interview_id=43 | title= Archive Interviews: John Peel |archive-date=16 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nAfter the closure of Radio London in 1967, Peel wrote a column, ''The Perfumed Garden'', for the underground newspaper the ''[[International Times]]'' (from autumn 1967 to mid-1969), in which he showed himself to be a committed, if critical, supporter of the ideals of the underground. A ''Perfumed Garden'' mailing list was set up by a group of keen listeners, which facilitated contacts and gave rise to numerous small-scale, local arts projects typical of the time, including the poetry magazine ''Sol''.\n\n===BBC career===\n[[File:JP KP 4.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Peel in a record shop in [[Bochum, Germany]]]]\nWhen Radio London closed down on 14 August 1967, John Peel joined the BBC's new pop music station, [[BBC Radio 1]], which began broadcasting the following month. Unlike Big L, Radio 1 was not a full-time station, but a hybrid of recorded music and live studio orchestras. Peel recalled, \"I was one of the first lot on Radio 1 and I think it was mainly because ... Radio 1 had no real idea what they were doing so they had to take people off the pirate ships because there wasn't anybody else.\" Peel presented a programme called ''[[Top Gear (radio show)|Top Gear]]''. At first he was obliged to share presentation duties with other DJs ([[Pete Drummond]] and [[Tommy Vance]] were among his co-hosts) but in February 1968 he was given sole charge of ''Top Gear''; he continued to present the show until it ended in 1975. Peel played an eclectic mix of the music that caught his attention, which he would continue to do throughout his career.\n\nIn 1969, after hosting a trailer for a BBC programme on VD on his ''Night Ride'' programme, Peel received significant media attention because he divulged on air that he had suffered from a [[sexually transmitted disease]] earlier that year. This admission was later used in an attempt to discredit him when he appeared as a defence witness in the 1971 ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' obscenity trial.\n\nThe ''Night Ride'' programme, advertised by the BBC as an exploration of words and music, seemed to take up from where ''The Perfumed Garden'' had left off. It featured rock, folk, blues, classical and electronic music. A unique feature of the programme was the inclusion of tracks, mostly of exotic non-Western music, drawn from the [[BBC Sound Archive]]; the most popular of these were gathered on a BBC Records LP, ''John Peel's Archive Things'' (1970). ''Night Ride''  also featured poetry readings and numerous interviews with a wide range of guests, including his friends [[Marc Bolan]], journalist and musician [[Mick Farren]], poet Pete Roche, and singer-songwriter [[Bridget St John]] and stars such as [[the Byrds]], the Rolling Stones and [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]]. The programme captured much of the creative activity of the underground scene. Its anti-establishment stance and unpredictability did not find approval with the BBC hierarchy, and it ended in September 1969 after 18 months. In his sleeve notes to the ''Archive Things'' LP Peel calls the free-form nature of ''Night Ride'' his preferred radio format. His subsequent shows featured a mixture of records and live sessions, a format that would characterise his Radio 1 programmes for the rest of his career.\n\n===Punk era===\nPeel's enthusiasm for music outside the mainstream occasionally brought him into conflict with the Radio 1 hierarchy. On one occasion, the then-station controller [[Derek Chinnery]] contacted John Walters and asked him to confirm that the show was not playing any [[punk rock|punk]], which he (Chinnery) had read about in the press and of which he disapproved. Chinnery was evidently somewhat surprised by Walters' reply that in recent weeks they had been playing little else.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.simongarfield.com/assets/pdfs/books_extracts/the_nations_favourite.pdf| title= Simon Garfield interview with John Peel| format= PDF| work= Simongarfield.com| accessdate= 9 February 2013| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080626133533/http://www.simongarfield.com/assets/pdfs/books_extracts/the_nations_favourite.pdf| archive-date= 26 June 2008| url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1990 interview, Peel recalled his 1976 discovery of the first album by New York punk band the [[Ramones]] as a seminal event:\n{{quote|At that time almost all the new bands {{sic|comprised|expected=consisted| of}} people who had previously been in successful bands who had broken up then reformed.... Well I played the first Ramones LP \u2014 it was identical to the first time I had heard [[Little Richard]] \u2014 the intensity was frightening! So I played five or six tracks on the next show and immediately I received mail from people demanding that I never play stuff like that again. Whenever that happens I always go in the opposite direction, so I played more and it was great! It was a classic case of changing courses in mid-stream and in a month the average age of the audience dropped by 10 years and the whole social class changed \u2014 which I was very pleased about.<ref name=Flipside />}}\n\nIn 1979 Peel stated: \"They leave you to get on with it. I'm paid money by the BBC not to go off and work for a commercial radio station ... I wouldn't want to go to one anyway, because they wouldn't let me do what the BBC let me do.\"<ref name= \"Hepworth\">{{cite interview| interviewer= David Hepworth| last= Peel| first= John | title= Forty is More Fun: John Peel, Superfan, Talks to David Hepworth| work= [[Smash Hits]]| publisher= EMAP National Publications Ltd| date= 4\u201317 October 1979| page= 15}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:JP Peel Acres.jpg|thumb|Peel Acres in [[Great Finborough]], Suffolk]]\nPeel's reputation as an important DJ who broke unsigned acts into the mainstream was such that young hopefuls sent him an enormous number of records, CDs, and tapes. When he returned home from a three-week holiday at the end of 1986 there were 173 LPs, 91 12\"s and 179 7\"s waiting for him. In 1983 Alan Melina and Jeff Chegwin, the music publishers for then-unsigned artist [[Billy Bragg]], drove to the Radio 1 studios with a mushroom [[biryani]] and a copy of his record after hearing Peel mention that he was hungry; the subsequent airplay launched Billy Bragg's career.<ref>{{cite book| authorlink= Andrew Collins (broadcaster) | first= Andrew | last= Collins| title= Still Suitable for Miners (Billy Bragg: The Official Biography)| edition= Revised |publisher= Virgin Books| year= 2002| isbn= }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:JP Homestudio.jpg|thumb|Studio at Peel Acres]]\n\nIn addition to his Radio 1 show, Peel broadcast as a disc jockey on the [[BBC World Service]], on the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]] (''John Peel's Music on BFBS'') for 30 years, [[NPO 3FM|VPRO Radio3]] in the Netherlands, [[Radiomafia|YLE Radio Mafia]] in Finland, [[Hitradio \u00d63|\u00d63]] in Austria (Nachtexpress), and on Radio 4U, Radio Eins (Peel ...), [[Radio Bremen]] (Ritz) and some independent radio stations around FSK Hamburg in Germany. As a result of his BFBS programme he was voted, in Germany, \"Top DJ in Europe\".\n\nPeel was an occasional presenter of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' on BBC1 from the late 1960s until the 1990s, and in particular from 1982 to 1987 when he appeared regularly. In 1971 he appeared not as presenter but performer, alongside [[Faces (band)|Rod Stewart and the Faces]], pretending to play [[mandolin]] on \"[[Maggie May]]\". He often presented the BBC's television coverage of music events, notably the [[Glastonbury Festival]].\n\n===Later years===\nBetween 1995 and 1997, Peel presented ''Offspring'', a show about children, on [[BBC Radio 4]]. In 1998, ''Offspring'' grew into the magazine-style documentary show ''[[Home Truths]]''. When he took on the job presenting the programme, which was about everyday life in British families, Peel requested that it be free from celebrities, as he found real-life stories more entertaining. ''Home Truths'' was described by occasional stand-in presenter [[John Walters (broadcaster)|John Walters]] as being \"about people who had fridges called Renfrewshire\". Peel also made regular contributions to BBC Two's humorous look at the irritations of modern life ''[[Grumpy Old Men (TV show)|Grumpy Old Men]]''. His only appearances in an acting role in film or television were in [[Harry Enfield]]'s ''[[Smashie and Nicey|Smashie and Nicey: The End of an Era]]'' as John Past Bedtime, and in 1999 as a \"grumpy old man who catalogues records\" in the film ''Five Seconds to Spare''.

Peel married Sheila on 31 August 1974. The reception was in London's [[Regent's Park]], with Walters as best man. Peel wore [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] football colours (red) and walked down the aisle to the song \"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\". Their [[Herding dog|sheepdog]], Woggle, served as a [[bridesmaid]]. [[Rod Stewart]] and [[Graham Chapman]] attended.\n\nIn the 1970s, Peel and Sheila moved to a [[thatch]]ed cottage in the village of [[Great Finborough]] near [[Stowmarket]] in [[Suffolk]], nicknamed Peel Acres. In later years Peel broadcast many of his shows from a studio in the house, with Sheila and their children often being involved or at least mentioned. Peel's passion for [[Liverpool F.C.]] was reflected in his children's names: William Robert [[Anfield]], Alexandra Mary Anfield, Thomas James [[Kenny Dalglish|Dalglish]], and Florence Victoria [[Bill Shankly|Shankly]]. His later shows also regularly featured live performances (broadcast live, unlike the pre-recorded Peel sessions), mostly from BBC [[Maida Vale Studios]] in West London, but occasionally in the Peel Acres [[living room]].\n\nAt the age of 62 he was diagnosed with [[diabetes]], following many years of fatigue.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1573676.stm |title= John Peel 'relieved' to be diabetic |work=BBC News |date=1 October 2001 |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nPeel died suddenly at the age of 65 from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on 25 October 2004, on a working holiday in the [[Tahuantinsuyu|Inca]] city of [[Cusco]] in Peru. Shortly after the announcement of his death, tributes began to arrive from fans and supporters both in public and private life. On 26 October 2004 [[BBC Radio 1]] cleared its schedules to broadcast a day of tributes. London's ''Evening Standard'' boards that afternoon read \"the day the music died\", quoting [[Don McLean]]'s hit \"[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]\".\n\nPeel had often spoken wryly of his eventual death. He once said on the show ''[[Room 101 (British TV series)|Room 101]]'', \"I've always imagined I'd die by driving into the back of a truck while trying to read the name on a cassette and people would say, 'He would have wanted to go that way.' Well, I want them to know that I wouldn't.\"<ref>\"John Peel's Sounds of the Suburbs: Cornwall\", 21 March 1999. Episode 4 of an 8 part Channel 4 TV series aired in 1999 that featured Peel meeting local musicians in different parts of the UK.</ref>\n\nAt one point, he said that if he died before his producer [[John Walters (broadcaster)|John Walters]], he wanted the latter to play [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]]'s \"[[When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease]]\".<ref>{{cite web|author= |url= http://www.goodfuneralguide.co.uk/2010/07/when-an-old-cricketer-leaves-the-crease/ |title=When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease |work= The Good Funeral Guide |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> Walters having died in 2001, it was left to [[Andy Kershaw]] to end his tribute programme to Peel on [[BBC Radio 3]] with the song. Peel's stand-in on his Radio 1 slot, [[Rob da Bank]], also played the song at the start of the final show before his funeral. Another time, Peel said he would like to be remembered with a gospel song. He stated that the final record he would play would be the [[C. L. Franklin|Rev C. L. Franklin]]'s sermon \"Dry Bones in The Valley\".\n\nOn his ''Home Truths'' BBC radio show, Peel once commented about his own death: \n{{quote|I definitely want to be buried, although not yet.

The sessions originally came about due to restrictions imposed on the BBC by the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]] and [[Phonographic Performance Limited]] which represented the record companies dominated by the [[EMI]] cartel. Because of these restrictions the BBC had been forced to hire bands and orchestras to render [[cover versions]] of recorded music. The theory behind this device was that it would create employment and force people to buy records and not listen to them free of charge on the air. One of the reasons why the offshore broadcasting stations of the 1960s were called \"pirates\" was because they operated outside of British laws and were not bound by the [[needle time]] restriction on the number of records they could play on the air.\n\nThe BBC employed its own house bands and orchestras and it also engaged outside bands to record exclusive tracks for its programmes in BBC studios. This was the reason why Peel was able to use \"session men\" in his own programmes. Sessions were usually four tracks recorded and mixed in a single day; as such they often had a rough and ready, demo-like feel, somewhere between a live performance and a finished recording. During the 37 years Peel remained on [[BBC Radio 1]], over 4,000 sessions were recorded by over 2,000 artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions |title=Radio 1 \u2013 Keeping It Peel \u2013 Sessions |publisher=BBC |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> Many classic Peel Sessions have been released on record, particularly by the [[Strange Fruit Records|Strange Fruit]] label.\n\n===Festive Fifty===\n{{Main|Festive Fifty}}\nAn annual tradition of Peel's Radio 1 show was the [[Festive Fifty]]\u2014a countdown of the best tracks of the year as voted for by the listeners. Despite Peel's eclectic play list, the Festive Fifty tended to be composed largely of \"white boys with guitars\", as Peel complained in 1988. In 1991 the broadcast of the chart was cancelled due to a lack of votes, although many have speculated that it was because it didn't feature a single entry from the dance acts that Peel had been championing that year{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. Topped by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\", this Phantom Fifty was eventually broadcast at the rate of one track per programme in 1993.<ref name=\"F50\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/festive50s/ |title=Radio 1 \u2013 Keeping it Peel \u2013 Festive 50s |publisher=BBC |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref>  The 1997 chart was initially cancelled due to the lack of air-time Peel had been allocated for the period, but enough \"spontaneous\" votes were received over the phone that a Festive Thirty-One was compiled and broadcast.<ref name=\"F50\"/>\n\nPeel wrote that \"The Festive 50 dates back to what was doubtless a crisp September morning in the early-to-mid Seventies, when John Walters and I were musing on life in his uniquely squalid office. In our waggish way, we decided to mock the enthusiasm of the Radio 1 management of the time for programmes with [[alliterative]] titles. Content, we felt, was of less importance than a snappy ''Radio Times'' billing. In the course of our historic meeting we had, I imagine, some fine reasons for dismissing the idea of a Festive 40 and going instead for a Festive 50, a decision that was to ruin my Decembers for years to come, condemning me to night after night at home with a ledger, when I could have been out and about having fun, fun, fun.\"<ref>Peel, J., \"Bang Bang hits the tops\", ''[[The Times]]'' (London), {{ISSN|0140-0460}}, 2 January 1993, Features section p. SR.12.</ref>\n\nAfter his death, the Festive Fifty was continued on Radio 1 by [[Rob da Bank]], [[Huw Stephens]] and [[Ras Kwame]] for two years, but then given to Peel-inspired Internet radio station [[Dandelion Radio]], which continues to be compiled.\n\n===Dandelion Records and Strange Fruit===\nIn 1969 Peel founded [[Dandelion Records]] (named after his pet hamster) so he could release the debut album by [[Bridget St John]], which he also produced. The label released 27 albums by 18 different artists before folding in 1972. Of its albums, ''[[There is Some Fun Going Forward]]'' was a [[Sampler (record)|sampler]] intended to present its acts to a wide audience, but Dandelion was never a great success, with only two releases charting nationally: [[Medicine Head]] in the UK with \"(And the) Pictures in the Sky\" and [[Beau (guitarist)|Beau]] in [[Lebanon]] with \"1917 Revolution.\" Having had an affinity with the Manchester area from working in a cotton mill in Rochdale in 1959\nPeel signed Manchester bands [[Stack Waddy]] and [[Tractor (band)|Tractor]] to Dandelion and was always supportive of both bands throughout his life. It is alleged that Peel spotted a Rochdale postmark on the envelope containing the tape sent to him by Tractor, then called \"The Way We Live\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/northwest/series11/week2_tractor_bands.shtml|title=BBC Inside Out -|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs Peel stated:\n\n<blockquote>It was never a success financially. In fact, we lost money, if I remember correctly, on every single release bar one. I did quite like it but it was terribly indulgent. Not as indulgent as it would have been had I not had a business partner, admittedly... I liked having a label. It enabled you to put out stuff that you liked without, in those days, having to worry about whether it was going to work commercially. I've never been a good business man.</blockquote>\n\nPeel appeared on one Dandelion release: the [[David Bedford]] album ''[[Nurses Song with Elephants]]'', recorded at the Marquee Studios, as part of a group playing twenty-seven plastic pipe twirlers on the track \"Some Bright Stars for Queen's College\".\n\nIn the 1980s Peel set up [[Strange Fruit Records]] with Clive Selwood to release material recorded by the BBC for Peel Sessions.\n\n===Production (albums)===\n* 1969: ''Mike Hart Bleeds'' \u2013 [[Mike Hart (poet)|Mike Hart]]\n* 1969: ''The Year of the Great Leap Sideways'' \u2013 Occasional Word Ensemble\n* 1969: ''Soundtrack'' \u2013 [[Principal Edwards Magic Theatre]]\n* 1970: ''New Bottles Old Medicine'' \u2013 [[Medicine Head]]\n* 1970: ''Burnin' Red Ivanhoe'' \u2013 Burnin' Red Ivanhoe (co-produced w/ [[Tony Reeves]])\n* 1970: ''The Asmoto Running Band'' \u2013 [[Principal Edwards Magic Theatre]]\n* 1972: ''[[Bugger Off!]]'' \u2013 [[Stack Waddy]]\n\nJohn Peel is sometimes confused with the more prolific record producer Jonathan Peel, who was an in-house music producer for [[EMI]] before going freelance in 1970.<ref>Billboard, 30 May 1970</ref>\n\n===Favourite music===\nJohn Peel wrote in his autobiography, ''[[Margrave]] of the Marshes'', that the band of which he owned the most records was [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]]. Regulars in the [[Festive 50]], and easily recognised by vocalist [[Mark E. Smith]]'s distinctive delivery, The Fall became synonymous with Peel's Radio 1 show through the 1980s and 1990s. Peel kept in contact with many of the artists he championed but only met Smith on two, apparently awkward, occasions.\n\n[[The Misunderstood]] is the only band that Peel ever personally managed\u2014he first met the band in Riverside, California in 1966 and convinced them to move to London. He championed their music throughout his career; in 1968, he described their 1966 single \"[[I Can Take You to the Sun]]\" as \"the best popular record that's ever been recorded.\"<ref>John Peel, ''[[Top Gear (radio show)|Top Gear]]'' ([[BBC Radio 1]]), 8 November 1968.</ref> and shortly before his death, he stated, \"If I had to list the ten greatest performances I've seen in my life, one would be The Misunderstood at Pandora's Box, Hollywood, 1966 ... My god, they were a great band!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmagazine.com/interviews/john_peel.shtml |title=Index Magazine - John Peel Interview |publisher=Index Magazine | date=2003 |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nHis favourite single is widely known to have been \"[[Teenage Kicks]]\" by [[The Undertones]]; in an interview in 2001, he stated \"There's nothing you could add to it or subtract from it that would improve it.\"<ref name=\"guardian1\"/>  In the same 2001 interview, he also listed \"No More Ghettos in America\" by Stanley Winston, \"[[There Must Be Thousands]]\" by [[The Quads]] and \"Lonely Saturday Night\" by Don French as being among his all-time favourites. He also described [[Lianne Hall]] as one of the great English voices.\n\nIn 1997 ''[[The Guardian]]'' asked Peel to list his top 20 albums. He listed [[Captain Beefheart]]'s ''[[Trout Mask Replica]]'' as his number 1, having previously described it as \"a work of art\". The top 20 also included LPs by [[The Velvet Underground]], [[The Ramones]], [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], [[Misty in Roots]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Neil Young]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Four Brothers (band)|The Four Brothers]], [[Dave Clarke (techno DJ)|Dave Clarke]], [[Richard and Linda Thompson]] and [[The Rolling Stones]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/oct/12/johnpeel.popandrock |title=The Peel detective |last1=Dennis |first1=Jon|date=12 October 2005 |website=[[theguardian.com]] |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nA longer list of his favourite singles was revealed in 2005 when the contents of a wooden box in which he stored the records that meant the most to him were made public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/peel2005.htm |title=Rocklist.net...The Records That John Peel Loved The Most |publisher=Rocklistmusic.co.uk |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> The box was the subject of a television documentary, ''[[John Peel's Record Box]]''.

At the NME awards in 2005 he was Hero of the Year and was posthumously given a special award for \"Lifelong Service To Music\". At the same event the \"John Peel Award For Musical Innovation\" was awarded to [[The Others (band)|The Others]].\n\nHe was awarded many [[honorary degree]]s including an MA from the [[University of East Anglia]], doctorates ([[Anglia Ruskin University|Anglia Polytechnic University]] and [[Sheffield Hallam University]]), various honorary degrees ([[University of Liverpool]], [[Open University]], [[University of Portsmouth]], [[University of Bradford]]) and a fellowship of [[Liverpool John Moores University]].\n\nHe was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 1998, for his services to British music.
