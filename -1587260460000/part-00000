{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{in use}}\n{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987.

This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life.

A [[Underwater camouflage#Transparency|transparency]] effect can be achieved by silvering to make an animal's body highly reflective.

The mirrors consist of microscopic structures similar to those used to provide [[structural coloration]]: stacks of between 5 and 10 crystals of [[guanine]] spaced about \u00bc of a wavelength apart to interfere constructively and achieve nearly 100 per cent reflection. In the deep waters that the hatchetfish lives in, only blue light with a wavelength of 500 nanometres percolates down and needs to be reflected, so mirrors 125 nanometres apart provide good camouflage.<ref name=Herring2002 />\n\nMost fish in the upper ocean are camouflaged by silvering. In fish such as the [[herring]], which lives in shallower water, the mirrors must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks with a range of different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally.

The experiment showed that the surface with denticles experienced a 10% drag reduction overall versus the smooth sample. The reason for this drag reduction was due to the fact that the turbulent vortices became trapped between the denticles creating a \u2018cushion like\u2019 barrier against the laminar flow.<ref>{{cite web |title=Experimental investigations on drag-reduction characteristics of bionic surface with water-trapping microstructures of fish scales |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-30490-x.pdf}}</ref> This same type of experiment was performed by another research group which implemented more variation in their biomimetic sample.

The mechanism is complex and not yet understood fully. Basically, the riblets inhibit the vortex formation near the surface because the vortex cannot fit in the valleys formed by the riblets. This pushes the vortex further up from the surface, interacting only with the riblet tips, not causing any high-velocity flow in the valleys. Since this high velocity flow now only interacts with the riblet-tip, which is a very small surface area, the momentum transfer which causes drag is now much lower than before, thereby effectively reducing drag. Also, this reduces the cross-stream velocity fluctuations, which aids in momentum transfer too.<ref name=\"Motta 1096\u20131110\"/>\n\nRecent research has shown that there is a pre and post breakdown regime in the near-wall boundary layer where the [[Laminar sublayer|sublayer]] thickens at a declining rate and then abruptly undergoes a breakdown into turbulent vortices before finally collapsing. This system is completely self regulating and mediates the growth and decay cycle; the vortices accumulate during the growth period and abruptly liquidated in into [[Strouhal number|Strouhal arrays]] of hairpin vortices lifting off the wall. Lifting vortices are what push the boundary layer out and away from the surface of the shark which results in reducing the overall drag experienced by the fish.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bandyopadhyay |first1=Promode R. |last2=Hellum |first2=Aren M. |title=Modeling how shark and dolphin skin patterns control transitional wall-turbulence vorticity patterns using spatiotemporal phase reset mechanisms |journal=Scientific Reports |date=23 October 2014 |volume=4 |pages=6650 |doi=10.1038/srep06650 |pmid=25338940 |pmc=4206846 |language=en |issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2014NatSR...4E6650B }}</ref>\n\nThe rough, [[sandpaper]]-like texture of shark and ray skin, coupled with its toughness, has led it to be valued as a source of rawhide [[leather]], called [[shagreen]].

Unlike the scales of fish, which are formed from the epidermis, scutes are formed in the lower vascular layer of the skin and the epidermal element is only the top surface. Forming in the living dermis, the scutes produce a horny outer layer, that is superficially similar to that of scales.\n\nScute comes from Latin for ''shield'', and can take the form of:\n* an external shield-like bony plate, or\n* a modified, thickened scale that often is keeled or spiny, or\n* a projecting, modified (rough and strongly ridged) scale, usually associated with the lateral line, or on the caudal peduncle forming caudal keels, or along the ventral profile.\n\nSome fish, such as [[pineconefish]], are completely or partially covered in scutes. [[Alosa|River herrings]] and [[threadfin]]s have an abdominal row of scutes, which are scales with raised, sharp points that are used for protection. Some [[Carangidae|jacks]] have a row of scutes following the [[lateral line]] on either side.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Scale development==\nScales typically appear late in the development of fish. In the case of [[zebrafish]], it takes 30 days after fertilization before the different layers needed to start forming the scales have differentiated and become organized. For this it is necessary that consolidation of the [[mesenchyme]] occurs, then [[morphogenesis]] is induced, and finally the process of differentiation or late [[metamorphosis]] occurs.<ref name=Sire2003>{{cite journal | last1 = Sire | first1 = J.Y. | last2 = Huysseune | first2 = A.N.N. | year = 2003 | title = Formation of dermal skeletal and dental tissues in fish: a comparative and evolutionary approach | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/749e30fdc482df364ba26877d9b2bf8697648522| journal = Biological Reviews | volume = 78 | issue = 2| pages = 219\u2013249 | doi = 10.1017/S1464793102006073 | pmid = 12803422 }}</ref><ref name=Guellec2004>{{cite journal | last1 = Le Guellec | first1 = D. | last2 = Morvan-Dubois | first2 = G. | last3 = Sire | first3 = J.Y. | year = 2004 | title = Skin development in bony fish with particular emphasis on collagen deposition in the dermis of the zebrafish (''Danio rerio'') | url = http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/paper/15272388/skin-development-in-bony-fish-with-particular-emphasis-on-collagen-deposition-in-the-dermis-of-the-zebrafish-danio-rerio | journal = International Journal of Developmental Biology | volume = 48 | issue = 2\u20133| pages = 217\u2013231 | doi = 10.1387/ijdb.15272388 | pmid = 15272388 }}</ref>\n\n* Mesenchyme consolidation: The consolidation or structuring of the mesenchyme originates during the development of the [[dermis]]. This process depends on whether the fish is cartilaginous or bony. For cartilaginous fish the structuring originates through the formation of two layers. The first is superficial and wide and the second is thin and compact. These two layers are separated by [[mesenchymal cell]]s. Bony fish generate an [[acellular]] substrate organized by perpendicularly by [[collagen fiber]]s. Subsequently, for both fish the [[fibroblast]]s elongate.

Morphogenesis begins at the time when fibroblasts are relocated to the upper part of the compact mesenchyme. Throughout this process, the [[Stratum basale|basal cell]]s of the [[epithelium]] form a delimiting layer, which is located in the upper part of the mesenchyme. Subsequently, these cells will differentiate in the area where the scale [[primordium]] will arise.<ref name=Sire2003 /><ref name=Guellec2004 /><ref name=Sire2001/>\n* Differentiation or late metamorphosis: This differentiation is generated by two different forms according to the type of scale being formed. The formation of elasmoid scales (cycloids and ctenoids) occurs through the formation of a space between the matrix of the epidermal papilla. This space contains collagen fibers. Around this space elasmoblasts differentiate and are responsible for generating the necessary material for the formation of the scale. Subsequently, [[Mineralized tissue|matrix mineralization]] occurs, allowing the scale to acquire the rigid characteristic that identifies them.<ref name=Sire2003 /><ref name=Guellec2004 /><ref name=Sire2001/>\n\nUnlike elasmoid scales, [[#Ganoid scales|ganoid scales]] are composed of mineralized and non-mineralized collagen in different regions. The formation of these occurs through the entry of the surface cells of the mesenchyme into the matrix, the latter is composed of collagen fibers and is located around the vascular capillaries, thus giving rise to vascular cavities. At this point, elasmoblasts are replaced by [[osteoblast]]s, thus forming bone. The patches of the matrix of the scale that are not [[ossified]], are composed of compacted collagen that allow it to maintain the union with the mesenchyme.

They are present in some [[lobe-finned fish]]es, such as all extant and some extinct [[lungfish]]es, as well as the [[coelacanth]]s which have modified cosmoid scales that lack cosmine and are thinner than true cosmoid scales. They are also present in some tetrapodomorphs like ''[[Eusthenopteron]]'', amiids, and teleosts, whose cycloid and ctenoid scales represent the least mineralized elasmoid scales.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Ganoid scales==\n[[File:Spotted Gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) (3149758934).jpg|thumb| The scales of this [[spotted gar]] appear glassy due to ganoine]]\n[[File:Mineral texture of ganoine layers in the scales of an alligator gar..tif|thumb| Mineral texture of ganoine layers in the scales of an [[alligator gar]]]]\n\nGanoid scales are found in the [[sturgeon]]s, [[paddlefish]]es, [[gar]]s, [[bowfin]], and [[bichir]]s.

Reflection through silvering is widespread or dominant in fish of the open sea, especially those that live in the top 100 metres. A [[Underwater camouflage#Transparency|transparency]] effect can be achieved by silvering to make an animal's body highly reflective. At medium depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side.<ref name=Herring2002>{{cite book |last1=Herring |first1=Peter |authorlink=Peter Herring |year=2002 |title=The Biology of the Deep Ocean |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780198549567 |pages=193\u2013195}}</ref>\n\nThe [[marine hatchetfish]] is extremely flattened laterally (side to side), leaving the body just millimetres thick, and the body is so silvery as to resemble [[aluminium foil]]. The mirrors consist of microscopic structures similar to those used to provide [[structural coloration]]: stacks of between 5 and 10 crystals of [[guanine]] spaced about \u00bc of a wavelength apart to interfere constructively and achieve nearly 100 per cent reflection. In the deep waters that the hatchetfish lives in, only blue light with a wavelength of 500 nanometres percolates down and needs to be reflected, so mirrors 125 nanometres apart provide good camouflage.<ref name=Herring2002 />\n\nMost fish in the upper ocean are camouflaged by silvering. In fish such as the [[herring]], which lives in shallower water, the mirrors must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks with a range of different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors, all oriented vertically.<ref name=Herring2002 />\n\nFish scales with these properties are used in some cosmetics, since they can give a shimmering effect to makeup and lipstick.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/23/fish-scales-lipstick_n_7126716.html|title=There Are Probably Fish Scales In Your Lipstick|date=2015-04-23|website=HuffPost India|language=en|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref>\n\n==Placoid scales==\n<!-- NOTE: The highly-used redirect [[Dermal denticle]] redirects to this section - if you change the section title, change the redirect to match! -->\n[[File:Denticules cutan\u00e9s du requin citron Negaprion brevirostris vus au microscope \u00e9lectronique \u00e0 balayage.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Placoid scales as viewed through an electron microscope.

The outermost layer is composed of [[vitrodentine]], a largely inorganic [[Tooth enamel|enamel]]-like substance.

The scales with higher flexibility have a smaller base, and thus are less rigidly attached to the ''stratum laxum.'' \u00a0On the crown of the fast-swimming sharks there are a series of parallel riblets or ridges which run from an anterior to posterior direction.<ref name=\"Motta 1096\u20131110\">{{Cite journal|last=Motta|first=Philip|last2=Habegger|first2=Maria Laura|last3=Lang|first3=Amy|last4=Hueter|first4=Robert|last5=Davis|first5=Jessica|date=2012-10-01|title=Scale morphology and flexibility in the shortfin mako Isurus oxyrinchus and the blacktip shark Carcharhinus limbatus|journal=Journal of Morphology|language=en|volume=273|issue=10|pages=1096\u20131110|doi=10.1002/jmor.20047|pmid=22730019|issn=1097-4687}}</ref>\n\nAnalyzing the three components of the scale it can be concluded that the base of the denticle does not come into contact with any portion of the fluid flow.<ref name=\"Bionic Research on Fish Scales for\">{{cite journal |last1=Dou |first1=Zhaoliang |last2=Wang |first2=Jiadao |last3=Chen |first3=Darong |title=Bionic Research on Fish Scales for Drag Reduction |journal=Journal of Bionic Engineering |date=1 December 2012 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=457\u2013464 |doi=10.1016/S1672-6529(11)60140-6 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1672652911601406 |issn=1672-6529}}</ref> The crown and the neck of the denticles however play a key role and are responsible for creating the turbulent vortices and [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] found near the skin's surface.<ref name=\"Bionic Research on Fish Scales for\"/> Due to the fact that denticles come in so many different shapes and sizes, it can be expected that not all shapes will produce the same type of [[Turbulence|turbulent flow]]. During a recent research experiment [[Biomimetics|biomimetic]] samples of shark denticles with a crescent like microstructure and tested in a water tank using a traction table as a slide. The experiment showed that the surface with denticles experienced a 10% drag reduction overall versus the smooth sample. The reason for this drag reduction was due to the fact that the turbulent vortices became trapped between the denticles creating a \u2018cushion like\u2019 barrier against the laminar flow.<ref>{{cite web |title=Experimental investigations on drag-reduction characteristics of bionic surface with water-trapping microstructures of fish scales |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-30490-x.pdf}}</ref> This same type of experiment was performed by another research group which implemented more variation in their biomimetic sample. The second group arrived at the same conclusion as the first however because their experiment contained more variation within the samples they were able to achieve a high degree of experimental accuracy. In conclusion they stated that more practical shapes were more durable than ones with intricate ridge-lines. The practical shapes were low profile and contained trapezoidal or semi-circular trough-like cross section and were less effective but nonetheless reduced drag by 6 or 7%.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Palmer |first1=Colin |last2=Young |first2=Mark T. |title=Surface drag reduction and flow separation control in pelagic vertebrates, with implications for interpreting scale morphologies in fossil taxa |journal=Royal Society Open Science |date=14 January 2015 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=140163 |doi=10.1098/rsos.140163 |pmid=26064576 |pmc=4448786 |issn=2054-5703|bibcode=2015RSOS....240163P }}</ref>\n\n====Drag reduction====\n[[File:Boundary Layer Fr.svg|thumb|right|Effects of Turbulent Flow on Boundary Layer]]\nSharks decrease drag and overall [[cost of transport]] (COT) through multiple different avenues.

The mechanism is complex and not yet understood fully. Basically, the riblets inhibit the vortex formation near the surface because the vortex cannot fit in the valleys formed by the riblets. This pushes the vortex further up from the surface, interacting only with the riblet tips, not causing any high-velocity flow in the valleys. Since this high velocity flow now only interacts with the riblet-tip, which is a very small surface area, the momentum transfer which causes drag is now much lower than before, thereby effectively reducing drag. Also, this reduces the cross-stream velocity fluctuations, which aids in momentum transfer too.<ref name=\"Motta 1096\u20131110\"/>\n\nRecent research has shown that there is a pre and post breakdown regime in the near-wall boundary layer where the [[Laminar sublayer|sublayer]] thickens at a declining rate and then abruptly undergoes a breakdown into turbulent vortices before finally collapsing. This system is completely self regulating and mediates the growth and decay cycle; the vortices accumulate during the growth period and abruptly liquidated in into [[Strouhal number|Strouhal arrays]] of hairpin vortices lifting off the wall. Lifting vortices are what push the boundary layer out and away from the surface of the shark which results in reducing the overall drag experienced by the fish.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bandyopadhyay |first1=Promode R. |last2=Hellum |first2=Aren M. |title=Modeling how shark and dolphin skin patterns control transitional wall-turbulence vorticity patterns using spatiotemporal phase reset mechanisms |journal=Scientific Reports |date=23 October 2014 |volume=4 |pages=6650 |doi=10.1038/srep06650 |pmid=25338940 |pmc=4206846 |language=en |issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2014NatSR...4E6650B }}</ref>\n\nThe rough, [[sandpaper]]-like texture of shark and ray skin, coupled with its toughness, has led it to be valued as a source of rawhide [[leather]], called [[shagreen]].

Unlike the scales of fish, which are formed from the epidermis, scutes are formed in the lower vascular layer of the skin and the epidermal element is only the top surface. Forming in the living dermis, the scutes produce a horny outer layer, that is superficially similar to that of scales.\n\nScute comes from Latin for ''shield'', and can take the form of:\n* an external shield-like bony plate, or\n* a modified, thickened scale that often is keeled or spiny, or\n* a projecting, modified (rough and strongly ridged) scale, usually associated with the lateral line, or on the caudal peduncle forming caudal keels, or along the ventral profile.\n\nSome fish, such as [[pineconefish]], are completely or partially covered in scutes. [[Alosa|River herrings]] and [[threadfin]]s have an abdominal row of scutes, which are scales with raised, sharp points that are used for protection. Some [[Carangidae|jacks]] have a row of scutes following the [[lateral line]] on either side.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Scale development==\nScales typically appear late in the development of fish. In the case of [[zebrafish]], it takes 30 days after fertilization before the different layers needed to start forming the scales have differentiated and become organized. For this it is necessary that consolidation of the [[mesenchyme]] occurs, then [[morphogenesis]] is induced, and finally the process of differentiation or late [[metamorphosis]] occurs.<ref name=Sire2003>{{cite journal | last1 = Sire | first1 = J.Y. | last2 = Huysseune | first2 = A.N.N. | year = 2003 | title = Formation of dermal skeletal and dental tissues in fish: a comparative and evolutionary approach | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/749e30fdc482df364ba26877d9b2bf8697648522| journal = Biological Reviews | volume = 78 | issue = 2| pages = 219\u2013249 | doi = 10.1017/S1464793102006073 | pmid = 12803422 }}</ref><ref name=Guellec2004>{{cite journal | last1 = Le Guellec | first1 = D. | last2 = Morvan-Dubois | first2 = G. | last3 = Sire | first3 = J.Y. | year = 2004 | title = Skin development in bony fish with particular emphasis on collagen deposition in the dermis of the zebrafish (''Danio rerio'') | url = http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/paper/15272388/skin-development-in-bony-fish-with-particular-emphasis-on-collagen-deposition-in-the-dermis-of-the-zebrafish-danio-rerio | journal = International Journal of Developmental Biology | volume = 48 | issue = 2\u20133| pages = 217\u2013231 | doi = 10.1387/ijdb.15272388 | pmid = 15272388 }}</ref>\n\n* Mesenchyme consolidation: The consolidation or structuring of the mesenchyme originates during the development of the [[dermis]]. This process depends on whether the fish is cartilaginous or bony. For cartilaginous fish the structuring originates through the formation of two layers. The first is superficial and wide and the second is thin and compact. These two layers are separated by [[mesenchymal cell]]s. Bony fish generate an [[acellular]] substrate organized by perpendicularly by [[collagen fiber]]s. Subsequently, for both fish the [[fibroblast]]s elongate. These penetrate the compact layer of the mesenchyme, which consolidates prior to the formation of the scale, in order to initiate the dermal plate.<ref name=Sire2003 /><ref name=Guellec2004 /><ref name=Sire2001>{{cite journal | last1 = Sire | first1 = J.Y. | year = 2001 | title = Teeth outside the mouth in teleost fishes: how to benefit from a developmental accident | url = | journal = Evolution & Development | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 104\u2013108 | doi = 10.1046/j.1525-142x.2001.003002104.x | pmid = 11341672 }}</ref>\n* Morphogenesis induction: The morphogenesis is due to the formation of the epidermal [[Papilla (fish anatomy)|papilla]], which is generated by joining the [[epidermis]] and [[dermis]] through a process of [[invagination]]. Morphogenesis begins at the time when fibroblasts are relocated to the upper part of the compact mesenchyme. Throughout this process, the [[Stratum basale|basal cell]]s of the [[epithelium]] form a delimiting layer, which is located in the upper part of the mesenchyme. Subsequently, these cells will differentiate in the area where the scale [[primordium]] will arise.<ref name=Sire2003 /><ref name=Guellec2004 /><ref name=Sire2001/>\n* Differentiation or late metamorphosis: This differentiation is generated by two different forms according to the type of scale being formed. The formation of elasmoid scales (cycloids and ctenoids) occurs through the formation of a space between the matrix of the epidermal papilla. This space contains collagen fibers. Around this space elasmoblasts differentiate and are responsible for generating the necessary material for the formation of the scale. Subsequently, [[Mineralized tissue|matrix mineralization]] occurs, allowing the scale to acquire the rigid characteristic that identifies them.<ref name=Sire2003 /><ref name=Guellec2004 /><ref name=Sire2001/>\n\nUnlike elasmoid scales, [[#Ganoid scales|ganoid scales]] are composed of mineralized and non-mineralized collagen in different regions. The formation of these occurs through the entry of the surface cells of the mesenchyme into the matrix, the latter is composed of collagen fibers and is located around the vascular capillaries, thus giving rise to vascular cavities. At this point, elasmoblasts are replaced by [[osteoblast]]s, thus forming bone. The patches of the matrix of the scale that are not [[ossified]], are composed of compacted collagen that allow it to maintain the union with the mesenchyme. This are known as [[Sharpey fibers]].<ref name=Sire2003 /><ref name=Guellec2004 /><ref name=Sire2001/>\n\nOne of the genes that regulate the development of scale formation in fish is the [[sonic hedgehog]] (shh) gene, which by means of the (shh) protein, involved in [[organogenesis]] and in the process of [[cellular communication]], enable the formation of the scales.<ref name=Sire2003b>{{cite journal | last1 = Sire | first1 = J.Y. | last2 = Akimenko | first2 = M.A. | year = 2003 | title = Scale development in fish: a review, with description of sonic hedgehog (shh) expression in the zebrafish (''Danio rerio'') | journal = International Journal of Developmental Biology | volume = 48 | issue = 2\u20133| pages = 233\u2013247 | doi = 10.1387/ijdb.15272389 | pmid = 15272389 }}</ref><ref name=Monnot1999>{{cite journal | last1 = Monnot | first1 = M.J. | last2 = Babin | first2 = P.J. | last3 = Poleo | first3 = G. | last4 = Andre | first4 = M. | last5 = Laforest | first5 = L. | last6 = Ballagny | first6 = C. | last7 = Akimenko | first7 = M.A. | year = 1999 | title = Epidermal expression of apolipoprotein E gene during fin and scale development and fin regeneration in zebrafish | url = | journal = Developmental Dynamics | volume = 214 | issue = 3| pages = 207\u2013215 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0177(199903)214:3<207::AID-AJA4>3.0.CO;2-5 }}</ref> The [[apolipoprotein E]] (ApoE), that allows the transport and metabolism of [[triglyceride]]s and [[cholesterol]], has an interaction with shh, because ApoE provides cholesterol to the [[Hedgehog signaling pathway|shh signaling pathway]].

For specific usage domains, the storage of entire words or sentences allows for high-quality output.

The ideal speech synthesizer is both natural and intelligible. Speech synthesis systems usually try to maximize both characteristics.\n\nThe two primary technologies generating synthetic speech waveforms are ''concatenative synthesis'' and ''[[formant]] synthesis''. Each technology has strengths and weaknesses, and the intended uses of a synthesis system will typically determine which approach is used.\n\n=== Concatenation synthesis ===\n{{main|Concatenative synthesis}}\nConcatenative synthesis is based on the [[concatenation]] (or stringing together) of segments of recorded speech. Generally, concatenative synthesis produces the most natural-sounding synthesized speech. However, differences between natural variations in speech and the nature of the automated techniques for segmenting the waveforms sometimes result in audible glitches in the output. There are three main sub-types of concatenative synthesis.\n\n==== Unit selection synthesis ====\n\nUnit selection synthesis uses large [[database]]s of recorded speech. During database creation, each recorded utterance is segmented into some or all of the following: individual [[phone (phonetics)|phones]], [[diphone]]s, half-phones, [[syllable]]s, [[morpheme]]s, [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, and [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s. Typically, the division into segments is done using a specially modified [[speech recognition|speech recognizer]] set to a \"forced alignment\" mode with some manual correction afterward, using visual representations such as the [[waveform]] and [[spectrogram]].<ref>[[Alan W. Black]], [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/papers/IEEE2002/allthetime/allthetime.html Perfect synthesis for all of the people all of the time.] IEEE TTS Workshop 2002.</ref> An [[index (database)|index]] of the units in the speech database is then created based on the segmentation and acoustic parameters like the [[fundamental frequency]] ([[pitch (music)|pitch]]), duration, position in the syllable, and neighboring phones. At [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]], the desired target utterance is created by determining the best chain of candidate units from the database (unit selection). This process is typically achieved using a specially weighted [[decision tree]].\n\nUnit selection provides the greatest naturalness, because it applies only a small amount of [[digital signal processing]] (DSP) to the recorded speech. DSP often makes recorded speech sound less natural, although some systems use a small amount of signal processing at the point of concatenation to smooth the waveform. The output from the best unit-selection systems is often indistinguishable from real human voices, especially in contexts for which the TTS system has been tuned. However, maximum naturalness typically require unit-selection speech databases to be very large, in some systems ranging into the [[gigabyte]]s of recorded data, representing dozens of hours of speech.<ref>John Kominek and [[Alan W. Black]]. (2003). CMU ARCTIC databases for speech synthesis. CMU-LTI-03-177.

The number of diphones depends on the [[phonotactics]] of the language: for example, Spanish has about 800 diphones, and German about 2500. In diphone synthesis, only one example of each diphone is contained in the speech database. At runtime, the target [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of a sentence is superimposed on these minimal units by means of [[digital signal processing]] techniques such as [[linear predictive coding]], [[PSOLA]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/PSOLA.html |title=Pitch-Synchronous Overlap and Add (PSOLA) Synthesis |accessdate=2008-05-28 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222180903/http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/PSOLA.html |archivedate=February 22, 2007 }}</ref> or [[MBROLA]].<ref>T.

It is used in applications where the variety of texts the system will output is limited to a particular domain, like transit schedule announcements or weather reports.<ref>L.F. Lamel, J.L. Gauvain, B. Prouts, C. Bouhier, R. Boesch. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.53.6101&rep=rep1&type=pdf Generation and Synthesis of Broadcast Messages], ''Proceedings ESCA-NATO Workshop and Applications of Speech Technology'', September 1993.</ref>  The technology is very simple to implement, and has been in commercial use for a long time, in devices like talking clocks and calculators. The level of naturalness of these systems can be very high because the variety of sentence types is limited, and they closely match the prosody and intonation of the original recordings.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nBecause these systems are limited by the words and phrases in their databases, they are not general-purpose and can only synthesize the combinations of words and phrases with which they have been preprogrammed. The blending of words within naturally spoken language however can still cause problems unless the many variations are taken into account. For example, in [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]] dialects of English the ''\"r\"'' in words like ''\"clear\"'' {{IPA|/\u02c8kl\u026a\u0259/}} is usually only pronounced when the following word has a vowel as its first letter (e.g. ''\"clear out\"'' is realized as {{IPA|/\u02cckl\u026a\u0259\u0279\u02c8\u028c\u028at/}}). Likewise in [[French language|French]], many final consonants become no longer silent if followed by a word that begins with a vowel, an effect called [[Liaison (French)|liaison]]. This [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]] cannot be reproduced by a simple word-concatenation system, which would require additional complexity to be [[context-sensitive grammar|context-sensitive]].\n\n=== Formant synthesis ===\n\n[[Formant]] synthesis does not use human speech samples at runtime. Instead, the synthesized speech output is created using [[additive synthesis]] and an acoustic model ([[physical modelling synthesis]]).<ref>Dartmouth College: [http://digitalmusics.dartmouth.edu/~book/MATCpages/chap.4/4.4.formant_synth.html ''Music and Computers''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608035309/http://digitalmusics.dartmouth.edu/~book/MATCpages/chap.4/4.4.formant_synth.html |date=2011-06-08 }}, 1993.</ref> Parameters such as [[fundamental frequency]], [[phonation|voicing]], and [[noise]] levels are varied over time to create a [[waveform]] of artificial speech. This method is sometimes called ''rules-based synthesis''; however, many concatenative systems also have rules-based components.\nMany systems based on formant synthesis technology generate artificial, robotic-sounding speech that would never be mistaken for human speech. However, maximum naturalness is not always the goal of a speech synthesis system, and formant synthesis systems have advantages over concatenative systems. Formant-synthesized speech can be reliably intelligible, even at very high speeds, avoiding the acoustic glitches that commonly plague concatenative systems. High-speed synthesized speech is used by the visually impaired to quickly navigate computers using a [[screen reader]]. Formant synthesizers are usually smaller programs than concatenative systems because they do not have a database of speech samples. They can therefore be used in [[embedded system]]s, where [[data storage device|memory]] and [[microprocessor]] power are especially limited. Because formant-based systems have complete control of all aspects of the output speech, a wide variety of prosodies and [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]s can be output, conveying not just questions and statements, but a variety of emotions and tones of voice.\n\nExamples of non-real-time but highly accurate intonation control in formant synthesis include the work done in the late 1970s for the [[Texas Instruments]] toy [[Speak & Spell (game)|Speak & Spell]], and in the early 1980s [[Sega]] [[Video arcade|arcade]] machines<ref>Examples include [[Astro Blaster]], [[Space Fury]], and [[Star Trek (arcade game)|Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator]]</ref> and in many [[Atari, Inc.]] arcade games<ref>Examples include [[Star Wars (arcade game)|Star Wars]], [[Firefox (arcade game)|Firefox]], [[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (arcade game)|Return of the Jedi]], [[Road Runner (video game)|Road Runner]], [[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (arcade game)|The Empire Strikes Back]], [[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (arcade game)|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]], [[720\u00b0]], [[Gauntlet (arcade game)|Gauntlet]], [[Gauntlet II]], [[A.P.B.

The first articulatory synthesizer regularly used for laboratory experiments was developed at [[Haskins Laboratories]] in the mid-1970s by [[Philip Rubin]], Tom Baer, and Paul Mermelstein. This synthesizer, known as ASY, was based on vocal tract models developed at [[Bell Laboratories]] in the 1960s and 1970s by Paul Mermelstein, Cecil Coker, and colleagues.\n\nUntil recently, articulatory synthesis models have not been incorporated into commercial speech synthesis systems. A notable exception is the [[NeXT]]-based system originally developed and marketed by Trillium Sound Research, a spin-off company of the [[University of Calgary]], where much of the original research was conducted. Following the demise of the various incarnations of NeXT (started by [[Steve Jobs]] in the late 1980s and merged with Apple Computer in 1997), the Trillium software was published under the GNU General Public License, with work continuing as [[gnuspeech]]. The system, first marketed in 1994, provides full articulatory-based text-to-speech conversion using a waveguide or transmission-line analog of the human oral and nasal tracts controlled by Carr\u00e9's \"distinctive region model\".\n\nMore recent synthesizers, developed by Jorge C. Lucero and colleagues, incorporate models of vocal fold biomechanics, glottal aerodynamics and acoustic wave propagation in the bronqui, traquea, nasal and oral cavities, and thus constitute full systems of physics-based speech simulation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cic.unb.br/~lucero/papers/768_Paper.pdf|title = Physics-based synthesis of disordered voices|last = Lucero|first = J.

===\n\n==== Formulation ====\nGiven an input text or some sequence of linguistic unit <math>Y</math>, the target speech <math>X</math> can be derived by \n\n<math>X=\\arg\\max P(X|Y, \\theta)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta</math> is the model parameter.\n\nTypically, the input text will first be passed to an acoustic feature generator, \nthen the acoustic features are passed to the neural vocoder.\nFor the acoustic feature generator, the [[Loss function]] is typically L1 or L2 loss.\nThese loss functions put a constraint that the output acoustic feature distributions must be Gaussian or Laplacian.\nIn practice, since the human voice band ranges from approximately 300 to 4000 Hz, \nthe loss function will be designed to have more penality on this range:\n\n<math>loss=\\alpha loss_{human} + (1 - \\alpha) loss_{other}</math>\n\nwhere <math>loss_{human}</math> is the loss from human voice band and <math>\\alpha</math> is a scalar typically around 0.5.\nThe acoustic feature is typically [[Spectrogram]] or spectrogram in [[Mel scale]].\nThese features capture the time-frequency relation of speech signal and thus, \nit is sufficient to generate intelligent outputs with these acoustic features.\nThe [[Mel-frequency cepstrum]] feature used in the speech recognition task is not suitable for speech synthesis because it reduces too much information.\n\n==== Brief History ====\nIn September 2016, [[DeepMind]] proposed [https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499 WaveNet], a deep generative model of raw audio waveforms. \nThis shows the community that deep learning-based models have the capability to model raw waveforms and perform well on generating speech from acoustic features like spectrograms or spectrograms in mel scale, \nor even from some preprocessed linguistic features. \nIn early 2017, [[Mila (research institute)]] proposed [https://mila.quebec/en/publication/char2wav-end-to-end-speech-synthesis/ char2wav], \na model to produce raw waveform in an end-to-end method. \nAlso, [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] proposed [https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10135 Tacotron] and [https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06588 VoiceLoop], respectively, \nto generate acoustic features directly from the input text.\nIn the later in the same year, Google proposed [https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05884 Tacotron2] which combined the WaveNet vocoder with the revised Tacotron architecture to perform end-to-end speech synthesis.\nTacotron2 can generate high-quality speech approaching the human voice. \nSince then, end-to-end methods became the hottest research topic because many researchers around the world start to notice the power of the end-to-end speech synthesizer.\n\n==== Advantages and Disadvantages ====\n\nThe advantages of end-to-end methods are as follows:\n* Only need a single model to perform text analysis, acoustic modeling and audio synthesis, i.e. synthesizing speech directly from characters\n** Less feature engineering\n** Easily allows for rich conditioning on various attributes, e.g. speaker or language\n** Adaptation to new data is easier\n** More robust than multi-stage models because no component's error can compound\n* Powerful model capacity to capture the hidden internal structures of data\n* Capable to generate intelligible and natural speech\n* No need to maintain a large database, i.e. small footprint\n\nDespite there are many advantages mentioned, end-to-end methods still have many challenges to be solved:\n* Auto-regressive-based models suffer from slow inference problem\n* Output speech are not robust when data are not sufficient\n* Lack of controllability compared with traditional concatenative and statistical parametric approaches\n* Tend to learn the flat prosody by averaging over training data\n* Tend to output smoothed acoustic features because the l1 or l2 loss is used\n\n==== Challenges ====\n\n- ''Slow inference problem''\n\nTo solve the slow inference problem, [[Microsoft]] research and [[Baidu]] research both proposed use non-auto-regressive models to make the inference process faster.\nThe [https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09263 FastSpeech] model proposed by Microsoft use Transformer architecture with a duration model to achieve the goal. \nBesides, the duration model which borrows from traditional methods makes the speech production more robust.\n\n- ''Robustness problem''\n\nResearchers found that the robustness problem is strongly related to the text alignment failures, \nand this drives many researchers to revise the attention mechanism which utilize the strong local relation and monotonic properties of speech. \n\n- ''Controllability problem''\n\nTo solve the controllability problem, many works about variational auto-encoder are proposed.<ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Hsu |first=Wei-Ning |author-link= |eprint=1810.07217 |title=Hierarchical Generative Modeling for Controllable Speech Synthesis |class=cs.CL |date=2018

''Flat prosody problem''\n\nGST-Tacotron can slightly alleviate the flat prosody problem, however, it still depends on the training data.\n\n- ''Smoothed acoustic output problem''\n\nTo generate more realistic acoustic features, GAN learning strategy can be applied.\n\nHowever, in practice, neural vocoder can generalize well even when the input features are more smooth than real data.\n\n==== Semi-supervised Learning ====\n\nCurrently, self-supervised learning gain a lot of attention because of better utilizing unlabelled data.\nResearch <ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Chung |first=Yu-An |author-link= |eprint=1808.10128 |title=Semi-Supervised Training for Improving Data Efficiency in End-to-End Speech Synthesis |class=cs.CL |date=2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Ren |first=Yi |author-link= |eprint=1905.06791 |title=Almost Unsupervised Text to Speech and Automatic Speech Recognition |class=cs.CL |date=2019 }}</ref> shows that with the aid of self-supervised loss, the need of paired data decreases.\n\n==== Zero-shot Speaker Adaptation ====\n\nZero-shot speaker adaptation is promising because a single model can generate speech with various speaker styles and characteristic.\nIn June 2018, Google proposed to use pre-trained speaker verification model as speaker encoder to extract speaker embedding <ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Jia |first=Ye |author-link= |eprint=1806.04558 |title=Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis |class=cs.CL |date=2018 }}</ref>.\nThe speaker encoder then becomes a part of the neural text-to-speech model and it can decide the style and characteristic of the output speech.\nThis shows the community that only using a single model to generate speech of multiple style is possible.\n\n==== Neural Vocoder ====\n\nNeural vocoder plays a important role in deep learning-based speech synthesis to generate high-quality speech from acoustic features.\nThe [[WaveNet]] model proposed in 2016 achieves great performance on speech quality.\nWavenet factorised the joint probability of a waveform <math>\\mathbf{x}=\\{x_1,...,x_T\\}</math> as a product of conditional probabilities as follows\n\n<math>p_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x})=\\prod_{t=1}^{T}p(x_t|x_1,...,x_{t-1})</math>\n\nWhere <math>\\theta</math> is the model parameter including many dilated convolution layers.\nTherefore, each audio sample <math>x_t</math> is therefore conditioned on the samples at all previous timesteps.\nHowever, the auto-regressive nature of WaveNet makes the inference process dramatically slow.\nTo solve the slow inference problem that comes from the auto-regressive characteristic of WaveNet model, \nParallel WaveNet<ref>{{cite arXiv |last=van den Oord |first=Aaron  |author-link= |eprint=1711.10433 |title=Parallel WaveNet: Fast High-Fidelity Speech Synthesis |class=cs.CL |date=2018 }}</ref> is proposed.\nParallel WaveNet is an inverse autoregressive flow-based model which is trained by knowledge distillation with a pre-trained teacher WaveNet model.\nSince inverse autoregressive flow-based model is non-auto-regressive when performing inference, the inference speed is faster than real-time.\nIn the meanwhile, [[Nvidia]] proposed a flow-based WaveGlow <ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Prenger |first=Ryan |author-link= |eprint=1811.00002 |title=WaveGlow: A Flow-based Generative Network for Speech Synthesis |class=cs.SD |date=2018 }}</ref> model which can also generate speech with faster than real-time speed.\nHowever, despite the high inference speed, \nparallel WaveNet has the limitation of the need of a pre-trained WaveNet model and WaveGlow takes many weeks to converge with limited computing devices.\nThis issue is solved by Parallel WaveGAN <ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Yamamoto |first=Ryuichi |author-link= |eprint=1910.11480 |title=Parallel WaveGAN: A fast waveform generation model based on generative adversarial networks with multi-resolution spectrogram |class=eess.AS |date=2019 }}</ref> which learns to produce speech by multi-resolution spectral loss and GANs learning strategy.\n\n== Challenges ==\n\n=== Text normalization challenges ===\n\nThe process of normalizing text is rarely straightforward. Texts are full of [[heteronym (linguistics)|heteronym]]s, [[number]]s, and [[abbreviation]]s that all require expansion into a phonetic representation. There are many spellings in English which are pronounced differently based on context. For example, \"My latest project is to learn how to better project my voice\" contains two pronunciations of \"project\".\n\nMost text-to-speech (TTS) systems do not generate [[Semantics#Linguistics|semantic]] representations of their input texts, as processes for doing so are unreliable, poorly understood, and computationally ineffective. As a result, various [[heuristic]] techniques are used to guess the proper way to disambiguate [[homograph]]s, like examining neighboring words and using statistics about frequency of occurrence.\n\nRecently TTS systems have begun to use HMMs (discussed above) to generate \"[[Part-of-speech tagging|parts of speech]]\" to aid in disambiguating homographs.  This technique is quite successful for many cases such as whether \"read\" should be pronounced as \"red\" implying past tense, or as \"reed\" implying present tense.  Typical error rates when using HMMs in this fashion are usually below five percent.  These techniques also work well for most European languages, although access to required training [[Text corpus|corpora]] is frequently difficult in these languages.\n\nDeciding how to convert numbers is another problem that TTS systems have to address. It is a simple programming challenge to convert a number into words (at least in English), like \"1325\" becoming \"one thousand three hundred twenty-five.\" However, numbers occur in many different contexts; \"1325\" may also be read as \"one three two five\", \"thirteen twenty-five\" or \"thirteen hundred and twenty five\". A TTS system can often infer how to expand a number based on surrounding words, numbers, and punctuation, and sometimes the system provides a way to specify the context if it is ambiguous.<ref>{{cite web | title = Speech synthesis | publisher = World Wide Web Organization | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/#S3.1.8}}</ref> Roman numerals can also be read differently depending on context.  For example, \"Henry VIII\" reads as \"Henry the Eighth\", while \"Chapter VIII\" reads as \"Chapter Eight\".\n\nSimilarly, abbreviations can be ambiguous. For example, the abbreviation \"in\" for \"inches\" must be differentiated from the word \"in\", and the address \"12 St John St.\" uses the same abbreviation for both \"Saint\" and \"Street\". TTS systems with intelligent front ends can make educated guesses about ambiguous abbreviations, while others provide the same result in all cases, resulting in nonsensical (and sometimes comical) outputs, such as \"[[Ulysses S. Grant]]\" being rendered as \"Ulysses South Grant\".\n\n=== Text-to-phoneme challenges ===\n\nSpeech synthesis systems use two basic approaches to determine the pronunciation of a word based on its [[spelling]], a process which is often called text-to-phoneme or [[grapheme]]-to-phoneme conversion ([[phoneme]] is the term used by [[Linguistics|linguists]] to describe distinctive sounds in a [[language]]). The simplest approach to text-to-phoneme conversion is the dictionary-based approach, where a large dictionary containing all the words of a language and their correct [[pronunciation]]s is stored by the program. Determining the correct pronunciation of each word is a matter of looking up each word in the dictionary and replacing the spelling with the pronunciation specified in the dictionary. The other approach is rule-based, in which pronunciation rules are applied to words to determine their pronunciations based on their spellings. This is similar to the \"sounding out\", or [[synthetic phonics]], approach to learning reading.\n\nEach approach has advantages and drawbacks. The dictionary-based approach is quick and accurate, but completely fails if it is given a word which is not in its dictionary. As dictionary size grows, so too does the memory space requirements of the synthesis system. On the other hand, the rule-based approach works on any input, but the complexity of the rules grows substantially as the system takes into account irregular spellings or pronunciations. (Consider that the word \"of\" is very common in English, yet is the only word in which the letter \"f\" is pronounced {{IPA|[v]}}.) As a result, nearly all speech synthesis systems use a combination of these approaches.\n\nLanguages with a [[phonemic orthography]] have a very regular writing system, and the prediction of the pronunciation of words based on their spellings is quite successful. Speech synthesis systems for such languages often use the rule-based method extensively, resorting to dictionaries only for those few words, like foreign names and [[Loanword|borrowings]], whose pronunciations are not obvious from their spellings. On the other hand, speech synthesis systems for languages like [[English language|English]], which have extremely irregular spelling systems, are more likely to rely on dictionaries, and to use rule-based methods only for unusual words, or words that aren't in their dictionaries.\n\n=== Evaluation challenges ===\nThe consistent evaluation of speech synthesis systems may be difficult because of a lack of universally agreed objective evaluation criteria. Different organizations often use different speech data. The quality of speech synthesis systems also depends on the quality of the production technique (which may involve analogue or digital recording) and on the facilities used to replay the speech. Evaluating speech synthesis systems has therefore often been compromised by differences between production techniques and replay facilities.\n\nSince 2005, however, some researchers have started to evaluate speech synthesis systems using a common speech dataset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://festvox.org/blizzard |title=Blizzard Challenge |publisher=Festvox.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Prosodics and emotional content ===\n{{See also|Prosody (linguistics)}}\nA study in the journal ''Speech Communication'' by Amy Drahota and colleagues at the [[University of Portsmouth]], [[UK]], reported that listeners to voice recordings could determine, at better than chance levels, whether or not the speaker was smiling.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Smile -and the world can hear you |date=January 9, 2008 |url=http://www.port.ac.uk/aboutus/newsandevents/news/title,74220,en.html |archivedate=May 17, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517102201/http://www.port.ac.uk/aboutus/newsandevents/news/title%2C74220%2Cen.html |publisher=University of Portsmouth |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Smile \u2013 And The World Can Hear You, Even If You Hide |work=Science Daily |date=January 2008 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080111224745.htm}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n |last1       = Drahota\n |first1      = A.\n |title       = The vocal communication of different kinds of smile\n |doi         = 10.1016/j.specom.2007.10.001\n |journal     = Speech Communication\n |volume      = 50\n |issue       = 4\n |pages       = 278\u2013287\n |year        = 2008\n |url         = http://peer.ccsd.cnrs.fr/docs/00/49/91/97/PDF/PEER_stage2_10.1016%252Fj.specom.2007.10.001.pdf\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130703062330/https://peer.ccsd.cnrs.fr/docs/00/49/91/97/PDF/PEER_stage2_10.1016/j.specom.2007.10.001.pdf\n |archivedate = 2013-07-03\n}}<!-- also available here: http://ganymedes.lib.unideb.hu:8080/udpeer/bitstream/2437.2/2984/1/PEER_stage2_10.1016%252Fj.specom.2007.10.001.pdf --></ref> It was suggested that identification of the vocal features that signal emotional content may be used to help make synthesized speech sound more natural.

It included the [[General Instrument SP0256|SP0256 Narrator]] speech synthesizer chip on a removable cartridge. The Narrator had 2kB of Read-Only Memory (ROM), and this was utilized to store a database of generic words that could be combined to make phrases in Intellivision games. Since the Orator chip could also accept speech data from external memory, any additional words or phrases needed could be stored inside the cartridge itself. The data consisted of strings of analog-filter coefficients to modify the behavior of the chip's synthetic vocal-tract model, rather than simple digitized samples.\n\n===SAM===\n[[File:C64 Software Automatic Mouth demo.flac|thumb|A demo of SAM on the C64]]\nAlso released in 1982, [[Software Automatic Mouth]] was the first commercial all-software voice synthesis program. It was later used as the basis for [[Macintalk]]. The program was available for non-Macintosh Apple computers (including the Apple II, and the Lisa), various Atari models and the Commodore 64. The Apple version preferred additional hardware that contained DACs, although it could instead use the computer's one-bit audio output (with the addition of much distortion) if the card was not present. The Atari made use of the embedded POKEY audio chip. Speech playback on the Atari normally disabled interrupt requests and shut down the ANTIC chip during vocal output. The audible output is extremely distorted speech when the screen is on. The Commodore 64 made use of the 64's embedded SID audio chip.\n\n=== Atari ===\nArguably, the first speech system integrated into an [[operating system]] was the 1400XL/1450XL personal computers designed by [[Atari, Inc.]] using the Votrax SC01 chip in 1983. The 1400XL/1450XL computers used a Finite State Machine to enable World English Spelling text-to-speech synthesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/ahs_archives/archives/pdf/computers/8bits/1400xlmodem.pdf |title=1400XL/1450XL Speech Handler External Reference Specification |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref> Unfortunately, the 1400XL/1450XL personal computers never shipped in quantity.\n\nThe [[Atari ST]] computers were sold with \"stspeech.tos\" on floppy disk.\n\n=== Apple ===\n\nThe first speech system integrated into an [[operating system]] that shipped in quantity was [[Apple Computer]]'s [[PlainTalk#Original MacInTalk|MacInTalk]]. The software was licensed from 3rd party developers Joseph Katz and Mark Barton (later, SoftVoice, Inc.) and was featured during the 1984 introduction of the Macintosh computer. This January demo required 512 kilobytes of RAM memory. As a result, it could not run in the 128 kilobytes of RAM the first Mac actually shipped with.<ref name=\"demo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Intro_Demo.txt |title=It Sure Is Great To Get Out Of That Bag! |publisher=folklore.org |accessdate=2013-03-24}}</ref> So, the demo was accomplished with a prototype 512k Mac, although those in attendance were not told of this and the synthesis demo created considerable excitement for the Macintosh. In the early 1990s Apple expanded its capabilities offering system wide text-to-speech support. With the introduction of faster PowerPC-based computers they included higher quality voice sampling. Apple also introduced [[speech recognition]] into its systems which provided a fluid command set. More recently, Apple has added sample-based voices. Starting as a curiosity, the speech system of Apple [[Macintosh]] has evolved into a fully supported program, [[PlainTalk]], for people with vision problems. [[VoiceOver]] was for the first time featured in 2005 in [[Mac OS X Tiger]] (10.4). During 10.4 (Tiger) and first releases of 10.5 ([[Mac OS X Leopard|Leopard]]) there was only one standard voice shipping with Mac OS X. Starting with 10.6 ([[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|Snow Leopard]]), the user can choose out of a wide range list of multiple voices. VoiceOver voices feature the taking of realistic-sounding breaths between sentences, as well as improved clarity at high read rates over PlainTalk. Mac OS X also includes [[say (software)|say]], a [[Command-line interface|command-line based]] application that converts text to audible speech. The [[AppleScript]] Standard Additions includes a [[say (software)|say]] verb that allows a script to use any of the installed voices and to control the pitch, speaking rate and modulation of the spoken text.\n\nThe Apple [[iOS]] operating system used on the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch uses [[VoiceOver]] speech synthesis for accessibility.<ref name=\"configure\">{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3577 |title=iPhone: Configuring accessibility features (Including VoiceOver and Zoom) |publisher=Apple |accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref> Some third party applications also provide speech synthesis to facilitate navigating, reading web pages or translating text.\n\n=== AmigaOS ===\n[[File:Amiga speech synthesis.flac|thumb|Example of speech synthesis with the included Say utility in Workbench 1.3]]\n[[File:SoftVoice.svg|right|upright]]\nThe second operating system to feature advanced speech synthesis capabilities was [[AmigaOS]], introduced in 1985. The voice synthesis was licensed by [[Commodore International]] from SoftVoice, Inc., who also developed the original MacinTalk text-to-speech system. It featured a complete system of voice emulation for American English, with both male and female voices and \"stress\" indicator markers, made possible through the [[Amiga]]'s audio [[chipset]].<ref>{{Cite book |author=Miner, Jay |year=1991 |title=Amiga Hardware Reference Manual |edition=3rd |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] Publishing Company, Inc. |isbn=978-0-201-56776-2|display-authors=etal|author-link=Jay Miner }}</ref> The synthesis system was divided into a translator library which converted unrestricted English text into a standard set of phonetic codes and a narrator device which implemented a formant model of speech generation.. AmigaOS also featured a high-level \"[[AmigaOS#Speech synthesis|Speak Handler]]\", which allowed command-line users to redirect text output to speech. Speech synthesis was occasionally used in third-party programs, particularly word processors and educational software. The synthesis software remained largely unchanged from the first AmigaOS release and Commodore eventually removed speech synthesis support from AmigaOS 2.1 onward.\n\nDespite the American English phoneme limitation, an unofficial version with multilingual speech synthesis was developed. This made use of an enhanced version of the translator library which could translate a number of languages, given a set of rules for each language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.aminet.net/util/libs/translator42.readme |title=Translator Library (Multilingual-speech version) |last1=Devitt |first1=Francesco |date=30 June 1995 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226143859/https://uk.aminet.net/util/libs/translator42.readme |archivedate=26 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=== Microsoft Windows ===\n{{See also|Microsoft Agent}}\n\nModern [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] desktop systems can use [[Speech Application Programming Interface#SAPI 1-4 API family|SAPI 4]] and [[Speech Application Programming Interface#SAPI 5 API family|SAPI 5]] components to support speech synthesis and [[speech recognition]].

[[Windows 2000]] added [[Microsoft Narrator|Narrator]], a text-to-speech utility for people who have visual impairment. Third-party programs such as JAWS for Windows, Window-Eyes, Non-visual Desktop Access, Supernova and System Access can perform various text-to-speech tasks such as reading text aloud from a specified website, email account, text document, the Windows clipboard, the user's keyboard typing, etc. Not all programs can use speech synthesis directly.<ref name=\"Narrator\">{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windowsxp/usingnarrator.aspx |title=Accessibility Tutorials for Windows XP: Using Narrator |publisher=Microsoft |date=2011-01-29 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref> Some programs can use plug-ins, extensions or add-ons to read text aloud.

Speech synthesizers were offered free with the purchase of a number of cartridges and were used by many TI-written video games (notable titles offered with speech during this promotion were [[Alpiner (video game)|Alpiner]] and [[Parsec (video game)|Parsec]]). The synthesizer uses a variant of linear predictive coding and has a small in-built vocabulary. The original intent was to release small cartridges that plugged directly into the synthesizer unit, which would increase the device's built-in vocabulary. However, the success of software text-to-speech in the Terminal Emulator II cartridge canceled that plan.\n\n==Text-to-speech systems==\n'''Text-to-Speech''' ('''TTS''') refers to the ability of computers to read text aloud. A '''TTS Engine''' converts written text to a phonemic representation, then converts the phonemic representation to waveforms that can be output as sound.

Users can download generated audio files to portable devices, e.g. with a help of [[podcast]] receiver, and listen to them while walking, jogging or commuting to work.\n\nA growing field in Internet based TTS is web-based [[assistive technology]], e.g. 'Browsealoud' from a UK company and [[Readspeaker]]. It can deliver TTS functionality to anyone (for reasons of accessibility, convenience, entertainment or information) with access to a web browser.

The most recent is [[Speech Synthesis Markup Language]] (SSML), which became a [[W3C recommendation]] in 2004. Older speech synthesis markup languages include Java Speech Markup Language ([[JSML]]) and [[SABLE]]. Although each of these was proposed as a standard, none of them have been widely adopted.\n\nSpeech synthesis markup languages are distinguished from dialogue markup languages. [[VoiceXML]], for example, includes tags related to speech recognition, dialogue management and touchtone dialing, in addition to text-to-speech markup.\n\n== Applications ==\n\nSpeech synthesis has long been a vital [[assistive technology]] tool and its application in this area is significant and widespread. It allows environmental barriers to be removed for people with a wide range of disabilities. The longest application has been in the use of [[screen reader]]s for people with [[visual impairment]], but text-to-speech systems are now commonly used by people with [[dyslexia]] and other reading difficulties as well as by pre-literate children. They are also frequently employed to aid those with severe [[speech impairment]] usually through a dedicated [[voice output communication aid]].\n\nSpeech synthesis techniques are also used in entertainment productions such as games and animations. In 2007, Animo Limited announced the development of a software application package based on its speech synthesis software FineSpeech, explicitly geared towards customers in the entertainment industries, able to generate narration and lines of dialogue according to user specifications.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-05-02/speech-synthesis-software |title=Speech Synthesis Software for Anime Announced |work=Anime News Network |date=2007-05-02 |accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref> The application reached maturity in 2008, when NEC [[Biglobe]] announced a web service that allows users to create phrases from the voices of [[Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2]] characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-09-09/code-geass-voice-synthesis-service-offered-in-japan |title=Code Geass Speech Synthesizer Service Offered in Japan |publisher=Animenewsnetwork.com |date=2008-09-09 |accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, text-to-speech for disability and handicapped communication aids have become widely deployed in Mass Transit. Text-to-speech is also finding new applications outside the disability market. For example, speech synthesis, combined with [[speech recognition]], allows for interaction with mobile devices via [[natural language processing]] interfaces.\n\nText-to-speech is also used in second language acquisition. Voki, for instance, is an educational tool created by Oddcast that allows users to create their own talking avatar, using different accents. They can be emailed, embedded on websites or shared on social media.\n\nIn addition, speech synthesis is a valuable computational aid for the analysis and assessment of speech disorders. A [[voice quality]] synthesizer, developed by Jorge C. Lucero et al. at [[University of Bras\u00edlia|University of Brasilia]], simulates the physics of [[phonation]] and includes models of vocal frequency jitter and tremor, airflow noise and laryngeal asymmetries.<ref name=\":0\" />  The synthesizer has been used to mimic the [[timbre]] of [[dysphonic]] speakers with controlled levels of roughness, breathiness and strain.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Stephen Hawking.StarChild.jpg|thumb|[[Stephen Hawking]] was one of the most famous people using a speech computer to communicate]]\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Chinese speech synthesis]]\n* [[Comparison of screen readers]]\n* [[Comparison of speech synthesizers]]\n* [[Euphonia (device)]]\n* [[Orca (assistive technology)]]\n* [[Paperless office]]\n* [[Speech processing]]\n* [[Speech-generating device]]\n* [[Silent speech interface]]\n* [[Text to speech in digital television]]\n\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{dmoz|Computers/Speech_Technology/Speech_Synthesis/}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE6zy8aUwtQ Simulated singing with the singing robot Pavarobotti] or a description from the [[BBC]] on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNqNM6Ccck8 how the robot synthesized the singing].\n\n\n{{sound synthesis types}}\n{{Speech synthesis}}\n{{Natural Language Processing}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Speech Synthesis}}\n[[Category:Speech synthesis| ]]\n[[Category:Artificial intelligence applications]]\n[[Category:Assistive technology]]\n[[Category:Auditory displays]]\n[[Category:Computational linguistics]]\n[[Category:History of human\u2013computer interaction]]\n", "text_old": "{{See also|Speech-generating device}}\n\n'''Speech synthesis''' is the artificial production of human [[speech]].

The ideal speech synthesizer is both natural and intelligible. Speech synthesis systems usually try to maximize both characteristics.\n\nThe two primary technologies generating synthetic speech waveforms are ''concatenative synthesis'' and ''[[formant]] synthesis''. Each technology has strengths and weaknesses, and the intended uses of a synthesis system will typically determine which approach is used.\n\n=== Concatenation synthesis ===\n{{main|Concatenative synthesis}}\nConcatenative synthesis is based on the [[concatenation]] (or stringing together) of segments of recorded speech. Generally, concatenative synthesis produces the most natural-sounding synthesized speech. However, differences between natural variations in speech and the nature of the automated techniques for segmenting the waveforms sometimes result in audible glitches in the output. There are three main sub-types of concatenative synthesis.\n\n==== Unit selection synthesis ====\n\nUnit selection synthesis uses large [[database]]s of recorded speech. During database creation, each recorded utterance is segmented into some or all of the following: individual [[phone (phonetics)|phones]], [[diphone]]s, half-phones, [[syllable]]s, [[morpheme]]s, [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, and [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s. Typically, the division into segments is done using a specially modified [[speech recognition|speech recognizer]] set to a \"forced alignment\" mode with some manual correction afterward, using visual representations such as the [[waveform]] and [[spectrogram]].<ref>[[Alan W. Black]], [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/papers/IEEE2002/allthetime/allthetime.html Perfect synthesis for all of the people all of the time.] IEEE TTS Workshop 2002.</ref> An [[index (database)|index]] of the units in the speech database is then created based on the segmentation and acoustic parameters like the [[fundamental frequency]] ([[pitch (music)|pitch]]), duration, position in the syllable, and neighboring phones. At [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]], the desired target utterance is created by determining the best chain of candidate units from the database (unit selection). This process is typically achieved using a specially weighted [[decision tree]].\n\nUnit selection provides the greatest naturalness, because it applies only a small amount of [[digital signal processing]] (DSP) to the recorded speech. DSP often makes recorded speech sound less natural, although some systems use a small amount of signal processing at the point of concatenation to smooth the waveform. The output from the best unit-selection systems is often indistinguishable from real human voices, especially in contexts for which the TTS system has been tuned. However, maximum naturalness typically require unit-selection speech databases to be very large, in some systems ranging into the [[gigabyte]]s of recorded data, representing dozens of hours of speech.<ref>John Kominek and [[Alan W. Black]]. (2003). CMU ARCTIC databases for speech synthesis. CMU-LTI-03-177.

The number of diphones depends on the [[phonotactics]] of the language: for example, Spanish has about 800 diphones, and German about 2500. In diphone synthesis, only one example of each diphone is contained in the speech database. At runtime, the target [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of a sentence is superimposed on these minimal units by means of [[digital signal processing]] techniques such as [[linear predictive coding]], [[PSOLA]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/PSOLA.html |title=Pitch-Synchronous Overlap and Add (PSOLA) Synthesis |accessdate=2008-05-28 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222180903/http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/PSOLA.html |archivedate=February 22, 2007 }}</ref> or [[MBROLA]].<ref>T.

It is used in applications where the variety of texts the system will output is limited to a particular domain, like transit schedule announcements or weather reports.<ref>L.F. Lamel, J.L. Gauvain, B. Prouts, C. Bouhier, R. Boesch. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.53.6101&rep=rep1&type=pdf Generation and Synthesis of Broadcast Messages], ''Proceedings ESCA-NATO Workshop and Applications of Speech Technology'', September 1993.</ref>  The technology is very simple to implement, and has been in commercial use for a long time, in devices like talking clocks and calculators. The level of naturalness of these systems can be very high because the variety of sentence types is limited, and they closely match the prosody and intonation of the original recordings.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nBecause these systems are limited by the words and phrases in their databases, they are not general-purpose and can only synthesize the combinations of words and phrases with which they have been preprogrammed. The blending of words within naturally spoken language however can still cause problems unless the many variations are taken into account. For example, in [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]] dialects of English the ''\"r\"'' in words like ''\"clear\"'' {{IPA|/\u02c8kl\u026a\u0259/}} is usually only pronounced when the following word has a vowel as its first letter (e.g. ''\"clear out\"'' is realized as {{IPA|/\u02cckl\u026a\u0259\u0279\u02c8\u028c\u028at/}}). Likewise in [[French language|French]], many final consonants become no longer silent if followed by a word that begins with a vowel, an effect called [[Liaison (French)|liaison]]. This [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]] cannot be reproduced by a simple word-concatenation system, which would require additional complexity to be [[context-sensitive grammar|context-sensitive]].\n\n=== Formant synthesis ===\n\n[[Formant]] synthesis does not use human speech samples at runtime. Instead, the synthesized speech output is created using [[additive synthesis]] and an acoustic model ([[physical modelling synthesis]]).<ref>Dartmouth College: [http://digitalmusics.dartmouth.edu/~book/MATCpages/chap.4/4.4.formant_synth.html ''Music and Computers''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608035309/http://digitalmusics.dartmouth.edu/~book/MATCpages/chap.4/4.4.formant_synth.html |date=2011-06-08 }}, 1993.</ref> Parameters such as [[fundamental frequency]], [[phonation|voicing]], and [[noise]] levels are varied over time to create a [[waveform]] of artificial speech. This method is sometimes called ''rules-based synthesis''; however, many concatenative systems also have rules-based components.\nMany systems based on formant synthesis technology generate artificial, robotic-sounding speech that would never be mistaken for human speech. However, maximum naturalness is not always the goal of a speech synthesis system, and formant synthesis systems have advantages over concatenative systems. Formant-synthesized speech can be reliably intelligible, even at very high speeds, avoiding the acoustic glitches that commonly plague concatenative systems. High-speed synthesized speech is used by the visually impaired to quickly navigate computers using a [[screen reader]]. Formant synthesizers are usually smaller programs than concatenative systems because they do not have a database of speech samples. They can therefore be used in [[embedded system]]s, where [[data storage device|memory]] and [[microprocessor]] power are especially limited. Because formant-based systems have complete control of all aspects of the output speech, a wide variety of prosodies and [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]s can be output, conveying not just questions and statements, but a variety of emotions and tones of voice.\n\nExamples of non-real-time but highly accurate intonation control in formant synthesis include the work done in the late 1970s for the [[Texas Instruments]] toy [[Speak & Spell (game)|Speak & Spell]], and in the early 1980s [[Sega]] [[Video arcade|arcade]] machines<ref>Examples include [[Astro Blaster]], [[Space Fury]], and [[Star Trek (arcade game)|Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator]]</ref> and in many [[Atari, Inc.]] arcade games<ref>Examples include [[Star Wars (arcade game)|Star Wars]], [[Firefox (arcade game)|Firefox]], [[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (arcade game)|Return of the Jedi]], [[Road Runner (video game)|Road Runner]], [[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (arcade game)|The Empire Strikes Back]], [[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (arcade game)|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]], [[720\u00b0]], [[Gauntlet (arcade game)|Gauntlet]], [[Gauntlet II]], [[A.P.B.

The first articulatory synthesizer regularly used for laboratory experiments was developed at [[Haskins Laboratories]] in the mid-1970s by [[Philip Rubin]], Tom Baer, and Paul Mermelstein. This synthesizer, known as ASY, was based on vocal tract models developed at [[Bell Laboratories]] in the 1960s and 1970s by Paul Mermelstein, Cecil Coker, and colleagues.\n\nUntil recently, articulatory synthesis models have not been incorporated into commercial speech synthesis systems. A notable exception is the [[NeXT]]-based system originally developed and marketed by Trillium Sound Research, a spin-off company of the [[University of Calgary]], where much of the original research was conducted. Following the demise of the various incarnations of NeXT (started by [[Steve Jobs]] in the late 1980s and merged with Apple Computer in 1997), the Trillium software was published under the GNU General Public License, with work continuing as [[gnuspeech]]. The system, first marketed in 1994, provides full articulatory-based text-to-speech conversion using a waveguide or transmission-line analog of the human oral and nasal tracts controlled by Carr\u00e9's \"distinctive region model\".\n\nMore recent synthesizers, developed by Jorge C. Lucero and colleagues, incorporate models of vocal fold biomechanics, glottal aerodynamics and acoustic wave propagation in the bronqui, traquea, nasal and oral cavities, and thus constitute full systems of physics-based speech simulation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cic.unb.br/~lucero/papers/768_Paper.pdf|title = Physics-based synthesis of disordered voices|last = Lucero|first = J.

===\n\n==== Formulation ====\nGiven an input text or some sequence of linguistic unit <math>Y</math>, the target speech <math>X</math> can be derived by \n\n<math>X=\\arg\\max P(X|Y, \\theta)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta</math> is the model parameter.\n\nTypically, the input text will first be passed to an acoustic feature generator, \nthen the acoustic features are passed to the neural vocoder.\nFor the acoustic feature generator, the [[Loss function]] is typically L1 or L2 loss.\nThese loss functions put a constraint that the output acoustic feature distributions must be Gaussian or Laplacian.\nIn practice, since the human voice band ranges from approximately 300 to 4000 Hz, \nthe loss function will be designed to have more penality on this range:\n\n<math>loss=\\alpha loss_{human} + (1 - \\alpha) loss_{other}</math>\n\nwhere <math>loss_{human}</math> is the loss from human voice band and <math>\\alpha</math> is a scalar typically around 0.5.\nThe acoustic feature is typically [[Spectrogram]] or spectrogram in [[Mel scale]].\nThese features capture the time-frequency relation of speech signal and thus, \nit is sufficient to generate intelligent outputs with these acoustic features.\nThe [[Mel-frequency cepstrum]] feature used in the speech recognition task is not suitable for speech synthesis because it reduces too much information.\n\n==== Brief History ====\nIn September 2016, [[DeepMind]] proposed [https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499 WaveNet], a deep generative model of raw audio waveforms. \nThis shows the community that deep learning-based models have the capability to model raw waveforms and perform well on generating speech from acoustic features like spectrograms or spectrograms in mel scale, \nor even from some preprocessed linguistic features. \nIn early 2017, [[Mila (research institute)]] proposed [https://mila.quebec/en/publication/char2wav-end-to-end-speech-synthesis/ char2wav], \na model to produce raw waveform in an end-to-end method. \nAlso, [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] proposed [https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10135 Tacotron] and [https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06588 VoiceLoop], respectively, \nto generate acoustic features directly from the input text.\nIn the later in the same year, Google proposed [https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05884 Tacotron2] which combined the WaveNet vocoder with the revised Tacotron architecture to perform end-to-end speech synthesis.\nTacotron2 can generate high-quality speech approaching the human voice. \nSince then, end-to-end methods became the hottest research topic because many researchers around the world start to notice the power of the end-to-end speech synthesizer.\n\n==== Advantages and Disadvantages ====\n\nThe advantages of end-to-end methods are as follows:\n* Only need a single model to perform text analysis, acoustic modeling and audio synthesis, i.e. synthesizing speech directly from characters\n** Less feature engineering\n** Easily allows for rich conditioning on various attributes, e.g. speaker or language\n** Adaptation to new data is easier\n** More robust than multi-stage models because no component's error can compound\n* Powerful model capacity to capture the hidden internal structures of data\n* Capable to generate intelligible and natural speech\n* No need to maintain a large database, i.e. small footprint\n\nDespite there are many advantages mentioned, end-to-end methods still have many challenges to be solved:\n* Auto-regressive-based models suffer from slow inference problem\n* Output speech are not robust when data are not sufficient\n* Lack of controllability compared with traditional concatenative and statistical parametric approaches\n* Tend to learn the flat prosody by averaging over training data\n* Tend to output smoothed acoustic features because the l1 or l2 loss is used\n\n==== Challenges ====\n\n- ''Slow inference problem''\n\nTo solve the slow inference problem, [[Microsoft]] research and [[Baidu]] research both proposed use non-auto-regressive models to make the inference process faster.\nThe [https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09263 FastSpeech] model proposed by Microsoft use Transformer architecture with a duration model to achieve the goal. \nBesides, the duration model which borrows from traditional methods makes the speech production more robust.\n\n- ''Robustness problem''\n\nResearchers found that the robustness problem is strongly related to the text alignment failures, \nand this drives many researchers to revise the attention mechanism which utilize the strong local relation and monotonic properties of speech. \n\n- ''Controllability problem''\n\nTo solve the controllability problem, many works about variational auto-encoder are proposed.<ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Hsu |first=Wei-Ning |author-link= |eprint=1810.07217 |title=Hierarchical Generative Modeling for Controllable Speech Synthesis |class=cs.CL |date=2018

''Flat prosody problem''\n\nGST-Tacotron can slightly alleviate the flat prosody problem, however, it still depends on the training data.\n\n- ''Smoothed acoustic output problem''\n\nTo generate more realistic acoustic features, GAN learning strategy can be applied.\n\nHowever, in practice, neural vocoder can generalize well even when the input features are more smooth than real data.\n\n==== Semi-supervised Learning ====\n\nCurrently, self-supervised learning gain a lot of attention because of better utilizing unlabelled data.\nResearch <ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Chung |first=Yu-An |author-link= |eprint=1808.10128 |title=Semi-Supervised Training for Improving Data Efficiency in End-to-End Speech Synthesis |class=cs.CL |date=2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Ren |first=Yi |author-link= |eprint=1905.06791 |title=Almost Unsupervised Text to Speech and Automatic Speech Recognition |class=cs.CL |date=2019 }}</ref> shows that with the aid of self-supervised loss, the need of paired data decreases.\n\n==== Zero-shot Speaker Adaptation ====\n\nZero-shot speaker adaptation is promising because a single model can generate speech with various speaker styles and characteristic.\nIn June 2018, Google proposed to use pre-trained speaker verification model as speaker encoder to extract speaker embedding <ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Jia |first=Ye |author-link= |eprint=1806.04558 |title=Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis |class=cs.CL |date=2018 }}</ref>.\nThe speaker encoder then becomes a part of the neural text-to-speech model and it can decide the style and characteristic of the output speech.\nThis shows the community that only using a single model to generate speech of multiple style is possible.\n\n==== Neural Vocoder ====\n\nNeural vocoder plays a important role in deep learning-based speech synthesis to generate high-quality speech from acoustic features.\nThe [[WaveNet]] model proposed in 2016 achieves great performance on speech quality.\nWavenet factorised the joint probability of a waveform <math>\\mathbf{x}=\\{x_1,...,x_T\\}</math> as a product of conditional probabilities as follows\n\n<math>p_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x})=\\prod_{t=1}^{T}p(x_t|x_1,...,x_{t-1})</math>\n\nWhere <math>\\theta</math> is the model parameter including many dilated convolution layers.\nTherefore, each audio sample <math>x_t</math> is therefore conditioned on the samples at all previous timesteps.\nHowever, the auto-regressive nature of WaveNet makes the inference process dramatically slow.\nTo solve the slow inference problem that comes from the auto-regressive characteristic of WaveNet model, \nParallel WaveNet<ref>{{cite arXiv |last=van den Oord |first=Aaron  |author-link= |eprint=1711.10433 |title=Parallel WaveNet: Fast High-Fidelity Speech Synthesis |class=cs.CL |date=2018 }}</ref> is proposed.\nParallel WaveNet is an inverse autoregressive flow-based model which is trained by knowledge distillation with a pre-trained teacher WaveNet model.\nSince inverse autoregressive flow-based model is non-auto-regressive when performing inference, the inference speed is faster than real-time.\nIn the meanwhile, [[Nvidia]] proposed a flow-based WaveGlow <ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Prenger |first=Ryan |author-link= |eprint=1811.00002 |title=WaveGlow: A Flow-based Generative Network for Speech Synthesis |class=cs.SD |date=2018 }}</ref> model which can also generate speech with faster than real-time speed.\nHowever, despite the high inference speed, \nparallel WaveNet has the limitation of the need of a pre-trained WaveNet model and WaveGlow takes many weeks to converge with limited computing devices.\nThis issue is solved by Parallel WaveGAN <ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Yamamoto |first=Ryuichi |author-link= |eprint=1910.11480 |title=Parallel WaveGAN: A fast waveform generation model based on generative adversarial networks with multi-resolution spectrogram |class=eess.AS |date=2019 }}</ref> which learns to produce speech by multi-resolution spectral loss and GANs learning strategy.\n\n== Challenges ==\n\n=== Text normalization challenges ===\n\nThe process of normalizing text is rarely straightforward. Texts are full of [[heteronym (linguistics)|heteronym]]s, [[number]]s, and [[abbreviation]]s that all require expansion into a phonetic representation. There are many spellings in English which are pronounced differently based on context. For example, \"My latest project is to learn how to better project my voice\" contains two pronunciations of \"project\".\n\nMost text-to-speech (TTS) systems do not generate [[Semantics#Linguistics|semantic]] representations of their input texts, as processes for doing so are unreliable, poorly understood, and computationally ineffective. As a result, various [[heuristic]] techniques are used to guess the proper way to disambiguate [[homograph]]s, like examining neighboring words and using statistics about frequency of occurrence.\n\nRecently TTS systems have begun to use HMMs (discussed above) to generate \"[[Part-of-speech tagging|parts of speech]]\" to aid in disambiguating homographs.  This technique is quite successful for many cases such as whether \"read\" should be pronounced as \"red\" implying past tense, or as \"reed\" implying present tense.  Typical error rates when using HMMs in this fashion are usually below five percent.  These techniques also work well for most European languages, although access to required training [[Text corpus|corpora]] is frequently difficult in these languages.\n\nDeciding how to convert numbers is another problem that TTS systems have to address. It is a simple programming challenge to convert a number into words (at least in English), like \"1325\" becoming \"one thousand three hundred twenty-five.\" However, numbers occur in many different contexts; \"1325\" may also be read as \"one three two five\", \"thirteen twenty-five\" or \"thirteen hundred and twenty five\". A TTS system can often infer how to expand a number based on surrounding words, numbers, and punctuation, and sometimes the system provides a way to specify the context if it is ambiguous.<ref>{{cite web | title = Speech synthesis | publisher = World Wide Web Organization | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/#S3.1.8}}</ref> Roman numerals can also be read differently depending on context.  For example, \"Henry VIII\" reads as \"Henry the Eighth\", while \"Chapter VIII\" reads as \"Chapter Eight\".\n\nSimilarly, abbreviations can be ambiguous. For example, the abbreviation \"in\" for \"inches\" must be differentiated from the word \"in\", and the address \"12 St John St.\" uses the same abbreviation for both \"Saint\" and \"Street\". TTS systems with intelligent front ends can make educated guesses about ambiguous abbreviations, while others provide the same result in all cases, resulting in nonsensical (and sometimes comical) outputs, such as \"[[Ulysses S. Grant]]\" being rendered as \"Ulysses South Grant\".\n\n=== Text-to-phoneme challenges ===\n\nSpeech synthesis systems use two basic approaches to determine the pronunciation of a word based on its [[spelling]], a process which is often called text-to-phoneme or [[grapheme]]-to-phoneme conversion ([[phoneme]] is the term used by [[Linguistics|linguists]] to describe distinctive sounds in a [[language]]). The simplest approach to text-to-phoneme conversion is the dictionary-based approach, where a large dictionary containing all the words of a language and their correct [[pronunciation]]s is stored by the program. Determining the correct pronunciation of each word is a matter of looking up each word in the dictionary and replacing the spelling with the pronunciation specified in the dictionary. The other approach is rule-based, in which pronunciation rules are applied to words to determine their pronunciations based on their spellings. This is similar to the \"sounding out\", or [[synthetic phonics]], approach to learning reading.\n\nEach approach has advantages and drawbacks. The dictionary-based approach is quick and accurate, but completely fails if it is given a word which is not in its dictionary. As dictionary size grows, so too does the memory space requirements of the synthesis system. On the other hand, the rule-based approach works on any input, but the complexity of the rules grows substantially as the system takes into account irregular spellings or pronunciations. (Consider that the word \"of\" is very common in English, yet is the only word in which the letter \"f\" is pronounced {{IPA|[v]}}.) As a result, nearly all speech synthesis systems use a combination of these approaches.\n\nLanguages with a [[phonemic orthography]] have a very regular writing system, and the prediction of the pronunciation of words based on their spellings is quite successful. Speech synthesis systems for such languages often use the rule-based method extensively, resorting to dictionaries only for those few words, like foreign names and [[Loanword|borrowings]], whose pronunciations are not obvious from their spellings. On the other hand, speech synthesis systems for languages like [[English language|English]], which have extremely irregular spelling systems, are more likely to rely on dictionaries, and to use rule-based methods only for unusual words, or words that aren't in their dictionaries.\n\n=== Evaluation challenges ===\nThe consistent evaluation of speech synthesis systems may be difficult because of a lack of universally agreed objective evaluation criteria. Different organizations often use different speech data. The quality of speech synthesis systems also depends on the quality of the production technique (which may involve analogue or digital recording) and on the facilities used to replay the speech. Evaluating speech synthesis systems has therefore often been compromised by differences between production techniques and replay facilities.\n\nSince 2005, however, some researchers have started to evaluate speech synthesis systems using a common speech dataset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://festvox.org/blizzard |title=Blizzard Challenge |publisher=Festvox.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Prosodics and emotional content ===\n{{See also|Prosody (linguistics)}}\nA study in the journal ''Speech Communication'' by Amy Drahota and colleagues at the [[University of Portsmouth]], [[UK]], reported that listeners to voice recordings could determine, at better than chance levels, whether or not the speaker was smiling.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Smile -and the world can hear you |date=January 9, 2008 |url=http://www.port.ac.uk/aboutus/newsandevents/news/title,74220,en.html |archivedate=May 17, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517102201/http://www.port.ac.uk/aboutus/newsandevents/news/title%2C74220%2Cen.html |publisher=University of Portsmouth |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Smile \u2013 And The World Can Hear You, Even If You Hide |work=Science Daily |date=January 2008 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080111224745.htm}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n |last1       = Drahota\n |first1      = A.\n |title       = The vocal communication of different kinds of smile\n |doi         = 10.1016/j.specom.2007.10.001\n |journal     = Speech Communication\n |volume      = 50\n |issue       = 4\n |pages       = 278\u2013287\n |year        = 2008\n |url         = http://peer.ccsd.cnrs.fr/docs/00/49/91/97/PDF/PEER_stage2_10.1016%252Fj.specom.2007.10.001.pdf\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130703062330/https://peer.ccsd.cnrs.fr/docs/00/49/91/97/PDF/PEER_stage2_10.1016/j.specom.2007.10.001.pdf\n |archivedate = 2013-07-03\n}}<!-- also available here: http://ganymedes.lib.unideb.hu:8080/udpeer/bitstream/2437.2/2984/1/PEER_stage2_10.1016%252Fj.specom.2007.10.001.pdf --></ref> It was suggested that identification of the vocal features that signal emotional content may be used to help make synthesized speech sound more natural.

It included the [[General Instrument SP0256|SP0256 Narrator]] speech synthesizer chip on a removable cartridge. The Narrator had 2kB of Read-Only Memory (ROM), and this was utilized to store a database of generic words that could be combined to make phrases in Intellivision games. Since the Orator chip could also accept speech data from external memory, any additional words or phrases needed could be stored inside the cartridge itself. The data consisted of strings of analog-filter coefficients to modify the behavior of the chip's synthetic vocal-tract model, rather than simple digitized samples.\n\n===SAM===\n[[File:C64 Software Automatic Mouth demo.flac|thumb|A demo of SAM on the C64]]\nAlso released in 1982, [[Software Automatic Mouth]] was the first commercial all-software voice synthesis program. It was later used as the basis for [[Macintalk]]. The program was available for non-Macintosh Apple computers (including the Apple II, and the Lisa), various Atari models and the Commodore 64. The Apple version preferred additional hardware that contained DACs, although it could instead use the computer's one-bit audio output (with the addition of much distortion) if the card was not present. The Atari made use of the embedded POKEY audio chip. Speech playback on the Atari normally disabled interrupt requests and shut down the ANTIC chip during vocal output. The audible output is extremely distorted speech when the screen is on. The Commodore 64 made use of the 64's embedded SID audio chip.\n\n=== Atari ===\nArguably, the first speech system integrated into an [[operating system]] was the 1400XL/1450XL personal computers designed by [[Atari, Inc.]] using the Votrax SC01 chip in 1983. The 1400XL/1450XL computers used a Finite State Machine to enable World English Spelling text-to-speech synthesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/ahs_archives/archives/pdf/computers/8bits/1400xlmodem.pdf |title=1400XL/1450XL Speech Handler External Reference Specification |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref> Unfortunately, the 1400XL/1450XL personal computers never shipped in quantity.\n\nThe [[Atari ST]] computers were sold with \"stspeech.tos\" on floppy disk.\n\n=== Apple ===\n\nThe first speech system integrated into an [[operating system]] that shipped in quantity was [[Apple Computer]]'s [[PlainTalk#Original MacInTalk|MacInTalk]]. The software was licensed from 3rd party developers Joseph Katz and Mark Barton (later, SoftVoice, Inc.) and was featured during the 1984 introduction of the Macintosh computer. This January demo required 512 kilobytes of RAM memory. As a result, it could not run in the 128 kilobytes of RAM the first Mac actually shipped with.<ref name=\"demo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Intro_Demo.txt |title=It Sure Is Great To Get Out Of That Bag! |publisher=folklore.org |accessdate=2013-03-24}}</ref> So, the demo was accomplished with a prototype 512k Mac, although those in attendance were not told of this and the synthesis demo created considerable excitement for the Macintosh. In the early 1990s Apple expanded its capabilities offering system wide text-to-speech support. With the introduction of faster PowerPC-based computers they included higher quality voice sampling. Apple also introduced [[speech recognition]] into its systems which provided a fluid command set. More recently, Apple has added sample-based voices. Starting as a curiosity, the speech system of Apple [[Macintosh]] has evolved into a fully supported program, [[PlainTalk]], for people with vision problems. [[VoiceOver]] was for the first time featured in 2005 in [[Mac OS X Tiger]] (10.4). During 10.4 (Tiger) and first releases of 10.5 ([[Mac OS X Leopard|Leopard]]) there was only one standard voice shipping with Mac OS X. Starting with 10.6 ([[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|Snow Leopard]]), the user can choose out of a wide range list of multiple voices. VoiceOver voices feature the taking of realistic-sounding breaths between sentences, as well as improved clarity at high read rates over PlainTalk. Mac OS X also includes [[say (software)|say]], a [[Command-line interface|command-line based]] application that converts text to audible speech. The [[AppleScript]] Standard Additions includes a [[say (software)|say]] verb that allows a script to use any of the installed voices and to control the pitch, speaking rate and modulation of the spoken text.\n\nThe Apple [[iOS]] operating system used on the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch uses [[VoiceOver]] speech synthesis for accessibility.<ref name=\"configure\">{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3577 |title=iPhone: Configuring accessibility features (Including VoiceOver and Zoom) |publisher=Apple |accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref> Some third party applications also provide speech synthesis to facilitate navigating, reading web pages or translating text.\n\n=== AmigaOS ===\n[[File:Amiga speech synthesis.flac|thumb|Example of speech synthesis with the included Say utility in Workbench 1.3]]\n[[File:SoftVoice.svg|right|upright]]\nThe second operating system to feature advanced speech synthesis capabilities was [[AmigaOS]], introduced in 1985. The voice synthesis was licensed by [[Commodore International]] from SoftVoice, Inc., who also developed the original MacinTalk text-to-speech system. It featured a complete system of voice emulation for American English, with both male and female voices and \"stress\" indicator markers, made possible through the [[Amiga]]'s audio [[chipset]].<ref>{{Cite book |author=Miner, Jay |year=1991 |title=Amiga Hardware Reference Manual |edition=3rd |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] Publishing Company, Inc. |isbn=978-0-201-56776-2|display-authors=etal|author-link=Jay Miner }}</ref> The synthesis system was divided into a translator library which converted unrestricted English text into a standard set of phonetic codes and a narrator device which implemented a formant model of speech generation.. AmigaOS also featured a high-level \"[[AmigaOS#Speech synthesis|Speak Handler]]\", which allowed command-line users to redirect text output to speech. Speech synthesis was occasionally used in third-party programs, particularly word processors and educational software. The synthesis software remained largely unchanged from the first AmigaOS release and Commodore eventually removed speech synthesis support from AmigaOS 2.1 onward.\n\nDespite the American English phoneme limitation, an unofficial version with multilingual speech synthesis was developed. This made use of an enhanced version of the translator library which could translate a number of languages, given a set of rules for each language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.aminet.net/util/libs/translator42.readme |title=Translator Library (Multilingual-speech version) |last1=Devitt |first1=Francesco |date=30 June 1995 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226143859/https://uk.aminet.net/util/libs/translator42.readme |archivedate=26 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=== Microsoft Windows ===\n{{See also|Microsoft Agent}}\n\nModern [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] desktop systems can use [[Speech Application Programming Interface#SAPI 1-4 API family|SAPI 4]] and [[Speech Application Programming Interface#SAPI 5 API family|SAPI 5]] components to support speech synthesis and [[speech recognition]].

[[Windows 2000]] added [[Microsoft Narrator|Narrator]], a text-to-speech utility for people who have visual impairment. Third-party programs such as JAWS for Windows, Window-Eyes, Non-visual Desktop Access, Supernova and System Access can perform various text-to-speech tasks such as reading text aloud from a specified website, email account, text document, the Windows clipboard, the user's keyboard typing, etc. Not all programs can use speech synthesis directly.<ref name=\"Narrator\">{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windowsxp/usingnarrator.aspx |title=Accessibility Tutorials for Windows XP: Using Narrator |publisher=Microsoft |date=2011-01-29 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref> Some programs can use plug-ins, extensions or add-ons to read text aloud.

Speech synthesizers were offered free with the purchase of a number of cartridges and were used by many TI-written video games (notable titles offered with speech during this promotion were [[Alpiner (video game)|Alpiner]] and [[Parsec (video game)|Parsec]]). The synthesizer uses a variant of linear predictive coding and has a small in-built vocabulary. The original intent was to release small cartridges that plugged directly into the synthesizer unit, which would increase the device's built-in vocabulary. However, the success of software text-to-speech in the Terminal Emulator II cartridge canceled that plan.\n\n==Text-to-speech systems==\n'''Text-to-Speech''' ('''TTS''') refers to the ability of computers to read text aloud. A '''TTS Engine''' converts written text to a phonemic representation, then converts the phonemic representation to waveforms that can be output as sound.

Users can download generated audio files to portable devices, e.g. with a help of [[podcast]] receiver, and listen to them while walking, jogging or commuting to work.\n\nA growing field in Internet based TTS is web-based [[assistive technology]], e.g. 'Browsealoud' from a UK company and [[Readspeaker]]. It can deliver TTS functionality to anyone (for reasons of accessibility, convenience, entertainment or information) with access to a web browser.

The most recent is [[Speech Synthesis Markup Language]] (SSML), which became a [[W3C recommendation]] in 2004. Older speech synthesis markup languages include Java Speech Markup Language ([[JSML]]) and [[SABLE]]. Although each of these was proposed as a standard, none of them have been widely adopted.\n\nSpeech synthesis markup languages are distinguished from dialogue markup languages. [[VoiceXML]], for example, includes tags related to speech recognition, dialogue management and touchtone dialing, in addition to text-to-speech markup.\n\n== Applications ==\n\nSpeech synthesis has long been a vital [[assistive technology]] tool and its application in this area is significant and widespread. It allows environmental barriers to be removed for people with a wide range of disabilities. The longest application has been in the use of [[screen reader]]s for people with [[visual impairment]], but text-to-speech systems are now commonly used by people with [[dyslexia]] and other reading difficulties as well as by pre-literate children. They are also frequently employed to aid those with severe [[speech impairment]] usually through a dedicated [[voice output communication aid]].\n\nSpeech synthesis techniques are also used in entertainment productions such as games and animations. In 2007, Animo Limited announced the development of a software application package based on its speech synthesis software FineSpeech, explicitly geared towards customers in the entertainment industries, able to generate narration and lines of dialogue according to user specifications.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-05-02/speech-synthesis-software |title=Speech Synthesis Software for Anime Announced |work=Anime News Network |date=2007-05-02 |accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref> The application reached maturity in 2008, when NEC [[Biglobe]] announced a web service that allows users to create phrases from the voices of [[Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2]] characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-09-09/code-geass-voice-synthesis-service-offered-in-japan |title=Code Geass Speech Synthesizer Service Offered in Japan |publisher=Animenewsnetwork.com |date=2008-09-09 |accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, Text to Speech for disability and handicapped communication aids have become widely deployed in Mass Transit. Text to Speech is also finding new applications outside the disability market. For example, speech synthesis, combined with [[speech recognition]], allows for interaction with mobile devices via [[natural language processing]] interfaces.\n\nText-to speech is also used in second language acquisition. Voki, for instance, is an educational tool created by Oddcast that allows users to create their own talking avatar, using different accents. They can be emailed, embedded on websites or shared on social media.\n\nIn addition, speech synthesis is a valuable computational aid for the analysis and assessment of speech disorders. A [[voice quality]] synthesizer, developed by Jorge C. Lucero et al. at [[University of Bras\u00edlia|University of Brasilia]], simulates the physics of [[phonation]] and includes models of vocal frequency jitter and tremor, airflow noise and laryngeal asymmetries.<ref name=\":0\" />  The synthesizer has been used to mimic the [[timbre]] of [[dysphonic]] speakers with controlled levels of roughness, breathiness and strain.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Stephen Hawking.StarChild.jpg|thumb|[[Stephen Hawking]] was one of the most famous people using a speech computer to communicate]]\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Chinese speech synthesis]]\n* [[Comparison of screen readers]]\n* [[Comparison of speech synthesizers]]\n* [[Euphonia (device)]]\n* [[Orca (assistive technology)]]\n* [[Paperless office]]\n* [[Speech processing]]\n* [[Speech-generating device]]\n* [[Silent speech interface]]\n* [[Text to speech in digital television]]\n\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{dmoz|Computers/Speech_Technology/Speech_Synthesis/}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE6zy8aUwtQ Simulated singing with the singing robot Pavarobotti] or a description from the [[BBC]] on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNqNM6Ccck8 how the robot synthesized the singing].\n\n\n{{sound synthesis types}}\n{{Speech synthesis}}\n{{Natural Language Processing}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Speech Synthesis}}\n[[Category:Speech synthesis| ]]\n[[Category:Artificial intelligence applications]]\n[[Category:Assistive technology]]\n[[Category:Auditory displays]]\n[[Category:Computational linguistics]]\n[[Category:History of human\u2013computer interaction]]\n", "name_user": "Ardub23", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eApplications", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis"}
