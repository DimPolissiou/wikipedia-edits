During the [[2004 NFL season]], Hall set single-season Chiefs' franchise records with 68 kickoff returns and career-high 1,718 kickoff return yards.<ref name=\"RamsProfile\"/>\n\nIn 2005, in a memorable game against the [[Denver Broncos]], Hall appeared to be on his way to a kickoff return for a touchdown, but he surprisingly fumbled the ball without being touched by a defensive player. With a touchdown on a kickoff return against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] on October 2, 2005, he tied four players, among them [[Ollie Matson]] and [[Gale Sayers]], for the most career kickoff return touchdowns, with six. That record stood until [[Joshua Cribbs]] broke it in 2009. Hall's sixth return was also his 10th return touchdown, placing him third in that category behind [[Brian Mitchell (running back)|Brian Mitchell]] (13) and [[Eric Metcalf]] (12).\n\nIn 2006, Hall had two kickoff returns for 86 yards and three punt returns for seven yards in Week 12 vs. the Denver Broncos on November 23, 2006. This game made him the sixth player to have 10,000 career kick return yards. Hall played his second postseason game at [[Indianapolis]] on January 6, 2007, in a rematch from the 2003 Divisional Playoffs.<ref name=\"RamsProfile\"/>\n\n===St. Louis Rams===\nIn 2007, Hall was traded along with a third-round draft pick to the St. Louis Rams for their third and fifth-round draft pick in the 2007 NFL Draft.  Hall tied Metcalf on September 30, 2007 against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] with his 12th return touchdown. On October 7, 2008, Hall injured his ankle vs. the [[Arizona Cardinals]], missing four games. He further aggravated his ankle on October 25, 2008, vs. the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and was placed on injured reserve.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3144329|title= Return specialist Hall latest Rams player to land on injured list|accessdate=February 3, 2008 |format= |work= ESPN|date=December 6, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===NFL statistics===\n'''Receiving Stats'''<ref name=ESPN>{{cite web|title=Dante Hall Stats|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/2284/dante-hall|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=April 10, 2014}}</ref> \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He is mentioned in [[Lil Wayne]]'s song \"Dipset (Reppin Time)\" in the line \"I'm like Dante Hall, I just throw up the X.\"  Hall appeared as a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman on October 30, 2003.\n\n===Nicknames===\nHall has established many nicknames in his career, perhaps the best known being \"X-factor\", referring to how whenever he scored a touchdown he would cross his forearms to resemble an \"x\". Hall was also known as \"The Human Joystick\", referring to the agility he showed during returns.\n\n==Chiefs franchise records==\n* Most career kick return yards (8,644)<ref name=\"Chiefs\">{{cite web | title =Kansas City Chiefs Franchise Encyclopedia | work = pro-football-reference.com | url = https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/kan/ | accessdate =  August 24, 2012 }}</ref>\n* Most career kick return touchdowns (6)<ref name=\"Chiefs\" />\n* Most career punt return touchdowns (5)<ref name=\"Chiefs\" />\n* Most career combined punt and kickoff return touchdowns (11)<ref name=\"Chiefs\" />\n* Most career All-purpose yards (12,356)<ref name=\"Chiefs\" />\n* Most kickoff return yards in a single season: 1,718 (2004)<ref name=\"Chiefs\" />\n* Most All-purpose yards in a single season: 2,446 (2003)<ref name=\"Chiefs\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Footballstats |nfl=HAL247893 |cfl= |afl= |espn= |cbs= |yahoo=5182 |fox= |si= |pfr= |rotoworld=}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071225093011/http://www.stlouisrams.com/team/players/61298/ Rams Player Bio]\n\n{{Chiefs2000DraftPicks}}\n{{NFL2000s}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hall, Dante}}\n[[Category:1978 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Houston]]\n[[Category:Players of American football from Texas]]\n[[Category:American football wide receivers]]\n[[Category:American football return specialists]]\n[[Category:American football running backs]]\n[[Category:Texas A&M Aggies football players]]\n[[Category:Scottish Claymores players]]\n[[Category:Kansas City Chiefs players]]\n[[Category:American Conference Pro Bowl players]]\n[[Category:St. Louis Rams players]]\n", "name_user": "Rockchalk717", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eProfessional career", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Hall"}

It was established in 2014, after it split from [[Doboj]] municipality. As of 2013, it has a population of 6,958 inhabitants, while the town of Stanari has a population of 1,015 inhabitants.\n\n==Geography==\n\n=== Physical geography ===\nThe Stanari municipality is located in the basin of the [[Ukrina (river)|Ukrina river]] in the area of Krnjin and is characterized by a mostly lowland hilly terrain configuration with a minimum altitude of 138 m (Brestovo) and a maximum altitude of 343 m (Radnja Donja). The municipality of Stanari has three hilly peaks with an altitude of more than 300 m, located on three different sides of the territorial unit of the municipality of Stanari. \n\n=== Political geography ===\nThe Stanari municipality is located in the northeastern part of Republika Srpska on coordinates of eastern longitude 17\u00b049\u203246\u2033 and 44\u00b044\u203250\u2033 north latitude and borders the city of Doboj, and the municipalities of Derventa, Prnjavor, Tesli\u0107 and Te\u0161anj. The Municipality of Stanari is one of the smaller municipalities of Republika Srpska, with an area of 160.96 km2. The area of the territory of the Municipality of Stanari makes 0,643% of the total territory of the Republic of Srpska.\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe area of the municipality of Stanari belongs to the zone of temperate continental climate with moderately cold winters (average temperature in January \u20130.7 \u00baC) and moderately warm summers (average temperature in July 30.9 \u00baC). The average number of total hours of sunshine in the municipality of Stanari is 1.570 hours. The average annual rainfall is about 950 mm, and is evenly distributed throughout the year.\n\n==History==\n\n=== The formation of the Stanari Municipality ===\nThe municipality of Stanari existed and functioned until 1959, when in one of the numerous reorganizations it was abolished and annexed to the municipality of Doboj. The population of this area quickly realized the wrongdoing, because already in 1965 the Municipality, becoming a unit of measure in the planning documents, resolved vital life problems much faster (for example, in 1965 the People's Loan solved the paving of roads at the headquarters of each municipality), and even then launched an activity to rebuild Stanari Municipality.\n\nDue to a lack of understanding, on the one hand, and political obstruction, the initiative for the renewal of the Stanari municipality was not implemented in a few subsequent attempts (1969, 1976 and 1984), and the Initiative Committee for the Restoration of the Municipality of Stanari in 1991 froze the initiative itself, not wanting to question the broader national interests. In 1996, the issue of redevelopment of Stanari Municipality was raised again. At a session held in late December, the will of the residents to become a municipal center was once again confirmed.\n\nAccording to 1996 data, the municipality of Stanari comprised 17 settlements, covering an area of about 213 square kilometers, and according to the census, about 15,000 inhabitants lived in the area.

The entrance to the cave was until the 1992-1995 war mostly buried, but the entrance was dug up for the purpose of hiding the population and the army. The cave consists of an entrance hall, which is partly covered with broken stones from the ceiling, while the other part is under cave sediments, mostly composed of clayey soil and small rocks formed by the calcification process. The cave is wet throughout its entire surface due to dripping of water from the ceilings and a temperature that never exceeds 15 \u00b0C.\n\n'''Rivers and streams''', the largest river that flows through the territory of the municipality of Stanari is Ukrina. Beside it, the water network is also composed of the rivers Ilova, Radnja and Ostru\u017enja and numerous streams, which all have places suitable for picnics and camping in pristine nature next to old watermills, cold drinking springs, grasslands and forests. Along the streams of the Ukrina, Ostru\u017enja, Radnja can be found remains of abandoned watermills, of which only two on the river Radnja are functioning.The river Ukrina is especially interesting because it is largest rivers whose source and mouth are in the territory of Republika Srpska. Another curiosity related to this river is a special phenomenon when in mid-August, around the Transfiguration of the Lord, the river Ukrina \"blossoms.\" This phenomenon lasts for several days, and it involves the covering of the river surface by whitish membranes, that are released by the immature male insects ''Palingenia longicauda,'' which remain on the surface of the water and create an image of water covered with petals flowers.\n\n=== Archaeological Findings ===\n'''Gradina (Brestovo) fortress,''' a medieval fortress on a steep low rock above the right bank of the river Ukrina. This horseshoe-shaped structure is about 23m in length and 13m in width. It consists of a round tower and a square enclosure. The outer walls are 2 m thick. Inside the building is a preserved cultural layer rich in fragments of earthen vessels that can be, at least in the upper layer, dated back to the 15th century.\n\n'''Ste\u0107ci,''' in the area of Stanari there are many sites with ste\u0107aks dating back to the Middle Ages, the most famous of which are the Greek cemeteries in Brestovo and Osredak. In addition to this, the sites from the prehistory which stand out are: Gypsy village in Brestovo, a prehistoric settlement above the Ukrine valley, where there were found remains of pottery from the Late Bronze or Iron Age, and the Mati\u0107a Head, a Paleolithic station in Dragalovci.\n\n=== Museum \"Gojakovac\" Cerovica ===\nThe Local Museum in Cerovica was founded by the Cerovica Parish led by priest Miroslav \u017divkovi\u0107. Through years of effort, collecting material traces of cultural heritage of Cerovic region, and help and support from locals and expert associates, a permanent exhibition was made in the museum on May 2014. The exhibition of the museum contains: archeological, ethnological, historical and library collections.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):<ref name=\"stats2018\">{{cite web |title=Cities and Municipalities of Republika Srpska |url=http://www2.rzs.rs.ba/static/uploads/bilteni/gradovi_i_opstine_republike_srpske/2019/Gradovi_I_Opstine_Republike_Srpske_2019_WEB.pdf |website=rzs.rs.ba |publisher=Republika Srspka Institute of Statistics |accessdate=1 January 2020 |format=PDF |date=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!

It is now operating synchronously with the electricity grid of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It produces 2 million MWh of energy per year. Coal is supplied from the adjacent Stanari coal mine which underwent refurbishment in 2006 in order to provide a stable fuel supply to the power station. According to EFT, the power plant construction created 1,200 new jobs during the construction phase and around 800 permanent jobs after completion. Beneficiaries have included and continue to include the construction industry, various suppliers, logistics and other service providers in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{commonscat|Stanari}}\n{{Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Republika Srpska]]\n\n{{Doboj-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=February 2020}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| official_name                   = Stanari\n| native_name                     = \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0438\n| other_name                      = \n| nickname                        = \n| settlement_type                 = [[List of cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Town]] and [[Municipalities of Republika Srpska|municipality]]\n| motto                           = \n| image_skyline                   = Stanari.jpg\n| imagesize                       = \n| image_caption                   = Panorama of the town Stanari\n| image_flag                      = \n| flag_size                       = \n| image_seal                      = GrbStanara.png\n| seal_size                       = \n| image_map                       = Stanari1-naselja.png\n| mapsize                         = \n| map_caption                     = Municipality map\n| pushpin_map                     = \n| pushpin_label_position          = bottom\n| pushpin_mapsize                 = \n| pushpin_map_caption             = \n| subdivision_type                = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name                = [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n| subdivision_type1               = [[Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Entity]]\n| subdivision_name1               = [[Republika Srpska]]\n| subdivision_type2               = \n| subdivision_name2               = \n| government_footnotes            = \n| government_type                 = \n| leader_title                    = Mayor\n| leader_name                     = Du\u0161an Pani\u0107\n| leader_party                    = [[Alliance of Independent Social Democrats|SNSD]]\n| established_title               = Re-established\n| established_date                = 2014\n| area_magnitude                  = \n| unit_pref                       = Metric\n| area_footnotes                  = \n| area_total_km2                  = 161\n| area_land_km2                   = \n| population_as_of                = 2013\n| population_footnotes            = \n| population_note                 = \n| population_total                = 6958\n| population_density_km2          = auto\n| timezone                        = [[Central European Time|CET]]\n| utc_offset                      = +1\n| timezone_DST                    = [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n| utc_offset_DST                  = +2\n| coordinates                     = {{coord|44|44|50|N|17|49|46|E|display=inline, title}}\n| elevation_footnotes             = \n| elevation_m                     = \n| elevation_ft                    = \n| postal_code_type                = \n| postal_code                     = \n| area_code                       = \n| blank_name                      = \n| blank_info                      = \n| website                         = {{url|http://www.opstinastanari.com}}\n| footnotes                       = \n| name                            = \n| coor_pinpoint                   = \n| population_urban                = 1015\n| image_map1                      = \n}}\n'''Stanari''' ({{lang-sr-cyrl|\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0438}}) is a town and municipality located in [[Republika Srpska]], an entity of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It was established in 2014, after it split from [[Doboj]] municipality. As of 2013, it has a population of 6,958 inhabitants, while the town of Stanari has a population of 1,015 inhabitants.\n\n==Geography==\n\n=== Physical geography ===\nThe Stanari municipality is located in the basin of the [[Ukrina (river)|Ukrina river]] in the area of Krnjin and is characterized by a mostly lowland hilly terrain configuration with a minimum altitude of 138 m (Brestovo) and a maximum altitude of 343 m (Radnja Donja). The municipality of Stanari has three hilly peaks with an altitude of more than 300 m, located on three different sides of the territorial unit of the municipality of Stanari. \n\n=== Political geography ===\nThe Stanari municipality is located in the northeastern part of Republika Srpska on coordinates of eastern longitude 17\u00b049\u203246\u2033 and 44\u00b044\u203250\u2033 north latitude and borders the city of Doboj, and the municipalities of Derventa, Prnjavor, Tesli\u0107 and Te\u0161anj. The Municipality of Stanari is one of the smaller municipalities of Republika Srpska, with an area of 160.96 km2. The area of the territory of the Municipality of Stanari makes 0,643% of the total territory of the Republic of Srpska.\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe area of the municipality of Stanari belongs to the zone of temperate continental climate with moderately cold winters (average temperature in January \u20130.7 \u00baC) and moderately warm summers (average temperature in July 30.9 \u00baC). The average number of total hours of sunshine in the municipality of Stanari is 1.570 hours. The average annual rainfall is about 950 mm, and is evenly distributed throughout the year.\n\n==History==\n\n=== The formation of the Stanari Municipality ===\nThe municipality of Stanari existed and functioned until 1959, when in one of the numerous reorganizations it was abolished and annexed to the municipality of Doboj. The population of this area quickly realized the wrongdoing, because already in 1965 the Municipality, becoming a unit of measure in the planning documents, resolved vital life problems much faster (for example, in 1965 the People's Loan solved the paving of roads at the headquarters of each municipality), and even then launched an activity to rebuild Stanari Municipality.\n\nDue to a lack of understanding, on the one hand, and political obstruction, the initiative for the renewal of the Stanari municipality was not implemented in a few subsequent attempts (1969, 1976 and 1984), and the Initiative Committee for the Restoration of the Municipality of Stanari in 1991 froze the initiative itself, not wanting to question the broader national interests. In 1996, the issue of redevelopment of Stanari Municipality was raised again. At a session held in late December, the will of the residents to become a municipal center was once again confirmed.\n\nAccording to 1996 data, the municipality of Stanari comprised 17 settlements, covering an area of about 213 square kilometers, and according to the census, about 15,000 inhabitants lived in the area. Representatives wishing to break away from Doboj municipality said in the debate that they support the idea of safeguarding the general interest of Serbs in the Doboj area and that they are ready to wait for the right time to establish the municipality, and they also believe that this job is most suitable after the upcoming elections. The members of the Main Board unanimously approved the content of the Request sent to the National Assembly of Republika Srpska, which is to be passed by the Law on the Establishment of the Municipality of Stanari.\n\nResidents got the status of the municipality again in 2014, when the Law on Formation of the Municipality of Stanari was adopted, much to the delight of the residents of this area. The first mayor of the newly formed municipality, elected in February 2015, was Du\u0161an Pani\u0107, of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats.<ref>[http://pressrs.ba/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/69264/Osnovana+op%C5%A1tina+Stanari.html]{{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\nAccording to the 1991 census, all 13 settlements that today make up the municipality of Stanari belonged to Doboj municipality, with 11,238 residents. \n\nIn the 2013 census in Bosnia and Herzegovina, all 13 settlements, of which the municipality of Stanari was formed a year later, were within the City of Doboj, and according to the final data for the Republika Srpska issued by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Srpska, had a population 6,958 inhabitants.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"9\" |Population of settlements \u2013 Stanari municipality\n|-\n|\n|Settlement\n|1948.\n|1953.\n|1961.\n|1971.\n|1981.\n|1991.\n|2013.\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|8,494\n|9,682\n|11,148\n|11,898\n|12,457\n|11,238\n|6,958\n|-\n|1\n|Brestovo\n|1,271\n|1,384\n|1,426\n|1,513\n|1,417\n|1,254\n|\n|-\n|2\n|Dragalovci\n|896\n|996\n|1,110\n|1,204\n|1,312\n|1,031\n|\n|-\n|3\n|Jelanjska\n|656\n|749\n|874\n|827\n|843\n|701\n|\n|-\n|4\n|Ljeb\n|338\n|394\n|442\n|442\n|506\n|446\n|\n|-\n|5\n|Mitrovi\u0107i\n|427\n|476\n|506\n|511\n|491\n|441\n|\n|-\n|6\n|Osredak\n|481\n|555\n|603\n|707\n|730\n|605\n|\n|-\n|7\n|Ostru\u017enja Gornja\n|153\n|377\n|453\n|509\n|510\n|495\n|\n|-\n|8\n|Ostru\u017enja Donja\n|835\n|763\n|924\n|1,024\n|1,120\n|1,130\n|\n|-\n|9\n|Radnja Donja\n|441\n|498\n|578\n|673\n|710\n|572\n|\n|-\n|10\n|Ra\u0161kovci\n|572\n|592\n|700\n|694\n|714\n|666\n|\n|-\n|11\n|'''Stanari'''\n|641\n|777\n|1,141\n|1,224\n|1,301\n|1,299\n|1,015\n|-\n|12\n|Cvrtkovci\n|622\n|769\n|915\n|998\n|945\n|897\n|\n|-\n|13\n|Cerovica\n|1,161\n|1,352\n|1,476\n|1,572\n|1,858\n|1,701\n|\n|}\n\n=== Ethnic composition ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"6\" |Ethnic composition \u2013 Stanari municipality\n|-\n|Settlement\n|Serbs\n|Croats\n|Bosniaks\n|Yugoslavs\n|Others\n|-\n|Total\n|9,606 (85.48 %)\n|1,162 (10.34 %)\n|8 (0.07 %)\n|250 (2.22 %)\n|212 (1.89 %)\n|-\n|Brestovo\n|1,192\n|2\n|0\n|13\n|47\n|-\n|Dragalovci\n|32\n|858\n|3\n|86\n|52\n|-\n|Jelanjska\n|682\n|0\n|0\n|3\n|16\n|-\n|Ljeb\n|426\n|0\n|0\n|9\n|11\n|-\n|Mitrovi\u0107i\n|424\n|1\n|0\n|6\n|10\n|-\n|Osredak\n|408\n|152\n|0\n|42\n|3\n|-\n|Ostru\u017enja Gornja\n|491\n|1\n|0\n|2\n|11\n|-\n|Ostru\u017enja Donja\n|1,090\n|3\n|2\n|17\n|18\n|-\n|Radnja Donja\n|557\n|0\n|0\n|11\n|4\n|-\n|Ra\u0161kovci\n|530\n|117\n|1\n|10\n|8\n|-\n|'''Stanari'''\n|1,204\n|20\n|1\n|45\n|29\n|-\n|Cvrtkovci\n|888\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|7\n|-\n|Cerovica\n|1,682\n|6\n|1\n|6\n|6\n|}\n== Tourism ==\n\n=== Nature ===\n'''Cerovi\u010dka Cave''', the cave in Cerovica, also called the Vukovi\u0107 cave among the locals, is a cave located on one of the long hill lines that follows the terrain from east to west. The entrance to the cave was until the 1992-1995 war mostly buried, but the entrance was dug up for the purpose of hiding the population and the army. The cave consists of an entrance hall, which is partly covered with broken stones from the ceiling, while the other part is under cave sediments, mostly composed of clayey soil and small rocks formed by the calcification process. The cave is wet throughout its entire surface due to dripping of water from the ceilings and a temperature that never exceeds 15 \u00b0C.\n\n'''Rivers and streams''', the largest river that flows through the territory of the municipality of Stanari is Ukrina. Beside it, the water network is also composed of the rivers Ilova, Radnja and Ostru\u017enja and numerous streams, which all have places suitable for picnics and camping in pristine nature next to old watermills, cold drinking springs, grasslands and forests. Along the streams of the Ukrina, Ostru\u017enja, Radnja can be found remains of abandoned watermills, of which only two on the river Radnja are functioning.The river Ukrina is especially interesting because it is largest rivers whose source and mouth are in the territory of Republika Srpska. Another curiosity related to this river is a special phenomenon when in mid-August, around the Transfiguration of the Lord, the river Ukrina \"blossoms.\" This phenomenon lasts for several days, and it involves the covering of the river surface by whitish membranes, that are released by the immature male insects ''Palingenia longicauda,'' which remain on the surface of the water and create an image of water covered with petals flowers.\n\n=== Archaeological Findings ===\n'''Gradina (Brestovo) fortress,''' a medieval fortress on a steep low rock above the right bank of the river Ukrina. This horseshoe-shaped structure is about 23m in length and 13m in width. It consists of a round tower and a square enclosure. The outer walls are 2 m thick. Inside the building is a preserved cultural layer rich in fragments of earthen vessels that can be, at least in the upper layer, dated back to the 15th century.\n\n'''Ste\u0107ci,''' in the area of Stanari there are many sites with ste\u0107aks dating back to the Middle Ages, the most famous of which are the Greek cemeteries in Brestovo and Osredak. In addition to this, the sites from the prehistory which stand out are: Gypsy village in Brestovo, a prehistoric settlement above the Ukrine valley, where there were found remains of pottery from the Late Bronze or Iron Age, and the Mati\u0107a Head, a Paleolithic station in Dragalovci.\n\n=== Museum \"Gojakovac\" Cerovica ===\nThe Local Museum in Cerovica was founded by the Cerovica Parish led by priest Miroslav \u017divkovi\u0107. Through years of effort, collecting material traces of cultural heritage of Cerovic region, and help and support from locals and expert associates, a permanent exhibition was made in the museum on May 2014. The exhibition of the museum contains: archeological, ethnological, historical and library collections.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):<ref name=\"stats2018\">{{cite web |title=Cities and Municipalities of Republika Srpska |url=http://www2.rzs.rs.ba/static/uploads/bilteni/gradovi_i_opstine_republike_srpske/2019/Gradovi_I_Opstine_Republike_Srpske_2019_WEB.pdf |website=rzs.rs.ba |publisher=Republika Srspka Institute of Statistics |accessdate=1 January 2020 |format=PDF |date=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!

It is now operating synchronously with the electricity grid of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It produces 2 million MWh of energy per year. Coal is supplied from the adjacent Stanari coal mine which underwent refurbishment in 2006 in order to provide a stable fuel supply to the power station. According to EFT, the power plant construction created 1,200 new jobs during the construction phase and around 800 permanent jobs after completion. Beneficiaries have included and continue to include the construction industry, various suppliers, logistics and other service providers in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{commonscat|Stanari}}\n{{Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Republika Srpska]]\n\n{{Doboj-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "EcLiPsE285", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanari"}
