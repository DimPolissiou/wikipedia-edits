South of Bloor Street, the expressway was constructed over existing roadways.

North of Eglinton Avenue, the expressway follows the former Woodbine Avenue right-of-way north to Highway 401.\n\nThe parkway operates well beyond its intended capacity of 60,000 vehicles per day and is known for its daily traffic jams; some sections carry an average of 100,000 vehicles a day.

Another section exists north of Toronto from Steeles Avenue into York Region. A section north of Lawrence Avenue to Steeles Avenue was built but replaced by the Don Valley Parkway and Ontario Highway 404. The Woodbine Racetrack existed near its southern terminus for over a century and held numerous [[Queen's Plate]]s until a [[Woodbine Racetrack|new Woodbine track]] was built in [[Etobicoke]].
