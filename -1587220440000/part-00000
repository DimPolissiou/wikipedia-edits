This has resulted in other internet applications treating ISO-8859-1 as meaning Windows-1252 to maintain compatibility with Microsoft products.\nFollowing text is copied (mostly) from ISO-8859-1 page.\n-->It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text with the charset label ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by \"smart quotes\" in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Most modern web browsers and e-mail clients treat the [[media type]] charset ISO-8859-1 as Windows-1252 to accommodate such mislabeling.

Notable additional characters include [[quotation mark|curly quotation marks]] and all the printable characters that are in [[ISO/IEC 8859-15|ISO&nbsp;8859-15]] (at different places than ISO&nbsp;8859-15). It is known to Windows by the [[Windows code page|code page]] number 1252, and by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]]-approved name \"windows-1252\".\n\n<!-- I think the following text is right but I need to do some checking first before I uncomment it (not quite true, yes it happened, but Netscape, Mosaic, et al. were at fault as well :)\nAt one stage many MS internet products produced text in Windows-1252 but marked as ISO-8859-1. This has resulted in other internet applications treating ISO-8859-1 as meaning Windows-1252 to maintain compatibility with Microsoft products.\nFollowing text is copied (mostly) from ISO-8859-1 page.\n-->It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text with the charset label ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by \"smart quotes\" in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Most modern web browsers and e-mail clients treat the [[media type]] charset ISO-8859-1 as Windows-1252 to accommodate such mislabeling. This is now standard behavior in the [[HTML5 in mobile devices|HTML5]] specification, which requires that documents advertised as ISO-8859-1 actually be parsed with the Windows-1252 encoding.<ref name=\"WHATWG\">{{cite web |url=https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |title=Encoding |at=sec. 5.2 Names and labels |publisher=[[WHATWG]] |date=27 January 2015 |accessdate=4 February 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204174315/https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |archivedate=4 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><!-- No authors listed on page, but GitHub lists contributors as -->\n\nHistorically, the phrase \"ANSI Code Page\" was used in Windows to refer to non-DOS encodings; the intention was that most of these would be [[ANSI]] standards such as [[ISO-8859-1]].

The character was portrayed by [[Cory Monteith]] and first appeared on television when ''Glee'' initially premiered its [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]] on Fox on May 19, 2009. Finn was developed by ''Glee'' creators [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], [[Brad Falchuk]], and [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]]. ''Glee'' follows the trials of the New Directions [[glee club]] at the fictional William McKinley High School in the town of [[Lima, Ohio]]. Finn is initially the quarterback of his high school football team. A popular jock at the top of the school's social hierarchy, when he finds himself forced to join the school's [[glee club]], he discovers that he loves it, although he risks alienation from his friends by remaining a member. His storylines see him struggle with his decision to stay in the club, which is at the bottom of the social ladder, while he maintains his popular reputation and the respect of the other jocks. The character has dealt with his attraction to both head cheerleader [[Quinn Fabray]] ([[Dianna Agron]]) and glee club star singer [[Rachel Berry]] ([[Lea Michele]]), the series' female lead. Following Monteith's death on July 13, 2013, it was announced that Finn's own death would occur in the third episode of the fifth season, titled \"[[The Quarterback (Glee)|The Quarterback]]\".\n\nMonteith felt that Finn has had to grow up a lot during his time on the show. The actor said, \"Finn started off as the stereotypical dumb jock but as the show has gone on, Finn's not dumb anymore, really, he\u2019s just a little na\u00efve.\" Early reviews of Finn from television critics were mixed; Emily VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' said that he and Michele were \"both agreeable and a little desperate for an outlet\" in the pilot episode. Commenting on the fifth episode of the first season, Eric Goldman of ''[[IGN]]'' wrote, \"We got to see a bit of a darker side to Finn [...] it's good to see this, because up until now, Finn's been a bit too straight-laced to totally invest in.\" In the second season's eighth episode, \"[[Furt]]\", ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'s}} Tim Stack said, \"It's been a while since we\u2019ve gotten some Finn focus, and I think I just missed Cory Monteith. But I also forgot what a good, natural actor he can be.\" Monteith as Finn won the 2011 Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Actor Comedy, and was nominated in the same category in 2010.\n\nAlthough he was not a singer before being cast as Finn, Monteith sang lead or joint lead on a large number of songs on the show, most of which have charted in the US and abroad. \"[[Jessie's Girl]]\", which Finn performed as a solo, was certified gold in Australia, one of only three singles to do so from the show's releases in that country; he was joint lead on \"[[Don't Stop Believin']]{{-\"}} in the pilot episode, the show's first single sung by the glee club, which was certified gold and platinum in Australia and the US.\n\n==Development==\n===Casting and creation===\n[[File:Cory Monteith 2010 GLAAD Media Awards.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Cory Monteith]] at the [[21st GLAAD Media Awards]] in 2010]]\n\nFinn Hudson is<!--please keep in present tense--> portrayed by [[Cory Monteith]].

In \"[[The Sue Sylvester Shuffle]]\", Coach Beiste and Will Schuester force the entire football team to join the glee club for a week to settle their differences and dispel their prejudices. After a promising start, the non-glee members quit the club and are kicked off the team; at the same time, Sue arranges to have the cheerleading Regionals rescheduled to conflict with the football championship to sabotage both Beiste and Will, whose glee club now has to do the halftime show. With the football team down to half strength and the glee club without its cheerleader members, football players Finn and Puck settle their differences; Puck convinces the non-glee football players to perform in the halftime show, which will also get them back on the team, while Finn convinces Quinn, Santana, and [[Brittany Pierce|Brittany]] ([[Heather Morris (actress)|Heather Morris]]) to quit the Cheerios and perform in the halftime show instead.

After setting up a kissing booth ostensibly to raise money for the glee club, Finn succeeds in kissing Quinn, and they make an assignation. Although Quinn ultimately decides to stay with Sam, he finds out about her cheating on him with Finn, and breaks up with her. Finn and Quinn reunite, campaign together for prom king and queen and go to junior prom together, but Finn is kicked out for fighting with a newly returned Jesse over Rachel, and prom king and queen are won by other students. Finn ultimately breaks up with Quinn again because he realizes how deep his feelings are for Rachel.<ref name=\"Funeral\"/> At Nationals, as the New Directions are about to go on stage, Finn begs Rachel to come back to him, but though she professes her love, she refuses, still torn between her lifelong dream of Broadway stardom and her love for him. At the end of their duet\u2014\"Pretending\", written by Finn\u2014the audience responds with awkward silence as Rachel and Finn actually kiss; the club consequently fails to place at Nationals.

He has been given an early discharge from the army after injuring himself. He finds out she kissed [[Brody Weston|Brody]] ([[Dean Geyer]]), a NYADA junior, and feels that he doesn't belong in her world in New York, so he returns to Lima without telling her.

When Rachel comes to see the musical in the \"[[Glease]]\" episode, their reunion does not go well, and they agree to refrain from contact when Rachel visits Lima in the future. Will takes a leave of absence from McKinley to be a member of a blue-ribbon panel in Washington, DC, so starting in \"[[Dynamic Duets]]\", Finn becomes the interim director of New Directions. While he has a rocky start in the position, they come to accept him as their leader. At Sectionals, the glee club loses to the Warblers after [[Marley Rose|Marley]] ([[Melissa Benoist]]) passes out on stage, interrupting the performance. Afterward, Finn does what he can to keep the club together and finally succeeds despite Sue's opposition\u2014she has deprived New Directions of rehearsal space at school. The Warblers are disqualified, and New Directions is again eligible to compete in Regionals; the choir room is returned to them. Finn enlists Emma, who is deep in wedding preparations in advance of Will's return, to help him judge a glee club competition for which member is the best diva. When he finds her panicking over the reception arrangements, he kisses her. In \"[[I Do (Glee)|I Do]]\", when Emma flees the church the day of the wedding, Finn blames himself, but Rachel sets him straight, and he and Rachel sleep with each other post-reception. In \"[[Girls (and Boys) On Film]]\", Finn teams up with Artie to help find Emma for Will; he later confesses to Will that he kissed Emma, and Will is unable to forgive him. Since working with Will is untenable, Finn leaves New Directions though he enjoyed directing them; Marley tells him he's a good teacher, and he should get a teaching degree. He goes to college, where he shares a dorm room with Puck\u2014who isn't actually attending the school. Will later asks Finn to return to co-lead New Directions, and he agrees. Meanwhile, Santana has discovered that Brody, who is now living with Rachel, is a gigolo, and tells Finn, who flies to New York and warns Brody away, ultimately beating him up and saying, \"Stay away from my future wife.\" When Rachel finds out and breaks up with Brody, she admits that the relationship never would have worked because she was using it to try to get over her heartache about Finn.

The character was portrayed by [[Cory Monteith]] and first appeared on television when ''Glee'' initially premiered its [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]] on Fox on May 19, 2009. Finn was developed by ''Glee'' creators [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], [[Brad Falchuk]], and [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]]. ''Glee'' follows the trials of the New Directions [[glee club]] at the fictional William McKinley High School in the town of [[Lima, Ohio]]. Finn is initially the quarterback of his high school football team. A popular jock at the top of the school's social hierarchy, when he finds himself forced to join the school's [[glee club]], he discovers that he loves it, although he risks alienation from his friends by remaining a member. His storylines see him struggle with his decision to stay in the club, which is at the bottom of the social ladder, while he maintains his popular reputation and the respect of the other jocks. The character has dealt with his attraction to both head cheerleader [[Quinn Fabray]] ([[Dianna Agron]]) and glee club star singer [[Rachel Berry]] ([[Lea Michele]]), the series' female lead. Following Monteith's death on July 13, 2013, it was announced that Finn's own death would occur in the third episode of the fifth season, titled \"[[The Quarterback (Glee)|The Quarterback]]\".\n\nMonteith felt that Finn has had to grow up a lot during his time on the show. The actor said, \"Finn started off as the stereotypical dumb jock but as the show has gone on, Finn's not dumb anymore, really, he\u2019s just a little na\u00efve.\" Early reviews of Finn from television critics were mixed; Emily VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' said that he and Michele were \"both agreeable and a little desperate for an outlet\" in the pilot episode. Commenting on the fifth episode of the first season, Eric Goldman of ''[[IGN]]'' wrote, \"We got to see a bit of a darker side to Finn [...] it's good to see this, because up until now, Finn's been a bit too straight-laced to totally invest in.\" In the second season's eighth episode, \"[[Furt]]\", ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'s}} Tim Stack said, \"It's been a while since we\u2019ve gotten some Finn focus, and I think I just missed Cory Monteith. But I also forgot what a good, natural actor he can be.\" Monteith as Finn won the 2011 Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Actor Comedy, and was nominated in the same category in 2010.\n\nAlthough he was not a singer before being cast as Finn, Monteith sang lead or joint lead on a large number of songs on the show, most of which have charted in the US and abroad. \"[[Jessie's Girl]]\", which Finn performed as a solo, was certified gold in Australia, one of only three singles to do so from the show's releases in that country; he was joint lead on \"[[Don't Stop Believin']]{{-\"}} in the pilot episode, the show's first single sung by the glee club, which was certified gold and platinum in Australia and the US.\n\n==Development==\n===Casting and creation===\n[[File:Cory Monteith 2010 GLAAD Media Awards.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Cory Monteith]] at the [[21st GLAAD Media Awards]] in 2010]]\n\nFinn Hudson is<!--please keep in present tense--> portrayed by [[Cory Monteith]].

It received generally positive reviews from critics, but was Pixar\u2019s second [[box-office bomb]] for grossed $103 million worldwide. The film's financial shortcomings were attributed to the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which resulted in theaters around the globe being closed. Like several other films released in March, it was made available digitally two weeks after its theatrical release.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a world inhabited by [[Legendary creature|mythical creatures]], magic was once commonplace, though difficult to master. After technological advances over the years, magic became obsolete and was largely discarded.\n\nIn a time equivalent to the modern day, Ian Lightfoot, an [[elf]] high-schooler lacking self-confidence, and his older brother Barley, a history and [[role-playing game]] fanatic, live in the city of New Mushroomton. Their father Wilden died shortly before Ian was born, and their mother Laurel has a new boyfriend, [[centaur]] police officer Colt Bronco, whom both Ian and Barley dislike.\n\nOn Ian's sixteenth birthday, Laurel gives the brothers a gift from Wilden: a magical staff, a rare gem, and a letter describing a \"visitation spell\" that can resurrect their father for a single day. Ian accidentally succeeds in casting the spell, but only the lower half of Wilden's body is reformed before the gem disintegrates. The brothers embark on a quest to acquire another gem and complete the spell, taking Barley's beloved [[van]] \"Guinevere\". Finding the boys gone, Laurel leaves to find them.\n\nIan and Barley visit the [[Manticore]]\u2019s Tavern, named for a monster possessing a map to the gem. The tavern has become a [[family restaurant]] managed by the Manticore, legally named The Manticore, also known as \"Corey\". Arguing with Ian over the map, The Manticore realizes how boring her life has become and drives the customers away in a fit of rage, accidentally setting fire to the restaurant and the map. The brothers' only clue to the gem is a children's menu suggesting \"Raven's Point\", a nearby mountain. Laurel later arrives at the scene and befriends The Manticore, who agrees to help her. The Manticore warns that the brothers' journey may awaken a curse that can only be defeated by her special sword, which she and Laurel steal from a [[Pawnbroker|pawn shop]].\n\nTraveling to the mountains, Ian and Barley narrowly escape the police and a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]] of [[pixie]]s,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sims |first1=David |title=Pixar Needs to Make More Movies Like 'Onward' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |date=February 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225005110/https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |archive-date=February 25, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> relying on Ian's newly awakened spell-casting abilities and Barley's role-playing game instincts. \"Raven's Point\" leads them on a trail indicated by a series of [[raven]] statues, but Colt follows them, calling in reinforcements. Barley sacrifices Guinevere to cause a landslide, blocking their pursuers. Following the statues, the brothers descend through a cave and avoid a series of traps and deadly creatures, surfacing to find themselves in front of Ian's high school. Ian lashes out at Barley for leading them on a wild goose chase and walks away with Wilden.\n\nRereading his list of things he always wished to do with his father, Ian realizes that Barley has been a father figure throughout his entire life, and returns to make amends. Barley discovers the gem inside a historic fountain and retrieves it, unwittingly triggering the curse The Manticore spoke of, which turns the high school into an artificial dragon bent on claiming the gem. Ian faces the artificial dragon, but his staff is knocked into the ocean; he reforms it from a splinter and continues the fight. The Manticore flies in carrying Laurel, who plunges the magic sword into the artificial dragon's heart, buying Ian time to cast the visitation spell and fully reform Wilden's body. Ian sends Barley ahead to give his goodbye to Wilden, and holds off the artificial dragon long enough for Laurel to destroy it. After Wilden dissipates, Barley tells Ian that their father is proud of him, and the brothers share a hug.\n\nIan's confidence and spell-casting improve and he surprises Barley by painting his new van, the \"Guinevere 2\".

Ian and the goat girl come across a booth hosted by three evil mermaids. The mermaids sing their mesmerizing song to lure the two into staying in one of three houses put for rent. Ian tries to silence them with the staff but the spell is too weak. When Ian and the goat girl are finally in a trance, the mermaids place them in one of the houses. The house they are in starts to sink into the ground.\n\nThe goat girl was omitted because the filmmakers want the film to focus on the relationship between Ian and Barley.

In September 2018, Pixar rented Daniher's \"Vanicorn\", a van decorated with a unicorn-themed mural, for use in a one-day festival. She learned about the production of ''Onward'' in May 2019 and, after seeing images of the van used by Ian and Barley Lightfoot in the film, came to believe that Pixar had copied the design of the Vanicorn in violation of her rental agreement with the company, as well as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], the [[Visual Artists Rights Act]], and the California Artists Protection Act. She sought in her suit to prohibit distribution of the film and any infringing advertisements or merchandise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sued-by-artist-unicorn-adorned-van-pixars-onward-1274131|title=Artist Sues Disney, Pixar Over Unicorn-Adorned Van in 'Onward'|last=Cullins|first=Ashley|date=January 28, 2020|website=The Hollywood Reporter|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200129154442/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sued-by-artist-unicorn-adorned-van-pixars-onward-1274131|archive-date=January 29, 2020|access-date=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Onward'' grossed $61.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $41.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $103.2 million.<ref name=\"BOM\"/> It was speculated the gross for the film was significantly [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|affected by the coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-cinema-audiences-decline-film-industry |title=Cinema audiences drop dramatically as coronavirus restrictions bite |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200317010316/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-cinema-audiences-decline-film-industry |archive-date=March 17, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/onward-the-hunt-invisible-man-box-office-coronavirus-1203534409/ |title=Box Office: 'Onward' Leads as Coronavirus Stunts North American Sales |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314224942/https://variety.com/2020/film/news/onward-the-hunt-invisible-man-box-office-coronavirus-1203534409/ |archive-date=March 14, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a31659709/onward-box-office-bloodshot-coronavirus-cinemas/ |title=Bloodshot and Onward suffer during worst US box office weekend in 22 years |date=March 16, 2020 |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324144029/https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a31659709/onward-box-office-bloodshot-coronavirus-cinemas/ |archive-date=March 24, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside ''[[The Way Back (2020 film)|The Way Back]]'' and the wide expansion of ''[[Emma (2020 film)|Emma]]'', and was projected to gross $45\u201350 million from 4,200 theaters in its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2020/03/onward-ben-affleck-the-way-back-box-office-coronavirus-1202873492/ |title=Disney-Pixar's 'Onward' Eyes $100M Global Start, Even With Coronavirus Concerns |last=D'Alessandro |first=Anthony |first2=Nancy |last2=Tartaglione |date=March 3, 2020 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=March 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304013005/https://deadline.com/2020/03/onward-ben-affleck-the-way-back-box-office-coronavirus-1202873492/ |archive-date=March 4, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> The film held early advance screenings on February 29, and made $650,000 from 470 theaters.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/03/01/onward-pixar-my-hero-academia-impractical-jokers-wendy-weekend-box-office/ |title= Weekend Box Office: 'Onward' Sells Out, 'My Hero Academia' Surprises And 'Wendy' Flops |first= Scott |last= Mendleson |date= March 1, 2020 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |website= [[Forbes]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200303203235/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/03/01/onward-pixar-my-hero-academia-impractical-jokers-wendy-weekend-box-office/#449321631858 |archive-date= March 3, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref> It then made $12.1 million on its first day, including $2 million from Thursday night previews.

It received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed $103 million worldwide. The film's financial shortcomings were attributed to the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which resulted in theaters around the globe being closed. Like several other films released in March, it was made available digitally two weeks after its theatrical release.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a world inhabited by [[Legendary creature|mythical creatures]], magic was once commonplace, though difficult to master. After technological advances over the years, magic became obsolete and was largely discarded.\n\nIn a time equivalent to the modern day, Ian Lightfoot, an [[elf]] high-schooler lacking self-confidence, and his older brother Barley, a history and [[role-playing game]] fanatic, live in the city of New Mushroomton. Their father Wilden died shortly before Ian was born, and their mother Laurel has a new boyfriend, [[centaur]] police officer Colt Bronco, whom both Ian and Barley dislike.\n\nOn Ian's sixteenth birthday, Laurel gives the brothers a gift from Wilden: a magical staff, a rare gem, and a letter describing a \"visitation spell\" that can resurrect their father for a single day. Ian accidentally succeeds in casting the spell, but only the lower half of Wilden's body is reformed before the gem disintegrates. The brothers embark on a quest to acquire another gem and complete the spell, taking Barley's beloved [[van]] \"Guinevere\". Finding the boys gone, Laurel leaves to find them.\n\nIan and Barley visit the [[Manticore]]\u2019s Tavern, named for a monster possessing a map to the gem. The tavern has become a [[family restaurant]] managed by the Manticore, legally named The Manticore, also known as \"Corey\". Arguing with Ian over the map, The Manticore realizes how boring her life has become and drives the customers away in a fit of rage, accidentally setting fire to the restaurant and the map. The brothers' only clue to the gem is a children's menu suggesting \"Raven's Point\", a nearby mountain. Laurel later arrives at the scene and befriends The Manticore, who agrees to help her. The Manticore warns that the brothers' journey may awaken a curse that can only be defeated by her special sword, which she and Laurel steal from a [[Pawnbroker|pawn shop]].\n\nTraveling to the mountains, Ian and Barley narrowly escape the police and a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]] of [[pixie]]s,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sims |first1=David |title=Pixar Needs to Make More Movies Like 'Onward' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |date=February 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225005110/https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |archive-date=February 25, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> relying on Ian's newly awakened spell-casting abilities and Barley's role-playing game instincts. \"Raven's Point\" leads them on a trail indicated by a series of [[raven]] statues, but Colt follows them, calling in reinforcements.

Following the statues, the brothers descend through a cave and avoid a series of traps and deadly creatures, surfacing to find themselves in front of Ian's high school. Ian lashes out at Barley for leading them on a wild goose chase and walks away with Wilden.\n\nRereading his list of things he always wished to do with his father, Ian realizes that Barley has been a father figure throughout his entire life, and returns to make amends. Barley discovers the gem inside a historic fountain and retrieves it, unwittingly triggering the curse The Manticore spoke of, which turns the high school into an artificial dragon bent on claiming the gem. Ian faces the artificial dragon, but his staff is knocked into the ocean; he reforms it from a splinter and continues the fight. The Manticore flies in carrying Laurel, who plunges the magic sword into the artificial dragon's heart, buying Ian time to cast the visitation spell and fully reform Wilden's body. Ian sends Barley ahead to give his goodbye to Wilden, and holds off the artificial dragon long enough for Laurel to destroy it. After Wilden dissipates, Barley tells Ian that their father is proud of him, and the brothers share a hug.\n\nIan's confidence and spell-casting improve and he surprises Barley by painting his new van, the \"Guinevere 2\". The Manticore reopens her tavern in its original spirit, drawing in customers with tales of past adventures, and Ian and Barley continue questing.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as Ian Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /> a teenaged [[elf]] who is Barley's younger brother and Laurel and Wilden's son.\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Barley Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook>{{cite web |url=https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html |title=Breaking: First Look at Characters Ian and Barley Lightfoot from Pixar's Suburban Fantasy Film, 'Onward' (In Theaters March 6, 2020) |work=Pixar Post |access-date=May 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529172427/https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html|archive-date=May 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Ian's older brother, and Laurel and Wilden's son who longs for a magical quest.\n* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as Laurel Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /><ref name=\"Clips\">{{cite web |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/ |title=D23: Pixar Brings New Onward Clips |last=White |first=James |date=August 25, 2019 |website=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |accessdate=August 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190825105550/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/|archive-date=August 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> the widowed mother of Ian and Barley.\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as The \"Corey\" Manticore, a [[manticore]] restaurant owner and former adventurer whom Ian and Barley go to for help on their quest.\n* [[Mel Rodriguez]] as Colt Bronco, a [[centaur]] police officer and Laurel's new husband.<ref name=twit3600/>\n* [[Kyle Bornheimer]] as Wilden Lightfoot, Ian and Barley's late father and Laurel's late husband.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Lena Waithe]] as Specter, a [[cyclops]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|title=Disney-Pixar's \"Onward\" Will Feature the First Openly LGBTQ Character|date=February 22, 2020|via=Inside the Magic|access-date=February 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222040111/https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|archive-date=February 22, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|title=Pixar's first out gay character to be voiced by Lena Waithe in 'Onward'|last=Frishberg|first=Hannah|date=February 24, 2020|website=[[New York Post]]|access-date=February 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225133013/https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|archive-date=February 25, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Ali Wong]] as Gore, a [[faun]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|title=Behold: Character posters for #PixarOnward, including newly-announced cast @AliWong, @LenaWaithe, and @_MelRodriguez_.\u2728 Check back tomorrow to see the brand-new trailer for the film|via=[[Twitter]]|access-date=December 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191217032256/https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|archive-date=December 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Dewdrop, a [[pixie]] and the leader of the Pixie Dusters [[Outlaw motorcycle club|biker gang]].<ref name=\"btva\"/>\n* [[Tracey Ullman]] as Grecklin, a [[goblin]] pawn shop owner.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Wilmer Valderrama]] as Gaxton, an elf and college friend of Wilden.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* George Psarras as Avel, an elf police officer.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Fenwick, a cyclops construction worker.<ref name=\"WholeCast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|title=Stars attended the world premiere of Disney Pixar's \"Onward\" at the El Capitan Theatre on Feb. 18, 2020 in Hollywood, Calif.|website=Daily News|location=New York|accessdate=February 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221191311/https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|archive-date=February 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production ==\n===Development===\nIn July 2017, Pixar announced a \"suburban fantasy world\" film at the [[D23 Expo]], with Scanlon directing and Rae producing.<ref name=\"Synopsis\"/> The film was inspired by the death of Scanlon's father, when he and his brother were younger, and their relationship.

In September 2018, Pixar rented Daniher's \"Vanicorn\", a van decorated with a unicorn-themed mural, for use in a one-day festival. She learned about the production of ''Onward'' in May 2019 and, after seeing images of the van used by Ian and Barley Lightfoot in the film, came to believe that Pixar had copied the design of the Vanicorn in violation of her rental agreement with the company, as well as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], the [[Visual Artists Rights Act]], and the California Artists Protection Act. She sought in her suit to prohibit distribution of the film and any infringing advertisements or merchandise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sued-by-artist-unicorn-adorned-van-pixars-onward-1274131|title=Artist Sues Disney, Pixar Over Unicorn-Adorned Van in 'Onward'|last=Cullins|first=Ashley|date=January 28, 2020|website=The Hollywood Reporter|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200129154442/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sued-by-artist-unicorn-adorned-van-pixars-onward-1274131|archive-date=January 29, 2020|access-date=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Onward'' grossed $61.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $41.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $103.2 million.<ref name=\"BOM\"/> It was speculated the gross for the film was significantly [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|affected by the coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-cinema-audiences-decline-film-industry |title=Cinema audiences drop dramatically as coronavirus restrictions bite |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200317010316/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-cinema-audiences-decline-film-industry |archive-date=March 17, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/onward-the-hunt-invisible-man-box-office-coronavirus-1203534409/ |title=Box Office: 'Onward' Leads as Coronavirus Stunts North American Sales |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314224942/https://variety.com/2020/film/news/onward-the-hunt-invisible-man-box-office-coronavirus-1203534409/ |archive-date=March 14, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a31659709/onward-box-office-bloodshot-coronavirus-cinemas/ |title=Bloodshot and Onward suffer during worst US box office weekend in 22 years |date=March 16, 2020 |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324144029/https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a31659709/onward-box-office-bloodshot-coronavirus-cinemas/ |archive-date=March 24, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside ''[[The Way Back (2020 film)|The Way Back]]'' and the wide expansion of ''[[Emma (2020 film)|Emma]]'', and was projected to gross $45\u201350 million from 4,200 theaters in its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2020/03/onward-ben-affleck-the-way-back-box-office-coronavirus-1202873492/ |title=Disney-Pixar's 'Onward' Eyes $100M Global Start, Even With Coronavirus Concerns |last=D'Alessandro |first=Anthony |first2=Nancy |last2=Tartaglione |date=March 3, 2020 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=March 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304013005/https://deadline.com/2020/03/onward-ben-affleck-the-way-back-box-office-coronavirus-1202873492/ |archive-date=March 4, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> The film held early advance screenings on February 29, and made $650,000 from 470 theaters.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/03/01/onward-pixar-my-hero-academia-impractical-jokers-wendy-weekend-box-office/ |title= Weekend Box Office: 'Onward' Sells Out, 'My Hero Academia' Surprises And 'Wendy' Flops |first= Scott |last= Mendleson |date= March 1, 2020 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |website= [[Forbes]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200303203235/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/03/01/onward-pixar-my-hero-academia-impractical-jokers-wendy-weekend-box-office/#449321631858 |archive-date= March 3, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref> It then made $12.1 million on its first day, including $2 million from Thursday night previews.

The caller called Commissioner Miller's office five times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of public phone boxes in the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact, Commissioner Miller and Victoria's [[Premier of Victoria | Premier]]; [[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria) | John Cain]] announced the $500,000 as a reward. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old pharmacist; Vladimir Rhychta who was later arrested on the 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect driving a Commodore identical to the bomb car just before the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> In a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table. Crupi was later arrested by detectives in Sydney and was brought back to Melbourne. Under police questioning, Crupi admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street but stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria | Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On the 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria | East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the Daimler crashed. The driver fled on foot for a few kilometres where he carjacked a passing motorist at gunpoint. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a [[backpack]], containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. The pieces of the number plates; CCH-997 matched to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK) | VK Commodore]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in [[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at [[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on the 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number | VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed. Reed was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in several armed robberies and car thefts, he and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt.

The explosion caused a massive amount of damage to the police station and surrounding buildings, estimated at more than A$1&nbsp;million. The Melbourne newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' reported that the blast's impact was enhanced by the open-floor design of the offices, which had acted like a [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore mine]], sending more shrapnel as the blast ripped through the floors and adding more pressure to the blast as it followed its path.

The caller called the taskforce on several times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of public phone boxes in and around the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old pharmacist; Vladimir Rhychta who was later arrested on the 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect driving a Commodore identical to the bomb car just before the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> In a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table. Crupi was later arrested by detectives in Sydney and was brought back to Melbourne. Under police questioning, Crupi admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street but stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria | Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On the 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria | East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the Daimler crashed. The driver fled on foot for a few kilometres where he carjacked a passing motorist at gunpoint. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a [[backpack]], containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. The pieces of the number plates; CCH-997 matched to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK) | VK Commodore]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in [[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at [[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on the 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number | VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed. Reed was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in several armed robberies and car thefts, he and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing.
