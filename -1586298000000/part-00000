Many of the yeshiva's alumni settle in Yeruham instead of heading to the country's central cities.\n\nThe yeshiva also promotes other programs, among them:\n* ''Ye'adim'' (goals) - Concern of the Ethiopian Jewry in Israel's situation led Yerucham students to create a leadership training program for Ethiopian students with the intention of their returning to their communities. During the 5 years of Hesder the students synchronize their full Yeshiva studies with a [[Bachelor of Education|B.Ed.]] degree in [[Herzog College]].\n* Young Study Partners - First and second year students dedicate 2 hours weekly to studying Torah subjects with children from the local elementary school. They also serve as positive role models for the local youth and look to form a connection with their families.\n* Charity Fund - The goal of the Fund is to help the needy of Yeruham become self-sufficient and better managers of their money. The Fund uses the cooperation of the local welfare and professional financial advisors to this end.\n* ''B'levav Shalem'' Yeshiva High School \u2013 Because of the lack of high quality religious high schools in the [[Negev]], and as a part of the integration program the Hesder Yeshiva believes in, it was decided by alumni, residents of Yerucham, to open a Yeshiva High School for the local and general population.\n\n==Educational staff==\n[[File:\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2.JPG|thumb|Rabbi Blumenzweig]]\nIn addition to Rabbi Blumenzweig, rabbis who teach in the Yeshiva include Rabbis [[Uriel Eitam]], Chaim Wolfson, Shai Gnizi, Shmuel Gleizer, Achiya Ben Pazi, Shmuel Ariel and Elyakim Sharir<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/33/51/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd - \u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4|website=www.yhy.co.il|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>.

Many of the yeshiva's alumni settle in Yeruham instead of heading to the country's central cities.\n\nThe yeshiva also promotes other programs, among them:\n* ''Ye'adim'' (goals) - Concern of the Ethiopian Jewry in Israel's situation led Yerucham students to create a leadership training program for Ethiopian students with the intention of their returning to their communities. During the 5 years of Hesder the students synchronize their full Yeshiva studies with a [[Bachelor of Education|B.Ed.]] degree in [[Herzog College]].\n* Young Study Partners - First and second year students dedicate 2 hours weekly to studying Torah subjects with children from the local elementary school. They also serve as positive role models for the local youth and look to form a connection with their families.\n* Charity Fund - The goal of the Fund is to help the needy of Yeruham become self-sufficient and better managers of their money. The Fund uses the cooperation of the local welfare and professional financial advisors to this end.\n* ''B'levav Shalem'' Yeshiva High School \u2013 Because of the lack of high quality religious high schools in the [[Negev]], and as a part of the integration program the Hesder Yeshiva believes in, it was decided by alumni, residents of Yerucham, to open a Yeshiva High School for the local and general population.\n\n==Educational staff==\n[[File:\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2.JPG|thumb|Rabbi Blumenzweig]]\nIn addition to Rabbi Blumenzweig, rabbis who teach in the Yeshiva include Rabbis [[Uriel Eitam]], Chaim Wolfson, Shai Gnizi, Shmuel Gleizer, Achiya Ben Pazi, Shmuel Ariel and Elyakim Sharir<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/33/51/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd - \u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4|website=www.yhy.co.il|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>.

He reports his findings to the council, but they refuse to listen to him. Ten years later the comet, now called Tycus, is rapidly closing on the Earth. But Tycus is not on a collision course with the Earth; Tycus is going to impact the moon. If Tycus does impact the moon, it will be shattered and the fragments will be pulled in by Earth's gravity.\n\nDr. Crawford begins the construction of a vast city located under the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Mountains]]. His city would provide a safe haven for a few people who would become the beginning of the new age after the catastrophe. A young reporter, Jake Lowe, is investigating the building site when he finds out that only a few people get to inhabit the city. So he requests to Dr. Crawford that he and his pregnant wife be allowed entrance into the city because he discovered the city\u2019s existence. Dr. Crawford agrees as he also wants his wife and daughter in the city. At the same time, a nuclear missile fails to do anything to stop Tycus.\n\nThey plan to fly Crawford's jet to Los Angeles, now in a state of chaos as news of the comet is made public. Jake finds his wife and gets her to the rendezvous point. Unfortunately, someone has already taken the jet so Jake, his wife, and Crawford's family use a pick-up truck to reach the city. Tycus then smashes into the moon, shattering it.\n\nAs the fragments approach, Crawford's group sees a group of people desperately waiting for the doors to the city to open. Crawford activates the elevator and walks towards the door. After they all entered the elevator, Crawford is grabbed by the group of people and he is forced to stay behind. The elevator descends into the underground city.\n\nThe debris starts to rain down to Earth. The fragments obliterate every major city in the world, cause massive disasters like tsunamis, and much of the human race is wiped out.\n\nIn the year 2029, after the Earth has recovered from the disaster, a young woman, implied to be Jake's daughter, tells a group of people sitting in the Sierra Mountains of an ancient world where highways and buildings covered the Earth's surface; she tells of Dr. Crawford, who first discovered the little dot in the sky and how that little dot would lead to the downfall of mankind. As the story continues, She tells of how thousands of moons reminds the survivors of the New Age and we are shown that the pieces left of the moon have formed an asteroid belt around the Earth.\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0156146}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{John Putch}}\n\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:American disaster films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Impact event films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:1990s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:1990s drama films]]\n[[Category:New York City in fiction]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Putch]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1989]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1999]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2029]]\n[[Category:1998 directorial debut films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{All plot|date=June 2019}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Tycus\n| image          = \n| alt            = \n| caption        = \n| film name      = \n| director       = [[John Putch]]\n| producer       = \n| screenplay     = {{Plainlist|\n* Kevin Goetz\n* Michael Goetz \n}}\n| based on       = \n| starring       = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Dennis Hopper]]\n* [[Peter Onorati]]\n* [[Finola Hughes]]\n* Alexander Cleir\n* [[Amy Steel]]\n}}\n| music          = \n| cinematography = \n| editing        = \n| distributor    = \n| released       = {{Film date|df=yes|1998|08|08|United States}}\n| runtime        =  94 minutes\n| country        = \n| language       = English\n| budget         = \n| gross          = \n| production companies = \n}}\n\n'''''Tycus''''' is a 1998 [[direct-to-video]] film directed by [[John Putch]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a2127/tycus/|title=Tycus|last=Wilkes|first=Neil|date=2001-03-01|website=Digital Spy|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blurayauthority.com/standard-dvd/tycus/|title=Review {{!}} Tycus|last=blurayauthority|date=2012-01-28|website=Blu-ray Authority|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> and starring [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Peter Onorati]], [[Finola Hughes]], Alexander Cleir and [[Amy Steel]].

He has been working as an artist in California since the early 1980s. Frame has been given Grants and Awards from the National Endowment for the Arts, the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He has participated in group exhibitions around the world and has had major solo exhibitions at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Long Beach Museum of Art, and the Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens. After five years of preparation, Part One of \"The Tale of the Crippled Boy\", a sweeping project incorporating sculpture, photography, installation, music and film, premiered at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California in March 2011.\n\n==Life==\nFrame was born in [[Colton, California]]. His father, Rudolph Randolph Frame, had only a third-grade education and was a welder and sheet metal worker for the Santa Fe Railway.<ref name=seed>Seed, John.

He has two siblings, Robert Wayne Frame (born 1931) and Phyllis Louise Frame Runyon (born 1943). After his graduation from the Colton School District, he attended [[San Diego State University]] from 1968 to 1969 and then left Southern California. During the following four years, he traveled through Europe and North America. He held multiple jobs including assistant manager of a discount department store, gas station attendant, bookstore employee, dishwasher, library assistant, and construction worker. From 1970 to 1971 he was employed by the state psychiatric hospital of New Hampshire as a psychiatric aide for the criminally insane. He returned to Southern California in 1972 and completed an undergraduate degree in English at San Diego State University in 1975.<ref name=enigma>Fuglie, Gordon, and Nygren, Edward J.

He graduated with an MFA.<ref name=enigma/> In 1980, John and Laura Frame purchased their first home in Wrightwood, California where Laura had obtained a teaching position in the local elementary school. At the same time John, along with three fellow artists, (Randall Lavender, Eve Steele, and Lynn Roylance) leased a {{convert|14,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building in downtown Los Angeles, known as the Firestone building, and began converting it to artists' studios. Although this project was never completed, it became the first artist-in-residence complex to come under the Los Angeles live/work residency ordinance for artists. Frame\u2019s studio was located there from 1980 until 1991. From 1992 until 2001 the artist's primary studio was located in the Santa Fe art colony in downtown Los Angeles. He also maintained a small working studio at his home in Wrightwood. During the years at the Santa Fe colony, his studio became a focal point for many of the figurative artists working in the Los Angeles area including Jim Doolan, Lauren Richardson, Jon Swihart, Peter Zokosky, Enjeong Noh, Brian Apthorp, [[F.

(''To Hear the Sirens' Song and Live'', the earliest work appearing in his 2005 retrospective show, was created in 1980.) <ref name=enigma/>\n\nAlthough Frame received an MFA, he had no formal training in sculpture. His sculptural works were initially roughly-hewn, somewhat coarse studies of the human form. Though the refinement of his technical skill is evident in the stylistic changes in his work over the years, he has remained primarily a figurative sculptor with a humanistic, expressionist bent.<ref name=enigma/><ref name=walsh/> His work draws on a tradition of fragmented figuration that dates back to the Renaissance and is visible in works of Rodin, Brancusi, and Giacometti.<ref name=quarterly>''John Frame''.

(Anonymous Review)</ref> This focus represents a conscious departure from the abstract and conceptualist art that was popular when he attended graduate school and that has continued to dominate from an academic point of view.<ref name=walsh/> Instead, in addition to the Renaissance, Frame's work has drawn from older traditions, including Greek tragedy and medieval art and spiritual practice (altarpieces, reliquary, morality plays, Italian Commedia dell'arte,and hagiography).<ref name=creative>Pagel, David.

In the mid-1990s, he began to incorporate found objects into his pieces, a practice he has continued into the present.<ref name=enigma/><ref name=crippled/> Thus, he has been said to be a part of the California assemblage tradition.<ref name=enigma/> In the late 1990s, Frame's interest in literature began to be reflected directly in his work as he juxtaposed image and text in relief carving. Relief carvings reference, among others, Keats (''Here lies one whose name was writ in water'') and Blake (''Some are born to sweet delight; some are born to endless night''). Literary allusions have also appeared frequently in his titles, whose referents include Shakespeare (''As water is in water'', ''Poor Tom''), the Bible (''Noli me Tangere''), and Wilfred Owen (''All A Poet Can Do Is Warn'').<ref name=enigma/>\nIn addition to these explicitly referenced sources, Frame cites other artists among his influences, among them writers Emily Dickinson, Leo Tolstoy, Simone Weil, and Fyodor Dostoevsky, and directors Kurosawa, Tarkovsky, and Fellini, and Bergman. (He credits the latter with helping him realize that he was to be an artist.) He has also been deeply influenced by classical music.<ref name=seed/>\n\nFrame's sculpture has been described as tragic, theatrical, enigmatic,<ref name=enigma/> fragmented, and formally inventive.<ref name=morgan/> Critics generally note that his work is concerned, in subject and content, with \u201cthe deepest dilemmas of life\u201d.<ref name=cosi>Ackerman, Gerald M.

''Breaking the Figure,'' Image Magazine, 2004.Illus. and Cover Illus.</ref> His work has been criticized for its approach to gender (his figures are generally perceived as male, though the artist has said that he perceives them as \u201cgenderless\u201d) <ref name=enigma/> and sexuality. In particular, his 1995 piece ''Strapping Boy'' has proved disturbing for many who feel that its implied narrative is one of sexual abuse. Critic Gerald Ackerman has interpreted the piece thus: \u201c[it] gives us an unwelcome and unsettling realization of the ambiguity of both sexuality and affection, and of the troubles their impulsive interweaving can engender\u201d.<ref name=cosi/> These criticisms aside, those who review Frame's work frequently cite that its appeal lies in his propensity to probe the deep questions of life without arriving at easy answers. One critic captures this tension thus: \u201c[In Frame's work] the meaning eludes us while the search for meaning captivates us.\u201d <ref name=weisberg/>\n\n==''The Tale of the Crippled Boy: Three Fragments of a Lost Tale''==\n[[File:o man thumb.jpg|thumb|x220px|alt=O-man looks to the sky|''O-man'' from \"The Tale of the Crippled Boy,\" 2011]]\nIn 2005, Frame began to take his work in a new direction. That year, he conceived and began to execute the work that would form his largest exhibition to date. (The work, entitled ''The Tale of the Crippled Boy: Three Fragments of a Lost Tale'' was exhibited at the Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens from March\u2013June 2011.) The installation is unique in the artist's career in that it includes not only thirty-five pieces of sculpture but also sets, photography and animated vignettes, all based around an eclectic cast of sculpted characters, most of whom are fully articulated, with moving fingers, bodies, and jaws. The exhibition also includes an 8-minute documentary on the artist's process, directed by filmmaker Johnny Coffeen.<ref name=crippled/>\nThis departure from Frame's past work was not totally unanticipated; David Pagel, in a review of the artist's 2005 retrospective, noted \u201cIf John Frame were in the movie business, he would be a costume designer, stylist, set decorator, prop master, lighting specialist, writer, director, editor, producer, agent and publicist all rolled into one do it yourself lover of every little detail of every little job.\u201d <ref name=theatrical>Pagel, David. ''A Theatrical World Strangely Like Ours,'' Los Angeles Times, Feb. 5, 2005. Illus.</ref> And, in fact, Frame has completed this project (including music, lighting, and photography) with only the help of a few friends and family members.\n\nThe work also shares thematic consistency with the artist's previous work, according to curators Kevin Murphy and Jessica Todd Smith, who state, \u201cIn keeping with the work John Frame has created throughout his career, the tale and the art associated with it evoke universal human themes\u2014the nature of good and evil, the inevitability of death, and the struggle to find meaning in life\u2014but always in a connotative rather than denotative manner.\u201d <ref name=crippled/>\n\nThe artist anticipates continuing the project, eventually producing a full-length film.\n\n==Solo exhibitions==\n* 2012 [[Portland Art Museum]], Stott Gallery, Portland, Oregon\n* 2011 The Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens, San Marino, California\n* 2005 Long Beach Museum of Art, Long Beach, California\n* 1999 Kohn/Turner Gallery, Los Angeles, California\n* 1996 Kohn/Turner Gallery, Los Angeles, California\n* 1993 Jan Turner Gallery, Los Angeles, California\n* 1992 Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, California\n* 1990 Jan Turner Gallery, Los Angeles, California\n* 1987 Jan Turner Gallery, Los Angeles, California\n* 1984 Janus Gallery, Los Angeles, California\n* 1983 Installation Gallery, San Diego, California\n* 1982 Janus Gallery, Los Angeles, California\n* Mattingly Baker Gallery, Dallas, Texas\n* 1981 Francine Seders Gallery, Seattle, Washington <ref name=enigma/><ref name=crippled/>\n\n==Group exhibitions, awards, and honors==\nJohn Frame has received grants and awards from the National Endowment for the Arts (Visual Fellowship Grant, 1984, 1986), the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (New Talent Award, 1985), and the J.

His sculptural works were initially roughly-hewn, somewhat coarse studies of the human form. Though the refinement of his technical skill is evident in the stylistic changes in his work over the years, he has remained primarily a figurative sculptor with a humanistic, expressionist bent.<ref name=enigma/><ref name=walsh/> His work draws on a tradition of fragmented figuration that dates back to the Renaissance and is visible in works of Rodin, Brancusi, and Giacometti.<ref name=quarterly>''John Frame''.

In the mid-90's, he began to incorporate found objects into his pieces, a practice he has continued into the present.<ref name=enigma/><ref name=crippled/> Thus, he has been said to be a part of the California assemblage tradition.<ref name=enigma/> In the late 1990s, Frame's interest in literature began to be reflected directly in his work as he juxtaposed image and text in relief carving. Relief carvings reference, among others, Keats (''Here lies one whose name was writ in water'') and Blake (''Some are born to sweet delight; some are born to endless night''). Literary allusions have also appeared frequently in his titles, whose referents include Shakespeare (''As water is in water'', ''Poor Tom''), the Bible (''Noli me Tangere''), and Wilfred Owen (''All A Poet Can Do Is Warn'').<ref name=enigma/>\nIn addition to these explicitly referenced sources, Frame cites other artists among his influences, among them writers Emily Dickinson, Leo Tolstoy, Simone Weil, and Fyodor Dostoevsky, and directors Kurosawa, Tarkovsky, and Fellini, and Bergman. (He credits the latter with helping him realize that he was to be an artist.) He has also been deeply influenced by classical music.<ref name=seed/>\n\nFrame's sculpture has been described as tragic, theatrical, enigmatic,<ref name=enigma/> fragmented, and formally inventive.<ref name=morgan/> Critics generally note that his work is concerned, in subject and content, with \u201cthe deepest dilemmas of life\u201d.<ref name=cosi>Ackerman, Gerald M.

''Breaking the Figure,'' Image Magazine, 2004.Illus. and Cover Illus.</ref> His work has been criticized for its approach to gender (his figures are generally perceived as male, though the artist has said that he perceives them as \u201cgenderless\u201d) <ref name=enigma/> and sexuality. In particular, his 1995 piece ''Strapping Boy'' has proved disturbing for many who feel that its implied narrative is one of sexual abuse. Critic Gerald Ackerman has interpreted the piece thus: \u201c[it] gives us an unwelcome and unsettling realization of the ambiguity of both sexuality and affection, and of the troubles their impulsive interweaving can engender\u201d.<ref name=cosi/> These criticisms aside, those who review Frame's work frequently cite that its appeal lies in his propensity to probe the deep questions of life without arriving at easy answers. One critic captures this tension thus: \u201c[In Frame's work] the meaning eludes us while the search for meaning captivates us.\u201d <ref name=weisberg/>\n\n==''The Tale of the Crippled Boy: Three Fragments of a Lost Tale''==\n[[File:o man thumb.jpg|thumb|x220px|alt=O-man looks to the sky|''O-man'' from \"The Tale of the Crippled Boy,\" 2011]]\nIn 2005, Frame began to take his work in a new direction. That year, he conceived and began to execute the work that would form his largest exhibition to date. (The work, entitled ''The Tale of the Crippled Boy: Three Fragments of a Lost Tale'' was exhibited at the Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens from March\u2013June 2011.) The installation is unique in the artist's career in that it includes not only thirty-five pieces of sculpture but also sets, photography and animated vignettes, all based around an eclectic cast of sculpted characters, most of whom are fully articulated, with moving fingers, bodies, and jaws. The exhibition also includes an 8-minute documentary on the artist's process, directed by filmmaker Johnny Coffeen.<ref name=crippled/>\nThis departure from Frame's past work was not totally unanticipated; David Pagel, in a review of the artist's 2005 retrospective, noted \u201cIf John Frame were in the movie business, he would be a costume designer, stylist, set decorator, prop master, lighting specialist, writer, director, editor, producer, agent and publicist all rolled into one do it yourself lover of every little detail of every little job.\u201d <ref name=theatrical>Pagel, David. ''A Theatrical World Strangely Like Ours,'' Los Angeles Times, Feb. 5, 2005. Illus.</ref> And, in fact, Frame has completed this project (including music, lighting, and photography) with only the help of a few friends and family members.\n\nThe work also shares thematic consistency with the artist's previous work, according to curators Kevin Murphy and Jessica Todd Smith, who state, \u201cIn keeping with the work John Frame has created throughout his career, the tale and the art associated with it evoke universal human themes\u2014the nature of good and evil, the inevitability of death, and the struggle to find meaning in life\u2014but always in a connotative rather than denotative manner.\u201d <ref name=crippled/>\n\nThe artist anticipates continuing the project, eventually producing a full-length film.\n\n==Solo exhibitions==\n* 2012 [[Portland Art Museum]], Stott Gallery, Portland, Oregon\n* 2011 The Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens, San Marino, California\n* 2005 Long Beach Museum of Art, Long Beach, California\n* 1999 Kohn/Turner Gallery, Los Angeles, California\n* 1996 Kohn/Turner Gallery, Los Angeles, California\n* 1993 Jan Turner Gallery, Los Angeles, California\n* 1992 Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, California\n* 1990 Jan Turner Gallery, Los Angeles, California\n* 1987 Jan Turner Gallery, Los Angeles, California\n* 1984 Janus Gallery, Los Angeles, California\n* 1983 Installation Gallery, San Diego, California\n* 1982 Janus Gallery, Los Angeles, California\n* Mattingly Baker Gallery, Dallas, Texas\n* 1981 Francine Seders Gallery, Seattle, Washington <ref name=enigma/><ref name=crippled/>\n\n==Group exhibitions, awards, and honors==\nJohn Frame has received grants and awards from the National Endowment for the Arts (Visual Fellowship Grant, 1984, 1986), the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (New Talent Award, 1985), and the J.

Her legal office has given many women free legal assistance to defend their rights. Madame Diarra was Vice President of the International Federation of Women in Legal Careers (FIFCJ) from 1994 to 1997. She has also been vice president of the Federation of African Lawyers since March 1995 and has attended several courses on the legal position of women and children in Mali and in Africa.
