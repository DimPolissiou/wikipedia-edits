It was released on June 1, 2018, through [[GOOD Music]] and distributed by [[Def Jam Recordings]]. Following controversy surrounding an interview with [[TMZ]], West re-recorded all the work on the album, with him completing it over the course of just two weeks at West Lake Ranch in [[Jackson Hole|Jackson Hole, Wyoming]]. \n\nGuest vocals from [[PartyNextDoor]], [[Ty Dolla Sign]], [[Kid Cudi]], [[Jeremih]], and [[070 Shake]], among others, are included on ''Ye''. West produced it with [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]], alongside numerous others. Succeeding the release of [[Pusha T]]'s ''[[Daytona (album)|Daytona]]'', the album is the second of five seven-track albums produced by West in what have been referred to as the \"Wyoming Sessions\", and set to be released weekly. It preceded the release of West's collaborative album with Kid Cudi, as [[Kids See Ghosts]], titled ''[[Kids See Ghosts (album)|Kids See Ghosts]]''. The latter's release was succeeded by that of [[Nas]]' ''[[Nasir (album)|Nasir]]'', and [[Teyana Taylor]]'s ''[[K.T.S.E.]]''. \n\n\"[[Yikes (song)|Yikes]]\" and \"[[All Mine (Kanye West song)|All Mine]]\" were released as singles in the summer of 2018 in support of ''Ye'', with a [[lyric video]] being released for the latter simultaneously with one for non-single \"[[Violent Crimes (song)|Violent Crimes]]\". Both of the singles attained top 20 positions on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], while the album received generally favorable reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. The majority of them drew comparisons between the latter and West's previous works, while other critics had somewhat mixed feelings towards the lyrical content. It was named as one of the best albums of 2018 by multiple publications, including ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''.\n\n''Ye'' became West's eighth consecutive album to debut at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], tying him with [[Eminem]]'s record. It was also a chart topper in Australia, Canada, Estonia, Ireland and New Zealand, while reaching the top five in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The album has since been certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] and silver by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI), respectively.\n\n==Background and recording==\nOn February 24, 2016, West tweeted that his eighth studio album would be released during the summer of that year under the title of ''Turbo Grafx 16'', naming it after [[TurboGrafx-16|the video game console of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Byford|first=Sam|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/27/11125294/kanye-west-new-album-turbografx-16|title=Kanye West says his new album is called Turbo Grafx 16 and coming this summer.|website=[[The Verge]]|date=February 27, 2016|accessdate=September 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612143845/https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/27/11125294/kanye-west-new-album-turbografx-16|archive-date=June 12, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> West associate Ibn Jasper posted a photo on [[Instagram]] showing West with longtime collaborators [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]], [[Plain Pat]], and [[Kid Cudi]] in a recording studio working on the album.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rap-up.com/2016/02/29/kanye-west-kid-cudi-hit-the-studio-for-turbo-grafx-16/|title=Kanye West and Kid Cudi Hit the Studio for 'Turbo Grafx 16'|website=[[Rap-Up]]|date=February 29, 2016|access-date=July 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717185550/https://www.rap-up.com/2016/02/29/kanye-west-kid-cudi-hit-the-studio-for-turbo-grafx-16/|archive-date=July 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In March 2016, [[Quavo]] posted an image on his Instagram of him in a studio with West, with \"''TURBO GRAFX 16''\" written on the wall behind them.

rapper and producer [[Kanye West]]. It was released on June 1, 2018, through [[GOOD Music]] and distributed by [[Def Jam Recordings]]. Following controversy surrounding an interview with [[TMZ]], West re-recorded all the work on the album, with him completing it over the course of just two weeks at West Lake Ranch in [[Jackson Hole|Jackson Hole, Wyoming]]. \n\nGuest vocals from [[PartyNextDoor]], [[Ty Dolla Sign]], [[Kid Cudi]], [[Jeremih]], and [[070 Shake]], among others, are included on ''Ye''. West produced it with [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]], alongside numerous others. Succeeding the release of [[Pusha T]]'s ''[[Daytona (album)|Daytona]]'', the album is the second of five seven-track albums produced by West in what have been referred to as the \"Wyoming Sessions\", and set to be released weekly. It preceded the release of West's collaborative album with Kid Cudi, as [[Kids See Ghosts]], titled ''[[Kids See Ghosts (album)|Kids See Ghosts]]''. The latter's release was succeeded by that of [[Nas]]' ''[[Nasir (album)|Nasir]]'', and [[Teyana Taylor]]'s ''[[K.T.S.E.]]''. \n\n\"[[Yikes (song)|Yikes]]\" and \"[[All Mine (Kanye West song)|All Mine]]\" were released as singles in the summer of 2018 in support of ''Ye'', with a [[lyric video]] being released for the latter simultaneously with one for non-single \"[[Violent Crimes (song)|Violent Crimes]]\". Both of the singles attained top 20 positions on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], while the album received generally favorable reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. The majority of them drew comparisons between the latter and West's previous works, while other critics had somewhat mixed feelings towards the lyrical content. It was named as one of the best albums of 2018 by multiple publications, including ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''.\n\n''Ye'' became West's eighth consecutive album to debut at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], tying him with [[Eminem]]'s record. It was also a chart topper in Australia, Canada, Estonia, Ireland and New Zealand, while reaching the top five in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The album has since been certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] and silver by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI), respectively.\n\n==Background and recording==\nOn February 24, 2016, West tweeted that his eighth studio album would be released during the summer of that year under the title of ''Turbo Grafx 16'', naming it after [[TurboGrafx-16|the video game console of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Byford|first=Sam|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/27/11125294/kanye-west-new-album-turbografx-16|title=Kanye West says his new album is called Turbo Grafx 16 and coming this summer.|website=[[The Verge]]|date=February 27, 2016|accessdate=September 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612143845/https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/27/11125294/kanye-west-new-album-turbografx-16|archive-date=June 12, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> West associate Ibn Jasper posted a photo on [[Instagram]] showing West with longtime collaborators [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]], [[Plain Pat]], and [[Kid Cudi]] in a recording studio working on the album.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rap-up.com/2016/02/29/kanye-west-kid-cudi-hit-the-studio-for-turbo-grafx-16/|title=Kanye West and Kid Cudi Hit the Studio for 'Turbo Grafx 16'|website=[[Rap-Up]]|date=February 29, 2016|access-date=July 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717185550/https://www.rap-up.com/2016/02/29/kanye-west-kid-cudi-hit-the-studio-for-turbo-grafx-16/|archive-date=July 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In March 2016, [[Quavo]] posted an image on his Instagram of him in a studio with West, with \"''TURBO GRAFX 16''\" written on the wall behind them.

Its coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to high-temperature, low-water, [[desert]] environments. Also, its hearing is sensitive enough to hear [[prey]] moving underground. It mainly eats [[Insect|insects]], small [[Mammal|mammals]], and [[Bird|birds]].\n\nThe fennec has a life span of up to 14 years in captivity and about 10 years in the wild. Its main predators are the African varieties of [[Verreaux's eagle-owl|eagle owl]], [[Jackal|jackals]], and other large mammals. Families of fennecs dig out [[Burrow|dens]] in the sand for habitation and protection, which can be as large as {{convert|120|sqm|0|abbr=on}} and adjoin the dens of other families. Precise population figures are not known but are estimated from the frequency of sightings; these indicate that the animal is currently not threatened by extinction. Knowledge of social interactions is limited to information gathered from captive animals. The species is usually assigned to the genus ''[[Vulpes]]''; however, this is debated due to differences between the fennec fox and other fox species. The fennec's fur is prized by the indigenous peoples of North Africa, and in some parts of the world, the animal is considered an [[exotic pet]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe fennec fox weighs about {{convert|0.7|-|1.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, with a body length of between {{convert|24|-|41|cm|0|abbr=on}}; it is around {{convert|20.3|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall.

Males tend to show more [[aggression]] and [[Urination|urine-marking]] around the time of the females' [[estrous cycle]]. They have been seen to bury feces by pushing [[soil]] with their noses or hind feet when in captivity. Much remains unknown of their basic ecology and behavior in the wild, and a 2004 report by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] stated that \"in-depth study of the species, with particular emphasis on habitat use and population dynamics in the wild, is overdue.\"<ref name=\"canids\"/>\n\n=== Diet and hunting ===\n[[File:Fennecus zerda 05 MWNH 1387.JPG|thumb|right|Skull]]\n\nThe fennec fox is an omnivore.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.25225/fozo.v61.i1.a10.2012|title = First quantitative data on the diet of the fennec fox, Vulpes zerda (Canidae, Carnivora), in Algeria|journal = Folia Zoologica|volume = 61|pages = 61\u201370|year = 2012|last1 = Brahmi|first1 = Karima|last2 = Khechekhouche|first2 = El Amin|last3 = Mostefaoui|first3 = Otman|last4 = Doumandji|first4 = Salaheddine|last5 = Baziz|first5 = Belkacem|last6 = Aulagnier|first6 = St\u00e9phane}}</ref> Food sources include [[rodent]]s, [[insect]]s, [[bird]]s, [[egg (biology)|egg]]s,<ref name=\"seaworld\"/> and rabbits.<ref>[http://www.canids.org/species/Fennec_fox.pdf Fennec fox] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110085838/http://www.canids.org/species/Fennec_fox.pdf |date=10 November 2011 }}. canids.org</ref><ref>Alderton, p. 144.</ref> An individual can jump up to {{convert|2|ft|cm|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|4|ft|cm|abbr=on}} forward, which helps it catch prey and escape predators.<ref name=\"nobleman\"/> When hunting, large-eared foxes such as the fennec, or the [[bat-eared fox]], can seem to stare at the ground while they rotate their heads from side to side to pinpoint the location of prey, either underground or hidden above ground.<ref name=\"rogers\">{{cite book|title=Spirit of the Wild Dog: The World of Wolves, Coyotes, Foxes, Jackals and Dingoes |last=Rogers |first=Leslie J.|year=2003 |publisher=Allen & Unwin |isbn=978-1-86508-673-6|pages=46\u201347 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GndDw_cxV1UC|accessdate=19 December 2009}}</ref> There are reports that fennec foxes climb date palms while foraging for fruit; however, some experts consider these reports unlikely unless low branches are available for support.<ref>Alderton, pp. 144\u20135.</ref>\n\nThe species can live without free water, as its [[kidney]]s are adapted to restrict water loss.

Its name comes from this species' name in [[Arabic languages|Arabic]]: ''fanak'' ({{Lang|ar|\u0641\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0643}})''.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fennec|title=Definition of FENNEC|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> The fennec is the smallest species of [[canid]]. Its coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to high-temperature, low-water, [[desert]] environments. Also, its hearing is sensitive enough to hear [[prey]] moving underground. It mainly eats [[Insect|insects]], small [[Mammal|mammals]], and [[Bird|birds]].\n\nThe fennec has a life span of up to 14 years in captivity and about 10 years in the wild. Its main predators are the African varieties of [[Verreaux's eagle-owl|eagle owl]], [[Jackal|jackals]], and other large mammals. Families of fennecs dig out [[Burrow|dens]] in the sand for habitation and protection, which can be as large as {{convert|120|sqm|0|abbr=on}} and adjoin the dens of other families. Precise population figures are not known but are estimated from the frequency of sightings; these indicate that the animal is currently not threatened by extinction. Knowledge of social interactions is limited to information gathered from captive animals. The species is usually assigned to the genus ''[[Vulpes]]''; however, this is debated due to differences between the fennec fox and other fox species. The fennec's fur is prized by the indigenous peoples of North Africa, and in some parts of the world, the animal is considered an [[exotic pet]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe fennec fox weighs about {{convert|0.7|-|1.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, with a body length of between {{convert|24|-|41|cm|0|abbr=on}}; it is around {{convert|20.3|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall.

The basic social unit is thought to be a mated pair and their offspring, and the young of the previous year are believed to remain in the family even after a new litter is born. Playing behavior is common, including with adults of the species.<ref name=\"canids\"/> Fennec foxes make a variety of sounds, including barking, a purring sound similar to that of a domestic cat, and a snarl if threatened.<ref>Alderton, p. 146.</ref>\n\nCaptive animals engage in highly social behaviors, typically resting while in contact with each other. Males tend to show more [[aggression]] and [[Urination|urine-marking]] around the time of the females' [[estrous cycle]]. They have been seen to bury feces by pushing [[soil]] with their noses or hind feet when in captivity. Much remains unknown of their basic ecology and behavior in the wild, and a 2004 report by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] stated that \"in-depth study of the species, with particular emphasis on habitat use and population dynamics in the wild, is overdue.\"<ref name=\"canids\"/>\n\n=== Diet and hunting ===\n[[File:Fennecus zerda 05 MWNH 1387.JPG|thumb|right|Skull]]\n\nThe fennec fox is an omnivore.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.25225/fozo.v61.i1.a10.2012|title = First quantitative data on the diet of the fennec fox, Vulpes zerda (Canidae, Carnivora), in Algeria|journal = Folia Zoologica|volume = 61|pages = 61\u201370|year = 2012|last1 = Brahmi|first1 = Karima|last2 = Khechekhouche|first2 = El Amin|last3 = Mostefaoui|first3 = Otman|last4 = Doumandji|first4 = Salaheddine|last5 = Baziz|first5 = Belkacem|last6 = Aulagnier|first6 = St\u00e9phane}}</ref> Food sources include [[rodent]]s, [[insect]]s, [[bird]]s, [[egg (biology)|egg]]s,<ref name=\"seaworld\"/> and rabbits.<ref>[http://www.canids.org/species/Fennec_fox.pdf Fennec fox] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110085838/http://www.canids.org/species/Fennec_fox.pdf |date=10 November 2011 }}. canids.org</ref><ref>Alderton, p. 144.</ref> An individual can jump up to {{convert|2|ft|cm|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|4|ft|cm|abbr=on}} forward, which helps it catch prey and escape predators.<ref name=\"nobleman\"/> When hunting, large-eared foxes such as the fennec, or the [[bat-eared fox]], can seem to stare at the ground while they rotate their heads from side to side to pinpoint the location of prey, either underground or hidden above ground.<ref name=\"rogers\">{{cite book|title=Spirit of the Wild Dog: The World of Wolves, Coyotes, Foxes, Jackals and Dingoes |last=Rogers |first=Leslie J.|year=2003 |publisher=Allen & Unwin |isbn=978-1-86508-673-6|pages=46\u201347 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GndDw_cxV1UC|accessdate=19 December 2009}}</ref> There are reports that fennec foxes climb date palms while foraging for fruit; however, some experts consider these reports unlikely unless low branches are available for support.<ref>Alderton, pp. 144\u20135.</ref>\n\nThe species can live without free water, as its [[kidney]]s are adapted to restrict water loss.

According to the interpretation of this slogan by the founders of the Second Austrian Republic, the ''[[Anschluss]]'' which occurred in 1938 was an act of military aggression by the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. Austrian statehood had been interrupted and therefore the newly revived Austria of 1945 could not and should not be considered responsible for the [[Nuremberg trials|Nazis' crimes]] in any way. The \"[[victim theory]]\" which was formed by 1949 ({{lang-de|Opferthese, Opferdoktrin}}) insisted that all of the Austrians, including those who strongly supported [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], had been unwilling victims of the Nazi regime and were therefore not responsible for its crimes.\n\nThe \"victim theory\" became a fundamental myth in Austrian society. It made it possible for previously bitter political opponents \u2013 i.e. the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|social democrats]] and the [[Austrian People's Party|conservative Catholics]] \u2013 to unite and bring former Nazis back into social and political life for the first time in [[History of Austria|Austrian history]]. For almost half a century, the Austrian state denied the existence of any continuity between it and the political regime which existed in Austria from 1938\u20131945, actively kept up the self-sacrificing myth of Austrian nationhood, and cultivated a conservative spirit of national unity. Postwar [[denazification]] was quickly wound up; veterans of the [[Wehrmacht]] and the [[Waffen-SS]] took an honorable place in society. The struggle for justice by the actual victims of [[Nazism]] \u2013 primarily the [[Jews]] \u2013 was deprecated as an attempt to obtain illicit enrichment at the expense of the entire nation.\n\nIn 1986, the election of a former Wehrmacht intelligence officer, [[Kurt Waldheim]], as a [[List of Federal Presidents of Austria|federal president]] put Austria on the verge of international isolation. Powerful outside pressure and an internal political discussion forced Austrians to reconsider their attitude to the past. Starting with the political administration of the 1990s and followed by most of the Austrian people by the mid-2000s, the nation admitted its collective responsibility for the crimes committed during the Nazi occupation and officially abandoned the \"victim theory\".\n\n== Historical background ==\n{{Main|Anschluss|German nationalism in Austria|German Confederation|German Question|Holy Roman Empire}}\n[[File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|280px|A map of the German Confederation.]]\nThe idea of grouping all [[Germans]] into one nation-state had been the subject of debate in the 19th century from the ending of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until the ending of the [[German Confederation]].

During its existence, the German-speaking Austrians hoped for the empire to dissolve and advocated an ''Anschluss'' with Germany. Following the dissolution of the empire in 1918, the rump state of [[Republic of German-Austria|German-Austria]], was created. Immediately following the publication of humiliating terms of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)]] a drive for unification with Germany appeared, but its practical actions were strictly suppressed by the [[Triple Entente|victory states]].

According to Stalin's addendum the responsibility was not lying on the shoulders of certain people, groups or parties, but the society in whole; there was no way for an Austrian to escape from collective responsibility.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=19}} Stalin, like Churchill, had also considered Austria to be a buffer between Soviet and Anglo-American spheres of influence, and [[Communist International#Dissolution|has not been in a hurry to carry out]] the \"[[export of revolution]]\".{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=19}} His short-term goal was to exploit the surviving Austrian industrial, human and natural resources; probably that's why Stalin insisted on the stricter wording concering responsibility.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=19}} The authors are unlikely to have suspected \"the first victim\" would become an Austrian national theme, which would be carefully cultivated and protected, and determine Austrian foreign policy for many years.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=18}} Moreover, they didn't know that another part of the Declaration \u2013 the Austrian responsibility \u2013 would die on the vine.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=18}}\n\n=== Response of belligerent Austrians ===\n\nDifferent historical schools admit that defeats in 1943 gave rise to doubt amongst the Austrians about the future of the Reich and helped the spread of separatist sentiments.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=186}} But they disagree on the role of this sentiment in history. According to the official post-war Austrian point of view the defeat in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] started a fully fledged \"national awakening\".{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=186}} Soviet historians insisted that in 1943 a new stage of [[Resistance during World War II|resistance]] began in Austria, and the Moscow Declaration proved to be an \"important factor that influenced the Austrian nation\".{{sfn|\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1973|p=135}} Contemporary Western historians believe that there is no reason for drawing firm conclusions about \"awakening\" or \"resistance\".{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=186}} It goes without saying that antihitlerite and separatist sentiments had been spreading both in Vienna and remote places of Austria, but nearly in the same degree as in other lands of the Reich.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|pp=186, 188, 193}} War defeats, Italian withdrawal from war, Anglo-American bombings,    streams of refugees and prisoners facilitated this, but Western historians deny the influence of the Moscow Declaration.

Quite the contrary, the success of the Allies and reactivation of air bombings of Austria only consolidated its population around the figure of the Fuehrer.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=209}}{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|p=163}} During the unsuccessful [[20 July plot]] people of Vienna fully supported Hitler.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=213}}\n\n== Declaration of 'Victimhood' ==\n[[File:Heldendenkmal der Roten Armee, Schwarzenbergplatz Wien 3.JPG|thumb|300px|right|[[Soviet War Memorial (Vienna)|Heroes' Monument of the Red Army in Vienna]].

But the second volume, the \"story of Austrian resistance\", was not published: according to the official version not enough archive evidence was found.{{sfn|Bischof|2004|p=19}} The authors affirmed, for instance, that in 1938 70% of Austrians had not simply been against Anschluss, but they were said to feel a \"fanatic animosity\" against it.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=229}} This is how the myth was established to later become an ideological foundation of the postwar Austria.{{sfn|Steininger|2008|p=13}}{{sfn|Bischof|2004|p=19}}\n\nFounders of the Second Republic probably had a moral right to consider themselves to be victims of political repressions.{{sfn|Steininger|2008|p=14}} Twelve of the seventeen members of the Cabinet of [[Leopold Figl]], that headed the government in December 1945, were persecuted under Dollfuss, Schuschnigg and Hitler.

Propaganda of the feats of the Austrian resistance proved to the Allies the contribution made to the defeat of Nazism, which was required from Austrians by the Moscow Declaration. The other task of anti-fascist propaganda was to find a new ideology that could be relied on by a morally and financially exhausted nation.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=104}} Anti-fascist rhetoric, forced from above, ran through the whole social life of Austria. Broken chains appeared on the [[coat of arms of Austria]] as a symbol of liberation of Austria from \"foreign occupation\" by Germany,{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=41}} memorial tablets and modest temporary monuments in honour of perished anti-fascists were installed in towns{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=209}} (the only big monument of this period, [[Soviet War Memorial (Vienna)|Heroes' Monument of the Red Army in Vienna]], was erected due to insistence of the USSR).{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=210}} Propaganda at all levels praised feats of a few anti-fascist heroes, but carefully avoided the topics of Austrian Jews and extermination camps.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=43}} The \"victim theory\" of this period, that ended not later than 1949, was based on four statements:{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=41}}\n* the Anschluss of 1938 has not been a union of the German nation, but a violent seizure of Austria by a foreign aggressor;\n* 1938\u20131945 should be considered a period of foreign occupation;\n* despite having been supressed by the occupiers, the Austrian resistance made a prominent contribution to the victory of the anti-Hitler coalition;\n* Austrian soldiers of the Wehrmacht were forced to serve under a threat of cruel terror.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=41}}\n\nAn informal ideology constructed from an anti-fascist openly left position was adopted by the Union of Concentration Camps Prisoners ({{lang-de|KZ-Verband}}).{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=31}} This organisation pursued an aim to take control of the government and insisted that only active anti-fascists should be considered true victims of the regime thus closing their doors to \"passive victims\" \u2013 above all Jews who returned from the camps.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=31}} [[Simon Wiesenthal]] accused KZ-Verband of continuing the \"only for Aryans\" practice that was accepted in Austrian parties before Anschluss \u2013 of copying Nazi [[Identification in Nazi camps|division of inmates into \"upper\" and \"lower\" categories]].{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=31}} The position of KZ-Verband determined the contents of the first Austrian laws about aid to Nazi victims.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=31}} The Austrian government agreed not to offer them compensation, but solely an allowance and not for everyone - just to active participants of the resistance movement.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=32}} On the initiative of both social democrats and conservatives, this law was extended to victims of the Dollfuss-Schuschnigg regime (except National Socialists). The \"passive victims\", especially emigrants, were not eligible for the allowance.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=32}} The legislators followed simple interests and helped only those from whom they could expect political assistance.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=104}} Several thousands of surviving Jews were of no interest, as opposed to hundreds of thousands of front-line soldiers and Nazis.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=104: \u00abthe Jewish victims could not be politically instrumentalized\u00bb}}\n\n=== Change of direction ===\n\nAlready in 1946 it became clear that leftist anti-fascist propaganda was not being accepted in Austrian society, so by 1947 its time was over.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=104}}{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=44}} Prisoners, who returned from allied detention, were surprised to find that Austrians \"forgot\" about the years of Hitler's regime. A patriotic upsurge appeared in the country and replaced bitter memories.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=229}} In 1947 the Allies began the mass liberation of captivated Austrians and Austrian government restored half a million of \"less tainted\" ({{lang-de|Minderbelastete}}) members of the former NSDAP (Nazi party) to their civil rights.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=44}} From that moment a political struggle for the votes of former Nazis and veterans became a governing trait of Austrian political life. [[Austrian People's Party|Conservatives]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|social democrats]] rejected anti-fascist rhetoric, while communists, who supported it, quickly lost their political weight. In the beginning of 1947 they lost their places in government, the police closed the 'KZ-Verband' at the end of that year.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|pp=24, 31}} [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat|\"February 1948\" events in Czechoslovakia]] and threat of \"export of revolution\" deprived communists of all their former influence.{{sfn|Bischof|2004|p=20}} A three-party coalition changed to a classical two-party system; the \"[[Federation of Independents]]\" now took the role of a small third political force.  The grouping - created under social democrats sponsorship, \u2013 was a union of former Nazis, a virtual successor of Austrian branch of NSDAP (Nazi party), who were banned to join the \"large\" parties at that time.{{sfn|Riekmann|1999|p=84}} The marginalization of the communists, who really had been the backbone of the insignificant Austrian resistance, meant a political defeat of anti-fascists as a whole.{{sfn|Niederacher|2003|p=22}}{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=19}} The communists failed to enter the governing elite, their past endeavours appeared to be not needed in the contemporary internal Austrian politics; they were however occasionally remembered in communication with western diplomats.{{sfn|Niederacher|2003|p=22}}\n\nParty ideologists realized that the anti-fascist policy did not resonate in Austrian society so they found the way out through the propagation of a conservative view of an Austrian \"national identity\".{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=43}} The \"Book of Austria\" published by the government in 1948 stated that Austria has been a country of simple, peaceful people of high culture, kind Catholics famous not for their wars or politics but for their ancient traditions.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=43}} In place of an internal enemy (Nazism), the new ideology took on the familiar foreign enemy \u2013 Bolshevism.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=44}} The image of \"innocent victimhood\", mostly addressed to the victory states and anticipating the expected near-term withdrawal of the occupying troops, was a good fit for internal policy too. The \"victim theory\" assumed two forms: one for internal and one for foreign use.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|pp=43, 45}} Austrians were still exploiting the slogan of the Moscow Declaration about being \"Hitler's first victim\" in their foreign politics. But inside Austria it was transformed into the newest unifying myth that all the Austrians, without any exception, were all victims.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|pp=44, 45}}{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=27}} As a political expedient all sections of society were sequentially included to the list of the victims. Former Nazis were included to the myth as \"victims\" who have been deluded and deceived by the foreign tempter. Soon after the Federal Elections of 1949 ({{lang-de|Nationalratswahl in \u00d6sterreich 1949}}), they were officially recognized as \"victims\" of denazification together with those who they themselves victimized.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=106}} In 1949 Rosa Jochmann, ideologist of social democrats, anti-fascist of the immediate past and former prisoner of [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp|Ravensbr\u00fcck]], presented the new doctrine in this way:\n<blockquote>We all were the victims of fascism. A soldier who has come through the war in its worst form at the front was the victim. The population of the home front, who has been afraid of waiting for air-raid alarm and who has been dreaming of getting rid of bombing horror, was the victim.

During the shooting of a musical film [[The Sound of Music]], the plot of which unfolds just the times of the Anschluss and immediately after, the Authorities of [[Salzburg]] forbade the producers to decorate the streets of the city with Nazi symbols insisting that \"there had never been Nazis in Salzburg\".{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=102}}{{sfn|Art|2005|p=104}} They retreated only after the producers threatened to use the true newsreels of the Nazi processions in Salzburg.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=102}}{{sfn|Art|2005|p=104}} The film had a worldwide success, but failed in Austria.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=102}}\n\nThe death of a 67-year old anti-fascist [[Ernst Kirchweger]], beaten to death on March 31, 1965 during a demonstration against Nazi professor [[Taras Borodajkewycz]] catalysed change.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}}{{sfn|Art|2005|p=111}} The subsequent demonstrations of protest were unexpectedly supported by all the federal-level politicians{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}} The elite no longer had any need for the politics of the ultra-right.

The [[Protests of 1968]] in Vienna, jokingly called \"a tame revolution\" ({{lang-de|Eine Zahme Revolution}}), had little consequences.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=113}} The post-war generation of Austrians, as compared to Germans of the same age, appeared to be passive and did not try to review the past in the same active manner; this generation did not influence politicians, but rather followed them.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=121}} The ruling social democrats, with the knowledge of Kreisky, continued both secret and obvious cooperation with former Nazis.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=113}} Episodic protests against Nazi officials gave no results. In 1970 a minister of Kreisky's government,  a former Untersturmf\u00fchrer of the SS Johann \u00d6llinger, was exposed by the West German press and had to resign.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=114}} Instead Kreisky (a Jew himself, who escaped to Sweden in 1938{{sfn|Art|2005|p=113}}{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=25}}) appointed another former Nazi in his stead [[Oskar Weihs]].{{sfn|Art|2005|p=114}} In 1975 the case of a political ally of Kreisky, [[Freedom Party of Austria|FP\u00d6]] president [[Friedrich Peter]], who had been an officer in the [[1 SS Infantry Brigade]] during WWII, was a turning point.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=59}} Austrian politicians solidly supported Peter and condemned [[Simon Wiesenthal]] who had exposed him.

Procrastination of legislative decisions on the matter and bureaucracy during their administration became an unwritten practical rule. The first to formulate it was the Minister of Internal Affairs [[Oscar Helmer]] (one of few politicians who have admitted the responsibility of Austrians) in 1945: \"Ich bin daf\u00fcr, die Sache in die L\u00e4nge zu ziehen\" (\"I think that this question should be dragged out\").<ref>Helmer announced this on a closed session of the provisional government.

The other ones, like the lost rights of rented apartments,{{refn|1=During 1938\u20131939 no less than 59 thousand apartments occupied by Jews were \"aryanised\" in Vienna alone. The restitution of the lost rights to rent as such was rejected by all the generations of Austrian politicians under the pretext that it should have required eviction of tens of thousands of new tenants therefore leading to mass disorders.

According to the opinion of American politologist David Art, the Austrian \"white lies\" about being a \"victim\" served four important purposes:\n\n* For the first time in modern history the two rival political forces \u2013 conservatives and social democrats \u2013 united around this issue. The common rhetoric of being a \"victim\" allowed the country to forget the [[Austrian Civil War|Civil War]] of the 1930s; mutual silence about the sins of the past helped to establish trust relationships between the two parties. The \"big coalition\" of conservatives, social democrats, church and trade unions, formed in the 1940s ruled the country for almost half a century;{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}}\n* The recognition of all Austrians as \"victims\" allowed the integratione of the former Nazis (1/6 of all adults in the country{{sfn|Bekes|2015|p=308}}) into social and political life;{{sfn|Art|2005|p=109}}\n* Distancing from the German \"occupiers\" was essential to build Austrian national identity.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}} Austrians of 1920s-1930s considered themselves Germans and being a part of the Reich for 8 years just confirmed their beliefs.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}} Politicians of 1940s understood that the so called \"Austrian nation\" never existed, but they needed an ideology to form a core of national identity \u2013 the \"victim theory\" was the one to solve the problem;{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}}\n* The \"victim theory\" allowed the postponmento and delay of restitution for half a century.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=108}} Industrial assets that had been taken from Jews during Hitler times and nationalized by the Second Republic, became the part of an economical foundation of postwar Austria.{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=88}}\n\n== Dismantling of the myth ==\n\n=== Waldheim affair ===\n\nIn 1985 the \u00d6VP political party nominated the former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UNSG]] [[Kurt Waldheim]] for the federal president election.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=115}} During WWII Waldheim [[Kurt Waldheim#Military service in World War II|served as an intelligence officer]] in the Wehrmacht within the occupied territories of the USSR, Greece and Yugoslavia.

Waldheim won the elections in the second round of voting, but he was not able to perform his main responsibility as the president of Austria \u2013 diplomatic representation.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=117}} The USA and later European countries boycotted Waldheim.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=117}} Austria got a reputation of a promoter of Nazism and a foe to Israel.

According to the interpretation of this slogan by the founders of the Second Austrian Republic, the ''[[Anschluss]]'' which occurred in 1938 was an act of military aggression by the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. Austrian statehood had been interrupted and therefore the newly revived Austria of 1945 could not and should not be considered responsible for the [[Nuremberg trials|Nazis' crimes]] in any way. The \"[[victim theory]]\" which was formed by 1949 ({{lang-de|Opferthese, Opferdoktrin}}) insisted that all of the Austrians, including those who strongly supported [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], had been unwilling victims of the Nazi regime and were therefore not responsible for its crimes.\n\nThe \"victim theory\" became a fundamental myth in Austrian society. It made it possible for previously bitter political opponents \u2013 i.e. the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|social democrats]] and the [[Austrian People's Party|conservative Catholics]] \u2013 to unite and bring former Nazis back into social and political life for the first time in [[History of Austria|Austrian history]]. For almost half a century, the Austrian state denied the existence of any continuity between it and the political regime which existed in Austria from 1938\u20131945, actively kept up the self-sacrificing myth of Austrian nationhood, and cultivated a conservative spirit of national unity. Postwar [[denazification]] was quickly wound up; veterans of the [[Wehrmacht]] and the [[Waffen-SS]] took an honorable place in society. The struggle for justice by the actual victims of [[Nazism]] \u2013 primarily the [[Jews]] \u2013 was deprecated as an attempt to obtain illicit enrichment at the expense of the entire nation.\n\nIn 1986, the election of a former Wehrmacht intelligence officer, [[Kurt Waldheim]], as a [[List of Federal Presidents of Austria|federal president]] put Austria on the verge of international isolation. Powerful outside pressure and an internal political discussion forced Austrians to reconsider their attitude to the past. Starting with the political administration of the 1990s and followed by most of the Austrian people by the mid-2000s, the nation admitted its collective responsibility for the crimes committed during the Nazi occupation and officially abandoned the \"victim theory\".\n\n== Historical background ==\n{{Main|Anschluss|German nationalism in Austria|German Confederation|German Question|Holy Roman Empire}}\n[[File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|280px|A map of the German Confederation.]]\nThe idea of grouping all [[Germans]] into a nation-state country had been the subject of debate in the 19th century from the ending of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until the ending of the [[German Confederation]]. The [[Habsburgs]] and the [[Austrian Empire]] favored the ''Gro\u00dfdeutsche L\u00f6sung'' (\"Greater German solution\") idea of uniting all German-speaking peoples into one-state. On the other hand, the ''Kleindeutsche L\u00f6sung'' (\"Lesser German solution\") sought only to unify the northern German states and not include Austria; this proposal was largely advocated by the inhabitants of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Geiss|first=Imanuel|title=The Question of German Unification: 1806-1996|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415150491|page=38}}</ref> The Prussians defeated the Austrians in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866 which ultimately excluded Austria and the Austrian Germans from Germany. [[Otto von Bismarck]] established the [[North German Confederation]] which sought to prevent the Austrian and Bavarian Catholics from forming any sort of force against the predominantly Protestant Prussian Germany. He used the [[Franco-Prussian War]] to convince other German states, including the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] to fight against the [[Second French Empire]]. After Prussia's victory in the war, he swiftly [[Unification of Germany|unified Germany]] into a nation-state in 1871 and proclaimed the [[German Empire]], without Austria.<ref>{{cite book|author=James J.

During its existence, the German-speaking Austrians hoped for the empire to dissolve and advocated an ''Anschluss'' with Germany. Following the dissolution of the empire in 1918, the rump state of [[Republic of German-Austria|German-Austria]], was created.

During 1942\u20131943 the attitude of the Allies to the Austrian question changed: the leaders of the USSR had not suggested any new scheme, while the British took into serious consideration the future Austria.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=26}} On September 26, 1942 Eden declared Churchill's plan of creation of a \"Danube confederation\" composed of former Austria, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia \u2013 a vast buffer state that would have separated Western Europe from the USSR.{{sfn|\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1973|p=138}}{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=19}} In the Spring of 1943, a 34 year old civil servant in the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign office]] [[Geoffrey Harrison]] deveoped a plan for the post-war organisation of Austria, which subsequently became the official British policy in regard to the Austrian question.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=27, 33}} Harrison's viewpoint was that recreation of an independent but weak Austria within the borders of the First Republic was only possible with the readiness of the Western allies to support the new state for many years long.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=31}} Harrison did not believe in the ability of the Austrians to self-organize nor in the probability them rising in armed resistance against the regime.{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|pp=138\u2013139}} The best solution according to British point of view would have been a strong confederation of Danube states with Austria included de jure as an equal member, but de facto as a cultural and political leader.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|pp=31\u201332}} It was not possible to create such a union in the immediate post war Europe; an independent Austria would have to be created first, and it should have been provided with political guarantees and financial support.

Keyserling, the British were mainly guided by erroneous utopian plans to foment a mass resistance against Nazi regime in Austrian lands, to disrupt German Reich from the inside and to create a convenient springboard for attack from the South.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=36}}{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|p=157}} Both the points of view support that in 1943 British as well as American politics mistakenly thought that Germany has been ready to collapse under pressure from the Soviet troops or from people's indignation from the inside of Reich.{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|pp=132\u2013133}}{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=27}}\n\n=== Text endorsements ===\n\nAt the end of May 1943 Harrison's plan was approved by the British cabinet,{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=33}} but by June [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] had let the Foreign Office know that any association or confederation of Danube states were not acceptable to the USSR.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=36}} Molotov's deputy, [[Solomon Lozovsky]], decried such a union calling it \"the instrument of anti-Soviet politics\".{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=36}} The British did not abandon the plan, so on August 14, 1943 Eden sent the Harison's project of the \"Declaration on Austria\" to Moscow and Washington. The text started by stating that \"Austria was the first free country to fall victim to Nazi aggression\u2026.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=33}} Again, facing resistance of Soviet diplomats the British started to back down. According to Soviet insistence the project lost any mention of association with neighbouring states and [[Atlantic Charter]], the \"Austrian nation\" was replaced with an unambiguous \"Austria\", \"Nazi aggression\" \u2013 with \"Hitlerite aggression\".{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=36}} The British negotiations with the Americans were not any less difficult.{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|p=145}}\n\nThe [[Moscow Declarations#Declaration on Austria|Moscow Declaration on Austria]] became the result of this haggling between the Allied ministers.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=36}} It was adopted on September 30th and published on November 1st, 1943. Despite all the edits made, the phrase \"the first victim\" remained practically untouched: \"Austria, the first free country to fall a victim to Hitlerite aggression, shall be liberated from German domination\u2026\". The text was finished with a strict reminder, which was insisted by Stalin, that Austria \"has a responsibility, which she cannot evade, for participation in the war on the side of Hitlerite Germany\" ([[:s:en:Moscow Declarations#Declaration on Austria|full text]]). According to Stalin's addendum the responsibility was not lying on the shoulders of certain people, groups or parties, but the society in whole; there was no way for an Austrian to escape from collective responsibility.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=19}} Stalin, like Churchill, had also considered Austria to be a buffer between Soviet and Anglo-American spheres of influence, and [[Communist International#Dissolution|has not been in a hurry to carry out]] the \"[[export of revolution]]\".{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=19}} His short-term goal was to exploit the surviving Austrian industrial, human and natural resources; probably that's why Stalin insisted on the stricter wording concering responsibility.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=19}} The authors are unlikely to have suspected \"the first victim\" would become an Austrian national theme, which would be carefully cultivated and protected, and determine Austrian foreign policy for many years.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=18}} Moreover, they didn't know that another part of the Declaration \u2013 the Austrian responsibility \u2013 would die on the vine.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=18}}\n\n=== Response of belligerent Austrians ===\n\nDifferent historical schools admit that defeats in 1943 gave rise to doubt amongst the Austrians about the future of the Reich and helped the spread of separatist sentiments.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=186}} But they disagree on the role of this sentiment in history. According to the official post-war Austrian point of view the defeat in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] started a fully fledged \"national awakening\".{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=186}} Soviet historians insisted that in 1943 a new stage of [[Resistance during World War II|resistance]] began in Austria, and the Moscow Declaration proved to be an \"important factor that influenced the Austrian nation\".{{sfn|\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1973|p=135}} Contemporary Western historians believe that there is no reason for drawing firm conclusions about \"awakening\" or \"resistance\".{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=186}} It goes without saying that antihitlerite and separatist sentiments had been spreading both in Vienna and remote places of Austria, but nearly in the same degree as in other lands of the Reich.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|pp=186, 188, 193}} War defeats, Italian withdrawal from war, Anglo-American bombings,    streams of refugees and prisoners facilitated this, but Western historians deny the influence of the Moscow Declaration. Evan Bukey admits that the Declaration inspired the Austrian underground, but neither increased their forces nor helped to spread separatist sentiments.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=208}} R. Keyserlingk wrote that the Declaration brought the Allies more harm than good.{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|pp=159\u2013160}} The operation of British propagandists among Austrian soldiers at the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian front]] failed :{{sfn|Steininger|2008|p=36}} the Moscow Declaration has not influenced the fighting spirit of German troops and, probably, merely was a great help for Goebbels' [[counterpropaganda]].{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|pp=159\u2013160}}\n\nAustria was far behind the lines of belligerent Germany and the reaction of Austrian civilians on the Moscow Declaration was twofold.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=208}} On one hand, people made a false conclusion that the status of \"the first victim\" will help Austria to avoid allied bombings.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=208}} On the other hand, \"Moscow\" in the title was unmistakably associated not with the western allies, but with uncompromising [[Bolshevism]].{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=208}} People, in whole, were indifferent to the news and did not support any anti-Hitler opposition groups.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=208}}{{sfn|Art|2005|p=104}} During 1943\u20131944 the number of arrests increased, but 80% of arrested were foreign workers, whose number was 140 thousand in Vienna alone.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=205}} During 1944, as the military and economical landscape got worse, dissatisfaction increased among Austrians too, but not with the Hitler regime, but with the stream of refugees, especially Protestants, \"from the North\".{{sfn|Bukey|2002|pp=197, 198, 206}} Internal conflicts did not undermine the fighting spirit of the nation.

Propaganda of the feats of the Austrian resistance proved to the Allies the contribution made to the defeat of Nazism, which was required from Austrians by the Moscow Declaration. The other task of anti-fascist propaganda was to find a new ideology that could be relied on by a morally and financially exhausted nation.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=104}} Anti-fascist rhetoric, forced from above, ran through the whole social life of Austria. Broken chains appeared on the [[coat of arms of Austria]] as a symbol of liberation of Austria from \"foreign occupation\" by Germany,{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=41}} memorial tablets and modest temporary monuments in honour of perished anti-fascists were installed in towns{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=209}} (the only big monument of this period, [[Soviet War Memorial (Vienna)|Heroes' Monument of the Red Army in Vienna]], was erected due to insistence of the USSR).{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=210}} Propaganda at all levels praised feats of a few anti-fascist heroes, but carefully avoided the topics of Austrian Jews and extermination camps.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=43}} The \"victim theory\" of this period, that ended not later than 1949, was based on four statements:{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=41}}\n* the Anschluss of 1938 has not been a union of the German nation, but a violent seizure of Austria by a foreign aggressor;\n* 1938\u20131945 should be considered a period of foreign occupation;\n* despite having been supressed by the occupiers, the Austrian resistance made a prominent contribution to the victory of the anti-Hitler coalition;\n* Austrian soldiers of the Wehrmacht were forced to serve under a threat of cruel terror.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=41}}\n\nAn informal ideology constructed from an anti-fascist openly left position was adopted by the Union of Concentration Camps Prisoners ({{lang-de|KZ-Verband}}).{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=31}} This organisation pursued an aim to take control of the government and insisted that only active anti-fascists should be considered true victims of the regime thus closing their doors to \"passive victims\" \u2013 above all Jews who returned from the camps.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=31}} [[Simon Wiesenthal]] accused KZ-Verband of continuing the \"only for Aryans\" practice that was accepted in Austrian parties before Anschluss \u2013 of copying Nazi [[Identification in Nazi camps|division of inmates into \"upper\" and \"lower\" categories]].{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=31}} The position of KZ-Verband determined the contents of the first Austrian laws about aid to Nazi victims.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=31}} The Austrian government agreed not to offer them compensation, but solely an allowance and not for everyone - just to active participants of the resistance movement.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=32}} On the initiative of both social democrats and conservatives, this law was extended to victims of the Dollfuss-Schuschnigg regime (except National Socialists).

[[Austrian People's Party|Conservatives]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|social democrats]] rejected anti-fascist rhetoric, while communists, who supported it, quickly lost their political weight. In the beginning of 1947 they lost their places in government, the police closed the 'KZ-Verband' at the end of that year.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|pp=24, 31}} [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat|\"February 1948\" events in Czechoslovakia]] and threat of \"export of revolution\" deprived communists of all their former influence.{{sfn|Bischof|2004|p=20}} A three-party coalition changed to a classical two-party system; the \"[[Federation of Independents]]\" now took the role of a small third political force.  The grouping - created under social democrats sponsorship, \u2013 was a union of former Nazis, a virtual successor of Austrian branch of NSDAP (Nazi party), who were banned to join the \"large\" parties at that time.{{sfn|Riekmann|1999|p=84}} The marginalization of the communists, who really had been the backbone of the insignificant Austrian resistance, meant a political defeat of anti-fascists as a whole.{{sfn|Niederacher|2003|p=22}}{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=19}} The communists failed to enter the governing elite, their past endeavours appeared to be not needed in the contemporary internal Austrian politics; they were however occasionally remembered in communication with western diplomats.{{sfn|Niederacher|2003|p=22}}\n\nParty ideologists realized that the anti-fascist policy did not resonate in Austrian society so they found the way out through the propagation of a conservative view of an Austrian \"national identity\".{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=43}} The \"Book of Austria\" published by the government in 1948 stated that Austria has been a country of simple, peaceful people of high culture, kind Catholics famous not for their wars or politics but for their ancient traditions.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=43}} In place of an internal enemy (Nazism), the new ideology took on the familiar foreign enemy \u2013 Bolshevism.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=44}} The image of \"innocent victimhood\", mostly addressed to the victory states and anticipating the expected near-term withdrawal of the occupying troops, was a good fit for internal policy too. The \"victim theory\" assumed two forms: one for internal and one for foreign use.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|pp=43, 45}} Austrians were still exploiting the slogan of the Moscow Declaration about being \"Hitler's first victim\" in their foreign politics. But inside Austria it was transformed into the newest unifying myth that all the Austrians, without any exception, were all victims.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|pp=44, 45}}{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=27}} As a political expedient all sections of society were sequentially included to the list of the victims. Former Nazis were included to the myth as \"victims\" who have been deluded and deceived by the foreign tempter. Soon after the Federal Elections of 1949 ({{lang-de|Nationalratswahl in \u00d6sterreich 1949}}), they were officially recognized as \"victims\" of denazification together with those who they themselves victimized.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=106}} In 1949 Rosa Jochmann, ideologist of social democrats, anti-fascist of the immediate past and former prisoner of [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp|Ravensbr\u00fcck]], presented the new doctrine in this way:\n<blockquote>We all were the victims of fascism. A soldier who has come through the war in its worst form at the front was the victim. The population of the home front, who has been afraid of waiting for air-raid alarm and who has been dreaming of getting rid of bombing horror, was the victim.

On the one hand, veterans in Nazi uniform provoked the occupational powers.{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=530}}; on the other hand, Austrian veterans made common cause with their German counterparts. The border of Austria and the [[Germany|FRG]] was practically open threatening a new, spontaneous Anschluss that was disturbing for the Allies too.{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=531}} The government tried to prevent the statements of pro-German activists in the federal media,{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=530}} but did not dare to prosecute their political wing \u2013 the [[Federation of Independents]].{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=533}} In the presidential elections of 1951 the former Nazi and the candidate of the [[Federation of Independents]] Burghard Breitner got more than 15% of votes.<ref name=BB51/>\n\nIn 1955 Austrians convinced the Allies to exclude any provisions of Austrian responsibility for Hitlerite crimes from the [[Austrian State Treaty]] established that year. Earlier Israel has renounced its claims to Austria.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|pp=15\u201316}} After sovereignty had been recovered and the occupying troops had pulled out, the Austrian conservative rhetoric reached its climax.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=94}} At last Austrians could openly express their attitude to the results of WWII: according to the \"victim theory\" of that period (1955-1962) the invasion of the victory states in 1945 was not a liberation, but a hostile occupation that superseded the Hitlerite one.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=94}} From this point of view Austria had been a \"victim\" not only of Hitler, but also of the victorious occupiers.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=46}} The first of federal politicians to express this opinion in public was Figl during the celebrations of the signing the Austrian State Treaty.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=94}}\n\nAustrian politicians thought that ultra-right forces would have quickly lost their influence in an independent state, but despite their estimations the veteran movement increased rapidly and took up the role of defender of a society free from the \"red threat\"{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=534}} and promoter of the state ideology.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=27}} The distinction between the [[Austrian Armed Forces]] and the veteran societies, as it seemed to foreign observers, was smoothed away: employed officers openly wore Hitlerite uniform,{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=536}} the veterans claimed to have a right to carry arms and to create an armed volunteer corps.{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=537}} The Social Democrats, who promoted the establishment of the [[Federation of Independents]] in 1949, were the first to realize the threat, but conservatives from the [[Austrian People's Party|\u00d6VP]] prevented the attempts to restrain the veterans.{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=540}} Only in 1960 conservatives became concerned with an unpredictable behaviour of people dressed in the Wehrmacht uniform, so Austria banned the wearing of the [[Swastika]].{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=540}}\n\n=== Conciliation ===\n\nThe fifteen years of [[Leopold Figl]] and [[Julius Raab]]'s conservative governments maintained a full and uncompromising denial of guilt of Austria and the Austrians in Hitlerite crimes.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=94}} In 1961 the power passed to the socialist government under [[Bruno Kreisky]]. Over the next several years (not later than 1962{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=95}}-1965{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}}), as the first post-war generation entered society, the state ideology softened. A process to return the Resistance heroes to the public conscience began. It was followed by a rival campaign of ultra-rightists with the opposite intent.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=57}} A political dialogue within the firmly consolidated and inflexible ruling elite was still not possible: protesting sentiments started to manifest themsleves in both cultural and scientific spheres.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=120}} In 1963 historians and anti-fascists founded the national archive of the Resistance, in 1964 the federal government approved the construction of the first memorial for the victims of concentration camps in [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]].{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}} Austrian society interpreted these cautious steps as a challenge for the dominating ultra-right views{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=58}} and resisted such \"attempts to blacken the past\". During the shooting of a musical film [[The Sound of Music]], the plot of which unfolds just the times of the Anschluss and immediately after, the Authorities of [[Salzburg]] forbade the producers to decorate the streets of the city with Nazi symbols insisting that \"there had never been Nazis in Salzburg\".{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=102}}{{sfn|Art|2005|p=104}} They retreated only after the producers threatened to use the true newsreels of the Nazi processions in Salzburg.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=102}}{{sfn|Art|2005|p=104}} The film had a worldwide success, but failed in Austria.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=102}}\n\nThe death of a 67-year old anti-fascist [[Ernst Kirchweger]], beaten to death on March 31, 1965 during a demonstration against Nazi professor [[Taras Borodajkewycz]] catalysed change.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}}{{sfn|Art|2005|p=111}} The subsequent demonstrations of protest were unexpectedly supported by all the federal-level politicians{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}} The elite no longer had any need for the politics of the ultra-right. Moreover, being afraid of a spontaneous movement to an authoritarian dictatorship, the elite preferred to distance themselves from the ultra-right.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}} In the same year the first memorial for anti-fascists constructed by the federal powers was opened in [[Hofburg]].{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}} By the beginning of the 1970s the \"victim theory\" had mutated again. Anti-fascists were now returned to the official pantheon, but honouring of the Wehrmacht soldiers was still predominant.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=57}} Open anti-Semitism surrendered its positions slowly: according to the 1969 poll the genocide of Jews has been firmly approved by 55% of [[Freedom Party of Austria|FP\u00d6]] electorate, 30% of [[Austrian People's Party|\u00d6VP]] electorate and 18% of [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|SP\u00d6]] electorate (the question was \"Do you agree that during 1938-1945 the Jews got their come-uppance?\"; the results of the \"firmly agree\" answer are given here{{sfn|Pelinka|1989|p=255}}); by 1985 these proportions decreased by 45%, 25% and 16% respectively.{{sfn|Pelinka|1989|p=255}} All the political parties viewed the \"everyday life\" during the Nazi era with considerable tolerance, and they subsequently shaped it, intentionally or not, into legitimacy and even prestige.{{sfn|Pelinka|1989|p=255}}\n\nThe consensus reached in the 1960s was maintained into the following decade. The [[Protests of 1968]] in Vienna, jokingly called \"a tame revolution\" ({{lang-de|Eine Zahme Revolution}}), had little consequences.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=113}} The post-war generation of Austrians, as compared to Germans of the same age, appeared to be passive and did not try to review the past in the same active manner; this generation did not influence politicians, but rather followed them.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=121}} The ruling social democrats, with the knowledge of Kreisky, continued both secret and obvious cooperation with former Nazis.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=113}} Episodic protests against Nazi officials gave no results. In 1970 a minister of Kreisky's government,  a former Untersturmf\u00fchrer of the SS Johann \u00d6llinger, was exposed by the West German press and had to resign.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=114}} Instead Kreisky (a Jew himself, who escaped to Sweden in 1938{{sfn|Art|2005|p=113}}{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=25}}) appointed another former Nazi in his stead [[Oskar Weihs]].{{sfn|Art|2005|p=114}} In 1975 the case of a political ally of Kreisky, [[Freedom Party of Austria|FP\u00d6]] president [[Friedrich Peter]], who had been an officer in the [[1 SS Infantry Brigade]] during WWII, was a turning point.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=59}} Austrian politicians solidly supported Peter and condemned [[Simon Wiesenthal]] who had exposed him.

Many more Nazis were detained by the Soviet powers and then handed to Austrian authorities.{{sfn|Bekes|2015|pp=22-23}} In the beginning, the Soviet powers were prepared to \"whitewash\" the \"less tainted\" Nazis with the hope that they would help to reinforce the Austrian communist party resources.{{sfn|Deak|2006|p=139}} But after the latter was defeated at the November elections in 1945, the Soviet powers abandoned the idea to \"export the revolution\" to Austria and ceased to rely on the Austrian communist party.{{sfn|Deak|2006|p=139}} The British sector of occupation, [[Carinthia]], was the one with the largest part of Nazis within the population.

Politicians justified this rejection of restitution both with ideological clich\u00e9s and the real weakness of the new state that was established from the ruins of the defeated Reich.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=106}} According to Figl all that had  happened in Austria was similar to a natural disaster. Austria was not capable of either recouping the losses, or even easing the miseries of people who had suffered during those years.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=106}}\n\nUntil the end of 1990s public policy of the Second Republic in terms of restitution was defined by the \"victim theory\". Procrastination of legislative decisions on the matter and bureaucracy during their administration became an unwritten practical rule. The first to formulate it was the Minister of Internal Affairs [[Oscar Helmer]] (one of few politicians who have admitted the responsibility of Austrians) in 1945: \"Ich bin daf\u00fcr, die Sache in die L\u00e4nge zu ziehen\" (\"I think that this question should be dragged out\").<ref>Helmer announced this on a closed session of the provisional government. For the first time these words were published by Robert Nite in 1988.

Jews and Gypsies got formal recognition in 1949,{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=34}} [[Doctors' trial|medical crimes]] victims \u2013 only in 1995, homosexuals and asexuals \u2013 in 2005.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=35}}\n\nAs a result, Austrian law that regulated restitution to victims turned out to be a complicated and controversial \"patchwork quilt\" made of  a multitude of acts on separate cases.{{sfn|Bailer|2011|p=308}} The law of 1947 about social assistance to the victims of repressions had been corrected 30 times during 50 years.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=107}} For some incidental points like the restitution of confiscated property Austrians formed a fair and fully-fledged legal basis as early as 1947. The other ones, like the lost rights of rented apartments,{{refn|1=During 1938\u20131939 no less than 59 thousand apartments occupied by Jews were \"aryanised\" in Vienna alone. The restitution of the lost rights to rent as such was rejected by all the generations of Austrian politicians under the pretext that it should have required eviction of tens of thousands of new tenants therefore leading to mass disorders. Only in 2000 Austria agreed to refund the lost rights to rent with 7000 USD for every lost apartment{{sfn|Bailer|2011|pp=313-315}}}} were left without any decision.{{sfn|Bailer|2011|p=309}} All these laws referred not to [[public law]], but to [[Civil law (area)|private civil law]].{{sfn|Bailer|2011|p=308}} Plaintiffs were obliged to prove their rights in Austrian civil courts that had an adverse policy (except a short period in the end of the 1940s).{{sfn|Bailer|2011|p=308}}{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=99}} Even when the federal government had a fair mind to settle another dispute,{{refn|1=E.g. the campaign of the Austrian Ministry of Culture to return several thousand pieces of art (1966\u20131972){{sfn|Bailer|2011|p=319}}}} the state apparatus had no time to try all the claims.{{sfn|Bailer|2011|p=311}} Probably neither politicians nor ordinary officials realised the real scale of Hitler's repressions.{{sfn|Bailer|2011|p=311}}\n\n=== Rewriting of history ===\n\nFor the Second Republic to survive it was necessary for the Austrians to establish their own national identity, and this needed to be created.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}}{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|pp=94\u201395}} As far back as the 1940s, a new, particular history of Austria had been urgently composed to satisfy this purpose: it introduced into existence a unique Austrian nation that differed from the German one.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}} The heroes' pantheon of this history was made up of people that had no connection with Germany within the 20th century, i.e. [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria|Leopold the Glorious]] or [[Andreas Hofer]].{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=95}} In 1946 a celebration of the 950-year anniversary of the ancient [[name of Austria]] ({{lang-de|Ostarrichi}}) was right on the button.

The consensual opinion of Austrian academics was that a common language could not be the determining factor.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=108}}\n\nDuring the first post-war decades historical perspectives within Austria, like the society as a whole, was separated into two-party columns \u2013 conservative and social-democratic,{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|pp=97-98}} who however together wrote the consensual (\"coalitionist\", {{lang-de|Koalitionsgeschichtsschreibung}}) history under administration of the party supervisors.{{sfn|Ritter|1992|p=113}} Probably there was no alternative during those years: simply no humanitarian or ideological schools existed outside of the party camps.{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|p=98}} Both the schools fabricated the [[contemporary history]] in their own way, supporting the all-nation \"victim\" myth.{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|pp=95, 98}} Conservative historians hid [[Leopold Kunschak]]'s anti-Semitism, social democrats were silent about Renner's sycophancy before Stalin and Hitler.{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|pp=95, 98}} The competing groups never tried to expose each other, they continued to mutually respect the party legends and taboos for three decades.{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|pp=99}} [[Anton Pelinka]] thought that denying and silencing the historical reality allowed for the first time in history, a consolidation of society and healing of the wounds of the past.{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|pp=99}}\n\nIn the 1970s historians, following the political order, focused on investigation of the interwar period; the Nazi regime being interpreted as absolution from sins of the First Republic and still within the boundaries of the \"victim theory\".{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=59}} Authors of the standard \"History of Austria\" (1977) Gorlich and Romanik stated that WWII belonged to world history, it was not an Austrian war because Austria as a state did not participate in it.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=48}} Along with this, Austrian patriots knew that the path to Austrian national revival laid through Hitler's defeat.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=48}} Austria's own history was considered separate to a common one with Germany;{{sfn|Ritter|1992|p=113}} by 1980 the belief that a special, \"non-German\" national identity of Austrians had long existed, became firmly established.{{sfn|Ritter|1992|p=113}} The Austrian lineage of [[Odilo Globocnik]], [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], [[Adolf Eichmann]] and other Nazi criminals was suppressed: the historians called them German occupiers.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=45}} The only existing (as of 2007) [[monograph]] about denazification in Austria (Dieter Stiefel, 1981) described it as an unfounded and incompetent intervention of the victors into home affairs.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=572}} Left-wing historians, in their turn, criticised the Allies for supposed suppression of a spontaneous anti-fascist movement, which had no appreciable influence in reality.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=572}}\n\n=== School syllabus ===\n\nOne of the methods to consolidate the ideology became the Austrian school syllabus,{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=109}} where the \"victim\" myth was closely interwoven with the myth about a special, non-German identity of Austrians.{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|pp=111}} The highest goal of the Austrian school system became a patriotic education in a spirit of national union that required forgetting the immediate past and forgiving the past sins of all compatriots.\n\nTextbooks presented the Anschluss as an act of German aggression against innocent \"victims\" and methodically shifted blame to other countries, who gave Austria up during the hard times.{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=139}} The first textbooks blamed the western countries for [[Appeasement#The conduct of appeasement, 1937\u201339|appeasement of Hitler]].{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=139}} In the 1960s the USSR temporarily became the main villain whom ''Austrians'' fought against in a ''just'' war.{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=141}} Until the 1970s the existence of Austrian support for the Anschluss as well as Austrian Nazism was denied: according to the textbooks Austrian society was a solid mass, of which every member equally was a \"victim\" of foreign forces.{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=139}}{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|pp=201, 202}} Authors of a 1955 school reading book ignored the concept of Anschluss ('union'): Austria was literally presented as a victim of German ''military'' aggression, just like Poland or France.{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=139}} Books of 1950s and 1960s mentioned the Holocaust rarely and in a reduced form of a minor episode.{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|p=202}} The topic of a traditional Austrian anti-Semitism and its role in the events of 1938-1945 were never discussed; from the authors' point of view the persecution of Jews had been an exclusive consequence of Hitler's personal animosity.{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|p=202}} In the 1960s a typical clich\u00e9 of Austrian school programmes was an indispensable comparison of the Holocaust and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]] or sometimes [[Katyn massacre]].

Authors for the first time discussed the problem of anti-Semitism in their contemporary society and were first to admit that Hitlerite anti-Semitism had national, Austrian roots.{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|p=202}} Other textbooks of 1980s continued to diligently reproduce the \"victim\" myth. They mentioned the existence of concentration camps, but their description was reduced to just a ''political'' prosecution of a ''political'' enemies of Hitler;{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|p=204}} the books considered the camps as a place where consolidation of the national elite has happened, a personnel department of the Second Republic in its own way.{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=141}} The Holocaust was mentioned but was never classified as [[genocide]];  there were no absolute figures of exterminated people: Austrian school invented the \"Holocaust without Jews\".{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|p=205}} Only in 1990s authors of textbook admitted the real scale of the crimes, but kept the comparison of the Holocaust with Hiroshima. The two catastrophes still co-existed and were continuously compared, and Austrians who committed evil acts were still presented as passive executors of foreign will.{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|p=209}}\n\n== Historical role ==\n\nAll the countries that suffered under Nazi power tried more or less to forget their own past after the war.{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=208}} Ones that had a resistance movement glorified it, forgetting about [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers|collaborationism]]. Others, like Austria, preferred to consider themselves victims of the foreign aggression,{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=208}}{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=88}} although Austria, itself, did have a [[Austrian Resistance|resistance movement]] (The Resistance in Austria, 1938\u20131945 Radom\u00edr Luza, University of Minnesota Press, 1984). According to the opinion of American politologist David Art, the Austrian \"white lies\" about being a \"victim\" served four important purposes:\n\n* For the first time in modern history the two rival political forces \u2013 conservatives and social democrats \u2013 united around this issue. The common rhetoric of being a \"victim\" allowed the country to forget the [[Austrian Civil War|Civil War]] of the 1930s; mutual silence about the sins of the past helped to establish trust relationships between the two parties. The \"big coalition\" of conservatives, social democrats, church and trade unions, formed in the 1940s ruled the country for almost half a century;{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}}\n* The recognition of all Austrians as \"victims\" allowed the integratione of the former Nazis (1/6 of all adults in the country{{sfn|Bekes|2015|p=308}}) into social and political life;{{sfn|Art|2005|p=109}}\n* Distancing from the German \"occupiers\" was essential to build Austrian national identity.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}} Austrians of 1920s-1930s considered themselves Germans and being a part of the Reich for 8 years just confirmed their beliefs.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}} Politicians of 1940s understood that the so called \"Austrian nation\" never existed, but they needed an ideology to form a core of national identity \u2013 the \"victim theory\" was the one to solve the problem;{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}}\n* The \"victim theory\" allowed the postponmento and delay of restitution for half a century.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=108}} Industrial assets that had been taken from Jews during Hitler times and nationalized by the Second Republic, became the part of an economical foundation of postwar Austria.{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=88}}\n\n== Dismantling of the myth ==\n\n=== Waldheim affair ===\n\nIn 1985 the \u00d6VP political party nominated the former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UNSG]] [[Kurt Waldheim]] for the federal president election.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=115}} During WWII Waldheim [[Kurt Waldheim#Military service in World War II|served as an intelligence officer]] in the Wehrmacht within the occupied territories of the USSR, Greece and Yugoslavia. West German and later Austrian and American journalists and the [[World Jewish Congress|WJC]] accused Waldheim of being a member of Nazi organizations and of passive co-operation in punitive actions in the Balkans.{{sfn|Art|2005|pp=118, 132}} Waldheim denied all the accusations and insisted that the campaign of defamation has been directed not towards him in person, but towards all his generation.{{sfn|Art|2005|pp=118, 121}} The president of WJC [[Edgar Bronfman, Sr.|Edgar Bronfman]] acknowledged this: \"The issue is not Kurt Waldheim. He is a mirror of Austria. His lies are of secondary importance. The real issue is that Austria has lied for decades about its own involvement in the atrocities Mr. Waldheim was involved in: deportations, reprisal murders, and others too painful to think about\".{{sfn|Art|2005|p=118}} The Waldheim affair captivated the country, an unprecedented discussion about the military past developed in the press.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=118}} At the beginning of it the conservatives, who absolutely dominated in Austrian media, {{sfn|Art|2005|p=121}} formulated a new \"victim theory\" that was the first in history to apply to the patriotism of Austrians.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=120}} From the right-wing's point of view both Austria and Waldheim personally became victims of the campaign of defamation by the world Jewry, therefore support for Waldheim should be a duty for all patriots.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=120}} The questions about Hitlerite past were interpreted as an attack against patriotic feelings of Austrians; the right-wingers insisted that during WWII Austrians behaved respectably, so digging the past up was unneeded and harmful.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=120}}\n\nThe electoral campaign of Waldheim was built on a call to Austrian national feelings. Waldheim won the elections in the second round of voting, but he was not able to perform his main responsibility as the president of Austria \u2013 diplomatic representation.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=117}} The USA and later European countries boycotted Waldheim.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=117}} Austria got a reputation of a promoter of Nazism and a foe to Israel. European organisations continuously criticised the country for its support of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]].{{sfn|Pick|2000|pp=197\u2013199}} In order to rehabilitate the president, the Austrian government founded an independent commission of historians. In February 1988 they confirmed accusations against Waldheim: while not being the direct executor or the organizer of war crimes, it was impossible for him not to know about them.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=117}} The direct result of the Waldheim affair in home policy was the defeat of the social democrats and the factual break-up of the postwar two-party system.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=119}} The[[The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative|Green Party]] appeared on the political scene and the radical right-wing [[Freedom Party of Austria|FP\u00d6]] under [[J\u00f6rg Haider]] grew in strength.

In 1992 they called out more than 300 thousand people to demonstrate against J\u00f6rg Haider.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=132}} Scandals around Waldheim and Haider in a universities ended with the victory of the liberal-left school and a full revision of the former ideological guidelines.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=574}} Authors of the generation of 1990s investigated the evolution of old prejudices and stereotypes (first of all anti-Semitism), disputed the role of the Resistance in the history of the country and analysed immoral, in their opinion, evasion by Austrian politicians by not admitting the responsibility of the nation.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=574}} Attention of the researchers switched from the acts  of individual Austrian politicians to previous campaigns against Gypsy and homosexuals.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=29}} Critics of this school (Gabriele Matzner-Holzer, Rudolf Burger and others) noticed that the left-wing authors tended to judge people of the past, using the moral norms existing at the end of the 20th century, and have not tried to clearly ascertain if it ever was really possible to repent in such a criminal society ({{lang-de|Tatergesellschaft}}) steeped in Nazism as the Austria of the 1940s.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=575}}\n\nIn the 1980s, the topic of Nazi crimes started appearing regularly on television.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=30}} Victims of Nazism who survived to the 1980s and who were previously afraid of speaking out, started to regularly appear on the screen both as witnesses of the past and as heroes of documentaries.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=30}} In 1988 the memorial against wars and fascism ({{lang-de|Mahnmal gegen Krieg und Faschismus}}) was opened under the walls of \"[[Albertina]]\"; in 1995 a public exhibition about the Wehrmacht ({{lang-de|Wehrmachtsaufstellung}}) became the event of the year and started a discussion of the previously untouchable topic of the almost half a million Austrians who fought on Hitler's side.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=30}} A change of social sentiment resulted from the Austrian media turnaround: admission of the criminal past replaced the previous denial.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=30}}{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=89}} At the beginning of the 1990s collective responsibility was admitted by only a small circle of intellectuals, politicians and left-wing youth; by the mid-2000s the majority of Austrians had gradually joined them.{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=89}}\n\n=== Acknowledgement of liability ===\n\nThe abandonment of the \"victim theory\" by the Austrian ''state'' and gradual admittance of the responsibility began in 1988.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=36}} Austria contributed to an existing fund of for Nazi victims, established a new fund and for the first time in history made payments for benefit of emigrants, and widened the scope of legally recognised victims (in particular Gypsy and [[Carinthian Slovenes]]).{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=36}} These actions of the state were prompted both by changes in Austrian society and by the unparalleled crisis in foreign politics.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=36}} During the whole Waldheim's term of office (1986\u20131992) the international situation of Austria deteriorated; governments of the US and Israel joined the pressure made by the [[Jewish diasporas]] as they did not wanted to admit such a 'Nazi country', which had also supported [[Yasser Arafat]] and [[Muammar Gaddafi]], to the world political stage.{{sfn|Pick|2000|pp=197\u2013199}}\n\nAs early as 1987 [[Hugo Portisch]], advisor of the [[Chancellor of Austria|federal chancellor]] [[Franz Vranitzky]], recommended the government to immediately and unconditionally admit the responsibility of Austria and to apologize to the world Jewry; Vranitzky concurred this opinion, but had no courage to act.{{sfn|Pick|2000|pp=197\u2013199}} Only in July 1991, one year before the end of Waldheim's term, when the political influence of Vranitzky and social democrats has noticeably increased,{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=112}} the chancellor made a public apology on behalf of the nation and admitted its responsibility (but not the guilt) for the crimes of the past.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=197}}{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=88}} But neither Americans nor Israelis were impressed by this cautious confession made inside the Austrian Parliament.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=200}} Things started to move only after Vranitzky officially visited Israel in 1993;{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=200}} during his visit he admitted the responsibility not solely of the nation, but also the ''state'' but with a condition that the concept of a collective guilt was not applicable to Austrians{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=88}}.

The game follows the player's character, a hero of King Maximus, appointed with the job of retrieving the Sceptre of Order from the forces of chaos, led by Arech Dragonbreath. ''King's Bounty'' is notably considered the forerunner of the ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic]]'' series of games, while it was itself clearly \"inspired\" by the game ''[[Chaos: The Battle of Wizards]]'' for the [[ZX Spectrum]].\n\nA [[Sega Genesis]] port was developed and released in North America on February 21, 1991, with a multitude of graphical changes. The gameplay was also modified to incorporate [[Real-time strategy|real time]] [[overworld]] exploration.\n\nIn 2008, a spiritual sequel titled ''[[King's Bounty: The Legend]]'' was released.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\nThe player leads the [[hero]] and his army across the four continents, acquiring up to 25 pieces of a map revealing the hidden location to the Sceptre of Order before King Maximus dies. Various details of this task are left to player's discretion, allowing for flexible gameplay. For instance, not all the scattered map sections are required; if the player is able to correctly determine the location of the sceptre's burial spot before acquiring all 25 map pieces, the game is won. If the sceptre is not recovered before King Maximus dies (the time varies depending on difficulty setting), the game ends in defeat. The location of the sceptre, the artifacts and which castles the villains inhabit are all randomized each game, adding to its replayability.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe hero is given a weekly [[Contract|commission]] from the king to track down 17 [[villain]]s across the 4 continents. With each defeat of the progressively stronger villain's army, the character claims (along with the reward money for the \"King's Bounty\" on that villain) another piece of the map revealing the sceptre's burial location. Along the way, numerous treasure chests are encountered scattered across the map. Some of these chests represent various events that increase the hero's inherent abilities, such as [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] strength or weekly income; others may contain one of eight [[Artifact (fantasy)|artifacts]], which themselves provide a piece of the map, in addition to conferring their own unique powers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAs the player explores, he encounters various types of creatures native to the different continents, some of which are able to be recruited. Most of these creatures are significant upgrades from the normal human forces available to the player at the King's castle, and are required to defeat the tougher villain armies. However, as their strength increases, so does the amount of gold required to retain them, which must be paid weekly. Although the player's commission can be raised in a variety of ways, such as maintaining a [[garrison]] of forces at a captured castle, if their costs exceed their income for too long, and they run out of money, their army will abandon them. Furthermore, each of the various army units have either a positive, neutral, or negative predisposition towards other. An army composed of creatures that \"dislike\" each other lowers their \"morale\", making them much less effective in combat. Conversely, recruiting creatures which share a positive predisposition towards each other increases their morale. Assembling an \"ideal\" army is another open-ended aspect of the game.\n\n''King's Bounty'' features four selectable hero [[Character classes|classes]]: Barbarian, Knight, Paladin, and Sorceress. Each class varies in magical ability, starting troop power, natural leadership ability, and Commissions (income per week). As the king's bounty is collected on more villains, the king may increase the [[Ranking|rank]] of the hero. This rank determines in part what troops the hero may recruit, and more importantly, the strength of the hero's attributes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nCombat in ''King's Bounty'' occurs when [[Siege|sieging]] an occupied castle or engaging a wandering army on the main map. Combat turns are simple, with the player's army moving first, followed by the opponent's. Armies are stack-based, with any one stack taking up one square on the battlefield.

The game follows the player's character, a hero of King Maximus, appointed with the job of retrieving the Sceptre of Order from the forces of chaos, led by Arech Dragonbreath. ''King's Bounty'' is notably considered the forerunner of the ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic]]'' series of games, while it was itself clearly \"inspired\" by the game ''[[Chaos: The Battle of Wizards]]'' for the [[ZX Spectrum]].\n\nA [[Sega Genesis]] port was developed and released in North America on February 21, 1991, with a multitude of graphical changes. The gameplay was also modified to incorporate [[Real-time strategy|real time]] [[overworld]] exploration.\n\nIn 2008, a spiritual sequel titled ''[[King's Bounty: The Legend]]'' was released.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\nThe player leads the [[hero]] and his army across the four continents, acquiring up to 25 pieces of a map revealing the hidden location to the Sceptre of Order before King Maximus dies. Various details of this task are left to player's discretion, allowing for flexible gameplay. For instance, not all the scattered map sections are required; if the player is able to correctly determine the location of the sceptre's burial spot before acquiring all 25 map pieces, the game is won. If the sceptre is not recovered before King Maximus dies (the time varies depending on difficulty setting), the game ends in defeat. The location of the sceptre, the artifacts and which castles the villains inhabit are all randomized each game, adding to its replayability.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe hero is given a weekly [[Contract|commission]] from the king to track down 17 [[villain]]s across the 4 continents. With each defeat of the progressively stronger villain's army, the character claims (along with the reward money for the \"King's Bounty\" on that villain) another piece of the map revealing the sceptre's burial location. Along the way, numerous treasure chests are encountered scattered across the map. Some of these chests represent various events that increase the hero's inherent abilities, such as [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] strength or weekly income; others may contain one of eight [[Artifact (fantasy)|artifacts]], which themselves provide a piece of the map, in addition to conferring their own unique powers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAs the player explores, he encounters various types of creatures native to the different continents, some of which are able to be recruited. Most of these creatures are significant upgrades from the normal human forces available to the player at the King's castle, and are required to defeat the tougher villain armies. However, as their strength increases, so does the amount of gold required to retain them, which must be paid weekly. Although the player's commission can be raised in a variety of ways, such as maintaining a [[garrison]] of forces at a captured castle, if their costs exceed their income for too long, and they run out of money, their army will abandon them. Furthermore, each of the various army units have either a positive, neutral, or negative predisposition towards other. An army composed of creatures that \"dislike\" each other lowers their \"morale\", making them much less effective in combat. Conversely, recruiting creatures which share a positive predisposition towards each other increases their morale. Assembling an \"ideal\" army is another open-ended aspect of the game.\n\n''King's Bounty'' features four selectable hero [[Character classes|classes]]: Barbarian, Knight, Paladin, and Sorceress. Each class varies in magical ability, starting troop power, natural leadership ability, and Commissions (income per week). As the king's bounty is collected on more villains, the king may increase the [[Ranking|rank]] of the hero. This rank determines in part what troops the hero may recruit, and more importantly, the strength of the hero's attributes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nCombat in ''King's Bounty'' occurs when [[Siege|sieging]] an occupied castle or engaging a wandering army on the main map. Combat turns are simple, with the player's army moving first, followed by the opponent's. Armies are stack-based, with any one stack taking up one square on the battlefield. Stacks can represent anything from one [[cavalry]] unit to thousands of [[peasants]]. The player can use a number of either Adventuring spells, only used in the overworld, or Combat spells. Adventuring spells allow movement to Towns, Castles, create bridges, increase leadership (Raise Control), stop time for some number of moves, finds the villain at a castle, or creates an army stack if the player has a space (Instant Army). During combat, the player can cast one spell per turn that cause damage via lightning, fireball, or turn undead, can resurrect dead troops, teleport a friendly or enemy unit to an open position, freeze an enemy unit so it cannot move, or increase an existing troop through cloning (Clone).{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n== Amiga ==\nThe game's graphics were completely redone (by [[Bonita Long-Hemsath]] and [[Kenneth L. Mayfield]]). The hair and skin color of many characters were changed, and many of the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] representing armies underwent redesign. Mouse support was also added making most parts of the screen interactive, by clicking or hovering.\n\n==''King's Bounty'' for Sega Mega Drive/Genesis==\n\n===Gameplay changes===\nThe Mega Drive/Genesis port of ''King's Bounty'' is notably different from the PC version of the game, the most obvious change being the move into the realm of [[Real-time strategy|real time]]. Armies on the [[overworld]] now move on their own and automatically engage the hero. This makes the game arguably more difficult, as a careful player of the DOS version could often maneuver past several wandering armies at a time without being successfully engaged. Also affected is the game's time limit. Although it has become harsher, it is somewhat balanced by the fact that trekking across desert squares no longer takes 1 day, and changing continents no longer ends the week.\n\nGone from this version of ''King's Bounty'' are all keyboard controls and hero naming capabilities.\n\n===Graphical changes===\nThe game uses the same improved graphic set Amiga version had. As a minor change, wandering armies are now displayed according to their most powerful stack, as opposed to the generic stacks of the DOS version that corresponded to the current continent.

Viewers admired Spock's \"coolness, his intelligence\", and his ability to successfully take on any task, adds Fischer.

Nimoy earned three [[Emmy Award]] nominations for his work on the program.\n\nAmong Spock's recognized and unique symbols he incorporated into the series was the [[Vulcan salute]], which became identified with him. Nimoy created the sign himself from his childhood memories of the way ''[[Kohen|kohanim]]'' (Jewish priests) hold their hand when giving blessings. The accompanying spoken blessing is \"Live long and prosper\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Pogrebin |first=Abigail |authorlink=Abigail Pogrebin |title=Stars of David: Prominent Jews Talk About Being Jewish |origyear=Originally published 2005 |year=2007 |publisher=[[Broadway Books]] |location=New York |page=198 |isbn=978-0-7679-1613-4 |oclc=153581202 |lccn=2005042141|title-link=Stars of David: Prominent Jews Talk About Being Jewish }}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|id=G1d83XOORP0|title=\"Leonard Nimoy: The Origin of Spock's Greeting \u2013 Greater Talent Network\"|link=no}}</ref>\n\nNimoy also came up with the concept of the \"[[Vulcan nerve pinch]]\", which he suggested as a replacement for the scripted knock out method of using the butt of his phaser. He wanted a more sophisticated way of rendering a person unconscious. Nimoy explained to the show's director that Spock had, per the story, gone to the Vulcan Institute of Technology and had studied human anatomy. Spock also had the ability to project a unique form of energy through his fingertips. Nimoy explained the idea of putting his hand on his neck and shoulder to Shatner, and they rehearsed it.

The [[Star Trek (film series)|first six Star Trek movies]] feature the original ''Star Trek'' cast including Nimoy, who also directed two of the films. He played the elder Spock in the 2009 [[Star Trek (film)|''Star Trek'' movie]] and reprised the role in a brief appearance in the 2013 sequel, ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'', both directed by [[J.

In 1971 he played the starring role of Tevye in ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', which toured for eight weeks. Nimoy, who had performed in the Yiddish theater as a young man, said the part was like a \"homecoming\" for him, explaining that his parents, like Tevye, also came from a [[shtetl]] in Russia and could relate to the play when they saw him in it.<ref name=Isenberg>Isenberg, Barbara.

During the run of the play, Nimoy took over as its director and wanted his character to be \"rough and tough,\" and insisted on having tattoos.

In the 1970s, he studied photography at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].<ref name=\"rawnerve\" /><ref>[http://petapixel.com/2015/02/27/leonard-nimoys-passion-for-photography/ Leonard Nimoy's Passion for Photography], PetaPixel, February 27, 2015</ref> His photography studies at UCLA occurred after ''Star Trek'' and ''Mission: Impossible'', when Nimoy seriously considered changing careers. His work has been exhibited at the R. Michelson Galleries in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]<ref name=\"rawnerve\" /> and the [[Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art]].\n\n===Directing===\nNimoy made his directorial debut in 1973, with the \"Death on a Barge\" segment for an episode of ''[[Night Gallery]]'' during its final season. It was not until the early 1980s that Nimoy resumed directing on a consistent basis, ranging from television shows to motion pictures. Nimoy directed ''Star Trek III: The Search for Spock'' in 1984 and ''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' in 1986. He went on to direct the hit comedy ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]'' (1987), followed by ''[[The Good Mother (1988 film)|The Good Mother]]'' (1988) and ''[[Funny About Love]]'' (1990). In 1994 he directed his last feature film, ''[[Holy Matrimony (1994 film)|Holy Matrimony]]''. His final directorial credit was \"Killshot\", the 1995 pilot episode for ''[[Deadly Games]]'', a short-lived science-fiction television series.\n\n===Writing===\nNimoy authored two volumes of autobiography. The first was called ''[[I Am Not Spock]]'' (1975) and was controversial, as many fans incorrectly assumed Nimoy was distancing himself from the Spock character. In the book, Nimoy conducts dialogues between himself and Spock. The contents of this first autobiography also touched on a self-proclaimed \"[[identity crisis]]\" that seemed to haunt Nimoy throughout his career. It also related to an apparent love/hate relationship with the character of Spock and the Trek franchise.\n\n{{quote|I went through a definite identity crisis. The question was whether to embrace Mr. Spock or to fight the onslaught of public interest. I realize now that I really had no choice in the matter. Spock and ''Star Trek'' were very much alive and there wasn't anything that I could do to change that.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://startrekdom.blogspot.com/2007/05/leonard-nimoys-lovehate-relationship.html |title=Leonard Nimoy's Love/Hate Relationship with Mr. Spock |last=B. |first=Jared |date=May 24, 2007 |website=Trekdom \u2013 Star Trek Fanzine |type=Blog |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nThe second volume, ''[[I Am Spock]]'' (1995), saw Nimoy communicating that he finally realized his years of portraying the Spock character had led to a much greater identification between the fictional character and himself. Nimoy had much input into how Spock would act in certain situations, and conversely Nimoy's contemplation of how Spock acted gave him cause to think about things in a way he never would have, had he not portrayed the character. Nimoy maintained that in some meaningful sense he had merged with Spock while at the same time maintaining the distance between fact and fiction. In 2014, the audiobook version of ''I Am Spock'', read by Nimoy, was published.<ref>Brilliance Audio, {{ISBN|978-1491575727}}</ref>\n\nNimoy also composed several volumes of poetry, some published along with a number of his photographs. A later poetic volume entitled ''A Lifetime of Love: Poems on the Passages of Life'' was published in 2002. His poetry can be found in the Contemporary Poets index of The HyperTexts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehypertexts.com |title=The HyperTexts |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}</ref> Nimoy adapted and starred in the one-man play ''Vincent'' (1981), based on the play ''Van Gogh'' (1979) by Phillip Stephens.\n\nIn 1995, Nimoy was involved in the production of ''[[Primortals]]'', a comic book series published by [[Tekno Comix]] about [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] with aliens, which had arisen from a discussion he had with [[Isaac Asimov]]. There was a novelization by [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve Perry]].\n\n===Music===\nDuring and following ''Star Trek'', Nimoy also released [[Leonard Nimoy discography|five albums of musical vocal recordings on Dot Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maidenwine.com/lps_02.html |title=Two Sides Of Leonard Nimoy |website=The Musical Touch of Leonard Nimoy |publisher=Maidenwine.com |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714021320/http://www.maidenwine.com/lps_02.html |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On his first album, ''[[Leonard Nimoy Presents Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space|Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space]]'', and half of his second album ''[[Two Sides of Leonard Nimoy]]'', science fiction-themed songs are featured where Nimoy sings as Spock. On his final three albums, he sings popular folk songs of the era and cover versions of popular songs, such as \"[[Proud Mary]]\" and [[Johnny Cash]]'s \"[[I Walk the Line]]\". There are also several songs on the later albums that were written or co-written by Nimoy. He described how his recording career got started:\n\n:[[Charles Randolph Grean|Charles Grean]] of [[Dot Records]] had arranged with the studio to do an album of space music based on music from ''Star Trek'', and he has a teenage daughter who's a fan of the show and a fan of Mr. Spock. She said, 'Well, if you're going to do an album of music from ''Star Trek'', then Mr. Spock should be on the album.' So Dot contacted me and asked me if I would be interested in either speaking or singing on the record. I said I was very interested in doing both.{{nbsp}}... That was the first album we did, which was called ''Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space''. It was very well received and successful enough that Dot then approached me and asked me to sign a long-term contract.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maidenwine.com/home.html |title=The Musical Touch of Leonard Nimoy |publisher=Maidenwine.com |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714021529/http://www.maidenwine.com/home.html |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n<!--hide uncited material\nThe albums were popular and resulted in numerous live appearances and promotional record signings that attracted crowds of fans in the thousands.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The early recordings were produced by [[Charles Randolph Grean|Charles Grean]], who may be best known for his version of \"Quentin's Theme\" from the mid-sixties [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] soap opera ''[[Dark Shadows]]''.

He was known for playing [[Spock]] in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise, a character he portrayed in television and film for almost fifty years, from [[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|a pilot episode]] shot in late 1964 to his [[Star Trek Into Darkness|final film performance]] in 2013.<ref name=\"NYT-20150227\" />\n\nNimoy began his career in his early twenties, teaching acting classes in [[Hollywood]] and making minor film and television appearances through the 1950s, as well as playing the title role in ''[[Kid Monk Baroni]]''. Foreshadowing his fame as a semi-alien, he played Narab, one of three Martian invaders, in the 1952 [[Serial film|movie serial]] ''[[Zombies of the Stratosphere]]''. From 1959 to 1962 he appeared in four episodes of ''[[Wagon Train]]''.\n\nIn December 1964, he made his first appearance in the rejected ''Star Trek'' television pilot \"[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]\", and went on to play the character of Spock until the end of the production run in early 1969, followed by eight feature films and guest appearances in the various spin-off series. The character has had a significant cultural impact and earned Nimoy three [[Emmy Award]] nominations. ''[[TV Guide]]'' named Spock one of the 50 greatest TV characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/leonard-nimoy/bio/161833 |title=Leonard Nimoy: Biography |website=TVGuide.com |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |location=San Francisco, California |accessdate=February 3, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/tv/best-tv-characters-of-all-time/?cur=spock&morepics=1 |title=Spock |last=Jensen |first=K.

His work has been exhibited at the R. Michelson Galleries in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]<ref name=\"rawnerve\" /> and the [[Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art]].\n\n===Directing===\nNimoy made his directorial debut in 1973, with the \"Death on a Barge\" segment for an episode of ''[[Night Gallery]]'' during its final season. It was not until the early 1980s that Nimoy resumed directing on a consistent basis, ranging from television shows to motion pictures. Nimoy directed ''Star Trek III: The Search for Spock'' in 1984 and ''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' in 1986. He went on to direct the hit comedy ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]'' (1987), followed by ''[[The Good Mother (1988 film)|The Good Mother]]'' (1988) and ''[[Funny About Love]]'' (1990). In 1994 he directed his last feature film, ''[[Holy Matrimony (1994 film)|Holy Matrimony]]''. His final directorial credit was \"Killshot\", the 1995 pilot episode for ''[[Deadly Games]]'', a short-lived science-fiction television series.\n\n===Writing===\nNimoy authored two volumes of autobiography. The first was called ''[[I Am Not Spock]]'' (1975) and was controversial, as many fans incorrectly assumed Nimoy was distancing himself from the Spock character. In the book, Nimoy conducts dialogues between himself and Spock. The contents of this first autobiography also touched on a self-proclaimed \"[[identity crisis]]\" that seemed to haunt Nimoy throughout his career. It also related to an apparent love/hate relationship with the character of Spock and the Trek franchise.\n\n{{quote|I went through a definite identity crisis. The question was whether to embrace Mr. Spock or to fight the onslaught of public interest. I realize now that I really had no choice in the matter.

Nimoy had much input into how Spock would act in certain situations, and conversely Nimoy's contemplation of how Spock acted gave him cause to think about things in a way he never would have, had he not portrayed the character. Nimoy maintained that in some meaningful sense he had merged with Spock while at the same time maintaining the distance between fact and fiction. In 2014, the audiobook version of ''I Am Spock'', read by Nimoy, was published.<ref>Brilliance Audio, {{ISBN|978-1491575727}}</ref>\n\nNimoy also composed several volumes of poetry, some published along with a number of his photographs. A later poetic volume entitled ''A Lifetime of Love: Poems on the Passages of Life'' was published in 2002. His poetry can be found in the Contemporary Poets index of The HyperTexts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehypertexts.com |title=The HyperTexts |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}</ref> Nimoy adapted and starred in the one-man play ''Vincent'' (1981), based on the play ''Van Gogh'' (1979) by Phillip Stephens.\n\nIn 1995, Nimoy was involved in the production of ''[[Primortals]]'', a comic book series published by [[Tekno Comix]] about [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] with aliens, which had arisen from a discussion he had with [[Isaac Asimov]]. There was a novelization by [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve Perry]].\n\n===Music===\nDuring and following ''Star Trek'', Nimoy also released [[Leonard Nimoy discography|five albums of musical vocal recordings on Dot Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maidenwine.com/lps_02.html |title=Two Sides Of Leonard Nimoy |website=The Musical Touch of Leonard Nimoy |publisher=Maidenwine.com |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714021320/http://www.maidenwine.com/lps_02.html |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On his first album, ''[[Leonard Nimoy Presents Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space|Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space]]'', and half of his second album ''[[Two Sides of Leonard Nimoy]]'', science fiction-themed songs are featured where Nimoy sings as Spock. On his final three albums, he sings popular folk songs of the era and cover versions of popular songs, such as \"[[Proud Mary]]\" and [[Johnny Cash]]'s \"[[I Walk the Line]]\". There are also several songs on the later albums that were written or co-written by Nimoy. He described how his recording career got started:\n\n:[[Charles Randolph Grean|Charles Grean]] of [[Dot Records]] had arranged with the studio to do an album of space music based on music from ''Star Trek'', and he has a teenage daughter who's a fan of the show and a fan of Mr. Spock. She said, 'Well, if you're going to do an album of music from ''Star Trek'', then Mr. Spock should be on the album.' So Dot contacted me and asked me if I would be interested in either speaking or singing on the record. I said I was very interested in doing both.{{nbsp}}... That was the first album we did, which was called ''Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space''. It was very well received and successful enough that Dot then approached me and asked me to sign a long-term contract.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maidenwine.com/home.html |title=The Musical Touch of Leonard Nimoy |publisher=Maidenwine.com |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714021529/http://www.maidenwine.com/home.html |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n<!--hide uncited material\nThe albums were popular and resulted in numerous live appearances and promotional record signings that attracted crowds of fans in the thousands.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The early recordings were produced by [[Charles Randolph Grean|Charles Grean]], who may be best known for his version of \"Quentin's Theme\" from the mid-sixties [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] soap opera ''[[Dark Shadows]]''.
