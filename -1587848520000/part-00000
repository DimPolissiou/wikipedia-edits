In March 2013, he released the [[TV Mania]] side project with former Duran Duran guitarist, [[Warren Cuccurullo]].\n\n==Early history==\n{{one source|section|date=December 2017}}\nNicholas James Bates was the only child of well-off parents who were the owners of a [[Birmingham]] toy shop. He attended [[Woodrush High School]] in [[Wythall]], north [[Worcestershire]]. He and John Taylor (from the nearby village of Hollywood) formed a band called 'RAF'. Bates left school in 1978 at the age of sixteen, and founded Duran Duran with school friends [[Stephen Duffy]] (vocals), [[John Taylor (bass guitarist)|John Taylor]] (who then played lead guitar), and Simon Colley (bass). Rhodes reportedly owns the Duran Duran name; this was mentioned in the [[The Andy Warhol Diaries|Andy Warhol diaries]]. Warhol told his diarist Pat Hackett that Duran Duran had split up ([[Duran Duran#1986\u20131989: Le Bon, Rhodes and John Taylor trio|in 1986]], Andy Taylor and Roger Taylor left the band, returning in 2001 to reunite and create  the [[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]] album) \"but Nick owns the name so it's still Duran Duran\".\n\nAt about the same time as the name Duran Duran was chosen for the band, Nick Bates decided to change his stage name, which was given to him by John Taylor before the first interview they had together for their band. He cited a dislike for being called [[masturbation|Master Bates]] and chose the name \"Rhodes\" after the brand of [[Rhodes piano|electric piano]].\n\nAs the band coalesced into its final line-up in 1979\u201380, Duran Duran started playing at a local [[Birmingham]] club called \"[[Rum Runner (nightclub)|The Rum Runner]]\".  The club owners became the band's managers, and Rhodes began working at the club as a disc jockey.<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\n==Contributions to Duran Duran==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2019}}\nThe band achieved rapid success, and Rhodes was a driving force throughout. An unschooled musician, he experimented with the sounds his [[analogue synthesiser]]s were capable of, but shied away from the \"novelty\" sounds of some other early synth bands. The distinctive warble of \"[[Save A Prayer]]\", the keyboard stabs of \"[[A View to a Kill (song)|A View to a Kill]]\", and the string sounds of \"[[Come Undone (Duran Duran song)|Come Undone]]\" and \"[[Ordinary World]]\" are some of his most recognisable creations, as well as the futuristic oscillating synth that characterised Duran Duran's self-titled first album. He popularised the [[Crumar]] Performer on the early records.\n\nRhodes was also quick to recognise the potential of the music video, and pushed the band to put more effort into their early videos than seemed warranted at the time (before the advent of MTV).  Barely twenty when the band hit major stardom, he cultivated an androgynous and sometimes flamboyant image, wore heavy makeup, and changed his hair colour at whim. By the late 1990s, Rhodes had begun writing lyrics for Duran Duran, as well as music. His digitally altered voice is heard on the title track to the 1997 album ''[[Medazzaland]]''.\n\nIn 2001, the original five members of Duran Duran reunited to record new music; see [[Duran Duran]] for details.\n\n==Record production==\nRhodes studied production techniques while in the studio with Duran Duran, eventually helping to mix several tracks on the ''[[Rio (Duran Duran album)|Rio]]'' album, and was a co-producer on many of the band's later albums.\n\nIn early 1983, he discovered the band [[Kajagoogoo]] and co-produced their debut single ''Too Shy'' which became a UK no.1 (prior to any of Duran's singles reaching no.1).<ref name=\"movers\">{{cite book|last=Rees|first=Dafydd|first2=Luke |last2=Crampton|title=Rock movers & shakers|publisher=ABC-Clio Inc|year=1991|page=1944|isbn=978-0-87436-661-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t5oYAAAAIAAJ&q=%2B%22Nick+Rhodes%22+%2B%22duran+duran%22&dq=%2B%22Nick+Rhodes%22+%2B%22duran+duran%22&cd=9}}</ref>\n\nRhodes and [[Warren Cuccurullo]] wrote and produced three tracks for the [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] reunion album in 1996;<ref name=\"rollingstone2\">{{cite journal|ISSN=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zA4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12&dq=%2B%22Nick+Rhodes%22+%2B%22blondie%22&cd=10#v=onepage&q=%2B%22Nick%20Rhodes%22%20%2B%22blondie%22&f=false|title=The Beat|last=Newman|first=Melinda|date=1 February 1997|volume= 109|number=5|work=[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]|accessdate=30 January 2010}}</ref> the tracks were not used, but one song called \"Pop Trash Movie\" was later recorded by Duran Duran for the 2000 album ''[[Pop Trash]]''.\n\nIn 2002, Rhodes co-produced and played additional synthesizers in nine tracks of the album ''[[Welcome to the Monkey House (album)|Welcome to the Monkey House]]'' by [[The Dandy Warhols]]. In 2004 he produced British-based pop group [[Riviera F]] for their debut EP ''[[International Lover]]'', published on Pop Cult/Tape Modern (Rhodes & Stephen Duffy's label).\n\n==Side projects==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2017}}\nWith his bandmates [[Simon Le Bon]] and [[Roger Andrew Taylor|Roger Taylor]], Rhodes formed the side project [[Arcadia (band)|Arcadia]]  while Duran Duran was on hiatus in 1985. The band had a moody, keyboard-heavy sound, far more atmospheric than Duran Duran (or the hard rock of the other Duran splinter group of 1985, [[Power Station (band)|Power Station]]).\n\nThe band scored a major hit with \"Election Day\" and the band's only album, ''[[So Red the Rose]]'', went platinum in the US but was less successful in their native UK. The band never toured and was dissolved when Duran Duran regrouped in 1986. In 1999, Rhodes reunited with Duran Duran's original vocalist, [[Stephen Duffy]], to create new music based on some of the earliest Duran music the two had written together. The result was the album ''Dark Circles,'' released under the name [[The Devils (band)|The Devils]]. Also in 1999, Rhodes had a small guest appearance (in voice only) as a Canadian bomber pilot in [[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]].\n\nIn 2006 Rhodes and [[John Taylor (bass guitarist)|John Taylor]] collaborated on the compilation album ''[[Only After Dark (album)|Only After Dark]]''. In 2011 Rhodes along with [[Andrew Wyatt]] and [[Mark Ronson]] remixed [[Depeche Mode]]'s ''[[Personal Jesus]]'' for the British electronic band's remix compilation ''[[Remixes 2: 81-11]]''. Also in 2011, Rhodes wrote the afterword to the award-winning '80s [[7-inch]] vinyl cover art book [[Matthew Chojnacki|Put the Needle on the Record]].\n\nIn March 2013, [[TV Mania]] made up of Nick Rhodes and ex-Duran Duran guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, released ''Bored with Prozac and the Internet?''. Throughout the 1990s, Rhodes worked on this side project with Cuccurullo. To support the launch of the project, Rhodes had an exhibition of his photography, BEI INCUBI (Beautiful Nightmares) at The Vinyl Factory in [[Chelsea, London]] on 7 March 2013.\n\n==Personal life==\nRhodes met Julie Anne Friedman (heiress to the Iowa, USA [[Younkers Department Store]] fortune) at a yacht party while on an American tour in 1982, and married her on 18 August  1984. They have one daughter together, Tatjana Lee Orchid (born 23 August  1986). After a brief separation and an attempt to reconcile, they filed for divorce in 1992.<ref name=\"stannit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-115890312|title=On The Grid|date=23 April 2004|publisher=[[London Evening Standard]]|accessdate=30 January 2010}}</ref>  Rhodes has had several long relationships with various women but has not remarried.\n\nRhodes, as a former art student, became enamoured of the art world early in his career, making friends with famed \"Pop\" artist [[Andy Warhol]] and [[The Factory]] crowd, and attending exhibitions worldwide. At the end of 1984, he released his own book of abstract art photographs called ''Interference''.<ref name=\"cc\">{{cite book|title=Creative camera, Issues 241-52|work=Creative Camera magazine|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b05WAAAAMAAJ&q=%2B%22Nick+Rhodes%22+%2B%22interference%22&dq=%2B%22Nick+Rhodes%22+%2B%22interference%22&cd=6}}</ref> Many of the photos were displayed at an exhibition at the Hamilton Gallery in London. He continues to showcase photography on occasion, including in British magazines such as Tatler and also occasionally appears at the Cannes International Film Festival.\n\nIn November 2011, Rhodes received an Honorary Doctorate of Arts degree from the [[University of Bedfordshire]], for his services to the [[music industry]]. Rhodes appears in [[Burke's Peerage]] under his second cousin's entry for the family of Lindley-Highfield of [[Ballumbie#Ballumbie Castle|Ballumbie Castle]], being related to the Highfield family through his paternal grandmother, Irene Lavinia Bates (n\u00e9e Highfield).<ref name=\"Burkes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.burkespeerage.com/new_records.php?letter=l|title=Lindley-Highfield of Ballumbie Castle|date=6 October 2010|publisher=[[Burke's Peerage]]|accessdate=5 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nRhodes is a long time vegetarian, occasionally a [[Pescetarianism|pescatarian]]. In a 2012 interview at [http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/2012/rhodes-for-me-london-will-always-be-planet-earth/ DuranDuran.com] he cited Italian, Lebanese and Indian food as his favourites.

An unschooled musician, he experimented with the sounds his [[analogue synthesiser]]s were capable of, but shied away from the \"novelty\" sounds of some other early synth bands. The distinctive warble of \"[[Save A Prayer]]\", the keyboard stabs of \"[[A View to a Kill (song)|A View to a Kill]]\", and the string sounds of \"[[Come Undone (Duran Duran song)|Come Undone]]\" and \"[[Ordinary World]]\" are some of his most recognisable creations, as well as the futuristic oscillating synth that characterised Duran Duran's self-titled first album. He popularised the [[Crumar]] Performer on the early records.\n\nRhodes was also quick to recognise the potential of the music video, and pushed the band to put more effort into their early videos than seemed warranted at the time (before the advent of MTV).  Barely twenty when the band hit major stardom, he cultivated an androgynous and sometimes flamboyant image, wore heavy makeup, and changed his hair colour at whim. By the late 1990s, Rhodes had begun writing lyrics for Duran Duran, as well as music. His digitally altered voice is heard on the title track to the 1997 album ''[[Medazzaland]]''.\n\nIn 2001, the original five members of Duran Duran reunited to record new music; see [[Duran Duran]] for details.\n\n==Record production==\nRhodes studied production techniques while in the studio with Duran Duran, eventually helping to mix several tracks on the ''[[Rio (Duran Duran album)|Rio]]'' album, and was a co-producer on many of the band's later albums.\n\nIn early 1983, he discovered the band [[Kajagoogoo]] and co-produced their debut single ''Too Shy'' which became a UK no.1 (prior to any of Duran's singles reaching no.1).<ref name=\"movers\">{{cite book|last=Rees|first=Dafydd|first2=Luke |last2=Crampton|title=Rock movers & shakers|publisher=ABC-Clio Inc|year=1991|page=1944|isbn=978-0-87436-661-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t5oYAAAAIAAJ&q=%2B%22Nick+Rhodes%22+%2B%22duran+duran%22&dq=%2B%22Nick+Rhodes%22+%2B%22duran+duran%22&cd=9}}</ref>\n\nRhodes and [[Warren Cuccurullo]] wrote and produced three tracks for the [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] reunion album in 1996;<ref name=\"rollingstone2\">{{cite journal|ISSN=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zA4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12&dq=%2B%22Nick+Rhodes%22+%2B%22blondie%22&cd=10#v=onepage&q=%2B%22Nick%20Rhodes%22%20%2B%22blondie%22&f=false|title=The Beat|last=Newman|first=Melinda|date=1 February 1997|volume= 109|number=5|work=[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]|accessdate=30 January 2010}}</ref> the tracks were not used, but one song called \"Pop Trash Movie\" was later recorded by Duran Duran for the 2000 album ''[[Pop Trash]]''.\n\nIn 2002, Rhodes co-produced and played additional synthesizers in nine tracks of the album ''[[Welcome to the Monkey House (album)|Welcome to the Monkey House]]'' by [[The Dandy Warhols]]. In 2004 he produced British-based pop group [[Riviera F]] for their debut EP ''[[International Lover]]'', published on Pop Cult/Tape Modern (Rhodes & Stephen Duffy\u2019s label).\n\n==Side projects==\n{{unsourced|section|date=December 2017}}\nWith his bandmates [[Simon Le Bon]] and [[Roger Andrew Taylor|Roger Taylor]], Rhodes formed the side project [[Arcadia (band)|Arcadia]]  while Duran Duran was on hiatus in 1985. The band had a moody, keyboard-heavy sound, far more atmospheric than Duran Duran (or the hard rock of the other Duran splinter group of 1985, [[Power Station (band)|Power Station]]). \n\nThe band scored a major hit with \"Election Day\" and the band's only album, ''[[So Red the Rose]]'', went platinum in the US but was less successful in their native UK. The band never toured and was dissolved when Duran Duran regrouped in 1986. In 1999, Rhodes reunited with Duran Duran's original vocalist, [[Stephen Duffy]], to create new music based on some of the earliest Duran music the two had written together. The result was the album ''Dark Circles,'' released under the name [[The Devils (band)|The Devils]]. Also in 1999, Rhodes had a small guest appearance (in voice only) as a Canadian bomber pilot in [[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]].\n\nIn 2006 Rhodes and [[John Taylor (bass guitarist)|John Taylor]] collaborated on the compilation album ''[[Only After Dark (album)|Only After Dark]]''. In 2011 Rhodes along with [[Andrew Wyatt]] and [[Mark Ronson]] remixed [[Depeche Mode]]'s ''[[Personal Jesus]]'' for the British electronic band's remix compilation ''[[Remixes 2: 81-11]]''. Also in 2011, Rhodes wrote the afterword to the award-winning '80s [[7-inch]] vinyl cover art book [[Matthew Chojnacki|Put the Needle on the Record]].\n\nIn March 2013, [[TV Mania]] made up of Nick Rhodes and ex-Duran Duran guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, released ''Bored with Prozac and the Internet?''. Throughout the 1990s, Rhodes worked on this side project with Cuccurullo. To support the launch of the project, Rhodes had an exhibition of his photography, BEI INCUBI (Beautiful Nightmares) at The Vinyl Factory in [[Chelsea, London]] on 7 March 2013.\n\n==Personal life==\nRhodes met Julie Anne Friedman (heiress to the Iowa, USA [[Younkers Department Store]] fortune) at a yacht party while on an American tour in 1982, and married her on 18 August  1984. They have one daughter together, Tatjana Lee Orchid (born 23 August  1986). After a brief separation and an attempt to reconcile, they filed for divorce in 1992.<ref name=\"stannit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-115890312|title=On The Grid|date=23 April 2004|publisher=[[London Evening Standard]]|accessdate=30 January 2010}}</ref>  Rhodes has had several long relationships with various women but has not remarried. \n\nRhodes, as a former art student, became enamoured of the art world early in his career, making friends with famed \"Pop\" artist [[Andy Warhol]] and [[The Factory]] crowd, and attending exhibitions worldwide. At the end of 1984, he released his own book of abstract art photographs called ''Interference''.<ref name=\"cc\">{{cite book|title=Creative camera, Issues 241-52|publisher=Creative Camera magazine|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b05WAAAAMAAJ&q=%2B%22Nick+Rhodes%22+%2B%22interference%22&dq=%2B%22Nick+Rhodes%22+%2B%22interference%22&cd=6}}</ref> Many of the photos were displayed at an exhibition at the Hamilton Gallery in London. He continues to showcase photography on occasion, including in British magazines such as Tatler and also occasionally appears at the Cannes International Film Festival.\n\nIn November 2011, Rhodes received an Honorary Doctorate of Arts degree from the [[University of Bedfordshire]], for his services to the [[music industry]]. Rhodes appears in [[Burke's Peerage]] under his second cousin's entry for the family of Lindley-Highfield of [[Ballumbie#Ballumbie_Castle|Ballumbie Castle]], being related to the Highfield family through his paternal grandmother, Irene Lavinia Bates (n\u00e9e Highfield).<ref name=\"Burkes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.burkespeerage.com/new_records.php?letter=l|title=Lindley-Highfield of Ballumbie Castle|date=6 October 2010|publisher=[[Burke's Peerage]]|accessdate=5 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nRhodes is a long time vegetarian, occasionally a [[Pescetarianism|pescatarian]]. In a 2012 interview at [http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/2012/rhodes-for-me-london-will-always-be-planet-earth/ DuranDuran.com] he cited Italian, Lebanese and Indian food as his favourites.

According to this study, it is probable that the ancestors of the Native Americans would have remained for a time in the region of the [[Bering Strait]], after which there would have been a rapid movement of settling of the Americas, taking the founding lineages to [[South America]].\n\nAccording to a 2016 study, focused on mtDNA lineages, \"a small population entered the Americas via a coastal route around 16.0 ka, following previous isolation in eastern Beringia for ~2.4 to 9 thousand years after separation from eastern Siberian populations. Following a rapid movement throughout the Americas, limited gene flow in South America resulted in a marked phylogeographic structure of populations, which persisted through time. All of the ancient mitochondrial lineages detected in this study were absent from modern data sets, suggesting a high extinction rate. To investigate this further, we applied a novel principal components multiple logistic regression test to Bayesian serial coalescent simulations.

Following a rapid movement throughout the Americas, limited gene flow in South America resulted in a marked phylogeographic structure of populations, which persisted through time. All of the ancient mitochondrial lineages detected in this study were absent from modern data sets, suggesting a high extinction rate. To investigate this further, we applied a novel principal components multiple logistic regression test to Bayesian serial coalescent simulations. The analysis supported a scenario in which European colonization caused a substantial loss of pre-Columbian lineages\".<ref name=\"LlamasFehren-Schmitz2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Llamas|first1=B.|last2=Fehren-Schmitz|first2=L.|last3=Valverde|first3=G.|last4=Soubrier|first4=J.|last5=Mallick|first5=S.|last6=Rohland|first6=N.|last7=Nordenfelt|first7=S.|last8=Valdiosera|first8=C.|last9=Richards|first9=S.

This made them less able to cope with new diseases. The change in genetic makeup is measured by scientists to have occurred around 175 years ago, during a time when the smallpox epidemic was ranging through the Americas.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Evolutionary biology}}\n{{Commons category|Genetic studies of indigenous populations of the Americas}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Archaeogenetics]]\n* [[Archaeogenetics of the Near East]]\n* [[Archaeology of the Americas]]\n* [[Ancient DNA]]\n* [[Clovis culture]]\n* [[Early human migrations]]\n* [[Genetic history of Africa (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Genetic history of Europe]]\n* [[Genetic history of Italy]]\n* [[Genetic history of Mexico]]\n* [[Genetic history of North Africa]]\n* [[Genetic history of the British Isles]]\n* [[Genetic history of the Iberian Peninsula]]\n* [[Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia]]\n* [[Template:Human timeline|Human timeline]]\n* [[Template:Life timeline|Life timeline]]\n* [[List of haplogroups of historical and famous figures|Haplogroups of historical and famous figures]]\n* [[Template:Nature timeline|Nature timeline]]\n* [[Race and genetics]]\n* [[Y-chromosome haplogroups in populations of the world]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{clear right}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|author=Peter N.
