The results led to UKIP heavily targeting the area at the general election the following year, but this came with little success and they would only gain one council seat in 2015, whilst coming third in both the Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes constituencies.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats were seen to have had some comfort in holding two of their defensive seats (East Marsh and Park), considering they lost all their defensive seats at the last elections in 2012 and only won one in 2011, but with their failure to regain Yarborough after their remaining councillor defected to Labour, they had their lowest number of councillors on the authority since its creation.\n\n==Ward results==\n\n===Croft Baker===\n\n{{Election box begin |title=Croft Baker 2014}}\n\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Labour Party (UK)\n   |candidate  = Matthew Jason Brown\n   |votes      = 1031\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = UK Independence Party\n   |candidate  = Christopher James Osborne\n   |votes      = 885\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Independent (politician)\n   |candidate  = Leanor Mary Pidgen\n   |votes      = 424\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Conservative Party (UK)\n   |candidate  = Debbie Landymore\n   |votes      = 352\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition\n   |candidate  = Roy Thomas Crampton\n   |votes      = 104\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Liberal Democrats (UK)\n   |candidate  = Sarah Elaine Hughes\n   |votes      = 61\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box majority|\n  |votes = 146\t|percentage = \t|change = }}\n{{Election box hold with party link\n  | winner     = Labour Party (UK)\n  | swing      =}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\nNote: Pidgen was a former Liberal Democrat councillor that represented this ward from 2003 to 2012.\n\n===East Marsh===\n\n{{Election box begin |title=East Marsh 2014}}\n\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Liberal Democrats (UK)\n   |candidate  = Stephen Beasant\n   |votes      = 907\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = UK Independence Party\n   |candidate  = Phillip John Dumbrell\n   |votes      = 422\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Labour Party (UK)\n   |candidate  = Annie Darby\n   |votes      = 369\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Green Party of England and Wales\n   |candidate  = Andrew Dickson\n   |votes      = 46\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition\n   |candidate  = Philip Martin Tuplin\n   |votes      = 22\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box majority|\n |votes = 485\t|percentage = \t|change = }}\n{{Election box hold with party link|\n  |winner     = Liberal Democrats (UK)\n  |swing      = }}\n{{Election box end}}\n\nNotes: Beasant was the only winning candidate to have achieved an outright majority of votes (ie: over 50% of the vote share).

The results led to UKIP heavily targeting the area at the general election the following year, but this came with little success and they would only gain one council seat in 2015, whilst coming third in both the Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes constituencies.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats were seen to have had some comfort in holding two of their defensive seats (East Marsh and Park), considering they lost all their defensive seats at the last elections in 2012 and only won one in 2011, but with their failure to regain Yarborough after their remaining councillor defected to Labour, they had their lowest number of councillors on the authority since its creation.\n\n==Ward results==\n\n===Croft Baker===\n\n{{Election box begin |title=Croft Baker 2014}}\n\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Labour Party (UK)\n   |candidate  = Matthew Jason Brown\n   |votes      = 1031\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = UK Independence Party\n   |candidate  = Christopher James Osborne\n   |votes      = 885\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Independent (politician)\n   |candidate  = Leanor Mary Pidgen\n   |votes      = 424\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Conservative Party (UK)\n   |candidate  = Debbie Landymore\n   |votes      = 352\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition\n   |candidate  = Roy Thomas Crampton\n   |votes      = 104\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Liberal Democrats (UK)\n   |candidate  = Sarah Elaine Hughes\n   |votes      = 61\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box majority|\n  |votes = 146\t|percentage = \t|change = }}\n{{Election box hold with party link\n  | winner     = Labour Party (UK)\n  | swing      =}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\nNote: Pidgen was a former Liberal Democrat councillor that represented this ward from 2003 to 2012.\n\n===East Marsh===\n\n{{Election box begin |title=East Marsh 2014}}\n\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Liberal Democrats (UK)\n   |candidate  = Stephen Beasant\n   |votes      = 907\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = UK Independence Party\n   |candidate  = Phillip John Dumbrell\n   |votes      = 422\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Labour Party (UK)\n   |candidate  = Annie Darby\n   |votes      = 369\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Green Party of England and Wales\n   |candidate  = Andrew Dickson\n   |votes      = 46\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition\n   |candidate  = Philip Martin Tuplin\n   |votes      = 22\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box majority|\n |votes = 485\t|percentage = \t|change = }}\n{{Election box hold with party link|\n  |winner     = Liberal Democrats (UK)\n  |swing      = }}\n{{Election box end}}\n\nNotes: Beasant was the only winning candidate to have achieved an outright majority of votes (ie: over 50% of the vote share).

Photo-voltaic cells use [[sunlight]] as a source of energy and generate direct current [[electricity]]. A collection of PV modules is called a PV Panel, and a system of Panels is an Array. Arrays of a [[photovoltaic system]] supply [[solar electricity]] to electrical equipment.\n\nThe most common application of solar energy collection outside agriculture is [[solar water heating]] systems.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/sd.1547 |title=Comparing Solar Water Heater Popularization Policies in China, Israel and Australia: The Roles of Governments in Adopting Green Innovations |journal=Sustainable Development |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=160\u201370 |year=2013 |last1=Li |first1=Wei |last2=Rubin |first2=Tzameret H |last3=Onyina |first3=Paul A }}</ref>\n\n== Theory and construction ==\n{{See also|Solar cell}}\n[[File:From a solar cell to a PV system.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|From a [[solar cell]] to a [[PV system]]]]\n\n[[Photovoltaic]] modules use light energy ([[photon]]s) from the Sun to generate electricity through the [[photovoltaic effect]]. Most modules use [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]-based [[crystalline silicon]] cells or [[Thin film solar cell|thin-film cells]]. The structural ([[Dead and live loads|load carrying]]) member of a module can be either the top layer or the back layer. Cells must be protected from mechanical damage and moisture. Most modules are rigid, but semi-flexible ones based on thin-film cells are also available. The cells are connected electrically in series, one to another to a desired voltage, and then in parallel to increase amperage. The wattage of the module is the mathematical product of the voltage and the amperage of the module.\n\nA PV [[junction box]] is attached to the back of the solar panel and functions as its output interface. External connections for most photovoltaic modules use [[MC4 connector]]s to facilitate easy weatherproof connections to the rest of the system. A USB power interface can also be used.\n\nModule electrical connections are made [[Series circuits|in series]] to achieve a desired output voltage or [[Parallel circuits|in parallel]] to provide a desired current capability (amperes) of the solar panel or the PV system. The conducting wires that take the current off the modules are sized according to the ampacity and may contain silver, copper or other non-magnetic conductive transition metals. Bypass [[diode]]s may be incorporated or used externally, in case of partial module shading, to maximize the output of module sections still illuminated.\n\nSome special solar PV modules include [[Solar concentrator|concentrators]] in which light is focused by [[lens (optics)|lenses]] or mirrors onto smaller cells. This enables the use of cells with a high cost per unit area (such as [[gallium arsenide]]) in a cost-effective way. \n\nSolar panels also use metal frames consisting of racking components, brackets, reflector shapes, and troughs to better support the panel structure.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanindust.com/solar-panel-metal-stamping|title=Metal Stamped Parts for Solar Paneling {{!}} American Industrial|work=American Industrial|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Solar cell#History|Timeline of solar cells}}\n\nIn 1839, the ability of some materials to create an electrical charge from light exposure was first observed by [[Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Though the premiere solar panels were too inefficient for even simple electric devices they were used as an instrument to measure light.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.energymatters.com.au/panels-modules/ |title= The history of the invention of the solar panel summary. |accessdate=25 January 2019 |website=Engergymatters.com|first1=M |last1=Christian|publisher=Energymatters.com}}</ref> The observation by Becquerel was not replicated again until 1873, when [[Willoughby Smith]] discovered that the charge could be caused by light hitting selenium.

Hence, much of the incident [[sunlight]] energy is wasted by solar modules, and they can give far higher efficiencies if illuminated with [[monochromatic]] light. Therefore, another design concept is to split the light into six to eight different wavelength ranges that will produce a different color of light, and direct the beams onto different cells tuned to those ranges.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/513671/ultra-efficient-solar-power/|title=Managing Light To Increase Solar Efficiency|last=Orcutt|first=Mike|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}</ref> This has been projected to be capable of raising efficiency by 50%. \n\nA single solar module can produce only a limited amount of power; most installations contain multiple modules adding voltages or current to the wiring and PV system.

The [[Light scattering|scattered]] [[light]] then travels along a longer path in the semiconductor, absorbing more photons to be converted into current. Although these nanocylinders have been used previously (aluminum was preceded by [[gold]] and [[silver]]), the light scattering occurred in the near infrared region and visible light was absorbed strongly. Aluminum was found to have absorbed the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, while the visible and near infrared parts of the spectrum were found to be scattered by the aluminum surface. This, the research argued, could bring down the cost significantly and improve the efficiency as aluminum is more abundant and less costly than gold and silver. The research also noted that the increase in current makes thinner film solar panels technically feasible without \"compromising power conversion efficiencies, thus reducing material consumption\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/improving-the-efficiency-of-solar-panels/article5265330.ece |title=Improving the efficiency of solar panels |publisher=The Hindu |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>\n* Solar panel efficiency can be calculated by MPP (maximum power point) value of solar panels.\n* [[Solar inverter]]s convert the DC power to [[Alternating current|AC]] power by performing [[maximum power point tracking|the process of maximum power point tracking]] (MPPT): solar inverter samples the output Power (I-V curve) from the solar cell and applies the proper resistance (load) to solar cells to obtain maximum power.\n* MPP (Maximum power point) of the solar panel consists of MPP voltage (V mpp) and MPP current (I mpp): it is a capacity of the solar panel and the higher value can make higher MPP.\n\nMicro-inverted solar panels are wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]], which produces more output than normal panels wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]], with the output of the series determined by the lowest performing panel.

In 2013, crystalline silicon accounted for more than 90 percent of worldwide PV production, while the rest of the overall market is made up of [[thin film solar cells|thin-film technologies]] using [[CdTe PV|cadmium telluride]], [[CIGS panel|CIGS]] and [[amorphous silicon]]<ref>[http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf Photovoltaics Report, Fraunhofer ISE, 28 July 2014], pages 18,19</ref> \n\nEmerging, [[Thin film solar cell#Emerging photovoltaics|third generation]] solar technologies use advanced thin-film cells. They produce a relatively high-efficiency conversion for the low cost compared to other solar technologies. Also, high-cost, high-efficiency, and close-packed rectangular [[multi-junction solar cell|multi-junction (MJ) cell]]s are preferably used in [[solar panels on spacecraft]], as they offer the highest ratio of generated power per kilogram lifted into space. MJ-cells are [[compound semiconductor]]s and made of [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) and other semiconductor materials. Another emerging PV technology using MJ-cells is [[concentrator photovoltaics]] ( CPV ).\n\n=== Thin film ===\nIn rigid [[thin-film module]]s, the cell and the module are manufactured in the same production line. The cell is created on a glass [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] or superstrate, and the electrical connections are created ''in situ'', a so-called \"monolithic integration\". The substrate or superstrate is laminated with an encapsulant to a front or back [[wikt:sheet|sheet]], usually another sheet of glass. The main cell technologies in this category are [[Cadmium telluride|CdTe]], or [[amorphous silicon|a-Si]], or [[micromorphous silicon|a-Si+uc-Si tandem]], or [[Copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS]] (or variant). Amorphous silicon has a sunlight conversion rate of 6\u201312%\n\nFlexible thin film cells and modules are created on the same production line by depositing the [[photoactive layer]] and other necessary layers on a [[flexible substrate]]. If the substrate is an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] (e.g. [[polyester]] or [[polyimide]] film) then [[Die (integrated circuit)|monolithic]] integration can be used. If it is a conductor then another technique for electrical connection must be used. The cells are assembled into modules by [[laminating]] them to a transparent colourless [[fluoropolymer]] on the front side (typically [[ETFE]] or [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene|FEP]]) and a polymer suitable for bonding to the final substrate on the other side.\n\n== Smart solar modules ==\n{{main article|Smart module|Solar micro-inverter}}\n\nSeveral companies have begun embedding electronics into PV modules. This enables performing MPPT for each module individually, and the measurement of performance data for monitoring and fault detection at module level. Some of these solutions make use of [[power optimizer]]s, a DC-to-DC converter technology developed to maximize the power harvest from solar photovoltaic systems. As of about 2010, such electronics can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to fall to zero, but not having the output of the entire module fall to zero.\n\n== Performance and degradation ==\n{{original research|section|date=August 2013}}\n\n[[File:Actual output in volts, amps, and wattage from a 100 Watt Solar module in August.jpg|thumb]]\n\nModule performance is generally rated under standard test conditions (STC): [[irradiance]] of 1,000 [[W/m2|W/m<sup>2</sup>]], solar [[spectrum]] of [[Airmass|AM]] 1.5 and module temperature at 25\u00b0C. The actual voltage and current output of the module changes as lighting, temperature and load conditions change, so there is never one specific voltage, current, or wattage at which the module operates. Performance varies depending on time of day, amount of solar insolation, direction and tilt of modules, cloud cover, shading, state of charge, temperature, geographic location, and day of the year. The fluctuations in voltage and current can be logged with multimeter or data logger.\n\nFor optimum performance a solar panel needs to be made of similar modules oriented in the same direction perpendicular towards direct sunlight. The path of the sun varies by latitude and day of the year and can be studied using a sundial or a sunchart and tracked using a solar tracker. Differences in voltage or current of modules may affect the overall performance of a panel. Bypass diodes are used to circumvent broken or shaded panels to optimize output. \n\nElectrical characteristics include nominal power (P<sub>MAX</sub>, measured in [[watt|W]]), [[open circuit voltage]] (V<sub>OC</sub>), [[short circuit current]] (I<sub>SC</sub>, measured in [[ampere]]s), maximum power voltage (V<sub>MPP</sub>), maximum power current (I<sub>MPP</sub>), peak power, ([[watt-peak]], W<sub>p</sub>), and module efficiency (%).\n\nNominal voltage<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofengineering.com/definition/nominal-voltage.html|title=nominal voltage Definition and Meaning|website=www.dictionaryofengineering.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref> refers to the voltage of the battery that the module is best suited to charge; this is a leftover term from the days when solar modules were only used to charge batteries. Nominal voltage allows users, at a glance, to make sure the module is compatible with a given system.\n\nOpen circuit voltage or V<sub>OC</sub> is the maximum voltage that the module can produce when not connected to an electrical circuit or system. V<sub>OC</sub> can be measured with a [[voltmeter]] directly on an illuminated module's terminals or on its disconnected cable.\n\nThe peak power rating, W<sub>p</sub>, is the maximum output under standard test conditions (not the maximum possible output). Typical modules, which could measure approximately {{convert|1|x|2|m|ft|sigfig=1}}, will be rated from as low as 75 W to as high as 350 W, depending on their efficiency. At the time of testing, the test modules are binned according to their test results, and a typical manufacturer might rate their modules in 5 W increments, and either rate them at +/- 3%, +/-5%, +3/-0% or +5/-0%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixsolar-group.com/dms/produkte/module/pdf/en/FirstSolar_PD-5-401-03-Global-Series-3-Datasheet/PD-5-401-03%20Global%20Series%203%20Datasheet.pdf  |title=First Solar \u2013 FS-377 / FS-380 / FS-382 / FS-385 Datasheet |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |title=TSM PC/PM14 Datasheet |accessdate=2012-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200512/http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lubisolar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Poly-260-275W.pdf |title=LBS Poly 260 275 Data sheet |date= |accessdate=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n\nThe ability of solar modules to withstand damage by rain, [[hail]], heavy snow load, and cycles of heat and cold varies by manufacturer, although most solar panels on the U.S. market are UL listed, meaning they have gone through testing to withstand hail.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://energyinformative.org/solar-panels-weather/|title=Are Solar Panels Affected by Weather? - Energy Informative|work=Energy Informative|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref> Many [[crystalline silicon]] module manufacturers offer a [[Warranty#Defects_In_Materials_and_Workmanship|limited warranty]] that guarantees electrical production for 10 years at 90% of rated power output and 25 years at 80%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cti-solar.com/userfiles/file/brochlet%20CTI-SOLAR%20vers%20EN.pdf |title=CTI Solar sales brochure |work=cti-solar.com |accessdate=3 September 2010}}</ref> \n\n[[Potential induced degradation]] (also called PID) is a potential induced performance degradation in crystalline photovoltaic modules, caused by so-called stray currents. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.solarplaza.com/channels/asset-management/11674/potential-induced-degradation-combatting-phantom-menace/|title=Solarplaza Potential Induced Degradation: Combatting a Phantom Menace|website=www.solarplaza.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>This effect may cause power loss of up to 30%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eicero.com/what-is-pid|title=What is PID? \u2014 eicero|last=(www.inspire.cz)|first=INSPIRE CZ s.r.o.|website=eicero.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>\n\nThe largest challenge for [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] technology is said to be the purchase price per watt of electricity produced. New materials and manufacturing techniques continue to improve the price to power performance. The problem resides in the enormous activation energy that must be overcome for a photon to excite an electron for harvesting purposes. Advancements in photovoltaic technologies have brought about the process of \"doping\" the silicon substrate to lower the activation energy thereby making the panel more efficient in converting photons to retrievable electrons.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Solar Cells Work |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/solar-cell2.htm |website=HowStuffWorks |date=April 2000 |accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> \n\nChemicals such as [[boron]] (p-type) are applied into the semiconductor crystal in order to create donor and acceptor energy levels substantially closer to the valence and conductor [http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/section_16/6520efadc9fafd08d3043572e61e9765.jpg bands].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bonding in Metals and Semiconductors |url=http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/s16-06-bonding-in-metals-and-semicond.html |website=2012books.lardbucket.org|accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> In doing so, the addition of boron impurity allows the activation energy to decrease 20 fold from 1.12 eV to 0.05 eV. Since the potential difference (E<sub>B</sub>) is so low, the boron is able to thermally ionize at room temperatures. This allows for free energy carriers in the conduction and valence bands thereby allowing greater conversion of photons to electrons.\n\n== Maintenance ==\nSolar panel conversion efficiency, typically in the 20% range, is reduced by dust, grime, pollen, and other particulates that accumulate on the solar panel. \"A dirty solar panel can reduce its power capabilities by up to 30% in high dust/pollen or desert areas\", says Seamus Curran, associate professor of physics at the University of Houston and director of the Institute for NanoEnergy, which specializes in the design, engineering, and assembly of nanostructures.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/self-cleaning-solar-panels-maximize-efficiency |title=Self-Cleaning Solar Panels Maximize Efficiency |date=October 2012 |accessdate=15 September 2014 |website=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers |publisher=ASME |last=Crawford |first=Mike}}</ref>\n\nPaying to have solar panels cleaned is often not a good investment; researchers found panels that had not been cleaned, or rained on, for 145 days during a summer drought in California, lost only 7.4% of their efficiency.

It can first be used in agriculture as a power source for irrigation. In health care solar panels can be used to refrigerate medical supplies. It can also be used for infrastructure. PV modules are used in [[photovoltaic system]]s and include a [[Photovoltaic system#Other systems|large variety of electric devices]]:\n* [[Photovoltaic power station]]s\n* [[Rooftop solar PV]] systems\n* [[PV system#Standalone|Standalone PV systems]]\n* [[Solar hybrid power systems]]\n* [[Concentrated photovoltaics]]\n* [[Solar plane]]s\n*[[Solar-powered water purification in rural Africa|Solar-powered water purification]]\n* [[Solar-pumped laser]]s\n* [[Solar vehicle]]s\n* [[Solar panels on spacecraft]]s and [[space station]]s\n\n== Limitations ==\n\n=== Pollution and energy in production ===\nSolar panel has been a well-known method of generating clean, emission free electricity. However, it produces only direct current electricity (DC), which is not what normal appliances use. Solar photovoltaic systems (solar PV systems) are often made of solar PV panels (modules) and inverter (changing DC to AC). Solar PV panels are mainly made of solar photovoltaic cells, which has no fundamental difference to the material for making computer chips{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. The process of producing solar PV cells (computer chips) is energy intensive and involves highly poisonous and environmental toxic chemicals{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. There are few solar PV manufacturing plants around the world producing PV modules with energy produced from PV{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. This measure greatly reduces the carbon footprint during the manufacturing process{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. Managing the chemicals used in the manufacturing process is subject to the factories' local laws and regulations{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}.\n\n=== Impact on electricity network ===\nWith the increasing levels of rooftop photovoltaic systems, the energy flow becomes 2-way. When there is more local generation than consumption, electricity is exported to the grid. However, an electricity network traditionally is not designed to deal with the 2- way energy transfer. Therefore, some technical issues may occur. For example, in Queensland Australia, more than 30% of households used rooftop PV by the end of 2017. The famous Californian 2020 [[duck curve]] appeared often for a lot of communities from 2015 onwards. An over-voltage issue may result as the electricity flows from  PV households back to the network.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Wendy |last2=Liu |first2=Aaron |last3=Amin |first3=Zakaria |last4=Wagner |first4=Andreas |title=Power Quality and Rooftop-Photovoltaic Households: An Examination of Measured Data at Point of Customer Connection |journal=Sustainability |volume=10 |issue=4 |year=2018 |pages=1224 |doi=10.3390/su10041224 |url=https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000082198/7829299 |doi-access=free }}</ref> There are solutions to manage the over voltage issue, such as regulating PV inverter power factor, new voltage and energy control equipment at the electricity distributor level, re-conducting the electricity wires, demand side management, etc. There are often limitations and costs related to these solutions.\n\nWhen electric networks are down, such as during the October [[2019 California power shutoff]], solar panels are often insufficient to fully provide power to a house or other structure, because they are designed to supply power to the grid, not directly to homes. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Martin |first1=Chris |title=Californians Learning That Solar Panels Don't Work in Blackouts |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-10/californians-learning-that-solar-panels-don-t-work-in-blackouts |work=Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomberg LP |date=10 October 2019 |location=New York NY}}</ref>\n\n=== Implication onto electricity bill management and energy investment ===\nThere is no silver bullet in electricity or energy demand and bill management, because customers (sites) have different specific situations, e.g. different comfort/convenience needs, different electricity tariffs, or different usage patterns. Electricity tariff may have a few elements, such as daily access and metering charge, energy charge (based on kWh, MWh) or peak demand charge (e.g. a price for the highest 30min energy consumption in a month). PV is a promising option for reducing energy charge when electricity price is reasonably high and continuously increasing, such as in Australia and Germany. However, for sites with peak demand charge in place, PV may be less attractive if peak demands mostly occur in the late afternoon to early evening, for example residential communities. Overall, energy investment is largely an economical decision and it is better to make investment decisions based on systematical evaluation of options in operational improvement, energy efficiency, onsite generation and energy storage.<ref>L.

The structural ([[Dead and live loads|load carrying]]) member of a module can be either the top layer or the back layer. Cells must be protected from mechanical damage and moisture. Most modules are rigid, but semi-flexible ones based on thin-film cells are also available. The cells are connected electrically in series, one to another to a desired voltage, and then in parallel to increase amperage. The wattage of the module is the mathematical product of the voltage and the amperage of the module.\n\nA PV [[junction box]] is attached to the back of the solar panel and functions as its output interface. External connections for most photovoltaic modules use [[MC4 connector]]s to facilitate easy weatherproof connections to the rest of the system. A USB power interface can also be used.\n\nModule electrical connections are made [[Series circuits|in series]] to achieve a desired output voltage or [[Parallel circuits|in parallel]] to provide a desired current capability (amperes) of the solar panel or the PV system. The conducting wires that take the current off the modules are sized according to the ampacity and may contain silver, copper or other non-magnetic conductive transition metals.

Hence, much of the incident [[sunlight]] energy is wasted by solar modules, and they can give far higher efficiencies if illuminated with [[monochromatic]] light. Therefore, another design concept is to split the light into six to eight different wavelength ranges that will produce a different color of light, and direct the beams onto different cells tuned to those ranges.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/513671/ultra-efficient-solar-power/|title=Managing Light To Increase Solar Efficiency|last=Orcutt|first=Mike|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}</ref> This has been projected to be capable of raising efficiency by 50%. \n\nA single solar module can produce only a limited amount of power; most installations contain multiple modules adding voltages or current to the wiring and PV system. A photovoltaic system typically includes an array of photovoltaic modules, an [[Power inverter|inverter]], a [[battery (electricity)|battery pack]] for energy storage, charge controller, interconnection wiring, circuit breakers, fuses, disconnect switches, voltage meters, and optionally a [[solar tracker|solar tracking]] mechanism. Equipment is carefully selected to optimize output, energy storage, reduce power loss during power transmission, and conversion from direct current to alternating current. \n\nScientists from Spectrolab, a subsidiary of [[Boeing]], have reported development of [[multi-junction solar cell]]s with an efficiency of more than 40%, a new world record for solar photovoltaic cells.<ref>KING, R.R., et al., Appl.

The [[Light scattering|scattered]] [[light]] then travels along a longer path in the semiconductor, absorbing more photons to be converted into current. Although these nanocylinders have been used previously (aluminum was preceded by [[gold]] and [[silver]]), the light scattering occurred in the near infrared region and visible light was absorbed strongly. Aluminum was found to have absorbed the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, while the visible and near infrared parts of the spectrum were found to be scattered by the aluminum surface. This, the research argued, could bring down the cost significantly and improve the efficiency as aluminum is more abundant and less costly than gold and silver. The research also noted that the increase in current makes thinner film solar panels technically feasible without \"compromising power conversion efficiencies, thus reducing material consumption\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/improving-the-efficiency-of-solar-panels/article5265330.ece |title=Improving the efficiency of solar panels |publisher=The Hindu |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>\n* Solar panel efficiency can be calculated by MPP (maximum power point) value of solar panels.\n* [[Solar inverter]]s convert the DC power to [[Alternating current|AC]] power by performing [[maximum power point tracking|the process of maximum power point tracking]] (MPPT): solar inverter samples the output Power (I-V curve) from the solar cell and applies the proper resistance (load) to solar cells to obtain maximum power.\n* MPP (Maximum power point) of the solar panel consists of MPP voltage (V mpp) and MPP current (I mpp): it is a capacity of the solar panel and the higher value can make higher MPP.\n\nMicro-inverted solar panels are wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]], which produces more output than normal panels wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]], with the output of the series determined by the lowest performing panel. This is known as the \"Christmas light effect\".

In 2013, crystalline silicon accounted for more than 90 percent of worldwide PV production, while the rest of the overall market is made up of [[thin film solar cells|thin-film technologies]] using [[CdTe PV|cadmium telluride]], [[CIGS panel|CIGS]] and [[amorphous silicon]]<ref>[http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf Photovoltaics Report, Fraunhofer ISE, 28 July 2014], pages 18,19</ref> \n\nEmerging, [[Thin film solar cell#Emerging photovoltaics|third generation]] solar technologies use advanced thin-film cells. They produce a relatively high-efficiency conversion for the low cost compared to other solar technologies. Also, high-cost, high-efficiency, and close-packed rectangular [[multi-junction solar cell|multi-junction (MJ) cell]]s are preferably used in [[solar panels on spacecraft]], as they offer the highest ratio of generated power per kilogram lifted into space. MJ-cells are [[compound semiconductor]]s and made of [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) and other semiconductor materials. Another emerging PV technology using MJ-cells is [[concentrator photovoltaics]] ( CPV ).\n\n=== Thin film ===\nIn rigid [[thin-film module]]s, the cell and the module are manufactured in the same production line. The cell is created on a glass [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] or superstrate, and the electrical connections are created ''in situ'', a so-called \"monolithic integration\". The substrate or superstrate is laminated with an encapsulant to a front or back [[wikt:sheet|sheet]], usually another sheet of glass. The main cell technologies in this category are [[Cadmium telluride|CdTe]], or [[amorphous silicon|a-Si]], or [[micromorphous silicon|a-Si+uc-Si tandem]], or [[Copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS]] (or variant). Amorphous silicon has a sunlight conversion rate of 6\u201312%\n\nFlexible thin film cells and modules are created on the same production line by depositing the [[photoactive layer]] and other necessary layers on a [[flexible substrate]]. If the substrate is an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] (e.g. [[polyester]] or [[polyimide]] film) then [[Die (integrated circuit)|monolithic]] integration can be used. If it is a conductor then another technique for electrical connection must be used. The cells are assembled into modules by [[laminating]] them to a transparent colourless [[fluoropolymer]] on the front side (typically [[ETFE]] or [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene|FEP]]) and a polymer suitable for bonding to the final substrate on the other side.\n\n== Smart solar modules ==\n{{main article|Smart module|Solar micro-inverter}}\n\nSeveral companies have begun embedding electronics into PV modules. This enables performing MPPT for each module individually, and the measurement of performance data for monitoring and fault detection at module level. Some of these solutions make use of [[power optimizer]]s, a DC-to-DC converter technology developed to maximize the power harvest from solar photovoltaic systems. As of about 2010, such electronics can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to fall to zero, but not having the output of the entire module fall to zero.\n\n== Performance and degradation ==\n{{original research|section|date=August 2013}}\n\n[[File:Actual output in volts, amps, and wattage from a 100 Watt Solar module in August.jpg|thumb]]\n\nModule performance is generally rated under standard test conditions (STC): [[irradiance]] of 1,000 [[W/m2|W/m<sup>2</sup>]], solar [[spectrum]] of [[Airmass|AM]] 1.5 and module temperature at 25\u00b0C. The actual voltage and current output of the module changes as lighting, temperature and load conditions change, so there is never one specific voltage, current, or wattage at which the module operates. Performance varies depending on time of day, amount of solar insolation, direction and tilt of modules, cloud cover, shading, state of charge, temperature, geographic location, and day of the year. The fluctuations in voltage and current can be logged with multimeter or data logger.\n\nFor optimum performance a solar panel needs to be made of similar modules oriented in the same direction perpendicular towards direct sunlight. The path of the sun varies by latitude and day of the year and can be studied using a sundial or a sunchart and tracked using a solar tracker. Differences in voltage or current of modules may affect the overall performance of a panel. Bypass diodes are used to circumvent broken or shaded panels to optimize output. \n\nElectrical characteristics include nominal power (P<sub>MAX</sub>, measured in [[watt|W]]), [[open circuit voltage]] (V<sub>OC</sub>), [[short circuit current]] (I<sub>SC</sub>, measured in [[ampere]]s), maximum power voltage (V<sub>MPP</sub>), maximum power current (I<sub>MPP</sub>), peak power, ([[watt-peak]], W<sub>p</sub>), and module efficiency (%).\n\nNominal voltage<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofengineering.com/definition/nominal-voltage.html|title=nominal voltage Definition and Meaning|website=www.dictionaryofengineering.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref> refers to the voltage of the battery that the module is best suited to charge; this is a leftover term from the days when solar modules were only used to charge batteries. Nominal voltage allows users, at a glance, to make sure the module is compatible with a given system.\n\nOpen circuit voltage or V<sub>OC</sub> is the maximum voltage that the module can produce when not connected to an electrical circuit or system. V<sub>OC</sub> can be measured with a [[voltmeter]] directly on an illuminated module's terminals or on its disconnected cable.\n\nThe peak power rating, W<sub>p</sub>, is the maximum output under standard test conditions (not the maximum possible output). Typical modules, which could measure approximately {{convert|1|x|2|m|ft|sigfig=1}}, will be rated from as low as 75 W to as high as 350 W, depending on their efficiency. At the time of testing, the test modules are binned according to their test results, and a typical manufacturer might rate their modules in 5 W increments, and either rate them at +/- 3%, +/-5%, +3/-0% or +5/-0%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixsolar-group.com/dms/produkte/module/pdf/en/FirstSolar_PD-5-401-03-Global-Series-3-Datasheet/PD-5-401-03%20Global%20Series%203%20Datasheet.pdf  |title=First Solar \u2013 FS-377 / FS-380 / FS-382 / FS-385 Datasheet |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |title=TSM PC/PM14 Datasheet |accessdate=2012-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200512/http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lubisolar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Poly-260-275W.pdf |title=LBS Poly 260 275 Data sheet |date= |accessdate=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n\nThe ability of solar modules to withstand damage by rain, [[hail]], heavy snow load, and cycles of heat and cold varies by manufacturer, although most solar panels on the U.S. market are UL listed, meaning they have gone through testing to withstand hail.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://energyinformative.org/solar-panels-weather/|title=Are Solar Panels Affected by Weather? - Energy Informative|work=Energy Informative|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref> Many [[crystalline silicon]] module manufacturers offer a [[Warranty#Defects_In_Materials_and_Workmanship|limited warranty]] that guarantees electrical production for 10 years at 90% of rated power output and 25 years at 80%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cti-solar.com/userfiles/file/brochlet%20CTI-SOLAR%20vers%20EN.pdf |title=CTI Solar sales brochure |work=cti-solar.com |accessdate=3 September 2010}}</ref> \n\n[[Potential induced degradation]] (also called PID) is a potential induced performance degradation in crystalline photovoltaic modules, caused by so-called stray currents. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.solarplaza.com/channels/asset-management/11674/potential-induced-degradation-combatting-phantom-menace/|title=Solarplaza Potential Induced Degradation: Combatting a Phantom Menace|website=www.solarplaza.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>This effect may cause power loss of up to 30%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eicero.com/what-is-pid|title=What is PID? \u2014 eicero|last=(www.inspire.cz)|first=INSPIRE CZ s.r.o.|website=eicero.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>\n\nThe largest challenge for [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] technology is said to be the purchase price per watt of electricity produced. New materials and manufacturing techniques continue to improve the price to power performance. The problem resides in the enormous activation energy that must be overcome for a photon to excite an electron for harvesting purposes. Advancements in photovoltaic technologies have brought about the process of \"doping\" the silicon substrate to lower the activation energy thereby making the panel more efficient in converting photons to retrievable electrons.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Solar Cells Work |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/solar-cell2.htm |website=HowStuffWorks |date=April 2000 |accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> \n\nChemicals such as [[boron]] (p-type) are applied into the semiconductor crystal in order to create donor and acceptor energy levels substantially closer to the valence and conductor [http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/section_16/6520efadc9fafd08d3043572e61e9765.jpg bands].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bonding in Metals and Semiconductors |url=http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/s16-06-bonding-in-metals-and-semicond.html |website=2012books.lardbucket.org|accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> In doing so, the addition of boron impurity allows the activation energy to decrease 20 fold from 1.12 eV to 0.05 eV. Since the potential difference (E<sub>B</sub>) is so low, the boron is able to thermally ionize at room temperatures. This allows for free energy carriers in the conduction and valence bands thereby allowing greater conversion of photons to electrons.\n\n== Maintenance ==\nSolar panel conversion efficiency, typically in the 20% range, is reduced by dust, grime, pollen, and other particulates that accumulate on the solar panel. \"A dirty solar panel can reduce its power capabilities by up to 30% in high dust/pollen or desert areas\", says Seamus Curran, associate professor of physics at the University of Houston and director of the Institute for NanoEnergy, which specializes in the design, engineering, and assembly of nanostructures.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/self-cleaning-solar-panels-maximize-efficiency |title=Self-Cleaning Solar Panels Maximize Efficiency |date=October 2012 |accessdate=15 September 2014 |website=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers |publisher=ASME |last=Crawford |first=Mike}}</ref>\n\nPaying to have solar panels cleaned is often not a good investment; researchers found panels that had not been cleaned, or rained on, for 145 days during a summer drought in California, lost only 7.4% of their efficiency. Overall, for a typical residential solar system of 5 kW, washing panels halfway through the summer would translate into a mere $20 gain in electricity production until the summer drought ends\u2014in about 2 \u00bd months.

Automotive solar panels may also include a [[car lighter]] and/or [[USB]] adapter.

It can first be used in agriculture as a power source for irrigation. In health care solar panels can be used to refrigerate medical supplies. It can also be used for infrastructure. PV modules are used in [[photovoltaic system]]s and include a [[Photovoltaic system#Other systems|large variety of electric devices]]:\n* [[Photovoltaic power station]]s\n* [[Rooftop solar PV]] systems\n* [[PV system#Standalone|Standalone PV systems]]\n* [[Solar hybrid power systems]]\n* [[Concentrated photovoltaics]]\n* [[Solar plane]]s\n*[[Solar-powered water purification in rural Africa|Solar-powered water purification]]\n* [[Solar-pumped laser]]s\n* [[Solar vehicle]]s\n* [[Solar panels on spacecraft]]s and [[space station]]s\n\n== Limitations ==\n\n=== Pollution and energy in production ===\nSolar panel has been a well-known method of generating clean, emission free electricity. However, it produces only direct current electricity (DC), which is not what normal appliances use. Solar photovoltaic systems (solar PV systems) are often made of solar PV panels (modules) and inverter (changing DC to AC). Solar PV panels are mainly made of solar photovoltaic cells, which has no fundamental difference to the material for making computer chips{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. The process of producing solar PV cells (computer chips) is energy intensive and involves highly poisonous and environmental toxic chemicals{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. There are few solar PV manufacturing plants around the world producing PV modules with energy produced from PV{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. This measure greatly reduces the carbon footprint during the manufacturing process{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. Managing the chemicals used in the manufacturing process is subject to the factories' local laws and regulations{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}.\n\n=== Impact on electricity network ===\nWith the increasing levels of rooftop photovoltaic systems, the energy flow becomes 2-way. When there is more local generation than consumption, electricity is exported to the grid. However, an electricity network traditionally is not designed to deal with the 2- way energy transfer. Therefore, some technical issues may occur. For example, in Queensland Australia, more than 30% of households used rooftop PV by the end of 2017. The famous Californian 2020 [[duck curve]] appeared often for a lot of communities from 2015 onwards. An over-voltage issue may result as the electricity flows from  PV households back to the network.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Wendy |last2=Liu |first2=Aaron |last3=Amin |first3=Zakaria |last4=Wagner |first4=Andreas |title=Power Quality and Rooftop-Photovoltaic Households: An Examination of Measured Data at Point of Customer Connection |journal=Sustainability |volume=10 |issue=4 |year=2018 |pages=1224 |doi=10.3390/su10041224 |url=https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000082198/7829299 |doi-access=free }}</ref> There are solutions to manage the over voltage issue, such as regulating PV inverter power factor, new voltage and energy control equipment at the electricity distributor level, re-conducting the electricity wires, demand side management, etc. There are often limitations and costs related to these solutions.\n\nWhen electric networks are down, such as during the October [[2019 California power shutoff]], solar panels are often insufficient to fully provide power to a house or other structure, because they are designed to supply power to the grid, not directly to homes. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Martin |first1=Chris |title=Californians Learning That Solar Panels Don't Work in Blackouts |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-10/californians-learning-that-solar-panels-don-t-work-in-blackouts |work=Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomberg LP |date=10 October 2019 |location=New York NY}}</ref>\n\n=== Implication onto electricity bill management and energy investment ===\nThere is no silver bullet in electricity or energy demand and bill management, because customers (sites) have different specific situations, e.g. different comfort/convenience needs, different electricity tariffs, or different usage patterns. Electricity tariff may have a few elements, such as daily access and metering charge, energy charge (based on kWh, MWh) or peak demand charge (e.g. a price for the highest 30min energy consumption in a month). PV is a promising option for reducing energy charge when electricity price is reasonably high and continuously increasing, such as in Australia and Germany. However, for sites with peak demand charge in place, PV may be less attractive if peak demands mostly occur in the late afternoon to early evening, for example residential communities. Overall, energy investment is largely an economical decision and it is better to make investment decisions based on systematical evaluation of options in operational improvement, energy efficiency, onsite generation and energy storage.<ref>L.

The militsiya was reaffirmed on October 28 (November 10, according to the [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|new style dating]]), 1917 under the official name of the Workers' and Peasants' Militsiya, in further contrast to what the Bolsheviks called the \"[[bourgeois]] class protecting\" police.  Eventually, it was replaced by the [[MVD|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (Russian: \u041c\u0412\u0414, ''MVD''; Ukrainian: \u041c\u0412\u0421, ''MVS''; Belorussian: \u041c\u0423\u0421, ''MUS''), which is now the official full name for the militsiya forces in the respective countries. Its regional branches are officially called Departments of Internal Affairs\u2014city department of internal affairs, ''[[raion]]'' department of internal affairs, ''[[oblast]]'' department of internal affairs, etc. The Russian term for a ''raion'' department is OVD (\u041e\u0412\u0414; \u041e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b/\u041e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043b, ''Otdel/Otdeleniye vnutrennikh del''), for region department is UVD (\u0423\u0412\u0414; \u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043b, ''Upravleniye vnutrennikh del'') or, sometimes, GUVD (\u0413\u0423\u0412\u0414; \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043b, ''Glavnoye upravleniye vnutrennikh del''), same for national republics is MVD, (\u041c\u0412\u0414; \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043b, ''Ministerstvo vnutrennikh del'').\n[[File:1982 Dacia 1310 (police car) in Bucharest.jpg|thumb|Romanian ''mili\u021bia'' car in the typical livery it featured starting with the early 1970s.

Their functions and organisation differ significantly from similarly named departments in Western countries, which are usually civil executive bodies headed by politicians and responsible for many other tasks as well as the supervision of law enforcement. The Soviet and successor MVDs have usually been headed by a militsiya general and predominantly consist of service personnel, with civilian employees only filling auxiliary posts. Although such ministers are members of their respective countries' cabinet, they usually do not report to the prime minister and parliament, but only to the president. Local militsiya departments are subordinated to their regional departments, having little accountability before local authorities.\n\n[[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal affairs]] units within the militsiya itself are usually called \"internal security\" departments.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\nThe official names of particular militsiya bodies and services in post-Soviet countries are usually very complicated, hence the use of the short term militsiya. Laws usually refer to police just as militsiya.\n\nThe short term for a police officer (regardless of gender) is ''militsioner'' (Russian: ''\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0440'', Ukrainian: ''\u043ci\u043bi\u0446i\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0440''). Slang terms for ''militsioner'' include ''ment'' (plural: \u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b, ''menty'') and ''musor'' (plural: ''\u043c\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0430'', ''musora''). Although the latter word is offensive (it literally means \"trash\" or \"garbage\"), it originated from an acronym for the Moscow Criminal Investigations Department (\u041c\u0423\u0421, short for \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0443\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u044b\u0441\u043a) in [[Imperial Russia]]. ''Ment'' is a close equivalent to the English slang term \"cop\" and has derived from the [[Lw\u00f3w dialect]].<ref>Kosmolinska, Natalka and Yuri Oxrimenko. \"[http://www.ji.lviv.ua/n36-1texts/kosmolinska.htm Homo leopolensis esse].\" No. 36, 2004.</ref>\n\n[[File:Countries with militsiya map.svg|thumb|{{legend|blue|Countries in which civilian police was once called ''militsiya''}}\n{{legend|darkblue|Countries in which civilian police is now called ''militsiya''}}]]\n\nThe following countries have changed the name of the police force from Militsiya to Police western-style name: [[Bulgaria]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Estonia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Moldova]], [[Latvia]], [[Mongolia]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]],\n[[Slovenia]] [[Kazakhstan]], [[Armenia]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]].\n\nThe police are still called ''Militsiya'' in [[Belarus]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], as well as in unrecognized republics of [[Abkhazia]], [[South Ossetia]] and [[Transnistria]] but in Kyrgyzstan there is an active discussion about renaming the police force from ''Militsiya'' to ''Police''.\n\n==General overview==\n[[File:VAZ-2106 police car in Yerevan, Armenia.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Lada Riva|Lada 2106]] belonging to the Armenian State Automobile Inspection parked on a street in [[Yerevan]], June 2007.]]\n[[File:Gai radar.jpg|thumb|250px|A Russian [[GAI]] inspector with a [[radar gun]] on the side of [[MKAD]]]]\nThe organizational structure, methods and traditions of the militsiya differ significantly from those of western police. Militsiya as an organisation consists of many functional departments, such as the [[GAI|GIBDD]], a traffic police. [[Organised crime]] detectives form highly independent squads inside regional militsiya. Some units may have the distinctive names (like [[OMON]] in Russia) which are more specific than ''militsiya'' or ''militsioner''.\n\nMilitsiya personnel ranks mostly follow those of the Army \u2013 from [[Private (rank)|private]] (Rus: ''ryadovoy''), which is the lowest rank, to [[colonel general]] \u2013 with only these exceptions: there are no ranks of [[Gefreiter|Yefreytor]], [[Army general (Russia)|Army General]], or [[Marshal of the Russian Federation|Marshal]]. Detectives (Russian: ''operativnik'' short for ''operativniy rabotnik'') hold a rank of lieutenant at least and could be promoted to major or the [[lieutenant colonel]]. The militsiya of an [[oblast]] (or other equivalent [[subnational entity]]) is usually headed by a general. The rank name is suffixed with ''of militsiya'' (e.g. ''major of militsiya'' for a major). Militsiya personnel carry [[firearm]]s, but are not permitted to carry their weapons when they are off duty.\n\nUnlike in some other countries' police agencies, militsioners are not assigned permanent partners, but work alone or within larger groups. Neither uniformed officers nor detectives are allowed to drive police vehicles themselves,{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} so a specialist driver (either a serviceman or a civil employee) is assigned to each car and is also in charge of its maintenance. Under the Patrol Police Service Regulations a designated police officer-driver is required to have a driver licence and is not allowed to abandon the vehicle.<ref>Patrol police service regulations by the Order of the MVD of Russia No. 80 dated 29 January 2008, art. 158 http://base.garant.ru/12159440/</ref> However, this refers only to fully marked police vehicles with emergency lights; detectives are allowed to drive civilian cars with are registered to the MVD, having white number plates (marked police vehicles have blue plates) with specific series (for example, ''o...vo'', ''o...rr'', ''o...mm'', ''o...om''). The last two are usually assigned to the vehicles registered to regional level MVD units. The law does not provide any preferences on the road nor allows emergency lights and/or sirens on such vehicles,<ref>Unmarked vehicles may only be equipped with emergency lights and sirens in accordance with the specific procedure set forth by the Decree of the President of Russia. http://base.garant.ru/70177358/</ref> therefore technically police officers do not have the right to violate traffic laws even while on an assignment. [[GAI|GIBDD]] (the traffic militsiya) is the only exception: its members drive their own (or even own private) cars and are specially trained in risk-driving.\n\nOne unique feature of militsiya policing approach is the system of territorial patronage over citizens. The cities, as well as the rural settlements are divided into ''uchastoks'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|pl. \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0438}}, ''\"quarters\"'') with a special ''uchastkovyi'' militsioner (\"quarter policeman\"), assigned to each. The main duty of ''uchastkovyi'' is to maintain close relations with the residents of his quarter and gather information among them. In particular, ''uchastkovyi'' should personally know each and every ex-convict, substance abuser, young hooligan etc. in given ''uchastok'', and visit them regularly for preemptive influence. ''Uchastkovyi'' is also responsible for tackling minor offences like family violence, loud noise, residential area parking etc. ''Uchastkovyi'' is also the main, and actually the real, militsiya force in remote areas and small settlements where permanent police departments are not created. ''Uchastkovyi'' militsioners possess separate small offices within their quarters and maintain citizens admittance in definite weekdays.\n\nThis system slightly resembles the US system of [[sheriff]]s but shows some notable differences. ''Uchastkovyi'' is neither a chief police officer in a given community nor a universal one (not combining detective, incarceration or special tactics tasks).\n\nThe system of ''uchastkovyis'' dates back to [[Russian Empire|imperial times]] when ''uriadniks'' were conducting lowest-level policing in rural areas. In Soviet Union, ''uchastkovyis'' were also responsible for such tasks as maintaining [[propiska in the Soviet Union|propiska]] limitations and overseeing former political prisoners, which were subject to daily registration at the local MVD office.\n\nAlthough women constitute a significant proportion of militsiya staff, they are usually not permitted to fill positions that carry risks (such as patrolman, guard, [[SWAT]]), but are allowed to carry firearms for self-defence. Instead, they are widely represented among investigators, juvenile crime inspectors, clerks, etc. However, limited attempts are being made to appoint women as traffic officers or ''operativniks''.\n\n===Conscripted police===\n{{further|Internal Troops|Internal Troops (Russia)}}\n[[File:CentVO Sokol.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Shoulder patch of Internal Troops, Moscow District]]\n[[File:Separate division operational use.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[ODON]] shoulder patch]]\n\nAnother unique militsiya feature is the use of [[Conscription|conscripted]] soldiers from the [[Internal Troops]] and special motorized militsiya units (''\u0421\u041c\u0427\u041c'', SMChM) for regular urban policing and for securing various mass events, which required more force employment than usual. The Internal Troops and SMChMs are the [[gendarmerie]]-like military force who can be assigned to carry out simple public security tasks like patrolling while being accompanied by professional militsioners, or cordoning large crowds at sport events, concerts, and protests. These soldiers possess no [[firearms]] on their policing duties, however they are equipped with PR-73 rubber [[police baton]]s, PR-90 [[tonfa]]s and related equipment; when called to perform [[riot control]] duties, they are typically equipped with [[ballistic shield]]s and [[tear gas]]. The SMChM soldiers typically wear grey militsiya uniforms, distinguished from commissioned officers by wearing standard-issued [[sapogi]] instead of individual boots or shoes, the Internal Troops wear green [[military uniform]]. During emergencies, [[police raid|raids]], [[Dragnet (policing)|dragnets]] and other police operations, they are equipped with bullet-proof vests and protective gear, firearms and [[armoured vehicles]] while performing their policing duties.\n\nWhile not on law enforcement duty, soldiers reside in barracks and maintain standard military training. Special motorised militsiya units stationed in the cities were all [[battalion]]s with three exceptions. [[Kiev]] and [[Leningrad]] had [[regiment]]s and [[Moscow]] had a [[division (military unit)|division]], known as [[OMSDON|ODON]], which is frequently used for policing Moscow; its soldiers can be spotted by a shoulder patch which features a white [[Leopard|panther]]; other Internal troops units in the Moscow region use a shoulder patch with a white falcon.\n\n===Rank insignia===\nUntil late 1936, the People's Militsiya and [[Internal Troops]] of the [[NKVD]] had no personal ranks, much akin to the [[Red Army]], [[Red Navy]], and [[OGPU]], and used position ranks. When personal ranks were reintroduced in the military in 1935, the Militsiya created a curious rank system that was a blend of standard military ranks such as sergeant, lieutenant, captain and major, and old positional ranks like 'squad leader', 'inspector', and 'director', some with several grades like 'senior' or 'junior'. The collar rank insignia was completely original and not based on military insignia.\n\nThis system was largely reused by the [[GUGB]] in their special rank structure introduced in 1935, although with new rank insignia and [[Commissar]]-style ranks for top officers.\n\nNew insignia were issued to GUGB in 1937 and to Militsiya in 1939. It was now based on collar rank patches of the Red Army and Internal Troops. Confusingly, the special NKVD rank system was left intact, so for example '''Captain of Militsiya/State Security'' was assigned the three-box insignia of an army Colonel (in the Red Army, this patch was reassigned to lieutenant colonel in September 1939, but the NKVD did not alter their insignia) and ''Major of Militsiya/State Security'' was mapped to one-romb insignia of ''[[Kombrig]]'' (a brigade commander) (which was abolished for commanding officers of the Red Army in May 1940). This created a great deal of inconsistency and tension between army and NKVD/NKGB officers.\n\nThe NKVD rank system was streamlined in 1943 when imperial-style shoulder boards replaced the collar insignia patches. The ranks now copied those of the Soviet Army, with the exception of top officers starting with 'Senior Major' who were renamed [[Commissar]] of Militsiya 3rd, 2nd, and 1st rank, although they still wore army-style Major General, Lieutenant General and Colonel General shoulder boards.\n\nThe GUGB/NKGB maintained their commissar ranks until 1945, and switched to equivalent General ranks after that. The Militsiya retained the commissar ranks until 1973.\n\nSome MVD officers had distinct ranks of General of the Internal Service of 1st, 2nd and 3rd rank; they were replaced with Major General, Lieutenant General and Colonel General in the 1970s.\n\nRanks of militsiya are considered special ranks, not to be confused with military (all-forces) ranks, which are used by the internal troops of the [[MVD]]. All militsiya ranks have had the words \"of militsiya\" at the end, which are part of the rank name and not a descriptive addition.\n\n====Table of ranks and insignia of Soviet militsiya (1936\u20131939)====\n{|  style=\"width:100%; border:1px solid #8888aa; background:#fff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin:0 12px 12px 0; text-align:center; \"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!\n!

The militsiya was reaffirmed on October 28 (November 10, according to the [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|new style dating]]), 1917 under the official name of the Workers' and Peasants' Militsiya, in further contrast to what the Bolsheviks called the \"[[bourgeois]] class protecting\" police.  Eventually, it was replaced by the [[MVD|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (Russian: \u041c\u0412\u0414, ''MVD''; Ukrainian: \u041c\u0412\u0421, ''MVS''; Belorussian: \u041c\u0423\u0421, ''MUS''), which is now the official full name for the militsiya forces in the respective countries.

Their functions and organisation differ significantly from similarly named departments in Western countries, which are usually civil executive bodies headed by politicians and responsible for many other tasks as well as the supervision of law enforcement. The Soviet and successor MVDs have usually been headed by a militsiya general and predominantly consist of service personnel, with civilian employees only filling auxiliary posts. Although such ministers are members of their respective countries' cabinet, they usually do not report to the prime minister and parliament, but only to the president. Local militsiya departments are subordinated to their regional departments, having little accountability before local authorities.\n\n[[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal affairs]] units within the militsiya itself are usually called \"internal security\" departments.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\nThe official names of particular militsiya bodies and services in post-Soviet countries are usually very complicated, hence the use of the short term militsiya. Laws usually refer to police just as militsiya.\n\nThe short term for a police officer (regardless of gender) is ''militsioner'' (Russian: ''\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0440'', Ukrainian: ''\u043ci\u043bi\u0446i\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0440''). Slang terms for ''militsioner'' include ''ment'' (plural: \u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b, ''menty'') and ''musor'' (plural: ''\u043c\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0430'', ''musora''). Although the latter word is offensive (it literally means \"trash\" or \"garbage\"), it originated from an acronym for the Moscow Criminal Investigations Department (\u041c\u0423\u0421, short for \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0443\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u044b\u0441\u043a) in [[Imperial Russia]]. ''Ment'' is a close equivalent to the English slang term \"cop\" and has derived from the [[Lw\u00f3w dialect]].<ref>Kosmolinska, Natalka and Yuri Oxrimenko. \"[http://www.ji.lviv.ua/n36-1texts/kosmolinska.htm Homo leopolensis esse].\" No. 36, 2004.</ref>\n\n[[File:Countries with militsiya map.svg|thumb|{{legend|blue|Countries in which civilian police was once called ''militsiya''}}\n{{legend|darkblue|Countries in which civilian police is now called ''militsiya''}}]]\n\nThe following countries have changed the name of the police force from Militsiya to Police western-style name: [[Bulgaria]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Estonia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Moldova]], [[Latvia]], [[Mongolia]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]],\n[[Slovenia]] [[Kazakhstan]], [[Armenia]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]].\n\nThe police are still called ''Militsiya'' in [[Belarus]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], as well as in unrecognized republics of [[Abkhazia]], [[South Ossetia]] and [[Transnistria]] but in Kyrgyzstan there is an active discussion about renaming the police force from ''Militsiya'' to ''Police''.\n\n==General overview==\n[[File:VAZ-2106 police car in Yerevan, Armenia.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Lada Riva|Lada 2106]] belonging to the Armenian State Automobile Inspection parked on a street in [[Yerevan]], June 2007.]]\n[[File:Gai radar.jpg|thumb|250px|A Russian [[GAI]] inspector with a [[radar gun]] on the side of [[MKAD]]]]\nThe organizational structure, methods and traditions of the militsiya differ significantly from those of western police. Militsiya as an organisation consists of many functional departments, such as the [[GAI|GIBDD]], a traffic police. [[Organised crime]] detectives form highly independent squads inside regional militsiya. Some units may have the distinctive names (like [[OMON]] in Russia) which are more specific than ''militsiya'' or ''militsioner''.\n\nMilitsiya personnel ranks mostly follow those of the Army \u2013 from [[Private (rank)|private]] (Rus: ''ryadovoy''), which is the lowest rank, to [[colonel general]] \u2013 with only these exceptions: there are no ranks of [[Gefreiter|Yefreytor]], [[Army general (Russia)|Army General]], or [[Marshal of the Russian Federation|Marshal]]. Detectives (Russian: ''operativnik'' short for ''operativniy rabotnik'') hold a rank of lieutenant at least and could be promoted to major or the [[lieutenant colonel]]. The militsiya of an [[oblast]] (or other equivalent [[subnational entity]]) is usually headed by a general. The rank name is suffixed with ''of militsiya'' (e.g. ''major of militsiya'' for a major). Militsiya personnel carry [[firearm]]s, but are not permitted to carry their weapons when they are off duty.\n\nUnlike in some other countries' police agencies, militsioners are not assigned permanent partners, but work alone or within larger groups. Neither uniformed officers nor detectives are allowed to drive police vehicles themselves,{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} so a specialist driver (either a serviceman or a civil employee) is assigned to each car and is also in charge of its maintenance. Under the Patrol Police Service Regulations a designated police officer-driver is required to have a driver licence and is not allowed to abandon the vehicle.<ref>Patrol police service regulations by the Order of the MVD of Russia No. 80 dated 29 January 2008, art. 158 http://base.garant.ru/12159440/</ref> However, this refers only to fully marked police vehicles with emergency lights; detectives are allowed to drive civilian cars with are registered to the MVD, having white number plates (marked police vehicles have blue plates) with specific series (for example, ''o...vo'', ''o...rr'', ''o...mm'', ''o...om''). The last two are usually assigned to the vehicles registered to regional level MVD units. The law does not provide any preferences on the road nor allows emergency lights and/or sirens on such vehicles,<ref>Unmarked vehicles may only be equipped with emergency lights and sirens in accordance with the specific procedure set forth by the Decree of the President of Russia. http://base.garant.ru/70177358/</ref> therefore technically police officers do not have the right to violate traffic laws even while on an assignment. [[GAI|GIBDD]] (the traffic militsiya) is the only exception: its members drive their own (or even own private) cars and are specially trained in risk-driving.\n\nOne unique feature of militsiya policing approach is the system of territorial patronage over citizens. The cities, as well as the rural settlements are divided into ''uchastoks'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|pl. \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0438}}, ''\"quarters\"'') with a special ''uchastkovyi'' militsioner (\"quarter policeman\"), assigned to each. The main duty of ''uchastkovyi'' is to maintain close relations with the residents of his quarter and gather information among them. In particular, ''uchastkovyi'' should personally know each and every ex-convict, substance abuser, young hooligan etc. in given ''uchastok'', and visit them regularly for preemptive influence. ''Uchastkovyi'' is also responsible for tackling minor offences like family violence, loud noise, residential area parking etc. ''Uchastkovyi'' is also the main, and actually the real, militsiya force in remote areas and small settlements where permanent police departments are not created. ''Uchastkovyi'' militsioners possess separate small offices within their quarters and maintain citizens admittance in definite weekdays.\n\nThis system slightly resembles the US system of [[sheriff]]s but shows some notable differences. ''Uchastkovyi'' is neither a chief police officer in a given community nor a universal one (not combining detective, incarceration or special tactics tasks).\n\nThe system of ''uchastkovyis'' dates back to [[Russian Empire|imperial times]] when ''uriadniks'' were conducting lowest-level policing in rural areas. In Soviet Union, ''uchastkovyis'' were also responsible for such tasks as maintaining [[propiska in the Soviet Union|propiska]] limitations and overseeing former political prisoners, which were subject to daily registration at the local MVD office.\n\nAlthough women constitute a significant proportion of militsiya staff, they are usually not permitted to fill positions that carry risks (such as patrolman, guard, [[SWAT]]), but are allowed to carry firearms for self-defence. Instead, they are widely represented among investigators, juvenile crime inspectors, clerks, etc. However, limited attempts are being made to appoint women as traffic officers or ''operativniks''.\n\n===Conscripted police===\n{{further|Internal Troops|Internal Troops (Russia)}}\n[[File:CentVO Sokol.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Shoulder patch of Internal Troops, Moscow District]]\n[[File:Separate division operational use.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[ODON]] shoulder patch]]\n\nAnother unique militsiya feature is the use of [[Conscription|conscripted]] soldiers from the [[Internal Troops]] and special motorized militsiya units (''\u0421\u041c\u0427\u041c'', SMChM) for regular urban policing and for securing various mass events, which required more force employment than usual. The Internal Troops and SMChMs are the [[gendarmerie]]-like military force who can be assigned to carry out simple public security tasks like patrolling while being accompanied by professional militsioners, or cordoning large crowds at sport events, concerts, and protests. These soldiers possess no [[firearms]] on their policing duties, however they are equipped with PR-73 rubber [[police baton]]s, PR-90 [[tonfa]]s and related equipment; when called to perform [[riot control]] duties, they are typically equipped with [[ballistic shield]]s and [[tear gas]]. The SMChM soldiers typically wear grey militsiya uniforms, distinguished from commissioned officers by wearing standard-issued [[sapogi]] instead of individual boots or shoes, the Internal Troops wear green [[military uniform]]. During emergencies, [[police raid|raids]], [[Dragnet (policing)|dragnets]] and other police operations, they are equipped with bullet-proof vests and protective gear, firearms and [[armoured vehicles]] while performing their policing duties.\n\nWhile not on law enforcement duty, soldiers reside in barracks and maintain standard military training. Special motorised militsiya units stationed in the cities were all [[battalion]]s with three exceptions. [[Kiev]] and [[Leningrad]] had [[regiment]]s and [[Moscow]] had a [[division (military unit)|division]], known as [[OMSDON|ODON]], which is frequently used for policing Moscow; its soldiers can be spotted by a shoulder patch which features a white [[Leopard|panther]]; other Internal troops units in the Moscow region use a shoulder patch with a white falcon.\n\n===Rank insignia===\nUntil late 1936, the People's Militsiya and [[Internal Troops]] of the [[NKVD]] had no personal ranks, much akin to the [[Red Army]], [[Red Navy]], and [[OGPU]], and used position ranks. When personal ranks were reintroduced in the military in 1935, the Militsiya created a curious rank system that was a blend of standard military ranks such as sergeant, lieutenant, captain and major, and old positional ranks like 'squad leader', 'inspector', and 'director', some with several grades like 'senior' or 'junior'. The collar rank insignia was completely original and not based on military insignia.\n\nThis system was largely reused by the [[GUGB]] in their special rank structure introduced in 1935, although with new rank insignia and [[Commissar]]-style ranks for top officers.\n\nNew insignia were issued to GUGB in 1937 and to Militsiya in 1939. It was now based on collar rank patches of the Red Army and Internal Troops. Confusingly, the special NKVD rank system was left intact, so for example '''Captain of Militsiya/State Security'' was assigned the three-box insignia of an army Colonel (in the Red Army, this patch was reassigned to lieutenant colonel in September 1939, but the NKVD did not alter their insignia) and ''Major of Militsiya/State Security'' was mapped to one-romb insignia of ''[[Kombrig]]'' (a brigade commander) (which was abolished for commanding officers of the Red Army in May 1940). This created a great deal of inconsistency and tension between army and NKVD/NKGB officers.\n\nThe NKVD rank system was streamlined in 1943 when imperial-style shoulder boards replaced the collar insignia patches. The ranks now copied those of the Soviet Army, with the exception of top officers starting with 'Senior Major' who were renamed [[Commissar]] of Militsiya 3rd, 2nd, and 1st rank, although they still wore army-style Major General, Lieutenant General and Colonel General shoulder boards.\n\nThe GUGB/NKGB maintained their commissar ranks until 1945, and switched to equivalent General ranks after that. The Militsiya retained the commissar ranks until 1973.\n\nSome MVD officers had distinct ranks of General of the Internal Service of 1st, 2nd and 3rd rank; they were replaced with Major General, Lieutenant General and Colonel General in the 1970s.\n\nRanks of militsiya are considered special ranks, not to be confused with military (all-forces) ranks, which are used by the internal troops of the [[MVD]]. All militsiya ranks have had the words \"of militsiya\" at the end, which are part of the rank name and not a descriptive addition.\n\n====Table of ranks and insignia of Soviet militsiya (1936\u20131939)====\n{|  style=\"width:100%; border:1px solid #8888aa; background:#fff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin:0 12px 12px 0; text-align:center; \"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!\n!

UKIP also won their first seat on the authority in Scartho, a seat that was considered safe for the Conservatives, having won it at every local election since 1999.<ref>http://www.electionscentre.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/North-East-Lincolnshire-1995-2012.pdf</ref>\n\nUKIP also made considerable progress in many other wards which they would go on to win over the next few years, including Humberston & New Waltham, where at these elections, UKIP came little over 200 votes short of defeating Conservative councillor and Grimsby Town Football Club chairman John Fenty, a seat which UKIP would gain at a by-election in 2013 following the death of Fenty's fellow councillor, John Colebrook, and successfully held this seat when it was next up for election in 2014.\n\n==Ward results==\n\n===Croft Baker===\n\n{{Election box begin |title=Croft Baker 2012}}\n\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Labour Party (UK)\n   |candidate  = Terry Thurogood\n   |votes      = 1327\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = UK Independence Party\n   |candidate  = Philip Raymond Wilson\n   |votes      = 448\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Liberal Democrats (UK)\n   |candidate  = Leanor Mary Pidgen\n   |votes      = 418\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Conservative Party (UK)\n   |candidate  = Debbie Landymore\n   |votes      = 364\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box majority|\n  |votes = 879\t|percentage = \t|change = }}\n{{Election box gain with party link|\n  |winner     = Labour Party (UK)\n  |loser      = Liberal Democrats (UK)\n  |swing      = }}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n===East Marsh===\n\n{{Election box begin |title=East Marsh 2012}}\n\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Labour Party (UK)\n   |candidate  = Jon-Paul Howarth\n   |votes      = 789\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Liberal Democrats (UK)\n   |candidate  = Jeanette Mary McLeod Ferguson\n   |votes      = 335\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = UK Independence Party\n   |candidate  = Henry Richard Hudson\n   |votes      = 215\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Conservative Party (UK)\n   |candidate  = Phillip John Dumbrell\n   |votes      = 105\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Green Party of England and Wales\n   |candidate  = Martin Leslie Reed\n   |votes      = 61\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box majority|\n |votes = 454\t|percentage = \t|change = }}\n{{Election box gain with party link|\n  |winner     = Labour Party (UK)\n  |loser      = Liberal Democrats (UK)\n  |swing      = }}\n{{Election box end}}\n\nNote: Jon-Paul Howarth theoretically holds his seat, as he was elected as a Liberal Democrat when the seat was last fought in 2008, but quit the party to sit as an Independent, and went on to defect to the Labour Party mid-term.\n\n===Freshney===\n\n{{Election box begin |title=Freshney 2012}}\n\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Labour Party (UK)\n   |candidate  = Cliff Barber\n   |votes      = 1043\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Conservative Party (UK)\n   |candidate  = David Anthony Hasthorpe\n   |votes      = 332\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = UK Independence Party\n   |candidate  = Stephen Whittingham\n   |votes      = 332\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Liberal Democrats (UK)\n   |candidate  = Kevin Bakr\n   |votes      = 112\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n   |party      = Independent (politician)\n   |candidate  = Keith Watkin\n   |votes      = 87\t|percentage = \t|change     = }}\n{{Election box majority|\n |votes = 711\t|percentage = \t|change = }}\n{{Election box gain with party link|\n  |winner     = Labour Party (UK)\n  |loser      = Liberal Democrats (UK)\n  |swing      = }}\n{{Election box end}}\n\nNote: Cliff Barber theoretically holds his seat, as he was elected as a Liberal Democrat when the seat was last fought in 2008, but defected to the Labour Party mid-term.
