Although it is a very rare disorder, study of this and other bone marrow failure syndromes has improved scientific understanding of the mechanisms of normal bone marrow function and development of cancer. Among those affected, the majority develop [[cancer]], most often [[acute myelogenous leukemia]], and 90% develop [[aplastic anemia|bone marrow failure]] (the inability to produce blood cells) by age 40. About 60\u201375% of people have [[congenital defects]], commonly [[short stature]], abnormalities of the skin, arms, head, eyes, kidneys, and ears, and developmental disabilities.

This means that two mutated [[alleles]] (one from each parent) are required to cause the disease. The risk is 25% that each subsequent child will have FA. About 2% of FA cases are X-linked recessive, which means that if the mother carries one mutated Fanconi anemia allele on one [[X chromosome]], a 50% chance exists that male offspring will present with Fanconi anemia.\n\nScientists have identified 22 FA or FA-like genes: ''[[FANCA]]'', ''[[FANCB]]'', ''[[FANCC]]'', ''[[FANCD1]] (BRCA2)'', ''[[FANCD2]]'', ''[[FANCE]]'', ''[[FANCF]]'', ''[[FANCG]]'', ''[[FANCI]]'', ''[[FANCJ]] (BRIP1)'', ''[[FANCL]]'', ''[[FANCM]]'', ''[[FANCN]] (PALB2)'', ''FANCO (RAD51C),'' ''[[FANCP]] (SLX4)'', ''[[ERCC4|FANCQ]]'' (''XPF), [[BRCA1|FANCS]] (BRCA1), FANCT (UBE2T), [[XRCC2|FANCU]] (XRCC2), [[MAD2L2|FANCV]] (REV7),'' and ''FANCW (RFWD3)''.

By the age of 40, 98% of FA patients will have developed some type of [[hematological abnormality]]. However,  a few cases have occurred  in which older patients have died without ever developing them. Symptoms appear progressively, and often lead to complete [[bone marrow]] failure. While at birth, blood count is usually normal, [[macrocytosis]]/[[megaloblastic anemia]], defined as unusually large red blood cells, is the first detected abnormality, often within the first decade of life (median age of onset is 7 years). Within the next 10 years, over 50% of patients presenting haematological abnormalities will have developed [[pancytopenia]], defined as abnormalities in two or more blood cell lineages. This is in contrast to [[Diamond\u2013Blackfan anemia]], which affects only erythrocytes, and [[Shwachman\u2013Diamond syndrome]], which primarily causes neutropenia. Most commonly, a low platelet count ([[thrombocytopenia]]) precedes a low neutrophil count ([[neutropenia]]), with both appearing with relative equal frequencies. The deficiencies cause increased risk of [[hemorrhage]] and recurrent [[infections]], respectively. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nAs FA is now known to affect DNA repair, specifically [[homologous recombination]],<ref name=\"Deans1\" /> and given the current knowledge about dynamic cell division in the bone marrow, finding patients are more likely to develop bone marrow failure, [[myelodysplastic syndromes]], and [[acute myeloid leukemia]] (AML)  is not surprising.\n\n===Myelodysplastic syndromes===\n\nMDSs, formerly known as preleukemia, are a group of bone marrow neoplastic diseases that share many of the morphologic features of AML, with some important differences. First, the percentage of undifferentiated progenitor cells, [[blast cells]], is always less than 20%, with considerably more [[dysplasia]], defined as cytoplasmic and nuclear morphologic changes in [[erythroid]], [[granulocytic]], and [[megakaryocytic]] precursors, than what is usually seen in cases of AML. These changes reflect delayed [[apoptosis]] or a failure of [[programmed cell death]]. When left untreated, MDS can lead to AML in about 30% of cases. Due the nature of the FA pathology, MDS diagnosis cannot be made solely through cytogenetic analysis of the marrow. Indeed, it is only when morphologic analysis of marrow cells is performed, that a diagnosis of MDS can be ascertained. Upon examination, MDS-afflicted FA patients will show many clonal variations, appearing either prior or subsequent to the MDS. Furthermore, cells will show chromosomal aberrations, the most frequent being [[monosomy]] 7 and partial [[Trisomy|trisomies]] of [[chromosome 3q]] 15. Observation of monosomy 7 within the marrow is well correlated with an increased risk of developing AML and with a very poor prognosis, death generally ensuing within 2 years (unless prompt [[allotransplantation|allogeneic]] [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant]] is an option).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mehta PA, etal |journal=Cancer Genetics|year=2010|title=Numerical chromosomal changes and risk of development of myelodysplastic syndrome-acute myeloid leukemia in patients with Fanconi anemia|volume=203|issue=2|pages=180\u2013186|doi=10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2010.07.127|pmid=21156231}}</ref>\n\n===Acute myeloid leukemia===\nFA patients are at elevated risk for the development of AML defined as presence of 20% or more of myeloid blasts in the marrow or 5 to 20% myeloid blasts in the blood. All of the subtypes of AML can occur in FA with the exception of promyelocytic. However, myelomonocytic and acute monocytic are the most common subtypes observed. Many MDS patients' diseases evolve into AML if they survive long enough. Furthermore, the risk of developing AML increases with the onset of bone-marrow failure.\n\nAlthough risk of developing either MDS or AML before the age of 20 is only 27%, this risk increases to 43% by the age of 30 and 52% by the age of 40. Historically, even with a marrow transplant, about a quarter of FA patients diagnosed with MDS/ALS have died from MDS/ALS-related causes within two years,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Butturini A|display-authors=etal| year = 1994 | title =  Hematologic abnormalities in Fanconi anemia: an International Fanconi Anemia Registry study| url = | journal = Blood | volume = 84 | issue = 5| pages = 1650\u20134 | pmid = 8068955 | doi = 10.1182/blood.v84.5.1650.bloodjournal8451650 }}</ref> although more recent published evidence suggests that earlier [[allotransplantation|allogeneic]] [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation]] in children with FA is leading to better outcomes over time.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=de Latour RP, etal |title=Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in Fanconi anemia: the EBMT experience|journal=Blood|year=2013|volume= 122|issue=26|doi= 10.1182/blood-2013-01-479733|pmid=24144640|pages=4279\u20134286}}</ref>\n\n===Bone marrow failure===\nThe last major haematological complication associated with FA is bone marrow failure, defined as inadequate blood cell production. Several types of  failure are observed in FA patients, and generally precede MDS and AML. Detection of decreasing blood count is generally the first sign used to assess necessity of treatment and possible transplant. While most FA patients are initially responsive to androgen therapy and haemopoietic [[growth factor]]s, these have been shown to promote leukemia, especially in patients with clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, and have severe side effects, including [[hepatic adenomas]] and [[adenocarcinomas]]. The only treatment left would be bone marrow transplant; however, such an operation has a relatively low success rate in FA patients when the donor is unrelated (30% 5-year survival). It is, therefore, imperative to transplant from an HLA-identical sibling. Furthermore, due to the increased susceptibility of FA patients to chromosomal damage, pretransplant conditioning cannot include high doses of radiation or immunosuppressants, thus increased chances of patients developing [[graft-versus-host disease]]. If all precautions are taken, and the marrow transplant is performed within the first decade of life, two-year probability of survival can be as high as 89%. However, if the transplant is performed at ages older than 10, two-year survival rates drop to 54%.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nA recent report by Zhang et al. investigates the mechanism of bone marrow failure in FANCC-/- cells.<ref name=\"pmid15769896\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang X, Li J, Sejas DP, Pang Q |title=Hypoxia-reoxygenation induces premature senescence in FA bone marrow hematopoietic cells |journal=Blood |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=75\u201385 |year=2005 |pmid=15769896 |doi=10.1182/blood-2004-08-3033|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5aa1253685d415ed854124e459439220a1f55e99 }}</ref> They hypothesize and successfully demonstrate that continuous cycles of hypoxia-reoxygenation, such as those seen by haemopoietic and progenitor cells as they migrate between hyperoxic blood and hypoxic marrow tissues, leads to premature cellular senescence and therefore inhibition of haemopoietic function.

They are involved in the recognition and repair of damaged DNA; genetic defects leave them unable to repair DNA. The FA core complex of 8 proteins is normally activated when DNA stops replicating because of damage. The core complex adds [[ubiquitin]], a small protein that combines with [[BRCA2]] in another cluster to repair DNA (see Figure '''Recombinational repair of DNA double-strand damage'''). At the end of the process, ubiquitin is removed.<ref name=\"D'Andrea\" />\n\nRecent studies have shown that eight of these proteins, FANCA, -B, -C, -E, -F, -G, -L and -M, assemble to form a core protein complex in the nucleus.

This means that two mutated [[alleles]] (one from each parent) are required to cause the disease. The risk is 25% that each subsequent child will have FA. About 2% of FA cases are X-linked recessive, which means that if the mother carries one mutated Fanconi anemia allele on one [[X chromosome]], a 50% chance exists that male offspring will present with Fanconi anemia.\n\nScientists have identified 22 FA or FA-like genes: ''[[FANCA]]'', ''[[FANCB]]'', ''[[FANCC]]'', ''[[FANCD1]] (BRCA2)'', ''[[FANCD2]]'', ''[[FANCE]]'', ''[[FANCF]]'', ''[[FANCG]]'', ''[[FANCI]]'', ''[[FANCJ]] (BRIP1)'', ''[[FANCL]]'', ''[[FANCM]]'', ''[[FANCN]] (PALB2)'', ''FANCO (RAD51C),'' ''[[FANCP]] (SLX4)'', ''[[ERCC4|FANCQ]]'' (''XPF), [[BRCA1|FANCS]] (BRCA1), FANCT (UBE2T), [[XRCC2|FANCU]] (XRCC2), [[MAD2L2|FANCV]] (REV7),'' and ''FANCW (RFWD3)''.

By the age of 40, 98% of FA patients will have developed some type of [[hematological abnormality]]. However,  a few cases have occurred  in which older patients have died without ever developing them. Symptoms appear progressively, and often lead to complete [[bone marrow]] failure. While at birth, blood count is usually normal, [[macrocytosis]]/[[megaloblastic anemia]], defined as unusually large red blood cells, is the first detected abnormality, often within the first decade of life (median age of onset is 7 years). Within the next 10 years, over 50% of patients presenting haematological abnormalities will have developed [[pancytopenia]], defined as abnormalities in two or more blood cell lineages. This is in contrast to [[Diamond\u2013Blackfan anemia]], which affects only erythrocytes, and [[Shwachman\u2013Diamond syndrome]], which primarily causes neutropenia. Most commonly, a low platelet count ([[thrombocytopenia]]) precedes a low neutrophil count ([[neutropenia]]), with both appearing with relative equal frequencies. The deficiencies cause increased risk of [[hemorrhage]] and recurrent [[infections]], respectively. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nAs FA is now known to affect DNA repair, specifically [[homologous recombination]],<ref name=\"Deans1\" /> and given the current knowledge about dynamic cell division in the bone marrow, finding patients are more likely to develop bone marrow failure, [[myelodysplastic syndromes]], and [[acute myeloid leukemia]] (AML)  is not surprising.\n\n===Myelodysplastic syndromes===\n\nMDSs, formerly known as preleukemia, are a group of bone marrow neoplastic diseases that share many of the morphologic features of AML, with some important differences. First, the percentage of undifferentiated progenitor cells, [[blast cells]], is always less than 20%, with considerably more [[dysplasia]], defined as cytoplasmic and nuclear morphologic changes in [[erythroid]], [[granulocytic]], and [[megakaryocytic]] precursors, than what is usually seen in cases of AML. These changes reflect delayed [[apoptosis]] or a failure of [[programmed cell death]]. When left untreated, MDS can lead to AML in about 30% of cases. Due the nature of the FA pathology, MDS diagnosis cannot be made solely through cytogenetic analysis of the marrow. Indeed, it is only when morphologic analysis of marrow cells is performed, that a diagnosis of MDS can be ascertained. Upon examination, MDS-afflicted FA patients will show many clonal variations, appearing either prior or subsequent to the MDS. Furthermore, cells will show chromosomal aberrations, the most frequent being [[monosomy]] 7 and partial [[Trisomy|trisomies]] of [[chromosome 3q]] 15. Observation of monosomy 7 within the marrow is well correlated with an increased risk of developing AML and with a very poor prognosis, death generally ensuing within 2 years (unless prompt [[allotransplantation|allogeneic]] [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant]] is an option).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mehta PA, etal |journal=Cancer Genetics|year=2010|title=Numerical chromosomal changes and risk of development of myelodysplastic syndrome-acute myeloid leukemia in patients with Fanconi anemia|volume=203|issue=2|pages=180\u2013186|doi=10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2010.07.127|pmid=21156231}}</ref>\n\n===Acute myeloid leukemia===\nFA patients are at elevated risk for the development of AML defined as presence of 20% or more of myeloid blasts in the marrow or 5 to 20% myeloid blasts in the blood. All of the subtypes of AML can occur in FA with the exception of promyelocytic. However, myelomonocytic and acute monocytic are the most common subtypes observed. Many MDS patients' diseases evolve into AML if they survive long enough. Furthermore, the risk of developing AML increases with the onset of bone-marrow failure.\n\nAlthough risk of developing either MDS or AML before the age of 20 is only 27%, this risk increases to 43% by the age of 30 and 52% by the age of 40. Historically, even with a marrow transplant, about a quarter of FA patients diagnosed with MDS/ALS have died from MDS/ALS-related causes within two years,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Butturini A|display-authors=etal| year = 1994 | title =  Hematologic abnormalities in Fanconi anemia: an International Fanconi Anemia Registry study| url = | journal = Blood | volume = 84 | issue = 5| pages = 1650\u20134 | pmid = 8068955 | doi = 10.1182/blood.v84.5.1650.bloodjournal8451650 }}</ref> although more recent published evidence suggests that earlier [[allotransplantation|allogeneic]] [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation]] in children with FA is leading to better outcomes over time.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=de Latour RP, etal |title=Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in Fanconi anemia: the EBMT experience|journal=Blood|year=2013|volume= 122|issue=26|doi= 10.1182/blood-2013-01-479733|pmid=24144640|pages=4279\u20134286}}</ref>\n\n===Bone marrow failure===\nThe last major haematological complication associated with FA is bone marrow failure, defined as inadequate blood cell production. Several types of  failure are observed in FA patients, and generally precede MDS and AML. Detection of decreasing blood count is generally the first sign used to assess necessity of treatment and possible transplant. While most FA patients are initially responsive to androgen therapy and haemopoietic [[growth factor]]s, these have been shown to promote leukemia, especially in patients with clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, and have severe side effects, including [[hepatic adenomas]] and [[adenocarcinomas]]. The only treatment left would be bone marrow transplant; however, such an operation has a relatively low success rate in FA patients when the donor is unrelated (30% 5-year survival). It is, therefore, imperative to transplant from an HLA-identical sibling. Furthermore, due to the increased susceptibility of FA patients to chromosomal damage, pretransplant conditioning cannot include high doses of radiation or immunosuppressants, thus increased chances of patients developing [[graft-versus-host disease]]. If all precautions are taken, and the marrow transplant is performed within the first decade of life, two-year probability of survival can be as high as 89%. However, if the transplant is performed at ages older than 10, two-year survival rates drop to 54%.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nA recent report by Zhang et al. investigates the mechanism of bone marrow failure in FANCC-/- cells.<ref name=\"pmid15769896\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang X, Li J, Sejas DP, Pang Q |title=Hypoxia-reoxygenation induces premature senescence in FA bone marrow hematopoietic cells |journal=Blood |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=75\u201385 |year=2005 |pmid=15769896 |doi=10.1182/blood-2004-08-3033|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5aa1253685d415ed854124e459439220a1f55e99 }}</ref> They hypothesize and successfully demonstrate that continuous cycles of hypoxia-reoxygenation, such as those seen by haemopoietic and progenitor cells as they migrate between hyperoxic blood and hypoxic marrow tissues, leads to premature cellular senescence and therefore inhibition of haemopoietic function.

They are involved in the recognition and repair of damaged DNA; genetic defects leave them unable to repair DNA. The FA core complex of 8 proteins is normally activated when DNA stops replicating because of damage. The core complex adds [[ubiquitin]], a small protein that combines with [[BRCA2]] in another cluster to repair DNA (see Figure '''Recombinational repair of DNA double-strand damage'''). At the end of the process, ubiquitin is removed.<ref name=\"D'Andrea\" />\n\nRecent studies have shown that eight of these proteins, FANCA, -B, -C, -E, -F, -G, -L and -M, assemble to form a core protein complex in the nucleus. According to current models, the complex moves from the cytoplasm into the nucleus following nuclear localization signals on FANCA and FANCE. Assembly is activated by replicative stress, particularly [[DNA repair|DNA damage]] caused by [[Crosslinking of DNA|cross-link]]ing agents (such as mitomycin C or cisplatin) or [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) that is detected by the FANCM protein.<ref name=\"pmid20064461\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Deans AJ, West SC | title = FANCM connects the genome instability disorders Bloom's Syndrome and Fanconi Anemia | journal = Mol.

During his time there, McManus represented the [[Scotland national under-21 football team]] and the [[Scotland B national football team|Scotland Future team]]. After leaving Hibs in January 2005, McManus had a nomadic career, including two spells in both the US and the Republic of Ireland.\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nMcManus grew up in [[Balornock]] and [[Bishopbriggs]] in the north of Glasgow<ref>[http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/competitions/premiership/effervescent-mcmanus-gets-a-lucky-break-at-last-1-633024 Effervescent McManus gets a lucky break at last]</ref> and started his career with [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], making his debut against [[Stranraer F.C.|Stranraer]] in 1999. He made his first start in an [[Edinburgh derby]] against [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] a year later. He had earlier gained first-team experience with loan spells at [[East Fife F.C.|East Fife]] and then [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrieonians]]. McManus went on to become a first-team regular for Hibs, enjoying his best season in [[2002\u201303 in Scottish football|2002\u201303]], when he scored 11 goals finishing top goalscorer at the club.\n\nIn August 2004, new Hibs manager [[Tony Mowbray]] decided McManus would not feature in Hibs' first team plans and he was loaned to [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]]. McManus failed to settle in [[Lincolnshire]], and returned north to sign for [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] in January 2005. The ''Dark Blues'' were struggling in the league, and despite Calum McDonald's goal in a relegation-decider against [[Livingston F.C.|Livingston]], Dundee were demoted to the [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]]. After the game McManus was photographed lying on the pitch in floods of tears. Financial difficulties at Dundee, resultant from relegation and an earlier spell in administration required them to remove the highest-earners from their wage bill and along with [[Lee Wilkie]], McManus negotiated a release settlement in mid-2006.\n\n===Falkirk and Dunfermline Athletic===\nMcManus signed for Falkirk in August 2006,<ref name=\"Falkirk transfer\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/falkirk/5313068.stm|publisher=BBC |work=[[BBC Sport]]|title=McManus wins contract with Bairns|date=8 September 2006}}</ref> but after playing a largely peripheral role in the first half of the [[2006\u201307 in Scottish football|2006\u201307]] season, he was released by the Bairns.<ref name=\"McManus released\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/falkirk/6318517.stm|publisher=BBC Sport website|title=McManus allowed to leave Falkirk|date=31 January 2007}}</ref> Four weeks later, McManus signed a short-term contract with Dunfermline for the remainder of the current season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dunfermline_athletic/6382311.stm|title=Dunfermline sign striker McManus|accessdate=1 January 2008 | work=BBC Sport | date=26 February 2007}}</ref> He scored two goals in six games.

During his time there, McManus represented the [[Scotland national under-21 football team]] and the [[Scotland B national football team|Scotland Future team]]. After leaving Hibs in January 2005, McManus had a nomadic career, including two spells in both the [[United States]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]].\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nMcManus grew up in [[Balornock]] and [[Bishopbriggs]] in the north of Glasgow<ref>[http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/competitions/premiership/effervescent-mcmanus-gets-a-lucky-break-at-last-1-633024 Effervescent McManus gets a lucky break at last]</ref> and started his career with [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], making his debut against [[Stranraer F.C.|Stranraer]] in 1999. He made his first start in an [[Edinburgh derby]] against [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] a year later. He had earlier gained first-team experience with loan spells at [[East Fife F.C.|East Fife]] and then [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrieonians]]. McManus went on to become a first-team regular for Hibs, enjoying his best season in [[2002\u201303 in Scottish football|2002\u201303]], when he scored 11 goals finishing top goalscorer at the club.\n\nIn August 2004, new Hibs manager [[Tony Mowbray]] decided McManus would not feature in Hibs' first team plans and he was loaned to [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]]. McManus failed to settle in [[Lincolnshire]], and returned north to sign for [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] in January 2005. The ''Dark Blues'' were struggling in the league, and despite Calum McDonald's goal in a relegation-decider against [[Livingston F.C.|Livingston]], Dundee were demoted to the [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]]. After the game McManus was photographed lying on the pitch in floods of tears. Financial difficulties at Dundee, resultant from relegation and an earlier spell in administration required them to remove the highest-earners from their wage bill and along with [[Lee Wilkie]], McManus negotiated a release settlement in mid-2006.\n\n===Falkirk and Dunfermline Athletic===\nMcManus signed for Falkirk in August 2006,<ref name=\"Falkirk transfer\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/falkirk/5313068.stm|publisher=BBC |work=[[BBC Sport]]|title=McManus wins contract with Bairns|date=8 September 2006}}</ref> but after playing a largely peripheral role in the first half of the [[2006\u201307 in Scottish football|2006\u201307]] season, he was released by the Bairns.<ref name=\"McManus released\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/falkirk/6318517.stm|publisher=BBC Sport website|title=McManus allowed to leave Falkirk|date=31 January 2007}}</ref> Four weeks later, McManus signed a short-term contract with Dunfermline for the remainder of the current season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dunfermline_athletic/6382311.stm|title=Dunfermline sign striker McManus|accessdate=1 January 2008 | work=BBC Sport | date=26 February 2007}}</ref> He scored two goals in six games.
