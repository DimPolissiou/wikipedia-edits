At 12, he found life at home unbearable because of the continuous quarrels with Antonio. Having to face life by himself at such a young age may have developed his later sympathies to help abandoned boys. After begging unsuccessfully for work, Bosco ended up at the wine farm of Louis Moglia.<ref name=\"Lemoyne, Vol I, Chapter 22, Pages 142-152\"/> Although Bosco could pursue some studies by himself, he was not able to attend school for two more years.

His other ministries included visiting prisoners, teaching [[catechism]], and helping out at many country parishes.\n\n===Adulthood===\nAt that time, the city of Turin had a population of 117,000 inhabitants. It reflected the effects of industrialization and urbanization: numerous poor families lived in the slums of the city, having come from the countryside in search of a better life. In visiting the prisons, Don Bosco was disturbed to see so many boys from 12 to 18 years of age. He was determined to find a means to prevent them from ending up here. Because of population growth and migration to the city, Bosco found the traditional methods of parish ministry inefficient. He decided it was necessary to try another form of apostolate, and he began to meet the boys where they worked and gathered in shops and marketplaces. They were pavers, stone-cutters, masons, plasterers who came from far away places, he recalled in his brief ''Memoires.''\n\nThe Oratorio was not simply a charitable institution, and its activities were not limited to Sundays. For Don Bosco, it became his permanent occupation. He looked for jobs for the unemployed. Some of the boys did not have sleeping quarters and slept under bridges or in bleak public dormitories. Twice he tried to provide lodgings in his house. The first time they stole the blankets; the second they emptied the hay-loft. He did not give up. In May 1847, he gave shelter to a young boy from Valencia, in one of the three rooms he was renting in the slums of Valdocco, where he was living with his mother. He and \"Mamma Margherita\" began taking in orphans. The boys sheltered by Don Bosco numbered 36 in 1852, 115 in 1854, 470 in 1860 and 600 in 1861, 800 is the maximum sometime later.<ref name=ewtn>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/DBOSCO.HTM|title=\"Don Bosco's Story\", ewtn}}</ref>\n\nBosco and his oratory moved around town for a number of years; he was turned out of several places in succession. After only two months based in the church of St. Martin, the entire neighborhood expressed its annoyance with the noise coming from the boys at play. A formal complaint was lodged against them with the municipality. Rumors also circulated that the meetings conducted by the priest with his boys were dangerous; their recreation could be turned into a revolution against the government. The group was evicted.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|first=Charles|last=D'Espiney|title=Don Bosco: A Sketch of His Life and Miracles|date=1884|isbn=}}</ref>\n\n===Work with apprentices===\nIn the archives of the Salesian Congregation is a contract of apprenticeship, dated November 1851; another one on stamped paper costing 40 cents, dated February 8, 1852; and others with later dates. These are among the first contracts of apprenticeship to be found in Turin. All of them are signed by the employer, the apprentice, and Don Bosco. In those contracts, Don Bosco touched on many sensitive issues. Some employers customarily made servants and scullery-boys of the apprentices. Don Bosco obliged them to agree to employ the boys only in their acknowledged trade. Employers used to beat the boys. Don Bosco required them to agree that corrections be made only verbally. He cared for their health, and demanded that they are given rest on feast days and that they are given an annual holiday. But in spite of all the efforts and contracts, the situation of the apprentices of the time remained difficult.<ref name=ewtn/>\n\nOne influential friend was the Piedmontese Justice Minister [[Urbano Rattazzi]]. He was [[anticlerical]] in his politics, but he saw some value in Bosco\u2019s work.<ref name=\"This Saint's for You!\">{{cite book|last=Craughwell|first=Thomas J.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bl-2P6HSFVwC|title=This Saint's for You!|pages=156\u2013157|publisher=Quirk Books|date=2007|isbn=9781594741845}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jestice|first=Phyllis G.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H5cQH17-HnMC&pg=PA138&dq=john+bosco+rattazzi|title=Holy People of the World|page=138|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date=2004|isbn=9781576073551}}</ref> While Rattazzi was pushing a bill through the [[Sardinia]]n legislature to suppress religious orders, he advised Bosco on how to get around the law. He found a religious order to keep the oratory going after its founder\u2019s death.<ref name=\"This Saint's for You!\"/> Bosco had been thinking about that problem, too, and had been slowly organizing his helpers into a loose \"Congregation of St. Francis de Sales\". He was also training select older boys for the priesthood. Another supporter of the idea to establish a religious order to carry out Bosco's vision was the reigning pope, [[Pope Pius IX]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Villefranche|first=Jacques-Melchior|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qwsEAAAAYAAJ|title=The Life of Don Bosco: Founder of the Salesian Society|pages=15\u201316|publisher=Burns & Oates|year=1898}}</ref>\n\nBosco disliked the ideals that had been [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|exported by revolutionary France]], calling [[Rousseau]] and [[Voltaire]] \"two vicious leaders of incredulity.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Giovanni Bosco: 'Storia ecclesiastica ad uso delle scuole'|work=Giovanni Bosco: Opere edite.

In 1854, when the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] was about to pass a law suppressing monastic orders and confiscating ecclesiastical properties, Bosco reported a series of dreams about \"great funerals at court\", referring to politicians or members of the Savoy court.<ref name=\"The Dreams of St. John Bosco\">{{cite book|last=Mendl|first=Michael|url=http://www.bosconet.aust.com/DBD.html#ftn.d0e6|title=The Dreams of St. John Bosco|work=Journal of Salesian Studies|volume=12|date=2004|edition=2|pages=321\u2013348|access-date=12 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208225805/http://www.bosconet.aust.com/DBD.html#ftn.d0e6|archive-date=8 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1854, he sent a letter to King [[Victor Emmanuel II]], admonishing him to oppose the confiscation of church property and suppression of the orders, but the King failed to respond.<ref name=\"bosconet.aust.com\">{{cite book|title=Memoirs of the Oratory of Saint Francis de Sales 1815 \u2013 1855: The autobiography of Saint John Bosco|chapter-url=http://www.bosconet.aust.com/moparts/ch55.html|date=6 December 2007|translator=Daniel Lyons SDB|editor1=Eugene Ceria SDB|editor2=Lawrence Castelvecchi SDB|editor3=Michael Mendl SDB|chapter=55|page=802|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206015444/http://www.bosconet.aust.com/moparts/ch55.html|archive-date=6 December 2007}}</ref> His actions, which had been described by Italian historian Erberto Petoia as having \"manifest blackmailing intentions\",<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Medioevo|date=June 2007|first=Erberto|last=Petoia|page=70|title=I sinistri presagi di Don Giovanni Bosco}}</ref> ended only after the intervention of Prime Minister [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]]. The king's family suffered a number of deaths in a short period.

Traditionalist clergy accused him of stealing the young and old people away from their own parishes. Nationalist politicians (including some clergy) saw his several hundred young men as a recruiting ground for revolution. The Marquis de Cavour, chief of police in Turin, regarded the open-air catechisms as overtly political and a threat to the State, and was highly suspicious of Bosco's support for the powers of the papacy. Bosco was interrogated on several occasions, but no charges made. Closure may have been prevented by orders from the king that Bosco was not to be disturbed.<ref>{{harvnb|Butler|1999|loc=Volume I}}</ref>\n\nSeveral attempts were also made on Bosco's life, including a near-stabbing, bludgeoning and a shooting. Early biographers put this down to the growing influence of the [[Waldensians]] in opposition to Catholic clergy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Foundation of the Salesians of Don Bosco===\n[[File:Basilica Don Bosco.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Basilica Don Bosco in [[Castelnuovo Don Bosco]], [[Province of Asti|Asti]]]]\n[[File:Don boscojf.JPG|thumb|right|200px|St. John Bosco Parish Church, [[Makati]], [[Philippines]]]]\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}\n[[File:St Don Bosco 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Statue of Saint John Bosco, [[Ronda]], Spain]]\n[[File:Don boscojfc.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Statue of Saint John Bosco, [[Makati City]], Philippines]]\n[[File:Don Bosco statue at the Shrine of Mary Help of Christians in Calamba, Laguna.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Statue of Saint John Bosco at the Diocesan Shrine of Mary Help of Christians, [[Canlubang]], [[Calamba City]], Philippines]]\n\nSome of the boys helped by Don Bosco decided to do what he was doing, that is, to work in the service of abandoned boys. And this was the origin of the Salesian Congregation. Among the first members were Michael Rua, John Cagliero (who later became a Cardinal), and John Baptist Francesia.<ref name=ewtn/>\n\nIn 1859, Bosco selected the experienced priest Vittorio Alasonatti, 15 seminarians and one high school boy and formed them into the \"Society of St. Francis de Sales.\" This was the nucleus of the Salesians, the religious order that would carry on his work. When the group had their next meeting, they voted on the admission of Joseph Rossi as a lay member, the first Salesian brother. The Salesian Congregation was divided into priests, seminarians and \"coadjutors\" (the lay brothers).\n\nNext, he worked with estarino, [[Mary Mazzarello]] and a group of girls in the hill town of [[Mornese]]. In 1871, he founded a group of religious sisters to do for girls what the Salesians were doing for boys. They were called the \"Daughters of Mary Help of Christians.\" In 1874, he founded yet another group, the \"Salesian Cooperators.\" These were mostly lay people who would work for young people like the Daughters and the Salesians, but would not join a religious order.<ref name=\"PSI\">{{cite web|title=Saint John Bosco|work=Saints.SQPN.com|date=12 August 2010|url=http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-john-bosco/|access-date=9 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe first Salesians departed for [[Argentina]] in 1875. After his ordination, Bosco himself would have become a missionary had not his director, [[Joseph Cafasso]], opposed the idea. He nevertheless eagerly read the Italian edition of the Annals of the Propagation of the Faith and used this magazine to illustrate his ''Cattolico Provveduto'' (1853) and his ''Month of May'' booklets (1858).\n\nWhen Bosco founded the Salesian Society, the thought of the missions still obsessed him, though he completely lacked the financial means at that time. Bosco claimed he had another dream{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} where he was on a vast plain, inhabited by primitive peoples, who spent their time hunting or fighting among themselves or against soldiers in European uniforms. Along came a band of missionaries, but they were all massacred. A second group appeared, which Bosco at once recognized as Salesians. Astonished, he witnessed an unexpected change when the fierce savages laid down their arms and listened to the missionaries. It seems the dream made a great impression on Bosco, because he tried hard to identify the men and the country of the dream \u2013 and for three years collected information about different countries. A request from [[Argentina]], turned him towards the Indians of [[Patagonia]], and a study of the people there convinced him that the country and its inhabitants were the ones he had seen in his dream. Towards the end of 1874, John Bosco received letters from the Argentine consult at Savona requesting that he accept an Italian parish in Buenos Aires and a school for boys at San Nicolas de los Arroyos.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nBosco regarded it as a sign of providence and started to prepare a mission. Adopting a way of evangelization that would not expose his missionaries to wild, \"uncivilized\" tribes, he proposed setting up bases in safe locations which missionary efforts were to be launched. Negotiations started after Archbishop Aneiros of [[Buenos Aires]] had indicated that he would be glad to receive the Salesians. In a ceremony held on 29 January 1875, Bosco was able to convey the great news to the oratory. On 5 February he announced the fact in a circular letter to all Salesians asking volunteers to apply in writing. He proposed that the first missionary departure start in October. There were many volunteers.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Salesian Preventive System and other Works===\n{{Main|Salesian Preventive System}}\nIn the years Don Bosco had spent running his oratory and giving spiritual and practical instruction to the boys he had housed there, he relied on a different approach on education and general instruction which he believed to be superior to traditional educational methods which he labelled as a [[School discipline|Repressive System of Education]]. On March 12, 1877, Bosco gave an opening address on the subject-matter of the systems of education during the day for the opening of the St. Peter's Youth Center in the new quarters of the Patronage de Saint Pierre in [[Nice]], in which he first mentions the term '[[Salesian Preventive System|Preventive System]]'.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Salesian Preventive System of St. John Bosco (Don Bosco) (Educational Philosophy of Don Bosco - Don Bosco's Way, Style, Approach, Method, System, etc... of Educating and Accompanying Young People Today) |url=http://www.donboscowest.org/pedagogy/preventive-system |website=http://www.donboscowest.org/ |publisher=Don Bosco West |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> Upon his return to [[Turin]], don Bosco wrote down the address as a polished essay under the title ''The Preventive System in the Education of the Youth'' which was published in 1877, which he included in the initial draft of the Rule for the Salesian Order.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bosco |first1=Giovanni Melchor |title=Regolamento per le case della Societ\u00e0 di S.

Though the idea itself was not innovative by any means, Bosco having drawn the inspiration for his system through the contemporary criticisms of the punitive and outdated educational systems prevalent in Europe during his time, he was one of the first to combat and put these criticisms into practice.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Frith-Powell |first1=Louise |title=The \"Preventive System\": Walking Alongside |url=https://humanumreview.com/articles/the-preventive-system-walking-alongside |website=humanumreview.com |publisher=Humanum Revieww |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref>  \n\nThough Don Bosco's written works were little known outside of his own Order and the subscribers of his [[Salesian Bulletin]], which he founded on August 1877, he wrote frequently and voluminously.

His funeral was attended by thousands. Soon after there was popular demand to have him canonized.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The Archdiocese of Turin investigated and witnesses were called to determine if Bosco was worthy to be declared a saint. The Salesians, Daughters and Cooperators gave supportive testimonies. But many remembered Bosco's controversies in the 1870s with Archbishop Gastaldi and some others high in the Church hierarchy thought him a loose cannon and a \"wheeler-dealer\". In the [[canonization]] process, testimony was heard about how he went around Gastaldi to get some of his men ordained and about their lack of academic preparation and ecclesiastical decorum. [[Political cartoon]]s from the 1860s and later showed him shaking money from the pockets of old ladies or going off to America for the same purpose. These cartoons were not forgotten. Opponents of Bosco, including some [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], were in a position to block his canonization. \n\n[[Pope Pius XI]] had known Bosco and pushed the cause forward.

At 12, he found life at home unbearable because of the continuous quarrels with Antonio. Having to face life by himself at such a young age may have developed his later sympathies to help abandoned boys. After begging unsuccessfully for work, Bosco ended up at the wine farm of Louis Moglia.<ref name=\"Lemoyne, Vol I, Chapter 22, Pages 142-152\"/> Although Bosco could pursue some studies by himself, he was not able to attend school for two more years.

His other ministries included visiting prisoners, teaching [[catechism]], and helping out at many country parishes.\n\n===Adulthood===\nAt that time, the city of Turin had a population of 117,000 inhabitants. It reflected the effects of industrialization and urbanization: numerous poor families lived in the slums of the city, having come from the countryside in search of a better life. In visiting the prisons, Don Bosco was disturbed to see so many boys from 12 to 18 years of age. He was determined to find a means to prevent them from ending up here. Because of population growth and migration to the city, Bosco found the traditional methods of parish ministry inefficient. He decided it was necessary to try another form of apostolate, and he began to meet the boys where they worked and gathered in shops and marketplaces. They were pavers, stone-cutters, masons, plasterers who came from far away places, he recalled in his brief ''Memoires.''\n\nThe Oratorio was not simply a charitable institution, and its activities were not limited to Sundays. For Don Bosco, it became his permanent occupation. He looked for jobs for the unemployed. Some of the boys did not have sleeping quarters and slept under bridges or in bleak public dormitories. Twice he tried to provide lodgings in his house. The first time they stole the blankets; the second they emptied the hay-loft. He did not give up. In May 1847, he gave shelter to a young boy from Valencia, in one of the three rooms he was renting in the slums of Valdocco, where he was living with his mother. He and \"Mamma Margherita\" began taking in orphans. The boys sheltered by Don Bosco numbered 36 in 1852, 115 in 1854, 470 in 1860 and 600 in 1861, 800 is the maximum sometime later.<ref name=ewtn>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/DBOSCO.HTM|title=\"Don Bosco's Story\", ewtn}}</ref>\n\nBosco and his oratory moved around town for a number of years; he was turned out of several places in succession. After only two months based in the church of St. Martin, the entire neighborhood expressed its annoyance with the noise coming from the boys at play. A formal complaint was lodged against them with the municipality. Rumors also circulated that the meetings conducted by the priest with his boys were dangerous; their recreation could be turned into a revolution against the government. The group was evicted.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|first=Charles|last=D'Espiney|title=Don Bosco: A Sketch of His Life and Miracles|date=1884|isbn=}}</ref>\n\n===Work with apprentices===\nIn the archives of the Salesian Congregation is a contract of apprenticeship, dated November 1851; another one on stamped paper costing 40 cents, dated February 8, 1852; and others with later dates. These are among the first contracts of apprenticeship to be found in Turin. All of them are signed by the employer, the apprentice, and Don Bosco. In those contracts, Don Bosco touched on many sensitive issues. Some employers customarily made servants and scullery-boys of the apprentices. Don Bosco obliged them to agree to employ the boys only in their acknowledged trade. Employers used to beat the boys. Don Bosco required them to agree that corrections be made only verbally. He cared for their health, and demanded that they are given rest on feast days and that they are given an annual holiday. But in spite of all the efforts and contracts, the situation of the apprentices of the time remained difficult.<ref name=ewtn/>\n\nOne influential friend was the Piedmontese Justice Minister [[Urbano Rattazzi]].

He found a religious order to keep the oratory going after its founder\u2019s death.<ref name=\"This Saint's for You!\"/> Bosco had been thinking about that problem, too, and had been slowly organizing his helpers into a loose \"Congregation of St. Francis de Sales\". He was also training select older boys for the priesthood. Another supporter of the idea to establish a religious order to carry out Bosco's vision was the reigning pope, [[Pope Pius IX]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Villefranche|first=Jacques-Melchior|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qwsEAAAAYAAJ|title=The Life of Don Bosco: Founder of the Salesian Society|pages=15\u201316|publisher=Burns & Oates|year=1898}}</ref>\n\nBosco disliked the ideals that had been [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|exported by revolutionary France]], calling [[Rousseau]] and [[Voltaire]] \"two vicious leaders of incredulity.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Giovanni Bosco: 'Storia ecclesiastica ad uso delle scuole'|work=Giovanni Bosco: Opere edite.

The king's family suffered a number of deaths in a short period. From January to May 1855, [[Maria Theresa of Austria (1801-1855)|the king's mother (age 54)]], [[Adelaide of Austria|wife (32)]], newborn son (Vittorio Emanuele, Count of Genoa; nearly four months old), and [[Prince Ferdinand, Duke of Genoa|his only brother (32)]] all died.<ref name=\"The Dreams of St. John Bosco\"/><ref name=\"bosconet.aust.com\"/>\n\nOpposition to Bosco and his work came from various quarters. Traditionalist clergy accused him of stealing the young and old people away from their own parishes. Nationalist politicians (including some clergy) saw his several hundred young men as a recruiting ground for revolution. The Marquis de Cavour, chief of police in Turin, regarded the open-air catechisms as overtly political and a threat to the State, and was highly suspicious of Bosco's support for the powers of the papacy. Bosco was interrogated on several occasions, but no charges made. Closure may have been prevented by orders from the king that Bosco was not to be disturbed.<ref>{{harvnb|Butler|1999|loc=Volume I}}</ref>\n\nSeveral attempts were also made on Bosco's life, including a near-stabbing, bludgeoning and a shooting. Early biographers put this down to the growing influence of the [[Waldensians]] in opposition to Catholic clergy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Foundation of the Salesians of Don Bosco===\n[[File:Basilica Don Bosco.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Basilica Don Bosco in [[Castelnuovo Don Bosco]], [[Province of Asti|Asti]]]]\n[[File:Don boscojf.JPG|thumb|right|200px|St. John Bosco Parish Church, [[Makati]], [[Philippines]]]]\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}\n[[File:St Don Bosco 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Statue of Saint John Bosco, [[Ronda]], Spain]]\n[[File:Don boscojfc.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Statue of Saint John Bosco, [[Makati City]], Philippines]]\n[[File:Don Bosco statue at the Shrine of Mary Help of Christians in Calamba, Laguna.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Statue of Saint John Bosco at the Diocesan Shrine of Mary Help of Christians, [[Canlubang]], [[Calamba City]], Philippines]]\n\nSome of the boys helped by Don Bosco decided to do what he was doing, that is, to work in the service of abandoned boys. And this was the origin of the Salesian Congregation. Among the first members were Michael Rua, John Cagliero (who later became a Cardinal), and John Baptist Francesia.<ref name=ewtn/>\n\nIn 1859, Bosco selected the experienced priest Vittorio Alasonatti, 15 seminarians and one high school boy and formed them into the \"Society of St. Francis de Sales.\" This was the nucleus of the Salesians, the religious order that would carry on his work. When the group had their next meeting, they voted on the admission of Joseph Rossi as a lay member, the first Salesian brother. The Salesian Congregation was divided into priests, seminarians and \"coadjutors\" (the lay brothers).\n\nNext, he worked with estarino, [[Mary Mazzarello]] and a group of girls in the hill town of [[Mornese]]. In 1871, he founded a group of religious sisters to do for girls what the Salesians were doing for boys. They were called the \"Daughters of Mary Help of Christians.\" In 1874, he founded yet another group, the \"Salesian Cooperators.\" These were mostly lay people who would work for young people like the Daughters and the Salesians, but would not join a religious order.<ref name=\"PSI\">{{cite web|title=Saint John Bosco|work=Saints.SQPN.com|date=12 August 2010|url=http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-john-bosco/|access-date=9 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe first Salesians departed for [[Argentina]] in 1875. After his ordination, Bosco himself would have become a missionary had not his director, [[Joseph Cafasso]], opposed the idea. He nevertheless eagerly read the Italian edition of the Annals of the Propagation of the Faith and used this magazine to illustrate his ''Cattolico Provveduto'' (1853) and his ''Month of May'' booklets (1858).\n\nWhen Bosco founded the Salesian Society, the thought of the missions still obsessed him, though he completely lacked the financial means at that time. Bosco claimed he had another dream{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} where he was on a vast plain, inhabited by primitive peoples, who spent their time hunting or fighting among themselves or against soldiers in European uniforms. Along came a band of missionaries, but they were all massacred. A second group appeared, which Bosco at once recognized as Salesians. Astonished, he witnessed an unexpected change when the fierce savages laid down their arms and listened to the missionaries. It seems the dream made a great impression on Bosco, because he tried hard to identify the men and the country of the dream \u2013 and for three years collected information about different countries. A request from [[Argentina]], turned him towards the Indians of [[Patagonia]], and a study of the people there convinced him that the country and its inhabitants were the ones he had seen in his dream. Towards the end of 1874, John Bosco received letters from the Argentine consult at Savona requesting that he accept an Italian parish in Buenos Aires and a school for boys at San Nicolas de los Arroyos.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nBosco regarded it as a sign of providence and started to prepare a mission. Adopting a way of evangelization that would not expose his missionaries to wild, \"uncivilized\" tribes, he proposed setting up bases in safe locations which missionary efforts were to be launched. Negotiations started after Archbishop Aneiros of [[Buenos Aires]] had indicated that he would be glad to receive the Salesians. In a ceremony held on 29 January 1875, Bosco was able to convey the great news to the oratory. On 5 February he announced the fact in a circular letter to all Salesians asking volunteers to apply in writing. He proposed that the first missionary departure start in October. There were many volunteers.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Salesian Preventive System and other Works===\n{{Main|Salesian Preventive System}}\nIn the years Don Bosco had spent running his oratory and giving spiritual and practical instruction to the boys he had housed there, he relied on a different approach on education and general instruction which he believed to be superior to traditional educational methods which he labelled as a [[School discipline|Repressive System of Education]]. On March 12, 1877, Bosco gave an opening address on the subject-matter of the systems of education during the day for the opening of the St. Peter's Youth Center in the new quarters of the Patronage de Saint Pierre in [[Nice]], in which he first mentions the term '[[Salesian Preventive System|Preventive System]]'.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Salesian Preventive System of St. John Bosco (Don Bosco) (Educational Philosophy of Don Bosco - Don Bosco's Way, Style, Approach, Method, System, etc... of Educating and Accompanying Young People Today) |url=http://www.donboscowest.org/pedagogy/preventive-system |website=http://www.donboscowest.org/ |publisher=Don Bosco West |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> Upon his return to [[Turin]], don Bosco wrote down the address as a polished essay under the title ''The Preventive System in the Education of the Youth'' which was published in 1877, which he included in the initial draft of the Rule for the Salesian Order.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bosco |first1=Giovanni Melchor |title=Regolamento per le case della Societ\u00e0 di S.

Though the idea itself was not innovative by any means, Bosco having drawn the inspiration for his system through the contemporary criticisms of the punitive and outdated educational systems prevalent in Europe during his time, he was one of the first to combat and put these criticisms into practice.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Frith-Powell |first1=Louise |title=The \"Preventive System\": Walking Alongside |url=https://humanumreview.com/articles/the-preventive-system-walking-alongside |website=humanumreview.com |publisher=Humanum Revieww |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref>  \n\nThough Don Bosco's written works were little known outside of his own Order and the subscribers of his [[Salesian Bulletin]], which he founded on August 1877, he wrote frequently and voluminously. Though Don Bosco was described as more of a man of action than a scholar<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nanni |first1=Carlo |title=Il Sistema Preventivo di Don Bosco |journal=Elledici |date=2003 |page=7}}</ref>, he was an exceptional historian. He penned the 1881 ''\"A Compendium of Italian History from the Fall of the Roman Empire\"'' which was translated and continued to the present time by [[John Daniel Morell]], and was noted by scholars for its cultural importance on the knowledge base of ancient to modern civilization.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bosco |first1=Giovanni Melchor |title=A Compendium of Italian History from the Fall of the Roman Empire, Tr. and Completed to the Present Time by J.D.

His funeral was attended by thousands. Soon after there was popular demand to have him canonized.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The Archdiocese of Turin investigated and witnesses were called to determine if Bosco was worthy to be declared a saint. The Salesians, Daughters and Cooperators gave supportive testimonies. But many remembered Bosco's controversies in the 1870s with Archbishop Gastaldi and some others high in the Church hierarchy thought him a loose cannon and a \"wheeler-dealer\". In the [[canonization]] process, testimony was heard about how he went around Gastaldi to get some of his men ordained and about their lack of academic preparation and ecclesiastical decorum. [[Political cartoon]]s from the 1860s and later showed him shaking money from the pockets of old ladies or going off to America for the same purpose. These cartoons were not forgotten. Opponents of Bosco, including some [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], were in a position to block his canonization. \n\n[[Pope Pius XI]] had known Bosco and pushed the cause forward.

It was arrogant to think we could build a mirror image of ourselves in foreign lands. [The boys\u2019 deaths] underscored the gap between our aims and reality. The two boys who perished were bystanders in this larger struggle. I was humbled and chastened by this experience. War is a miserable enterprise.

Suicide bomber capture ====\nIntelligence gathering operations constantly scanned for \"chatter\" on plans for suicide bombings by the Taliban. To interdict these operations, Hastie was required to work with local forces, however by May the Wakunish were now working independently, so Australia's forces need to work with the Provincial Response Company<ref name=\":2\" /> with whom they had few shared values. One of the first missions with the PRC was to capture a suicide bomber in [[Urozgan Province|Urozgan]] before he had the opportunity to attack. The operation was conducted in darkness \"When they found the suicide bomber they were chasing, a barrel pressed against his temple was used to ease the man awake.\" Now the enemy was secure, along with his explosive vest, and rockets, the PRC commanders, and their own magistrate, had a stand off with Hastie \u2014 insisting that they should execute the captured man.<ref name=\":2\" /> The \"person under confinement\" was escorted to prison by Hastie and his team. \n\n==== 5. Truck bomb ====\nHastie's B Company received intelligence of a Taliban plan to use a truck to enter their own [[Forward operating base]]. The order was given for all personnel to put on armour and helmets if they were moving outside of secure buildings. An airstrike was considered once the exact location of the bomber was found, however, it was decided to neutralise the threat using Hastie's unit, on the ground. The force element was flown in on two Australian [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]]<nowiki/>s, the bomber located and killed, and the team extracted. From wheels down to wheels up had taken 22 minutes. There were no force injuries or casualties.<blockquote>It was the SOTG machine at its most efficient and precise. When we got back and the order was given to all on base that they could take off the body armour and helmets when outside there was a sigh of relief. There was no doubt about that mission. We were protecting the base from attack. We just thought of Aussie diggers, aid workers, [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|DFAT]] and everyone else supporting us behind the wire.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].

The order was given for all personnel to put on armour and helmets if they were moving outside of secure buildings. An airstrike was considered once the exact location of the bomber was found, however, it was decided to neutralise the threat using Hastie's unit, on the ground. The force element was flown in on two Australian [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]]<nowiki/>s, the bomber located and killed, and the team extracted. From wheels down to wheels up had taken 22 minutes. There were no force injuries or casualties.<blockquote>It was the SOTG machine at its most efficient and precise.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place.

She was well-educated for a woman in her era, and knew French, Spanish, and Italian. She was a member of the Sidney/Essex circle from birth, through her father, first cousin to Sir [[Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Sidney]] and [[Mary Sidney|Mary, Countess of Pembroke]]; she was a close friend of Essex's sisters [[Penelope Blount, Countess of Devonshire|Penelope Rich]] and [[Dorothy Percy, Countess of Northumberland]], and the latter named one of her daughters Lucy after her.\n\nLucy Harington married [[Edward Russell, 3rd Earl of Bedford]], on 12 December 1594, when she was thirteen years old and he was twenty-two, at [[St Dunstan's, Stepney|St Dunstan's on Stepney Green]]. She miscarried her first child in February 1596 at Bedford House on the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in London.<ref>Lesley Lawson, ''Out of the Shadows'' (London, 2007), pp. 19, 28.</ref>\n\nThe Earl of Bedford got himself into serious trouble in 1601 when he rode with the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] in rebellion against Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. The Bedford fortunes revived when the reign of [[James I of England|James I]] began in 1603. Several English nobles secretly sent representatives into Scotland to try to gain favour and court appointments.<ref>''Journal of Sir Roger Wilbraham'' (London, 1902), p. 55.</ref> The Countess of Bedford audaciously skipped the late queen's funeral and rode hard to the Scottish border, ahead of a party of gentlewomen appointed by the [[Privy Council]], and got an audience in Scotland with the new king's wife [[Anne of Denmark]]. The new queen immediately made her a [[Lady of the Bedchamber]] and she became a trusted confidant.<ref>John Leeds Barroll, ''Anna of Denmark, Queen of England'' (Philadelphia, 2001), pp. 43-45.</ref>\n\n==Masquing==\nBedford performed in several of the [[masque]]s staged at Court in the early 17th century, including ''[[The Masque of Blackness]]'', ''[[Hymenaei]]'', ''[[The Masque of Beauty]]'', ''[[The Masque of Queens]]'', and ''[[The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses]]''. On two occassions in 1617, she functioned as a theatrical producer, instigating and organising the 1617 Court performance of [[Robert White (fl. 1617)|Robert White's]] masque ''Cupid's Banishment'', acted by students from the first English girls' school, the [[Ladies Hall]] in [[Deptford]]. In February 1617 the masque by [[Ben Jonson]] presented by [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle|Lord Hay]] to the French ambassador [[Charles Cauchon de Maupas|Baron de Tour]], the ''[[Lovers Made Men]]'', was staged by the Countess of Bedford.<ref>Norman Egbert McClure, ''The Letters of John Chamberlain'', vol. 2 (Philadelphia, 1939), pp. 51, 55, 57.</ref>\n\n==Patronage==\n'''Jonson'''<br>\nShe was a noted patron of [[Ben Jonson]], who dedicated his play ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]'' (1600) to her and addressed several of his ''Epigrams'' to her, extolling her patronage. By his own admission, Jonson portrayed her as Ethra in his lost pastoral, ''The May Lord'' \u2014 though he may also have depicted her as Lady Haughty, president of the Collegiates in [[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman|''Epicene'']] (1609). When Jonson was imprisoned in 1605 for his role in the ''[[Eastward Ho]]'' scandal, he wrote a letter to an unknown lady, who is thought by some scholars to have been the Countess of Bedford.<ref>Joseph, p. 98.</ref>\n\n'''Others'''<br>\nIn addition to Jonson, Bedford supported other significant poets of her era, including [[Michael Drayton]], [[Samuel Daniel]], [[George Chapman]], and [[John Donne]]. She might be the \"Idea\" of Drayton's pastoral ''Idea: The Shepherd's Garland'' (1593) and of his sonnet sequence ''Idea's Mirror'' (1594). Drayton dedicated his ''Mortimeriados'' (1594) to her, as Daniel did his ''Vision of the Twelve Goddesses'' (1604). Bedford patronised a range of lesser writers of her era, including the translator [[John Florio]], who credited her help in his translation of the essays of [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]]. She \"received more dedications than any other woman associated with the drama\" in her era.<ref>Bergeron, p. 82.</ref>\n\nBedford was the godmother of Donne's second daughter, also named Lucy, and the namesake of Sir Henry Goodere's daughter (later wife of Sir Francis Nethersole). Donne seems to have been deeply involved with her on a psychological level \u2014 \"Most of the poems of Donne's middle years relate, in one way or another, to this glamorous and intriguing woman.\"<ref>Carey, p. xxvii.</ref> Her contradictions could be provocative: the Countess was a dedicated [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], and supported many Calvinist authors and thinkers \u2013 yet she allegedly performed bare-breasted in Court masques. Her relationships with some of her poets, including Donne and Drayton, were sometimes uneven; poets who dedicated their works to her could also complain of the loss of her favour.\n\nShe was also receptive to women poets, such as her cousin [[Cecily Bulstrode]]. Bedford occasionally wrote poems herself, including a poem Donne claims he saw in the garden of her Twickenham estate. Only one of her poems is extant, \"Death be not proud, thy hand gave not this blow\", an epitaph on Bulstrode. This poem has been attributed to Donne, and suggestively shares an opening clause with his [[Death Be Not Proud (poem)|Holy Sonnet X]]; nevertheless, it is now considered much more likely to be Bedford's poem. Bedford certainly wrote an elegy on the death of her cousin [[Bridget Markham]] at Twickenham Park in 1609.<ref>See external links.</ref>\n\nWhile best remembered for her patronage of writers, Bedford also supported musicians, [[John Dowland]] being a noteworthy example. She is the dedicatee of Dowland's ''[[Second Booke of Songes or Ayres|Second Book of Songs]]'' (1600).\n\nA few scholars have identified the Earl and Countess of Bedford as the allegorised couple in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Phoenix and the Turtle]],'' who left \"no posterity\" (line 59) \u2014 yet since the poem was published in 1601, when the Countess was only twenty years old, the identification has struck others as unlikely.\n\n'''Gardens'''<br>\nShe was a significant figure in the development of English country-house and garden design, centering on her estates at [[Twickenham Park]] and [[Moor Park (house)|Moor Park]]. An Italian writer [[Giacomo Castelvetro]] dedicated a book on fruit and vegetables to her.<ref>Joan Thirsk,''Food in Early Modern England'' (London, 2007), p. 67.</ref> She described her building and improvements at Moor Park in a letter to a friend; \"my works att the More, whear I have been a patcher this sommer and I am still adding some trifles of pleasure to that place I am so much love with, as I were so fond of any man I were in hard case.\"<ref>Lord Braybrooke, ''The Private Correspondence of Jane Lady Cornwallis'' (London, 1842), p. 48.</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAs one of the most influential women at James's court, she was also involved in a range of political issues; in the later part of the reign she was among the most prominent supporters of [[Elizabeth of Bohemia]], who had been brought up in her father's household at [[Coombe Abbey]].\n\nHer husband, the Earl of Bedford fell from his horse in July 1613 and was seriously injured.<ref>Lesley Lawson, ''Out of the Shadows'' (London, 2007), pp. 121-2.</ref> The Countess gave up a plan to travel to [[Spa, Belgium]] for her health. [[John Chamberlain (letter writer)|John Chamberlain]] wrote that she came back to the royal court, but affected by grief she used less cosmetics than the other women at court, \"Marry, she is somewhat reformed in her attire, and forebears painting, which they say makes her somewhat strange among so many vizards, which together with their frizzled powdered hair makes them look all alike, so you can scant know one from another at first view.\"<ref>[[Thomas Birch]] & Robert Folkestone Williams, [https://archive.org/details/courtandtimesja00willgoog/page/n286/mode/2up ''The Court and times of James the First'', vol. 1 (London, 1848), p. 262.]</ref> \n\nIn 1617 she was godmother of Elizabeth Gordon, daughter of [[Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet|Sir Robert Gordon of Gordonstoun]] and Louisa Gordon whose mother [[Genevi\u00e8ve Petau de Maulette]] is said to have taught French to Elizabeth of Bohemia. The other godparents were the [[Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford|Earl of Hertford]] and [[Jean Ker, Countess of Roxburghe|Jean Drummond, Countess of Roxburghe]].<ref>Robert Gordon, ''Genealogical history of the Earldom of Sutherland'' (Edinburgh, 1813), p. 343.</ref>\n\nProminent as she was, both Bedford and her husband had serious financial problems throughout their lives. Lady Bedford reportedly had debts of \u00a350,000 in 1619, apart from the Earl's massive indebtedness.\n\nThe court physician [[Th\u00e9odore de Mayerne]] noted she had \"podagra\" or [[gout]].<ref>Henry Ellis, ''Original Letters'', 2nd series vol. 3 (London, 1827), p. 247.</ref> In 1619 he treated her for the [[smallpox]] that blinded her in one eye, and in 1620 treated her for depression which he recorded as \"hypochondriacus\".<ref>Lesley Lawson, ''Out of the Shadows'' (London, 2007), pp. 149-51, 155.</ref>\n\nLucy, Countess of Bedford died in the same month as her husband, May 1627.
