{"title_page": "Nuclear operator", "text_new": "Nuclear operators are an important class of linear operators introduced by [[Alexander Grothendieck]] in his doctoral dissertation. Nuclear operators are intimately tied to the [[projective tensor product]] of two [[Topological Vector Space]]s (TVSs). \n\n== Preliminaries ==\nThroughout let ''X'',''Y'', and ''Z'' be [[topological vector space]]s and <math>L : X \\to Y</math> be a linear map. \n\n* <math>L : X \\to Y</math> is a '''topological homomorphism''' or '''homomorphism''', if it is linear, continuous, and <math>L : X \\to \\operatorname{Im} L</math> is an [[open map]], where <math>\\operatorname{Im} L</math>, the image of ''L'', has the subspace topology induced by ''Y''. \n** If ''S'' is a subspace of ''X'' then both the quotient map <math>X \\to X / S</math> and the canonical injection <math>S \\to X</math> are homomorphisms. In particular, any linear map <math>L : X \\to Y</math> can be canonically decomposed as follows: <math>X \\to X / \\operatorname{ker} L \\overset{L_0}{\\rightarrow} \\operatorname{Im} L \\to Y</math> where <math>L_0\\left( x + \\operatorname{ker} L \\right) := L (x)</math> defines a bijection. \n* The set of continuous linear maps <math>X \\to Z</math> (resp. continuous bilinear maps <math>X \\times Y \\to Z</math>) will be denoted by ''L(X, Z)'' (resp. ''B(X, Y; Z)'') where if ''Z'' is the scalar field then we may instead write ''L(X)'' (resp. ''B(X, Y)''). \n* We will denote the continuous dual space of ''X'' by X* or <math>X^{\\prime}</math> and the algebraic dual space (which is the vector space of all linear functionals on ''X'', whether continuous or not) by <math>X^{\\#}</math>. \n** To increase the clarity of the exposition, we use the common convention of writing elements of <math>X^{\\prime}</math> with a prime following the symbol (e.g. <math>x^{\\prime}</math> denotes an element of <math>X^{\\prime}</math> and not, say, a derivative and the variables ''x'' and <math>x^{\\prime}</math> need not be related in any way). \n* A linear map <math>L : H \\to H</math> from a Hilbert space into itself is called '''positive''' if <math>\\langle L(x), X \\rangle \\geq 0</math> for every <math>x \\in H</math>. In this case, there is a unique positive map <math>r : H \\to H</math>, called the '''square-root''' of <math>L</math>, such that <math>L = r \\circ r</math>.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=488}} \n** If <math>L : H_1 \\to H_2</math> is any continuous linear map between Hilbert spaces, then <math>L^* \\circ L</math> is always positive. Now let <math>R : H \\to H</math> denote its positive square-root, which is called the '''absolute value''' of ''L''. Define <math>U : H_1 \\to H_2</math> first on <math>\\operatorname{Im} R</math> by setting <math>U(x) = L(x)</math> for <math>x = R \\left( x_1 \\right) \\in \\operatorname{Im} R</math> and extending <math>U</math> continuously to <math>\\overline{\\operatorname{Im} R}</math>, and then define ''U'' on <math>\\operatorname{ker} R</math> by setting <math>U(x) = 0</math> for <math>x \\in \\operatorname{ker} R</math> and extend this map linearly to all of <math>H_1</math>. The map <math>U\\big\\vert_{\\operatorname{Im} R} : \\operatorname{Im} R \\to \\operatorname{Im} L</math> is a surjective isometry and <math>L = U \\circ R</math>. \n* A linear map <math>\\Lambda : X \\to Y</math> is called '''compact''' or '''completely continuous''' if there is a neighborhood ''U'' of the origin in ''X'' such that <math>\\Lambda(U)</math> is [[precompact]] in ''Y''.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=483}}\n** In a Hilbert space, positive compact linear operators, say <math>L : H \\to H</math> have a simple spectral decomposition discovered at the beginning of the 20th century by Fredholm and F.

In particular, any linear map <math>L : X \\to Y</math> can be canonically decomposed as follows: <math>X \\to X / \\operatorname{ker} L \\overset{L_0}{\\rightarrow} \\operatorname{Im} L \\to Y</math> where <math>L_0\\left( x + \\operatorname{ker} L \\right) := L (x)</math> defines a bijection. \n* The set of continuous linear maps <math>X \\to Z</math> (resp. continuous bilinear maps <math>X \\times Y \\to Z</math>) will be denoted by ''L(X, Z)'' (resp. ''B(X, Y; Z)'') where if ''Z'' is the scalar field then we may instead write ''L(X)'' (resp. ''B(X, Y)''). \n* We will denote the continuous dual space of ''X'' by X* or <math>X^{\\prime}</math> and the algebraic dual space (which is the vector space of all linear functionals on ''X'', whether continuous or not) by <math>X^{\\#}</math>. \n** To increase the clarity of the exposition, we use the common convention of writing elements of <math>X^{\\prime}</math> with a prime following the symbol (e.g. <math>x^{\\prime}</math> denotes an element of <math>X^{\\prime}</math> and not, say, a derivative and the variables ''x'' and <math>x^{\\prime}</math> need not be related in any way). \n* A linear map <math>L : H \\to H</math> from a Hilbert space into itself is called '''positive''' if <math>\\langle L(x), X \\rangle \\geq 0</math> for every <math>x \\in H</math>. In this case, there is a unique positive map <math>r : H \\to H</math>, called the '''square-root''' of <math>L</math>, such that <math>L = r \\circ r</math>.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=488}} \n** If <math>L : H_1 \\to H_2</math> is any continuous linear map between Hilbert spaces, then <math>L^* \\circ L</math> is always positive. Now let <math>R : H \\to H</math> denote its positive square-root, which is called the '''absolute value''' of ''L''. Define <math>U : H_1 \\to H_2</math> first on <math>\\operatorname{Im} R</math> by setting <math>U(x) = L(x)</math> for <math>x = R \\left( x_1 \\right) \\in \\operatorname{Im} R</math> and extending <math>U</math> continuously to <math>\\overline{\\operatorname{Im} R}</math>, and then define ''U'' on <math>\\operatorname{ker} R</math> by setting <math>U(x) = 0</math> for <math>x \\in \\operatorname{ker} R</math> and extend this map linearly to all of <math>H_1</math>. The map <math>U\\big\\vert_{\\operatorname{Im} R} : \\operatorname{Im} R \\to \\operatorname{Im} L</math> is a surjective isometry and <math>L = U \\circ R</math>. \n* A linear map <math>\\Lambda : X \\to Y</math> is called '''compact''' or '''completely continuous''' if there is a neighborhood ''U'' of the origin in ''X'' such that <math>\\Lambda(U)</math> is [[precompact]] in ''Y''.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=483}}\n** In a Hilbert space, positive compact linear operators, say <math>L : H \\to H</math> have a simple spectral decomposition discovered at the beginning of the 20th century by Fredholm and F.

This gives us a canonical tensor product of ''X'' and ''Y''. \n\nIf ''Z'' is any other vector space then the mapping <math>Li(X \\otimes Y; Z) \\to Bi(X, Y; Z)</math> given by <math>u \\mapsto u \\circ \\chi</math> is an isomorphism of vector spaces. In particular, this allows us to identify the [[algebraic dual]] of ''X \u2297 Y'' with the space of bilinear forms on <math>X \\times Y</math>.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=92}} Moreover, if ''X'' and ''Y'' are locally convex [[Topological Vector Space]]s (TVSs) and if ''X \u2297 Y'' is given the \ud835\udf0b-topology then for every locally convex TVS ''Z'', this map restricts to a vector space isomorphism <math>L(X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y; Z) \\to B(X, Y; Z)</math> from the space of ''continuous'' linear mappings onto the space of ''continuous'' bilinear mappings.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=93}} In particular, the continuous dual of ''X \u2297 Y'' can be canonically identified with the space ''B(X, Y)'' of continuous bilinear forms on <math>X \\times Y</math>; furthermore, under this identification the [[equicontinuous]] subsets of ''B(X, Y)'' are the same as the equicontinuous subsets of ''<math>(X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y)^{\\prime}</math>.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=93}}\n\n== Nuclear operators between Banach spaces ==\n{{Main|Nuclear operators between Banach spaces|Projective tensor product}}\nThere is a canonical vector space embedding <math>I : X^{\\prime} \\otimes Y \\to L(X; Y)</math> defined by sending <math>z := \\sum_{i}^n x_i^{\\prime} \\otimes y_i</math> to the map\n: <math>x \\mapsto \\sum_{i}^n x_i^{\\prime}(x) y_i</math>.\nAssuming that ''X'' and ''Y'' are Banach spaces, then the map <math>I : X^{\\prime}_b \\otimes_{\\pi} Y \\to L_b(X; Y)</math> has norm <math>1</math> (to see this, note that <math>\\| I(z) \\| = \\sup_{\\| x \\| \\leq 1} \\| I(z)(x) \\| = \\sup_{\\| x \\| \\leq 1} \\left\\| \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{\\prime}(x) y_i \\right\\| \\leq \\sup_{\\| x \\| \\leq 1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left\\| x_i^{\\prime} \\right\\| \\|x\\| \\left\\| y_i \\right\\| \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left\\| x_i^{\\prime} \\right\\| \\left\\| y_i \\right\\|</math> so that <math>\\| I(z) \\| \\leq \\| z \\|_{\\pi}</math>).

Directed by [[Marc Forster]] and written by [[Paul Haggis]], [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade]], it is a direct sequel to [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|''Casino Royale'']], and the second film to star [[Daniel Craig]] as the fictional [[MI6]] agent [[James Bond]]. The film also stars [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Mathieu Amalric]], [[Gemma Arterton]], [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]], and [[Judi Dench]].  In the film, Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, [[Vesper Lynd]], and is assisted by [[Camille Montes]], who is plotting revenge for the murder of her own family.  The trail eventually leads them to wealthy businessman [[Dominic Greene]], a member of the [[Quantum (James Bond)|Quantum]] organisation<!-- \"Organisation\" is British spelling, and the article uses British spelling -->, which intends to stage a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' in Bolivia to [[Water privatization in Bolivia|seize control of their water supply]]. \n\nProducer [[Michael G. Wilson]] developed the film's plot while the previous film in the series, [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|''Casino Royale'']], was being shot.  Purvis, Wade, and Haggis contributed to the script.  Although Craig and Forster wrote some sections themselves during the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike|screenwriter strike]],<ref name=Goldberg /> they received no such credits in the final cut.  The title was chosen from a 1959<!-- The story was first published in November 1959 in ''Modern Woman's Magazine'', q.v. For Your Eyes Only (short story collection) for the citation --> short story in [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', though the film does not contain any elements of that story.  Location filming took place in Mexico, Panama, Chile, Italy, Austria and Wales, while interior sets were built and filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]].  Forster aimed to make a modern film that also featured classic cinema motifs: a vintage [[Douglas DC-3]] was used for a flight sequence, and [[Dennis Gassner]]'s set designs are reminiscent of [[Ken Adam]]'s work on several early ''Bond'' films.  Taking a course away from the usual [[List of James Bond villains|Bond villains]], Forster rejected any grotesque appearance for the character Dominic Greene to emphasise the hidden and secret nature of the film's contemporary villains.\n\nThe film was also marked by its frequent depictions of violence, with a 2012 study by the [[University of Otago]] in New Zealand finding it to be the most violent film in the franchise.  Whereas ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' featured 109 \"trivial or severely violent\" acts, ''Quantum of Solace'' had a count of 250\u2014the most depictions of violence in any ''Bond'' film\u2014even more prominent since it was also the shortest film in the franchise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/2012/sean-connery-was-the-girliest-bond/|title=Sean Connery was the girliest Bond|publisher=Meeja|date=10 December 2012|accessdate=6 September 2011|location=Australia|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108212058/http://meeja.com.au/2012/sean-connery-was-the-girliest-bond/|archivedate=8 January 2013}}</ref>  ''Quantum of Solace'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on 29 October 2008, garnering generally polarized reviews, which mainly praised Craig's performance, the darker, grittier and realistic tone and the film's action sequences, but felt that the film was less impressive than the predecessor ''Casino Royale''.  {{As of|2016|September}}, it is the fourth-highest-grossing ''James Bond'' film, without adjusting for inflation, earning $589&nbsp;million worldwide, and becoming the [[2008 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh highest-grossing film of 2008]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please remember to keep it short and around 600 words per WikiProject Films/Style guidelines, and that a spoiler warning is unnecessary per Wikipedia:Spoiler. -->\nMoments after the end of the previous film, James Bond is driving from [[Lake Como]] to [[Siena]], Italy, with the captured [[List of James Bond villains#Casino Royale 2006|Mr. White]] in the [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]] of his [[Aston Martin DBS V12]]. After evading pursuers Bond delivers White to [[M (James Bond)|M]], who interrogates him regarding the then unknown organisation, [[SPECTRE#Rebooted continuity|Quantum]]. M's [[bodyguard]], Craig Mitchell, is a double agent and attacks M, enabling White to escape. Bond chases Mitchell and kills him. Bond and M return to London and search Mitchell's flat, discovering Mitchell had a contact in [[Haiti]], Edmund Slate. Bond learns Slate is a hitman sent to kill [[Camille Montes]] at the behest of her lover, environmentalist entrepreneur [[List of James Bond villains#Quantum of Solace|Dominic Greene]]. Observing her subsequent meeting with Greene, Bond learns Greene is helping exiled Bolivian General Medrano, who murdered Camille's family, to overthrow the government and become the new president, in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.\n\nAfter rescuing Camille from Medrano, Bond follows Greene to a performance of ''[[Tosca]]'' in [[Bregenz]], Austria. Meanwhile, the head of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s South American section, Gregg Beam, strikes a noninterference deal with Greene for access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil, which the CIA believes to be the reason for Greene's interest in the land. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's executive board, and a gunfight ensues. A [[Counter Terrorism Command|Special Branch]] bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines, an advisor to the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], is killed by one of Greene's men after Bond throws him off a roof. M assumes Bond killed him, and she has Bond's passports and credit cards revoked. Bond heads to Italy and convinces his old ally [[List of James Bond allies#Ren\u00e9 Mathis|Ren\u00e9 Mathis]] to accompany him to [[Bolivia]]. They are greeted by Strawberry Fields, a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her, and they attend a fundraising party Greene holds that night. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene. Leaving, Bond and Camille are pulled over by Bolivian police, paid off by Greene and Medrano. They had earlier attacked Mathis and put his body in Bond's car to frame Bond. In the ensuing struggle, Mathis and the policemen are killed.\n\nThe following day, Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition by air; their plane is shot down by a Bolivian fighter aircraft. They skydive into a sinkhole and discover Quantum is damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to create a [[monopoly]]. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns Quantum killed Fields by drowning her in [[Petroleum|crude oil]]. Bond meets CIA Agent [[Felix Leiter]], who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet in the [[Atacama Desert]] to finalise their agreement. Warned by Leiter, he evades the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]] when they attempt to kill him.\n\nAt an [[eco hotel]] in the desert, Greene tells Medrano that he now controls the majority of Bolivia's water supply, and Medrano must accept a new contract that makes Greene Bolivia's sole provider of water at significantly higher rates; if Medrano refuses, Greene will deprive the country of water until it [[societal collapse|collapses]]. Bond infiltrates the complex, kills the chief of police for betraying Mathis, and single-handedly assaults the hotel. After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum. Bond leaves him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil. \n\nBond travels to [[Kazan]], Russia, where he finds [[Vesper Lynd]]'s former lover, Yusef Kabira, a member of Quantum who seduces women with valuable connections and is indirectly responsible for her death. Bond tells Kabira's latest target, Corrine Veneau, a [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service|Canadian Intelligence]] agent, of Kabira's true intentions, thus sparing her Vesper's fate. He allows MI6 to arrest Kabira. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene was found dead in the middle of the desert, shot twice and with engine oil in his stomach. M tells Bond she needs him back; he responds that he never left. Walking away, he drops Vesper's necklace in the snow.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]].

Describing the film as having a \"rock-solid dramatic idea and the intelligence to run with it\", he gave the film four stars out of five.<ref>{{cite news|last=Robey|first=Tim|title=James Bond: Quantum of Solace, Review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/10540055/James-Bond-Quantum-of-Solace-review.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 December 2013|location=London}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\nThe film was nominated for Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Visual Effects, Film and Sound Editing at the 2008 [[Satellite Awards]], winning Best Song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressacademy.com/satawards/awards2008.shtml|title=2008 13th Annual SATELLITE Awards|publisher=[[International Press Academy]]|accessdate=15 December 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209100353/http://www.pressacademy.com/satawards/awards2008.shtml <!-- Added by H3llBot -->|archivedate=9 December 2008}}</ref> It was nominated for Best Action Movie at the 2009 [[Critics' Choice Movie Awards|Critics' Choice Awards]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117997072.html |author=Dade Hayes|title=Critics Choice favors 'Milk,' 'Button'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=9 December 2008}}</ref> and at the [[Empire Awards]], which is voted for by the public, it was shortlisted for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Newcomer, Best Thriller and Best Soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news|title=Empire Awards nominate 'Quantum of Solace' five times, vote now online|publisher=[[MI6-HQ.com]]|date=2 March 2009|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/news/index.php?itemid=7396&t=mi6&s=news|accessdate=3 March 2009}}</ref> It was nominated for the [[Saturn Award]] for Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film, while Kurylenko and Dench were both nominated for the Best Supporting Actress award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saturnawards.org/nominations.html |title=Nominations for the 35th Annual Saturn Awards |publisher=[[Saturn Award|Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films]] |accessdate=17 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221234527/http://www.saturnawards.org/nominations.html |archivedate=21 February 2012  }}</ref> It was nominated by the [[7th Visual Effects Society Awards|Visual Effects Society Awards]] for \"Outstanding Compositing in a Feature Motion Picture.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visualeffectssociety.com/ayear/7th-annual-ves-awards|title=7th Annual VES Awards|work=visual effects society|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nMovie critic Gilbert Cruz listed the film's pre-titles sequence as the eighth-greatest car chase in film history.<ref>{{cite news|author=Gilbert Cruz|title=The 15 Greatest Movie Car Chases of All Time|work=[[Time (magazine) | Time]]|date=1 May 2011|url=https://entertainment.time.com/2011/05/05/the-15-greatest-movie-car-chases-of-all-time/slide/quantum-of-solace-2008|accessdate=1 February 2020 | location=New York}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* [[Eco-terrorism in fiction]]\n* [[Outline of James Bond]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* ''Bond on Set: Filming Quantum of Solace'', Greg Williams, DK ADULT (20 October 2008), {{ISBN|0-7566-4120-9}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Quantum of Solace}}\n{{commons category|Quantum of Solace (film)}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.007.com}}\n*{{IMDb title|0830515}}\n*{{Allmovie title|356351}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|quantum_of_solace}}\n*{{mojo title|jamesbond22}}\n\n{{James Bond films}}\n{{Quantum of Solace}}\n{{Marc Forster}}\n{{Paul Haggis}}\n{{Empire Award for Best Thriller}}\n\n{{Good article}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:2000s action thriller films]]\n[[Category:2000s adventure films]]\n[[Category:2000s spy films]]\n[[Category:2000s sequel films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American adventure films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:Best Thriller Empire Award winners]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British adventure films]]\n[[Category:British sequel films]]\n[[Category:Central Intelligence Agency in fiction]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Eco-terrorism in fiction]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Environmental films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Arnold]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into video games]]\n[[Category:British films about revenge]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Marc Forster]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Michael G.

Directed by [[Marc Forster]] and written by [[Paul Haggis]], [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade]], it is a direct sequel to [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|''Casino Royale'']], and the second film to star [[Daniel Craig]] as the fictional [[MI6]] agent [[James Bond]]. The film also stars [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Mathieu Amalric]], [[Gemma Arterton]], [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]], and [[Judi Dench]].  In the film, Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, [[Vesper Lynd]], and is assisted by [[Camille Montes]], who is plotting revenge for the murder of her own family.  The trail eventually leads them to wealthy businessman [[Dominic Greene]], a member of the [[Quantum (James Bond)|Quantum]] organisation<!-- \"Organisation\" is British spelling, and the article uses British spelling -->, which intends to stage a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' in Bolivia to [[Water privatization in Bolivia|seize control of their water supply]]. \n\nProducer [[Michael G. Wilson]] developed the film's plot while the previous film in the series, [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|''Casino Royale'']], was being shot.  Purvis, Wade, and Haggis contributed to the script.  Although Craig and Forster wrote some sections themselves during the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike|screenwriter strike]],<ref name=Goldberg /> they received no such credits in the final cut.  The title was chosen from a 1959<!-- The story was first published in November 1959 in ''Modern Woman's Magazine'', q.v. For Your Eyes Only (short story collection) for the citation --> short story in [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', though the film does not contain any elements of that story.  Location filming took place in Mexico, Panama, Chile, Italy, Austria and Wales, while interior sets were built and filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]].  Forster aimed to make a modern film that also featured classic cinema motifs: a vintage [[Douglas DC-3]] was used for a flight sequence, and [[Dennis Gassner]]'s set designs are reminiscent of [[Ken Adam]]'s work on several early ''Bond'' films.  Taking a course away from the usual [[List of James Bond villains|Bond villains]], Forster rejected any grotesque appearance for the character Dominic Greene to emphasise the hidden and secret nature of the film's contemporary villains.\n\nThe film was also marked by its frequent depictions of violence, with a 2012 study by the [[University of Otago]] in New Zealand finding it to be the most violent film in the franchise.  Whereas ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' featured 109 \"trivial or severely violent\" acts, ''Quantum of Solace'' had a count of 250\u2014the most depictions of violence in any ''Bond'' film\u2014even more prominent since it was also the shortest film in the franchise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/2012/sean-connery-was-the-girliest-bond/|title=Sean Connery was the girliest Bond|publisher=Meeja|date=10 December 2012|accessdate=6 September 2011|location=Australia|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108212058/http://meeja.com.au/2012/sean-connery-was-the-girliest-bond/|archivedate=8 January 2013}}</ref>  ''Quantum of Solace'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on 29 October 2008, garnering generally polarized reviews, which mainly praised Craig's performance, the darker, grittier and realistic tone and the film's action sequences, but felt that the film was less impressive than the predecessor ''Casino Royale''.  {{As of|2016|September}}, it is the fourth-highest-grossing ''James Bond'' film, without adjusting for inflation, earning $589&nbsp;million worldwide, and becoming the [[2008 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh highest-grossing film of 2008]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please remember to keep it short and around 600 words per WikiProject Films/Style guidelines, and that a spoiler warning is unnecessary per Wikipedia:Spoiler. -->\nMoments after the end of the previous film, James Bond is driving from [[Lake Como]] to [[Siena]], Italy, with the captured [[List of James Bond villains#Casino Royale 2006|Mr. White]] in the [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]] of his [[Aston Martin DBS V12]]. After evading pursuers Bond delivers White to [[M (James Bond)|M]], who interrogates him regarding the then unknown organisation, [[SPECTRE#Rebooted continuity|Quantum]]. M's [[bodyguard]], Craig Mitchell, is a double agent and attacks M, enabling White to escape. Bond chases Mitchell and kills him. Bond and M return to London and search Mitchell's flat, discovering Mitchell had a contact in [[Haiti]], Edmund Slate. Bond learns Slate is a hitman sent to kill [[Camille Montes]] at the behest of her lover, environmentalist entrepreneur [[List of James Bond villains#Quantum of Solace|Dominic Greene]]. Observing her subsequent meeting with Greene, Bond learns Greene is helping exiled Bolivian General Medrano, who murdered Camille's family, to overthrow the government and become the new president, in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.\n\nAfter rescuing Camille from Medrano, Bond follows Greene to a performance of ''[[Tosca]]'' in [[Bregenz]], Austria. Meanwhile, the head of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s South American section, Gregg Beam, strikes a noninterference deal with Greene for access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil, which the CIA believes to be the reason for Greene's interest in the land. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's executive board, and a gunfight ensues. A [[Counter Terrorism Command|Special Branch]] bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines, an advisor to the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], is killed by one of Greene's men after Bond throws him off a roof. M assumes Bond killed him, and she has Bond's passports and credit cards revoked. Bond heads to Italy and convinces his old ally [[List of James Bond allies#Ren\u00e9 Mathis|Ren\u00e9 Mathis]] to accompany him to [[Bolivia]]. They are greeted by Strawberry Fields, a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her, and they attend a fundraising party Greene holds that night. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene. Leaving, Bond and Camille are pulled over by Bolivian police, paid off by Greene and Medrano. They had earlier attacked Mathis and put his body in Bond's car to frame Bond. In the ensuing struggle, Mathis and the policemen are killed.\n\nThe following day, Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition by air; their plane is shot down by a Bolivian fighter aircraft. They skydive into a sinkhole and discover Quantum is damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to create a [[monopoly]]. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns Quantum killed Fields by drowning her in [[Petroleum|crude oil]]. Bond meets CIA Agent [[Felix Leiter]], who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet in the [[Atacama Desert]] to finalise their agreement. Warned by Leiter, he evades the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]] when they attempt to kill him.\n\nAt an [[eco hotel]] in the desert, Greene tells Medrano that he now controls the majority of Bolivia's water supply, and Medrano must accept a new contract that makes Greene Bolivia's sole provider of water at significantly higher rates; if Medrano refuses, Greene will deprive the country of water until it [[societal collapse|collapses]]. Bond infiltrates the complex, kills the chief of police for betraying Mathis, and single-handedly assaults the hotel. After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum. Bond leaves him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil. \n\nBond travels to [[Kazan]], Russia, where he finds [[Vesper Lynd]]'s former lover, Yusef Kabira, a member of Quantum who seduces women with valuable connections and is indirectly responsible for her death. Bond tells Kabira's latest target, Corrine Veneau, a [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service|Canadian Intelligence]] agent, of Kabira's true intentions, thus sparing her Vesper's fate. He allows MI6 to arrest Kabira. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene was found dead in the middle of the desert, shot twice and with engine oil in his stomach. M tells Bond she needs him back; he responds that he never left. Walking away, he drops Vesper's necklace in the snow.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]].

Describing the film as having a \"rock-solid dramatic idea and the intelligence to run with it\", he gave the film four stars out of five.<ref>{{cite news|last=Robey|first=Tim|title=James Bond: Quantum of Solace, Review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/10540055/James-Bond-Quantum-of-Solace-review.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 December 2013|location=London}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\nThe film was nominated for Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Visual Effects, Film and Sound Editing at the 2008 [[Satellite Awards]], winning Best Song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressacademy.com/satawards/awards2008.shtml|title=2008 13th Annual SATELLITE Awards|publisher=[[International Press Academy]]|accessdate=15 December 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209100353/http://www.pressacademy.com/satawards/awards2008.shtml <!-- Added by H3llBot -->|archivedate=9 December 2008}}</ref> It was nominated for Best Action Movie at the 2009 [[Critics' Choice Movie Awards|Critics' Choice Awards]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117997072.html |author=Dade Hayes|title=Critics Choice favors 'Milk,' 'Button'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=9 December 2008}}</ref> and at the [[Empire Awards]], which is voted for by the public, it was shortlisted for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Newcomer, Best Thriller and Best Soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news|title=Empire Awards nominate 'Quantum of Solace' five times, vote now online|publisher=[[MI6-HQ.com]]|date=2 March 2009|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/news/index.php?itemid=7396&t=mi6&s=news|accessdate=3 March 2009}}</ref> It was nominated for the [[Saturn Award]] for Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film, while Kurylenko and Dench were both nominated for the Best Supporting Actress award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saturnawards.org/nominations.html |title=Nominations for the 35th Annual Saturn Awards |publisher=[[Saturn Award|Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films]] |accessdate=17 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221234527/http://www.saturnawards.org/nominations.html |archivedate=21 February 2012  }}</ref> It was nominated by the [[7th Visual Effects Society Awards|Visual Effects Society Awards]] for \"Outstanding Compositing in a Feature Motion Picture.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visualeffectssociety.com/ayear/7th-annual-ves-awards|title=7th Annual VES Awards|work=visual effects society|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nMovie critic Gilbert Cruz listed the film's pre-titles sequence as the eighth-greatest car chase in film history.<ref>{{cite news|author=Gilbert Cruz|title=The 15 Greatest Movie Car Chases of All Time|work=[[Time (magazine) | Time]]|date=1 May 2011|url=https://entertainment.time.com/2011/05/05/the-15-greatest-movie-car-chases-of-all-time/slide/quantum-of-solace-2008|accessdate=1 February 2020 | location=New York}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* [[Eco-terrorism in fiction]]\n* [[Outline of James Bond]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* ''Bond on Set: Filming Quantum of Solace'', Greg Williams, DK ADULT (20 October 2008), {{ISBN|0-7566-4120-9}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Quantum of Solace}}\n{{commons category|Quantum of Solace (film)}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.007.com}}\n*{{IMDb title|0830515}}\n*{{Allmovie title|356351}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|quantum_of_solace}}\n*{{mojo title|jamesbond22}}\n\n{{James Bond films}}\n{{Quantum of Solace}}\n{{Marc Forster}}\n{{Paul Haggis}}\n{{Empire Award for Best Thriller}}\n\n{{Good article}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:2000s action thriller films]]\n[[Category:2000s adventure films]]\n[[Category:2000s spy films]]\n[[Category:2000s sequel films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American adventure films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:Best Thriller Empire Award winners]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British adventure films]]\n[[Category:British sequel films]]\n[[Category:Central Intelligence Agency in fiction]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Eco-terrorism in fiction]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Environmental films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Arnold]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into video games]]\n[[Category:British films about revenge]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Marc Forster]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Michael G.

It was released by [[Warner Records]] as the album's [[lead single]] on 31 October 2019. Lipa wrote the track with [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]], and its producer [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. Inspired by music by the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Daft Punk]], \"Don't Start Now\" is a [[disco]] song with several [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] elements. It is built around a percolating [[Funk music|funk]] [[bassline]] and [[Accent (music)|accented]] disco strings. In the lyrics, Lipa addresses a former lover about moving on from their breakup. \n\n\"Don't Start Now\" received acclaim from music critics upon release, with many noting a significant growth in Lipa's sound and identity as a singer. The song was a commercial success worldwide, charting in the top 10 in over 40 different countries. It peaked at number two on both the [[UK Singles Chart]] and US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], surpassing 2017's \"[[New Rules]]\" to become Lipa's highest-charting single in the US. The music video for \"Don't Start Now\" was directed by [[Nabil Elderkin]], and shows Lipa passing through a basement nightclub and masked ball. To promote the single, the singer performed it on many television programmes, and at several awards shows, including the [[2019 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and [[American Music Awards of 2019|2019 American Music Awards]].\n\n==Background==\nLipa co-wrote \"Don't Start Now\" with the same team who wrote her 2017 single \"[[New Rules]]\": [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]] and [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. She said working with them again naturally made her choose it as ''[[Future Nostalgia (Dua Lipa album)|Future Nostalgia]]''{{'}}s [[lead single]] to \"close one chapter of my life and start another\" with a \"new sound\".<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/dua-lipa-shares-snippet-of-new-track-dont-start-now-album-2559838|title=Dua Lipa shares new disco-tinged single 'Don't Start Now'|last=Skinner|first=Tom|website=[[NME]]|date=1 November 2019|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> \"Don't Start Now\" first came about after the [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] head at Lipa's record label, Joe Kentish, challenged Kirkpatrick in late 2018 to produce another track for the singer following the success of \"New Rules\".<ref name=\"Billboard Interview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9350891/producer-ian-kirkpatrick-interview|title=Producer Ian Kirkpatrick on Chart Success During Quarantine: 'It's a Very Strange Duality'|last=LeDonne|first=Rob|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=6 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020|url-access=subscription}}</ref> The song was first composed at Ailin's home in [[Wyoming]].<ref name=\"SU\">{{cite web|url=https://www.songwriteruniverse.com/ian-kirkpatrick-songwriter-2020.htm|title=Ian Kirkpatrick Interview - Hit Songwriter and Producer|last=Kawashima|first=Dale|website=Songwriter Universe|date=20 February 2020|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Kirkpatrick recalls it being \"a back and forth\" between the [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] sound that Lipa envisioned. Producer J Kash was involved during initial writing sessions.<ref name=\"Billboard Interview\"/>\n\nThe lyrics were written in January 2019 with a \"dance-around-the-room attitude\". Kirkpatrick included the use of a [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]] in the first [[Demo (music)|demo]], based on phrasing in the chorus and inspired by music by [[Two Door Cinema Club]]. He produced the transition from the verse to the [[Drop (music)|drop]] using \"[[Can't Feel My Face]]\" by [[The Weeknd]] as an example.<ref name=\"Billboard Interview\"/> Although the [[bassline]] in \"Don't Start Now\" sounds live, Kirkpatrick created it with [[MIDI]].

Inspired by music by the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Daft Punk]], \"Don't Start Now\" is a [[nu-disco]] song with several [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] elements. It is built around a percolating [[Funk music|funk]] [[bassline]] and [[Accent (music)|accented]] disco strings. In the lyrics, Lipa addresses a former lover about moving on from their breakup. \n\n\"Don't Start Now\" received acclaim from music critics upon release, with many noting a significant growth in Lipa's sound and identity as a singer. The song was a commercial success worldwide, charting in the top 10 in over 40 different countries. It peaked at number two on both the [[UK Singles Chart]] and US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], surpassing 2017's \"[[New Rules]]\" to become Lipa's highest-charting single in the US. The music video for \"Don't Start Now\" was directed by [[Nabil Elderkin]], and shows Lipa passing through a basement nightclub and masked ball. To promote the single, the singer performed it on many television programmes, and at several awards shows, including the [[2019 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and [[American Music Awards of 2019|2019 American Music Awards]].\n\n==Background==\nLipa co-wrote \"Don't Start Now\" with the same team who wrote her 2017 single \"[[New Rules]]\": [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]] and [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. She said working with them again naturally made her choose it as ''[[Future Nostalgia (Dua Lipa album)|Future Nostalgia]]''{{'}}s [[lead single]] to \"close one chapter of my life and start another\" with a \"new sound\".<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/dua-lipa-shares-snippet-of-new-track-dont-start-now-album-2559838|title=Dua Lipa shares new disco-tinged single 'Don't Start Now'|last=Skinner|first=Tom|website=[[NME]]|date=1 November 2019|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> \"Don't Start Now\" first came about after the [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] head at Lipa's record label, Joe Kentish, challenged Kirkpatrick in late 2018 to produce another track for the singer following the success of \"New Rules\".<ref name=\"Billboard Interview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9350891/producer-ian-kirkpatrick-interview|title=Producer Ian Kirkpatrick on Chart Success During Quarantine: 'It's a Very Strange Duality'|last=LeDonne|first=Rob|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=6 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020|url-access=subscription}}</ref> The song was first composed at Ailin's home in [[Wyoming]].<ref name=\"SU\">{{cite web|url=https://www.songwriteruniverse.com/ian-kirkpatrick-songwriter-2020.htm|title=Ian Kirkpatrick Interview - Hit Songwriter and Producer|last=Kawashima|first=Dale|website=Songwriter Universe|date=20 February 2020|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Kirkpatrick recalls it being \"a back and forth\" between the [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] sound that Lipa envisioned.

The other, Dorset Council, was created from most of the area administered by [[Dorset County Council]] (apart from Christchurch) and the non-metropolitan districts of [[Weymouth and Portland]], [[West Dorset]], [[North Dorset]], [[Purbeck District|Purbeck]] and [[East Dorset]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://futuredorset.co.uk/|title=Future Dorset - Two new authorities for Dorset|website=futuredorset.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Shadow authority===\nStatutory instruments for the creation of the new authority were made on behalf of the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government on 25 May 2018, and a shadow authority was formed the following day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-44250570|title=Parliament passes councils merger plan|date=25 May 2018|accessdate=30 May 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> \n\nThe ''Shadow Dorset Council'' consisted of all elected councillors from Weymouth and Portland Borough Council, West Dorset District Council, North Dorset District Council, East Dorset District Council, Purbeck District Council and all councillors from Dorset County Council with the exception of the five that were elected from divisions within Christchurch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://futuredorset.co.uk/historic-day-as-parliamentary-process-to-create-new-councils-concludes/|title=Historic day, as Parliamentary process to create new councils concludes - Future Dorset|website=futuredorset.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe first meeting of the shadow authority was held on Thursday 7 June 2018 where Hilary Cox  was elected to be Chair of the shadow authority and Peter Shoreland was elected as Vice-Chair. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Dorset_SC/status/1004781078542942213|title=Shadow Dorset Council on Twitter|publisher=}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Dorset_SC/status/1004782649867677696|title=Shadow Dorset Council on Twitter|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Local Government Boundary Commission for England]] recommended that the new council should have eighty-two councillors representing a mix of single-member, two-member and three-member wards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lgbce.org.uk/all-reviews/south-west/dorset/dorset|title=Dorset {{!}} LGBCE Site|website=www.lgbce.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-44702337|title=New ward boundaries plan unveiled|date=2018-07-03|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[2019 structural changes to local government in England]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website}}\n* [https://dorsetareacouncils.wordpress.com// Shadow Dorset Council]\n\n{{Dorset-geo-stub}}\n\n{{Dorset}}\n{{SW England}}\n{{Unitary authorities of England}}\n\n{{coord missing|Dorset}}\n\n[[Category:Local government in Dorset]]\n[[Category:Lists of divisions in Dorset|council]]\n", "name_user": "Wnjr", "label": "safe", "comment": "now LEA for Dorset", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorset_Council_(UK)"}
