Tamu\u00edn is internationally renowned for three archaeological sites representative of the precolonial [[Huastec civilization|Huastec culture]].\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe name Tamu\u00edn has been spelled in many ways over time: Tamui, Tamuche, Tamuchi, Tam-Ohin, Tamo-Oxxi, Tam-Huinic, Tamuyn, Tamohi, Tamnoc. Its meaning is undetermined, and there have been many proposals about it, two of which being \u201c[[gar]] spot\u201d (gar, a kind of fish) and \u201cmosquito spot\u201d. Another suggestion holds that the original name is Tam-Huinic and that this translates as \u201cplace of the book of knowledge\u201d. This meaning is suggestive of the fact that Tamu\u00edn was the leading ceremonial center of the entire [[La Huasteca|region of Huasteca]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}  Yet another suggestion is that Tamuin is a corruption of the Huastec 'tamohi' meaning 'place of Ramon trees'. [https://books.google.com.gt/books?id=S4TTNvYgXRwC&lpg=PA245&ots=xlG-8f5HLB&dq=huastec%20toltec&hl=en&pg=PA245#v=onepage&q=huastec%20toltec&f=false \"An Archaeological Guide to Central and Southern Mexico\" by Joyce & Jerry Kelly 2001].  This is supported by Huastec origins from the moist south [[Huastec people]] where [[Brosimum alicastrum|ramon nuts]] are common and a staple food.\n\n==Location==\nThe municipality is situated in the eastern part of the State of [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]] and belongs to the region known as [[La Huasteca|Huasteca]], a region which covers parts of several states. Tamu\u00edn is bordered on the north by the state of [[Tamaulipas]], on the south by the villages of [[San Vicente Tancuayalab (San Luis Potos\u00ed)|San Vicente Tancuayalab]] and [[Tanlaj\u00e1s (San Luis Potos\u00ed)|Tanlaj\u00e1s]], on the east by the ''municipio'' of [[\u00c9bano]], and on the west by [[Ciudad Valles]].\n\n==Hydrography==\nThe [[Tampa\u00f3n River]] runs through the middle of  Tamu\u00edn. It joins the [[Moctezuma River]] to form the [[P\u00e1nuco River]], which empties into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. This region contains the following [[lagoon]]s: Los Patitos, Tansey, Brasil, San Jos\u00e9 del Lim\u00f3n, Palmas Cortadas and Mirador.\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate is hot for most of the year, turning to between cool and cold between November and February.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Tamu\u00edn (1951\u20132010)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|temperature colour = \n|Jan record high C = 38.5\n|Feb record high C = 39.5\n|Mar record high C = 46.7\n|Apr record high C = 47.5\n|May record high C = 48.9\n|Jun record high C = 45.5\n|Jul record high C = 41.1\n|Aug record high C = 40.5\n|Sep record high C = 41.2\n|Oct record high C = 39.5\n|Nov record high C = 39.8\n|Dec record high C = 37.5\n|year record high C = 48.9\n|Jan high C = 25.1\n|Feb high C = 27.3\n|Mar high C = 31.0\n|Apr high C = 34.2\n|May high C = 36.0\n|Jun high C = 35.7\n|Jul high C = 34.2\n|Aug high C = 34.7\n|Sep high C = 33.1\n|Oct high C = 31.1\n|Nov high C = 28.4\n|Dec high C = 25.6\n|year high C = 31.4\n|Jan mean C = 19.1\n|Feb mean C = 20.8\n|Mar mean C = 24.1\n|Apr mean C = 27.2\n|May mean C = 29.5\n|Jun mean C = 29.8\n|Jul mean C = 28.8\n|Aug mean C = 29.1\n|Sep mean C = 28.0\n|Oct mean C = 25.7\n|Nov mean C = 22.5\n|Dec mean C = 19.8\n|year mean C = 25.4\n|Jan low C = 13.2\n|Feb low C = 14.4\n|Mar low C = 17.2\n|Apr low C = 20.3\n|May low C = 23.0\n|Jun low C = 23.8\n|Jul low C = 23.4\n|Aug low C = 23.4\n|Sep low C = 22.8\n|Oct low C = 20.2\n|Nov low C = 16.7\n|Dec low C = 14.1\n|year low C = 19.4\n|Jan record low C = 0.0\n|Feb record low C = 1.5\n|Mar record low C = 3.0\n|Apr record low C = 9.5\n|May record low C = 11.0\n|Jun record low C = 18.0\n|Jul record low C = 18.5\n|Aug record low C = 19.0\n|Sep record low C = 12.0\n|Oct record low C = 10.0\n|Nov record low C = 4.5\n|Dec record low C = -0.5\n|year record low C = -0.5\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 22.5\n|Feb precipitation mm = 19.7\n|Mar precipitation mm = 18.7\n|Apr precipitation mm = 35.2\n|May precipitation mm = 77.8\n|Jun precipitation mm = 138.6\n|Jul precipitation mm = 208.2\n|Aug precipitation mm = 128.3\n|Sep precipitation mm = 213.6\n|Oct precipitation mm = 103.2\n|Nov precipitation mm = 26.7\n|Dec precipitation mm = 27.2\n|year precipitation mm = 1019.7\n|Jan humidity = 69\n|Feb humidity = 69\n|Mar humidity = 67\n|Apr humidity = 65\n|May humidity = 65\n|Jun humidity = 67\n|Jul humidity = 70\n|Aug humidity = 70\n|Sep humidity = 74\n|Oct humidity = 70\n|Nov humidity = 71\n|Dec humidity = 71\n|year humidity = 69\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 5.2\n|Feb precipitation days = 4.2\n|Mar precipitation days = 4.0\n|Apr precipitation days = 4.2\n|May precipitation days = 5.5\n|Jun precipitation days = 8.8\n|Jul precipitation days = 10.7\n|Aug precipitation days = 9.3\n|Sep precipitation days = 11.7\n|Oct precipitation days = 7.4\n|Nov precipitation days = 4.7\n|Dec precipitation days = 4.7\n|year precipitation days = 80.4\n|source 1 = Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional (humidity 1981\u20132000)<ref name = SMN>{{cite web\n| url = http://smn.cna.gob.mx/climatologia/Normales5110/NORMAL24139.TXT\n| title = Estado de San Luis Potosi\u2013Estacion: Tamuin (DGE)\n| work = NORMALES CLIMATOL\u00d3GICAS 1951\u20132010\n| publisher = Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional\n| language = Spanish\n| accessdate = February 13, 2016}}</ref><ref name=extremas>{{cite web\n |url        = http://smn.cna.gob.mx/climatologia/Max-Extr/00024/00024139.TXT\n |title      = Extreme Temperatures and Precipitation for Tamuin (DGE) 1975-2009\n |publisher  = Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional\n |language   = Spanish\n |accessdate = February 13, 2016\n}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref><ref name=obs>{{cite web\n |url         = http://smn.cna.gob.mx/observatorios/historica/tamuin.pdf\n |title       = NORMALES CLIMATOL\u00d3GICAS 1981\u20132000\n |publisher   = Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional\n |language    = Spanish\n |accessdate  = February 13, 2016\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160213170702/http://smn.cna.gob.mx/observatorios/historica/tamuin.pdf\n |archivedate = February 13, 2016\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==History==\n[[La Huasteca]] was the territory of the Wastek (Huastec) ethnicity, a branch of the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] group of ethnicities. La Huasteca is detached from and far to the north of the main Maya region. Today, there are about 150,000 speakers of the [[Wastek language]] distributed between the states of San Luis Potos\u00ed and the neighboring state of Veracruz.\n\nTamu\u00edn was the site of the first royal land lease (''merced de tierra'') in the portion of Huasteca which within the modern day state of San Luis Potos\u00ed. In 1555, the [[Viceroy of New Spain|Viceroy]] ordered the ''alcalde mayor'' (magistrate<ref>Law and Government in New Mexico History, Lesson 4</ref>) of [[P\u00e1nuco, Veracruz|P\u00e1nuco]] not to hinder the fisheries of the [[Huastec civilization|Huastec tribe]] in Tamu\u00edn and [[Tampico]].\n\nIn 1787, the [[Spanish_Empire#The_Bourbon_Spanish_Empire:_Reform_and_Recovery_.281713.E2.80.931806.29|Spanish empire's new system]] of [[Intendancy#The_Spanish_Monarchy|intendancies]] was extended into Mexico. The old magistrate district of the Villa de los Valles was abolished and it was incorporated into the vast intendancy of San Luis Potos\u00ed, whose borders extended to [[Louisiana]] in the northeast, and Tamu\u00edn continued in the administrative status of a simple village (''[[:es:Pueblo (geograf\u00eda)|pueblo]]''). In 1793 the Franciscan friar, Fray Crist\u00f3bal Herrera Alcorcha described it in his report on the missions as the \u201cSanctuary of Tamud or Tamu\u00edn\u201d.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n \nUnder the constitution of the newly independent [[History of Mexico|Mexican Republic]], promulgated in 1824, the provinces of the former colony were transformed into \"[[Administrative divisions of Mexico|free and sovereign states]]\".<ref>that is still the wording of the Mexican constitution</ref> The first constitution of the State of San Luis Potos\u00ed was enacted by its constituent congress on 16 October 1826, and almost one year later, by decree No. 61 promulgated on 8 October 1827, several ''municipios'' of the state were designated, among them Tamu\u00edn. Soon thereafter a law regulating ''municipios'' (the ''Ley de Arreglo de Municipios'') was enacted, wherein the Villa of Tamu\u00edn is mentioned as belonging to the division (''partido'') of [[Ciudad Valles]].\n\nIn March 1831, the lieutenant colonel of engineers, Francisco Pocelli, sailed up the [[P\u00e1nuco River]] from [[Tampico]] in a steamboat and arrived at Tamu\u00edn. This event was quite memorable for the region, since it was the first time a steamboat had traversed there.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} \n\nBy a decree of 30 June 1845 issued by the Assembly of the Department of San Luis Potos\u00ed, the ''ayuntamiento'' (''municipio'' government) of Tamu\u00edn was transferred to the district of Valles.\n\nIn this period, the village (''pueblo'') of Tamu\u00edn was located further south than presently, at a site whose original name was El Choyal.\n\nIn 1892, for the transfer of Tamu\u00edn to the place called [[La Cofrad\u00eda]], the [[hacienda]] of El Lim\u00f3n was taken over. Its 19,000 hectares were distributed among 17 [[ejido]]s, giving each farmer (''ejidatario'') approximately 20 hectares on average. \n\nIn 1955, the Villa of Tamu\u00edn was inundated for nearly three weeks due to torrential rains caused by [[hurricane]]s Gladys and Hilda. During this crisis, the population was rendered incommunicado by damage to the town's highway. This disaster prompted president [[Adolfo Ruiz Cortinez]] to pay a visit to Tamu\u00edn.\n\n==Economy==\n'''Agriculture''': The most common crops are [[maize|corn]], [[sorghum]], [[bean]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[papaya]], and some [[produce]].\n\n'''Animal Ranching''': principally cattle, but also hogs, horses, sheep, and goats.\n\n'''Manufacturing''': there is a cement plant of Grupo [[Cemex]], two 260 MW electric generating stations operated by the [[AES Corporation]], and a meat packing plant.\n \n'''Fishing''': fisheries include [[gar]], river [[carp]], [[mojarra]], [[shrimp]], and acamaya (local variety of freshwater crayfish).\n\nThere is a large, modern airport. Commercial flights are on a limited scale for security reasons.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\n==Archaeological sites==\nThe municipality of Tamu\u00edn encompasses three of the most important sites of the Huastec culture: Tamtok, El Consuelo, and Tzintzin-Lujub.\n\n===Tamtok===\n[[Tamtok]] or Tamtoc is a site of the highest importance in the archaeological history of the Huasteca region. Situated in a plain within a large bend of the Tampa\u00f3n River and dominated by two great natural hills which are often at first glance mistaken for pyramids,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} the site comprises 50 small and medium sized mounds. There is a ceremonial plaza bordered by 23 buildings, with five platforms for conducting rituals occupying the center, which are surrounded by 13 round habitations and two rectangular, terraced large buildings which were probably for community use. The complex allows one to imagine what the religious life of the noble families of Tamtok must have been like. They may have believed in gods and practiced a fertility cult. \n\nTamtok means ''place of the water clouds'' [sic] in the [[Wastek language]]. It occupies 133 hectares on the banks of the Tamu\u00edn River, an hour's drive by highway from Ciudad Valles, San Luis Potos\u00ed. It was discovered at the end of the 19th century. In about 1937 the first report was made of archaeological monuments located in what was then the El Aserradero ranch, where Tamtok lies. In recent times, some have argued that the ancient city might have been as big as [[Teotihuac\u00e1n]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} \n\nBetween 1962 and 1965 the French archaeologist Stresser-P\u00e9an surveyed the area and conducted partial excavations. The work of restoration began 6 August 2001. Up to that point, the site had been virtually unknown. \n\nWith an investment of 18 million pesos, in these four years of work 70 structures have been stabilized out of 255 discovered.\n\nTamtok enjoyed its period of maximum splendor between 200 y 1300 A.D., during which period its population rose to 4,000. To judge by the artefacts discovered, it was a well-organized society based on agriculture. In the complex, an urbanism unique in [[Mesoamerica]] has been identified.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} \n\nOne characteristic that distinguishes Tamtok is the large presence of women. For example, 90 percent of the human remains discovered in the zone are women, and the great majority of the clay and ceramic figurines that have been found represent women.\n\n===El Consuelo===\nSituated southeast of the city of Tamu\u00edn, El Consuelo is accessed by federal highway 70 in the direction of the Gulf port of Tampico. At kilometer 284 it connects with state highway 170. The site entrance is six kilometers down on state highway 170. \n\nThe archaeological zone is known by the names Tamu\u00edn, for the ''municipio'', and El Consuelo, for the ranch which occupies the vicinity. The village of Tamu\u00edn or Tamoh\u00ed, a word which means \"place of effervescence\" in Wastek, was built between the 8th and 16th centuries and was depopulated at the time of the Spanish conquest.\n\nAmong the major archaeological zones of Huasteca{{spaced ndash}}which runs from the south of Tamaulipas State east to the northern part of Veracruz State and south to the eastern parts of the States of San Luis Potos\u00ed and Hidalgo{{spaced ndash}}are Tancol, Las Flores, [[Castillo de Teayo (archaeological site)|Castillo de Teayo]], Tantoc (Tamtok), Agua Nueva, and Yahualica. The El Consuelo site is representative of the Huastec culture in the last centuries of pre-Hispanic Mexico. The region's cultural development partook of the elements characteristic of the ancient cultures of North America. When its inhabitants dispersed during the first years of the conquest, they settled in the ''poblado'' known in today as Antiguo Tamu\u00edn (Old Tamu\u00edn), six kilometers from El Consuelo. \n\nThe first mention of the site is due to Walter Staub, who in 1919 published an article with photographs of various sculptures. By 1946, the investigator Wilfrido Du Solier conducted excavations in El Consuelo ranch and in several buildings and discovered the so called Polychrome Altar. Work was discontinued until 1981 when numerous architectural elements were stabilized. In 1990 the work of exploring and reconstructing the Great Platform commenced. \n\nAmong the most important objects encountered at the site are the sculpture, found in 1917, known as the Huastec Adolescent, probably a representation of the god Quetzalc\u00f3atl in his youth and considered one of the masterpieces of pre-Hispanic art in Huastec culture. Also important is the mural which covers one of the altars, in which is seen, in a series of images, personages with rich vestments. The figures are conspicuous for their originality and quality and the ceramic art of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic period]].\n\n===Tzintzin-Lujub===\n\nArchaeological site today known as Agua Nueva, located within the \u201cEl Hurac\u00e1n\u201d ranch, property of Celestino Rivera and Claudio S\u00e1nchez, 18.7 kilometers from the highway between Tamu\u00edn and San Vicente Tancuayalab.\n\n== See Also ==\n\n* [[Balc\u00f3n de Montezuma|Balcon de Montezuma]]\n* [[El Sabinito]]\n* [[Las Flores (archaeological site)|Las Flores]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Center for Democracy and Civic Education (CDCE).

Tamu\u00edn is internationally renowned for three archaeological sites representative of the precolonial [[Huastec civilization|Huastec culture]].\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe name Tamu\u00edn has been spelled in many ways over time: Tamui, Tamuche, Tamuchi, Tam-Ohin, Tamo-Oxxi, Tam-Huinic, Tamuyn, Tamohi, Tamnoc. Its meaning is undetermined, and there have been many proposals about it, two of which being \u201c[[gar]] spot\u201d (gar, a kind of fish) and \u201cmosquito spot\u201d. Another suggestion holds that the original name is Tam-Huinic and that this translates as \u201cplace of the book of knowledge\u201d. This meaning is suggestive of the fact that Tamu\u00edn was the leading ceremonial center of the entire [[La Huasteca|region of Huasteca]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}  Yet another suggestion is that Tamuin is a corruption of the Huastec 'tamohi' meaning 'place of Ramon trees'. [https://books.google.com.gt/books?id=S4TTNvYgXRwC&lpg=PA245&ots=xlG-8f5HLB&dq=huastec%20toltec&hl=en&pg=PA245#v=onepage&q=huastec%20toltec&f=false \"An Archaeological Guide to Central and Southern Mexico\" by Joyce & Jerry Kelly 2001].  This is supported by Huastec origins from the moist south [[Huastec people]] where [[Brosimum alicastrum|ramon nuts]] are common and a staple food.\n\n==Location==\nThe municipality is situated in the eastern part of the State of [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]] and belongs to the region known as [[La Huasteca|Huasteca]], a region which covers parts of several states. Tamu\u00edn is bordered on the north by the state of [[Tamaulipas]], on the south by the villages of [[San Vicente Tancuayalab (San Luis Potos\u00ed)|San Vicente Tancuayalab]] and [[Tanlaj\u00e1s (San Luis Potos\u00ed)|Tanlaj\u00e1s]], on the east by the ''municipio'' of [[\u00c9bano]], and on the west by [[Ciudad Valles]].\n\n==Hydrography==\nThe [[Tampa\u00f3n River]] runs through the middle of  Tamu\u00edn. It joins the [[Moctezuma River]] to form the [[P\u00e1nuco River]], which empties into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. This region contains the following [[lagoon]]s: Los Patitos, Tansey, Brasil, San Jos\u00e9 del Lim\u00f3n, Palmas Cortadas and Mirador.\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate is hot for most of the year, turning to between cool and cold between November and February.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Tamu\u00edn (1951\u20132010)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|temperature colour = \n|Jan record high C = 38.5\n|Feb record high C = 39.5\n|Mar record high C = 46.7\n|Apr record high C = 47.5\n|May record high C = 48.9\n|Jun record high C = 45.5\n|Jul record high C = 41.1\n|Aug record high C = 40.5\n|Sep record high C = 41.2\n|Oct record high C = 39.5\n|Nov record high C = 39.8\n|Dec record high C = 37.5\n|year record high C = 48.9\n|Jan high C = 25.1\n|Feb high C = 27.3\n|Mar high C = 31.0\n|Apr high C = 34.2\n|May high C = 36.0\n|Jun high C = 35.7\n|Jul high C = 34.2\n|Aug high C = 34.7\n|Sep high C = 33.1\n|Oct high C = 31.1\n|Nov high C = 28.4\n|Dec high C = 25.6\n|year high C = 31.4\n|Jan mean C = 19.1\n|Feb mean C = 20.8\n|Mar mean C = 24.1\n|Apr mean C = 27.2\n|May mean C = 29.5\n|Jun mean C = 29.8\n|Jul mean C = 28.8\n|Aug mean C = 29.1\n|Sep mean C = 28.0\n|Oct mean C = 25.7\n|Nov mean C = 22.5\n|Dec mean C = 19.8\n|year mean C = 25.4\n|Jan low C = 13.2\n|Feb low C = 14.4\n|Mar low C = 17.2\n|Apr low C = 20.3\n|May low C = 23.0\n|Jun low C = 23.8\n|Jul low C = 23.4\n|Aug low C = 23.4\n|Sep low C = 22.8\n|Oct low C = 20.2\n|Nov low C = 16.7\n|Dec low C = 14.1\n|year low C = 19.4\n|Jan record low C = 0.0\n|Feb record low C = 1.5\n|Mar record low C = 3.0\n|Apr record low C = 9.5\n|May record low C = 11.0\n|Jun record low C = 18.0\n|Jul record low C = 18.5\n|Aug record low C = 19.0\n|Sep record low C = 12.0\n|Oct record low C = 10.0\n|Nov record low C = 4.5\n|Dec record low C = -0.5\n|year record low C = -0.5\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 22.5\n|Feb precipitation mm = 19.7\n|Mar precipitation mm = 18.7\n|Apr precipitation mm = 35.2\n|May precipitation mm = 77.8\n|Jun precipitation mm = 138.6\n|Jul precipitation mm = 208.2\n|Aug precipitation mm = 128.3\n|Sep precipitation mm = 213.6\n|Oct precipitation mm = 103.2\n|Nov precipitation mm = 26.7\n|Dec precipitation mm = 27.2\n|year precipitation mm = 1019.7\n|Jan humidity = 69\n|Feb humidity = 69\n|Mar humidity = 67\n|Apr humidity = 65\n|May humidity = 65\n|Jun humidity = 67\n|Jul humidity = 70\n|Aug humidity = 70\n|Sep humidity = 74\n|Oct humidity = 70\n|Nov humidity = 71\n|Dec humidity = 71\n|year humidity = 69\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 5.2\n|Feb precipitation days = 4.2\n|Mar precipitation days = 4.0\n|Apr precipitation days = 4.2\n|May precipitation days = 5.5\n|Jun precipitation days = 8.8\n|Jul precipitation days = 10.7\n|Aug precipitation days = 9.3\n|Sep precipitation days = 11.7\n|Oct precipitation days = 7.4\n|Nov precipitation days = 4.7\n|Dec precipitation days = 4.7\n|year precipitation days = 80.4\n|source 1 = Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional (humidity 1981\u20132000)<ref name = SMN>{{cite web\n| url = http://smn.cna.gob.mx/climatologia/Normales5110/NORMAL24139.TXT\n| title = Estado de San Luis Potosi\u2013Estacion: Tamuin (DGE)\n| work = NORMALES CLIMATOL\u00d3GICAS 1951\u20132010\n| publisher = Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional\n| language = Spanish\n| accessdate = February 13, 2016}}</ref><ref name=extremas>{{cite web\n |url        = http://smn.cna.gob.mx/climatologia/Max-Extr/00024/00024139.TXT\n |title      = Extreme Temperatures and Precipitation for Tamuin (DGE) 1975-2009\n |publisher  = Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional\n |language   = Spanish\n |accessdate = February 13, 2016\n}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref><ref name=obs>{{cite web\n |url         = http://smn.cna.gob.mx/observatorios/historica/tamuin.pdf\n |title       = NORMALES CLIMATOL\u00d3GICAS 1981\u20132000\n |publisher   = Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional\n |language    = Spanish\n |accessdate  = February 13, 2016\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160213170702/http://smn.cna.gob.mx/observatorios/historica/tamuin.pdf\n |archivedate = February 13, 2016\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==History==\n[[La Huasteca]] was the territory of the Wastek (Huastec) ethnicity, a branch of the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] group of ethnicities. La Huasteca is detached from and far to the north of the main Maya region. Today, there are about 150,000 speakers of the [[Wastek language]] distributed between the states of San Luis Potos\u00ed and the neighboring state of Veracruz.\n\nTamu\u00edn was the site of the first royal land lease (''merced de tierra'') in the portion of Huasteca which within the modern day state of San Luis Potos\u00ed. In 1555, the [[Viceroy of New Spain|Viceroy]] ordered the ''alcalde mayor'' (magistrate<ref>Law and Government in New Mexico History, Lesson 4</ref>) of [[P\u00e1nuco, Veracruz|P\u00e1nuco]] not to hinder the fisheries of the [[Huastec civilization|Huastec tribe]] in Tamu\u00edn and [[Tampico]].\n\nIn 1787, the [[Spanish_Empire#The_Bourbon_Spanish_Empire:_Reform_and_Recovery_.281713.E2.80.931806.29|Spanish empire's new system]] of [[Intendancy#The_Spanish_Monarchy|intendancies]] was extended into Mexico. The old magistrate district of the Villa de los Valles was abolished and it was incorporated into the vast intendancy of San Luis Potos\u00ed, whose borders extended to [[Louisiana]] in the northeast, and Tamu\u00edn continued in the administrative status of a simple village (''[[:es:Pueblo (geograf\u00eda)|pueblo]]''). In 1793 the Franciscan friar, Fray Crist\u00f3bal Herrera Alcorcha described it in his report on the missions as the \u201cSanctuary of Tamud or Tamu\u00edn\u201d.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n \nUnder the constitution of the newly independent [[History of Mexico|Mexican Republic]], promulgated in 1824, the provinces of the former colony were transformed into \"[[Administrative divisions of Mexico|free and sovereign states]]\".<ref>that is still the wording of the Mexican constitution</ref> The first constitution of the State of San Luis Potos\u00ed was enacted by its constituent congress on 16 October 1826, and almost one year later, by decree No. 61 promulgated on 8 October 1827, several ''municipios'' of the state were designated, among them Tamu\u00edn. Soon thereafter a law regulating ''municipios'' (the ''Ley de Arreglo de Municipios'') was enacted, wherein the Villa of Tamu\u00edn is mentioned as belonging to the division (''partido'') of [[Ciudad Valles]].\n\nIn March 1831, the lieutenant colonel of engineers, Francisco Pocelli, sailed up the [[P\u00e1nuco River]] from [[Tampico]] in a steamboat and arrived at Tamu\u00edn. This event was quite memorable for the region, since it was the first time a steamboat had traversed there.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} \n\nBy a decree of 30 June 1845 issued by the Assembly of the Department of San Luis Potos\u00ed, the ''ayuntamiento'' (''municipio'' government) of Tamu\u00edn was transferred to the district of Valles.\n\nIn this period, the village (''pueblo'') of Tamu\u00edn was located further south than presently, at a site whose original name was El Choyal.\n\nIn 1892, for the transfer of Tamu\u00edn to the place called [[La Cofrad\u00eda]], the [[hacienda]] of El Lim\u00f3n was taken over. Its 19,000 hectares were distributed among 17 [[ejido]]s, giving each farmer (''ejidatario'') approximately 20 hectares on average. \n\nIn 1955, the Villa of Tamu\u00edn was inundated for nearly three weeks due to torrential rains caused by [[hurricane]]s Gladys and Hilda. During this crisis, the population was rendered incommunicado by damage to the town's highway. This disaster prompted president [[Adolfo Ruiz Cortinez]] to pay a visit to Tamu\u00edn.\n\n==Economy==\n'''Agriculture''': The most common crops are [[maize|corn]], [[sorghum]], [[bean]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[papaya]], and some [[produce]].\n\n'''Animal Ranching''': principally cattle, but also hogs, horses, sheep, and goats.\n\n'''Manufacturing''': there is a cement plant of Grupo [[Cemex]], two 260 MW electric generating stations operated by the [[AES Corporation]], and a meat packing plant.\n \n'''Fishing''': fisheries include [[gar]], river [[carp]], [[mojarra]], [[shrimp]], and acamaya (local variety of freshwater crayfish).\n\nThere is a large, modern airport. Commercial flights are on a limited scale for security reasons.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\n==Archaeological sites==\nThe municipality of Tamu\u00edn encompasses three of the most important sites of the Huastec culture: Tamtok, El Consuelo, and Tzintzin-Lujub.\n\n===Tamtok===\n[[Tamtok]] or Tamtoc is a site of the highest importance in the archaeological history of the Huasteca region. Situated in a plain within a large bend of the Tampa\u00f3n River and dominated by two great natural hills which are often at first glance mistaken for pyramids,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} the site comprises 50 small and medium sized mounds. There is a ceremonial plaza bordered by 23 buildings, with five platforms for conducting rituals occupying the center, which are surrounded by 13 round habitations and two rectangular, terraced large buildings which were probably for community use. The complex allows one to imagine what the religious life of the noble families of Tamtok must have been like. They may have believed in gods and practiced a fertility cult. \n\nTamtok means ''place of the water clouds'' [sic] in the [[Wastek language]]. It occupies 133 hectares on the banks of the Tamu\u00edn River, an hour's drive by highway from Ciudad Valles, San Luis Potos\u00ed. It was discovered at the end of the 19th century. In about 1937 the first report was made of archaeological monuments located in what was then the El Aserradero ranch, where Tamtok lies. In recent times, some have argued that the ancient city might have been as big as [[Teotihuac\u00e1n]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} \n\nBetween 1962 and 1965 the French archaeologist Stresser-P\u00e9an surveyed the area and conducted partial excavations. The work of restoration began 6 August 2001. Up to that point, the site had been virtually unknown. \n\nWith an investment of 18 million pesos, in these four years of work 70 structures have been stabilized out of 255 discovered.\n\nTamtok enjoyed its period of maximum splendor between 200 y 1300 A.D., during which period its population rose to 4,000. To judge by the artefacts discovered, it was a well-organized society based on agriculture. In the complex, an urbanism unique in [[Mesoamerica]] has been identified.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} \n\nOne characteristic that distinguishes Tamtok is the large presence of women. For example, 90 percent of the human remains discovered in the zone are women, and the great majority of the clay and ceramic figurines that have been found represent women.\n\n===El Consuelo===\nSituated southeast of the city of Tamu\u00edn, El Consuelo is accessed by federal highway 70 in the direction of the Gulf port of Tampico. At kilometer 284 it connects with state highway 170. The site entrance is six kilometers down on state highway 170. \n\nThe archaeological zone is known by the names Tamu\u00edn, for the ''municipio'', and El Consuelo, for the ranch which occupies the vicinity. The village of Tamu\u00edn or Tamoh\u00ed, a word which means \"place of effervescence\" in Wastek, was built between the 8th and 16th centuries and was depopulated at the time of the Spanish conquest.\n\nAmong the major archaeological zones of Huasteca{{spaced ndash}}which runs from the south of Tamaulipas State east to the northern part of Veracruz State and south to the eastern parts of the States of San Luis Potos\u00ed and Hidalgo{{spaced ndash}}are Tancol, Las Flores, [[Castillo de Teayo (archaeological site)|Castillo de Teayo]], Tantoc (Tamtok), Agua Nueva, and Yahualica. The El Consuelo site is representative of the Huastec culture in the last centuries of pre-Hispanic Mexico. The region's cultural development partook of the elements characteristic of the ancient cultures of North America. When its inhabitants dispersed during the first years of the conquest, they settled in the ''poblado'' known in today as Antiguo Tamu\u00edn (Old Tamu\u00edn), six kilometers from El Consuelo. \n\nThe first mention of the site is due to Walter Staub, who in 1919 published an article with photographs of various sculptures. By 1946, the investigator Wilfrido Du Solier conducted excavations in El Consuelo ranch and in several buildings and discovered the so called Polychrome Altar. Work was discontinued until 1981 when numerous architectural elements were stabilized. In 1990 the work of exploring and reconstructing the Great Platform commenced. \n\nAmong the most important objects encountered at the site are the sculpture, found in 1917, known as the Huastec Adolescent, probably a representation of the god Quetzalc\u00f3atl in his youth and considered one of the masterpieces of pre-Hispanic art in Huastec culture. Also important is the mural which covers one of the altars, in which is seen, in a series of images, personages with rich vestments. The figures are conspicuous for their originality and quality and the ceramic art of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic period]].\n\n===Tzintzin-Lujub===\n\nArchaeological site today known as Agua Nueva, located within the \u201cEl Hurac\u00e1n\u201d ranch, property of Celestino Rivera and Claudio S\u00e1nchez, 18.7 kilometers from the highway between Tamu\u00edn and San Vicente Tancuayalab.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Center for Democracy and Civic Education (CDCE).

Released on 3 March 1986, it was the theme song to the 1986 [[Absolute Beginners (film)|film of the same name]] (itself an adaptation of the book ''[[Absolute Beginners (novel)|Absolute Beginners]]'').\n\nAlthough the film was not a commercial success, the song was a big hit: reached No. 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It also reached the top ten on the main singles charts in [[David Bowie discography| ten other countries]], becoming his last single to achieve that. It was less successful in the US, peaking at No. 53 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. \n\nBowie performed \"Absolute Beginners\" live on his 1987 [[Glass Spider Tour]], his 2000 [[Mini Tour (David Bowie)|\"Mini\" Tour]], and his 2002 [[Heathen Tour]]. The song has been included on a number of Bowie's compilation and \"Best-of\" releases, and was included as a bonus track on the 1995 re-release of ''[[Tonight (David Bowie album)|Tonight]]'' (1984).\n\n==Background and recording==\nBowie was good friends with the film's director, [[Julien Temple]] (who had worked with him in 1984 on the ''[[Jazzin' for Blue Jean]]'' short film). Bowie agreed to Temple's request to write music for the film if he could also play the part of Vendice Partners.\n\nIt was recorded at Langer & Winstanley's Westside Studios, London. The sessions were completed rapidly, but the song was delayed due to the problems with completing the film. [[Virgin Records|Virgin]] wanted the release to tie in with the film's opening. The song featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano, who had previously performed on Bowie's \"[[Space Oddity]]\" single and ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' album. Shortly after the sessions wrapped, [[Mick Jagger]] flew in to record the charity cover of \"[[Dancing in the Street]]\" with Bowie, which used many of the same musicians. Bowie recorded the lead vocal of \"Absolute Beginners\" at Westside Studios in August.<ref name=\"shepherd\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n[[AllMusic]] described \"Absolute Beginners\" as \"the gem of his post-''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' '80s output, a big, breathtaking ballad allowing him to indulge the [[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra]] croon that's driven many of his best performances\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/absolute-beginners-mw0000202298 | title=Absolute Beginners \u2013 Original Soundtrack | publisher=AllMusic | first=Dan | last=LeRoy | accessdate=7 August 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731083817/http://www.allmusic.com/album/absolute-beginners-mw0000202298 | archive-date=31 July 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref>  It was chosen by Jeremy Allen in ''[[The Guardian]]'' as one of Bowie's \"ten of the best\" songs.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/dec/03/david-bowie-10-of-the-best | title=David Bowie: 10 of the best | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Jeremy | last=Allen | date=3 December 2014 | accessdate=4 June 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308153635/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/dec/03/david-bowie-10-of-the-best | archive-date=8 March 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref> Biographer [[Paul Trynka]] described \"Absolute Beginners\" as \"Bowie's last great composition of the 1980s\",<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trynka|first1=Paul|title=David Bowie: Starman|date=2012|publisher=Sphere|isbn=978-0751542936|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZ44AQAAQBAJ&pg=PT357&lpg=PT357&dq=absolute+beginners+was+bowie%27s+last+great+composition+of+the+1980s&source=bl&ots=akdvVvrW5L&sig=cNfBYA523H41lgilLEJvt5uFtBU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjc5JT1vanOAhVCVxQKHUAeBf4Q6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=absolute%20beginners%20was%20bowie's%20last%20great%20composition%20of%20the%201980s&f=false|accessdate=5 August 2016}}</ref> while rock critic Chris O'Leary described it as \"gorgeous and valedictory,\" with \"one of the great Bowie melodies\" in its refrain.<ref>{{cite book |first=Chris|last=O'Leary |title=Ashes to Ashes: The Songs of David Bowie, 1976\u20132016|year=2019|page=230|publisher=Repeater Books|isbn=978-1912248308}}</ref>  ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' chose the song as number 61 in its countdown of Bowie's 100 greatest songs.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/mojo.html | title= David Bowie - The 100 Greatest Songs | work= Rocklist.net | accessdate= 8 November 2016 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100831002446/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/mojo.html | archive-date= 31 August 2010 | url-status= live }}</ref>  [[Don Weller (musician)|Don Weller]]'s saxophone solo has been described by [[musicOMH]] as \"perhaps the best\" saxophone solo in a Bowie song.

Released on 3 March 1986, it was the theme song to the 1986 [[Absolute Beginners (film)|film of the same name]] (itself an adaptation of the book ''[[Absolute Beginners (novel)|Absolute Beginners]]'').\n\nAlthough the film was not a commercial success, the song was a big hit: reached No. 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It also reached the top ten on the main singles charts in [[David Bowie discography| ten other countries]], becoming his last single to achieve that. It was less successful in the US, peaking at No. 53 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. \n\nBowie performed \"Absolute Beginners\" live on his 1987 [[Glass Spider Tour]], his 2000 [[Mini Tour (David Bowie)|\"Mini\" Tour]], and his 2002 [[Heathen Tour]]. The song has been included on a number of Bowie's compilation and \"Best-of\" releases, and was included as a bonus track on the 1995 re-release of ''[[Tonight (David Bowie album)|Tonight]]'' (1984).\n\n==Background and recording==\nBowie was good friends with the film's director, [[Julien Temple]] (who had worked with him in 1984 on the ''[[Jazzin' for Blue Jean]]'' short film). Bowie agreed to Temple's request to write music for the film if he could also play the part of Vendice Partners.\n\nIt was recorded at Langer & Winstanley's Westside Studios, London. The sessions were completed rapidly, but the song was delayed due to the problems with completing the film. [[Virgin Records|Virgin]] wanted the release to tie in with the film's opening. The song featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano, who had previously performed on Bowie's \"[[Space Oddity]]\" single and ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' album. Shortly after the sessions wrapped, [[Mick Jagger]] flew in to record the charity cover of \"[[Dancing in the Street]]\" with Bowie, which used many of the same musicians. Bowie recorded the lead vocal of \"Absolute Beginners\" at Westside Studios in August.<ref name=\"shepherd\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n[[AllMusic]] described \"Absolute Beginners\" as \"the gem of his post-''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' '80s output, a big, breathtaking ballad allowing him to indulge the [[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra]] croon that's driven many of his best performances\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/absolute-beginners-mw0000202298 | title=Absolute Beginners \u2013 Original Soundtrack | publisher=AllMusic | first=Dan | last=LeRoy | accessdate=7 August 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731083817/http://www.allmusic.com/album/absolute-beginners-mw0000202298 | archive-date=31 July 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref>  It was chosen by Jeremy Allen in ''[[The Guardian]]'' as one of Bowie's \"ten of the best\" songs.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/dec/03/david-bowie-10-of-the-best | title=David Bowie: 10 of the best | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Jeremy | last=Allen | date=3 December 2014 | accessdate=4 June 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308153635/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/dec/03/david-bowie-10-of-the-best | archive-date=8 March 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref> Biographer [[Paul Trynka]] described \"Absolute Beginners\" as \"Bowie's last great composition of the 1980s\",<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trynka|first1=Paul|title=David Bowie: Starman|date=2012|publisher=Sphere|isbn=978-0751542936|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZ44AQAAQBAJ&pg=PT357&lpg=PT357&dq=absolute+beginners+was+bowie%27s+last+great+composition+of+the+1980s&source=bl&ots=akdvVvrW5L&sig=cNfBYA523H41lgilLEJvt5uFtBU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjc5JT1vanOAhVCVxQKHUAeBf4Q6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=absolute%20beginners%20was%20bowie's%20last%20great%20composition%20of%20the%201980s&f=false|accessdate=5 August 2016}}</ref> while rock critic Chris O'Leary described it as \"gorgeous and valedictory,\" with \"one of the great Bowie melodies\" in its refrain.<ref>{{cite book |first=Chris|last=O'Leary |title=Ashes to Ashes: The Songs of David Bowie, 1976\u20132016|year=2019|page=230|publisher=Repeater Books|isbn=978-1912248308}}</ref>  ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' chose the song as number 61 in its countdown of Bowie's 100 greatest songs.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/mojo.html | title= David Bowie - The 100 Greatest Songs | work= Rocklist.net | accessdate= 8 November 2016 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100831002446/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/mojo.html | archive-date= 31 August 2010 | url-status= live }}</ref>  [[Don Weller (musician)|Don Weller]]'s saxophone solo has been described by [[musicOMH]] as \"perhaps the best\" saxophone solo in a Bowie song.

{"title_page": "History of Togo", "text_new": "{{Undue weight|date=October 2013}}\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nhistory of Togocan be traced to archaeological finds which indicate that ancient local tribes were able to produce [[pottery]] and process [[iron]]. During the period from the 11th century to the 16th century, the [[Ewe people|Ew\u00e9]], the [[Gen language|Mina]], the [[Fon language|Gun]], and various other tribes entered the region. Most of them settled in coastal areas.. The Portuguese arrived in the late 15th century, followed by other European powers. Until the 19th century, the coastal region was a major [[slave trade]] centre, earning Togo and the surrounding region the name \"The [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]]\".\n\nIn 1884, Germany claimed a coastal [[protectorate]], which grew inland until it became the [[German colonial empire|German colony]] of [[Togoland]] in 1905. A railway, the port of [[Lom\u00e9]], and other infrastructure were developed. During the [[First World War]], Togoland was invaded by [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]]. In 1922, Great Britain received the [[League of Nations]] mandate to govern the western part of Togo and France to govern the eastern part. After [[World War II]], these mandates became [[United Nations Trust Territories|UN Trust Territories]]. The residents of [[British Togoland]] voted to join the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] as part of the new independent nation of [[Ghana]] in 1957.\n\n[[French Togoland]] became the Togolese Republic in 1960. Its Constitution, adopted in 1961, instituted the [[National Assembly of Togo]] as the supreme legislative body. In the same year, the first president, [[Sylvanus Olympio]], dissolved the opposition parties and arrested their leaders. When he was assassinated in a coup in 1963, the military handed over power to an interim government led by [[Nicolas Grunitzky]].\n\nThe military leader [[Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma]] overthrew Grunitzky in a bloodless coup in 1967. He assumed the presidency and introduced a one-party system in 1969. Eyad\u00e9ma remained in power for the next 38 years. When he died in 2005, the military installed his son, [[Faure Gnassingb\u00e9]], as president. Gnassingbe held elections and won, but the opposition claimed fraud. Because of political violence, around 40,000 Togolese fled to neighboring countries. Gnassingb\u00e9 was reelected two more times. In late 2017, [[Anti-government protests in Togo, 2017|anti-government protests]] were suppressed by security forces.\n\n==Pre-colonial==\n{{History of Togo}}\nLittle is known about the '''history of [[Togo]]''' before the late fifteenth century, when Portuguese explorers arrived, although there are signs of Ewe settlement for several centuries before their arrival.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/coolplanet/ontheline/explore/journey/togo/history.htm |title=Cool Planet &#124; Oxfam Education |publisher=Oxfam.org.uk |accessdate=2013-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206211829/http://www.oxfam.org.uk/coolplanet/ontheline/explore/journey/togo/history.htm |archive-date=2012-02-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Various tribes moved into the country from all sides - the [[Ewe people|Ewe]] from [[Benin]], and the [[Mina people|Mina]] and the [[Guin people|Guin]] from [[Ghana]].

[[Gustav Nachtigal]], Germany's Commissioner for West Africa who oversaw both the inclusion of Togoland as well as [[Kamerun]] into the German colonial empire, had negotiated with King [[Mlapa III]] to gain control of the coast of what would eventually become Togoland, particularly the cities of [[Lom\u00e9]], [[Sebe]] and [[An\u00e9ho]]. France, at the time controller of neighboring [[Benin]], recognized German rule in the region on 24 December 1885.\n\nThe colony was established in part of what was then the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]] and German control was gradually extended inland. Because it became Germany's only self-supporting colony and because of its extensive rail and road infrastructure\u2014Germany had opened Togo's first rail line between Lom\u00e9 and An\u00e9ho in 1905\u2014Togoland was known as its model possession.<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=Togo under the German Flag|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/684|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 the colony was drawn into the conflict. It was invaded and quickly overrun by British and French forces during the [[Togoland campaign]] and placed under military rule. In 1916 the territory was divided into separate British and French administrative zones, and this was formalized in 1922 with the creation of [[British Togoland]] and [[French Togoland]].\n\n===League of Nations mandates===\n{{main|Togoland Campaign}}\n\n[[Image:Flag of Togo (1957-1958).svg|thumb|Flag of the Autonomous Republic of Togo (1957-1958)]]\nOn August 8, 1914, French and British forces invaded Togoland and the German forces there surrendered on 26 August. In 1916, Togoland was divided into French and British administrative zones. Following the war, Togoland formally became a [[League of Nations]] mandate divided for administrative purposes between France and the United Kingdom. After World War I, newly founded [[Czechoslovakia]] was also interested in this colony but this idea did not succeed. Lome was initially allocated to the British zone but after negotiations transferred to France 1 October 1920.\n\nAfter World War II, the mandate became a [[United Nations|UN]] trust territory administered by the United Kingdom and France. During the mandate and trusteeship periods, western Togo was administered as part of the [[British Gold Coast]]. In December 1956, the residents of British Togoland voted to join the Gold Coast as part of the new independent nation of Ghana.\n\n[[Image:Togoland.svg|lang=\"en\"|thumb|British Togoland shown in pale green, which joined with Ghana]] \nIn the [[French Togoland Representative Assembly election, 1946|Representative Assembly elections]] in 1946, there were two parties, the [[Party of Togolese Unity|Committee of Togolese Unity]] (CUT) and the [[Togolese Party of Progress]] (PTP). The CUT was overwhelmingly successful, and Sylvanus Olympio, the CUT leader became Council leader. However, the CUT was defeated in the [[French Togoland Representative Assembly election, 1951|1951 Representative Assembly elections]] and the [[French Togoland Territorial Assembly election, 1952|1952 Territorial Assembly elections]], and refused to participate in further French supervised elections because it claimed that the PTP was receiving French support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Togo-POLITICAL-PARTIES.html |title=Political parties - Togo - issues, system, power |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}</ref> By statute in 1955, French Togoland became an autonomous republic within the French union, although it retained its UN trusteeship status. Following [[French Togoland Territorial Assembly election, 1955|elections to the Territorial Assembly]] on 12 June 1955, which were boycotted by CUT, considerable power over internal affairs was granted, with an elected executive body headed by a Prime Minister responsible to the legislature. These changes were embodied in a constitution approved in a [[French Togoland autonomy referendum, 1956|1956 referendum]]. On 10 September 1956, [[Nicolas Grunitzky]] became Prime Minister of the Republic of Togo. However, due to irregularities in the plebiscite, a [[French Togoland parliamentary election, 1958|UN-supervised parliamentary election]] was held on 27 April 1958, the first held in Togo with [[universal suffrage]], which was won by the opposition pro-independence CUT and its leader [[Sylvanus Olympio]], who became Prime Minister. On 13 October 1958 the French government announced that full independence would be granted.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Togo.aspx |title=Togo Facts, information, pictures &#124; Encyclopedia.com articles about Togo |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=2013-10-31}}</ref> On 14 November 1958 the United Nations\u2019 General Assembly took note of the French government's declaration according to which Togo which was under French administration would gain independence in 1960, thus marking an end to the trusteeship period.<ref>{{cite web|title=The future of Togoland under French administration|url=https://undocs.org/A/RES/1253(XIII)|website=undocs.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=17 March 2017|language=en|id=A/RES/1253(XIII) }}</ref> On 5 December 1959 the United Nations\u2019 General Assembly resolved that the UN Trusteeship Agreement with France for Cameroon would end when Togo became independent on 27 April 1960.<ref>{{cite web|title=Date of the independence of the Trust Territory of Togoland under French administration|url=https://undocs.org/A/RES/1416(XIV)|website=undocs.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=17 March 2017|id=A/RES/1416(XIV) |language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 April 1960, in a smooth transition, Togo severed its constitutional ties with France, shed its UN trusteeship status, and became fully independent under a provisional constitution with Olympio as president.\n\n==Independence and turmoil==\nA new constitution adopted [[Togolese constitutional referendum, 1961|by referendum]] in 1961 established an executive president, elected for 7 years by universal suffrage and a weak National Assembly. The president was empowered to appoint ministers and dissolve the assembly, holding a monopoly of executive power. In [[Togolese general election, 1961|elections that year]], from which Grunitzky's party was disqualified, Olympio's party won 100% of the vote and all 51 National Assembly seats, and he became Togo's first elected president.\n\nDuring this period, four principal political parties existed in Togo: the leftist [[Juvento]], the [[Democratic Union of the Togolese People]] (UDPT), the PTP, founded by Grunitzky but having limited support, and the [[Party of Togolese Unity]], the party of President Olympio. Rivalries between elements of these parties had begun as early as the 1940s, and they came to a head with Olympio dissolving the opposition parties in January 1962 because of alleged plots against the majority party government. The reign of Olympio was marked by the terror of his militia, the [[Ablode Sodjas]]. Many opposition members, including Grunitzky and Meatchi, were jailed or fled to avoid arrest.\n\nOn 13 January 1963 Olympio was overthrown and killed in a [[1963 Togolese coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] led by army non-commissioned officers dissatisfied with conditions following their discharge from the French army. Grunitzky returned from exile 2 days later to head a provisional government with the title of prime minister. On 5 May 1963, the Togolese adopted a new constitution [[Togolese constitutional referendum, 1963|by referendum]], which reinstated a multi-party system. They also voted in a [[Togolese general election, 1963|general election]] to choose deputies from all political parties for the National Assembly, and elected Grunitzky as president and [[Antoine Meatchi]] as vice president. Nine days later, President Grunitzky formed a government in which all parties were represented.\n\nDuring the next several years, the Grunitzky government's power became insecure. On 21 November 1966, an attempt to overthrow Grunitzky, inspired principally by civilian political opponents in the UT party, was unsuccessful. Grunitzky then tried to lessen his reliance on the army, but on 13 January 1967, a [[1967 Togolese coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] led by Lt. Col. [[\u00c9tienne Eyad\u00e9ma]] (later Gen. Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma) and [[Kl\u00e9ber Dadjo]] ousted President Grunitzky without bloodshed. Following the coup, political parties were banned, and all constitutional processes were suspended. Dadjo became the chairman of the \"committee of national reconciliation\", which ruled the country until 14 April, when Eyad\u00e9ma assumed the presidency. In late 1969, a single national political party, the [[Rally of the Togolese People]] (RPT), was created, and President Eyad\u00e9ma was elected party president on 29 November 1969. In 1972, a [[Togolese presidential referendum, 1972|referendum]], in which Eyad\u00e9ma ran unopposed, confirmed his role as the country's president.\n\n==Eyad\u00e9ma's rule==\n===The third republic===\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Gnassingbe Eyadema.jpg|frame|right|Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma]] -->\nIn late 1979, Eyad\u00e9ma declared a third republic and a transition to greater civilian rule with a mixed civilian and military cabinet. He garnered 99.97% of the vote in uncontested presidential elections held in late 1979 and early 1980. A new constitution also provided for a national assembly to serve primarily as a consultative body. Eyad\u00e9ma was reelected to a third consecutive 7-year term in December 1986 with 99.5% of the vote in an uncontested election. On 23 September 1986, a group of some 70 armed Togolese dissidents crossed into Lom\u00e9 from Ghana in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the Eyad\u00e9ma government.\n\n===Opposition===\nIn 1989 and 1990, Togo, like many other countries, was affected by the winds of democratic change sweeping Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. On 5 October 1990, the trial of students who handed out antigovernment tracts sparked riots in Lom\u00e9. Antigovernment demonstrations and violent clashes with the security forces marked the months that followed. In April 1991, the government began negotiations with newly formed opposition groups and agreed to a general amnesty that permitted exiled political opponents to return to Togo. After a general strike and further demonstrations, the government and opposition signed an agreement to hold a \"national forum\" on 12 June 1991.\n\nThe national forum, dominated by opponents of President Eyad\u00e9ma, opened in July 1991 and immediately declared itself to be a sovereign \"National Conference.\" Although subjected to severe harassment from the government, the conference drafted an interim constitution calling for a 1-year transitional regime tasked with organizing free elections for a new government. The conference selected [[Joseph Kokou Koffigoh]], a lawyer and human rights group head, as transitional prime minister but kept President Eyad\u00e9ma as chief of state for the transition, although with limited powers.\n\nA test of wills between the president and his opponents followed over the next 3 years during which President Eyad\u00e9ma gradually gained the upper hand. Frequent political paralysis and intermittent violence marked this period. Following a vote by the transitional legislature (High Council of the Republic) to dissolve the President's political party\u2014the RPT\u2014in November 1991, the army attacked the prime minister's office on 3 December and captured the prime minister. Koffigoh then formed a second transition government in January 1992 with substantial participation by ministers from the President's party. Opposition leader [[Gilchrist Olympio]], son of the slain president Sylvanus Olympio, was ambushed and seriously wounded apparently by soldiers on 5 May 1992.\n\nIn July and August 1992, a commission composed of presidential and opposition representatives negotiated a new political agreement. On 27 September, the public overwhelmingly approved the text of a new, democratic constitution, formally initiating Togo's fourth republic.\n\n===Powerless legislature and political violence===\nThe democratic process was set back in October 1991, when elements of the army held the interim legislature hostage for 24 hours. This effectively put an end to the interim legislature. In retaliation, on 16 November, opposition political parties and labor unions declared a general strike intended to force President Eyad\u00e9ma to agree to satisfactory conditions for elections. The general strike largely shut down Lom\u00e9 for months and resulted in severe damage to the economy.\n\nIn January 1993, President Eyad\u00e9ma declared the transition at an end and reappointed Koffigoh as prime minister under Eyad\u00e9ma's authority. This set off public demonstrations, and, on 25 January, members of the security forces fired on peaceful demonstrators, killing at least 19. In the ensuing days, several security force members were waylaid and injured or killed by civilian oppositionists. On 30 January 1993, elements of the military went on an 8-hour rampage throughout Lom\u00e9, firing indiscriminately and killing at least 12 people. This incident provoked more than 300,000 Togolese to flee Lom\u00e9 for Benin, Ghana, or the interior of Togo. Although most had returned by early 1996, some still remain abroad.\n\nOn 25 March 1993, armed Togolese dissident commandos based in Ghana attacked Lom\u00e9's main military camp and tried unsuccessfully to kill President Eyad\u00e9ma. They inflicted significant casualties, however, which set off lethal reprisals by the military against soldiers thought to be associated with the attackers.\n\n===Negotiating with the opposition===\nUnder substantial domestic and foreign pressure and the burden of the general strike, the presidential faction entered negotiations with the opposition in early 1993. Four rounds of talks led to the 11 July [[Ouagadougou agreement]] setting forth conditions for upcoming presidential and legislative elections and ending the general strike as of 3 August 1993. The presidential elections were set for 25 August, but hasty and inadequate technical preparations, concerns about fraud, and the lack of effective campaign organization by the opposition led the chief opposition candidates\u2014former minister and [[Organization of African Unity]] Secretary General [[Edem Kodjo]] and lawyer [[Yawovi Agboyibo]]\u2014to drop out of the race before election day and to call for a boycott. President Eyad\u00e9ma won the elections by a 96.42% vote against token opposition. About 36% of the voters went to the polls; the others boycotted.\n\nGhana-based armed dissidents launched a new commando attack on military sites in Lom\u00e9 in January 1994. President Eyad\u00e9ma was unhurt, and the attack and subsequent reaction by the Togolese armed forces resulted in hundreds of deaths, mostly civilian. The government went ahead with legislative elections on 6 February and 20 February 1994. In generally free and fair polls as witnessed by international observers, the allied opposition parties UTD and CAR together won a narrow majority in the National Assembly.\n\n===Edem Kodjo named as Prime Minister===\nOn April 22, President Eyad\u00e9ma named Edem Kodjo, the head of the smaller opposition party, the UTD, as prime minister instead of Yawovi Agboyibo, whose CAR party had far more seats. Kodjo's acceptance of the post of prime minister provoked the CAR to break the opposition alliance and refuse to join the Kodjo government. \n<!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:Edem Kodjo and Jacques Chirac.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Togolese politician '''Edem Kodjo''' (left) and French [[President of France|President]] [[Jacques Chirac]] in 1995.]] -->\nKodjo was then forced to form a governing coalition with the RPT. Kodjo's government emphasized economic recovery, building democratic institutions and the rule of law and the return of Togolese refugees abroad. In early 1995, the government made slow progress toward its goals, aided by the CAR's August 1995 decision to end a 9-month boycott of the National Assembly. However, Kodjo was forced to reshuffle his government in late 1995, strengthening the representation by Eyad\u00e9ma's RPT party, and he resigned in August 1996. Since then, Eyad\u00e9ma has reemerged with a sure grip on power, controlling most aspects of government.\n\nIn the June 1998 presidential election, the government prevented citizens from effectively exercising the right to vote. The Interior Ministry declared Eyad\u00e9ma the winner with 52% of the vote in the 1998 election; however, serious irregularities in the government's conduct of the election strongly favored the incumbent and appear to have affected the outcome materially. Although the government did not obstruct the functioning of political opponents openly, the President used the strength of the military and his government allies to intimidate and harass citizens and opposition groups. The government and the state remained highly centralized: President Eyad\u00e9ma's national government appointed the officials and controlled the budgets of all subnational government entities, including prefectures and municipalities, and influenced the selection of traditional chiefs.\n\n===National Assembly elections===\nThe second multi-party legislative elections of Eyad\u00e9ma's 33-year rule were held on 21 March 1999. However, the opposition [[election boycott|boycotted the election]], in which the ruling party won 79 of the 81 seats in the National Assembly. Those two seats went to candidates from little-known independent parties. Procedural problems and significant fraud, particularly misrepresentation of voter turnout marred the legislative elections. \nAfter the legislative election, the government announced that it would continue to pursue dialog with the opposition. In June 1999, the RPT and opposition parties met in Paris, in the presence of facilitators representing France, Germany, the [[European Union]], and [[La Francophonie]] (an international organization of French-speaking countries), to agree on security measures for formal negotiations in Lom\u00e9. In July 1999, the government and the opposition began discussions, and on 29 July 1999, all sides signed an accord called the \"[[Lom\u00e9 Framework Agreement]]\", which included a pledge by President Eyad\u00e9ma that he would respect the constitution and not seek another term as president after his current one expires in 2003. The accord also called for the negotiation of a legal status for opposition leaders, as well as for former heads of state (such as their immunity from prosecution for acts in office). In addition, the accord addressed the rights and duties of political parties and the media, the safe return of refugees, and the security of all citizens. The accord also contained a provision for compensating victims of political violence. The President also agreed to dissolve the National Assembly in March and hold new legislative elections, which would be supervised by an independent national election commission ({{Interlanguage link multi|Independent National Electoral Commission (Togo)|fr|3=Commission \u00e9lectorale nationale ind\u00e9pendante (Togo)|lt=CENI}}) and which would use the single-ballot method to protect against some of the abuses of past elections. However, the March 2000 date passed without presidential action, and new legislative elections were ultimately rescheduled for October 2001. Because of funding problems and disagreements between the government and opposition, the elections were again delayed, this time until March 2002.\n\nIn May 2002 the government scrapped CENI, blaming the opposition for its inability to function. In its stead, the government appointed seven magistrates to oversee preparations for legislative elections. Not surprisingly, the opposition announced it would boycott them. Held in October, as a result of the opposition's boycott the government party won more than two-thirds of the seats in the National Assembly. In December 2002, Eyad\u00e9ma's government used this rubber-stamp parliament to amend Togo's constitution, allowing President Eyad\u00e9ma to run for an \u201cunlimited\u201d number of terms. A further amendment stated that candidates must reside in the country for at least 12 months before an election, a provision that barred the participation in the upcoming presidential election of popular [[Union des Forces du Progr\u00e8s]] (UFC) candidate, Gilchrist Olympio, who had been in exile since 1992. The presidential election was held 1 June. President Eyad\u00e9ma was re-elected with 57% of the votes, amid allegations of widespread vote rigging.\n\n== Death of Eyad\u00e9ma and Gnassingb\u00e9's rise ==\n[[Image:Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 29112006.jpg|right|thumb|210px|Faure Gnassingb\u00e9]]\nPresident Eyad\u00e9ma died on 5 February 2005 while on board an airplane en route to France for treatment for a heart attack. Papa Gnassingb\u00e9 is said to have killed more than fifteen thousand people during his dictatorship. His son [[Faure Gnassingb\u00e9]], the country's former minister of public works, mines, and telecommunications, was named President by Togo's military following the announcement of his father's death. Under international pressure from the [[African Union]] and the [[United Nations]] however, who both denounced the transfer of power from father to son as a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]], Gnassingb\u00e9 was forced to step down on 25 February 2005, shortly after accepting the nomination to run for elections in April. Deputy Speaker [[Bonfoh Abbass]] was appointed interim president until the inauguration of the 24 April election winner. As to official results, the winner of the [[Togolese presidential election, 2005|election]] was Gnassingb\u00e9 who garnered 60% of the vote. Opposition leader [[Emmanuel Bob-Akitani]] however disputed the election and declared himself to be the winner with 70% of the vote. After the announcement of the results, tensions flared up and to date, 100 people have been killed. On 3 May 2005, Gnassingb\u00e9 was sworn in and vowed to concentrate on \"the promotion of development, the common good, peace and national unity\".\n\nIn August 2006 President Gnassingbe and members of the opposition signed the Global Political Agreement (GPA), bringing an end to the political crisis trigged by Gnassingbe Eyadema's death in February 2005 and the flawed and violent electoral process that followed. The GPA provided for a transitional unity government whose primary purpose would be to prepare for benchmark legislative elections, originally scheduled for June 24, 2007. CAR opposition party leader and human rights lawyer Yawovi Agboyibo was appointed Prime Minister of the transitional government in September 2006. Leopold Gnininvi, president of the CDPA party, was appointed minister of state for mines and energy. The third opposition party, UFC, headed by Gilchrist Olympio, declined to join the government, but agreed to participate in the national electoral commission and the National Dialogue follow-up committee, chaired by Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore.\n\n[[Togolese parliamentary election, 2007|Parliamentary elections]] took place on October 14, 2007. Olympio, who returned from exile to campaign, took part for the first time in 17 years. The ruling party, [[Rally of the Togolese People]](RPT), won a majority of the parliamentary seats in the election which international observers declared the poll \"largely\" free and fair. Despite these assurances, the secretary-general of the opposition party [[Union of Forces for Change]](UFC) initially state that his party would not accept the election results.<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2007-10/2007-10-17-voa40.cfm?CFID=267582543&CFTOKEN=95745360 ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref>\nMr Olympio stated that the election results did not properly represent the voters' will, pointing out that the UFC received nearly as many votes as the RPT, but that due to the way the electoral system was designed the UFC won far fewer seats.<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2007-12/2007-12-04-voa53.cfm?CFID=267586544&CFTOKEN=71565589 ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Africa]]\n*[[History of West Africa]]\n*[[List of heads of government of Togo]]\n*[[List of heads of state of Togo]]\n*[[Politics of Togo]]\n* Lom\u00e9 [[Lom\u00e9#History|history]] and [[Timeline of Lom\u00e9|timeline]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5430.htm Most of the information here is derived from the U.S. Department of State website on Togo.]\n\n==Further reading==\n*Chafer, Tony.

During the period from the 11th century to the 16th century, the [[Ewe people|Ew\u00e9]], the [[Gen language|Mina]], the [[Fon language|Gun]], and various other tribes entered the region. Most of them settled in coastal areas.. The Portuguese arrived in the late 15th century, followed by other European powers. Until the 19th century, the coastal region was a major [[slave trade]] centre, earning Togo and the surrounding region the name \"The [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]]\".\n\nIn 1884, Germany claimed a coastal [[protectorate]], which grew inland until it became the [[German colonial empire|German colony]] of [[Togoland]] in 1905. A railway, the port of [[Lom\u00e9]], and other infrastructure were developed. During the [[First World War]], Togoland was invaded by [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]]. In 1922, Great Britain received the [[League of Nations]] mandate to govern the western part of Togo and France to govern the eastern part. After [[World War II]], these mandates became [[United Nations Trust Territories|UN Trust Territories]]. The residents of [[British Togoland]] voted to join the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] as part of the new independent nation of [[Ghana]] in 1957.\n\n[[French Togoland]] became the Togolese Republic in 1960. Its Constitution, adopted in 1961, instituted the [[National Assembly of Togo]] as the supreme legislative body. In the same year, the first president, [[Sylvanus Olympio]], dissolved the opposition parties and arrested their leaders. When he was assassinated in a coup in 1963, the military handed over power to an interim government led by [[Nicolas Grunitzky]].\n\nThe military leader [[Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma]] overthrew Grunitzky in a bloodless coup in 1967. He assumed the presidency and introduced a one-party system in 1969. Eyad\u00e9ma remained in power for the next 38 years. When he died in 2005, the military installed his son, [[Faure Gnassingb\u00e9]], as president. Gnassingbe held elections and won, but the opposition claimed fraud. Because of political violence, around 40,000 Togolese fled to neighboring countries. Gnassingb\u00e9 was reelected two more times.

[[Gustav Nachtigal]], Germany's Commissioner for West Africa who oversaw both the inclusion of Togoland as well as [[Kamerun]] into the German colonial empire, had negotiated with King [[Mlapa III]] to gain control of the coast of what would eventually become Togoland, particularly the cities of [[Lom\u00e9]], [[Sebe]] and [[An\u00e9ho]]. France, at the time controller of neighboring [[Benin]], recognized German rule in the region on 24 December 1885.\n\nThe colony was established in part of what was then the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]] and German control was gradually extended inland. Because it became Germany's only self-supporting colony and because of its extensive rail and road infrastructure\u2014Germany had opened Togo's first rail line between Lom\u00e9 and An\u00e9ho in 1905\u2014Togoland was known as its model possession.<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=Togo under the German Flag|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/684|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 the colony was drawn into the conflict. It was invaded and quickly overrun by British and French forces during the [[Togoland campaign]] and placed under military rule. In 1916 the territory was divided into separate British and French administrative zones, and this was formalized in 1922 with the creation of [[British Togoland]] and [[French Togoland]].\n\n===League of Nations mandates===\n{{main|Togoland Campaign}}\n\n[[Image:Flag of Togo (1957-1958).svg|thumb|Flag of the Autonomous Republic of Togo (1957-1958)]]\nOn August 8, 1914, French and British forces invaded Togoland and the German forces there surrendered on 26 August. In 1916, Togoland was divided into French and British administrative zones. Following the war, Togoland formally became a [[League of Nations]] mandate divided for administrative purposes between France and the United Kingdom. After World War I, newly founded [[Czechoslovakia]] was also interested in this colony but this idea did not succeed. Lome was initially allocated to the British zone but after negotiations transferred to France 1 October 1920.\n\nAfter World War II, the mandate became a [[United Nations|UN]] trust territory administered by the United Kingdom and France. During the mandate and trusteeship periods, western Togo was administered as part of the [[British Gold Coast]]. In December 1956, the residents of British Togoland voted to join the Gold Coast as part of the new independent nation of Ghana.\n\n[[Image:Togoland.svg|lang=\"en\"|thumb|British Togoland shown in pale green, which joined with Ghana]] \nIn the [[French Togoland Representative Assembly election, 1946|Representative Assembly elections]] in 1946, there were two parties, the [[Party of Togolese Unity|Committee of Togolese Unity]] (CUT) and the [[Togolese Party of Progress]] (PTP). The CUT was overwhelmingly successful, and Sylvanus Olympio, the CUT leader became Council leader. However, the CUT was defeated in the [[French Togoland Representative Assembly election, 1951|1951 Representative Assembly elections]] and the [[French Togoland Territorial Assembly election, 1952|1952 Territorial Assembly elections]], and refused to participate in further French supervised elections because it claimed that the PTP was receiving French support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Togo-POLITICAL-PARTIES.html |title=Political parties - Togo - issues, system, power |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}</ref> By statute in 1955, French Togoland became an autonomous republic within the French union, although it retained its UN trusteeship status. Following [[French Togoland Territorial Assembly election, 1955|elections to the Territorial Assembly]] on 12 June 1955, which were boycotted by CUT, considerable power over internal affairs was granted, with an elected executive body headed by a Prime Minister responsible to the legislature. These changes were embodied in a constitution approved in a [[French Togoland autonomy referendum, 1956|1956 referendum]]. On 10 September 1956, [[Nicolas Grunitzky]] became Prime Minister of the Republic of Togo. However, due to irregularities in the plebiscite, a [[French Togoland parliamentary election, 1958|UN-supervised parliamentary election]] was held on 27 April 1958, the first held in Togo with [[universal suffrage]], which was won by the opposition pro-independence CUT and its leader [[Sylvanus Olympio]], who became Prime Minister.

The president was empowered to appoint ministers and dissolve the assembly, holding a monopoly of executive power. In [[Togolese general election, 1961|elections that year]], from which Grunitzky's party was disqualified, Olympio's party won 100% of the vote and all 51 National Assembly seats, and he became Togo's first elected president.\n\nDuring this period, four principal political parties existed in Togo: the leftist [[Juvento]], the [[Democratic Union of the Togolese People]] (UDPT), the PTP, founded by Grunitzky but having limited support, and the [[Party of Togolese Unity]], the party of President Olympio. Rivalries between elements of these parties had begun as early as the 1940s, and they came to a head with Olympio dissolving the opposition parties in January 1962 because of alleged plots against the majority party government. The reign of Olympio was marked by the terror of his militia, the [[Ablode Sodjas]]. Many opposition members, including Grunitzky and Meatchi, were jailed or fled to avoid arrest.\n\nOn 13 January 1963 Olympio was overthrown and killed in a [[1963 Togolese coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] led by army non-commissioned officers dissatisfied with conditions following their discharge from the French army. Grunitzky returned from exile 2 days later to head a provisional government with the title of prime minister. On 5 May 1963, the Togolese adopted a new constitution [[Togolese constitutional referendum, 1963|by referendum]], which reinstated a multi-party system. They also voted in a [[Togolese general election, 1963|general election]] to choose deputies from all political parties for the National Assembly, and elected Grunitzky as president and [[Antoine Meatchi]] as vice president. Nine days later, President Grunitzky formed a government in which all parties were represented.\n\nDuring the next several years, the Grunitzky government's power became insecure. On 21 November 1966, an attempt to overthrow Grunitzky, inspired principally by civilian political opponents in the UT party, was unsuccessful. Grunitzky then tried to lessen his reliance on the army, but on 13 January 1967, a [[1967 Togolese coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] led by Lt. Col. [[\u00c9tienne Eyad\u00e9ma]] (later Gen. Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma) and [[Kl\u00e9ber Dadjo]] ousted President Grunitzky without bloodshed. Following the coup, political parties were banned, and all constitutional processes were suspended. Dadjo became the chairman of the \"committee of national reconciliation\", which ruled the country until 14 April, when Eyad\u00e9ma assumed the presidency. In late 1969, a single national political party, the [[Rally of the Togolese People]] (RPT), was created, and President Eyad\u00e9ma was elected party president on 29 November 1969. In 1972, a [[Togolese presidential referendum, 1972|referendum]], in which Eyad\u00e9ma ran unopposed, confirmed his role as the country's president.\n\n==Eyad\u00e9ma's rule==\n===The third republic===\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Gnassingbe Eyadema.jpg|frame|right|Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma]] -->\nIn late 1979, Eyad\u00e9ma declared a third republic and a transition to greater civilian rule with a mixed civilian and military cabinet. He garnered 99.97% of the vote in uncontested presidential elections held in late 1979 and early 1980. A new constitution also provided for a national assembly to serve primarily as a consultative body. Eyad\u00e9ma was reelected to a third consecutive 7-year term in December 1986 with 99.5% of the vote in an uncontested election. On 23 September 1986, a group of some 70 armed Togolese dissidents crossed into Lom\u00e9 from Ghana in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the Eyad\u00e9ma government.\n\n===Opposition===\nIn 1989 and 1990, Togo, like many other countries, was affected by the winds of democratic change sweeping Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. On 5 October 1990, the trial of students who handed out antigovernment tracts sparked riots in Lom\u00e9. Antigovernment demonstrations and violent clashes with the security forces marked the months that followed. In April 1991, the government began negotiations with newly formed opposition groups and agreed to a general amnesty that permitted exiled political opponents to return to Togo. After a general strike and further demonstrations, the government and opposition signed an agreement to hold a \"national forum\" on 12 June 1991.\n\nThe national forum, dominated by opponents of President Eyad\u00e9ma, opened in July 1991 and immediately declared itself to be a sovereign \"National Conference.\" Although subjected to severe harassment from the government, the conference drafted an interim constitution calling for a 1-year transitional regime tasked with organizing free elections for a new government. The conference selected [[Joseph Kokou Koffigoh]], a lawyer and human rights group head, as transitional prime minister but kept President Eyad\u00e9ma as chief of state for the transition, although with limited powers.\n\nA test of wills between the president and his opponents followed over the next 3 years during which President Eyad\u00e9ma gradually gained the upper hand. Frequent political paralysis and intermittent violence marked this period. Following a vote by the transitional legislature (High Council of the Republic) to dissolve the President's political party\u2014the RPT\u2014in November 1991, the army attacked the prime minister's office on 3 December and captured the prime minister. Koffigoh then formed a second transition government in January 1992 with substantial participation by ministers from the President's party. Opposition leader [[Gilchrist Olympio]], son of the slain president Sylvanus Olympio, was ambushed and seriously wounded apparently by soldiers on 5 May 1992.\n\nIn July and August 1992, a commission composed of presidential and opposition representatives negotiated a new political agreement. On 27 September, the public overwhelmingly approved the text of a new, democratic constitution, formally initiating Togo's fourth republic.\n\n===Powerless legislature and political violence===\nThe democratic process was set back in October 1991, when elements of the army held the interim legislature hostage for 24 hours. This effectively put an end to the interim legislature. In retaliation, on 16 November, opposition political parties and labor unions declared a general strike intended to force President Eyad\u00e9ma to agree to satisfactory conditions for elections. The general strike largely shut down Lom\u00e9 for months and resulted in severe damage to the economy.\n\nIn January 1993, President Eyad\u00e9ma declared the transition at an end and reappointed Koffigoh as prime minister under Eyad\u00e9ma's authority. This set off public demonstrations, and, on 25 January, members of the security forces fired on peaceful demonstrators, killing at least 19. In the ensuing days, several security force members were waylaid and injured or killed by civilian oppositionists. On 30 January 1993, elements of the military went on an 8-hour rampage throughout Lom\u00e9, firing indiscriminately and killing at least 12 people. This incident provoked more than 300,000 Togolese to flee Lom\u00e9 for Benin, Ghana, or the interior of Togo. Although most had returned by early 1996, some still remain abroad.\n\nOn 25 March 1993, armed Togolese dissident commandos based in Ghana attacked Lom\u00e9's main military camp and tried unsuccessfully to kill President Eyad\u00e9ma. They inflicted significant casualties, however, which set off lethal reprisals by the military against soldiers thought to be associated with the attackers.\n\n===Negotiating with the opposition===\nUnder substantial domestic and foreign pressure and the burden of the general strike, the presidential faction entered negotiations with the opposition in early 1993. Four rounds of talks led to the 11 July [[Ouagadougou agreement]] setting forth conditions for upcoming presidential and legislative elections and ending the general strike as of 3 August 1993. The presidential elections were set for 25 August, but hasty and inadequate technical preparations, concerns about fraud, and the lack of effective campaign organization by the opposition led the chief opposition candidates\u2014former minister and [[Organization of African Unity]] Secretary General [[Edem Kodjo]] and lawyer [[Yawovi Agboyibo]]\u2014to drop out of the race before election day and to call for a boycott. President Eyad\u00e9ma won the elections by a 96.42% vote against token opposition. About 36% of the voters went to the polls; the others boycotted.\n\nGhana-based armed dissidents launched a new commando attack on military sites in Lom\u00e9 in January 1994. President Eyad\u00e9ma was unhurt, and the attack and subsequent reaction by the Togolese armed forces resulted in hundreds of deaths, mostly civilian. The government went ahead with legislative elections on 6 February and 20 February 1994. In generally free and fair polls as witnessed by international observers, the allied opposition parties UTD and CAR together won a narrow majority in the National Assembly.\n\n===Edem Kodjo named as Prime Minister===\nOn April 22, President Eyad\u00e9ma named Edem Kodjo, the head of the smaller opposition party, the UTD, as prime minister instead of Yawovi Agboyibo, whose CAR party had far more seats. Kodjo's acceptance of the post of prime minister provoked the CAR to break the opposition alliance and refuse to join the Kodjo government. \n<!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:Edem Kodjo and Jacques Chirac.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Togolese politician '''Edem Kodjo''' (left) and French [[President of France|President]] [[Jacques Chirac]] in 1995.]] -->\nKodjo was then forced to form a governing coalition with the RPT. Kodjo's government emphasized economic recovery, building democratic institutions and the rule of law and the return of Togolese refugees abroad. In early 1995, the government made slow progress toward its goals, aided by the CAR's August 1995 decision to end a 9-month boycott of the National Assembly. However, Kodjo was forced to reshuffle his government in late 1995, strengthening the representation by Eyad\u00e9ma's RPT party, and he resigned in August 1996. Since then, Eyad\u00e9ma has reemerged with a sure grip on power, controlling most aspects of government.\n\nIn the June 1998 presidential election, the government prevented citizens from effectively exercising the right to vote. The Interior Ministry declared Eyad\u00e9ma the winner with 52% of the vote in the 1998 election; however, serious irregularities in the government's conduct of the election strongly favored the incumbent and appear to have affected the outcome materially. Although the government did not obstruct the functioning of political opponents openly, the President used the strength of the military and his government allies to intimidate and harass citizens and opposition groups. The government and the state remained highly centralized: President Eyad\u00e9ma's national government appointed the officials and controlled the budgets of all subnational government entities, including prefectures and municipalities, and influenced the selection of traditional chiefs.\n\n===National Assembly elections===\nThe second multi-party legislative elections of Eyad\u00e9ma's 33-year rule were held on 21 March 1999. However, the opposition [[election boycott|boycotted the election]], in which the ruling party won 79 of the 81 seats in the National Assembly. Those two seats went to candidates from little-known independent parties. Procedural problems and significant fraud, particularly misrepresentation of voter turnout marred the legislative elections. \nAfter the legislative election, the government announced that it would continue to pursue dialog with the opposition. In June 1999, the RPT and opposition parties met in Paris, in the presence of facilitators representing France, Germany, the [[European Union]], and [[La Francophonie]] (an international organization of French-speaking countries), to agree on security measures for formal negotiations in Lom\u00e9. In July 1999, the government and the opposition began discussions, and on 29 July 1999, all sides signed an accord called the \"[[Lom\u00e9 Framework Agreement]]\", which included a pledge by President Eyad\u00e9ma that he would respect the constitution and not seek another term as president after his current one expires in 2003. The accord also called for the negotiation of a legal status for opposition leaders, as well as for former heads of state (such as their immunity from prosecution for acts in office). In addition, the accord addressed the rights and duties of political parties and the media, the safe return of refugees, and the security of all citizens. The accord also contained a provision for compensating victims of political violence. The President also agreed to dissolve the National Assembly in March and hold new legislative elections, which would be supervised by an independent national election commission ({{Interlanguage link multi|Independent National Electoral Commission (Togo)|fr|3=Commission \u00e9lectorale nationale ind\u00e9pendante (Togo)|lt=CENI}}) and which would use the single-ballot method to protect against some of the abuses of past elections. However, the March 2000 date passed without presidential action, and new legislative elections were ultimately rescheduled for October 2001. Because of funding problems and disagreements between the government and opposition, the elections were again delayed, this time until March 2002.\n\nIn May 2002 the government scrapped CENI, blaming the opposition for its inability to function. In its stead, the government appointed seven magistrates to oversee preparations for legislative elections. Not surprisingly, the opposition announced it would boycott them. Held in October, as a result of the opposition's boycott the government party won more than two-thirds of the seats in the National Assembly. In December 2002, Eyad\u00e9ma's government used this rubber-stamp parliament to amend Togo's constitution, allowing President Eyad\u00e9ma to run for an \u201cunlimited\u201d number of terms. A further amendment stated that candidates must reside in the country for at least 12 months before an election, a provision that barred the participation in the upcoming presidential election of popular [[Union des Forces du Progr\u00e8s]] (UFC) candidate, Gilchrist Olympio, who had been in exile since 1992. The presidential election was held 1 June. President Eyad\u00e9ma was re-elected with 57% of the votes, amid allegations of widespread vote rigging.\n\n== Death of Eyad\u00e9ma and Gnassingb\u00e9's rise ==\n[[Image:Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 29112006.jpg|right|thumb|210px|Faure Gnassingb\u00e9]]\nPresident Eyad\u00e9ma died on 5 February 2005 while on board an airplane en route to France for treatment for a heart attack. Papa Gnassingb\u00e9 is said to have killed more than fifteen thousand people during his dictatorship. His son [[Faure Gnassingb\u00e9]], the country's former minister of public works, mines, and telecommunications, was named President by Togo's military following the announcement of his father's death. Under international pressure from the [[African Union]] and the [[United Nations]] however, who both denounced the transfer of power from father to son as a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]], Gnassingb\u00e9 was forced to step down on 25 February 2005, shortly after accepting the nomination to run for elections in April. Deputy Speaker [[Bonfoh Abbass]] was appointed interim president until the inauguration of the 24 April election winner. As to official results, the winner of the [[Togolese presidential election, 2005|election]] was Gnassingb\u00e9 who garnered 60% of the vote. Opposition leader [[Emmanuel Bob-Akitani]] however disputed the election and declared himself to be the winner with 70% of the vote. After the announcement of the results, tensions flared up and to date, 100 people have been killed. On 3 May 2005, Gnassingb\u00e9 was sworn in and vowed to concentrate on \"the promotion of development, the common good, peace and national unity\".\n\nIn August 2006 President Gnassingbe and members of the opposition signed the Global Political Agreement (GPA), bringing an end to the political crisis trigged by Gnassingbe Eyadema's death in February 2005 and the flawed and violent electoral process that followed. The GPA provided for a transitional unity government whose primary purpose would be to prepare for benchmark legislative elections, originally scheduled for June 24, 2007. CAR opposition party leader and human rights lawyer Yawovi Agboyibo was appointed Prime Minister of the transitional government in September 2006. Leopold Gnininvi, president of the CDPA party, was appointed minister of state for mines and energy. The third opposition party, UFC, headed by Gilchrist Olympio, declined to join the government, but agreed to participate in the national electoral commission and the National Dialogue follow-up committee, chaired by Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore.\n\n[[Togolese parliamentary election, 2007|Parliamentary elections]] took place on October 14, 2007. Olympio, who returned from exile to campaign, took part for the first time in 17 years. The ruling party, [[Rally of the Togolese People]](RPT), won a majority of the parliamentary seats in the election which international observers declared the poll \"largely\" free and fair. Despite these assurances, the secretary-general of the opposition party [[Union of Forces for Change]](UFC) initially state that his party would not accept the election results.<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2007-10/2007-10-17-voa40.cfm?CFID=267582543&CFTOKEN=95745360 ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref>\nMr Olympio stated that the election results did not properly represent the voters' will, pointing out that the UFC received nearly as many votes as the RPT, but that due to the way the electoral system was designed the UFC won far fewer seats.<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2007-12/2007-12-04-voa53.cfm?CFID=267586544&CFTOKEN=71565589 ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Africa]]\n*[[History of West Africa]]\n*[[List of heads of government of Togo]]\n*[[List of heads of state of Togo]]\n*[[Politics of Togo]]\n* Lom\u00e9 [[Lom\u00e9#History|history]] and [[Timeline of Lom\u00e9|timeline]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5430.htm Most of the information here is derived from the U.S. Department of State website on Togo.]\n\n==Further reading==\n*Chafer, Tony.
