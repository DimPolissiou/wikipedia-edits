However, after the Episcopal Church allowed the ordination of women in 1976, she was ordained a deacon in 1978 and a priest in 1980.

Though Plath destroyed most of their letters, fourteen from Plath to Barnhouse remain (not including the two from Barnhouse to Plath in the Sylvia Plath papers at [[Smith College]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/smitharchives/manosca142.html|title=Finding aid to the Sylvia Plath Papers CA.MS.00142|last=Plath|first=Sylvia|website=asteria.fivecolleges.edu|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nBarnhouse was born to American parents in [[Grenoble]], France in 1923. The family moved to [[Philadelphia]] when she was two. Her father, Donald Grey Barnhouse, took up a teaching position at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://lithub.com/the-psychiatrist-who-tried-to-save-sylvia-plath/|title=The Psychiatrist Who Tried To Save Sylvia Plath|last=Alexander|first=Paul|date=2018-10-23|website=Literary Hub|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> and was pastor of the Tenth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia from 1927 to 1960 (see Wikipedia article). She was homeschooled by her grandmother Tiffany, a distant cousin of the founder of Tiffany & Co.<ref name=\":0\" /> With a high IQ, she was accepted to [[Vassar College]] at fourteen but was not allowed to enroll until she turned sixteen. In the meantime, she met her first husband, Francis Edmonds, at a religious retreat. Francis graduated from Princeton in 1940. They eloped in 1941 after her father forbade them from marrying.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2004/11/29/plath_therapist/|title=Sylvia and Ruth|last=Maroda|first=Karen|date=2004-11-29|website=Salon|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> Shortly thereafter she regretted her marriage but was hesitant to leave because she was pregnant.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1943 she gave birth to a second child. In 1944, at twenty-one, she enrolled at [[Barnard College]], where she completed her bachelor's degree, and continued on to [[Columbia University Medical School]], where she earned a medical degree.<ref name=\":1\" /> She left Francis towards the end of her first year at Barnard. He assumed full responsibility for the children. His parents looked after them until the divorce went through and he, then a doctor of medicine, remarried in 1947. <ref name=\":2\" /> Divorce and child custody were topics Barnhouse would later discuss in her letters to Plath.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nFollowing her divorce in 1947, she met William Beuscher, her peer at Columbia who, like Barnhouse, would go on to complete a residency in psychiatry at McLean. They married and had five children, but she divorced him later, citing emotional abuse and alcoholism.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhile still a full-time psychiatrist and mother, Barnhouse became involved in the Episcopal church in her town. She enrolled part-time at the [[Weston College of Theology]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and became a full-time resident in 1973 on track to obtain a master's degree in theology. However, after the Episcopal Church allowed the ordination of women in 1976, she was ordained a deacon in 1978 and a priest in 1980. She then taught at [[Southern Methodist University]]'s [[Perkins School of Theology]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss603.html|title=Ruth Tiffany Barnhouse Papers, Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College Special Collections, Northampton, Massachusetts.}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/1983/june/the-lady-isa-priest/|title=THE LADY ISA PRIEST|last=Taitte|first=W.
