The film was directed by [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]], and stars the regular television cast of [[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[Harry Shearer]], [[Tress MacNeille]], [[Pamela Hayden]], [[Russi Taylor]], and [[Albert Brooks]]. The film follows [[Homer Simpson]], who irresponsibly pollutes the lake in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] after the town has cleaned it up, causing the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] to imprison the town under a giant dome. After he and [[Simpson family|his family]] narrowly manage to escape, they ultimately abandon Homer for his selfishness, and he works to redeem his folly by stopping Russ Cargill, the head of the EPA, from destroying Springfield.\n\nAlthough previous attempts to create a ''Simpsons'' film had been made, they all failed due to the lack of a script of appropriate length and production crew members. Eventually in 2001, producers [[James L. Brooks]], [[Matt Groening]], [[Al Jean]], [[Richard Sakai]] and [[Mike Scully]] began development of the film and a writing team consisting of Brooks, Groening, Jean, Scully, [[Ian Maxtone-Graham]], [[George Meyer]], [[David Mirkin]], [[Mike Reiss]], [[Matt Selman]], [[John Swartzwelder]] and [[Jon Vitti]] was assembled. They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one developed into a film. The script was rewritten over a hundred times, with rewrites continuing after work on the animation began in 2006. Consequently, hours of finished material was cut from the final release, including [[cameo appearance|cameo roles]] from [[Erin Brockovich]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Isla Fisher]], [[Kelsey Grammer]] and [[Edward Norton]]. [[Tom Hanks]] and the members of [[Green Day]] voice their own animated counterparts in the final cut of the film, while Albert Brooks, a frequent guest performer on the series, provides the voice of the villain Cargill.\n\n[[Tie-in]] promotions were made with several companies to promote the film's release, including [[Burger King]] and [[7-Eleven]], the latter of which [[Kwik-E-Mart#7-Eleven promotion|transformed selected stores]] into [[Kwik-E-Mart]]s. The film premiered in [[Springfield, Vermont]] on July 21, 2007 and was released theatrically six days later by [[20th Century Fox]] across the United States. ''The Simpsons Movie'' was both a critical and commercial success, grossing over $527 million worldwide and becoming the [[2007 in film#Highest-grossing films|eighth highest-grossing film of 2007]], [[List of highest-grossing animated films#Traditional animation|the second highest-grossing traditionally animated film]] (behind the original version of ''[[The Lion King]]'') and the highest-ever grossing film based on an animated television series. In August 2018, it was reported that a [[sequel]] was in development.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/the-simpsons-movie-2-development-fox/|title=The Simpsons Movie 2 Reportedly in Development at Fox|first=Kevin |last=Burwick|work=movieweb.com|date=August 10, 2018|accessdate=August 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAs rock band [[Green Day]] perform on Lake Springfield, the band members fail to engage the audience in a discussion about the environment. They are killed when the pollution in the lake erodes their barge, causing it to sink. At their memorial, [[Grampa Simpson]] prophesies the destruction of the town but only [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] takes it seriously. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and her new friend Colin, whom she has fallen in love with, hold a seminar where they convince the town to clean up the lake. Meanwhile, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] adopts a pig from [[Krusty Burger]], which causes his now neglected son [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] to look to their neighbor, [[Ned Flanders]], as a parental figure. \n\nHomer stores the pig's feces in an overflowing silo, which horrifies Marge. Homer attempts to dispose of it safely at Marge's request, but gets distracted and instead dumps the silo in the lake, critically polluting it. Moments later, a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated. Flanders and Bart discover the squirrel during a hike, and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] captures it. The EPA informs President [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] on Springfield's pollution crisis and presents five countering options. The President randomly picks the action of enclosing [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] in a giant glass dome. When Homer's silo is discovered, an angry mob of townspeople approach [[The Simpsons house|the Simpsons' home]]. The family escapes through a sinkhole in [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]'s sandbox and flee to Alaska. Homer wins a motorcycle contest and is awarded a truck, which the family use to restart themselves. \n\nAfter three months of failed escape attempts, cracks start to appear in the dome and [[Russ Cargill]], head of the EPA, not wanting news of what he has done to become widespread, plots to destroy Springfield. In Alaska, the Simpsons see an advertisement featuring [[Tom Hanks]] for a new [[Grand Canyon]] on the site of Springfield. Realizing that their hometown is in danger, Marge and the kids elect to save it, but Homer objects to help the people who tried to kill them. The family abandon Homer but are captured by the EPA and placed back in the dome. After a visit from a mysterious [[Inuit shaman]], Homer has an epiphany that he must save the town in order to save himself.\n\nHomer learns his family are in Springfield and a helicopter lowers a time bomb suspended by rope through a hole in the dome. Homer climbs to the peak of the dome using superglue and descends the rope, knocking the escaping townspeople and the bomb off. After reuniting with Bart, they use a motorcycle to travel up the side of the dome and Bart throws the bomb through the hole, seconds before detonation. The bomb explodes, shattering the dome. Cargill attempts to kill Homer and Bart for ruining his plan, but Maggie knocks him out with a boulder. The townspeople praise Homer, who rides off with Marge on the motorcycle into the sunset as Springfield begins restoration.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main article|List of The Simpsons characters}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:110px;\"| Voice actor\n! scope=\"col\" | Credited roles\n! scope=\"col\" class=unsortable | Uncredited roles (in order of appearance)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Dan|Castellaneta}}\n| [[Homer Simpson]], [[Abe Simpson]], [[Krusty the Clown]], [[Groundskeeper Willie]], [[Mayor Quimby]], [[Sideshow Mel]], [[Mr. Teeny]],  [[EPA]] Official, [[Itchy and Scratchy|Itchy]], [[Barney Gumble]]\n| Stage Manager, [[Blue Haired Lawyer]], Multi-Eyed Squirrel, [[Hans Moleman]], Panicky Man, Kissing Cop, Bear, Boy on Phone, [[NSA]] Worker, Officer, [[Rich Texan]], [[Santa's Little Helper]], [[Squeaky-Voiced Teen]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Julie|Kavner}}\n| [[Marge Simpson]], [[Patty and Selma|Selma Bouvier, Patty Bouvier]]\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Nancy|Cartwright}}\n| [[Bart Simpson]], [[Ralph Wiggum]], [[Todd Flanders]], [[Nelson Muntz]]\n| [[Maggie Simpson]], TV Daughter, Woman on Phone\n|-nik Simpson\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Yeardley|Smith}}\n| [[Lisa Simpson]]\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Hank|Azaria}}\n| [[Moe Szyslak]], [[Chief Wiggum]], [[Cletus Spuckler]], [[Professor Frink]], [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]], [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Lou|Lou]], [[Comic Book Guy]], [[Captain McCallister]], [[Bumblebee Man]], [[List of The Simpsons characters#Dr. Nick Rivera|Dr. Nick]]\n| [[Lenny and Carl|Carl]], Male EPA Worker, Dome Depot Announcer, Kissing Cop, Carnival Barker, Gas Station Clerk, [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Drederick Tatum|Drederick Tatum]], EPA Passenger, Robot, [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Wiseguy|Wiseguy]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Harry|Shearer}}\n| [[Mr. Burns]], [[Waylon Smithers|Smithers]], [[Ned Flanders]], [[Reverend Lovejoy]], [[Lenny and Carl|Lenny]], President [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Principal Skinner|Seymour Skinner]], [[Kent Brockman]], [[Dr. Hibbert]], [[Otto Mann]]\n| [[Itchy and Scratchy|Scratchy]], Skull, Toll Booth Operator, Guard\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Pamela|Hayden}}\n| [[Milhouse Van Houten]], [[Rod Flanders]], [[Jimbo Jones]]\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Tress|MacNeille}}\n| Medicine Woman, [[Agnes Skinner]], [[Crazy Cat Lady]], Colin, [[Cookie Kwan]]\n| Sweet Old Lady, [[Mrs. Muntz]], [[Plopper]], Female EPA Worker, [[List of The Simpsons characters#Lindsey Neagle|Lindsey Neagle]], [[GPS]] Voice, TV Son, Girl on Phone\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Albert|Brooks}} (as \"A.

The film was directed by [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]], and stars the regular television cast of [[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[Harry Shearer]], [[Tress MacNeille]], [[Pamela Hayden]], [[Russi Taylor]], and [[Albert Brooks]]. The film follows [[Homer Simpson]], who irresponsibly pollutes the lake in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] after the town has cleaned it up, causing the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] to imprison the town under a giant dome. After he and [[Simpson family|his family]] narrowly manage to escape, they ultimately abandon Homer for his selfishness, and he works to redeem his folly by stopping Russ Cargill, the head of the EPA, from destroying Springfield.\n\nAlthough previous attempts to create a ''Simpsons'' film had been made, they all failed due to the lack of a script of appropriate length and production crew members. Eventually in 2001, producers [[James L. Brooks]], [[Matt Groening]], [[Al Jean]], [[Richard Sakai]] and [[Mike Scully]] began development of the film and a writing team consisting of Brooks, Groening, Jean, Scully, [[Ian Maxtone-Graham]], [[George Meyer]], [[David Mirkin]], [[Mike Reiss]], [[Matt Selman]], [[John Swartzwelder]] and [[Jon Vitti]] was assembled. They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one developed into a film. The script was rewritten over a hundred times, with rewrites continuing after work on the animation began in 2006. Consequently, hours of finished material was cut from the final release, including [[cameo appearance|cameo roles]] from [[Erin Brockovich]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Isla Fisher]], [[Kelsey Grammer]] and [[Edward Norton]]. [[Tom Hanks]] and the members of [[Green Day]] voice their own animated counterparts in the final cut of the film, while Albert Brooks, a frequent guest performer on the series, provides the voice of the villain Cargill.\n\n[[Tie-in]] promotions were made with several companies to promote the film's release, including [[Burger King]] and [[7-Eleven]], the latter of which [[Kwik-E-Mart#7-Eleven promotion|transformed selected stores]] into [[Kwik-E-Mart]]s. The film premiered in [[Springfield, Vermont]] on July 21, 2007 and was released theatrically six days later by [[20th Century Fox]] across the United States. ''The Simpsons Movie'' was both a critical and commercial success, grossing over $527 million worldwide and becoming the [[2007 in film#Highest-grossing films|eighth highest-grossing film of 2007]], [[List of highest-grossing animated films#Traditional animation|the second highest-grossing traditionally animated film]] (behind the original version of ''[[The Lion King]]'') and the highest-ever grossing film based on an animated television series. In August 2018, it was reported that a [[sequel]] was in development.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/the-simpsons-movie-2-development-fox/|title=The Simpsons Movie 2 Reportedly in Development at Fox|first=Kevin |last=Burwick|work=movieweb.com|date=August 10, 2018|accessdate=August 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAs rock band [[Green Day]] perform on Lake Springfield, the band members fail to engage the audience in a discussion about the environment. They are killed when the pollution in the lake erodes their barge, causing it to sink. At their memorial, [[Grampa Simpson]] prophesies the destruction of the town but only [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] takes it seriously. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and her new friend Colin, whom she has fallen in love with, hold a seminar where they convince the town to clean up the lake. Meanwhile, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] adopts a pig from [[Krusty Burger]], which causes his now neglected son [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] to look to their neighbor, [[Ned Flanders]], as a parental figure. \n\nHomer stores the pig's feces in an overflowing silo, which horrifies Marge. Homer attempts to dispose of it safely at Marge's request, but gets distracted and instead dumps the silo in the lake, critically polluting it. Moments later, a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated. Flanders and Bart discover the squirrel during a hike, and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] captures it. [[Russ Cargill]], head of the EPA, informs President [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] on Springfield's pollution crisis and presents five countering options. The President randomly picks the action of enclosing [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] in a giant glass dome. When Homer's silo is discovered, an angry mob of townspeople approach [[The Simpsons house|the Simpsons' home]]. The family escapes through a sinkhole in [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]'s sandbox and flee to Alaska. Homer wins a motorcycle contest and is awarded a truck, which the family use to restart themselves. \n\nAfter three months of failed escape attempts, cracks start to appear in the dome and Cargill, not wanting news of what he has done to become widespread, plots to destroy Springfield. In Alaska, the Simpsons see an advertisement featuring [[Tom Hanks]] for a new [[Grand Canyon]] on the site of Springfield. Realizing that their hometown is in danger, Marge and the kids elect to save it, but Homer objects to help the people who tried to kill them. The family abandon Homer but are captured by the EPA and placed back in the dome. After a visit from a mysterious [[Inuit shaman]], Homer has an epiphany that he must save the town in order to save himself.\n\nHomer learns his family are in Springfield and a helicopter lowers a time bomb suspended by rope through a hole in the dome. Homer climbs to the peak of the dome using superglue and descends the rope, knocking the escaping townspeople and the bomb off. After reuniting with Bart, they use a motorcycle to travel up the side of the dome and Bart throws the bomb through the hole, seconds before detonation. The bomb explodes, shattering the dome. Cargill attempts to kill Homer and Bart for ruining his plan, but Maggie knocks him out with a boulder. The townspeople praise Homer, who rides off with Marge on the motorcycle into the sunset as Springfield begins restoration.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main article|List of The Simpsons characters}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:110px;\"| Voice actor\n! scope=\"col\" | Credited roles\n! scope=\"col\" class=unsortable | Uncredited roles (in order of appearance)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Dan|Castellaneta}}\n| [[Homer Simpson]], [[Abe Simpson]], [[Krusty the Clown]], [[Groundskeeper Willie]], [[Mayor Quimby]], [[Sideshow Mel]], [[Mr. Teeny]],  [[EPA]] Official, [[Itchy and Scratchy|Itchy]], [[Barney Gumble]]\n| Stage Manager, [[Blue Haired Lawyer]], Multi-Eyed Squirrel, [[Hans Moleman]], Panicky Man, Kissing Cop, Bear, Boy on Phone, [[NSA]] Worker, Officer, [[Rich Texan]], [[Santa's Little Helper]], [[Squeaky-Voiced Teen]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Julie|Kavner}}\n| [[Marge Simpson]], [[Patty and Selma|Selma Bouvier, Patty Bouvier]]\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Nancy|Cartwright}}\n| [[Bart Simpson]], [[Ralph Wiggum]], [[Todd Flanders]], [[Nelson Muntz]]\n| [[Maggie Simpson]], TV Daughter, Woman on Phone\n|-nik Simpson\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Yeardley|Smith}}\n| [[Lisa Simpson]]\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Hank|Azaria}}\n| [[Moe Szyslak]], [[Chief Wiggum]], [[Cletus Spuckler]], [[Professor Frink]], [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]], [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Lou|Lou]], [[Comic Book Guy]], [[Captain McCallister]], [[Bumblebee Man]], [[List of The Simpsons characters#Dr. Nick Rivera|Dr. Nick]]\n| [[Lenny and Carl|Carl]], Male EPA Worker, Dome Depot Announcer, Kissing Cop, Carnival Barker, Gas Station Clerk, [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Drederick Tatum|Drederick Tatum]], EPA Passenger, Robot, [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Wiseguy|Wiseguy]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Harry|Shearer}}\n| [[Mr. Burns]], [[Waylon Smithers|Smithers]], [[Ned Flanders]], [[Reverend Lovejoy]], [[Lenny and Carl|Lenny]], President [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Principal Skinner|Seymour Skinner]], [[Kent Brockman]], [[Dr. Hibbert]], [[Otto Mann]]\n| [[Itchy and Scratchy|Scratchy]], Skull, Toll Booth Operator, Guard\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Pamela|Hayden}}\n| [[Milhouse Van Houten]], [[Rod Flanders]], [[Jimbo Jones]]\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Tress|MacNeille}}\n| Medicine Woman, [[Agnes Skinner]], [[Crazy Cat Lady]], Colin, [[Cookie Kwan]]\n| Sweet Old Lady, [[Mrs. Muntz]], [[Plopper]], Female EPA Worker, [[List of The Simpsons characters#Lindsey Neagle|Lindsey Neagle]], [[GPS]] Voice, TV Son, Girl on Phone\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Albert|Brooks}} (as \"A.

It is an older [[suburb]]an [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]], comprising a mixture of low-density, single detached dwellings, detached duplexes and apartment-style units. As of 2007, the area is home to 3,611 residents. The neighbourhood is considered a middle-income area, with an average family income of $50,587, an average dwelling value of $284,710 and a home ownership rate of 38.7%.

In 1924 the Army War College surveyed commissioned officers about whether and how to integrate Army units. At the time, African Americans served in segregated units, usually under white officers. Based on his experience in the Spanish\u2013American War and his observations of African American soldiers during World War I, Parsons argued for desegregating army units and having each one incorporate a set percentage of black soldiers. In his view, black soldiers could be expected to perform capably if given the same training as whites, and incorporating them into units with whites would prevent them from being singled out for inferior duties like kitchen patrol and the loading and unloading of cargo. Parsons was convinced that African Americans could also serve as officers, although his point of view was that they would not be able to lead white soldiers effectively due to the prejudice of the times, but could instead aspire to command positions in the transportation and supply units that often contained large numbers of black soldiers in wartime. The army did not agree with Parsons' recommendations, and continued to allow African Americans to serve only in segregated units, and with few opportunities for assignment to leadership positions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nalty |first=Bernard C. |date=1986 |title=Strength for the Fight: A History of Black Americans in the Military |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B13CGJMiyOIC&pg=PA122&dq=%22james+k+parsons%22+%22black%22+%22survey%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjBraO_ybHJAhXBOz4KHfQvBoUQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22james%20k%20parsons%22%20%22black%22%20%22survey%22&f=false |location=New York, NY |publisher=The Free Press |pages=122\u2013123 |isbn=978-0-02-922411-3}}</ref>\n\n===Advocate of mechanization===\nParsons commanded the [[United States Army Armor School|Army's tank school]] at Fort Meade, Maryland in 1925, and then again from 1929 to 1930.

In 1924 the Army War College surveyed commissioned officers about whether and how to integrate Army units. At the time, African Americans served in segregated units, usually under white officers. Based on his experience in the Spanish\u2013American War and his observations of African American soldiers during World War I, Parsons argued for desegregating army units and having each one incorporate a set percentage of black soldiers. In his view, black soldiers could be expected to perform capably if given the same training as whites, and incorporating them into units with whites would prevent them from being singled out for inferior duties like kitchen patrol and the loading and unloading of cargo. Parsons was convinced that African Americans could also serve as officers, although his point of view was that they would not be able to lead white soldiers effectively due to the prejudice of the times, but could instead aspire to command positions in the transportation and supply units that often contained large numbers of black soldiers in wartime. The army did not agree with Parsons' recommendations, and continued to allow African Americans to serve only in segregated units, and with few opportunities for assignment to leadership positions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nalty |first=Bernard C. |date=1986 |title=Strength for the Fight: A History of Black Americans in the Military |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B13CGJMiyOIC&pg=PA122&dq=%22james+k+parsons%22+%22black%22+%22survey%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjBraO_ybHJAhXBOz4KHfQvBoUQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22james%20k%20parsons%22%20%22black%22%20%22survey%22&f=false |location=New York, NY |publisher=The Free Press |pages=122\u2013123 |isbn=978-0-02-922411-3}}</ref>\n\n===Advocate of mechanization===\nParsons commanded the [[United States Army Armor School|Army's tank school]] at Fort Meade, Maryland in 1925, and then again from 1929 to 1930.
