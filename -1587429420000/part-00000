He was the seventh [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House speaker]] and the ninth [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]]. He received [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] for president in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]], [[1832 United States presidential election|1832]], and [[1844 United States presidential election|1844]] presidential elections. He also helped found both the [[National Republican Party]] and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. For his role in defusing sectional crises, he earned the appellation of the \"Great Compromiser.\"\n\nClay was born in [[Hanover County, Virginia]] in 1777 and launched a legal career in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], in 1797. As a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], Clay won election to the Kentucky state legislature in 1803 and to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1810. He was chosen as speaker of the House in early 1811 and, along with President [[James Madison]], led the United States into the [[War of 1812]] against [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In 1814, he helped negotiate the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which brought an end to the War of 1812. After the war, Clay returned to his position as speaker of the House and developed the [[American System (economic plan)|American System]], which called for federal [[internal improvements|infrastructure investments]], support for the [[history of central banking in the United States|national bank]], and [[protective tariff|protective]] [[tariffs in United States history|tariff rates]]. In 1820, he helped bring an end to a sectional crisis over [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] by leading the passage of the [[Missouri Compromise]].\n\nClay finished with the fourth-most electoral votes in the multi-candidate [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]], and he helped [[John Quincy Adams]] win the [[contingent election]] held to select the president. President Adams appointed Clay to the prestigious position of secretary of state; critics alleged that the two had agreed to a \"[[First Corrupt Bargain|corrupt bargain]].\" Despite receiving support from Clay and other National Republicans, Adams was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Andrew Jackson]] in the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]]. Clay won election to the Senate in 1831 and ran as the National Republican nominee in the 1832 presidential election, but he was defeated by President Jackson. After the 1832 election, Clay helped bring an end to the [[Nullification Crisis]] by leading passage of the [[Tariff of 1833]]. During Jackson's second term, opponents of the president coalesced into the Whig Party, and Clay became a leading congressional Whig. \n\nClay sought the presidency in the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 election]] but was defeated at the [[1839 Whig National Convention|Whig National Convention]] by [[William Henry Harrison]]. He clashed with Harrison's running mate and successor, [[John Tyler]], who broke with Clay and other congressional Whigs after taking office in 1841. Clay resigned from the Senate in 1842 and won the 1844 Whig presidential nomination, but he was defeated in the [[1844 United States presidential election|general election]] by Democrat [[James K. Polk]], who made the annexation of the [[Republic of Texas]] his key issue. Clay strongly criticized the subsequent [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and sought the Whig presidential nomination in [[1848 United States presidential election|1848]], but was defeated by General [[Zachary Taylor]]. After returning to the Senate in 1849, Clay played a key role in passing the [[Compromise of 1850]], which resolved a crisis over the status of slavery in the [[Territories of the United States|territories]]. Clay is generally regarded as one of the most important and influential political figures of his era.<ref>Smith, D.

Henry Jr. was killed while commanding a regiment at the [[Battle of Buena Vista]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Clay's oldest son, Theodore Wythe Clay, spent the second half of his life confined to a [[psychiatric hospital]].

The Ashland estate eventually encompassed over 500 acres, with numerous outbuildings such as a smokehouse, a greenhouse, and several barns. Clay owned a maximum of about 50 slaves, and he planted crops like corn, wheat, and rye, as well as [[hemp]], the chief crop of the [[Bluegrass region]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=275\u2013277}} Clay also took a strong interest in [[thoroughbred racing]] and imported livestock such as [[Arabian horse]]s, [[Maltese donkey]]s, and [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] cattle.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=277\u2013278}} Though Clay suffered some financial issues during economic downturns, he never fell deeply into debt and ultimately left his children a large inheritance.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=279\u2013280}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Early law and political career==\n===Legal career===\n[[File:Henry Clay's law office.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|View of Henry Clay's law office (1803\u20131810), Lexington, Kentucky]]\n\nIn November 1797, Clay relocated to Lexington, Kentucky, near where his parents and siblings resided. The Bluegrass Region, with Lexington at its center, had quickly grown in the preceding decades, but had only recently stopped being under the threat of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] raids. Lexington was an established town that hosted [[Transylvania University]], the first university west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=27-29}} Having already passed the Virginia Bar, Clay quickly received a Kentucky license to practice law. After apprenticing himself to Kentucky attorneys such as [[George Nicholas]], [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckinridge]], and James Brown, Clay established his own law practice, frequently working on debt collections and land disputes.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=30-31}} Clay soon established a reputation for strong legal ability and courtroom oratory. In 1805, he was appointed to the faculty of [[Transylvania University]], where he taught, among others, future Kentucky Governor [[Robert P. Letcher]] and Robert Todd, the future father-in-law of [[Abraham Lincoln]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=43}}\n\nClay's most notable client was [[Aaron Burr]], who was indicted for allegedly planning an [[Burr conspiracy|expedition]] into [[New Spain|Spanish territory]] west of the [[Mississippi River]].

In the first political speech of his career, Clay attacked the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], federal laws designed to suppress dissent during the [[Quasi-War]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=20\u201321}} Like most Kentuckians, Clay was a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], but he clashed with state party leaders over a state constitutional convention. Using the pseudonym \"Scaevola\" (in reference to [[Gaius Mucius Scaevola]]), Clay advocated for direct elections for Kentucky elected officials and the gradual emancipation of [[History of slavery in Kentucky|slavery in Kentucky]]. The 1799 [[Kentucky Constitution]] included the direct election of public officials, but the state did not adopt Clay's plan for gradual emancipation.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=33-36}} \n\nIn 1803, Clay won election to the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=21\u201323}} His first legislative initiative was the partisan [[gerrymandering in the United States|gerrymander]] of Kentucky's [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] districts, which ensured that all of Kentucky's presidential electors voted for President Thomas Jefferson in the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 presidential election]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=48-51}} Clay clashed with legislators who sought to reduce the power of Clay's Bluegrass Region, and he unsuccessfully advocated moving the state capitol from [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] to Lexington.

Clay's compromise tariff won the backing of both manufacturers, who believed they would not receive a better deal, and Calhoun, who sought a way out of the crisis but refused to work with President Jackson's supporters on an alternative tariff bill.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=217\u2013218}} Though most members of Clay's own National Republican Party opposed it, the [[Tariff of 1833]] passed both houses of Congress. Jackson simultaneously signed the tariff bill and the Force bill, and South Carolina leaders accepted the new tariff, effectively bringing the crisis to an end. Clay's role in resolving the crisis brought him renewed national stature in the wake of a crushing presidential election defeat, and some began referring to him as the \"Great Compromiser.\"{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=219\u2013221}}\n\n====Formation of the Whig Party====\n\nFollowing the end of the Nullification Crisis in March 1833, Jackson renewed his offensive against the national bank, despite some opposition from within his own Cabinet.{{sfn|Cole|1993|pp=187\u2013188}} Jackson and Secretary of the Treasury [[Roger Taney]] pursued a policy of removing all federal deposits from the national bank and placing them in state-chartered banks known as \"[[pet banks]].\"{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=387\u2013388}} Because federal law required the president to deposit federal revenue in the national bank so long as it was financially stable, many regarded Jackson's actions as illegal, and Clay led the passage of a Senate motion [[Censure in the United States|censuring]] Jackson.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=225\u2013227}} Nonetheless, the national bank's federal charter expired in 1836, and though the institution continued to function under a Pennsylvania charter, it never regained the influence it had had at the beginning of Jackson's administration.{{sfn|Cole|1993|pp=209\u2013211}}\n\nThe removal of deposits helped unite Jackson's opponents into one party for the first time, as National Republicans, Calhounites, former Democrats, and members of the Anti-Masonic Party coalesced into the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=227\u2013228}} The term \"Whig\" originated from a speech Clay delivered in 1834, in which he compared opponents of Jackson to the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], a British political party opposed to [[absolute monarchy]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=266}} Neither the Whigs nor the Democrats were unified geographically or ideologically. However, Whigs tended to favor a stronger legislature, a stronger federal government, a higher tariff, greater spending on infrastructure, re-authorization of the Second Bank of the United States, and publicly funded education. Conversely, Democrats tended to favor a stronger president, stronger state governments, lower tariffs, [[Hard money (policy)|hard money]], and expansionism. Neither party took a strong national stand on slavery.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=313-315}} The Whig base of support lay in wealthy businessmen, professionals, the professional class, and large planters, while the Democratic base of support lay in immigrant [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]] and yeomen farmers, but each party appealed across class lines.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=229\u2013231}}\n\nPartly due to grief over the death of his daughter, Anne, Clay chose not to run in the [[1836 United States presidential election|1836 presidential election]], and the Whigs were too disorganized to nominate a single candidate.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=272-273}} Three Whig candidates ran against Van Buren: General [[William Henry Harrison]], Senator [[Hugh Lawson White]], and Senator Daniel Webster. By running multiple candidates, the Whigs hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives. Clay personally preferred Webster, but he threw his backing behind Harrison who had the broadest appeal among voters. Clay's decision not to endorse Webster opened a rift between the two Whig party leaders, and Webster would work against Clay in future presidential elections.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=239\u2013241}} Despite the presence of multiple Whig candidates, Van Buren won the 1836 election with 50.8 percent of the popular vote and 170 of the 294 electoral votes.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=274}}\n\n===Van Buren administration, 1837\u20131841===\n{{See also|Presidency of Martin Van Buren}}\n[[File:1839WhigPresidentialNomination1stBallot.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Clay (brown) won the backing of several state delegations on the first ballot of the [[1839 Whig National Convention]], but [[William Henry Harrison]] ultimately won the party's presidential nomination.]]\n\nVan Buren's presidency was quickly hit by the [[Panic of 1837]], a major recession that badly damaged the Democratic Party.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=279-280}} Clay and other Whigs argued that Jackson's policies, including the use of pet banks, had encouraged speculation and caused the panic.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=242\u2013243}} He promoted the American System as a means for economic recovery, but President Van Buren's response focused on the practice of \"strict economy and frugality.\"{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=505\u2013506}} As the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 presidential election]] approached, many expected that the Whigs would win control of the presidency due to the ongoing economic crisis.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=84}} Clay initially viewed Webster as his strongest rival,{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=284-287}} but Clay, Harrison, and General [[Winfield Scott]] emerged as the principal candidates at the [[1839 Whig National Convention]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=296-297, 300}} \n\nThough he was widely regarded as the most qualified Whig leader to serve as president, many Whigs questioned Clay's electability after two presidential election defeats. He also faced opposition in the North due to his ownership of slaves and lingering association with the Freemasons, and in the South from Whigs who distrusted his moderate stance on slavery.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=249\u2013254}} Clay won a plurality on the first ballot of the Whig National Convention, but, with the help of [[Thurlow Weed]] and other backers, Harrison consolidated support on subsequent ballots and won the Whig presidential nomination on the fifth ballot of the convention.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=257\u2013258}} Seeking to placate Clay's supporters and to balance the ticket geographically, the convention chose former Virginia Governor and Senator [[John Tyler]], a personal friend of Clay, whose previous career in the Democratic Party had practically come to an end, as the vice presidential nominee.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=309-310}} Clay was disappointed by the outcome, but helped Harrison's ultimately successful campaign by delivering numerous speeches.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=311-312}} With Whigs also winning control of Congress in the [[1840 United States elections|1840 elections]], Clay saw the upcoming [[27th United States Congress|27th Congress]] as an opportunity for the Whig Party to establish itself as the dominant political party by leading the country out of recession.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=261\u2013263}}\n\n===Harrison and Tyler administrations, 1841\u20131845===\n{{See also|Presidency of William Henry Harrison|Presidency of John Tyler}}\n\nPresident-elect Harrison asked Clay to serve another term as Secretary of State, but Clay chose to remain in Congress.

Clay and his congressional allies attempted to craft a national bank bill acceptable to Tyler, but Tyler vetoed two separate bills to re-establish the national bank, showing that he in fact had no will to reach a solution for the party's issues. Clay and other Whig leaders were now outraged not only by Tyler's rejection of the Whig party platform, but also because they felt that Tyler had purposely misled them into thinking that he would sign the bills.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=265\u2013269}} \n\nAfter the second veto, congressional Whigs voted to expel Tyler from the party, and on Clay's request every Cabinet member except for Webster, who wanted to continue negotiating the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] with Great Britain about the border to Canada, resigned from office.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=351-353}} This made Tyler increasingly move closer to his former Democratic Party and, with Webster still serving in the Tyler administration, Clay emerged as the clear leader of the Whig Party.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=270\u2013271}} In early 1842, Clay resigned from the Senate after arranging for Crittenden to succeed him.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=362-363}} Though he vetoed other Whig bills, Tyler did sign some Whig priorities into law, including the [[Preemption Act of 1841]], which distributed the proceeds of land sales to the states, and the Bankruptcy Act of 1841, which was the first law in U.S. history that allowed for voluntary bankruptcy.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=592\u2013593}} Facing a large budget deficit, Tyler also signed the [[Tariff of 1842]], which restored the protective rates of the Tariff of 1832 but ended the distribution policy that had been established with the Preemption Act of 1841.{{sfn|Peterson|1989|pp=103\u2013108}}\n\n====1844 presidential election====\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1844.svg|thumb|upright=1|James K.

Nonetheless, Taylor won the election, taking 47.3 percent of the popular vote and 163 of 290 electoral votes.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=443-444}}\n\n===Taylor and Fillmore administrations, 1849\u20131852===\n{{see also|Presidency of Zachary Taylor|Presidency of Millard Fillmore}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 352\n| image1 = United States 1849-1850.png\n| caption1 = {{center|The United States after the ratification of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], with the [[Mexican Cession]] still unorganized}}\n| image2 = United States 1850-1853-03.png\n| caption2 = {{center|The United States after the Compromise of 1850}}\n}}\n\nIncreasingly worried about the sectional tensions arising over the issue of slavery in newly acquired territories, Clay accepted election to the Senate in 1849.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=444, 454}} Having refused to campaign for Taylor, Clay played little role in the formation of Taylor's Cabinet or in determining the new administration's policies.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=460}} In January 1850, with Congress still deadlocked regarding the status of the Mexican Cession, Clay proposed a compromise designed to organize territory acquired in the Mexican\u2013American War and address other issues contributing to sectional tensions.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=461\u2013462}} His legislative package included the admission of [[California]] as a free state, the [[State cessions|cession]] by Texas of some of its northern and western territorial claims in return for debt relief, the establishment of [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]] and [[Utah Territory|Utah]] territories, a ban on the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale, and a more stringent [[Fugitive slave laws|fugitive slave law]].{{sfn|Smith|1988|pp=111\u2013112}} Though it faced opposition from Southern extremists like Calhoun and Northern abolitionists like [[William Seward]], Clay's proposal won the backing of many Southern and Northern leaders.{{sfn|Smith|1988|pp=112\u2013119}} \n\nPresident Taylor, who favored the immediate admission of California and New Mexico as free states without any attached conditions, opposed the plan, and Clay openly broke with the president in May 1850.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=359, 364\u2013365}} Debate over Clay's proposal continued into July, when Taylor unexpectedly died of an illness.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=365\u2013366}} After Taylor's death, President Fillmore, who supported Clay's compromise bill, consulted with Clay in appointing a new Cabinet.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=465}} Exhausted by the debate in the Senate, Clay took a leave of absence shortly after Taylor's death, but Fillmore, Webster, and Democratic Senator [[Stephen A.

Though contemporaries credited Fillmore, Douglas, and Webster for their role in passing the Compromise of 1850, Clay was widely regarded as the key figure in ending a major sectional crisis.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=365\u2013367}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Henry Clay monument.jpg|thumb|Henry Clay monument and mausoleum, Lexington Cemetery]]\n\nIn December 1851, with his health declining, Clay announced that he would resign from the Senate the following September.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=484}} On June 29, 1852, Clay died of [[tuberculosis]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], at the age of 75 in his room at the [[National Hotel (Washington, D.C.)|National Hotel]].<ref>John DeFerrari.

Crosby: An Autobiography'' ([[Peabody, Massachusetts]]: Hendrickson Publishers Marketing, 2013 printing), p. 87, {{ISBN|978-1-59856-281-1}}.</ref>}}\n\n==Ideology and slavery==\n===American System===\n{{main|American System (economic plan)}}\n\nThroughout most of his political life, Clay promoted his American System as both an economic program and a means for unifying the country. Clay's American System rejected [[strict constructionism]] in favor of an activist government that would help ensure a fairer and more efficient distribution of economic gains. The American System had four key tenets: high tariffs, a stable financial system, federal investment in internal improvements, and a public land sale policy designed to raise revenue and provide for carefully-managed expansion into the [[American frontier]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=80\u201382}} Through high tariffs, Clay hoped to free the United States from dependence on foreign imports, especially from Britain.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=85\u201387}} Clay sought to ensure a stable financial system through support for the national bank, which regulated the country's banking system and helped ensure a consistent supply of credit.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=87\u201389}} Clay's support for federally-financed internal improvements stemmed from his belief that only the federal government could construct the transportation system necessary for uniting the country commercially and culturally.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=89\u201391}} His land policy was centered on the using revenue from land sales to fund money to the states, which could then invest that money in education, infrastructure projects, and other priorities.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=220\u2013221}}\n\n===Slavery and the Dupuy case===\n\nClay inherited slaves as a young child,{{sfn|Eaton|1957|pp=6\u20137}} and he continued to own slaves throughout his life. However, in the 1790s, he adopted antislavery views under the influence of his mentor George Wythe.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=19-21}} Like most of his contemporaries, Clay was not a racial egalitarian, and he never called for the immediate abolition of slavery, but he viewed slavery as a \"grievous wrong to the slave\" and spoke in favor of equal treatment for [[free black]]s.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=189\u2013191}} Early in his career, Clay favored gradual emancipation in both Kentucky and Missouri, but each state rejected plans that would have provided for gradual emancipation.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=33\u201336, 143-144}} Clay continued to  support gradual emancipation throughout his career, and in 1849 he published an open letter calling for gradual emancipation in Kentucky.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=354\u2013356}} Unlike many other Southern leaders, he consistently favored recognition of [[Haiti]], which had been established through a [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolt]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=191\u2013192}} \n\nIn 1816, Clay helped establish the [[American Colonization Society]], a group that wanted to establish a colony for free American blacks in Africa. The group was made up of [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] who wanted to end slavery and slaveholders who wanted to deport free blacks.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=133}} Clay's support for colonization reflected his belief that a multiracial society was ultimately unworkable, both for whites and free blacks.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=198\u2013199}} Later in his career, Clay became increasingly concerned about abolitionism, remarking that \"the ultraism of the South on the one hand ... and the ultraism of abolition on the other\" represented the greatest threat to the Union. Nonetheless, he consistently defended the right of abolitionists to send materials through the mail and opposed the [[gag rule]], which limited congressional debate on slavery.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=204\u2013205, 247}}\n\nMany contemporaries, including anti-slavery activist [[James G. Birney]], believed that Clay's home state of Kentucky had the most permissive slave laws of any slave state. Clay considered himself to be a \"good\" master, and biographer James C. Klotter concludes that Clay took actions, such as keeping families together, to mitigate the harshness of slavery. Klotter also concludes that there is no evidence that Clay ever had an affair with any of his slaves. Yet, as Clay himself wrote, \"here in Kentucky slavery is in its most mitigated form, still it is slavery.\"{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=192\u2013193, 196}} In 1829, Clay's slave, [[Charlotte Dupuy]], [[freedom suit|sued for her freedom]] while visiting relatives in Maryland. Dupuy's attorney gained an order from the court for her to remain in Washington until the case was settled, and she worked for wages for 18 months for Martin Van Buren, Clay's successor as secretary of state.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=217-218}} The case embarrassed Clay politically and personally, but he ultimately prevailed in court. After winning the case, Clay sent Dupuy to New Orleans, causing her to be away from her own family, but he later freed Dupuy and two of her children.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=195\u2013196}} Clay's will freed all the slaves he held at the time of his death.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=484}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Historical reputation===\n\n\nClay's Whig Party collapsed shortly after his death, but Clay cast a long shadow over the generation of political leaders that presided over the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Mississippi Senator [[Henry S. Foote]] stated his opinion that \"had there been one such man in the Congress of the United States as Henry Clay in 1860-'61 there would, I feel sure, have been no civil war\".{{sfn|Remini|1991|pp=761\u2013762}}<ref name=\"king1\">{{cite magazine|last1=King|first1=Gilbert|title=The Day Henry Clay Refused to Compromise|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-day-henry-clay-refused-to-compromise-153589853/?no-ist|accessdate=25 October 2016|magazine=Smithsonian|date=6 December 2012}}</ref> Clay's protege and fellow Kentuckian, John J.

He was the seventh [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House speaker]] and the ninth [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]]. He received [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] for president in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]], [[1832 United States presidential election|1832]], and [[1844 United States presidential election|1844]] presidential elections. He also helped found both the [[National Republican Party]] and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. For his role in defusing sectional crises, he earned the appellation of the \"Great Compromiser.\"\n\nClay was born in [[Hanover County, Virginia]] in 1777 and launched a legal career in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], in 1797. As a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], Clay won election to the Kentucky state legislature in 1803 and to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1810. He was chosen as speaker of the House in early 1811 and, along with President [[James Madison]], led the United States into the [[War of 1812]] against [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In 1814, he helped negotiate the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which brought an end to the War of 1812. After the war, Clay returned to his position as speaker of the House and developed the [[American System (economic plan)|American System]], which called for federal [[internal improvements|infrastructure investments]], support for the [[history of central banking in the United States|national bank]], and [[protective tariff|protective]] [[tariffs in United States history|tariff rates]]. In 1820, he helped bring an end to a sectional crisis over [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] by leading the passage of the [[Missouri Compromise]].\n\nClay finished with the fourth-most electoral votes in the multi-candidate [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]], and he helped [[John Quincy Adams]] win the [[contingent election]] held to select the president. President Adams appointed Clay to the prestigious position of secretary of state; critics alleged that the two had agreed to a \"[[First Corrupt Bargain|corrupt bargain]].\" Despite receiving support from Clay and other National Republicans, Adams was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Andrew Jackson]] in the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]]. Clay won election to the Senate in 1831 and ran as the National Republican nominee in the 1832 presidential election, but he was defeated by President Jackson. After the 1832 election, Clay helped bring an end to the [[Nullification Crisis]] by leading passage of the [[Tariff of 1833]]. During Jackson's second term, opponents of the president coalesced into the Whig Party, and Clay became a leading congressional Whig. \n\nClay sought the presidency in the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 election]] but was defeated at the [[1839 Whig National Convention|Whig National Convention]] by [[William Henry Harrison]]. He clashed with Harrison's running mate and successor, [[John Tyler]], who broke with Clay and other congressional Whigs after taking office in 1841. Clay resigned from the Senate in 1842 and won the 1844 Whig presidential nomination, but he was defeated in the [[1844 United States presidential election|general election]] by Democrat [[James K. Polk]], who made the annexation of the [[Republic of Texas]] his key issue. Clay strongly criticized the subsequent [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and sought the Whig presidential nomination in [[1848 United States presidential election|1848]], but was defeated by General [[Zachary Taylor]]. After returning to the Senate in 1849, Clay played a key role in passing the [[Compromise of 1850]], which resolved a crisis over the status of slavery in the [[Territories of the United States|territories]]. Clay is generally regarded as one of the most important and influential political figures of his era.<ref>Smith, D.

However, Clay did not follow, as Watkins secured him temporary employment in a [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] emporium, with the promise that Clay would receive the next available clerkship at the [[Virginia Court of Chancery]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=13-15}}\n\nAfter Clay worked in the Richmond emporium for one year, a clerkship finally opened up at the Virginia Court of Chancery. Clay adapted well to his new role, and his handwriting earned him the attention of [[College of William and Mary|William & Mary]] professor [[George Wythe]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], mentor of [[Thomas Jefferson]], and judge on Virginia's High Court of Chancery.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=19-20}} Hampered by a crippled hand, Wythe chose Clay as his secretary and [[amanuensis]], a role in which Clay would remain for four years.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=7}} Wythe had a powerful effect on Clay's worldview, and Clay embraced Wythe's belief that the example of the United States could help spread human freedom around the world.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=20-21}} Wythe arranged for Clay a position with the Virginia attorney general, [[Robert Brooke (Virginia)|Robert Brooke]], with the understanding that Brooke would finish Clay's legal studies.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=23}} Under Brooke's tutelage, Clay was admitted to the Virginia Bar in 1797.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=5}}\n\n==Marriage and family==\n{{See also|Clay family}}\n\nOn April 11, 1799, Clay married Lucretia Hart at the Hart home in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. Her father, Colonel Thomas Hart, was early settler of Kentucky and a prominent businessman.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=12}} Hart proved to be an important business connection for Clay, as he helped Clay gain new clients and grow in professional stature.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=41\u201342}} Hart was the namesake and grand-uncle of Missouri Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and was also related to [[James Brown (Louisiana politician)|James Brown]], a prominent Louisiana politician, and [[Isaac Shelby]], the first [[Governor of Kentucky]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=12\u201313}} Henry and Lucretia would remain married until his death in 1852; she lived until 1864, dying at the age of 83.

By 1835, all six daughters had died of varying causes, two when very young, two as children, and the last two as young mothers. Henry Jr. was killed while commanding a regiment at the [[Battle of Buena Vista]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Clay's oldest son, Theodore Wythe Clay, spent the second half of his life confined to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. When a young child, Theodore was injured by a blow to his head that fractured his skull. As he grew older his condition devolved into insanity and from 1831 until his death in 1870 he was confined to [[Eastern State Hospital (Kentucky)|an asylum in Lexington]].<ref name = \"Gatton\">{{cite journal |last1=Gatton |first1=John Spalding |title=\"Mr. Clay & I got stung\": Harriet Martineau in Lexington |journal=The Kentucky Review |date=Fall 1979 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=55-56 |url=https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1344&context=kentucky-review |accessdate=May 16, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=402}} Thomas (who had served some jail-time in Philadelphia in 1829-1830)<ref name = \"Gatton\"/> became a successful farmer, James established a legal practice (and later served in Congress), and John (who in his mid-20s was also confined to the Asylum for a short time) became a successful horse breeder.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=285\u2013286}} After the deaths of Anne and Susan, Clay and Lucretia raised several grandchildren at Ashland.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=288}}\n\nThey initially lived in downtown Lexington, but in 1804 they began building a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] outside of Lexington known as [[Ashland (Henry Clay estate)|Ashland]]. The Ashland estate eventually encompassed over 500 acres, with numerous outbuildings such as a smokehouse, a greenhouse, and several barns. Clay owned a maximum of about 50 slaves, and he planted crops like corn, wheat, and rye, as well as [[hemp]], the chief crop of the [[Bluegrass region]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=275\u2013277}} Clay also took a strong interest in [[thoroughbred racing]] and imported livestock such as [[Arabian horse]]s, [[Maltese donkey]]s, and [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] cattle.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=277\u2013278}} Though Clay suffered some financial issues during economic downturns, he never fell deeply into debt and ultimately left his children a large inheritance.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=279\u2013280}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Early law and political career==\n===Legal career===\n[[File:Henry Clay's law office.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|View of Henry Clay's law office (1803\u20131810), Lexington, Kentucky]]\n\nIn November 1797, Clay relocated to Lexington, Kentucky, near where his parents and siblings resided. The Bluegrass Region, with Lexington at its center, had quickly grown in the preceding decades, but had only recently stopped being under the threat of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] raids. Lexington was an established town that hosted [[Transylvania University]], the first university west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=27-29}} Having already passed the Virginia Bar, Clay quickly received a Kentucky license to practice law. After apprenticing himself to Kentucky attorneys such as [[George Nicholas]], [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckinridge]], and James Brown, Clay established his own law practice, frequently working on debt collections and land disputes.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=30-31}} Clay soon established a reputation for strong legal ability and courtroom oratory. In 1805, he was appointed to the faculty of [[Transylvania University]], where he taught, among others, future Kentucky Governor [[Robert P. Letcher]] and Robert Todd, the future father-in-law of [[Abraham Lincoln]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=43}}\n\nClay's most notable client was [[Aaron Burr]], who was indicted for allegedly planning an [[Burr conspiracy|expedition]] into [[New Spain|Spanish territory]] west of the [[Mississippi River]].

Biddle]]'', Clay submitted the Supreme Court's first [[amicus curiae]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=156}}\n\n===Early political career===\n\nClay began dabbling in politics shortly after arriving in Kentucky. In the first political speech of his career, Clay attacked the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], federal laws designed to suppress dissent during the [[Quasi-War]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=20\u201321}} Like most Kentuckians, Clay was a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], but he clashed with state party leaders over a state constitutional convention. Using the pseudonym \"Scaevola\" (in reference to [[Gaius Mucius Scaevola]]), Clay advocated for direct elections for Kentucky elected officials and the gradual emancipation of [[History of slavery in Kentucky|slavery in Kentucky]]. The 1799 [[Kentucky Constitution]] included the direct election of public officials, but the state did not adopt Clay's plan for gradual emancipation.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=33-36}} \n\nIn 1803, Clay won election to the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=21\u201323}} His first legislative initiative was the partisan [[gerrymandering in the United States|gerrymander]] of Kentucky's [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] districts, which ensured that all of Kentucky's presidential electors voted for President Thomas Jefferson in the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 presidential election]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=48-51}} Clay clashed with legislators who sought to reduce the power of Clay's Bluegrass Region, and he unsuccessfully advocated moving the state capitol from [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] to Lexington. Clay frequently opposed populist firebrand [[Felix Grundy]], and he helped defeat Grundy's effort to revoke the banking privileges of the state-owned Kentucky Insurance Company. He advocated for the construction of [[internal improvements]], which would become a consistent theme throughout his public career.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=48-51}} Clay's influence in Kentucky state politics was such that in 1806 the Kentucky legislature elected him to the [[United States Senate]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=25\u201326}}{{efn|When elected by the legislature, Clay was below the [[Article One of the United States Constitution|constitutionally required age of thirty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cop.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Youngest_Senator.htm|title=Youngest Senator|publisher=United States Senate}}</ref> It is unclear whether the state legislature or Clay himself knew that he did not meet the Senate's age requirement at the time, though he did know of the issue later in his career.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=26}} Such an age qualification issue [[United States Senate#Qualifications|has occurred with only three other U.S. Senators]]: [[Armistead Thomson Mason]], [[John Jordan Crittenden]], and [[John Eaton (politician)|John Eaton]].}} During his two-month tenure in the Senate, Clay advocated for the construction of various bridges and canals, including [[Chesapeake & Delaware Canal|a canal connecting]] the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and the [[Delaware River]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=64-67}}\n\nAfter Clay returned to Kentucky in 1807, he was elected as the [[Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives|speaker]] of the state house of representatives.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=10\u201310}} That same year, in response to attacks on American shipping by [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], President Jefferson arranged passage of the [[Embargo Act of 1807]]. In support of Jefferson's policy, which limited trade with foreign powers, Clay introduced a resolution to require legislators to wear [[Spinning (textiles)|homespun]] suits rather than those made of imported British [[broadcloth]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=70-71}} The vast majority of members of the state house voted for the measure, but [[Humphrey Marshall (politician)|Humphrey Marshall]], an \"aristocratic lawyer who possessed a sarcastic tongue,\" voted against it.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=17}} In early 1809, Clay challenged Marshall to a duel, which took place on January 19.{{sfn|Remini|1991|p=55}} While many contemporary duels were called off or fought without the intention of killing one another, both Clay and Marshall fought the duel with intent of killing their opponent.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=72-73}} They each had three turns to shoot; both were hit by bullets, but both survived.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=17}} Clay quickly recovered from his injury, and received only a minor censure from the Kentucky legislature.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=74}}\n\nIn 1810, U.S. Senator [[Buckner Thruston]] resigned to accept appointment to a position as a federal judge, and Clay was selected by the legislature to fill Thruston's seat. Clay quickly emerged as a fierce critic of British attacks on American shipping, becoming part of an informal group of \"[[war hawk]]s\" who favored expansionist policies.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=26\u201330}} He also advocated the annexation of [[West Florida]], which was controlled by [[Spain]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=79-81}} On the insistence of the Kentucky legislature, Clay helped prevent the re-charter of the [[First Bank of the United States]], arguing that it interfered with state banks and infringed on [[states' rights]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=81-83}} After serving in the Senate for one year, Clay decided that he disliked the rules of the Senate and instead sought election to the [[United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=76-78}} He won election unopposed in late 1810.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=30}}\n\n==Speaker of the House==\n[[File:Henry Clay.JPG|thumb|upright=.90|Portrait by [[Matthew Harris Jouett]], 1818]]\n\n===Election and leadership===\n\nThe [[1810 and 1811 United States House of Representatives elections|1810-11 elections]] produced many young, anti-British members of Congress who, like Clay, supported going to war with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]].

Clay was exceptional in his ability to control the legislative agenda through well-placed allies and the establishment of new committees, and departed from precedent by frequently taking part in floor debates.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=86}} Yet he also gained a reputation for personal courteousness and fairness in his rulings and committee appointments.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=31\u201332}} Clay's drive to increase the power of the office of speaker was aided by President [[James Madison]], who deferred to Congress in most matters.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=88-89}} [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]], a member of the Democratic-Republican Party but also a member of the \"[[tertium quids]]\" group that opposed many federal initiatives, emerged as a prominent opponent of Speaker Clay.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=87-88}} While Randolph frequently attempted to obstruct Clay's initiatives, Clay became a master of parliamentary maneuvers that enabled him to advance his agenda even over the attempted obstruction of Randolph and others.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=96}}{{efn|The Clay\u2013Randolph rivalry eventually escalated into a duel in 1826, the second of two duels fought by Clay, and ended with both parties unhurt.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=65\u201367}}}}\n\n===Madison administration, 1811\u20131817===\n{{Further|Presidency of James Madison}}\n\nClay and other House war hawks demanded that the British revoke the [[Orders in Council (1807)|Orders in Council]], a series of decrees that had resulted in a de facto commercial war with the United States.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=89-90}} Though Clay recognized the dangers inherent in fighting Britain, one of the most powerful countries in the world, he saw it as the only realistic alternative to a humiliating submission to British attacks on American shipping.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=33}} Clay led a successful effort in the House to [[Declaration of war by the United States|declare war]] against Britain, complying with a request from President Madison.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=97-98}} Madison signed the declaration of war on June 18, 1812, beginning the [[War of 1812]]. During the war, Clay frequently communicated with Secretary of State [[James Monroe]] and Secretary of War [[William Eustis]], though he advocated for the replacement of the latter.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=99-101}} The war started poorly for the Americans, and Clay lost friends and relatives in the fighting.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=97-98}} In October 1813, the British asked Madison to begin negotiations in Europe, and Madison asked Clay to join his diplomatic team, as the president hoped that the presence of the leading War Hawk would ensure support for an Anglo-American peace treaty. Clay was reluctant to leave Congress, but felt duty-bound to accept the offer, and so he resigned from Congress on January 19, 1814.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=107-108}}\n\nClay left the country on February 25, but negotiations with the British did not begin until August 1814. Clay was part of a team of five commissioners that also included Treasury Secretary [[Albert Gallatin]], Senator [[James A. Bayard (elder)|James Bayard]], ambassador [[Jonathan Russell]], and ambassador [[John Quincy Adams]], the nominal head of the American team.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=108-111}} Clay and Adams maintained an uneasy relationship marked by frequent clashes, and Gallatin emerged as the unofficial leader of the American commission.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=110-115}} When the British finally presented their initial peace offer, Clay was outraged by its terms, especially the British proposal for an [[Indian barrier state]] on the [[Great Lakes]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=112-113}} After a series of American military successes in 1814, the British delegation made several concessions and offered a better peace deal.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=116-117}} While Adams and Gallatin were eager to make peace as quickly as possible even if that required sub-optimal terms in the peace treaty, Clay believed that the British, worn down by years of fighting against France, greatly desired peace with the United States. Partly due to Clay's hard-line stance, the [[Treaty of Ghent]] included relatively favorable terms for the United States, essentially re-establishing the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'' between Britain and the U.S. The treaty was signed on December 24, 1814, bringing a close to the War of 1812.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=35\u201336}} After the signing of the treaty, Clay briefly traveled to [[London]], where he helped Gallatin negotiate a commercial agreement with Britain.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=117}}\n\nClay returned to the United States in September 1815; despite his absence, he had been elected to another term in the House of Representatives. Upon his return to Congress, Clay won election as Speaker of the House.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=119-122}} The War of 1812 strengthened Clay's support for interventionist economic policies such as federally-funded internal improvements, which he believed were necessary to improve the country's infrastructure system.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=39\u201340}} He eagerly embraced President Madison's ambitious domestic package, which included infrastructure investment, [[tariffs in United States history|tariffs]] to [[protective tariffs|protect]] domestic manufacturing, and spending increases for the army and navy. With the help of [[John C. Calhoun]] and [[William Lowndes (congressman)|William Lowndes]], Clay passed the [[Tariff of 1816]], which served the dual purpose of raising revenue and protecting American manufacturing.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=123-125}} To stabilize the currency, Clay and Treasury Secretary [[Alexander J. Dallas (statesman)|Alexander Dallas]] arranged passage of a bill establishing the [[Second Bank of the United States]] (also known as the national bank).{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=125-131}} Clay also supported the [[Bonus Bill of 1817]], which would have provided a fund for internal improvements, but Madison vetoed the bill on constitutional concerns.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=132-133}} Beginning in 1818, Clay advocated for an economic plan known as the \"[[American System (economic plan)|American System]],\" which encompassed many of the economic measures, including protective tariffs and infrastructure investments, that he helped pass in the aftermath of the War of 1812.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=81\u201382}}\n\n===Monroe administration, 1817\u20131825===\n{{Further|Presidency of James Monroe}}\n\nLike Jefferson and [[George Washington]], President Madison decided to retire after two terms, leaving open the Democratic-Republican nomination for the [[1816 United States presidential election|1816 presidential election]]. At the time, the Democratic-Republicans used a [[congressional nominating caucus]] to choose their presidential nominees, giving congressmen a powerful role in the presidential selection process. Monroe and Secretary of War [[William H. Crawford|William Crawford]] emerged as the two main candidates for the Democratic-Republican nomination. Clay had a favorable opinion of both individuals, but he supported Monroe, who won the nomination and went on to defeat Federalist candidate [[Rufus King]] in the general election.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=126-130}} Monroe offered Clay the position of secretary of war, but Clay strongly desired the office of secretary of state, and was angered when Monroe instead chose John Quincy Adams for that position.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=40\u201341}} Clay became so bitter that he refused to allow Monroe's inauguration to take place in the House Chamber, and subsequently did not attend Monroe's outdoor inauguration.{{sfn|Remini|1991|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nIn early 1819, a dispute erupted over the proposed statehood of [[Missouri]] after New York Congressman [[James Tallmadge, Jr.|James Tallmadge]] introduced a [[Tallmadge Amendment|legislative amendment]] that would provide for the gradual emancipation of Missouri's slaves.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=44\u201345}} Though Clay had previously called for gradual emancipation in Kentucky, he sided with the Southerners in voting down Tallmadge's amendment.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=143-144}} Clay instead supported Illinois Senator [[Jesse B. Thomas]]'s compromise proposal in which Missouri would be admitted as a [[slave state]], [[Maine]] would be admitted as a free state,{{efn|Maine was [[District of Maine|part]] of Massachusetts prior to gaining statehood.}} and slavery would be forbidden in the territories north of 36\u00b0 30' parallel.

However, Whigs tended to favor a stronger legislature, a stronger federal government, a higher tariff, greater spending on infrastructure, re-authorization of the Second Bank of the United States, and publicly funded education. Conversely, Democrats tended to favor a stronger president, stronger state governments, lower tariffs, [[Hard money (policy)|hard money]], and expansionism. Neither party took a strong national stand on slavery.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=313-315}} The Whig base of support lay in wealthy businessmen, professionals, the professional class, and large planters, while the Democratic base of support lay in immigrant [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]] and yeomen farmers, but each party appealed across class lines.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=229\u2013231}}\n\nPartly due to grief over the death of his daughter, Anne, Clay chose not to run in the [[1836 United States presidential election|1836 presidential election]], and the Whigs were too disorganized to nominate a single candidate.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=272-273}} Three Whig candidates ran against Van Buren: General [[William Henry Harrison]], Senator [[Hugh Lawson White]], and Senator Daniel Webster. By running multiple candidates, the Whigs hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives. Clay personally preferred Webster, but he threw his backing behind Harrison who had the broadest appeal among voters.

Clay and his congressional allies attempted to craft a national bank bill acceptable to Tyler, but Tyler vetoed two separate bills to re-establish the national bank, showing that he in fact had no will to reach a solution for the party's issues. Clay and other Whig leaders were now outraged not only by Tyler's rejection of the Whig party platform, but also because they felt that Tyler had purposely misled them into thinking that he would sign the bills.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=265\u2013269}} \n\nAfter the second veto, congressional Whigs voted to expel Tyler from the party, and on Clay's request every Cabinet member except for Webster, who wanted to continue negotiating the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] with Great Britain about the border to Canada, resigned from office.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=351-353}} This made Tyler increasingly move closer to his former Democratic Party and, with Webster still serving in the Tyler administration, Clay emerged as the clear leader of the Whig Party.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=270\u2013271}} In early 1842, Clay resigned from the Senate after arranging for Crittenden to succeed him.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=362-363}} Though he vetoed other Whig bills, Tyler did sign some Whig priorities into law, including the [[Preemption Act of 1841]], which distributed the proceeds of land sales to the states, and the Bankruptcy Act of 1841, which was the first law in U.S. history that allowed for voluntary bankruptcy.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=592\u2013593}} Facing a large budget deficit, Tyler also signed the [[Tariff of 1842]], which restored the protective rates of the Tariff of 1832 but ended the distribution policy that had been established with the Preemption Act of 1841.{{sfn|Peterson|1989|pp=103\u2013108}}\n\n====1844 presidential election====\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1844.svg|thumb|upright=1|James K.

The same day that Clay published a letter opposing the annexation of Texas, Van Buren also came out against annexation, citing similar reasons as Clay, so that slavery and especially expansionism seemed to play no role in the next election.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=296\u2013298}}{{efn|Some writers have come to the conclusion that Clay and Van Buren had reached an agreement to jointly oppose annexation, but Klotter writes that \"no real evidence\" supports this conclusion.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=298}}}} Clay unanimously won the presidential nomination at the [[1844 Whig National Convention]], but a minority of expansionist Southern Democrats, encouraged by Tyler's alternative outline, blocked Van Buren's nomination at the [[1844 Democratic National Convention]] for countless ballots, until Van Buren withdrew, making place for an unexpected compromise candidate: The party nominated former Speaker of the House [[James K. Polk]] of Tennessee, who favored annexation but in order to calm down anti-expansionists promised to just run for a single term.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=387\u2013388}} Following the nomination of a pro-annexation Democrat, Tyler soon ended his incipient independent run for president and endorsed Polk.{{sfn|Peterson|1989|pp=239\u2013241}}\n\nClay was surprised by Van Buren's defeat, but remained confident of his chances in the 1844 election.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=388-389}} Polk was the first \"[[dark horse]]\" presidential nominee in U.S. history, and Whigs mocked him as a \"fourth rate politician.\" Despite his relative lack of national stature, Polk proved to be a strong candidate capable of uniting the factions of the Democratic Party and winning the support of Southerners who had been reluctant to support Van Buren.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=302\u2013303}} Clay's stance on slavery alienated some voters in both the North and the South. Pro-slavery Southerners flocked to Polk, while many Northern [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]s, who tended to align with the Whig Party, favored [[James G. Birney]] of the [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=307\u2013309}} Clay's opposition to annexation damaged his campaign in the South, as Democrats argued that he worked in unison with Northerners to prevent the extension of slavery.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=311\u2013312}} In July, Clay wrote two letters in which he attempted to clarify his position on the annexation of Texas, and Democrats attacked his supposedly inconsistent position.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=390}} \n\nPolk won the election, taking 49.5% of the popular vote and 170 of the 275 electoral votes.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=392}}{{efn|Clay received a significant share of the presidential electoral vote in three separate elections, [[List of United States major party presidential tickets|a feat matched only]] by [[John Adams]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Grover Cleveland]], [[Franklin D.

In 1846, the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] broke out after American and Mexican forces clashed at the disputed border region between Mexico and Texas.

Clay's American System rejected [[strict constructionism]] in favor of an activist government that would help ensure a fairer and more efficient distribution of economic gains. The American System had four key tenets: high tariffs, a stable financial system, federal investment in internal improvements, and a public land sale policy designed to raise revenue and provide for carefully-managed expansion into the [[American frontier]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=80\u201382}} Through high tariffs, Clay hoped to free the United States from dependence on foreign imports, especially from Britain.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=85\u201387}} Clay sought to ensure a stable financial system through support for the national bank, which regulated the country's banking system and helped ensure a consistent supply of credit.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=87\u201389}} Clay's support for federally-financed internal improvements stemmed from his belief that only the federal government could construct the transportation system necessary for uniting the country commercially and culturally.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=89\u201391}} His land policy was centered on the using revenue from land sales to fund money to the states, which could then invest that money in education, infrastructure projects, and other priorities.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=220\u2013221}}\n\n===Slavery and the Dupuy case===\n\nClay inherited slaves as a young child,{{sfn|Eaton|1957|pp=6\u20137}} and he continued to own slaves throughout his life. However, in the 1790s, he adopted antislavery views under the influence of his mentor George Wythe.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=19-21}} Like most of his contemporaries, Clay was not a racial egalitarian, and he never called for the immediate abolition of slavery, but he viewed slavery as a \"grievous wrong to the slave\" and spoke in favor of equal treatment for [[free black]]s.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=189\u2013191}} Early in his career, Clay favored gradual emancipation in both Kentucky and Missouri, but each state rejected plans that would have provided for gradual emancipation.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=33\u201336, 143-144}} Clay continued to  support gradual emancipation throughout his career, and in 1849 he published an open letter calling for gradual emancipation in Kentucky.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=354\u2013356}} Unlike many other Southern leaders, he consistently favored recognition of [[Haiti]], which had been established through a [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolt]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=191\u2013192}} \n\nIn 1816, Clay helped establish the [[American Colonization Society]], a group that wanted to establish a colony for free American blacks in Africa. The group was made up of [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] who wanted to end slavery and slaveholders who wanted to deport free blacks.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=133}} Clay's support for colonization reflected his belief that a multiracial society was ultimately unworkable, both for whites and free blacks.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=198\u2013199}} Later in his career, Clay became increasingly concerned about abolitionism, remarking that \"the ultraism of the South on the one hand ... and the ultraism of abolition on the other\" represented the greatest threat to the Union. Nonetheless, he consistently defended the right of abolitionists to send materials through the mail and opposed the [[gag rule]], which limited congressional debate on slavery.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=204\u2013205, 247}}\n\nMany contemporaries, including anti-slavery activist [[James G. Birney]], believed that Clay's home state of Kentucky had the most permissive slave laws of any slave state. Clay considered himself to be a \"good\" master, and biographer James C. Klotter concludes that Clay took actions, such as keeping families together, to mitigate the harshness of slavery. Klotter also concludes that there is no evidence that Clay ever had an affair with any of his slaves. Yet, as Clay himself wrote, \"here in Kentucky slavery is in its most mitigated form, still it is slavery.\"{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=192\u2013193, 196}} In 1829, Clay's slave, [[Charlotte Dupuy]], [[freedom suit|sued for her freedom]] while visiting relatives in Maryland. Dupuy's attorney gained an order from the court for her to remain in Washington until the case was settled, and she worked for wages for 18 months for Martin Van Buren, Clay's successor as secretary of state.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=217-218}} The case embarrassed Clay politically and personally, but he ultimately prevailed in court. After winning the case, Clay sent Dupuy to New Orleans, causing her to be away from her own family, but he later freed Dupuy and two of her children.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=195\u2013196}} Clay's will freed all the slaves he held at the time of his death.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=484}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Historical reputation===\n\n\nClay's Whig Party collapsed shortly after his death, but Clay cast a long shadow over the generation of political leaders that presided over the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].
