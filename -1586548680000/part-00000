It is a sequel to the ''Witcher ''short stories collected in the books ''[[The Last Wish (book)|The Last Wish]]'' ({{lang|pl|Ostatnie \u017cyczenie}}) and ''[[Sword of Destiny]]'' ({{lang|pl|Miecz przeznaczenia}}) and is followed by ''[[Time of Contempt]]'' ({{lang|pl|Czas pogardy}}). The book won the [[Janusz A. Zajdel Award]] and [[David Gemmell Legend Award]] awards. An English translation was published in the United Kingdom in 2008 (Gollancz) and in the United States in 2009 (Orbit).\n\n==Plot==\nAbout a year before the beginning of the story, the Empire of Nilfgaard attacks the Kingdom of Cintra. Queen Calanthe, mortally wounded, commits suicide and her granddaughter, [[Ciri (character)|Cirilla]], called Ciri and nicknamed the \"Lion Cub of Cintra\" manages to flee from the burning capital city. Emhyr var Emreis, Emperor of Nilfgaard, sends his spies to find her. He knows that this young girl has great importance, not only because of her royal blood, but also because of her magical potential and elven blood in her veins.\n\nAlmost two years after the war (won by the Northern Kingdoms), the rulers of the North meet in secret, to discuss the political situation. Peace with Nilfgaard is not what it was supposed to be. Nilfgaardian financial power is ruining the northern economy, Nilfgaardian emissaries agitate aristocrats and merchants against their monarchs, elves and dwarves have formed partisan groups called Scoia'tael (Squirrels) and are conducting acts of terror against humans - and in every major city cultists are prophesying that the world will end, unless the Savior comes from the South. The kings decide to start a war, before the Empire weakens their countries further, and to regain Cintra. They are aware that the Emperor is looking for Ciri to marry her (morganatically) and thus to gain the rights to Cintra, which is now under Nilfgaardian occupation. To prevent this, the monarchs decide to find and kill Ciri.\n\nThe girl is being protected by [[Geralt of Rivia]], a witcher: a magically and genetically mutated monster slayer for hire, who takes her to the witchers' keep, Kaer Morhen. There Ciri is taught by other witchers, including old Vesemir, Co\u00ebn, Eskel, and Lambert. She learns about monsters and how to fight them. She is taught to fight with a sword in the witcher style. During her \"education\", the sorceress Triss Merigold comes to Kaer Morhen. She had been summoned by Vesemir to help with occasional strange and abnormal behavior he had seen in Ciri. Triss realises that Ciri is a Source. She acknowledges that she does not have the power to control Ciri's talent, and advises Geralt to swallow his pride and seek help from Yennefer, a more experienced sorceress and his former lover.\n\nAt the same time, a mysterious wizard called Rience is looking for the girl. He is a servant of a more powerful mage, whose identity remains unknown. He captures Geralt's friend, Dandelion the bard, and tortures him for information about Ciri. Dandelion is saved by the timely arrival of Yennefer, who engages in a short magic duel with Rience. Rience manages to escape through a portal opened by his master, but is left with a prominent facial scar from Yennefer's spell.\n\nIn the spring, Geralt leaves Kaer Morhen with Triss and Ciri, intending to deliver Ciri to the Temple School in Ellander where she would receive a \"normal\" education from Nenneke. On the way, Triss falls ill, and they join Yarpen Zigrin's dwarven company who is leading a caravan for King Henselt of Kaedwen. Geralt tells Ciri about the roses of Aelirenn, an elf who died leading elven youths to fight the humans in a hopeless attack. The caravan is attacked by the Scoia'tael, and it is revealed that the escort mission was a trap set by the kings who doubted Yarpen's loyalty.\n\nCiri's stay in Ellander is still haunted by disturbing dreams until the arrival of Yennefer, who starts educating her in the ways of magic. From an initial antagonism, their relationship develops into a strong and deep bond, like that of a mother and daughter.\n\nMeanwhile, Geralt does his best to track Rience and his mysterious employer. With the help of Dandelion, Shani, and the sorceress Philippa Eilhart, he forces a confrontation with Rience (the latter aided by Michelet quadruplets - famous murderers for hire), during which both are injured. Rience's master intervenes again, opening a portal for him, and Geralt is prevented from pursuing the mage by Philippa Eilhart, who also kills the last surviving Michelet brother so as not to provide Geralt any source of information which might eventually reveal the mysterious mage. Geralt is left gravely wounded.\n\nYennefer became Ciri's mentor and teacher. As they are about to leave the Temple School in Ellander, Yennefer asks Ciri whether she did not like her at first, leading to a series of flashbacks detailing Ciri's studies with Yennefer from the day they were introduced and back to the present as they are about to leave the Temple. Ciri responds by admitting that she did not like her, and they leave.\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Geralt of Rivia]]. A Witcher, a human who has been transformed into a supernatural monster-slayer by the ingestion of various mutagens. Although Witchers rarely get involved in politics, Geralt takes under his charge a political refugee called Ciri, the granddaughter of the previous Queen of Cintra, a kingdom destroyed by Nilfgaardian invaders. He is the protagonist of tie-in videogames ''[[The Witcher (video game)|The Witcher]]'', ''[[The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings]]'' and ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt]]''.\n* Triss Merigold. A powerful sorceress and member of the Chapter of Wizards, Triss wields significant power and unclear motives.\n* Cirilla, ''the Lion-Cub of Cintra'', is the young granddaughter of the deceased and overthrown Queen Calanthe of Cintra. The blood of the elves flow through her veins, and she is hunted down for the mysterious yet dangerous power which she possesses.\n* Dandelion. Geralt's best friend. A charming, famous poet who is also a spy for the King of Redania.\n* Yennefer of Vengerberg. Another member of the Chapter of Wizards, and an on-again off-again lover of Geralt's. Considered more powerful than even Triss Merrigold, Yennefer is called upon to try and gain an understanding of Ciri's power.\n* Philippa Eilhart. A senior sorceress of the Chapter of Wizards, and trusted advisor to the King of Redania, alongside royal spymaster Sigismund Dijkstra. She is one of the few mages that has mastered the rare art of magical polymorphy, enabling her to transform into an owl. She aids Geralt in tracking down the renegade mage Rience who is looking for Ciri on behalf of Nilfgaard and another more powerful mage, whom she does not want Geralt to be aware of.\n\n==Translations==\n*Czech (Leonardo, 1995){{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n*Brazilian Portuguese (WMF Martins Fontes, 2013){{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n*Bulgarian (InfoDAR/\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0414\u0410\u0420 2008) {{ISBN|978-954-761-332-4}}\n*Dutch (Luitingh-Sijthoff B.V., 2014) {{ISBN|978-90-245-6401-9}}\n*English\n**UK ([[Victor Gollancz Ltd]], 16 October 2008) {{ISBN|0-575-08318-2}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.orionbooks.co.uk/titles/andrzej-sapkowski/blood-of-elves/9780575087491/ |title=Andrzej Sapkowski - Blood of Elves |website=The Orion Publishing Group |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref>\n**US (Orbit, April 28, 2009), translated by Danusia Stok. {{ISBN|978-031-6-02919-3}}\n*Estonian (Varrak, 2017), {{ISBN|9789985341742}}\n*Finnish ([[Werner S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m Osakeyhti\u00f6|WSOY]], 2012) {{ISBN|978-951-0-39023-8}}\n*French (Bragelonne, 2008){{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n*German (Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag, 1 November 2008) {{ISBN|3-423-24700-2}}\n*Hungarian (PlayON, 2013){{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n*Italian (Editrice Nord, 2012)  {{ISBN|978-88-429-1665-9}}\n*Japanese (2010) {{ISBN|978-4-15-020514-0}}\n*Lithuanian (Eridanas, 2006){{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n*Russian ([[AST (publisher)|AST]], 1996){{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n*Serbian (\u010carobna Knjiga, 2012){{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n*Spanish (Bibli\u00f3polis, 2003){{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n*Swedish (2011){{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n*Slovak (2016){{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n*Turkish (Pegasus, 2017) {{ISBN|9786052992715}}\n*Croatian\n\n==Adaptations==\nIn 2014 a Polish audiobook has been released.

It was released on August 23, 2013 in [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]], and was released on [[iTunes]] on August 27, 2013 and in North America on the same day. The album was produced by [[Mike Elizondo]]. ''Hail to the King'' is the only Avenged Sevenfold album to feature drummer Arin Ilejay, prior to his departure in July 2015. It is also the first Avenged Sevenfold album without musical contributions from Ilejay's late predecessor, [[The Rev|Jimmy \"The Rev\" Sullivan]]; the bonus track, \"St. James\", was written in his memory.\n\nThe album was a commercial and critical success, reaching number 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. This marks Avenged Sevenfold's second album to top the ''Billboard'' chart (the first being ''[[Nightmare (Avenged Sevenfold album)|Nightmare]]''), as well as their first to reach number 1 in the UK, topping the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It also topped the Canadian, Brazilian, Finnish and Irish album charts. Also, the album spawned two number 1 singles on Billboard's Mainstream Rock, Hail to the King, and Shepherd of Fire. The former spent 11 weeks on the top of the chart.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.billboard.com/artist/280315/avenged-sevenfold/chart?f=376|title = Avenged Sevenfold|publisher = Nielsen Inc.|accessdate = 4 October 2014|website = billboard.com}}</ref> On July 16, 2014 the album was certified [[Gold record|Gold]] by the [[RIAA]] for sales of over 500,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|title = Avenged Sevenfold's 'Hail To The King' Certified Gold In U.S.|url = http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/avenged-sevenfolds-hail-to-the-king-certified-gold-in-u-s/|website = blabbermouth.net|accessdate = August 24, 2014|date = July 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nOn November 15, 2012, vocalist [[M.

We\u2019re looking at blues chords they\u2019re playing most of their stuff in. We\u2019re listening to Zeppelin. We\u2019re going backwards with what we want this record to feel like.

The album also has been compared to bands like [[Iron Maiden]], [[Metallica]], and [[Pantera]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"AEaston\">{{cite web |url=http://hangout.altsounds.com/reviews/161193-review-avenged-sevenfold-hail-king-album.html |title=Review: Avenged Sevenfold \u2013 Hail to the King [Album] |website=altsounds.com |publisher=AEaston |date=August 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824151345/http://hangout.altsounds.com/reviews/161193-review-avenged-sevenfold-hail-king-album.html |archive-date=August 24, 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn a blog post, [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]] frontman [[Robb Flynn]] was also very critical of the album, denouncing it as a mere \"cover album\" and making several jokes about the similarities a selection of songs share with those by [[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]], and [[Guns N' Roses]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/machine-heads-robb-flynn-on-hail-to-the-king-who-knew-that-re-recording-metallica-could-be-such-a-hit|title=Machine Head\u2019s Robb Flynn On \u2018Hail To The King\u2019: Who Knew That Rerecording Metallica Could Be Such A Hit?!|website=Metal Hammer}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/machine-head-robb-flynn-avenged-sevenfold-hail-to-the-king-covers-album/|title=Machine Head's Robb Flynn Calls Avenged Sevenfold's 'Hail to the King' a 'Covers Album'|work=Loudwire|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref> M.

It was released on August 23, 2013 in [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]], and was released on [[iTunes]] on August 27, 2013 and in North America on the same day. The album was produced by [[Mike Elizondo]]. ''Hail to the King'' is the only Avenged Sevenfold album to feature drummer Arin Ilejay, prior to his departure in July 2015. It is also the first Avenged Sevenfold album without musical contributions from Ilejay's late predecessor, [[The Rev|Jimmy \"The Rev\" Sullivan]]; the bonus track, \"St. James\", was written in his memory.\n\nThe album was a commercial and critical success, reaching number 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. This marks Avenged Sevenfold's second album to top the ''Billboard'' chart (the first being ''[[Nightmare (Avenged Sevenfold album)|Nightmare]]''), as well as their first to reach number 1 in the UK, topping the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It also topped the Canadian, Brazilian, Finnish and Irish album charts. Also, the album spawned two number 1 singles on Billboard's Mainstream Rock, Hail to the King, and Shepherd of Fire. The former spent 11 weeks on the top of the chart.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.billboard.com/artist/280315/avenged-sevenfold/chart?f=376|title = Avenged Sevenfold|publisher = Nielsen Inc.|accessdate = 4 October 2014|website = billboard.com}}</ref> On July 16, 2014 the album was certified [[Gold record|Gold]] by the [[RIAA]] for sales of over 500,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|title = Avenged Sevenfold's 'Hail To The King' Certified Gold In U.S.|url = http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/avenged-sevenfolds-hail-to-the-king-certified-gold-in-u-s/|website = blabbermouth.net|accessdate = August 24, 2014|date = July 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nOn November 15, 2012, vocalist [[M.

In an interview with ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' about the new album, M.

I\u2019m pretty sure that we\u2019re looking to go overseas first, so you guys will be seeing it before everyone else... We\u2019re going back to Sabbath stuff.

It is the southernmost part of Italy and Italy's southernmost island. [[Tunisia]], which is about {{convert|113|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} away, is the closest landfall to the islands. Sicily is farther at {{convert|205|km|mi|0|abbr=off}}, whilst the island nation of [[Malta]] is {{convert|176|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} to the east.<ref name=\"timesofmalta2011-07-17\"/>\n\nLampedusa has an area of {{convert|20.2|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=out}} and a population of about 6,000 people. Its main industries are [[fishing]], [[agriculture]], and [[tourism]]. A ferry service links the island with [[Porto Empedocle]], near [[Agrigento]], Sicily. There are also year-round flights from [[Lampedusa Airport]] to [[Palermo Airport|Palermo]] and [[Catania-Fontanarossa Airport|Catania]] on the Sicilian mainland. In the summer, there are additional services to [[Fiumicino Airport|Rome]] and [[Malpensa Airport|Milan]], besides many other seasonal links with the Italian mainland.\n\nSince the early 2000s, the island has become a [[European migrant crisis|primary European entry point for migrants]], mainly coming from Libya.<ref>[http://sievx.com/articles/psdp/2003/20030622JonathanMiller.html Refugee crisis on Lampedusa]</ref> In 2013, Rabbit Beach (it. \"Spiaggia dei Conigli\"), located in the southern part of the island, was voted the world's best beach by travel site [[TripAdvisor]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tripadvisor.com/TravelersChoice-Beaches-g1|title=Tripadvisor's top 25 beaches}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Lampedusa'' derives from the [[ancient Greek]] name of the island, \u039b\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 or \u039b\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 (''Lopado\u00fassa/Lapado\u00fassa''). It has been suggested that the name derives from the word \u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2 (''l\u00e9pas''), which means 'rock', due to the rocky landscape of the island; this word was also used by the [[Greeks]] for a kind of oyster and the island may have been called like this due to the abundance of this kind of oyster. Other scholars believe that the name derives from \u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03ac\u03c2 (''lamp\u00e1s''), which means 'torch', because of the lights which were placed on the island for the sailors.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Lampedusa, Italy |work=Italy This Way |accessdate=16 October 2013 |url=http://www.italythisway.com/places/articles/lampedusa-history.php}}</ref>\n\n==Geology==\n\nLampedusa [[Geography of Italy|geologically]] is part of the \"[[Pelagian Province]]\" ([[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] definition), a structural member of the [[African continent]], lying on a structural high called the ''[[Lampedusa Plateau]]''.

In subsequent centuries, the [[Navy of the Order of Saint John|Hospitaller fleet]] which was based in Malta sometimes used Lampedusa's harbour as a shelter from bad weather or from corsairs.<ref name=\"timesofmalta2013-11-10\"/>\n\nIn 1667, the island was given to Ferdinand Tomasi of Palermo, who acquired the title of [[Prince of Lampedusa]] from King [[Charles II of Spain]].<ref name=\"timesofmalta2013-11-10\"/> Tomasi was the ancestor of the famous writer [[Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa]]. A century after acquiring the island, the Tomasi family began a program of resettlement.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nIn the late 18th century, the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]] maintained a small establishment on Lampedusa, which included a chapel dedicated to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]. This was manned by a priest and six [[Maltese people|Maltese]] men, who often traded with pirates. A structure known as ''marabuto'', probably a mausoleum commemorating a member of the [[Marabout]]s, also existed on the island at this time, and it was visited by many Muslim devotees.<ref name=\"timesofmalta2013-11-10\"/>\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Isola dei Conigli.JPG|thumb|Rabbit Beach in the southern part of the island, ranked many times among the world's most beautiful beaches.<ref>[https://www.lovingsicily.it/en/la-spiaggia-dei-conigli-la-piu-bella-ditalia-la-classifica/ The Rabbits Beach is the most beautiful beach in Italy: here is the ranking]</ref>]]\n\nOn 25 June 1800, Prince Giulio Maria Tomasi leased Lampedusa in perpetual [[emphyteusis]] to Salvatore Gatt, a Maltese merchant, on the condition that the latter would build two [[Coastal defence and fortification|coastal]] [[watchtower]]s at ''Cala della Galere'' and ''Cala della Madonna''. Gatt settled the island with some Maltese workers, and he imported livestock and began cultivating the land. The old castle was reconstructed, and a windmill was also built. Gatt hoisted the British flag for protection. On 27 June 1804, the prince conceded the island to Giuseppe Bugeja, another Maltese, although Gatt remained in control of the island.<ref name=\"timesofmalta2013-11-10\"/>\n\nAt the time, the British were considering taking over Lampedusa, possibly as an alternative to Malta, which had just become a [[Malta Protectorate|British protectorate]]. In 1803, the [[Royal Navy]] dropped the idea since the island's small harbour was not comparable to Malta's larger and well-fortified [[Grand Harbour]]. However, reports stated that the island could be useful in supplying Malta, especially with the threat of Sicily falling to the French.<ref name=\"timesofmalta2013-11-10\"/>\n\nIn 1810, Gatt leased the island to Alexander Fernandez of the Army Commissariat in the Mediterranean, who established a farm with cattle and sheep, and employed 28 workers to turn the island's surface into pasturage. A small detachment of 26 men of the 14th Regiment were sent to the island in 1811 to support Fernandez, who was planning to built a fort on the island. By 1813, the island had a population of almost 200 Maltese workers.<ref name=\"timesofmalta2013-11-10\"/>\n\nA Royal Commission stated in an 1812 report that there would be considerable difficulties in turning the island (together with Linosa and [[Pantelleria]]) into a supply base for Malta. The Commission found Fernandez's situation to be very strange, and the Treasury demanded an explanation of his conduct. In November 1813, the sloop [[HMS Partridge (1809)|HMS ''Partridge'']] was infected with yellow fever, and was sent to Lampedusa until convalescence. This caused most of the population to flee back to Malta, leaving only 50 to 60 people on the island. The Governor of Malta, Sir [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Thomas Maitland]], visited Lampedusa and found that Fernandez was running a business venture, so on 15 September 1814 he announced the withdrawal of British troops stationed on the island. The same notice also stated that \"it is not the intention of [the British] Government to have any further concern or connection with [Lampedusa]\".<ref name=\"timesofmalta2011-07-17\">{{cite news|last1=Zerafa|first1=Thomas|title=When the British planned to make Lampedusa part of the Maltese Islands|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20110717/life-features/When-the-British-planned-to-make-Lampedusa-part-of-the-Maltese-Islands.375992|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=17 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921141731/https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20110717/life-features/When-the-British-planned-to-make-Lampedusa-part-of-the-Maltese-Islands.375992|archivedate=21 September 2017}}</ref> At this point, Greek privateers deposited provisions and took refuge at Lampedusa while being pursued by Tunisian vessels.<ref name=\"timesofmalta2013-11-10\"/>\n\nFernandez had left to [[Gibraltar]] in 1813, but he continued to make claims on his title in Lampedusa. The British Government refused to compensate him in 1818, and Sicilian courts deprived him of his title soon afterwards. The Gatt family retook possession to the island, but what happened in subsequent years is unclear. Salvatore Gatt is believed to have died or disappeared sometime between 1813 and 1821, and the island was taken over by Fortunato Frendo, who had murdered Giacoma Gatt, Salvatore's wife. An official expedition was sent to the island from Naples in 1828, and the island was found to be inhabited by members of the Frendo, Gatt, and Molinos families along with a few workers.<ref name=\"timesofmalta2013-11-10\"/>\n\nA Neapolitan warship visited the island in 1841 as a show of force, but nothing changed until 11 September 1843, when two warships arrived and landed 400 soldiers on the island. They substituted the British flags on the island with Neapolitan flags. A royal decree was read out proclaiming the island as part of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. A few of the Maltese settlers remained on the island, while others returned to Malta or went to Tunisia.<ref name=\"timesofmalta2013-11-10\"/>\n\nIn the 1840s, the Tomasi family formally sold the island to the Kingdom of Naples.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} In 1861, the island became part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]], but the new Italian government limited its activities there to building a [[penal colony]].{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}\n\n===20th century===\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the island was Axis territory, held by a small Italian garrison.  Despite its proximity to Allied-held Malta and North Africa, the island did not see any military engagements until June 1943 when, as a precursor to the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], the island was secured without resistance in [[Operation Corkscrew]] by the [[Royal Navy]] destroyer [[HMS Lookout (G32)|HMS ''Lookout'']] and ninety-five men of the 2nd Battalion the [[Coldstream Guards]].

It is also Italy's southernmost island. Politically and administratively, Lampedusa is part of [[Italy]], but geologically it belongs to [[Africa]] since the sea between the two is no deeper than 120 metres. Lampedusa is a semi-arid island, dominated by a [[garrigue]] landscape, with [[maquis shrubland]] in the west. It has no sources of water other than irregular rainfall. Overall the island has two slopes, from west to east, and from north to south of the island. The south-western side is dominated by deep gorges, while the southeastern part is dominated by shallow valleys and sandy beaches. The entire northern coast is dominated by cliffs: gently sloping cliffs on the east coast, and vertical sheer cliffs on the west coast.\n\n==Wildlife==\n[[File:Lampedusa tortue libre.jpg|thumb|Sea turtle released into Lampedusa waters.]]\nThe fauna and flora of Lampedusa are similar to those of North Africa, with a few [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] [[Endemism|endemic]] species.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The ''Isola dei Conigli'' (literally \"Rabbit Island\"), close to the south coast of Lampedusa, is one of the last remaining egg-laying sites in Italy for the [[Loggerhead Sea Turtle]], which is endangered throughout the [[Mediterranean]]. The beach and the neighbouring island are part of a [[nature reserve]]: here the singer-songwriter [[Domenico Modugno]] spent his vacations, and died in 1994. Next to Parise Cape is a small beach accessible only by sea, through a low [[grotto]].

Sicily is farther at {{convert|205|km|mi|0|abbr=off}}, whilst the island nation of [[Malta]] is {{convert|176|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} to the east.<ref name=\"timesofmalta2011-07-17\"/>\n\nLampedusa has an area of {{convert|20.2|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=out}} and a population of about 6,000 people. Its main industries are [[fishing]], [[agriculture]], and [[tourism]]. A ferry service links the island with [[Porto Empedocle]], near [[Agrigento]], Sicily. There are also year-round flights from [[Lampedusa Airport]] to [[Palermo Airport|Palermo]] and [[Catania-Fontanarossa Airport|Catania]] on the Sicilian mainland. In the summer, there are additional services to [[Fiumicino Airport|Rome]] and [[Malpensa Airport|Milan]], besides many other seasonal links with the Italian mainland.\n\nSince the early 2000s, the island has become a [[European migrant crisis|primary European entry point for migrants]], mainly coming from Libya.<ref>[http://sievx.com/articles/psdp/2003/20030622JonathanMiller.html Refugee crisis on Lampedusa]</ref> In 2013, Rabbit Beach (it. \"Spiaggia dei Conigli\"), located in the southern part of the island, was voted the world's best beach by travel site [[TripAdvisor]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tripadvisor.com/TravelersChoice-Beaches-g1|title=Tripadvisor's top 25 beaches}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Lampedusa'' derives from the [[ancient Greek]] name of the island, \u039b\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 or \u039b\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 (''Lopado\u00fassa/Lapado\u00fassa''). It has been suggested that the name derives from the word \u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2 (''l\u00e9pas''), which means 'rock', due to the rocky landscape of the island; this word was also used by the [[Greeks]] for a kind of oyster and the island may have been called like this due to the abundance of this kind of oyster. Other scholars believe that the name derives from \u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03ac\u03c2 (''lamp\u00e1s''), which means 'torch', because of the lights which were placed on the island for the sailors.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Lampedusa, Italy |work=Italy This Way |accessdate=16 October 2013 |url=http://www.italythisway.com/places/articles/lampedusa-history.php}}</ref>\n\n==Geology==\n\nLampedusa [[Geography of Italy|geologically]] is part of the \"[[Pelagian Province]]\" ([[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] definition), a structural member of the [[African continent]], lying on a structural high called the ''[[Lampedusa Plateau]]''.

In subsequent centuries, the [[Navy of the Order of Saint John|Hospitaller fleet]] which was based in Malta sometimes used Lampedusa's harbour as a shelter from bad weather or from corsairs.<ref name=\"timesofmalta2013-11-10\"/>\n\nIn 1667, the island was given to Ferdinand Tomasi of Palermo, who acquired the title of [[Prince of Lampedusa]] from King [[Charles II of Spain]].<ref name=\"timesofmalta2013-11-10\"/> Tomasi was the ancestor of the famous writer [[Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa]]. A century after acquiring the island, the Tomasi family began a program of resettlement.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nIn the late 18th century, the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]] maintained a small establishment on Lampedusa, which included a chapel dedicated to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]. This was manned by a priest and six [[Maltese people|Maltese]] men, who often traded with pirates. A structure known as ''marabuto'', probably a mausoleum commemorating a member of the [[Marabout]]s, also existed on the island at this time, and it was visited by many Muslim devotees.<ref name=\"timesofmalta2013-11-10\"/>\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Isola dei Conigli.JPG|thumb|Rabbit Beach in the southern part of the island, ranked many times among the world's most beautiful beaches.<ref>[https://www.lovingsicily.it/en/la-spiaggia-dei-conigli-la-piu-bella-ditalia-la-classifica/ The Rabbits Beach is the most beautiful beach in Italy: here is the ranking]</ref>]]\n\nOn 25 June 1800, Prince Giulio Maria Tomasi leased Lampedusa in perpetual [[emphyteusis]] to Salvatore Gatt, a Maltese merchant, on the condition that the latter would build two [[Coastal defence and fortification|coastal]] [[watchtower]]s at ''Cala della Galere'' and ''Cala della Madonna''. Gatt settled the island with some Maltese workers, and he imported livestock and began cultivating the land. The old castle was reconstructed, and a windmill was also built. Gatt hoisted the British flag for protection. On 27 June 1804, the prince conceded the island to Giuseppe Bugeja, another Maltese, although Gatt remained in control of the island.<ref name=\"timesofmalta2013-11-10\"/>\n\nAt the time, the British were considering taking over Lampedusa, possibly as an alternative to Malta, which had just become a [[Malta Protectorate|British protectorate]]. In 1803, the [[Royal Navy]] dropped the idea since the island's small harbour was not comparable to Malta's larger and well-fortified [[Grand Harbour]]. However, reports stated that the island could be useful in supplying Malta, especially with the threat of Sicily falling to the French.<ref name=\"timesofmalta2013-11-10\"/>\n\nIn 1810, Gatt leased the island to Alexander Fernandez of the Army Commissariat in the Mediterranean, who established a farm with cattle and sheep, and employed 28 workers to turn the island's surface into pasturage. A small detachment of 26 men of the 14th Regiment were sent to the island in 1811 to support Fernandez, who was planning to built a fort on the island. By 1813, the island had a population of almost 200 Maltese workers.<ref name=\"timesofmalta2013-11-10\"/>\n\nA Royal Commission stated in an 1812 report that there would be considerable difficulties in turning the island (together with Linosa and [[Pantelleria]]) into a supply base for Malta. The Commission found Fernandez's situation to be very strange, and the Treasury demanded an explanation of his conduct. In November 1813, the sloop [[HMS Partridge (1809)|HMS ''Partridge'']] was infected with yellow fever, and was sent to Lampedusa until convalescence. This caused most of the population to flee back to Malta, leaving only 50 to 60 people on the island. The Governor of Malta, Sir [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Thomas Maitland]], visited Lampedusa and found that Fernandez was running a business venture, so on 15 September 1814 he announced the withdrawal of British troops stationed on the island. The same notice also stated that \"it is not the intention of [the British] Government to have any further concern or connection with [Lampedusa]\".<ref name=\"timesofmalta2011-07-17\">{{cite news|last1=Zerafa|first1=Thomas|title=When the British planned to make Lampedusa part of the Maltese Islands|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20110717/life-features/When-the-British-planned-to-make-Lampedusa-part-of-the-Maltese-Islands.375992|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=17 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921141731/https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20110717/life-features/When-the-British-planned-to-make-Lampedusa-part-of-the-Maltese-Islands.375992|archivedate=21 September 2017}}</ref> At this point, Greek privateers deposited provisions and took refuge at Lampedusa while being pursued by Tunisian vessels.<ref name=\"timesofmalta2013-11-10\"/>\n\nFernandez had left to [[Gibraltar]] in 1813, but he continued to make claims on his title in Lampedusa. The British Government refused to compensate him in 1818, and Sicilian courts deprived him of his title soon afterwards. The Gatt family retook possession to the island, but what happened in subsequent years is unclear. Salvatore Gatt is believed to have died or disappeared sometime between 1813 and 1821, and the island was taken over by Fortunato Frendo, who had murdered Giacoma Gatt, Salvatore's wife. An official expedition was sent to the island from Naples in 1828, and the island was found to be inhabited by members of the Frendo, Gatt, and Molinos families along with a few workers.<ref name=\"timesofmalta2013-11-10\"/>\n\nA Neapolitan warship visited the island in 1841 as a show of force, but nothing changed until 11 September 1843, when two warships arrived and landed 400 soldiers on the island. They substituted the British flags on the island with Neapolitan flags. A royal decree was read out proclaiming the island as part of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. A few of the Maltese settlers remained on the island, while others returned to Malta or went to Tunisia.<ref name=\"timesofmalta2013-11-10\"/>\n\nIn the 1840s, the Tomasi family formally sold the island to the Kingdom of Naples.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} In 1861, the island became part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]], but the new Italian government limited its activities there to building a [[penal colony]].{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}\n\n===20th century===\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the island was Axis territory, held by a small Italian garrison.  Despite its proximity to Allied-held Malta and North Africa, the island did not see any military engagements until June 1943 when, as a precursor to the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], the island was secured without resistance in [[Operation Corkscrew]] by the [[Royal Navy]] destroyer [[HMS Lookout (G32)|HMS ''Lookout'']] and ninety-five men of the 2nd Battalion the [[Coldstream Guards]].

It is also Italy's southernmost island. Politically and administratively, Lampedusa is part of [[Italy]], but geologically it belongs to [[Africa]] since the sea between the two is no deeper than 120 metres. Lampedusa is a semi-arid island, dominated by a [[garrigue]] landscape, with [[maquis shrubland]] in the west. It has no sources of water other than irregular rainfall. Overall the island has two slopes, from west to east, and from north to south of the island. The south-western side is dominated by deep gorges, while the southeastern part is dominated by shallow valleys and sandy beaches. The entire northern coast is dominated by cliffs: gently sloping cliffs on the east coast, and vertical sheer cliffs on the west coast.\n\n==Wildlife==\n[[File:Lampedusa tortue libre.jpg|thumb|Sea turtle released into Lampedusa waters.]]\nThe fauna and flora of Lampedusa are similar to those of North Africa, with a few [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] [[Endemism|endemic]] species.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The ''Isola dei Conigli'' (literally \"Rabbit Island\"), close to the south coast of Lampedusa, is one of the last remaining egg-laying sites in Italy for the [[Loggerhead Sea Turtle]], which is endangered throughout the [[Mediterranean]]. The beach and the neighbouring island are part of a [[nature reserve]]: here the singer-songwriter [[Domenico Modugno]] spent his vacations, and died in 1994. Next to Parise Cape is a small beach accessible only by sea, through a low [[grotto]]. Other species living along the island's coast include mantas and smaller cetaceans such as [[dolphin]]s and [[Risso's dolphin]]s.<ref>esplorasicilia. 2010, [https://www.flickr.com/photos/esplorasicilia/5101744261/ Balene a Lampedusa] on Flickr</ref> Waters nearby Lampedusa are the only area in the Mediterranean with sightings of pregnant [[great white shark]]s and newly born individuals.<ref>[http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/679179/Monsters-in-the-Med-Huge-great-whites-found-in-safe-seas-of-European-holiday-hotspots Monsters in the Med: Huge great whites found in 'safe seas' of European holiday hotspots]</ref> Recent studies revealed that the waters of Lampedusa are a wintering feeding ground for the Mediterranean group of [[fin whale]]s.<ref>[http://www.sanctuaire-pelagos.org/en/home/67-anglais/news/444-fin-hales-route-strait-sicily-pelagos-sanctuary Revealed north-south fin whales route across the Mediterranean, from Strait of Sicily to PELAGOS SANCTUARY]</ref><ref>[http://www.tethys.org/tethys/lampedusa2015/ Fin whale satellite tracking 2015: the Mediterranean migration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425202951/http://www.tethys.org/tethys/lampedusa2015/ |date=2016-04-25 }}</ref> [[Humpback whale]], a species used to be considered as a vagrant species in to the Mediterranean basin, has been seen around the island in recent years.<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261530754_Are_humpback_whales_electing_the_Mediterranean_Sea_as_new_residence Are humpback whales electing the Mediterranean Sea as new residence?]</ref>\n\nAlong with [[Linosa]], Lampedusa once was a stronghold for critically endangered [[Mediterranean monk seal]]s until 1950s and they are likely to be regional extinct today.<ref>[http://www.monachus-guardian.org/mguard14/1415mednew.htm A brief survey of Linosa island]</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nLampedusa has a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BSh'').

At the end of every episode, there is live music from (usually) new and up-and-coming bands. Internationally famous acts have also appeared, like The Zombies and Tim Booth.\n\nUntil the 6th season, Evgenia Samara or Christina Moustaka would be presenting funny videos found online or created by fans of the show, after the end of \"Top of the week\".\n\nStarting with the 7th season, in which only one episode was airing per week, sketches have been incorporated into the format of the show. Besides the hosts, Kostas, the floor manager, and Stathis, a cameraman, make usual appearances in those sketches. Kostas (referred to as Kostakis) and Stathis (referred to as Pasoktsis) have been a part of some of the show's inside jokes for a while.\n\nAn invaluable and much loved member of the group was Sardela, Stathis' dog. She would come along to every taping and could be seen walking around the set. She passed away after the end of season 8.

Afterwards, the \"Top of the week\" (\"Top \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2\") segment begins, where videos from various events that occurred are shown, categorized into (usually 25) numbers, for which there are satirical videos (comic skits, parodies etc.) that make fun of the original videos that were presented earlier. At the end of every episode, there is live music from (usually) new and up-and-coming bands. Internationally famous acts have also appeared, like The Zombies and Tim Booth.\n\nUntil the 6th season, Evgenia Samara or Christina Moustaka would be presenting funny videos found online or created by fans of the show, after the end of \"Top of the week\".\n\nStarting with the 7th season, in which only one episode was airing per week, sketches have been incorporated into the format of the show. Besides the hosts, Kostas, the floor manager, and Stathis, a cameraman, make usual appearances in those sketches. Kostas (referred to as Kostakis) and Stathis (referred to as Pasoktsis) have been a part of some of the show's inside jokes for a while.\n\nAn invaluable and much loved member of the group was Sardela, Stathis' dog. She would come along to every taping and could be seen walking around the set. She passed away after the end of season 8. The hosts paid tribute to her on the first episode of season 9.\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px; width:5%;\" rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px; width:20%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Episodes\n! style=\"padding:0 80px; width:75%;\" colspan=\"2\"| Originally aired\n|-\n!

While varying in details from league to league, the rules of indoor football are designed to allow for play in a smaller arena. It is a distinct discipline and not be confused with traditional American/Canadian football played in larger domed or open-air stadiums, as is done by some teams at the college and professional levels.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe first documented indoor football games were those played at the [[Chicago Coliseum]] in the late 1890s.

The match was \"the first collegiate game of football played under a roof.\"<ref name=Roof>{{cite news|title=CHICAGO WINS BY A POINT: University Team Defeats Michigan for the First Time; INDOOR PLAY PROVES A SUCCESS; Coliseum Utilized and Twenty Thousand In Attendance\u2014Herschberger of the Home Eleven Kicks His Way Into Fame|newspaper=Nebraska State Journal|date=November 27, 1896}}</ref><ref name=NYT>{{cite news|title=Football Played Indoors|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 27, 1896}}</ref> Adding to the novelty, as daylight turned to darkness, the field inside the Coliseum was lit with electric lighting.<ref name=Indoor/> With seven acres of floor space, the sprawling Coliseum is believed to have not needed any compromises to accommodate an American football field. According to a newspaper account, the field grew dark in the second half, and play was halted for ten minutes to discuss whether play should continue. Play was resumed, and the lights were finally turned on after Michigan scored a touchdown.<ref name=Roof/> The press proclaimed the experiment in indoor football to be a success:\n\n<blockquote>One thing at least was settled by the game, and that is, that indoor football is literally and figuratively speaking a howling success. The men had no trouble in catching punts, and football was played on its merits, without the handicaps of a wet field or a strong wind. Toward the end of the second half it got very dark, and the spectators were treated to a novelty in the shape of football by electric light.\"<ref name=Indoor>{{cite news|title=THE FOOTBALL GAMES: Results on the Gridiron From Ocean to Ocean; INDOOR GAME AT CHICAGO; The University of Chicago Defeats the University of Michigan In a Hard Contest \u2014 Games Played at Other Points|newspaper=Delphos Daily Herald|date=November 27, 1896}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough both critically and commercially successful, the Coliseum was destroyed in a fire less than two years after its opening, and its replacement could not accommodate an American football field.\n\nLater, at [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]] in 1902 and 1903, there were games known as the \"[[World Series of Football (1902)|World Series of Pro Football]].\" The games were played on a 70-yard by 35-yard dirt field but otherwise adhered to outdoor rules.

In the 1960s the [[Boardwalk Bowl]], a post-season game involving small college teams, was contested at the convention center. The Bowl was an attempt to make [[Atlantic City]] more of a year-round resort in the pre-gambling era as opposed to a single-season one (the [[Miss America Pageant]], also held at the center, likewise began as an attempt to extend the season beyond Labor Day). The [[Atlantic Coast Football League]] played its inaugural championship game at the convention center in 1962, but the game only drew 2,000 fans and the game would thereafter move to the home stadium of the team with the best regular season record. The [[Philadelphia]]-based [[Liberty Bowl]] game, which had been played at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|Municipal Stadium]] from 1959&ndash;1963, was moved into the Convention Center in 1964 for the contest between [[Utah Utes football|Utah]] and [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]]. The game drew just over 6,000 fans, though, and the Liberty Bowl moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] the next year, where it has remained.\n\nUnlike modern indoor football, the size of the playing surface and hence the rules were essentially the same as in the standard outdoor game, with rules updated to deal with contingencies for what could happen indoors, such as a punt striking the ceiling. The end zones were slightly shorter\u2014eight yards instead of the standard ten (coincidentally, the eight-yard endzone length is the standard in modern indoor football).\n\n===Arena Football League===\n{{main|Arena football|Arena Football League}}\n[[File:AFL goalpost.jpg|thumb|An [[arena football]] goalpost structure featuring the rebound nets on either side of the uprights.]]\nWhile several attempts to create a true indoor football game have been made since shortly after American football was developed, the first version to meet with relatively widespread success and acceptance is [[Arena football]], devised by [[Jim Foster (football)|Jim Foster]], a former executive of the [[United States Football League]] and the [[National Football League]]. He devised his game while watching [[indoor soccer]],{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} another game derived from a sport played outdoors. He worked on the game in the early 1980s, but put any plans for full development of it on hold while the [[United States Football League]], an attempt to play traditional American football in a non-traditional (spring-summer) season, was in operation in 1983\u20131985. When the USFL ceased operations, Foster saw his opportunity. He staged a \"test\" game in [[Rockford, Illinois]] in 1986 and put together a four-team league for a \"demonstration season\" in the spring of 1987, with games televised on [[ESPN]].\n\nFoster had to adopt a field that would fit within the smaller playing surfaces found in most [[arena]]s and thus created a field that was identical in size to a standard professional [[ice hockey]] rink, {{convert|200|x|85|ft}}. This resulted in the field being 50 yards long (half of the length of a standard American football field) with eight-yard end zones (which may, if necessary, be curved in the end zones as hockey rinks are), and the field being slightly over half as wide as a standard football field. Although it was not as much of an issue then as it is now, Foster adopted short-pile [[artificial turf|artificial turfs]] (which were then standard) such as [[AstroTurf]] for the field, because of its ability to be rolled up when the arena is being used for other sports.\n\nFoster adopted a modified version of [[eight-man football]]. He also mandated a [[one-platoon system]] that required at least six players to play on both offensive and defensive downs. This had the added desirable effect of limiting team payrolls.\n\nThere were numerous other rules designed to help the offense and ensure high-scoring games:\n*[[Punt (gridiron football)|punting]] is banned; a team not likely to get a first down may only attempt a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]].\n*the placing of taut rebound nets at the ends of the playing surface alongside the goalposts. Kicked and passed balls bouncing off these nets remain in play. In the case of a pass, the ball is live only until it touches the ground, allowing for receptions and interceptions on the rebound. On an unsuccessful field goal attempt or kickoff, the ball remains in play unless it goes out of bounds or until the player recovering it is downed by contact or scores, so on kicking plays (except an extra point attempt) either team may attempt to gain possession of the ball and advance it, much as a blocked kick could be in the traditional outdoor game. Only kicked or passed balls touching the slack nets behind the goalposts are ruled dead at that point.\n\nTo further an offensive passing advantage over the defense, Foster also imposed strict restrictions on the defensive formation, mandating that all defenses were required to play a [[Eight-man football defensive formations#3-2-3|3-2-Monster formation]] with three defensive linemen, two linebackers, two cornerbacks, and one safety. Linebackers were not permitted to blitz and were required to stay in boxes behind the line of scrimmage, while defensive linemen where hindered by restrictions that prevented them from using certain techniques to penetrate the offensive line. [[Quarterback]]s and [[placekicker]]s were exempt from the one-platoon system, allowing two key scoring positions to be more specialized. The AFL also adopted the USFL's concept of playing in the late spring and summer, since this is when most hockey and basketball arenas have the fewest schedule conflicts (only competing with touring [[stadium rock]] concerts). The spring schedule has since been imitated by virtually all other professional indoor leagues as of 2010.\n\nWithin a year of the AFL kicking off, its first challenger, the [[World Indoor Football League]] formed. The WIFL planned to play a schedule with six teams beginning in summer of 1988 with its own set of indoor-inspired rules, including an unusual system that would have eight men on offense and seven men on defense. Despite having backing from former NFL players, veteran coaches, and singer [[John Mellencamp]], the league canceled its 1988 season, folded half of its franchises (including Mellencamp's), and made an unsuccessful bid for the remaining three teams to join the AFL.\n\nIn 1990, Foster patented the rules of Arena football, meaning that only persons authorized by him could use his rules and his name for the sport. While the AFL asserted throughout the 1990s that the patent covered virtually every aspect of the game (from the 50-yard field to the eight-man format), a 1998 lawsuit (''Arena Football League v. [[Professional Indoor Football League (1998)|Professional Indoor Football League]]'') established that the patent specifically covered the rebound net feature, meaning that competitors and imitators who attempted to copy the game could not use this aspect of the rules.<ref>{{US patent|4911443}} (filed September 30, 1987; parent application filed December 4, 1985; issued March 27, 1990)</ref> However, under [[term of patent in the United States|provisions of U.S. patent law]], Foster's patent expired on March 27, 2007, enabling imitators to use his rebound nets (at least as originally envisioned, without other innovations that he may have patented).<!--Under US patent law, patents that were in force on June 8, 1995 have a term of 17 years from the issue date or 20 years from the oldest non-provisional application in its filing chain, whichever was longer. Since the patent was a continuation-in-part of a non-provisional application filed on December 4, 1985, the 20-year term is counted from that date, thus expiring December 4, 2005. Since the 17-year anniversary of the issue date, March 27, 2007, is after the end of the 20-year term, it governs.-->\n\nThe AFL signed a major network television broadcasting contract with [[NBC]], and eventually launched an official [[minor league]], [[af2]], beginning in 2000. This effort basically served two purposes: one as a developmental league for the AFL, and as a place where former collegiate players could develop while at the same time learning and becoming accustomed to the unique arena rules, and secondly as a pre-emptive way of shutting out potential new indoor football competitors (this was especially important as the 2007 expiration of Foster's patent on the rebound nets approached). At times over forty teams participated in this league, almost uniformly in cities which also had minor league ice hockey teams and hence suitable arenas.\n\nShortly before the end of 2008, the [[Arena Football League]] announced that it would not be playing a 2009 spring season. During the previous few years, the league administrators and team owners had allowed player salaries and other costs to rise to the point where the league and many of the teams were losing a substantial amount of money. Late in the summer of 2009, with the team owners unable to agree on a plan for making the league viable again the AFL announced that it was folding, eventually putting its assets up in a [[Chapter 7 bankruptcy]] liquidation. \n\nThe developmental af2, however, played its 2009 season as scheduled. Most of the teams made a sustainable profit and the team owners were eager to see the league continue for another year. However, with the AFL owning 50.1% of the af2, it would fold if the AFL folded. At the end of the 2009 season, a gathering of af2 and remaining AFL team owners set out to form their own organization, originally known as Arena Football 1 (AF1). AF1 went on to purchase all assets of the original AFL and af2, except for a few team names and logos owned by outside parties, in a December 2009 bankruptcy auction. Shortly after the purchase, AF1 adopted the Arena Football League name, and the AFL relaunched in [[2010 Arena Football League season|2010]]. The \"iron man\" rule, requiring at least six of the eight players to play on both offense and defense, was dropped, but most other past AFL rules remained unchanged. The relaunched league saw franchises return and renewed interest, but by the end of the 2017 season, almost all of the league's teams had either folded or moved to other leagues, with only the [[Philadelphia Soul]] having existed prior to 2016. Five expansion teams, all in the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic United States]], were established over the next two years, before the league announced after the 2019 season that it was dissolving in a second Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n\n===Other indoor leagues===\n[[File:New England Surge.jpg|thumb|upright|An example of an indoor football field, lacking rebound nets.]]\nOther indoor football leagues have been formed, without the use of the rebound nets at the ends of the field. Like the AFL, their playing seasons are entirely or primarily outside the traditional fall/early winter season of the outdoor sport so as not to be competing with it directly for fan support.\n\nSince the first such league, the Professional Indoor Football League, began play in the 1998, there has often been a pattern of instability. Each off-season has seen teams jumping from league to league. In addition, leagues have annually merged, changed names, and separated. The organization that was most recently known as [[American Indoor Football]] (AIF) went through three names and two ownership changes in its first three seasons. Several other indoor leagues have been announced without ever actually commencing play, or operating only briefly with a handful of teams. Some were claimed attempts to form a second \"major\" league of indoor football while others were strictly efforts to form a new \"minor\" league.\n\nA few leagues have achieved a certain level of stability, however. The [[National Indoor Football League]] {NIFL) began in 2001 and was the most successful league in the early 2000's. The [[Indoor Football League]] (IFL) began in the autumn of 2008 when two already-established leagues (the [[Intense Football League]] and [[United Indoor Football]]) chose to merge into a single organization. The IFL's expansion model has been based less on establishing new teams and more on acquiring existing teams from other leagues. The IFL has 10 teams as of 2019. Other, regional leagues include [[Champions Indoor Football]] (CIF), the [[American Arena League]] (AAL) and [[National Arena League]] (NAL). Both CIF and the AAL were formed by mergers of existing leagues. The CIF was formed from a merger of the [[Champions Professional Indoor Football League]] and the [[Lone Star Football League]] in 2015. The AAL was formed in late 2017 as the combination of three leagues that each played one season: the [[Can-Am Indoor Football League]], [[Arena Pro Football]], and [[Supreme Indoor Football]].\n\nThe best-known indoor [[women's American football|women's football league]] is the [[Legends Football League]] (formerly known as the Lingerie Football League). Known for its scantily-clad players and its signature event, the [[Legends Cup (LFL)|Legends Cup]] (formerly Lingerie Bowl), the LFL played a variant of indoor rules with most of its games in indoor stadiums, although few teams experimented with playing in outdoor stadiums. The league's brief foray into Australia was played in outdoor stadiums; these teams nevertheless played under indoor football rules. All other women's leagues play on outdoor fields with outdoor rules; there have been several other attempts to form indoor women's football leagues, but none have made it to play.\n\n==Compensation==\nAll current indoor football teams play at a [[minor league]] or [[semi-professional]] level. The average player's salary in the Arena Football League was US$1,800 per game in 2008; this is about one-quarter of the [[Canadian Football League]] and the [[XFL (2001)|XFL]] (adjusted for inflation) and half the salary the [[United Football League (2009\u20132012)|United Football League]] was paying at the end of its lifespan in 2012. Players in af2 were paid $250 per game and the AIFA and IFL had per-game salaries of $200 per game; the AFL paid $885 per game for most players in 2012, with that number rising to $940 per game in 2013 (although players then had to pay for their own housing, which the league previously provided); starting quarterbacks receive a $300 per game bonus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://triblive.com/sports/power/2049806-85/per-players-season-cba-game-starting-bonuses-increase-player-afl |title=AFL players score hefty raise in new CBA |publisher= [[Trib Total Media]] |date=June 19, 2012 | first= Jerry |last= DiPaola |accessdate= 2014-03-18}}</ref> As of 2019, the IFL pays $200-$300 per game, with a $25 bonus for each win.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://recruit.thepodyum.com/articles/329-indoor-football-league-ifl|title=Podyum Recruit {{!}} The Pro Football Recruiting Platform|website=recruit.thepodyum.com|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\n==Connection to the NFL==\nRunning back [[Fred Jackson (American football)|Fred Jackson]] rushed for over 1,000 yards as the starting running back for the 2009 [[Buffalo Bills]], and his high quality play earned him a spot on ''[[USA Today]]'''s \"All-Joe\" Team. Jackson played the early part of his professional football career for the [[Sioux City Bandits]] (now of [[Champions Indoor Football]]) and [[Michael Lewis (wide receiver)]] played for the [[Louisiana Bayou Beast]] in 1999 and then with the [[New Orleans Saints]]. Probably the most notable player to come out of Arena football into the National Football League is [[Kurt Warner]], [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] quarterback of the [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] champion (2000 game, 1999 season) [[St. Louis Rams]], who had previously quarterbacked the former [[New York Dragons|Iowa Barnstormers]] of the AFL.  The National Football League removed a ban that had been in place on any of its owners owning teams in any other sort of football operation with respect to Arena football only, and several of them had bought or started Arena teams at one point. However, the NFL allowed to lapse an option it had negotiated allowing it to purchase up to 49% of Arena football, and as of early 2007 seemed to have backed away from any plan it may have had to use Arena football as a developmental league in any sort of \"official\" sense, perhaps in the interest of not undermining its then-existing \"official\" developmental league, [[NFL Europa]].\n\nSeveral NFL owners owned Arena Football League teams in their own cities prior to the league's bankruptcy. At the end of the 2008 season, [[Jerry Jones]] and the [[Dallas Desperados]] (who had similar colors and logos to the [[Dallas Cowboys]]), [[Arthur Blank]]'s [[Georgia Force]], and the  [[Colorado Crush]] (whose shareholders included Broncos owner [[Pat Bowlen]] and Rams then-minority owner [[Stan Kroenke]]) were still in the league. San Francisco 49ers owner [[Denise DeBartolo York]] and Washington Redskins owner [[Daniel Snyder]] had future expansion rights to their respective cities.  [[Tom Benson]]'s original [[New Orleans VooDoo]] and [[Bud Adams]]'s [[Nashville Kats]] had already folded prior to the bankruptcy and none of the NFL owners with AFL franchises returned to the league after its reformation in 2010, and most favored abolishing the league entirely.<ref>Hahn, John (2009-08-11).

The first such game matched [[1896 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] against [[1896 Chicago Maroons football team|Chicago]] on Thanksgiving Day 1896. The match was \"the first collegiate game of football played under a roof.\"<ref name=Roof>{{cite news|title=CHICAGO WINS BY A POINT: University Team Defeats Michigan for the First Time; INDOOR PLAY PROVES A SUCCESS; Coliseum Utilized and Twenty Thousand In Attendance\u2014Herschberger of the Home Eleven Kicks His Way Into Fame|newspaper=Nebraska State Journal|date=November 27, 1896}}</ref><ref name=NYT>{{cite news|title=Football Played Indoors|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 27, 1896}}</ref> Adding to the novelty, as daylight turned to darkness, the field inside the Coliseum was lit with electric lighting.<ref name=Indoor/> With seven acres of floor space, the sprawling Coliseum is believed to have not needed any compromises to accommodate an American football field. According to a newspaper account, the field grew dark in the second half, and play was halted for ten minutes to discuss whether play should continue.

The men had no trouble in catching punts, and football was played on its merits, without the handicaps of a wet field or a strong wind.

In the 1960s the [[Boardwalk Bowl]], a post-season game involving small college teams, was contested at the convention center. The Bowl was an attempt to make [[Atlantic City]] more of a year-round resort in the pre-gambling era as opposed to a single-season one (the [[Miss America Pageant]], also held at the center, likewise began as an attempt to extend the season beyond Labor Day). The [[Atlantic Coast Football League]] played its inaugural championship game at the convention center in 1962, but the game only drew 2,000 fans and the game would thereafter move to the home stadium of the team with the best regular season record. The [[Philadelphia]]-based [[Liberty Bowl]] game, which had been played at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|Municipal Stadium]] from 1959&ndash;1963, was moved into the Convention Center in 1964 for the contest between [[Utah Utes football|Utah]] and [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]]. The game drew just over 6,000 fans, though, and the Liberty Bowl moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] the next year, where it has remained.\n\nUnlike modern indoor football, the size of the playing surface and hence the rules were essentially the same as in the standard outdoor game, with rules updated to deal with contingencies for what could happen indoors, such as a punt striking the ceiling. The end zones were slightly shorter\u2014eight yards instead of the standard ten (coincidentally, the eight-yard endzone length is the standard in modern indoor football).\n\n===Arena Football League===\n{{main|Arena football|Arena Football League}}\n[[File:AFL goalpost.jpg|thumb|An [[arena football]] goalpost structure featuring the rebound nets on either side of the uprights.]]\nWhile several attempts to create a true indoor football game have been made since shortly after American football was developed, the first version to meet with relatively widespread success and acceptance is [[Arena football]], devised by [[Jim Foster (football)|Jim Foster]], a former executive of the [[United States Football League]] and the [[National Football League]]. He devised his game while watching [[indoor soccer]],{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} another game derived from a sport played outdoors. He worked on the game in the early 1980s, but put any plans for full development of it on hold while the [[United States Football League]], an attempt to play traditional American football in a non-traditional (spring-summer) season, was in operation in 1983\u20131985. When the USFL ceased operations, Foster saw his opportunity. He staged a \"test\" game in [[Rockford, Illinois]] in 1986 and put together a four-team league for a \"demonstration season\" in the spring of 1987, with games televised on [[ESPN]].\n\nFoster had to adopt a field that would fit within the smaller playing surfaces found in most [[arena]]s and thus created a field that was identical in size to a standard professional [[ice hockey]] rink, {{convert|200|x|85|ft}}. This resulted in the field being 50 yards long (half of the length of a standard American football field) with eight-yard end zones (which may, if necessary, be curved in the end zones as hockey rinks are), and the field being slightly over half as wide as a standard football field. Although it was not as much of an issue then as it is now, Foster adopted short-pile [[artificial turf|artificial turfs]] (which were then standard) such as [[AstroTurf]] for the field, because of its ability to be rolled up when the arena is being used for other sports.\n\nFoster adopted a modified version of [[eight-man football]]. He also mandated a [[one-platoon system]] that required at least six players to play on both offensive and defensive downs. This had the added desirable effect of limiting team payrolls.\n\nThere were numerous other rules designed to help the offense and ensure high-scoring games:\n*[[Punt (gridiron football)|punting]] is banned; a team not likely to get a first down may only attempt a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]].\n*the placing of taut rebound nets at the ends of the playing surface alongside the goalposts. Kicked and passed balls bouncing off these nets remain in play. In the case of a pass, the ball is live only until it touches the ground, allowing for receptions and interceptions on the rebound. On an unsuccessful field goal attempt or kickoff, the ball remains in play unless it goes out of bounds or until the player recovering it is downed by contact or scores, so on kicking plays (except an extra point attempt) either team may attempt to gain possession of the ball and advance it, much as a blocked kick could be in the traditional outdoor game. Only kicked or passed balls touching the slack nets behind the goalposts are ruled dead at that point.\n\nTo further an offensive passing advantage over the defense, Foster also imposed strict restrictions on the defensive formation, mandating that all defenses were required to play a [[Eight-man football defensive formations#3-2-3|3-2-Monster formation]] with three defensive linemen, two linebackers, two cornerbacks, and one safety. Linebackers were not permitted to blitz and were required to stay in boxes behind the line of scrimmage, while defensive linemen where hindered by restrictions that prevented them from using certain techniques to penetrate the offensive line. [[Quarterback]]s and [[placekicker]]s were exempt from the one-platoon system, allowing two key scoring positions to be more specialized. The AFL also adopted the USFL's concept of playing in the late spring and summer, since this is when most hockey and basketball arenas have the fewest schedule conflicts (only competing with touring [[stadium rock]] concerts). The spring schedule has since been imitated by virtually all other professional indoor leagues as of 2010.\n\nWithin a year of the AFL kicking off, its first challenger, the [[World Indoor Football League]] formed. The WIFL planned to play a schedule with six teams beginning in summer of 1988 with its own set of indoor-inspired rules, including an unusual system that would have eight men on offense and seven men on defense. Despite having backing from former NFL players, veteran coaches, and singer [[John Mellencamp]], the league canceled its 1988 season, folded half of its franchises (including Mellencamp's), and made an unsuccessful bid for the remaining three teams to join the AFL.\n\nIn 1990, Foster patented the rules of Arena football, meaning that only persons authorized by him could use his rules and his name for the sport. While the AFL asserted throughout the 1990s that the patent covered virtually every aspect of the game (from the 50-yard field to the eight-man format), a 1998 lawsuit (''Arena Football League v. [[Professional Indoor Football League (1998)|Professional Indoor Football League]]'') established that the patent specifically covered the rebound net feature, meaning that competitors and imitators who attempted to copy the game could not use this aspect of the rules.<ref>{{US patent|4911443}} (filed September 30, 1987; parent application filed December 4, 1985; issued March 27, 1990)</ref> However, under [[term of patent in the United States|provisions of U.S. patent law]], Foster's patent expired on March 27, 2007, enabling imitators to use his rebound nets (at least as originally envisioned, without other innovations that he may have patented).<!--Under US patent law, patents that were in force on June 8, 1995 have a term of 17 years from the issue date or 20 years from the oldest non-provisional application in its filing chain, whichever was longer. Since the patent was a continuation-in-part of a non-provisional application filed on December 4, 1985, the 20-year term is counted from that date, thus expiring December 4, 2005. Since the 17-year anniversary of the issue date, March 27, 2007, is after the end of the 20-year term, it governs.-->\n\nThe AFL signed a major network television broadcasting contract with [[NBC]], and eventually launched an official [[minor league]], [[af2]], beginning in 2000. This effort basically served two purposes: one as a developmental league for the AFL, and as a place where former collegiate players could develop while at the same time learning and becoming accustomed to the unique arena rules, and secondly as a pre-emptive way of shutting out potential new indoor football competitors (this was especially important as the 2007 expiration of Foster's patent on the rebound nets approached). At times over forty teams participated in this league, almost uniformly in cities which also had minor league ice hockey teams and hence suitable arenas.\n\nShortly before the end of 2008, the [[Arena Football League]] announced that it would not be playing a 2009 spring season. During the previous few years, the league administrators and team owners had allowed player salaries and other costs to rise to the point where the league and many of the teams were losing a substantial amount of money. Late in the summer of 2009, with the team owners unable to agree on a plan for making the league viable again the AFL announced that it was folding, eventually putting its assets up in a [[Chapter 7 bankruptcy]] liquidation. \n\nThe developmental af2, however, played its 2009 season as scheduled. Most of the teams made a sustainable profit and the team owners were eager to see the league continue for another year. However, with the AFL owning 50.1% of the af2, it would fold if the AFL folded. At the end of the 2009 season, a gathering of af2 and remaining AFL team owners set out to form their own organization, originally known as Arena Football 1 (AF1). AF1 went on to purchase all assets of the original AFL and af2, except for a few team names and logos owned by outside parties, in a December 2009 bankruptcy auction. Shortly after the purchase, AF1 adopted the Arena Football League name, and the AFL relaunched in [[2010 Arena Football League season|2010]]. The \"iron man\" rule, requiring at least six of the eight players to play on both offense and defense, was dropped, but most other past AFL rules remained unchanged. The relaunched league saw franchises return and renewed interest, but by the end of the 2017 season, almost all of the league's teams had either folded or moved to other leagues, with only the [[Philadelphia Soul]] having existed prior to 2016. Five expansion teams, all in the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic United States]], were established over the next two years, before the league announced after the 2019 season that it was dissolving in a second Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n\n===Other indoor leagues===\n[[File:New England Surge.jpg|thumb|upright|An example of an indoor football field, lacking rebound nets.]]\nOther indoor football leagues have been formed, without the use of the rebound nets at the ends of the field. Like the AFL, their playing seasons are entirely or primarily outside the traditional fall/early winter season of the outdoor sport so as not to be competing with it directly for fan support.\n\nSince the first such league, the Professional Indoor Football League, began play in the 1998, there has often been a pattern of instability. Each off-season has seen teams jumping from league to league. In addition, leagues have annually merged, changed names, and separated. The organization that was most recently known as [[American Indoor Football]] (AIF) went through three names and two ownership changes in its first three seasons. Several other indoor leagues have been announced without ever actually commencing play, or operating only briefly with a handful of teams. Some were claimed attempts to form a second \"major\" league of indoor football while others were strictly efforts to form a new \"minor\" league.\n\nA few leagues have achieved a certain level of stability, however. The [[National Indoor Football League]] began in 2001 and was the most successful league in the early 2000's. The [[Indoor Football League]] (IFL) began in the autumn of 2008 when two already-established leagues (the [[Intense Football League]] and [[United Indoor Football]]) chose to merge into a single organization. The IFL's expansion model has been based less on establishing new teams and more on acquiring existing teams from other leagues. The IFL has 10 teams as of 2019. Other, regional leagues include [[Champions Indoor Football]] (CIF), the [[American Arena League]] (AAL) and [[National Arena League]] (NAL). Both CIF and the AAL were formed by mergers of existing leagues. The CIF was formed from a merger of the [[Champions Professional Indoor Football League]] and the [[Lone Star Football League]] in 2015. The AAL was formed in late 2017 as the combination of three leagues that each played one season: the [[Can-Am Indoor Football League]], [[Arena Pro Football]], and [[Supreme Indoor Football]].\n\nThe best-known indoor [[women's American football|women's football league]] is the [[Legends Football League]] (formerly known as the Lingerie Football League). Known for its scantily-clad players and its signature event, the [[Legends Cup (LFL)|Legends Cup]] (formerly Lingerie Bowl), the LFL played a variant of indoor rules with most of its games in indoor stadiums, although few teams experimented with playing in outdoor stadiums. The league's brief foray into Australia was played in outdoor stadiums; these teams nevertheless played under indoor football rules. All other women's leagues play on outdoor fields with outdoor rules; there have been several other attempts to form indoor women's football leagues, but none have made it to play.\n\n==Compensation==\nAll current indoor football teams play at a [[minor league]] or [[semi-professional]] level. The average player's salary in the Arena Football League was US$1,800 per game in 2008; this is about one-quarter of the [[Canadian Football League]] and the [[XFL (2001)|XFL]] (adjusted for inflation) and half the salary the [[United Football League (2009\u20132012)|United Football League]] was paying at the end of its lifespan in 2012. Players in af2 were paid $250 per game and the AIFA and IFL had per-game salaries of $200 per game; the AFL paid $885 per game for most players in 2012, with that number rising to $940 per game in 2013 (although players then had to pay for their own housing, which the league previously provided); starting quarterbacks receive a $300 per game bonus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://triblive.com/sports/power/2049806-85/per-players-season-cba-game-starting-bonuses-increase-player-afl |title=AFL players score hefty raise in new CBA |publisher= [[Trib Total Media]] |date=June 19, 2012 | first= Jerry |last= DiPaola |accessdate= 2014-03-18}}</ref> As of 2019, the IFL pays $200-$300 per game, with a $25 bonus for each win.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://recruit.thepodyum.com/articles/329-indoor-football-league-ifl|title=Podyum Recruit {{!}} The Pro Football Recruiting Platform|website=recruit.thepodyum.com|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\n==Connection to the NFL==\nRunning back [[Fred Jackson (American football)|Fred Jackson]] rushed for over 1,000 yards as the starting running back for the 2009 [[Buffalo Bills]], and his high quality play earned him a spot on ''[[USA Today]]'''s \"All-Joe\" Team. Jackson played the early part of his professional football career for the [[Sioux City Bandits]] (now of [[Champions Indoor Football]]) and [[Michael Lewis (wide receiver)]] played for the [[Louisiana Bayou Beast]] in 1999 and then with the [[New Orleans Saints]]. Probably the most notable player to come out of Arena football into the National Football League is [[Kurt Warner]], [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] quarterback of the [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] champion (2000 game, 1999 season) [[St. Louis Rams]], who had previously quarterbacked the former [[New York Dragons|Iowa Barnstormers]] of the AFL.  The National Football League removed a ban that had been in place on any of its owners owning teams in any other sort of football operation with respect to Arena football only, and several of them had bought or started Arena teams at one point. However, the NFL allowed to lapse an option it had negotiated allowing it to purchase up to 49% of Arena football, and as of early 2007 seemed to have backed away from any plan it may have had to use Arena football as a developmental league in any sort of \"official\" sense, perhaps in the interest of not undermining its then-existing \"official\" developmental league, [[NFL Europa]].\n\nSeveral NFL owners owned Arena Football League teams in their own cities prior to the league's bankruptcy. At the end of the 2008 season, [[Jerry Jones]] and the [[Dallas Desperados]] (who had similar colors and logos to the [[Dallas Cowboys]]), [[Arthur Blank]]'s [[Georgia Force]], and the  [[Colorado Crush]] (whose shareholders included Broncos owner [[Pat Bowlen]] and Rams then-minority owner [[Stan Kroenke]]) were still in the league. San Francisco 49ers owner [[Denise DeBartolo York]] and Washington Redskins owner [[Daniel Snyder]] had future expansion rights to their respective cities.  [[Tom Benson]]'s original [[New Orleans VooDoo]] and [[Bud Adams]]'s [[Nashville Kats]] had already folded prior to the bankruptcy and none of the NFL owners with AFL franchises returned to the league after its reformation in 2010, and most favored abolishing the league entirely.<ref>Hahn, John (2009-08-11).
