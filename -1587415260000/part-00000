{"title_page": "Madame de Sade", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2011}}\n[[File:MadameDeSade.jpg|thumb|First edition (Japanese)]]\n\n'''''Madame de Sade''''' is a 1965 play written by [[Yukio Mishima]]. It was first published in English, translated by [[Donald Keene]] by Grove Press and is currently out of print.\n\n''Madame de Sade'' is a historical fiction play written by Mishima Yukio and published in 1965. The play is based on the life of Ren\u00e9e de Sade, the wife of the notorious [[Marquis de Sade]].  It details the struggles of Ren\u00e9e, her family, and acquaintances during the Marquis' various periods of incarceration. All the onstage characters are female. After reading about Marquis and Madame de Sade, Mishima questioned why Ren\u00e9e waited until the Marquis was finally let out of prison to leave him.\n\nIn March 2009 London's [[Donmar Warehouse]] staged a production at [[Wyndhams Theatre]] directed by [[Michael Grandage]]. It starred [[Rosamund Pike]] (in the title role) and [[Judi Dench]] as her mother, Madame De Montreuil. [[Frances Barber]], [[Deborah Findlay]], [[Jenny Galloway]] and Fiona Button co-starred.\n\n[[Judi Dench]] was forced to miss several performances after she tripped over the stage-doors and severely sprained her ankle and thus her understudy, Marjorie Hayward, took over the role. When Dench did return four days after the injury, she performed with a walking stick.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7962155.stm</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n\nRENEE, \n\tthe Marquise de Sade\n\nMADAME DE MONTREUIL,\n\tRen\u00e9e's Mother\n\nANNE,\n\tRen\u00e9e's younger sister\n\nBARONESSE DE SIMIANE\n\nCOMTESSE DE SAINT-FOND\n\nCHARLOTTE,\n\tMadame de Montreuil's housekeeper\n\t\n(Madame de Sade, p. iii)\n\nCharacters\n\n\tAccording to Mishima, every character is symbolic of some form of human nature, thus the play functions as an allegory. He describes them as follows. Madame de Sade (Ren\u00e9e) represents wifely devotion; Madame de Montreuil is law, society, and morality, Anne (Ren\u00e9e's younger sister) shows feminine guilelessness and lack of principles; Madame de Simaine for religion; Madame de Saint-Fond for carnal desires, and Charlotte (the house keeper) for the common people.(pg. 107 ''Author's Postface'' Madame de Sade)\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Act one===\nThe first act takes place at the salon in Paris, France at Madame de Montreuil's house, in Autumn of 1772. In this act we are introduced to all the characters and are given a glimpse at their personalities. Act One is also the first and only act where all six characters appear on the stage, (Baronesse de  Simiane is absent from Act Two, and Comtesse de Saint-Fond is absent from Act Three). The scene opens with Simiane and Saint-Fond waiting in the saloon after being summoned by Madame de Montreuil. We soon learn that Montreuil has asked them to her home for a favor. She asks them to use their influences to get her son-in-law, the Marquis de Sade, out of prison. Both ladies pledge their help, Simiane using her influential contacts in the church and Saint-Fond her web of lovers and bed fellows. \n\n\tSoon Renee arrives and we learn that the Marquis has escaped from prison and been on the run for a few months. After a brief discussion the Comtesse and Baronesse excuse themselves, leaving Renee and her mother to discuss the matter of the Marquis. Ren\u00e9e begs her mother to save her husband from imprisonment and the pair get in an argument. Montreuil demands to know the location of the Marquis but Renee denies having any knowledge of his whereabouts. The argument ends when the stress takes its toll on Renee and she grows faint. \n\n\tAs Montreuil and Renee leave the stage, Anne the sister and Charlotte the house keeper enter the scene. Anne appears to be expressing an unwillingness to see her sister to Charlotte right before her mother walks back on stage. Anne reveals that she has just returned from a trip to Venice, Italy with a friend she does not immediately name. Upon further probing by her mother she reveals her travelling companion to be none other than her brother-in-law the Marquis de Sade. Anne then proceeds to tell her mother that she was having an affair with the Marquis and that Renee knew of both the affair and the Marquis' location. \n\n\tAfter stumbling on the news of her son-in-law's infidelity with Anne Montreuil is outraged. After getting Anne to divulge the Marquis' location Montreuil immediately has Charlotte write three letters. The first two are to Comtesse de Saint-Fond and Baronesse de Simiane telling them to cease their endeavors on de Sade's behalf; the third letter is to the King of France. Montreuil prepares to have the letters delivered and Act One ends.\n\n===Act Two===\n\tThe second act takes place six years later in September 1778. Anne and Renee meet onstage and Anne reveals she has a letter. After a light-hearted struggle between the sisters Renee wrestles the letter away from Anne. The letter announces that Marquis de Sade was retried, given a lesser sentence and is to be released from jail, Renee becomes ecstatic. The two women begin to discuss the rift which has developed over the past six years between Ren\u00e9e and their mother and how Renee now sees that her mother has begun helping de Sade once more. \n\n\tThe women then go to their mother and the three of them begin debating the true nature of the Marquis based on their understandings. When Renee begins expressing a desire to return home and prepare the Manor at La Coste for the arrival of her husband, Anne and Montreuil begin exchanging glances. Montreuil persuades Renee to stay with her awhile longer and Renee continues to praise her mother for helping free the Marquis. Montreuil tries to impress upon Renee the need behind behaving morally and in a socially acceptable manor. When Montreuil begins to denounce the Marquis de Sade, Renee and Anne jump to his defense and Anne recounts her trip to Venice. As the women continue to argue Charlotte enters the room and informs them that the Comtesse de Saint-Fond has come to pay a visit. Almost moments after her arrival is announced Saint-Fond enters the room. \n\n\tThe Comtesse Saint-Fond explains that she had a revelation and had to see Montreuil immediately to inform her. Saint-Fond begins to inform the ladies gathered onstage of her latest exploits into the world of the erotic and profane. She recently participated in a black mass and was used as the altar. During the mass she came to the conclusion that she was no different from the Marquis, \"...I understood who Alfonse was.\" ... \"Alfonse was myself.\" When Montreuil and Anne begin to ridicule Saint-Fond the Comtesse asks Ren\u00e9e about the date of written on the announcement of Alphonse's release. Renee realizes that the date was a month and a half before her mother had informed her of the announcement. An argument breaks out between Renee, her mother, and Anne with the Comtesse egging Ren\u00e9e on. As the argument progresses, Anne asks Saint-Fond if she'd like to continue her walk; the pair leave together, leaving Renee and Montreuil to continue fighting. Ren\u00e9e's mother desperately begs her to leave the Marquis and Renee refuses. Montreuil informs Ren\u00e9e that she had a private investigator spy on the Marquis and Renee. The investigator saw Ren\u00e9e taking part in some of the Marquis' erotic S&M activities and being abused. Ren\u00e9e denounces her mother; Montreuil tells her daughter that staying with the Marquis de Sade will make her a pariah. Ren\u00e9e tells her mother that when things were good and Alphonse's status gave her family influence she was perfectly content with the marriage, but when Alphonse was in trouble and his reputation was no longer helping her family she denounced him.  The more Ren\u00e9e denounces her mother the more upset Montreuil becomes, until she is finally pushed over the edge.  \n\nMontreuil: \"Ren\u00e9e, I'll slap your face!\" <br />\nRen\u00e9e: \"Go ahead! But what would you do if I curled up with pleasure at being slapped?\" <br />\nMontreuil: \"Ohh...when you say that, your face...\"  <br />\nRen\u00e9e (takes a step forward): \"Yes what about my face?\" <br />\nMontreuil (raises her voice): \"...looks like Alphonse's. I'm afraid.\" <br />\nRenee (laughs): \"Madame de Saint-Fond had a word for it --- 'Alphonse is myself'!\"<br />\n\nAnd Act II ends.\n\n===Act Three===\nBy the end of the play everyone has given up something or made some sort of sacrifice. Madame de Sade plans to join a convent; Anne leaves her home and family and moves to Italy with her husband; Madame de Simaine has also joined a convent; Madame de Saint-Fond is trampled in a crowd who parades her dead body reverently through the streets; and Madame Montreuil is losing both her daughters (though perhaps not permanently) who are moving away. Charlotte is the only one who gains by the end, in that she has lost her meek and submissive demeanor.\n\n==Performance history==\n\n''Madame de Sade''{{'}}s first performance was on November 14, 1965 at Kinokuniya Hall, Tokyo.

The chiefs rejected the bribe by denouncing it in front of the tribal council.<ref>{{smallcaps|Eaton}}, ''supra'' at 42-46.</ref>|group=fn}}\n\nOn December 20, 1828, the state legislature of Georgia, fearful that the United States would not enforce (as a matter of Federal policy) the removal of the [[Cherokee people]] from their historic lands in the state, enacted a series of laws which stripped the Cherokee of their rights under the laws of the state.  They intended to force the Cherokee to leave the state. [[Andrew Jackson]], who had long favored removal, was elected US president in 1828, taking office in 1829.  In this climate, [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], [[Tribal chief|Principal Chief]] of the Cherokee Nation, led a delegation to Washington in January 1829 to resolve disputes over the failure of the US government to pay annuities to the Cherokee, and to seek Federal enforcement of the boundary between the territory of the state of Georgia and the Cherokee Nation's historic tribal lands within that state. Rather than lead the delegation into futile negotiations with [[Andrew Jackson|President Jackson]], Ross wrote an immediate memorial to Congress, completely forgoing the customary correspondence and petitions to the President.\n\nRoss found support in Congress from individuals in the [[National Republican Party]], such as senators [[Henry Clay]], [[Theodore Frelinghuysen]], and [[Daniel Webster]], as well as representatives [[Ambrose Spencer]] and [[Davy Crockett|David (Davy) Crockett]]. Despite this support, in April 1829, [[John H. Eaton]], the secretary of war (1829\u20131831), informed Ross that President Jackson would support the right of Georgia to extend its laws over the Cherokee Nation.  In May 1830, Congress endorsed Jackson's policy of removal by passing the [[Indian Removal Act]], which authorized the president to set aside lands west of the [[Mississippi River]] to exchange for the lands of Indian nations in the east.\n\nWhen Ross and the Cherokee delegation failed to protect Cherokee lands through negotiation with the executive branch and through petitions to Congress, Ross challenged the actions of the federal government through the U.S. courts.\n\n== The Case ==\nIn June 1830, a delegation of Cherokee led by [[Principal Chiefs of the Cherokee|Chief]] [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]] (selected at the urging of Senators [[Daniel Webster]] and [[Theodore Frelinghuysen]]) and [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]], attorney general in the [[James Monroe|Monroe]] and [[John Adams|Adams]] administrations, were selected to defend Cherokee rights before the U.S. Supreme Court.  The Cherokee Nation asked for an injunction, claiming that Georgia's state legislation had created laws that \"''go directly to annihilate the Cherokees as a political society''.\" Georgia pushed hard to bring evidence that the Cherokee Nation couldn't sue as a \"foreign\" nation due to the fact that they did not have a constitution or a strong central government. Wirt argued that \"''the Cherokee Nation [was] a foreign nation in the sense of our constitution and law''\" and was not subject to Georgia's jurisdiction.  Wirt asked the Supreme Court to ''[[null and void|void]]'' all Georgia laws extended over Cherokee lands on the grounds that they violated the U.S. Constitution, United States-Cherokee treaties, and United States intercourse laws.\n\nThe Court did hear the case but declined to rule on the merits. The Court determined that the framers of the Constitution did not really consider the Indian Tribes as foreign nations but more as \"domestic dependent nation[s]\" and consequently the Cherokee Nation lacked the standing to sue as a \"foreign\" nation. Chief Justice Marshall said; \"The court has bestowed its best attention on this question, and, after mature deliberation, the majority is of the opinion that an Indian tribe or nation within the United States is not a foreign state in the sense of the constitution, and cannot maintain an action in the courts of the United States.\" The Court held open the possibility that it yet might rule in favor of the Cherokee \"in a proper case with proper parties\".\n\nChief Justice [[John Marshall]] wrote that \"the relationship of the tribes to the United States resembles that of a 'ward to its guardian'.\"<ref>Wilkinson, C. (1988). ''American Indians, Time, and the Law: Native Societies in a Modern Constitutional Democracy'', Yale University Press</ref> Justice [[William Johnson (judge)|William Johnson]] added that the \"rules of nations\" would regard \"Indian tribes\" as \"nothing more than wandering hordes, held together only by ties of blood and habit, and having neither rules nor government beyond what is required in a savage state.\"<ref name=\":0\">''Cherokee Nation v Georgia'' 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) at 190.</ref>\n\nJustice [[Smith Thompson]], in a dissenting judgment joined by Justice [[Joseph Story]], held that the Cherokee nation was a \"foreign state\" in the sense that the Cherokee retained their \"usages and customs and self-government\" and the United States government had treated them as \"competent to make a treaty or contract\".<ref>''Cherokee Nation v Georgia'' 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) at 216-217.</ref> The Court therefore had jurisdiction; Acts passed by the State of Georgia were \"repugnant to the treaties with the Cherokees\" and directly in violation of a congressional Act of 1802;<ref>''Cherokee Nation v Georgia'' 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) at 232.</ref> and the injury to the Cherokee was severe enough to justify an injunction against the further execution of the state laws.<ref>''Cherokee Nation v Georgia'' 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) at 233-234.</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nOne year later, however, in [[Worcester v. Georgia|''Worcester v. Georgia'', 31 U.S. 515 (1832)]], the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Cherokee Nation was sovereign. According to the decision rendered by Chief Justice John Marshall, this meant that Georgia had no rights to enforce state laws in its territory.<ref>\"Worcester v. Georgia.\" Oyez. Accessed 03 Aug. 2014. https://www.oyez.org/cases/1792-1850/1832/1832_2</ref>\n\nPresident Andrew Jackson decided not to uphold the ruling of this case, and directed the expulsion of the Cherokee nation. U.S. Army forces were used in some cases to round them up. Their expulsion and subsequent route is called \"[[The Trail of Tears]].\" Of the 15,000 who left, 4,000 died on the journey to \"[[Indian Territory]]\" in the present-day U.S. state of [[Oklahoma]].<ref>\"The Trail of Tears.\" ''pbs.org.''

The chiefs rejected the bribe by denouncing it in front of the tribal council.<ref>{{smallcaps|Eaton}}, ''supra'' at 42-46.</ref>|group=fn}}\n\nOn December 20, 1828, the state legislature of Georgia, fearful that the United States would not enforce (as a matter of Federal policy) the removal of the [[Cherokee people]] from their historic lands in the state, enacted a series of laws which stripped the Cherokee of their rights under the laws of the state.  They intended to force the Cherokee to leave the state. [[Andrew Jackson]], who had long favored removal, was elected US president in 1828, taking office in 1829.  In this climate, [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], [[Tribal chief|Principal Chief]] of the Cherokee Nation, led a delegation to Washington in January 1829 to resolve disputes over the failure of the US government to pay annuities to the Cherokee, and to seek Federal enforcement of the boundary between the territory of the state of Georgia and the Cherokee Nation's historic tribal lands within that state. Rather than lead the delegation into futile negotiations with [[Andrew Jackson|President Jackson]], Ross wrote an immediate memorial to Congress, completely forgoing the customary correspondence and petitions to the President.\n\nRoss found support in Congress from individuals in the [[National Republican Party]], such as senators [[Henry Clay]], [[Theodore Frelinghuysen]], and [[Daniel Webster]], as well as representatives [[Ambrose Spencer]] and [[Davy Crockett|David (Davy) Crockett]]. Despite this support, in April 1829, [[John H. Eaton]], the secretary of war (1829\u20131831), informed Ross that President Jackson would support the right of Georgia to extend its laws over the Cherokee Nation.  In May 1830, Congress endorsed Jackson's policy of removal by passing the [[Indian Removal Act]], which authorized the president to set aside lands west of the [[Mississippi River]] to exchange for the lands of Indian nations in the east.\n\nWhen Ross and the Cherokee delegation failed to protect Cherokee lands through negotiation with the executive branch and through petitions to Congress, Ross challenged the actions of the federal government through the U.S. courts.\n\n== The Case ==\nIn June 1830, a delegation of Cherokee led by [[Principal Chiefs of the Cherokee|Chief]] [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]] (selected at the urging of Senators [[Daniel Webster]] and [[Theodore Frelinghuysen]]) and [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]], attorney general in the [[James Monroe|Monroe]] and [[John Adams|Adams]] administrations, were selected to defend Cherokee rights before the U.S. Supreme Court.  The Cherokee Nation asked for an injunction, claiming that Georgia's state legislation had created laws that \"''go directly to annihilate the Cherokees as a political society''.\" Georgia pushed hard to bring evidence that the Cherokee Nation couldn't sue as a \"foreign\" nation due to the fact that they did not have a constitution or a strong central government. Wirt argued that \"''the Cherokee Nation [was] a foreign nation in the sense of our constitution and law''\" and was not subject to Georgia's jurisdiction.  Wirt asked the Supreme Court to ''[[null and void|void]]'' all Georgia laws extended over Cherokee lands on the grounds that they violated the U.S. Constitution, United States-Cherokee treaties, and United States intercourse laws.\n\nThe Court did hear the case but declined to rule on the merits. The Court determined that the framers of the Constitution did not really consider the Indian Tribes as foreign nations but more as \"domestic dependent nation[s]\" and consequently the Cherokee Nation lacked the standing to sue as a \"foreign\" nation. Chief Justice Marshall said; \"The court has bestowed its best attention on this question, and, after mature deliberation, the majority is of the opinion that an Indian tribe or nation within the United States is not a foreign state in the sense of the constitution, and cannot maintain an action in the courts of the United States.\" The Court held open the possibility that it yet might rule in favor of the Cherokee \"in a proper case with proper parties\".\n\nChief Justice [[John Marshall]] wrote that \"the relationship of the tribes to the United States resembles that of a 'ward to its guardian'.\"<ref>Wilkinson, C. (1988). ''American Indians, Time, and the Law: Native Societies in a Modern Constitutional Democracy'', Yale University Press</ref> Justice [[William Johnson (judge)|William Johnson]] added that the \"rules of nations\" would regard \"Indian tribes\" as \"nothing more than wandering hordes, held together only by ties of blood and habit, and having neither rules nor government beyond what is required in a savage state.\"<ref name=\":0\">''Cherokee Nation v Georgia'' 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) at 190.</ref>\n\nJustice [[Smith Thompson]], in a dissenting judgment joined by Justice [[Joseph Story]], held that the Cherokee nation was a \"foreign state\" in the sense that the Cherokee retained their \"usages and customs and self-government\" and the United States government had treated them as \"competent to make a treaty or contract\".<ref>''Cherokee Nation v Georgia'' 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) at 216-217.</ref> The Court therefore had jurisdiction; Acts passed by the State of Georgia were \"repugnant to the treaties with the Cherokees\" and directly in violation of a congressional Act of 1802;<ref>''Cherokee Nation v Georgia'' 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) at 232.</ref> and the injury to the Cherokee was severe enough to justify an injunction against the further execution of the state laws.<ref>''Cherokee Nation v Georgia'' 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) at 233-234.</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nOne year later, however, in [[Worcester v. Georgia|''Worcester v. Georgia'', 31 U.S. 515 (1832)]], the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Cherokee Nation was sovereign. According to the decision rendered by Chief Justice John Marshall, this meant that Georgia had no rights to enforce state laws in its territory.<ref>\"Worcester v. Georgia.\" Oyez. Accessed 03 Aug. 2014. https://www.oyez.org/cases/1792-1850/1832/1832_2</ref>\n\nPresident Andrew Jackson decided not to uphold the ruling of this case, and directed the expulsion of the Cherokee nation. U.S. Army forces were used in some cases to round them up. Their expulsion and subsequent route is called \"[[The Trail of Tears]].\" Of the 15,000 who left, 4,000 died on the journey to \"[[Indian Territory]]\" in the present-day U.S. state of [[Oklahoma]].<ref>\"The Trail of Tears.\" ''pbs.org.''

Mud-like clay was placed in the wooden frames, and the surface was smoothed for writing and allowed to dry until damp.

For storage, tablets could be stacked on edge, side by side, the contents described by a title written on the edge that faced out and was readily seen. The first libraries appeared five thousand years ago in Southwest Asia's [[Fertile Crescent]], an area that ran from Mesopotamia to the Nile in Africa. Known as the cradle of civilization, the Fertile Crescent was the birthplace of writing, sometime before 3000 BC. (Murray, Stuart A.P.)

The \"libraries\" were cataloged using [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]]s, which are a publisher's imprint on the spine of a book, or in this case a tablet. The colophons stated the series name, the title of the tablet, and any extra information the scribe needed to indicate. Eventually, the clay tablets were organized by subject and size. Unfortunately, due to limited bookshelf space, when more tablets were added to the library, older ones were removed, which is why some tablets are missing from the excavated cities in Mesopotamia.<ref>Weitemeyer, M.

Those libraries within the kingdom had two major functions: the first came from the need to keep the records of administrative documents including transactions, governmental orders, and budget allocation within and between the Satrapies and the central ruling State.<ref>Rajabi, Parviz. 1381. The lost Milleniums, Vol 3, Toos Publication, {{ISBN|964-315-573-0}}</ref> The second function was to collect precious resources on different subjects of science and sets of principles e.g. medical science, astronomy, history, geometry and philosophy.\n\nIn 1933 an impressive collection of clay tablets discovered by the [[University of Chicago]] in [[Persepolis]] revealed the strong tendency of the Achaemenids to record, classify and store their documents as the backbone of their ruling system throughout a vast territory. The contents of these baked tablets written in Old Persian, Elamite and Babylonian vary from records of sales, taxes, payments, treasury details to remarkable social, artistic and philosophical aspects of ordinary life in the Empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/projects/persepolis-fortification-archive |title=Persepolis Fortification Archive}}</ref> These uniquely important tablets, known as the [[Persepolis Fortification Archive]], are the property of Iran.

In the 10th century, [[Ibn al-Nadim]], a well-known Muslim bibliographer, stated that following the conquest, the majority of the resources in different streams of science were taken from Persia's main libraries to Egypt. They were later translated into Latin, Egyptian, Coptic and Greek and used as a remarkable body of science in the [[Library of Alexandria]].

The celebrated book collectors of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] were listed in the late 2nd century in ''[[Deipnosophistae]]''. All these libraries were Greek; the cultivated Hellenized diners in ''Deipnosophistae'' pass over the libraries of Rome in silence. By the time of Augustus there were public libraries near the forums of Rome: there were libraries in the [[Porticus Octaviae]] near the [[Theatre of Marcellus]], in the temple of Apollo Palatinus, and in the Ulpian Library in the [[Forum of Trajan]]. The state archives were kept in a structure on the slope between the [[Roman Forum]] and the [[Capitoline Hill]].\n\n[[Private libraries]] appeared during the late republic: [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] inveighed against libraries fitted out for show by illiterate owners who scarcely read their titles in the course of a lifetime, but displayed the scrolls in bookcases (''armaria'') of citrus wood inlaid with ivory that ran right to the ceiling: \"by now, like bathrooms and hot water, a library is got up as standard equipment for a fine house (''[[domus]]'').<ref>Seneca, ''De tranquillitate animi'' ix.4\u20137.</ref> Libraries were amenities suited to a villa, such as Cicero's at Tusculum, [[Maecenas]]'s several villas, or Pliny the Younger's, all described in surviving letters.

Rome's first public library was established by [[Asinius Pollio]]. Pollio was a lieutenant of [[Julius Caesar]] and one of his most ardent supporters. After his military victory in Illyria, Pollio felt he had enough fame and fortune to create what Julius Caesar had sought for a long time: a public library to increase the prestige of Rome and rival the one in Alexandria.<ref>Casson, L.

Vespasian's library was constructed in the [[Imperial Forums|Forum of Vespasian]], also known as the ''Forum of Peace'', and became one of Rome's principal libraries. The ''Bibliotheca Pacis'' was built along the traditional model and had two large halls with rooms for Greek and Latin libraries containing the works of Galen and Lucius Aelius.<ref>Casson, 2001, p.&nbsp;84; Buchanan, 2012, pp.&nbsp;61\u201362</ref> One of the best preserved was the ancient Ulpian Library built by the Emperor Trajan.

Reading or copying was normally done in the room itself. The surviving records give only a few instances of lending features. Most of the large [[Roman bath]]s were also cultural centres, built from the start with a library, a two-room arrangement with one room for Greek and one for Latin texts.\n\nLibraries were filled with [[scroll (parchment)|parchment scrolls]] as at [[Library of Pergamum]] and on [[papyrus]] scrolls as at [[Alexandria]]: the export of prepared writing materials was a staple of commerce. There were a few institutional or royal libraries which were open to an educated public (such as the Serapeum collection of the [[Library of Alexandria]], once the largest [[Great libraries of the ancient world|library in the ancient world]]),<ref name=\"unllib.unl.edu\"/> but on the whole collections were private. In those rare cases where it was possible for a scholar to consult library books there seems to have been no direct access to the stacks. In all recorded cases the books were kept in a relatively small room where the staff went to get them for the readers, who had to consult them in an adjoining hall or covered walkway. Most of the works in catalogs were of a religious nature, such as volumes of the Bible or religious service books. \"In a number of cases the library was entirely theological and liturgical, and in the greater part of the libraries the non-ecclesiastical content did not reach one third of the total\"<ref name=\":0\">Beddie, J.

In this period, books were organized by subject. Within the subject, the materials were further organized by when the libraries gained the item, not by last name of the author or the title of the book. Also, Islamic libraries may be the first to have implemented a catalogue of owned materials. The content of a bookshelf was recorded on paper and attached to the end of shelf. Like the Christian libraries, they mostly contained books which were made of paper, and took a [[codex]] or modern form instead of scrolls; they could be found in mosques, private homes, and universities, from [[Timbuktu]] to Afghanistan and modern day Pakistan. In [[Aleppo]], for example, the largest and probably the oldest mosque library, the Sufiya, located at the city's Grand Umayyad Mosque, contained a large book collection of which 10,000 volumes were reportedly bequeathed by the city's most famous ruler, Prince Sayf al-Dawla.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sibai |first=Mohamed Makki |title=Mosque libraries: An Historical Study |year=1987 |publisher=Mansell Publishing Limited |page=71 |isbn=978-0-7201-1896-4}}</ref> [[Ibn al-Nadim]]'s bibliography ''Fihrist'' demonstrates the devotion of medieval Muslim scholars to books and reliable sources; it contains a description of thousands of books circulating in the Islamic world circa 1000, including an entire section for books about the doctrines of other religions.

[[Chinese Emperors|Chinese emperors]] were very supportive of this culture.  Chinese printing and [[papermaking]], which predate Western development, gave birth to a thriving book culture in East Asia.<ref name=\"Murray\" /> Several Asian religious and philosophical movements are responsible for stimulating learning, printing and book collecting: [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism|Daoism]], and [[Jainism]].<ref name=\"Murray\" />  Jainism, a major faith of the [[Indian subcontinent]], had a tradition of religious, scientific, and cultural scholarship.

Writings the sixth-century philosopher, [[Confucius]], were originally inscribed on stone tablets. To achieve this early form of printing the Chinese would push soft paper onto the stone, apply ink to the back of the sheet, resulting in a black background with white letters.<ref name=\"Murray\" />  The Chinese also employed inked carved woodblock to produce printed materials.  One of the major Buddhist canons, the ''[[Tripi\u1e6daka|Tripitaka]],'' was published in 5,000 volumes using more than 130,000 individual woodblocks.<ref name=\"Murray\" /> In the eleventh century [[movable type]] was developed in China and [[Goryeo|Koreans]] established the first [[foundry]] for producing movable type.  In spite of these developments, [[woodblock printing]] remained the norm in China, Korea, and Japan.  Each ruler in China compiled its own official written archives.  Every emperor decided which philosophical texts, which accounts of history, which rituals of faith, and what poetry and literature would be permitted in the empire; oftentimes chronicling their own version of the previous ruler's history.  Confucian and Buddhist writings that were brought to Korea and Japan are directly responsible for the continued development of book publishing and library building in East Asia.<ref name=\"Murray\" />\n\n[[Buddhist scriptures]], educational materials, and histories were stored in libraries in pre-modern [[Southeast Asia]].

Shelves built above and between back-to-back lecterns were the beginning of [[Bookcase|bookpresses]]. The chain was attached at the fore-edge of a book rather than to its spine. Book presses came to be arranged in [[carrel desk|carrels]] (perpendicular to the walls and therefore to the windows) in order to maximize lighting, with low bookcases in front of the windows. This \"stall system\" (i.e. fixed bookcases perpendicular to exterior walls pierced by closely spaced windows) was characteristic of English institutional libraries. In European libraries, bookcases were arranged parallel to and against the walls. This \"wall system\" was first introduced on a large scale in Spain's [[El Escorial]].\n\nAs extensions of the Catholic Church, medieval libraries' collections often excluded materials considered to be heretical or \"pagan\", such as the works of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].<ref>Beddie, J.

In Milan Cardinal [[Federico Borromeo]] founded the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]].\n\nThis trend soon spread outside of Italy, for example [[Louis III, Elector Palatine]] founded the [[Bibliotheca Palatina]] of [[Heidelberg]].\n\nThese libraries had fewer volumes than modern libraries; but thay had many valuable manuscripts of Greek, Latin and Biblical works. After the invention of the printing press, many Renaissance libraries began to collect printed texts of useful information as well as historical manuscripts; this change occurred between about 1550 and 1650.

Access to the Museum depended on passes, of which there was sometimes a waiting period of three to four weeks. Moreover, the library was not open to browsing. Once a pass to the library had been issued, the reader was taken on a tour of it. Many readers complained that the tour was much too short.<ref>Battles, Matthew (2003) ''Library: an unquiet history''; p. 121</ref>\n\nAlthough most libraries followed this model of patron restriction, there were exceptions such as [[Herzog August Library|the Ducal Library at Wolfenb\u00fcttel]], which was open every weekday morning and afternoon. The library had a diverse set of patrons of whom a large percentage were middle-class and non-academic users.

Many small, private book clubs evolved into subscription libraries, charging high annual fees or requiring subscribing members to purchase shares in the libraries. The materials available to subscribers tended to focus on particular subject areas, such as [[biography]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[theology]], and [[travel]], rather than works of fiction, particularly the novel.\n\nUnlike a [[public library]], access was often restricted to members. Some of the earliest such institutions were founded in late 17th-century England, such as [[Chetham's Library]] in 1653, [[Innerpeffray Library]] in 1680 and [[Thomas Plume|Thomas Plume's Library]] in 1704.

Even though the subscription libraries were often founded by reading societies, committees, elected by the subscribers, chose books for the collection that were general, rather than aimed at a particular religious, political or professional group. The books selected for the collection were chosen because they would be mutually beneficial to the shareholders. The committee also selected the librarians who would manage the circulation of materials.<ref name=Forster>Forster, Geoffrey, and Alan Bell. \"The subscription libraries and their members.\" The Cambridge History of Libraries in Britain And Ireland. 3 vols.

The Act first gave local [[municipal borough|boroughs]] the power to establish free public libraries and was the first legislative step toward the creation of an enduring national institution that provides universal free access to information and literature. In the 1830s, at the height of the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement, there was a general tendency towards reformism in the United Kingdom. The [[Capitalist]] economic model had created a significant amount of free time for workers, and the middle classes were concerned that the workers' free time was not being well-spent. This was prompted more by Victorian middle class paternalism rather than by demand from the lower social orders.<ref>McMenemy (2009), pp. 24\u201326</ref> Campaigners felt that encouraging the lower classes to spend their free time on morally uplifting activities, such as reading, would promote greater social good.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Llibrary.htm|title=History of the Public Libraries Act|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316170538/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Llibrary.htm|archivedate=16 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1835, and against government opposition, [[James Silk Buckingham]], MP for Sheffield and a supporter of the [[temperance movement]], was able to secure the Chair of the [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select Committee]] which would examine \"the extent, causes, and consequences of the prevailing vice of intoxication among the labouring classes of the United Kingdom\" and propose solutions. [[Francis Place]], a campaigner for the working class, agreed that \"the establishment of parish libraries and district reading rooms, and popular lectures on subjects both entertaining and instructive to the community might draw off a number of those who now frequent public houses for the sole enjoyment they afford\".<ref>Select Committee on inquiry into drunkenness, ''Report'' (1834)</ref> Buckingham introduced to Parliament a Public Institution Bill allowing boroughs to charge a tax to set up libraries and museums, the first of its kind. Although this did not become law, it had a major influence on [[William Ewart (English politician)|William Ewart]] MP and [[Joseph Brotherton]] MP, who introduced a bill which would \"[empower] boroughs with a population of 10,000 or more to raise a \u00bdd for the establishment of museums\".<ref>Kelly & Kelly (1977), p. 77</ref> This became the [[Museums Act 1845]].\n\n[[File:Peter White Public Library, Marquette, Mich. c.1905.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The turn of the 20th century witnessed a tremendous expansion in the provision of public libraries in the [[English-speaking world]].

The Report argued that the provision of public libraries would steer people towards temperate and moderate habits. With a view to maximising the potential of current facilities, the Committee made two significant recommendations. They suggested that the government should issue grants to aid the foundation of libraries and that the Museums Act 1845 should be amended and extended to allow for a tax to be levied for the establishment of public libraries.<ref>Minto (1932) chapters 3\u20134</ref><ref>Murison (1971) chapter 2</ref><ref>Hansard (1850) Col. 848</ref> The Bill passed through [[Parliament]] as most MPs felt that public libraries would provide facilities for self-improvement through books and reading for all classes, and that the greater levels of education attained by providing public libraries would result in lower [[crime rate]]s.\n\nThe earliest example in England of a library to be endowed for the benefit of users who were not members of an institution such as a cathedral or college was the [[Francis Trigge Chained Library]] in [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]], established in 1598. The library still exists and can justifiably claim to be the forerunner of later public library systems. The beginning of the modern, free, open access libraries really got its start in the UK in 1847. [[Parliament]] appointed a committee, led by William Ewart, on Public Libraries to consider the necessity of establishing libraries through the nation: In 1849 their report noted the poor condition of library service, it recommended the establishment of free public libraries all over the country, and it led to the Public Libraries Act in 1850, which allowed all cities with populations exceeding 10,000 to levy taxes for the support of public libraries.\n\n[[Salford Museum and Art Gallery]] first opened in November 1850 as \"The Royal Museum & Public Library\", as the first unconditionally free public library in England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/ewm/001ewm/024_sal_mayor/index.html |publisher=Manchesteronline |title=Eye witness in Manchester |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014184824/http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/ewm/001ewm/024_sal_mayor/index.html |archivedate=14 October 2007 }} Retrieved on 5 September 2008</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitsalford.info/whattosee/heritage/industrialheritage/industrialheritage1st.htm|publisher=visitsalford.info|title=1st in Salford|accessdate=19 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107050723/http://www.visitsalford.info/whattosee/heritage/industrialheritage/industrialheritage1st.htm|archive-date=7 January 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The library in [[Castlefield|Campfield]], [[Manchester]] was the first library to operate a ''free'' lending library without subscription in 1852.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2238494.stm | work=BBC News | title=Anniversary of first public library | date=5 September 2002 | accessdate=14 April 2010}}</ref> [[Norwich]] lays claims to being the first municipality to adopt the Public Libraries Act 1850 (which allowed any municipal borough with a population of 100,000 or more to introduce a halfpenny rate to establish public libraries \u2013 although not to buy books).

Additionally, Carnegie libraries could not rely solely on private funds, but required public funds as well. This ensured that the libraries would be a part of the community and continue to receive funding after the initial donation.

By 1838, its collection included 600 volumes, as well as pamphlets and maps. Members could read independently or follow a scheduled course of study. \n\nThe nineteenth century was a fruitful time for African American literary societies. As well as a creating space for a black literary tradition, these societies provided libraries to their members, often through subscriptions. They were an important beginning in library access for African Americans in the United States when they were excluded from larger white literary societies. African American literary societies included the [[Bethel Literary and Historical Society]], Philadelphia Library Company of Colored Persons already mentioned. Additional societies that held an important role in library history included the Banneker Institute of the City of Philadelphia which began in 1854 and, within three years, had a library that compared to that of the Philadelphia Library Company of Colored Persons, which in 1841 recorded a collection of almost 600 books.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Tony|title=The Banneker Literary Institute of Philadelphia: African American Intellectual Activism before the War of the Slaveholders' Rebellion|url=|journal=The Journal of African American History|volume=87|issue=3|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.2307/1562480|jstor=1562480|year=2002}}</ref> There were also literary societies created specifically by and for black women such as the Female Literary Association which started in Philadelphia in 1831 and included the role of a librarian in its constitution, who would \u201chave charge of all books belonging to the Association, and after each meeting, take care that they be placed in the Library.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=Black Women in America|last=Bethel|first=Kathleen|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780195371307|editor-last=Clark Hine|editor-first=Darlene|edition=Second|location=|pages=|chapter=Librarianship}}</ref> Much of the literature focuses on Philadelphia seemingly due to the many literary societies found there and the documentation that has been preserved about them, but there were many throughout the country.

For many of these buildings, the quality of the interior spaces, their lighting and atmosphere, was becoming more significant than the fa\u00e7ade design of the library building. Modernist architects like [[Alvar Aalto]] put great emphasis on the comfort and usability of library spaces. The Municipal Library he built 1958\u201362 for the German city of [[Wolfsburg]] features a great central room for which he used a series of specially designed skylights to bring in natural light, even though all the walls are covered with books.\n\n===21st century===\nIn the 21st Century, libraries continue to change and evolve to match new trends involving the way that patrons consume books and other media. More than ever, the 21st Century library is the digital library. As of 2016, over 90% of public libraries have e-book collections, and over 25% circulate e-readers or tablets. Librarians are increasingly responsible for both physical and digital collections. A digital collection can include sources created and distributed digitally, to physical documents scanned and provided in a digital format. Digital libraries bring with them a whole host of new challenges such as: how the resources are distributed to patrons, whether or not authentication is required and the compatibility of patron hardware or software. \n\nAdditionally new trends attract patrons to libraries for purposes other than books. The Maker Movement and Maker-spaces are a new trend designed to foster creativity and provide a space for library users to tinker, invent and socialize. Maker-spaces feature both high and low-tech media, though many focus on advanced technology such as 3D Printers or Virtual Reality and making them available to users who might normally not have access to them.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McCook|first=Kathleen de la Pe\u00f1a|title=Introduction to Public Librarianship|publisher=ALA Neal-Schuman|year=2018|isbn=978-0-8389-1506-6|location=Chicago|pages=}}</ref> Many might also feature Video and Audio recording studios, complete with advanced computers to help users edit their creations.\n\nA challenge commonly faced by 21st century libraries are budget-cuts, forcing librarians to become more efficient in the management of their funds and more vocal in the advocacy of their libraries.

For storage, tablets could be stacked on edge, side by side, the contents described by a title written on the edge that faced out and was readily seen. The first libraries appeared five thousand years ago in Southwest Asia's [[Fertile Crescent]], an area that ran from Mesopotamia to the Nile in Africa. Known as the cradle of civilization, the Fertile Crescent was the birthplace of writing, sometime before 3000 BC. (Murray, Stuart A.P.)

The colophons stated the series name, the title of the tablet, and any extra information the scribe needed to indicate. Eventually, the clay tablets were organized by subject and size.

The celebrated book collectors of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] were listed in the late 2nd century in ''[[Deipnosophistae]]''. All these libraries were Greek; the cultivated Hellenized diners in ''Deipnosophistae'' pass over the libraries of Rome in silence. By the time of Augustus there were public libraries near the forums of Rome: there were libraries in the [[Porticus Octaviae]] near the [[Theatre of Marcellus]], in the temple of Apollo Palatinus, and in the Ulpian Library in the [[Forum of Trajan]]. The state archives were kept in a structure on the slope between the [[Roman Forum]] and the [[Capitoline Hill]].\n\n[[Private libraries]] appeared during the late republic: [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] inveighed against libraries fitted out for show by illiterate owners who scarcely read their titles in the course of a lifetime, but displayed the scrolls in bookcases (''armaria'') of citrus wood inlaid with ivory that ran right to the ceiling: \"by now, like bathrooms and hot water, a library is got up as standard equipment for a fine house (''[[domus]]'').<ref>Seneca, ''De tranquillitate animi'' ix.4\u20137.</ref> Libraries were amenities suited to a villa, such as Cicero's at Tusculum, [[Maecenas]]'s several villas, or Pliny the Younger's, all described in surviving letters. At the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]], apparently the villa of Caesar's father-in-law, the Greek library has been partly preserved in volcanic ash; archaeologists speculate that a Latin library, kept separate from the Greek one, may await discovery at the site.\n\n[[File:Ephesus Celsus Library Fa\u00e7ade.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of the [[Library of Celsus]] at Ephesus]]\nIn the West, the first public libraries were established under the [[Roman Empire]] as each succeeding emperor strove to open one or many which outshone that of his predecessor. Rome's first public library was established by [[Asinius Pollio]]. Pollio was a lieutenant of [[Julius Caesar]] and one of his most ardent supporters. After his military victory in Illyria, Pollio felt he had enough fame and fortune to create what Julius Caesar had sought for a long time: a public library to increase the prestige of Rome and rival the one in Alexandria.<ref>Casson, L.

[[Chinese Emperors|Chinese emperors]] were very supportive of this culture.  Chinese printing and [[papermaking]], which predate Western development, gave birth to a thriving book culture in East Asia.<ref name=\"Murray\" /> Several Asian religious and philosophical movements are responsible for stimulating learning, printing and book collecting: [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism|Daoism]], and [[Jainism]].<ref name=\"Murray\" />  Jainism, a major faith of the [[Indian subcontinent]], had a tradition of religious, scientific, and cultural scholarship.  Early practitioners of the faith not only produced scriptural writing the first century BC, but also established some of Asia's earliest libraries.<ref name=\"Murray\" />  Mainly housed in [[Jain temple|temples]], these libraries later became known as \"Jain Knowledge Warehouses\" and is responsible for the preservation of hundreds of thousands handwritten manuscripts.\n\nThe [[History of paper|invention of paper]] in China allowed the Chinese to create an early form of printing (stone-rubbing).  Writings the sixth-century philosopher, [[Confucius]], were originally inscribed on stone tablets. To achieve this early form of printing the Chinese would push soft paper onto the stone, apply ink to the back of the sheet, resulting in a black background with white letters.<ref name=\"Murray\" />  The Chinese also employed inked carved woodblock to produce printed materials.  One of the major Buddhist canons, the ''[[Tripi\u1e6daka|Tripitaka]],'' was published in 5,000 volumes using more than 130,000 individual woodblocks.<ref name=\"Murray\" /> In the eleventh century [[movable type]] was developed in China and [[Goryeo|Koreans]] established the first [[foundry]] for producing movable type.  In spite of these developments, [[woodblock printing]] remained the norm in China, Korea, and Japan.  Each ruler in China compiled its own official written archives.  Every emperor decided which philosophical texts, which accounts of history, which rituals of faith, and what poetry and literature would be permitted in the empire; oftentimes chronicling their own version of the previous ruler's history.  Confucian and Buddhist writings that were brought to Korea and Japan are directly responsible for the continued development of book publishing and library building in East Asia.<ref name=\"Murray\" />\n\n[[Buddhist scriptures]], educational materials, and histories were stored in libraries in pre-modern [[Southeast Asia]]. In [[Burma]], a royal library called the [[Pitakataik (Bagan)|Pitakataik]] was legendarily founded by King [[Anawrahta]];<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zoq_TtEN54IC&pg=PA29 International dictionary of library histories]'', 29</ref> in the 18th century, British envoy [[Michael Symes (diplomat)|Michael Symes]], on visiting this library, wrote that \"it is not improbable that his Birman majesty may possess a more numerous library than any potentate, from the banks of the Danube to the borders of China\".

Lending was a means by which books could be copied and spread. In 1212 the council of Paris condemned those monasteries that still forbade loaning books, reminding them that lending is \"one of the chief works of mercy.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Books and Their Makers in the Middle Ages|url=https://archive.org/details/bookstheirmakers0000putn|url-access=registration|author=Geo.

Shelves built above and between back-to-back lecterns were the beginning of [[Bookcase|bookpresses]]. The chain was attached at the fore-edge of a book rather than to its spine. Book presses came to be arranged in [[carrel desk|carrels]] (perpendicular to the walls and therefore to the windows) in order to maximize lighting, with low bookcases in front of the windows. This \"stall system\" (i.e. fixed bookcases perpendicular to exterior walls pierced by closely spaced windows) was characteristic of English institutional libraries. In European libraries, bookcases were arranged parallel to and against the walls. This \"wall system\" was first introduced on a large scale in Spain's [[El Escorial]].\n\nAs extensions of the Catholic Church, medieval libraries' collections often excluded materials considered to be heretical or \"pagan\", such as the works of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].<ref>Beddie, J. (1930). The Ancient Classics in the Mediaeval Libraries. Speculum, 5(1), 3-20. doi:10.2307/2846353</ref>\n\nAlso, in [[Eastern Christianity]] monastery libraries kept important manuscripts. The most important of them were the ones in the monasteries of [[Mount Athos]] for [[Orthodox Christians]], and the library of the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]], [[Egypt]] for the [[Coptic Church]].\n\n==Renaissance==\n[[File:Biblioteca medicea laurenziana interno 01.JPG|thumb|Reading room of the [[Laurentian Library]]]]\nFrom the 15th century in central and northern Italy, libraries of [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] and their enlightened patrons provided a nucleus around which an \"[[academy]]\" of scholars congregated in each Italian city of consequence.

In 1490, the library consisted of about 3,000 codices or \"Corvinae\". [[Beatrix of Aragon]], Queen of Hungary, encouraged his work with the Bibliotheca Corviniana. After Matthias' death in 1490 many of the manuscripts were taken from library and dispersed, subsequently the Turkish invasion of Hungary in the 16th century saw the remaining valuable manuscripts taken to Turkey.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sch\u00fctz |first1=G. |title=Bibliotheca Corvina |journal=The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy |date=1934 |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=559\u2013560 |issn=0024-2519}}</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century [[Pope Sixtus V|Sixtus V]] bisected Bramante's [[Cortile del Belvedere]] with a cross-wing to house the Apostolic Library in suitable magnificence. The 16th and 17th centuries saw other privately endowed libraries assembled in Rome: the [[Biblioteca Vallicelliana|Vallicelliana]], formed from the books of Saint [[Filippo Neri]], with other distinguished libraries such as that of [[Cesare Baronio]], the [[Biblioteca Angelica]] founded by the Augustinian [[Angelo Rocca]], which was the only truly public library in Counter-Reformation Rome; the Biblioteca Alessandrina with which [[Pope Alexander VII]] endowed the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]]; the [[Biblioteca Casanatense]] of the Cardinal [[Girolamo Casanate]]; and finally the Biblioteca Corsiniana founded by the bibliophile [[Pope Clement XII|Clement XII Corsini]] and his nephew Cardinal Neri Corsini, still housed in Palazzo Corsini in via della Lungara. The [[Republic of Venice]] patronized the foundation of the [[Biblioteca Marciana]], based on the library of Cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion]]. In Milan Cardinal [[Federico Borromeo]] founded the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]].\n\nThis trend soon spread outside of Italy, for example [[Louis III, Elector Palatine]] founded the [[Bibliotheca Palatina]] of [[Heidelberg]].\n\nThese libraries had fewer volumes than modern libraries; but thay had many valuable manuscripts of Greek, Latin and Biblical works. After the invention of the printing press, many Renaissance libraries began to collect printed texts of useful information as well as historical manuscripts; this change occurred between about 1550 and 1650. This transition of collections during the Renaissance was not just a shift from manuscripts to printed texts, but also from books as expensive luxury aesthetic artifacts both in print and in manuscript form to an expenditure on multiple copies of printed texts which held valuable, practical information.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Warren |last=Boutcher |year=2011 |title=Collecting Manuscripts and Printed Books in the Late Renaissance: Naud\u00e9 and the Last Duke of Urbino's Library |journal=Italian Studies |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=206\u2013220 |doi=10.1179/174861811X13009843386558 |ref=harv}} p.&nbsp;211.</ref> One example is the library at the [[Palazzo Ducale, Urbino|Ducal Palace in Urbino]], Italy.

Many small, private book clubs evolved into subscription libraries, charging high annual fees or requiring subscribing members to purchase shares in the libraries. The materials available to subscribers tended to focus on particular subject areas, such as [[biography]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[theology]], and [[travel]], rather than works of fiction, particularly the novel.\n\nUnlike a [[public library]], access was often restricted to members. Some of the earliest such institutions were founded in late 17th-century England, such as [[Chetham's Library]] in 1653, [[Innerpeffray Library]] in 1680 and [[Thomas Plume|Thomas Plume's Library]] in 1704.

Even though the subscription libraries were often founded by reading societies, committees, elected by the subscribers, chose books for the collection that were general, rather than aimed at a particular religious, political or professional group. The books selected for the collection were chosen because they would be mutually beneficial to the shareholders. The committee also selected the librarians who would manage the circulation of materials.<ref name=Forster>Forster, Geoffrey, and Alan Bell. \"The subscription libraries and their members.\" The Cambridge History of Libraries in Britain And Ireland. 3 vols.

The Act first gave local [[municipal borough|boroughs]] the power to establish free public libraries and was the first legislative step toward the creation of an enduring national institution that provides universal free access to information and literature. In the 1830s, at the height of the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement, there was a general tendency towards reformism in the United Kingdom. The [[Capitalist]] economic model had created a significant amount of free time for workers, and the middle classes were concerned that the workers' free time was not being well-spent. This was prompted more by Victorian middle class paternalism rather than by demand from the lower social orders.<ref>McMenemy (2009), pp. 24\u201326</ref> Campaigners felt that encouraging the lower classes to spend their free time on morally uplifting activities, such as reading, would promote greater social good.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Llibrary.htm|title=History of the Public Libraries Act|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316170538/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Llibrary.htm|archivedate=16 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1835, and against government opposition, [[James Silk Buckingham]], MP for Sheffield and a supporter of the [[temperance movement]], was able to secure the Chair of the [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select Committee]] which would examine \"the extent, causes, and consequences of the prevailing vice of intoxication among the labouring classes of the United Kingdom\" and propose solutions.

The Report argued that the provision of public libraries would steer people towards temperate and moderate habits. With a view to maximising the potential of current facilities, the Committee made two significant recommendations. They suggested that the government should issue grants to aid the foundation of libraries and that the Museums Act 1845 should be amended and extended to allow for a tax to be levied for the establishment of public libraries.<ref>Minto (1932) chapters 3\u20134</ref><ref>Murison (1971) chapter 2</ref><ref>Hansard (1850) Col. 848</ref> The Bill passed through [[Parliament]] as most MPs felt that public libraries would provide facilities for self-improvement through books and reading for all classes, and that the greater levels of education attained by providing public libraries would result in lower [[crime rate]]s.\n\nThe earliest example in England of a library to be endowed for the benefit of users who were not members of an institution such as a cathedral or college was the [[Francis Trigge Chained Library]] in [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]], established in 1598. The library still exists and can justifiably claim to be the forerunner of later public library systems. The beginning of the modern, free, open access libraries really got its start in the UK in 1847. [[Parliament]] appointed a committee, led by William Ewart, on Public Libraries to consider the necessity of establishing libraries through the nation: In 1849 their report noted the poor condition of library service, it recommended the establishment of free public libraries all over the country, and it led to the Public Libraries Act in 1850, which allowed all cities with populations exceeding 10,000 to levy taxes for the support of public libraries.\n\n[[Salford Museum and Art Gallery]] first opened in November 1850 as \"The Royal Museum & Public Library\", as the first unconditionally free public library in England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/ewm/001ewm/024_sal_mayor/index.html |publisher=Manchesteronline |title=Eye witness in Manchester |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014184824/http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/ewm/001ewm/024_sal_mayor/index.html |archivedate=14 October 2007 }} Retrieved on 5 September 2008</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitsalford.info/whattosee/heritage/industrialheritage/industrialheritage1st.htm|publisher=visitsalford.info|title=1st in Salford|accessdate=19 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107050723/http://www.visitsalford.info/whattosee/heritage/industrialheritage/industrialheritage1st.htm|archive-date=7 January 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The library in [[Castlefield|Campfield]], [[Manchester]] was the first library to operate a ''free'' lending library without subscription in 1852.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2238494.stm | work=BBC News | title=Anniversary of first public library | date=5 September 2002 | accessdate=14 April 2010}}</ref> [[Norwich]] lays claims to being the first municipality to adopt the Public Libraries Act 1850 (which allowed any municipal borough with a population of 100,000 or more to introduce a halfpenny rate to establish public libraries \u2013 although not to buy books).

They contributed their own collections of books, conducted lengthy fund raising campaigns for buildings, and lobbied within their communities for financial support for libraries, as well as with legislatures and the [[Carnegie Library]] Endowment founded in the 20th century.<ref>Paula D.

Carnegie, who made his fortune largely in steel production and construction, devoted a great deal of his fortune to philanthropy. Carnegie alone built over 2000 libraries in the US, 660 [[Carnegie library|Carnegie Libraries]] in Britain, in addition to many more in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Theodore |title=Carnegie Libraries across America |publisher=Preservation Press |location=Washington |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-471-14422-9 }}</ref> Carnegie also funded academic libraries, favoring small schools and schools with African American students.  \"In 1899, Pennsylvania State College became the first college to receive Carnegie funding ($150,000) and their library was constructed in 1903.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ryan |first1=S |title='An Idea Likely Too Big': John B.

Carnegie listed universities, libraries, medical centers, public parks, meeting and concert halls, public baths, and churches as seven areas of particular importance for philanthropic endeavors. Carnegie did not assume full responsibility for the construction of new libraries and library branches; rather, he stipulated that communities provide sites for libraries, and governments commit to providing salaries for staff and maintaining the libraries. Additionally, Carnegie libraries could not rely solely on private funds, but required public funds as well. This ensured that the libraries would be a part of the community and continue to receive funding after the initial donation. In total, Carnegie donated $40 million to the construction of 1,670 public library buildings in the United States. Additionally, Carnegie funded construction for more than 100 academic libraries in the United States..<ref>{{cite book | last = Jones | first = Theodore | title = Carnegie Libraries across America | publisher = Preservation Press | location = Washington | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-471-14422-3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Murray |first1=Stuart A.

The earliest established library started by and for African Americans in the US was the Philadelphia Library Company of Colored Persons. By 1838, its collection included 600 volumes, as well as pamphlets and maps. Members could read independently or follow a scheduled course of study. \n\nThe nineteenth century was a fruitful time for African American literary societies. As well as a creating space for a black literary tradition, these societies provided libraries to their members, often through subscriptions. They were an important beginning in library access for African Americans in the United States when they were excluded from larger white literary societies. African American literary societies included the [[Bethel Literary and Historical Society]], Philadelphia Library Company of Colored Persons already mentioned. Additional societies that held an important role in library history included the Banneker Institute of the City of Philadelphia which began in 1854 and, within three years, had a library that compared to that of the Philadelphia Library Company of Colored Persons, which in 1841 recorded a collection of almost 600 books.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Tony|title=The Banneker Literary Institute of Philadelphia: African American Intellectual Activism before the War of the Slaveholders' Rebellion|url=|journal=The Journal of African American History|volume=87|issue=3|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.2307/1562480|jstor=1562480|year=2002}}</ref> There were also literary societies created specifically by and for black women such as the Female Literary Association which started in Philadelphia in 1831 and included the role of a librarian in its constitution, who would \u201chave charge of all books belonging to the Association, and after each meeting, take care that they be placed in the Library.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=Black Women in America|last=Bethel|first=Kathleen|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780195371307|editor-last=Clark Hine|editor-first=Darlene|edition=Second|location=|pages=|chapter=Librarianship}}</ref> Much of the literature focuses on Philadelphia seemingly due to the many literary societies found there and the documentation that has been preserved about them, but there were many throughout the country. The Phoenix Society was one such society, which began in New York in 1833 with one of the founding goals being to \u2018\u2018establish circulating libraries . . . for the use of people of colour on very moderate pay\u201d; within eight months of their inception\u2014by December 1833\u2014they had succeeded in opening a library and reading room.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Forgotten readers : recovering the lost history of African American literary societies|last=McHenry|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2002|isbn=9780822384144|location=Durham|pages=52\u201353|chapter=\u201cDreaded Eloquence\u201d: The Origins and Rise of African American Literary Societies}}</ref> \n\nThe philanthropy of [[Andrew Carnegie]] had a tremendous impact upon the ability of \"Colored Library Associations\" being able to gain access to funding in order to build libraries in and for their communities. In the south, \"African Americans living in such cities as Charlotte, North Carolina, and Houston even had access to black public libraries that had independent governance.\" <ref>Wheeler, M., Johnson-Houston, D., & Walker, B.E. (2004). A Brief History of Library Service to African Americans. American Libraries, 35(2), 42</ref> In Houston, a library was established inside a school in 1909, then later it was relocated to a new building in 1913 with the help of [[Carnegie Corporation]] Funds.<ref>Wheeler, M., Johnson-Houston, D., & Walker, B.E. (2004). A Brief History of Library Service to African Americans. American Libraries, 35(2), 42</ref> Thanks to the support of Carnegie and his corporation, many cities were able to construct and maintain African American libraries. \n\nDr. [[William E. B. Du Bois]] also attributed the movement for Negro libraries to the \"natural desire (of the race) for books\".<ref>Du Bois, W. E. (1909). 14th Annual Conference for the Study of the Negro Problems. Efforts for Social Betterment Among Negro Americans. Atlanta: Atlanta University Press</ref> \n\nAnother funder for building libraries, especially in African American communities in the South, was the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA). The WPA was part of the \u201cNew Deal\u201d created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his administration. The \u201cNew Deal\u201d was meant to boost and invest in the American economy and infrastructure that was devastated by the Great Depression.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/works-progress-administration|title=Works Progress Administration (WPA)|last=Editors|first=History com|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> Services and access to funds was to be distributed to all areas, but especially regions hit the hardest, such as the South. The South had been devastated by the Great Depression and racial divisions exacerbated the economic conditions. With nearly two-thirds of the population in the South being African Americans it was imperative that everyone have access to resources afforded through the WPA.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Gorman|first=Robert M.|date=1997|title=\u201cBlazing the Way: The WPA Library Service Demonstration Project in South Carolina.\u201d|url=|journal=Libraries and Culture|volume=32, no. 4|pages=427-455|via=JSTOR}}</ref> In 1935, the WPA created the library demonstration project. The project was created to encourage the development of libraries in underserved areas and to boost employment.<ref name=\":2\" /> With the help of WPA, African Americans were afforded more access to libraries and employment. For instance, in 1933 South Carolina had fifty-six public libraries and only four provided services to the African American community.<ref name=\":2\" /> Even with private libraries filled with donations, only 15 percent of the African American community in South Carolina had access to library services and materials.<ref name=\":2\" /> By 1937,the WPA had established a bookmobile for the African American Community in South Carolina.

For many of these buildings, the quality of the interior spaces, their lighting and atmosphere, was becoming more significant than the fa\u00e7ade design of the library building. Modernist architects like [[Alvar Aalto]] put great emphasis on the comfort and usability of library spaces. The Municipal Library he built 1958\u201362 for the German city of [[Wolfsburg]] features a great central room for which he used a series of specially designed skylights to bring in natural light, even though all the walls are covered with books.\n\n===21st century===\nIn the 21st Century, libraries continue to change and evolve to match new trends involving the way that patrons consume books and other media. More than ever, the 21st Century library is the digital library. As of 2016, over 90% of public libraries have e-book collections, and over 25% circulate e-readers or tablets. Librarians are increasingly responsible for both physical and digital collections. A digital collection can include sources created and distributed digitally, to physical documents scanned and provided in a digital format. Digital libraries bring with them a whole host of new challenges such as: how the resources are distributed to patrons, whether or not authentication is required and the compatibility of patron hardware or software. \n\nAdditionally new trends attract patrons to libraries for purposes other than books. The Maker Movement and Maker-spaces are a new trend designed to foster creativity and provide a space for library users to tinker, invent and socialize. Maker-spaces feature both high and low-tech media, though many focus on advanced technology such as 3D Printers or Virtual Reality and making them available to users who might normally not have access to them.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McCook|first=Kathleen de la Pe\u00f1a|title=Introduction to Public Librarianship|publisher=ALA Neal-Schuman|year=2018|isbn=978-0-8389-1506-6|location=Chicago|pages=}}</ref> Many might also feature Video and Audio recording studios, complete with advanced computers to help users edit their creations.\n\nA challenge commonly faced by 21st century libraries are budget-cuts, forcing librarians to become more efficient in the management of their funds and more vocal in the advocacy of their libraries.

The four characters are Adolf Hitler, [[Gustav Krupp]], [[Gregor Strasser]] and Ernst R\u00f6hm (from whose text the play's title is taken)<!-- unclear what text -->. The play takes place over the summer of 1934 at the Berlin chancellery.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe play begins with Hitler giving a speech to the people of Germany, during which his two friends Krupp and R\u00f6hm come in to watch the speech. They talk to each other and discuss the \"iron bouquet\" Krupp metaphorically used to set into motion great advancements in human history, including shaping Hitler into a better leader.\n\nLater in the play, Strasser enters the scene. He has a bad relationship with R\u00f6hm. Krupp describes their relationship as that of a \"cat and dog\". Strasser then argues that the war profits need to be returned to the country. R\u00f6hm gets mad, calling him a [[Socialism|socialist]]. After the speech is finished, Hitler returns to the group awaiting him and gets their reports about the peoples' reaction to the speech, all of them telling him it was outstanding, even calling Hitler an artist.\n\nHitler then talks to R\u00f6hm alone about how they were so close to each other, but now that he is so busy running the country and doesn't have the time anymore to talk about the \"good old days\" with one of his trusted friends. Hitler then decides to get away from his political life for the day. And so R\u00f6hm decides to train Hitler on everything he needs to know about being a military leader.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Yukio Mishima}}\n\n[[Category:1968 plays]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Adolf Hitler]]\n[[Category:Plays by Yukio Mishima]]\n\n\n{{1960s-play-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Italic title}}\n{{Infobox play\n|name       = My Friend Hitler\n|image      = \n|image_size = \n|caption    = \n|writer     = [[Yukio Mishima]]<ref>{{cite\u00a0web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2003/02/09/books/life-was-but-a-stage-for-japans-troubled-genius/#.XcvSXa8lGJA|title=Life was but a stage for Japan's troubled genius|website=[[The Japan Times]]|date\u00a0=|author=Donald Richie}}</ref>\u00a0\n|chorus     = \n|characters = \n|mute       = \n|setting    = \n|premiere   = 1968\n|place      = \n|orig_lang  = \n|series     = \n|subject    = \n|genre      = neoclassical drama\n|web        = \n}}\n\n{{Nihongo|'''''My Friend Hitler'''''|\u308f\u304c\u53cb\u30d2\u30c3\u30c8\u30e9\u30fc|Waga Tomo Hittor\u0101}} is a 1968 neoclassical drama<ref name=\"Nara2007\">{{cite book|author=Hiroshi Nara|title=Inexorable Modernity: Japan's Grappling with Modernity in the Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMMusu0O4zAC&pg=PA151|year=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-1842-9|pages=151\u2013}}</ref> written and produced by Japanese writer [[Yukio Mishima]].<ref name=\"Jr.Liu2014\">{{cite book|author1=Kevin J.

However, more of his influence for Hitler\u2019s character came from one of his other plays {{Which|date=August 2017}}. Since Mishima's other play ''Sado Koshaku fujin ([[Madame de Sade]])'' stars an all-female cast, he wanted ''My Friend Hitler'' to be an all-male cast. According to Mishima himself he wanted to refute criticism claiming that he could not portray both genders.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=My Friend Hitler and Other Plays by Yukio Mishima|last=Mishima|first=Yukio|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780231126335|location=New York|pages=112\u2013113pp pages}}</ref>\n\n== About the play ==\nThe play is written in [[Third-person perspective|third person]]. The four characters are Adolf Hitler, [[Gustav Krupp]], [[Gregor Strasser]] and Ernst R\u00f6hm (from whose text the play's title is taken)<!-- unclear what text -->. The play takes place over the summer of 1934 at the Berlin chancellery.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe play begins with Hitler giving a speech to the people of Germany, during which his two friends Krupp and R\u00f6hm come in to watch the speech. They talk to each other and discuss the \"iron bouquet\" Krupp metaphorically used to set into motion great advancements in human history, including shaping Hitler into a better leader.\n\nLater in the play, Strasser enters the scene. He has a bad relationship with R\u00f6hm. Krupp describes their relationship as that of a \"cat and dog\". Strasser then argues that the war profits need to be returned to the country. R\u00f6hm gets mad, calling him a [[Socialism|socialist]]. After the speech is finished, Hitler returns to the group awaiting him and gets their reports about the peoples' reaction to the speech, all of them telling him it was outstanding, even calling Hitler an artist.\n\nHitler then talks to R\u00f6hm alone about how they were so close to each other, but now that he is so busy running the country and doesn't have the time anymore to talk about the \"good old days\" with one of his trusted friends. Hitler then decides to get away from his political life for the day. And so R\u00f6hm decides to train Hitler on everything he needs to know about being a military leader.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Yukio Mishima}}\n\n[[Category:1968 plays]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Adolf Hitler]]\n[[Category:Japanese plays]]\n[[Category:Plays by Yukio Mishima]]\n\n\n{{1960s-play-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removing fromCategory:Japanese playsusingCat-a-lot", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Friend_Hitler"}
