1939, is a [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[political party]] in [[Mexico]], one of the four main [[List of political parties in Mexico|political parties in Mexico]]. Since the 1980s, it has been an important political party winning local, state, and national elections. In [[2000 Mexican general election|2000]], PAN candidate [[Vicente Fox]] was elected president for a six-year term; in 2006, PAN candidate [[Felipe Calder\u00f3n]] succeeded Fox in the presidency. During the period 2000\u20132012, PAN was the strongest party in both houses of the [[Congress of the Union]] (the federal legislature) but lacked a majority in either house. In the [[2006 Mexican general election|2006 legislative elections]] the party won 207 out of 500 seats in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Mexico|Chamber of Deputies]] and 52 out of 128 [[Senate of Mexico|Senators]]. In the [[2012 Mexican general election|2012 legislative elections]], the PAN won 38 seats in the Senate, and 114 seats in the Chamber of Deputies.<ref name=\"crsseelke\">{{cite web|last=Seelke|first=Claire|title=Mexico's 2012 Elections|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42548.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service}}</ref> The members of this party are colloquially called ''Panistas''.\n\nNotoriously, the two Presidents of the Republic that have emerged from the PAN (Vicente Fox and Felipe Calder\u00f3n) have both left the party Fox has supported PRI presidential candidates in 2012 and 2018, while Calder\u00f3n has created his own party called \"M\u00e9xico Libre\".\n\n==History==\n===20th century===\n{{Christian Democracy sidebar}}\n{{Conservatism sidebar}}\n\n====Founding====\n[[Image:Manuel Gomez Morin.jpg|left|thumb|[[Manuel G\u00f3mez Mor\u00edn]], founder of the PAN in 1939]]\nThe National Action Party was founded in 1939 by [[Manuel G\u00f3mez Mor\u00edn]], who had held a number of important government posts in the 1920s and 1930s. He saw the need for the creation of a permanent political party rather than an ephemeral organization to oppose the expansion of power by the post-revolutionary Mexican state.<ref>[[Soledad Loaeza]], \"Partido de Acci\u00f3n Nacional (PAN)\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 2, p. 1048. Chicago: Fitzroy and Dearborn 1997.</ref><ref>Vikram K. Chand, ''Mexico\u2019s Political Awakening.'' Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press 2001.</ref> When G\u00f3mez Mor\u00edn was rector of [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM]] between 1933 and 1935, the government attempted to impose socialist education. In defending academic freedom, G\u00f3mez Mor\u00edn forged connections with individuals and groups that later came together in the foundation of the PAN in September 1939. The [[Jesuit]] student organization, Uni\u00f3n Nacional de Estudiantes Cat\u00f3licos (UNEC), provided a well-organized network of adherents who successfully fought the imposition of a particular ideological view by the state. G\u00f3mez Mor\u00edn was not himself a militant Catholic, but he was a devout believer who rejected liberalism and individualism.<ref>Loaeza, \"Partido de Acci\u00f3n Nacional\", p. 1049.</ref> In 1939, G\u00f3mez Mor\u00edn and a significant number of UNEC's leadership came together to found the PAN. The PAN's first executive committee and committees on political action and doctrine also had former Catholic student activists, including [[Luis Calder\u00f3n Vega]], the father of [[Felipe Calder\u00f3n]], who was elected President of Mexico in 2006.<ref>Espinosa, ''Jesuit Student Groups'', p. 73</ref> The PAN's \u201cDoctrine of National Action\u201d was strongly influenced by Catholic social doctrine articulated in ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (1891) and ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' (1931) and rejected [[Marxism|Marxist]] models of [[Class conflict|class warfare]].<ref>Espinosa, ''Jesuit Student Groups'', p.  73.</ref>  The PAN's newspaper, ''La Naci\u00f3n'' was founded by another former UNEC member, Carlos S\u00e9ptien Garc\u00eda.<ref name=\"Espinosa, p. 73\">Espinosa, ''Jesuit Student Groups'', p. 73.</ref>\n\nEfra\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez Luna, a former member of the Mexican Catholic Student Union (Uni\u00f3n Nacional de Estudiantes Cat\u00f3licos) (UNEC), a long-time militant Catholic and practicing lawyer from Guadalajara, helped broker the party's informal alliance with the Catholic Church. However, the relationship between the PAN and the Catholic Church was not without tension. The party's founder G\u00f3mez Mor\u00edn was leery of clerical oversight of the party, although its members were mainly urban Catholic professionals and businessmen.  For its part, the Church hierarchy did not want to identify itself with a particular political party, since the [[Constitution of 1917]] forbade it. In the 1950s, the PAN, which had been seen to be Catholic in its makeup, became more ideologically secular.<ref name=\"Espinosa, p. 73\"/>\n\n====Electoral results====\nThe PAN initially was a party of \u201ccivic example\u201d, an independent loyal opposition that generally did not win elections at any level.  However, in the 1980s it began a transformation to a political power, beginning at the local and state levels in the North of Mexico.<ref>Vikram K. Chand, ''Mexico\u2019s Political Awakening'', see especially chapter 3 \u201cThe Transformation of Mexico\u2019s National Action Party (PAN): From Civic Example to Political Power.\u201d</ref> A split in the PAN occurred in 1977, with the pro-Catholic faction and the more secular wing splitting. The PAN had updated its positions following Vatican II, toward a greater affinity for the poor; however, more traditional Catholics were critical of that stance and nonreligious groups were also in opposition, since they wanted the party to be less explicitly Catholic and draw in more urban professionals and business groups, who would vote for a nonreligious opposition party. The conflict came to a head, and in 1977 the progressive Catholic wing left the party.<ref>Loaeza, \"Partido de Acci\u00f3n Nacional\", p. 1051.</ref> The party ran no presidential candidate in 1976.\n\nThe PAN had strength in Northern Mexico and its candidates had won elections earlier on, but these victories were small in comparison to those of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]]. In 1946, PAN members [[:es:Miguel Ram\u00edrez Mungu\u00eda|Miguel Ram\u00edrez Mungu\u00eda]] ([[Tac\u00e1mbaro]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]]), [[:es:Juan Guti\u00e9rrez Lascurain|Juan Guti\u00e9rrez Lascurain]] ([[Mexican Federal District|Federal District]]), [[Antonio L. Rodr\u00edguez]] ([[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]) and [[Aquiles Elorduy Garc\u00eda]] ([[Aguascalientes]]) became the first four federal deputies from the opposition in post-revolutionary Mexico. The following year [[Manuel Torres Serran\u00eda]] from [[Quiroga, Michoac\u00e1n|Quiroga]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]] became the party's first [[municipal president]] and [[Alfonso Hern\u00e1ndez S\u00e1nchez]] (from [[Zamora, Michoac\u00e1n|Zamora]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]]) its first state deputy.<ref name=\"pan.org.mx\">[http://www.pan.org.mx/?P=363 History of the PAN. PAN official website].</ref> In 1962, [[Rosario Alcal\u00e1]] (Aguascalientes) became the first female candidate for state governor and two years later [[Florentina Villalobos Chaparro]] ([[Parral, Chihuahua|Parral]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]) became the first female federal deputy. In 1967 [[Norma Villarreal de Zambrano]] ([[San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda]], [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]) became the first female municipal president.\n\n[[File:Logo Acci\u00f3n Juvenil.png|right|thumb|Acci\u00f3n Juvenil official logo]]\nUntil the 1980s, the PAN was a weak opposition party that was considered pro-Catholic and pro-business, but never garnered many votes. Its strength, however, was that it was pro-democracy and pro-rule of law, so that its political profile was in contrast to the dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) that was widely and increasingly seen as corrupt. The PAN came to be viewed as viable opposition party for a wider range of voters as it became more secular and as Mexicans increasingly moved to cities. As the PAN increasingly called for end of fraud in Mexican elections, it appealed to a wider range of people.\n\nIn 1988, the newly created [[Assembly of Representatives of the Federal District]] had, for the first time, members of the PAN. In 1989, [[Ernesto Ruffo Appel]] (Baja California) became  the first opposition governor. Two years later, his future successor in the Baja California government, [[H\u00e9ctor Ter\u00e1n Ter\u00e1n]], became the first federal senator from the PAN. From 1992 to 2000, PAN candidates won the elections for governorships in [[Guanajuato]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Jalisco]], [[Quer\u00e9taro]], [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], [[Aguascalientes]], [[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]] and [[Morelos]].<ref name=\"pan.org.mx\"/>\n\n===21st century===\n====Electoral victory for the presidency, 2000====\n[[File:Vicente Fox 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vicente Fox]], first PANista to be elected president of Mexico (2000-06), ended more than 70 years of PRI rule.]]\nIn the [[2000 Mexican general election|2000 presidential elections]], the candidate of the ''[[Alianza por el Cambio]]'' (\"Alliance for Change\"), formed by the PAN and the [[Ecologist Green Party of Mexico]] (PVEM), [[Vicente Fox Quesada]] won 42.5% of the popular vote and was elected [[president of Mexico]]. Fox was the first opposition candidate to defeat the candidate of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) and its precursors after 71 years. It was a significant victory not only for the PAN, but Mexican democracy.\n\nIn the [[2000 Mexican general election|senate elections]] of the same date, the Alliance won 46 out of 128 seats in the Senate. The Alliance broke off the following year and the PVEM has since participated together with the PRI in most elections.  \n[[File:Felipe Calderon H.jpg|thumb|right|[[Felipe Calder\u00f3n]], President of Mexico (2006-12)]]\n[[File:Mexico Governors Map.svg|thumb|360px|left|{{legend|#FF0000|[[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]]}}{{legend|#0000FF|PAN}}{{legend|#FFFF00|[[Party of the Democratic Revolution|PRD]]}}{{Legend|#FF6600|[[Citizens' Movement (Mexico)|PMC]]{{legend|#32CD32|[[Ecologist Green Party of Mexico|PVEM]]}}}}State governments by party (2017)]]\n\nIn the [[2003 Mexican elections|2003 mid-term elections]], the party won 30.74% of the popular vote and 153 out of 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. In 2003, the PAN lost the governorship of [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]] to the PRI and, the following year, failed to win back the state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] from the PRI. Coupled with a bitterly fought election in [[Colima]] that was cancelled and later re-run, these developments were interpreted by some political analysts to be a significant rejection of the PAN in advance of the [[2006 Mexican general election|2006 presidential election]]. In contrast, 2004 did see the PAN win for the first time in [[Tlaxcala]], in a state that would not normally be considered PAN territory, although its candidate was a member of the PRI until a few months before the elections. It also managed to hold on to [[Quer\u00e9taro]] (by a mere 3% margin against the PRI) and [[Aguascalientes]] (although in 2007, it lost most of the municipalities and the local Congress to the PRI). However, in 2005 the PAN lost the elections for the state government of [[Mexico State]] and [[Nayarit]] to the PRI. The former was considered one of the most important elections in the country because of the number of voters involved, which is higher than the elections for head of government of the [[Mexican Federal District|Federal District]]. (See: [[2003 Mexican elections]], [[2004 Mexican elections]] and [[2005 Mexican elections]] for results.)\n\nSignificantly in the 2006 [[2006 Mexican general election|presidential election in 2006]], the PAN candidate [[Felipe Calder\u00f3n]] was elected to succeed Vicente Fox. Calder\u00f3n was the son of one of the founders of the PAN, and was himself a former party president. He was selected as the PAN's candidate, after beating his opponents [[Santiago Creel]] ([[Secretary of the Interior (Mexico)|Secretary of the Interior]] during Fox's term) and [[Alberto C\u00e1rdenas]] (former [[governor of Jalisco]]) in every voting round in the party primaries. On July 2, 2006, Felipe Calder\u00f3n secured a plurality of the votes cast. Finishing less than one percent behind was [[Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador]], who challenged the results of the election on possible grounds of electoral fraud. In addition to the presidency, the PAN won 206 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 52 in the Senate, securing it the largest single party blocs in both houses.\n\nIn 2007, the PAN lost the governorship and the majority in the [[Congress of Yucat\u00e1n|state congress of Yucat\u00e1n]] to the PRI as well as the municipal presidency of [[Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes|Aguascalientes]], but kept both the governorship and the majority in the [[Congress of Baja California|state congress of Baja California]]. The PRI also obtained more municipal presidents and local congresspeople in Chihuahua, Durango, Zacatecas, Aguascalientes, Chiapas and Oaxaca. The PRD obtained more posts than the PAN in Zacatecas, Chiapas and Oaxaca.\n\nIn 2009, the PAN held 33 seats in the Senate and 142 seats in the Chamber of deputies.<ref name=\"crsseelke\" />\n\n====Return of the PRI to presidency====\nIn 2012, the PAN lost the Presidential Election to [[Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto]]  of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]]. They also won 38 seats in the Senate (a gain of 3 seats), and 114 seats in the Chamber of Deputies (a loss of 28 seats).<ref name=\"crsseelke\" /> The government of president of Mexico [[Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto|Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto (EPN)]] has faced multiple scandals, and allegations of corruption. Reforma who has run a surveys of presidential approval since 1995, revealed EPN had received a mere 12% approval rating, the lowest since they started to survey for presidential approval. The second lowest approval was for the [[Ernesto Zedillo]] (1994-2000), also from the PRI. It also revealed that both presidents elected from National Action Party (PAN), [[Vicente Fox]] (2000-2006) and [[Felipe Calderon]] (2006-2012), both had higher presidential approvals than the PRI presidents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/why-mexican-president-enrique-pe-nieto-so-unpopular-n640611|title=Why Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto is so unpopular|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Ideology==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2017}}\n[[File:Diego_Fernandez_de_Cevallos.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Diego Fernandez de Cevallos]]]]\nThe PAN has been linked to a [[Conservatism|conservative]] stance in Mexican politics since its inception, but the party does not consider itself a fundamentally conservative party. The party ideology, at least in principle, is that of \"National Action\" which rejects a fundamental adherence to left- or right-wing politics or policies, instead requiring the adoption of such policies as correspond to the problems faced by the nation at any given moment. Thus both right- and left-wing policies may be considered equally carefully in formulation of national policy.\n\nThis theory of National Action politics, rejecting a fundamental adherence to right or left, is held within a strongly Christian context, and falls under the umbrella of [[Christian democracy]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe party theory was largely developed by early figures such as [[Manuel G\u00f3mez Mor\u00edn|G\u00f3mez Mor\u00edn]] and his associates. However, some observers consider the PAN claim to National Action politics to be weakened by the apparent persistent predominance of conservatism in PAN policy in practice.

1939, is a [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[political party]] in [[Mexico]], one of the four main [[List of political parties in Mexico|political parties in Mexico]]. Since the 1980s, it has been an important political party winning local, state, and national elections. In [[2000 Mexican general election|2000]], PAN candidate [[Vicente Fox]] was elected president for a six-year term; in 2006, PAN candidate [[Felipe Calder\u00f3n]] succeeded Fox in the presidency. During the period 2000\u20132012, PAN was the strongest party in both houses of the [[Congress of the Union]] (the federal legislature) but lacked a majority in either house. In the [[2006 Mexican general election|2006 legislative elections]] the party won 207 out of 500 seats in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Mexico|Chamber of Deputies]] and 52 out of 128 [[Senate of Mexico|Senators]]. In the [[2012 Mexican general election|2012 legislative elections]], the PAN won 38 seats in the Senate, and 114 seats in the Chamber of Deputies.<ref name=\"crsseelke\">{{cite web|last=Seelke|first=Claire|title=Mexico's 2012 Elections|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42548.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service}}</ref> The members of this party are colloquially called ''Panistas''.\n\nNotoriously, the two Presidents of the Republic that have emerged from the PAN (Vicente Fox and Felipe Calder\u00f3n) have both left the PAN. Fox has supported PRI presidential candidates in 2012 and 2018, while Calder\u00f3n has created his own party called \"M\u00e9xico Libre\".\n\n==History==\n===20th century===\n{{Christian Democracy sidebar}}\n{{Conservatism sidebar}}\n\n====Founding====\n[[Image:Manuel Gomez Morin.jpg|left|thumb|[[Manuel G\u00f3mez Mor\u00edn]], founder of the PAN in 1939]]\nThe National Action Party was founded in 1939 by [[Manuel G\u00f3mez Mor\u00edn]], who had held a number of important government posts in the 1920s and 1930s. He saw the need for the creation of a permanent political party rather than an ephemeral organization to oppose the expansion of power by the post-revolutionary Mexican state.<ref>[[Soledad Loaeza]], \"Partido de Acci\u00f3n Nacional (PAN)\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 2, p. 1048. Chicago: Fitzroy and Dearborn 1997.</ref><ref>Vikram K. Chand, ''Mexico\u2019s Political Awakening.'' Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press 2001.</ref> When G\u00f3mez Mor\u00edn was rector of [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM]] between 1933 and 1935, the government attempted to impose socialist education. In defending academic freedom, G\u00f3mez Mor\u00edn forged connections with individuals and groups that later came together in the foundation of the PAN in September 1939. The [[Jesuit]] student organization, Uni\u00f3n Nacional de Estudiantes Cat\u00f3licos (UNEC), provided a well-organized network of adherents who successfully fought the imposition of a particular ideological view by the state. G\u00f3mez Mor\u00edn was not himself a militant Catholic, but he was a devout believer who rejected liberalism and individualism.<ref>Loaeza, \"Partido de Acci\u00f3n Nacional\", p. 1049.</ref> In 1939, G\u00f3mez Mor\u00edn and a significant number of UNEC's leadership came together to found the PAN. The PAN's first executive committee and committees on political action and doctrine also had former Catholic student activists, including [[Luis Calder\u00f3n Vega]], the father of [[Felipe Calder\u00f3n]], who was elected President of Mexico in 2006.<ref>Espinosa, ''Jesuit Student Groups'', p. 73</ref> The PAN's \u201cDoctrine of National Action\u201d was strongly influenced by Catholic social doctrine articulated in ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (1891) and ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' (1931) and rejected [[Marxism|Marxist]] models of [[Class conflict|class warfare]].<ref>Espinosa, ''Jesuit Student Groups'', p.  73.</ref>  The PAN's newspaper, ''La Naci\u00f3n'' was founded by another former UNEC member, Carlos S\u00e9ptien Garc\u00eda.<ref name=\"Espinosa, p. 73\">Espinosa, ''Jesuit Student Groups'', p. 73.</ref>\n\nEfra\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez Luna, a former member of the Mexican Catholic Student Union (Uni\u00f3n Nacional de Estudiantes Cat\u00f3licos) (UNEC), a long-time militant Catholic and practicing lawyer from Guadalajara, helped broker the party's informal alliance with the Catholic Church. However, the relationship between the PAN and the Catholic Church was not without tension. The party's founder G\u00f3mez Mor\u00edn was leery of clerical oversight of the party, although its members were mainly urban Catholic professionals and businessmen.  For its part, the Church hierarchy did not want to identify itself with a particular political party, since the [[Constitution of 1917]] forbade it. In the 1950s, the PAN, which had been seen to be Catholic in its makeup, became more ideologically secular.<ref name=\"Espinosa, p. 73\"/>\n\n====Electoral results====\nThe PAN initially was a party of \u201ccivic example\u201d, an independent loyal opposition that generally did not win elections at any level.  However, in the 1980s it began a transformation to a political power, beginning at the local and state levels in the North of Mexico.<ref>Vikram K. Chand, ''Mexico\u2019s Political Awakening'', see especially chapter 3 \u201cThe Transformation of Mexico\u2019s National Action Party (PAN): From Civic Example to Political Power.\u201d</ref> A split in the PAN occurred in 1977, with the pro-Catholic faction and the more secular wing splitting. The PAN had updated its positions following Vatican II, toward a greater affinity for the poor; however, more traditional Catholics were critical of that stance and nonreligious groups were also in opposition, since they wanted the party to be less explicitly Catholic and draw in more urban professionals and business groups, who would vote for a nonreligious opposition party. The conflict came to a head, and in 1977 the progressive Catholic wing left the party.<ref>Loaeza, \"Partido de Acci\u00f3n Nacional\", p. 1051.</ref> The party ran no presidential candidate in 1976.\n\nThe PAN had strength in Northern Mexico and its candidates had won elections earlier on, but these victories were small in comparison to those of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]]. In 1946, PAN members [[:es:Miguel Ram\u00edrez Mungu\u00eda|Miguel Ram\u00edrez Mungu\u00eda]] ([[Tac\u00e1mbaro]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]]), [[:es:Juan Guti\u00e9rrez Lascurain|Juan Guti\u00e9rrez Lascurain]] ([[Mexican Federal District|Federal District]]), [[Antonio L. Rodr\u00edguez]] ([[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]) and [[Aquiles Elorduy Garc\u00eda]] ([[Aguascalientes]]) became the first four federal deputies from the opposition in post-revolutionary Mexico. The following year [[Manuel Torres Serran\u00eda]] from [[Quiroga, Michoac\u00e1n|Quiroga]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]] became the party's first [[municipal president]] and [[Alfonso Hern\u00e1ndez S\u00e1nchez]] (from [[Zamora, Michoac\u00e1n|Zamora]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]]) its first state deputy.<ref name=\"pan.org.mx\">[http://www.pan.org.mx/?P=363 History of the PAN. PAN official website].</ref> In 1962, [[Rosario Alcal\u00e1]] (Aguascalientes) became the first female candidate for state governor and two years later [[Florentina Villalobos Chaparro]] ([[Parral, Chihuahua|Parral]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]) became the first female federal deputy. In 1967 [[Norma Villarreal de Zambrano]] ([[San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda]], [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]) became the first female municipal president.\n\n[[File:Logo Acci\u00f3n Juvenil.png|right|thumb|Acci\u00f3n Juvenil official logo]]\nUntil the 1980s, the PAN was a weak opposition party that was considered pro-Catholic and pro-business, but never garnered many votes. Its strength, however, was that it was pro-democracy and pro-rule of law, so that its political profile was in contrast to the dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) that was widely and increasingly seen as corrupt. The PAN came to be viewed as viable opposition party for a wider range of voters as it became more secular and as Mexicans increasingly moved to cities. As the PAN increasingly called for end of fraud in Mexican elections, it appealed to a wider range of people.\n\nIn 1988, the newly created [[Assembly of Representatives of the Federal District]] had, for the first time, members of the PAN. In 1989, [[Ernesto Ruffo Appel]] (Baja California) became  the first opposition governor. Two years later, his future successor in the Baja California government, [[H\u00e9ctor Ter\u00e1n Ter\u00e1n]], became the first federal senator from the PAN. From 1992 to 2000, PAN candidates won the elections for governorships in [[Guanajuato]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Jalisco]], [[Quer\u00e9taro]], [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], [[Aguascalientes]], [[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]] and [[Morelos]].<ref name=\"pan.org.mx\"/>\n\n===21st century===\n====Electoral victory for the presidency, 2000====\n[[File:Vicente Fox 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vicente Fox]], first PANista to be elected president of Mexico (2000-06), ended more than 70 years of PRI rule.]]\nIn the [[2000 Mexican general election|2000 presidential elections]], the candidate of the ''[[Alianza por el Cambio]]'' (\"Alliance for Change\"), formed by the PAN and the [[Ecologist Green Party of Mexico]] (PVEM), [[Vicente Fox Quesada]] won 42.5% of the popular vote and was elected [[president of Mexico]]. Fox was the first opposition candidate to defeat the candidate of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) and its precursors after 71 years. It was a significant victory not only for the PAN, but Mexican democracy.\n\nIn the [[2000 Mexican general election|senate elections]] of the same date, the Alliance won 46 out of 128 seats in the Senate. The Alliance broke off the following year and the PVEM has since participated together with the PRI in most elections.  \n[[File:Felipe Calderon H.jpg|thumb|right|[[Felipe Calder\u00f3n]], President of Mexico (2006-12)]]\n[[File:Mexico Governors Map.svg|thumb|360px|left|{{legend|#FF0000|[[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]]}}{{legend|#0000FF|PAN}}{{legend|#FFFF00|[[Party of the Democratic Revolution|PRD]]}}{{Legend|#FF6600|[[Citizens' Movement (Mexico)|PMC]]{{legend|#32CD32|[[Ecologist Green Party of Mexico|PVEM]]}}}}State governments by party (2017)]]\n\nIn the [[2003 Mexican elections|2003 mid-term elections]], the party won 30.74% of the popular vote and 153 out of 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. In 2003, the PAN lost the governorship of [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]] to the PRI and, the following year, failed to win back the state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] from the PRI. Coupled with a bitterly fought election in [[Colima]] that was cancelled and later re-run, these developments were interpreted by some political analysts to be a significant rejection of the PAN in advance of the [[2006 Mexican general election|2006 presidential election]]. In contrast, 2004 did see the PAN win for the first time in [[Tlaxcala]], in a state that would not normally be considered PAN territory, although its candidate was a member of the PRI until a few months before the elections. It also managed to hold on to [[Quer\u00e9taro]] (by a mere 3% margin against the PRI) and [[Aguascalientes]] (although in 2007, it lost most of the municipalities and the local Congress to the PRI). However, in 2005 the PAN lost the elections for the state government of [[Mexico State]] and [[Nayarit]] to the PRI. The former was considered one of the most important elections in the country because of the number of voters involved, which is higher than the elections for head of government of the [[Mexican Federal District|Federal District]]. (See: [[2003 Mexican elections]], [[2004 Mexican elections]] and [[2005 Mexican elections]] for results.)\n\nSignificantly in the 2006 [[2006 Mexican general election|presidential election in 2006]], the PAN candidate [[Felipe Calder\u00f3n]] was elected to succeed Vicente Fox. Calder\u00f3n was the son of one of the founders of the PAN, and was himself a former party president. He was selected as the PAN's candidate, after beating his opponents [[Santiago Creel]] ([[Secretary of the Interior (Mexico)|Secretary of the Interior]] during Fox's term) and [[Alberto C\u00e1rdenas]] (former [[governor of Jalisco]]) in every voting round in the party primaries. On July 2, 2006, Felipe Calder\u00f3n secured a plurality of the votes cast. Finishing less than one percent behind was [[Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador]], who challenged the results of the election on possible grounds of electoral fraud. In addition to the presidency, the PAN won 206 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 52 in the Senate, securing it the largest single party blocs in both houses.\n\nIn 2007, the PAN lost the governorship and the majority in the [[Congress of Yucat\u00e1n|state congress of Yucat\u00e1n]] to the PRI as well as the municipal presidency of [[Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes|Aguascalientes]], but kept both the governorship and the majority in the [[Congress of Baja California|state congress of Baja California]]. The PRI also obtained more municipal presidents and local congresspeople in Chihuahua, Durango, Zacatecas, Aguascalientes, Chiapas and Oaxaca. The PRD obtained more posts than the PAN in Zacatecas, Chiapas and Oaxaca.\n\nIn 2009, the PAN held 33 seats in the Senate and 142 seats in the Chamber of deputies.<ref name=\"crsseelke\" />\n\n====Return of the PRI to presidency====\nIn 2012, the PAN lost the Presidential Election to [[Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto]]  of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]]. They also won 38 seats in the Senate (a gain of 3 seats), and 114 seats in the Chamber of Deputies (a loss of 28 seats).<ref name=\"crsseelke\" /> The government of president of Mexico [[Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto|Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto (EPN)]] has faced multiple scandals, and allegations of corruption. Reforma who has run a surveys of presidential approval since 1995, revealed EPN had received a mere 12% approval rating, the lowest since they started to survey for presidential approval. The second lowest approval was for the [[Ernesto Zedillo]] (1994-2000), also from the PRI. It also revealed that both presidents elected from National Action Party (PAN), [[Vicente Fox]] (2000-2006) and [[Felipe Calderon]] (2006-2012), both had higher presidential approvals than the PRI presidents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/why-mexican-president-enrique-pe-nieto-so-unpopular-n640611|title=Why Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto is so unpopular|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Ideology==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2017}}\n[[File:Diego_Fernandez_de_Cevallos.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Diego Fernandez de Cevallos]]]]\nThe PAN has been linked to a [[Conservatism|conservative]] stance in Mexican politics since its inception, but the party does not consider itself a fundamentally conservative party. The party ideology, at least in principle, is that of \"National Action\" which rejects a fundamental adherence to left- or right-wing politics or policies, instead requiring the adoption of such policies as correspond to the problems faced by the nation at any given moment. Thus both right- and left-wing policies may be considered equally carefully in formulation of national policy.\n\nThis theory of National Action politics, rejecting a fundamental adherence to right or left, is held within a strongly Christian context, and falls under the umbrella of [[Christian democracy]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe party theory was largely developed by early figures such as [[Manuel G\u00f3mez Mor\u00edn|G\u00f3mez Mor\u00edn]] and his associates. However, some observers consider the PAN claim to National Action politics to be weakened by the apparent persistent predominance of conservatism in PAN policy in practice.

The series ran for five seasons and 100 episodes from May 29, 2006, to November 4, 2010, on PBS, with 30 contestants in that time. Although a sixth season was planned, with auditions taking place in January 2010, [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] announced on June 14, 2010, that the series would end due to lack of funding. In June 2008, the series received its first [[Emmy]] for Best Original Song for its theme. It previously aired reruns on the 24 hour PBS Kids Channel until November 2018\n\n==Production==\n''Fetch!'' was produced at [[WGBH-TV|WGBH Studios]] in Boston. Seasons were filmed about a year before they aired. Season four was the first season to be filmed in High Definition (HD) in 2009. Due to a lack of funding, WGBH announced that ''Fetch!'' would be canceled at the end of its fifth season, even though casting had been completed.\n\nThe challenges were filmed mostly in Boston (as well as other areas in the US State of [[Massachusetts]]) and various other parts of the [[United States Of America|USA]], depending on the challenges, during summertime when the children are out of school. The challenges, which were out on the field, are cut [[documentary]]-style, very similar to network reality TV shows.\n\nAfter the FETCHers finished filming the challenges, contestants acted in-studio, with the voice of Ruff. [[Jim Conroy]] traveled to [[Boston]] from [[New York City|New York]] for the two weeks they spent shooting in the studio. The fourth camera simply captured Conroy doing his lines as Ruff in the audio booth. The kids heard him in the studio and he heard their reactions in his headphones. Ruff's lines were the only lines that were scripted out, though he would sometimes ad-lib an answer to a question or comment from a FETCHer. Once the lines were recorded, the show went into editing, where the challenges were sorted into the show order.\n\nThen they were sent to Jim Conroy in New York City, to voice dialog for Ruff's animation. Once that was complete, it was sent back to WGBH where editors placed audio clips of the animated characters. Once all of this was done, the episode was sent to [[Global Mechanic]] to animate the show. One out of the four editors had an off-set four-week system in place where one of them was ready to send a cut of a new episode to [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada every Friday. This process took about six months to complete one season of the show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newenglandfilm.com/magazine/2009/10/ruff |title=Ruff |accessdate=October 24, 2015 |website=Newen Gland Film Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406014224/http://newenglandfilm.com/magazine/2009/10/ruff |archivedate=April 6, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Studio G set==\nStudio G is the studio for ''Fetch! with Ruff Ruffman''. Three segments of the show take place in the studio{{spaced ndash}}the intro, halftime quiz show, and \"Triumph Tally\". In season 1, the contestants recognized that Studio G looked like a [[Garage (residential)|garage]] and asked Ruff why, which in the episode, really annoyed Ruff and told them it was not a garage and that it was \"Studio G\". Over the course of the show's five seasons, the studio changed. For season 1 and 2, the studio was relatively unaltered, but sizable changes were made to the studio for season 3. The television through which the contestants communicate with Ruff was changed to a more current flat screen TV, and Ruff's owner parked her car, a dusty [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia]], in the studio. A flamingo and trees as well as a \"Studio G\" sign and a \"wall of fame\" displaying past Fetch! contestant season winners were added to the studio in season 2. In season 4, a new remote control mailbox was placed on the TV Screen, which popped out when a challenge was in the mailbox. Season 5's major renovation occurred during the season finale{{spaced ndash}}it became the Go Get It! studio (Studio P), and was a remodeled version of the Studio G set with new carpeting and pink furniture.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Fetch! with Ruff Ruffman characters}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nFetch! is a reality-based game show where young contestants (ages 10-14) take on various challenges to gain points.  During these challenges, the contestants must complete a variety of tasks assigned to them ahead of time (and on the fly) by Ruff and surrogates, depending on the situation. There is also an educational component, as contestants often must learn something (i.e. [[Astronomy]], [[Carpentry]], [[Engineering]], [[Food Science]], [[Biology]], [[Physics]], [[Mathematics]], etc.) in order to complete the task.\n\nNot all contestants leave the studio each episode to complete tasks. \"As determined by the Fetch 3000\"(according to Ruff), the contestants who remain behind in the studio participate in the \"Half-Time Quiz Show\", in which Ruff asks them up to ten questions with the limited time based on the activities of the contestants out on challenges. Out on challenges, contestants will have the potential to earn up to 100 points. The contestants in the studio will have a chance to win a maximum of 50 in the \"Half-Time Quiz Show\". The show has a ''Fetch Fairness Guarantee''; that every contestant will \"compete for the same number of points\" through thirteen challenges and six \"Half-time Quiz Shows\" before the final episode. Additionally, Ruff assigns \"Bone-us\" points (usually 5 or 10, but sometimes 15 or 20) to the stand-out contestants. On rare occasions, there is the possibility to earn more than 100 points (outside of any bonuses). The record for most points earned in one episode was 125, by Brian, Noah, and Khalil in episode 5, season 1. In Season 4, contestants are able to have 1/2 points (i.e. 515{{frac|1|2}} points). At the end of the season, a final point tally is conducted, with the winner of the tally being declared winner of that season to win the \"Grand Prize\".\n\nPrizes are not always desirable, and sometimes the prize holder winds up with a \"[[booby prize]]\"; for example, in \"Good Dancing and Bad Breath\", Anna and Brian had to dance a [[waltz]] in the studio. During the first season, the contestant had the choice of keeping the prize or giving it to a fellow contestant. During the remaining four seasons, there are two unknown prizes between which the winner chooses. The chosen prize may be \"mailed\" to the mailbox in Studio G, although occasionally large prizes are hidden elsewhere on the set. In one episode of Season 2, Rosario gave his prize to Nina, and in another, he gave it to Madi. In a season 4 episode, Sterling returned his prize to the mailbox.\n\n===Cultural references and guest stars===\n''Fetch! with Ruff Ruffman'' contains a considerable number of direct cultural references for a [[PBS Kids]] show, which makes up a large chunk of the series's comedic style. In the season 2 premiere, when Nina does a rather sloppy job at making chocolate candy, Ruff remarks that it is the \"[[Jackson Pollock]] candy.\" In the following episode, Ruff mentions that he likes [[REO Speedwagon]]. In Season 3, Episode 13, when Sam and Harsha throw sacks in a pail, Ruff makes a comment saying, \"I feel like Shaq in the free throw line\", making a reference to [[Shaquille O' Neal]]. In season 4, Episode 14, when Talia found a [[horseshoe crab]] while working on a shrimp boat, a horrified Ruff exclaimed, \"Looks like [[Darth Vader]]'s face with a billion legs coming out of it!\" In Episode 17 of the same season, Talia was starstruck when she discovered that she was holding [[Roger Federer]]'s [[tennis racket]]. In Episode 15 of Season 2, when the scuba instructors arrived at the beach, Ruff claimed that they were \"faster than [[Batman]]\" and that he \"hoped [Batman] was watching the show\". When Rubye and Marc in Season 5 learned skydiving signs, Ruff remarked that one of the signs looked like \"one of [[Beyonc\u00e9]]'s dance moves.\" In Season 2, Episode 4, when Rosario voiced Ruff for the first time, Ruff remarked: \"Is that Ruff Ruffman or [[Marge Simpson]]?\" In Season 4, Episode 16, when Ruff called Isaac, who was dressed as an old lady, he accidentally called him ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' and then corrects himself and says Mrs. Issacson. In Season 5, Episode 18, when Joe explained to the FETCHers, he told Michelle about the book she read. Michelle said: \"I believe that was [[Green Eggs and Ham]].\"\n\nThe show also had some guest stars. In season 1, [[Aaron Carter]] and the contestants all appeared in his new music video. In season 2, episode 2, Ruff sends Madi and Willie to meet the [[Blue Man Group]]. In Season 3, Episode 4, Sam meets Senator [[Edward Kennedy]]. In season 5, episode 4, Crush the [[sea turtle]] from the movie ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' makes an appearance via Ruff's Fetch 3000. [[Andrew Stanton]] reprises his role as Crush here. In episode 2 of season 4, the host of Design Squad [[Nathan Ball]] appeared in a pole vault challenge.<ref>{{Cite web|title = FETCH! .

In June 2008, the series received its first [[Emmy]] for Best Original Song for its theme. It previously aired reruns on the 24 hour PBS Kids Channel.\n\n==Production==\n''Fetch!'' was produced at [[WGBH-TV|WGBH Studios]] in Boston. Seasons were filmed about a year before they aired. Season four was the first season to be filmed in High Definition (HD) in 2009. Due to a lack of funding, WGBH announced that ''Fetch!'' would be canceled at the end of its fifth season, even though casting had been completed.\n\nThe challenges were filmed mostly in Boston (as well as other areas in the US State of [[Massachusetts]]) and various other parts of the [[United States Of America|USA]], depending on the challenges, during summertime when the children are out of school. The challenges, which were out on the field, are cut [[documentary]]-style, very similar to network reality TV shows.\n\nAfter the FETCHers finished filming the challenges, contestants acted in-studio, with the voice of Ruff. [[Jim Conroy]] traveled to [[Boston]] from [[New York City|New York]] for the two weeks they spent shooting in the studio. The fourth camera simply captured Conroy doing his lines as Ruff in the audio booth. The kids heard him in the studio and he heard their reactions in his headphones. Ruff's lines were the only lines that were scripted out, though he would sometimes ad-lib an answer to a question or comment from a FETCHer. Once the lines were recorded, the show went into editing, where the challenges were sorted into the show order.\n\nThen they were sent to Jim Conroy in New York City, to voice dialog for Ruff's animation. Once that was complete, it was sent back to WGBH where editors placed audio clips of the animated characters. Once all of this was done, the episode was sent to [[Global Mechanic]] to animate the show. One out of the four editors had an off-set four-week system in place where one of them was ready to send a cut of a new episode to [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada every Friday. This process took about six months to complete one season of the show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newenglandfilm.com/magazine/2009/10/ruff |title=Ruff |accessdate=October 24, 2015 |website=Newen Gland Film Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406014224/http://newenglandfilm.com/magazine/2009/10/ruff |archivedate=April 6, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Studio G set==\nStudio G is the studio for ''Fetch! with Ruff Ruffman''. Three segments of the show take place in the studio{{spaced ndash}}the intro, halftime quiz show, and \"Triumph Tally\". In season 1, the contestants recognized that Studio G looked like a [[Garage (residential)|garage]] and asked Ruff why, which in the episode, really annoyed Ruff and told them it was not a garage and that it was \"Studio G\". Over the course of the show's five seasons, the studio changed. For season 1 and 2, the studio was relatively unaltered, but sizable changes were made to the studio for season 3. The television through which the contestants communicate with Ruff was changed to a more current flat screen TV, and Ruff's owner parked her car, a dusty [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia]], in the studio. A flamingo and trees as well as a \"Studio G\" sign and a \"wall of fame\" displaying past Fetch! contestant season winners were added to the studio in season 2. In season 4, a new remote control mailbox was placed on the TV Screen, which popped out when a challenge was in the mailbox. Season 5's major renovation occurred during the season finale{{spaced ndash}}it became the Go Get It! studio (Studio P), and was a remodeled version of the Studio G set with new carpeting and pink furniture.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Fetch! with Ruff Ruffman characters}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nFetch! is a reality-based game show where young contestants (ages 10-14) take on various challenges to gain points.  During these challenges, the contestants must complete a variety of tasks assigned to them ahead of time (and on the fly) by Ruff and surrogates, depending on the situation. There is also an educational component, as contestants often must learn something (i.e. [[Astronomy]], [[Carpentry]], [[Engineering]], [[Food Science]], [[Biology]], [[Physics]], [[Mathematics]], etc.) in order to complete the task.\n\nNot all contestants leave the studio each episode to complete tasks. \"As determined by the Fetch 3000\"(according to Ruff), the contestants who remain behind in the studio participate in the \"Half-Time Quiz Show\", in which Ruff asks them up to ten questions with the limited time based on the activities of the contestants out on challenges. Out on challenges, contestants will have the potential to earn up to 100 points. The contestants in the studio will have a chance to win a maximum of 50 in the \"Half-Time Quiz Show\". The show has a ''Fetch Fairness Guarantee''; that every contestant will \"compete for the same number of points\" through thirteen challenges and six \"Half-time Quiz Shows\" before the final episode. Additionally, Ruff assigns \"Bone-us\" points (usually 5 or 10, but sometimes 15 or 20) to the stand-out contestants. On rare occasions, there is the possibility to earn more than 100 points (outside of any bonuses). The record for most points earned in one episode was 125, by Brian, Noah, and Khalil in episode 5, season 1. In Season 4, contestants are able to have 1/2 points (i.e. 515{{frac|1|2}} points). At the end of the season, a final point tally is conducted, with the winner of the tally being declared winner of that season to win the \"Grand Prize\".\n\nPrizes are not always desirable, and sometimes the prize holder winds up with a \"[[booby prize]]\"; for example, in \"Good Dancing and Bad Breath\", Anna and Brian had to dance a [[waltz]] in the studio. During the first season, the contestant had the choice of keeping the prize or giving it to a fellow contestant. During the remaining four seasons, there are two unknown prizes between which the winner chooses. The chosen prize may be \"mailed\" to the mailbox in Studio G, although occasionally large prizes are hidden elsewhere on the set. In one episode of Season 2, Rosario gave his prize to Nina, and in another, he gave it to Madi. In a season 4 episode, Sterling returned his prize to the mailbox.\n\n===Cultural references and guest stars===\n''Fetch! with Ruff Ruffman'' contains a considerable number of direct cultural references for a [[PBS Kids]] show, which makes up a large chunk of the series's comedic style. In the season 2 premiere, when Nina does a rather sloppy job at making chocolate candy, Ruff remarks that it is the \"[[Jackson Pollock]] candy.\" In the following episode, Ruff mentions that he likes [[REO Speedwagon]]. In Season 3, Episode 13, when Sam and Harsha throw sacks in a pail, Ruff makes a comment saying, \"I feel like Shaq in the free throw line\", making a reference to [[Shaquille O' Neal]]. In season 4, Episode 14, when Talia found a [[horseshoe crab]] while working on a shrimp boat, a horrified Ruff exclaimed, \"Looks like [[Darth Vader]]'s face with a billion legs coming out of it!\" In Episode 17 of the same season, Talia was starstruck when she discovered that she was holding [[Roger Federer]]'s [[tennis racket]]. In Episode 15 of Season 2, when the scuba instructors arrived at the beach, Ruff claimed that they were \"faster than [[Batman]]\" and that he \"hoped [Batman] was watching the show\". When Rubye and Marc in Season 5 learned skydiving signs, Ruff remarked that one of the signs looked like \"one of [[Beyonc\u00e9]]'s dance moves.\" In Season 2, Episode 4, when Rosario voiced Ruff for the first time, Ruff remarked: \"Is that Ruff Ruffman or [[Marge Simpson]]?\" In Season 4, Episode 16, when Ruff called Isaac, who was dressed as an old lady, he accidentally called him ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' and then corrects himself and says Mrs. Issacson. In Season 5, Episode 18, when Joe explained to the FETCHers, he told Michelle about the book she read. Michelle said: \"I believe that was [[Green Eggs and Ham]].\"\n\nThe show also had some guest stars. In season 1, [[Aaron Carter]] and the contestants all appeared in his new music video. In season 2, episode 2, Ruff sends Madi and Willie to meet the [[Blue Man Group]]. In Season 3, Episode 4, Sam meets Senator [[Edward Kennedy]]. In season 5, episode 4, Crush the [[sea turtle]] from the movie ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' makes an appearance via Ruff's Fetch 3000. [[Andrew Stanton]] reprises his role as Crush here. In episode 2 of season 4, the host of Design Squad [[Nathan Ball]] appeared in a pole vault challenge.<ref>{{Cite web|title = FETCH! .

He was the [[Los Angeles County District Attorney]] from 2000 to 2012. Cooley was re-elected in 2004 and again in 2008.\n\nIn 2010, Cooley won the Republican nomination for California Attorney General against [[John C. Eastman]] and [[Tom Harman]] in the [[California state elections, June 2010|June 8 primary election]]. During the general election campaign, Cooley said he would defend [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]], a 2008 ballot measure that banned same-sex marriages in California but was then being appealed in the federal courts. Cooley lost to the Democratic nominee, San Francisco District Attorney [[Kamala Harris]], in the [[California Attorney General election, 2010|November 2 general election]], a close race whose results were not finalized until November 24, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statement of Vote from the California Secretary of State|url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2010-general/complete-sov.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611025242/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2010-general/complete-sov.pdf|archive-date=2014-06-11|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nThe second of five children, Cooley was born at [[St. Vincent Medical Center (Los Angeles)|St. Vincent's Hospital]] (now St. Vincent's Medical Center) in Los Angeles. His father was an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent and his mother a [[homemaker]]. Cooley attended Pater Noster High School in Los Angeles.

Cooley served over seven years as a reserve police officer with LAPD and 27 years as prosecutor. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n==Los Angeles County District Attorney==\nCooley challenged two-term incumbent District Attorney Gil Garcetti in the 2000 election. Garcetti and Cooley had a longstanding personal and professional rivalry, going back to at least 1996 when Cooley supported Garcetti's opponent for re-election, John Lynch. Garcetti defeated Lynch by a margin of approximately 5,000 votes out of slightly more than 2.2 million votes.<ref name=Cooley>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/nov/08/news/mn-48881 |title=Cooley Beats Garcetti by Wide Margin |work=The Los Angeles Times |author=Mitchell Landsberg and Twila Decker |date=November 8, 2000 |accessdate=December 1, 2018}}</ref> After the election, Garcetti demoted Cooley from a supervisory position to the county's obscure Welfare Fraud division. The move mirrored Garcetti's demotion as the chief deputy for the entire county in 1988 by then-incumbent [[Ira Reiner]], which caused Garcetti to challenge his former mentor and defeat him in the 1992 general election.<ref name=Ira>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-18/news/mn-676_1_chief-deputy/2 |title=Reiner, in Surprise Move, Drops Out of Race for D.A. |work=The Los Angeles Times |author=Sheryl Stolberg |date=September 18, 1992 |accessdate=December 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nCooley upset Garcetti in a competitive three-person primary, taking 39 percent of the vote to Garcetti's 37, forcing the two into a runoff in the November general election.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/09/local/me-7004 |title=D.A.'s Race Shapes Up as a Bitter Fight to the Finish |work=The Los Angeles Times |date=March 8, 2000 |accessdate=December 1, 2018}}</ref> In the two-person runoff, Cooley defeated Garcetti 64 to 36 percent.<ref name=Cooley/>\n\nHe was the first attorney with trial experience to be elected District Attorney since 1984.

The reorganization also included the creation of the Justice System Integrity Division, Forensic Science Section and Victim Impact Program. Cooley changed the office's policy on California's [[Three Strikes Law]], with the stated purpose to assure proportionality in sentencing and even-handed application countywide. Throughout his time as District Attorney, Cooley continued his efforts against the Three Strikes Law in favor of proportionality, including supporting ballot measures that would have altered Three Strikes.  The blowback from those efforts ultimately led Cooley to leave the California District Attorneys Association in 2006.<ref>[http://www.metnews.com/articles/2010/cooley011410.htm \"Steve Cooley.

In eight out of eight cases, he opposed the use of a California law that allows battered women in prison to be given a new hearing if evidence of domestic violence was omitted during the original proceedings. Cooley had initially supported Peagler's release from prison, but then withdrew his written offer to reduce the battered woman's prison sentence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1394400121.html?dids=1394400121:1394400121&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Dec+7%2C+2007&author=John+Spano&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=B.5&desc=Lawsuit+says+Cooley+reneged+on+promise%3B+D.A.+vowed+to+aid+her+bid+for+freedom%2C+says+the+killer+of+a+pimp|work=The Los Angeles Times |title=\"Lawsuit says Cooley reneged on promise; D.A. vowed to aid her bid for freedom, says the killer of a pimp.\"|via=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com|date=2007-12-07|accessdate=2010-11-18|first=John |last=Spano}}</ref>\n\nJust a week before the 2008 election that he ultimately won, Cooley was attacked for violating Jessica's Law and making a deal with defense attorneys and judges to postpone seeking tougher sanctions against a group of serious sex offenders that had completed their prison terms. Rather than seeking indefinite hospitalization for some offenders, as allowed under a November 2006 ballot measure, Cooley only sought two years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/31/local/me-cooley31|title=\"Sex offender deal an issue in campaign\"|publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2008-05-31|accessdate=2010-11-18|first=Jack|last=Leonard}}</ref>\n\n===Third term===\nIn June 2008, Cooley was elected to a third term, defeating his challengers, [http://www.SteveIpsen.com Steve Ipsen], President of the L.A. County Prosecutors Union, and Albert Robles, an attorney and professor. Cooley was heavily criticized for his opposition of Proposition 9 (Marsy's Law: The Victim's Bill of Rights). Cooley told the ''L.A. Times'', just before voters went to the polls over \"Marsy's Law\" that the measure, which ended up passing, would sweep aside \"decades of legislative scrutiny and judicial review.\" It plays to voters' feelings, selling itself with a female victim's name, \"like a cherry on the ice cream.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/02/news/la-ol-cruise-ship-safety-law-all-wet-20120702 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Patt | last=Morrison | title=Cruise ship crimes: Why so hush-hush? | date=2012-07-02}}</ref>\n\nThe ''L.A.

He was the [[Los Angeles County District Attorney]] from 2000 to 2012. Cooley was re-elected in 2004 and again in 2008.\n\nIn 2010, Cooley won the Republican nomination for California Attorney General against [[John C. Eastman]] and [[Tom Harman]] in the [[California state elections, June 2010|June 8 primary election]]. During the general election campaign, Cooley said he would defend [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]], a 2008 ballot measure that banned same-sex marriages in California but was then being appealed in the federal courts. Cooley lost to the Democratic nominee, San Francisco District Attorney [[Kamala Harris]], in the [[California Attorney General election, 2010|November 2 general election]], a close race whose results were not finalized until November 24, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statement of Vote from the California Secretary of State|url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2010-general/complete-sov.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611025242/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2010-general/complete-sov.pdf|archive-date=2014-06-11|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nThe second of five children, Cooley was born at [[St. Vincent Medical Center (Los Angeles)|St. Vincent's Hospital]] (now St. Vincent's Medical Center) in Los Angeles. His father was an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent and his mother a [[homemaker]]. Cooley attended Pater Noster High School in Los Angeles. At [[California State University, Los Angeles]], Cooley served two terms as Student Body President and was selected for membership in [[Phi Kappa Phi]]. He was also a member of [[Zeta Beta Tau]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Notable Alumni|url=http://www.zbt.org/who-we-are/notable-alumni.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205230940/http://www.zbt.org/who-we-are/notable-alumni.html|archive-date=2016-12-05|df=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, he was commencement speaker for his graduating class.

Cooley served over seven years as a reserve police officer with LAPD and 27 years as prosecutor. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n==Los Angeles County District Attorney==\nCooley challenged two-term incumbent District Attorney Gil Garcetti in the 2000 election. Garcetti and Cooley had a longstanding personal and professional rivalry, going back to at least 1996 when Cooley supported Garcetti's opponent for re-election, John Lynch. Garcetti defeated Lynch by a margin of approximately 5,000 votes out of slightly more than 2.2 million votes.<ref name=Cooley>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/nov/08/news/mn-48881 |title=Cooley Beats Garcetti by Wide Margin |work=The Los Angeles Times |author=Mitchell Landsberg and Twila Decker |date=November 8, 2000 |accessdate=December 1, 2018}}</ref> After the election, Garcetti demoted Cooley from a supervisory position to the county's obscure Welfare Fraud division. The move mirrored Garcetti's demotion as the chief deputy for the entire county in 1988 by then-incumbent [[Ira Reiner]], which caused Garcetti to challenge his former mentor and defeat him in the 1992 general election.<ref name=Ira>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-18/news/mn-676_1_chief-deputy/2 |title=Reiner, in Surprise Move, Drops Out of Race for D.A. |work=The Los Angeles Times |author=Sheryl Stolberg |date=September 18, 1992 |accessdate=December 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nCooley upset Garcetti in a competitive three-person primary, taking 39 percent of the vote to Garcetti's 37, forcing the two into a runoff in the November general election.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/09/local/me-7004 |title=D.A.'s Race Shapes Up as a Bitter Fight to the Finish |work=The Los Angeles Times |date=March 8, 2000 |accessdate=December 1, 2018}}</ref> In the two-person runoff, Cooley defeated Garcetti 64 to 36 percent.<ref name=Cooley/>\n\nHe was the first attorney with trial experience to be elected District Attorney since 1984. At his 2000 swearing-in ceremony, he charged his over 1,000 prosecutors \u2013 including more than 300 District Attorney investigators and 600 clerical, technical and support staff \u2013 to \"show no fear in pursuing the criminal element, but also be fearless in the pursuit of justice.\"\n\n===First term===\nCooley instituted a reorganization of the District Attorney's Office.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.losangelescriminallawyer.pro/media.html |title=Cooley Presentation to the Board of Supervisors |publisher=Citizens' Economy & Efficiency Commission |date=June 7, 2001 |accessdate=2014-11-20}}</ref> On April 9, 2003, he announced that he was closing the office's Environmental Crimes unit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/apr/09/local/me-newhall9|work=LA Times|title=\"D.A.

The reorganization also included the creation of the Justice System Integrity Division, Forensic Science Section and Victim Impact Program. Cooley changed the office's policy on California's [[Three Strikes Law]], with the stated purpose to assure proportionality in sentencing and even-handed application countywide. Throughout his time as District Attorney, Cooley continued his efforts against the Three Strikes Law in favor of proportionality, including supporting ballot measures that would have altered Three Strikes.  The blowback from those efforts ultimately led Cooley to leave the California District Attorneys Association in 2006.<ref>[http://www.metnews.com/articles/2010/cooley011410.htm \"Steve Cooley.

In eight out of eight cases, he opposed the use of a California law that allows battered women in prison to be given a new hearing if evidence of domestic violence was omitted during the original proceedings. Cooley had initially supported Peagler's release from prison, but then withdrew his written offer to reduce the battered woman's prison sentence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1394400121.html?dids=1394400121:1394400121&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Dec+7%2C+2007&author=John+Spano&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=B.5&desc=Lawsuit+says+Cooley+reneged+on+promise%3B+D.A.+vowed+to+aid+her+bid+for+freedom%2C+says+the+killer+of+a+pimp|work=The Los Angeles Times |title=\"Lawsuit says Cooley reneged on promise; D.A. vowed to aid her bid for freedom, says the killer of a pimp.\"|via=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com|date=2007-12-07|accessdate=2010-11-18|first=John |last=Spano}}</ref>\n\nJust a week before the 2008 election that he ultimately won, Cooley was attacked for violating Jessica's Law and making a deal with defense attorneys and judges to postpone seeking tougher sanctions against a group of serious sex offenders that had completed their prison terms. Rather than seeking indefinite hospitalization for some offenders, as allowed under a November 2006 ballot measure, Cooley only sought two years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/31/local/me-cooley31|title=\"Sex offender deal an issue in campaign\"|publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2008-05-31|accessdate=2010-11-18|first=Jack|last=Leonard}}</ref>\n\n===Third term===\nIn June 2008, Cooley was elected to a third term, defeating his challengers, [http://www.SteveIpsen.com Steve Ipsen], President of the L.A. County Prosecutors Union, and Albert Robles, an attorney and professor. Cooley was heavily criticized for his opposition of Proposition 9 (Marsy's Law: The Victim's Bill of Rights). Cooley told the ''L.A. Times'', just before voters went to the polls over \"Marsy's Law\" that the measure, which ended up passing, would sweep aside \"decades of legislative scrutiny and judicial review.\" It plays to voters' feelings, selling itself with a female victim's name, \"like a cherry on the ice cream.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/02/news/la-ol-cruise-ship-safety-law-all-wet-20120702 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Patt | last=Morrison | title=Cruise ship crimes: Why so hush-hush? | date=2012-07-02}}</ref>\n\nThe ''L.A.

Interactive Entertainment]]. Running on the [[Unreal Engine 3]], it is the tenth main installment in the ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' video game series and a sequel to the 2011 game ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]''. It was released on April 14, 2015 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]]. NetherRealm Studios' mobile team developed a version for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices. [[High Voltage Software]] developed the PC version of the game, with Polish studio QLOC taking over the work on it shortly after the release of Kombat Pack 1.\n\nLike previous ''Mortal Kombat'' games, ''Mortal Kombat X''{{'}}s gameplay consists of two players, or one player and the CPU, fighting against each other with their selected character, using a large, varied array of character-specific attacks. The game contains several modes, such as a story mode, which takes place twenty-five years after the previous ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' game, several 'Tower' modes, which feature dynamically changing challenges, numerous online modes, and the 'Krypt', a mode played in a [[First person (video games)|first person]] perspective, where players explore the areas unlocking a variety of in-game items.\n\nThe console versions of ''Mortal Kombat X'' received critical acclaim upon release. Most praise was directed at the game's controls, overall gameplay, graphics, story, and characters, with some reviewers calling it the best game in the ''Mortal Kombat'' series. However, the PC version of the game was met with mixed reception, with reviewers citing numerous technical issues (including frequent crashes and slow netcode) as problems that severely hinder the experience. Selling more than 10 million copies, the game was the fastest-selling game in the franchise and the ninth best-selling game in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mortal Kombat X has sold nearly 11 million copies |url=https://www.videogamer.com/news/mortal-kombat-x-has-sold-nearly-11-million-copies |website=VideoGamer.com |accessdate=12 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAn upgraded version of ''Mortal Kombat X'', titled '''''Mortal Kombat XL'''''{{efn|Pronounced as the letters XL, not 40.}}, was released on March 1, 2016, for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, including all downloadable content characters from the two released Kombat Packs, almost all bonus alternate costumes available at the time of release, improved gameplay, and improved netcode. This edition was also released for PC on October 4, 2016, and was added to the [[Xbox Game Pass]] on December 7, 2018. A sequel, ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]'', was released on April 23, 2019.\n\nIt is the best fighting game of all time.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{See also|Mortal Kombat#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of the Mortal Kombat series}}\n''Mortal Kombat X'' is a [[fighting game]] in which two characters fight against each other using a variety of attacks, including special moves, and the series' trademark gruesome finishing moves. The game allows two players to face each other (either locally or online), or a single player to play against the CPU. The energy meter, first introduced in [[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|''Mortal Kombat (2011)'']], allows players to perform techniques such as \"X-Ray\" special moves. Similarly to [[NetherRealm Studios]]' previous title, ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', fighters are able to interact with the environment, using parts of the scenery to reposition themselves or using available objects as weapons.<ref name=sn>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/86189/mortal-kombat-x-producer-discusses-environmental-attacks |title=Mortal Kombat X producer discusses environmental attacks |publisher=Shacknews.com |date=September 8, 2014 |accessdate=April 6, 2015}}</ref> In addition, each fighter has three different variations, each featuring a different set of moves they can use during the fight: for example, the character [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]] features a [[Ninjutsu]] variation which gives him specific moves utilizing dual swords, a Hellfire variation which incorporates fiery special moves, and an Inferno variation which allows him to summon hellspawn minions to aid him in the fight.<ref name=gb>{{cite web|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/e3-2014-ed-boon-talks-mortal-kombat-x/2300-9076/?comment_page=2 |title=E3 2014: Ed Boon Talks Mortal Kombat X |publisher=Giant Bomb |date=June 11, 2014 |accessdate=June 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\nReturning from [[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|the previous ''Mortal Kombat'' game]] is the Energy Meter, which is divided in three sections, and provides access to enhanced special moves (costing one section), breaking combos (costing two sections) and performing X-ray moves (costing all three sections of the bar).<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/the-battle-for-earthrealm-continues-in-mortal-kombat-x-1584706283 |title=<nowiki>The Battle For Earthrealm Continues In Mortal Kombat X [Update</nowiki>&#93; |publisher=Kotaku.com |date= |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref> Additionally, a Stamina Meter has been added under the health bar, which consists of two sections, and is consumed whenever the player runs, performs a back dash, a combo breaker, a stage interaction, or certain special techniques, such as cancelling Scorpion's teleports.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n{{anchor|Quitality}}\nIn addition to the usual [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatalities]], ''Mortal Kombat X'' features two new types of finishing moves: Quitality, which instantly kills the player's character if they [[rage quit]] during a multiplayer match;<ref>{{cite web|last1=Moser|first1=Cassidee|title=Mortal Kombat X Will Punish You For Rage Quitting|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/19/mortal-kombat-x-will-punish-you-for-rage-quitting|website=IGN.com|accessdate=March 19, 2015}}</ref> and {{anchor|faction}}Faction Kills, a set of finishing moves available to players based on the selection of one of the game's five factions (Black Dragon, Brotherhood of Shadow, Lin Kuei, Special Forces, and White Lotus). [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)#Brutality|Brutality]] finishing moves make a comeback, although different from the ones featured in ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]''. Brutalities now take the form of enhanced versions of certain moves that are triggered when said move is used as the final blow to win the final round in a fight, provided certain conditions are met.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamerant.com/mortal-kombat-x-brutality-jade-roster/|title='Mortal Kombat X' Devs Talk Brutalities, Which Fighter Won't Return|author=Anthony Taormina|date=February 12, 2015|work=Game Rant|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> In addition, the game features stage Brutalities, which are triggered when certain environment interactions are used to finish the opponent. Additionally, [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)#Stage Fatality|stage Fatalities]] were reinstated in ''Mortal Kombat XL'', being available in three of the game's stages.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nFor local single-player, the game offers Story mode, a plot-driven mode with cutscenes between fights; and Living Towers, an evolved form of ''Mortal Kombat'''s Challenge Tower where the play conditions change. Also locally, player vs. player mode is available. Playing online, the play modes include 1 vs. 1 (ranked or random), King of the Hill, Survivor, and Test Your Luck. Another new mode is Faction Wars, where players choose one from the five factions to align with, and join a persistent online [[cross-platform]] competition with others, winning points for their faction, contributing in the conflict between them, ranking up personally, and earning special rewards such as faction-specific finishing moves (one of which is unlocked to the player if their faction wins at the end of any given week).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/02/06/everything-we-know-about-mortal-kombat-xs-new-modes|title=Everything We Know About Mortal Kombat X's New Modes|work=IGN|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nichegamer.net/2015/02/mortal-kombat-x-video-details-the-newest-feature-of-the-series-factions/|title=Mortal Kombat X Video Details the Newest Feature of the Series, Factions - Niche Gamer|work=nichegamer.net|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{further|Mortal Kombat (comics)#Mortal Kombat X: Blood Ties|l1=Expanded backstory from the tie-in comic series}}\n\nTwo years after [[Mortal Kombat (2011) | the defeat of Outworld's ruler]], [[Shao Kahn]], [[Shinnok]] attacks Earthrealm with his army of Netherrealm demons, as well as Earthrealm warriors who were killed during Kahn's invasion and are now resurrected as revenants under [[Quan Chi]]'s control. After fighting their fallen comrades, a strike team led by [[Johnny Cage]], [[Sonya Blade]], and [[Kenshi (Mortal Kombat)|Kenshi]] open a portal to Raiden's Sky Temple and head to the Jinsei Chamber, the source of Earthrealm's life force, where [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] and [[Fujin (Mortal Kombat)|Fujin]] are seen battling Shinnok and his Netherrealm forces. When Shinnok tries to kill Sonya, Johnny rushes to defend her, inadvertently awakening ancient superhuman powers within himself. Using his newfound powers, Johnny holds Shinnok at bay long enough for Raiden to steal Shinnok's amulet and imprison him inside it, but Quan Chi escapes. Johnny, Raiden, and Sonya track him to his lair in the Netherrealm and defeat him, successfully restoring [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]], [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]], and [[Jax (Mortal Kombat)|Jax]] to human form in the process, though Quan Chi escapes again. In the years that follow, Johnny and Sonya marry and have a daughter, [[Cassie Cage|Cassie]], though they later divorce. Scorpion, now using his original name, Hanzo Hasashi, rebuilds his Shirai Ryu clan while mentoring Kenshi's son [[Takeda Takahashi|Takeda]], and Sub-Zero becomes the new Grandmaster of the Lin Kuei after killing [[Sektor]]. Sub-Zero uses the data from Sektor's memory banks detailing Quan Chi's various manipulations of the Lin Kuei, including the truth about the deaths of Hasashi's wife and son, to help end his feud with Hasashi.\n\nTwenty years after Shinnok's defeat, Johnny assembles a new team of young fighters composed of Cassie, Takeda, Jax's daughter [[Jacqui Briggs|Jacqui]], and [[Kung Lao]]'s cousin [[Kung Jin]]. After undergoing a training exercise with Sub-Zero, they are deployed to Outworld to resolve a civil war between former empress [[Mileena]], who has obtained Shinnok's amulet from [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]], and Outworld's current emperor [[Kotal Kahn]], with whom Earthrealm has a fragile peace treaty. Meanwhile, in an Outworld refugee camp in Earthrealm, Sonya captures Kano and forces him to reveal Mileena's location. Using this information, Cassie's team aids Kotal in recovering Shinnok's amulet and capturing Mileena, who is subsequently executed on Kotal's orders. No longer believing Earthrealm capable of keeping the amulet safe, Kotal decides to keep it in Outworld's hands, and takes Cassie and her friends hostage as leverage against Raiden. Kotal's insectoid second-in-command [[D'Vorah (Mortal Kombat)|D'Vorah]], who had killed [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]] when Kotal started his rule, is revealed as a double agent for Quan Chi and steals the amulet. Cassie and her team escape captivity, and inform Earthrealm of D'Vorah's intentions.\n\nHoping to stop Quan Chi from getting the amulet, Jax and Kenshi, aided by a Netherrealm local named [[Sareena]], lead an assault on the Netherrealm. After fighting his way through the revenants of his former allies, Jax captures a weakened Quan Chi, who is brought to Earthrealm and held at an Outworld refugee camp. Hasashi infiltrates the refugee camp alongside his clan with the intent of assassinating Quan Chi as revenge for ruining his life, defeating Kenshi, Johnny and Sonya in the process. As Hasashi prepares to kill Quan Chi, D'Vorah arrives with the amulet. Quan Chi manages to finish his spell moments before being beheaded by Hasashi, releasing Shinnok from captivity. Weakened by the Shirai Ryu's previous attack, Johnny is taken hostage by Shinnok and D'Vorah. With the aid of Quan Chi's revenants, Shinnok and D'Vorah assault the Sky Temple, and subdue Raiden and [[Bo' Rai Cho]] in the process. Shinnok then enters the Jinsei and corrupts it, transforming himself into a powerful demon in the process.\n\nCassie's team pursues Shinnok, only to be intercepted by Kotal Kahn and his army. They inform him of Shinnok's return and Kotal decides to kill them, hoping to appease Shinnok and buy time to bolster Outworld's defenses, but Sub-Zero and his Lin Kuei warriors appear just in time to repel the Outworld forces. At the Sky Temple, Jacqui and Takeda occupy the revenants, while Cassie and Jin enter the Jinsei chamber. Cassie defeats D'Vorah, though Jin is knocked out, leaving her to face Shinnok alone. When Shinnok begins torturing Johnny, Cassie manifests powers similar to her father's, which she uses to defeat Shinnok. A grievously-wounded Raiden then purifies the Jinsei, stripping Shinnok of his powers and forcing the revenants to withdraw. Sonya and her soldiers arrive to take Shinnok and D'Vorah away, and the Cage family reunites.\n\nSome time later, the revenants of [[Liu Kang]] and [[Kitana]] are revealed to have assumed leadership of the Netherrealm. Raiden, now in possession of Shinnok's amulet and corrupted in the process of purifying the Jinsei, warns them they will face [[Mortal Kombat 11 | \"fates worse than death\"]] if they threaten Earthrealm. Before departing, Raiden leaves behind Shinnok's severed, yet still living head as a final warning.\n\n===Characters===\n{{main|List of Mortal Kombat characters}}\nThe game had 24 playable characters at launch, with 9 additional characters added via [[Downloadable content|DLC]].

Tan also liked the overall presentation and the story's concept, but missed Stage Fatalities and tag-team matches, disliked the story's ending, and felt that the game was purposefully \"truncated\".<ref name=\"Game Revolution review\"/>\n\nMichael Huber of [[GameTrailers]] called it a \"superb entry in the franchise\", noting the gameplay, story mode and new online components.<ref name=\"GT\" /> Vince Ingenito of [[IGN]] gave it a score of 8.4. He claimed that ''Mortal Kombat X'' was the best ''Mortal Kombat'' game in the franchise's history, lauding it as deeper, mechanically richer and more fully featured than the previous ''Mortal Kombat'' games. He also praised the presence of the new characters as the major roster shakeup made the game feel new and exciting to longtime series fans and casual fans.<ref name=\"IGN\" /> Michael McWhertor of [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] called the game \"one of the best fighting games in the series\", praising the gameplay in addition to the newer systems in place and overall presentation.<ref name=\"Poly\" /> Stephen Kleckner of [[VentureBeat]] was more critical of the game, citing in his opinion confusing move animations, a system favoring close range mid-to-high combos, having to use the block button to execute a run, poor online play, and easy Fatality DLC.

Interactive Entertainment]]. Running on the [[Unreal Engine 3]], it is the tenth main installment in the ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' video game series and a sequel to the 2011 game ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]''. It was released on April 14, 2015 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]]. NetherRealm Studios' mobile team developed a version for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices. [[High Voltage Software]] developed the PC version of the game, with Polish studio QLOC taking over the work on it shortly after the release of Kombat Pack 1.\n\nLike previous ''Mortal Kombat'' games, ''Mortal Kombat X''{{'}}s gameplay consists of two players, or one player and the CPU, fighting against each other with their selected character, using a large, varied array of character-specific attacks. The game contains several modes, such as a story mode, which takes place twenty-five years after the previous ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' game, several 'Tower' modes, which feature dynamically changing challenges, numerous online modes, and the 'Krypt', a mode played in a [[First person (video games)|first person]] perspective, where players explore the areas unlocking a variety of in-game items.\n\nThe console versions of ''Mortal Kombat X'' received critical acclaim upon release. Most praise was directed at the game's controls, overall gameplay, graphics, story, and characters, with some reviewers calling it the best game in the ''Mortal Kombat'' series. However, the PC version of the game was met with mixed reception, with reviewers citing numerous technical issues (including frequent crashes and slow netcode) as problems that severely hinder the experience. Selling more than 10 million copies, the game was the fastest-selling game in the franchise and the ninth best-selling game in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mortal Kombat X has sold nearly 11 million copies |url=https://www.videogamer.com/news/mortal-kombat-x-has-sold-nearly-11-million-copies |website=VideoGamer.com |accessdate=12 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAn upgraded version of ''Mortal Kombat X'', titled '''''Mortal Kombat XL'''''{{efn|Pronounced as the letters XL, not 40.}}, was released on March 1, 2016, for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, including all downloadable content characters from the two released Kombat Packs, almost all bonus alternate costumes available at the time of release, improved gameplay, and improved netcode. This edition was also released for PC on October 4, 2016, and was added to the [[Xbox Game Pass]] on December 7, 2018. A sequel, ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]'', was released on April 23, 2019.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{See also|Mortal Kombat#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of the Mortal Kombat series}}\n''Mortal Kombat X'' is a [[fighting game]] in which two characters fight against each other using a variety of attacks, including special moves, and the series' trademark gruesome finishing moves.

Another new mode is Faction Wars, where players choose one from the five factions to align with, and join a persistent online [[cross-platform]] competition with others, winning points for their faction, contributing in the conflict between them, ranking up personally, and earning special rewards such as faction-specific finishing moves (one of which is unlocked to the player if their faction wins at the end of any given week).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/02/06/everything-we-know-about-mortal-kombat-xs-new-modes|title=Everything We Know About Mortal Kombat X's New Modes|work=IGN|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nichegamer.net/2015/02/mortal-kombat-x-video-details-the-newest-feature-of-the-series-factions/|title=Mortal Kombat X Video Details the Newest Feature of the Series, Factions - Niche Gamer|work=nichegamer.net|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{further|Mortal Kombat (comics)#Mortal Kombat X: Blood Ties|l1=Expanded backstory from the tie-in comic series}}\n\nTwo years after [[Mortal Kombat (2011) | the defeat of Outworld's ruler]], [[Shao Kahn]], [[Shinnok]] attacks Earthrealm with his army of Netherrealm demons, as well as Earthrealm warriors who were killed during Kahn's invasion and are now resurrected as revenants under [[Quan Chi]]'s control. After fighting their fallen comrades, a strike team led by [[Johnny Cage]], [[Sonya Blade]], and [[Kenshi (Mortal Kombat)|Kenshi]] open a portal to Raiden's Sky Temple and head to the Jinsei Chamber, the source of Earthrealm's life force, where [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] and [[Fujin (Mortal Kombat)|Fujin]] are seen battling Shinnok and his Netherrealm forces. When Shinnok tries to kill Sonya, Johnny rushes to defend her, inadvertently awakening ancient superhuman powers within himself. Using his newfound powers, Johnny holds Shinnok at bay long enough for Raiden to steal Shinnok's amulet and imprison him inside it, but Quan Chi escapes. Johnny, Raiden, and Sonya track him to his lair in the Netherrealm and defeat him, successfully restoring [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]], [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]], and [[Jax (Mortal Kombat)|Jax]] to human form in the process, though Quan Chi escapes again. In the years that follow, Johnny and Sonya marry and have a daughter, [[Cassie Cage|Cassie]], though they later divorce. Scorpion, now using his original name, Hanzo Hasashi, rebuilds his Shirai Ryu clan while mentoring Kenshi's son [[Takeda Takahashi|Takeda]], and Sub-Zero becomes the new Grandmaster of the Lin Kuei after killing [[Sektor]]. Sub-Zero uses the data from Sektor's memory banks detailing Quan Chi's various manipulations of the Lin Kuei, including the truth about the deaths of Hasashi's wife and son, to help end his feud with Hasashi.\n\nTwenty years after Shinnok's defeat, Johnny assembles a new team of young fighters composed of Cassie, Takeda, Jax's daughter [[Jacqui Briggs|Jacqui]], and [[Kung Lao]]'s cousin [[Kung Jin]]. After undergoing a training exercise with Sub-Zero, they are deployed to Outworld to resolve a civil war between former empress [[Mileena]], who has obtained Shinnok's amulet from [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]], and Outworld's current emperor [[Kotal Kahn]], with whom Earthrealm has a fragile peace treaty. Meanwhile, in an Outworld refugee camp in Earthrealm, Sonya captures Kano and forces him to reveal Mileena's location. Using this information, Cassie's team aids Kotal in recovering Shinnok's amulet and capturing Mileena, who is subsequently executed on Kotal's orders. No longer believing Earthrealm capable of keeping the amulet safe, Kotal decides to keep it in Outworld's hands, and takes Cassie and her friends hostage as leverage against Raiden. Kotal's insectoid second-in-command [[D'Vorah (Mortal Kombat)|D'Vorah]], who had killed [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]] when Kotal started his rule, is revealed as a double agent for Quan Chi and steals the amulet. Cassie and her team escape captivity, and inform Earthrealm of D'Vorah's intentions.\n\nHoping to stop Quan Chi from getting the amulet, Jax and Kenshi, aided by a Netherrealm local named [[Sareena]], lead an assault on the Netherrealm. After fighting his way through the revenants of his former allies, Jax captures a weakened Quan Chi, who is brought to Earthrealm and held at an Outworld refugee camp. Hasashi infiltrates the refugee camp alongside his clan with the intent of assassinating Quan Chi as revenge for ruining his life, defeating Kenshi, Johnny and Sonya in the process. As Hasashi prepares to kill Quan Chi, D'Vorah arrives with the amulet. Quan Chi manages to finish his spell moments before being beheaded by Hasashi, releasing Shinnok from captivity. Weakened by the Shirai Ryu's previous attack, Johnny is taken hostage by Shinnok and D'Vorah. With the aid of Quan Chi's revenants, Shinnok and D'Vorah assault the Sky Temple, and subdue Raiden and [[Bo' Rai Cho]] in the process. Shinnok then enters the Jinsei and corrupts it, transforming himself into a powerful demon in the process.\n\nCassie's team pursues Shinnok, only to be intercepted by Kotal Kahn and his army. They inform him of Shinnok's return and Kotal decides to kill them, hoping to appease Shinnok and buy time to bolster Outworld's defenses, but Sub-Zero and his Lin Kuei warriors appear just in time to repel the Outworld forces. At the Sky Temple, Jacqui and Takeda occupy the revenants, while Cassie and Jin enter the Jinsei chamber. Cassie defeats D'Vorah, though Jin is knocked out, leaving her to face Shinnok alone. When Shinnok begins torturing Johnny, Cassie manifests powers similar to her father's, which she uses to defeat Shinnok. A grievously-wounded Raiden then purifies the Jinsei, stripping Shinnok of his powers and forcing the revenants to withdraw. Sonya and her soldiers arrive to take Shinnok and D'Vorah away, and the Cage family reunites.\n\nSome time later, the revenants of [[Liu Kang]] and [[Kitana]] are revealed to have assumed leadership of the Netherrealm. Raiden, now in possession of Shinnok's amulet and corrupted in the process of purifying the Jinsei, warns them they will face [[Mortal Kombat 11 | \"fates worse than death\"]] if they threaten Earthrealm. Before departing, Raiden leaves behind Shinnok's severed, yet still living head as a final warning.\n\n===Characters===\n{{main|List of Mortal Kombat characters}}\nThe game had 24 playable characters at launch, with 9 additional characters added via [[Downloadable content|DLC]].
