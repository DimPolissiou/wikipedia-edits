It was founded by [[Steve Chen]], [[Chad Hurley]] and [[Jawed Karim]] in February 2005, and the first video was \"[[Me at the zoo]]\" uploaded by Karim on his channel in April 2005. Although the most-viewed videos were initially [[viral video]]s, such as \"[[Judson Laipply#\"Evolution of Dance\"|Evolution of Dance]]\" and \"[[Charlie Bit My Finger]]\", the most-viewed videos were increasingly related to [[music videos]]. In fact, since [[Lady Gaga]]'s \"[[Bad Romance]]\", every video that has reached the top of the \"most-viewed YouTube videos\" list has been a music video. Although some of the previously most-viewed videos are no longer listed on the site, reaching the top of the list is still considered a tremendous feat.\n\nIn November 2005, a [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] advertisement featuring Brazilian football player [[Ronaldinho]] became the first video to reach one million views.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/03/31/2005-nike-video-featuring-ronaldinho-becomes-first-youtube-film-reach-one-million|title=2005: Nike video featuring Ronaldinho becomes first YouTube film to reach one million views}}</ref>\n\n==Billion View Club==\nAn early metric of a video's popularity was the so-called Billion View Club, videos which had succeeded in reaching over 1 billion views since their initial upload.<ref name=\"RollingStone\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-billion-view-club-youtubes-most-watched-music-videos-162074/|title=The Billion View Club: YouTube's Most Watched Music Videos|first=Brittany|last=Spanos|date=October 13, 2015|accessdate=October 15, 2019|work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2012, \"[[Gangnam Style (music video)|Gangnam Style]]\" became the first video to reach one billion views.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/1481275/psys-gangnam-style-hits-1-billion-views-on-youtube|title=PSY's 'Gangnam Style' Hits 1 Billion Views on YouTube}}</ref> By June 2015, only \"[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)#Music video|Baby]]\" had managed to pass this threshold; but, by October 2015, a total of ten videos had done so,<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> and the number grew further to 100 in February 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2018/02/21/there-are-now-over-100-youtube-videos-with-at-least-a-billion-views/#1758c6056415|title=There Are Now Over 100 YouTube Videos With At Least A Billion Views}}</ref> Considering older videos that pre-dated YouTube's creation in 2005 but were added later:\n* \"[[November Rain]]\" by [[Guns N' Roses]] became the first video made prior to YouTube's creation to reach this threshold by July 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/guns-n-roses-november-rain-first-90s-video-1-billion-views-youtube/|title=Guns N' Roses' 'November Rain' Is First '90s Video to Top 1 Billion YouTube Views|first=Michael|last=Christopher|date=July 16, 2018|accessdate=October 15, 2019|work=[[Loudwire]]}}</ref>\n* \"[[Numb (Linkin Park song)|Numb]]\" by [[Linkin Park]] was the first 2000s video predating YouTube to reach 1 billion views in November 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rocksound.tv/news/read/linkin-parks-numb-video-has-reached-1-billion-views-on-youtube|title=Linkin Park's 'Numb' video has reached 1 billion views on YouTube}}</ref>\n* \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] was the first 1970s video (and pre-1990s video) to reach 1 billion views in July 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/22/bohemian-rhapsody-becomes-first-pre-1990s-song-rack-billion/|title=Bohemian Rhapsody becomes first pre-1990s song to rack up billion hits on YouTube, site announces|first=Jessica|last=Carpani|date=July 22, 2019|accessdate=October 15, 2019|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\n* Guns N' Roses' \"[[Sweet Child o' Mine]]\" was the first 1980s video to reach 1 billion views in October 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/guns-n-roses-sweet-child-o-mine-1-billion-views-1203371701/|title=Guns N' Roses' 'Sweet Child O' Mine' Becomes First '80s Music Video's to Hit 1 Billion YouTube Views|first=Breanna|last=Bell|date=October 15, 2019|accessdate=October 15, 2019|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n\nWith numerous videos readily clearing one billion views by 2018, more interest has been on two and three-billion views and higher metrics.

The Academy stated: \"For most categories, we would prefer streaming distribution links for online entry submissions, though CD submissions remain optional\". As justification for this development, the Academy highlighted the changing music industry and added that submitting links was more convenient and cost effective, especially for smaller and independent labels.\n* Additionally, there were separate screening committees for Pop and Rock, whereas previously these categories were screened by a Core Committee. This leaves the Core Committee to focus on the more difficult decisions such as determining who is eligible for the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] category and trying to find the best home for borderline genre entries.\n* The definition of the [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album]] had been expanded to accept \"contemporary pop songs performed in traditional pop style \u2013 the term \"traditional\" being a reference to the style of the composition, vocal styling and the instrumental arrangement without regard to the age of the material\". The Academy stated that broadening the category was done in an attempt to allow it to \"remain robust and inclusive\" and enable it to be more competitive as, for example, [[Tony Bennett]] has won the award 13 times.\n* Spoken word recordings targeted at children had been moved from the [[Grammy Award for Best Children's Album|Best Children's Album]] category to the [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album|Best Spoken Word Album]].\n* As of the 62nd Grammy Awards, Spanish-language Latin Gospel and Christian music would be officially welcomed in the [[Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album|Best Gospel Album]], [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Album|Best Contemporary Christian Music Album]], [[Grammy Award for Best Roots Gospel Album|Best Roots Gospel Album]], [[Grammy

The Academy stated: \"For most categories, we would prefer streaming distribution links for online entry submissions, though CD submissions remain optional\". As justification for this development, the Academy highlighted the changing music industry and added that submitting links was more convenient and cost effective, especially for smaller and independent labels.\n* Additionally, there were separate screening committees for Pop and Rock, whereas previously these categories were screened by a Core Committee. This leaves the Core Committee to focus on the more difficult decisions such as determining who is eligible for the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] category and trying to find the best home for borderline genre entries.\n* The definition of the [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album]] had been expanded to accept \"contemporary pop songs performed in traditional pop style \u2013 the term \"traditional\" being a reference to the style of the composition, vocal styling and the instrumental arrangement without regard to the age of the material\". The Academy stated that broadening the category was done in an attempt to allow it to \"remain robust and inclusive\" and enable it to be more competitive as, for example, [[Tony Bennett]] has won the award 13 times.\n* Spoken word recordings targeted at children had been moved from the [[Grammy Award for Best Children's Album|Best Children's Album]] category to the [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album|Best Spoken Word Album]].\n* As of the 62nd Grammy Awards, Spanish-language Latin Gospel and Christian music would be officially welcomed in the [[Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album|Best Gospel Album]], [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Album|Best Contemporary Christian Music Album]], [[Grammy Award for Best Roots Gospel Album|Best Roots Gospel Album]], [[Grammy

Spruill argues that the anti-feminists led by Schlafly organized a highly successful counter-conference, the Pro-Life, Pro-Family Rally, to protest the National Women's Conference and make it clear that feminists did not speak for them. At their rally they announced the beginning of a pro-family movement, to oppose politicians who had been supporting [[feminism]] and [[liberalism]], and to promote \"[[family values]]\" in American politics, and so moved the Republican Party to the [[Rightwing|right]] and defeated the ratification of the ERA.<ref>Marjorie J.

By 1980, NOW downplayed the program, as they focused almost exclusively on ratification of the ERA.

It is a monument to foolish hopes, embarrassing compromises, betrayal of our servicemen, and a steady stream of insults to our nation. It is a [[Trojan Horse]] that carries the enemy into our midst and lures Americans to ride under alien insignia to fight and die in faraway lands.\" She opposed President [[Bill Clinton]]'s decision in 1996 to send 20,000 American troops to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] during the [[Yugoslav Wars]]. Schlafly noted that [[Balkan]] nations have fought one another for 500 years and that the U.S. military should not be [[Global police|\"policemen\" of world trouble spots]].<ref>Critchlow 2005, pp. 298\u201399</ref>\n\nPrior to the 1994 Congressional elections, Schlafly condemned [[globalization]] through the [[World Trade Organization]] as a \"direct attack on American [[sovereignty]], independence, jobs, and economy ... any country that must change its laws to obey rulings of a world organization has sacrificed its sovereignty.\"<ref>Critchlow 2005, p. 298</ref>\n\nIn late 2006, Schlafly collaborated with [[Jerome Corsi]] and [[Howard Phillips (politics)|Howard Phillips]] to create a website in opposition to the idea of a \"[[North American Union]]\", under which the United States, [[Mexico]], and Canada would share a currency and be integrated in a structure similar to the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2007/11/25/the_amero_conspiracy/?page=full|title=The amero conspiracy|last=Bennett|first=Drake|date=November 25, 2007|work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=February 20, 2009}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], Schlafly opposed [[arms control]] agreements with the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1961, she wrote that \"[arms control] will not stop [[Communist|Red]] aggression any more than disarming our local police will stop [[murder]], [[theft]], and rape.\"<ref>Phyllis Schlafly, \"Communist Master Plan for 1961\", ''Cardinal Mindszenty Newsletter'', February 15, 1961.</ref>\n\n===Judicial system===\nSchlafly was an outspoken critic of what she termed \"[[activist judge]]s\", particularly on the [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]. In 2005, Schlafly made headlines at a conference for the [[Judeo-Christian Council for Constitutional Restoration]] by suggesting that \"Congress ought to talk about impeachment\" of Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], citing as specific grounds Justice Kennedy's [[Roper v.

Spruill argues that the anti-feminists led by Schlafly organized a highly successful counter-conference, the Pro-Life, Pro-Family Rally, to protest the National Women's Conference and make it clear that feminists did not speak for them. At their rally they announced the beginning of a pro-family movement, to oppose politicians who had been supporting [[feminism]] and [[liberalism]], and to promote \"[[family values]]\" in American politics, and so moved the Republican Party to the [[Rightwing|right]] and defeated the ratification of the ERA.<ref>Marjorie J.

By 1980, NOW downplayed the program, as they focused almost exclusively on ratification of the ERA.

The film stars [[Jane Levy]], [[Dylan Minnette]], [[Daniel Zovatto]], and [[Stephen Lang]], and focuses on three friends who get trapped inside a blind man's house while breaking into it. The film was produced by [[Ghost House Pictures]] and [[Good Universe]] and distributed by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]].\n\nIn contrast to his previous work on ''[[Evil Dead (2013 film)|Evil Dead]]'', director \u00c1lvarez decided the project would have less blood, an original storyline, more suspense, and no dependence on spooky supernatural elements - which he felt was currently overused. The project, originally titled ''A Man in the Dark'', was later announced in early 2014, with \u00c1lvarez directing, Sayagues writing, Raimi and Tapert producing, and Levy starring. [[Principal photography]]\u00a0began on June 29, 2015, and wrapped in July 2015 in [[Detroit]].\n\n''Don't Breathe'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on March 12, 2016, and was theatrically released on August 26, 2016, by [[Screen Gems]] and [[Stage 6 Films]]. The film had grossed over $157 million and received largely positive reviews from critics, with many praising the performances (particularly Levy and Lang), direction, screenplay and tense atmosphere, and ''Magazine'' calling it \"the best American horror film in twenty years.\"\n\n== Plot ==\nRocky, Alex, and Money are three Detroit delinquents who make a living by breaking into houses and stealing valuables. Rocky longs to move to California with her younger sister, Diddy, and escape from their abusive mother and her alcoholic boyfriend. However, much to the trio's frustration, their [[Fence (criminal)|fence]] keeps undervaluing the items they bring.\n\nMoney receives a tip from their fence that a man has $300,000 in cash in his house in an abandoned Detroit neighborhood. The cash was reportedly a settlement after a wealthy young woman, Cindy Roberts, killed his daughter in a car accident. The three spy on the house and learn that the man, [[Gulf War]] veteran Norman Nordstrom, is blind.\n\nAt night, the three approach the house, drug Nordstrom's [[rottweiler]] dog, then find a way in. Money goes upstairs and puts a sleeping gas bottle in Nordstrom's bedroom. The group search the house but cannot find the money. Seeing a locked door, Money assumes the money is hidden down there and shoots the lock. The noise wakes up Nordstrom, who overpowers Money while Rocky and Alex hide. After Money insists he is alone, Nordstrom kills him. Rocky, who hides in the closet, witnesses the man open a hidden safe to check his money. After he leaves, she opens the safe and takes the money. However, Nordstrom finds Rocky's shoes and realizes that Money was not the only intruder.\n\nRocky and Alex evade Nordstrom and enter the basement. There, they find a restrained and gagged woman in a home-made padded cell. The woman reveals herself to be Cindy Roberts and that she was found innocent after the car accident. Rocky and Alex free her and attempt to open the storm cellar door. Nordstrom shoots at them and accidentally kills Cindy. He breaks down and cries in distraught over her dead body. Rocky and Alex rush back into the cellar while Nordstrom shuts off the lights, plunging them into darkness. After a blind struggle, Alex knocks out Nordstrom and they flee upstairs.\n\nAfter blocking the basement door, they encounter the dog, who has woken. They flee into the bedroom, where they are trapped by the barred windows. Rocky escapes the room through a ventilation duct, while the dog attacks Alex. He falls out of a window onto a skylight and is knocked out. When Alex awakens, Nordstrom shoots out the skylight and corners Alex in the utility room, appearing to kill him with a pair of garden shears. Meanwhile, the dog pursues Rocky through the vents, and she is captured by Nordstrom.\n\nRocky wakes up restrained in the basement. Nordstrom puts Cindy's corpse in a big metal box, fills it up with acid, and covers it up with a piece of the floor. He reveals that Cindy was pregnant with his \"replacement\" child, explaining he is not a rapist. He then prepares to artificially inseminate Rocky using a turkey baster and promises to let her go after she gives him a child. Alex, who survived by fooling Nordstrom to stab Money's corpse, saves Rocky, and handcuffs Nordstrom. Rocky and Alex use the turkey baster as a weapon on Nordstrom.\n\nRocky and Alex try to leave through the front door. Nordstrom breaks free and shoots Alex dead. Rocky flees as the dog pursues her. She manages to trap the dog in her car trunk but gets captured again by Nordstrom. Inside his house, Rocky disorientates him by setting off his house's alarm system, then hits him repeatedly in the head with a crowbar and pushes him into the basement. The gun fires into his side as he falls. Believing him dead, Rocky escapes before the police arrive.\n\nBefore boarding a train to Los Angeles, Rocky and Diddy see a news report about the incident. Nordstrom, who is recovering in a hospital, is reported to have killed two intruders (Alex and Money) in self-defense. He doesn't mention Rocky or the missing money. Rocky and Diddy board the train and leave.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jane Levy]] as Roxanne / \"Rocky\"\n* [[Stephen Lang]] as Norman Nordstrom / \"The Blind Man\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/dont-breathe-interview-fede-alvarez/ |title=Don\u2019t Breathe Director Fede Alvarez\u2019s Advice To Future Filmmakers |date=August 25, 2016 |publisher=}}</ref>\n* [[Dylan Minnette]] as Alex<ref>{{cite web |author=Rebecca Ford |url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/prisoners-actor-dylan-minnette-joins-797577 |title='Prisoners' Actor Dylan Minnette Joins Fede Alvarez's Horror Film (Exclusive) |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=2015-05-22 |accessdate=2015-10-24}}</ref>\n* [[Daniel Zovatto]] as Money<ref name=\"deadline1\">{{cite magazine |last=Lincoln |first=Ross A. |url=https://deadline.com/2015/05/actor-daniel-zovatto-joins-cast-of-fede-alvarez-a-man-in-the-dark-1201419359/ |title=\u2018A Man In The Dark\u2019 Casting: Daniel Zovatto Joins Fede Alvaraz Movie |magazine=Deadline |date=2015-05-01 |accessdate=2015-10-24}}</ref>\n* Franciska T\u00f6r\u0151csik as Cindy Roberts\n* Emma Bercovici as Diddy\n* Christian Zagia as Raul<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cooltivarte.com/portal/?s=Christian+Zagia |title=CHRISTIAN ZAGIA: EN LAS TABLAS |date=April 19, 2013 |publisher=}}</ref>\n* Katia Bokor as Ginger\n* Sergej Onopko as Trevor\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Fede \u00c1lvarez]] noted that making the film was, in some ways, a reaction to his debut film ''[[Evil Dead (2013 film)|Evil Dead]]'' (2013), specifically the criticisms that the film had too much blood, focused too much on shocking the audience, and was a remake.

The film stars [[Jane Levy]], [[Dylan Minnette]], [[Daniel Zovatto]], and [[Stephen Lang]], and focuses on three friends who get trapped inside a blind man's house while breaking into it. The film was produced by [[Ghost House Pictures]] and [[Good Universe]] and distributed by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]].\n\nIn contrast to his previous work on ''[[Evil Dead (2013 film)|Evil Dead]]'', director \u00c1lvarez decided the project would have less blood, an original storyline, more suspense, and no dependence on spooky supernatural elements - which he felt was currently overused. The project, originally titled ''A Man in the Dark'', was later announced in early 2014, with \u00c1lvarez directing, Sayagues writing, Raimi and Tapert producing, and Levy starring. [[Principal photography]]\u00a0began on June 29, 2015, and wrapped in July 2015 in [[Detroit]].\n\n''Don't Breathe'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on March 12, 2016, and was theatrically released on August 26, 2016, by [[Screen Gems]] and [[Stage 6 Films]]. The film had grossed over $157 million and received largely positive reviews from critics, with many praising the performances (particularly Levy and Lang), direction, screenplay and tense atmosphere, and ''Magazine'' calling it \"the best American horror film in twenty years.\"\n\n== Plot ==\nRocky, Alex, and Money are three Detroit delinquents who make a living by breaking into houses and stealing valuables. Rocky longs to move to California with her younger sister, Diddy, and escape from their abusive mother and her alcoholic boyfriend. However, much to the trio's frustration, their [[Fence (criminal)|fence]] keeps undervaluing the items they bring.\n\nMoney receives a tip from their fence that a man has $300,000 in cash in his house in an abandoned Detroit neighborhood. The cash was reportedly a settlement after a wealthy young woman, Cindy Roberts, killed his daughter in a car accident. The three spy on the house and learn that the man, [[Gulf War]] veteran Norman Nordstrom, is blind.\n\nAt night, the three approach the house, drug Nordstrom's [[rottweiler]] dog, then find a way in. Money goes upstairs and puts a sleeping gas bottle in Nordstrom's bedroom. The group search the house but cannot find the money. Seeing a locked door, Money assumes the money is hidden down there and shoots the lock. The noise wakes up Nordstrom, who overpowers Money while Rocky and Alex hide. After Money insists he is alone, Nordstrom kills him. Rocky, who hides in the closet, witnesses the man open a hidden safe to check his money. After he leaves, she opens the safe and takes the money. However, Nordstrom finds Rocky's shoes and realizes that Money was not the only intruder.\n\nRocky and Alex evade Nordstrom and enter the basement. There, they find a restrained and gagged woman in a home-made padded cell. The woman reveals herself to be Cindy Roberts and that she was found innocent after the car accident. Rocky and Alex free her and attempt to open the storm cellar door. Nordstrom shoots at them and accidentally kills Cindy. He breaks down and cries in distraught over her dead body. Rocky and Alex rush back into the cellar while Nordstrom shuts off the lights, plunging them into darkness. After a blind struggle, Alex knocks out Nordstrom and they flee upstairs.\n\nAfter blocking the basement door, they encounter the dog, who has woken. They flee into the bedroom, where they are trapped by the barred windows. Rocky escapes the room through a ventilation duct, while the dog attacks Alex. He falls out of a window onto a skylight and is knocked out. When Alex awakens, Nordstrom shoots out the skylight and corners Alex in the utility room, appearing to kill him with a pair of garden shears. Meanwhile, the dog pursues Rocky through the vents, and she is captured by Nordstrom.\n\nRocky wakes up restrained in the basement. Nordstrom puts Cindy's corpse in a big metal box, fills it up with acid, and covers it up with a piece of the floor. He reveals that Cindy was pregnant with his \"replacement\" child, explaining he is not a rapist. He then prepares to artificially inseminate Rocky using a turkey baster and promises to let her go after she gives him a child. Alex, who survived by fooling Nordstrom to stab Money's corpse, saves Rocky, and handcuffs Nordstrom. Rocky and Alex use the turkey baster as a weapon on Nordstrom.\n\nRocky and Alex try to leave through the front door. Nordstrom breaks free and shoots Alex dead. Rocky flees as the dog pursues her. She manages to trap the dog in her car trunk but gets captured again by Nordstrom. Inside his house, Rocky disorientates him by setting off his house's alarm system, then hits him repeatedly in the head with a crowbar and pushes him into the basement.
