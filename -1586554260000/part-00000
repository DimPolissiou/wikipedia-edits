It occurs naturally in [[Citrus|citrus fruits]]. In [[biochemistry]], it is an intermediate in the [[citric acid cycle]], which occurs in the [[metabolism]] of all [[aerobic organism]]s.\n\nMore than two million tons of citric acid [[Commodity chemicals|are manufactured]] every year. It is used widely as an [[acidifier]], as a [[flavoring]] and a [[chelating agent]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Apleblat |first1=Alexander |title=Citric acid |date=2014 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-11232-9}}</ref>\n\nA '''citrate''' is a derivative of citric acid; that is, the [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], [[ester]]s, and the [[polyatomic ion|polyatomic anion]] found in solution. An example of the former, a salt is [[trisodium citrate]]; an ester is [[triethyl citrate]]. When part of a salt, the formula of the citrate anion is written as {{chem|C|6|H|5|O|7|3-}} or {{chem|C|3|H|5|O(COO)|3|3-}}.\n\n==Natural occurrence and industrial production==\n[[File:Citrus fruits.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Lemons, oranges, limes, and other citrus fruits possess high concentrations of citric acid]]\nCitric acid exists in greater than trace amounts in a variety of fruits and vegetables, most notably [[Citrus|citrus fruit]]s. [[Lemon]]s and [[Lime (fruit)|limes]] have particularly high concentrations of the acid; it can constitute as much as 8% of the dry weight of these fruits (about 47&nbsp;[[gram per litre|g/l]] in the juices<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Penniston KL, Nakada SY, Holmes RP, Assimos DG| title=Quantitative Assessment of Citric Acid in Lemon Juice, Lime Juice, and Commercially-Available Fruit Juice Products | journal=Journal of Endourology | volume=22 | issue=3 | year=2008 | pmid=18290732 | pages = 567\u2013570 | doi = 10.1089/end.2007.0304 | pmc=2637791}}</ref>).{{efn|This still does not make the lemon particularly strongly acidic. This is because, as a weak acid, most of the acid molecules are not dissociated so not contributing to acidity inside the lemon or its juice.}}  The concentrations of citric acid in citrus fruits range from 0.005&nbsp;[[molarity|mol/L]] for oranges and grapefruits to 0.30&nbsp;mol/L in lemons and limes; these values vary within species depending upon the [[cultivar]] and the circumstances in which the fruit was grown.\n\nIndustrial-scale citric acid production first began in 1890 based on the Italian [[citrus fruit]] industry, where the juice was treated with hydrated lime ([[calcium hydroxide]]) to precipitate [[calcium citrate]], which was isolated and converted back to the acid using diluted [[sulfuric acid]].<ref name = ullmann/> In 1893, [[Carl Wehmer (chemist)|C. Wehmer]] discovered ''[[Penicillium]]'' [[mold]] could produce citric acid from sugar. However, microbial production of citric acid did not become industrially important until World War I disrupted Italian citrus exports.\n\nIn 1917, American food chemist James Currie discovered certain strains of the mold ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' could be efficient citric acid producers, and the pharmaceutical company [[Pfizer]] began industrial-level production using this technique two years later, followed by [[Citrique Belge]] in 1929. \nIn this production technique, which is still the major industrial route to citric acid used today, cultures of ''A. niger'' are fed on a [[sucrose]] or [[glucose]]-containing medium to produce citric acid. The source of sugar is [[corn steep liquor]], molasses, hydrolyzed [[corn starch]], or other inexpensive, sugary solution.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Walid A. |last=Lotfy |first2=Khaled M. |last2=Ghanem |first3=Ehab R. |last3=El-Helow |year=2007 |title=Citric acid production by a novel ''Aspergillus niger'' isolate: II.

The pH of fruit juices from [[citrus fruit]]s like oranges and lemons depends on the citric acid concentration, being lower for higher acid concentration and conversely.\n\n[[Acid salt]]s of citric acid can be prepared by careful adjustment of the pH before crystallizing the compound. See, for example, [[sodium citrate]].\n\nThe citrate ion forms complexes with metallic cations. The [[stability constants of complexes|stability constant]]s for the formation of these complexes are quite large because of the [[chelate effect]]. Consequently, it forms complexes even with alkali metal cations. However, when a chelate complex is formed using all three carboxylate groups, the chelate rings have 7 and 8 members, which are generally less stable thermodynamically than smaller chelate rings. In consequence, the hydroxyl group can be deprotonated, forming part of a more stable 5-membered ring, as in [[ammonium ferric citrate]], {{chem|(NH|4|)|5|Fe(C|6|H|4|O|7|)|2}}\u00b72{{chem|H|2|O}}.<ref>{{cite journal\n| first= M.| last= Matzapetakis\n| first2= C.

[[Citrate synthase]] catalyzes the condensation of [[oxaloacetate]] with acetyl CoA to form citrate. Citrate then acts as the substrate for [[aconitase]] and is converted into [[aconitic acid]]. The cycle ends with regeneration of oxaloacetate. This series of chemical reactions is the source of two-thirds of the food-derived energy in higher organisms. [[Hans Adolf Krebs]] received the 1953 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for the discovery.\n\nSome bacteria (notably ''[[E. coli]]'') can produce and consume citrate internally as part of their TCA cycle, but are unable to use it as food because they lack the enzymes required to import it into the cell.  After tens of thousand of evolutions in a minimal glucose medium that also contained citrate during [[Richard Lenski]]'s [[E. coli long-term evolution experiment|Long-Term Evolution Experiment]], a variant ''E. coli'' evolved with the ability to grow aerobically on citrate. [[Zachary Blount]], a student of Lenski's, and colleagues studied these \"Cit<sup>+</sup>\" ''E. coli''<ref name=\"Powell\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Alvin|title=59,000 generations of bacteria, plus freezer, yield startling results|url=https://phys.org/news/2014-02-bacteria-freezer-yield-startling-results.html|website=phys.org|accessdate=April 13, 2017|date=February 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Blount et al.\">{{cite journal|last1=Blount|first1=Z.

They found evidence that, in this case, the innovation was caused by a rare duplication mutation due to the accumulation of several prior \"potentiating\" mutations, the identity and effects of which are still under study. The evolution of the Cit<sup>+</sup> trait has been considered a notable example of the role of historical contingency in evolution.\n\n===Other biological roles===\n\nCitrate can be transported out of the [[mitochondria]] and into the cytoplasm, then broken down into [[acetyl-CoA]] for [[fatty acid synthesis]], and into oxaloacetate. Citrate is a positive modulator of this conversion, and allosterically regulates the enzyme [[acetyl-CoA carboxylase]], which is the regulating enzyme in the conversion of acetyl-CoA into [[malonyl-CoA]] (the commitment step in fatty acid synthesis).  In short, citrate is transported into the cytoplasm, converted into acetyl CoA, which is then converted into malonyl CoA by acetyl CoA carboxylase, which is allosterically modulated by citrate.\n\nHigh concentrations of cytosolic citrate can inhibit [[phosphofructokinase]], the catalyst of a rate-limiting step of [[glycolysis]]. This effect is advantageous: high concentrations of citrate indicate that there is a large supply of biosynthetic precursor molecules, so there is no need for phosphofructokinase to continue to send molecules of its substrate, [[fructose 6-phosphate]], into glycolysis. Citrate acts by augmenting the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], another sign that there is no need to carry out glycolysis.<ref name=\"Tightly Controlled\">{{cite book|last1=Stryer|first1=Lubert|last2=Berg|first2=Jeremy|last3=Tymoczko|first3=John|title=Biochemistry|date=2003|publisher=Freeman|location=New York|isbn=978-0716746843|edition=5. ed., international ed., 3. printing|chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22395/|chapter=Section 16.2: The Glycolytic Pathway Is Tightly Controlled}}</ref>\n\nCitrate is a vital component of bone, helping to regulate the size of [[apatite]] crystals.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Hu |first1= Y.-Y. |last2= Rawal |first2= A. |last3= Schmidt-Rohr |first3= K. |title= Strongly bound citrate stabilizes the apatite nanocrystals in bone |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume= 107 |pages= 22425\u201322429 |date=December 2010 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.1009219107 |pmid= 21127269 |pmc= 3012505 |issue=52|bibcode= 2010PNAS..10722425H }}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Food and drink===\n[[File:Lemon pepper preparation.jpg|thumb|Powdered citric acid being used to prepare [[lemon pepper]] seasoning]]\nBecause it is one of the stronger edible acids, the dominant use of citric acid is as a flavoring and preservative in food and beverages, especially soft drinks and candies.<ref name = ullmann/> Within the [[European Union]] it is denoted by [[E number]] '''E330'''.

Citric acid sold in a dry powdered form is commonly sold in markets and groceries as \"sour salt\", due to its physical resemblance to table salt.

By chelating the metals in [[hard water]], it lets these cleaners produce foam and work better without need for water softening. Citric acid is the active ingredient in some bathroom and kitchen cleaning solutions. A solution with a six percent concentration of citric acid will remove hard water stains from glass without scrubbing. Citric acid can be used in shampoo to wash out wax and coloring from the hair. Illustrative of its chelating abilities, citric acid was the first successful [[eluant]] used for total ion-exchange separation of the [[lanthanide]]s, during the [[Manhattan Project]] in the 1940s.

However, microbial production of citric acid did not become industrially important until World War I disrupted Italian citrus exports.\n\nIn 1917, American food chemist James Currie discovered certain strains of the mold ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' could be efficient citric acid producers, and the pharmaceutical company [[Pfizer]] began industrial-level production using this technique two years later, followed by [[Citrique Belge]] in 1929. \nIn this production technique, which is still the major industrial route to citric acid used today, cultures of ''A. niger'' are fed on a [[sucrose]] or [[glucose]]-containing medium to produce citric acid.

[[Citrate synthase]] catalyzes the condensation of [[oxaloacetate]] with acetyl CoA to form citrate. Citrate then acts as the substrate for [[aconitase]] and is converted into [[aconitic acid]]. The cycle ends with regeneration of oxaloacetate. This series of chemical reactions is the source of two-thirds of the food-derived energy in higher organisms. [[Hans Adolf Krebs]] received the 1953 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for the discovery.\n\nSome bacteria (notably ''[[E. coli]]'') can produce and consume citrate internally as part of their TCA cycle, but are unable to use it as food because they lack the enzymes required to import it into the cell.  After tens of thousand of evolutions in a minimal glucose medium that also contained citrate during [[Richard Lenski]]'s [[E. coli long-term evolution experiment|Long-Term Evolution Experiment]], a variant ''E. coli'' evolved with the ability to grow aerobically on citrate. [[Zachary Blount]], a student of Lenski's, and colleagues studied these \"Cit<sup>+</sup>\" ''E. coli''<ref name=\"Powell\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Alvin|title=59,000 generations of bacteria, plus freezer, yield startling results|url=https://phys.org/news/2014-02-bacteria-freezer-yield-startling-results.html|website=phys.org|accessdate=April 13, 2017|date=February 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Blount et al.\">{{cite journal|last1=Blount|first1=Z.

They found evidence that, in this case, the innovation was caused by a rare duplication mutation due to the accumulation of several prior \"potentiating\" mutations, the identity and effects of which are still under study. The evolution of the Cit<sup>+</sup> trait has been considered a notable example of the role of historical contingency in evolution.\n\n===Other biological roles===\n\nCitrate can be transported out of the [[mitochondria]] and into the cytoplasm, then broken down into [[acetyl-CoA]] for [[fatty acid synthesis]], and into oxaloacetate. Citrate is a positive modulator of this conversion, and allosterically regulates the enzyme [[acetyl-CoA carboxylase]], which is the regulating enzyme in the conversion of acetyl-CoA into [[malonyl-CoA]] (the commitment step in fatty acid synthesis).  In short, citrate is transported into the cytoplasm, converted into acetyl CoA, which is then converted into malonyl CoA by acetyl CoA carboxylase, which is allosterically modulated by citrate.\n\nHigh concentrations of cytosolic citrate can inhibit [[phosphofructokinase]], the catalyst of a rate-limiting step of [[glycolysis]]. This effect is advantageous: high concentrations of citrate indicate that there is a large supply of biosynthetic precursor molecules, so there is no need for phosphofructokinase to continue to send molecules of its substrate, [[fructose 6-phosphate]], into glycolysis. Citrate acts by augmenting the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], another sign that there is no need to carry out glycolysis.<ref name=\"Tightly Controlled\">{{cite book|last1=Stryer|first1=Lubert|last2=Berg|first2=Jeremy|last3=Tymoczko|first3=John|title=Biochemistry|date=2003|publisher=Freeman|location=New York|isbn=978-0716746843|edition=5. ed., international ed., 3. printing|chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22395/|chapter=Section 16.2: The Glycolytic Pathway Is Tightly Controlled}}</ref>\n\nCitrate is a vital component of bone, helping to regulate the size of [[apatite]] crystals.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Hu |first1= Y.-Y. |last2= Rawal |first2= A. |last3= Schmidt-Rohr |first3= K. |title= Strongly bound citrate stabilizes the apatite nanocrystals in bone |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume= 107 |pages= 22425\u201322429 |date=December 2010 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.1009219107 |pmid= 21127269 |pmc= 3012505 |issue=52|bibcode= 2010PNAS..10722425H }}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Food and drink===\n[[File:Lemon pepper preparation.jpg|thumb|Powdered citric acid being used to prepare [[lemon pepper]] seasoning]]\nBecause it is one of the stronger edible acids, the dominant use of citric acid is as a flavoring and preservative in food and beverages, especially soft drinks and candies.<ref name = ullmann/> Within the [[European Union]] it is denoted by [[E number]] '''E330'''.

The [[Whitney family]] remain to this day a leading name in the sport of [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse race|horse racing]].\n\nArtful raced in the days when horses could be \"declared\" to win. This meant that if a stable entered more than one of its horses, it would announce beforehand which horse they expected to win the event.\n\n==Racing career==\nIn both of Artful's first two starts at age two at [[Saratoga Race Course]] (a track that William Collins Whitney had a hand in rejuvenating), her stablemate was declared to win against her.  In the first of these races in August 1904 that horse was her stablemate Dreamer.  In order to achieve this result, Artful had to be held back. Frank Brunnell of ''[[The Daily Racing Form]]'' hailed her as \"a genuine crackerjack\" who should have won both races with ease. On both occasions it was written that she was: \"\u2026hard held and close up throughout, finished as easily and probably could have won the race.\"  Her second race was won by Princess Rupert.\n\nThese two \"declared\" races would be the only races Artful ever lost.\n\nIn her third \"undeclared\" race, the [[Belmont Futurity Stakes|Futurity Stakes]], Artful handed [[Sysonby]] his only defeat by five lengths. Artful's victory was also over a field of exceptional strength (and said at the time to be the finest juvenile field ever assembled): the [[Canada|Canadian]] champion [[Oiseau (horse)|Oiseau]], the fillies and future classic winners [[Tanya (horse)|Tanya]] and [[Agile (horse)|Agile]], and the unbeaten filly Tradition.  Artful raced four days later in the winning the Great Filly Stakes. She then took the White Plains Handicap under 130 pounds, giving away 29 pounds to a colt named Dandelion, and setting a new track record of 1:08 for six [[furlong]]s.  That record stood for fifty years, only broken on a straight course and under a much lighter burden of 115 pounds.\n\nWilliam Whitney died in Artful's two-year-old season and his son, [[Harry Payne Whitney]], succeeded him.\n\nIn her three-year-old season, Artful won two sprints to prepare for the Brighton Handicap which she took \"pulling up,\" (slowing down).  She defeated, [[Beldame]] as well as [[Delhi (horse)|Delhi]], the 1904 winner of the [[Belmont Stakes]].  Her last win was a quarter of a mile race.\n\n==Stud record==\nAs a broodmare, Artful did not reproduce herself.  Her few foals were winners but not stakes winners.  She died in 1927 at the age of twenty five.\n\n==References==\n\n* \"''The History of Thoroughbred Racing in America''\" by William H.P.

Such efforts include installing sand filtration systems for the stores' wastewater.

All stores in [[Oklahoma]] will be partnered with [[Oklahoma Gas & Electric]] to exclusively use [[wind power]] for all Target stores in order to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. Stores nationwide use only [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] and [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lights]] and low-flow restrooms that reduce wastewater by 30%. Some Target stores are installing roof gardens or [[green roof]]s, which absorb stormwater and cut down on [[surface runoff]], mitigate temperature fluctuations and provide habitats for birds. There are currently four green-roof Target stores in [[Chicago]].\n\nTarget carries over 700 organic and alternative products from brands such as [[Archer Farms]], [[Burt's Bees]], and [[Method Products]].

Also, managers are known as \"Executive Team Leaders (ETLs),\" \"Senior Team Leaders (SRTLs),\" or \"Guest Service Team Leaders (GSTLs)\" and the Store Manager is known as the \"Store Team Leader (STL)\". Further up the \"chain of command\" are \"District Team Leaders (DTL)\", \"Group Team Leaders (GTL) (sometimes also Group Vice President)\", Regional Team Leaders (RTL) (sometimes also Regional Vice President), and finally corporate-level executives.\n\nThis practice began to be revised in 2018 and became more widespread in 2019 as the Group Team Leader became the Group Operations Director. District Team Leader became the District Senior Director. The Store Team Leader became Store Director. Executive Team Leaders were shortened to Executive Team Lead. Other Team Leaders retained their title though some of the department names changed such as Guest Service Team Leader was renamed Service & Engagement Team Leader. Front of store team members was renamed Guest Advocates. Specialty areas in Style, Beauty and Tech are considered Consultants. Other areas such as General Merchandise, Presentation, Inbound, Fulfillment, Food Service and Reverse Logistics are considered Experts.\n\n===Product lines and partnerships===\nTarget has many exclusive deals with various designers and name brands, including Finnish design company [[Marimekko]]; architect [[Michael Graves]]; athletic wear company [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]]; Portland-based undergarment designer [[Pair of Thieves]]; Italian fashion label [[Fiorucci]]; fashion designers [[Lilly Pulitzer]], [[Liz Lange]], [[Mossimo|Mossimo Giannulli]], and [[Isaac Mizrahi]], among others.

Stores nationwide use only [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] and [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lights]] and low-flow restrooms that reduce wastewater by 30%. Some Target stores are installing roof gardens or [[green roof]]s, which absorb stormwater and cut down on [[surface runoff]], mitigate temperature fluctuations and provide habitats for birds.

Douglas J. Dayton, one of the Dayton brothers, explained John Geisse's concept:\n{{cquote|\"We will offer high-quality merchandise at low margins because we are cutting expenses. We would much rather do this than trumpet dramatic price cuts on cheap merchandise.\"<ref name=growth/>}}\n\nAs a result, Target stores tend to attract younger customers than Walmart, among other competitors. The [[median]] Target shopper is 40, the youngest of all major discount retailers that Target competes directly against. The median household income of Target's customer base is roughly $64,000. Roughly 76% of Target customers are female, and more than 43% have children at home. About 80% have attended college and 57% have completed college.<ref name=community>{{cite web|url=http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/grad/html/gfinfo.html |title=Community of Grand Forks |accessdate=June 11, 2007 |publisher=University of North Dakota |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219205819/http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/grad/html/gfinfo.html |archivedate=December 19, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=factcard>{{cite web| url=http://sites.target.com/images/corporate/about/pdfs/corp_factcard_101107.pdf| title=Corporate Fact Card| publisher=Target Corporation| date=October 10, 2007| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128161431/http://sites.target.com/images/corporate/about/pdfs/corp_factcard_101107.pdf| archivedate=November 28, 2007| df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2008, Target announced plans to fight the perception that their products are more expensive than those of other discount retailers. It added perishables to their inventory, cut back on discretionary items, and spent three-quarters of their marketing budget on advertising that emphasizes value and includes actual prices of items featured in ads.

Special attention is given to the design of the store environment: graphics reinforce its advertising imagery, while shelves are dressed with contemporary signage, backdrops, and liners, often printed on inexpensive material such as paper, corrugated and foam boards. Some stores, particularly those in the vicinity of major airports, have a [[bullseye (target)|bullseye]] painted on the roof that can be seen from above: the stores in [[East Point, Georgia]] near [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]]; [[Rosemont, Illinois]], near [[O'Hare International Airport]]; [[Potomac Yard|Potomac Yard, Virginia]], near [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]]; [[College Point, New York]] (Queens), east of [[LaGuardia Airport]]; and [[Richfield, Minnesota]], adjacent to [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul International Airport]] are among such locations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Target+loc:+Rosemont,+Illinois&ie=UTF8&z=18&ll=42.006903,-87.887095&spn=0.00287,0.006748&t=k&om=1 |title= Target on rooftop in Rosemont, IL |publisher=Google Maps |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nTarget stores do not sell [[firearm]]s.

Though this practice is often attributed to [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s usage on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|her television show]], it is first attested in 1962, the year the first Target store opened.

Also, managers are known as \"Executive Team Leaders (ETLs),\" \"Senior Team Leaders (SRTLs),\" or \"Guest Service Team Leaders (GSTLs)\" and the Store Manager is known as the \"Store Team Leader (STL)\". Further up the \"chain of command\" are \"District Team Leaders (DTL)\", \"Group Team Leaders (GTL) (sometimes also Group Vice President)\", Regional Team Leaders (RTL) (sometimes also Regional Vice President), and finally corporate-level executives.\n\nThis practice began to be revised in 2018 and became more widespread in 2019 as the Group Team Leader became the Group Operations Director. District Team Leader became the District Senior Director. The Store Team Leader became Store Director. Executive Team Leaders were shortened to Executive Team Lead. Other Team Leaders retained their title though some of the department names changed such as Guest Service Team Leader was renamed Service & Engagement Team Leader. Front of store team members was renamed Guest Advocates. Specialty areas in Style, Beauty and Tech are considered Consultants. Other areas such as General Merchandise, Presentation, Inbound, Fulfillment, Food Service and Reverse Logistics are considered Experts.\n\n===Product lines and partnerships===\nTarget has many exclusive deals with various designers and name brands, including Finnish design company [[Marimekko]]; architect [[Michael Graves]]; athletic wear company [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]]; Portland-based undergarment designer [[Pair of Thieves]]; Italian fashion label [[Fiorucci]]; fashion designers [[Lilly Pulitzer]], [[Liz Lange]], [[Mossimo|Mossimo Giannulli]], and [[Isaac Mizrahi]], among others.

For example, some such Target GiftCard designs feature a wooden front side. On May 24, 2005, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] granted U.S. patent D505,450 for the \"ornamental design for credit or stored value card with wood layer\" to inventors Amy L.

Some of the first gift cards issued are valued at over $300 (even though the card doesn't have any money on it). Every year, Target introduces new Holiday GiftCards.

Throughout the two-year period, the trial was being closely followed by the public of the involved former Yugoslav republics as it covered various notable events from the war and included several high-profile witnesses.\n\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107 died before the trial could be concluded; he was therefore never found guilty of the charges brought against him.\n \nThe ICTY in its ruling of the case against  Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 stated \"there was no sufficient evidence presented in this case to find that Slobodan Milosevic agreed with the common plan [to create territories ethnically cleansed of non-Serbs].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/milosevic-war-crime-deniers-feed-receptive-audience/27910664.html|title=Milosevic 'Exonerated'?

While at the university, he befriended [[Ivan Stamboli\u0107]], whose uncle [[Petar Stamboli\u0107]] had been a president of Serbian Executive Council (the Communist equivalent of a prime minister). This was to prove a crucial connection for Milo\u0161evi\u0107's career prospects, as Stamboli\u0107 sponsored his rise through the SKJ hierarchy.\n\nAfter his graduation in 1966, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 became an economic advisor to Mayor of [[Belgrade]] [[Branko Pe\u0161i\u0107]].

Milo\u0161evi\u0107 claimed that ethnic Albanian authorities had abused their powers, that the autonomy of Kosovo was allowing the entrenchment of separatism in Kosovo, and that the rights of the Serbs in the province were being regularly violated. As a solution, he called for political change to reduce the autonomy, protect minority Serb rights, and initiate a strong crackdown on separatism in Kosovo.\n\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107 was criticized by opponents, who claimed he and his allies were attempting to strengthen the position of Serbs in Yugoslavia at the expense of Kosovar Albanians and other nationalities, a policy they accused of being nationalist, which was a [[taboo]] in the Yugoslav Communist system and effectively a political crime, as nationalism was identified as a violation of the Yugoslav Communists' commitment to [[Brotherhood and Unity]]. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 always denied allegations that he was a nationalist or that he exploited Serbian nationalism in his rise to power. In a 1995 interview with ''[[Time magazine|TIME]]'', he defended himself from these accusations by claiming he stood for every nationality in Yugoslavia (though he made no direct or indirect mention of [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] or [[Montenegrins]] who are often seen by nationalist Serbs as being Serbs by ethnic heritage): \"All my speeches up to '89 were published in my book.

In the five-man presidential race held on 24 September 2000, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was defeated in the first round by opposition leader [[Vojislav Ko\u0161tunica]], who won slightly more than 50% of the vote.

The Yugoslav constitution called for a runoff between the top two candidates in the event that no candidate won more than 50% of the vote.
