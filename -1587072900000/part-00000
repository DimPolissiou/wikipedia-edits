Because the [[Argentine Football Association]] did not accept commercial company names, the club had to change its name to \"Club Deportivo Mandiy\u00fa\", which means [[cotton]] in the indigenous language of [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]].\n\n===The club at its peak===\n\nAfter becoming the most successful team of Liga Correntina, Mandiy\u00fa started its professional career in 1985 entering the [[Primera B Nacional]].

Some of its most notable players were [[Adolfino Ca\u00f1ete]], [[Jos\u00e9 Horacio Basualdo|Jos\u00e9 Basualdo]] and Pedro Barrios.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elgrafico.com.ar/articulo/1090/33970/1988-%C2%A1mandiyu-pora!|title=1988. \u00a1Mandiy\u00fa por\u00e1!|publisher=El Grafico|date=12 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988 Mandiy\u00fa nearly qualified to [[Copa Libertadores]] playing a mini-tournament with [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]]. Both matches finished 1\u20131 but San Lorenzo passed to the next stage due to its best position in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n tournament.\n\nMandiy\u00fa achieved some notable performances during its third tenure on the Argentine top division, with notable victories over [[Boca Juniors]] (2\u20131), [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Independiente|Independiente]] (3\u20130), [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing]] (4\u20133) and San Lorenzo (3\u20132). Forwards [[F\u00e9lix Torres]] and Jos\u00e9 Blanchart scored 13 goals each. The best campaign in Primera ever was in the 1991 Clausura, where Mandiy\u00fa finished 3rd to Boca Juniors and San Lorenzo. Although Mandiy\u00fa did not get tremendous results, it ranked 2nd among the teams with less goals received during the tournament. Due to there was no limits to hire foreign players by then, Mandiy\u00fa had many Paraguayan and Uruguayan players.\n\nMandiy\u00fa finished 6th in the 1991 Apertura, only 4 points to champion River Plate. The next season (1992 Clausura), the squad made a poor campaign, finishing 18th.\n\n===Demise===\nIn 1993, then Mandiy\u00fa chairman Eduardo Seferian tried the club to become a [[S.A. (corporation)|S.A.]] as a way to solve the serious economic problems of the institution. In 1994 he sold the club to a member of Argentine Parliament Roberto Cruz and San Lorenzo leading Roberto Navarro for the amount of [[US Dollar|U$S]] 2 million. Mandiy\u00fa keep Guido Alvarenga as a part of the team, hired [[Diego Maradona]] as coach, and also bring the international goalkeeper [[Sergio Goycochea]].\n\nThe project was wrong, Mandiy\u00fa did a disappointing campaign in 1995 Clausura being relegated to the second division. Finally, the group that managed Mandiy\u00fa sold the club to Romero Ferix for the price of $1. Romero Ferix decided that hurac\u00e1n de Corrientes plays the second league instead of Mandiy\u00fa because Hurac\u00e1n de Corrientes already has an stadium, Mandiy\u00fa was disaffiliated from the Liga Correntina.\n\n[[Hurac\u00e1n Corrientes]] filled the vacant place left by Mandiy\u00fa, promoting to Primera Divisi\u00f3n after winning the Nacional B championship. In 1998, a group of former managers and fans of Mandiy\u00fa decided to form a new club, originally named \"Deportivo Textil\". The word \"Mandiy\u00fa\" was added later, with the intention of keeping the soul of the original club.<ref>[http://442.perfil.com/2012-05-19-130328-los-dos-mandiyu-de-corrientes/ \"Los dos Mandiy\u00fa de Corrientes\"], Diario Perfil, 2012-05-19</ref>\n\n===Return===\nIn 2010, the club was allowed to participate in the Liga Correntina again.

Forwards [[F\u00e9lix Torres]] and Jos\u00e9 Blanchart scored 13 goals each. The best campaign in Primera ever was in the 1991 Clausura, where Mandiy\u00fa finished 3rd to Boca Juniors and San Lorenzo. Although Mandiy\u00fa did not get tremendous results, it ranked 2nd among the teams with less goals received during the tournament. Due to there was no limits to hire foreign players by then, Mandiy\u00fa had many Paraguayan and Uruguayan players.\n\nMandiy\u00fa finished 6th in the 1991 Apertura, only 4 points to champion River Plate. The next season (1992 Clausura), the squad made a poor campaign, finishing 18th.\n\n===Demise===\nIn 1993, then Mandiy\u00fa chairman Eduardo Seferian tried the club to become a [[S.A. (corporation)|S.A.]] as a way to solve the serious economic problems of the institution. In 1994 he sold the club to a member of Argentine Parliament Roberto Cruz and San Lorenzo leading Roberto Navarro for the amount of [[US Dollar|U$S]] 2 million. Mandiy\u00fa keep Guido Alvarenga as a part of the team, hired [[Diego Maradona]] as coach, and also bring the international goalkeeper [[Sergio Goycochea]].\n\nThe project was wrong, Mandiy\u00fa did a disappointing campaign in 1995 Clausura being relegated to the second division. Finally, the group that managed Mandiy\u00fa sold the club to Romero Ferix for the price of $1. Romero Ferix decided that hurac\u00e1n de Corrientes plays the second league instead of Mandiy\u00fa because Hurac\u00e1n de Corrientes already has an stadium, Mandiy\u00fa was disaffiliated from the Liga Correntina.\n\n[[Hurac\u00e1n Corrientes]] filled the vacant place left by Mandiy\u00fa, promoting to Primera Divisi\u00f3n after winning the Nacional B championship. In 1998, a group of former managers and fans of Mandiy\u00fa decided to form a new club, originally named \"Deportivo Textil\". The word \"Mandiy\u00fa\" was added later, with the intention of keeping the soul of the original club.<ref>[http://442.perfil.com/2012-05-19-130328-los-dos-mandiyu-de-corrientes/ \"Los dos Mandiy\u00fa de Corrientes\"], Diario Perfil, 2012-05-19</ref>\n\n===Return===\nIn 2010, the club was allowed to participate in the Liga Correntina again. On May 8, 2011, Deportivo Mandiy\u00fa made its debut in the second division of the league, defeating Nueva Valencia by 3\u20130.<ref>[http://futbolcorrentino.blogspot.com/2011/05/deportivo-mandiyu-gano-en-su-debut.html \"Deportivo Mandiy\u00fa gan\u00f3 en su debut\", at F\u00fatbolCorrentino website, May 2011]</ref> On August 22, Mandiy\u00fa promoted to the top division of Correntino league, remaining undefeated along the tournament.\n\nDeportivo Mandiy\u00fa is currently playing the [[Torneo Argentino B]], which arrived after being invited by the Consejo Federal de F\u00fatbol,<ref>[http://www.momarandu.com/amanoticias.php?a=0&b=0&c=124636 \"Deportivo Mandiy\u00fa, Hurac\u00e1n de Goya y Comunicaciones al Argentino B\" at Momarandu.com]</ref> along with its relative club [[Textil Mandiy\u00fa]].<ref>[http://www.ellitoral.com.ar/es/articulo/212352/Textil-Mandiyu-fue-invitado-al-Argentino-B \"Textil Mandiy\u00fa fue invitado al Argentino B\" on ''El Litoral'', 8 August 2012]</ref><ref>[http://www.ascensodelinterior.com.ar/noticias/487/los-invitados-al-torneo-argentino-b-20122013/ \"Los invitados al Torneo Argentino B\" at Ascenso del Interior website, 1 August 2012]</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n\n===Domestic===\n*'''[[Primera B Nacional]]: 1'''\n:: [[1987-88 Primera B Nacional|1987\u201388]]\n*'''Torneo del Interior: 1'''\n:: 1985\u201386\n\n===Regional===\n*'''Liga Correntina: 10'''\n:: 1958, 1960, 1963, 1973, 1976, 1979, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1990\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130522221641/http://deportivomandiyu.com.ar/ Official website]\n*[http://www.mandiyulokura.blogspot.com.ar Mandiy\u00fa Lokura]\n*[http://locopormandiyu.blogspot.com.ar/ Loco x Mandiy\u00fa]\n\n{{Torneo Federal A}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Deportivo Mandiyu}}\n[[Category:Football clubs in Corrientes Province|M]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 1952|M]]\n[[Category:1952 establishments in Argentina|M]]\n", "name_user": "Red Jay", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFoundation and regional success:Spelling/grammar/punctuation/typographical correction", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportivo_Mandiy%C3%BA"}

The first historically certain bishop is Marcus (c. 743).\n\nIn 1391, the diocese of Lucera was increased by the addition of the bishopric of [[Castel Fiorentino]] (Farentino), a city founded in 1015 by the Byzantine [[catapan]] [[Basileios, Catepan of Italy|Basil Mesardonites]], and the place of [[Emperor Frederick II]]'s death.\n\nAfter 1409, the diocese of [[Tortiboli]] - created before 1236 -  was united to Lucera, although under its Latin name Tortibulum it remains a [[titular diocese]].<ref>held since 2001 by [[Joseph Vu Duy Thong]], Auxiliary [[Bishop of Ho Chi Minh City]] in Vietnam.</ref>\n\nIn 1818, the united dioceses of [[Motta Montecorvino|Montecorvino]] and [[Vulturaria (titular see)|Vulturaria]] were added to Lucera.
