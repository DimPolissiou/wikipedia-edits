Basquiat first achieved fame as part of [[SAMO]], an informal [[graffiti]] duo who wrote enigmatic [[epigram]]s in the cultural hotbed of the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] during the late 1970s, where [[rap]], [[punk visual art|punk]], and [[street art]] coalesced into early [[hip-hop music]] culture. By the 1980s, his [[Neo-expressionism|neo-expressionist]] paintings were being exhibited in galleries and museums internationally. The [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] held a retrospective of his art in 1992.\n\nBasquiat's art focused on dichotomies such as wealth versus poverty, integration versus segregation, and inner versus outer experience. He [[Appropriation (art)|appropriated]] poetry, drawing, and painting, and married text and image, [[Abstract art|abstraction]], [[Figurative art|figuration]], and historical information mixed with contemporary critique.\n\nBasquiat used [[social commentary]] in his paintings as a tool for introspection and for identifying with his experiences in the black community of his time, as well as attacks on [[Power (social and political)|power structures]] and systems of racism.

Before his career as a painter began, he produced punk-inspired postcards for sale on the street, and became known for the political\u2013poetical graffiti under the name of [[SAMO]]. On one occasion Basquiat painted his girlfriend's dress with the words \"Little Shit Brown\". He would often draw on random objects and surfaces, including other people's property.

The years 1984\u201385 were also the main period of the Basquiat\u2013Warhol collaborations, even if, in general, they were not very well received by the critics. A major reference source used by Basquiat throughout his career was the book ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'', which his mother had given him while he was in the hospital aged seven. It remained influential in his depictions of internal human anatomy, and in its mixture of image and text. Other major sources were Henry Dreyfuss' ''Symbol Sourcebook'', [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s notebooks, and Burchard Brentjes' ''African Rock Art''.\n\n===Heroes and saints===\nA prominent theme in the early Basquiat portrayed historically prominent black figures, such as [[Charlie Parker]], who were identified by Basquiat as black heroes and saints. These were often identified with the iconographic depiction of crowns and halos to distinguish heroes and saints in Basquiat's specially chosen pantheon. As the ''Art Daily'' described Basquiat's show in the Bilbao Guggenheim: \"The show is divided into eight different sections on the Museum's third floor and begins in Gallery 305, where his earliest creations are displayed under two themes: \u201cStreet as Studio\u201d and \u201cHeroes and Saints\u201d.

Basquiat first achieved fame as part of [[SAMO]], an informal [[graffiti]] duo who wrote enigmatic [[epigram]]s in the cultural hotbed of the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] during the late 1970s, where [[rap]], [[punk visual art|punk]], and [[street art]] coalesced into early [[hip-hop music]] culture. By the 1980s, his [[Neo-expressionism|neo-expressionist]] paintings were being exhibited in galleries and museums internationally. The [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] held a retrospective of his art in 1992.\n\nBasquiat's art focused on dichotomies such as wealth versus poverty, integration versus segregation, and inner versus outer experience. He [[Appropriation (art)|appropriated]] poetry, drawing, and painting, and married text and image, [[Abstract art|abstraction]], [[Figurative art|figuration]], and historical information mixed with contemporary critique.\n\nBasquiat used [[social commentary]] in his paintings as a tool for introspection and for identifying with his experiences in the black community of his time, as well as attacks on [[Power (social and political)|power structures]] and systems of racism. Basquiat's visual poetics were acutely [[Political criticism|political]] and direct in their criticism of [[colonialism]] and support for [[Class conflict|class struggle]].

A major reference source used by Basquiat throughout his career was the book ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'', which his mother had given him while he was in the hospital aged seven. It remained influential in his depictions of internal human anatomy, and in its mixture of image and text. Other major sources were Henry Dreyfuss' ''Symbol Sourcebook'', [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s notebooks, and Burchard Brentjes' ''African Rock Art''.\n\n===Heroes and saints===\nA prominent theme in the early Basquiat portrayed historically prominent black figures, such as [[Charlie Parker]], who were identified by Basquiat as black heroes and saints. These were often identified with the iconographic depiction of crowns and halos to distinguish heroes and saints in Basquiat's specially chosen pantheon. As the ''Art Daily'' described Basquiat's show in the Bilbao Guggenheim: \"The show is divided into eight different sections on the Museum's third floor and begins in Gallery 305, where his earliest creations are displayed under two themes: \u201cStreet as Studio\u201d and \u201cHeroes and Saints\u201d.

According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 1,673 and is the administrative center of [[Gusinje Municipality]].\n\n==Name==\nTwo alternative etymologies have been proposed for the toponym ''Gusinje''. One links it to Slavic ''guska'' ([[goose]]), the other to an Illyrian word ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of the town, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/><ref name=\"Loma70\">{{harvnb|Loma|2013|p=70}}</ref> In archival records, it has been recorded variably as ''Gousino'' (\u0413\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e), ''Gustigne'' (1614) in Venetian archives, ''Gusna'' (\u06af\u0648\u0633\u0646) and ''Gusinye'' in Ottoman Turkish.<ref name=\"Loma70\"/><ref name=\"Elsie151\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Gusinje Municipality}}\nThe town is located in the Plav-Gusinje area, part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range at an elevation of ca. 1,014 m. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro about 10km south of Gusinje in the National Park \"Prokletije\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Gusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center. The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. Gusinje is the seat of the municipality of the same name. From 1953 to 2011, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2011, it became again a distinct municipality. The town's boundaries form ~3.73 km\u00b2 of the total 157 km\u00b2 of the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}} Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding.\n\n==History==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania. Relatively to other neighbouring regions, the Plav-Gusinje area in general was densely populated at the end of the 15th century with 15 villages and over a thousand households in total.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan, the beys and the local [[sipahi]]s that were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the neighbouring Albanian tribe (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which was in rebellion against the Ottomans and was plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - around which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of all pathways from Kelmendi. Thus, modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from Kelmendi to modern [[Sandzak]]. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref> The fortress was also designed to stop the expansion of the [[Ku\u010di]] tribe in the Upper Lim valley. In time despite initial Ottoman resistance, these two communities Kelmendi and Ku\u010di came to form all the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Their descendants although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam by the middle 18th century. The different mosques of Gusinje today represent the different brotherhoods from Kelmendi or Ku\u010di that built them. For example, the Cekaj mosque (''\u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija''/''xhamia e Cekajve'') was built by the Cekaj brotherhood from Kelmendi in 1687, while the New Mosque built in 1899 is known as ''Radon\u010di\u0107a'' after the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood from Ku\u010di. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]]. In terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. The Vezir's mosque, built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 in the town center is a symbol of the Pashalik's lead in the upper Lim valley. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] it is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eights [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire disintegrated in the long 19th century already in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Gusinje and Plav were awarded to the independent [[Principality of Montenegro]]. Gusinje was developing as a commercial town at the time, but still remained outside properly established rule of Ottoman law. Gun ownership was widespread and Ottoman rule was difficult to enforce.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=61}} The Albanians of Gusinje opposed the decisions of the treaty and sent telegrams of protest to the embassies of the [[Great Powers]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=44}} In the [[Congress of Berlin]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|its final treaty]] those decisions were finalized. The Albanians in the two regions reacted against the final decision in favor annexation and formed the [[League of Prizren]]. \n\nA noted figure of the League of Prizren was [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha Shabanagaj]], a landowner and military commander from Gusinje. In the ensuing [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] the League of Prizren led by Shabanagaj defeated the approaching Montenegrin forces led by [[Marko Miljanov]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} Reports after the battle claim that the victors carried into the town 60 heads from their defeated foes. The annexation was effectively stopped and the Great Powers began another round of negotiations which eventually led to [[Ulcinj]]'s annexation by Montenegro as compensation. The battle became a point of reference in the [[Albanian National Awakening]] and set a precedent about the need of armed struggle to defend other areas.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=74}} Although the battle took place near Nov\u0161i\u0107e which is ~4km to the north of Plav, in the Ottoman press of the time it became known as ''Gusinye hadisesi'' (Gusinye Incident) because of its crucial role in the struggle. In 1893, Gusinje had 1,600 households, 5 mosques and 240 shops.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nThe districts were part of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] until 1913. In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Gusinje became a subject of dispute between newly independent Albania and Montenegro. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] in the [[London Conference of 1912\u201313|London Peace Conference]] asked for the region of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] as otherwise communication between the capital of [[Podgorica]] and the new eastern provinces of Montenegro would be blocked. As Kelmendi finally became part of Albania, Gusinje was given to Montenegro with the provision that the people of Kelmendi would have free passage to the town.{{sfn|Cornwall|1987|pp=6-12}} About 2000 Albanian refugees from Gusinje and Plav were reported in Shkodra in 1913 by the director of the Red Cross which was stationed in the city. The beginning of WWI in practice stopped the implementation of any agreement. In 1919, the decision was reaffirmed but the border was closed. In Albania, the closing of the border between [[Mal\u00ebsia]] and Gusinje has been seen as a main cause for the interwar impoverishment of areas like Kelmendi and [[Shala]], which were deprived from access to their traditional market town.{{sfn|Galaty|2013|p=56}}\n\nThe entry of the Montenegrin army in 1913 and the Yugoslav army after 1919 in Gusinje was accompanied by repressive policies against the local population. In 1919, Ro\u017eaje was one of the centres of the [[Plav rebellion]] (''Plavska pobuna'') that fought against the inclusion of [[Sandzak]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=56}} About 450 Muslim locals were killed in Gusinje and nearby Plav after the uprising was quelled.{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=21}} These events remain a matter of dispute in modern Montenegrin politics. In 2013, the President of Montenegro [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] made the first direct acknowledgment of the events in a ceremony in [[Berane]] where he declared that ''the crimes performed in Plav and Gusinje are the dark side of the Montenegrin history''.{{sfn|Pacariz|2013|p=437}}\n\nGusinje became part of Albania in WWII by the Italian and then the Nazi German army to win the support of the local population. After the war, the 1913 borders were reaffirmed. Gusinje's status as a distinct municipality was revoked in 1953. Along with other reasons it fueled immigration and impoverishment in the town.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=17}}\n\n==Demographics==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports that 18,400 people trace theirs origins to the town of Gusinje out of a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is almost entirely Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}}\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Ethnic groups (2011 census)\n|-\n!width=\"100px\"|Ethnic group\n!width=\"80px\"|Number\n!width=\"80px\"|Percentage\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks in Montenegro|Bosniaks]] || 1,098 || 65.63%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 294 || 17.57%\n|-\n| [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]] || 182 || 10.88%\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 46 || 2.75%\n|-\n| [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]] || 28 || 1.67%\n|-\n| Other/undeclared || 25 || 1.49%\n|-\n| '''Total''' || '''1,673'''|| '''100%'''\n|}\n\n{{Col-2}}\n{{historical populations|align=non\n|1948 | 2,402\n|1953 | 2,555\n|1961 | 2,756\n|1971 | 2,695\n|1981 | 2,625\n|1991 | 2,472\n|2003 | 1,704\n|2011 | 1,673\n}}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- ONLY ADD A PERSON TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA -->\n* [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje]], Ottoman governor \n* [[D\u017eenan Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin footballer\n* [[Fahrudin Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin businessman, founder of [[Dnevni Avaz]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* [[Ramo Kolenovi\u0107]], kayaker\n* [[Dino Radon\u010di\u0107]], basketball player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Cornwall |first1=Mark |title=Between two wars.

{{IPA-sh|\u0261\u01d4si\u0272e|pron}}, {{lang-sq|Gucia}})  is a small [[town]] in north-eastern [[Montenegro]]. According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 1,673 and is the administrative center of [[Gusinje Municipality]].\n\n==Name==\nTwo alternative etymologies have been proposed for the toponym ''Gusinje''. One links it to Slavic ''guska'' ([[goose]]), the other to an Illyrian word ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of the town, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/><ref name=\"Loma70\">{{harvnb|Loma|2013|p=70}}</ref> In archival records, it has been recorded variably as ''Gousino'' (\u0413\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e), ''Gustigne'' (1614) in Venetian archives, ''Gusna'' (\u06af\u0648\u0633\u0646) and ''Gusinye'' in Ottoman Turkish.<ref name=\"Loma70\"/><ref name=\"Elsie151\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Gusinje Municipality}}\nThe town is located in the Plav-Gusinje area, part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range at an elevation of ca. 1,014 m. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro about 10km south of Gusinje in the National Park \"Prokletije\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Gusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center. The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. Gusinje is the seat of the municipality of the same name. From 1953 to 2011, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2011, it became again a distinct municipality. The town's boundaries form ~3.73 km\u00b2 of the total 157 km\u00b2 of the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}} Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding.\n\n==History==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania. Relatively to other neighbouring regions, the Plav-Gusinje area in general was densely populated at the end of the 15th century with 15 villages and over a thousand households in total.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan, the beys and the local [[sipahi]]s that were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the neighbouring Albanian tribe (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which was in rebellion against the Ottomans and was plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - around which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of all pathways from Kelmendi. Thus, modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from Kelmendi to modern [[Sandzak]]. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref> The fortress was also designed to stop the expansion of the [[Ku\u010di]] tribe in the Upper Lim valley. In time despite initial Ottoman resistance, these two communities Kelmendi and Ku\u010di came to form all the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Their descendants although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam by the middle 18th century. The different mosques of Gusinje today represent the different brotherhoods from Kelmendi or Ku\u010di that built them. For example, the Cekaj mosque (''\u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija''/''xhamia e Cekajve'') was built by the Cekaj brotherhood from Kelmendi in 1687, while the New Mosque built in 1899 is known as ''Radon\u010di\u0107a'' after the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood from Ku\u010di. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]]. In terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. The Vezir's mosque, built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 in the town center is a symbol of the Pashalik's lead in the upper Lim valley. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] it is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eights [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire disintegrated in the long 19th century already in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Gusinje and Plav were awarded to the independent [[Principality of Montenegro]]. Gusinje was developing as a commercial town at the time, but still remained outside properly established rule of Ottoman law. Gun ownership was widespread and Ottoman rule was difficult to enforce.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=61}} The Albanians of Gusinje opposed the decisions of the treaty and sent telegrams of protest to the embassies of the [[Great Powers]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=44}} In the [[Congress of Berlin]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|its final treaty]] those decisions were finalized. The Albanians in the two regions reacted against the final decision in favor annexation and formed the [[League of Prizren]]. \n\nA noted figure of the League of Prizren was [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha Shabanagaj]], a landowner and military commander from Gusinje. In the ensuing [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] the League of Prizren led by Shabanagaj defeated the approaching Montenegrin forces led by [[Marko Miljanov]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} Reports after the battle claim that the victors carried into the town 60 heads from their defeated foes. The annexation was effectively stopped and the Great Powers began another round of negotiations which eventually led to [[Ulcinj]]'s annexation by Montenegro as compensation. The battle became a point of reference in the [[Albanian National Awakening]] and set a precedent about the need of armed struggle to defend other areas.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=74}} Although the battle took place near Nov\u0161i\u0107e which is ~4km to the north of Plav, in the Ottoman press of the time it became known as ''Gusinye hadisesi'' (Gusinye Incident) because of its crucial role in the struggle. In 1893, Gusinje had 1,600 households, 5 mosques and 240 shops.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nThe districts were part of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] until 1913. In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Gusinje became a subject of dispute between newly independent Albania and Montenegro. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] in the [[London Conference of 1912\u201313|London Peace Conference]] asked for the region of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] as otherwise communication between the capital of [[Podgorica]] and the new eastern provinces of Montenegro would be blocked. As Kelmendi finally became part of Albania, Gusinje was given to Montenegro with the provision that the people of Kelmendi would have free passage to the town.{{sfn|Cornwall|1987|pp=6-12}} About 2000 Albanian refugees from Gusinje and Plav were reported in Shkodra in 1913 by the director of the Red Cross which was stationed in the city. The beginning of WWI in practice stopped the implementation of any agreement. In 1919, the decision was reaffirmed but the border was closed. In Albania, the closing of the border between [[Mal\u00ebsia]] and Gusinje has been seen as a main cause for the interwar impoverishment of areas like Kelmendi and [[Shala]], which were deprived from access to their traditional market town.{{sfn|Galaty|2013|p=56}}\n\nThe entry of the Montenegrin army in 1913 and the Yugoslav army after 1919 in Gusinje was accompanied by repressive policies against the local population. In 1919, Ro\u017eaje was one of the centres of the [[Plav rebellion]] (''Plavska pobuna'') that fought against the inclusion of [[Sandzak]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=56}} About 450 Muslim locals were killed in Gusinje and nearby Plav after the uprising was quelled.{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=21}} These events remain a matter of dispute in modern Montenegrin politics. In 2013, the President of Montenegro [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] made the first direct acknowledgment of the events in a ceremony in [[Berane]] where he declared that ''the crimes performed in Plav and Gusinje are the dark side of the Montenegrin history''.{{sfn|Pacariz|2013|p=437}}\n\nGusinje became part of Albania in WWII by the Italian and then the Nazi German army to win the support of the local population. After the war, the 1913 borders were reaffirmed. Gusinje's status as a distinct municipality was revoked in 1953. Along with other reasons it fueled immigration and impoverishment in the town.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=17}}\n\n==Demographics==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports that 18,400 people come from the town of Gusinje out of a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is almost entirely Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}}\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Ethnic groups (2011 census)\n|-\n!width=\"100px\"|Ethnic group\n!width=\"80px\"|Number\n!width=\"80px\"|Percentage\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks in Montenegro|Bosniaks]] || 1,098 || 65.63%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 294 || 17.57%\n|-\n| [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]] || 182 || 10.88%\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 46 || 2.75%\n|-\n| [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]] || 28 || 1.67%\n|-\n| Other/undeclared || 25 || 1.49%\n|-\n| '''Total''' || '''1,673'''|| '''100%'''\n|}\n\n{{Col-2}}\n{{historical populations|align=non\n|1948 | 2,402\n|1953 | 2,555\n|1961 | 2,756\n|1971 | 2,695\n|1981 | 2,625\n|1991 | 2,472\n|2003 | 1,704\n|2011 | 1,673\n}}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- ONLY ADD A PERSON TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA -->\n* [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje]], Ottoman governor \n* [[D\u017eenan Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin footballer\n* [[Fahrudin Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin businessman, founder of [[Dnevni Avaz]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* [[Ramo Kolenovi\u0107]], kayaker\n* [[Dino Radon\u010di\u0107]], basketball player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Cornwall |first1=Mark |title=Between two wars.

Traditionally, the Horus name of the king was written within a [[serekh]]: the image of the facade of the royal palace beneath a falcon representing the god Horus (see [[Hieroglyphics]]). Instead, Peribsen chose to have the [[Set animal]], representing Seth, on his serekh.

Seal impressions from tombs of this era reveal great changes in the titles held by high officials, pointing to a reduction of their power. Further seal impressions show that several deities were worshipped under Peribsen, refuting the monotheism theory. Other contemporary inscriptions indicate that [[Egyptian language|Egyptian grammar]] was perfected during his time: In particular, the earliest seal impressions with complete sentences date back to Peribsen's reign. Thus, Peribsen's reign was in fact a time of cultural and religious advancement.<ref name=\"HTV\">Herman te Velde: ''Seth, God of Confusion.

Peribsen's actions were thought to be similar to those of the much later [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] pharaoh  [[Akhenaten]], who had required Egyptians to serve only the [[Aten]]. Newberry proposed that the priests of Horus and Seth fought each other \"in the manner of a [[War of the Roses]]\" during the second half of the Second Dynasty.<ref name=PEN/>\n\nThe \"heretic Peribsen\" theory was based on three observations: that the name \"Peribsen\" was excluded from later king lists, that the king's tomb had been destroyed and plundered during antiquity and, finally, that the tomb stelae of Peribsen, that once displayed the Set animal, were badly scratched with the clear intention of effacing the Seth image. Egyptologists hypothesized these were the actions of religious opponents to the Sethian priest-caste.<ref name=JLC/><ref name=PEN>P.E. Newberry: ''The Seth rebellion of the 2nd Dynasty'', in: ''Ancient Egypt.'', no. 7, 1922, page&nbsp;40\u201346.</ref> Lauer and Firth relied on the \"heretic Peribsen\" theory to explain the enormous quantity of stone vessels inscribed with the name of First and Second Dynasty kings found beneath [[Pyramid of Djoser|Djoser's pyramid]] in bags bearing seals of [[Khasekhemwy]] and [[Djoser]]. They proposed that Peribsen had plundered the tombs of his predecessors, followers of Horus, and scattered their funerary equipment. These vessels were gathered in the royal treasury during Khasekhemwy's reign following his reunification of Egypt, and finally put beneath the Step Pyramid by Djoser, in an act of pious devotion.<ref>Phillipe Flandrin: ''Jean-Phillipe Lauer: Saqqarah, Une vie, Entretiens avec Phillipe Flandrin'', Petite Bibliotheque Payot 107, 1988</ref>\n\n;Contemporary theories\nToday this theory, as well as Lauer and Firth's conclusions, is widely questioned. Archaeological evidence of Peribsen has been found almost entirely in [[Upper Egypt]]. In particular, his name does not appear in [[Lower Egypt]]ian records surviving from that time. It is argued that Peribsen may not have ruled over all of Egypt and therefore did not have the authority to force a change in state religion. Another piece of evidence that argues against the \"heretic Peribsen\" theory is the [[false door]] of the priest [[Shery (Egypt)|Shery]] at Saqqara. Shery held office during the early [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]]. The inscription on the false door connects the name of Peribsen in one sentence with another shadowy king of the Second Dynasty, [[Senedj]]. According to the addendum, Shery was ''\"overseer of all wab-priests of king Peribsen in the [[necropolis]] of king Senedj, in his mortuary temple and at all other places\"''. This implies that the [[funerary cult]] of Peribsen continued at least until the Fourth Dynasty, inconsistent with the assumption that Peribsen's name was not allowed to be mentioned. Additionally, Egyptologists such as [[Herman te Velde]] point out that Shery was not the only Fourth Dynasty priest participating in the [[funerary cult]] of Peribsen. [[Inkef]], possibly a brother or cousin of Shery, also held the title of a \"supervisor of Ka-priests of Peribsen\".<ref name=HTV/>\n\nSeal impressions found in Peribsen's tomb at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] show several deities: [[Ash (god)|Ash]], [[Min (god)|Min]] and [[Bastet]], suggesting they were venerated during Peribsen's time on the throne. This finding argues against Peribsen worshipping a single god, or promoting monotheism.<ref>Auguste Mariette: ''Les mastabas de l'Ancien Empire''.

Peribsen may have been perceived as a living incarnation of both Horus and Seth in equal measure, just like his predecessors on the throne. Therefore, Peribsen's name may actually show no break in the sacred tradition; he added the power of Seth to Horus. As further examples, the titles of early dynastic queens used plural patron deities, such as \"she who is allowed to see Horus and Seth\" and \"she who carries Horus and Seth\".<ref name=HTV/><ref name=JSF/> Similarly, the unusual serekh of king [[Khasekhemwy]], the last ruler of the Second Dynasty, shows the deities Horus and Seth together atop the serekh. Horus wears the White Crown of Upper Egypt and Seth wears the [[Deshret|Red Crown]] of Lower Egypt. The two gods are depicted facing each other in a kissing gesture. This special name was meant to illustrate the dual incarnation of the king as the representative of Horus and Seth, with power over all Egypt.

These are all dated from the reign of [[Nynetjer]] to that of [[Khasekhemwy]], the last ruler of the Second Dynasty. Egyptologists consider the archaeological record of the mastabas' condition and the original architecture as proof that the statewide mortuary cults for kings and noblemen operated successfully during the entire dynasty. If true, their preservation is inconsistent with the theory of civil wars and economic problems during Peribsen's reign. Rice, Tiradritti and Helck think that Nynetjer decided to leave a divided realm because of private or political reasons and that the split was a formality sustained by Second Dynasty kings.<ref name=MIR/><ref name=FraTi/><ref name=WHK/>\n\nThe origin of the political division is unknown. It might have happened at the beginning of Peribsen's rule or shortly before. Because Peribsen chose the deity Seth as his new throne patron, Egyptologists are of the view that Peribsen was a [[chieftain]] from [[Thinis]] or a prince of the Thinite royal house. This theory is based on Seth being a deity of Thinite origin, which would explain Peribsen's choice: his name changing may have been nothing more than smart political (and religious) [[propaganda]].<ref name=WHK>W.

Nynetjer decided to split Egypt to leave it to two chosen successors who would rule two separate kingdoms, in the hope that the state administration could improve. Archaeological evidence, such as the imprinted clay seals and inscribed jars, appear to support the claim that Peribsen ruled only in Upper Egypt. A great number of these were found in Abydos, Naqada and at Elephantine, with only a single clay seal bearing his name found in Lower Egypt, at Beit Khallaf.

From the twelfth year event onward, \"The king of Upper- and Lower Egypt appears\" was amended to \"The king of Lower Egypt appears\".

To better address the problem of feeding the Egyptian population, Nynetjer split the realm into two and his successors founded two independent realms, perhaps with intent to reunite after the famine.

Bell overlooked that the heights of the Nile floods in the Palermo stone inscription take into account the measurements of the [[nilometer]]s around [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], but not elsewhere along the river. A state-wide drought was unlikely.<ref>Stephan Seidlmayer: ''Historische und moderne Nilst\u00e4nde: Historische und moderne Nilst\u00e4nde: Untersuchungen zu den Pegelablesungen des Nils von der Fr\u00fchzeit bis in die Gegenwart''.

On the stone the kings from 1st to 7th dynasty are listed by their Horus name, their gold name and their cartouche name, their name banderoles end with the name of their royal mother. The lists also contain rectangular windows presenting year events from the day of king's coronation up to his death. The most famous fragments of the Annal stone are called ''[[Palermo Stone]]'' and ''Cairo Stone''. On the Cairo stone, in line IV, the nine last years of king Nynetjer are preserved (but most of the year windows are illegible now).<ref name=TWR/> The date of Nynetjer's death is followed by a new king. Recent investigations reveal that the serekh of that new king is surmounted by a four-legged animal, not by the Horus-falcon. Since the only four-legged [[heraldry|heraldic]] serekh animal in early Egypt was the chimera of the god Seth, despite passionate disagreement, the indicated ruler is likely to be Peribsen. Egyptologists such as TeVelde, Barta and Edwards do not agree; Peribsen might have not been the only king with a Seth-name. The year events under Nynetjer show increasing references to Seth, suggesting the tradition of a Horus name as the sole name of kings might have already evolved. The rise of a king allied with Seth was thus unsurprising. TeVelde, Barta and Edwards think that, in addition to Peribsen, the rulers ''Wadjenes'', ''Nubnefer'' or ''Sened'' might have been Seth-kings as well; one of them surely was the true direct successor of Nynetjer. The comparatively large amount of archaeological finds from Peribsen's reign contradict the brief estimated length of rulership, only 10 to 12 years, as presented on the Annal stone.<ref name=TWR/>\n\nThe Annal stone gives absolutely no indication of a division of the Egyptian realm. Barta, TeVelde, Wilkinson and Edwards argue that the theory of state division is untenable. An administrative reorganization or split in the priesthood sects is more likely.<ref name=TWR/>\n\n=== Political accomplishments ===\nDuring his time on the throne, Peribsen founded an administrative center called \"The white house of treasury\" as well as a new royal residence, called the \"protection of Nubt\", located near [[Ombos]] (\"Nubt\" being the Ancient Egyptian name of [[Naqada]]).<ref>Jean-Pierre P\u00e4tznik: Die Siegelabrollungen und Rollsiegel der Stadt Elephantine im 3.

For example, titles like \"sealer of the king\" were changed into \"sealer of the king of Upper Egypt\". This bureaucratic reform may indicate an attempt by Peribsen to limit the power of these officials, further evidence for a bloated and unwieldy state administration under Nynetjer.<ref name=CES/>\n\nThe administration system under Peribsen and Sekhemib had a clear and well-defined hierarchy; as an example, from highest to the lowest rank: Treasury house (royal and therefore highest in ranking) \u2192 pension office \u2192 property \u2192 vineyards \u2192 private vineyard (property of citizens and therefore lowest in ranking). King Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the Second dynasty, was able to re-unify the state administration of Egypt and therefore unite the whole of Ancient Egypt. He brought the two treasury houses of Egypt under the control of the \"House of the King\", bringing them into a new, single administration centre.<ref name=CES>Christian E.

Numerous clay seal impressions and jar inscriptions mention the gods [[Ash (god)|Ash]], Horus, [[Nekhbet]], Min, Bastet and [[Kherty]]. The depictions of the deities are followed by the name of the place or town where they had their principal cult center. On the Cairo stone, a statue of Ash and a fetish of Seth are credited to Peribsen, complementing the clay seal impressions. Curiously, several seal impressions show a sun disc over the Seth chimera atop the royal serekh: the ancient symbol for the god [[Ra]].  There is no archaeologic proof that the sun god Ra was part of the Egyptian pantheon at this early date; the appearance of the disc may be the first evidence of the evolving sun cult and [[theism|theistic]] change. The sun disc appears in connection to one of the state patrons (for example, under Peribsen's predecessor [[Raneb]] the sun was connected to Horus); under Peribsen it was connected to Seth. Under king Khasekhemwy the sun finally received its own name (''ra'') and, at the time of throne change between Khasekhemwy and his follower Djoser, several priests and officials also connected their name to Ra.<ref>Jochem Kahl: ''\u00bbRa is my Lord\u00ab: Searching for the Rise of the Sun God at the Dawn of Egyptian History''.

The investigation into the rulers of Lower Egypt is ongoing. The Rammesside king lists differ in their order of royal names from king Senedj onward. The royal table of Sakkara and the royal canon of Turin reflect Memphite traditions, which only allowed Memphite rulers to be mentioned. The Abydos king list reflects instead the Thinite traditions and therefore only Thinite rulers appear on that list. Until king Senedj, all the king lists are in agreement. After him, the Sakkara list and the Turin list mention three kings as successors: [[Neferkara I]], [[Neferkasokar]] and [[Hudjefa I]]. The Abydos king list jumps forward to Khasekhemwy, calling him \"Djadjay\". The discrepancies are considered by Egyptologists to be the result of the division of Egypt during the Second dynasty.<ref name=HAS/><ref name=FraTi/><ref name=NGL>Nicolas Grimal: ''A History of Ancient Egypt''.

Cairo 1959; obj.104</ref>]]\n\nAdditional contradictory findings are the Horus and Nebty names of kings discovered in the Great Southern Gallery in the necropolis of the ([[Third Dynasty of Egypt|Third dynasty]]) king [[Djoser]] at Sakkara. Stone vessel inscriptions mention the kings [[Nubnefer]], [[Weneg (pharaoh)|Weneg-Nebty]], [[Ba (Pharaoh)|Horus Ba]], [[Horus Bird|Horus \"Bird\"]] and [[Horus Sa|Za]]; each of these  is mentioned only a few times, suggesting their reigns were short. King Sneferka might be identical with king [[Qa'a]] or an ephemeral successor of his. King Weneg-Nebty might be identical with the Ramesside cartouche name [[Wadjenes]]. But kings such as \"Nubnefer\", \"Bird\" and \"Za\" remain a mystery. They never appear anywhere else and the number of objects surviving from their lifetimes is very limited. Schl\u00f6gl, Helck and Peter Kaplony postulate, that Nubnefer, Za and Bird were contemporaries of Peribsen and Sekhemib and ruled over Lower Egypt, whilst the latter two ruled Upper Egypt.<ref name=HAS/><ref name=FraTi/><ref name=NGL/><ref name=ToWi/><ref>Peter Kaplony: ''A building named \"Menti-Ankh\".

The design model was the tomb of king [[Djer]] (third pharaoh of the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First dynasty]]), thought to be the 'Tomb of Osiris' from the Middle Kingdom. The architecture of Peribsen's tomb is similar to the residential palace. The tomb measures {{convert|16|m|ft}} x {{convert|13|m|ft}} and comprises three independent structures nested into one another: in the center is the main burial chamber, measuring {{convert|7.3|m|ft}} x {{convert|2.9|m|ft}}, and which is  made of mud bricks, reeds, and wood. On the north, east and west sides the burial chamber is surrounded by nine small storage rooms leading into one another; on the south face is a long antechamber. A passageway runs between the inner structures and the outer wall.<ref name=WMF/><ref name=LaBe/><ref name=LBK/>\n\nExcavations under the supervision of the [[German Archaeological Institute|Deutsches Arch\u00e4ologisches Institut Kairo]] (DAIK) in 2001 and 2004 revealed that the tomb had been erected and completed in a great hurry. The building works took place in a single phase; the walls were plastered roughly; and the monument had collapsed several times over the centuries. During the Middle Kingdom, Peribsen's tomb was restored at least twice together with the tomb of [[Djer]], which was thought to be that of Osiris.<ref name=LaBe>Laurel Bestock: ''The Early Dynastic Funerary Enclosures of Abydos.''

Beads and bracelets made of fayence and [[carnelian]] and tools made of copper were excavated. Special findings include a silver needle engraved with the name of king [[Hor Aha]] and clay seal fragments with the name of king Sekhemib.

Clay seals with Peribsen's serekh name on them were located near the eastern entrance and inside a destroyed offering shrine. The findings support the view that the building was part of Peribsen's burial site. The funerary enclosure is commonly known as \"Middle Fort\". This was first discovered in 1904 under the supervision of [[Canada|Canadian]] archaeologist [[Charles Trick Currelly]] and [[England|British]] Egyptologist [[Edward Russell Ayrton]]. The enclosure wall was located on the north-west side of Khasekhemwy's funerary enclosure \"[[Shunet ez Zebib]]\" (\"raisin barn\"). Peribsen's measures {{convert|108|m|ft}} x {{convert|55|m|ft}} and housed only a few cult buildings. The enclosure has three entrances: one to the east, one to the south and one to the north. A small shrine, measuring {{convert|12.3|m|ft}} x {{convert|9.75|m|ft}} was located at the south-east corner of the funerary enclosure. It once comprised three small [[chapel]]s.

Traditionally, the Horus name of the king was written within a [[serekh]]: the image of the facade of the royal palace beneath a falcon representing the god Horus (see [[Hieroglyphics]]). Instead, Peribsen chose to have the [[Set animal]], representing Seth, on his serekh.

Seal impressions from tombs of this era reveal great changes in the titles held by high officials, pointing to a reduction of their power. Further seal impressions show that several deities were worshipped under Peribsen, refuting the monotheism theory. Other contemporary inscriptions indicate that [[Egyptian language|Egyptian grammar]] was perfected during his time: In particular, the earliest seal impressions with complete sentences date back to Peribsen's reign. Thus, Peribsen's reign was in fact a time of cultural and religious advancement.<ref name=\"HTV\">Herman te Velde: ''Seth, God of Confusion.

Peribsen's actions were thought to be similar to those of the much later [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] pharaoh  [[Akhenaten]], who had required Egyptians to serve only the [[Aten]]. Newberry proposed that the priests of Horus and Seth fought each other \"in the manner of a [[War of the Roses]]\" during the second half of the Second Dynasty.<ref name=PEN/>\n\nThe \"heretic Peribsen\" theory was based on three observations: that the name \"Peribsen\" was excluded from later king lists, that the king's tomb had been destroyed and plundered during antiquity and, finally, that the tomb stelae of Peribsen, that once displayed the Set animal, were badly scratched with the clear intention of effacing the Seth image. Egyptologists hypothesized these were the actions of religious opponents to the Sethian priest-caste.<ref name=JLC/><ref name=PEN>P.E. Newberry: ''The Seth rebellion of the 2nd Dynasty'', in: ''Ancient Egypt.'', no. 7, 1922, page&nbsp;40\u201346.</ref> Lauer and Firth relied on the \"heretic Peribsen\" theory to explain the enormous quantity of stone vessels inscribed with the name of First and Second Dynasty kings found beneath [[Pyramid of Djoser|Djoser's pyramid]] in bags bearing seals of [[Khasekhemwy]] and [[Djoser]]. They proposed that Peribsen had plundered the tombs of his predecessors, followers of Horus, and scattered their funerary equipment. These vessels were gathered in the royal treasury during Khasekhemwy's reign following his reunification of Egypt, and finally put beneath the Step Pyramid by Djoser, in an act of pious devotion.<ref>Phillipe Flandrin: ''Jean-Phillipe Lauer: Saqqarah, Une vie, Entretiens avec Phillipe Flandrin'', Petite Bibliotheque Payot 107, 1988</ref>\n\n;Contemporary theories\nToday this theory, as well as Lauer and Firth's conclusions, is widely questioned. Archaeological evidence of Peribsen has been found almost entirely in [[Upper Egypt]]. In particular, his name does not appear in [[Lower Egypt]]ian records surviving from that time. It is argued that Peribsen may not have ruled over all of Egypt and therefore did not have the authority to force a change in state religion. Another piece of evidence that argues against the \"heretic Peribsen\" theory is the [[false door]] of the priest [[Shery (Egypt)|Shery]] at Saqqara. Shery held office during the early [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]]. The inscription on the false door connects the name of Peribsen in one sentence with another shadowy king of the Second Dynasty, [[Senedj]]. According to the addendum, Shery was ''\"overseer of all wab-priests of king Peribsen in the [[necropolis]] of king Senedj, in his mortuary temple and at all other places\"''. This implies that the [[funerary cult]] of Peribsen continued at least until the Fourth Dynasty, inconsistent with the assumption that Peribsen's name was not allowed to be mentioned. Additionally, Egyptologists such as [[Herman te Velde]] point out that Shery was not the only Fourth Dynasty priest participating in the [[funerary cult]] of Peribsen. [[Inkef]], possibly a brother or cousin of Shery, also held the title of a \"supervisor of Ka-priests of Peribsen\".<ref name=HTV/>\n\nSeal impressions found in Peribsen's tomb at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] show several deities: [[Ash (god)|Ash]], [[Min (god)|Min]] and [[Bastet]], suggesting they were venerated during Peribsen's time on the throne. This finding argues against Peribsen worshipping a single god, or promoting monotheism.<ref>Auguste Mariette: ''Les mastabas de l'Ancien Empire''.

Peribsen may have been perceived as a living incarnation of both Horus and Seth in equal measure, just like his predecessors on the throne. Therefore, Peribsen's name may actually show no break in the sacred tradition; he added the power of Seth to Horus. As further examples, the titles of early dynastic queens used plural patron deities, such as \"she who is allowed to see Horus and Seth\" and \"she who carries Horus and Seth\".<ref name=HTV/><ref name=JSF/> Similarly, the unusual serekh of king [[Khasekhemwy]], the last ruler of the Second Dynasty, shows the deities Horus and Seth together atop the serekh. Horus wears the White Crown of Upper Egypt and Seth wears the [[Deshret|Red Crown]] of Lower Egypt. The two gods are depicted facing each other in a kissing gesture. This special name was meant to illustrate the dual incarnation of the king as the representative of Horus and Seth, with power over all Egypt. Khasekhemwy's name can be interpreted as an advanced form of Peribsen's serekh name.<ref name=HTV/><ref name=JSF/>\n\nEgyptologists [[Ludwig David Morenz]] and [[Wolfgang Helck]]<ref>Wolfgang Helck: ''Untersuchungen zur Thinitenzeit'' (= ''\u00c4gyptologische Abhandlungen'', Vol. 45).

Egyptologists such as [[Michael Rice (Egyptologist)|Michael Rice]],<ref name=MIR>Michael Rice: ''Who's Who in Ancient Egypt''.

These are all dated from the reign of [[Nynetjer]] to that of [[Khasekhemwy]], the last ruler of the Second Dynasty. Egyptologists consider the archaeological record of the mastabas' condition and the original architecture as proof that the statewide mortuary cults for kings and noblemen operated successfully during the entire dynasty. If true, their preservation is inconsistent with the theory of civil wars and economic problems during Peribsen's reign. Rice, Tiradritti and Helck think that Nynetjer decided to leave a divided realm because of private or political reasons and that the split was a formality sustained by Second Dynasty kings.<ref name=MIR/><ref name=FraTi/><ref name=WHK/>\n\nThe origin of the political division is unknown. It might have happened at the beginning of Peribsen's rule or shortly before. Because Peribsen chose the deity Seth as his new throne patron, Egyptologists are of the view that Peribsen was a [[chieftain]] from [[Thinis]] or a prince of the Thinite royal house. This theory is based on Seth being a deity of Thinite origin, which would explain Peribsen's choice: his name changing may have been nothing more than smart political (and religious) [[propaganda]].<ref name=WHK>W.

Nynetjer decided to split Egypt to leave it to two chosen successors who would rule two separate kingdoms, in the hope that the state administration could improve. Archaeological evidence, such as the imprinted clay seals and inscribed jars, appear to support the claim that Peribsen ruled only in Upper Egypt. A great number of these were found in Abydos, Naqada and at Elephantine, with only a single clay seal bearing his name found in Lower Egypt, at Beit Khallaf.

The rest of Egypt would therefore have been controlled by a different, coexisting ruler.<ref name=FraTi/><ref name=NGL/>\n\nEgyptologist Dimitri B.

From the twelfth year event onward, \"The king of Upper- and Lower Egypt appears\" was amended to \"The king of Lower Egypt appears\".

On the stone the kings from 1st to 7th dynasty are listed by their Horus name, their gold name and their cartouche name, their name banderoles end with the name of their royal mother. The lists also contain rectangular windows presenting year events from the day of king's coronation up to his death. The most famous fragments of the Annal stone are called ''[[Palermo Stone]]'' and ''Cairo Stone''. On the Cairo stone, in line IV, the nine last years of king Nynetjer are preserved (but most of the year windows are illegible now).<ref name=TWR/> The date of Nynetjer's death is followed by a new king. Recent investigations reveal that the serekh of that new king is surmounted by a four-legged animal, not by the Horus-falcon. Since the only four-legged [[heraldry|heraldic]] serekh animal in early Egypt was the chimera of the god Seth, despite passionate disagreement, the indicated ruler is likely to be Peribsen. Egyptologists such as TeVelde, Barta and Edwards do not agree; Peribsen might have not been the only king with a Seth-name. The year events under Nynetjer show increasing references to Seth, suggesting the tradition of a Horus name as the sole name of kings might have already evolved. The rise of a king allied with Seth was thus unsurprising. TeVelde, Barta and Edwards think that, in addition to Peribsen, the rulers ''Wadjenes'', ''Nubnefer'' or ''Sened'' might have been Seth-kings as well; one of them surely was the true direct successor of Nynetjer. The comparatively large amount of archaeological finds from Peribsen's reign contradict the brief estimated length of rulership, only 10 to 12 years, as presented on the Annal stone.<ref name=TWR/>\n\nThe Annal stone gives absolutely no indication of a division of the Egyptian realm. Barta, TeVelde, Wilkinson and Edwards argue that the theory of state division is untenable. An administrative reorganization or split in the priesthood sects is more likely.<ref name=TWR/>\n\n=== Political accomplishments ===\nDuring his time on the throne, Peribsen founded an administrative center called \"The white house of treasury\" as well as a new royal residence, called the \"protection of Nubt\", located near [[Ombos]] (\"Nubt\" being the Ancient Egyptian name of [[Naqada]]).<ref>Jean-Pierre P\u00e4tznik: Die Siegelabrollungen und Rollsiegel der Stadt Elephantine im 3.

For example, titles like \"sealer of the king\" were changed into \"sealer of the king of Upper Egypt\". This bureaucratic reform may indicate an attempt by Peribsen to limit the power of these officials, further evidence for a bloated and unwieldy state administration under Nynetjer.<ref name=CES/>\n\nThe administration system under Peribsen and Sekhemib had a clear and well-defined hierarchy; as an example, from highest to the lowest rank: Treasury house (royal and therefore highest in ranking) \u2192 pension office \u2192 property \u2192 vineyards \u2192 private vineyard (property of citizens and therefore lowest in ranking). King Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the Second dynasty, was able to re-unify the state administration of Egypt and therefore unite the whole of Ancient Egypt. He brought the two treasury houses of Egypt under the control of the \"House of the King\", bringing them into a new, single administration centre.<ref name=CES>Christian E.

Numerous clay seal impressions and jar inscriptions mention the gods [[Ash (god)|Ash]], Horus, [[Nekhbet]], Min, Bastet and [[Kherty]]. The depictions of the deities are followed by the name of the place or town where they had their principal cult center. On the Cairo stone, a statue of Ash and a fetish of Seth are credited to Peribsen, complementing the clay seal impressions. Curiously, several seal impressions show a sun disc over the Seth chimera atop the royal serekh: the ancient symbol for the god [[Ra]].  There is no archaeologic proof that the sun god Ra was part of the Egyptian pantheon at this early date; the appearance of the disc may be the first evidence of the evolving sun cult and [[theism|theistic]] change. The sun disc appears in connection to one of the state patrons (for example, under Peribsen's predecessor [[Raneb]] the sun was connected to Horus); under Peribsen it was connected to Seth. Under king Khasekhemwy the sun finally received its own name (''ra'') and, at the time of throne change between Khasekhemwy and his follower Djoser, several priests and officials also connected their name to Ra.<ref>Jochem Kahl: ''\u00bbRa is my Lord\u00ab: Searching for the Rise of the Sun God at the Dawn of Egyptian History''.

The investigation into the rulers of Lower Egypt is ongoing. The Rammesside king lists differ in their order of royal names from king Senedj onward. The royal table of Sakkara and the royal canon of Turin reflect Memphite traditions, which only allowed Memphite rulers to be mentioned. The Abydos king list reflects instead the Thinite traditions and therefore only Thinite rulers appear on that list. Until king Senedj, all the king lists are in agreement. After him, the Sakkara list and the Turin list mention three kings as successors: [[Neferkara I]], [[Neferkasokar]] and [[Hudjefa I]]. The Abydos king list jumps forward to Khasekhemwy, calling him \"Djadjay\". The discrepancies are considered by Egyptologists to be the result of the division of Egypt during the Second dynasty.<ref name=HAS/><ref name=FraTi/><ref name=NGL>Nicolas Grimal: ''A History of Ancient Egypt''.

Cairo 1959; obj.104</ref>]]\n\nAdditional contradictory findings are the Horus and Nebty names of kings discovered in the Great Southern Gallery in the necropolis of the ([[Third Dynasty of Egypt|Third dynasty]]) king [[Djoser]] at Sakkara. Stone vessel inscriptions mention the kings [[Nubnefer]], [[Weneg (pharaoh)|Weneg-Nebty]], [[Ba (Pharaoh)|Horus Ba]], [[Horus Bird|Horus \"Bird\"]] and [[Horus Sa|Za]]; each of these  is mentioned only a few times, suggesting their reigns were short. King Sneferka might be identical with king [[Qa'a]] or an ephemeral successor of his. King Weneg-Nebty might be identical with the Ramesside cartouche name [[Wadjenes]]. But kings such as \"Nubnefer\", \"Bird\" and \"Za\" remain a mystery. They never appear anywhere else and the number of objects surviving from their lifetimes is very limited. Schl\u00f6gl, Helck and Peter Kaplony postulate, that Nubnefer, Za and Bird were contemporaries of Peribsen and Sekhemib and ruled over Lower Egypt, whilst the latter two ruled Upper Egypt.<ref name=HAS/><ref name=FraTi/><ref name=NGL/><ref name=ToWi/><ref>Peter Kaplony: ''A building named \"Menti-Ankh\".

The first [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] of the tomb started in 1898 under the supervision of French archaeologist and Egyptologist [[\u00c9mile Am\u00e9lineau]].<ref>\u00c9mile Am\u00e9lineau: ''Mission Am\u00e9lineau.

The design model was the tomb of king [[Djer]] (third pharaoh of the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First dynasty]]), thought to be the 'Tomb of Osiris' from the Middle Kingdom. The architecture of Peribsen's tomb is similar to the residential palace. The tomb measures {{convert|16|m|ft}} x {{convert|13|m|ft}} and comprises three independent structures nested into one another: in the center is the main burial chamber, measuring {{convert|7.3|m|ft}} x {{convert|2.9|m|ft}}, and which is  made of mud bricks, reeds, and wood. On the north, east and west sides the burial chamber is surrounded by nine small storage rooms leading into one another; on the south face is a long antechamber. A passageway runs between the inner structures and the outer wall.<ref name=WMF/><ref name=LaBe/><ref name=LBK/>\n\nExcavations under the supervision of the [[German Archaeological Institute|Deutsches Arch\u00e4ologisches Institut Kairo]] (DAIK) in 2001 and 2004 revealed that the tomb had been erected and completed in a great hurry. The building works took place in a single phase; the walls were plastered roughly; and the monument had collapsed several times over the centuries. During the Middle Kingdom, Peribsen's tomb was restored at least twice together with the tomb of [[Djer]], which was thought to be that of Osiris.<ref name=LaBe>Laurel Bestock: ''The Early Dynastic Funerary Enclosures of Abydos.''

Some of the stone vessels had copper-coated rims and are similar to the better known finds from tomb of [[Khasekhemwy]]. Vessels from preceding rulers such as Nynetjer and [[Raneb]] were also found. Beads and bracelets made of fayence and [[carnelian]] and tools made of copper were excavated. Special findings include a silver needle engraved with the name of king [[Hor Aha]] and clay seal fragments with the name of king Sekhemib.

Clay seals with Peribsen's serekh name on them were located near the eastern entrance and inside a destroyed offering shrine. The findings support the view that the building was part of Peribsen's burial site. The funerary enclosure is commonly known as \"Middle Fort\". This was first discovered in 1904 under the supervision of [[Canada|Canadian]] archaeologist [[Charles Trick Currelly]] and [[England|British]] Egyptologist [[Edward Russell Ayrton]]. The enclosure wall was located on the north-west side of Khasekhemwy's funerary enclosure \"[[Shunet ez Zebib]]\" (\"raisin barn\"). Peribsen's measures {{convert|108|m|ft}} x {{convert|55|m|ft}} and housed only a few cult buildings. The enclosure has three entrances: one to the east, one to the south and one to the north. A small shrine, measuring {{convert|12.3|m|ft}} x {{convert|9.75|m|ft}} was located at the south-east corner of the funerary enclosure. It once comprised three small [[chapel]]s.
