The game has multiple modes, with the main three being Grand Battle, Valley Skirmish and Abyssal Clash.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://samurai-gamers.com/arena-of-valor/game-modes-overview/|title=Arena of Valor (AoV) - Game Modes Overview (Abyssal Clash, Hook Wars, etc.)|last=Green|date=2018-02-20|website=SAMURAI GAMERS|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> Players compete in these matches which on average last for around 12 - 18 minutes. Players aim to destroy turrets on the map, in order to destroy the core.\n\nThe overall gameplay of ''Arena of Valor'' highly resembles a game called ''[[League of Legends]]'', a MOBA game developed and published by [[Riot Games]], which is a subsidiary of Tencent.\n\nPlayers control characters, referred to as heroes, and each of these heroes have a unique set of abilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arenaofvalor.com/|title=Arena of Valor|website=Arena of Valor|language=en|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> Heroes start the game at a low level, and can earn level up in various ways. Killing non-player creatures such as minions or monsters, defeating other players, destroying structures, passively through time and through special items that can be purchased through the shop. These actions also increase XP the player has, making them more powerful. The items purchased do not carry over matches, and therefore all players are on equal footing at the start of the match.\n\nMatches give players rewards, such as gold, which can then be used to buy a variety of heroes, or arcana.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/tips-to-earn-gold/|title=Tips to Earn Gold|website=Arena of Valor (AoV) Wiki Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> In addition to this, players can play a 'Ranked' match type, which allows them to attempt to go up in tiers in order to be matched with players who are at their skill level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://samurai-gamers.com/arena-of-valor/ranked-match/|title=Arena of Valor (AoV) - Ranked Match (Game Modes)|last=Green|date=2017-11-18|website=SAMURAI GAMERS|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> Stars are earnt for a victory, and lost when the player loses.\n\nThere are various game modes, with 5v5, also known as Grand Battle or Ranked, being the most popular. Here, players can choose a role to play in, such as marksmen, who do high damage yet have little health, or a tank, which has a lot of health. The team then coordinate in order to destroy the towers, and finally to destroy the enemy base. Players can choose to play in the 'jungle', which allows them to level up quicker and make a large difference to the game. \n\nIn addition to this, Valley Skirmish is a 3v3 game mode, using a much smaller map. In this version of the game, there is only one tower. These games are designed to be much quicker, for the player that does not have time for a longer game, and typically last for 4 - 6 minutes. Abyssal Clash is a game mode where players are randomly selected heroes, and have two towers they must destroy in order to reach the enemy base. Arena of Valor also has a deathmatch mode, however this is not as popular as the other three modes.\n\n=== Hero types ===\nThere are currently 98 heroes in ''Arena of Valor'' as of April 6, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arenaofvalor.com/|title=Arena of Valor Hero List|website=Arena of Valor|language=en|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> ''Arena of Valor'' divides the heroes into numerous categories that each play different roles.  The most notable difference is the type of damage a hero deals - some heroes deal physical damage, which can be countered by the armor stat, whilst other heroes deal mainly magic damage, which is resisted by the magic resistance stat. However, some heroes deal both types of damage, and some heroes deal 'True' damage, which cannot be countered by either the armour or magic resistance stat. All heroes are classified as one of six categories, however some heroes can overlap and go into more than one category. \n\n* Marksman: Also known as \"AD Carry/ADC\", marksmen are ranged heroes that usually deal physical damage. This hero type often deals sustained damage, and therefore are useful in team fights in order to reduce the health of the opponent. In addition to this, they are useful in taking objectives in order to win the game. However, they do not have much health and therefore are very vulnerable. Examples of marksmen are Valhein, Tel'Annas and Yorn.\n* Mage: Mages are sometimes known as \"AP Carry/APC\". These heroes deal lots of magic damage, often in a burst, however have weak defense and low mobility.  Mages are a mix of ranged heroes, which deal high amounts of burst damage from afar, melee heroes, which deal lots of damage from close up, or a mixture of both.  Examples of mages are Lauriel, Tulen and Liliana.\n* Assassin: These are melee range heroes that are designed to deal large amounts of damage quickly, and often do not have much health. This hero type often searches for the enemy's AD/AP Carry and other 'squishy' heroes,as well as being responsible to shut down enemy that is on a killing spree. They have high mobility and burst damage in order to be able to strike at valuable targets on the oppositions team such as the marksman or mage.  Examples of assassins are Zill, Nakroth and Murad.\n* [[Tank (gaming)|Tank]]: Tanks are heroes that have large amounts of HP, and usually built completely defensive to be able to take damage for the team.  As a result, they often deal little damage. However, they often have abilities known as 'crowd control' that allow them to inhibit the movement of the other team. In addition to this, they can use these abilities to prevent the enemy team from attacking high priority targets such as the marksman or mage. Examples of tanks are Xeniel, Thane and Toro.\n* Warrior:  Heroes that blend the attributes of damage dealer and tank, combining moderate survivability with respectable damage. Warriors usually have balanced amount of health,defenses,and attack damage,which is common designation for close-range melee duelist.Thus, they able to survive in a long period of fight and excel in doing continuos sustain damage. Examples of fighters are Omen, Zanis and Zephys.\n* Support: Heroes whose skills aid the rest of the team by providing healing, buffing allies (such as movement speed buffs), debuffing the enemy team (such as stunning), or a combination of the above. Support heroes often are paired with the marksman in the early laning phase of the game where the support doesn't attack minions, but instead focuses on aiding their partner and harassing the enemy heroes. Supports aid the marksman as they are often weaker during the early phase of the game and need support in order to survive. Example of supports are Krizzix, Alice and Annette.\n\nPlayers can purchase items, which make a large impact on the heroes stats and play style. An example of this is Butterfly, where if offensive items are bought, the hero deals lots of damage but has low amount of health and defenses and does not survive for long. If Butterfly buys a mix of offensive and defensive items, the hero can act as a warrior and take damage for the team whilst still dealing some damage. This can be applied to all heroes, allowing tanks to play as supports, or for mages to act as supports.\n\n== History and development ==\n''Arena of Valor'' (formerly ''Strike of Kings'') is an international adaptation of ''[[Wangzhe Rongyao|Honor of Kings]]'' for markets outside mainland China. In 2015, Tencent approached [[Riot Games]] and asked them to turn their popular game ''[[League of Legends]]'' into a mobile title. However, Riot Games declined and claimed that the gameplay of ''League of Legends'' could not be replicated on smartphones. Tencent then proceeded to create their own mobile game, ''[[Wangzhe Rongyao]]'', roughly translated to English as ''Honor of Kings'', and was released in November 26, 2015. Nevertheless, several Riot Games employees deemed that the design of characters and abilities in ''Honor of Kings'' were \"blatantly ripping off the intellectual property of ''League of Legends''\", and reportedly brought these concerns to Tencent. Tencent then responded that they would changing its own game enough to sell as a standalone product with no relation to ''League of Legends''. Despite this, ''Honor of Kings'' already gained massive popularity in China and other chinese countries at this point. Tencent felt its too late to make huge changes to the game, so Tencent decided that ''Honor of Kings'' will only go through small necessary changes while the international release of the game outside mainland China will be the one that featuring different contents, hence leading to the creation of ''Arena of Valor''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-strained-relationship-tencent-declining-players-mobile-games-information-32079|title=Riot\u2019s relationship with Tencent has reportedly been strained over declining profits and mobile games|last=Mickunas |first=Aaron |website=dotesports|access-date=2018-08-21}}</ref> \n\n''Arena of Valor'' is developed by [[TiMi Studios]] with the same engine and UI design as ''Honor of Kings'' and published by [[Tencent Games]] for western marketing, with [[Garena]] joined the development as they helped to westernize the atmosphere of the game.

The game has multiple modes, with the main three being Grand Battle, Valley Skirmish and Abyssal Clash.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://samurai-gamers.com/arena-of-valor/game-modes-overview/|title=Arena of Valor (AoV) - Game Modes Overview (Abyssal Clash, Hook Wars, etc.)|last=Green|date=2018-02-20|website=SAMURAI GAMERS|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> Players compete in these matches which on average last for around 12 - 18 minutes. Players aim to destroy turrets on the map, in order to destroy the core.\n\nThe overall gameplay of ''Arena of Valor'' highly resembles a game called ''[[League of Legends]]'', a MOBA game developed and published by [[Riot Games]], which is a subsidiary of Tencent.\n\nPlayers control characters, referred to as heroes, and each of these heroes have a unique set of abilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arenaofvalor.com/|title=Arena of Valor|website=Arena of Valor|language=en|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> Heroes start the game at a low level, and can earn level up in various ways. Killing non-player creatures such as minions or monsters, defeating other players, destroying structures, passively through time and through special items that can be purchased through the shop. These actions also increase XP the player has, making them more powerful. The items purchased do not carry over matches, and therefore all players are on equal footing at the start of the match.\n\nMatches give players rewards, such as gold, which can then be used to buy a variety of heroes, or arcana.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/tips-to-earn-gold/|title=Tips to Earn Gold|website=Arena of Valor (AoV) Wiki Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> In addition to this, players can play a 'Ranked' match type, which allows them to attempt to go up in tiers in order to be matched with players who are at their skill level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://samurai-gamers.com/arena-of-valor/ranked-match/|title=Arena of Valor (AoV) - Ranked Match (Game Modes)|last=Green|date=2017-11-18|website=SAMURAI GAMERS|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> Stars are earnt for a victory, and lost when the player loses.\n\nThere are various game modes, with 5v5, also known as Grand Battle or Ranked, being the most popular. Here, players can choose a role to play in, such as marksmen, who do high damage yet have little health, or a tank, which has a lot of health. The team then coordinate in order to destroy the towers, and finally to destroy the enemy base. Players can choose to play in the 'jungle', which allows them to level up quicker and make a large difference to the game. \n\nIn addition to this, Valley Skirmish is a 3v3 game mode, using a much smaller map. In this version of the game, there is only one tower. These games are designed to be much quicker, for the player that does not have time for a longer game, and typically last for 4 - 6 minutes. Abyssal Clash is a game mode where players are randomly selected heroes, and have two towers they must destroy in order to reach the enemy base. Arena of Valor also has a deathmatch mode, however this is not as popular as the other three modes.\n\n=== Hero types ===\nThere are currently 98 heroes in ''Arena of Valor'' as of April 6, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arenaofvalor.com/|title=Arena of Valor Hero List|website=Arena of Valor|language=en|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> ''Arena of Valor'' divides the heroes into numerous categories that each play different roles.  The most notable difference is the type of damage a hero deals - some heroes deal physical damage, which can be countered by the armor stat, whilst other heroes deal mainly magic damage, which is resisted by the magic resistance stat. However, some heroes deal both types of damage, and some heroes deal 'True' damage, which cannot be countered by either the armour or magic resistance stat. All heroes are classified as one of six categories, however some heroes can overlap and go into more than one category. \n\n* Marksman: Also known as \"AD Carry/ADC\", marksmen are ranged heroes that usually deal physical damage. This hero type often deals sustained damage, and therefore are useful in team fights in order to reduce the health of the opponent. In addition to this, they are useful in taking objectives in order to win the game. However, they do not have much health and therefore are very vulnerable. Examples of marksmen are Valhein, Tel'Annas and Yorn.\n* Mage: Mages are sometimes known as \"AP Carry/APC\". These heroes deal lots of magic damage, often in a burst, however have weak defense and low mobility.  Mages are a mix of ranged heroes, which deal high amounts of burst damage from afar, melee heroes, which deal lots of damage from close up, or a mixture of both.  Examples of mages are Lauriel, Tulen and Liliana.\n* Assassin: These are melee range heroes that are designed to deal large amounts of damage quickly, and often do not have much health. This hero type often searches for the enemy's AD/AP Carry and other 'squishy' heroes,as well as being responsible to shut down enemy that is on a killing spree. They have high mobility and burst damage in order to be able to strike at valuable targets on the oppositions team such as the marksman or mage.  Examples of assassins are Zill, Nakroth and Murad.\n* [[Tank (gaming)|Tank]]: Tanks are heroes that have large amounts of HP, and usually built completely defensive to be able to take damage for the team.  As a result, they often deal little damage. However, they often have abilities known as 'crowd control' that allow them to inhibit the movement of the other team. In addition to this, they can use these abilities to prevent the enemy team from attacking high priority targets such as the marksman or mage. Examples of tanks are Xeniel, Thane and Toro.\n* Warrior:  Heroes that blend the attributes of damage dealer and tank, combining moderate survivability with respectable damage. Warriors usually have balanced amount of health,defenses,and attack damage,which is common designation for close-range melee duelist.Thus, they able to survive in a long period of fight and excel in doing continuos sustain damage. Examples of fighters are Omen, Zanis and Zephys.\n* Support: Heroes whose skills aid the rest of the team by providing healing, buffing allies (such as movement speed buffs), debuffing the enemy team (such as stunning), or a combination of the above. Support heroes often are paired with the marksman in the early laning phase of the game where the support doesn't attack minions, but instead focuses on aiding their partner and harassing the enemy heroes. Supports aid the marksman as they are often weaker during the early phase of the game and need support in order to survive. Example of supports are Krizzix, Alice and Annette.\n\nPlayers can purchase items, which make a large impact on the heroes stats and play style. An example of this is Butterfly, where if offensive items are bought, the hero deals lots of damage but has low amount of health and defenses and does not survive for long. If Butterfly buys a mix of offensive and defensive items, the hero can act as a warrior and take damage for the team whilst still dealing some damage. This can be applied to all heroes, allowing tanks to play as supports, or for mages to act as supports.\n\n== History and development ==\n''Arena of Valor'' (formerly ''Strike of Kings'') is an international adaptation of ''[[Wangzhe Rongyao|Honor of Kings]]'' for markets outside mainland China. In 2015, Tencent approached [[Riot Games]] and asked them to turn their popular game ''[[League of Legends]]'' into a mobile title. However, Riot Games declined and claimed that the gameplay of ''League of Legends'' could not be replicated on smartphones. Tencent then proceeded to create their own mobile game, ''[[Wangzhe Rongyao]]'', roughly translated to English as ''Honor of Kings'', and was released in November 26, 2015. Nevertheless, several Riot Games employees deemed that the design of characters and abilities in ''Honor of Kings'' were \"blatantly ripping off the intellectual property of ''League of Legends''\", and reportedly brought these concerns to Tencent. Tencent then responded that they would changing its own game enough to sell as a standalone product with no relation to ''League of Legends''. Despite this, ''Honor of Kings'' already gained massive popularity in China and other chinese countries at this point. Tencent felt its too late to make huge changes to the game, so Tencent decided that ''Honor of Kings'' will only go through small necessary changes while the international release of the game outside mainland China will be the one that featuring different contents, hence leading to the creation of ''Arena of Valor''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-strained-relationship-tencent-declining-players-mobile-games-information-32079|title=Riot\u2019s relationship with Tencent has reportedly been strained over declining profits and mobile games|last=Mickunas |first=Aaron |website=dotesports|access-date=2018-08-21}}</ref> \n\n''Arena of Valor'' is developed by [[TiMi Studios]] with the same engine and UI design as ''Honor of Kings'' and published by [[Tencent Games]] for western marketing, with [[Garena]] joined the development as they helped to westernize the atmosphere of the game.

With the decline of paper slips, some credit cards are no longer embossed and in fact the card number is no longer in the front.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dunaway|first1=Jaime|title=Why Are Credit Card Numbers on the Back Now?|url=https://slate.com/business/2018/04/why-are-credit-card-numbers-on-the-back-of-the-card-now.html|accessdate=18 April 2018|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=18 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Edward Bellamy's ''Looking Backward''===\nThe concept of using a card for purchases was described in 1887 by [[Edward Bellamy]] in his utopian novel ''[[Looking Backward]]''. Bellamy used the term ''credit card'' eleven times in this novel, although this referred to a card for spending a [[citizen's dividend]] from the government, rather than borrowing,<ref>(Chapters 9, 10, 11, 13, 25 and 26) and three times (Chapters 4, 8 and 19) in its sequel, ''Equality''</ref> making it more similar to a [[debit card]].\n\n===Charge coins, medals, and so on===\nCharge coins and other similar items were used from the late 19th century to the 1930s. They came in various shapes and sizes; with materials made out of [[celluloid]] (an early type of plastic), copper, aluminum, steel, and other types of whitish metals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-collectible-coins-charge-plate-1264.php|title=Life before plastic: Historical look at credit card materials|work=creditcards.com}}</ref> Each charge coin usually had a little hole, enabling it to be put in a key ring, like a key. These charge coins were usually given to customers who had charge accounts in department stores, hotels, and so on. A charge coin usually had the charge account number along with the merchant's name and logo.\n\nThe charge coin offered a simple and fast way to copy a charge account number to the sales slip, by imprinting the coin onto the sales slip. This sped the process of copying, previously done by [[handwriting]]. It also reduced the number of errors, by having a standardized form of numbers on the sales slip, instead of various kinds of handwriting style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shoppingdaysinretroboston.blogspot.com/2013/03/charge-coins-come-to-retro-boston.html|title=Shopping Days In Retro Boston|author=Charles Boston|work=shoppingdaysinretroboston.blogspot.com}}</ref>\n\nBecause the customer's name was not on the charge coin, almost anyone could use it. This sometimes led to a case of mistaken identity, either accidentally or intentionally, by acting on behalf of the charge account owner or out of malice to defraud both the charge account owner and the merchant. Beginning in the 1930s, merchants started to move from charge coins to the newer Charga-Plate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://departmentstoremuseum.blogspot.com/2010/11/charge-cards.html|title=The Department Store Museum: Charge Cards|work=departmentstoremuseum.blogspot.com}}</ref>\n\n===Early charge cards===\n====Charga-Plate====\nThe Charga-Plate, developed in 1928, was an early predecessor of the credit card and was used in the U.S. from the 1930s to the late 1950s. It was a {{convert|2+1/2|\u00d7|1+1/4|in|mm|adj=on}} rectangle of sheet metal related to [[Addressograph]] and military [[Dog tag (identifier)|dog tag]] systems. It was embossed with the customer's name, city, and state<!-- Yes, no street address -->. It held a small paper card on its back for a signature. In recording a purchase, the plate was laid into a recess in the imprinter, with a paper \"charge slip\" positioned on top of it. The record of the transaction included an impression of the embossed information, made by the imprinter pressing an [[typewriter ribbon|inked ribbon]] against the charge slip.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cultureandcommunication.org/deadmedia/index.php/Credit_Card_Imprinter |title=Credit card imprinter |publisher=Cultureandcommunication.org |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> Charga-Plate was a trademark of Farrington Manufacturing Co.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/215/668/55263/|title=Hartford Charga-plate Associates, Incorporated, Plaintiff-appellant, v.

In some cases, the plates were kept in the issuing store rather than held by customers. When an authorized user made a purchase, a clerk retrieved the plate from the store's files and then processed the purchase. Charga-Plates speeded back-office bookkeeping and reduced copying errors that were done manually in paper ledgers in each store.\n\n===={{anchor|Air Travel Card}}Air Travel Card====\nIn 1934, [[American Airlines]] and the [[Air Transport Association]] simplified the process even more with the advent of the [[Universal Air Travel Plan|Air Travel Card]].<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The Travel Card that gave \"CREDIT\" to the public |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXIHl--RuqkC&pg=PA11 |magazine=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date=June 1953 |volume=52 |issue=6 |page=11 |access-date=11 November 2018}}</ref> They created a numbering scheme that identified the issuer of the card as well as the customer account. This is the reason the modern [[Universal Air Travel Plan|UATP]] cards still start with the number 1. With an Air Travel Card, passengers could \"buy now, and pay later\" for a ticket against their credit and receive a fifteen percent discount at any of the accepting airlines. By the 1940s, all of the major U.S. airlines offered Air Travel Cards that could be used on 17 different airlines. By 1941, about half of the airlines' revenues came through the Air Travel Card agreement. The airlines had also started offering installment plans to lure new travelers into the air. In October 1948, the Air Travel Card became the first internationally valid charge card within all members of the [[International Air Transport Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creditcardprocessingspace.com/history-of-the-credit-card/ |title=History Of The Credit Card |publisher=www.creditcardprocessingspace.com |accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Early general purpose charge cards: Diners Club, Carte Blanche, and American Express====\nThe concept of customers paying different merchants using the same card was expanded in 1950 by Ralph Schneider and [[Frank X. McNamara|Frank McNamara]], founders of [[Diners Club]], to consolidate multiple cards. The Diners Club, which was created partially through a merger with Dine and Sign, produced the first \"general purpose\" [[charge card]] and required the entire bill to be paid with each statement. That was followed by [[Carte Blanche (credit card)#Carte Blanche|Carte Blanche]] and in 1958 by [[American Express]] which created a worldwide credit card network (although these were initially charge cards that later acquired credit card features).\n\n===BankAmericard and Master Charge===\n[[File:Mastercharge_and_Bankamericard.jpg|thumb|right|Metal signs at a plant nursery in Los Angeles County, California marketing Mastercharge and Bankamericard]]\nUntil 1958, no one had been able to successfully establish a ''revolving credit'' financial system in which a card issued by a third-party bank was being generally accepted by a large number of merchants, as opposed to merchant-issued revolving cards accepted by only a few merchants. There had been a dozen attempts by small American banks, but none of them were able to last very long. In September 1958, [[Bank of America]] launched the ''BankAmericard'' in [[Fresno, California]], which would become the first successful recognizably modern credit card. This card succeeded where others failed by breaking the chicken-and-egg cycle in which consumers did not want to use a card that few merchants would accept and merchants did not want to accept a card that few consumers used. Bank of America chose Fresno because 45% of its residents used the bank, and by sending a card to 60,000 Fresno residents at once, the bank was able to convince merchants to accept the card.<ref name=pricenomics>{{cite web|last1=Mayyasi|first1=Alex|title=How Credit Cards Tax America|url=http://priceonomics.com/how-credit-cards-tax-america/|website=Pricenomics}}</ref> It was eventually licensed to other banks around the United States and then around the world, and in 1976, all BankAmericard licensees united themselves under the common brand [[Visa Inc.|Visa]]. In 1966, the ancestor of [[MasterCard]] was born when a group of banks established Master Charge to compete with BankAmericard; it received a significant boost when [[Citibank]] merged its own [[Everything Card]], launched in 1967, into Master Charge in 1969.\n\nEarly credit cards in the U.S., of which BankAmericard was the most prominent example, were mass-produced and mass mailed unsolicited to bank customers who were thought to be good credit risks. They have been mailed off to unemployable people, drunks, narcotics addicts and to compulsive debtors, a process President Johnson's Special Assistant [[Betty Furness]] found very like \"giving sugar to [[diabetics]]\".<ref>{{cite journal | author = O'Neill, Paul | title = A Little Gift from Your Friendly Banker | journal = [[Life (magazine)|LIFE]] | date = 27 April 1970}}</ref> These mass mailings were known as \"drops\" in banking terminology, and were outlawed in 1970 due to the financial chaos they caused. However, by the time the law came into effect, approximately 100 million credit cards had been dropped into the U.S. population. After 1970, only credit card applications could be sent unsolicited in mass mailings.\n\nBefore the computerization of credit card systems in America, using a credit card to pay at a merchant was significantly more complicated than it is today. Each time a consumer wanted to use a credit card, the merchant would have to call their bank, who in turn had to call the credit card company, which then had to have an employee manually look up the customer's name and credit balance. This system was computerized in 1973 under the leadership of [[Dee Hock]], the first CEO of Visa, allowing transaction time to decrease substantially to less than one minute.<ref name=\"pricenomics\" />  However, until always-connected [[payment terminal]]s became ubiquitous at the beginning of the 21st century, it was common for a merchant to accept a charge, especially below a threshold value or from a known and trusted customer, without verifying it by phone.  Books with lists of stolen card numbers were distributed to merchants who were supposed in any case to check cards against the list before accepting them, as well as verifying the signature on the charge slip against that on the card.   Merchants who failed to take the time to follow the proper verification procedures were liable for fraudulent charges, but because of the cumbersome nature of the procedures, merchants would often simply skip some or all of them and assume the risk for smaller transactions.\n\n===Development outside North America===\nThe fractured nature of the U.S. banking system under the [[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]] meant that credit cards became an effective way for those who were traveling around the country to move their credit to places where they could not directly use their banking facilities. There are now countless variations on the basic concept of revolving credit for individuals (as issued by banks and honored by a network of financial institutions), including organization-branded credit cards, corporate-user credit cards, store cards and so on.\n\nIn 1966, [[Barclaycard]] in the [[United Kingdom]] launched the first credit card outside the United States.\n\nAlthough credit cards reached very high adoption levels in the US, Canada and the UK during the latter 20th century, many cultures were more cash-oriented or developed alternative forms of cashless payments, such as [[Carte Bleue|Carte bleue]] or the [[Eurocard (payment card)|Eurocard]] (Germany, France, Switzerland, and others). In these places, adoption of credit cards was initially much slower. Due to strict regulations regarding bank overdrafts, some countries, France in particular, were much quicker to develop and adopt chip-based credit cards which are seen as major anti-fraud credit devices. [[Debit card]]s and [[online banking]] (using either [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]s or PCs{{clarify|date=August 2015}}) are used more widely than credit cards in some countries. It took until the 1990s to reach anything like the percentage market penetration levels achieved in the US, Canada, and UK. In some countries, acceptance still remains low as the use of a credit card system depends on the banking system of each country; while in others, a country sometimes had to develop its own credit card network, e.g. UK's Barclaycard and [[Australia]]'s [[Bankcard]]. [[Japan]] remains a very cash-oriented society, with credit card adoption being limited mainly to the largest of merchants; although stored value cards (such as [[telephone cards]]) are used as [[Telephone token|alternative currencies]], the trend is toward [[RFID]]-based systems inside cards, cellphones, and other objects.\n\n===Vintage, old, and unique credit cards as collectibles===\n[[File:Credit card receipt - old style.jpg|right|thumb|Receipt from 1997 - card physically swiped and information imprinted on the receipt]]\nThe design of the credit card itself has become a major selling point in recent years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-latest-american-status-symbol-metal-credit-cards-2017-04-25|title=Metal credit cards: The latest American status symbol|last=LaMagna|first=Maria|work=MarketWatch|access-date=7 March 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The value of the card to the issuer is often related to the customer's usage of the card, or to the customer's financial worth. This has led to the rise of Co-Brand and [[Affinity credit card|Affinity]] cards, where the card design is related to the \"affinity\" (a university or professional society, for example) leading to higher card usage. In most cases a percentage of the value of the card is returned to the affinity group.\n\nA growing field of [[numismatics]] (study of money), or more specifically [[exonumia]] (study of money-like objects), credit card collectors seek to collect various embodiments of credit from the now familiar plastic cards to older paper merchant cards, and even [[metal]] tokens that were accepted as merchant credit cards. Early credit cards were made of [[celluloid]] plastic, then metal and [[fiber]], then paper, and are now mostly [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) plastic.\nHowever the chip part of credit cards is not made from plastic but from metals.\n\n==Usage==\nA credit card issuing company, such as a bank or credit union, enters into agreements with merchants for them to accept their credit cards. Merchants often advertise which cards they accept by displaying [[acceptance mark]]s \u2013 generally derived from logos \u2013 or this may be communicated in signage in the establishment or in company material (e.g., a restaurant's menu may indicate which credit cards are accepted). Merchants may also communicate this orally, as in \"We take (brands X, Y, and Z)\" or \"We don't take credit cards\".\n\n[[File:Credit card logos (2015-12-1816-27-350044).jpg|thumbnail|upright|right|[[Visa credit card|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], [[American Express]] are card-issuing entities that set transaction terms for merchants, card-issuing banks, and acquiring banks.]]\nThe credit card issuer issues a credit card to a customer at the time or after an account has been approved by the credit provider, which need not be the same entity as the card issuer. The cardholders can then use it to make purchases at merchants accepting that card. When a purchase is made, the cardholder agrees to pay the card issuer. The cardholder indicates consent to pay by signing a [[receipt]] with a record of the card details and indicating the amount to be paid or by entering a [[personal identification number]] (PIN). Also, many merchants now accept verbal authorizations via telephone and electronic authorization using the Internet, known as a [[card not present transaction]] (CNP).\n\n[[Electronics|Electronic]] [[Credit card verification|verification]] systems allow merchants to verify in a few seconds that the card is valid and the cardholder has sufficient credit to cover the purchase, allowing the verification to happen at time of purchase. The verification is performed using a [[credit card terminal|credit card payment terminal]] or [[point of sale|point-of-sale]] (POS) system with a communications link to the merchant's acquiring bank. Data from the card is obtained from a [[Magnetic stripe card|magnetic stripe]] or [[Smart card|chip]] on the card; the latter system is called [[Chip and PIN]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], and is implemented as an [[EMV]] card.\n\nFor [[card not present transaction]]s where the card is not shown (e.g., [[Electronic commerce|e-commerce]], [[mail order]], and telephone sales), merchants additionally verify that the customer is in physical possession of the card and is the authorized user by asking for additional information such as the [[Card Security Code|security code]] printed on the back of the card, date of expiry, and billing address.\n\nEach month, the cardholder is sent a statement indicating the purchases made with the card, any outstanding fees, the total amount owed and the minimum payment due. In the US, after receiving the statement, the cardholder may dispute any charges that he or she thinks are incorrect (see {{USC|15|1643}}, which limits cardholder liability for unauthorized use of a credit card to $50). The [[Fair Credit Billing Act]] gives details of the U.S. regulations.\n\nMany banks now also offer the option of electronic statements, either in lieu of or in addition to physical statements, which can be viewed at any time by the cardholder via the issuer's [[online banking]] website. Notification of the availability of a new statement is generally sent to the cardholder's email address. If the card issuer has chosen to allow it, the cardholder may have other options for payment besides a physical check, such as an electronic transfer of funds from a checking account. Depending on the issuer, the cardholder may also be able to make multiple payments during a single statement period, possibly enabling him or her to utilize the credit limit on the card several times.\n\n===Minimum payment===\nThe cardholder must pay a defined minimum portion of the amount owed by a due date, or may choose to pay a higher amount. The credit issuer charges [[interest]] on the unpaid balance if the billed amount is not paid in full (typically at a much higher rate than most other forms of debt). In addition, if the cardholder fails to make at least the minimum payment by the due date, the issuer may impose a [[late fee]] or other penalties. To help mitigate this, some financial institutions can arrange for automatic payments to be deducted from the cardholder's bank account, thus avoiding such penalties altogether, as long as the cardholder has sufficient funds.\n\nIn cases where the minimum payment is less than the finance charges and fees assessed during the billing cycle, the outstanding balance will increase in what is called [[negative amortization]]. This practice tends to increase credit risk and mask the lender's portfolio quality, and consequently has been banned in the U.S. since 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/bcreg/2003/20030108/attachment.pdf|title=Credit Card Lending}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/minimum-credit-card-payments-1267.php|title=Understanding how credit card minimum payments are set}}</ref>\n\n===Advertising, solicitation, application and approval===\nCredit card advertising regulations in the U.S. include the [[Schumer box]] disclosure requirements. A large fraction of junk mail consists of credit card offers created from lists provided by the major [[credit reporting agency|credit reporting agencies]]. In the United States, the three major U.S. credit bureaus ([[Equifax]], [[TransUnion]] and [[Experian]]) allow consumers to opt out from related credit card solicitation offers via its [[Optoutprescreen.com|Opt Out Pre Screen]] program.\n\n===Interest charges===\nCredit card issuers usually waive interest charges if the balance is paid in full each month, but typically will charge full interest on the entire outstanding balance from the date of each purchase if the total balance is not paid.\n\nFor example, if a user had a $1,000 transaction and repaid it in full within this grace period, there would be no interest charged. If, however, even $1.00 of the total amount remained unpaid, interest would be charged on the $1,000 from the date of purchase until the payment is received. The precise manner in which interest is charged is usually detailed in a cardholder agreement which may be summarized on the back of the monthly statement. The general calculation formula most financial institutions use to determine the amount of interest to be charged is (APR/100 x ADB)/365 x number of days revolved. Take the [[annual percentage rate]] (APR) and divide by 100 then multiply to the amount of the average daily balance (ADB).  Divide the result by 365 and then take this total and multiply by the total number of days the amount revolved before payment was made on the account. Financial institutions refer to interest charged back to the original time of the transaction and up to the time a payment was made, if not in full, as a residual retail finance charge (RRFC). Thus after an amount has revolved and a payment has been made, the user of the card will still receive interest charges on their statement after paying the next statement in full (in fact the statement may only have a charge for interest that collected up until the date the full balance was paid, i.e. when the balance stopped revolving).\n\nThe credit card may simply serve as a form of [[revolving credit]], or it may become a complicated financial instrument with multiple balance segments each at a different interest rate, possibly with a single umbrella credit limit, or with separate credit limits applicable to the various balance segments. Usually this compartmentalization is the result of special incentive offers from the issuing bank, to encourage [[balance transfer]]s from cards of other issuers. In the event that several interest rates apply to various balance segments, payment allocation is generally at the discretion of the issuing bank, and payments will therefore usually be allocated towards the lowest rate balances until paid in full before any money is paid towards higher rate balances. [[Interest rate]]s can vary considerably from card to card, and the interest rate on a particular card may jump dramatically if the card user is late with a payment on that card ''or any other credit instrument'', or even if the issuing bank decides to raise its revenue.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Grace period===\nA credit card's grace period is the time the cardholder has to pay the balance before interest is assessed on the outstanding balance. Grace periods may vary, but usually range from 20 to 55 days depending on the type of credit card and the issuing bank. Some policies allow for reinstatement after certain conditions are met.\n\nUsually, if a cardholder is late paying the balance, finance charges will be calculated and the grace period does not apply. Finance charges incurred depend on the grace period and balance; with most credit cards there is no grace period if there is any outstanding balance from the previous billing cycle or statement (i.e. interest is applied on both the previous balance and new transactions). However, there are some credit cards that will only apply finance charge on the previous or old balance, excluding new transactions.\n\n===Parties involved===\n* Cardholder: The holder of the card used to make a purchase; the [[consumer]].\n* Card-issuing bank: The financial institution or other organization that issued the credit card to the cardholder. This bank bills the consumer for repayment and bears the risk that the card is used fraudulently. American Express and Discover were previously the only card-issuing banks for their respective brands, but as of 2007, this is no longer the case. Cards issued by banks to cardholders in a different country are known as [[offshore credit card]]s.\n* Merchant: The individual or business accepting credit card payments for products or services sold to the cardholder.\n* [[Acquiring bank]]: The financial institution accepting payment for the products or services on behalf of the merchant.\n* [[Independent sales organization]]: Re-sellers (to merchants) of the services of the acquiring bank.\n* [[Merchant account]]: This could refer to the acquiring bank or the independent sales organization, but in general is the organization that the merchant deals with.\n* [[Card association]]: An association of card-issuing banks such as [[Discover Card|Discover]], [[Visa (company)|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], [[American Express]], etc. that set transaction terms for merchants, card-issuing banks, and acquiring banks.\n* Transaction network: The system that implements the mechanics of the electronic transactions. May be operated by an independent company, and one company may operate multiple networks.\n* Affinity partner: Some institutions lend their names to an issuer to attract customers that have a strong relationship with that institution, and get paid a fee or a percentage of the balance for each card issued using their name. Examples of typical affinity partners are sports teams, universities, charities, professional organizations, and major retailers.\n* Insurance providers: Insurers underwriting various insurance protections offered as credit card perks, for example, Car Rental Insurance, Purchase Security, Hotel Burglary Insurance, Travel Medical Protection etc.\n\nThe flow of information and money between these parties \u2014 always through the card associations \u2014 is known as the interchange, and it consists of a few steps.\n\n===Transaction steps===\n* '''[[Authorization hold|Authorization]]''': The cardholder presents the card as payment to the merchant and the merchant submits the transaction to the acquirer (acquiring bank). The acquirer verifies the credit card number, the transaction type and the amount with the issuer (card-issuing bank) and reserves that amount of the cardholder's credit limit for the merchant. An authorization will generate an approval code, which the merchant stores with the transaction.\n* '''Batching''': Authorized transactions are stored in \"batches\", which are sent to the acquirer. Batches are typically submitted once per day at the end of the business day. If a transaction is not submitted in the batch, the authorization will stay valid for a period determined by the issuer, after which the held amount will be returned to the cardholder's available credit (see [[authorization hold]]). Some transactions may be submitted in the batch without prior authorizations; these are either transactions falling under the merchant's [[floor limit]] or ones where the authorization was unsuccessful but the merchant still attempts to force the transaction through. (Such may be the case when the cardholder is not present but owes the merchant additional money, such as extending a hotel stay or car rental.)\n* '''Clearing and Settlement''': The acquirer sends the batch transactions through the credit card association, which debits the issuers for payment and credits the acquirer. Essentially, the issuer pays the acquirer for the transaction.\n* '''Funding''': Once the acquirer has been paid, the acquirer pays the merchant. The merchant receives the amount totaling the funds in the batch minus either the \"discount rate\", \"mid-qualified rate\", or \"non-qualified rate\" which are tiers of fees the merchant pays the acquirer for processing the transactions.\n* '''Chargebacks''': A [[chargeback]] is an event in which money in a merchant account is held due to a dispute relating to the transaction. Chargebacks are typically initiated by the cardholder. In the event of a chargeback, the issuer returns the transaction to the acquirer for resolution. The acquirer then forwards the chargeback to the merchant, who must either accept the chargeback or contest it.\n\n=== Credit card register ===\nA credit card register is a transaction register used to ensure the increasing balance owed from using a credit card is enough below the credit limit to deal with authorization holds and payments not yet received by the bank and to easily look up past transactions for reconciliation and budgeting.\n\nThe register is a personal record of banking transactions used for credit card purchases as they affect funds in the bank account or the available credit. In addition to check number and so forth the code column indicates the credit card. The balance column shows available funds after purchases.  When the credit card payment is made the balance already reflects the funds were spent. In a credit card's entry, the deposit column shows the available credit and the payment column shows total owed, their sum being equal to the credit limit.\n\nEach check written, debit card transaction, cash withdrawal, and credit card charge is entered manually into the paper register daily or several times per week.<ref>Little, Ken. 2007. ''Personal Finance At Your Fingertips'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=uPmUliMCKQwC&lpg=PA35&dq=personal%20credit%20card%20and%20debit%20card%20registers%20or%20transaction%20records&pg=PA35#v=onepage&q&f=true p. 35] Penguin. {{ISBN|144062562X}}, 9781440625626</ref> Credit card register also refers to one transaction record for each credit card. In this case the booklets readily enable the location of a card's current available credit when ten or more cards are in use.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Features==\nAs well as convenient credit, credit cards offer consumers an easy way to track [[expense]]s, which is necessary for both monitoring personal expenditures and the tracking of work-related expenses for [[tax]]ation and [[reimbursement]] purposes. Credit cards are accepted in larger establishments in almost all countries, and are available with a variety of credit limits, repayment arrangements. Some have added perks (such as insurance protection, [[Loyalty program|rewards schemes]] in which points earned by purchasing goods with the card can be redeemed for further [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] or [[Cashback reward program|cashback]]).\n\n===Consumers' limited liability===\nSome countries, such as the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[France]], limit the amount for which a consumer can be held [[Legal liability|liable]] in the event of fraudulent transactions with a lost or stolen credit card.\n\n==Specialized types==\n\n===Business credit cards===\n{{See also|Stored-value card}}\nBusiness credit cards are specialized credit cards issued in the name of a registered business, and typically they can only be used for business purposes. Their use has grown in recent decades. In 1998, for instance, 37% of small businesses reported using a business credit card; by 2009, this number had grown to 64%.<ref name=FedReport>{{cite web|title=Report to the Congress on the Use of Credit Cards by Small Businesses and the Credit Card Market for Small Businesses|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/conferences/sbc_smallbusinesscredit.pdf|website=Federal Reserve|publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System|accessdate=4 May 2015|date=May 2010}}</ref>\n\nBusiness credit cards offer a number of features specific to businesses. They frequently offer special rewards in areas such as shipping, office supplies, travel, and business technology. Most issuers use the applicant's personal [[credit score]] when evaluating these applications. In addition, income from a variety of sources may be used to qualify, which means these cards may be available to businesses that are newly established.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.allbusiness.com/5-business-credit-card-myths-can-cost-business-109526-1.html|title=5 Business Credit Card Myths That Can Cost Your Business {{!}} AllBusiness.com|date=21 December 2016|work=AllBusiness.com|access-date=10 April 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> In addition, most major issuers of these cards do not report account activity to the owner's personal credit unless there is a default.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} This may have the effect of protecting the owner's personal credit from the activity of the business.\n\nBusiness credit cards are offered by almost all major card issuers\u2014like American Express, Visa, and MasterCard in addition to local banks and credit unions. Charge cards for businesses, however, are currently only offered by American Express.\n\n===Secured credit cards===\nA secured credit card is a type of credit card secured by a [[deposit account]] owned by the cardholder. Typically, the cardholder must deposit between 100% and 200% of the total amount of credit desired. Thus if the cardholder puts down $1,000, they will be given credit in the range of $500\u20131,000. In some cases, credit card issuers will offer incentives even on their secured card portfolios. In these cases, the deposit required may be significantly less than the required credit limit, and can be as low as 10% of the desired credit limit. This deposit is held in a special [[savings deposit|savings account]]. Credit card issuers offer this because they have noticed that delinquencies were notably reduced when the customer perceives something to lose if the balance is not repaid.\n\nThe cardholder of a secured credit card is still expected to make regular payments, as with a regular credit card, but should they default on a payment, the card issuer has the option of recovering the cost of the purchases paid to the merchants out of the deposit. The advantage of the secured card for an individual with negative or no credit history is that most companies report regularly to the major credit bureaus. This allows building a positive credit history.\n\nAlthough the deposit is in the hands of the credit card issuer as security in the event of default by the consumer, the deposit will not be debited simply for missing one or two payments. Usually the deposit is only used as an offset when the account is closed, either at the request of the customer or due to severe delinquency (150 to 180 days). This means that an account which is less than 150 days delinquent will continue to accrue interest and fees, and could result in a balance which is much higher than the actual credit limit on the card. In these cases the total debt may far exceed the original deposit and the cardholder not only forfeits their deposit but is left with an additional debt.\n\nMost of these conditions are usually described in a cardholder agreement which the cardholder signs when their account is opened.\n\nSecured credit cards are an option to allow a person with a poor [[credit history]] or no credit history to have a credit card which might not otherwise be available. They are often offered as a means of rebuilding one's credit. Fees and service charges for secured credit cards often exceed those charged for ordinary non-secured credit cards. For people in certain situations, (for example, after charging off on other credit cards, or people with a long history of delinquency on various forms of debt), secured cards are almost always more expensive than unsecured credit cards.\n\nSometimes a credit card will be secured by [[home equity|the equity in the borrower's home]].\n\n===Prepaid cards===\n{{See also|Stored-value card}}\nA \"prepaid credit card\" is not a true credit card,<ref name=\"fcac\"/> since no credit is offered by the card issuer: the cardholder spends money which has been \"stored\" via a prior deposit by the cardholder or someone else, such as a parent or employer. However, it carries a credit-card brand (such as [[Discover Card|Discover]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], [[American Express]], or [[Japan Credit Bureau|JCB]]) and can be used in similar ways just as though it were a credit card.<ref name=\"fcac\"/> Unlike debit cards, prepaid credit cards generally do not require a PIN. An exception are prepaid credit cards with an [[EMV]] chip. These cards do require a PIN if the payment is processed via [[Chip and PIN]] technology.\n\nAfter purchasing the card, the cardholder loads the account with any amount of money, up to the predetermined card limit and then uses the card to make purchases the same way as a typical credit card. Prepaid cards can be issued to minors (above 13) since there is no credit line involved. The main advantage over secured credit cards (see above section) is that the cardholder is not required to come up with $500 or more to open an account. With prepaid credit cards purchasers are not charged any interest but are often charged a purchasing fee plus monthly fees after an arbitrary time period. Many other fees also usually apply to a prepaid card.<ref name=\"fcac\">{{cite web| url=http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PrepaidCards_e.asp| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307084013/http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PrepaidCards_e.asp| archivedate=7 March 2007| title=Credit Cards and You \u2013 About Pre-paid Cards| publisher=[[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]]| accessdate=9 January 2008}} document: {{cite web| url=http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PDFs/Prepaid-e.pdf| title=Pre-paid Cards| publisher=[[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]]| format=PDF| accessdate=9 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080229122947/http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PDFs/Prepaid-e.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 29 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nPrepaid credit cards are sometimes marketed to teenagers<ref name=\"fcac\"/> for shopping online without having their parents complete the transaction.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070302185119/http://www.networkworld.com/community/?q=node/11433 \"Buy prepaid credit cards without an ID or age limits?

As all credit cards charge fees and interest, some customers become so indebted to their credit card provider that they are driven to [[bankruptcy]]. Some credit cards often levy a rate of 20 to 30 percent after a payment is missed.<ref>{{cite web|author=CreditCards.com |url=http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/default-penalty-rates-what-they-are-how-to-avoid-1276.php |title=Credit card penalty rates can top 30 percent; how to avoid them |publisher=Creditcards.com |date=27 January 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> In other cases, a fixed charge is levied without change to the interest rate. In some cases [[universal default]] may apply: the high default rate is applied to a card in good standing by missing a payment on an unrelated account from the same provider. This can lead to a snowball effect in which the consumer is drowned by unexpectedly high interest rates. Further, most card holder agreements enable the issuer to arbitrarily raise the interest rate for any reason they see fit. [[First Premier Bank]] at one point offered a credit card with a 79.9% interest rate;<ref>{{cite web|last=Prater |first=Connie |url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/issuer-of-79-9-interest-rate-credit-card-defends-its-product |title=Issuer of 79.9% interest rate credit card defends its product |publisher=FoxBusiness.com |date=7 April 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> however, they discontinued this card in February 2011 because of persistent defaults.<ref>{{cite web|last = Ellis|first = Blake|url = http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/16/pf/first_premier_credit_card_removed/|title = First Premier Bank removes credit card with 59.9% APR|publisher = CNN|date = 17 February 2011|accessdate = 1 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nResearch shows that a substantial fraction of consumers (about 40 percent) choose a sub-optimal credit card agreement, with some incurring hundreds of dollars of avoidable interest costs.<ref>[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2006/wp2006_11.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''Do Consumers Choose the Right Credit Contracts?'', October 2006]</ref>\n\n====Weakens self regulation====\nSeveral studies have shown that consumers are likely to spend more money when they pay by credit card.

Most simply display the [[acceptance mark]]s (stylized logos, shown in the upper-left corner of the sign) of all the cards they accept.]]\nFor [[merchants]], a credit card transaction is often more secure than other forms of payment, such as [[cheque]]s, because the issuing bank commits to pay the merchant the moment the transaction is authorized, regardless of whether the consumer defaults on the credit card payment (except for legitimate disputes, which are discussed below, and can result in charges back to the merchant). In most cases, cards are even more secure than cash, because they discourage theft by the merchant's employees and reduce the amount of cash on the premises. Finally, credit cards reduce the back office expense of processing checks/cash and transporting them to the bank.\n\nPrior to credit cards, each merchant had to evaluate each customer's [[credit history]] before extending credit. That task is now performed by the banks which assume the [[credit risk]]. Credit cards can also aid in securing a sale especially if the customer does not have enough cash on hand or in a checking account. Extra turnover is generated by the fact that the customer can purchase goods and services immediately and is less inhibited by the amount of cash in pocket and the immediate state of the customer's bank balance. Much of merchants' marketing is based on this immediacy.\n\nFor each purchase, the bank charges the merchant a commission (discount fee) for this service and there may be a certain delay before the agreed payment is received by the merchant. The commission is often a percentage of the transaction amount, plus a fixed fee (interchange rate).\n\n===Costs to merchants===\nMerchants are charged several fees for accepting credit cards. The merchant is usually charged a [[commission (remuneration)|commission]] of around 1 to 4 percent of the value of each transaction paid for by credit card.<ref name=gensler2013>{{Citation\n |last=Gensler |first=Lauren |date=April 2013 |title=You (Probably) Won't Pay More to Swipe |magazine=[[Money (magazine)|Money]] |publication-place=New York |page=14}}</ref> The merchant may also pay a variable charge, called a merchant discount rate, for each transaction.<ref name=how/> In some instances of very low-value transactions, use of credit cards will significantly reduce the [[profit margin]] or cause the merchant to lose money on the transaction. Merchants with very low average transaction prices or very high average transaction prices are more averse to accepting credit cards. In some cases merchants may charge users a \"credit card supplement\" (or surcharge), either a fixed amount or a percentage, for payment by credit card.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmibaby.com/bmibaby/terms_and_conditions/our_top_booking_tips,_baby/fees_and_charges.aspx |title=Example of a supplement chargeable to the customer when paying by credit card |publisher=Bmibaby.com |date=5 January 2011 |accessdate=28 July 2011 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708074413/http://www.bmibaby.com/bmibaby/terms_and_conditions/our_top_booking_tips%2C_baby/fees_and_charges.aspx |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df= }}</ref> This practice was prohibited by most credit card contracts in the United States until 2013, when a major settlement between merchants and credit card companies allowed merchants to levy surcharges.

Merchants charged that the two main credit card processing companies, MasterCard and Visa, used their [[monopoly power]] to levy excessive fees in a class-action lawsuit involving the [[National Retail Federation]] and major retailers such as [[Wal-Mart]]. In December 2013, a federal judge approved a $5.7 billion [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] in the case that offered payouts to merchants who had paid credit card fees, the largest antitrust settlement in U.S. history. Some large retailers, such as Wal-Mart and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], chose to not participate in this settlement, however, and have continued their legal fight against the credit card companies.<ref name=washpost />\n\nMerchants are also required to lease or purchase processing equipment, in some cases this equipment is provided free of charge by the [[Payment processor|processor]]. Merchants must also satisfy data security compliance standards which are highly technical and complicated. In many cases, there is a delay of several days before funds are deposited into a merchant's bank account. Because credit card fee structures are very complicated, smaller merchants are at a disadvantage to analyze and predict fees.\n\nFinally, merchants assume the risk of [[chargebacks]] by consumers.\n\n==Security==\n{{Main|Credit card fraud}}\n{{See also|Wireless identity theft}}\n\nCredit card security relies on the physical security of the plastic card as well as the privacy of the credit card number. Therefore, whenever a person other than the card owner has access to the card or its number, security is potentially compromised. Once, merchants would often accept credit card numbers without additional verification for mail order purchases. It is now common practice to only ship to confirmed addresses as a security measure to minimise fraudulent purchases. Some merchants will accept a credit card number for in-store purchases, whereupon access to the number allows easy fraud, but many require the card itself to be present, and require a signature (for magnetic stripe cards). A lost or stolen card can be cancelled, and if this is done quickly, will greatly limit the fraud that can take place in this way. European banks can require a cardholder's security PIN be entered for in-person purchases with the card.\n\nThe [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]] (PCI DSS) is the security standard issued by the [[Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council]] (PCI SSC). This data security standard is used by acquiring banks to impose cardholder data security measures upon their merchants.\n\nThe goal of the credit card companies is not to eliminate fraud, but to \"reduce it to manageable levels\".<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Thrive Business Solutions |url=http://www.thrivesolution.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=28&Itemid=33 |title=PCI Compliance |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305093414/http://www.thrivesolution.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=28&Itemid=33 |archivedate=5 March 2008}}</ref> This implies that fraud prevention measures will be used only if their cost are lower than the potential gains from fraud reduction, whereas high-cost low-return measures will not be used \u2013 as would be expected from organizations whose goal is profit maximization.\n\n[[Internet fraud]] may be by claiming a [[chargeback]] which is not justified (\"[[friendly fraud]]\"), or carried out by the use of credit card information which can be stolen in many ways, the simplest being copying information from retailers, either [[online]] or [[Off-line|offline]]. Despite efforts to improve security for remote purchases using credit cards, security breaches are usually the result of poor practice by merchants. For example, a website that safely uses [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] to encrypt card data from a client may then email the data, unencrypted, from the webserver to the merchant; or the merchant may store unencrypted details in a way that allows them to be accessed over the Internet or by a rogue employee; unencrypted card details are always a security risk. Even encrypted data may be cracked.\n\n[[Controlled payment number]]s (also known as virtual credit cards or disposable credit cards) are another option for protecting against credit card fraud where presentation of a physical card is not required, as in telephone and online purchasing. These are one-time use numbers that function as a payment card and are linked to the user's real account, but do not reveal details, and cannot be used for subsequent unauthorised transactions. They can be valid for a relatively short time, and limited to the actual amount of the purchase or a limit set by the user. Their use can be limited to one merchant. If the number given to the merchant is compromised, it will be rejected if an attempt is made to use it a second time.\n\nA similar system of controls can be used on physical cards. Technology provides the option for banks to support many other controls too that can be turned on and off and varied by the credit card owner in real time as circumstances change (i.e., they can change temporal, numerical, geographical and many other parameters on their primary and subsidiary cards). Apart from the obvious benefits of such controls: from a security perspective this means that a customer can have a Chip and PIN card secured for the real world, and limited for use in the home country. In this eventuality a thief stealing the details will be prevented from using these overseas in non chip and pin [[EMV]] countries. Similarly the real card can be restricted from use on-line so that stolen details will be declined if this tried. Then when card users shop online they can use virtual account numbers. In both circumstances an alert system can be built in notifying a user that a fraudulent attempt has been made which breaches their parameters, and can provide data on this in real time.\n\nAdditionally, there are security features present on the physical card itself in order to prevent [[counterfeiting]]. For example, most modern credit cards have a [[watermark]] that will fluoresce under [[Wood's lamp|ultraviolet light]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Counterfeit Detection |url=https://www.fraudfighter.com/hs-fs/hub/76574/file-1552643545-pdf |access-date=January 28, 2020}}</ref> Most major credit cards have a [[hologram]]. A Visa card has a letter V superimposed over the regular Visa logo and a MasterCard has the letters MC across the front of the card. Older Visa cards have a bald eagle or dove across the front. In the aforementioned cases, the security features are only visible under ultraviolet light and are invisible in normal light.\n\nThe [[United States Department of Justice]], [[United States Secret Service]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]], and [[U.S. Postal Inspection Service]] are responsible for prosecuting criminals who engage in [[credit card fraud]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |title=Identity Theft and Identity Fraud |url=https://www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/identity-theft/identity-theft-and-identity-fraud |access-date=January 28, 2020}}</ref> However, they do not have the resources to pursue all criminals, and in general they only prosecute cases exceeding $5,000.\n\nThree improvements to card security have been introduced to the more common credit card networks, but none has proven to help reduce credit card fraud so far. First, the cards themselves are being replaced with similar-looking tamper-resistant [[smart card]]s which are intended to make [[forgery]] more difficult. The majority of smart card (IC card) based credit cards comply with the [[EMV]] (Europay MasterCard Visa) standard. Second, an additional 3 or 4 digit [[card security code]] (CSC) is now present on the back of most cards, for use in [[card not present transaction]]s. Stakeholders at all levels in electronic payment have recognized the need to develop consistent global standards for security that account for and integrate both current and emerging security technologies. They have begun to address these needs through organisations such as PCI DSS and the [[Secure POS Vendor Alliance]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Secure POS Vendor Alliance is launched by Hypercom, Ingenico and VeriFone |url=http://www.ecommerce-journal.com/news/14854_secure_pos_vendor_alliance_is_launched_by_hypercom_ingenico_and_verifone |publisher=ECommerce Journal |year=2009 |postscript= |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426033905/http://www.ecommerce-journal.com/news/14854_secure_pos_vendor_alliance_is_launched_by_hypercom_ingenico_and_verifone |archivedate=26 April 2009  }}</ref>\n\n===Code 10===\nCode 10 calls are made when merchants are suspicious about accepting a credit card.\n\nThe operator then asks the merchant a series of YES or NO questions to find out whether the merchant is suspicious of the card or the cardholder.

It will then be listed as such on the debtor's credit bureau reports. ([[Equifax]], for instance, lists \"R9\" in the \"status\" column to denote a charge-off.)\n\nA charge-off is considered to be \"written off as uncollectible\". To banks, bad debts and fraud are part of the cost of doing business.\n\nHowever, the debt is still legally valid, and the creditor can attempt to collect the full amount for the time periods permitted under state law, which is usually three to seven years. This includes contacts from internal collections staff, or more likely, an outside [[collection agency]]. If the amount is large (generally over $1,500\u20132,000), there is the possibility of a lawsuit or [[arbitration]].\n\n====Fraud====\n{{Main|Credit card fraud}}\nIn relative numbers the values lost in bank card fraud are minor, calculated in 2006 at 7 cents per 100 dollars worth of transactions (7 [[basis point]]s).<ref>[http://issaasad.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/mercator-fraud-1208.pdf Credit Card Issuer Fraud Management, Report Highlights, December, 2008]</ref> In 2004, in the UK, the cost of fraud was over \u00a3500 million.<ref>[http://www.cardwatch.org.uk/media.asp?sectionid=4&pageid=109 Plastic fraud loss on UK-issued cards 2004/2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616211917/http://www.cardwatch.org.uk/media.asp?sectionid=4&pageid=109|date=16 June 2006}}. [[Cardwatch.org.uk]]. site retrieved 7 July 2006</ref> When a card is stolen, or an unauthorized duplicate made, most card issuers will refund some or all of the charges that the customer has received for things they did not buy. These refunds will, in some cases, be at the expense of the merchant, especially in mail order cases where the merchant cannot claim sight of the card. In several countries, merchants will lose the money if no ID card was asked for, therefore merchants usually require ID card in these countries. Credit card companies generally guarantee the merchant will be paid on legitimate transactions regardless of whether the consumer pays their credit card bill.\n\nMost banking services have their own credit card services that handle fraud cases and monitor for any possible attempt at fraud. Employees that are specialized in doing fraud monitoring and investigation are often placed in Risk Management, Fraud and Authorization, or [[Cards and Unsecured Business]]. Fraud monitoring emphasizes minimizing fraud losses while making an attempt to track down those responsible and contain the situation. [[Credit card fraud]] is a major white collar crime that has been around for many decades, even with the advent of the chip based card (EMV) that was put into practice in some countries to prevent cases such as these. Even with the implementation of such measures, credit card fraud continues to be a problem.\n\n====Interest expenses====\nBanks generally borrow the money they then lend to their customers. As they receive very low-interest loans from other firms, they may borrow as much as their customers require, while lending their capital to other borrowers at higher rates. If the card issuer charges 15% on money lent to users, and it costs 5% to borrow the money to lend, and the balance sits with the cardholder for a year, the issuer earns 10% on the loan. This 10% difference is the \"net interest spread\" and the 5% is the \"interest expense\".\n\n====Operating costs====\nThis is the [[operating cost|cost of running]] the credit card portfolio, including everything from paying the executives who run the company to printing the plastics, to mailing the statements, to running the computers that keep track of every cardholder's balance, to taking the many phone calls which cardholders place to their issuer, to protecting the customers from fraud rings. Depending on the issuer, marketing programs are also a significant portion of expenses.\n\n====Rewards====\n<!--  Commented out: [[File:CreditCard-AU-Qantas-Cobrands.jpg|right|thumb|[[Qantas Frequent Flyer]] co-branded credit cards]] -->\nMany credit card customers receive rewards, such as [[frequent flyer]] points, gift certificates, or [[Cashback reward program|cash back]] as an incentive to use the card. Rewards are generally tied to purchasing an item or service on the card, which may or may not include [[balance transfer]]s, [[Payday loan|cash advances]], or other special uses. Depending on the type of card, rewards will generally cost the issuer between 0.25% and 2.0% of the spread. Networks such as Visa or MasterCard have increased their fees to allow issuers to fund their rewards system. Some issuers discourage redemption by forcing the cardholder to call customer service for rewards. On their servicing website, redeeming awards is usually a feature that is very well hidden by the issuers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} With a fractured and competitive environment, rewards points cut dramatically into an issuer's bottom line, and rewards points and related incentives must be carefully managed to ensure a profitable [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} Unlike unused gift cards, in whose case the [[Breakage (accounting)|breakage]] in certain US states goes to the state's treasury, unredeemed credit card points are retained by the issuer.\n\n===Revenues===\n\n====Interchange fee====\n{{Main|Interchange fee}}\n\nIn addition to fees paid by the card holder, merchants must also pay [[interchange fee]]s to the card-issuing bank and the card association.<ref name=\"S-1\">[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000119312507242653/ds1.htm United States Securities and Exchange Commission FORM S-1], 9 November 2007.</ref><ref name=\"Tampa Tribune\">[http://www2.tbo.com/content/2008/feb/15/bz-debit-cards-cash-in-on-rewards-riches/ Debit Cards Cash In On Rewards Riches] ''Tampa Tribune'', 15 February 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228043408/http://www2.tbo.com/content/2008/feb/15/bz-debit-cards-cash-in-on-rewards-riches/ |date=28 February 2008 }}</ref> For a typical credit card issuer, interchange fee revenues may represent about a quarter of total revenues.<ref name=\"FRB\"/>\n\nThese fees are typically from 1 to 6 percent of each sale, but will vary not only from merchant to merchant (large merchants can negotiate lower rates<ref name=\"FRB\">[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/06-06/interchange.cfm The Interchange Debate: Issues and Economics] James Lyon, 19 January 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322001627/https://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/06-06/interchange.cfm |date=22 March 2008 }}</ref>), but also from card to card, with business cards and rewards cards generally costing the merchants more to process. The interchange fee that applies to a particular transaction is also affected by many other variables including: the type of merchant, the merchant's total card sales volume, the merchant's average transaction amount, whether the cards were physically present, how the information required for the transaction was received, the specific type of card, when the transaction was settled, and the authorized and settled transaction amounts. In some cases, merchants add a surcharge to the credit cards to cover the interchange fee, encouraging their customers to instead use [[cash]], [[debit card]]s, or even [[cheque]]s.\n\n====Interest on outstanding balances====\n[[Credit card interest|Interest]] charges vary widely from card issuer to card issuer. Often, there are \"teaser\" rates in effect for initial periods of time (as low as zero percent for, say, six months), whereas regular rates can be as high as 40 percent. In the U.S. there is no federal limit on the interest or late fees credit card issuers can charge; the interest rates are set by the states, with some states such as [[South Dakota]], having no ceiling on interest rates and fees, inviting some banks to establish their credit card operations there. Other states, for example [[Delaware]], have very weak [[usury|usury laws]]. The [[teaser rate]] no longer applies if the customer does not pay their bills on time, and is replaced by a penalty interest rate (for example, 23.99%) that applies retroactively.\n\n==Fees charged to customers==\nThe major '''credit card fees''' are for:\n*Cash advances and convenience cheques (often 3% of the amount)\n* Charges that result in exceeding the credit limit on the card (whether deliberately or by mistake), called over-limit fees\n* Exchange rate loading fees (sometimes these might not be reported on the customer's statement, even when applied).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creditchoices.co.uk/credit-card-charges-abroad.html|title=credit cards abroad|last=Gracia|first=Mike|date=9 May 2008|publisher=creditchoices.co.uk|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612170006/http://www.creditchoices.co.uk/credit-card-charges-abroad.html|archivedate=12 June 2008|url-status = dead|accessdate=9 May 2008}}\n</ref> The variation of exchange rates applied by different credit cards can be very substantial, as much as 10% according to a [[Lonely Planet]] report in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/tonywheeler/my_lists/why_we_cut_up_our_credit_cards/|title=Comparison of exchange rates using Visa and Diners Club cards in Bali|date=3 March 2010|publisher=Lonelyplanet.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711041436/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/tonywheeler/my_lists/why_we_cut_up_our_credit_cards/|archivedate=11 July 2011|url-status = dead|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref>\n* Late or overdue payments\n* Membership fees (annual or monthly), sometimes a percentage of the credit limit.\n*Returned cheque fees or payment processing fees (e.g. phone payment fee)\n* Transactions in a foreign currency (as much as 3% of the amount). A few financial institutions do not charge a fee for this.\n\nIn the U.S., the [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]] specifies that credit card companies must send cardholders a notice 45 days before they can increase or change certain fees. This includes annual fees, cash advance fees, and late fees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerinfo/wyntk_creditcardrules.htm|title=Federal Reserve Board: Credit Card Rules|publisher=U.S. Federal Reserve Board|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106014436/http://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerinfo/wyntk_creditcardrules.htm|archivedate=6 January 2014|url-status = dead|accessdate=27 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\nOne controversial area is the [[trailing interest]] issue. Trailing interest is the practice of charging interest on the entire bill no matter what percentage of it is paid. U.S. Senator [[Carl Levin]] raised the issue of millions of Americans affected by hidden fees, compounding interest and cryptic terms. Their woes were heard in a Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing which was chaired by Senator Levin, who said that he intends to keep the spotlight on credit card companies and that legislative action may be necessary to purge the industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/03/senate_credit_cards02.html|title=Credit Card Executives Tough Out Senate Hearing|author=Joseph S. Enoch|publisher=Consumeraffairs.com|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> In 2009, the C.A.R.D. Act was signed into law, enacting protections for many of the issues Levin had raised.\n\n====Hidden costs====\nIn the United Kingdom, merchants won the right through The Credit Cards (Price Discrimination) Order 1990<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1990/Uksi_19902159_en_1.htm|title=Statutory Instrument 1990 No. 2159: The Credit Cards (Price Discrimination) Order 1990|publisher=Opsi.gov.uk|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> to charge customers different prices according to the payment method; this was later removed by the EU's 2nd [[Payment Services Directive]].  As of 2007, the United Kingdom was one of the world's most credit card-intensive countries, with 2.4 credit cards per consumer, according to the [[APACS|UK Payments Administration Ltd]].<ref>[http://www.apacs.org.uk/resources_publications/card_facts_and_figures.html \"Plastic cards in the UK and how we used them in 2007\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225210810/http://www.apacs.org.uk/resources_publications/card_facts_and_figures.html|date=25 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States until 1984, federal law prohibited surcharges on card transactions. Although the federal [[Truth in Lending Act]] provisions that prohibited surcharges expired that year, a number of states have since enacted laws that continue to outlaw the practice; California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, Maine, New York, Oklahoma, and Texas have laws against surcharges. As of 2006, the United States probably had one of the world's highest if not the top ratio of credit cards per capita, with 984 million bank-issued Visa and MasterCard credit card and debit card accounts alone for an adult population of roughly 220 million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_S0101&-ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_|title=US Census: 2005\u20132007 American Community Survey 3-Year Estimates|author=American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau|publisher=Factfinder.census.gov|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200212055921/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_S0101&-ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_|archivedate=12 February 2020|url-status = dead|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> The credit card per U.S. capita ratio was nearly 4:1 as of 2003<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalscoreindex.com/ViewAllGraphs.aspx|title=Experian's National Score Index|publisher=Nationalscoreindex.com|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> and as high as 5:1 as of 2006.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4207|title=Prime Numbers: The Plastic Revolution|date=19 February 2008|magazine=Foreign Policy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115110602/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4207|archivedate=15 January 2009|url-status = dead|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Over-limit charges==\n===United Kingdom===\nConsumers who keep their account in good order by always staying within their credit limit, and always making at least the minimum monthly payment will see interest as the biggest expense from their card provider. Those who are not so careful and regularly surpass their credit limit or are late in making payments are exposed to multiple charges that were typically as high as \u00a325\u201335<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/credit-and-loans/article.html?in_article_id=407583&in_page_id=9 |title=This is Money Card charges to be slashed |publisher=Thisismoney.co.uk |date=13 March 2006 |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> until a ruling from the [[Office of Fair Trading]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2006/68-06 |title=Current credit card default charges unfair |publisher=Oft.gov.uk |accessdate=28 July 2011 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327193555/http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2006/68-06 |archivedate=27 March 2010 }}</ref> that they would presume charges over \u00a312 to be unfair which led the majority of card providers to reduce their fees to \u00a312.\n\nThe higher fees originally charged were claimed to be designed to recoup the card operator's overall business costs and to try to ensure that the credit card business as a whole generated a profit, rather than simply recovering the cost to the provider of the limit breach, which has been estimated as typically between \u00a33\u2013\u00a34. Profiting from a customer's mistakes is arguably not permitted under UK common law, if the charges constitute penalties for breach of contract, or under the [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]].\n\nSubsequent rulings in respect of personal current accounts suggest that the argument that these charges are penalties for breach of contract is weak, and given the [[Office of Fair Trading]]'s ruling it seems unlikely that any further test case will take place.\n\nWhilst the law remains in the balance, many consumers have made claims against their credit card providers for the charges that they have incurred, plus interest that they would have earned had the money not been deducted from their account. It is likely that claims for amounts charged in excess of \u00a312 will succeed, but claims for charges at the OFT's \u00a312 threshold level are more contentious.\n\n===United States===\nThe [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]] requires that consumers opt into over-limit charges. Some card issuers have therefore commenced solicitations requesting customers to opt into over-limit fees, presenting this as a benefit as it may avoid the possibility of a future transaction being declined. Other issuers have simply discontinued the practice of charging over-limit fees. Whether a customer opts into the over-limit fee or not, banks will in practice have discretion as to whether they choose to authorize transactions above the credit limit or not. Of course, any approved over limit transactions will only result in an over-limit fee for those customers who have opted into the fee. This legislation took effect on 22 February 2010. Following this Act, the companies are now required by law to show on a customer's bills how long it would take them to pay off the balance.\n\n==Neutral consumer resources==\n\n===Canada===\nThe Government of Canada maintains a database of the fees, features, interest rates and reward programs of nearly 200 credit cards available in Canada. This database is updated on a quarterly basis with information supplied by the credit card issuing companies. Information in the database is published every quarter on the website of the [[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]] (FCAC).\n\nInformation in the database is published in two formats. It is available in [[PDF]] comparison tables that break down the information according to type of credit card, allowing the reader to compare the features of, for example, all the student credit cards in the database.\n\nThe database also feeds into an interactive tool on the FCAC website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itools-ioutils.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/CCS-SCC/CCSearchCriteria.aspx?lang=eng |title=FCAC - Interactive Tools - Credit Card Selector Tool |work=FCAC |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221014248/http://itools-ioutils.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/CCS-SCC/CCSearchCriteria.aspx?lang=eng |archivedate=21 December 2013 }}</ref> The interactive tool uses several interview-type questions to build a profile of the user's credit card usage habits and needs, eliminating unsuitable choices based on the profile, so that the user is presented with a small number of credit cards and the ability to carry out detailed comparisons of features, reward programs, interest rates, etc.\n\n==Credit cards in ATMs==\n[[File:ATM 750x1300.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|Acceptance mark at an [[automated teller machine]] ]]\nMany credit cards can be used in an [[Automatic teller machine|ATM]] to withdraw money against the credit limit extended to the card, but many card issuers charge interest on cash advances before they do so on purchases. The interest on cash advances is commonly charged from the date the withdrawal is made, rather than the monthly billing date. Many card issuers levy a commission for cash withdrawals, even if the ATM belongs to the same bank as the card issuer. Merchants do not offer [[debit card cashback|cashback]] on credit card transactions because they would pay a percentage commission of the additional cash amount to their bank or merchant services provider, thereby making it uneconomical. Discover is a notable exception to the above. A customer with a Discover card may get up to $120 cash back if the merchant allows it. This amount is simply added to the card holder's cost of the transaction and no extra fees are charged as the transaction is not considered a cash advance.\n\nMany credit card companies will also, when applying payments to a card, do so, for the matter at hand, at the end of a billing cycle, and apply those payments to everything before cash advances. For this reason, many consumers have large cash balances, which have no grace period and incur interest at a rate that is (usually) higher than the purchase rate, and will carry those balances for years, even if they pay off their statement balance each month.\n\n===Acceptance mark===\nAn ''acceptance mark'' is a logo or design that indicates which card schemes an ATM or [[merchant]] accepts. Common uses include decals and signs at merchant locations or in merchant advertisements. The purpose of the mark is to provide the card holder with information where his or her card can be used. An acceptance mark differs from the a card product name (such as [[Centurion Card|American Express Black card]], [[Eurocard (payment card)|Eurocard]]), as it shows the card scheme (group of cards) accepted. An acceptance mark however corresponds to the card scheme mark shown on a card.\n\nAn acceptance mark is however not an absolute guarantee that all cards belonging to a given card scheme will be accepted. On occasion cards issued in a foreign country may not be accepted by a merchant or ATM due to contractual or legal restrictions.\n\n==Credit cards as funding for entrepreneurs==\nCredit cards are a risky way for [[entrepreneur]]s to acquire capital for their start ups when more conventional financing is unavailable. [[Len Bosack]] and [[Sandy Lerner]] used personal credit cards<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pdp10.nocrew.org/docs/cisco.html |title=A start-up's true tale |publisher=Pdp10.nocrew.org |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> to start [[Cisco Systems]]. [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]]'s start up of [[Google]] was financed by credit cards to buy the necessary computers and office equipment, more specifically \"a terabyte of [[hard disks]]\".<ref>[http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/history.html Google About Page under 1998] page retrieved 30 May 2007.{{Failed verification|date=February 2011}}</ref> Similarly, filmmaker [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]] financed part of ''[[Hollywood Shuffle]]'' using credit cards.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093200/trivia Hollywood Shuffle trivia at IMDB] page retrieved 7 July 2006</ref> Director [[Kevin Smith]] funded ''[[Clerks]]'' in part by maxing out several credit cards.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kevin Smith: how we made Clerks |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/07/how-we-made-clerks-kevin-smith |access-date=January 28, 2020}}</ref> Actor [[Richard Hatch (actor)|Richard Hatch]] also financed his production of ''[[Battlestar Galactica: The Second Coming]]'' partly through his credit cards.

A credit card also differs from a [[cash card]], which can be used like currency by the owner of the card. A credit card differs from a charge card also in that a credit card typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller and is reimbursed by the buyer, whereas a charge card simply defers payment by the buyer until a later date.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Technical specifications==\nThe size of most credit cards is {{convert|85.60|\u00d7|53.98|mm|in|frac=8}} and rounded corners with a radius of {{convert|2.88|\u2013|3.48|mm|in|frac=80}}<!-- =1/8\"\u00b110% --><ref>ISO/IEC 7810:2003, clause 5, Dimensions of card</ref> conforming to the [[ISO/IEC 7810#ID-1|ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1]] standard, the same size as [[ATM card]]s and other [[payment card]]s, such as [[debit card]]s.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31432 ISO/IEC 7810:2003 ''Identification cards \u2014 Physical characteristics'']</ref>\n\nCredit cards have a printed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mastercard.com/ca/merchant/en/solutions/unembossed.html|title=For Merchants - MasterCard Unembossed|work=MasterCard}}</ref> or embossed [[bank card number]] complying with the [[ISO/IEC 7812]] numbering standard. The card number's ''prefix'', called the [[Bank Identification Number]] (known in the industry as a BIN<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bank-identification-number.asp |title=Bank Identification Number (BIN)}}</ref>), is the sequence of digits at the beginning of the number that determine the bank to which a credit card number belongs. This is the first six digits for MasterCard and Visa cards. The next nine digits are the individual account number, and the final digit is a validity check code.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nBoth of these standards are maintained and further developed by [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17/WG 1]]. Credit cards have a [[Magnetic stripe card|magnetic stripe]] conforming to the [[ISO/IEC 7813]]. Many modern credit cards have a [[EMV|computer chip]] embedded in them as a security feature.\n\nIn addition to the main credit card number, credit cards also carry issue and expiration dates (given to the nearest month), as well as extra codes such as issue numbers and [[Card Security Code|security codes]]. Not all credit cards have the same sets of extra codes nor do they use the same number of digits.\n\nCredit card numbers were originally embossed to allow easy transfer of the number to charge slips. With the decline of paper slips, some credit cards are no longer embossed and in fact the card number is no longer in the front.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dunaway|first1=Jaime|title=Why Are Credit Card Numbers on the Back Now?|url=https://slate.com/business/2018/04/why-are-credit-card-numbers-on-the-back-of-the-card-now.html|accessdate=18 April 2018|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=18 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Edward Bellamy's ''Looking Backward''===\nThe concept of using a card for purchases was described in 1887 by [[Edward Bellamy]] in his utopian novel ''[[Looking Backward]]''. Bellamy used the term ''credit card'' eleven times in this novel, although this referred to a card for spending a [[citizen's dividend]] from the government, rather than borrowing,<ref>(Chapters 9, 10, 11, 13, 25 and 26) and three times (Chapters 4, 8 and 19) in its sequel, ''Equality''</ref> making it more similar to a [[debit card]].\n\n===Charge coins, medals, and so on===\nCharge coins and other similar items were used from the late 19th century to the 1930s. They came in various shapes and sizes; with materials made out of [[celluloid]] (an early type of plastic), copper, aluminum, steel, and other types of whitish metals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-collectible-coins-charge-plate-1264.php|title=Life before plastic: Historical look at credit card materials|work=creditcards.com}}</ref> Each charge coin usually had a little hole, enabling it to be put in a key ring, like a key. These charge coins were usually given to customers who had charge accounts in department stores, hotels, and so on. A charge coin usually had the charge account number along with the merchant's name and logo.\n\nThe charge coin offered a simple and fast way to copy a charge account number to the sales slip, by imprinting the coin onto the sales slip. This sped the process of copying, previously done by [[handwriting]]. It also reduced the number of errors, by having a standardized form of numbers on the sales slip, instead of various kinds of handwriting style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shoppingdaysinretroboston.blogspot.com/2013/03/charge-coins-come-to-retro-boston.html|title=Shopping Days In Retro Boston|author=Charles Boston|work=shoppingdaysinretroboston.blogspot.com}}</ref>\n\nBecause the customer's name was not on the charge coin, almost anyone could use it. This sometimes led to a case of mistaken identity, either accidentally or intentionally, by acting on behalf of the charge account owner or out of malice to defraud both the charge account owner and the merchant. Beginning in the 1930s, merchants started to move from charge coins to the newer Charga-Plate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://departmentstoremuseum.blogspot.com/2010/11/charge-cards.html|title=The Department Store Museum: Charge Cards|work=departmentstoremuseum.blogspot.com}}</ref>\n\n===Early charge cards===\n====Charga-Plate====\nThe Charga-Plate, developed in 1928, was an early predecessor of the credit card and was used in the U.S. from the 1930s to the late 1950s. It was a {{convert|2+1/2|\u00d7|1+1/4|in|mm|adj=on}} rectangle of sheet metal related to [[Addressograph]] and military [[Dog tag (identifier)|dog tag]] systems. It was embossed with the customer's name, city, and state<!-- Yes, no street address -->. It held a small paper card on its back for a signature. In recording a purchase, the plate was laid into a recess in the imprinter, with a paper \"charge slip\" positioned on top of it. The record of the transaction included an impression of the embossed information, made by the imprinter pressing an [[typewriter ribbon|inked ribbon]] against the charge slip.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cultureandcommunication.org/deadmedia/index.php/Credit_Card_Imprinter |title=Credit card imprinter |publisher=Cultureandcommunication.org |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> Charga-Plate was a trademark of Farrington Manufacturing Co.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/215/668/55263/|title=Hartford Charga-plate Associates, Incorporated, Plaintiff-appellant, v.

In some cases, the plates were kept in the issuing store rather than held by customers. When an authorized user made a purchase, a clerk retrieved the plate from the store's files and then processed the purchase. Charga-Plates speeded back-office bookkeeping and reduced copying errors that were done manually in paper ledgers in each store.\n\n===={{anchor|Air Travel Card}}Air Travel Card====\nIn 1934, [[American Airlines]] and the [[Air Transport Association]] simplified the process even more with the advent of the [[Universal Air Travel Plan|Air Travel Card]].<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The Travel Card that gave \"CREDIT\" to the public |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXIHl--RuqkC&pg=PA11 |magazine=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date=June 1953 |volume=52 |issue=6 |page=11 |access-date=11 November 2018}}</ref> They created a numbering scheme that identified the issuer of the card as well as the customer account. This is the reason the modern [[Universal Air Travel Plan|UATP]] cards still start with the number 1. With an Air Travel Card, passengers could \"buy now, and pay later\" for a ticket against their credit and receive a fifteen percent discount at any of the accepting airlines. By the 1940s, all of the major U.S. airlines offered Air Travel Cards that could be used on 17 different airlines. By 1941, about half of the airlines' revenues came through the Air Travel Card agreement. The airlines had also started offering installment plans to lure new travelers into the air. In October 1948, the Air Travel Card became the first internationally valid charge card within all members of the [[International Air Transport Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creditcardprocessingspace.com/history-of-the-credit-card/ |title=History Of The Credit Card |publisher=www.creditcardprocessingspace.com |accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Early general purpose charge cards: Diners Club, Carte Blanche, and American Express====\nThe concept of customers paying different merchants using the same card was expanded in 1950 by Ralph Schneider and [[Frank X. McNamara|Frank McNamara]], founders of [[Diners Club]], to consolidate multiple cards. The Diners Club, which was created partially through a merger with Dine and Sign, produced the first \"general purpose\" [[charge card]] and required the entire bill to be paid with each statement. That was followed by [[Carte Blanche (credit card)#Carte Blanche|Carte Blanche]] and in 1958 by [[American Express]] which created a worldwide credit card network (although these were initially charge cards that later acquired credit card features).\n\n===BankAmericard and Master Charge===\n[[File:Mastercharge_and_Bankamericard.jpg|thumb|right|Metal signs at a plant nursery in Los Angeles County, California marketing Mastercharge and Bankamericard]]\nUntil 1958, no one had been able to successfully establish a ''revolving credit'' financial system in which a card issued by a third-party bank was being generally accepted by a large number of merchants, as opposed to merchant-issued revolving cards accepted by only a few merchants. There had been a dozen attempts by small American banks, but none of them were able to last very long. In September 1958, [[Bank of America]] launched the ''BankAmericard'' in [[Fresno, California]], which would become the first successful recognizably modern credit card. This card succeeded where others failed by breaking the chicken-and-egg cycle in which consumers did not want to use a card that few merchants would accept and merchants did not want to accept a card that few consumers used. Bank of America chose Fresno because 45% of its residents used the bank, and by sending a card to 60,000 Fresno residents at once, the bank was able to convince merchants to accept the card.<ref name=pricenomics>{{cite web|last1=Mayyasi|first1=Alex|title=How Credit Cards Tax America|url=http://priceonomics.com/how-credit-cards-tax-america/|website=Pricenomics}}</ref> It was eventually licensed to other banks around the United States and then around the world, and in 1976, all BankAmericard licensees united themselves under the common brand [[Visa Inc.|Visa]]. In 1966, the ancestor of [[MasterCard]] was born when a group of banks established Master Charge to compete with BankAmericard; it received a significant boost when [[Citibank]] merged its own [[Everything Card]], launched in 1967, into Master Charge in 1969.\n\nEarly credit cards in the U.S., of which BankAmericard was the most prominent example, were mass-produced and mass mailed unsolicited to bank customers who were thought to be good credit risks. They have been mailed off to unemployable people, drunks, narcotics addicts and to compulsive debtors, a process President Johnson's Special Assistant [[Betty Furness]] found very like \"giving sugar to [[diabetics]]\".<ref>{{cite journal | author = O'Neill, Paul | title = A Little Gift from Your Friendly Banker | journal = [[Life (magazine)|LIFE]] | date = 27 April 1970}}</ref> These mass mailings were known as \"drops\" in banking terminology, and were outlawed in 1970 due to the financial chaos they caused. However, by the time the law came into effect, approximately 100 million credit cards had been dropped into the U.S. population. After 1970, only credit card applications could be sent unsolicited in mass mailings.\n\nBefore the computerization of credit card systems in America, using a credit card to pay at a merchant was significantly more complicated than it is today. Each time a consumer wanted to use a credit card, the merchant would have to call their bank, who in turn had to call the credit card company, which then had to have an employee manually look up the customer's name and credit balance. This system was computerized in 1973 under the leadership of [[Dee Hock]], the first CEO of Visa, allowing transaction time to decrease substantially to less than one minute.<ref name=\"pricenomics\" />  However, until always-connected [[payment terminal]]s became ubiquitous at the beginning of the 21st century, it was common for a merchant to accept a charge, especially below a threshold value or from a known and trusted customer, without verifying it by phone.  Books with lists of stolen card numbers were distributed to merchants who were supposed in any case to check cards against the list before accepting them, as well as verifying the signature on the charge slip against that on the card.   Merchants who failed to take the time to follow the proper verification procedures were liable for fraudulent charges, but because of the cumbersome nature of the procedures, merchants would often simply skip some or all of them and assume the risk for smaller transactions.\n\n===Development outside North America===\nThe fractured nature of the U.S. banking system under the [[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]] meant that credit cards became an effective way for those who were traveling around the country to move their credit to places where they could not directly use their banking facilities. There are now countless variations on the basic concept of revolving credit for individuals (as issued by banks and honored by a network of financial institutions), including organization-branded credit cards, corporate-user credit cards, store cards and so on.\n\nIn 1966, [[Barclaycard]] in the [[United Kingdom]] launched the first credit card outside the United States.\n\nAlthough credit cards reached very high adoption levels in the US, Canada and the UK during the latter 20th century, many cultures were more cash-oriented or developed alternative forms of cashless payments, such as [[Carte Bleue|Carte bleue]] or the [[Eurocard (payment card)|Eurocard]] (Germany, France, Switzerland, and others). In these places, adoption of credit cards was initially much slower. Due to strict regulations regarding bank overdrafts, some countries, France in particular, were much quicker to develop and adopt chip-based credit cards which are seen as major anti-fraud credit devices. [[Debit card]]s and [[online banking]] (using either [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]s or PCs{{clarify|date=August 2015}}) are used more widely than credit cards in some countries. It took until the 1990s to reach anything like the percentage market penetration levels achieved in the US, Canada, and UK. In some countries, acceptance still remains low as the use of a credit card system depends on the banking system of each country; while in others, a country sometimes had to develop its own credit card network, e.g. UK's Barclaycard and [[Australia]]'s [[Bankcard]]. [[Japan]] remains a very cash-oriented society, with credit card adoption being limited mainly to the largest of merchants; although stored value cards (such as [[telephone cards]]) are used as [[Telephone token|alternative currencies]], the trend is toward [[RFID]]-based systems inside cards, cellphones, and other objects.\n\n===Vintage, old, and unique credit cards as collectibles===\n[[File:Credit card receipt - old style.jpg|right|thumb|Receipt from 1997 - card physically swiped and information imprinted on the receipt]]\nThe design of the credit card itself has become a major selling point in recent years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-latest-american-status-symbol-metal-credit-cards-2017-04-25|title=Metal credit cards: The latest American status symbol|last=LaMagna|first=Maria|work=MarketWatch|access-date=7 March 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The value of the card to the issuer is often related to the customer's usage of the card, or to the customer's financial worth. This has led to the rise of Co-Brand and [[Affinity credit card|Affinity]] cards, where the card design is related to the \"affinity\" (a university or professional society, for example) leading to higher card usage. In most cases a percentage of the value of the card is returned to the affinity group.\n\nA growing field of [[numismatics]] (study of money), or more specifically [[exonumia]] (study of money-like objects), credit card collectors seek to collect various embodiments of credit from the now familiar plastic cards to older paper merchant cards, and even [[metal]] tokens that were accepted as merchant credit cards. Early credit cards were made of [[celluloid]] plastic, then metal and [[fiber]], then paper, and are now mostly [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) plastic.\nHowever the chip part of credit cards is not made from plastic but from metals.\n\n==Usage==\nA credit card issuing company, such as a bank or credit union, enters into agreements with merchants for them to accept their credit cards. Merchants often advertise which cards they accept by displaying [[acceptance mark]]s \u2013 generally derived from logos \u2013 or this may be communicated in signage in the establishment or in company material (e.g., a restaurant's menu may indicate which credit cards are accepted). Merchants may also communicate this orally, as in \"We take (brands X, Y, and Z)\" or \"We don't take credit cards\".\n\n[[File:Credit card logos (2015-12-1816-27-350044).jpg|thumbnail|upright|right|[[Visa credit card|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], [[American Express]] are card-issuing entities that set transaction terms for merchants, card-issuing banks, and acquiring banks.]]\nThe credit card issuer issues a credit card to a customer at the time or after an account has been approved by the credit provider, which need not be the same entity as the card issuer. The cardholders can then use it to make purchases at merchants accepting that card. When a purchase is made, the cardholder agrees to pay the card issuer. The cardholder indicates consent to pay by signing a [[receipt]] with a record of the card details and indicating the amount to be paid or by entering a [[personal identification number]] (PIN). Also, many merchants now accept verbal authorizations via telephone and electronic authorization using the Internet, known as a [[card not present transaction]] (CNP).\n\n[[Electronics|Electronic]] [[Credit card verification|verification]] systems allow merchants to verify in a few seconds that the card is valid and the cardholder has sufficient credit to cover the purchase, allowing the verification to happen at time of purchase. The verification is performed using a [[credit card terminal|credit card payment terminal]] or [[point of sale|point-of-sale]] (POS) system with a communications link to the merchant's acquiring bank. Data from the card is obtained from a [[Magnetic stripe card|magnetic stripe]] or [[Smart card|chip]] on the card; the latter system is called [[Chip and PIN]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], and is implemented as an [[EMV]] card.\n\nFor [[card not present transaction]]s where the card is not shown (e.g., [[Electronic commerce|e-commerce]], [[mail order]], and telephone sales), merchants additionally verify that the customer is in physical possession of the card and is the authorized user by asking for additional information such as the [[Card Security Code|security code]] printed on the back of the card, date of expiry, and billing address.\n\nEach month, the cardholder is sent a statement indicating the purchases made with the card, any outstanding fees, the total amount owed and the minimum payment due. In the US, after receiving the statement, the cardholder may dispute any charges that he or she thinks are incorrect (see {{USC|15|1643}}, which limits cardholder liability for unauthorized use of a credit card to $50). The [[Fair Credit Billing Act]] gives details of the U.S. regulations.\n\nMany banks now also offer the option of electronic statements, either in lieu of or in addition to physical statements, which can be viewed at any time by the cardholder via the issuer's [[online banking]] website. Notification of the availability of a new statement is generally sent to the cardholder's email address. If the card issuer has chosen to allow it, the cardholder may have other options for payment besides a physical check, such as an electronic transfer of funds from a checking account. Depending on the issuer, the cardholder may also be able to make multiple payments during a single statement period, possibly enabling him or her to utilize the credit limit on the card several times.\n\n===Minimum payment===\nThe cardholder must pay a defined minimum portion of the amount owed by a due date, or may choose to pay a higher amount. The credit issuer charges [[interest]] on the unpaid balance if the billed amount is not paid in full (typically at a much higher rate than most other forms of debt). In addition, if the cardholder fails to make at least the minimum payment by the due date, the issuer may impose a [[late fee]] or other penalties. To help mitigate this, some financial institutions can arrange for automatic payments to be deducted from the cardholder's bank account, thus avoiding such penalties altogether, as long as the cardholder has sufficient funds.\n\nIn cases where the minimum payment is less than the finance charges and fees assessed during the billing cycle, the outstanding balance will increase in what is called [[negative amortization]]. This practice tends to increase credit risk and mask the lender's portfolio quality, and consequently has been banned in the U.S. since 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/bcreg/2003/20030108/attachment.pdf|title=Credit Card Lending}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/minimum-credit-card-payments-1267.php|title=Understanding how credit card minimum payments are set}}</ref>\n\n===Advertising, solicitation, application and approval===\nCredit card advertising regulations in the U.S. include the [[Schumer box]] disclosure requirements. A large fraction of junk mail consists of credit card offers created from lists provided by the major [[credit reporting agency|credit reporting agencies]]. In the United States, the three major U.S. credit bureaus ([[Equifax]], [[TransUnion]] and [[Experian]]) allow consumers to opt out from related credit card solicitation offers via its [[Optoutprescreen.com|Opt Out Pre Screen]] program.\n\n===Interest charges===\nCredit card issuers usually waive interest charges if the balance is paid in full each month, but typically will charge full interest on the entire outstanding balance from the date of each purchase if the total balance is not paid.\n\nFor example, if a user had a $1,000 transaction and repaid it in full within this grace period, there would be no interest charged. If, however, even $1.00 of the total amount remained unpaid, interest would be charged on the $1,000 from the date of purchase until the payment is received. The precise manner in which interest is charged is usually detailed in a cardholder agreement which may be summarized on the back of the monthly statement. The general calculation formula most financial institutions use to determine the amount of interest to be charged is (APR/100 x ADB)/365 x number of days revolved. Take the [[annual percentage rate]] (APR) and divide by 100 then multiply to the amount of the average daily balance (ADB).  Divide the result by 365 and then take this total and multiply by the total number of days the amount revolved before payment was made on the account. Financial institutions refer to interest charged back to the original time of the transaction and up to the time a payment was made, if not in full, as a residual retail finance charge (RRFC). Thus after an amount has revolved and a payment has been made, the user of the card will still receive interest charges on their statement after paying the next statement in full (in fact the statement may only have a charge for interest that collected up until the date the full balance was paid, i.e. when the balance stopped revolving).\n\nThe credit card may simply serve as a form of [[revolving credit]], or it may become a complicated financial instrument with multiple balance segments each at a different interest rate, possibly with a single umbrella credit limit, or with separate credit limits applicable to the various balance segments. Usually this compartmentalization is the result of special incentive offers from the issuing bank, to encourage [[balance transfer]]s from cards of other issuers. In the event that several interest rates apply to various balance segments, payment allocation is generally at the discretion of the issuing bank, and payments will therefore usually be allocated towards the lowest rate balances until paid in full before any money is paid towards higher rate balances. [[Interest rate]]s can vary considerably from card to card, and the interest rate on a particular card may jump dramatically if the card user is late with a payment on that card ''or any other credit instrument'', or even if the issuing bank decides to raise its revenue.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Grace period===\nA credit card's grace period is the time the cardholder has to pay the balance before interest is assessed on the outstanding balance. Grace periods may vary, but usually range from 20 to 55 days depending on the type of credit card and the issuing bank. Some policies allow for reinstatement after certain conditions are met.\n\nUsually, if a cardholder is late paying the balance, finance charges will be calculated and the grace period does not apply. Finance charges incurred depend on the grace period and balance; with most credit cards there is no grace period if there is any outstanding balance from the previous billing cycle or statement (i.e. interest is applied on both the previous balance and new transactions). However, there are some credit cards that will only apply finance charge on the previous or old balance, excluding new transactions.\n\n===Parties involved===\n* Cardholder: The holder of the card used to make a purchase; the [[consumer]].\n* Card-issuing bank: The financial institution or other organization that issued the credit card to the cardholder. This bank bills the consumer for repayment and bears the risk that the card is used fraudulently. American Express and Discover were previously the only card-issuing banks for their respective brands, but as of 2007, this is no longer the case. Cards issued by banks to cardholders in a different country are known as [[offshore credit card]]s.\n* Merchant: The individual or business accepting credit card payments for products or services sold to the cardholder.\n* [[Acquiring bank]]: The financial institution accepting payment for the products or services on behalf of the merchant.\n* [[Independent sales organization]]: Re-sellers (to merchants) of the services of the acquiring bank.\n* [[Merchant account]]: This could refer to the acquiring bank or the independent sales organization, but in general is the organization that the merchant deals with.\n* [[Card association]]: An association of card-issuing banks such as [[Discover Card|Discover]], [[Visa (company)|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], [[American Express]], etc. that set transaction terms for merchants, card-issuing banks, and acquiring banks.\n* Transaction network: The system that implements the mechanics of the electronic transactions. May be operated by an independent company, and one company may operate multiple networks.\n* Affinity partner: Some institutions lend their names to an issuer to attract customers that have a strong relationship with that institution, and get paid a fee or a percentage of the balance for each card issued using their name. Examples of typical affinity partners are sports teams, universities, charities, professional organizations, and major retailers.\n* Insurance providers: Insurers underwriting various insurance protections offered as credit card perks, for example, Car Rental Insurance, Purchase Security, Hotel Burglary Insurance, Travel Medical Protection etc.\n\nThe flow of information and money between these parties \u2014 always through the card associations \u2014 is known as the interchange, and it consists of a few steps.\n\n===Transaction steps===\n* '''[[Authorization hold|Authorization]]''': The cardholder presents the card as payment to the merchant and the merchant submits the transaction to the acquirer (acquiring bank). The acquirer verifies the credit card number, the transaction type and the amount with the issuer (card-issuing bank) and reserves that amount of the cardholder's credit limit for the merchant. An authorization will generate an approval code, which the merchant stores with the transaction.\n* '''Batching''': Authorized transactions are stored in \"batches\", which are sent to the acquirer. Batches are typically submitted once per day at the end of the business day. If a transaction is not submitted in the batch, the authorization will stay valid for a period determined by the issuer, after which the held amount will be returned to the cardholder's available credit (see [[authorization hold]]). Some transactions may be submitted in the batch without prior authorizations; these are either transactions falling under the merchant's [[floor limit]] or ones where the authorization was unsuccessful but the merchant still attempts to force the transaction through. (Such may be the case when the cardholder is not present but owes the merchant additional money, such as extending a hotel stay or car rental.)\n* '''Clearing and Settlement''': The acquirer sends the batch transactions through the credit card association, which debits the issuers for payment and credits the acquirer. Essentially, the issuer pays the acquirer for the transaction.\n* '''Funding''': Once the acquirer has been paid, the acquirer pays the merchant. The merchant receives the amount totaling the funds in the batch minus either the \"discount rate\", \"mid-qualified rate\", or \"non-qualified rate\" which are tiers of fees the merchant pays the acquirer for processing the transactions.\n* '''Chargebacks''': A [[chargeback]] is an event in which money in a merchant account is held due to a dispute relating to the transaction. Chargebacks are typically initiated by the cardholder. In the event of a chargeback, the issuer returns the transaction to the acquirer for resolution. The acquirer then forwards the chargeback to the merchant, who must either accept the chargeback or contest it.\n\n=== Credit card register ===\nA credit card register is a transaction register used to ensure the increasing balance owed from using a credit card is enough below the credit limit to deal with authorization holds and payments not yet received by the bank and to easily look up past transactions for reconciliation and budgeting.\n\nThe register is a personal record of banking transactions used for credit card purchases as they affect funds in the bank account or the available credit. In addition to check number and so forth the code column indicates the credit card. The balance column shows available funds after purchases.  When the credit card payment is made the balance already reflects the funds were spent. In a credit card's entry, the deposit column shows the available credit and the payment column shows total owed, their sum being equal to the credit limit.\n\nEach check written, debit card transaction, cash withdrawal, and credit card charge is entered manually into the paper register daily or several times per week.<ref>Little, Ken. 2007.

Credit cards are accepted in larger establishments in almost all countries, and are available with a variety of credit limits, repayment arrangements. Some have added perks (such as insurance protection, [[Loyalty program|rewards schemes]] in which points earned by purchasing goods with the card can be redeemed for further [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] or [[Cashback reward program|cashback]]).\n\n===Consumers' limited liability===\nSome countries, such as the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[France]], limit the amount for which a consumer can be held [[Legal liability|liable]] in the event of fraudulent transactions with a lost or stolen credit card.\n\n==Specialized types==\n\n===Business credit cards===\n{{See also|Stored-value card}}\nBusiness credit cards are specialized credit cards issued in the name of a registered business, and typically they can only be used for business purposes. Their use has grown in recent decades. In 1998, for instance, 37% of small businesses reported using a business credit card; by 2009, this number had grown to 64%.<ref name=FedReport>{{cite web|title=Report to the Congress on the Use of Credit Cards by Small Businesses and the Credit Card Market for Small Businesses|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/conferences/sbc_smallbusinesscredit.pdf|website=Federal Reserve|publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System|accessdate=4 May 2015|date=May 2010}}</ref>\n\nBusiness credit cards offer a number of features specific to businesses. They frequently offer special rewards in areas such as shipping, office supplies, travel, and business technology. Most issuers use the applicant's personal [[credit score]] when evaluating these applications. In addition, income from a variety of sources may be used to qualify, which means these cards may be available to businesses that are newly established.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.allbusiness.com/5-business-credit-card-myths-can-cost-business-109526-1.html|title=5 Business Credit Card Myths That Can Cost Your Business {{!}} AllBusiness.com|date=21 December 2016|work=AllBusiness.com|access-date=10 April 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> In addition, most major issuers of these cards do not report account activity to the owner's personal credit unless there is a default.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} This may have the effect of protecting the owner's personal credit from the activity of the business.\n\nBusiness credit cards are offered by almost all major card issuers\u2014like American Express, Visa, and MasterCard in addition to local banks and credit unions. Charge cards for businesses, however, are currently only offered by American Express.\n\n===Secured credit cards===\nA secured credit card is a type of credit card secured by a [[deposit account]] owned by the cardholder. Typically, the cardholder must deposit between 100% and 200% of the total amount of credit desired. Thus if the cardholder puts down $1,000, they will be given credit in the range of $500\u20131,000. In some cases, credit card issuers will offer incentives even on their secured card portfolios. In these cases, the deposit required may be significantly less than the required credit limit, and can be as low as 10% of the desired credit limit. This deposit is held in a special [[savings deposit|savings account]]. Credit card issuers offer this because they have noticed that delinquencies were notably reduced when the customer perceives something to lose if the balance is not repaid.\n\nThe cardholder of a secured credit card is still expected to make regular payments, as with a regular credit card, but should they default on a payment, the card issuer has the option of recovering the cost of the purchases paid to the merchants out of the deposit. The advantage of the secured card for an individual with negative or no credit history is that most companies report regularly to the major credit bureaus. This allows building a positive credit history.\n\nAlthough the deposit is in the hands of the credit card issuer as security in the event of default by the consumer, the deposit will not be debited simply for missing one or two payments. Usually the deposit is only used as an offset when the account is closed, either at the request of the customer or due to severe delinquency (150 to 180 days). This means that an account which is less than 150 days delinquent will continue to accrue interest and fees, and could result in a balance which is much higher than the actual credit limit on the card. In these cases the total debt may far exceed the original deposit and the cardholder not only forfeits their deposit but is left with an additional debt.\n\nMost of these conditions are usually described in a cardholder agreement which the cardholder signs when their account is opened.\n\nSecured credit cards are an option to allow a person with a poor [[credit history]] or no credit history to have a credit card which might not otherwise be available. They are often offered as a means of rebuilding one's credit. Fees and service charges for secured credit cards often exceed those charged for ordinary non-secured credit cards. For people in certain situations, (for example, after charging off on other credit cards, or people with a long history of delinquency on various forms of debt), secured cards are almost always more expensive than unsecured credit cards.\n\nSometimes a credit card will be secured by [[home equity|the equity in the borrower's home]].\n\n===Prepaid cards===\n{{See also|Stored-value card}}\nA \"prepaid credit card\" is not a true credit card,<ref name=\"fcac\"/> since no credit is offered by the card issuer: the cardholder spends money which has been \"stored\" via a prior deposit by the cardholder or someone else, such as a parent or employer. However, it carries a credit-card brand (such as [[Discover Card|Discover]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], [[American Express]], or [[Japan Credit Bureau|JCB]]) and can be used in similar ways just as though it were a credit card.<ref name=\"fcac\"/> Unlike debit cards, prepaid credit cards generally do not require a PIN. An exception are prepaid credit cards with an [[EMV]] chip. These cards do require a PIN if the payment is processed via [[Chip and PIN]] technology.\n\nAfter purchasing the card, the cardholder loads the account with any amount of money, up to the predetermined card limit and then uses the card to make purchases the same way as a typical credit card. Prepaid cards can be issued to minors (above 13) since there is no credit line involved. The main advantage over secured credit cards (see above section) is that the cardholder is not required to come up with $500 or more to open an account. With prepaid credit cards purchasers are not charged any interest but are often charged a purchasing fee plus monthly fees after an arbitrary time period. Many other fees also usually apply to a prepaid card.<ref name=\"fcac\">{{cite web| url=http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PrepaidCards_e.asp| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307084013/http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PrepaidCards_e.asp| archivedate=7 March 2007| title=Credit Cards and You \u2013 About Pre-paid Cards| publisher=[[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]]| accessdate=9 January 2008}} document: {{cite web| url=http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PDFs/Prepaid-e.pdf| title=Pre-paid Cards| publisher=[[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]]| format=PDF| accessdate=9 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080229122947/http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PDFs/Prepaid-e.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 29 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nPrepaid credit cards are sometimes marketed to teenagers<ref name=\"fcac\"/> for shopping online without having their parents complete the transaction.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070302185119/http://www.networkworld.com/community/?q=node/11433 \"Buy prepaid credit cards without an ID or age limits?

As all credit cards charge fees and interest, some customers become so indebted to their credit card provider that they are driven to [[bankruptcy]]. Some credit cards often levy a rate of 20 to 30 percent after a payment is missed.<ref>{{cite web|author=CreditCards.com |url=http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/default-penalty-rates-what-they-are-how-to-avoid-1276.php |title=Credit card penalty rates can top 30 percent; how to avoid them |publisher=Creditcards.com |date=27 January 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> In other cases, a fixed charge is levied without change to the interest rate. In some cases [[universal default]] may apply: the high default rate is applied to a card in good standing by missing a payment on an unrelated account from the same provider. This can lead to a snowball effect in which the consumer is drowned by unexpectedly high interest rates. Further, most card holder agreements enable the issuer to arbitrarily raise the interest rate for any reason they see fit. [[First Premier Bank]] at one point offered a credit card with a 79.9% interest rate;<ref>{{cite web|last=Prater |first=Connie |url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/issuer-of-79-9-interest-rate-credit-card-defends-its-product |title=Issuer of 79.9% interest rate credit card defends its product |publisher=FoxBusiness.com |date=7 April 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> however, they discontinued this card in February 2011 because of persistent defaults.<ref>{{cite web|last = Ellis|first = Blake|url = http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/16/pf/first_premier_credit_card_removed/|title = First Premier Bank removes credit card with 59.9% APR|publisher = CNN|date = 17 February 2011|accessdate = 1 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nResearch shows that a substantial fraction of consumers (about 40 percent) choose a sub-optimal credit card agreement, with some incurring hundreds of dollars of avoidable interest costs.<ref>[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2006/wp2006_11.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''Do Consumers Choose the Right Credit Contracts?'', October 2006]</ref>\n\n====Weakens self regulation====\nSeveral studies have shown that consumers are likely to spend more money when they pay by credit card.

Most simply display the [[acceptance mark]]s (stylized logos, shown in the upper-left corner of the sign) of all the cards they accept.]]\nFor [[merchants]], a credit card transaction is often more secure than other forms of payment, such as [[cheque]]s, because the issuing bank commits to pay the merchant the moment the transaction is authorized, regardless of whether the consumer defaults on the credit card payment (except for legitimate disputes, which are discussed below, and can result in charges back to the merchant). In most cases, cards are even more secure than cash, because they discourage theft by the merchant's employees and reduce the amount of cash on the premises. Finally, credit cards reduce the back office expense of processing checks/cash and transporting them to the bank.\n\nPrior to credit cards, each merchant had to evaluate each customer's [[credit history]] before extending credit. That task is now performed by the banks which assume the [[credit risk]]. Credit cards can also aid in securing a sale especially if the customer does not have enough cash on hand or in a checking account. Extra turnover is generated by the fact that the customer can purchase goods and services immediately and is less inhibited by the amount of cash in pocket and the immediate state of the customer's bank balance. Much of merchants' marketing is based on this immediacy.\n\nFor each purchase, the bank charges the merchant a commission (discount fee) for this service and there may be a certain delay before the agreed payment is received by the merchant. The commission is often a percentage of the transaction amount, plus a fixed fee (interchange rate).\n\n===Costs to merchants===\nMerchants are charged several fees for accepting credit cards. The merchant is usually charged a [[commission (remuneration)|commission]] of around 1 to 4 percent of the value of each transaction paid for by credit card.<ref name=gensler2013>{{Citation\n |last=Gensler |first=Lauren |date=April 2013 |title=You (Probably) Won't Pay More to Swipe |magazine=[[Money (magazine)|Money]] |publication-place=New York |page=14}}</ref> The merchant may also pay a variable charge, called a merchant discount rate, for each transaction.<ref name=how/> In some instances of very low-value transactions, use of credit cards will significantly reduce the [[profit margin]] or cause the merchant to lose money on the transaction. Merchants with very low average transaction prices or very high average transaction prices are more averse to accepting credit cards. In some cases merchants may charge users a \"credit card supplement\" (or surcharge), either a fixed amount or a percentage, for payment by credit card.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmibaby.com/bmibaby/terms_and_conditions/our_top_booking_tips,_baby/fees_and_charges.aspx |title=Example of a supplement chargeable to the customer when paying by credit card |publisher=Bmibaby.com |date=5 January 2011 |accessdate=28 July 2011 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708074413/http://www.bmibaby.com/bmibaby/terms_and_conditions/our_top_booking_tips%2C_baby/fees_and_charges.aspx |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df= }}</ref> This practice was prohibited by most credit card contracts in the United States until 2013, when a major settlement between merchants and credit card companies allowed merchants to levy surcharges.

Merchants charged that the two main credit card processing companies, MasterCard and Visa, used their [[monopoly power]] to levy excessive fees in a class-action lawsuit involving the [[National Retail Federation]] and major retailers such as [[Wal-Mart]]. In December 2013, a federal judge approved a $5.7 billion [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] in the case that offered payouts to merchants who had paid credit card fees, the largest antitrust settlement in U.S. history. Some large retailers, such as Wal-Mart and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], chose to not participate in this settlement, however, and have continued their legal fight against the credit card companies.<ref name=washpost />\n\nMerchants are also required to lease or purchase processing equipment, in some cases this equipment is provided free of charge by the [[Payment processor|processor]]. Merchants must also satisfy data security compliance standards which are highly technical and complicated. In many cases, there is a delay of several days before funds are deposited into a merchant's bank account. Because credit card fee structures are very complicated, smaller merchants are at a disadvantage to analyze and predict fees.\n\nFinally, merchants assume the risk of [[chargebacks]] by consumers.\n\n==Security==\n{{Main|Credit card fraud}}\n{{See also|Wireless identity theft}}\n\nCredit card security relies on the physical security of the plastic card as well as the privacy of the credit card number. Therefore, whenever a person other than the card owner has access to the card or its number, security is potentially compromised. Once, merchants would often accept credit card numbers without additional verification for mail order purchases. It is now common practice to only ship to confirmed addresses as a security measure to minimise fraudulent purchases. Some merchants will accept a credit card number for in-store purchases, whereupon access to the number allows easy fraud, but many require the card itself to be present, and require a signature (for magnetic stripe cards). A lost or stolen card can be cancelled, and if this is done quickly, will greatly limit the fraud that can take place in this way. European banks can require a cardholder's security PIN be entered for in-person purchases with the card.\n\nThe [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]] (PCI DSS) is the security standard issued by the [[Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council]] (PCI SSC). This data security standard is used by acquiring banks to impose cardholder data security measures upon their merchants.\n\nThe goal of the credit card companies is not to eliminate fraud, but to \"reduce it to manageable levels\".<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Thrive Business Solutions |url=http://www.thrivesolution.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=28&Itemid=33 |title=PCI Compliance |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305093414/http://www.thrivesolution.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=28&Itemid=33 |archivedate=5 March 2008}}</ref> This implies that fraud prevention measures will be used only if their cost are lower than the potential gains from fraud reduction, whereas high-cost low-return measures will not be used \u2013 as would be expected from organizations whose goal is profit maximization.\n\n[[Internet fraud]] may be by claiming a [[chargeback]] which is not justified (\"[[friendly fraud]]\"), or carried out by the use of credit card information which can be stolen in many ways, the simplest being copying information from retailers, either [[online]] or [[Off-line|offline]]. Despite efforts to improve security for remote purchases using credit cards, security breaches are usually the result of poor practice by merchants. For example, a website that safely uses [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] to encrypt card data from a client may then email the data, unencrypted, from the webserver to the merchant; or the merchant may store unencrypted details in a way that allows them to be accessed over the Internet or by a rogue employee; unencrypted card details are always a security risk. Even encrypted data may be cracked.\n\n[[Controlled payment number]]s (also known as virtual credit cards or disposable credit cards) are another option for protecting against credit card fraud where presentation of a physical card is not required, as in telephone and online purchasing. These are one-time use numbers that function as a payment card and are linked to the user's real account, but do not reveal details, and cannot be used for subsequent unauthorised transactions. They can be valid for a relatively short time, and limited to the actual amount of the purchase or a limit set by the user. Their use can be limited to one merchant. If the number given to the merchant is compromised, it will be rejected if an attempt is made to use it a second time.\n\nA similar system of controls can be used on physical cards. Technology provides the option for banks to support many other controls too that can be turned on and off and varied by the credit card owner in real time as circumstances change (i.e., they can change temporal, numerical, geographical and many other parameters on their primary and subsidiary cards). Apart from the obvious benefits of such controls: from a security perspective this means that a customer can have a Chip and PIN card secured for the real world, and limited for use in the home country. In this eventuality a thief stealing the details will be prevented from using these overseas in non chip and pin [[EMV]] countries. Similarly the real card can be restricted from use on-line so that stolen details will be declined if this tried. Then when card users shop online they can use virtual account numbers. In both circumstances an alert system can be built in notifying a user that a fraudulent attempt has been made which breaches their parameters, and can provide data on this in real time.\n\nAdditionally, there are security features present on the physical card itself in order to prevent [[counterfeiting]]. For example, most modern credit cards have a [[watermark]] that will fluoresce under [[Wood's lamp|ultraviolet light]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Counterfeit Detection |url=https://www.fraudfighter.com/hs-fs/hub/76574/file-1552643545-pdf |access-date=January 28, 2020}}</ref> Most major credit cards have a [[hologram]]. A Visa card has a letter V superimposed over the regular Visa logo and a MasterCard has the letters MC across the front of the card. Older Visa cards have a bald eagle or dove across the front. In the aforementioned cases, the security features are only visible under ultraviolet light and are invisible in normal light.\n\nThe [[United States Department of Justice]], [[United States Secret Service]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]], and [[U.S. Postal Inspection Service]] are responsible for prosecuting criminals who engage in [[credit card fraud]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |title=Identity Theft and Identity Fraud |url=https://www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/identity-theft/identity-theft-and-identity-fraud |access-date=January 28, 2020}}</ref> However, they do not have the resources to pursue all criminals, and in general they only prosecute cases exceeding $5,000.\n\nThree improvements to card security have been introduced to the more common credit card networks, but none has proven to help reduce credit card fraud so far. First, the cards themselves are being replaced with similar-looking tamper-resistant [[smart card]]s which are intended to make [[forgery]] more difficult. The majority of smart card (IC card) based credit cards comply with the [[EMV]] (Europay MasterCard Visa) standard. Second, an additional 3 or 4 digit [[card security code]] (CSC) is now present on the back of most cards, for use in [[card not present transaction]]s. Stakeholders at all levels in electronic payment have recognized the need to develop consistent global standards for security that account for and integrate both current and emerging security technologies. They have begun to address these needs through organisations such as PCI DSS and the [[Secure POS Vendor Alliance]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Secure POS Vendor Alliance is launched by Hypercom, Ingenico and VeriFone |url=http://www.ecommerce-journal.com/news/14854_secure_pos_vendor_alliance_is_launched_by_hypercom_ingenico_and_verifone |publisher=ECommerce Journal |year=2009 |postscript= |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426033905/http://www.ecommerce-journal.com/news/14854_secure_pos_vendor_alliance_is_launched_by_hypercom_ingenico_and_verifone |archivedate=26 April 2009  }}</ref>\n\n===Code 10===\nCode 10 calls are made when merchants are suspicious about accepting a credit card.\n\nThe operator then asks the merchant a series of YES or NO questions to find out whether the merchant is suspicious of the card or the cardholder.

It will then be listed as such on the debtor's credit bureau reports. ([[Equifax]], for instance, lists \"R9\" in the \"status\" column to denote a charge-off.)\n\nA charge-off is considered to be \"written off as uncollectible\". To banks, bad debts and fraud are part of the cost of doing business.\n\nHowever, the debt is still legally valid, and the creditor can attempt to collect the full amount for the time periods permitted under state law, which is usually three to seven years. This includes contacts from internal collections staff, or more likely, an outside [[collection agency]]. If the amount is large (generally over $1,500\u20132,000), there is the possibility of a lawsuit or [[arbitration]].\n\n====Fraud====\n{{Main|Credit card fraud}}\nIn relative numbers the values lost in bank card fraud are minor, calculated in 2006 at 7 cents per 100 dollars worth of transactions (7 [[basis point]]s).<ref>[http://issaasad.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/mercator-fraud-1208.pdf Credit Card Issuer Fraud Management, Report Highlights, December, 2008]</ref> In 2004, in the UK, the cost of fraud was over \u00a3500 million.<ref>[http://www.cardwatch.org.uk/media.asp?sectionid=4&pageid=109 Plastic fraud loss on UK-issued cards 2004/2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616211917/http://www.cardwatch.org.uk/media.asp?sectionid=4&pageid=109|date=16 June 2006}}. [[Cardwatch.org.uk]]. site retrieved 7 July 2006</ref> When a card is stolen, or an unauthorized duplicate made, most card issuers will refund some or all of the charges that the customer has received for things they did not buy. These refunds will, in some cases, be at the expense of the merchant, especially in mail order cases where the merchant cannot claim sight of the card. In several countries, merchants will lose the money if no ID card was asked for, therefore merchants usually require ID card in these countries. Credit card companies generally guarantee the merchant will be paid on legitimate transactions regardless of whether the consumer pays their credit card bill.\n\nMost banking services have their own credit card services that handle fraud cases and monitor for any possible attempt at fraud. Employees that are specialized in doing fraud monitoring and investigation are often placed in Risk Management, Fraud and Authorization, or [[Cards and Unsecured Business]]. Fraud monitoring emphasizes minimizing fraud losses while making an attempt to track down those responsible and contain the situation. [[Credit card fraud]] is a major white collar crime that has been around for many decades, even with the advent of the chip based card (EMV) that was put into practice in some countries to prevent cases such as these. Even with the implementation of such measures, credit card fraud continues to be a problem.\n\n====Interest expenses====\nBanks generally borrow the money they then lend to their customers. As they receive very low-interest loans from other firms, they may borrow as much as their customers require, while lending their capital to other borrowers at higher rates. If the card issuer charges 15% on money lent to users, and it costs 5% to borrow the money to lend, and the balance sits with the cardholder for a year, the issuer earns 10% on the loan. This 10% difference is the \"net interest spread\" and the 5% is the \"interest expense\".\n\n====Operating costs====\nThis is the [[operating cost|cost of running]] the credit card portfolio, including everything from paying the executives who run the company to printing the plastics, to mailing the statements, to running the computers that keep track of every cardholder's balance, to taking the many phone calls which cardholders place to their issuer, to protecting the customers from fraud rings. Depending on the issuer, marketing programs are also a significant portion of expenses.\n\n====Rewards====\n<!--  Commented out: [[File:CreditCard-AU-Qantas-Cobrands.jpg|right|thumb|[[Qantas Frequent Flyer]] co-branded credit cards]] -->\nMany credit card customers receive rewards, such as [[frequent flyer]] points, gift certificates, or [[Cashback reward program|cash back]] as an incentive to use the card. Rewards are generally tied to purchasing an item or service on the card, which may or may not include [[balance transfer]]s, [[Payday loan|cash advances]], or other special uses. Depending on the type of card, rewards will generally cost the issuer between 0.25% and 2.0% of the spread. Networks such as Visa or MasterCard have increased their fees to allow issuers to fund their rewards system. Some issuers discourage redemption by forcing the cardholder to call customer service for rewards. On their servicing website, redeeming awards is usually a feature that is very well hidden by the issuers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} With a fractured and competitive environment, rewards points cut dramatically into an issuer's bottom line, and rewards points and related incentives must be carefully managed to ensure a profitable [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} Unlike unused gift cards, in whose case the [[Breakage (accounting)|breakage]] in certain US states goes to the state's treasury, unredeemed credit card points are retained by the issuer.\n\n===Revenues===\n\n====Interchange fee====\n{{Main|Interchange fee}}\n\nIn addition to fees paid by the card holder, merchants must also pay [[interchange fee]]s to the card-issuing bank and the card association.<ref name=\"S-1\">[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000119312507242653/ds1.htm United States Securities and Exchange Commission FORM S-1], 9 November 2007.</ref><ref name=\"Tampa Tribune\">[http://www2.tbo.com/content/2008/feb/15/bz-debit-cards-cash-in-on-rewards-riches/ Debit Cards Cash In On Rewards Riches] ''Tampa Tribune'', 15 February 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228043408/http://www2.tbo.com/content/2008/feb/15/bz-debit-cards-cash-in-on-rewards-riches/ |date=28 February 2008 }}</ref> For a typical credit card issuer, interchange fee revenues may represent about a quarter of total revenues.<ref name=\"FRB\"/>\n\nThese fees are typically from 1 to 6 percent of each sale, but will vary not only from merchant to merchant (large merchants can negotiate lower rates<ref name=\"FRB\">[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/06-06/interchange.cfm The Interchange Debate: Issues and Economics] James Lyon, 19 January 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322001627/https://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/06-06/interchange.cfm |date=22 March 2008 }}</ref>), but also from card to card, with business cards and rewards cards generally costing the merchants more to process. The interchange fee that applies to a particular transaction is also affected by many other variables including: the type of merchant, the merchant's total card sales volume, the merchant's average transaction amount, whether the cards were physically present, how the information required for the transaction was received, the specific type of card, when the transaction was settled, and the authorized and settled transaction amounts. In some cases, merchants add a surcharge to the credit cards to cover the interchange fee, encouraging their customers to instead use [[cash]], [[debit card]]s, or even [[cheque]]s.\n\n====Interest on outstanding balances====\n[[Credit card interest|Interest]] charges vary widely from card issuer to card issuer. Often, there are \"teaser\" rates in effect for initial periods of time (as low as zero percent for, say, six months), whereas regular rates can be as high as 40 percent. In the U.S. there is no federal limit on the interest or late fees credit card issuers can charge; the interest rates are set by the states, with some states such as [[South Dakota]], having no ceiling on interest rates and fees, inviting some banks to establish their credit card operations there. Other states, for example [[Delaware]], have very weak [[usury|usury laws]]. The [[teaser rate]] no longer applies if the customer does not pay their bills on time, and is replaced by a penalty interest rate (for example, 23.99%) that applies retroactively.\n\n==Fees charged to customers==\nThe major '''credit card fees''' are for:\n*Cash advances and convenience cheques (often 3% of the amount)\n* Charges that result in exceeding the credit limit on the card (whether deliberately or by mistake), called over-limit fees\n* Exchange rate loading fees (sometimes these might not be reported on the customer's statement, even when applied).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creditchoices.co.uk/credit-card-charges-abroad.html|title=credit cards abroad|last=Gracia|first=Mike|date=9 May 2008|publisher=creditchoices.co.uk|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612170006/http://www.creditchoices.co.uk/credit-card-charges-abroad.html|archivedate=12 June 2008|url-status = dead|accessdate=9 May 2008}}\n</ref> The variation of exchange rates applied by different credit cards can be very substantial, as much as 10% according to a [[Lonely Planet]] report in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/tonywheeler/my_lists/why_we_cut_up_our_credit_cards/|title=Comparison of exchange rates using Visa and Diners Club cards in Bali|date=3 March 2010|publisher=Lonelyplanet.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711041436/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/tonywheeler/my_lists/why_we_cut_up_our_credit_cards/|archivedate=11 July 2011|url-status = dead|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref>\n* Late or overdue payments\n* Membership fees (annual or monthly), sometimes a percentage of the credit limit.\n*Returned cheque fees or payment processing fees (e.g. phone payment fee)\n* Transactions in a foreign currency (as much as 3% of the amount). A few financial institutions do not charge a fee for this.\n\nIn the U.S., the [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]] specifies that credit card companies must send cardholders a notice 45 days before they can increase or change certain fees. This includes annual fees, cash advance fees, and late fees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerinfo/wyntk_creditcardrules.htm|title=Federal Reserve Board: Credit Card Rules|publisher=U.S. Federal Reserve Board|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106014436/http://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerinfo/wyntk_creditcardrules.htm|archivedate=6 January 2014|url-status = dead|accessdate=27 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\nOne controversial area is the [[trailing interest]] issue. Trailing interest is the practice of charging interest on the entire bill no matter what percentage of it is paid. U.S. Senator [[Carl Levin]] raised the issue of millions of Americans affected by hidden fees, compounding interest and cryptic terms. Their woes were heard in a Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing which was chaired by Senator Levin, who said that he intends to keep the spotlight on credit card companies and that legislative action may be necessary to purge the industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/03/senate_credit_cards02.html|title=Credit Card Executives Tough Out Senate Hearing|author=Joseph S.

As of 2007, the United Kingdom was one of the world's most credit card-intensive countries, with 2.4 credit cards per consumer, according to the [[APACS|UK Payments Administration Ltd]].<ref>[http://www.apacs.org.uk/resources_publications/card_facts_and_figures.html \"Plastic cards in the UK and how we used them in 2007\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225210810/http://www.apacs.org.uk/resources_publications/card_facts_and_figures.html|date=25 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States until 1984, federal law prohibited surcharges on card transactions. Although the federal [[Truth in Lending Act]] provisions that prohibited surcharges expired that year, a number of states have since enacted laws that continue to outlaw the practice; California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, Maine, New York, Oklahoma, and Texas have laws against surcharges. As of 2006, the United States probably had one of the world's highest if not the top ratio of credit cards per capita, with 984 million bank-issued Visa and MasterCard credit card and debit card accounts alone for an adult population of roughly 220 million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_S0101&-ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_|title=US Census: 2005\u20132007 American Community Survey 3-Year Estimates|author=American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau|publisher=Factfinder.census.gov|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200212055921/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_S0101&-ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_|archivedate=12 February 2020|url-status = dead|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> The credit card per U.S. capita ratio was nearly 4:1 as of 2003<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalscoreindex.com/ViewAllGraphs.aspx|title=Experian's National Score Index|publisher=Nationalscoreindex.com|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> and as high as 5:1 as of 2006.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4207|title=Prime Numbers: The Plastic Revolution|date=19 February 2008|magazine=Foreign Policy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115110602/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4207|archivedate=15 January 2009|url-status = dead|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Over-limit charges==\n===United Kingdom===\nConsumers who keep their account in good order by always staying within their credit limit, and always making at least the minimum monthly payment will see interest as the biggest expense from their card provider. Those who are not so careful and regularly surpass their credit limit or are late in making payments are exposed to multiple charges that were typically as high as \u00a325\u201335<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/credit-and-loans/article.html?in_article_id=407583&in_page_id=9 |title=This is Money Card charges to be slashed |publisher=Thisismoney.co.uk |date=13 March 2006 |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> until a ruling from the [[Office of Fair Trading]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2006/68-06 |title=Current credit card default charges unfair |publisher=Oft.gov.uk |accessdate=28 July 2011 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327193555/http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2006/68-06 |archivedate=27 March 2010 }}</ref> that they would presume charges over \u00a312 to be unfair which led the majority of card providers to reduce their fees to \u00a312.\n\nThe higher fees originally charged were claimed to be designed to recoup the card operator's overall business costs and to try to ensure that the credit card business as a whole generated a profit, rather than simply recovering the cost to the provider of the limit breach, which has been estimated as typically between \u00a33\u2013\u00a34. Profiting from a customer's mistakes is arguably not permitted under UK common law, if the charges constitute penalties for breach of contract, or under the [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]].\n\nSubsequent rulings in respect of personal current accounts suggest that the argument that these charges are penalties for breach of contract is weak, and given the [[Office of Fair Trading]]'s ruling it seems unlikely that any further test case will take place.\n\nWhilst the law remains in the balance, many consumers have made claims against their credit card providers for the charges that they have incurred, plus interest that they would have earned had the money not been deducted from their account. It is likely that claims for amounts charged in excess of \u00a312 will succeed, but claims for charges at the OFT's \u00a312 threshold level are more contentious.\n\n===United States===\nThe [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]] requires that consumers opt into over-limit charges. Some card issuers have therefore commenced solicitations requesting customers to opt into over-limit fees, presenting this as a benefit as it may avoid the possibility of a future transaction being declined. Other issuers have simply discontinued the practice of charging over-limit fees. Whether a customer opts into the over-limit fee or not, banks will in practice have discretion as to whether they choose to authorize transactions above the credit limit or not. Of course, any approved over limit transactions will only result in an over-limit fee for those customers who have opted into the fee. This legislation took effect on 22 February 2010. Following this Act, the companies are now required by law to show on a customer's bills how long it would take them to pay off the balance.\n\n==Neutral consumer resources==\n\n===Canada===\nThe Government of Canada maintains a database of the fees, features, interest rates and reward programs of nearly 200 credit cards available in Canada. This database is updated on a quarterly basis with information supplied by the credit card issuing companies. Information in the database is published every quarter on the website of the [[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]] (FCAC).\n\nInformation in the database is published in two formats. It is available in [[PDF]] comparison tables that break down the information according to type of credit card, allowing the reader to compare the features of, for example, all the student credit cards in the database.\n\nThe database also feeds into an interactive tool on the FCAC website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itools-ioutils.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/CCS-SCC/CCSearchCriteria.aspx?lang=eng |title=FCAC - Interactive Tools - Credit Card Selector Tool |work=FCAC |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221014248/http://itools-ioutils.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/CCS-SCC/CCSearchCriteria.aspx?lang=eng |archivedate=21 December 2013 }}</ref> The interactive tool uses several interview-type questions to build a profile of the user's credit card usage habits and needs, eliminating unsuitable choices based on the profile, so that the user is presented with a small number of credit cards and the ability to carry out detailed comparisons of features, reward programs, interest rates, etc.\n\n==Credit cards in ATMs==\n[[File:ATM 750x1300.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|Acceptance mark at an [[automated teller machine]] ]]\nMany credit cards can be used in an [[Automatic teller machine|ATM]] to withdraw money against the credit limit extended to the card, but many card issuers charge interest on cash advances before they do so on purchases. The interest on cash advances is commonly charged from the date the withdrawal is made, rather than the monthly billing date. Many card issuers levy a commission for cash withdrawals, even if the ATM belongs to the same bank as the card issuer. Merchants do not offer [[debit card cashback|cashback]] on credit card transactions because they would pay a percentage commission of the additional cash amount to their bank or merchant services provider, thereby making it uneconomical. Discover is a notable exception to the above. A customer with a Discover card may get up to $120 cash back if the merchant allows it. This amount is simply added to the card holder's cost of the transaction and no extra fees are charged as the transaction is not considered a cash advance.\n\nMany credit card companies will also, when applying payments to a card, do so, for the matter at hand, at the end of a billing cycle, and apply those payments to everything before cash advances. For this reason, many consumers have large cash balances, which have no grace period and incur interest at a rate that is (usually) higher than the purchase rate, and will carry those balances for years, even if they pay off their statement balance each month.\n\n===Acceptance mark===\nAn ''acceptance mark'' is a logo or design that indicates which card schemes an ATM or [[merchant]] accepts. Common uses include decals and signs at merchant locations or in merchant advertisements. The purpose of the mark is to provide the card holder with information where his or her card can be used. An acceptance mark differs from the a card product name (such as [[Centurion Card|American Express Black card]], [[Eurocard (payment card)|Eurocard]]), as it shows the card scheme (group of cards) accepted. An acceptance mark however corresponds to the card scheme mark shown on a card.\n\nAn acceptance mark is however not an absolute guarantee that all cards belonging to a given card scheme will be accepted.

He was born on April 2, 1963, in Harlan, Iowa. His father, Harold N. Nollen, served in the United States Coast Guard prior to running a successful petroleum distribution business, to which his mother, Shirley A. (Stoltz) Nollen, also contributed.  Nollen was educated at the University of Iowa (1984-1989), where he received Bachelor's Degrees in Broadcasting and Film and Honors History, [[Phi Beta Kappa]], and a Master's Degree in U.S., Modern European and African-American History.

He identified with Karloff's \"monster\", who never spoke in the film, but effectively conveyed a portrait of the misunderstood individual cast out by society.\n\nNollen knew he wanted to write a book about Karloff and had begun in high school. In 1981, Nollen's parents took him to England and Wales as a graduation present.

He plugged one wire into a [[galvanometer]], and watched it as he connected the other wire to a battery. He saw a transient current, which he called a \"wave of electricity\", when he connected the wire to the battery and another when he disconnected it.<ref>''Michael Faraday'', by L. Pearce Williams, p. 182\u20133</ref> This induction was due to the change in [[magnetic flux]] that occurred when the battery was connected and disconnected.<ref name=Giancoli/> Within two months, Faraday found several other manifestations of electromagnetic induction. For example, he saw transient currents when he quickly slid a bar magnet in and out of a coil of wires, and he generated a steady ([[direct current|DC]]) current by rotating a copper disk near the bar magnet with a sliding electrical lead (\"Faraday's disk\").<ref>''Michael Faraday'', by L.

The circuit is completed by brushes making sliding contact with top and bottom discs, which have conducting rims. This is a simplified version of the ''drum generator''.]]\n{{Main article|Electric generator}}\nThe EMF generated by Faraday's law of induction due to relative movement of a circuit and a magnetic field is the phenomenon underlying [[electrical generator]]s. When a [[magnet|permanent magnet]] is moved relative to a conductor, or vice versa, an electromotive force is created. If the wire is connected through an [[electrical load]], current will flow, and thus [[electrical energy]] is generated, converting the mechanical energy of motion to electrical energy. For example, the ''drum generator'' is based upon the figure to the bottom-right. A different implementation of this idea is the [[Homopolar generator|Faraday's disc]], shown in simplified form on the right.\n\nIn the Faraday's disc example, the disc is rotated in a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the disc, causing a current to flow in the radial arm due to the Lorentz force. Mechanical work is necessary to drive this current. When the generated current flows through the conducting rim, a magnetic field is generated by this current through [[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law]] (labelled \"induced B\" in the figure). The rim thus becomes an [[electromagnet]] that resists rotation of the disc (an example of [[Lenz's law]]). On the far side of the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through the far side of the rim to the bottom brush. The B-field induced by this return current opposes the applied B-field, tending to ''decrease'' the flux through that side of the circuit, opposing the ''increase'' in flux due to rotation. On the near side of the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through the near side of the rim to the bottom brush. The induced B-field ''increases'' the flux on this side of the circuit, opposing the ''decrease'' in flux due to r the rotation. The energy required to keep the disc moving, despite this reactive force, is exactly equal to the electrical energy generated (plus energy wasted due to [[friction]], [[Joule heating]], and other inefficiencies). This behavior is common to all generators converting [[mechanical energy]] to electrical energy.\n\n===Electrical transformer===\n{{Main article|Transformer}}\nWhen the electric current in a loop of wire changes, the changing current creates a changing magnetic field. A second wire in reach of this magnetic field will experience this change in magnetic field as a change in its coupled magnetic flux, ''d'' \u03a6<sub>B</sub> / ''d t''. Therefore, an electromotive force is set up in the second loop called the induced EMF or transformer EMF. If the two ends of this loop are connected through an electrical load, current will flow.\n\n====Current clamp====\n[[File:Current Clamp.jpg|thumb|150px|A current clamp]]\n{{Main article|Current clamp}}\n\nA current clamp is a type of transformer with a split core which can be spread apart and clipped onto a wire or coil to either measure the current in it or, in reverse, to induce a voltage. Unlike conventional instruments the clamp does not make electrical contact with the conductor or require it to be disconnected during attachment of the clamp.\n\n===Magnetic flow meter===\n{{Main article|Magnetic flow meter}}\nFaraday's law is used for measuring the flow of electrically conductive liquids and slurries. Such instruments are called magnetic flow meters. The induced voltage \u2107 generated in the magnetic field ''B'' due to a conductive liquid moving at velocity ''v'' is thus given by:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{E}= - B \\ell v,</math>\n\nwhere \u2113 is the distance between electrodes in the magnetic flow meter.\n\n==Eddy currents==\n{{main article|Eddy current}}\nElectrical conductors moving through a steady magnetic field, or stationary conductors within a changing magnetic field, will have circular currents induced within them by induction, called [[eddy current]]s.  Eddy currents flow in closed loops in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field. They have useful applications in [[eddy current brake]]s and induction heating systems. However eddy currents induced in the metal [[magnetic core]]s of transformers and AC motors and generators are undesirable since they dissipate energy (called [[core losses]]) as heat in the resistance of the metal. Cores for these devices use a number of methods to reduce eddy currents:   \n* Cores of low frequency alternating current electromagnets and transformers, instead of being solid metal, are often made of stacks of metal sheets, called ''laminations'', separated by nonconductive coatings. These thin plates reduce the undesirable parasitic eddy currents, as described below.\n* Inductors and transformers used at higher frequencies often have magnetic cores made of nonconductive magnetic materials such as [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] or iron powder held together with a resin binder.  \n\n===Electromagnet laminations===\n[[File:Hawkins Electrical Guide - Figure 292 - Eddy currents in a solid armature.jpg|300px|left]]\nEddy currents occur when a solid metallic mass is rotated in a magnetic field, because the outer portion of the metal cuts more [[magnetic lines of force]] than the inner portion; hence the induced electromotive force is not uniform; this tends to cause electric currents between the points of greatest and least potential. Eddy currents consume a considerable amount of energy and often cause a harmful rise in temperature.<ref name=\"Imagesand\"><cite>Images and reference text are from the public domain book: [[Hawkins Electrical Guide]], Volume 1, Chapter 19: Theory of the Armature, pp. 270\u2013273, Copyright 1917 by Theo.

In practical use, the number of laminations or punchings ranges from 40 to 66 per inch (16 to 26 per centimetre), and brings the eddy current loss down to about one percent. While the plates can be separated by insulation, the voltage is so low that the natural rust/oxide coating of the plates is enough to prevent current flow across the laminations.<ref name=\"Imagesand\" />\n{{clear}}\n[[File:Small DC Motor pole laminations and overview.jpg|300px|left]]\nThis is a rotor approximately 20 mm in diameter from a DC motor used in a {{nowrap|CD player.}} Note the laminations of the electromagnet pole pieces, used to limit parasitic inductive losses.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Parasitic induction within conductors===\n[[File:Hawkins Electrical Guide - Figure 291 - Formation of eddy currents in a solid bar inductor.jpg|300px|left]]\nIn this illustration, a solid copper bar conductor on a rotating armature is just passing under the tip of the pole piece N of the field magnet. Note the uneven distribution of the lines of force across the copper bar. The magnetic field is more concentrated and thus stronger on the left edge of the copper bar (a,b) while the field is weaker on the right edge (c,d). Since the two edges of the bar move with the same velocity, this difference in field strength across the bar creates whorls or current eddies within the copper bar.<ref name=\"Imagesand\"/>\n\nHigh current power-frequency devices, such as electric motors, generators and transformers, use multiple small conductors in parallel to break up the eddy flows that can form within large solid conductors. The same principle is applied to transformers used at higher than power frequency, for example, those used in [[switch mode power supply|switch-mode power supplies]] and the [[intermediate frequency]] coupling transformers of radio receivers.\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Maxwell's equations}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Alternator]]\n* [[Crosstalk]]\n* [[Faraday paradox]]\n* [[Inductance]]\n* [[Moving magnet and conductor problem]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n'''References'''\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://archive.org/details/atreatiseonelec04maxwgoog <!-- quote=intitle:a intitle:treatise intitle:on intitle:electricity intitle:an intitle:magnetism. --> Maxwell, James Clerk (1881), ''A treatise on electricity and magnetism, Vol. II'', Chapter III, \u00a7530, p.&nbsp;178.] Oxford, UK: Clarendon Press. {{ISBN|0-486-60637-6}}.\n\n==External links==\n* [https://nationalmaglab.org/education/magnet-academy/watch-play/interactive/electromagnetic-induction A simple interactive Java tutorial on electromagnetic induction] National High Magnetic Field Laboratory\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080530092914/http://www.physics.smu.edu/~vega/em1304/lectures/lect13/lect13_f03.ppt R.

He plugged one wire into a [[galvanometer]], and watched it as he connected the other wire to a battery. He saw a transient current, which he called a \"wave of electricity\", when he connected the wire to the battery and another when he disconnected it.<ref>''Michael Faraday'', by L. Pearce Williams, p. 182\u20133</ref> This induction was due to the change in [[magnetic flux]] that occurred when the battery was connected and disconnected.<ref name=Giancoli/> Within two months, Faraday found several other manifestations of electromagnetic induction. For example, he saw transient currents when he quickly slid a bar magnet in and out of a coil of wires, and he generated a steady ([[direct current|DC]]) current by rotating a copper disk near the bar magnet with a sliding electrical lead (\"Faraday's disk\").<ref>''Michael Faraday'', by L.

The circuit is completed by brushes making sliding contact with top and bottom discs, which have conducting rims. This is a simplified version of the ''drum generator''.]]\n{{Main article|Electric generator}}\nThe EMF generated by Faraday's law of induction due to relative movement of a circuit and a magnetic field is the phenomenon underlying [[electrical generator]]s. When a [[magnet|permanent magnet]] is moved relative to a conductor, or vice versa, an electromotive force is created. If the wire is connected through an [[electrical load]], current will flow, and thus [[electrical energy]] is generated, converting the mechanical energy of motion to electrical energy. For example, the ''drum generator'' is based upon the figure to the bottom-right. A different implementation of this idea is the [[Homopolar generator|Faraday's disc]], shown in simplified form on the right.\n\nIn the Faraday's disc example, the disc is rotated in a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the disc, causing a current to flow in the radial arm due to the Lorentz force. Mechanical work is necessary to drive this current. When the generated current flows through the conducting rim, a magnetic field is generated by this current through [[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law]] (labelled \"induced B\" in the figure). The rim thus becomes an [[electromagnet]] that resists rotation of the disc (an example of [[Lenz's law]]). On the far side of the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through the far side of the rim to the bottom brush. The B-field induced by this return current opposes the applied B-field, tending to ''decrease'' the flux through that side of the circuit, opposing the ''increase'' in flux due to rotation. On the near side of the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through the near side of the rim to the bottom brush. The induced B-field ''increases'' the flux on this side of the circuit, opposing the ''decrease'' in flux due to r the rotation. The energy required to keep the disc moving, despite this reactive force, is exactly equal to the electrical energy generated (plus energy wasted due to [[friction]], [[Joule heating]], and other inefficiencies). This behavior is common to all generators converting [[mechanical energy]] to electrical energy.\n\n===Electrical transformer===\n{{Main article|Transformer}}\nWhen the electric current in a loop of wire changes, the changing current creates a changing magnetic field. A second wire in reach of this magnetic field will experience this change in magnetic field as a change in its coupled magnetic flux, ''d'' \u03a6<sub>B</sub> / ''d t''. Therefore, an electromotive force is set up in the second loop called the induced EMF or transformer EMF. If the two ends of this loop are connected through an electrical load, current will flow.\n\n====Current clamp====\n[[File:Current Clamp.jpg|thumb|150px|A current clamp]]\n{{Main article|Current clamp}}\n\nA current clamp is a type of transformer with a split core which can be spread apart and clipped onto a wire or coil to either measure the current in it or, in reverse, to induce a voltage. Unlike conventional instruments the clamp does not make electrical contact with the conductor or require it to be disconnected during attachment of the clamp.\n\n===Magnetic flow meter===\n{{Main article|Magnetic flow meter}}\nFaraday's law is used for measuring the flow of electrically conductive liquids and slurries. Such instruments are called magnetic flow meters. The induced voltage \u2107 generated in the magnetic field ''B'' due to a conductive liquid moving at velocity ''v'' is thus given by:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{E}= - B \\ell v,</math>\n\nwhere \u2113 is the distance between electrodes in the magnetic flow meter.\n\n==Eddy currents==\n{{main article|Eddy current}}\nElectrical conductors moving through a steady magnetic field, or stationary conductors within a changing magnetic field, will have circular currents induced within them by induction, called [[eddy current]]s.  Eddy currents flow in closed loops in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field. They have useful applications in [[eddy current brake]]s and induction heating systems. However eddy currents induced in the metal [[magnetic core]]s of transformers and AC motors and generators are undesirable since they dissipate energy (called [[core losses]]) as heat in the resistance of the metal. Cores for these devices use a number of methods to reduce eddy currents:   \n* Cores of low frequency alternating current electromagnets and transformers, instead of being solid metal, are often made of stacks of metal sheets, called ''laminations'', separated by nonconductive coatings. These thin plates reduce the undesirable parasitic eddy currents, as described below.\n* Inductors and transformers used at higher frequencies often have magnetic cores made of nonconductive magnetic materials such as [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] or iron powder held together with a resin binder.  \n\n===Electromagnet laminations===\n[[File:Hawkins Electrical Guide - Figure 292 - Eddy currents in a solid armature.jpg|300px|left]]\nEddy currents occur when a solid metallic mass is rotated in a magnetic field, because the outer portion of the metal cuts more [[magnetic lines of force]] than the inner portion; hence the induced electromotive force is not uniform; this tends to cause electric currents between the points of greatest and least potential. Eddy currents consume a considerable amount of energy and often cause a harmful rise in temperature.<ref name=\"Imagesand\"><cite>Images and reference text are from the public domain book: [[Hawkins Electrical Guide]], Volume 1, Chapter 19: Theory of the Armature, pp. 270\u2013273, Copyright 1917 by Theo. Audel & Co., Printed in the United States</cite></ref>\n{{clear}}\n[[File:Hawkins Electrical Guide - Figure 293 - Armature core with a few laminations showing effect on eddy currents.jpg|300px|left]]\nOnly five laminations or plates are shown in this example, so as to show the subdivision of the eddy currents. In practical use, the number of laminations or punchings ranges from 40 to 66 per inch (16 to 26 per centimetre), and brings the eddy current loss down to about one percent. While the plates can be separated by insulation, the voltage is so low that the natural rust/oxide coating of the plates is enough to prevent current flow across the laminations.<ref name=\"Imagesand\" />\n{{clear}}\n[[File:Small DC Motor pole laminations and overview.jpg|300px|left]]\nThis is a rotor approximately 20 mm in diameter from a DC motor used in a {{nowrap|CD player.}} Note the laminations of the electromagnet pole pieces, used to limit parasitic inductive losses.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Parasitic induction within conductors===\n[[File:Hawkins Electrical Guide - Figure 291 - Formation of eddy currents in a solid bar inductor.jpg|300px|left]]\nIn this illustration, a solid copper bar conductor on a rotating armature is just passing under the tip of the pole piece N of the field magnet. Note the uneven distribution of the lines of force across the copper bar. The magnetic field is more concentrated and thus stronger on the left edge of the copper bar (a,b) while the field is weaker on the right edge (c,d). Since the two edges of the bar move with the same velocity, this difference in field strength across the bar creates whorls or current eddies within the copper bar.<ref name=\"Imagesand\"/>\n\nHigh current power-frequency devices, such as electric motors, generators and transformers, use multiple small conductors in parallel to break up the eddy flows that can form within large solid conductors.

Since then, twelve Soviet and U.S. spacecraft have used braking rockets ([[retrorocket]]s) to make [[Soft landing (aeronautics)|soft landings]] and perform scientific operations on the lunar surface, between 1966 and 1976. In 1966 the USSR accomplished the first soft landings and took the first pictures from the lunar surface during the [[Luna 9]] and [[Luna 13]] missions. The U.S. followed with five uncrewed [[Surveyor Program|Surveyor]] soft landings.\n\nThe Soviet Union achieved the first uncrewed lunar soil [[sample return mission|sample return]] with the [[Luna 16]] probe on 24 September 1970. This was followed by [[Luna 20]] and [[Luna 24]] in 1972 and 1976, respectively. Following the failure at launch in 1969 of the first [[Lunokhod]], [[Luna E-8 No.201]], the [[Luna 17]] and [[Luna 21]] were successful uncrewed [[lunar rover]] missions in 1970 and 1973.\n\nMany missions were failures at launch. In addition, several uncrewed landing missions achieved the Lunar surface but were unsuccessful, including: [[Luna 15]], [[Luna 18]], and [[Luna 23]] all crashed on landing; and the U.S. [[Surveyor 4]] lost all radio contact only moments before its landing.\n\nMore recently, other nations have crashed spacecraft s during its descent to the lunar surface.\n\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter [[Chang'e 1]] executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009. The rover mission [[Chang'e 3]] soft-landed on 14 December 2013, as did its successor, [[Chang'e 4]], on 3 January 2019.

This was accomplished with two US pilot-astronauts flying a [[Lunar Module]] on each of six [[NASA]] missions across a 41-month period starting 20 July 1969, with [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] on [[Apollo 11]], and ending on 14 December 1972 with [[Gene Cernan]] and [[Jack Schmitt]] on [[Apollo 17]]. Cernan was the last man to step off the lunar surface.\n\nAll Apollo lunar missions had a third crew member who remained on board the [[Apollo command module|command module]]. The last three missions included a drivable lunar rover, the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]], for increased mobility.\n\n== Scientific background ==\nTo get to the Moon, a spacecraft must first leave Earth's [[gravity well]]; currently, the only practical means is a [[rocket]]. Unlike airborne vehicles such as [[Balloon (aeronautics)|balloons]] and [[jet aircraft|jets]], a rocket can continue [[acceleration|accelerating]] in the [[vacuum]] outside the [[atmosphere]].\n\nUpon approach of the target moon, a spacecraft will be drawn ever closer to its surface at increasing speeds due to gravity. In order to land intact it must decelerate to less than about {{convert|160|km/h}} and be ruggedized to withstand a \"hard landing\" impact, or it must decelerate to negligible speed at contact for a \"soft landing\" (the only option for humans). The first three attempts by the U.S. to perform a successful hard Moon landing with a ruggedized [[seismometer]] package in 1962 all failed.<ref name=\"nasa-ranger3\">{{cite web| url= https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1962-012A|title=NASA \u2013 NSSDC \u2013 Spacecraft \u2013 Ranger 3 Details| accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> The Soviets first achieved the milestone of a hard lunar landing with a ruggedized camera in 1966, followed only months later by the first uncrewed soft lunar landing by the U.S.\n\nThe speed of a crash landing on its surface is typically between 70 and 100% of the [[escape velocity]] of the target moon, and thus this is the total velocity which must be shed from the target moon's gravitational attraction for a soft landing to occur.

There have been [[list of artificial objects on the Moon|many such Moon crashes]], often with their flight path controlled to impact at precise locations on the lunar surface. For example, during the Apollo program the [[S-IVB]] third stage of the [[Saturn V]] rocket as well as the spent ascent stage of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] were deliberately crashed on the Moon several times to provide impacts registering as a [[Quake (natural phenomenon)#Moonquake|moonquake]] on [[seismometer]]s that had been left on the lunar surface. Such crashes were instrumental in mapping the [[internal structure of the Moon]].\n\nTo return to Earth, the escape velocity of the Moon must be overcome for the spacecraft to escape the [[gravity well]] of the Moon. Rockets must be used to leave the Moon and return to space. Upon reaching Earth, atmospheric entry techniques are used to absorb the [[kinetic energy]] of a returning spacecraft and reduce its speed for safe landing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These functions greatly complicate a moon landing mission and lead to many additional operational considerations. Any moon departure rocket must first be carried to the Moon's surface by a moon landing rocket, increasing the latter's required size. The Moon departure rocket, larger moon landing rocket and any Earth atmosphere entry equipment such as heat shields and [[parachute]]s must in turn be lifted by the original launch vehicle, greatly increasing its size by a significant and almost prohibitive degree.\n\n== Political background ==\n{{Main|Space Race}}\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{Tone|section|date=January 2016}}\n{{Importance section|date=January 2016}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2013}}}}\nThe intense efforts devoted in the 1960s to achieving first an uncrewed and then ultimately a human Moon landing become easier to understand in the political context of its historical era. [[World War II]] had introduced many new and deadly innovations including [[blitzkrieg]]-style surprise attacks used in the [[invasion of Poland]] and in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]; the [[V-2 rocket]], a [[ballistic missile]] which killed thousands in attacks on London and [[Antwerp]]; and the [[atom bomb]], which killed hundreds of thousands in the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. In the 1950s, tensions mounted between the two ideologically opposed superpowers of the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] that had emerged as victors in the conflict, particularly after the development by both countries of the [[hydrogen bomb]].\n[[File:Luna 3 moon.jpg|left|thumb|The first image of another world from space, returned by Luna 3, showed the far side of the Moon in October 1959.]]\n[[Willy Ley]] wrote in 1957 that a rocket to the Moon \"could be built later this year if somebody can be found to sign some papers\".<ref name=\"ley195707\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1957-07/Galaxy_1957_07#page/n61/mode/2up | title=For Your Information | work=Galaxy Science Fiction | date=July 1957 | accessdate=11 June 2014 | author=Ley, Willy | number=61\u201371|p=69}}</ref> On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union [[Rocket launch|launched]] ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' as the first [[artificial satellite]] to orbit the Earth and so initiated the [[Space Race]]. This unexpected event was a source of pride to the Soviets and shock to the U.S., who could now potentially be surprise attacked by nuclear-tipped Soviet rockets in under 30 minutes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Also, the steady beeping of the [[radio beacon]] aboard ''Sputnik 1'' as it passed overhead every 96 minutes was widely viewed on both sides{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} as effective propaganda to [[Third World]] countries demonstrating the technological superiority of the Soviet [[political system]] compared to that of the U.S. This perception was reinforced by a string of subsequent rapid-fire Soviet space achievements. In 1959, the R-7 rocket was used to launch the first escape from Earth's gravity into a [[solar orbit]], the first crash impact onto the surface of the Moon, and the first photography of the never-before-seen [[far side of the Moon]]. These were the [[Luna 1]], [[Luna 2]], and [[Luna 3]] spacecraft.\n\n[[File:Lunar Lander Model.jpg|right|thumb|A 1963 conceptual model of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Apollo Lunar Excursion Module]]]]\nThe U.S. response to these Soviet achievements was to greatly accelerate previously existing military space and missile projects and to create a civilian space agency, [[NASA]]. Military efforts were initiated to develop and produce mass quantities of intercontinental ballistic missiles ([[ICBMs]]) that would bridge the so-called [[missile gap]] and enable a policy of [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]] to [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] with the Soviets known as [[mutual assured destruction]] or MAD. These newly developed [[missile]]s were made available to civilians of NASA for various projects (which would have the added benefit of demonstrating the payload, guidance accuracy and reliabilities of U.S. ICBMs to the Soviets).\n\nWhile NASA stressed peaceful and scientific uses for these rockets, their use in various lunar exploration efforts also had secondary goal of realistic, goal-oriented testing of the missiles themselves and development of associated infrastructure,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} just as the Soviets were doing with their R-7.\n\n== Early Soviet uncrewed lunar missions (1958\u20131965) ==\n\nAfter the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, historical records were released to allow the true accounting of Soviet lunar efforts. Unlike the U.S. tradition of assigning a particular mission name in advance of a launch, the Soviets assigned a public \"[[Luna programme|Luna]]\" mission number only if a launch resulted in a spacecraft going beyond Earth orbit. The policy had the effect of hiding Soviet Moon mission failures from public view. If the attempt failed in Earth orbit before departing for the Moon, it was frequently (but not always) given a \"[[Sputnik programme|Sputnik]]\" or \"[[Cosmos (satellite)|Cosmos]]\" Earth-orbit mission number to hide its purpose. Launch explosions were not acknowledged at all.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n! align=left | Mission\n! align=center | Mass (kg)\n! align=center | Launch vehicle\n! align=center | Launch date\n! align=center | Goal\n! align=center | Result\n|-\n|\n|\n| [[Semyorka]] \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 23 September 1958\n| Impact\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction at T+ 93 s\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 12 October 1958\n| Impact\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction at T+ 104 s\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 4 December 1958\n| Impact\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction at T+ 254 s\n|-\n| [[Luna 1|Luna-1]]\n| 361\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 2 January 1959\n| Impact\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">Partial success</span> \u2013 first spacecraft to reach escape velocity, lunar flyby, solar orbit; missed the Moon\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 18 June 1959\n| Impact\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction at T+ 153 s\n|-\n| [[Luna 2|Luna-2]]\n| 390\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 12 September 1959\n| Impact\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 first lunar impact\n|-\n| [[Luna 3|Luna-3]]\n| 270\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 4 October 1959\n| Flyby\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 first photos of lunar far side\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 15 April 1960\n| Flyby\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 16 April 1960\n| Flyby\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction at T+ 1 s\n|-\n| [[Sputnik]]-25\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 4 January 1963\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 stranded in low Earth orbit\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 3 February 1963\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction at T+ 105 s\n|-\n| [[Luna 4|Luna-4]]\n| 1422\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 2 April 1963\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 lunar flyby at {{convert|8000|km|mi}}\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 21 March 1964\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 20 April 1964\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n| [[Cosmos (satellite)|Cosmos]]-60\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 12 March 1965\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 stranded in low Earth orbit\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 10 April 1965\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n| [[Luna 5|Luna-5]]\n| 1475\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 9 May 1965\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 lunar impact\n|-\n| [[Luna 6|Luna-6]]\n| 1440\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 8 June 1965\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 lunar flyby at {{convert|160000|km|mi}}\n|-\n| [[Luna 7|Luna-7]]\n| 1504\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 4 October 1965\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 lunar impact\n|-\n| [[Luna 8|Luna-8]]\n| 1550\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 3 December 1965\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 lunar impact during landing attempt\n|-\n|}\n\n== Early U.S. uncrewed lunar missions (1958\u20131965) ==\n{{essay-like|section|date=September 2019}}\n[[File:Ranger 9 sudden impact.gif|thumb|right|Artist's portrayal of a Ranger spacecraft right before impact]]\n[[File:Ranger8-moon.jpg|thumb|right|One of the last photos of the Moon transmitted by Ranger 8 right before impact]]\n\nIn contrast to Soviet lunar exploration triumphs in 1959, success eluded initial U.S. efforts to reach the Moon with the [[Pioneer program|Pioneer]] and [[Ranger program]]s.

The first, a mission managed by the [[United States Air Force]], exploded during launch; all subsequent Pioneer lunar flights had NASA as the lead management organization. The next two returned to Earth and burned up upon reentry into the atmosphere after achieved maximum altitudes of around {{convert|110,000|km|mi}} and {{convert|1450|km|mi|}}, far short of the roughly {{convert|400000|km|mi}} required to reach the vicinity of the Moon.\n\nNASA then collaborated with the [[United States Army]]'s [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency|Ballistic Missile Agency]] to fly two extremely small cone-shaped probes on the [[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]] ICBM, carrying only [[photocells]] which would be triggered by the light of the Moon and a lunar radiation environment experiment using a [[Geiger-M\u00fcller tube]] detector. The first of these reached an altitude of only around {{convert| 100000|km|mi}}, serendipitously gathering data that established the presence of the [[Van Allen radiation belts]] before reentering Earth's atmosphere. The second passed by the Moon at a distance of more than {{convert|60000|km|mi}}, twice as far as planned and too far away to trigger either of the on-board scientific instruments, yet still becoming the first U.S. spacecraft to reach a [[solar orbit]].\n\nThe final Pioneer lunar probe design consisted of four \"[[paddlewheel]]\" [[Photovoltaic module|solar panels]] extending from a one-meter diameter spherical [[Spin-stabilized satellite|spin-stabilized]] spacecraft body equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television-like system, estimate the Moon's mass and topography of the [[Peak of Eternal Light|poles]], record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites, study radiation, measure [[Magnetic field of celestial bodies|magnetic fields]], detect [[Alfv\u00e9n wave|low frequency electromagnetic waves]] in space and use a sophisticated integrated [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] system for maneuvering and orbit insertion as well. None of the four spacecraft built in this series of probes survived launch on its [[Atlas (missile)|Atlas]] ICBM outfitted with an Able upper stage.\n\nFollowing the unsuccessful Atlas-Able Pioneer probes, NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] embarked upon an uncrewed spacecraft development program whose modular design could be used to support both lunar and interplanetary exploration missions. The interplanetary versions were known as [[Mariner program|Mariners]]; lunar versions were [[Ranger program|Rangers]]. JPL envisioned three versions of the Ranger lunar probes: Block I prototypes, which would carry various radiation detectors in test flights to a very high Earth orbit that came nowhere near the Moon; Block II, which would try to accomplish the first Moon landing by hard landing a seismometer package; and Block III, which would crash onto the lunar surface without any braking rockets while taking very high resolution wide-area photographs of the Moon during their descent.\n\n=== Ranger missions ===\n{{See also|Ranger program}}\nThe Ranger 1 and 2 Block I missions were virtually identical.<ref name=\"nasa-ranger1\">{{cite web| url= https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1961-021A|title=NASA \u2013 NSSDC \u2013 Spacecraft \u2013 Ranger 1 Details|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"nasa-ranger2\">{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1961-032A|title=NASA \u2013 NSSDC \u2013 Spacecraft \u2013 Ranger 2 Details|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> Spacecraft experiments included a [[H-alpha|Lyman-alpha]] telescope, a [[rubidium|rubidium-vapor]] [[magnetometer]], electrostatic analyzers, medium-energy-range [[particle detector]]s, two triple coincidence telescopes, a cosmic-ray integrating [[ionization chamber]], [[cosmic dust]] detectors, and [[scintillation counter]]s.

Weight was distributed in the payload sphere so it would rotate in its liquid blanket to place the seismometer into an upright and operational position no matter what the final resting orientation of the external landing sphere. After landing, plugs were to be opened allowing the freon to evaporate and the payload sphere to settle into upright contact with the landing sphere. The batteries were sized to allow up to three months of operation for the payload sphere. Various mission constraints limited the landing site to Oceanus Procellarum on the lunar equator, which the lander ideally would reach 66 hours after launch.\n\nNo cameras were carried by the Ranger landers, and no pictures were to be captured from the lunar surface during the mission. Instead, the {{convert|3.1|m|ft}} Ranger Block II mother ship carried a 200-scan-line television camera which was to capture images during the free-fall descent to the lunar surface. The camera was designed to transmit a picture every 10 seconds.<ref name=\"nasa-ranger4\"/> Seconds before impact, at {{convert|5|and|0.6|km|mi}} above the lunar surface, the Ranger mother ships took picture (which may be viewed [http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/ranger.html here]).\n\nOther instruments gathering data before the mother ship crashed onto the Moon were a gamma ray spectrometer to measure overall lunar chemical composition and a radar altimeter. The radar altimeter was to give a signal ejecting the landing capsule and its solid-fueled braking rocket overboard from the Block II mother ship. The braking rocket was to slow and the landing sphere to a dead stop at {{convert|330|m|ft}} above the surface and separate, allowing the landing sphere to free fall once more and hit the surface.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nOn Ranger 3, failure of the Atlas guidance system and a software error aboard the Agena upper stage combined to put the spacecraft on a course that would miss the Moon. Attempts to salvage lunar photography during a flyby of the Moon were thwarted by in-flight failure of the onboard flight computer. This was probably because of prior [[sterilization (microbiology)|heat sterilization]] of the spacecraft by keeping it above the [[boiling]] point of water for 24 hours on the ground, to protect the Moon from being contaminated by Earth organisms. Heat sterilization was also blamed for subsequent in-flight failures of the spacecraft computer on Ranger 4 and the power subsystem on Ranger 5. Only Ranger 4 reached the Moon in an uncontrolled crash impact on the far side of the Moon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nHeat sterilization was discontinued for the final four Block III Ranger probes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These replaced the Block II landing capsule and its retrorocket with a heavier, more capable television system to support landing site selection for upcoming Apollo crewed Moon landing missions. Six cameras were designed to take thousands of high-altitude photographs in the final twenty-minute period before crashing on the lunar surface. Camera resolution was 1,132 scan lines, far higher than the 525 lines found in a typical U.S. 1964 home television. While [[Ranger 6]] suffered a failure of this camera system and returned no photographs despite an otherwise successful flight, the subsequent [[Ranger 7]] mission to Mare Cognitum was a complete success.\n\nBreaking the six-year string of failures in U.S. attempts to photograph the Moon at close range, the [[Ranger 7]] mission was viewed as a national turning point and instrumental in allowing the key 1965 NASA budget appropriation to pass through the [[United States Congress]] intact without a reduction in funds for the Apollo crewed Moon landing program. Subsequent successes with [[Ranger 8]] and [[Ranger 9]] further buoyed U.S. hopes.\n\n== Soviet uncrewed soft landings (1966\u20131976) ==\n[[File:\u041b\u0443\u043d\u0430-16.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Model of Luna 16 Moon soil sample return lander]]\n[[File:Soviet moonrover.JPG|thumb|right|Model of Soviet Lunokhod automatic Moon rover]]\nThe [[Luna 9]] spacecraft, launched by the [[Soviet Union]], performed the first successful soft Moon landing on 3 February 1966.

To the general public both countries had demonstrated roughly equal technical capabilities by returning photographic images from the surface of the Moon. These pictures provided a key affirmative answer to the crucial question of whether or not lunar soil would support upcoming crewed landers with their much greater weight.\n\nHowever, the Luna 9 hard landing of a ruggedized sphere using airbags at a {{convert|50|kph|adj=on}} ballistic impact speed had much more in common with the failed 1962 Ranger landing attempts and their planned {{convert|160|kph|adj=on}} impacts than with the Surveyor 1 soft landing on three footpads using its radar-controlled, adjustable-thrust retrorocket. While Luna 9 and Surveyor 1 were both major national accomplishments, only Surveyor 1 had reached its landing site employing key technologies that would be needed for a crewed flight. Thus as of mid-1966, the United States had begun to pull ahead of the Soviet Union in the so-called Space Race to land a man on the Moon.\n\n[[File:Space Race 1957-1975 black text.png|thumb|450px|A timeline of the space race between 1957 and 1975, with missions from the US and USSR.]]\n\nAdvances in other areas were necessary before crewed spacecraft could follow uncrewed ones to the surface of the Moon. Of particular importance was developing the expertise to perform flight operations in lunar orbit. Ranger, Surveyor and initial Luna Moon landing attempts all flew directly to the surface without a lunar orbit. Such [[direct ascent]]s use a minimum amount of fuel for uncrewed spacecraft on a one-way trip.\n\nIn contrast, crewed vehicles need additional fuel after a lunar landing to enable a return trip back to Earth for the crew. Leaving this massive amount of required Earth-return fuel in lunar orbit until it is used later in the mission is far more efficient than taking such fuel down to the lunar surface in a Moon landing and then hauling it all back into space yet again, working against lunar gravity both ways. Such considerations lead logically to a [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] mission profile for a crewed Moon landing.\n\nAccordingly, beginning in mid-1966 both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. naturally progressed into missions featuring lunar orbit as a prerequisite to a crewed Moon landing. The primary goals of these initial uncrewed orbiters were extensive photographic mapping of the entire lunar surface for the selection of crewed landing sites and, for the Soviets, the checkout of radio communications gear that would be used in future soft landings.\n\nAn unexpected major discovery from initial lunar orbiters were vast volumes of dense materials beneath the surface of the Moon's [[lunar maria|maria]]. Such mass concentrations (\"[[mass concentration (astronomy)|mascons]]\") can send a crewed mission dangerously off course in the final minutes of a Moon landing when aiming for a relatively small landing zone that is smooth and safe. Mascons were also found over a longer period of time to greatly disturb the orbits of low-altitude satellites around the Moon, making their orbits unstable and forcing an inevitable crash on the lunar surface in the relatively short period of months to a few years.\n\nControlling the location of impact for spent lunar orbiters can have scientific value. For example, in 1999 the NASA [[Lunar Prospector]] orbiter was deliberately targeted to impact a permanently shadowed area of Shoemaker Crater near the lunar south pole. It was hoped that energy from the impact would vaporize suspected shadowed ice deposits in the crater and liberate a water vapor plume detectable from Earth. No such plume was observed. However, a small vial of ashes from the body of pioneer lunar scientist [[Eugene Shoemaker]] was delivered by the Lunar Prospector to the crater named in his honor \u2013 currently{{when|date=September 2019}} the only human remains on the Moon.\n\n== Soviet lunar orbit satellites (1966\u20131974) ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n\n! align=center | U.S.S.R. mission\n! align=center | Mass (kg)\n! align=center | Booster\n! align=center | Launched\n! align=center | Mission goal\n! align=center | Mission result\n|-\n| Cosmos \u2013 111\n|\n| [[Molniya-M]]\n| align=\"right\" | 1 March 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 stranded in low Earth orbit\n|-\n| [[Luna 10|Luna-10]]\n| 1,582\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 31 March 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 2,738&nbsp;km x 2,088&nbsp;km x 72 deg orbit, 178&nbsp;m period, 60-day science mission\n|-\n| [[Luna 11|Luna-11]]\n| 1,640\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 24 August 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 2,931&nbsp;km x 1,898&nbsp;km x 27 deg orbit, 178&nbsp;m period, 38-day science mission\n|-\n| [[Luna 12|Luna-12]]\n| 1,620\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 22 October 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 2,938&nbsp;km x 1,871&nbsp;km x 10 deg orbit, 205&nbsp;m period, 89-day science mission\n|-\n| Cosmos-159\n| 1,700\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 17 May 1967\n| Prototype test\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 high Earth orbit crewed landing communications gear radio calibration test\n|-\n|\n|\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 7 February 1968\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit \u2013 attempted radio calibration test?\n|-\n| [[Luna 14|Luna-14]]\n| 1,700\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 7 April 1968\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 870&nbsp;km x 160&nbsp;km x 42 deg orbit, 160&nbsp;m period, unstable orbit, radio calibration test?\n|-\n| [[Luna 19|Luna-19]]\n| 5,700\n| [[Proton rocket|Proton]]\n| align=\"right\" | 28 September 1971\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 140&nbsp;km x 140&nbsp;km x 41 deg orbit, 121&nbsp;m period, 388-day science mission\n|-\n| [[Luna 22|Luna-22]]\n| 5,700\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 29 May 1974\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 222&nbsp;km x 219&nbsp;km x 19 deg orbit, 130&nbsp;m period, 521-day science mission\n|-\n|}\n\n[[Luna 10]] became the first spacecraft to orbit the Moon on 3 April 1966.\n\n== U.S. lunar orbit satellites (1966\u20131967) ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n! align=left | U.S. mission\n! align=center | Mass (kg)\n! align=center | Booster\n! align=center | Launched\n! align=center | Mission goal\n! align=center | Mission result\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 1]]\n| 386\n| [[Atlas (missile)|Atlas]] \u2013 [[RM-81 Agena|Agena]]\n| align=\"right\" | 10 August 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 1,160&nbsp;km X 189&nbsp;km x 12 deg orbit, 208&nbsp;m period, 80-day photography mission\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 2]]\n| 386\n| Atlas \u2013 Agena\n| align=\"right\" | 6 November 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 1,860&nbsp;km X 52&nbsp;km x 12 deg orbit, 208&nbsp;m period, 339-day photography mission\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 3]]\n| 386\n| Atlas \u2013 Agena\n| align=\"right\" | 5 February 1967\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 1,860&nbsp;km X 52&nbsp;km x 21 deg orbit, 208&nbsp;m period, 246-day photography mission\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 4]]\n| 386\n| Atlas \u2013 Agena\n| align=\"right\" | 4 May 1967\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 6,111&nbsp;km X 2,706&nbsp;km x 86 deg orbit, 721&nbsp;m period, 180-day photography mission\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 5]]\n| 386\n| Atlas \u2013 Agena\n| align=\"right\" | 1 August 1967\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 6,023&nbsp;km X 195&nbsp;km x 85 deg orbit, 510&nbsp;m period, 183-day photography mission\n|-\n|}\n\n== Soviet circumlunar loop flights (1967\u20131970) ==\n{{Main|Soviet crewed lunar programs}}\n[[File:Zond Assembly.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Zond program|Zond]] mounted on top stage of Proton booster in assembly hangar]]\nIt is possible to aim a spacecraft from Earth so it will loop around the Moon and return to Earth without entering lunar orbit, following the so-called [[free return trajectory]]. Such circumlunar loop missions are simpler than lunar orbit missions because rockets for lunar orbit braking and Earth return are not required. However, a crewed circumlunar loop trip poses significant challenges beyond those found in a crewed low-Earth-orbit mission, offering valuable lessons in preparation for a crewed Moon landing. Foremost among these are mastering the demands of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere upon returning from the Moon.\n\nInhabited Earth-orbiting vehicles such as the Space Shuttle return to Earth from speeds of around {{convert|27000|km/h|m/s|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Due to the effects of gravity, a vehicle returning from the Moon hits Earth's atmosphere at a much higher speed of around {{convert|40000|km/h|m/s|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The [[g-force|g-loading]] on astronauts during the resulting [[acceleration|deceleration]] can be at the limits of human endurance even during a nominal reentry. Slight variations in the vehicle flight path and reentry angle during a return from the Moon can easily result in fatal levels of deceleration force.\n\nAchieving a crewed circumlunar loop flight prior to a crewed lunar landing became a primary goal of the Soviets with their [[Zond program|Zond]] spacecraft program. The first three Zonds were robotic planetary probes; after that, the Zond name was transferred to a completely separate human spaceflight program. The initial focus of these later Zonds was extensive testing of required high-speed reentry techniques. This focus was not shared by the U.S., who chose instead to bypass the stepping stone of a crewed circumlunar loop mission and never developed a separate spacecraft for this purpose.\n\nInitial crewed spaceflights in the early 1960s placed a single person in low Earth orbit during the Soviet [[Vostok programme|Vostok]] and U.S. [[Mercury program|Mercury]] programs. A two-flight extension of the Vostok program known as [[Voskhod programme|Voskhod]] effectively used Vostok capsules with their ejection seats removed to achieve Soviet space firsts of multiple person crews in 1964 and spacewalks in early 1965. These capabilities were later demonstrated by the U.S. in ten [[Gemini program|Gemini]] low Earth orbit missions throughout 1965 and 1966, using a totally new second-generation spacecraft design that had little in common with the earlier Mercury. These Gemini missions went on to prove techniques for orbital [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous and docking]] crucial to a crewed lunar landing mission profile.\n\nAfter the end of the Gemini program, the Soviet Union began flying their second-generation Zond crewed spacecraft in 1967 with the ultimate goal of looping a cosmonaut around the Moon and returning him or her immediately to Earth. The [[Zond program|Zond]] spacecraft was launched with the simpler and already operational [[Proton rocket|Proton]] launch rocket, unlike the parallel Soviet human Moon landing effort also underway at the time based on third-generation [[Soyuz spacecraft]] requiring development of the advanced [[N-1 rocket|N-1]] booster. The Soviets thus believed they could achieve a crewed Zond circumlunar flight years before a U.S. human lunar landing and so score a propaganda victory. However, significant development problems delayed the Zond program and the success of the U.S. Apollo lunar landing program led to the eventual termination of the Zond effort.\n\nLike Zond, Apollo flights were generally launched on a free return trajectory that would return them to Earth via a circumlunar loop if a [[Apollo service module|service module]] malfunction failed to place them in lunar orbit. This option was implemented after an explosion aboard the [[Apollo 13]] mission in 1970, which is the only crewed circumlunar loop mission flown to date.{{when|date=September 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse; \"\n|-\n! align=left | U.S.S.R mission\n! align=center | Mass (kg)\n! align=center | Booster\n! align=center | Launched\n! align=center | Mission goal\n! align=center | Payload\n! align=center | Mission result\n|-\n| [[Cosmos-146]]\n| 5,400\n| [[Proton rocket|Proton]]\n| align=\"right\" | 10 March 1967\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">Partial success</span> \u2013 Successfully reached high Earth orbit, but became stranded and was unable to initiate controlled high speed atmospheric reentry test\n|-\n| [[Cosmos-154]]\n| 5,400\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 8 April 1967\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">Partial success</span> \u2013 Successfully reached high Earth orbit, but became stranded and was unable to initiate controlled high speed atmospheric reentry test\n|-\n|\n|\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 28 September 1967\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n|\n|\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 22 November 1967\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n| [[Zond 4|Zond-4]]\n| 5,140\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 2 March 1968\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">Partial success</span> \u2013 launched successfully to 300,000&nbsp;km high Earth orbit, high speed reentry test guidance malfunction, intentional self-destruct to prevent landfall outside Soviet Union\n|-\n|\n|\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 23 April 1968\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit; launch preparation tank explosion kills three in pad crew\n|-\n| [[Zond 5|Zond-5]]\n| 5,375\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 15 September 1968\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 looped around Moon with Earth's first near-lunar life forms, two tortoises and other live biological specimens, and the capsule and payload safely to Earth despite landing off-target outside the Soviet Union in the Indian Ocean\n|-\n| [[Zond 6|Zond-6]]\n| 5,375\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 10 November 1968\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">Partial success</span> \u2013 looped around Moon, successful reentry, but loss of cabin air pressure caused biological payload death, parachute system malfunction and severe vehicle damage upon landing\n|-\n|\n|\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 20 January 1969\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n| [[Zond 7|Zond-7]]\n| 5,979\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 8 August 1969\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 looped around Moon, returned biological payload safely to Earth and landed on-target inside Soviet Union.

Despite the failure suffered in its final moments, the Zond 6 mission was reported by Soviet media as being a success as well. Although hailed worldwide as remarkable achievements, both these Zond missions flew off-nominal reentry trajectories resulting in deceleration forces that would have been fatal to humans.\n\nAs a result, the Soviets secretly planned to continue uncrewed Zond tests until their reliability to support human flight had been demonstrated. However, due to NASA's continuing problems with the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]], and because of [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] reports of a potential Soviet crewed circumlunar flight in late 1968, NASA fatefully changed the flight plan of [[Apollo 8]] from an Earth-orbit lunar module test to a lunar orbit mission scheduled for late December 1968.\n\nIn early December 1968 the launch window to the Moon opened for the Soviet launch site in [[Baikonur]], giving the USSR their final chance to beat the US to the Moon. [[Cosmonauts]] went on alert and asked to fly the Zond spacecraft then in final countdown at Baikonur on the first human trip to the Moon. Ultimately, however, the Soviet [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] decided the risk of crew death was unacceptable given the combined poor performance to that point of Zond/Proton and so scrubbed the launch of a crewed Soviet lunar mission. Their decision proved to be a wise one, since this unnumbered Zond mission was destroyed in another uncrewed test when it was finally launched several weeks later.\n\nBy this time flights of the third generation U.S. [[Apollo spacecraft]] had begun. Far more capable than the Zond, the Apollo spacecraft had the necessary rocket power to slip into and out of lunar orbit and to make course adjustments required for a safe reentry during the return to Earth. The [[Apollo 8]] mission carried out the first human trip to the Moon on 24 December 1968, certifying the [[Saturn V]] booster for crewed use and flying not a circumlunar loop but instead a full ten orbits around the Moon before returning safely to Earth. [[Apollo 10]] then performed a full dress rehearsal of a crewed Moon landing in May 1969. This mission orbited within {{convert|47,400|ft|km}} of the lunar surface, performing necessary low-altitude mapping of trajectory-altering mascons using a factory prototype lunar module too heavy to land. With the failure of the robotic Soviet sample return Moon landing attempt [[Luna 15]] in July 1969, the stage was set for [[Apollo 11]].\n\n== Human Moon landings (1969\u20131972) ==\n[[File:N1%2BSaturn5.jpg|thumb|250px|The U.S. [[Saturn V]] and the Soviet [[N1 (rocket)|N1]].]]\n\n=== US strategy ===\n{{Main|Apollo program#Political pressure builds}}\nPlans for human Moon exploration began during the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration. In a series of mid-1950s articles in ''[[Collier's]]'' magazine, [[Wernher von Braun]] had popularized the idea of a crewed expedition to establish a lunar base. A human Moon landing posed several daunting technical challenges to the US and USSR. Besides guidance and weight management, [[atmospheric re-entry]] without [[Ablation|ablative]] overheating was a major hurdle. After the Soviets launched [[Sputnik]], von Braun promoted a plan for the US Army to establish a military lunar outpost by 1965.\n\nAfter the [[Space race#Humans in space|early Soviet successes]], especially [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s flight, US President [[John F. Kennedy]] looked for a project that would capture the public imagination. He asked Vice President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to make recommendations on a scientific endeavor that would prove US world leadership. The proposals included non-space options such as massive irrigation projects to benefit the [[Third World]]. The Soviets, at the time, had more powerful rockets than the US, which gave them an advantage in some kinds of space mission.\n\nAdvances in US nuclear weapon technology had led to smaller, lighter warheads; the Soviets' were much heavier, and the powerful [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] rocket was developed to carry them. More modest missions such as flying around the Moon, or a space lab in lunar orbit (both were proposed by Kennedy to von Braun), offered too much advantage to the Soviets; ''landing'', however, would capture the world's imagination.\n\n[[File:Apollo Landings by Nasa.jpg|thumb|350px|Apollo landing sites]]\nJohnson had championed the US human spaceflight program ever since Sputnik, sponsoring legislation to create NASA while he was still a senator. When Kennedy asked him in 1961 to research the best achievement to counter the Soviets' lead, Johnson responded that the US had an even chance of beating them to a crewed lunar landing, but not for anything less. Kennedy seized on Apollo as the ideal focus for efforts in space. He ensured continuing funding, shielding space spending from the 1963 tax cut, but diverting money from other NASA scientific projects. These diversions dismayed NASA's leader, [[James E. Webb]], who perceived the need for NASA's support from the scientific community.\n\nThe Moon landing required development of the large Saturn V [[launch vehicle]], which achieved a perfect record: zero catastrophic failures or launch vehicle-caused mission failures in thirteen launches.\n\nFor the program to succeed, its proponents would have to defeat criticism from politicians both on the left (more money for social programs) and on the right (more money for the military). By emphasizing the scientific payoff and playing on fears of Soviet space dominance, Kennedy and Johnson managed to swing public opinion: by 1965, 58 percent of Americans favored Apollo, up from 33 percent two years earlier. After Johnson [[Assassination of President John F. Kennedy|became President in 1963]], his continuing defense of the program allowed it to succeed in 1969, as Kennedy had planned.\n\n=== Soviet strategy ===\n{{Main|Soviet crewed lunar programs{{!}}Soviet Moonshot}}\n\nSoviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] said in October 1963 the USSR was \"not at present planning flight by cosmonauts to the Moon,\" while insisting that the Soviets had not dropped out of the race. Only after another year would the USSR fully commit itself to a Moon-landing attempt, which ultimately failed.\n\nAt the same time, Kennedy had suggested various joint programs, including a possible Moon landing by Soviet and U.S. astronauts and the development of better weather-monitoring satellites. Khrushchev, sensing an attempt by Kennedy to steal Russian space technology, rejected the idea: if the USSR went to the Moon, it would go alone. [[Sergey Korolev]], the [[Soviet space program]]'s chief designer, had started promoting his [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] craft and the [[N1 (rocket)|N1]] launcher rocket that would have the capability of carrying out a human Moon landing.\n\nKhrushchev directed Korolev's design bureau to arrange further space firsts by modifying the existing Vostok technology, while a second team started building a completely new launcher and craft, the Proton booster and the Zond, for a human cislunar flight in 1966. In 1964 the new Soviet leadership gave Korolev the backing for a Moon landing effort and brought all crewed projects under his direction.\n\nWith Korolev's death and the failure of the first Soyuz flight in 1967, coordination of the Soviet Moon landing program quickly unraveled. The Soviets built a landing craft and selected cosmonauts for a mission that would have placed [[Alexei Leonov]] on the Moon's surface, but with the successive launch failures of the N1 booster in 1969, plans for a crewed landing suffered first delay and then cancellation.\n\nA program of automated return vehicles was begun, in the hope of being the first to return lunar rocks. This had several failures. It eventually succeeded with [[Luna 16]].<ref>[http://www.zarya.info/Diaries/Luna/Luna16.php The Mission of Luna 16]</ref> But this had little impact, because the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 lunar landings and rock returns had already taken place by then.\n\n=== Apollo missions ===\n[[File:Buzz salutes the U.S. Flag.jpg|thumb|right|Astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]], Lunar Module pilot of the first lunar landing mission, poses for a photograph beside the deployed [[Flag of the United States|United States flag]] during an Apollo 11 Extravehicular Activity (EVA) on the lunar surface.]]\n\nIn total, twenty-four U.S. astronauts have traveled to the Moon. Three have made the trip twice, and twelve have walked on its surface. Apollo 8 was a lunar-orbit-only mission, Apollo 10 included undocking and Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI), followed by LM staging to CSM redocking, while Apollo 13, originally scheduled as a landing, ended up as a lunar fly-by, by means of [[free return trajectory]]; thus, none of these missions made landings. Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were Earth-orbit-only missions. Apart from the inherent dangers of crewed Moon expeditions as seen with Apollo 13, one reason for their cessation according to astronaut [[Alan Bean]] is the cost it imposes in government subsidies.<ref>{{Cite web|title=In the Shadow of the Moon|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=37065|publisher=comingsoon.net|accessdate=7 February 2008}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Human Moon landings ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!Mission name\n!Lunar lander\n! width=\"11%\" |Lunar landing date\n! width=\"11%\" |Lunar liftoff date\n! width=\"12%\" |Lunar landing site\n!Duration on lunar surface (DD:HH:MM)\n! width=\"25%\" |Crew\n!Number of [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVAs]]\n!Total EVA Time (HH:MM)\n|-\n||[[Apollo 11]]\n||''Eagle''\n| align=\"right\" |20 July 1969\n| align=\"right\" |21 July 1969\n||[[Mare Tranquillitatis|Sea of Tranquility]]\n||0:21:31\n||[[Neil Armstrong]], [[Buzz Aldrin|Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin]]\n||1\n||2:31\n|-\n||[[Apollo 12]]\n||''Intrepid''\n| align=\"right\" |19 November 1969\n| align=\"right\" |21 November 1969\n||[[Oceanus Procellarum|Ocean of Storms]]\n||1:07:31\n||[[Pete Conrad|Charles \"Pete\" Conrad]], [[Alan Bean]]\n||2\n||7:45\n|-\n||[[Apollo 14]]\n||''Antares''\n| align=\"right\" |5 February 1971\n| align=\"right\" |6 February 1971\n||[[Fra Mauro formation|Fra Mauro]]\n||1:09:30\n||[[Alan Shepard|Alan B.

Launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on a Falcon 9 booster, with the lander being one of three payloads on the rocket. Beresheet arrived near the Moon using a slow but fuel-efficient trajectory. Taking six weeks and several increasingly large orbits around the Earth, it first achieved a large elliptical orbit around Earth with an apogee near {{convert|400000|km|sp=us}}. At that point, with a short deceleration burn, it was caught by the Moon's gravity in a highly elliptical lunar orbit, an orbit which was circularized and reduced in diameter over a week's time, before attempting a landing on the Moon's surface on 11 April 2019. The mission was the first Israeli, and the first privately funded, lunar landing attempt.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/israeli-start-aims-put-first-private-space-probe-moon-ncna971556 |title=First privately funded lunar landing |publisher=NBC News}}</ref> SpaceIL was originally conceived in 2011 as a venture to pursue the [[Google Lunar X Prize]]. On 11 April 2019 ''Beresheet'' crashed on the surface of the Moon, as a result of a main engine failure in the final descent. The ''Beresheet'' lunar lander's target landing destination was within Mare Serenitatis, a vast volcanic basin on the Moon's northern near side. Despite the failure, the mission represents the closest a private entity has come to a soft lunar landing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/04/spaceil-beresheet-first-privately-funded-israeli-spacecraft-crash-lands-on-moon/|title=First privately funded moon lander crash-lands|date=2019-04-11|website=Science & Innovation|access-date=2019-04-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Chandrayaan 2 (India) ===\n[[ISRO]], the Indian National Space agency, launched [[Chandrayaan 2]] on 22 July 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48919572|title=India announces new date for space launch|publisher=BBC News|date=2019-07-18|access-date=2019-07-21|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/india-moon-mission-set-to-launch-a-week-after-it-was-aborted/2019/07/22/d599087e-ac45-11e9-9411-a608f9d0c2d3_story.html |title=India moon mission set to launch a week after it was aborted |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2019-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190722073652/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/india-moon-mission-set-to-launch-a-week-after-it-was-aborted/2019/07/22/d599087e-ac45-11e9-9411-a608f9d0c2d3_story.html |archive-date=2019-07-22}}</ref> It has 3 major modules: Orbiter, Lander and Rover.

All [[Soft landing (aeronautics)|soft landings]] took place on the [[near side of the Moon]] until 3 January 2019, when the Chinese [[Chang'e 4]] spacecraft made the first landing on the [[far side of the Moon]].<ref name =\"far side of the moon\">{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/c4dc6858a32b4b61bdbc6aebf5459a91|title=Chinese spacecraft makes first landing on moon's far side|date=2019-01-03|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>\n\n== Uncrewed landings ==\nAfter the unsuccessful attempt by [[Luna 1]] to land on the Moon in 1959, the [[Soviet Union]] performed the first hard Moon landing \u2013 \"hard\" meaning the spacecraft intentionally crashes into the Moon \u2013 later that same year with the [[Luna 2]] spacecraft, a feat the U.S. duplicated in 1962 with [[Ranger 4]]. Since then, twelve Soviet and U.S. spacecraft have used braking rockets ([[retrorocket]]s) to make [[Soft landing (aeronautics)|soft landings]] and perform scientific operations on the lunar surface, between 1966 and 1976. In 1966 the USSR accomplished the first soft landings and took the first pictures from the lunar surface during the [[Luna 9]] and [[Luna 13]] missions. The U.S. followed with five uncrewed [[Surveyor Program|Surveyor]] soft landings.\n\nThe Soviet Union achieved the first uncrewed lunar soil [[sample return mission|sample return]] with the [[Luna 16]] probe on 24 September 1970. This was followed by [[Luna 20]] and [[Luna 24]] in 1972 and 1976, respectively. Following the failure at launch in 1969 of the first [[Lunokhod]], [[Luna E-8 No.201]], the [[Luna 17]] and [[Luna 21]] were successful uncrewed [[lunar rover]] missions in 1970 and 1973.\n\nMany missions were failures at launch. In addition, several uncrewed landing missions achieved the Lunar surface but were unsuccessful, including: [[Luna 15]], [[Luna 18]], and [[Luna 23]] all crashed on landing; and the U.S. [[Surveyor 4]] lost all radio contact only moments before its landing.\n\nMore recently, other nations have crashed spacecraft on the surface of the Moon at speeds of around {{convert|8000|km/h}}, often at precise, planned locations. These have generally been end-of-life lunar orbiters that, because of system degradations, could no longer overcome [[lunar orbit#Perturbation effects|perturbations]] from lunar [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentrations]] (\"masscons\") to maintain their orbit. Japan's lunar orbiter [[Hiten]] impacted the Moon's surface on 10 April 1993. The [[European Space Agency]] performed a controlled crash impact with their orbiter [[SMART-1]] on 3 September 2006.\n\n[[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO) performed a controlled crash impact with its [[Moon Impact Probe]] (MIP) on 14 November 2008. The MIP was an ejected probe from the Indian [[Chandrayaan-1]] lunar orbiter and performed [[remote sensing]] experiments during its descent to the lunar surface.\n\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter [[Chang'e 1]] executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009. The rover mission [[Chang'e 3]] soft-landed on 14 December 2013, as did its successor, [[Chang'e 4]], on 3 January 2019. All crewed and uncrewed [[Soft landing (rocketry)|soft landings]] had taken place on the [[near side of the Moon]], until 3 January 2019 when the Chinese [[Chang'e 4]] spacecraft made the first landing on the [[far side of the Moon]].<ref name =\"far side of the moon\"/>\n\nOn 22 February 2019, Israeli private space agency [[SpaceIL]] launched spacecraft [[Beresheet]] on board a Falcon 9 from Cape Canaveral, Florida with the intention of achieving a soft landing.

This was accomplished with two US pilot-astronauts flying a [[Lunar Module]] on each of six [[NASA]] missions across a 41-month period starting 20 July 1969, with [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] on [[Apollo 11]], and ending on 14 December 1972 with [[Gene Cernan]] and [[Jack Schmitt]] on [[Apollo 17]]. Cernan was the last man to step off the lunar surface.\n\nAll Apollo lunar missions had a third crew member who remained on board the [[Apollo command module|command module]]. The last three missions included a drivable lunar rover, the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]], for increased mobility.\n\n== Scientific background ==\nTo get to the Moon, a spacecraft must first leave Earth's [[gravity well]]; currently, the only practical means is a [[rocket]]. Unlike airborne vehicles such as [[Balloon (aeronautics)|balloons]] and [[jet aircraft|jets]], a rocket can continue [[acceleration|accelerating]] in the [[vacuum]] outside the [[atmosphere]].\n\nUpon approach of the target moon, a spacecraft will be drawn ever closer to its surface at increasing speeds due to gravity. In order to land intact it must decelerate to less than about {{convert|160|km/h}} and be ruggedized to withstand a \"hard landing\" impact, or it must decelerate to negligible speed at contact for a \"soft landing\" (the only option for humans). The first three attempts by the U.S. to perform a successful hard Moon landing with a ruggedized [[seismometer]] package in 1962 all failed.<ref name=\"nasa-ranger3\">{{cite web| url= https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1962-012A|title=NASA \u2013 NSSDC \u2013 Spacecraft \u2013 Ranger 3 Details| accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> The Soviets first achieved the milestone of a hard lunar landing with a ruggedized camera in 1966, followed only months later by the first uncrewed soft lunar landing by the U.S.\n\nThe speed of a crash landing on its surface is typically between 70 and 100% of the [[escape velocity]] of the target moon, and thus this is the total velocity which must be shed from the target moon's gravitational attraction for a soft landing to occur. For Earth's Moon, the escape velocity is {{convert| 2.38|km/s}}.<ref name=\"GgLunarXPrize-MoonInfo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/lunar/education/learning-guides/escape-from-the-moon|title=Escape from the Moon!|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> The change in velocity (referred to as a [[delta-v]]) is usually provided by a landing rocket, which must be carried into space by the original [[launch vehicle]] as part of the overall spacecraft. An exception is the soft moon landing on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] carried out by the [[Huygens (spacecraft)|''Huygens'' probe]] in 2005. As the moon with the thickest atmosphere, landings on Titan may be accomplished by using [[atmospheric entry]] techniques that are generally lighter in weight than a rocket with equivalent capability.\n\nThe Soviets succeeded in making the first crash landing on the Moon in 1959.<ref name=\"nasa-luna2\">{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1959-014A|title=NASA \u2013 NSSDC \u2013 Spacecraft \u2013 Lun 2 Details|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> Crash landings<ref name=\"hard-landing\">{{cite web| url= http://www.aai.ee/~vladislav/program_yft0060.html| title= Homepage of V.V Pustynski for students of YFT0060| publisher= [[Tartu Observatory]]| location= Estonia| accessdate= 17 February 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl= https://archive.today/20121218012317/http://www.aai.ee/~vladislav/program_yft0060.html| archivedate= 18 December 2012| df= dmy-all}}</ref> may occur because of malfunctions in a spacecraft, or they can be deliberately arranged for vehicles which do not have an onboard landing rocket. There have been [[list of artificial objects on the Moon|many such Moon crashes]], often with their flight path controlled to impact at precise locations on the lunar surface. For example, during the Apollo program the [[S-IVB]] third stage of the [[Saturn V]] rocket as well as the spent ascent stage of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] were deliberately crashed on the Moon several times to provide impacts registering as a [[Quake (natural phenomenon)#Moonquake|moonquake]] on [[seismometer]]s that had been left on the lunar surface. Such crashes were instrumental in mapping the [[internal structure of the Moon]].\n\nTo return to Earth, the escape velocity of the Moon must be overcome for the spacecraft to escape the [[gravity well]] of the Moon. Rockets must be used to leave the Moon and return to space. Upon reaching Earth, atmospheric entry techniques are used to absorb the [[kinetic energy]] of a returning spacecraft and reduce its speed for safe landing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These functions greatly complicate a moon landing mission and lead to many additional operational considerations. Any moon departure rocket must first be carried to the Moon's surface by a moon landing rocket, increasing the latter's required size. The Moon departure rocket, larger moon landing rocket and any Earth atmosphere entry equipment such as heat shields and [[parachute]]s must in turn be lifted by the original launch vehicle, greatly increasing its size by a significant and almost prohibitive degree.\n\n== Political background ==\n{{Main|Space Race}}\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{Tone|section|date=January 2016}}\n{{Importance section|date=January 2016}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2013}}}}\nThe intense efforts devoted in the 1960s to achieving first an uncrewed and then ultimately a human Moon landing become easier to understand in the political context of its historical era. [[World War II]] had introduced many new and deadly innovations including [[blitzkrieg]]-style surprise attacks used in the [[invasion of Poland]] and in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]; the [[V-2 rocket]], a [[ballistic missile]] which killed thousands in attacks on London and [[Antwerp]]; and the [[atom bomb]], which killed hundreds of thousands in the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. In the 1950s, tensions mounted between the two ideologically opposed superpowers of the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] that had emerged as victors in the conflict, particularly after the development by both countries of the [[hydrogen bomb]].\n[[File:Luna 3 moon.jpg|left|thumb|The first image of another world from space, returned by Luna 3, showed the far side of the Moon in October 1959.]]\n[[Willy Ley]] wrote in 1957 that a rocket to the Moon \"could be built later this year if somebody can be found to sign some papers\".<ref name=\"ley195707\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1957-07/Galaxy_1957_07#page/n61/mode/2up | title=For Your Information | work=Galaxy Science Fiction | date=July 1957 | accessdate=11 June 2014 | author=Ley, Willy | number=61\u201371|p=69}}</ref> On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union [[Rocket launch|launched]] ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' as the first [[artificial satellite]] to orbit the Earth and so initiated the [[Space Race]]. This unexpected event was a source of pride to the Soviets and shock to the U.S., who could now potentially be surprise attacked by nuclear-tipped Soviet rockets in under 30 minutes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Also, the steady beeping of the [[radio beacon]] aboard ''Sputnik 1'' as it passed overhead every 96 minutes was widely viewed on both sides{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} as effective propaganda to [[Third World]] countries demonstrating the technological superiority of the Soviet [[political system]] compared to that of the U.S. This perception was reinforced by a string of subsequent rapid-fire Soviet space achievements. In 1959, the R-7 rocket was used to launch the first escape from Earth's gravity into a [[solar orbit]], the first crash impact onto the surface of the Moon, and the first photography of the never-before-seen [[far side of the Moon]]. These were the [[Luna 1]], [[Luna 2]], and [[Luna 3]] spacecraft.\n\n[[File:Lunar Lander Model.jpg|right|thumb|A 1963 conceptual model of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Apollo Lunar Excursion Module]]]]\nThe U.S. response to these Soviet achievements was to greatly accelerate previously existing military space and missile projects and to create a civilian space agency, [[NASA]]. Military efforts were initiated to develop and produce mass quantities of intercontinental ballistic missiles ([[ICBMs]]) that would bridge the so-called [[missile gap]] and enable a policy of [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]] to [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] with the Soviets known as [[mutual assured destruction]] or MAD. These newly developed [[missile]]s were made available to civilians of NASA for various projects (which would have the added benefit of demonstrating the payload, guidance accuracy and reliabilities of U.S. ICBMs to the Soviets).\n\nWhile NASA stressed peaceful and scientific uses for these rockets, their use in various lunar exploration efforts also had secondary goal of realistic, goal-oriented testing of the missiles themselves and development of associated infrastructure,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} just as the Soviets were doing with their R-7.\n\n== Early Soviet uncrewed lunar missions (1958\u20131965) ==\n\nAfter the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, historical records were released to allow the true accounting of Soviet lunar efforts. Unlike the U.S. tradition of assigning a particular mission name in advance of a launch, the Soviets assigned a public \"[[Luna programme|Luna]]\" mission number only if a launch resulted in a spacecraft going beyond Earth orbit. The policy had the effect of hiding Soviet Moon mission failures from public view. If the attempt failed in Earth orbit before departing for the Moon, it was frequently (but not always) given a \"[[Sputnik programme|Sputnik]]\" or \"[[Cosmos (satellite)|Cosmos]]\" Earth-orbit mission number to hide its purpose. Launch explosions were not acknowledged at all.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n! align=left | Mission\n! align=center | Mass (kg)\n! align=center | Launch vehicle\n! align=center | Launch date\n! align=center | Goal\n! align=center | Result\n|-\n|\n|\n| [[Semyorka]] \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 23 September 1958\n| Impact\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction at T+ 93 s\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 12 October 1958\n| Impact\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction at T+ 104 s\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 4 December 1958\n| Impact\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction at T+ 254 s\n|-\n| [[Luna 1|Luna-1]]\n| 361\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 2 January 1959\n| Impact\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">Partial success</span> \u2013 first spacecraft to reach escape velocity, lunar flyby, solar orbit; missed the Moon\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 18 June 1959\n| Impact\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction at T+ 153 s\n|-\n| [[Luna 2|Luna-2]]\n| 390\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 12 September 1959\n| Impact\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 first lunar impact\n|-\n| [[Luna 3|Luna-3]]\n| 270\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 4 October 1959\n| Flyby\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 first photos of lunar far side\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 15 April 1960\n| Flyby\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 16 April 1960\n| Flyby\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction at T+ 1 s\n|-\n| [[Sputnik]]-25\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 4 January 1963\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 stranded in low Earth orbit\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 3 February 1963\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction at T+ 105 s\n|-\n| [[Luna 4|Luna-4]]\n| 1422\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 2 April 1963\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 lunar flyby at {{convert|8000|km|mi}}\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 21 March 1964\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 20 April 1964\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n| [[Cosmos (satellite)|Cosmos]]-60\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 12 March 1965\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 stranded in low Earth orbit\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 10 April 1965\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n| [[Luna 5|Luna-5]]\n| 1475\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 9 May 1965\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 lunar impact\n|-\n| [[Luna 6|Luna-6]]\n| 1440\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 8 June 1965\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 lunar flyby at {{convert|160000|km|mi}}\n|-\n| [[Luna 7|Luna-7]]\n| 1504\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 4 October 1965\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 lunar impact\n|-\n| [[Luna 8|Luna-8]]\n| 1550\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 3 December 1965\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 lunar impact during landing attempt\n|-\n|}\n\n== Early U.S. uncrewed lunar missions (1958\u20131965) ==\n{{essay-like|section|date=September 2019}}\n[[File:Ranger 9 sudden impact.gif|thumb|right|Artist's portrayal of a Ranger spacecraft right before impact]]\n[[File:Ranger8-moon.jpg|thumb|right|One of the last photos of the Moon transmitted by Ranger 8 right before impact]]\n\nIn contrast to Soviet lunar exploration triumphs in 1959, success eluded initial U.S. efforts to reach the Moon with the [[Pioneer program|Pioneer]] and [[Ranger program]]s.

The first, a mission managed by the [[United States Air Force]], exploded during launch; all subsequent Pioneer lunar flights had NASA as the lead management organization. The next two returned to Earth and burned up upon reentry into the atmosphere after achieved maximum altitudes of around {{convert|110,000|km|mi}} and {{convert|1450|km|mi|}}, far short of the roughly {{convert|400000|km|mi}} required to reach the vicinity of the Moon.\n\nNASA then collaborated with the [[United States Army]]'s [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency|Ballistic Missile Agency]] to fly two extremely small cone-shaped probes on the [[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]] ICBM, carrying only [[photocells]] which would be triggered by the light of the Moon and a lunar radiation environment experiment using a [[Geiger-M\u00fcller tube]] detector. The first of these reached an altitude of only around {{convert| 100000|km|mi}}, serendipitously gathering data that established the presence of the [[Van Allen radiation belts]] before reentering Earth's atmosphere. The second passed by the Moon at a distance of more than {{convert|60000|km|mi}}, twice as far as planned and too far away to trigger either of the on-board scientific instruments, yet still becoming the first U.S. spacecraft to reach a [[solar orbit]].\n\nThe final Pioneer lunar probe design consisted of four \"[[paddlewheel]]\" [[Photovoltaic module|solar panels]] extending from a one-meter diameter spherical [[Spin-stabilized satellite|spin-stabilized]] spacecraft body equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television-like system, estimate the Moon's mass and topography of the [[Peak of Eternal Light|poles]], record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites, study radiation, measure [[Magnetic field of celestial bodies|magnetic fields]], detect [[Alfv\u00e9n wave|low frequency electromagnetic waves]] in space and use a sophisticated integrated [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] system for maneuvering and orbit insertion as well. None of the four spacecraft built in this series of probes survived launch on its [[Atlas (missile)|Atlas]] ICBM outfitted with an Able upper stage.\n\nFollowing the unsuccessful Atlas-Able Pioneer probes, NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] embarked upon an uncrewed spacecraft development program whose modular design could be used to support both lunar and interplanetary exploration missions. The interplanetary versions were known as [[Mariner program|Mariners]]; lunar versions were [[Ranger program|Rangers]]. JPL envisioned three versions of the Ranger lunar probes: Block I prototypes, which would carry various radiation detectors in test flights to a very high Earth orbit that came nowhere near the Moon; Block II, which would try to accomplish the first Moon landing by hard landing a seismometer package; and Block III, which would crash onto the lunar surface without any braking rockets while taking very high resolution wide-area photographs of the Moon during their descent.\n\n=== Ranger missions ===\n{{See also|Ranger program}}\nThe Ranger 1 and 2 Block I missions were virtually identical.<ref name=\"nasa-ranger1\">{{cite web| url= https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1961-021A|title=NASA \u2013 NSSDC \u2013 Spacecraft \u2013 Ranger 1 Details|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"nasa-ranger2\">{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1961-032A|title=NASA \u2013 NSSDC \u2013 Spacecraft \u2013 Ranger 2 Details|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> Spacecraft experiments included a [[H-alpha|Lyman-alpha]] telescope, a [[rubidium|rubidium-vapor]] [[magnetometer]], electrostatic analyzers, medium-energy-range [[particle detector]]s, two triple coincidence telescopes, a cosmic-ray integrating [[ionization chamber]], [[cosmic dust]] detectors, and [[scintillation counter]]s. The goal was to place these Block I spacecraft in a very high Earth orbit with an apogee of {{convert|110000|km|mi}} and a [[perigee]] of {{convert|60000|km|mi}}.<ref name=\"nasa-ranger1\"/>\n\nFrom that vantage point, scientists could make direct measurements of the [[magnetosphere]] over a period of many months while engineers perfected new methods to routinely track and communicate with spacecraft over such large distances. Such practice was deemed vital to be assured of capturing high-bandwidth television transmissions from the Moon during a one-shot fifteen-minute time window in subsequent Block II and Block III lunar descents. Both Block I missions suffered failures of the new Agena upper stage and never left low Earth [[parking orbit]] after launch; both burned up upon reentry after only a few days.\n\nThe first attempts to perform a Moon landing took place in 1962 during the Rangers 3, 4 and 5 missions flown by the United States.<ref name=\"nasa-ranger3\"/><ref name=\"nasa-ranger4\"/><ref name=\"nasa-ranger5\"/> All three Block II missions basic vehicles were 3.1&nbsp;m high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered with a balsa wood impact-limiter, 650&nbsp;mm in diameter, a mono-propellant mid-course motor, a retrorocket with a thrust of {{convert|5050|lbf|kN}},<ref name=\"nasa-ranger4\"/> and a gold- and chrome-plated hexagonal base 1.5&nbsp;m in diameter. This lander (code-named ''Tonto'') was designed to provide impact cushioning using an exterior blanket of crushable balsa wood and an interior filled with incompressible liquid [[freon]]. A 42&nbsp;kg (56 pounds) {{convert|30|cm|ft|adj=mid|-diameter}} metal payload sphere floated and was free to rotate in a liquid freon reservoir contained in the landing sphere.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote=\"Everything that we do ought to really be tied-in to getting onto the Moon ahead of the Russians. ...We're ready to spend reasonable amounts of money, but we're talking about fantastic expenditures which wreck our budget and all these other domestic programs, and the only justification for it, in my opinion, to do it is because we hope to beat them and demonstrate that starting behind, as we did by a couple of years, by God, we passed them.\"|source=\u2014 [[John F.

Webb|James Webb]], NASA Deputy Administrator [[Robert Seamans]], and Special Assistant to the President [[Jerome Wiesner]] / Nov 1962, minutes 2:58\u2013ff.</ref>}}\nThis payload sphere contained six silver-[[cadmium]] batteries to power a fifty-milliwatt radio transmitter, a temperature sensitive voltage controlled oscillator to measure lunar surface temperatures, and a seismometer designed with sensitivity high enough to detect the impact of a {{convert|5|lb|kg|abbr=on}} meteorite on the opposite side of the Moon. Weight was distributed in the payload sphere so it would rotate in its liquid blanket to place the seismometer into an upright and operational position no matter what the final resting orientation of the external landing sphere. After landing, plugs were to be opened allowing the freon to evaporate and the payload sphere to settle into upright contact with the landing sphere. The batteries were sized to allow up to three months of operation for the payload sphere. Various mission constraints limited the landing site to Oceanus Procellarum on the lunar equator, which the lander ideally would reach 66 hours after launch.\n\nNo cameras were carried by the Ranger landers, and no pictures were to be captured from the lunar surface during the mission. Instead, the {{convert|3.1|m|ft}} Ranger Block II mother ship carried a 200-scan-line television camera which was to capture images during the free-fall descent to the lunar surface. The camera was designed to transmit a picture every 10 seconds.<ref name=\"nasa-ranger4\"/> Seconds before impact, at {{convert|5|and|0.6|km|mi}} above the lunar surface, the Ranger mother ships took picture (which may be viewed [http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/ranger.html here]).\n\nOther instruments gathering data before the mother ship crashed onto the Moon were a gamma ray spectrometer to measure overall lunar chemical composition and a radar altimeter. The radar altimeter was to give a signal ejecting the landing capsule and its solid-fueled braking rocket overboard from the Block II mother ship. The braking rocket was to slow and the landing sphere to a dead stop at {{convert|330|m|ft}} above the surface and separate, allowing the landing sphere to free fall once more and hit the surface.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nOn Ranger 3, failure of the Atlas guidance system and a software error aboard the Agena upper stage combined to put the spacecraft on a course that would miss the Moon. Attempts to salvage lunar photography during a flyby of the Moon were thwarted by in-flight failure of the onboard flight computer. This was probably because of prior [[sterilization (microbiology)|heat sterilization]] of the spacecraft by keeping it above the [[boiling]] point of water for 24 hours on the ground, to protect the Moon from being contaminated by Earth organisms. Heat sterilization was also blamed for subsequent in-flight failures of the spacecraft computer on Ranger 4 and the power subsystem on Ranger 5. Only Ranger 4 reached the Moon in an uncontrolled crash impact on the far side of the Moon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nHeat sterilization was discontinued for the final four Block III Ranger probes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These replaced the Block II landing capsule and its retrorocket with a heavier, more capable television system to support landing site selection for upcoming Apollo crewed Moon landing missions. Six cameras were designed to take thousands of high-altitude photographs in the final twenty-minute period before crashing on the lunar surface. Camera resolution was 1,132 scan lines, far higher than the 525 lines found in a typical U.S. 1964 home television. While [[Ranger 6]] suffered a failure of this camera system and returned no photographs despite an otherwise successful flight, the subsequent [[Ranger 7]] mission to Mare Cognitum was a complete success.\n\nBreaking the six-year string of failures in U.S. attempts to photograph the Moon at close range, the [[Ranger 7]] mission was viewed as a national turning point and instrumental in allowing the key 1965 NASA budget appropriation to pass through the [[United States Congress]] intact without a reduction in funds for the Apollo crewed Moon landing program. Subsequent successes with [[Ranger 8]] and [[Ranger 9]] further buoyed U.S. hopes.\n\n== Soviet uncrewed soft landings (1966\u20131976) ==\n[[File:\u041b\u0443\u043d\u0430-16.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Model of Luna 16 Moon soil sample return lander]]\n[[File:Soviet moonrover.JPG|thumb|right|Model of Soviet Lunokhod automatic Moon rover]]\nThe [[Luna 9]] spacecraft, launched by the [[Soviet Union]], performed the first successful soft Moon landing on 3 February 1966.

They removed parts of it for examination back on Earth to determine the effects of long-term exposure to the lunar environment.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse; \"\n|-\n! align=left | Mission\n! align=center | Mass (kg)\n! align=center | Booster\n! align=center | Launch date\n! align=center | Goal\n! align=center | Result\n! align=center | Landing zone\n! align=center | [[Latitude|Lat]]/[[Longitude|Lon]]\n|-\n| [[Surveyor 1]]\n| 292\n| [[Atlas (rocket)|Atlas]] \u2013 [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]]\n| 30 May 1966\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 11,000 pictures returned, first U.S. Moon landing\n| [[Oceanus Procellarum]]\n| 002.45S 043.22W\n|-\n| [[Surveyor 2]]\n| 292\n| Atlas \u2013 Centaur\n| 20 September 1966\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 midcourse engine malfunction, placing vehicle in unrecoverable tumble; crashed southeast of Copernicus Crater\n| [[Sinus Medii]]\n| 004.00S 011.00W\n|-\n| [[Surveyor 3]]\n| 302\n| Atlas \u2013 Centaur\n| 20 April 1967\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 6,000 pictures returned; trench dug to 17.5&nbsp;cm depth after 18&nbsp;hr of robot arm use\n| Oceanus Procellarum\n| 002.94S 336.66E\n|-\n| [[Surveyor 4]]\n| 282\n| Atlas \u2013 Centaur\n| 14 July 1967\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 radio contact lost 2.5 minutes before touchdown; perfect automated Moon landing possible but outcome unknown\n| Sinus Medii\n| unknown\n|-\n| [[Surveyor 5]]\n| 303\n| Atlas \u2013 Centaur\n| 8 September 1967\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 19,000 photos returned, first use of alpha scatter soil composition monitor\n| [[Mare Tranquillitatis]]\n| 001.41N 023.18E\n|-\n| [[Surveyor 6]]\n| 300\n| Atlas \u2013 Centaur\n| 7 November 1967\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 30,000 photos returned, robot arm and alpha scatter science, engine restart, second landing 2.5&nbsp;m away from first\n| Sinus Medii\n| 000.46N 358.63E\n|-\n| [[Surveyor 7]]\n| 306\n| Atlas \u2013 Centaur\n| 7 January 1968\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 21,000 photos returned; robot arm and alpha scatter science; laser beams from Earth detected\n| [[Tycho (crater)|Tycho Crater]]\n| 041.01S 348.59E\n|-\n|}\n\n== Transition from direct ascent landings to lunar orbit operations ==\nWithin four months of each other in early 1966 the Soviet Union and the United States had accomplished successful Moon landings with uncrewed spacecraft. To the general public both countries had demonstrated roughly equal technical capabilities by returning photographic images from the surface of the Moon. These pictures provided a key affirmative answer to the crucial question of whether or not lunar soil would support upcoming crewed landers with their much greater weight.\n\nHowever, the Luna 9 hard landing of a ruggedized sphere using airbags at a {{convert|50|kph|adj=on}} ballistic impact speed had much more in common with the failed 1962 Ranger landing attempts and their planned {{convert|160|kph|adj=on}} impacts than with the Surveyor 1 soft landing on three footpads using its radar-controlled, adjustable-thrust retrorocket. While Luna 9 and Surveyor 1 were both major national accomplishments, only Surveyor 1 had reached its landing site employing key technologies that would be needed for a crewed flight. Thus as of mid-1966, the United States had begun to pull ahead of the Soviet Union in the so-called Space Race to land a man on the Moon.\n\n[[File:Space Race 1957-1975 black text.png|thumb|450px|A timeline of the space race between 1957 and 1975, with missions from the US and USSR.]]\n\nAdvances in other areas were necessary before crewed spacecraft could follow uncrewed ones to the surface of the Moon. Of particular importance was developing the expertise to perform flight operations in lunar orbit. Ranger, Surveyor and initial Luna Moon landing attempts all flew directly to the surface without a lunar orbit. Such [[direct ascent]]s use a minimum amount of fuel for uncrewed spacecraft on a one-way trip.\n\nIn contrast, crewed vehicles need additional fuel after a lunar landing to enable a return trip back to Earth for the crew. Leaving this massive amount of required Earth-return fuel in lunar orbit until it is used later in the mission is far more efficient than taking such fuel down to the lunar surface in a Moon landing and then hauling it all back into space yet again, working against lunar gravity both ways. Such considerations lead logically to a [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] mission profile for a crewed Moon landing.\n\nAccordingly, beginning in mid-1966 both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. naturally progressed into missions featuring lunar orbit as a prerequisite to a crewed Moon landing. The primary goals of these initial uncrewed orbiters were extensive photographic mapping of the entire lunar surface for the selection of crewed landing sites and, for the Soviets, the checkout of radio communications gear that would be used in future soft landings.\n\nAn unexpected major discovery from initial lunar orbiters were vast volumes of dense materials beneath the surface of the Moon's [[lunar maria|maria]]. Such mass concentrations (\"[[mass concentration (astronomy)|mascons]]\") can send a crewed mission dangerously off course in the final minutes of a Moon landing when aiming for a relatively small landing zone that is smooth and safe. Mascons were also found over a longer period of time to greatly disturb the orbits of low-altitude satellites around the Moon, making their orbits unstable and forcing an inevitable crash on the lunar surface in the relatively short period of months to a few years.\n\nControlling the location of impact for spent lunar orbiters can have scientific value. For example, in 1999 the NASA [[Lunar Prospector]] orbiter was deliberately targeted to impact a permanently shadowed area of Shoemaker Crater near the lunar south pole. It was hoped that energy from the impact would vaporize suspected shadowed ice deposits in the crater and liberate a water vapor plume detectable from Earth. No such plume was observed. However, a small vial of ashes from the body of pioneer lunar scientist [[Eugene Shoemaker]] was delivered by the Lunar Prospector to the crater named in his honor \u2013 currently{{when|date=September 2019}} the only human remains on the Moon.\n\n== Soviet lunar orbit satellites (1966\u20131974) ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n\n! align=center | U.S.S.R. mission\n! align=center | Mass (kg)\n! align=center | Booster\n! align=center | Launched\n! align=center | Mission goal\n! align=center | Mission result\n|-\n| Cosmos \u2013 111\n|\n| [[Molniya-M]]\n| align=\"right\" | 1 March 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 stranded in low Earth orbit\n|-\n| [[Luna 10|Luna-10]]\n| 1,582\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 31 March 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 2,738&nbsp;km x 2,088&nbsp;km x 72 deg orbit, 178&nbsp;m period, 60-day science mission\n|-\n| [[Luna 11|Luna-11]]\n| 1,640\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 24 August 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 2,931&nbsp;km x 1,898&nbsp;km x 27 deg orbit, 178&nbsp;m period, 38-day science mission\n|-\n| [[Luna 12|Luna-12]]\n| 1,620\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 22 October 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 2,938&nbsp;km x 1,871&nbsp;km x 10 deg orbit, 205&nbsp;m period, 89-day science mission\n|-\n| Cosmos-159\n| 1,700\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 17 May 1967\n| Prototype test\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 high Earth orbit crewed landing communications gear radio calibration test\n|-\n|\n|\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 7 February 1968\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit \u2013 attempted radio calibration test?\n|-\n| [[Luna 14|Luna-14]]\n| 1,700\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 7 April 1968\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 870&nbsp;km x 160&nbsp;km x 42 deg orbit, 160&nbsp;m period, unstable orbit, radio calibration test?\n|-\n| [[Luna 19|Luna-19]]\n| 5,700\n| [[Proton rocket|Proton]]\n| align=\"right\" | 28 September 1971\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 140&nbsp;km x 140&nbsp;km x 41 deg orbit, 121&nbsp;m period, 388-day science mission\n|-\n| [[Luna 22|Luna-22]]\n| 5,700\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 29 May 1974\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 222&nbsp;km x 219&nbsp;km x 19 deg orbit, 130&nbsp;m period, 521-day science mission\n|-\n|}\n\n[[Luna 10]] became the first spacecraft to orbit the Moon on 3 April 1966.\n\n== U.S. lunar orbit satellites (1966\u20131967) ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n! align=left | U.S. mission\n! align=center | Mass (kg)\n! align=center | Booster\n! align=center | Launched\n! align=center | Mission goal\n! align=center | Mission result\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 1]]\n| 386\n| [[Atlas (missile)|Atlas]] \u2013 [[RM-81 Agena|Agena]]\n| align=\"right\" | 10 August 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 1,160&nbsp;km X 189&nbsp;km x 12 deg orbit, 208&nbsp;m period, 80-day photography mission\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 2]]\n| 386\n| Atlas \u2013 Agena\n| align=\"right\" | 6 November 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 1,860&nbsp;km X 52&nbsp;km x 12 deg orbit, 208&nbsp;m period, 339-day photography mission\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 3]]\n| 386\n| Atlas \u2013 Agena\n| align=\"right\" | 5 February 1967\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 1,860&nbsp;km X 52&nbsp;km x 21 deg orbit, 208&nbsp;m period, 246-day photography mission\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 4]]\n| 386\n| Atlas \u2013 Agena\n| align=\"right\" | 4 May 1967\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 6,111&nbsp;km X 2,706&nbsp;km x 86 deg orbit, 721&nbsp;m period, 180-day photography mission\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 5]]\n| 386\n| Atlas \u2013 Agena\n| align=\"right\" | 1 August 1967\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 6,023&nbsp;km X 195&nbsp;km x 85 deg orbit, 510&nbsp;m period, 183-day photography mission\n|-\n|}\n\n== Soviet circumlunar loop flights (1967\u20131970) ==\n{{Main|Soviet crewed lunar programs}}\n[[File:Zond Assembly.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Zond program|Zond]] mounted on top stage of Proton booster in assembly hangar]]\nIt is possible to aim a spacecraft from Earth so it will loop around the Moon and return to Earth without entering lunar orbit, following the so-called [[free return trajectory]]. Such circumlunar loop missions are simpler than lunar orbit missions because rockets for lunar orbit braking and Earth return are not required. However, a crewed circumlunar loop trip poses significant challenges beyond those found in a crewed low-Earth-orbit mission, offering valuable lessons in preparation for a crewed Moon landing. Foremost among these are mastering the demands of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere upon returning from the Moon.\n\nInhabited Earth-orbiting vehicles such as the Space Shuttle return to Earth from speeds of around {{convert|27000|km/h|m/s|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Due to the effects of gravity, a vehicle returning from the Moon hits Earth's atmosphere at a much higher speed of around {{convert|40000|km/h|m/s|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The [[g-force|g-loading]] on astronauts during the resulting [[acceleration|deceleration]] can be at the limits of human endurance even during a nominal reentry. Slight variations in the vehicle flight path and reentry angle during a return from the Moon can easily result in fatal levels of deceleration force.\n\nAchieving a crewed circumlunar loop flight prior to a crewed lunar landing became a primary goal of the Soviets with their [[Zond program|Zond]] spacecraft program. The first three Zonds were robotic planetary probes; after that, the Zond name was transferred to a completely separate human spaceflight program. The initial focus of these later Zonds was extensive testing of required high-speed reentry techniques. This focus was not shared by the U.S., who chose instead to bypass the stepping stone of a crewed circumlunar loop mission and never developed a separate spacecraft for this purpose.\n\nInitial crewed spaceflights in the early 1960s placed a single person in low Earth orbit during the Soviet [[Vostok programme|Vostok]] and U.S. [[Mercury program|Mercury]] programs. A two-flight extension of the Vostok program known as [[Voskhod programme|Voskhod]] effectively used Vostok capsules with their ejection seats removed to achieve Soviet space firsts of multiple person crews in 1964 and spacewalks in early 1965. These capabilities were later demonstrated by the U.S. in ten [[Gemini program|Gemini]] low Earth orbit missions throughout 1965 and 1966, using a totally new second-generation spacecraft design that had little in common with the earlier Mercury. These Gemini missions went on to prove techniques for orbital [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous and docking]] crucial to a crewed lunar landing mission profile.\n\nAfter the end of the Gemini program, the Soviet Union began flying their second-generation Zond crewed spacecraft in 1967 with the ultimate goal of looping a cosmonaut around the Moon and returning him or her immediately to Earth. The [[Zond program|Zond]] spacecraft was launched with the simpler and already operational [[Proton rocket|Proton]] launch rocket, unlike the parallel Soviet human Moon landing effort also underway at the time based on third-generation [[Soyuz spacecraft]] requiring development of the advanced [[N-1 rocket|N-1]] booster. The Soviets thus believed they could achieve a crewed Zond circumlunar flight years before a U.S. human lunar landing and so score a propaganda victory. However, significant development problems delayed the Zond program and the success of the U.S. Apollo lunar landing program led to the eventual termination of the Zond effort.\n\nLike Zond, Apollo flights were generally launched on a free return trajectory that would return them to Earth via a circumlunar loop if a [[Apollo service module|service module]] malfunction failed to place them in lunar orbit. This option was implemented after an explosion aboard the [[Apollo 13]] mission in 1970, which is the only crewed circumlunar loop mission flown to date.{{when|date=September 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse; \"\n|-\n! align=left | U.S.S.R mission\n! align=center | Mass (kg)\n! align=center | Booster\n! align=center | Launched\n! align=center | Mission goal\n! align=center | Payload\n! align=center | Mission result\n|-\n| [[Cosmos-146]]\n| 5,400\n| [[Proton rocket|Proton]]\n| align=\"right\" | 10 March 1967\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">Partial success</span> \u2013 Successfully reached high Earth orbit, but became stranded and was unable to initiate controlled high speed atmospheric reentry test\n|-\n| [[Cosmos-154]]\n| 5,400\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 8 April 1967\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">Partial success</span> \u2013 Successfully reached high Earth orbit, but became stranded and was unable to initiate controlled high speed atmospheric reentry test\n|-\n|\n|\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 28 September 1967\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n|\n|\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 22 November 1967\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n| [[Zond 4|Zond-4]]\n| 5,140\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 2 March 1968\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">Partial success</span> \u2013 launched successfully to 300,000&nbsp;km high Earth orbit, high speed reentry test guidance malfunction, intentional self-destruct to prevent landfall outside Soviet Union\n|-\n|\n|\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 23 April 1968\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit; launch preparation tank explosion kills three in pad crew\n|-\n| [[Zond 5|Zond-5]]\n| 5,375\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 15 September 1968\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 looped around Moon with Earth's first near-lunar life forms, two tortoises and other live biological specimens, and the capsule and payload safely to Earth despite landing off-target outside the Soviet Union in the Indian Ocean\n|-\n| [[Zond 6|Zond-6]]\n| 5,375\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 10 November 1968\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">Partial success</span> \u2013 looped around Moon, successful reentry, but loss of cabin air pressure caused biological payload death, parachute system malfunction and severe vehicle damage upon landing\n|-\n|\n|\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 20 January 1969\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n| [[Zond 7|Zond-7]]\n| 5,979\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 8 August 1969\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 looped around Moon, returned biological payload safely to Earth and landed on-target inside Soviet Union.

Despite the failure suffered in its final moments, the Zond 6 mission was reported by Soviet media as being a success as well. Although hailed worldwide as remarkable achievements, both these Zond missions flew off-nominal reentry trajectories resulting in deceleration forces that would have been fatal to humans.\n\nAs a result, the Soviets secretly planned to continue uncrewed Zond tests until their reliability to support human flight had been demonstrated. However, due to NASA's continuing problems with the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]], and because of [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] reports of a potential Soviet crewed circumlunar flight in late 1968, NASA fatefully changed the flight plan of [[Apollo 8]] from an Earth-orbit lunar module test to a lunar orbit mission scheduled for late December 1968.\n\nIn early December 1968 the launch window to the Moon opened for the Soviet launch site in [[Baikonur]], giving the USSR their final chance to beat the US to the Moon. [[Cosmonauts]] went on alert and asked to fly the Zond spacecraft then in final countdown at Baikonur on the first human trip to the Moon. Ultimately, however, the Soviet [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] decided the risk of crew death was unacceptable given the combined poor performance to that point of Zond/Proton and so scrubbed the launch of a crewed Soviet lunar mission. Their decision proved to be a wise one, since this unnumbered Zond mission was destroyed in another uncrewed test when it was finally launched several weeks later.\n\nBy this time flights of the third generation U.S. [[Apollo spacecraft]] had begun. Far more capable than the Zond, the Apollo spacecraft had the necessary rocket power to slip into and out of lunar orbit and to make course adjustments required for a safe reentry during the return to Earth. The [[Apollo 8]] mission carried out the first human trip to the Moon on 24 December 1968, certifying the [[Saturn V]] booster for crewed use and flying not a circumlunar loop but instead a full ten orbits around the Moon before returning safely to Earth. [[Apollo 10]] then performed a full dress rehearsal of a crewed Moon landing in May 1969. This mission orbited within {{convert|47,400|ft|km}} of the lunar surface, performing necessary low-altitude mapping of trajectory-altering mascons using a factory prototype lunar module too heavy to land. With the failure of the robotic Soviet sample return Moon landing attempt [[Luna 15]] in July 1969, the stage was set for [[Apollo 11]].\n\n== Human Moon landings (1969\u20131972) ==\n[[File:N1%2BSaturn5.jpg|thumb|250px|The U.S. [[Saturn V]] and the Soviet [[N1 (rocket)|N1]].]]\n\n=== US strategy ===\n{{Main|Apollo program#Political pressure builds}}\nPlans for human Moon exploration began during the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration. In a series of mid-1950s articles in ''[[Collier's]]'' magazine, [[Wernher von Braun]] had popularized the idea of a crewed expedition to establish a lunar base. A human Moon landing posed several daunting technical challenges to the US and USSR. Besides guidance and weight management, [[atmospheric re-entry]] without [[Ablation|ablative]] overheating was a major hurdle. After the Soviets launched [[Sputnik]], von Braun promoted a plan for the US Army to establish a military lunar outpost by 1965.\n\nAfter the [[Space race#Humans in space|early Soviet successes]], especially [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s flight, US President [[John F. Kennedy]] looked for a project that would capture the public imagination. He asked Vice President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to make recommendations on a scientific endeavor that would prove US world leadership. The proposals included non-space options such as massive irrigation projects to benefit the [[Third World]]. The Soviets, at the time, had more powerful rockets than the US, which gave them an advantage in some kinds of space mission.\n\nAdvances in US nuclear weapon technology had led to smaller, lighter warheads; the Soviets' were much heavier, and the powerful [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] rocket was developed to carry them. More modest missions such as flying around the Moon, or a space lab in lunar orbit (both were proposed by Kennedy to von Braun), offered too much advantage to the Soviets; ''landing'', however, would capture the world's imagination.\n\n[[File:Apollo Landings by Nasa.jpg|thumb|350px|Apollo landing sites]]\nJohnson had championed the US human spaceflight program ever since Sputnik, sponsoring legislation to create NASA while he was still a senator. When Kennedy asked him in 1961 to research the best achievement to counter the Soviets' lead, Johnson responded that the US had an even chance of beating them to a crewed lunar landing, but not for anything less. Kennedy seized on Apollo as the ideal focus for efforts in space. He ensured continuing funding, shielding space spending from the 1963 tax cut, but diverting money from other NASA scientific projects. These diversions dismayed NASA's leader, [[James E. Webb]], who perceived the need for NASA's support from the scientific community.\n\nThe Moon landing required development of the large Saturn V [[launch vehicle]], which achieved a perfect record: zero catastrophic failures or launch vehicle-caused mission failures in thirteen launches.\n\nFor the program to succeed, its proponents would have to defeat criticism from politicians both on the left (more money for social programs) and on the right (more money for the military). By emphasizing the scientific payoff and playing on fears of Soviet space dominance, Kennedy and Johnson managed to swing public opinion: by 1965, 58 percent of Americans favored Apollo, up from 33 percent two years earlier. After Johnson [[Assassination of President John F. Kennedy|became President in 1963]], his continuing defense of the program allowed it to succeed in 1969, as Kennedy had planned.\n\n=== Soviet strategy ===\n{{Main|Soviet crewed lunar programs{{!}}Soviet Moonshot}}\n\nSoviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] said in October 1963 the USSR was \"not at present planning flight by cosmonauts to the Moon,\" while insisting that the Soviets had not dropped out of the race. Only after another year would the USSR fully commit itself to a Moon-landing attempt, which ultimately failed.\n\nAt the same time, Kennedy had suggested various joint programs, including a possible Moon landing by Soviet and U.S. astronauts and the development of better weather-monitoring satellites. Khrushchev, sensing an attempt by Kennedy to steal Russian space technology, rejected the idea: if the USSR went to the Moon, it would go alone. [[Sergey Korolev]], the [[Soviet space program]]'s chief designer, had started promoting his [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] craft and the [[N1 (rocket)|N1]] launcher rocket that would have the capability of carrying out a human Moon landing.\n\nKhrushchev directed Korolev's design bureau to arrange further space firsts by modifying the existing Vostok technology, while a second team started building a completely new launcher and craft, the Proton booster and the Zond, for a human cislunar flight in 1966. In 1964 the new Soviet leadership gave Korolev the backing for a Moon landing effort and brought all crewed projects under his direction.\n\nWith Korolev's death and the failure of the first Soyuz flight in 1967, coordination of the Soviet Moon landing program quickly unraveled. The Soviets built a landing craft and selected cosmonauts for a mission that would have placed [[Alexei Leonov]] on the Moon's surface, but with the successive launch failures of the N1 booster in 1969, plans for a crewed landing suffered first delay and then cancellation.\n\nA program of automated return vehicles was begun, in the hope of being the first to return lunar rocks. This had several failures.

Three have made the trip twice, and twelve have walked on its surface. Apollo 8 was a lunar-orbit-only mission, Apollo 10 included undocking and Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI), followed by LM staging to CSM redocking, while Apollo 13, originally scheduled as a landing, ended up as a lunar fly-by, by means of [[free return trajectory]]; thus, none of these missions made landings. Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were Earth-orbit-only missions. Apart from the inherent dangers of crewed Moon expeditions as seen with Apollo 13, one reason for their cessation according to astronaut [[Alan Bean]] is the cost it imposes in government subsidies.<ref>{{Cite web|title=In the Shadow of the Moon|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=37065|publisher=comingsoon.net|accessdate=7 February 2008}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Human Moon landings ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!Mission name\n!Lunar lander\n! width=\"11%\" |Lunar landing date\n! width=\"11%\" |Lunar liftoff date\n! width=\"12%\" |Lunar landing site\n!Duration on lunar surface (DD:HH:MM)\n! width=\"25%\" |Crew\n!Number of [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVAs]]\n!Total EVA Time (HH:MM)\n|-\n||[[Apollo 11]]\n||''Eagle''\n| align=\"right\" |20 July 1969\n| align=\"right\" |21 July 1969\n||[[Mare Tranquillitatis|Sea of Tranquility]]\n||0:21:31\n||[[Neil Armstrong]], [[Buzz Aldrin|Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin]]\n||1\n||2:31\n|-\n||[[Apollo 12]]\n||''Intrepid''\n| align=\"right\" |19 November 1969\n| align=\"right\" |21 November 1969\n||[[Oceanus Procellarum|Ocean of Storms]]\n||1:07:31\n||[[Pete Conrad|Charles \"Pete\" Conrad]], [[Alan Bean]]\n||2\n||7:45\n|-\n||[[Apollo 14]]\n||''Antares''\n| align=\"right\" |5 February 1971\n| align=\"right\" |6 February 1971\n||[[Fra Mauro formation|Fra Mauro]]\n||1:09:30\n||[[Alan Shepard|Alan B.

Their ideology revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the Torah of Israel.<ref>[[Adriana Kemp]], ''Israelis in Conflict: Hegemonies, Identities, and Challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, pp.314\u2013315.</ref>\n\nThe [[Hardal]] (\u200e \u05d7\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d9 \u1e24aredi Le'umi, lit.\u2009\"Nationalist [[Haredi]]\") are a sub-community; stricter in observance, and more \"statist\" in their politics.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Abraham Isaac Kook 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Isaac Kook]], 1924]]\n\nIn 1862, German Orthodox [[Rabbi]] [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]] published his tractate ''Derishat Zion'', positing that the salvation of the Jews, promised by the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], can come about only by self-help.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=56&letter=K Zvi Hirsch Kalischer] (Jewish Encyclopedia)</ref> Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Glasner]] was another prominent rabbi who supported Zionism. The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies|Matan]], which similarly offer Talmud focused learning to women.\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]]. A girls' high school is referred to as an ''[[Ulpana]]''.\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\nSome institutions are aligned with the ''Hardal'' community, with an ideology that is somewhat more \"statist\".\nThe leading Yeshiva here is [[Har Hamor]]; [[Hardal#Schools|several high schools]] also operate.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.\n\nFor this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the [[Hesder]] program, which allows military service to be combined with [[yeshiva]] studies.

Their ideology revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the Torah of Israel.<ref>[[Adriana Kemp]], ''Israelis in Conflict: Hegemonies, Identities, and Challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, pp.314\u2013315.</ref>\n\nThe [[Hardal]] (\u200e \u05d7\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d9 \u1e24aredi Le'umi, lit.\u2009\"Nationalistic [[Haredi]]\") are a sub-community; stricter in observance, and more \"statist\" in their politics.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Abraham Isaac Kook 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Isaac Kook]], 1924]]\n\nIn 1862, German Orthodox [[Rabbi]] [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]] published his tractate ''Derishat Zion'', positing that the salvation of the Jews, promised by the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], can come about only by self-help.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=56&letter=K Zvi Hirsch Kalischer] (Jewish Encyclopedia)</ref> Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Glasner]] was another prominent rabbi who supported Zionism. The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies|Matan]], which similarly offer Talmud focused learning to women.\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]]. A girls' high school is referred to as an ''[[Ulpana]]''.\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\nSome institutions are aligned with the ''Hardal'' community, with an ideology that is somewhat more \"statist\".\nThe leading Yeshiva here is [[Har Hamor]]; [[Hardal#Schools|several high schools]] also operate.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.\n\nFor this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the [[Hesder]] program, which allows military service to be combined with [[yeshiva]] studies. Some others attend a pre-army [[Mechina]] educational program, delaying their service by one year. 88% of Hesder students belong to combat units, compared to a national average of below 30%. \n\nWhile some Religious Zionist women serve in the army, most choose national service, known as [[Sherut Leumi]], instead (working at hospitals, schools, and day-care centers).\nIn November 2010, the IDF held a special conference which was attended by the heads of Religious Zionism in order to encourage female Religious Zionists to join the IDF.

Drupal core is the stock element of Drupal. Common Drupal-specific libraries, as well as the bootstrap process, are defined as Drupal core; all other functionality is defined as Drupal modules including the system module itself.\n \nIn a Drupal website's default configuration, authors can contribute content as either registered or anonymous users (at the discretion of the administrator). This content is accessible to web visitors through a variety of selectable criteria. As of Drupal 8, Drupal has adopted some [[Symfony]] libraries into Drupal core.\n\nCore modules also includes a hierarchical [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] system, which lets developers categorize content or [[Tag (metadata)|tagged]] with key words for easier access.<ref name=features>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/features | title=Features | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\nDrupal maintains a detailed [[changelog]] of core feature updates by version.<ref name=changelog>{{Cite web | url= https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.39 | title= Drupal 7.39 released | work= drupal.org | accessdate= 2015-09-19}}</ref>\n\n===Core modules===\nDrupal core includes optional modules that can be enabled by the administrator to extend the functionality of the core website.<ref name=coremodules>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/handbook/modules | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728103300/http://drupal.org/handbook/modules | archivedate=2008-07-28 | title=Handbook: Core Modules | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\nThe core Drupal distribution provides a number of features, including:<ref name=coremodules/>\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* Access statistics and logging\n* Advanced search\n* Blogs, books, comments, forums, and polls\n* Caching and feature throttling for improved performance\n* Descriptive URLs\n* Multi-level menu system\n* Multi-site support<ref name=multisite>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/43816 | title=Drupal Multi-site installation recipes }}</ref>\n* Multi-user content creation and editing\n* [[OpenID]] support\n* RSS feed and feed aggregator\n* Security and new release update notification\n* User profiles\n* Various access control restrictions (user roles, IP addresses, email)\n* Workflow tools (triggers and actions)\n}}\n\n===Core themes===\nDrupal includes core themes, which customize the \"look and feel\" of Drupal sites,<ref name=coretheme>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/91964 | title=Garland, the new default core theme | last=Buytaert | first=Dries | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> for example, Garland and Bartik.\n\nThe Color Module, introduced in Drupal core 5.0, allows administrators to change the color scheme of certain themes via a browser interface.<ref name=colormodule>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/handbook/modules/color | title=Color: Allows the user to change the color scheme of certain themes | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\n===Localization===\n{{As of|2017|01}}, Drupal had been made available in 100 languages and [[English language|English]] (the default).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://localize.drupal.org/translate/downloads | title=Drupal core translation downloads | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2017-01-30}}</ref> Support is included for right-to-left languages such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref name=sixnewfeatures>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/drupal-6.0 | title=Drupal 6.0 released | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\nDrupal localization is built on top of [[gettext]], the GNU [[internationalization and localization]] (i18n) library.\n\n===Auto-update notification===\nDrupal can automatically notify the administrator about new versions of modules, themes, or the Drupal core.<ref name=sixnewfeatures/> It's important to update quickly after security updates are released.\n\nBefore updating it is highly recommended to take backup of core, modules, theme, files and database. If there is any error shown after update or if the new update is not compatible with a module, then it can be quickly replaced by backup. There are several backup modules available in Drupal.\n\nOn October 15, 2014, a sql injection vulnerability was announced and update released.<ref name=\"sql-injection-vulnerability\">{{cite web |url=https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-005 |title=SA-CORE-2014-005 - Drupal core - SQL injection |newspaper=Https |date=  |accessdate= December 3, 2014}}</ref> Two weeks later the Drupal security team released an advisory explaining that everyone should act under the assumption that any site not updated within 7 hours of the announcement are infected.<ref name=\"sql-injection-exploited\">{{cite web |url=https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003 |title=Drupal Core - Highly Critical - Public Service announcement - PSA-2014-003 |newspaper=Https |date=  |accessdate= December 3, 2014}}</ref> Thus, it can be extremely important to apply these updates quickly and usage of a tool to make this process easier like [[drush]] is highly recommended.\n\n===Database abstraction===\nPrior to version 7, Drupal had functions that performed tasks related to databases, such as SQL query cleansing, multi-site table name prefixing, and generating proper SQL queries. In particular, Drupal 6 introduced an abstraction layer that allowed programmers to create SQL queries without writing SQL.\n\nDrupal 9 extends the data abstraction layer so that a programmer no longer needs to write SQL queries as text strings. It uses [[PHP Data Objects]] to abstract the database. [[Microsoft]] has written a database driver for their [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]]. Drupal 7 supports the file-based [[SQLite]] database engine, which is part of the standard PHP distribution.\n\n===Windows development===\nWith Drupal 9's new database abstraction layer, and ability to run on the Windows web server [[Internet Information Services|IIS]], it is now easier for Windows developers to participate in the Drupal community.\n\nA group on Drupal.org is dedicated to Windows issues.<ref name=drupal-windows>{{Cite web | url=http://groups.drupal.org/drupal-windows | title=Drupal on Windows Group | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2011-02-14}}</ref>\n\n===Accessibility===\nSince the release of Drupal 7, [[Web accessibility]] has been constantly improving in the Drupal community.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/about/accessibility | title=Accessibility statement | last=Killesreiter | first=Gerhard | work=drupal.org | date=2013-02-25 | accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref> Drupal is a good framework for building sites accessible to people with disabilities, because many of the best practices have been incorporated into Drupal Core. \n\nDrupal 8 saw many improvements from the [[Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines]] (ATAG) 2.0 guidelines which support both an accessible authoring environment as well as support for authors to produce more accessible content. \n\nThe accessibility team is carrying on the work of identifying and resolving accessibility barriers and raising awareness within the community.\n\nDrupal 8 has good semantic support for [[Rich Internet application|Rich Internet Applications]] through [[WAI-ARIA]]. There have been many improvements to both the visitor and administrator sides of Drupal, especially:\n* Drag and drop functionality;\n* Improved color contrast and intensity;\n* Adding skip navigation to core themes;\n* Adding labels by default for input forms;\n* Fixing CSS display:none with consistent methods for hiding and exposing text on focus;\n* Adding support for ARIA Live Regions with Drupal.announce(); and\n* Adding a TabbingManager to support better keyboard navigation.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/accessibility/drupal-8-accessibility-features | title=Drupal 8 Accessibility Features }}</ref> \n\nThe community also added an accessibility gate for core issues in Drupal 8.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/core-gates#accessibility | title=Drupal core gates | last=Scholten | first=Roy | work=drupal.org | date=2012-12-10 | accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref>\n\n==Extending the core==\nDrupal core is [[modular]], defining a system of [[Hooking|hooks]] and [[Callback (computer programming)|callbacks]], which are accessed internally via an [[API]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://api.drupal.org/ | title=API Reference | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> This design allows third-party contributed [[#Modules|modules]] and [[#Themes|themes]] to extend or override Drupal's default behaviors without changing Drupal core's code.\n\nDrupal isolates core files from contributed modules and themes. This increases flexibility and security and allows administrators to cleanly upgrade to new releases without overwriting their site's customizations.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/22283 | title=File and directory management | work=drupal.org}}</ref> The Drupal community has the saying, \"Never hack core,\" a strong recommendation that site developers do not change core files.<ref name=\"drupal1\"/>\n\n===Modules===\nContributed modules offer such additional or alternate features as image galleries, custom content types and content listings, [[WYSIWYG]] editors, private messaging, third-party integration tools,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.specbee.com/blogs/symphony2-components-drupal-8-integration-every-drupaler-must-know-about|title=Integrating Drupal with External Systems|author=|first=|date=2018-08-24|website=|publisher=specbee.com|accessdate=2018-08-24|df=}}</ref> integrating with BPM portals,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.srijan.net/solutions/drupal-camunda-bpm-integration | title=Drupal Camunda BPM Integration | website=Srijan Technologies | publisher=Srijan Technologies| access-date=}}</ref> and more. {{As of|2019|12}} the Drupal website lists more than 44,000 free [[Modular programming|modules]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module|title=Module project {{!}} Drupal.org|last=|first=|date=2019-12-21|website=www.drupal.org|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/PM3OF|archive-date=2019-12-21|access-date=2017-09-21}}</ref>\n\nSome of the most commonly used contributed modules include:<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://drupal.org/project/usage | title=Project usage overview | work=Drupal.org | accessdate=2011-08-18}}</ref>\n* Content Construction Kit (CCK): allows site administrators to dynamically create content types by extending the database schema. \"Content type\" describes the kind of information.

Themes adapt or replace a Drupal site's default look and feel.\n\nDrupal themes use standardized formats that may be generated by common third-party theme design engines. Many are written in the [[PHPTemplate]] engine<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/phptemplate | title=PHPTemplate theme engine | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308030334/http://drupal.org/phptemplate | archivedate=2009-03-08 }}</ref> or, to a lesser extent, the [[XTemplate]] engine.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/6493 | title=XTemplate theme engine | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316205154/http://drupal.org/node/6493 | archivedate=2009-03-16 }}</ref> Some templates use hard-coded [[PHP]]. Drupal 8 and future versions of Drupal integrate the [[Twig (template engine)|Twig]] templating engine.\n\nThe inclusion of the PHPTemplate and XTemplate engines in Drupal addressed user concerns about flexibility and complexity.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/15689#comment-25704 | title=How does Drupal compare to Mambo? discussion thread | work=drupal.org | date=2005-01-17 | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> The Drupal theming system utilizes a [[Template engine (web)|template engine]] to further separate [[HTML]]/[[CSS]] from PHP. A popular Drupal contributed module called 'Devel' provides GUI information to developers and themers about the page build.\n\nCommunity-contributed themes<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/project/Themes | title=Drupal themes|publisher=Drupal.org | accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> at the Drupal website are released under a free [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] license,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/14208 | title=Adding your theme to Drupal.org|publisher=Drupal.org}}</ref> and the most installed Drupal themes are [https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme/?solrsort=iss_project_release_usage%20desc&f%5B3%5D=sm_field_project_type%3Afull listed on this page].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dezignmatterz.com/best-responsive-drupal-themes/ | title=10 Best Drupal Themes|publisher=MAAN Softwares | accessdate=2017-11-08}}</ref>\n\n===Distributions===\nIn the past, those wanting a fully customized installation of Drupal had to download a pre-tailored version separately from the official Drupal core. Today, however, a distribution defines a packaged version of Drupal that upon installation, provides a website or application built for a specific purpose.\n\nThe distributions offer the benefit of a new Drupal site without having to manually seek out and install third-party contributed modules or adjust configuration settings.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Top Drupal Distributions| url=http://www.aglobalway.com/content/top-drupal-distributions| publisher=AGLOBALWAY Consulting Services Inc.| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413154924/http://www.aglobalway.com/content/top-drupal-distributions| archivedate=2014-04-13}}</ref> They are collections of modules, themes, and associated configuration settings that prepare Drupal for custom operation. For example, a distribution could configure Drupal as a \"brochure\" site rather than a news site or [[online store]].\n\n==Architecture==\nDrupal is based on the [[Presentation Abstraction Control]] architecture, or PAC.\n\nThe [https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes!menu.inc/group/menu/7 menu system] acts as the Controller. It accepts input via a single source ([[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#HTTP GET|HTTP GET]] and [[POST (HTTP)|POST]]), routes requests to the appropriate helper functions, pulls data out of the Abstraction (nodes and, from Drupal 5 onwards, forms), and then pushes it through a filter to get a Presentation of it (the theme system).\n\nIt even has multiple, parallel PAC agents in the form of blocks that push data out to a common canvas (page.tpl.php).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/mvc-vs-pac | title=MVC vs. PAC}}</ref>\n\n==Community==\nDrupal.org has a large community of users and developers who provide active [[community]] support by coming up with new updates to help improve the functionality of Drupal,<ref>[https://maansoftwares.com/blog/drupal/drupal-cms-grew-overnight Drupal - CMS Grew Overnight] By MAAN Softwares, Retrieved, June 8th, 2017</ref> {{As of|2017|01}} more than 105,400 users are actively contributing.<ref name=\"dohome\"/> The semiannual DrupalCon conference alternates between North America, Europe and Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groups.drupal.org/node/17870|title=drupal.org discussion on DrupalCon event management|publisher=Groups.drupal.org|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> Attendance at DrupalCon grew from 500 at [[Szeged]] in August 2008, to over 3,700 people at Austin, Texas in June, 2014.\n\nSmaller events, known as \"Drupal Camps\" or DrupalCamp,<ref>{{cite web|title=Drupal Camps and Cons|url=http://buildamodule.com/drupal-camps-calendar|accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref> occur throughout the year all over the world. The annual Florida DrupalCamp brings users together for [[Coding for a Cause]] that benefits a local nonprofit organization, as does the annual GLADCamp ([[Greater Los Angeles Drupal]] Camp) event, [[Coders with a Cause]].\n\nThe Drupal community also organizes professional and semi-professional gatherings called [[meeting|meetups]] at a large number of venues around the world. \n\nThere are a number of active Drupal forums,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drupal.org/forum/|title=forums|publisher=Drupal.org|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> mailing lists<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drupal.org/mailing-lists|title=mailing lists|publisher=Drupal.org|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> and discussion groups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://groups.drupal.org/|title=Drupal Groups|publisher=Groups.drupal.org|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> Drupal also maintains several [[IRC]] channels<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drupal.org/node/108355|title=Drupal IRC channels on FreeNode|publisher=Drupal.org|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> on the [[Freenode]] network.\n\nThere are over 30 national communities<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drupal.org/language-specific-communities|title=Language specific communities|publisher=Drupal.org|date=2011-08-26|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> around drupal.org offering language-specific support.\n\nNotable Drupal users include [[NBC]], [[Taboola]], [[Patch Media|Patch]], and [[We the People (petitioning system)|We the People]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Spencer|first1=Jamie|title=CMS Battle for Beginners: WordPress vs Joomla vs Drupal (Infographic)|url=https://makeawebsitehub.com/compare/content-management-system-cms-comparison/|accessdate=17 May 2017|work=MakeAWebsiteHub.com|date=7 April 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Security==\nDrupal's policy is to announce the nature of each security vulnerability once the fix is released.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://drupal.org/security-team | title=Security announcement and release process| author=Drupal}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://drupal.org/security-team/report-issue | title=How to report a security issue| author=Drupal}}</ref>\n\nAdministrators of Drupal sites are automatically notified of these new releases via the Update Status module (Drupal 6) or via the Update Manager (Drupal 7).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/documentation/modules/update | title=Update manager (and Update status) | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nDrupal maintains a security announcement mailing list, a history of all security advisories,<ref name=\"security\">{{Cite web|url=http://drupal.org/security|title=Security advisories|work=drupal.org|accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref> a security team home page,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/security-team | title=Drupal security team|publisher=Drupal.org | accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> and an RSS feed<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/security/rss.xml | title=Drupal Security RSS feed|publisher=Drupal.org | accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> with the most recent security advisories.\n\nIn mid-October 2014,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/11/03/drupal_drupalgeddon_analysis/|title=Drupalgeddon megaflaw raises questions over CMS bods' crisis mgmt}}</ref> Drupal issued a \"highly critical\" security advisory regarding an [[SQL injection]] bug in Drupal 7, also known as Drupalgeddon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-005|title=SA-CORE-2014-005 - Drupal core - SQL injection|work=Security advisories|publisher=Drupal security team}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.drop-guard.net/blog/drupalgeddon-panama-papers|work=Blog|publisher=Drop Guard|title=Drupalgeddon strikes back: outdated Drupal allegedly linked to \"Panama Papers\"}}</ref>\n\nDownloading and installing an upgrade to Drupal 7.32 fixes the vulnerability, but does not remove any [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] installed by hackers if the site has already been [[exploit (computer security)|compromised]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003|title=Drupal Core&mdash;Highly Critical&mdash;Public Service Announcement&mdash;PSA-2014-003|last=|first=|date=October 29, 2014|work=Security advisories|publisher=Drupal security team|access-date=|quote=<p>You should proceed under the assumption that every Drupal 7 website was compromised unless updated or patched before Oct 15th, 11pm UTC, that is 7 hours after the announcement.</p><p>'''Simply updating to Drupal 7.32 will not remove backdoors'''....updating to version 7.32 or applying the patch fixes the vulnerability but does not fix an already compromised website.

Drupal core is the stock element of Drupal. Common Drupal-specific libraries, as well as the bootstrap process, are defined as Drupal core; all other functionality is defined as Drupal modules including the system module itself.\n \nIn a Drupal website's default configuration, authors can contribute content as either registered or anonymous users (at the discretion of the administrator). This content is accessible to web visitors through a variety of selectable criteria. As of Drupal 8, Drupal has adopted some [[Symfony]] libraries into Drupal core.\n\nCore modules also includes a hierarchical [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] system, which lets developers categorize content or [[Tag (metadata)|tagged]] with key words for easier access.<ref name=features>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/features | title=Features | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\nDrupal maintains a detailed [[changelog]] of core feature updates by version.<ref name=changelog>{{Cite web | url= https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.39 | title= Drupal 7.39 released | work= drupal.org | accessdate= 2015-09-19}}</ref>\n\n===Core modules===\nDrupal core includes optional modules that can be enabled by the administrator to extend the functionality of the core website.<ref name=coremodules>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/handbook/modules | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728103300/http://drupal.org/handbook/modules | archivedate=2008-07-28 | title=Handbook: Core Modules | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\nThe core Drupal distribution provides a number of features, including:<ref name=coremodules/>\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* Access statistics and logging\n* Advanced search\n* Blogs, books, comments, forums, and polls\n* Caching and feature throttling for improved performance\n* Descriptive URLs\n* Multi-level menu system\n* Multi-site support<ref name=multisite>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/43816 | title=Drupal Multi-site installation recipes }}</ref>\n* Multi-user content creation and editing\n* [[OpenID]] support\n* RSS feed and feed aggregator\n* Security and new release update notification\n* User profiles\n* Various access control restrictions (user roles, IP addresses, email)\n* Workflow tools (triggers and actions)\n}}\n\n===Core themes===\nDrupal includes core themes, which customize the \"look and feel\" of Drupal sites,<ref name=coretheme>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/91964 | title=Garland, the new default core theme | last=Buytaert | first=Dries | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> for example, Garland and Bartik.\n\nThe Color Module, introduced in Drupal core 5.0, allows administrators to change the color scheme of certain themes via a browser interface.<ref name=colormodule>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/handbook/modules/color | title=Color: Allows the user to change the color scheme of certain themes | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\n===Localization===\n{{As of|2017|01}}, Drupal had been made available in 100 languages and [[English language|English]] (the default).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://localize.drupal.org/translate/downloads | title=Drupal core translation downloads | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2017-01-30}}</ref> Support is included for right-to-left languages such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref name=sixnewfeatures>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/drupal-6.0 | title=Drupal 6.0 released | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\nDrupal localization is built on top of [[gettext]], the GNU [[internationalization and localization]] (i18n) library.\n\n===Auto-update notification===\nDrupal can automatically notify the administrator about new versions of modules, themes, or the Drupal core.<ref name=sixnewfeatures/> It's important to update quickly after security updates are released.\n\nBefore updating it is highly recommended to take backup of core, modules, theme, files and database. If there is any error shown after update or if the new update is not compatible with a module, then it can be quickly replaced by backup. There are several backup modules available in Drupal.\n\nOn October 15, 2014, a sql injection vulnerability was announced and update released.<ref name=\"sql-injection-vulnerability\">{{cite web |url=https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-005 |title=SA-CORE-2014-005 - Drupal core - SQL injection |newspaper=Https |date=  |accessdate= December 3, 2014}}</ref> Two weeks later the Drupal security team released an advisory explaining that everyone should act under the assumption that any site not updated within 7 hours of the announcement are infected.<ref name=\"sql-injection-exploited\">{{cite web |url=https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003 |title=Drupal Core - Highly Critical - Public Service announcement - PSA-2014-003 |newspaper=Https |date=  |accessdate= December 3, 2014}}</ref> Thus, it can be extremely important to apply these updates quickly and usage of a tool to make this process easier like [[drush]] is highly recommended.\n\n===Database abstraction===\nPrior to version 7, Drupal had functions that performed tasks related to databases, such as SQL query cleansing, multi-site table name prefixing, and generating proper SQL queries. In particular, Drupal 6 introduced an abstraction layer that allowed programmers to create SQL queries without writing SQL.\n\nDrupal 9 extends the data abstraction layer so that a programmer no longer needs to write SQL queries as text strings. It uses [[PHP Data Objects]] to abstract the database. [[Microsoft]] has written a database driver for their [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]]. Drupal 7 supports the file-based [[SQLite]] database engine, which is part of the standard PHP distribution.\n\n===Windows development===\nWith Drupal 9's new database abstraction layer, and ability to run on the Windows web server [[Internet Information Services|IIS]], it is now easier for Windows developers to participate in the Drupal community.\n\nA group on Drupal.org is dedicated to Windows issues.<ref name=drupal-windows>{{Cite web | url=http://groups.drupal.org/drupal-windows | title=Drupal on Windows Group | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2011-02-14}}</ref>\n\n===Accessibility===\nSince the release of Drupal 7, [[Web accessibility]] has been constantly improving in the Drupal community.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/about/accessibility | title=Accessibility statement | last=Killesreiter | first=Gerhard | work=drupal.org | date=2013-02-25 | accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref> Drupal is a good framework for building sites accessible to people with disabilities, because many of the best practices have been incorporated into Drupal Core. \n\nDrupal 8 saw many improvements from the [[Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines]] (ATAG) 2.0 guidelines which support both an accessible authoring environment as well as support for authors to produce more accessible content. \n\nThe accessibility team is carrying on the work of identifying and resolving accessibility barriers and raising awareness within the community.\n\nDrupal 8 has good semantic support for [[Rich Internet application|Rich Internet Applications]] through [[WAI-ARIA]]. There have been many improvements to both the visitor and administrator sides of Drupal, especially:\n* Drag and drop functionality;\n* Improved color contrast and intensity;\n* Adding skip navigation to core themes;\n* Adding labels by default for input forms;\n* Fixing CSS display:none with consistent methods for hiding and exposing text on focus;\n* Adding support for ARIA Live Regions with Drupal.announce(); and\n* Adding a TabbingManager to support better keyboard navigation.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/accessibility/drupal-8-accessibility-features | title=Drupal 8 Accessibility Features }}</ref> \n\nThe community also added an accessibility gate for core issues in Drupal 8.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/core-gates#accessibility | title=Drupal core gates | last=Scholten | first=Roy | work=drupal.org | date=2012-12-10 | accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref>\n\n==Extending the core==\nDrupal core is [[modular]], defining a system of [[Hooking|hooks]] and [[Callback (computer programming)|callbacks]], which are accessed internally via an [[API]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://api.drupal.org/ | title=API Reference | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> This design allows third-party contributed [[#Modules|modules]] and [[#Themes|themes]] to extend or override Drupal's default behaviors without changing Drupal core's code.\n\nDrupal isolates core files from contributed modules and themes. This increases flexibility and security and allows administrators to cleanly upgrade to new releases without overwriting their site's customizations.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/22283 | title=File and directory management | work=drupal.org}}</ref> The Drupal community has the saying, \"Never hack core,\" a strong recommendation that site developers do not change core files.<ref name=\"drupal1\"/>\n\n===Modules===\nContributed modules offer such additional or alternate features as image galleries, custom content types and content listings, [[WYSIWYG]] editors, private messaging, third-party integration tools,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.specbee.com/blogs/symphony2-components-drupal-8-integration-every-drupaler-must-know-about|title=Integrating Drupal with External Systems|author=|first=|date=2018-08-24|website=|publisher=specbee.com|accessdate=2018-08-24|df=}}</ref> integrating with BPM portals,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.srijan.net/solutions/drupal-camunda-bpm-integration | title=Drupal Camunda BPM Integration | website=Srijan Technologies | publisher=Srijan Technologies| access-date=}}</ref> and more. {{As of|2019|12}} the Drupal website lists more than 44,000 free [[Modular programming|modules]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module|title=Module project {{!}} Drupal.org|last=|first=|date=2019-12-21|website=www.drupal.org|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/PM3OF|archive-date=2019-12-21|access-date=2017-09-21}}</ref>\n\nSome of the most commonly used contributed modules include:<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://drupal.org/project/usage | title=Project usage overview | work=Drupal.org | accessdate=2011-08-18}}</ref>\n* Content Construction Kit (CCK): allows site administrators to dynamically create content types by extending the database schema. \"Content type\" describes the kind of information.

Themes adapt or replace a Drupal site's default look and feel.\n\nDrupal themes use standardized formats that may be generated by common third-party theme design engines. Many are written in the [[PHPTemplate]] engine<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/phptemplate | title=PHPTemplate theme engine | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308030334/http://drupal.org/phptemplate | archivedate=2009-03-08 }}</ref> or, to a lesser extent, the [[XTemplate]] engine.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/6493 | title=XTemplate theme engine | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316205154/http://drupal.org/node/6493 | archivedate=2009-03-16 }}</ref> Some templates use hard-coded [[PHP]]. Drupal 8 and future versions of Drupal integrate the [[Twig (template engine)|Twig]] templating engine.\n\nThe inclusion of the PHPTemplate and XTemplate engines in Drupal addressed user concerns about flexibility and complexity.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/15689#comment-25704 | title=How does Drupal compare to Mambo? discussion thread | work=drupal.org | date=2005-01-17 | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> The Drupal theming system utilizes a [[Template engine (web)|template engine]] to further separate [[HTML]]/[[CSS]] from PHP. A popular Drupal contributed module called 'Devel' provides GUI information to developers and themers about the page build.\n\nCommunity-contributed themes<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/project/Themes | title=Drupal themes|publisher=Drupal.org | accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> at the Drupal website are released under a free [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] license,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/14208 | title=Adding your theme to Drupal.org|publisher=Drupal.org}}</ref> and the most installed Drupal themes are [https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme/?solrsort=iss_project_release_usage%20desc&f%5B3%5D=sm_field_project_type%3Afull listed on this page].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dezignmatterz.com/best-responsive-drupal-themes/ | title=10 Best Drupal Themes|publisher=MAAN Softwares | accessdate=2017-11-08}}</ref>\n\n===Distributions===\nIn the past, those wanting a fully customized installation of Drupal had to download a pre-tailored version separately from the official Drupal core. Today, however, a distribution defines a packaged version of Drupal that upon installation, provides a website or application built for a specific purpose.\n\nThe distributions offer the benefit of a new Drupal site without having to manually seek out and install third-party contributed modules or adjust configuration settings.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Top Drupal Distributions| url=http://www.aglobalway.com/content/top-drupal-distributions| publisher=AGLOBALWAY Consulting Services Inc.| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413154924/http://www.aglobalway.com/content/top-drupal-distributions| archivedate=2014-04-13}}</ref> They are collections of modules, themes, and associated configuration settings that prepare Drupal for custom operation. For example, a distribution could configure Drupal as a \"brochure\" site rather than a news site or [[online store]].\n\n==Architecture==\nDrupal is based on the [[Presentation Abstraction Control]] architecture, or PAC.\n\nThe [https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes!menu.inc/group/menu/7 menu system] acts as the Controller. It accepts input via a single source ([[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#HTTP GET|HTTP GET]] and [[POST (HTTP)|POST]]), routes requests to the appropriate helper functions, pulls data out of the Abstraction (nodes and, from Drupal 5 onwards, forms), and then pushes it through a filter to get a Presentation of it (the theme system).\n\nIt even has multiple, parallel PAC agents in the form of blocks that push data out to a common canvas (page.tpl.php).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/mvc-vs-pac | title=MVC vs. PAC}}</ref>\n\n==Community==\nDrupal.org has a large community of users and developers who provide active [[community]] support by coming up with new updates to help improve the functionality of Drupal,<ref>[https://maansoftwares.com/blog/drupal/drupal-cms-grew-overnight Drupal - CMS Grew Overnight] By MAAN Softwares, Retrieved, June 8th, 2017</ref> {{As of|2017|01}} more than 105,400 users are actively contributing.<ref name=\"dohome\"/> The semiannual DrupalCon conference alternates between North America, Europe and Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groups.drupal.org/node/17870|title=drupal.org discussion on DrupalCon event management|publisher=Groups.drupal.org|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> Attendance at DrupalCon grew from 500 at [[Szeged]] in August 2008, to over 3,700 people at Austin, Texas in June, 2014.\n\nSmaller events, known as \"Drupal Camps\" or DrupalCamp,<ref>{{cite web|title=Drupal Camps and Cons|url=http://buildamodule.com/drupal-camps-calendar|accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref> occur throughout the year all over the world. The annual Florida DrupalCamp brings users together for [[Coding for a Cause]] that benefits a local nonprofit organization, as does the annual GLADCamp ([[Greater Los Angeles Drupal]] Camp) event, [[Coders with a Cause]].\n\nThe Drupal community also organizes professional and semi-professional gatherings called [[meeting|meetups]] at a large number of venues around the world. \n\nThere are a number of active Drupal forums,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drupal.org/forum/|title=forums|publisher=Drupal.org|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> mailing lists<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drupal.org/mailing-lists|title=mailing lists|publisher=Drupal.org|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> and discussion groups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://groups.drupal.org/|title=Drupal Groups|publisher=Groups.drupal.org|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> Drupal also maintains several [[IRC]] channels<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drupal.org/node/108355|title=Drupal IRC channels on FreeNode|publisher=Drupal.org|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> on the [[Freenode]] network.\n\nThere are over 30 national communities<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drupal.org/language-specific-communities|title=Language specific communities|publisher=Drupal.org|date=2011-08-26|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> around drupal.org offering language-specific support.\n\nNotable Drupal users include [[NBC]], [[Taboola]], [[Patch Media|Patch]], and [[We the People (petitioning system)|We the People]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Spencer|first1=Jamie|title=CMS Battle for Beginners: WordPress vs Joomla vs Drupal (Infographic)|url=https://makeawebsitehub.com/compare/content-management-system-cms-comparison/|accessdate=17 May 2017|work=MakeAWebsiteHub.com|date=7 April 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Security==\nDrupal's policy is to announce the nature of each security vulnerability once the fix is released.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://drupal.org/security-team | title=Security announcement and release process| author=Drupal}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://drupal.org/security-team/report-issue | title=How to report a security issue| author=Drupal}}</ref>\n\nAdministrators of Drupal sites are automatically notified of these new releases via the Update Status module (Drupal 6) or via the Update Manager (Drupal 7).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/documentation/modules/update | title=Update manager (and Update status) | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nDrupal maintains a security announcement mailing list, a history of all security advisories,<ref name=\"security\">{{Cite web|url=http://drupal.org/security|title=Security advisories|work=drupal.org|accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref> a security team home page,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/security-team | title=Drupal security team|publisher=Drupal.org | accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> and an RSS feed<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/security/rss.xml | title=Drupal Security RSS feed|publisher=Drupal.org | accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> with the most recent security advisories.\n\nIn mid-October 2014,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/11/03/drupal_drupalgeddon_analysis/|title=Drupalgeddon megaflaw raises questions over CMS bods' crisis mgmt}}</ref> Drupal issued a \"highly critical\" security advisory regarding an [[SQL injection]] bug in Drupal 7, also known as Drupalgeddon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-005|title=SA-CORE-2014-005 - Drupal core - SQL injection|work=Security advisories|publisher=Drupal security team}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.drop-guard.net/blog/drupalgeddon-panama-papers|work=Blog|publisher=Drop Guard|title=Drupalgeddon strikes back: outdated Drupal allegedly linked to \"Panama Papers\"}}</ref>\n\nDownloading and installing an upgrade to Drupal 7.32 fixes the vulnerability, but does not remove any [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] installed by hackers if the site has already been [[exploit (computer security)|compromised]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003|title=Drupal Core&mdash;Highly Critical&mdash;Public Service Announcement&mdash;PSA-2014-003|last=|first=|date=October 29, 2014|work=Security advisories|publisher=Drupal security team|access-date=|quote=<p>You should proceed under the assumption that every Drupal 7 website was compromised unless updated or patched before Oct 15th, 11pm UTC, that is 7 hours after the announcement.</p><p>'''Simply updating to Drupal 7.32 will not remove backdoors'''....updating to version 7.32 or applying the patch fixes the vulnerability but does not fix an already compromised website.
