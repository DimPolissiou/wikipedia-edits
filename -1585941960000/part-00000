Christine conveys her thoughts in a very disconnected manner as she discusses with readers the complicated relationships with her ex-lover, her ex-husband, her young daughter, and her father, who instigated an incestuous relationship with Christine when she was a teenager. \n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe novel begins shortly after the end of Christine and Marie-Christine's three-month long sapphic affair. In the first and longest section of the book, entitled \"No Man's Land,\" Christine reacts to the demise of her relationship with Marie-Christine and examines the other relationships in her life, including her relationship with her daughter L\u00e9onore and her ex-husband Claude.                 \n\nThe next section entitled \"Christmas\" is divided into several subsections. It begins by detailing the events that occurred between December 25th and 27th, ending with a physical altercation between Christine and Marie-Christine and their separation. Christine then defines several words she identifies with, including incest, mental illness, paranoia, narcissism, homosexuality, subject, suicide, perversion, sadomasochism, nazism, hysteria, desire, and schizophrenia, respectively. She follows these definitions with examples of how these words apply to her life, and descriptions of her interactions with other individuals in her life in an effort to understand these words and how they apply to her specifically, as well as flashbacks to her and Marie-Christine's relationship in early December. This section ends with Christine describing a trip to the cinema that she took with her daughter, L\u00e9onore.                \n\nIn the final and shortest section of the novel, \"Valda Candy\", Christine describes in detail her incestuous relationship with her father, beginning when she was 14 and ending when she was 16. She then describes her relationship with 30-year-old Marc, a friend of her mother's, that began shortly after the end of her physical relationship with her father. Christine's focus then shifts back to her relationship with her father.

Emminger married Maria Sch\u00e4rft in 1906.

In 1909 he became a civil servant (state prosecutor and ''Amtsrichter''). He participated in [[World War I]] first as a voluntary soldier and later as a ''Kriegsgerichtsrat'' (military judge).<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\n==Political career==\nEmminger was a member of the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Center Party]] (Zentrum) and, from 1913-18 held a seat in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] for the constituency of Weilheim. In 1918, he joined the [[Bavarian People's Party]] (BVP) and represented it in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] 1920-33.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nEmminger was Minister of Justice in the first cabinet of chancellor [[Wilhelm Marx]], which took office on 30 November 1923. His tenure was defined by the passage of three decrees of 22 December 1923, 4 January and 13 February 1924,<ref name=\"Bio\"/> which were based on the ''{{lang|de|[[:wikisource:de:Erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz.

The reform of 4 January became known as the so-called ''[[Emminger Reform]]'' that among other things abolished the [[jury]] as [[trier of fact]] and replaced it with a mixed system of [[judge]]s and [[lay judge]]s in [[judiciary of Germany|Germany's judiciary]] which still exists today.{{sfn|Vogler|2005|p=244}}{{sfn|Kahn-Freund|1974|loc=footnote 73, p. 18}}{{sfn|Casper|Zeisel|1972|p=135}} ''Schwurgerichte'' (formerly based on jurors) kept their name but were in fact replaced by lay judges. Since the reforms were successful, they were kept in place by later legislation once the enabling law had lapsed.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nLate 1923 was among the most tumultuous times of the [[Weimar Republic]], bringing the peak of [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]]{{sfn|Fischer|2010|p=64}} and the ongoing [[Occupation of the Ruhr]].{{sfn|Mulligan|2005|p=173}}{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=64}} One of Emminger's main goals as a politician and lawyer became a revaluation of the currency to partially offset the adverse social consequences of hyperinflation. As a minister he prevented the planned ''Aufwertungsverbot'' from becoming law and continued to fight for revaluation as a Reichstag delegate.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nEmminger left office on 15 April 1924 and his Secretary of State, [[Curt Jo\u00ebl]], took over as acting Minister of Justice. He remained a member of the ''Rechtsausschuss'' of the Reichstag and 1927-31 served as chairman of the ''Zentralvorstand der deutsch-\u00f6sterreichischen Arbeitsgemeinschaft'' which worked towards a harmonisation of German and Austrian laws.

In 1909 he became a civil servant (state prosecutor and ''Amtsrichter''). He participated in [[World War I]] first as a voluntary soldier and later as a ''Kriegsgerichtsrat'' (military judge).<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\n==Political career==\nEmminger was a member of the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Center Party]] (Zentrum)and, from 1913-18 held a seat in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] for the constituency of Weilheim.

The reform of 4 January became known as the so-called ''[[Emminger Reform]]'' that among other things abolished the [[jury]] as [[trier of fact]] and replaced it with a mixed system of [[judge]]s and [[lay judge]]s in [[judiciary of Germany|Germany's judiciary]] which still exists today.{{sfn|Vogler|2005|p=244}}{{sfn|Kahn-Freund|1974|loc=footnote 73, p. 18}}{{sfn|Casper|Zeisel|1972|p=135}} ''Schwurgerichte'' (formerly based on jurors) kept their name but were in fact replaced by lay judges.

{"title_page": "Jeune \u00c9cole", "text_new": "{{italic title}} \nThe '''''Jeune \u00c9cole''''' (\"Young School\") was a [[strategic naval]] concept developed during the 19th century. It advocated the use of small, heavily armed vessels to combat larger [[battleship]]s, and the use of [[commerce raider]]s to cripple the trade of the rival nation.  The idea was developed among [[France|French]] naval theorists: the French government had the second largest navy of the time, and the theorists desired to counteract the strength of the larger [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Royal Navy]].\n\n==Small units against battleships==\nOne of the first proponents of the ''Jeune \u00c9cole'' was the artillery general [[Henri-Joseph Paixhans]], who invented explosive [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] guns for warships during the 1820s. He advocated the use of these powerful guns on numerous small steam [[warship]]s that could destroy much larger battleships.\n\n[[Image:NarvalSubmarine.jpg|thumb|The 1900 French submarine ''Narval'']]\n\nLater, the [[French Navy]] developed the concept more elaborately as it experimented with [[torpedo]]es and [[torpedo boat]]s.

''[[French armoured cruiser Dupuy de L\u00f4me (1887)|Dupuy de L\u00f4me]]'', an [[armored cruiser]], laid down during 1888, was capable of 23 knots, and designed to raid enemy commerce ships during extended forays afloat.\n\n==Influences==\n\nThe ''Jeune \u00c9cole'' system was particularly influential on the development of smaller navies, including the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during the 19th century, which tried to compensate for weaknesses in battleships.\n\nBritish admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John \"Jackie\" Fisher]], who would later become the [[First Sea Lord]] in 1904, was especially impressed by the ideas of ''Jeune \u00c9cole'' and felt that the threats of fast raiders and swarms of torpedo boats made the traditional battleship too unwieldy.

It advocated the use of small, heavily armed vessels to combat larger [[|battleship|battleships]], and the use of [[commerce raider]]s to cripple the trade of the rival nation.  The idea was developed among [[France|French]] naval theorists: the French government had the second largest navy of the time, and the theorists desired to counteract the strength of the larger [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Royal Navy]].\n\n==Small units against battleships==\nOne of the first proponents of the ''Jeune \u00c9cole'' was the artillery general [[Henri-Joseph Paixhans]], who invented explosive [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] guns for warships during the 1820s. He advocated the use of these powerful guns on numerous small steam [[warship]]s that could destroy much larger battleships.\n\n[[Image:NarvalSubmarine.jpg|thumb|The 1900 French submarine ''Narval'']]\n\nLater, the [[French Navy]] developed the concept more elaborately as it experimented with [[torpedo]]es and [[torpedo boat]]s. The French Navy became one of the strongest proponents of this combat system by the end of the 19th century.<ref name=CHOWE>{{cite book|last=Howe|first=Christopher|title=The Origins of Japanese Trade Supremacy: Development and Technology in Asia from 1540 to the Pacific War|year=1996|publisher=C.

''[[French armoured cruiser Dupuy de L\u00f4me (1887)|Dupuy de L\u00f4me]]'', an [[armored cruiser]], laid down during 1888, was capable of 23 knots, and designed to raid enemy commerce ships during extended forays afloat.\n\n==Influences==\n\nThe ''Jeune \u00c9cole'' system was particularly influential on the development of smaller navies, including the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during the 19th century, which tried to compensate for weaknesses in battleships.\n\nBritish admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John \"Jackie\" Fisher]], who would later become the [[First Sea Lord]] in 1904, was especially impressed by the ideas of ''Jeune \u00c9cole'' and felt that the threats of fast raiders and swarms of torpedo boats made the traditional battleship too unwieldy.  He argued that the future lay with fast ships with light armor and big guns, which would become known as the [[battlecruiser]], and actively promoted both its development and large scale deployment in the first decade of the 20th century.\n\n==References==\n* Howe, Christopher (1996).

Despite her parents' fame for their looks, she was mostly ignored during her childhood as people predominantly focused on her parents, who in turn only focused on each other.  When her mother falls ill and starts to lose her beauty, an artist is hired to paint a portrait of her as she was before her illness. He works nonstop for a fortnight until the painting is completed and shown to the queen. After viewing the painting the queen makes the king swear that he will only remarry if he can find a bride more beautiful than she, thinking that any other woman would pale in comparison, and dies shortly after he makes this promise. \n\nLissar comes to her father's attention during the funeral, as he notices her strong resemblance to her mother. His behavior towards her is mistakenly seen as loving by the general public, who otherwise continues to ignore her. During this time she is also presented with a puppy named Ash from Ossin, a prince from a neighboring kingdom. After the funeral Lissar devotes her time to learning herbalism and raising Ash. She also purposely avoids her father, whose actions make her increasingly more uncomfortable. \n\nWhen she is seventeen a ball is held to celebrate and to find her a suitable husband, as she is now of marriageable age. During the party, however, her father monopolizes her attention and on the following morning, announces that he intends to marry her, much to her horror. She is equally horrified to learn that the present nobility believe this to be her fault, that she purposely did this for her own benefit. Lissar makes an unsuccessful attempt to hide away in her chambers, but on the third night her father breaks in through a forgotten door, violently raping his daughter, impregnating her in the process, and almost killing Ash. \n\nThe following morning Lissar awakes with amnesia and flees to the mountains, where she finds a cabin. They stay for an entire winter, during which time Lissar miscarries and briefly regains traumatic memories of her rape, nearly dying. She is saved by a moon goddess who heals her wounds, grants her a white deerskin dress, and alters both Lissar and Ash so that they are unrecognizable; Lissar's hair changes from black to white, and Ash grows a coat similar to that of a [[borzoi]]. As another gift the goddess gives Lissar time to heal and to forget what happened to her, allowing her to once again forget her past. Lissar soon finds that she wants to be among people again and under the name Deerskin, travels to a small kingdom, unaware that this is the home of Prince Ossin. \n\nShe is hired by Ossin to raise a litter of puppies whose mother has died. While she cares for the puppies she grows close to Ossin. Upon many calling her by the name \"Lady\" or \"Moonwoman\", Ossin tells her that the name comes from a legend of a beautiful princess who was raped and then abandoned the earth for the moon when her father dismissed her concerns. While telling her of the tale Ossin also shows Lissar a room filled with portraits of princes and princesses sent out to various kingdoms as a way of advertising their marriageability. She recognizes Ash, and then herself, but willfully keeps herself from remembering her full memories. It is only when Ossin proposes to her at a ball that Lissar is forced to confront her memories, at which point she flees back to the cabin with Ash and the puppies. \n\nAfter spending the winter recovering, Lissar returns to Ossin's city due to a compulsion and discovers that a wedding is due to take place that very day. She's horrified to learn that her father is going to marry Ossin's younger sister and confronts her father, revealing her true identity as his daughter and punishing him for his crimes using the goddess's powers. While she still has mental trauma stemming from the past, Lissar is now able to accept Ossin's love and to give their relationship a chance.  \n\n== Reception ==\nIn an article for [[Tor.com]], [[Jo Walton]] noted that \"it\u2019s a dark and disturbing fairytale retelling about rape and recovery, and I wouldn\u2019t change a word of it.

R. R. Tolkien]]. He wrote the original version of the story in the late 1910s, revised it several times later, but did not complete it before his death in 1973. His son, [[Christopher Tolkien]], edited the manuscripts to form a consistent narrative, and published it in 2007 as an independent work. The book contains 33 illustrations by [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], eight of which are full-page and in colour.  The story is one of three \"great tales\" set in the [[First Age]] of Tolkien's [[Middle-earth]], the other two being ''[[Beren and L\u00fathien]]'' and ''[[The Fall of Gondolin]]''.<ref>J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien, editor, ''The Children of H\u00farin'',  p.10</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n{{Main|The Silmarillion}}\nThe history and descent of the main characters are given as the leading paragraphs of the book, and the back story is elaborated upon in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. It begins five hundred years before the action of the book, when [[Morgoth]], a [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Vala]] and the prime evil power, escapes from the Blessed Realm of [[Valinor]] to the north-west of Middle-earth. From his fortress of [[Angband]] he endeavours to gain control of the whole of Middle-earth, unleashing a war with the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] that dwell in the land of [[Beleriand]] to the south.\n\nHowever, the Elves manage to stay his assault, and most of their realms remain unconquered; one of the most powerful of these is [[Doriath]], ruled by [[Thingol]]. In addition, after some time the [[Noldor]]in Elves forsake Valinor and pursue Morgoth to Middle-earth in order to take vengeance upon him. Together with the [[Sindar]] of Beleriand, they proceed to lay siege to Angband, and establish new strongholds and realms in Middle-earth, including Hithlum ruled by Fingon, [[Nargothrond]] by [[Finrod Felagund]] and [[Gondolin]] by Turgon.\n\nThree centuries pass, during which the first [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] appear in Beleriand. These are the [[Edain]], descendants of those Men who have rebelled against the rule of Morgoth's servants and journeyed westward. Most of the Elves welcome them, and they are given fiefs throughout Beleriand. The House of B\u00ebor rules over the land of Ladros, the Folk of Haleth retreat to the forest of Brethil, and the lordship of Dor-l\u00f3min is granted to the House of Hador. Later, other Men enter Beleriand, the Easterlings, many of whom are in secret league with Morgoth.\n\nEventually Morgoth manages to break the Siege of Angband in the [[Dagor Bragollach|Battle of Sudden Flame]]. The House of B\u00ebor is destroyed and the Elves and Edain suffer heavy losses; however, many realms remain unconquered, including Dor-l\u00f3min, where the lordship has passed to [[H\u00farin|H\u00farin Thalion]].\n\n===Plot summary===\n{{See also|T\u00farin Turambar|Ni\u00ebnor}}\n[[T\u00farin]], son of [[H\u00farin]] of the race of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], lived in Dor-l\u00f3min with his father, his mother Morwen, and his sister Urwen. Urwen died as a child from a plague. T\u00farin's father was later taken prisoner by [[Morgoth]] after the Battle of Unnumbered Tears. During H\u00farin's imprisonment T\u00farin was sent by his mother to live in the Elf-realm [[Doriath]] for protection. In his absence Morwen gave birth to her third child, [[Ni\u00ebnor]], a girl. Morgoth had placed a curse upon H\u00farin and all his family whereby evil would befall them for their whole lives.\n\nKing [[Thingol]] of Doriath takes T\u00farin as a foster-son. During his time in Doriath T\u00farin befriends an Elf named Beleg, and the two become close companions. T\u00farin accidentally causes the death of the Elf Saeros, who attempts to jump a ravine while fleeing but falls and is killed. T\u00farin refuses to return to Doriath to face judgement and opts to leave Doriath, becoming an outlaw. Thingol tries T\u00farin in absentia and ultimately pardons him. He gives Beleg leave to search for T\u00farin and bring him back to Doriath.\n\nT\u00farin meanwhile joins a band of outlaws in the wild, he renames himself ''Neithan'', \"the wronged\" and eventually becomes their captain. Beleg locates the band while T\u00farin is absent, and the outlaws leave him tied to a tree until he agrees to give them information. T\u00farin returns in time to cut Beleg free and, horrified by the outlaws' actions, resolves to forsake the cruel habits he has fallen into. Beleg delivers the message of the king's pardon but T\u00farin refuses to return to Doriath. Beleg returns to aid Doriath's defence.\n\nT\u00farin and his men capture [[M\u00eem]], a [[Petty-dwarf]], who leads them to the caves at Amon R\u00fbdh. Beleg decides to return to T\u00farin, who welcomes him at Amon R\u00fbdh. The outlaws resent the elf's presence and M\u00eem, disliking Elves, grows to hate him. M\u00eem betrays the outlaws to [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]], leading the orcs to the caves where T\u00farin's company is taken unawares. The entire band is killed, save for Beleg and T\u00farin. They take T\u00farin off towards Angband, leaving Beleg chained to a rock. M\u00eem is about to kill Beleg after the orcs depart when one of the outlaws, mortally wounded, rouses himself before dying to drive M\u00eem away and release Beleg. Beleg follows the orcs after his wounds are healed.\n\nBeleg happens across a mutilated elf, Gwindor of [[Nargothrond]], sleeping in the forest of Taur-nu-Fuin. They enter the orc camp at night and carry T\u00farin, asleep, from the camp. Beleg begins to cut T\u00farin's bonds with his sword [[Anglachel]], but the sword slips in his hand and cuts T\u00farin. T\u00farin, mistaking Beleg for an orc, kills Beleg with his own sword. When a flash of lightning reveals Beleg's face, T\u00farin realises his mistake and falls into a frenzy.  He refuses to leave Beleg's body until morning, when Gwindor is able to bury the elf. T\u00farin takes Anglachel but remains witless with grief.\n\nT\u00farin and Gwindor proceed to Nargothrond. There T\u00farin gains the favour of King Orodreth, and after leading the Elves to considerable victories, he becomes Orodreth's chief counsellor and commander of his forces. Against all counsel T\u00farin refuses to hide Nargothrond from Morgoth or to retract his plans for full-scale battle. Morgoth sends an orc-army under the command of the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]], Glaurung, and Nargothrond is defeated. The orcs, crossing easily over the bridge that T\u00farin had built, sack Nargothrond and capture its citizens. T\u00farin returns as the prisoners are to be led away by the orcs, and encounters Glaurung. The dragon enchants and tricks him into returning to Dor-l\u00f3min to seek out Morwen and Ni\u00ebnor instead of rescuing the prisoners\u2014among whom is Finduilas, Orodreth's daughter, who loved him.\n\nIn Dor-l\u00f3min T\u00farin learns that Morwen and Ni\u00ebnor have long been in Doriath, and that Glaurung deceived him into letting Finduilas go to her death. He tracks Finduilas' captors to the forest of Brethil, only to learn that she was murdered by the orcs. Grief-stricken, T\u00farin seeks sanctuary among the folk of Haleth, who maintain a resistance against Morgoth. In Brethil T\u00farin renames himself ''Turambar'', \"Master of Doom\" in [[Quenya]], and gradually supplants Brandir, Brethil's lame Chieftain.\n\nIn Doriath Morwen and Ni\u00ebnor hear rumours of T\u00farin's deeds, and Morwen determines either to find T\u00farin or to hear news of his death. Against the counsel of Thingol she rides out of Doriath alone, and Ni\u00ebnor conceals herself among the riders whom Thingol sends under Mablung to follow and protect Morwen. At Nargothrond, Mablung encounters Glaurung, who scatters the elves. Finding Ni\u00ebnor alone, Glaurung discovers her identity and enchants her so that her mind is made blank; she forgets everything, including her name and how to speak.\n\nMablung attempts to return to Doriath alone with Ni\u00ebnor. The two become stranded in the wilderness, and in an orc attack, Ni\u00ebnor runs into the woods and is lost. Eventually she collapses near Brethil on the grave of Finduilas, where Turambar finds her.  He brings her back to the town, and she gradually recovers the use of speech, although she has no memory of her past life. Ni\u00ebnor and Turambar develop a strong attraction.  They marry, not realising their kinship, and Ni\u00ebnor becomes pregnant.\n\nAfter some time of peace, Glaurung returns to exterminate the men of Brethil. Turambar leads an expedition to cut him off, and stabs Glaurung from beneath while the dragon is crossing a ravine. As Glaurung is dying on the bank of the ravine, Turambar pulls his sword from the dragon's belly, and blood spurts onto his hand and burns him. Overwhelmed with pain and fatigue, he faints. Ni\u00ebnor finds him and mistakes his swoon for death. In a last effort of malice Glaurung opens his eyes and informs her that she and Turambar are brother and sister. Glaurung then dies, and his spell of forgetfulness passes from Ni\u00ebnor. Remembering her entire life and knowing that her unborn child was begotten in incest, she throws herself from the nearby cliff into the river [[Taeglin]] and is washed away. When Turambar wakes, Brandir informs him of Ni\u00ebnor's death and of their true relationship as siblings, as he had overheard the dragon's words. Mablung confirms Brandir's tale, and Turambar takes his own life upon his sword.\n\nThe main part of the narrative ends with the burial of T\u00farin. Appended to this is an extract from ''[[The Wanderings of H\u00farin]]'', the next tale of [[Tolkien's legendarium]]. This recounts how H\u00farin is at last released by Morgoth and comes to the grave of his children. There he finds Morwen, who has also managed to find the place, but now dies in the arms of her husband.\n\n==Publication history==\n''The Children of H\u00farin'' was published on 17 April 2007, by [[HarperCollins]] in the United Kingdom and Canada, and by [[Houghton Mifflin]] in the United States. [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], illustrator of other fantasy works by J. R. R. Tolkien (''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'') created the jacket painting, as well as the illustrations within the book. Christopher Tolkien also included an excursus on the evolution of the tale, several genealogical tables, and a redrawn map of [[Beleriand]].\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien wrote that the setting is intended to be our [[Earth]] several thousand years ago,<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|loc=letter No. 211}}</ref> although the geographical and historical correspondence with the real world is tenuous. The lands of [[Middle-earth]] were populated by [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] and other humanoid races: [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], and [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]], as well as divine beings, [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] and  [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiar]]. The story concentrates on a man of the House of Hador, [[T\u00farin Turambar]], and his sister [[Ni\u00ebnor N\u00edniel]], who are cursed along with their father [[H\u00farin]] by the Dark Lord [[Morgoth]]. The events take place more than 6,500 years before the [[War of the Ring]].\n\nAccording to the [[Tolkien Estate]]:\n{{quote|''The Children of H\u00farin'' takes the reader back to a time long before ''The Lord of the Rings'', in an area of Middle-earth that was to be drowned before [[Hobbit]]s appeared, and when the great enemy was still the fallen Vala, Morgoth, and [[Sauron]] was only Morgoth's lieutenant. This heroic romance is the tale of the Man, H\u00farin, who dared to defy Morgoth, and his family's tragic destiny, as it follows his son T\u00farin Turambar's travels through the lost world of Beleriand...<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tolkienestate.com/the-children-of-hurin/p_2/ |title=The Children of H\u00farin |publisher=[[Tolkien Estate]] |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref>}}\n\n===Influences===\nThe story is mainly based on the legend of [[Kullervo]], a character from the Finnish [[folklore]] poems known as ''[[Kalevala]]''. Tolkien drew inspiration from the ''Kalevala'' for \"The Story of Kullervo\" in 1914, which was to become the model for his tale of T\u00farin.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tom |last=Shippey |authorlink=Tom Shippey |editor-first=Jane |editor-last=Chance |title=Tolkien and the Invention of Myth |pages=155, 156 |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |year=2004 |isbn=9780813123011 |chapter=Tolkien and the Appeal of the Pagan |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=8LLxZXqgJdwC&q=Kullervo#v=snippet&q=T%C3%BArin&f=false}}</ref> T\u00farin also resembles [[Sigmund]], the father of [[Sigurd]] in the [[Volsunga saga]], in the incestuous relationship he had with his sister. In [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera, ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'' (also drawn in part from the Volsung myths), [[Sigmund|Siegmund]] and [[Signy|Sieglinde]] are parallels of T\u00farin and Ni\u00ebnor. T\u00farin further resembles Sigurd himself, as both achieve great renown for the slaying of a dragon of immense power and magic.\n\nT\u00farin's resemblance to figures from Classical and Medieval tales can be confirmed by a letter which Tolkien wrote to Milton Waldman, a publisher from [[HarperCollins]], concerning the fate of his works:\n\n{{quote|There is the ''Children of H\u00farin'', the tragic tale of T\u00farin Turambar and his sister N\u00edniel&nbsp;\u2013 of which T\u00farin is the hero: a figure that might be said (by people who like that sort of thing, though it is not very useful) to be derived from elements in Sigurd the Volsung, [[Oedipus]], and the Finnish Kullervo.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|loc=letter No. 131}}</ref>}}\n\nThe moral issues in ''The Children of H\u00farin'' have been compared to Tolkien's analysis of ''[[The Battle of Maldon]]'' that shows Tolkien's interest in the \"theory of courage\",<ref>{{harvnb|Solopova|2009|p=48}}, citing {{cite book|first=R.

T\u00farin's decision to build a bridge at Nargothrond which enables the invasion by Morgoth's forces resembles the character Byrthtnoth from ''The Battle of Maldon''.<ref name=Solopova48>{{harvnb|Solopova|2009|p=48}}</ref>\n\n===Themes and interpretation===\nThe themes explored in the story include evil, free will and predestination. The book reflects also on heroism and courage. It has been suggested that T\u00farin's character is not only shaped by Morgoth's curse but that he himself is also partly responsible for his actions. The curse cannot completely control his free will, and T\u00farin displays traits like arrogance, pride and a desire for honour, that eventually cause the doom of his allies and family.<ref>{{harvnb|Solopova|2009|pp=46\u201347}}</ref> It has elements of revenge tragedies such as revenge (avenging Glaurung), madness (T\u00farin's madness after finding out who N\u00edniel was), multiple deaths (Saeros, Beleg, Gwindor, Finduilas, Brodda, Ni\u00ebnor, Brandir) and disguise (T\u00farin's adopting new identities).\n\n===Writing===\n{{See also|Narn i Ch\u00een H\u00farin}}\nA brief version of the story formed the base of chapter XXI of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', setting the tale in the context of the wars of [[Beleriand]]. Although based on the same texts used to complete the new book, the ''Silmarillion'' account leaves out the greater part of the tale.\n\nOther incomplete versions have been published in other works:\n* The ''Narn i H\u00een H\u00farin'' in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''.\n* Items in the ''[[History of Middle-earth]]'' series, including:\n**''[[Turambar and the Foal\u00f3k\u00eb]]'', from ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''\n**''[[The Lay of the Children of H\u00farin]]'', an early narrative poem.\n\nNone of these writings forms a complete and mature narrative. The published ''Children of H\u00farin'' is essentially a synthesis of the ''Narn'' and of the account found in the ''Silmarillion''. The first part of ''The Children of H\u00farin'' (chapters I to VII) is taken directly from the ''Narn'' with the exception of the N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad (chapter II), which actually forms the twentieth chapter of the ''Silmarillion''; both in the ''Narn'' and in the much compressed ''Silmarillion'' version (''Of T\u00farin Turambar''), this battle is only briefly mentioned.\n\nIn the middle section (chapters VII to XII), that is, from the end of T\u00farin's residing on Amon R\u00fbdh to his return to Dor-l\u00f3min, material is mostly drawn from the ''Silmarillion'' but is often supplemented with more complete but disconnected passages from the ''Narn'' (provided by Christopher Tolkien in the Appendix of the ''Unfinished Tales''). Such more developed scenes  include the exploits of the outlaws in Dor-C\u00faarthol, T\u00farin's romantic connection with Finduilas, his debate with Gwindor over the strategy that the Elves of [[Nargothrond]] were to adopt in their fight against [[Morgoth]], as well as a much expanded account of the coming of the Elves Gelmir and Arminas to the halls of Narog. Some minor editorial process has been needed mostly to provide smooth transitions. The last section (chapters XII to XVIII) comes exclusively from the ''Narn'', with the addition, at the end of the last chapter, of H\u00farin's release from [[Angband]], and his last words to Morwen.\n\n====Editorial process====\n\nWith the publication of ''The Children of H\u00farin'', Christopher Tolkien quotes his father's own words on his fictional universe: \n{{quote|once upon a time... I had in mind to make a body of more or less connected legend... I would draw some of the great tales in fullness, and leave many only placed in the scheme, and sketched.<ref>J R R Tolkien, edited by Christopher Tolkien, ''The Children of H\u00farin'', Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 2007. {{ISBN|0-618-89464-0}},  p.9</ref>}}\n\nChristopher Tolkien gives this apology for his exercise of his authorized editorial function to produce this work of his father:\n\n{{quote|...it has seemed to me that there was a good case for presenting my father's long version of the legend of the Children of H\u00farin as an independent work, between its own covers, with a minimum of editorial presence, and above all in continuous narrative without gaps or interruptions, if this could be done without distortion or invention, despite the unfinished state in which he left parts of it.\"<ref>J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien, editor, ''The Children of H\u00farin'',  p.7</ref>}}\n\n[[Ethan Gilsdorf]] reviewing ''The Children of H\u00farin'' wrote of the editorial function:\n\n{{quote|Of almost equal interest is Christopher Tolkien's task editing his father's abandoned projects. In his appendix, he explains his editorial process this way: \"While I have had to introduce bridging passages here and there in the piecing together of different drafts, there is no element of extraneous 'invention' of any kind, however slight.\" He was criticized for having monkeyed with his father's text when putting \"The Silmarillion\" together. This pre-emptive strike must be meant to allay the fears of Tolkien's most persnickety readers.\"<ref>''The Boston Globe'' Book Review of ''The Children of H\u00farin'' by [[Ethan Gilsdorf]], 26 April 2007.</ref>}}\n\nChristopher Tolkien explains how the compilation of ''The Children of H\u00farin'' was achieved:\n\n{{quote|In the ''Unfinished Tales'' there is a third gap in the narrative on p. 96: the story breaks off at the point where [[Beleg]], having at last found T\u00farin among the outlaws, cannot persuade him to return to [[Doriath]] (pp. 115-119 in the new text), and does not take up again until the outlaws encounter the Petty-dwarves. Here I have again referred to ''The Silmarillion'' for the filling of the gap...<ref>J R R Tolkien, edited by Christopher Tolkien, ''The Children of H\u00farin'', Ballantine Books, New York, 2010. {{ISBN|0-345-51884-5}}, p. 286</ref>}}\n\nChristopher Tolkien elaborates in the ''Unfinished Tales'' concerning his use of the ''Narn'' and of the ''Silmarillion'' in order to achieve a complete account of T\u00farin's tale:\n\n{{quote|I have contrived a narrative, in scale commensurate with other parts of the ''Narn'' out of the existing materials (with one gap, see p. 124 and note 12); but from that point onwards (see p.135), I have found it unprofitable to attempt it. The gaps in the ''Narn'' are here too large, and could only be filled from the published text of ''The Silmarillion''; but in an Appendix (pp. 193 ff.) I have cited isolated fragments from this part of the projected larger narrative.<ref>J R R Tolkien, edited by Christopher Tolkien, ''Unfinished Tales'', HarperCollins, 2009. {{ISBN|0-007-32257-7}}, p.9</ref>}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe initial reviews following the publication of ''The Children of H\u00farin'' were mostly positive.

R. R. Tolkien]]. He wrote the original version of the story in the late 1910s, revised it several times later, but did not complete it before his death in 1973. His son, [[Christopher Tolkien]], edited the manuscripts to form a consistent narrative, and published it in 2007 as an independent work. The book contains 33 illustrations by [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], eight of which are full-page and in colour.  The story is one of three \"great tales\" set in the [[First Age]] of Tolkien's [[Middle-earth]], the other two being ''[[Beren and L\u00fathien]]'' and ''[[The Fall of Gondolin]]''.<ref>J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien, editor, ''The Children of H\u00farin'',  p.10</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n{{Main|The Silmarillion}}\nThe history and descent of the main characters are given as the leading paragraphs of the book, and the back story is elaborated upon in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. It begins five hundred years before the action of the book, when [[Morgoth]], a [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Vala]] and the prime evil power, escapes from the Blessed Realm of [[Valinor]] to the north-west of Middle-earth. From his fortress of [[Angband]] he endeavours to gain control of the whole of Middle-earth, unleashing a war with the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] that dwell in the land of [[Beleriand]] to the south.\n\nHowever, the Elves manage to stay his assault, and most of their realms remain unconquered; one of the most powerful of these is [[Doriath]], ruled by [[Thingol]]. In addition, after some time the [[Noldor]]in Elves forsake Valinor and pursue Morgoth to Middle-earth in order to take vengeance upon him. Together with the [[Sindar]] of Beleriand, they proceed to lay siege to Angband, and establish new strongholds and realms in Middle-earth, including Hithlum ruled by Fingon, [[Nargothrond]] by [[Finrod Felagund]] and [[Gondolin]] by Turgon.\n\nThree centuries pass, during which the first [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] appear in Beleriand. These are the [[Edain]], descendants of those Men who have rebelled against the rule of Morgoth's servants and journeyed westward. Most of the Elves welcome them, and they are given fiefs throughout Beleriand. The House of B\u00ebor rules over the land of Ladros, the Folk of Haleth retreat to the forest of Brethil, and the lordship of Dor-l\u00f3min is granted to the House of Hador. Later, other Men enter Beleriand, the Easterlings, many of whom are in secret league with Morgoth.\n\nEventually Morgoth manages to break the Siege of Angband in the [[Dagor Bragollach|Battle of Sudden Flame]]. The House of B\u00ebor is destroyed and the Elves and Edain suffer heavy losses; however, many realms remain unconquered, including Dor-l\u00f3min, where the lordship has passed to [[H\u00farin|H\u00farin Thalion]].\n\n===Plot summary===\n{{See also|T\u00farin Turambar|Ni\u00ebnor}}\n[[T\u00farin]], son of [[H\u00farin]] of the race of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], lived in Dor-l\u00f3min with his father, his mother Morwen, and his sister Urwen. Urwen died as a child from a plague. T\u00farin's father was later taken prisoner by [[Morgoth]] after the Battle of Unnumbered Tears. During H\u00farin's imprisonment T\u00farin was sent by his mother to live in the Elf-realm [[Doriath]] for protection. In his absence Morwen gave birth to her third child, [[Ni\u00ebnor]], a girl. Morgoth had placed a curse upon H\u00farin and all his family whereby evil would befall them for their whole lives.\n\nKing [[Thingol]] of Doriath takes T\u00farin as a foster-son. During his time in Doriath T\u00farin befriends an Elf named Beleg, and the two become close companions. T\u00farin accidentally causes the death of the Elf Saeros, who attempts to jump a ravine while fleeing but falls and is killed. T\u00farin refuses to return to Doriath to face judgement and opts to leave Doriath, becoming an outlaw. Thingol tries T\u00farin in absentia and ultimately pardons him. He gives Beleg leave to search for T\u00farin and bring him back to Doriath.\n\nT\u00farin meanwhile joins a band of outlaws in the wild, he renames himself ''Neithan'', \"the wronged\" and eventually becomes their captain. Beleg locates the band while T\u00farin is absent, and the outlaws leave him tied to a tree until he agrees to give them information. T\u00farin returns in time to cut Beleg free and, horrified by the outlaws' actions, resolves to forsake the cruel habits he has fallen into. Beleg delivers the message of the king's pardon but T\u00farin refuses to return to Doriath. Beleg returns to aid Doriath's defence.\n\nT\u00farin and his men capture [[M\u00eem]], a [[Petty-dwarf]], who leads them to the caves at Amon R\u00fbdh. Beleg decides to return to T\u00farin, who welcomes him at Amon R\u00fbdh. The outlaws resent the elf's presence and M\u00eem, disliking Elves, grows to hate him. M\u00eem betrays the outlaws to [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]], leading the orcs to the caves where T\u00farin's company is taken unawares. The entire band is killed, save for Beleg and T\u00farin. They take T\u00farin off towards Angband, leaving Beleg chained to a rock. M\u00eem is about to kill Beleg after the orcs depart when one of the outlaws, mortally wounded, rouses himself before dying to drive M\u00eem away and release Beleg. Beleg follows the orcs after his wounds are healed.\n\nBeleg happens across a mutilated elf, Gwindor of [[Nargothrond]], sleeping in the forest of Taur-nu-Fuin. They enter the orc camp at night and carry T\u00farin, asleep, from the camp. Beleg begins to cut T\u00farin's bonds with his sword [[Anglachel]], but the sword slips in his hand and cuts T\u00farin. T\u00farin, mistaking Beleg for an orc, kills Beleg with his own sword. When a flash of lightning reveals Beleg's face, T\u00farin realises his mistake and falls into a frenzy.  He refuses to leave Beleg's body until morning, when Gwindor is able to bury the elf. T\u00farin takes Anglachel but remains witless with grief.\n\nT\u00farin and Gwindor proceed to Nargothrond. There T\u00farin gains the favour of King Orodreth, and after leading the Elves to considerable victories, he becomes Orodreth's chief counsellor and commander of his forces. Against all counsel T\u00farin refuses to hide Nargothrond from Morgoth or to retract his plans for full-scale battle. Morgoth sends an orc-army under the command of the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]], Glaurung, and Nargothrond is defeated. The orcs, crossing easily over the bridge that T\u00farin had built, sack Nargothrond and capture its citizens. T\u00farin returns as the prisoners are to be led away by the orcs, and encounters Glaurung. The dragon enchants and tricks him into returning to Dor-l\u00f3min to seek out Morwen and Ni\u00ebnor instead of rescuing the prisoners\u2014among whom is Finduilas, Orodreth\u2019s daughter, who loved him.\n\nIn Dor-l\u00f3min T\u00farin learns that Morwen and Ni\u00ebnor have long been in Doriath, and that Glaurung deceived him into letting Finduilas go to her death. He tracks Finduilas' captors to the forest of Brethil, only to learn that she was murdered by the orcs. Grief-stricken, T\u00farin seeks sanctuary among the folk of Haleth, who maintain a resistance against Morgoth. In Brethil T\u00farin renames himself ''Turambar'', \"Master of Doom\" in [[Quenya]], and gradually supplants Brandir, Brethil's lame Chieftain.\n\nIn Doriath Morwen and Ni\u00ebnor hear rumours of T\u00farin's deeds, and Morwen determines either to find T\u00farin or to hear news of his death. Against the counsel of Thingol she rides out of Doriath alone, and Ni\u00ebnor conceals herself among the riders whom Thingol sends under Mablung to follow and protect Morwen. At Nargothrond, Mablung encounters Glaurung, who scatters the elves. Finding Ni\u00ebnor alone, Glaurung discovers her identity and enchants her so that her mind is made blank; she forgets everything, including her name and how to speak.\n\nMablung attempts to return to Doriath alone with Ni\u00ebnor. The two become stranded in the wilderness, and in an orc attack, Ni\u00ebnor runs into the woods and is lost. Eventually she collapses near Brethil on the grave of Finduilas, where Turambar finds her.  He brings her back to the town, and she gradually recovers the use of speech, although she has no memory of her past life. Ni\u00ebnor and Turambar develop a strong attraction.  They marry, not realising their kinship, and Ni\u00ebnor becomes pregnant.\n\nAfter some time of peace, Glaurung returns to exterminate the men of Brethil. Turambar leads an expedition to cut him off, and stabs Glaurung from beneath while the dragon is crossing a ravine. As Glaurung is dying on the bank of the ravine, Turambar pulls his sword from the dragon's belly, and blood spurts onto his hand and burns him. Overwhelmed with pain and fatigue, he faints. Ni\u00ebnor finds him and mistakes his swoon for death. In a last effort of malice Glaurung opens his eyes and informs her that she and Turambar are brother and sister. Glaurung then dies, and his spell of forgetfulness passes from Ni\u00ebnor. Remembering her entire life and knowing that her unborn child was begotten in incest, she throws herself from the nearby cliff into the river [[Taeglin]] and is washed away. When Turambar wakes, Brandir informs him of Ni\u00ebnor's death and of their true relationship as siblings, as he had overheard the dragon's words. Mablung confirms Brandir's tale, and Turambar takes his own life upon his sword.\n\nThe main part of the narrative ends with the burial of T\u00farin. Appended to this is an extract from ''[[The Wanderings of H\u00farin]]'', the next tale of [[Tolkien's legendarium]]. This recounts how H\u00farin is at last released by Morgoth and comes to the grave of his children. There he finds Morwen, who has also managed to find the place, but now dies in the arms of her husband.\n\n==Publication history==\n''The Children of H\u00farin'' was published on 17 April 2007, by [[HarperCollins]] in the United Kingdom and Canada, and by [[Houghton Mifflin]] in the United States. [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], illustrator of other fantasy works by J. R. R. Tolkien (''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'') created the jacket painting, as well as the illustrations within the book. Christopher Tolkien also included an excursus on the evolution of the tale, several genealogical tables, and a redrawn map of [[Beleriand]].\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien wrote that the setting is intended to be our [[Earth]] several thousand years ago,<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|loc=letter No. 211}}</ref> although the geographical and historical correspondence with the real world is tenuous. The lands of [[Middle-earth]] were populated by [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] and other humanoid races: [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], and [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]], as well as divine beings, [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] and  [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiar]]. The story concentrates on a man of the House of Hador, [[T\u00farin Turambar]], and his sister [[Ni\u00ebnor N\u00edniel]], who are cursed along with their father [[H\u00farin]] by the Dark Lord [[Morgoth]]. The events take place more than 6,500 years before the [[War of the Ring]].\n\nAccording to the [[Tolkien Estate]]:\n{{quote|''The Children of H\u00farin'' takes the reader back to a time long before ''The Lord of the Rings'', in an area of Middle-earth that was to be drowned before [[Hobbit]]s appeared, and when the great enemy was still the fallen Vala, Morgoth, and [[Sauron]] was only Morgoth's lieutenant. This heroic romance is the tale of the Man, H\u00farin, who dared to defy Morgoth, and his family's tragic destiny, as it follows his son T\u00farin Turambar's travels through the lost world of Beleriand...<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tolkienestate.com/the-children-of-hurin/p_2/ |title=The Children of H\u00farin |publisher=[[Tolkien Estate]] |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref>}}\n\n===Influences===\nThe story is mainly based on the legend of [[Kullervo]], a character from the Finnish [[folklore]] poems known as ''[[Kalevala]]''. Tolkien drew inspiration from the ''Kalevala'' for \"The Story of Kullervo\" in 1914, which was to become the model for his tale of T\u00farin.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tom |last=Shippey |authorlink=Tom Shippey |editor-first=Jane |editor-last=Chance |title=Tolkien and the Invention of Myth |pages=155, 156 |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |year=2004 |isbn=9780813123011 |chapter=Tolkien and the Appeal of the Pagan |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=8LLxZXqgJdwC&q=Kullervo#v=snippet&q=T%C3%BArin&f=false}}</ref> T\u00farin also resembles [[Sigmund]], the father of [[Sigurd]] in the [[Volsunga saga]], in the incestuous relationship he had with his sister. In [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera, ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'' (also drawn in part from the Volsung myths), [[Sigmund|Siegmund]] and [[Signy|Sieglinde]] are parallels of T\u00farin and Ni\u00ebnor. T\u00farin further resembles Sigurd himself, as both achieve great renown for the slaying of a dragon of immense power and magic.\n\nT\u00farin's resemblance to figures from Classical and Medieval tales can be confirmed by a letter which Tolkien wrote to Milton Waldman, a publisher from [[HarperCollins]], concerning the fate of his works:\n\n{{quote|There is the ''Children of H\u00farin'', the tragic tale of T\u00farin Turambar and his sister N\u00edniel&nbsp;\u2013 of which T\u00farin is the hero: a figure that might be said (by people who like that sort of thing, though it is not very useful) to be derived from elements in Sigurd the Volsung, [[Oedipus]], and the Finnish Kullervo.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|loc=letter No. 131}}</ref>}}\n\nThe moral issues in ''The Children of H\u00farin'' have been compared to Tolkien's analysis of ''[[The Battle of Maldon]]'' that shows Tolkien's interest in the \"theory of courage\",<ref>{{harvnb|Solopova|2009|p=48}}, citing {{cite book|first=R.

T\u00farin's decision to build a bridge at Nargothrond which enables the invasion by Morgoth's forces resembles the character Byrthtnoth from ''The Battle of Maldon''.<ref name=Solopova48>{{harvnb|Solopova|2009|p=48}}</ref>\n\n===Themes and interpretation===\nThe themes explored in the story include evil, free will and predestination. The book reflects also on heroism and courage. It has been suggested that T\u00farin's character is not only shaped by Morgoth's curse but that he himself is also partly responsible for his actions. The curse cannot completely control his free will, and T\u00farin displays traits like arrogance, pride and a desire for honour, that eventually cause the doom of his allies and family.<ref>{{harvnb|Solopova|2009|pp=46\u201347}}</ref> It has elements of revenge tragedies such as revenge (avenging Glaurung), madness (T\u00farin's madness after finding out who N\u00edniel was), multiple deaths (Saeros, Beleg, Gwindor, Finduilas, Brodda, Ni\u00ebnor, Brandir) and disguise (T\u00farin's adopting new identities).\n\n===Writing===\n{{See also|Narn i Ch\u00een H\u00farin}}\nA brief version of the story formed the base of chapter XXI of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', setting the tale in the context of the wars of [[Beleriand]]. Although based on the same texts used to complete the new book, the ''Silmarillion'' account leaves out the greater part of the tale.\n\nOther incomplete versions have been published in other works:\n* The ''Narn i H\u00een H\u00farin'' in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''.\n* Items in the ''[[History of Middle-earth]]'' series, including:\n**''[[Turambar and the Foal\u00f3k\u00eb]]'', from ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''\n**''[[The Lay of the Children of H\u00farin]]'', an early narrative poem.\n\nNone of these writings forms a complete and mature narrative. The published ''Children of H\u00farin'' is essentially a synthesis of the ''Narn'' and of the account found in the ''Silmarillion''. The first part of ''The Children of H\u00farin'' (chapters I to VII) is taken directly from the ''Narn'' with the exception of the N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad (chapter II), which actually forms the twentieth chapter of the ''Silmarillion''; both in the ''Narn'' and in the much compressed ''Silmarillion'' version (''Of T\u00farin Turambar''), this battle is only briefly mentioned.\n\nIn the middle section (chapters VII to XII), that is, from the end of T\u00farin's residing on Amon R\u00fbdh to his return to Dor-l\u00f3min, material is mostly drawn from the ''Silmarillion'' but is often supplemented with more complete but disconnected passages from the ''Narn'' (provided by Christopher Tolkien in the Appendix of the ''Unfinished Tales''). Such more developed scenes  include the exploits of the outlaws in Dor-C\u00faarthol, T\u00farin's romantic connection with Finduilas, his debate with Gwindor over the strategy that the Elves of [[Nargothrond]] were to adopt in their fight against [[Morgoth]], as well as a much expanded account of the coming of the Elves Gelmir and Arminas to the halls of Narog. Some minor editorial process has been needed mostly to provide smooth transitions. The last section (chapters XII to XVIII) comes exclusively from the ''Narn'', with the addition, at the end of the last chapter, of H\u00farin's release from [[Angband]], and his last words to Morwen.\n\n====Editorial process====\n\nWith the publication of ''The Children of H\u00farin'', Christopher Tolkien quotes his father's own words on his fictional universe: \n{{quote|once upon a time... I had in mind to make a body of more or less connected legend... I would draw some of the great tales in fullness, and leave many only placed in the scheme, and sketched.<ref>J R R Tolkien, edited by Christopher Tolkien, ''The Children of H\u00farin'', Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 2007. {{ISBN|0-618-89464-0}},  p.9</ref>}}\n\nChristopher Tolkien gives this apology for his exercise of his authorized editorial function to produce this work of his father:\n\n{{quote|...it has seemed to me that there was a good case for presenting my father's long version of the legend of the Children of H\u00farin as an independent work, between its own covers, with a minimum of editorial presence, and above all in continuous narrative without gaps or interruptions, if this could be done without distortion or invention, despite the unfinished state in which he left parts of it.\"<ref>J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien, editor, ''The Children of H\u00farin'',  p.7</ref>}}\n\n[[Ethan Gilsdorf]] reviewing ''The Children of H\u00farin'' wrote of the editorial function:\n\n{{quote|Of almost equal interest is Christopher Tolkien's task editing his father's abandoned projects. In his appendix, he explains his editorial process this way: \"While I have had to introduce bridging passages here and there in the piecing together of different drafts, there is no element of extraneous 'invention' of any kind, however slight.\" He was criticized for having monkeyed with his father's text when putting \"The Silmarillion\" together. This pre-emptive strike must be meant to allay the fears of Tolkien's most persnickety readers.\"<ref>''The Boston Globe'' Book Review of ''The Children of H\u00farin'' by [[Ethan Gilsdorf]], 26 April 2007.</ref>}}\n\nChristopher Tolkien explains how the compilation of ''The Children of H\u00farin'' was achieved:\n\n{{quote|In the ''Unfinished Tales'' there is a third gap in the narrative on p. 96: the story breaks off at the point where [[Beleg]], having at last found T\u00farin among the outlaws, cannot persuade him to return to [[Doriath]] (pp. 115-119 in the new text), and does not take up again until the outlaws encounter the Petty-dwarves.

The gaps in the ''Narn'' are here too large, and could only be filled from the published text of ''The Silmarillion''; but in an Appendix (pp. 193 ff.) I have cited isolated fragments from this part of the projected larger narrative.<ref>J R R Tolkien, edited by Christopher Tolkien, ''Unfinished Tales'', HarperCollins, 2009. {{ISBN|0-007-32257-7}}, p.9</ref>}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe initial reviews following the publication of ''The Children of H\u00farin'' were mostly positive.

''I'm in love with my sister''; abbreviated to '''''BokuImo'''''}} is a manga series by [[Kotomi Aoki]]. Originally serialized in ''[[Sh\u014djo Comic]]'', the individual chapters were published in ten ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes by [[Shogakukan]] from May 2003 until August 2005. The series focus on fraternal twins Yori and Iku, who fall in love with one another [[incest|despite being siblings]].\n\nThe manga series was adapted into a one-episode [[original video animation]] that was released in May 2005 and a live-action film starring [[Jun Matsumoto]] and [[Nana Eikura]] that premiered in Japan on January 20, 2007.\n\nA ten volume spin-off series focusing on Yori's upperclassmen Takuma Kakinouchi and his childhood sweetheart Mayu Taneda was serialized in ''Sh\u014djo Comic'' from December 2005 through August 2008. It is called '''Boku no Hatsukoi o Kimi ni Sasagu''' (abbreviated to '''''BokuKimi''''') and means \"I Give My First Love to You\".\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=March 2016}}\n\nYori and Iku Yuki are twin brother and sister, who have been extremely close since they were born. During their childhood, Yori used to tell their parents that he would marry Iku. While their parents brushed this off as an innocent childhood fantasy, Yori knew that his feelings were more than an innocent crush on his sister. When they are fifteen, his feelings have grown stronger than before. Yori has by now understood that he has fallen deeply and hopelessly in love with Iku, which makes him feel ashamed. Due to that they share a bedroom, Yori finds it harder and harder to resist his feelings for her, so he begins to distance himself from her and acts coldly to her. Iku is hurt and shaken by his harsh treatment towards her, but she tries to remain cheerful and make him smile. One day during school, Yori gets into a fight after a classmate makes fun of Iku, and gets injured. Tomoka Kusunoki, Iku's best friend, tends to his injury and tries to comfort him. In midst of this, she suddenly kisses him and professes her love to him. When she asks him if she is good enough for him, he sees this as an opportunity to surpass his feelings for Iku. He proceeds to kiss her and has sex with her at a hotel. This encounter, however, does nothing to help him forget his lust for Iku. Tomoka mistakenly thinks that Yori reciprocates her feelings and calls him her boyfriend. Yori, however, decides to hide this from Iku so she won't get upset. He later tries a new strategy: go to an out-of-town high school. Days later, Yori and Iku get into a fight after Iku talks about her dreams of having a boyfriend and going on dates. Yori gets really mad about this and yells at Iku to shut up. Iku does but starts crying. While she is crying, he kisses her, which shocks her, and he confesses his love to her. Iku is taken aback by his confession and rejects his advances because he is her brother. However, she sees the sadness on his face and realizes that, while she is uncertain if she loves him more than a brother, she may lose him by rejecting him. She kisses him and feels uncomfortable by it, which Yori notices and tells her to wait until she is sure of her love for him. Over the next several days, they try to begin an intimate relationship, with Iku slowly growing adjusted to Yori's advances, and keeping their parents in the dark. Haruka Yano, Yori's best friend, immediately notices the twins' closeness but doesn't tell them. Iku continued to be torn between her guilt of committing twincest and her desire to remain together with Yori. Her guilt, however, completely disappears when she discovers that Yori is planning to enroll in a different high school and that he has been seeing Tomoka. She tries to have sex with Yori, but in the process, he rejects her because she still doesn't love him yet. The next day, as she sees Tomoka clinging to Yori, Iku realizes that she has finally fallen in love with Yori. After confessing to him, they skip school and flee to a church, where they remember playing at when they were little. They try to have sex in the church, but Iku tells him to stop because she feels that God is watching them. Yori agrees and decide to go home.\n\nSoon after, during school, Tomoka talks with Iku and their friends about her first time with Yori, which angers Iku. Yori comes in and tells Tomoka that their relationship is over before leaving with Iku. Tomoka smiles while crying and doesn't understand why he broke up with her so suddenly. When someone mentions that Yori probably has someone else he likes, she quickly realizes that that person is Iku. Iku fights with Yori over his indiscretion with Tomoka. He hugs her as she tries to get away from him, but when she sees him cry, she gives into her feelings and hugs him back. Later that day, Iku has Yori meet up with her and tells him that she wants to make love to him right now, which shocks but pleases him. They go to a hotel, and after Iku is initially apprehensive, they finally have sex for the first time. Yori is thrilled that Iku is his, but feels guilty and asks for God to punish only him. Days later, they graduate from junior high school and Iku realizes that Yori still plans to leave for a different high school. Yori tells Yano the truth of his relationship with Iku, which Yano knew but he asks why is he still leaving. Yori says that he is torn between his desire to protect this relationship versus the obligation to destroy it. Yori tries to comfort Iku, who asks why he wants to go. Yori says he doesn't want to leave, but if he stays, they can't be a normal couple. However, if they were another city, where no one knows them, they could be a couple. Iku reluctantly agrees to let him go, with the promise that they will stay in touch.\n\nYori arrives at his high school, and to his horror, he finds that Tomoka has enrolled in the same school. She tries to get him to take her back, but he rejects her, which doesn't seem to bother her. For their sixteenth birthday, Yori and Iku receive cell phones, which makes easier for them to stay in contact. Iku visits with Yori as much as possible because Yori is allowed limited visits outside of the school. He befriends Takuma Kakinouchi and his girlfriend Mayu Taneda, who act as his confidants. For his birthday present to her, Yori gives Iku a diamond clover ring as a promise of eternal love. Separated from Yori for weeks at a time, Iku is placed in the care of Yano, who acts as her protector. Yano helps the twins see each other at school and even arranges them to spend the night together. When he tells Iku that he knows about the relationship, he assures her that he will keep it a secret. However, as he spends time with her, Yano slowly falls in love with Iku. Yori vows that he will never give Iku up, and the two best friends have a friendly rivalry over Iku, who is oblivious to Yano's feelings. The twins' parents mistake Yano as Iku's boyfriend and take an instant liking to him, but he says that they are not a couple. When he does tell Iku that he likes her, Iku rejects him because she loves Yori.\n\nYori soon realizes that Tomoka is determined to get revenge against him and Iku for breaking up with her. She has them get caught in Yori's room by fellow students several times in order to expel him, as girls are forbidden to be in boys' dorms. When Yori gets light punishments for the offenses, she takes a [[camera phone|cell phone picture]] of the two kissing and threatens to send it to everyone they know if he doesn't sleep with her. When he appears to accept the deal, he deletes the picture and tells her to leave him and Iku alone. Tomoka, however, refuses to listen and continues with her plan to expel him. Some time later, while Yano is at Iku's house, her father comes home and happily tells his wife that he ran into their longtime friend, Dr. Yuugo Mori, which takes her aback. He tells her that Yuugo has a daughter who is the same age as Yori and Iku, and promised to have Yori engaged to the girl. The twins' mother refuses this and asks about when he said the girl is similar to Yori. This sounds suspicious to Yano, who tells Yori that he thinks Iku might not be his sister. Yori rejects this possibility, even though he secretly hopes it is true. When Iku sneaks into the school to visit Yori, Tomoka hires a group of classmates to rape Iku. Fortunately, Yori catches them and punishes them and Tomoka. The school principal decides to expel Yori for continuing to let Iku into his dorm. Iku is happy of the news, which annoys Tomoka and calls her stupid. Yori defends Iku from Tomoka's insult, and she threatens to tell his mother about the twincestuous relationship. He doesn't believe her, but the twins find that their mother has overheard the conversation. Again, Yano lies, saying that Tomoka was joking and Iku is his girlfriend. Their mother does not believe them, but doesn't say it out of fear, and takes the twins home. Yori enrolls into Iku's high school, where they meet Yuugo's daughter Azusa. She notices that Yori and Iku don't resemble each other while she looks just like Yori. Azusa tells her father of how different the twins are, and after he invites the Yuki family over to his house and he sees Yori for the first time, he confronts their mother. Yori witnesses an intimate moment between the two and suspects that they may have had an affair. He later finds Iku's unfilled birth certificate and photographs of his parents with Yuugo. Azusa confesses to Yori that she believes they are half-siblings, and then Yuugo confesses that he has been in love with Yori's mother since college and he believes that he is Yori's biological father. He secretly uses a piece of Yori's hair to do a DNA test, which confirms his suspicions. He tells the twins' mother of the news and is shocked when she admits she knows Yori is his son. She had kept it a secret out of fear of ruining her family. Yori and Yano consulte a family friend of Yano's, who says that the unfilled birth certificate could indicate Iku was abandoned as an infant and then adopted by their parents. After this, Yori makes his feelings for Iku clear to his mother, who reacts in shock. She tells Yori to stay away from Iku because they are siblings. Yori doesn't believe her and threatens to destroy the family if she tells anyone about the relationship. With his mother horrified, he takes Iku to their room. As they are making love, their mother confronts them and tells them that they are siblings, but Yori asks her to answer his question about Iku's birth certificate. She tells the twins and their father that they are twins, but half-twins; they are the result of [[heteropaternal superfecundation]]. She tells them that Yori is her son with Yuugo Mori and Iku is her daughter by her husband. Sixteen years ago, when she was about to marry her husband, Yuugo confessed his love to her, and although she had feelings for him, she refused him. At that moment, he kissed her and they had sex. She tried to forget about the betrayal and slept with her husband on the same day. Three months later, she found out she was pregnant with twins and was unsure who the father was, until the twins were born and saw the physical difference between them. She becomes physically ill after telling the story and lashes out at Yori for his twincest with Iku.\n\nRealizing that they may be separated now that their parents know their secret, Yori and Iku run away from home with Yano's help and stay at his beach cottage. Yori tells Iku that if they had a child together, their parents will never have to separate them. Iku is hesitant at this idea, but agrees, and they make love in an attempt to conceive. Later on, they go to a church to pray, and Yori realizes Iku cannot give sacrifice their family to be with him and decides the right thing to do is to end the relationship. They decide to return home and reconcile with their parents. Yori decides to leave the family and go somewhere he can never be found so that his and Iku's feelings will fade away. Before departing, he cuts Iku's hair from what it looked like from her childhood at her request, and he slips out when she falls asleep. When she wakes up and finds him gone, Iku falls into a deep depression. However, she soon realizes that she never did anything for Yori and resolves to find him no matter how long it takes. Over the next ten years, Iku manages to get into a university and becomes a sales representative for Yano's company. Yano has frequently asked Iku to marry him, but she rejects him. During a trip to England, she goes to a library because she thinks it would be a place Yori would go to. They finally pass each other, but don't recognize the other until after a few seconds, and turn around and embrace. In the climax, Yori states that he is still in love with Iku.\n\n==Characters==\n* {{nihongo|'''Yori Yuki'''|\u7d50\u57ce \u983c|Y\u016bki Yori}}: ({{Voiced by|[[Shotaro Morikubo]]}}, Portrayed by: [[Jun Matsumoto]]) The male lead character.

Halfway through the series, it turns out that Yori is Iku's half-twin brother and he was fathered by their father's best friend, who slept with his mother in the day of her wedding. When their parents find out about their relationship, they run away and act as a normal couple until they pray at a church.

''I'm in love with my sister''; abbreviated to '''''BokuImo'''''}} is a manga series by [[Kotomi Aoki]]. Originally serialized in ''[[Sh\u014djo Comic]]'', the individual chapters were published in ten ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes by [[Shogakukan]] from May 2003 until August 2005. The series focus on fraternal twins Yori and Iku, who fall in love with one another [[incest|despite being siblings]].\n\nThe manga series was adapted into a one-episode [[original video animation]] that was released in May 2005 and a live-action film starring [[Jun Matsumoto]] and [[Nana Eikura]] that premiered in Japan on January 20, 2007.\n\nA ten volume spin-off series focusing on Yori's upperclassmen Takuma Kakinouchi and his childhood sweetheart Mayu Taneda was serialized in ''Sh\u014djo Comic'' from December 2005 through August 2008. It is called '''Boku no Hatsukoi o Kimi ni Sasagu''' (abbreviated to '''''BokuKimi''''') and means \"I Give My First Love to You\".\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=March 2016}}\n\nYori and Iku Yuki are twin brother and sister, who have been extremely close since they were born. During their childhood, Yori used to tell their parents that he would marry Iku. While their parents brushed this off as an innocent childhood fantasy, Yori knew that his feelings were more than an innocent crush on his sister. When they are fifteen, his feelings have grown stronger than before. Yori has by now understood that he has fallen deeply and hopelessly in love with Iku, which makes him feel ashamed. Due to that they share a bedroom, Yori finds it harder and harder to resist his feelings for her, so he begins to distance himself from her and acts coldly to her. Iku is hurt and shaken by his harsh treatment towards her, but she tries to remain cheerful and make him smile. One day during school, Yori gets into a fight after a classmate makes fun of Iku, and gets injured. Tomoka Kusunoki, Iku's best friend, tends to his injury and tries to comfort him. In midst of this, she suddenly kisses him and professes her love to him. When she asks him if she is good enough for him, he sees this as an opportunity to surpass his feelings for Iku. He proceeds to kiss her and has sex with her at a hotel. This encounter, however, does nothing to help him forget his lust for Iku. Tomoka mistakenly thinks that Yori reciprocates her feelings and calls him her boyfriend. Yori, however, decides to hide this from Iku so she won't get upset. He later tries a new strategy: go to an out-of-town high school. Days later, Yori and Iku get into a fight after Iku talks about her dreams of having a boyfriend and going on dates. Yori gets really mad about this and yells at Iku to shut up. Iku does but starts crying. While she is crying, he kisses her, which shocks her, and he confesses his love to her. Iku is taken aback by his confession and rejects his advances because he is her brother. However, she sees the sadness on his face and realizes that, while she is uncertain if she loves him more than a brother, she may lose him by rejecting him. She kisses him and feels uncomfortable by it, which Yori notices and tells her to wait until she is sure of her love for him. Over the next several days, they try to begin an intimate relationship, with Iku slowly growing adjusted to Yori's advances, and keeping their parents in the dark. Haruka Yano, Yori's best friend, immediately notices the twins' closeness but doesn't tell them. Iku continued to be torn between her guilt of committing twincest and her desire to remain together with Yori. Her guilt, however, completely disappears when she discovers that Yori is planning to enroll in a different high school and that he has been seeing Tomoka. She tries to have sex with Yori, but in the process, he rejects her because she still doesn't love him yet. The next day, as she sees Tomoka clinging to Yori, Iku realizes that she has finally fallen in love with Yori. After confessing to him, they skip school and flee to a church, where they remember playing at when they were little. They try to have sex in the church, but Iku tells him to stop because she feels that God is watching them. Yori agrees and decide to go home.\n\nSoon after, during school, Tomoka talks with Iku and their friends about her first time with Yori, which angers Iku. Yori comes in and tells Tomoka that their relationship is over before leaving with Iku. Tomoka smiles while crying and doesn't understand why he broke up with her so suddenly. When someone mentions that Yori probably has someone else he likes, she quickly realizes that that person is Iku. Iku fights with Yori over his indiscretion with Tomoka. He hugs her as she tries to get away from him, but when she sees him cry, she gives into her feelings and hugs him back. Later that day, Iku has Yori meet up with her and tells him that she wants to make love to him right now, which shocks but pleases him. They go to a hotel, and after Iku is initially apprehensive, they finally have sex for the first time. Yori is thrilled that Iku is his, but feels guilty and asks for God to punish only him. Days later, they graduate from junior high school and Iku realizes that Yori still plans to leave for a different high school. Yori tells Yano the truth of his relationship with Iku, which Yano knew but he asks why is he still leaving. Yori says that he is torn between his desire to protect this relationship versus the obligation to destroy it. Yori tries to comfort Iku, who asks why he wants to go. Yori says he doesn't want to leave, but if he stays, they can't be a normal couple. However, if they were another city, where no one knows them, they could be a couple. Iku reluctantly agrees to let him go, with the promise that they will stay in touch.\n\nYori arrives at his high school, and to his horror, he finds that Tomoka has enrolled in the same school. She tries to get him to take her back, but he rejects her, which doesn't seem to bother her. For their sixteenth birthday, Yori and Iku receive cell phones, which makes easier for them to stay in contact. Iku visits with Yori as much as possible because Yori is allowed limited visits outside of the school. He befriends Takuma Kakinouchi and his girlfriend Mayu Taneda, who act as his confidants. For his birthday present to her, Yori gives Iku a diamond clover ring as a promise of eternal love. Separated from Yori for weeks at a time, Iku is placed in the care of Yano, who acts as her protector. Yano helps the twins see each other at school and even arranges them to spend the night together. When he tells Iku that he knows about the relationship, he assures her that he will keep it a secret. However, as he spends time with her, Yano slowly falls in love with Iku. Yori vows that he will never give Iku up, and the two best friends have a friendly rivalry over Iku, who is oblivious to Yano's feelings. The twins' parents mistake Yano as Iku's boyfriend and take an instant liking to him, but he says that they are not a couple. When he does tell Iku that he likes her, Iku rejects him because she loves Yori.\n\nYori soon realizes that Tomoka is determined to get revenge against him and Iku for breaking up with her. She has them get caught in Yori's room by fellow students several times in order to expel him, as girls are forbidden to be in boys' dorms. When Yori gets light punishments for the offenses, she takes a [[camera phone|cell phone picture]] of the two kissing and threatens to send it to everyone they know if he doesn't sleep with her. When he appears to accept the deal, he deletes the picture and tells her to leave him and Iku alone. Tomoka, however, refuses to listen and continues with her plan to expel him. Some time later, while Yano is at Iku's house, her father comes home and happily tells his wife that he ran into their longtime friend, Dr. Yuugo Mori, which takes her aback. He tells her that Yuugo has a daughter who is the same age as Yori and Iku, and promised to have Yori engaged to the girl. The twins' mother refuses this and asks about when he said the girl is similar to Yori. This sounds suspicious to Yano, who tells Yori that he thinks Iku might not be his sister. Yori rejects this possibility, even though he secretly hopes it is true. When Iku sneaks into the school to visit Yori, Tomoka hires a group of classmates to rape Iku. Fortunately, Yori catches them and punishes them and Tomoka. The school principal decides to expel Yori for continuing to let Iku into his dorm. Iku is happy of the news, which annoys Tomoka and calls her stupid. Yori defends Iku from Tomoka's insult, and she threatens to tell his mother about the twincestuous relationship. He doesn't believe her, but the twins find that their mother has overheard the conversation. Again, Yano lies, saying that Tomoka was joking and Iku is his girlfriend. Their mother does not believe them, but doesn't say it out of fear, and takes the twins home. Yori enrolls into Iku's high school, where they meet Yuugo's daughter Azusa. She notices that Yori and Iku don't resemble each other while she looks just like Yori. Azusa tells her father of how different the twins are, and after he invites the Yuki family over to his house and he sees Yori for the first time, he confronts their mother. Yori witnesses an intimate moment between the two and suspects that they may have had an affair. He later finds Iku's unfilled birth certificate and photographs of his parents with Yuugo. Azusa confesses to Yori that she believes they are half-siblings, and then Yuugo confesses that he has been in love with Yori's mother since college and he believes that he is Yori's biological father. He secretly uses a piece of Yori's hair to do a DNA test, which confirms his suspicions. He tells the twins' mother of the news and is shocked when she admits she knows Yori is his son. She had kept it a secret out of fear of ruining her family. Yori and Yano consulte a family friend of Yano\u2019s, who says that the unfilled birth certificate could indicate Iku was abandoned as an infant and then adopted by their parents. After this, Yori makes his feelings for Iku clear to his mother, who reacts in shock. She tells Yori to stay away from Iku because they are siblings. Yori doesn't believe her and threatens to destroy the family if she tells anyone about the relationship. With his mother horrified, he takes Iku to their room. As they are making love, their mother confronts them and tells them that they are siblings, but Yori asks her to answer his question about Iku's birth certificate. She tells the twins and their father that they are twins, but half-twins; they are the result of [[heteropaternal superfecundation]]. She tells them that Yori is her son with Yuugo Mori and Iku is her daughter by her husband. Sixteen years ago, when she was about to marry her husband, Yuugo confessed his love to her, and although she had feelings for him, she refused him. At that moment, he kissed her and they had sex. She tried to forget about the betrayal and slept with her husband on the same day. Three months later, she found out she was pregnant with twins and was unsure who the father was, until the twins were born and saw the physical difference between them. She becomes physically ill after telling the story and lashes out at Yori for his twincest with Iku.\n\nRealizing that they may be separated now that their parents know their secret, Yori and Iku run away from home with Yano's help and stay at his beach cottage. Yori tells Iku that if they had a child together, their parents will never have to separate them. Iku is hesitant at this idea, but agrees, and they make love in an attempt to conceive. Later on, they go to a church to pray, and Yori realizes Iku cannot give sacrifice their family to be with him and decides the right thing to do is to end the relationship. They decide to return home and reconcile with their parents. Yori decides to leave the family and go somewhere he can never be found so that his and Iku's feelings will fade away. Before departing, he cuts Iku's hair from what it looked like from her childhood at her request, and he slips out when she falls asleep. When she wakes up and finds him gone, Iku falls into a deep depression. However, she soon realizes that she never did anything for Yori and resolves to find him no matter how long it takes. Over the next ten years, Iku manages to get into a university and becomes a sales representative for Yano's company. Yano has frequently asked Iku to marry him, but she rejects him. During a trip to England, she goes to a library because she thinks it would be a place Yori would go to. They finally pass each other, but don't recognize the other until after a few seconds, and turn around and embrace. In the climax, Yori states that he is still in love with Iku.\n\n==Characters==\n* {{nihongo|'''Yori Yuki'''|\u7d50\u57ce \u983c|Y\u016bki Yori}}: ({{Voiced by|[[Shotaro Morikubo]]}}, Portrayed by: [[Jun Matsumoto]]) The male lead character.

When their parents find out about their relationship, they run away and act as a normal couple until they pray at a church.
