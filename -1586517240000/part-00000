The very first, possibly from the whole area, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of the area's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nJan was followed by the Tichacek family to St. Louis in 1857 and Jan \"John Adam\" Stupka (1825-1914) who settled in [[Monmouth, Iowa]] around 1859. Immigration slowed because of the [[American Civil War]] in which Duban served in the [[Union Army|Union army]]. This lasted until the later half of the 1860s.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi.

This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice. The grave of Ladislav Stehl\u00edk is decorated with a bust by sculptor B\u0159etislav Benda.\n\nBlanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 (1933) - historian\n\nArt historian, journalist PhDr. Blanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 Csc.

The very first, possibly from the whole area, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of the area's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nJan was followed by the Tichacek family to St. Louis in 1857 and Jan \"John Adam\" Stupka (1825-1914) who settled in [[Monmouth, Iowa]] around 1859. Immigration slowed because of the [[American Civil War]] in which Duban served in the [[Union Army|Union army]]. This lasted until the later half of the 1860s.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi. From May 1930 until the liberation in 1945, ie for fifteen years, he worked as a teacher in the village of \u0160umava at the elementary school in Mysl\u00edv, Klatovy.\n\nLadislav Stehl\u00edk's Mysl\u00edv stay inspired him to write six poetry collections. This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession.

In this last capacity it lends its name to a system of government, [[tsarist autocracy]] or tsarism. The term is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''[[Caesar (title)|caesar]]'', which was intended to mean \"[[emperor]]\" in the European medieval sense of the term\u2014a ruler with the same rank as a [[Roman emperor]], holding it by the approval of another emperor or a supreme ecclesiastical official (the [[Pope]] or the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]])\u2014but was usually considered by western Europeans to be equivalent to king, or to be somewhat in between a royal and imperial rank.\n\n\"Tsar\" and its variants were the official titles of the following states:\n* [[First Bulgarian Empire]], in 919\u20131018\n* [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], in 1185\u20131396\n* [[Serbian Empire]], in 1346\u20131371\n* [[Tsardom of Russia]], in 1547\u20131721 (replaced in 1721 by ''[[imperator]]'', but still remaining in use, also officially in relation to several regions until 1917)\n* [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Tsardom of Bulgaria]], in 1908\u20131946\n\nThe first ruler to adopt the title ''tsar'' was [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]].<ref>\"Simeon I.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. 2009. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online. 12 July 2009, [http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9067834 EB.com].</ref> [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Simeon II]], the last [[tsar of Bulgaria]], is the last person to have borne the title tsar.\n\n==Meaning in Slavic languages==\nThe title tsar is derived from the Latin title for the Roman emperors, ''caesar''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tsar|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}</ref> In comparison to the corresponding Latin word ''imperator'', the Byzantine Greek term ''[[basileus]]'' was used differently depending on whether it was in a contemporary political context or in a historical or Biblical context. In the history of the Greek language, ''basileus'' had originally meant something like \"potentate\".  It gradually approached the meaning of \"king\" in the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Period]], and it came to designate \"emperor\" after the inception in the [[Roman Empire]]. As a consequence, Byzantine sources continued to call the Biblical and ancient kings \"basileus\" even when that word had come to mean \"emperor\" when referring to contemporary monarchs, while it was never applied to Western European kings, whose title was transliterated from Latin ''rex'' as {{lang|grc|\u1fe5\u03ae\u03be}}, or to other monarchs, for whom designations such as {{lang|grc|\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd}} (\"leader\", \"chieftain\") were used.\n\nAs the Greek ''basileus'' was consistently rendered as \"tsar\" in Slavonic translations of Greek texts, the dual meaning was transferred into [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]]. Thus, \"tsar\" was not only used as an equivalent of Latin ''imperator'' (in reference to the rulers of the Byzantine Empire, the Holy Roman Empire and to native rulers) but was also used to refer to Biblical rulers and ancient kings.\n\nFrom this ambiguity, the development has moved in different directions in the different Slavic languages. Thus, the [[Bulgarian language]] and [[Russian language]] no longer use \"tsar\" as an equivalent of the term ''imperator'' as it exists in the West European (Latin) tradition. Currently, the term \"tsar\" refers to native sovereigns, ancient and Biblical rulers, as well as monarchs in fairy tales and the like. The title \"king\" (Russian ''korol' '', Bulgarian ''kral''-, the origin of which is Charlemagne (Karl)) is sometimes perceived as alien and is by some Russian speakers reserved for (West) European royalty (and, by extension, for those modern monarchs outside of Europe whose titles are translated as \"king\" in English, ''roi'' in French etc.). Foreign monarchs of imperial status, both inside and outside of Europe, ancient as well as modern, are generally called ''imperator'' (\u0438\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440) rather than tsar.\n\nIn contrast, the [[Serbocroatian language]] (which can also be viewed as different languages\u2014[[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]) translate \"emperor\" as \"tsar\" (''car'', \u0446\u0430\u0440) and not as ''imperator'', whereas the equivalent of \"king\" (''kralj'', \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0459, \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c) is used to designate monarchs of non-imperial status, Serbian as well as foreign  ancient rulers\u2014like Latin ''rex''. Biblical rulers in Serbian are called \u0446\u0430\u0440 and in Croatian ''kralj''.\n\nIn the modern [[West Slavic language]]s and [[Slovene language]], the use of the terms is nearly identical to the one in English and German: a king is designated with one term (Czech ''kr\u00e1l'', Slovak ''kr\u00e1\u013e'', Polish ''kr\u00f3l'', Slovene ''kralj''), an emperor is designated with another, derived from ''caesar'' as in German (Czech ''c\u00edsa\u0159'', Slovak ''cis\u00e1r'', Polish ''cesarz'', Slovene ''cesar''; Croatian ''cesar'' and Montenegrin ''\u0107esar'' fell into disuse after World War I), while the exotic term \"tsar\" (Czech, Slovene and Polish ''car'', Slovak ''c\u00e1r'') is reserved for the Bulgarian, Russian and Serbian rulers.\n\nIn the Polish language, by contrast, ''tsar'' is used as an equivalent to ''imperator'', never as ''king''. The term ''tsar'' is always used to refer to the Russian rulers before [[Peter the Great]], and very often to those succeeding.\n\n==Bulgaria==\n{{further|List of Bulgarian monarchs}}\n\n[[File:The inscription of Mostich.JPG|right|thumb|upright=0.9|Redrawing of the [[epitaph]] of ichirgu boila Mostich.

However, the title \"tsar\" (and its [[Byzantine Greek]] equivalent ''basileus'') was actually adopted and used for the first time by his son [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]], following a makeshift imperial coronation performed by the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] in 913.  After an attempt by the [[Byzantine Empire]] to revoke this major diplomatic concession and a decade of intensive warfare, the imperial title of the Bulgarian ruler was recognized by the Byzantine government in 924 and again at the formal conclusion of peace in 927.  Since in Byzantine political theory there was place for only two emperors, Eastern and Western (as in the Late [[Roman Empire]]), the Bulgarian ruler was crowned ''basileus'' as \"a spiritual son\" of the Byzantine ''basileus''.<ref>\u0421\u0440\u0452\u0430\u043d \u041f\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u045b.

Thus, in the later diplomatic correspondence conducted in 1199\u20131204 between the Bulgarian ruler [[Kaloyan]] and [[Pope Innocent III]], Kaloyan\u2014whose self-assumed Latin title was \"Imperator Bulgarorum et Blachorum\"\u2014claims that the imperial crowns of [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]], his son [[Peter I of Bulgaria|Peter I]], and [[Samuil of Bulgaria|Samuel]] were somehow derived from the [[papacy]]. The pope, however, only speaks of ''reges'' (kings) of Bulgaria in his replies, and eventually grants only that lesser title to Kaloyan, who nevertheless proceeds to thank the pope for the \"imperial title\" conferred upon him.<ref>''Innocentii pp. III epistolae ad Bulgariae historiam spectantes''. Recensuit et explicavit Iv. Dujcev. Sofia, 1942.</ref>\n\nThe title, later augmented with epithets and titles such as ''[[autokrator|autocrat]]'' to reflect current Byzantine practice, was used by all of Simeon's successors until the complete conquest of [[Bulgaria]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1422. In Latin sources the emperor of Bulgaria is sometimes designated \"emperor of Zagora\" (with variant spellings). Various additional epithets and descriptions apart, the official style read \"Emperor and Autocrat of all Bulgarians and Greeks\".\n\nDuring the five-century period of [[History of early Ottoman Bulgaria|Ottoman rule in Bulgaria]], the [[sultan]] was frequently referred to as \"tsar\". This may be related to the fact that he had claimed the legacy of the Byzantine Empire or to the fact that the sultan was called ''basileus'' in medieval Greek.\n\nAfter Bulgaria's liberation from the Ottomans in 1878, its new monarchs were at first ''autonomous prince'' ([[knyaz]]). With the declaration of full independence, [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria]] adopted the traditional title \"tsar\" in 1908 and it was used until the abolition of the monarchy in 1946.  However, these titles were not generally perceived as equivalents of \"emperor\" any longer. In the Bulgarian as in the Greek vernacular, the meaning of the title had shifted<ref>\u041d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0413\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432. 1895\u20131904. \u0420\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u043b\u044a\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u0438\u043a.

Accordingly, while Ferdinand and his successors, [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Boris III]] and [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Simeon II]], used the title of \"tsar\" in Bulgarian, they used the title of \"king\" outside Bulgaria. In the same fashion, the modern rulers of Greece (1821\u20131923, 1935\u20131973) used the traditional title of ''basileus'' in Greek and the title of \"king\" when in English speaking countries.\n\n==Kievan Rus'==\n\"Tsar\" was used once by church officials of [[Kievan Rus']] in the naming of [[Yaroslav the Wise]] of [[Kiev]]. This may be connected to Yaroslav's war against Byzantium and to his efforts to distance himself from [[Constantinople]].

In 1345, [[Stefan Du\u0161an]] began to style himself \"Emperor of Serbs and Greeks\" (the Greek renderings read \"''basileus'' and ''[[autokrator]]'' of Serbs and Romans\"), and was crowned as such in [[Skopje]] on [[Easter]] (April 16) 1346 by the newly elevated Serbian patriarch, alongside the Bulgarian patriarch and archbishop of Ohrid. On the same occasion, he had his wife [[Helena of Bulgaria]] crowned as empress and his son associated in power as king. When Du\u0161an died in 1355, his son [[Stefan Uro\u0161 V]] became the next emperor. The new emperor's uncle [[Simeon Uro\u0161]] (Sini\u0161a) contested the succession and claimed the same titles as a dynast in Thessaly. After his death around 1370, he was succeeded in his claims by his son [[John Uro\u0161]], who retired to a monastery in about 1373.\n\nWith the extinction of the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty in Serbia in 1371, the imperial title became obsolete (though it was retained by Stefan Uro\u0161 IV's widow Elena of Bulgaria until her death in 1376/1377). The royal title was preserved by [[Vuka\u0161in Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107]], a Serbian ruler in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], who had been associated by Stefan Uro\u0161. Several other Serbian rulers are known as tsars, although they were never recognized as such.

Maximilian's letter was of great importance to [[Ivan the Terrible]] and [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], when they wished to back up their titles of \"tsar\" and \"emperor\", respectively. Both monarchs demonstrated the letter to foreign ambassadors; Peter even referred to it when he proclaimed himself Emperor.</ref> However, the first Russian ruler to be formally crowned as Tsar of All Rus ({{lang-ru|\u0426\u0430\u0440\u044c \u0412\u0441\u0435\u044f \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0438}}) was [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]], until then known as Grand Prince of all the Russias. Some foreign ambassadors\u2014namely, Herberstein (in 1516 and 1525), Daniel Printz a Buchau (in 1576 and 1578) and Just Juel (in 1709)\u2014indicated that the word \"tsar\" should not be translated as \"emperor\", because it is applied by Russians to David, Solomon and other Biblical kings, who are simple ''reges''.<ref>This objection may be used against translating \"Basileus\" as \"emperor\", too. Based on these accounts, the Popes repeatedly suggested to confer on the Russian monarchs the title of ''rex'' (\"king\"), if they only ally themselves with Vatican. Such a proposal was made for the last time in 1550, i.e., three years after Ivan IV had crowned himself tsar. As early as 1489, Ivan III declined the papal offer, declaring that his regal authority does not require anyone's confirmation.</ref> On the other hand, [[Jacques Margeret]], a bodyguard of [[False Demetrius I]], argues that the title of \"tsar\" is more honorable for Muscovites than \"kaiser\" or \"king\" exactly because it was God and not some earthly potentate who ordained to apply it to David, Solomon, and other kings of Israel.<ref>\"Et ainsi retiennent le nom de Zar comme plus autentique, duquel nom il pleut iadis \u00e0 Dieu d'honorer David, Salomon et autres regnans sur la maison de Iuda et Israel, disent-ils, et que ces mots ''Tsisar'' et ''Krol'' n'est que invention humaine, lequel nom quelqu'un s'est acquis par beaux faits d'armes\".</ref> [[Samuel Collins (physician)|Samuel Collins]], a court physician to [[Tsar Alexis]] in 1659-66, styled the latter \"Great Emperour\", commenting that \"as for the word ''Czar'', it has so near relation to ''Cesar''... that it may well be granted to signifie Emperour.

Abbot Scarlati's opined that the term is not translatable and therefore may be used by the Pope without any harm. In order to settle the matter and to assert his imperial ambitions more clearly, [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I the Great]] issued an edict that raised Russia to an empire and decreed that the Latin title ''imperator'' should be used instead of tsar (1721).\n\nThe title tsar remained in common usage, and also officially as the designator of various titles signifying rule over various states absorbed by the Muscovite monarchy (such as the former Tatar khanates and the Georgian Orthodox kingdom).

In the history of the Greek language, ''basileus'' had originally meant something like \"potentate\".  It gradually approached the meaning of \"king\" in the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Period]], and it came to designate \"emperor\" after the inception in the [[Roman Empire]]. As a consequence, Byzantine sources continued to call the Biblical and ancient kings \"basileus\" even when that word had come to mean \"emperor\" when referring to contemporary monarchs, while it was never applied to Western European kings, whose title was transliterated from Latin ''rex'' as {{lang|grc|\u1fe5\u03ae\u03be}}, or to other monarchs, for whom designations such as {{lang|grc|\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd}} (\"leader\", \"chieftain\") were used.\n\nAs the Greek ''basileus'' was consistently rendered as \"tsar\" in Slavonic translations of Greek texts, the dual meaning was transferred into [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]]. Thus, \"tsar\" was not only used as an equivalent of Latin ''imperator'' (in reference to the rulers of the Byzantine Empire, the Holy Roman Empire and to native rulers) but was also used to refer to Biblical rulers and ancient kings.\n\nFrom this ambiguity, the development has moved in different directions in the different Slavic languages. Thus, the [[Bulgarian language]] and [[Russian language]] no longer use \"tsar\" as an equivalent of the term ''imperator'' as it exists in the West European (Latin) tradition. Currently, the term \"tsar\" refers to native sovereigns, ancient and Biblical rulers, as well as monarchs in fairy tales and the like. The title \"king\" (Russian ''korol' '', Bulgarian ''kral''-, the origin of which is Charlemagne (Karl)) is sometimes perceived as alien and is by some Russian speakers reserved for (West) European royalty (and, by extension, for those modern monarchs outside of Europe whose titles are translated as \"king\" in English, ''roi'' in French etc.). Foreign monarchs of imperial status, both inside and outside of Europe, ancient as well as modern, are generally called ''imperator'' (\u0438\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440) rather than tsar.\n\nIn contrast, the [[Serbocroatian language]] (which can also be viewed as different languages\u2014[[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]) translate \"emperor\" as \"tsar\" (''car'', \u0446\u0430\u0440) and not as ''imperator'', whereas the equivalent of \"king\" (''kralj'', \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0459, \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c) is used to designate monarchs of non-imperial status, Serbian as well as foreign  ancient rulers\u2014like Latin ''rex''. Biblical rulers in Serbian are called \u0446\u0430\u0440 and in Croatian ''kralj''.\n\nIn the modern [[West Slavic language]]s and [[Slovene language]], the use of the terms is nearly identical to the one in English and German: a king is designated with one term (Czech ''kr\u00e1l'', Slovak ''kr\u00e1\u013e'', Polish ''kr\u00f3l'', Slovene ''kralj''), an emperor is designated with another, derived from ''caesar'' as in German (Czech ''c\u00edsa\u0159'', Slovak ''cis\u00e1r'', Polish ''cesarz'', Slovene ''cesar''; Croatian ''cesar'' and Montenegrin ''\u0107esar'' fell into disuse after World War I), while the exotic term \"tsar\" (Czech, Slovene and Polish ''car'', Slovak ''c\u00e1r'') is reserved for the Bulgarian, Russian and Serbian rulers.\n\nIn the Polish language, by contrast, ''tsar'' is used as an equivalent to ''imperator'', never as ''king''. The term ''tsar'' is always used to refer to the Russian rulers before [[Peter the Great]], and very often to those succeeding.\n\n==Bulgaria==\n{{further|List of Bulgarian monarchs}}\n\n[[File:The inscription of Mostich.JPG|right|thumb|upright=0.9|Redrawing of the [[epitaph]] of ichirgu boila Mostich.

The sainted [[Boris I]] is sometimes retrospectively referred to as tsar, because at his time [[Christianization of Bulgaria|Bulgaria was converted to Christianity]].  However, the title \"tsar\" (and its [[Byzantine Greek]] equivalent ''basileus'') was actually adopted and used for the first time by his son [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]], following a makeshift imperial coronation performed by the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] in 913.  After an attempt by the [[Byzantine Empire]] to revoke this major diplomatic concession and a decade of intensive warfare, the imperial title of the Bulgarian ruler was recognized by the Byzantine government in 924 and again at the formal conclusion of peace in 927.  Since in Byzantine political theory there was place for only two emperors, Eastern and Western (as in the Late [[Roman Empire]]), the Bulgarian ruler was crowned ''basileus'' as \"a spiritual son\" of the Byzantine ''basileus''.<ref>\u0421\u0440\u0452\u0430\u043d \u041f\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u045b.

Thus, in the later diplomatic correspondence conducted in 1199\u20131204 between the Bulgarian ruler [[Kaloyan]] and [[Pope Innocent III]], Kaloyan\u2014whose self-assumed Latin title was \"Imperator Bulgarorum et Blachorum\"\u2014claims that the imperial crowns of [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]], his son [[Peter I of Bulgaria|Peter I]], and [[Samuil of Bulgaria|Samuel]] were somehow derived from the [[papacy]]. The pope, however, only speaks of ''reges'' (kings) of Bulgaria in his replies, and eventually grants only that lesser title to Kaloyan, who nevertheless proceeds to thank the pope for the \"imperial title\" conferred upon him.<ref>''Innocentii pp. III epistolae ad Bulgariae historiam spectantes''. Recensuit et explicavit Iv. Dujcev. Sofia, 1942.</ref>\n\nThe title, later augmented with epithets and titles such as ''[[autokrator|autocrat]]'' to reflect current Byzantine practice, was used by all of Simeon's successors until the complete conquest of [[Bulgaria]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1422. In Latin sources the emperor of Bulgaria is sometimes designated \"emperor of Zagora\" (with variant spellings). Various additional epithets and descriptions apart, the official style read \"Emperor and Autocrat of all Bulgarians and Greeks\".\n\nDuring the five-century period of [[History of early Ottoman Bulgaria|Ottoman rule in Bulgaria]], the [[sultan]] was frequently referred to as \"tsar\". This may be related to the fact that he had claimed the legacy of the Byzantine Empire or to the fact that the sultan was called ''basileus'' in medieval Greek.\n\nAfter Bulgaria's liberation from the Ottomans in 1878, its new monarchs were at first ''autonomous prince'' ([[knyaz]]). With the declaration of full independence, [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria]] adopted the traditional title \"tsar\" in 1908 and it was used until the abolition of the monarchy in 1946.  However, these titles were not generally perceived as equivalents of \"emperor\" any longer. In the Bulgarian as in the Greek vernacular, the meaning of the title had shifted<ref>\u041d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0413\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432. 1895\u20131904. \u0420\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u043b\u044a\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u0438\u043a.

Accordingly, while Ferdinand and his successors, [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Boris III]] and [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Simeon II]], used the title of \"tsar\" in Bulgarian, they used the title of \"king\" outside Bulgaria. In the same fashion, the modern rulers of Greece (1821\u20131923, 1935\u20131973) used the traditional title of ''basileus'' in Greek and the title of \"king\" when in English speaking countries.\n\n==Kievan Rus'==\n\"Tsar\" was used once by church officials of [[Kievan Rus']] in the naming of [[Yaroslav the Wise]] of [[Kiev]]. This may be connected to Yaroslav's war against Byzantium and to his efforts to distance himself from [[Constantinople]]. However, other princes of [[Kievan Rus']] never styled themselves as tsars.<ref>Wladimir Vodoff.

In 1345, [[Stefan Du\u0161an]] began to style himself \"Emperor of Serbs and Greeks\" (the Greek renderings read \"''basileus'' and ''[[autokrator]]'' of Serbs and Romans\"), and was crowned as such in [[Skopje]] on [[Easter]] (April 16) 1346 by the newly elevated Serbian patriarch, alongside the Bulgarian patriarch and archbishop of Ohrid. On the same occasion, he had his wife [[Helena of Bulgaria]] crowned as empress and his son associated in power as king. When Du\u0161an died in 1355, his son [[Stefan Uro\u0161 V]] became the next emperor. The new emperor's uncle [[Simeon Uro\u0161]] (Sini\u0161a) contested the succession and claimed the same titles as a dynast in Thessaly. After his death around 1370, he was succeeded in his claims by his son [[John Uro\u0161]], who retired to a monastery in about 1373.\n\nWith the extinction of the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty in Serbia in 1371, the imperial title became obsolete (though it was retained by Stefan Uro\u0161 IV's widow Elena of Bulgaria until her death in 1376/1377). The royal title was preserved by [[Vuka\u0161in Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107]], a Serbian ruler in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], who had been associated by Stefan Uro\u0161. Several other Serbian rulers are known as tsars, although they were never recognized as such.

[[Sigismund von Herberstein]] observed that the titles of \"kaiser\" and \"imperator\" were attempts to render the Russian term \"tsar\" into German and Latin, respectively.<ref>\"Den Titel aines Khaisers, wiewol Er alle seine Brief nur Reissisch schreibt, darinn Er sich Czar nent, so schickht Er gemaincklich Lateinische Copeyen darmit oder darinn, und an stat des Czar setzen sy Imperator, den wir Teutsch Khaiser nennen\".</ref> [[File:Tsar Nicholas II -1898.jpg|thumb| [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], the last [[Emperor of All Russia|Emperor of Russia]].]]\n\nThis was related to Russia's growing ambitions to become an Orthodox \"[[Third Rome]]\", after the [[Fall of Constantinople]].

Maximilian's letter was of great importance to [[Ivan the Terrible]] and [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], when they wished to back up their titles of \"tsar\" and \"emperor\", respectively. Both monarchs demonstrated the letter to foreign ambassadors; Peter even referred to it when he proclaimed himself Emperor.</ref> However, the first Russian ruler to be formally crowned as Tsar of All Rus ({{lang-ru|\u0426\u0430\u0440\u044c \u0412\u0441\u0435\u044f \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0438}}) was [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]], until then known as Grand Prince of all the Russias. Some foreign ambassadors\u2014namely, Herberstein (in 1516 and 1525), Daniel Printz a Buchau (in 1576 and 1578) and Just Juel (in 1709)\u2014indicated that the word \"tsar\" should not be translated as \"emperor\", because it is applied by Russians to David, Solomon and other Biblical kings, who are simple ''reges''.<ref>This objection may be used against translating \"Basileus\" as \"emperor\", too. Based on these accounts, the Popes repeatedly suggested to confer on the Russian monarchs the title of ''rex'' (\"king\"), if they only ally themselves with Vatican. Such a proposal was made for the last time in 1550, i.e., three years after Ivan IV had crowned himself tsar. As early as 1489, Ivan III declined the papal offer, declaring that his regal authority does not require anyone's confirmation.</ref> On the other hand, [[Jacques Margeret]], a bodyguard of [[False Demetrius I]], argues that the title of \"tsar\" is more honorable for Muscovites than \"kaiser\" or \"king\" exactly because it was God and not some earthly potentate who ordained to apply it to David, Solomon, and other kings of Israel.<ref>\"Et ainsi retiennent le nom de Zar comme plus autentique, duquel nom il pleut iadis \u00e0 Dieu d'honorer David, Salomon et autres regnans sur la maison de Iuda et Israel, disent-ils, et que ces mots ''Tsisar'' et ''Krol'' n'est que invention humaine, lequel nom quelqu'un s'est acquis par beaux faits d'armes\".</ref> [[Samuel Collins (physician)|Samuel Collins]], a court physician to [[Tsar Alexis]] in 1659-66, styled the latter \"Great Emperour\", commenting that \"as for the word ''Czar'', it has so near relation to ''Cesar''... that it may well be granted to signifie Emperour.

His election, which never resulted in his assumption of the Muscovite throne, was part of an unsuccessful plan by Sigismund to conquer all of Russia and convert the population to Catholicism.

Abbot Scarlati's opined that the term is not translatable and therefore may be used by the Pope without any harm. In order to settle the matter and to assert his imperial ambitions more clearly, [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I the Great]] issued an edict that raised Russia to an empire and decreed that the Latin title ''imperator'' should be used instead of tsar (1721).\n\nThe title tsar remained in common usage, and also officially as the designator of various titles signifying rule over various states absorbed by the Muscovite monarchy (such as the former Tatar khanates and the Georgian Orthodox kingdom).
