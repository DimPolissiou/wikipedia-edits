As York was a town in [[Roman Empire|Roman times]], its [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] name is recorded in Roman sources (as ''Eboracum'' and ''Eburacum''); after 400, [[Angles]] took over the area and adapted the name by [[folk etymology]] to [[Old English language|Old English]] ''Eoforw\u012bc'' or ''Eofor\u012bc'', which means \"wild-boar town\" or \"rich in wild-boar\". The [[Vikings]], who took over the area later, in turn adapted the name by folk etymology to [[Old Norse language|Norse]] ''[[J\u00f3rv\u00edk]]'' meaning \"horse bay.\" The modern Welsh name is Efrog.\n\nAfter the [[Angles|Anglian]] settlement of the North of England, Anglian York was first capital of [[Deira (kingdom)|Deira]] and later [[Northumbria]], and by the early 7th&nbsp;century, York was an important royal centre for the [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]]n kings. Following the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066 York was substantially damaged, but in time became an important urban centre as the administrative centre of the county of [[Yorkshire]]. York prospered during much of the later [[Middle Ages|medieval]] era; the later years of the 14th and the earlier years of the 15th&nbsp;centuries were characterised by particular prosperity. During the [[English Civil War]], the city was regarded as a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] stronghold and was [[Siege of York|besieged]] and eventually captured by Parliamentary forces under [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Lord Fairfax]] in 1644. After the war, York retained its pre-eminence in the North, and, by 1660, was the third-largest city in England after London and [[Norwich]].\n\nModern York has 34 [[Conservation Area]]s, 2,084 [[Listed building]]s and 22 [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]]s in its care. Every year, thousands of tourists come to see the surviving [[medieval architecture|medieval buildings]], interspersed with Roman and Viking remains and [[Georgian architecture]].\n\n==Prehistoric settlement==\nArchaeological evidence suggests that [[mesolithic]] people settled in the region of York between 8000 and 7000&nbsp;BC, although it is not known if these were permanent or temporary settlements. During the [[neolithic period]] polished stone axes indicate the presence of people in the area where the City of York is now, especially on the south-west bank of the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]], just outside the city centre near the area where Scarborough bridge is now. Evidence for people continues into the [[Bronze Age]] with a hoard of [[flint tool]]s and weapons found by Holgate Beck between the railway and the River Ouse, burials and [[Bronze|bronzes]] found on both sides of the River Ouse and a [[Beaker culture|beaker]] vessel found in [[Bootham]]. [[Iron Age]] burials have been found near the area on the south-west bank of the Ouse where the concentration of Neolithic axes was found. Few other finds from this period have been found in York itself, but evidence of a late Iron Age farmstead has been uncovered at Lingcroft Farm {{convert|3|mi|km|1}} away at [[Naburn]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Hall | first = Richard | title = English Heritage: Book of York | edition = 1st | year = 1996 | publisher = B.T.Batsford Ltd | pages = 26\u201327 | isbn = 0-7134-7720-2}}</ref>\n\n== Roman ==\n{{main|Eboracum}}\n[[File:Roman Fortifications in Museum Gardens York.jpg|thumb|right|Roman wall and the west corner tower of the fort at York, with medieval additions]]\n\nThe Romans called the tribes in the region around York the [[Brigantes]] and the [[Parisii (Yorkshire)|Parisii]]. York may have been on the border between these two tribes. During the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] the Brigantes became a Roman client state, but, when their leadership changed becoming more hostile to Rome, Roman General [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]] led the [[Legio VIIII Hispana|Ninth Legion]] north of the [[Humber]].<ref name=Willis35>{{cite book | last = Willis | first = Ronald | year = 1988 | title = The illustrated portrait of York | edition = 4th | publisher = Robert Hale Limited | isbn = 0-7090-3468-7 | pages = 16\u201317}}</ref>\n\nYork was founded in 71&nbsp;AD when Cerialis and the Ninth Legion constructed a military fortress ([[castra]]) on flat ground above the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] near its junction with the [[River Foss]]. The fortress was later rebuilt in stone, covered an area of 50 acres, and was inhabited by 6,000 soldiers. The earliest known mention of Eburacum by name is from a wooden [[stylus]] tablet from the Roman fortress of [[Vindolanda]] along [[Hadrian's Wall]], dated to c. 95\u2013104&nbsp;AD, where it is called ''Eburaci''.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Hall\n | first = Richard\n | title = English Heritage: Book of York\n | origyear = 1996\n | edition = 1st \n | year = 1996\n | publisher = B.T.Batsford Ltd\n |page=13\n | isbn = 0-7134-7720-2\n}}</ref> Much of the Roman fortress lies under the foundations of [[York Minster]], and excavations in the Minster's undercroft have revealed some of the original walls.<ref name=coyyh>{{cite web | title = York's history | publisher = City of York Council | url = http://www.york.gov.uk/leisure/Local_history_and_heritage/yorks_history/ | date = 20 December 2006 | accessdate = 1 October 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071031235552/http://www.york.gov.uk/leisure/Local_history_and_heritage/yorks_history/ | archivedate = 31 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=ytss-2>{{cite book | last = Shannon | first = John | last2 = Tilbrook | first2 = Richard | title = York \u2013 the second city | publisher = Jarrold Publishing | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-7117-0507-0 | page = 2}}</ref>\n\nAt some time between 109&nbsp;AD and 122&nbsp;AD the garrison of the Ninth Legion was replaced by the [[Legio VI Victrix|Sixth Legion]]. There is no documented trace of the Ninth Legion after 117&nbsp;AD, and various theories have been proposed as to what happened to it. The Sixth Legion remained in York until the end of Roman occupation about 400&nbsp;AD.<ref name=\"ytss-2\"/> The Emperors [[Hadrian]], [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Constantius I]] all held court in York during their various campaigns. During his stay, the Emperor Severus proclaimed York capital of the province of [[Britannia Inferior]], and it is likely that it was he who granted York the privileges of a [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]] or city. Constantius I died during his stay in York, and his son [[Constantine I|Constantine the Great]] was proclaimed Emperor by the troops based in the fortress.<ref name=ytss-2/>\n\nEconomically the military presence was important with workshops growing up to supply the needs of the 5,000 troops [[garrison]]ed there and in its early stages York operated a [[command economy]]. Production included military pottery until the mid-third century; military tile kilns have been found in the Aldwark-Peasholme Green area, glassworking at Coppergate, metalworks and leatherworks producing military equipment in Tanner Row. New trading opportunities led local people to create a permanent civilian settlement on the south-west bank of the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] opposite the fortress. By 237 it had been made a [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]] one of only four in Britain and the others were founded for retired soldiers.<ref>Hall, ''English Heritage: Book of York'', p.&nbsp;31</ref>  York was self-governing, with a council made up of rich locals, including merchants, and veteran soldiers.<ref>{{cite book | last=Hartley | first=Elizabeth | title=Roman Life at the Yorkshire Museum | publisher=The Yorkshire Museum | year=1985 | page=12 | isbn=0-905807-02-2}}</ref>\n\nEvidence of [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religious]] beliefs in York have been found including [[altar]]s to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Hercules]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Fortuna|Fortune]], while [[phallic]] [[amulets]] are the most commonly found type of good luck charm. In terms of number of reference the most popular [[deities]] were the spiritual representation ([[Genius (mythology)|''genius'']]) of York and the [[Mother Goddess]]; there is also evidence of local or regional deities. There was also a Christian community in York although it is not known when it was first formed and there is virtually no archaeological record of it.

[[Christopher Allen Snyder]] makes note of the evidence for Eboracum continuing to function, perhaps as a military outpost or the seat of a minor kingdom based on the old territory of the Brigantes. Scholar Peter Field suggests that the City of Legions (''urbs legionum'') mentioned by [[Gildas]] in his 6th-century ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'' is a reference to York, rather than [[Caerleon]]; if this were the case it could provide some contemporary information about Ebrauc. Additionally, a [[Peredur son of Efrawg]] is the hero of a 12th- or 13th-century Welsh romance; the name \"Efrawg\" or \"Efrog\" is derived from the name ''Ebrauc'', suggesting the city had royal associations in later tradition. However, Snyder cites historian and archaeologist [[Nick Higham (historian)|Nick Higham]] in saying that the settlement had declined so much by the end of the Roman period that it was unlikely to have been a significant post-Roman regional centre.<ref name=Snyder/>\n\n===Anglo-Saxon ''Eoforwic''===\n[[File:Anglian Tower York.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Anglian Tower]]\n\n[[Angles]] settled in the area in the early 5th&nbsp;century.<ref>{{cite book\n|last1=Jones\n|first1=Barri\n|last2=Mattingly\n|first2=David\n|year=1990\n|title=An Atlas of Roman Britain\n|publisher=Blackwell Publishers\n|publication-date=2007\n|publication-place=Cambridge\n|page=317\n|isbn=978-1-84217-067-0\n}}</ref> Cemeteries that are identifiably Anglian date from this period.

It was an important trading centre. Several religious houses were founded following the Conquest, including [[St Mary's Abbey, York|St Mary's Abbey]] and Holy Trinity Priory.

It is in this period that the [[York Mystery Plays]], a regular cycle of religious pageants (or plays) associated with the [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] cycle and performed by the various craft [[guild]]s grew up. Among the more important personages associated with this period was [[Nicholas Blackburn]] senior, Lord Mayor in 1412 and a leading merchant. He is depicted with his wife Margaret Blackburn in glass in the (now) east window of [[Medieval churches of York#All Saints, North Street|All Saints' Church]] in North Street. There seems to have been economic contraction and a dwindling in York's regional importance in the period from the later 15th&nbsp;century. The construction of the city's new [[Guildhall, York|Guildhall]] around the middle of the century can be seen as an attempt to project civic confidence in the face of growing uncertainty. [[Brandsby-type ware]] and [[Humber ware]] ceramics were popular in the city at this time.<ref name=\"SelectedPottery\">Holdsworth, J. 1978.

After the war, York slowly regained its former pre-eminence in the North, and, by 1660, was the third-largest city in England after London and [[Norwich]].\n\nIn 1686 the [[Bar Convent]] was founded, in secret due to [[anti-catholic]] Laws, making it the oldest surviving convent in England.\n\nYork elected two members to the [[Unreformed House of Commons]].\n\nThe [[Judges Lodgings, York|Judges Lodgings]] is a Grade I [[Listed building|listed townhouse]] that was built between 1711 and 1726 and later used to house judges when they attended the quarterly sessions of the [[Assizes]] at [[York Castle]].\n\nOn 22 March 1739 the [[highwayman]] [[Dick Turpin]] was convicted at the York Grand Jury House of horse-stealing, and was [[hanging|hanged]] at the Knavesmire on 7 April 1739.

As York was a town in [[Roman Empire|Roman times]], its [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] name is recorded in Roman sources (as ''Eboracum'' and ''Eburacum''); after 400, [[Angles]] took over the area and adapted the name by [[folk etymology]] to [[Old English language|Old English]] ''Eoforw\u012bc'' or ''Eofor\u012bc'', which means \"wild-boar town\" or \"rich in wild-boar\". The [[Vikings]], who took over the area later, in turn adapted the name by folk etymology to [[Old Norse language|Norse]] ''[[J\u00f3rv\u00edk]]'' meaning \"horse bay.\" The modern Welsh name is Efrog.\n\nAfter the [[Angles|Anglian]] settlement of the North of England, Anglian York was first capital of [[Deira (kingdom)|Deira]] and later [[Northumbria]], and by the early 7th&nbsp;century, York was an important royal centre for the [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]]n kings. Following the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066 York was substantially damaged, but in time became an important urban centre as the administrative centre of the county of [[Yorkshire]]. York prospered during much of the later [[Middle Ages|medieval]] era; the later years of the 14th and the earlier years of the 15th&nbsp;centuries were characterised by particular prosperity. During the [[English Civil War]], the city was regarded as a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] stronghold and was [[Siege of York|besieged]] and eventually captured by Parliamentary forces under [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Lord Fairfax]] in 1644. After the war, York retained its pre-eminence in the North, and, by 1660, was the third-largest city in England after London and [[Norwich]].\n\nModern York has 34 [[Conservation Area]]s, 2,084 [[Listed building]]s and 22 [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]]s in its care. Every year, thousands of tourists come to see the surviving [[medieval architecture|medieval buildings]], interspersed with Roman and Viking remains and [[Georgian architecture]].\n\n==Prehistoric settlement==\nArchaeological evidence suggests that [[mesolithic]] people settled in the region of York between 8000 and 7000&nbsp;BC, although it is not known if these were permanent or temporary settlements. During the [[neolithic period]] polished stone axes indicate the presence of people in the area where the City of York is now, especially on the south-west bank of the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]], just outside the city centre near the area where Scarborough bridge is now. Evidence for people continues into the [[Bronze Age]] with a hoard of [[flint tool]]s and weapons found by Holgate Beck between the railway and the River Ouse, burials and [[Bronze|bronzes]] found on both sides of the River Ouse and a [[Beaker culture|beaker]] vessel found in [[Bootham]]. [[Iron Age]] burials have been found near the area on the south-west bank of the Ouse where the concentration of Neolithic axes was found. Few other finds from this period have been found in York itself, but evidence of a late Iron Age farmstead has been uncovered at Lingcroft Farm {{convert|3|mi|km|1}} away at [[Naburn]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Hall | first = Richard | title = English Heritage: Book of York | edition = 1st | year = 1996 | publisher = B.T.Batsford Ltd | pages = 26\u201327 | isbn = 0-7134-7720-2}}</ref>\n\n== Roman ==\n{{main|Eboracum}}\n[[File:Roman Fortifications in Museum Gardens York.jpg|thumb|right|Roman wall and the west corner tower of the fort at York, with medieval additions]]\n\nThe Romans called the tribes in the region around York the [[Brigantes]] and the [[Parisii (Yorkshire)|Parisii]]. York may have been on the border between these two tribes.

The Sixth Legion remained in York until the end of Roman occupation about 400&nbsp;AD.<ref name=\"ytss-2\"/> The Emperors [[Hadrian]], [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Constantius I]] all held court in York during their various campaigns. During his stay, the Emperor Severus proclaimed York capital of the province of [[Britannia Inferior]], and it is likely that it was he who granted York the privileges of a [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]] or city. Constantius I died during his stay in York, and his son [[Constantine I|Constantine the Great]] was proclaimed Emperor by the troops based in the fortress.<ref name=ytss-2/>\n\nEconomically the military presence was important with workshops growing up to supply the needs of the 5,000 troops [[garrison]]ed there and in its early stages York operated a [[command economy]]. Production included military pottery until the mid-third century; military tile kilns have been found in the Aldwark-Peasholme Green area, glassworking at Coppergate, metalworks and leatherworks producing military equipment in Tanner Row. New trading opportunities led local people to create a permanent civilian settlement on the south-west bank of the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] opposite the fortress. By 237 it had been made a [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]] one of only four in Britain and the others were founded for retired soldiers.<ref>Hall, ''English Heritage: Book of York'', p.&nbsp;31</ref>  York was self-governing, with a council made up of rich locals, including merchants, and veteran soldiers.<ref>{{cite book | last=Hartley | first=Elizabeth | title=Roman Life at the Yorkshire Museum | publisher=The Yorkshire Museum | year=1985 | page=12 | isbn=0-905807-02-2}}</ref>\n\nEvidence of [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religious]] beliefs in York have been found including [[altar]]s to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Hercules]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Fortuna|Fortune]], while [[phallic]] [[amulets]] are the most commonly found type of good luck charm. In terms of number of reference the most popular [[deities]] were the spiritual representation ([[Genius (mythology)|''genius'']]) of York and the [[Mother Goddess]]; there is also evidence of local or regional deities. There was also a Christian community in York although it is not known when it was first formed and there is virtually no archaeological record of it.

[[Christopher Allen Snyder]] makes note of the evidence for Eboracum continuing to function, perhaps as a military outpost or the seat of a minor kingdom based on the old territory of the Brigantes. Scholar Peter Field suggests that the City of Legions (''urbs legionum'') mentioned by [[Gildas]] in his 6th-century ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'' is a reference to York, rather than [[Caerleon]]; if this were the case it could provide some contemporary information about Ebrauc. Additionally, a [[Peredur son of Efrawg]] is the hero of a 12th- or 13th-century Welsh romance; the name \"Efrawg\" or \"Efrog\" is derived from the name ''Ebrauc'', suggesting the city had royal associations in later tradition.

In time York became an important urban centre as the administrative centre of the county of [[Yorkshire]], as the seat of an [[archbishop]], and at times in the later 13th and 14th&nbsp;centuries as an alternative seat of royal government. It was an important trading centre. Several religious houses were founded following the Conquest, including [[St Mary's Abbey, York|St Mary's Abbey]] and Holy Trinity Priory. The city as a possession of the crown also came to house a substantial Jewish community under the protection of the [[sheriff]].\n\nOn 16 March 1190 a [[Pogrom|mob]] of townsfolk forced the [[Jew]]s in York to flee into [[York Castle|the castle keep]] (later replaced by Clifford's Tower), which was under the control of the sheriff. The castle was set on fire and the Jews were massacred. It is likely that various local magnates who were debtors of the Jews helped instigate this massacre or, at least, did nothing to prevent it. It came during a time of widespread [[12th century English pogroms|attacks against Jews in Britain]]. The Jewish community in York did recover after the massacre and a Jewish presence remained in York until [[Edict of Expulsion|the expulsion]] of Jews from England in 1290.<ref>Hall, ''English Heritage: Book of York'', pp.&nbsp;58\u201359</ref>\n\nYork prospered during much of the later [[Middle Ages|medieval]] era and this is reflected in the built environment. Twenty [[Medieval churches of York|medieval parish churches]] survive in whole or in part, though only eight of these are regularly used for worship. The medieval [[York city walls|city walls]], with their entrance gates, known as ''bars'', encompassed virtually the entire city and survive to this day. The city was also designated as a [[county corporate]], giving it effective county status.\n\n[[File:York Shambles.jpg|thumb|left|upright|\"[[The Shambles (York)|The Shambles]],\" a medieval street in York.]]\nThe later years of the 14th and the earlier years of the 15th&nbsp;centuries were characterised by particular prosperity. It is in this period that the [[York Mystery Plays]], a regular cycle of religious pageants (or plays) associated with the [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] cycle and performed by the various craft [[guild]]s grew up. Among the more important personages associated with this period was [[Nicholas Blackburn]] senior, Lord Mayor in 1412 and a leading merchant. He is depicted with his wife Margaret Blackburn in glass in the (now) east window of [[Medieval churches of York#All Saints, North Street|All Saints' Church]] in North Street. There seems to have been economic contraction and a dwindling in York's regional importance in the period from the later 15th&nbsp;century. The construction of the city's new [[Guildhall, York|Guildhall]] around the middle of the century can be seen as an attempt to project civic confidence in the face of growing uncertainty. [[Brandsby-type ware]] and [[Humber ware]] ceramics were popular in the city at this time.<ref name=\"SelectedPottery\">Holdsworth, J. 1978.

Some retain the outdoor shelves and the hooks on which meat was displayed. They have overhanging upper floors and are now largely [[souvenir]] shops.\n\n== Early modern ==\nFew buildings of significance were put up in the century after the completion of the [[York Minster|Minster]] in 1472, the exceptions being the completion of the [[King's Manor]] (which from 1537 to 1641 housed the [[Council of the North]]) and the rebuilding of the church of [[St. Michael le Belfrey]], where [[Guy Fawkes]] was baptised in 1570.\n\nDuring the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] all the [[Christian monasticism|monastic]] institutions in the City were closed including St. Leonards Hospital and in 1539 [[St. Mary's Abbey, York|St. Mary's Abbey]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Wilson | first=Christoper | last2=Burton | first2 = Janet | title=St Mary's Abbey York | publisher=The Yorkshire Museum | year=1988 | page=4 | isbn=0-905807-03-0}}</ref> In 1547, fifteen parish churches were closed, reducing their number from forty to twenty-five, a reflection of the decline in the city's population. Despite the [[English Reformation]] making the practice of [[Roman Catholicism]] illegal, a Catholic Christian community remained in York although this was mainly in secret. Its members included [[Margaret Clitherow|St. Margaret Clitherow]] who was executed in 1586 for harbouring a priest<ref>{{cite book | last=Whitworth | first=Alan | title=Aspects of York:Discovering local history | publisher=Warncliffe Books | year=2000 | pages=77\u201385 |isbn=1-871647-83-5}}</ref> and [[Guy Fawkes]] who tried to blow up the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in 1605.\n\nFollowing his break with [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] established his [[Court of St. James's|Court]] in York in 1642 for six months. Subsequently, during the [[English Civil War]], the city was regarded as a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] stronghold and was [[Siege of York|besieged]] and eventually captured by Parliamentary forces under [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Lord Fairfax]] in 1644. After the war, York slowly regained its former pre-eminence in the North, and, by 1660, was the third-largest city in England after London and [[Norwich]].\n\nIn 1686 the [[Bar Convent]] was founded, in secret due to [[anti-catholic]] Laws, making it the oldest surviving convent in England.\n\nYork elected two members to the [[Unreformed House of Commons]].\n\nThe [[Judges Lodgings, York|Judges Lodgings]] is a Grade I [[Listed building|listed townhouse]] that was built between 1711 and 1726 and later used to house judges when they attended the quarterly sessions of the [[Assizes]] at [[York Castle]].\n\nOn 22 March 1739 the [[highwayman]] [[Dick Turpin]] was convicted at the York Grand Jury House of horse-stealing, and was [[hanging|hanged]] at the Knavesmire on 7 April 1739.
