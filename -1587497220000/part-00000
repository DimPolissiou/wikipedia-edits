Up\u0101li was born a low-caste barber. He met the Buddha when still a child, and later, when the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes received [[pabbajja|ordination]], he did so as well. He was ordained before the princes, putting humility before caste. Having been ordained, Up\u0101li learnt both Buddhist doctrine ({{lang-pi|Dhamma|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|Dharma|italic=yes}}) and ''vinaya''. His [[Upadhyay#In_Buddhism|preceptor]] was Kappitaka. Up\u0101li became known for his mastery and strictness of ''vinaya'' and was consulted often about ''vinaya'' matters. A notable case he decided was that of the monk Ajjuka, who was accused of partisanship in a conflict about real estate. During the First Council, Up\u0101li received the important role of reciting the ''vinaya'', for which he is mostly known.\n\nScholars have analyzed Up\u0101li's role and that of other disciples in the early texts, and it has been suggested that his role in the texts was emphasized during a period of compiling that stressed monastic discipline, during which [[Mahakassapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}}) and Up\u0101li became the most important disciples. Later, Up\u0101li and his pupils became known as ''vinayadharas'' ([[P\u0101li]]; 'custodians of the vinaya'), who preserved the monastic discipline after the Buddha's ''[[parinirvana|parinibb\u0101na]]'' ({{lang-sa|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a|italic=yes}}; passing into final Nirvana). This lineage became an important part of the identity of [[Ceylon]]ese and Burmese Buddhism. In China, the 7th-century Vinaya school referred to Up\u0101li as their patriarch, and it was believed that one of their founders was a reincarnation of him. The technical conversations about ''vinaya'' between the Buddha and Up\u0101li were recorded in the P\u0101li and [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] traditions and have been suggested as an important subject of study for modern-day ethics in [[American Buddhism]].\n\n== Accounts ==\nUp\u0101li's personality is not depicted extensively in the texts, as the texts mostly emphasize his stereotypical qualities as an expert in monastic discipline, especially so in the [[P\u0101li]] texts.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=67, 231}}\n\n=== Early life ===\nAccording to the texts, Up\u0101li was a barber, a despised profession in ancient India.{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1899 |p=102}}{{sfn |Gombrich |1995 |p=357}} He was from an [[Vaishya|artisan caste]] family in service to the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes in [[Kapilavatthu]] ({{lang-sa|\u015aakya; Kapilavastu}}) and, according to the ''[[Mah\u0101vastu]]'', to the Buddha. Up\u0101li's mother had once introduced Up\u0101li to the Buddha.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'', [[Dharmaguptaka]] and Chinese texts relate that as a child, Up\u0101li shaved the hair of the Buddha. Unlike adults, he had no fear of approaching the Buddha. Once, as he was guided by the Buddha during the shaving, he attained [[jhana|advanced states of meditation]]. Buddhologist [[Andr\u00e9 Bareau]] argues that this story is ancient, because it precedes the tradition of art depictions of the Buddha with curly hair, and the glorification of Up\u0101li as an adult.{{sfn |Bareau |1962 |p=262}}\n\nAccording to the Mah\u0101vastu, the P\u0101li [[Cullavagga]] and the texts of discipline of the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] order, when the princes left home to become monks, Up\u0101li followed them. Since the princes handed Up\u0101li all their possessions, including jewelry, he figured that returning to Kapilavatthu with these possessions might cause him to be accused of having killed the princes for theft. Up\u0101li therefore decided to become ordained with them. They were ordained by the Buddha at the [[Malla (India)|Anupiy\u0101 grove]].{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}. For the texts of traditions apart from P\u0101li, see {{harvtxt |Freedman |1977 |p=97}}.}} Several variations on the story of Up\u0101li's ordination exist, but all of them emphasize that his status in the ''sa\u1e45gha'' ({{lang-sa|sa\u1e43gha|italic=yes}}; monastic community) was independent of his caste origin. In the P\u0101li version, the princes, including [[Anuruddha]] ({{lang-sa|Aniruddha}}), voluntarily allowed Up\u0101li to ordain before them in order to give him seniority in order of ordination and abandon their own attachment to caste and social status.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}[[File:Kapilavastu.jpg|thumb|Remains at [[Tilaurakot]], one of the two sites that may have been Kapilavatthu |alt=Ruins of walled buildings]] In the Tibetan M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, co-disciple [[Sariputra|S\u0101riputta]] ({{lang-sa|\u015a\u0101riputra}}) persuaded Up\u0101li to become ordained when he hesitated because of being low caste, but in the ''Mah\u0101vastu'', it was Up\u0101li's own initiative.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'' continues that after all the monks had been ordained, the Buddha requested that the former princes bow for their former barber, which led to consternation among the witnessing king [[Bimbisara|Bimbis\u0101ra]] and advisers, who also bowed for Up\u0101li following their example.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}} It became widely known that the Sakyans had their barber ordained before them to humble their pride,{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=116}} as the Buddha related a ''[[Jataka|J\u0101taka]]'' tale that the king and advisers had bowed for Up\u0101li in a previous life, too.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}}{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=10}}\n\nIndologist [[T.W. Rhys Davids]] noted that Up\u0101li was the \"striking proof of the reality of the effect produced by Gautama's disregard of the supposed importance of caste\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1903 |p=69}} Historian {{ill|H.W. Schumann|de}} also raises Up\u0101li as an example of the general rule that \"in no case did ... humble origins prevent a monk from becoming prominent in the [[sangha|Order]]\".{{sfn |Schumann |2004 |p=166}} Religion scholar Jeffrey Samuels points out, though, that the majority of Buddhist monks and [[bhikkhuni|nuns]], as drawn from several analyses of Buddhist texts, were from higher castes, with a minority of six percent like Up\u0101li being exception to the rule.{{sfn |Samuels |2007 |p=123}} Historian Sangh Sen Singh argues that Up\u0101li could have been the leader of the ''sa\u1e45gha'' after the Buddha's ''[[parinibb\u0101na]]'' instead of [[Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a|italic=yes}}, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa). But the fact that he was from a low caste effectively prevented this, as many of the Buddhist devotees at the time might have objected to his leadership position.{{sfn |Singh |1973 |pp=131\u2013132}}\n\n=== Monastic life ===\nUp\u0101li had a dwelling place in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Ves\u0101li]] ({{lang-sa|Vai\u015b\u0101li}}), called V\u0101lik\u0101r\u0101ma.<!--Calikarama-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li; V\u0101lik\u0101r\u0101ma}}{{sfn |Geiger |1912 |p=35}} He once asked the Buddha for leave to withdraw in the forest and lead a life in solitude. The Buddha refused, however, and told him that such a life was not for everyone.<!--Upali Sutta--> P\u0101li scholar [[Gunapala Piyasena Malalasekera|Gunapala Malalasekera]] argued that the Buddha wanted Up\u0101li to learn both meditation and Buddhist doctrine, and a life in the forest would have provided him with only the former. The texts state that the Buddha himself taught the ''[[vinaya]]'' (monastic discipline) to Up\u0101li.<!--Upali-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li; Up\u0101li Sutta (3)}} Up\u0101li later attained the state of an [[arhat|enlightened disciple]].{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}\n\nAccording to the Mah\u0101vastu, the [[Upadhyay#In Buddhism|preceptor]] who completed the process of Up\u0101li's [[upasampada|acceptance]] in the ''sa\u1e45gha'' was a monk called Kappitaka.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=58}}{{refn |group=note |Philosopher Michael Freedman argues that the office of preceptor may have only been developed after the Buddha's ''parinibb\u0101na'', although he admits the texts contradict each other with regard to Up\u0101li's acceptance.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=57 n.60, 97\u201398}}}} There is one story told about Up\u0101li and his preceptor. Kappitaka was in the habit of living in cemeteries. In one cemetery near Ves\u0101li he had a [[monastic cell]]. One day, a couple of nuns built a small monument there in honor of their teacher, also a nun, and made much noise in the process. Disturbed by the nuns, Kappitaka destroyed the monument, which greatly angered the nuns. Later, in an attempt to kill Kappitaka, they destroyed his cell in return. But Kappitaka was warned by Up\u0101li in advance and he had already fled elsewhere.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Kappitaka Thera}} The next day, Up\u0101li was verbally abused by the nuns for having informed his teacher.{{sfn |Dhammadinna |2016 |pp=45\u201346}}\n\n=== Role in monastic discipline ===\n[[File:Upali (Ubari), from the series \u201cTwo Bodhisattva and Ten Great Disciples of Sakyamuni\u201d.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Up\u0101li, woodblock print by [[Munakata Shik\u014d]], originally from 1939|left|alt=Monk in black robes looking at the sky with hands held up]]\n\nIn the literature of every Buddhist school, Up\u0101li is depicted as an expert in ''vinaya'' and the ''[[p\u0101\u1e6dimokkha]]'' ({{lang-sa|pratimok\u1e63a|italic=yes}}; monastic code),{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} for which the Buddha declared him [[\u015ar\u0101vaka#Foremost disciples|foremost]] among those who remember the vinaya ({{lang-pi|Vinaya-p\u0101mokkha|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|Vinayapramukkha|italic=yes}}).{{sfn |Sarao |2004 |p=878}}{{sfn |Robinson |Johnson |1997 |p=45}} He was therefore dubbed the 'repository of the discipline' ({{lang-pi|Vinaye agganikkhitto|italic=yes}}).{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}} In some schools, he is also seen as an expert in the [[Bodhisattva Precepts|precepts]] of a ''[[bodhisattva|bodhisatta]]'' ({{lang-sa|bodhisattva|italic=yes}}; Buddha-to-be).{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} 5th-century commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] stated that Up\u0101li drew up instructions and explanatory notes for monks dealing with disciplinary matters.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}\n\nUp\u0101li was also known for his strictness in practicing the discipline.{{sfn |Baroni |2002 |p=365}} Monks considered it a privilege to study the ''vinaya'' under him.{{sfn |Sarao |2003 |p=4}} At times, monks who felt repentance and wanted to improve themselves, sought his advice.<!--Raman\u012byavih\u0101r\u012b Thera--> In other cases, Up\u0101li was consulted in making decisions considering alleged offenses of monastic discipline. For example, one newly ordained nun was found pregnant, and was judged by the monk [[Devadatta]] as unfit to be a nun. However, the Buddha had Up\u0101li do a second investigation, during which Up\u0101li called upon the help of the laywoman [[Visakha|Visakh\u0101]] and several other laypeople. Eventually, Up\u0101li concluded the nun had conceived the child by her husband before her ordination as a nun, and therefore was innocent. The Buddha later praised Up\u0101li for his careful consideration of this matter.<!--Kum\u0101ra-Kassapa-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Kum\u0101ra-Kassapa; Raman\u012byavih\u0101r\u012b Thera}}\n\nOther notable cases about which Up\u0101li decided are that of the monks Bharukaccha and Ajjuka. Bharukaccha consulted Up\u0101li whether dreaming about having sex with a woman amounted to an offense that required disrobing, and Up\u0101li judged it did not.<!--Bharukaccha--> As for the monk Ajjuka, he had decided about a dispute about real estate.<!--Ajjuka-->{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Ajjuka; Bharukaccha}}.

He asked Ajjuka to invite for an audience the person who had the most faith of the two{{em dash}}Ajjuka invited the nephew. Angry about the decision, the son accused Ajjuka of partisanship and went to see the monk [[\u0100nanda]]. \u0100nanda disagreed with Ajjuka's decision, judging the son the more rightful heir, and causing the son to feel justified in accusing Ajjuka of not being a \"true monk\". When Up\u0101li got involved, however, he judged in favor of Ajjuka. He pointed out to \u0100nanda that the act of inviting a layperson did not break monastic discipline.{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Huxley |2010 |p=278}}. {{harvtxt |Freedman |1977 |pp=30\u201332}} mentions faith, the son seeing \u0100nanda, and the accusation of false monkhood.}} Eventually, \u0100nanda agreed with Up\u0101li, and Up\u0101li was able to settle the issue.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=32}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Ajjuka}} Here, too, the Buddha praised Up\u0101li for his handling of the case.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1961}} Law scholar [[Andrew Huxley (law scholar)|Andrew Huxley]] noted that Up\u0101li's judgment of this case allowed monks to engage on an ethical level with the world, whereas \u0100nanda's judgment did not.{{sfn |Huxley |2010 |p=278}}\n\n=== First Council and death ===\n[[File:Nava Jetavana Temple - Shravasti - 013 First Council at Rajagaha (9241729223).jpg|The First Council.

This tradition has been used by some modern scholars to calculate the [[parinirvana|passing away]] of the Buddha,<!--6--> but has now been debunked as historically unlikely.<!--7--> Still, data pertaining to the ''vinayadharas'' is used to support theories regarding the dating of the Buddha's life and death,<!--6--> such as the one proposed by Indologist [[Richard Gombrich]].<!--8-->{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Prebish |2008 |pp=6\u20138}}. {{harvtxt |Geiger |1912 |p=xlvii}} mentions the term ''para\u1e43par\u0101''.}}\n[[File:Daoxuan (Nara National Museum).jpg|thumb|The Chinese Vinaya school founded by Tao-hs\u00fcan saw themselves as the continuation of Up\u0101li's lineage ([[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|ICP]], [[Nara National Museum]]) |upright=.7]]\nNot only in ancient India did certain lineages identify with Up\u0101li. In 7th-century China, the Vinaya or Nan-shan School was founded by the monks Ku-hsin and [[Tao-hs\u00fcan]], seen as a continuation of Up\u0101li's lineage. The school emphasized restoring and propagating the ''vinaya'' and became popular in the Pa Hwa Hills of [[Nanking]]. It developed a standard for teaching the ''vinaya''. The monks would wear black and emphasized protecting oneself against error. It was believed at the time that Ku-hsin was a reincarnation of Up\u0101li.{{refn |For Ku-hsin, the Pa Hwa Hills, the standard and the reincarnation, see {{harvtxt |Hsiang-Kuang |1956 |p=207}}.

Much of this is found in the ''[[Pariv\u0101ra]]'', a late ''vinaya'' text.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}} Bareau has suggested the conversation between the Buddha and Up\u0101li about schisms was the origin of the traditions about this subject in the ''Vinayapi\u1e6daka''.{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=169}} In the ''vinaya'' texts of the Sarvastiv\u0101da tradition, the ''Uttragrantha''{{sfn

P\u0101li at all.{{sfn |Norman |1983 |p=29}} With regard to these lists of questions, it is unknown which of these questions are from Up\u0101li, and which were attributed to him because of his

Up\u0101li was born a low-caste barber. He met the Buddha when still a child, and later, when the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes received [[pabbajja|ordination]], he did so as well. He was ordained before the princes, putting humility before caste. Having been ordained, Up\u0101li learnt both Buddhist doctrine ({{lang-pi|Dhamma|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|Dharma|italic=yes}}) and ''vinaya''. His [[Upadhyay#In_Buddhism|preceptor]] was Kappitaka. Up\u0101li became known for his mastery and strictness of ''vinaya'' and was consulted often about ''vinaya'' matters. A notable case he decided was that of the monk Ajjuka, who was accused of partisanship in a conflict about real estate. During the First Council, Up\u0101li received the important role of reciting the ''vinaya'', for which he is mostly known.\n\nScholars have analyzed Up\u0101li's role and that of other disciples in the early texts, and it has been suggested that his role in the texts was emphasized during a period of compiling that stressed monastic discipline, during which [[Mahakassapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}}) and Up\u0101li became the most important disciples. Later, Up\u0101li and his pupils became known as ''vinayadharas'' ([[P\u0101li]]; 'custodians of the vinaya'), who preserved the monastic discipline after the Buddha's ''[[parinirvana|parinibb\u0101na]]'' ({{lang-sa|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a|italic=yes}}; passing into final Nirvana). This lineage became an important part of the identity of [[Ceylon]]ese and Burmese Buddhism. In China, the 7th-century Vinaya school referred to Up\u0101li as their patriarch, and it was believed that one of their founders was a reincarnation of him. The technical conversations about ''vinaya'' between the Buddha and Up\u0101li were recorded in the P\u0101li and [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] traditions and have been suggested as an important subject of study for modern-day ethics in [[American Buddhism]].\n\n== Accounts ==\nUp\u0101li's personality is not depicted extensively in the texts, as the texts mostly emphasize his stereotypical qualities as an expert in monastic discipline, especially so in the [[P\u0101li]] texts.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=67, 231}}\n\n=== Early life ===\nAccording to the texts, Up\u0101li was therefore a barber, a despised profession in ancient India.{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1899 |p=102}}{{sfn |Gombrich |1995 |p=357}} He was from an [[Vaishya|artisan caste]] family in service to the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes in [[Kapilavatthu]] ({{lang-sa|\u015aakya; Kapilavastu}}) and, according to the ''[[Mah\u0101vastu]]'', to the Buddha. Up\u0101li's mother had once introduced Up\u0101li to the Buddha.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'', [[Dharmaguptaka]] and Chinese texts relate that as a child, Up\u0101li shaved the hair of the Buddha. Unlike adults, he had no fear of approaching the Buddha. Once, as he was guided by the Buddha during the shaving, he attained [[jhana|advanced states of meditation]]. Buddhologist [[Andr\u00e9 Bareau]] argues that this story is ancient, because it precedes the tradition of art depictions of the Buddha with curly hair, and the glorification of Up\u0101li as an adult.{{sfn |Bareau |1962 |p=262}}\n\nAccording to the Mah\u0101vastu, the P\u0101li [[Cullavagga]] and the texts of discipline of the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] order, when the princes left home to become monks, Up\u0101li followed them. Since the princes handed Up\u0101li all their possessions, including jewelry, he figured that returning to Kapilavatthu with these possessions might cause him to be accused of having killed the princes for theft. Up\u0101li therefore decided to become ordained with them. They were ordained by the Buddha at the [[Malla (India)|Anupiy\u0101 grove]].{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}. For the texts of traditions apart from P\u0101li, see {{harvtxt |Freedman |1977 |p=97}}.}} Several variations on the story of Up\u0101li's ordination exist, but all of them emphasize that his status in the ''sa\u1e45gha'' ({{lang-sa|sa\u1e43gha|italic=yes}}; monastic community) was independent of his caste origin. In the P\u0101li version, the princes, including [[Anuruddha]] ({{lang-sa|Aniruddha}}), voluntarily allowed Up\u0101li to ordain before them in order to give him seniority in order of ordination and abandon their own attachment to caste and social status.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}[[File:Kapilavastu.jpg|thumb|Remains at [[Tilaurakot]], one of the two sites that may have been Kapilavatthu |alt=Ruins of walled buildings]] In the Tibetan M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, co-disciple [[Sariputra|S\u0101riputta]] ({{lang-sa|\u015a\u0101riputra}}) persuaded Up\u0101li to become ordained when he hesitated because of being low caste, but in the ''Mah\u0101vastu'', it was Up\u0101li's own initiative.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'' continues that after all the monks had been ordained, the Buddha requested that the former princes bow for their former barber, which led to consternation among the witnessing king [[Bimbisara|Bimbis\u0101ra]] and advisers, who also bowed for Up\u0101li following their example.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}} It became widely known that the Sakyans had their barber ordained before them to humble their pride,{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=116}} as the Buddha related a ''[[Jataka|J\u0101taka]]'' tale that the king and advisers had bowed for Up\u0101li in a previous life, too.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}}{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=10}}\n\nIndologist [[T.W.

The RRP has since been reestablished in 3rd [[Radio Battalion]], Kaneohe HI.

Gray]] -->\n[[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|Lt. General Alfred M. Gray, Jr.]], Commanding General of [[Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic]] (FMFLant) and future [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], and Lt. Col. Bill Keller, Commanding Officer of 2nd [[Radio Battalion]], [[Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic|FMFLant]], met at [[Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point]] in the spring of 1984 to welcome home the returning members of the 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment from [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. The [[Marines]] of 2nd[[Radio Battalion]] had conducted tactical [[Cryptology|cryptologic]] operations in support of the entire deployment of the [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|US peacekeeping force]] in [[Beirut]] since the initial landings at [[Beirut International Airport]].\n\nDuring the wait, [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|Gray]] and Keller were discussing the various problems faced by the [[Radio Battalion]] detachment. Both agreed that the most significant problem was the lack of a tactical [[Cryptology|cryptologic]] database available from national and theater assets prior to the [[Marines]]' landing in [[Beirut]]. Equally significant were the unconventional aspects of the communications networks used by the various factions in [[Beirut]]. Those that posed the greatest threat to the [[Marines]] did not abide by standard military communications procedures, nor did they follow set frequencies or [[call sign]]s.\n\nBecause the detachment had received no intelligence from the [[National Security Agency]] prior to deployment, they were forced to start from scratch upon arrival in [[Beirut]]. [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] wanted to integrate a [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Reconnaissance]] team with attached [[Radio Battalion]] [[Cryptology|cryptologists]], selected and trained for [[terrestrial reconnaissance]] and special operations. He directed Lt. Col. Keller to coordinate with [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]] to test this idea.\n\nKeller coordinated with the Commanding Officer of [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]], Maj. Joe Crockett. Their initial step was to attach a [[Radio Battalion]] Marine, equipped with an AN/GRR-8 receiver to a [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] Team during an exercise and see if he could keep up and do something worthwhile. The experiment did not go well, and the concept was tabled until that summer, when Lieutenant Colonel Chuck Gallina became Commanding Officer (CO) of 2nd [[Radio Battalion|Radio Bn.]] [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] discussed the idea with Gallina, who became a major proponent of the concept.\n\nIn December 1984, [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] E.L. Gillespie, a J2 SIGINT Operations Officer in [[Joint Special Operations Command]], arrived at [[Radio Battalion]] to develop a concept of operations to integrate [[Radio Battalion]] Marines with [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] teams for independent advance force operations.\n\nCaptain Gillespie submitted a draft \"Talking Paper\" contending that integration with a four-man [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] team was not viable due to conflicting missions. He suggested that a separate six-man [[Radio Battalion|Radio Bn]] team be trained in selected airborne and seaborne insertion/extraction techniques, terrestrial reconnaissance and survival skills.\n\nThe original mission statement for the team was, \"To conduct limited [[communications intelligence]] and specified [[electronic warfare]] operations in support of Force Reconnaissance operations during advance force or special operations missions.''\n\nThe initial list of titles for this proposed group was:\n* Force Reconnaissance Support Team (FRST)\n* Radio Search Team (RST)\n* Signal Search Team (SST)\n* Special Search Team (SST)\n* Radio Research Team (RRT)\n* Radio Reconnaissance Team (RRT)\n[[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] got the list and personally circled the Radio Reconnaissance Team as the official name for the teams. He then directed the CO of [[Radio Battalion]] to screen, select, and train the required personnel to deploy two six-man RRT's for a [[proof of concept]] operational deployment during the advance force operational phase of Exercise Solid Shield-85.\n\nHe also ensured that the CO of [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]] would assist in the personnel selection, training and equipping, and that [[II Marine Expeditionary Force|II MEF's]] Solid Shield-85 OPLANS, OPORDERS, and Annexes would adequately reflect the integration of the RRT.\n\nCaptain Gillespie was directed to immediately commence screening of 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] personnel. However, most [[Radio Battalion]] Marines did not share the officers' enthusiasm for the project. There was also resistance by Company Commanders, who did not want to allow their best Marines to be assigned to the task. With the exception of the [[Non-commissioned officer|Senior non-commissioned officers]] and [[Sergeants]], the majority of the Marines provided to form the initial RRT's were \"malcontents\" waiting to be [[Military discharge|discharged]].\n\nAt this time, Major Carrick insisted that all of the RRT candidates must go through the 2nd [[Force Reconnaissance]] Company [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoctrination Process (Indoc)]]. Carrick later admitted that the only reason that he insisted on this issue was that he felt that all or most of the [[Radio Battalion]] Marines would either quit or fail the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]] and the project would be put to rest once and for all.\n\nHowever, all of the RRT candidates passed the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]]. Captain Gillespie later talked to the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]] instructors, who indicated that they had done everything that they could think of to make the RRT Marines quit, but they wouldn't.\n\nAfter the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]], one RRT was sent to [[United States Army Airborne School|Army Airborne School]] at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], while the other Marines prepared and trained for Solid Shield-85.

The 24th MEU(SOC) RRT reinforced by members of 1st RRP with specific linguist skills, was involved in significant cryptologic operations in the [[Persian Gulf]] and provided intelligence support for several [[Iran\u2013Iraq War#The Tanker War and U.S. support for Iraq|combat actions against]] [[Islamic Republic of Iran Navy|Iranian forces]], including the seizure of the Iranian mine-laying vessel, [[Iran Ajr]] and the [[Operation Prime Chance|incident at Middle Shoals Light]].

Gray]] -->\n[[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|Lt. General Alfred M. Gray, Jr.]], Commanding General of [[Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic]] (FMFLant) and future [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], and Lt. Col. Bill Keller, Commanding Officer of 2nd [[Radio Battalion]], [[Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic|FMFLant]], met at [[Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point]] in the spring of 1984 to welcome home the returning members of the 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment from [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. The [[Marines]] of 2nd[[Radio Battalion]] had conducted tactical [[Cryptology|cryptologic]] operations in support of the entire deployment of the [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|US peacekeeping force]] in [[Beirut]] since the initial landings at [[Beirut International Airport]].\n\nDuring the wait, [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|Gray]] and Keller were discussing the various problems faced by the [[Radio Battalion]] detachment. Both agreed that the most significant problem was the lack of a tactical [[Cryptology|cryptologic]] database available from national and theater assets prior to the [[Marines]]' landing in [[Beirut]]. Equally significant were the unconventional aspects of the communications networks used by the various factions in [[Beirut]]. Those that posed the greatest threat to the [[Marines]] did not abide by standard military communications procedures, nor did they follow set frequencies or [[call sign]]s.\n\nBecause the detachment had received no intelligence from the [[National Security Agency]] prior to deployment, they were forced to start from scratch upon arrival in [[Beirut]]. [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] wanted to integrate a [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Reconnaissance]] team with attached [[Radio Battalion]] [[Cryptology|cryptologists]], selected and trained for [[terrestrial reconnaissance]] and special operations. He directed Lt. Col. Keller to coordinate with [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]] to test this idea.\n\nKeller coordinated with the Commanding Officer of [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]], Maj. Joe Crockett. Their initial step was to attach a [[Radio Battalion]] Marine, equipped with an AN/GRR-8 receiver to a [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] Team during an exercise and see if he could keep up and do something worthwhile. The experiment did not go well, and the concept was tabled until that summer, when Lieutenant Colonel Chuck Gallina became Commanding Officer (CO) of 2nd [[Radio Battalion|Radio Bn.]] [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] discussed the idea with Gallina, who became a major proponent of the concept.\n\nIn December 1984, [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] E.L. Gillespie, a J2 SIGINT Operations Officer in [[Joint Special Operations Command]], arrived at [[Radio Battalion]] to develop a concept of operations to integrate [[Radio Battalion]] Marines with [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] teams for independent advance force operations.\n\nCaptain Gillespie submitted a draft \"Talking Paper\" contending that integration with a four-man [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] team was not viable due to conflicting missions. He suggested that a separate six-man [[Radio Battalion|Radio Bn]] team be trained in selected airborne and seaborne insertion/extraction techniques, terrestrial reconnaissance and survival skills.\n\nThe original mission statement for the team was, \"To conduct limited [[communications intelligence]] and specified [[electronic warfare]] operations in support of Force Reconnaissance operations during advance force or special operations missions.''\n\nThe initial list of titles for this proposed group was:\n* Force Reconnaissance Support Team (FRST)\n* Radio Search Team (RST)\n* Signal Search Team (SST)\n* Special Search Team (SST)\n* Radio Research Team (RRT)\n* Radio Reconnaissance Team (RRT)\n[[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] got the list and personally circled the Radio Reconnaissance Team as the official name for the teams. He then directed the CO of [[Radio Battalion]] to screen, select, and train the required personnel to deploy two six-man RRT's for a [[proof of concept]] operational deployment during the advance force operational phase of Exercise Solid Shield-85.\n\nHe also ensured that the CO of [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]] would assist in the personnel selection, training and equipping, and that [[II Marine Expeditionary Force|II MEF's]] Solid Shield-85 OPLANS, OPORDERS, and Annexes would adequately reflect the integration of the RRT.\n\nCaptain Gillespie was directed to immediately commence screening of 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] personnel. However, most [[Radio Battalion]] Marines did not share the officers' enthusiasm for the project. There was also resistance by Company Commanders, who did not want to allow their best Marines to be assigned to the task. With the exception of the [[Non-commissioned officer|Senior non-commissioned officers]] and [[Sergeants]], the majority of the Marines provided to form the initial RRT's were \"malcontents\" waiting to be [[Military discharge|discharged]].\n\nAt this time, Major Carrick insisted that all of the RRT candidates must go through the 2nd [[Force Reconnaissance]] Company [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoctrination Process (Indoc)]]. Carrick later admitted that the only reason that he insisted on this issue was that he felt that all or most of the [[Radio Battalion]] Marines would either quit or fail the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]] and the project would be put to rest once and for all.\n\nHowever, all of the RRT candidates passed the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]]. Captain Gillespie later talked to the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]] instructors, who indicated that they had done everything that they could think of to make the RRT Marines quit, but they wouldn't.\n\nAfter the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]], one RRT was sent to [[United States Army Airborne School|Army Airborne School]] at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], while the other Marines prepared and trained for Solid Shield-85. The exercise went well, and by all accounts, the [[Radio Reconnaissance]] [[proof of concept]] was an unqualified success.\n\nIn 1987, [[Radio Battalion#1st Radio Battalion|1st Radio Battalion]] at [[Marine Corps Base Hawaii|MCB Hawaii]] officially created a Radio Reconnaissance Platoon. Prior to 1987, the [[battalion]] had shied away from designating the unit as \"Radio Reconnaissance\" for fear of dividing vital resources and creating a separatist culture within the ranks of MEU(SOC) deploying [[Radio Battalion]] detachments. 1st RRP Marines trained with Alpha Company, [[3rd Reconnaissance Battalion]] in the initial stages and attended various multi-service schools to perfect their skills. During its first two years, 1st [[Radio Battalion's]] RRIP consisted of 4\u20136 months of training, formal schools, and exercises prior to a Marine achieving certification and being assigned to a team.\n\nBetween 1986 and 1989, RRT's were deployed as an element of the [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]] ([[Special Operations Capable]]) [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment assigned to each of the rotating [[11th Marine Expeditionary Unit|11th]], [[13th Marine Expeditionary Unit|13th]], [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit|15th]], [[22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit|22nd]], [[24th Marine Expeditionary Unit|24th]], and [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit|26th MEU(SOC)]] deployments.\n\nCaptain Gillespie was assigned as the officer in charge of the 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment, 24th MEU(SOC) in 1986, which was the first [[Radio Battalion]] detachment to conduct real world operations during [[Operation Earnest Will]] (a [[Kuwait]]i [[oil tanker]] escort operation). The 24th MEU(SOC) RRT reinforced by members of 1st RRP with specific linguist skills, was involved in significant cryptologic operations in the [[Persian Gulf]] and provided intelligence support for several [[Iran\u2013Iraq War#The Tanker War and U.S. support for Iraq|combat actions against]] [[Islamic Republic of Iran Navy|Iranian forces]], including the seizure of the Iranian mine-laying vessel, [[Iran Ajr]] and the [[Operation Prime Chance|incident at Middle Shoals Light]]. Other RRT personnel were involved in actions in [[Panama]] leading to and during [[Operation Just Cause]], the invasion of [[Panama]].\n\nIn the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Theater, the first certified RRT to participate in real-world operations deployed in 1988\u201389 as part of the 13th MEU(SOC) [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment commanded by [[First Lieutenant#U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force|First Lieutenant]] Kirk Kicklighter.

It can be used on wounds such as cuts.\n\n'Poultice' may also refer to a porous solid filled with solvent used to remove stains from porous stone such as marble or granite.\n\nThe word \"poultice\" comes from the Greek word \u201cpoltos\u201d transformed in the Latin ''puls, pultes'', meaning \"porridge\".\n\n== Types ==\n* Some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] used [[mashed pumpkin]] or [[Devil's club|Devil&rsquo;s club]] as a poultice.<ref>Roberts, Margaret. ''Edible & Medicinal Flowers.'' Cape Town, South Africa: New Africa Books, 2000. {{ISBN|0-86486-467-1}}</ref>\n*Native Americans have thousands of plants for the making of poultices.

It is packed into the wound and then covered with a piece of sacking or similar material before being bandaged onto the site of the wound.\n* There are also many commercial poultices that are ready-made.  Some of these may be labeled as \"drawing salves\".\n* Ash poultices can cause a [[chemical burn]].<ref>Morritt AN, Bache SE, Ralston D, Stephenson AJ., [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19826262 Coal ash poultice: an unusual cause of a chemical burn.], ''J Burn Care Res'', 2009 Nov-Dec;30(6):1046-7.</ref>\n\n== Inflammation treatment ==\n[[File:Linseed flax (Linum usitatissimum), near Whitsbury - geograph.org.uk - 1377610.jpg|thumb|240px|Linseed flax (''[[Flax|Linum usitatissimum]]'') may be used in a poultice for boils, inflammation and wounds.]]\nA poultice is a proposed cooling product that is commonly used for showjumpers and racehorses, as it is often cheaper and easier to administer than many other cooling products. Ice Tite is a poultice that is applied to the horse\u2019s distal limbs after exercise, for 9 - 12 hours. The intended effect of Ice Tite is to cool the horse\u2019s legs over a long period of time, by drawing heat out of the leg through evaporation. It is common practice to bandage over the Ice Tite, using bandages and bandage fillers, and to place either wet newspaper or cellophane wrap between the Ice Tite and bandages, yet bandaging over the poultice may also prevent the action of heat evaporation and, therefore, prevent cooling i.e. heat can\u2019t escape. It is also worth noting dry poultice stores heat.<ref>{{cite web |title=How to Care for Horse Legs |url=https://www.yourvetonline.com/how-to-care-for-horse-legs/ |website=yourvetonline.com |accessdate=11 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nPoultices may also be heated and placed on an area where extra circulation is desired.\n\n== Stain removal from decorative stone surfaces ==\n\nStone is a porous material which is susceptible to staining. [[Granite]] and [[marble]] are frequently used in residential construction of bathrooms and kitchens and are susceptible to a variety of stains.\n\nFrom a chemical standpoint, a porous stone becomes stained when a solution containing a [[solution|solute]] penetrates its surface and then evaporates leaving the solid solute behind within the stone. Alternatively, grease may penetrate the porous surface and remain within the stone without evaporating. In either case, the stone will become visibly \"stained\".\n\nPoultices for removing stains are made from a malleable mass of a porous material (paper, whiting, [[diatomaceous earth]], flour,<ref name=\"thisoldhouse\">{{cite web | url = http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/how-to/intro/0,,20055946,00.html | title = How to Remove Spots from Kitchen Countertops| date = 2007-09-11}}</ref> limestone) filled with a [[solvent]] which can be applied to the surface of the stone. The solvent used (ammonia, acetone, alcohol, peroxide,<ref name=\"thisoldhouse\"/> etc.) depends on what substance caused the stain. As the solvent penetrates the surface of the porous stone containing the stain, it forms a single continuous solution between the stone and the poultice on the surface. The poultice is kept moist and covered to allow time for the solvent to sufficiently penetrate the stone and dissolve the staining material, be it grease or solute. The solute will then equilibrate by passive diffusion between the stone and the poultice.

Ice Tite is a poultice that is applied to the horse\u2019s distal limbs after exercise, for 9 - 12 hours. The intended effect of Ice Tite is to cool the horse\u2019s legs over a long period of time, by drawing heat out of the leg through evaporation. It is common practice to bandage over the Ice Tite, using bandages and bandage fillers, and to place either wet newspaper or cellophane wrap between the Ice Tite and bandages, yet bandaging over the poultice may also prevent the action of heat evaporation and, therefore, prevent cooling i.e. heat can\u2019t escape. It is also worth noting dry poultice stores heat.<ref>{{cite web |title=How to Care for Horse Legs |url=https://www.yourvetonline.com/how-to-care-for-horse-legs/ |website=yourvetonline.com |accessdate=11 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nPoultices may also be heated and placed on an area where extra circulation is desired.\n\n== Stain removal from decorative stone surfaces ==\n\nStone is a porous material which is susceptible to staining. [[Granite]] and [[marble]] are frequently used in residential construction of bathrooms and kitchens and are susceptible to a variety of stains.\n\nFrom a chemical standpoint, a porous stone becomes stained when a solution containing a [[solution|solute]] penetrates its surface and then evaporates leaving the solid solute behind within the stone. Alternatively, grease may penetrate the porous surface and remain within the stone without evaporating. In either case, the stone will become visibly \"stained\".\n\nPoultices for removing stains are made from a malleable mass of a porous material (paper, whiting, [[diatomaceous earth]], flour,<ref name=\"thisoldhouse\">{{cite web | url = http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/how-to/intro/0,,20055946,00.html | title = How to Remove Spots from Kitchen Countertops| date = 2007-09-11}}</ref> limestone) filled with a [[solvent]] which can be applied to the surface of the stone. The solvent used (ammonia, acetone, alcohol, peroxide,<ref name=\"thisoldhouse\"/> etc.) depends on what substance caused the stain. As the solvent penetrates the surface of the porous stone containing the stain, it forms a single continuous solution between the stone and the poultice on the surface. The poultice is kept moist and covered to allow time for the solvent to sufficiently penetrate the stone and dissolve the staining material, be it grease or solute. The solute will then equilibrate by passive diffusion between the stone and the poultice. After an adequate time for this process to occur, the poultice is removed and with it the solution containing a portion of the dissolved solute or \"stain\". Multiple repetitions of the process will eventually decrease the concentration of the solute or \"stain\" within the stone until it is invisible or minimally visible.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Medical treatments]]\n[[Category:Equine injury and lameness]]\n", "name_user": "WhinyTheYounger", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed redundant citations", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultice"}

Tablets found in the Hurrian city of [[Nuzi]] in the early 20th century appear to use the term ''Kinahnu'' as a synonym for red or [[tyrian purple|purple dye]], laboriously produced by the [[Kassites|Kassite]] rulers of [[Babylon]] from [[murex]] molluscs as early as 1600&nbsp;BC, and on the Mediterranean coast by the Phoenicians from a byproduct of glassmaking. Purple cloth became a renowned Canaanite export commodity which is mentioned in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]. The dyes may have been named after their place of origin. The name 'Phoenicia' is connected with the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for \"purple\", apparently referring to the same product, but it is difficult to state with certainty whether the Greek word came from the name, or ''vice versa''. The purple cloth of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] in Phoenicia was well known far and wide and was associated by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] with nobility and royalty. However, according to [[Robert Drews]], Speiser's proposal has generally been abandoned.{{sfn|Drews|1998|p=48|ps=: \"Until E.A. Speiser proposed that the name \u2018Canaan\u2019 was derived from the (unattested) word kinahhu, which Speiser supposed must have been an Akkadian term for reddish-blue or purple, Semiticists regularly explained \u2018Canaan\u2019 (Hebrew k\u00ebna\u2018an; elsewhere in Northwest Semitic kn\u2018n) as related to the Aramaic verb kn\u2018: \u2018to bend down, be low\u2019.

In this document we find a reference to LUhabbatum u LUKi-na-ah-num. The wording of this passage creates some problems as to the identity of these 'Canaanites', because of the parallelism between LUKh-na-ah-num and LUhabbatum, which is unexpected. The Akkadian word habbatum, the meaning of which is actually 'brigands', is sometimes used to translate the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] expression SA.GAZ, which is normally thought to be a logogram for habiru, 'Hebrews'. Thus there is some reason to question the identity of the 'Canaanites' who appear in this text from Marl We may ask whether these people were called 'Canaanites' because they were ethnically of another stock than the ordinary population of Mari, or whether it was because they came from a specific geographical area, the land of Canaan. However, because of the parallelism in this text between LUhabbatum and LUKi-na-ah-num, we cannot exclude the possibility that the expression 'Canaanites' was used here with a sociological meaning. It could be that the word 'Canaanites' was in this case understood as a sociological designation of some sort which shared at least some connotations with the sociological term habiru. Should this be the case, the Canaanites of Marl may well have been refugees or outlaws rather than ordinary foreigners from a certain country (from Canaan).

The [[Hebrew Bible]] mentions the ''Amorites'' in the ''[[Table of Nations|Table of Peoples]]'' ([[Book of Genesis]] 10:16\u201318a). Evidently, the Amorites played a significant role in the early history of Canaan. In Book of Genesis 14:7 ''f''., [[Book of Joshua]] 10:5 ''f''., [[Book of Deuteronomy]] 1:19 ''f''., 27, 44, we find them located in the southern mountain country, while verses such as [[Book of Numbers]] 21:13, Book of Joshua 9:10, 24:8, 12, etc.tell of two great Amorite kings residing at [[Heshbon]] and [[Ashteroth Karnaim|Ashteroth]], east of the Jordan. However, other passages such as Book of Genesis 15:16, 48:22, Book of Joshua 24:15, [[Book of Judges]] 1:34, etc. regard the name ''Amorite'' as synonymous with \"Canaanite\"; however \"Amorite\" is never used for the population on the coast. {{Citation needed|reason= Putting biblical reference for a paragraph in a historical article is dubious at best if not clarified from the onset of the paragraph|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn the centuries preceding the appearance of the biblical Hebrews, parts of Canaan and southwestern Syria became tributary to the Egyptian Pharaohs, although domination by the Egyptians remained sporadic, and not strong enough to prevent frequent local rebellions and inter-city struggles. Other areas such as northern Canaan and northern Syria came to be ruled by the Assyrians during this period. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nUnder [[Thutmose III]] (1479\u20131426&nbsp;BC) and [[Amenhotep II]] (1427\u20131400&nbsp;BC), the regular presence of the strong hand of the Egyptian ruler and his armies kept the Amorites and Canaanites sufficiently loyal. Nevertheless, Thutmose III reported a new and troubling element in the population. [[Habiru]] or (in Egyptian) 'Apiru, are reported for the first time. These seem to have been mercenaries, brigands, or outlaws, who may have at one time led a settled life, but with bad luck or due to the force of circumstances, contributed a rootless element to the population, prepared to hire themselves to whichever local mayor, king, or princeling would pay for their support. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAlthough Habiru {{transl|Xsux|SA-GAZ}} (a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ideogram glossed as \"brigand\" in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]), and sometimes ''{{lang|akk|[[Habiru|Habiri]]}}'' (an Akkadian word) had been reported in Mesopotamia from the reign of the [[Sumer]]ian king, [[Shulgi]] of [[Ur III]], their appearance in Canaan appears{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} to have been due to the arrival of a new state based in Asia Minor to the north of Assyria and based upon a [[Maryannu]] aristocracy of horse-drawn [[chariot]]eers, associated with the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] rulers of the [[Hurrians]], known as [[Mitanni]].\n\nThe Habiru seem to have been more a social class than an ethnic group.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} One analysis{{which|date=June 2018}} shows that the majority were, however, Hurrian (a non-Semitic-speaking group from Asia Minor who spoke a [[language isolate]]), though there were a number of Semites and even some [[Kassites|Kassite]] and [[Luwian]] adventurers amongst their number. The reign of [[Amenhotep III]], as a result was not quite so tranquil for the Asiatic province, as Habiru/'Apiru contributed to greater political instability. It is believed{{By whom|date= February 2012}} that turbulent chiefs began to seek their opportunities, though as a rule they could not find them without the help of a neighbouring king. The boldest of the disaffected nobles was [[Aziru]], son of [[Abdi-Ashirta]], a prince of Amurru, who, even before the death of Amenhotep III, endeavoured to extend his power into the plain of [[Damascus]]. [[Akizzi]], governor of Katna ([[Qatna]]?) (near [[Hama#Hama in the Bible|Hamath]]), reported this to the Pharaoh, who seems to have sought to frustrate Aziru's attempts. In the reign of the next pharaoh ([[Akhenaten]], reigned {{circa}} 1352 to {{circa}} 1335 BC) however, both father and son caused infinite trouble to loyal servants of Egypt like [[Rib-Hadda]], governor of [[Byblos|Gubla]] (Gebal), not the least through transferring loyalty from the Egyptian crown to that of the expanding neighbouring Asia-Minor-based [[Hittite Empire]] under [[Suppiluliuma I]]<ref>{{cite book |first=A.

Abdi-Ashirta and his son Aziru, at first afraid of the Hittites, afterwards made a treaty with their king, and joining with the Hittites, attacked and conquered the districts remaining loyal to Egypt. In vain did Rib-Hadda send touching appeals for aid to the distant Pharaoh, who was far too engaged in his religious innovations to attend to such messages.\n\nThe Amarna letters tell of the Habiri in northern Syria. [[Etakkama]] wrote thus to the Pharaoh:\n\n:\"Behold, [[Biryawaza|Namyawaza]] has surrendered all the cities of the king, my lord to the {{transl|Xsux|SA-GAZ}} in the land of [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]] and in [[Upu|Ubi]].

Apparently this restless warrior found his death at the siege of [[Gina (Canaan)|Gina]]. All these princes, however, maligned each other in their letters to the Pharaoh, and protested their own innocence of traitorous intentions. Namyawaza, for instance, whom Etakkama (see above) accused of disloyalty, wrote thus to the Pharaoh,\n\n:\"Behold, I and my warriors and my chariots, together with my brethren and my {{transl|Xsux|SA-GAZ}}, and my [[Sutean|Suti]] ?9 are at the disposal of the (royal) troops to go whithersoever the king, my lord, commands.\"<ref name=\"EA189\">El Amarna letter, EA 189.</ref>\n\nFrom the mid 14th century BC through to the 11th century BC, much of Canaan (particularly the north, central, and eastern regions of [[Syria]] and the northwestern Mediterranean coastal regions) fell to the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]], and both [[Egypt]]ian and [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]] influence waned as a result.

Assyrian emperor-kings such as [[Ashurnasirpal II|Ashurnasirpal]], [[Adad-nirari II]], [[Sargon II]], [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], [[Esarhaddon]], [[Sennacherib]] and [[Ashurbanipal]] came to dominate Canaanite affairs. The [[Egyptians]], then under a [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Nubian Dynasty]], made a failed attempt to regain a foothold in the region, but were vanquished by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], leading to an Assyrian invasion and conquest of Egypt and the destruction of the [[Kushite Empire]]. The [[Kingdom of Judah]] was forced to pay tribute to Assyria. Between 616 and 605 BC the Assyrian Empire collapsed due to a series of bitter civil wars, followed by an attack by an alliance of [[Babylonians]], [[Medes]], and Persians<!-- Do not link to the disambiguation page, \"Persians\"; link to a specific iteration of this topic --> and the [[Scythians]]. The Babylonians inherited the western part of the empire of their Assyrian brethren, including all the lands in Canaan and [[Syria]], together with [[Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. They successfully defeated the Egyptians, who had belatedly attempted to aid their former masters, the Assyrians, and then remained in the region in an attempt to regain a foothold in the [[Near East]].

During these periods, Canaanites profited from their intermediary position between the ancient civilizations of the Middle East\u2014[[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]]), the [[Hittites]], and [[Minoan Crete]]\u2014to become city states of merchant princes along the coast, with small kingdoms specializing in agricultural products in the interior. This polarity, between coastal towns and agrarian hinterland, was illustrated in [[Canaanite mythology]] by the struggle between the storm god, variously called [[Teshub]] ([[Hurrian]]) or [[Baal|Ba'al Hadad]] ([[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Amorite]]/[[Aramean]]) and [[Yam (god)|Ya'a, Yaw]], [[Yahu]], or [[Yam (god)|Yam]], god of the sea and rivers. Early Canaanite civilization was characterized by small walled market towns, surrounded by peasant farmers growing a range of local [[horticulture|horticultural products]], along with commercial growing of [[olive]]s, [[grape]]s for wine, and [[pistachio]]s, surrounded by extensive [[grain]] cropping, predominantly [[wheat]] and [[barley]]. Harvest in early summer was a season when [[transhumance]] [[nomadism]] was practiced\u2014shepherds staying with their flocks during the wet season and returning to graze them on the harvested stubble, closer to water supplies in the summer. Evidence of this cycle of agriculture is found in the [[Gezer calendar]] and in the biblical cycle of the year.\n[[File:Sarcophagus of Canaanites.jpg|thumb|Canaanite sarcophagi ([[Israel Museum]])]]\nPeriods of rapid climate change generally saw a collapse of this mixed Mediterranean farming system; commercial production was replaced with [[subsistence agricultural]] foodstuffs; and transhumance [[pastoralism]] became a year-round nomadic pastoral activity, whilst tribal groups wandered in a circular pattern north to the Euphrates, or south to the Egyptian delta with their flocks. Occasionally, tribal chieftains would emerge, raiding enemy settlements and rewarding loyal followers from the spoils or by tariffs levied on merchants. Should the cities band together and retaliate, a neighbouring state intervene or should the chieftain suffer a reversal of fortune, allies would fall away or intertribal feuding would return. It has been suggested that the Patriarchal tales of the Bible reflect such social forms.<ref>{{cite book |last=Van Seters |first=John |year=1987 |title=Abraham in Myth and Tradition |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9781626549104}}</ref> During the periods of the collapse of [[Akkadian Empire]] in [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]], the [[Hyksos]] invasions and the end of the Middle Bronze Age in Assyria and Babylonia, and the Late [[Bronze Age collapse]], trade through the Canaanite area would dwindle, as Egypt, Babylonia, and to a lesser degree [[Assyria]], withdrew into their isolation. When the climates stabilized, trade would resume firstly along the coast in the area of the [[Philistines|Philistine]] and Phoenician cities. As markets redeveloped, new trade routes that would avoid the heavy tariffs of the coast would develop from [[Kadesh Barnea]], through [[Hebron]], [[Lachish]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Bethel]], [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]], [[Shechem]], [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]] through [[Galilee]] to [[Jezreel (city)|Jezreel]], [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], and [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]].

Further economic development would see the creation of a third trade route from [[Eilath]], [[Timna]], [[Edom]] ([[Mount Seir|Seir]]), [[Moab]], [[Ammon]], and thence to the Aramean states of [[Damascus]] and [[Palmyra]]. Earlier states (for example the Philistines and [[Tyrians]] in the case of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] and [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Samaria]], for the second route, and Judah and Israel for the third route) tried generally unsuccessfully to control the interior trade.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Thomas L. |year=2000 |title=Early History of the Israelite People: From the Written & Archaeological Sources |publisher=Brill Academic |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=RwrrUuHFb6UC |access-date=9 October 2018|isbn=978-9004119437 }}</ref>\n\nEventually, the prosperity of this trade would attract more powerful regional neighbours, such as [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Assyria]], the Babylonians, [[Persia]]ns, [[Ancient Greeks]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who would control the Canaanites politically, levying tribute, taxes, and tariffs. Often in such periods, thorough overgrazing would result in a climatic collapse and a repeat of the cycle (e.g., [[PPNB]], [[Ghassulian]], [[Uruk]], and the [[Bronze Age]] cycles already mentioned). The fall of later Canaanite civilization occurred with the incorporation of the area into the [[Greco-Roman]] world (as [[Iudaea]] province), and after [[Byzantine]] times, into the Muslim [[Arab]] and proto-Muslim [[Umayyad Caliphate]].

Tablets found in the Hurrian city of [[Nuzi]] in the early 20th century appear to use the term ''Kinahnu'' as a synonym for red or [[tyrian purple|purple dye]], laboriously produced by the [[Kassites|Kassite]] rulers of [[Babylon]] from [[murex]] molluscs as early as 1600&nbsp;BC, and on the Mediterranean coast by the Phoenicians from a byproduct of glassmaking. Purple cloth became a renowned Canaanite export commodity which is mentioned in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]. The dyes may have been named after their place of origin. The name 'Phoenicia' is connected with the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for \"purple\", apparently referring to the same product, but it is difficult to state with certainty whether the Greek word came from the name, or ''vice versa''.

In this document we find a reference to LUhabbatum u LUKi-na-ah-num. The wording of this passage creates some problems as to the identity of these 'Canaanites', because of the parallelism between LUKh-na-ah-num and LUhabbatum, which is unexpected. The Akkadian word habbatum, the meaning of which is actually 'brigands', is sometimes used to translate the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] expression SA.GAZ, which is normally thought to be a logogram for habiru, 'Hebrews'. Thus there is some reason to question the identity of the 'Canaanites' who appear in this text from Marl We may ask whether these people were called 'Canaanites' because they were ethnically of another stock than the ordinary population of Mari, or whether it was because they came from a specific geographical area, the land of Canaan. However, because of the parallelism in this text between LUhabbatum and LUKi-na-ah-num, we cannot exclude the possibility that the expression 'Canaanites' was used here with a sociological meaning. It could be that the word 'Canaanites' was in this case understood as a sociological designation of some sort which shared at least some connotations with the sociological term habiru. Should this be the case, the Canaanites of Marl may well have been refugees or outlaws rather than ordinary foreigners from a certain country (from Canaan). Worth considering is also Manfred Weippert's interpretation of the passage LUhabbatum u LUKi-na-ah-num\u2014literally 'Canaanites and brigands'\u2014as 'Canaanite brigands', which may welt mean 'highwaymen of foreign origin', whether or not they were actually Canaanites coming from Phoenicia.\"}}<ref>{{cite book |title=Reallexikon der Assyriologie |chapter=Kanaan |first=Manfred |last=Weippert |volume=5 |page=352 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=cEB1Z_c50qgC |access-date=9 October 2018}}</ref> such that Robert Drews states that the \"first certain cuneiform reference\" to Canaan is found on the Alalakh statue of King Idrimi (below).{{sfn|Drews|1998|p=46|ps=: \"An eighteenth-century letter from Mari may refer to Canaan, but the first certain cuneiform reference appears on a statue base of [[Idrimi]], king of [[Alalakh]] c. 1500 BC.\"}}\n\nA reference to Ammiya being \"in the land of Canaan\" is found on the [[Statue of Idrimi]] (16th century BC) from [[Alalakh]] in modern Syria.

The [[Hebrew Bible]] mentions the ''Amorites'' in the ''[[Table of Nations|Table of Peoples]]'' ([[Book of Genesis]] 10:16\u201318a). Evidently, the Amorites played a significant role in the early history of Canaan. In Book of Genesis 14:7 ''f''., [[Book of Joshua]] 10:5 ''f''., [[Book of Deuteronomy]] 1:19 ''f''., 27, 44, we find them located in the southern mountain country, while verses such as [[Book of Numbers]] 21:13, Book of Joshua 9:10, 24:8, 12, etc.tell of two great Amorite kings residing at [[Heshbon]] and [[Ashteroth Karnaim|Ashteroth]], east of the Jordan. However, other passages such as Book of Genesis 15:16, 48:22, Book of Joshua 24:15, [[Book of Judges]] 1:34, etc. regard the name ''Amorite'' as synonymous with \"Canaanite\"; however \"Amorite\" is never used for the population on the coast. {{Citation needed|reason= Putting biblical reference for a paragraph in a historical article is dubious at best if not clarified from the onset of the paragraph|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn the centuries preceding the appearance of the biblical Hebrews, parts of Canaan and southwestern Syria became tributary to the Egyptian Pharaohs, although domination by the Egyptians remained sporadic, and not strong enough to prevent frequent local rebellions and inter-city struggles. Other areas such as northern Canaan and northern Syria came to be ruled by the Assyrians during this period. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nUnder [[Thutmose III]] (1479\u20131426&nbsp;BC) and [[Amenhotep II]] (1427\u20131400&nbsp;BC), the regular presence of the strong hand of the Egyptian ruler and his armies kept the Amorites and Canaanites sufficiently loyal. Nevertheless, Thutmose III reported a new and troubling element in the population. [[Habiru]] or (in Egyptian) 'Apiru, are reported for the first time. These seem to have been mercenaries, brigands, or outlaws, who may have at one time led a settled life, but with bad luck or due to the force of circumstances, contributed a rootless element to the population, prepared to hire themselves to whichever local mayor, king, or princeling would pay for their support. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAlthough Habiru {{transl|Xsux|SA-GAZ}} (a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ideogram glossed as \"brigand\" in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]), and sometimes ''{{lang|akk|[[Habiru|Habiri]]}}'' (an Akkadian word) had been reported in Mesopotamia from the reign of the [[Sumer]]ian king, [[Shulgi]] of [[Ur III]], their appearance in Canaan appears{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} to have been due to the arrival of a new state based in Asia Minor to the north of Assyria and based upon a [[Maryannu]] aristocracy of horse-drawn [[chariot]]eers, associated with the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] rulers of the [[Hurrians]], known as [[Mitanni]].\n\nThe Habiru seem to have been more a social class than an ethnic group.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} One analysis{{which|date=June 2018}} shows that the majority were, however, Hurrian (a non-Semitic-speaking group from Asia Minor who spoke a [[language isolate]]), though there were a number of Semites and even some [[Kassites|Kassite]] and [[Luwian]] adventurers amongst their number. The reign of [[Amenhotep III]], as a result was not quite so tranquil for the Asiatic province, as Habiru/'Apiru contributed to greater political instability. It is believed{{By whom|date= February 2012}} that turbulent chiefs began to seek their opportunities, though as a rule they could not find them without the help of a neighbouring king. The boldest of the disaffected nobles was [[Aziru]], son of [[Abdi-Ashirta]], a prince of Amurru, who, even before the death of Amenhotep III, endeavoured to extend his power into the plain of [[Damascus]]. [[Akizzi]], governor of Katna ([[Qatna]]?) (near [[Hama#Hama in the Bible|Hamath]]), reported this to the Pharaoh, who seems to have sought to frustrate Aziru's attempts. In the reign of the next pharaoh ([[Akhenaten]], reigned {{circa}} 1352 to {{circa}} 1335 BC) however, both father and son caused infinite trouble to loyal servants of Egypt like [[Rib-Hadda]], governor of [[Byblos|Gubla]] (Gebal), not the least through transferring loyalty from the Egyptian crown to that of the expanding neighbouring Asia-Minor-based [[Hittite Empire]] under [[Suppiluliuma I]]<ref>{{cite book |first=A.

Abdi-Ashirta and his son Aziru, at first afraid of the Hittites, afterwards made a treaty with their king, and joining with the Hittites, attacked and conquered the districts remaining loyal to Egypt. In vain did Rib-Hadda send touching appeals for aid to the distant Pharaoh, who was far too engaged in his religious innovations to attend to such messages.\n\nThe Amarna letters tell of the Habiri in northern Syria. [[Etakkama]] wrote thus to the Pharaoh:\n\n:\"Behold, [[Biryawaza|Namyawaza]] has surrendered all the cities of the king, my lord to the {{transl|Xsux|SA-GAZ}} in the land of [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]] and in [[Upu|Ubi]].

Apparently this restless warrior found his death at the siege of [[Gina (Canaan)|Gina]]. All these princes, however, maligned each other in their letters to the Pharaoh, and protested their own innocence of traitorous intentions. Namyawaza, for instance, whom Etakkama (see above) accused of disloyalty, wrote thus to the Pharaoh,\n\n:\"Behold, I and my warriors and my chariots, together with my brethren and my {{transl|Xsux|SA-GAZ}}, and my [[Sutean|Suti]] ?9 are at the disposal of the (royal) troops to go whithersoever the king, my lord, commands.\"<ref name=\"EA189\">El Amarna letter, EA 189.</ref>\n\nFrom the mid 14th century BC through to the 11th century BC, much of Canaan (particularly the north, central, and eastern regions of [[Syria]] and the northwestern Mediterranean coastal regions) fell to the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]], and both [[Egypt]]ian and [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]] influence waned as a result.

The [[Egyptians]], then under a [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Nubian Dynasty]], made a failed attempt to regain a foothold in the region, but were vanquished by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], leading to an Assyrian invasion and conquest of Egypt and the destruction of the [[Kushite Empire]]. The [[Kingdom of Judah]] was forced to pay tribute to Assyria. Between 616 and 605 BC the Assyrian Empire collapsed due to a series of bitter civil wars, followed by an attack by an alliance of [[Babylonians]], [[Medes]], and Persians<!-- Do not link to the disambiguation page, \"Persians\"; link to a specific iteration of this topic --> and the [[Scythians]].

During these periods, Canaanites profited from their intermediary position between the ancient civilizations of the Middle East\u2014[[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]]), the [[Hittites]], and [[Minoan Crete]]\u2014to become city states of merchant princes along the coast, with small kingdoms specializing in agricultural products in the interior. This polarity, between coastal towns and agrarian hinterland, was illustrated in [[Canaanite mythology]] by the struggle between the storm god, variously called [[Teshub]] ([[Hurrian]]) or [[Baal|Ba'al Hadad]] ([[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Amorite]]/[[Aramean]]) and [[Yam (god)|Ya'a, Yaw]], [[Yahu]], or [[Yam (god)|Yam]], god of the sea and rivers. Early Canaanite civilization was characterized by small walled market towns, surrounded by peasant farmers growing a range of local [[horticulture|horticultural products]], along with commercial growing of [[olive]]s, [[grape]]s for wine, and [[pistachio]]s, surrounded by extensive [[grain]] cropping, predominantly [[wheat]] and [[barley]]. Harvest in early summer was a season when [[transhumance]] [[nomadism]] was practiced\u2014shepherds staying with their flocks during the wet season and returning to graze them on the harvested stubble, closer to water supplies in the summer. Evidence of this cycle of agriculture is found in the [[Gezer calendar]] and in the biblical cycle of the year.\n[[File:Sarcophagus of Canaanites.jpg|thumb|Canaanite sarcophagi ([[Israel Museum]])]]\nPeriods of rapid climate change generally saw a collapse of this mixed Mediterranean farming system; commercial production was replaced with [[subsistence agricultural]] foodstuffs; and transhumance [[pastoralism]] became a year-round nomadic pastoral activity, whilst tribal groups wandered in a circular pattern north to the Euphrates, or south to the Egyptian delta with their flocks. Occasionally, tribal chieftains would emerge, raiding enemy settlements and rewarding loyal followers from the spoils or by tariffs levied on merchants. Should the cities band together and retaliate, a neighbouring state intervene or should the chieftain suffer a reversal of fortune, allies would fall away or intertribal feuding would return. It has been suggested that the Patriarchal tales of the Bible reflect such social forms.<ref>{{cite book |last=Van Seters |first=John |year=1987 |title=Abraham in Myth and Tradition |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9781626549104}}</ref> During the periods of the collapse of [[Akkadian Empire]] in [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]], the [[Hyksos]] invasions and the end of the Middle Bronze Age in Assyria and Babylonia, and the Late [[Bronze Age collapse]], trade through the Canaanite area would dwindle, as Egypt, Babylonia, and to a lesser degree [[Assyria]], withdrew into their isolation. When the climates stabilized, trade would resume firstly along the coast in the area of the [[Philistines|Philistine]] and Phoenician cities. As markets redeveloped, new trade routes that would avoid the heavy tariffs of the coast would develop from [[Kadesh Barnea]], through [[Hebron]], [[Lachish]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Bethel]], [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]], [[Shechem]], [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]] through [[Galilee]] to [[Jezreel (city)|Jezreel]], [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], and [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]]. Secondary Canaanite cities would develop in this region. Further economic development would see the creation of a third trade route from [[Eilath]], [[Timna]], [[Edom]] ([[Mount Seir|Seir]]), [[Moab]], [[Ammon]], and thence to the Aramean states of [[Damascus]] and [[Palmyra]]. Earlier states (for example the Philistines and [[Tyrians]] in the case of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] and [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Samaria]], for the second route, and Judah and Israel for the third route) tried generally unsuccessfully to control the interior trade.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Thomas L. |year=2000 |title=Early History of the Israelite People: From the Written & Archaeological Sources |publisher=Brill Academic |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=RwrrUuHFb6UC |access-date=9 October 2018|isbn=978-9004119437 }}</ref>\n\nEventually, the prosperity of this trade would attract more powerful regional neighbours, such as [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Assyria]], the Babylonians, [[Persia]]ns, [[Ancient Greeks]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who would control the Canaanites politically, levying tribute, taxes, and tariffs. Often in such periods, thorough overgrazing would result in a climatic collapse and a repeat of the cycle (e.g., [[PPNB]], [[Ghassulian]], [[Uruk]], and the [[Bronze Age]] cycles already mentioned). The fall of later Canaanite civilization occurred with the incorporation of the area into the [[Greco-Roman]] world (as [[Iudaea]] province), and after [[Byzantine]] times, into the Muslim [[Arab]] and proto-Muslim [[Umayyad Caliphate]].
