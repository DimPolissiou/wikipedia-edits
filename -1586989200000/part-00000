The son of a New York stockbroker, he initially worked in his father's firm but was more interested in theater. He landed jobs as an extra in [[short films]] produced by [[Paramount Pictures]] in its Long Island studio, and also performed with several stock theater companies, culminating with playing the male lead in ''[[Sweet Adeline (musical)|Sweet Adeline]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. This performance attracted the attention of film studio executives, and in 1931, [[Fox Film]] signed him to a Hollywood contract. \n\nHis screen debut in the 1931 film ''[[Bad Girl (1931 film)|Bad Girl]]'' made him an overnight box-office star and he was cast as the lead in a succession of romantic drama and comedy films. In 1934, he co-starred with [[Shirley Temple]] in her first three films. In 1935, at the height of his popularity, he broke his studio contract two years before it expired and became a free agent. With musicals on the wane in the late 1930s, he was cast in a series of [[B movie]]s and began struggling with alcoholism in his personal life. In 1945, having not worked in film for five years, he was selected by director [[Elia Kazan]] for the role of Johnny Nolan, the dreamy alcoholic father in ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945 film)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' (1945), which earned him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. \n\nThe Oscar did not advance his film career, however, and while he still found roles in Broadway productions, in 1949 he became a [[character actor]] on television. He had a regular role in the hit sitcom ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]''  from 1954 to 1956, and guest-starred in dozens of episodes of popular television series from the 1950s through mid-1960s.

The son of a New York stockbroker, he initially worked in his father's firm but was more interested in theater. He landed jobs as an extra in [[short films]] produced by [[Paramount Pictures]] in its Long Island studio, and also performed with several stock theater companies, culminating with playing the male lead in ''[[Sweet Adeline (musical)|Sweet Adeline]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. This performance attracted the attention of film studio executives, and in 1931, [[Fox Film]] signed him to a Hollywood contract. \n\nHis screen debut in the 1931 film ''[[Bad Girl (1931 film)|Bad Girl]]'' made him an overnight box-office star and he was cast as the lead in a succession of romantic drama and comedy films. In 1934, he co-starred with [[Shirley Temple]] in her first three films. In 1935, at the height of his popularity, he broke his studio contract two years before it expired and became a free agent. With musicals on the wane in the late 1930s, he was cast in a series of [[B movie]]s and began struggling with alcoholism in his personal life. In 1945, having not worked in film for five years, he was selected by director [[Elia Kazan]] for the role of Johnny Nolan, the dreamy alcoholic father in ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945 film)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' (1945), which earned him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. \n\nThe Oscar did not advance his film career, however, and while he still found roles in Broadway productions, in 1949 he became a [[character actor]] on television. He had a regular role in the hit sitcom ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]''  from 1954 to 1956, and guest-starred in dozens of episodes of popular television series from the 1950s through mid-1960s.

Incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[George W. Bush]] defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[John Kerry]], a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Massachusetts]].\n\nBush and incumbent Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] were renominated by their party with no difficulty. Former Governor [[Howard Dean]] emerged as the early front-runner in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2004|2004 Democratic primaries]], but Kerry won the first set of primaries in January 2004 and clinched his party's nomination in March after a series of primary victories. Kerry chose Senator [[John Edwards]] of [[North Carolina]], who had himself sought the party's 2004 presidential nomination, to be his running mate.\n\nBush's popularity had soared early in his first term after the [[September 11 attacks]], but his popularity declined between 2001 and 2004. [[Foreign policy]] was the dominant theme throughout the election campaign, particularly Bush's conduct of the [[War on Terrorism]] and the aftermath of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Bush presented himself as a decisive leader and attacked Kerry as a [[Flip-flop (politics)|\"flip-flopper\"]], while Kerry criticized Bush's conduct of the [[Iraq War]]. Domestic issues were debated as well, including [[Early 2000s recession|the economy]] and jobs, [[Healthcare in the United States|health care]], [[abortion in the United States|abortion]], [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] and [[embryonic stem cell]] research.\n\nBush won by a slim margin of 50.7% of the popular vote and 286 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]. He swept the [[Southern United States|South]] and the [[Mountain States]] and took the crucial [[swing state]]s of [[2004 United States presidential election in Ohio|Ohio]], [[2004 United States presidential election in Iowa|Iowa]], and [[2004 United States presidential election in New Mexico|New Mexico]], the latter two being flipped Republican. Although Kerry flipped [[2004 United States presidential election in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] compared to the previous election, Bush's electoral map expanded numerically. Some aspects of the election process were subject to [[2004 United States election voting controversies|controversy]], but not to the degree seen in the 2000 presidential election. Bush won [[2004 United States presidential election in Florida|Florida]] by a solid five-point margin, unlike his razor-thin margin of victory there in 2000 that led to a legal challenge in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]''. Bush was the first candidate since [[George H. W. Bush|his father]] in the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 election]] to win over 50% of the popular vote. Bush's victory also marked the first, and so far only time, that a Republican nominee won a presidential election without winning any electoral votes from the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]].\n\n== Background ==\n[[George W. Bush]] won the presidency in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]]  after the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' remanded the case to the [[Florida Supreme Court]], which declared there was not sufficient time to hold a recount without violating the [[U.S. Constitution]].\n\nJust eight months into his presidency, the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks]] of September 11, 2001, suddenly transformed Bush into a wartime president. Bush's approval ratings surged to near 90%. Within a month, the forces of a coalition led by the United States [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|entered Afghanistan]], which had been sheltering [[Osama bin Laden]], suspected mastermind of the September 11 attacks. By December, the [[Taliban]] had been removed, although a long and ongoing reconstruction would follow.\n\nThe Bush administration then turned its attention to [[Iraq]], and argued the need to remove [[Saddam Hussein]] from power in Iraq had become urgent. The Iraq issue gave Bush an antagonist to present to the people, (similar but different than that of 2001). Rallying support against a common enemy rather than gaining voters through ideas or policy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Populist Persuasion|last=Kazin|first=Michael|publisher=Cornell University|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Among [[Rationale for the Iraq War|the stated reasons]] were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire [[nuclear material]] and had not properly accounted for [[biological weapons|biological]] and [[chemical weapons|chemical]] material it was known to have previously possessed. Both the possession of these [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate [[Iraq sanctions|the UN sanctions]]. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/05/international/europe/05CND-PARI.html|work=The New York Times|first =John|last=Tagliabue|title=France, Germany and Russia Vow to Stop Use of Force Against Iraq|date=March 5, 2003}}</ref> Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-03-17-inspectors-iraq_x.htm|work=USA Today|title=U.S advises weapons inspectors to leave Iraq|date=March 17, 2003}}</ref> The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a \"[[coalition of the willing]]\" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its [[military of Iraq|armed forces]]. However, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any [[weapon of mass destruction]] in Iraq. Nevertheless, on May 1, George W. Bush landed on the aircraft carrier {{USS|Abraham Lincoln|CVN-72|6}}, in a [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[S-3 Viking]], where he gave [[2003 Mission Accomplished Speech|a speech]] announcing the end of \"major combat operations\" in the [[Iraq War]]. Bush's approval rating in May was at 66%, according to a [[CNN]]\u2013[[USA Today]]\u2013[[Gallup poll|Gallup]] [[opinion poll|poll]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/24/politics/main555427.shtml|title=Bush Jumpstarts '04 Fundraising, Says Collecting Campaign Cash Now Will Keep War On Terror Focused|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=May 24, 2003|accessdate=November 3, 2008}}</ref> However, Bush's high approval ratings did not last. First, while the war itself was popular in the U.S., the reconstruction and attempted \"democratization\" of Iraq lost some support as months passed and casualty figures increased, with no decrease in violence nor progress toward stability or reconstruction. Second, as investigators combed through the country, they failed to find the predicted WMD stockpiles, which led to debate over the rationale for the war.\n\n== Nominations ==\n\n=== Republican nomination ===\n{{Main article|George W.

Senator [[Lincoln Chafee]] from Rhode Island considered challenging Bush on an anti-war platform in [[New Hampshire]], but decided not to run after the capture of [[Saddam Hussein]] in December 2003.<ref>Lincoln Chafee, ''Against the Tide'' (2007), pp. 119\u201320</ref>\n\nOn March 10, 2004, Bush officially clinched the number of delegates needed to be nominated at the [[2004 Republican National Convention]] in New York City. He accepted the nomination on September 2, 2004, and retained [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] as his [[running mate]]. During the convention and throughout the campaign, Bush focused on two themes: defending America against terrorism and building an [[ownership society]]. Bush used populist ideals in an attempt to rally citizens behind him in a time of international terror.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/feb/15/nation/na-populism15|title=A Bush-Kerry Fight to Define Populism|last=Brownstein|first=Ronald|date=2004-02-15|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> The ownership society included allowing people to invest some of their [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] in the stock market, increasing home and stock ownership, and encouraging more people to buy their own health insurance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/09/01/news/economy/election_bush_plan/|title=Bush to push ownership society - Sep.  2, 2004|last=writer|first=by Mark Gongloff, CNN/Money senior|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2017-11-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Democratic Party nomination ===\n{{Main article|John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign|2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2004 Democratic National Convention}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:DemocraticLogo.svg|65px|center|link=Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party (United States)]]<big>'''2004 Democratic Party ticket'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#3333FF; width:200px;\"| [[John Kerry|{{color|white|John Kerry}}]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#3333FF; width:200px;\"| [[John Edwards|{{color|white|John Edwards}}]]\n|-  style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:#c8ebff;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for President'''''\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for Vice President'''''\n|-\n| [[File:John F.

The majority of his donations came from individual supporters, who became known as ''Deanites'', or, more commonly, ''[[Deaniacs]]''. Generally regarded as a pragmatic [[centrist]] during his governorship, Dean emerged during his presidential campaign as a left-wing [[populism|populist]], denouncing the policies of the Bush administration (especially the invasion of Iraq) as well as fellow Democrats, who, in his view, failed to strongly oppose them. Senator Lieberman, a liberal on domestic issues but a hawk on the War on Terror, failed to gain traction with liberal Democratic primary voters.\n\nIn September 2003, retired four-star general [[Wesley Clark]] announced his intention to run for the Democratic nomination. His campaign focused on themes of leadership and patriotism; early campaign advertisements relied heavily on biography. His late start left him with relatively few detailed policy proposals. This weakness was apparent in his first few debates, although he soon presented a range of position papers, including a major tax-relief plan. Nevertheless, the Democrats did not flock to support his campaign.\n\nIn sheer numbers, [[John Kerry]] had fewer endorsements than Dean, who was far ahead in the [[superdelegate]] race going into the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2004|Iowa caucuses in January 2004]]. However, Kerry led the endorsement races in Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona, South Carolina, New Mexico, and Nevada. His main perceived weakness was in his neighboring state of New Hampshire and nearly all national polls. Most other states did not have updated polling numbers to give an accurate placing for Kerry's campaign before Iowa. Heading into the primaries, Kerry's campaign was largely seen as being in trouble, particularly after he fired campaign manager [[Jim Jordan (United States politics)|Jim Jordan]]. The key factors enabling it to survive were when fellow [[Massachusetts]] Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] assigned [[Mary Beth Cahill]] to be the new campaign manager, as well as Kerry's [[Mortgage loan|mortgaging]] his home to lend the money to his campaign (while his wife was a billionaire, campaign finance rules prohibited using one's personal fortune). He also brought on the \"magical\" [[Michael Whouley]] who would be credited with helping bring home the Iowa victory the same as he did in New Hampshire for [[Al Gore]] in 2000 against [[Bill Bradley]].\n\n==== Iowa caucus ====\n{{Main|Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2004}}\nBy the January 2004 [[Iowa caucus]]es, the field had dwindled down to nine candidates, as Bob Graham had dropped out of the race. Howard Dean was a strong front-runner. However, the Iowa caucuses yielded unexpectedly strong results for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates Kerry, who earned 38% of the state's delegates, and [[John Edwards]], who took 32%. Dean slipped to 18% and into third place, while [[Richard Gephardt]] finished fourth (11%). In the days leading up to the Iowa vote, there was much negative campaigning between the Dean and Gephardt candidacies.\n\nThe dismal results caused Gephardt to drop out and later endorse Kerry. Carol Moseley Braun also dropped out, endorsing Howard Dean. Besides the impact of coming in third, Dean was further hurt by a speech that he gave while at a post-caucus rally. He was shouting over the cheers of his enthusiastic audience, but the crowd noise was being filtered out by his [[Microphone#Unidirectional|unidirectional microphone]], leaving only his full-throated exhortations audible to the television viewers. To those at home, he seemed to raise his voice out of sheer emotion.\nThe incessant replaying of the \"[[Dean Scream]]\" by the press became a debate on whether Dean was victimized by [[media bias]]. The scream scene was shown approximately 633 times by cable and broadcast news networks in just four days after the incident, an amount not including talk shows and local news broadcasts.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Loyola Phoenix |url=http://www.loyolaphoenix.com/news/2004/02/11/Discourse/The-Scream.That.Left.Us.Blind-603629.shtml |title=The scream that left us blind |date=11 February 2004 |access-date=November 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017051047/http://media.www.loyolaphoenix.com/media/storage/paper673/news/2004/02/11/Discourse/The-Scream.That.Left.Us.Blind-603629.shtml |archive-date=October 17, 2007 }}</ref> However, those in the actual audience that day have insisted that they didn't know about the infamous \"scream\" until they returned to their hotel rooms and saw it on television.<ref name=\"CBS040126\">{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Salzman |publisher=[[CBS News]] |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/26/politics/main596021.shtml |title=Dean's Scream: Not What It Seemed |date=January 26, 2004 |accessdate=November 27, 2006}}</ref>\n\nKerry had revived his campaign and began using the slogan \"Comeback Kerry\".\n\n==== New Hampshire primary ====\nOn January 27, Kerry triumphed again, winning the [[United States presidential election in New Hampshire, 2004#Primaries|New Hampshire primary]]. Dean finished second, Clark came in third, and Edwards placed fourth. The largest of the debates was held at [[Saint Anselm College]], where both Kerry and Dean had strong performances.\n\n==== South Carolina primary ====\n[[File:Kerry02.jpg|thumb|Senator Kerry at a primary rally in St. Louis, Missouri, at the St. Louis Community College \u2013 Forest Park]]\nThe following week, Edwards won the South Carolina primary and brought home a strong second-place finish in [[Oklahoma]] to Clark. Lieberman dropped out of the campaign the following day. Kerry dominated throughout February and his support quickly snowballed as he won caucuses and primaries, taking in wins in [[Michigan]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Maine]], [[Tennessee]]; Washington, D.C.; [[Nevada]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Utah]], Hawaii, and [[Idaho]]. Clark and Dean dropped out during this time, leaving Edwards as the only real threat to Kerry. Kucinich and Sharpton continued to run despite poor results at the polls.\n\n==== Super Tuesday ====\nIn March's [[Super Tuesday]], Kerry won decisive victories in the [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], New York, [[Ohio]], and [[Rhode Island]] primaries as well as in the [[Minnesota]] caucuses. Despite having withdrawn from the race two weeks earlier, Dean won his home state of Vermont. Edwards finished only slightly behind Kerry in Georgia, but after failing to win a single state other than South Carolina, he chose to withdraw from the presidential race. Sharpton followed suit a couple weeks later. Kucinich did not leave the race officially until July.\n\n==== Democratic National Convention ====\nOn July 6, Kerry selected Edwards as his running mate, shortly before the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]] was held later that month in [[Boston]]. Days before Kerry announced Edwards as his running mate, Kerry gave a short list of three candidates: Sen. [[John Edwards]], Rep. [[Dick Gephardt]], and Gov. [[Tom Vilsack]]. Heading into the convention, the Kerry/Edwards ticket unveiled its new slogan: a promise to make America \"stronger at home and more respected in the world.\" Kerry made his [[Vietnam War]] experience the convention's prominent theme. In accepting the nomination, he began his speech with, \"I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty.\" He later delivered what may have been the speech's most memorable line when he said, \"the future doesn't belong to fear, it belongs to freedom\", a quote that later appeared in a Kerry/Edwards television advertisement.\n\nThe keynote address at the convention was delivered by [[Illinois]] State Senator (and future president) [[Barack Obama]]; the speech was well received, and it elevated Obama's status within the Democratic Party.<ref>{{cite news|author=Bernstein, David|date=June 2007|title=The Speech|magazine=Chicago Magazine|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/June-2007/The-Speech|accessdate=April 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Other nominations ===\n[[File:David Cobb on fire.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|[[David Cobb (activist)|David Cobb]] the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] candidate]]\n[[File:SI-MichaelBadnarik1.JPG|right|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] candidate Michael Badnarik]]\n{{See also|List of candidates in the United States presidential election, 2004}}\nThere were four other presidential tickets on the ballot in a number of states totaling enough electoral votes to have a theoretical possibility of winning a majority in the [[U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College]].

W. Bush|his father]] did with [[Michael Dukakis]] in the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 election]]) also sought to portray Kerry as a \"[[Massachusetts liberal]]\", who was out of touch with mainstream Americans. One of Kerry's slogans was \"Stronger at home, respected in the world.\" This advanced the suggestion that Kerry would pay more attention to domestic concerns; it also encapsulated Kerry's contention that Bush had alienated American allies by his foreign policy.\n\nAccording to one exit poll, people who voted for Bush cited the issues of terrorism and traditional values as the most important factors in their decision.<ref name=\"Exitpoll\">{{cite web| title = Decision 2004 \u2013 Exit poll | publisher = [[NBC News]]| url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5297138 | accessdate =June 5, 2008 }}</ref>  Kerry supporters cited the war in Iraq, the economy and jobs, and health care.<ref name=\"Exitpoll\" />\n\n[[File:Bush cropped.jpg|thumb|Bush speaking at campaign rally in St. Petersburg, Florida, October 19, 2004]]\nOver the course of Bush's first term in office, his extremely high approval ratings immediately following the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]] steadily dwindled, rising only during combat operations in Iraq in spring 2003, and again following the capture of [[Saddam Hussein]] in December that same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hist.umn.edu/~ruggles/Approval.htm |title=Historical Bush Approval Ratings |publisher=Hist.umn.edu |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}</ref>\n\nBetween August and September 2004, there was an intense focus on events that occurred in the late-1960s and early-1970s.

Although in percentage terms it was the closest popular margin ever for a victorious sitting president, Bush received 2.5% more than Kerry. Bush's absolute victory margin (approximately 3 million votes) was the smallest of any sitting president since [[Harry S. Truman]] in [[1948 United States presidential election|1948]].\n* At least 12 million more votes were cast than in the 2000 election. Voter turnout was unusually high. American University's Center for the Study of the American Electorate reported a record turnout of 60.7% of eligible voting-age citizens, 6.4% higher than turnout in the [[2000 United States presidential election|previous election]] and the highest since [[U.S. presidential election, 1968|1968]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.american.edu/ia/cdem/csae/pdfs/csae050114.pdf|format=PDF|title=\"Turnout Exceeds Optimistic Predictions: More Than 122 Million Vote\", Press Release, Center for the Study of the American Electorate, issued January 14, 2005|publisher=Center for the Study of the American Electorate |accessdate=November 11, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081116013357/http://www.american.edu/ia/cdem/csae/pdfs/csae050114.pdf |archive-date=November 16, 2008 }}</ref> Note, however, that the \"eligible\" voting-age electorate is by definition smaller than the total voting-age population.  In a formal report, the Federal Election Commission released a lower figure of 56.70% for the percentage of the electorate that voted for a presidential candidate,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2004/tables.pdf |format=PDF|title=\"2004 Election Results\", FEC formal publication |publisher=fec.gov |accessdate=November 11, 2008}}</ref> based on the latter, larger pool (as calculated by the Census Bureau).\n* Owing to the nation's growing population and large turnout, both Bush and Kerry received more votes than any previous presidential candidate in American history. The previous record was held by Republican [[Ronald Reagan]], who in [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]] received 54.4 million votes.\n* Five states saw every county vote for one candidate: Bush won every county in Utah and Oklahoma while Kerry won every county in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Hawaii.\n* As in 2000, electoral votes split along sharp geographical lines: the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], and most of the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]] for Kerry, and the [[Southern United States|South]], [[Great Plains]], and [[Mountain States]] for Bush. The widespread support for Bush in the Southern states continued the transformation of the formerly Democratic [[Solid South]] to the Republican South.\n* This is the first time a candidate from either party won the presidency without carrying a single Northeastern state.\n* Minor party candidates received many fewer votes, dropping from a total of 3.5% in 2000 to approximately one percent. As in 2000, [[Ralph Nader]] finished in third place, but his total declined from 2.9 million to 400,000 votes, leaving him with fewer votes than [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] candidate [[Pat Buchanan]] had received in finishing fourth in 2000.\n* The 2004 election completed the transition of Illinois from a swing state into a reliably Democratic one. Through the 2000 election both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates campaigned in the state during elections. It went for Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush from 1980\u20131988; Bill Clinton and Al Gore from 1992 to 2000. Both Bush and Gore spent large amounts of time and resources in the state; in 2004 it was not the case.\n* The election marked the first time an incumbent president was returned to office while his political party increased its numbers in both houses of Congress since [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 election]]. It was the first time for a Republican since [[William McKinley]] in the [[1900 United States presidential election|1900 election]]. This did not last for long however, as the Republicans lost control of both chambers of Congress in the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 elections]].\n* Although the election was close, nearly half of U.S. voters lived in a county where Bush or Kerry won by 20 percentage points or more. By comparison, only a quarter lived in such counties in 1976.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bishop |first=Bill |author2=Cushing, Robert  |title=The Big Sort: Migration, Economy and Politics in the United States of 'Those People' |url=http://www.aei.org/docLib/20080229_BillBishop.pdf |date=February 29, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624204202/http://www.aei.org/docLib/20080229_BillBishop.pdf |archive-date=June 24, 2008 }}</ref>\n* Bush became the first president to be elected to two terms without carrying any of these states in either of his campaigns: California, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin. He was also the first Republican to be elected without ever carrying Vermont in either of his campaigns.\n*This is the most recent election in which the Democratic Party nominated a person with military service.\n* As of 2017, this election is the last time that the Republican nominee won Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, or Virginia.\n* This is the first time New Hampshire did not support a Republican who was elected, which happened again in 2016.\n* This is the first time and the only time (as of 2017) New Mexico voted for a Republican since 1988.\n* This was the last time that the Republican nominee won Florida, Ohio and Iowa until 2016.\n* This is the last time that the losing candidate won the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin (as well as Maine's second congressional district).\n* Due to increasing Democratic support in urban regions, this is the last presidential election the Republican candidate won any of the following urban counties/county equivalents:\n**Alabama: [[Jefferson County, Alabama|Jefferson County]]\n**California: [[Fresno County, California|Fresno County]], [[Merced County, California|Merced County]], [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]], [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]], [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin County]], [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]], [[Stanislaus County, California|Stanislaus County]], [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]]\n**Colorado: [[Arapahoe County, Colorado|Arapahoe County]], [[Broomfield, Colorado|Broomfield]], [[Jefferson County, Colorado|Jefferson County]]\n**Florida: [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]], [[Osceola County, Florida|Osceola County]]\n**Georgia: [[Douglas County, Georgia|Douglas County]], [[Rockdale County, Georgia|Rockdale County]], [[Newton County, Georgia|Newton County]]\n**Illinois: [[DeKalb County, Illinois|DeKalb County]], [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]], [[Kane County, Illinois|Kane County]], [[Lake County, Illinois|Lake County]], [[Will County, Illinois|Will County]]\n**Kentucky: [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette County]]\n**Louisiana: [[Caddo Parish, Louisiana|Caddo Parish]], [[East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana|East Baton Rouge Parish]]\n**Minnesota: [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota County]], [[Washington County, Minnesota|Washington County]]\n**Nevada: [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]]\n**New Mexico: [[Sandoval County, New Mexico|Sandoval County]]\n**North Carolina: [[Buncombe County, North Carolina|Buncombe County]], [[Wake County, North Carolina|Wake County]]\n**Ohio: [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]]\n**Oregon: [[Clackamas County, Oregon|Clackamas County]]\n**Pennsylvania: [[Centre County, Pennsylvania|Centre County]], [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin County]]\n**South Carolina: [[Charleston County, South Carolina|Charleston County]]\n**Texas: [[Bexar County, Texas|Bexar County]], [[Cameron County, Texas|Cameron County]], [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]], [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]]\n**Virginia: [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun County]], [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]], [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William County]], [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]]\n**Washington: [[Island County, Washington|Island County]], [[Skagit County, Washington|Skagit County]]\n\n=== Electoral College changes from 2000 ===\nWith the completion of the 2000 census, [[United States Congress|Congressional]] [[United States Congressional Apportionment|reapportionment]] took place, moving some representative districts from the slowest growing states to the fastest growing. As a result, several states had a different number of electors in the [[U.S. Electoral College]] in 2004 than in 2000, since the number of electors allotted to each state is equal to the sum of the number of [[United States Senate|Senators]] and [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] from that state.\n\nThe following table shows the change in electors from the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 election]].  Red states represent those won by [[George W. Bush|Bush]]; and blue states, those won by both [[Al Gore|Gore]] and [[John Kerry|Kerry]]. All states except Nebraska and Maine use a [[First-past-the-post election system|winner-take-all]] allocation of electors. Each of these states was won by the same party in 2004 that had won it in 2000; thus, George W. Bush received a net gain of seven electoral votes due to reapportionment while the Democrats lost the same amount.\n\n{|\n|-\n! Gained votes\n!

These three [[Swing state|swing]] states were seen as evenly divided, and with each casting 20 electoral votes or more, they had the power to decide the election. As the final results came in, Kerry took Pennsylvania and then Bush took Florida, focusing all attention on Ohio.\n\nThe morning after the election, the major candidates were neck and neck. It was clear that the result in Ohio, along with two other states who had still not declared ([[New Mexico]] and [[Iowa]]), would decide the winner. Bush had established a lead of around 130,000 votes but the Democrats pointed to [[provisional ballot]]s that had yet to be counted, initially reported to number as high as 200,000. Bush had preliminary leads of less than 5% of the vote in only four states, but if Iowa, [[Nevada]] and New Mexico had all eventually gone to Kerry, a win for Bush in Ohio would have created a 269\u2013269 tie in the Electoral College. The result of an [[U.S. Electoral College|electoral tie]] would cause the election to be decided in the House of Representatives with each state casting one vote, regardless of population. Such a scenario would almost certainly have resulted in a victory for Bush, as Republicans controlled more House delegations. Therefore, the outcome of the election hinged solely on the result in Ohio, regardless of the final totals elsewhere. In the afternoon of the day after the election, Ohio's Secretary of State, [[Ken Blackwell]], announced that it was statistically impossible for the Democrats to make up enough valid votes in the provisional ballots to win. At the time provisional ballots were reported as numbering 140,000 (and later estimated to be only 135,000). Faced with this announcement, John Kerry conceded defeat.\n\nThe upper Midwest bloc of [[Minnesota]], [[Iowa]], and [[Wisconsin]] is also notable, casting a sum of 27 electoral votes. The following is list of the states considered swing states in the 2004 election by most news organizations and which candidate they eventually went for. The two major parties chose to focus their advertising on these states:\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- valign=top\n| style=\"width:25%;\"|Bush:\n* [[Colorado]]\n* [[Florida]]\n* [[Iowa]]\n* [[New Mexico]]\n* [[Nevada]]\n* [[Ohio]]\n\nKerry:\n* [[Michigan]]\n* [[Minnesota]]\n* [[New Hampshire]]\n* [[Oregon]]\n* [[Pennsylvania]]\n* [[Wisconsin]]\n|}\n\n<gallery perrow=\"4\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"167px\">\nFile:2004 US elections map electoral votes.png|Presidential electoral votes by state.

This recount was completed December 28, 2004, although on January 24, 2007, a jury convicted two Ohio elections officials of selecting precincts to recount where they already knew the hand total would match the machine total, thereby avoiding having to perform a full recount.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/24/AR2007012401441.html | title = Election Staff Convicted in Recount Rig | work = Washington Post | date = January 24, 2007 | first=M.R. | last=Kropko | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt the official counting of the electoral votes on January 6, a motion was made contesting Ohio's electoral votes. Because the motion was supported by at least one member of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, election law mandated that each house retire to debate and vote on the motion. In the House of Representatives, the motion was supported by 31 Democrats. It was opposed by 178 Republicans, 88 Democrats and one independent. Not voting were 52 Republicans and 80 Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml |title=Final Vote Results for Roll Call 7 |publisher=Clerk.house.gov |date=January 6, 2005 |accessdate=May 24, 2010}}</ref>  Four people elected to the House had not yet taken office, and one seat was vacant. In the Senate, it was supported only by its maker, [[Barbara Boxer|Senator Barbara Boxer]], with 74 Senators opposed and 25 not voting. During the debate, no Senator argued that the outcome of the election should be changed by either court challenge or revote. Senator Boxer claimed that she had made the motion not to challenge the outcome, but to \"shed the light of truth on these irregularities.\"\n\nKerry would later state that \"the widespread irregularities make it impossible to know for certain that the [Ohio] outcome reflected the will of the voters.\" In the same article, [[Democratic National Committee]] Chairman [[Howard Dean]] said \"I'm not confident that the election in Ohio was fairly decided... We know that there was substantial voter suppression, and the machines were not reliable. It should not be a surprise that the Republicans are willing to do things that are unethical to manipulate elections.

There was exceptional public interest in the two leading presidential candidates and the issues raised by their respective campaigns, as well as in the election process itself.\"\n\nEarlier, some 13 [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] from the [[US Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] had sent a letter to [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] asking for the UN to monitor the elections. The UN responded that such a request could only come from the official national executive. The move was met with opposition from some Republican lawmakers.<ref>[http://washingtontimes.com/national/20040806-115723-1192r.htm Washington Times] August 6, 2004</ref> The OSCE is not affiliated with the United Nations.\n\n=== Electronic voting ===\n{{further|Electronic voting#Analysis}}\nFor 2004, some states expedited the implementation of [[electronic voting]] systems for the election, raising several issues:\n* '''Software.''' Without proper testing and certification, critics believe [[electronic voting]] machines could produce an incorrect report due to malfunction or deliberate manipulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2004/11/the_problem_wit.html |title=Bruce Schneier: The Problem with Electronic Voting Machines, November 2004 |publisher=Schneier.com |accessdate=May 24, 2010}}</ref>\n* '''Recounts.''' A recount of an electronic voting machine is not a recount in the traditional sense. The machine can be audited for irregularities and voting totals stored on multiple backup devices can be compared, but vote counts will not change.\n* '''Partisan ties.''' Democrats noted the Republican or conservative ties of several leading executives in the companies providing the machines.<ref name=\"Warner\">Warner, Melanie. \"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=technology&res=9804E3DC1339F93AA35752C1A9659C8B63 Machine Politics in the Digital Age.]\" ''[[The New York Times]].'' November 9, 2003.</ref>\n\n=== Campaign law changes ===\nThe 2004 election was the first to be affected by the [[campaign finance reform]]s mandated by the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] of 2002 (also known as the [[John McCain|McCain]]\u2013[[Russ Feingold|Feingold]] Bill for its sponsors in the [[United States Senate]]). Because of the Act's restrictions on candidates' and parties' fundraising, a large number of so-called [[527 group]]s emerged. Named for a section of the [[Internal Revenue Code]], these groups were able to raise large amounts of money for various political causes as long as they do not coordinate their activities with political campaigns. Examples of 527s include [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]], [[MoveOn.org]], the [[Media Fund]], and [[America Coming Together]]. Many such groups were active throughout the campaign season (there was some similar activity, although on a much lesser scale, during the 2000 campaign).\n\nTo distinguish official campaigning from independent campaigning, political advertisements on television were required to include a verbal disclaimer identifying the organization responsible for the advertisement. Advertisements produced by political campaigns usually included the statement, \"I'm ''[candidate's name]'', and I approve this message.\" Advertisements produced by independent organizations usually included the statement, \"[Organization name] is responsible for the content of this advertisement\", and from September 3 (60 days before the general election), such organizations' ads were prohibited from mentioning any candidate by name. Previously, television advertisements only required a written \"paid for by\" disclaimer on the screen.\n\nThis law was not well known or widely publicized at the beginning of the Democratic primary season, which led to some early misperception of Howard Dean, who was the first candidate to buy television advertising in this election cycle. Not realizing that the law required the phrasing, some people viewing the ads reportedly questioned why Dean might say such a thing\u2014such questions were easier to ask because of the maverick nature of Dean's campaign in general.\n\n=== Colorado's Amendment 36 ===\n{{Main article|Colorado Amendment 36}}\nA ballot initiative in [[Colorado]], known as [[Colorado Amendment 36|Amendment 36]], would have changed the way in which the state apportions its electoral votes. Rather than assigning all 9 of the state's electors to the candidate with a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of popular votes, under the amendment Colorado would have assigned presidential electors proportionally to the statewide vote count, which would be a unique system ([[Nebraska]] and [[Maine]] assign electoral votes based on vote totals within each congressional district). Opponents claimed that this splitting would diminish Colorado's influence in the Electoral College, and the amendment ultimately failed, receiving only 34% of the vote.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Timeline of the 2004 United States presidential election]]\n* [[Ralph Nader's presidential campaigns]]\n* [[Jesusland map]]\n* [[Newspaper endorsements in the 2004 United States presidential election]]\n* [[History of the United States (1991\u20132008)]]\n* [[Kerry Fonda 2004 election photo controversy]]\n* [[Killian documents authenticity issues]]\n* [[Second inauguration of George W.

Incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[George W. Bush]] defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[John Kerry]], a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Massachusetts]].\n\nBush and incumbent Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] were renominated by their party with no difficulty. Former Governor [[Howard Dean]] emerged as the early front-runner in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2004|2004 Democratic primaries]], but Kerry won the first set of primaries in January 2004 and clinched his party's nomination in March after a series of primary victories. Kerry chose Senator [[John Edwards]] of [[North Carolina]], who had himself sought the party's 2004 presidential nomination, to be his running mate.\n\nBush's popularity had soared early in his first term after the [[September 11 attacks]], but his popularity declined between 2001 and 2004. [[Foreign policy]] was the dominant theme throughout the election campaign, particularly Bush's conduct of the [[War on Terrorism]] and the aftermath of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Bush presented himself as a decisive leader and attacked Kerry as a [[Flip-flop (politics)|\"flip-flopper\"]], while Kerry criticized Bush's conduct of the [[Iraq War]]. Domestic issues were debated as well, including [[Early 2000s recession|the economy]] and jobs, [[Healthcare in the United States|health care]], [[abortion in the United States|abortion]], [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] and [[embryonic stem cell]] research.\n\nBush won by a slim margin of 50.7% of the popular vote and 286 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]. He swept the [[Southern United States|South]] and the [[Mountain States]] and took the crucial [[swing state]]s of [[2004 United States presidential election in Ohio|Ohio]], [[2004 United States presidential election in Iowa|Iowa]], and [[2004 United States presidential election in New Mexico|New Mexico]], the latter two being flipped Republican. Although Kerry flipped [[2004 United States presidential election in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] compared to the previous election, Bush's electoral map expanded numerically. Some aspects of the election process were subject to [[2004 United States election voting controversies|controversy]], but not to the degree seen in the 2000 presidential election. Bush won [[2004 United States presidential election in Florida|Florida]] by a solid five-point margin, unlike his razor-thin margin of victory there in 2000 that led to a legal challenge in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]''. Bush was the first candidate since [[George H. W. Bush|his father]] in the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 election]] to win over 50% of the popular vote. Bush's victory also marked the first time that a Republican nominee won a presidential election without winning any electoral votes from the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. \n\n== Background ==\n[[George W. Bush]] won the presidency in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]]  after the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' remanded the case to the [[Florida Supreme Court]], which declared there was not sufficient time to hold a recount without violating the [[U.S. Constitution]].\n\nJust eight months into his presidency, the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks]] of September 11, 2001, suddenly transformed Bush into a wartime president. Bush's approval ratings surged to near 90%. Within a month, the forces of a coalition led by the United States [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|entered Afghanistan]], which had been sheltering [[Osama bin Laden]], suspected mastermind of the September 11 attacks. By December, the [[Taliban]] had been removed, although a long and ongoing reconstruction would follow.\n\nThe Bush administration then turned its attention to [[Iraq]], and argued the need to remove [[Saddam Hussein]] from power in Iraq had become urgent. The Iraq issue gave Bush an antagonist to present to the people, (similar but different than that of 2001). Rallying support against a common enemy rather than gaining voters through ideas or policy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Populist Persuasion|last=Kazin|first=Michael|publisher=Cornell University|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Among [[Rationale for the Iraq War|the stated reasons]] were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire [[nuclear material]] and had not properly accounted for [[biological weapons|biological]] and [[chemical weapons|chemical]] material it was known to have previously possessed. Both the possession of these [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate [[Iraq sanctions|the UN sanctions]]. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/05/international/europe/05CND-PARI.html|work=The New York Times|first =John|last=Tagliabue|title=France, Germany and Russia Vow to Stop Use of Force Against Iraq|date=March 5, 2003}}</ref> Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-03-17-inspectors-iraq_x.htm|work=USA Today|title=U.S advises weapons inspectors to leave Iraq|date=March 17, 2003}}</ref> The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a \"[[coalition of the willing]]\" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its [[military of Iraq|armed forces]]. However, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any [[weapon of mass destruction]] in Iraq. Nevertheless, on May 1, George W. Bush landed on the aircraft carrier {{USS|Abraham Lincoln|CVN-72|6}}, in a [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[S-3 Viking]], where he gave [[2003 Mission Accomplished Speech|a speech]] announcing the end of \"major combat operations\" in the [[Iraq War]]. Bush's approval rating in May was at 66%, according to a [[CNN]]\u2013[[USA Today]]\u2013[[Gallup poll|Gallup]] [[opinion poll|poll]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/24/politics/main555427.shtml|title=Bush Jumpstarts '04 Fundraising, Says Collecting Campaign Cash Now Will Keep War On Terror Focused|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=May 24, 2003|accessdate=November 3, 2008}}</ref> However, Bush's high approval ratings did not last. First, while the war itself was popular in the U.S., the reconstruction and attempted \"democratization\" of Iraq lost some support as months passed and casualty figures increased, with no decrease in violence nor progress toward stability or reconstruction. Second, as investigators combed through the country, they failed to find the predicted WMD stockpiles, which led to debate over the rationale for the war.\n\n== Nominations ==\n\n=== Republican nomination ===\n{{Main article|George W.

He accepted the nomination on September 2, 2004, and retained [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] as his [[running mate]]. During the convention and throughout the campaign, Bush focused on two themes: defending America against terrorism and building an [[ownership society]].

His strength as a fund raiser was attributed mainly to his embrace of the Internet for campaigning. The majority of his donations came from individual supporters, who became known as ''Deanites'', or, more commonly, ''[[Deaniacs]]''. Generally regarded as a pragmatic [[centrist]] during his governorship, Dean emerged during his presidential campaign as a left-wing [[populism|populist]], denouncing the policies of the Bush administration (especially the invasion of Iraq) as well as fellow Democrats, who, in his view, failed to strongly oppose them. Senator Lieberman, a liberal on domestic issues but a hawk on the War on Terror, failed to gain traction with liberal Democratic primary voters.\n\nIn September 2003, retired four-star general [[Wesley Clark]] announced his intention to run for the Democratic nomination. His campaign focused on themes of leadership and patriotism; early campaign advertisements relied heavily on biography. His late start left him with relatively few detailed policy proposals. This weakness was apparent in his first few debates, although he soon presented a range of position papers, including a major tax-relief plan. Nevertheless, the Democrats did not flock to support his campaign.\n\nIn sheer numbers, [[John Kerry]] had fewer endorsements than Dean, who was far ahead in the [[superdelegate]] race going into the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2004|Iowa caucuses in January 2004]]. However, Kerry led the endorsement races in Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona, South Carolina, New Mexico, and Nevada. His main perceived weakness was in his neighboring state of New Hampshire and nearly all national polls. Most other states did not have updated polling numbers to give an accurate placing for Kerry's campaign before Iowa. Heading into the primaries, Kerry's campaign was largely seen as being in trouble, particularly after he fired campaign manager [[Jim Jordan (United States politics)|Jim Jordan]]. The key factors enabling it to survive were when fellow [[Massachusetts]] Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] assigned [[Mary Beth Cahill]] to be the new campaign manager, as well as Kerry's [[Mortgage loan|mortgaging]] his home to lend the money to his campaign (while his wife was a billionaire, campaign finance rules prohibited using one's personal fortune). He also brought on the \"magical\" [[Michael Whouley]] who would be credited with helping bring home the Iowa victory the same as he did in New Hampshire for [[Al Gore]] in 2000 against [[Bill Bradley]].\n\n==== Iowa caucus ====\n{{Main|Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2004}}\nBy the January 2004 [[Iowa caucus]]es, the field had dwindled down to nine candidates, as Bob Graham had dropped out of the race. Howard Dean was a strong front-runner. However, the Iowa caucuses yielded unexpectedly strong results for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates Kerry, who earned 38% of the state's delegates, and [[John Edwards]], who took 32%. Dean slipped to 18% and into third place, while [[Richard Gephardt]] finished fourth (11%). In the days leading up to the Iowa vote, there was much negative campaigning between the Dean and Gephardt candidacies.\n\nThe dismal results caused Gephardt to drop out and later endorse Kerry. Carol Moseley Braun also dropped out, endorsing Howard Dean. Besides the impact of coming in third, Dean was further hurt by a speech that he gave while at a post-caucus rally. He was shouting over the cheers of his enthusiastic audience, but the crowd noise was being filtered out by his [[Microphone#Unidirectional|unidirectional microphone]], leaving only his full-throated exhortations audible to the television viewers. To those at home, he seemed to raise his voice out of sheer emotion.\nThe incessant replaying of the \"[[Dean Scream]]\" by the press became a debate on whether Dean was victimized by [[media bias]]. The scream scene was shown approximately 633 times by cable and broadcast news networks in just four days after the incident, an amount not including talk shows and local news broadcasts.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Loyola Phoenix |url=http://www.loyolaphoenix.com/news/2004/02/11/Discourse/The-Scream.That.Left.Us.Blind-603629.shtml |title=The scream that left us blind |date=11 February 2004 |access-date=November 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017051047/http://media.www.loyolaphoenix.com/media/storage/paper673/news/2004/02/11/Discourse/The-Scream.That.Left.Us.Blind-603629.shtml |archive-date=October 17, 2007 }}</ref> However, those in the actual audience that day have insisted that they didn't know about the infamous \"scream\" until they returned to their hotel rooms and saw it on television.<ref name=\"CBS040126\">{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Salzman |publisher=[[CBS News]] |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/26/politics/main596021.shtml |title=Dean's Scream: Not What It Seemed |date=January 26, 2004 |accessdate=November 27, 2006}}</ref>\n\nKerry had revived his campaign and began using the slogan \"Comeback Kerry\".\n\n==== New Hampshire primary ====\nOn January 27, Kerry triumphed again, winning the [[United States presidential election in New Hampshire, 2004#Primaries|New Hampshire primary]]. Dean finished second, Clark came in third, and Edwards placed fourth. The largest of the debates was held at [[Saint Anselm College]], where both Kerry and Dean had strong performances.\n\n==== South Carolina primary ====\n[[File:Kerry02.jpg|thumb|Senator Kerry at a primary rally in St. Louis, Missouri, at the St. Louis Community College \u2013 Forest Park]]\nThe following week, Edwards won the South Carolina primary and brought home a strong second-place finish in [[Oklahoma]] to Clark. Lieberman dropped out of the campaign the following day. Kerry dominated throughout February and his support quickly snowballed as he won caucuses and primaries, taking in wins in [[Michigan]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Maine]], [[Tennessee]]; Washington, D.C.; [[Nevada]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Utah]], Hawaii, and [[Idaho]]. Clark and Dean dropped out during this time, leaving Edwards as the only real threat to Kerry. Kucinich and Sharpton continued to run despite poor results at the polls.\n\n==== Super Tuesday ====\nIn March's [[Super Tuesday]], Kerry won decisive victories in the [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], New York, [[Ohio]], and [[Rhode Island]] primaries as well as in the [[Minnesota]] caucuses. Despite having withdrawn from the race two weeks earlier, Dean won his home state of Vermont. Edwards finished only slightly behind Kerry in Georgia, but after failing to win a single state other than South Carolina, he chose to withdraw from the presidential race. Sharpton followed suit a couple weeks later. Kucinich did not leave the race officially until July.\n\n==== Democratic National Convention ====\nOn July 6, Kerry selected Edwards as his running mate, shortly before the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]] was held later that month in [[Boston]]. Days before Kerry announced Edwards as his running mate, Kerry gave a short list of three candidates: Sen. [[John Edwards]], Rep. [[Dick Gephardt]], and Gov. [[Tom Vilsack]]. Heading into the convention, the Kerry/Edwards ticket unveiled its new slogan: a promise to make America \"stronger at home and more respected in the world.\" Kerry made his [[Vietnam War]] experience the convention's prominent theme. In accepting the nomination, he began his speech with, \"I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty.\" He later delivered what may have been the speech's most memorable line when he said, \"the future doesn't belong to fear, it belongs to freedom\", a quote that later appeared in a Kerry/Edwards television advertisement.\n\nThe keynote address at the convention was delivered by [[Illinois]] State Senator (and future president) [[Barack Obama]]; the speech was well received, and it elevated Obama's status within the Democratic Party.<ref>{{cite news|author=Bernstein, David|date=June 2007|title=The Speech|magazine=Chicago Magazine|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/June-2007/The-Speech|accessdate=April 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Other nominations ===\n[[File:David Cobb on fire.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|[[David Cobb (activist)|David Cobb]] the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] candidate]]\n[[File:SI-MichaelBadnarik1.JPG|right|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] candidate Michael Badnarik]]\n{{See also|List of candidates in the United States presidential election, 2004}}\nThere were four other presidential tickets on the ballot in a number of states totaling enough electoral votes to have a theoretical possibility of winning a majority in the [[U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College]].

W. Bush|his father]] did with [[Michael Dukakis]] in the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 election]]) also sought to portray Kerry as a \"[[Massachusetts liberal]]\", who was out of touch with mainstream Americans. One of Kerry's slogans was \"Stronger at home, respected in the world.\" This advanced the suggestion that Kerry would pay more attention to domestic concerns; it also encapsulated Kerry's contention that Bush had alienated American allies by his foreign policy.\n\nAccording to one exit poll, people who voted for Bush cited the issues of terrorism and traditional values as the most important factors in their decision.<ref name=\"Exitpoll\">{{cite web| title = Decision 2004 \u2013 Exit poll | publisher = [[NBC News]]| url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5297138 | accessdate =June 5, 2008 }}</ref>  Kerry supporters cited the war in Iraq, the economy and jobs, and health care.<ref name=\"Exitpoll\" />\n\n[[File:Bush cropped.jpg|thumb|Bush speaking at campaign rally in St. Petersburg, Florida, October 19, 2004]]\nOver the course of Bush's first term in office, his extremely high approval ratings immediately following the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]] steadily dwindled, rising only during combat operations in Iraq in spring 2003, and again following the capture of [[Saddam Hussein]] in December that same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hist.umn.edu/~ruggles/Approval.htm |title=Historical Bush Approval Ratings |publisher=Hist.umn.edu |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}</ref>\n\nBetween August and September 2004, there was an intense focus on events that occurred in the late-1960s and early-1970s.

Although in percentage terms it was the closest popular margin ever for a victorious sitting president, Bush received 2.5% more than Kerry. Bush's absolute victory margin (approximately 3 million votes) was the smallest of any sitting president since [[Harry S. Truman]] in [[1948 United States presidential election|1948]].\n* At least 12 million more votes were cast than in the 2000 election. Voter turnout was unusually high. American University's Center for the Study of the American Electorate reported a record turnout of 60.7% of eligible voting-age citizens, 6.4% higher than turnout in the [[2000 United States presidential election|previous election]] and the highest since [[U.S. presidential election, 1968|1968]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.american.edu/ia/cdem/csae/pdfs/csae050114.pdf|format=PDF|title=\"Turnout Exceeds Optimistic Predictions: More Than 122 Million Vote\", Press Release, Center for the Study of the American Electorate, issued January 14, 2005|publisher=Center for the Study of the American Electorate |accessdate=November 11, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081116013357/http://www.american.edu/ia/cdem/csae/pdfs/csae050114.pdf |archive-date=November 16, 2008 }}</ref> Note, however, that the \"eligible\" voting-age electorate is by definition smaller than the total voting-age population.  In a formal report, the Federal Election Commission released a lower figure of 56.70% for the percentage of the electorate that voted for a presidential candidate,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2004/tables.pdf |format=PDF|title=\"2004 Election Results\", FEC formal publication |publisher=fec.gov |accessdate=November 11, 2008}}</ref> based on the latter, larger pool (as calculated by the Census Bureau).\n* Owing to the nation's growing population and large turnout, both Bush and Kerry received more votes than any previous presidential candidate in American history. The previous record was held by Republican [[Ronald Reagan]], who in [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]] received 54.4 million votes.\n* Five states saw every county vote for one candidate: Bush won every county in Utah and Oklahoma while Kerry won every county in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Hawaii.\n* As in 2000, electoral votes split along sharp geographical lines: the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], and most of the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]] for Kerry, and the [[Southern United States|South]], [[Great Plains]], and [[Mountain States]] for Bush. The widespread support for Bush in the Southern states continued the transformation of the formerly Democratic [[Solid South]] to the Republican South.\n* This is the first time a candidate from either party won the presidency without carrying a single Northeastern state.\n* Minor party candidates received many fewer votes, dropping from a total of 3.5% in 2000 to approximately one percent. As in 2000, [[Ralph Nader]] finished in third place, but his total declined from 2.9 million to 400,000 votes, leaving him with fewer votes than [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] candidate [[Pat Buchanan]] had received in finishing fourth in 2000.\n* The 2004 election completed the transition of Illinois from a swing state into a reliably Democratic one. Through the 2000 election both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates campaigned in the state during elections. It went for Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush from 1980\u20131988; Bill Clinton and Al Gore from 1992 to 2000. Both Bush and Gore spent large amounts of time and resources in the state; in 2004 it was not the case.\n* The election marked the first time an incumbent president was returned to office while his political party increased its numbers in both houses of Congress since [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 election]]. It was the first time for a Republican since [[William McKinley]] in the [[1900 United States presidential election|1900 election]]. This did not last for long however, as the Republicans lost control of both chambers of Congress in the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 elections]].\n* Although the election was close, nearly half of U.S. voters lived in a county where Bush or Kerry won by 20 percentage points or more. By comparison, only a quarter lived in such counties in 1976.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bishop |first=Bill |author2=Cushing, Robert  |title=The Big Sort: Migration, Economy and Politics in the United States of 'Those People' |url=http://www.aei.org/docLib/20080229_BillBishop.pdf |date=February 29, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624204202/http://www.aei.org/docLib/20080229_BillBishop.pdf |archive-date=June 24, 2008 }}</ref>\n* Bush became the first president to be elected to two terms without carrying any of these states in either of his campaigns: California, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin. He was also the first Republican to be elected without ever carrying Vermont in either of his campaigns.\n*This is the most recent election in which the Democratic Party nominated a person with military service.\n* As of 2017, this election is the last time that the Republican nominee won Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, or Virginia.\n* This is the first time New Hampshire did not support a Republican who was elected, which happened again in 2016.\n* This is the first time and the only time (as of 2017) New Mexico voted for a Republican since 1988.\n* This was the last time that the Republican nominee won Florida, Ohio and Iowa until 2016.\n* This is the last time that the losing candidate won the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin (as well as Maine's second congressional district).\n* Due to increasing Democratic support in urban regions, this is the last presidential election the Republican candidate won any of the following urban counties/county equivalents:\n**Alabama: [[Jefferson County, Alabama|Jefferson County]]\n**California: [[Fresno County, California|Fresno County]], [[Merced County, California|Merced County]], [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]], [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]], [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin County]], [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]], [[Stanislaus County, California|Stanislaus County]], [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]]\n**Colorado: [[Arapahoe County, Colorado|Arapahoe County]], [[Broomfield, Colorado|Broomfield]], [[Jefferson County, Colorado|Jefferson County]]\n**Florida: [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]], [[Osceola County, Florida|Osceola County]]\n**Georgia: [[Douglas County, Georgia|Douglas County]], [[Rockdale County, Georgia|Rockdale County]], [[Newton County, Georgia|Newton County]]\n**Illinois: [[DeKalb County, Illinois|DeKalb County]], [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]], [[Kane County, Illinois|Kane County]], [[Lake County, Illinois|Lake County]], [[Will County, Illinois|Will County]]\n**Kentucky: [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette County]]\n**Louisiana: [[Caddo Parish, Louisiana|Caddo Parish]], [[East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana|East Baton Rouge Parish]]\n**Minnesota: [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota County]], [[Washington County, Minnesota|Washington County]]\n**Nevada: [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]]\n**New Mexico: [[Sandoval County, New Mexico|Sandoval County]]\n**North Carolina: [[Buncombe County, North Carolina|Buncombe County]], [[Wake County, North Carolina|Wake County]]\n**Ohio: [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]]\n**Oregon: [[Clackamas County, Oregon|Clackamas County]]\n**Pennsylvania: [[Centre County, Pennsylvania|Centre County]], [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin County]]\n**South Carolina: [[Charleston County, South Carolina|Charleston County]]\n**Texas: [[Bexar County, Texas|Bexar County]], [[Cameron County, Texas|Cameron County]], [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]], [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]]\n**Virginia: [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun County]], [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]], [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William County]], [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]]\n**Washington: [[Island County, Washington|Island County]], [[Skagit County, Washington|Skagit County]]\n\n=== Electoral College changes from 2000 ===\nWith the completion of the 2000 census, [[United States Congress|Congressional]] [[United States Congressional Apportionment|reapportionment]] took place, moving some representative districts from the slowest growing states to the fastest growing. As a result, several states had a different number of electors in the [[U.S. Electoral College]] in 2004 than in 2000, since the number of electors allotted to each state is equal to the sum of the number of [[United States Senate|Senators]] and [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] from that state.\n\nThe following table shows the change in electors from the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 election]].  Red states represent those won by [[George W. Bush|Bush]]; and blue states, those won by both [[Al Gore|Gore]] and [[John Kerry|Kerry]]. All states except Nebraska and Maine use a [[First-past-the-post election system|winner-take-all]] allocation of electors. Each of these states was won by the same party in 2004 that had won it in 2000; thus, George W. Bush received a net gain of seven electoral votes due to reapportionment while the Democrats lost the same amount.\n\n{|\n|-\n! Gained votes\n!

As the final results came in, Kerry took Pennsylvania and then Bush took Florida, focusing all attention on Ohio.\n\nThe morning after the election, the major candidates were neck and neck. It was clear that the result in Ohio, along with two other states who had still not declared ([[New Mexico]] and [[Iowa]]), would decide the winner. Bush had established a lead of around 130,000 votes but the Democrats pointed to [[provisional ballot]]s that had yet to be counted, initially reported to number as high as 200,000. Bush had preliminary leads of less than 5% of the vote in only four states, but if Iowa, [[Nevada]] and New Mexico had all eventually gone to Kerry, a win for Bush in Ohio would have created a 269\u2013269 tie in the Electoral College. The result of an [[U.S. Electoral College|electoral tie]] would cause the election to be decided in the House of Representatives with each state casting one vote, regardless of population. Such a scenario would almost certainly have resulted in a victory for Bush, as Republicans controlled more House delegations. Therefore, the outcome of the election hinged solely on the result in Ohio, regardless of the final totals elsewhere. In the afternoon of the day after the election, Ohio's Secretary of State, [[Ken Blackwell]], announced that it was statistically impossible for the Democrats to make up enough valid votes in the provisional ballots to win. At the time provisional ballots were reported as numbering 140,000 (and later estimated to be only 135,000). Faced with this announcement, John Kerry conceded defeat.\n\nThe upper Midwest bloc of [[Minnesota]], [[Iowa]], and [[Wisconsin]] is also notable, casting a sum of 27 electoral votes. The following is list of the states considered swing states in the 2004 election by most news organizations and which candidate they eventually went for. The two major parties chose to focus their advertising on these states:\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- valign=top\n| style=\"width:25%;\"|Bush:\n* [[Colorado]]\n* [[Florida]]\n* [[Iowa]]\n* [[New Mexico]]\n* [[Nevada]]\n* [[Ohio]]\n\nKerry:\n* [[Michigan]]\n* [[Minnesota]]\n* [[New Hampshire]]\n* [[Oregon]]\n* [[Pennsylvania]]\n* [[Wisconsin]]\n|}\n\n<gallery perrow=\"4\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"167px\">\nFile:2004 US elections map electoral votes.png|Presidential electoral votes by state.

This recount was completed December 28, 2004, although on January 24, 2007, a jury convicted two Ohio elections officials of selecting precincts to recount where they already knew the hand total would match the machine total, thereby avoiding having to perform a full recount.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/24/AR2007012401441.html | title = Election Staff Convicted in Recount Rig | work = Washington Post | date = January 24, 2007 | first=M.R. | last=Kropko | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt the official counting of the electoral votes on January 6, a motion was made contesting Ohio's electoral votes. Because the motion was supported by at least one member of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, election law mandated that each house retire to debate and vote on the motion. In the House of Representatives, the motion was supported by 31 Democrats. It was opposed by 178 Republicans, 88 Democrats and one independent. Not voting were 52 Republicans and 80 Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml |title=Final Vote Results for Roll Call 7 |publisher=Clerk.house.gov |date=January 6, 2005 |accessdate=May 24, 2010}}</ref>  Four people elected to the House had not yet taken office, and one seat was vacant.

During the debate, no Senator argued that the outcome of the election should be changed by either court challenge or revote. Senator Boxer claimed that she had made the motion not to challenge the outcome, but to \"shed the light of truth on these irregularities.\"\n\nKerry would later state that \"the widespread irregularities make it impossible to know for certain that the [Ohio] outcome reflected the will of the voters.\" In the same article, [[Democratic National Committee]] Chairman [[Howard Dean]] said \"I'm not confident that the election in Ohio was fairly decided...

November 9, 2003.</ref>\n\n=== Campaign law changes ===\nThe 2004 election was the first to be affected by the [[campaign finance reform]]s mandated by the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] of 2002 (also known as the [[John McCain|McCain]]\u2013[[Russ Feingold|Feingold]] Bill for its sponsors in the [[United States Senate]]). Because of the Act's restrictions on candidates' and parties' fundraising, a large number of so-called [[527 group]]s emerged. Named for a section of the [[Internal Revenue Code]], these groups were able to raise large amounts of money for various political causes as long as they do not coordinate their activities with political campaigns. Examples of 527s include [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]], [[MoveOn.org]], the [[Media Fund]], and [[America Coming Together]]. Many such groups were active throughout the campaign season (there was some similar activity, although on a much lesser scale, during the 2000 campaign).\n\nTo distinguish official campaigning from independent campaigning, political advertisements on television were required to include a verbal disclaimer identifying the organization responsible for the advertisement. Advertisements produced by political campaigns usually included the statement, \"I'm ''[candidate's name]'', and I approve this message.\" Advertisements produced by independent organizations usually included the statement, \"[Organization name] is responsible for the content of this advertisement\", and from September 3 (60 days before the general election), such organizations' ads were prohibited from mentioning any candidate by name. Previously, television advertisements only required a written \"paid for by\" disclaimer on the screen.\n\nThis law was not well known or widely publicized at the beginning of the Democratic primary season, which led to some early misperception of Howard Dean, who was the first candidate to buy television advertising in this election cycle. Not realizing that the law required the phrasing, some people viewing the ads reportedly questioned why Dean might say such a thing\u2014such questions were easier to ask because of the maverick nature of Dean's campaign in general.\n\n=== Colorado's Amendment 36 ===\n{{Main article|Colorado Amendment 36}}\nA ballot initiative in [[Colorado]], known as [[Colorado Amendment 36|Amendment 36]], would have changed the way in which the state apportions its electoral votes. Rather than assigning all 9 of the state's electors to the candidate with a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of popular votes, under the amendment Colorado would have assigned presidential electors proportionally to the statewide vote count, which would be a unique system ([[Nebraska]] and [[Maine]] assign electoral votes based on vote totals within each congressional district). Opponents claimed that this splitting would diminish Colorado's influence in the Electoral College, and the amendment ultimately failed, receiving only 34% of the vote.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Timeline of the 2004 United States presidential election]]\n* [[Ralph Nader's presidential campaigns]]\n* [[Jesusland map]]\n* [[Newspaper endorsements in the 2004 United States presidential election]]\n* [[History of the United States (1991\u20132008)]]\n* [[Kerry Fonda 2004 election photo controversy]]\n* [[Killian documents authenticity issues]]\n* [[Second inauguration of George W.

''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'' {{ISBN|0-304-35273-X}}; p. 17.</ref> The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary [[shell (projectile)|shells]]. The first ironclad battleship, {{ship|French ironclad|Gloire||2}}, was launched by the [[French Navy]] in November 1859.<ref>Sondhaus, Lawrence. ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' {{ISBN|0-415-21478-5}}, pp. 73\u20134.</ref> The British [[Admiralty]] had been considering armored warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an armored [[corvette]] in 1857; in early 1859 the [[Royal Navy]] started building two iron-hulled armored frigates, and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all-armored battle fleet. After the [[Battle of Hampton Roads|first clashes of ironclads]] (both with wooden ships and with one another) took place in 1862 during the [[American Civil War]], it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored [[ship of the line]] as the most powerful warship afloat. This type of ship would come to be very successful in the American Civil War.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 86.</ref>\n\nIronclads were designed for several roles, including as high seas [[battleship]]s, [[Littoral (military)|coastal]] defense ships, and long-range [[cruiser]]s. The rapid development of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden-hulled vessel that carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel-built, turreted battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century. This change was pushed forward by the development of heavier naval guns (the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea at the time), more sophisticated steam engines, and [[History of ferrous metallurgy|advances in metallurgy]] which made steel shipbuilding possible.\n\nThe quick pace of change meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were finished, and that naval tactics were in a state of flux. Many ironclads were built to make use of the [[naval ram|ram]] or the [[torpedo]], which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat. There is no clear end to the ironclad period, but towards the end of the 1890s the term ''ironclad'' dropped out of use. New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or [[armored cruiser]]s.\n\n== Ironclad ==\nThe ironclad became technically feasible and tactically necessary because of developments in shipbuilding in the first half of the 19th century. According to naval historian [[J. Richard Hill]]: \"The (ironclad) had three chief characteristics: a metal-skinned hull, steam propulsion and a main armament of guns capable of firing explosive shells. It is only when all three characteristics are present that a fighting ship can properly be called an ironclad.\"<ref name=\"Hill\">Hill, ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'' p. 17.</ref> Each of these developments was introduced separately in the decade before the first ironclads.\n\n=== Steam propulsion ===\n[[File:Napoleon(1850).jpg|thumb|{{ship|French ship|Napol\u00e9on|1850|3}}, the first steam battleship]]\nIn the 18th and early 19th centuries fleets had relied on two types of major warship, the [[ship of the line]] and the [[frigate]]. The first major change to these types was the introduction of [[steam power]] for [[Marine propulsion|propulsion]]. While [[paddle steamer]] warships had been used from the 1830s onwards, steam propulsion only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the [[screw propeller]] in the 1840s.<ref name = \"Screw\">Lambert, A. \"The Screw Propellor Warship\", in Gardiner ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire'' pp. 30\u201344.</ref>\n\nSteam-powered screw frigates were built in the mid-1840s, and at the end of the decade the [[French Navy]] introduced steam power to its [[line of battle]]. The desire for change came from the ambition of [[Napoleon III]] to gain greater influence in Europe, which required a challenge to the British at sea.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 37\u201341.</ref><ref name = \"Hill 25\">Hill, ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'' p. 25.</ref> The first purpose-built steam battleship was the 90-gun {{ship|French ship|Napol\u00e9on|1850|2}} in 1850.<ref name = \"Screw\"/>  ''Napol\u00e9on'' was armed as a conventional ship-of-the-line, but her steam engines could give her a speed of 12 knots (22&nbsp;km/h), regardless of the wind conditions: a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement.\n\nThe introduction of the steam ship-of-the-line led to a building competition between France and Britain. Eight sister ships to ''Napol\u00e9on'' were built in France over a period of ten years, but the United Kingdom soon managed to take the lead in production. Altogether, France built ten new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 from older ships of the line, while the United Kingdom built 18 and converted 41.<ref name = \"Screw\"/>\n\n=== Explosive shells ===\n{{further|Paixhans gun}}\n[[File:PaixhansCanonImage.jpg|thumb|A [[Paixhans gun|Paixhans]] naval [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] gun. 1860 engraving.]]\nThe era of the wooden steam ship-of-the-line was brief, because of new, more powerful naval guns. In the 1820s and 1830s, warships began to mount increasingly heavy guns, replacing [[18-pounder long gun|18-]] and [[24-pounder long gun|24-pounder guns]] with 32-pounders on sailing ships-of-the-line and introducing [[68-pounder]]s on steamers. Then, the first [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the French G\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[Henri-Joseph Paixhans]], and by the 1840s were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the [[French Navy]], [[Royal Navy]], [[Imperial Russian Navy]] and [[United States Navy]]. It is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls, as demonstrated by the Russian destruction of an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] squadron at the [[Battle of Sinop]], spelled the end of the wooden-hulled warship.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 58.</ref> The more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red-hot shot, which could lodge in the hull of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion.  Some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power.<ref name = \"Lambert\">Lambert, A.

There followed, also from Laird, the first full-blown warships with metal hulls, the 1842 steam frigates ''Guadalupe'' and ''Moctezuma'' for the Mexican navy.<ref name=\"Sandler 2004\">{{cite book |last1=Sandler |first1=Stanley |title=Battleships: An Illustrated History of Their Impact |date=2004 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=1851094105 |page=20}}</ref><ref name=\"threedecks\">{{cite web |title=Mexican paddle steamer 'Guadalupe' (1842) |url=https://threedecks.org/index.php?display_type=show_ship&id=11583 |website=threedecks.org |accessdate=6 August 2018}}</ref> But a thin iron skin, while not being susceptible to fire or lethal splintering like wood, was not the same thing as providing iron ''armor'' calculated to stop enemy gunfire.\n\nIn 1843, the United States Navy launched its first iron warship, [[USS Michigan (1843)|USS ''Michigan'']], on the Great Lakes. This pioneering iron-hulled, steam-powered ship served for 70 years in the relatively peaceful region.\n\nFollowing the demonstration of the power of explosive shells against wooden ships at the [[Battle of Sinop]], and fearing that his own ships would be vulnerable to the [[Paixhans guns]] of Russian fortifications in the [[Crimean War]], Emperor [[Napoleon III]] ordered the development of light-draft floating batteries, equipped with heavy guns and protected by heavy armor.<ref name=Baxter70>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rR95Mi7vVHoC&pg=PA82&dq=Lave+Tonnante+D%C3%A9vastation#PPA70,M1 Baxter, ''The Introduction of the Ironclad Warship'', p70]</ref> Experiments made during the first half of 1854 proved highly satisfactory, and on 17 July 1854, the French communicated to the British Government that a solution had been found to make gun-proof vessels and that plans would be communicated.<ref name=Baxter72>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rR95Mi7vVHoC&pg=PA82&dq=Lave+Tonnante+D%C3%A9vastation#PPA72,M1 Baxter, ''The Introduction of the Ironclad Warship'', p72]</ref> After tests in September 1854, the British Admiralty agreed to build five armored floating batteries on the French plans,<ref name=Baxter72/> establishing the important [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company|Thames]] and [[Millwall Iron Works]] within the docks.\n\n\nThe French [[floating battery|floating batteries]] were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the [[Crimean War]]. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries (''Lave'', ''Tonnante'' and ''D\u00e9vastation'') in 1855 against the defenses at the [[Battle of Kinburn (1855)|Battle of Kinburn]] on the [[Black Sea]], where they were effective against Russian shore defences.

The result was the first ocean-going ironclad, {{ship|French ironclad|Gloire||2}}, begun in 1857 and launched in 1859.<ref name=\"Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 73\u20134\">Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 73\u20134.</ref>\n\n''Gloire''{{'}}s wooden hull was modelled on that of a steam ship of the line, reduced to one deck, sheathed in iron plates 4.5&nbsp;inches (110&nbsp;mm) thick. She was propelled by a steam engine, driving a single screw propeller for a speed of 13 knots (24&nbsp;km/h). She was armed with thirty-six {{convert|6.4|in|mm|adj=on}} rifled guns. France proceeded to construct 16 ironclad warships, including two more sister ships to ''Gloire'', and the only two-decked broadside ironclads ever built, {{ship|French ironclad|Magenta||2}} and {{ship|French ironclad|Solf\u00e9rino||2}}.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 74.</ref>\n\n[[File:HMSWarrior.JPG|thumb|left|{{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}} (1860), Britain's first seagoing ironclad warship]]\n\nThe Royal Navy had not been keen to sacrifice its advantage in steam ships of the line, but was determined that the first British ironclad would outmatch the French ships in every respect, particularly speed. A fast ship would have the advantage of being able to choose a range of engagement which could make her invulnerable to enemy fire. The British specification was more a large, powerful [[frigate]] than a ship-of-the-line. The requirement for speed meant a very long vessel, which had to be built from iron. The result was the construction of two {{sclass-|Warrior|ironclad|2}}s; {{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}} and {{HMS|Black Prince|1861|6}}. The ships had a successful design, though there were necessarily compromises between 'sea-keeping', strategic range and armor protection; their weapons were more effective than those of ''Gloire'', and with the largest set of steam engines yet fitted to a ship they could steam at 14.3&nbsp;knots (26.5&nbsp;km/h).<ref name = \"Iron\"/> Yet the ''Gloire'' and her sisters had full iron-armor protection along the waterline and the battery itself.  ''Warrior'' and ''Black Prince'' (but also the smaller [[HMS Defence (1861)|''Defence'']] and [[HMS Resistance (1861)|''Resistance'']]) were obliged to concentrate their armor in a central \"citadel\" or \"armoured box\", leaving many main deck guns and the fore and aft sections of the vessel unprotected.  The use of iron in the construction of ''Warrior ''also came with some drawbacks; iron hulls required more regular and intensive repairs than wooden hulls, and iron was more susceptible to fouling by marine life.\n\nBy 1862, navies across Europe had adopted ironclads. Britain and France each had sixteen either completed or under construction, though the British vessels were larger. Austria, Italy, Russia, and Spain were also building ironclads.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 76.</ref> However, the first battles using the new ironclad ships involved neither Britain nor France, and involved ships markedly different from the broadside-firing, masted designs of ''Gloire'' and ''Warrior''. The use of ironclads by both sides in the American Civil War, and the clash of the Italian and Austrian fleets at the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]], had an important influence on the development of ironclad design.\n\n=== First battles between ironclads: the U.S. Civil War ===\n[[File:Monitor officers2.jpg|right|thumb|<center>Officers of a monitor-class warship, probably {{USS|Patapsco|1862|6}}, photographed during the [[American Civil War]].</center>]][[File:Ironclads off Cairo, Illinois.jpg|right|thumb|<center>United States Navy ironclads off [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]], [[Illinois]], during the [[American Civil War]].</center>]]The first use of ironclads in action came in the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]]. The U.S. Navy at the time the war broke out had no ironclads, its most powerful ships being six unarmored steam-powered frigates.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 77.</ref> Since the bulk of the Navy remained loyal to the Union, the Confederacy sought to gain advantage in the naval conflict by acquiring modern armored ships. In May 1861, the Confederate Congress appropriated $2&nbsp;million for the purchase of ironclads from overseas, and in July and August 1861 the Confederacy started work on construction and converting wooden ships.<ref name = \"ACW\">Still, William \"The American Civil War\" in Gardiner ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire''.</ref>\n\nOn 12 October 1861, {{ship|CSS|Manassas}} became the first ironclad to enter combat, when she fought Union warships on the Mississippi during the [[Battle of the Head of Passes]]. She had been converted from a commercial vessel in New Orleans for river and coastal fighting. In February 1862, the larger {{ship|CSS|Virginia}} joined the Confederate Navy, having been rebuilt at [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard|Norfolk]]. Constructed on the hull of {{USS|Merrimack|1855|6}}, ''Virginia'' originally was a conventional warship made of wood, but she was converted into an iron-covered [[casemate ironclad]] gunship, when she entered the [[Confederate Navy]]. By this time, the Union had completed seven ironclad gunboats of the {{sclass2-|City|ironclad|4}}, and was about to complete {{USS|Monitor}}, an innovative design proposed by the Swedish inventor [[John Ericsson]]. The Union was also building a large armored frigate, {{USS|New Ironsides}}, and the smaller {{USS|Galena|1862|6}}.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 78.</ref>\n\nThe first battle between ironclads happened on 9 March 1862, as the armored ''Monitor'' was deployed to protect the Union's wooden fleet from the ironclad ram ''Virginia'' and other Confederate warships.<ref>Preston, pp. 12\u20134.</ref> In this engagement, the second day of the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]], the two ironclads repeatedly tried to ram one another while shells bounced off their armor.  The battle attracted attention worldwide, making it clear that the wooden warship was now out of date, with the ironclads destroying them easily.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 78\u201381.</ref>\n\nThe Civil War saw more ironclads built by both sides, and they played an increasing role in the naval war alongside the unarmored warships, commerce raiders and blockade runners. The Union built a large fleet of fifty [[monitor (warship)|monitors]] modeled on their namesake.  The Confederacy built ships designed as smaller versions of ''Virginia'', many of which saw action,<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 82.</ref> but their attempts to buy ironclads overseas were frustrated as European nations confiscated ships being built for the Confederacy&nbsp;\u2013 especially in Russia, the only country to openly support the Union through the war. Only [[Japanese ironclad K\u014dtetsu|CSS ''Stonewall'']] was completed, and she arrived in American waters just in time for the end of the war.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 85.</ref>\n\nThrough the remainder of the war, ironclads saw action in the Union's attacks on Confederate ports.  Seven Union monitors, including {{USS|Montauk|1862|6}}, as well as two other ironclads, the ironclad frigate ''New Ironsides'' and a light-draft {{USS|Keokuk|1862|6}}, participated in the failed [[First Battle of Charleston Harbor|attack on Charleston]]; one was sunk. Two small ironclads, {{ship|CSS|Palmetto State}} and {{ship|CSS|Chicora}} participated in the defence of the harbor. For the later attack at [[Battle of Mobile Bay|Mobile Bay]], the Union assembled four monitors as well as 11 wooden ships, facing the {{ship|CSS|Tennessee|1863|6}}, the Confederacy's most powerful ironclad and the gunboats {{ship|CSS|Morgan}}, {{ship|CSS|Gaines}}, {{ship|CSS|Selma|1856|6}}.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 81.</ref>\n\nOn the western front, the Union built a formidable force of river ironclads, beginning with several converted riverboats and then contracting engineer [[James Eads]] of [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] to build the City-class ironclads. These excellent ships were built with twin engines and a central paddle wheel, all protected by an armored casement. They had a shallow draft, allowing them to journey up smaller tributaries, and were very well suited for river operations. Eads also produced monitors for use on the rivers, the first two of which differed from the ocean-going monitors in that they contained a paddle wheel ({{USS|Neosho|1863|6}} and {{USS|Osage|1863|6}}). [[File:Uss Cairo h61568.jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|Cairo}}, an example of a City-class ironclad gunboat]]\n\nThe Union ironclads played an important role in the Mississippi and tributaries by providing tremendous fire upon Confederate forts, installations and vessels with relative impunity to enemy fire.  They were not as heavily armored as the ocean-going monitors of the Union, but they were adequate for their intended use.  More Western Flotilla Union ironclads were sunk by [[torpedo (mine)|torpedoes (mines)]] than by enemy fire, and the most damaging fire for the Union ironclads was from shore installations, not Confederate vessels.<ref>Angus Konstam, (2002), ''Union River Ironclad 1861\u201365'', Osprey Publishing, New Vanguard 56, {{ISBN|978-1-84176-444-3}}</ref>\n\n=== Lissa: First fleet battle ===\n[[File:Battle of Lissa - 1866 - Initial Situation.svg|thumb|The fleets engaging for the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]]]]\nThe first fleet battle, and the first ocean battle, involving ironclad warships was the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]] in 1866. Waged between the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] and [[Regia Marina|Italian]] navies, the battle pitted combined fleets of wooden [[frigate]]s and [[corvette]]s and ironclad warships on both sides in the largest naval battle between the battles of [[Battle of Navarino|Navarino]] and [[Battle of Tsushima|Tsushima]].<ref name=\"Sondhaus\">Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 94\u20136.</ref>\n\nThe Italian fleet consisted of 12 ironclads and a similar number of wooden warships, escorting transports which carried troops intending to land on the Adriatic island of Lissa.  Among the Italian ironclads were seven broadside ironclad frigates, four smaller ironclads, and the newly built {{ship|Italian ironclad|Affondatore||2}}&nbsp;\u2013 a double-turreted ram. Opposing them, the Austrian navy had seven ironclad frigates.<ref name=\"Sondhaus\"/>\n\nThe Austrians believed their ships to have less effective guns than their enemy, so decided to engage the Italians at close range and ram them. The Austrian fleet formed into an arrowhead formation with the ironclads in the first line, charging at the Italian ironclad squadron. In the mel\u00e9e which followed both sides were frustrated by the lack of damage inflicted by guns, and by the difficulty of ramming\u2014nonetheless, the effective ramming attack being made by the Austrian flagship against the Italian attracted great attention in following years.<ref name=\"Sondhaus\"/>\n\nThe superior Italian fleet lost its two ironclads, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re d'Italia||2}} and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Palestro||2}}, while the Austrian unarmored screw two-decker {{SMS|Kaiser|1858|6}} remarkably survived close actions with four Italian ironclads. The battle ensured the popularity of the ram as a weapon in European ironclads for many years, and the victory won by Austria established it as the predominant naval power in the [[Adriatic]].<ref name=\"Sondhaus\"/>\n\nThe battles of the American Civil War and at Lissa were very influential on the designs and tactics of the ironclad fleets that followed. In particular, it taught a generation of naval officers the lesson that ramming was the best way to sink enemy ironclads.\n\n== Armament and tactics ==\nThe adoption of iron armor meant that the traditional naval armament of dozens of light cannon became useless, since their shot would bounce off an armored hull.  To penetrate armor, increasingly heavy guns were mounted on ships; nevertheless, the view that [[naval ram|ramming]] was the only way to sink an ironclad became widespread. The increasing size and weight of guns also meant a movement away from the ships mounting many guns broadside, in the manner of a ship-of-the-line, towards a handful of guns in turrets for all-round fire.\n\n=== Ram craze ===\n[[File:Punch - Over-Weighted.png|thumb|''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon from May 1876 showing [[Britannia]] dressed in the armor of an ironclad with the word ''Inflexible'' around her collar and addressing the sea god Neptune. Note the ram sticking out of Britannia's breast plate.  The caption reads: OVER-WEIGHTED. Britannia. \"Look here, Father Nep!  I can't stand it much longer!  Who's to 'rule the waves' in ''this'' sort of thing?\"]] From the 1860s to the 1880s many naval designers believed that the development of the ironclad meant that the [[naval ram|ram]] was again the most important weapon in naval warfare. With steam power freeing ships from the wind, and armor making them invulnerable to shellfire, the ram seemed to offer the opportunity to strike a decisive blow.\n\nThe scant damage inflicted by the guns of ''Monitor'' and ''Virginia'' at [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] and the spectacular but lucky success of the Austrian flagship [[SMS Erzherzog Ferdinand Max (1865)|SMS ''Erzherzog Ferdinand Max'']] sinking the Italian [[Italian ironclad Re d'Italia|''Re d'Italia'']] at [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Lissa]] gave strength to the ramming craze.<ref>Hill, ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'' p. 35.</ref> From the early 1870s to early 1880s most British naval officers thought that guns were about to be replaced as the main naval armament by the ram.  Those who noted the tiny number of ships that had actually been sunk by ramming struggled to be heard.<ref name = \"Beeler\">Beeler, J. ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design, 1870\u20131881''. London, Caxton, 2003. {{ISBN|1-84067-534-9}} pp. 106\u20137.</ref>\n\nThe revival of ramming had a significant effect on naval tactics. Since the 17th century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the [[line of battle]], where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its [[broadside]] guns. This tactic was totally unsuited to ramming, and the ram threw fleet tactics into disarray. The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle, and if it had been, combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' p. 107.</ref>\n\nThe ram finally fell out of favour in the 1880s, as the same effect could be achieved with a [[torpedo]], with less vulnerability to quick-firing guns.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' p. 146.</ref>\n\n=== Development of naval guns ===\nThe armament of ironclads tended to become concentrated in a small number of powerful guns capable of penetrating the armor of enemy ships at range; [[caliber|calibre]] and weight of guns increased markedly to achieve greater penetration. Throughout the ironclad era navies also grappled with the complexities of [[rifling|rifled]] versus [[smoothbore]] guns and [[breech-loading]] versus [[muzzle-loading]].\n[[File:HMS Warrior 110lb BL.png|thumb|left|upright|Breech-loading 110-pounder [[Armstrong gun]] on {{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}}]]\n\n{{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}} carried a mixture of [[RBL 7 inch Armstrong gun|110-pounder 7&nbsp;inch (180&nbsp;mm) breech-loading rifles]] and more traditional [[68-pounder]] smoothbore guns. ''Warrior'' highlighted the challenges of picking the right armament; the breech-loaders she carried, designed by [[William George Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|Sir William Armstrong]], were intended to be the next generation of heavy armament for the Royal Navy, but were shortly withdrawn from service.<ref name=\"Beeler-71\">Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' p. 71.</ref>\n\nBreech-loading guns seemed to offer important advantages. A breech-loader could be reloaded without moving the gun, a lengthy process particularly if the gun then needed to be re-aimed. ''Warrior''{{'}}s [[Armstrong gun]]s also had the virtue of being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore and, because of their rifling, more accurate.<ref name=\"Beeler-71\"/> Nonetheless, the design was rejected because of problems which plagued breech-loaders for decades.\n\nThe weakness of the breech-loader was the obvious problem of sealing the breech. All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of a solid [[propellant]] into gas. This explosion propels the shot or shell out of the front of the gun, but also imposes great stresses on the gun-barrel. If the breech\u2014which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun\u2014is not entirely secure, then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break. This in turn reduces the [[muzzle velocity]] of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew. ''Warrior''{{'}}s Armstrong guns suffered from both problems; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4.5&nbsp;in (118&nbsp;mm) armor of ''Gloire'', while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing. Similar problems were experienced with the breech-loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp. 72\u20133.</ref>\n\nThese problems influenced the British to equip ships with muzzle-loading weapons of increasing power until the 1880s. After a brief introduction of 100-pounder or 9.5-inch (240&nbsp;mm) smoothbore Somerset Gun, which weighed 6.5&nbsp;[[long ton|tons]] (6.6 t), the Admiralty introduced 7-inch (178&nbsp;mm) rifled guns, weighing 7&nbsp;tons. These were followed by a series of increasingly mammoth weapons\u2014guns weighing 12, 25, 25, 38 and finally 81&nbsp;tons, with [[caliber|calibre]] increasing from 8-inch (203&nbsp;mm) to 16-inch (406&nbsp;mm).\n\nThe decision to retain muzzle-loaders until the 1880s has been criticised by historians. However, at least until the late 1870s, the British muzzle-loaders had superior performance in terms of both range and rate of fire than the French and Prussian breech-loaders, which suffered from the same problems as had the first Armstrong guns.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp. 73\u20135.</ref>\n[[File:Duilio 1880 003.jpg|thumb|right|Reloading the muzzle-loading guns of {{ship|Italian ironclad|Caio Duilio||2}}]]\n\n[[File:Culasse systeme De Bange before 1923.jpg|thumb|The [[Obturating ring|obturator]] invented by [[Charles Ragon de Bange]] allowed the effective sealing of breeches in breech-loading guns.]]\nFrom 1875 onwards, the balance between breech- and muzzle-loading changed. Captain [[Val\u00e9rand de Bange|de Bange]] invented a method of reliably sealing a breech, adopted by the French in 1873. Just as compellingly, the growing size of naval guns made muzzle-loading much more complicated. With guns of such size there was no prospect of hauling in the gun for re-loading, or even re-loading by hand, and complicated hydraulic systems were required for re-loading the gun outside the turret without exposing the crew to enemy fire. In 1882, the 81-ton, 16-inch (406&nbsp;mm) guns of {{HMS|Inflexible|1876|6}} fired only once every 11&nbsp;minutes while bombarding [[Alexandria]] during the [[Urabi Revolt]].<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp.77\u20138</ref> The 100-ton, 450&nbsp;mm (17.72&nbsp;inch) guns of {{ship|Italian ironclad|Caio Duilio||2}} could each fire a round every 15 minutes.<ref>Brown, D.K. ''The Era of Uncertainty'', in ''Steam Steel and Shellfire'', p. 85.</ref>\n\nIn the Royal Navy, the switch to breech-loaders was finally made in 1879; as well as the significant advantages in terms of performance, opinion was swayed by an explosion on board {{HMS|Thunderer|1872|6}} caused by a gun being double-loaded, a problem which could only happen with a muzzle-loading gun.<ref name=\"Roberts\">Roberts, J \"Warships of Steel 1879\u20131889\" in Gardiner ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire''</ref>\n\nThe calibre and weight of guns could only increase so far. The larger the gun, the slower it would be to load, the greater the stresses on the ship's hull, and the less the stability of the ship. The size of the gun peaked in the 1880s, with some of the heaviest calibres of gun ever used at sea. {{HMS|Benbow|1885|6}} carried two [[BL 16.25 inch Mk I naval gun|16.25-inch (413&nbsp;mm) breech-loading guns]], each weighing 110&nbsp;tons\u2014no British battleship would ever carry guns as large. The Italian 450&nbsp;mm (17.72&nbsp;inch) guns would be larger than any gun fitted to a battleship until the [[40 cm/45 Type 94|18.1-inch (460&nbsp;mm)]] armament of the Japanese {{sclass-|Yamato|battleship|4}} of [[World War II]].<ref>The Royal Navy did build {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on}} guns for the ''Furious''-class battlecruisers, though these ships were finished as aircraft carriers and their guns eventually fitted to the {{sclass-|Lord Clive|monitor|2}}s, seeing service in World War I.</ref> One consideration which became more acute was that even from the original Armstrong models, following the Crimean War, range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy, especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as 'floating weapons-platform' could negate the advantage of rifling.  American ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least 'skip' along the surface of the water.  Actual effective combat ranges, they had learned during the Civil War, were comparable to those in the Age of Sail\u2014though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in only a few rounds.  Smoke and the general chaos of battle only added to the problem. As a result, many naval engagements in the 'Age of the Ironclad' were still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets, and well below the maximum reach of their ships' guns.\n\nAnother method of increasing firepower was to vary the projectile fired or the nature of the propellant. Early ironclads used [[Gunpowder|black powder]], which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant [[cannon]]s had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different [[brown powder]] which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.<ref name=\"Campbell\">Campbell, J \"Naval Armaments and Armour\" in Gardiner ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire'', pp. 158\u201369.</ref>\n\nThe development of [[smokeless powder]], based on nitroglycerine or nitrocellulose, by the French inventor [[Paul Marie Eug\u00e8ne Vieille|Paul Vielle]] in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels. The guns of the [[pre-Dreadnought battleship]]s of the 1890s tended to be smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s, most often 12&nbsp;in (305&nbsp;mm), but progressively grew in length of barrel, making use of improved propellants to gain greater muzzle velocity.<ref name=\"Campbell\"/>\n\nThe nature of the projectiles also changed during the ironclad period. Initially, the best armor-piercing projectile was a solid cast-iron shot. Later, shot of [[chill (foundry)|chilled iron]], a harder iron alloy, gave better armor-piercing qualities. Eventually the [[armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing shell]] was developed.<ref name=\"Campbell\" />\n\n=== Positioning of armament ===\n\n==== Broadside ironclads ====\n{{anchor|Broadside}}\n[[File:HMs warrior1860gundeck.JPG|thumb|upright|The conventional [[broadside]] of [[68-pounder]]s on {{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}} of 1860]]\nThe first British, French and Russian ironclads, in a logical development of warship design from the long preceding era of wooden [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]], carried their weapons in a single line along their sides and so were called \"[[broadside]] ironclads\".<ref>Reed, ''Our Ironclad Ships'' p 4, 45\u201350, 68, 139, 217\u2013221, 224\u20136, 228, 233.</ref><ref name=ConwaysBroadside>''Conways's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860\u20131905'' 7\u201311, 118\u20139, 173, 267\u20138, 286\u20137, 301, 337\u20139, 389.</ref> Both {{ship|French ironclad|Gloire||2}} and {{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}} were examples of this type. Because their armor was so heavy, they could only carry a single row of guns along the main deck on each side rather than a row on each deck.<ref name=\"Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 73\u20134\"/>\n\nA significant number of broadside ironclads were built in the 1860s, principally in Britain and France, but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy, Austria, Russia and the United States.<ref name=ConwaysBroadside/> The advantages of mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one adversary at a time, and the rigging did not impede the field of fire.<ref name=\"Beeler-91\">Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp. 91\u20133.</ref>\n\nBroadside armament also had disadvantages, which became more serious as ironclad technology developed. Heavier guns to penetrate ever-thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried. Furthermore, the adoption of ramming as an important tactic meant the need for ahead and all-round fire.<ref>[[Gerard H U Noel|Noel, Gerard H U]] et al., ''The Gun, Ram and Torpedo, Manoeuvres and tactics of a Naval Battle of the Present Day'', 2nd Edition, pub Griffin 1885.</ref> These problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater all-round fire, which included central-battery, turret, and barbette designs.<ref name=\"Beeler-91\"/>\n\n==== Turrets, batteries and barbettes ====\n[[File:Redoutable-barbette.jpg|thumb|A [[barbette]] of {{ship|French ironclad|Redoutable||2}}]]\n[[File:Le Vauban (cuirass\u00e9).jpg|thumb|230px|Barbette of the French ironclad ''Vauban'' (1882\u20131905)]]\n\nThere were two main design alternatives to the broadside. In one design, the guns were placed in an armored casemate amidships: this arrangement was called the 'box-battery' or 'centre-battery'. In the other, the guns could be placed on a rotating platform to give them a broad field of fire; when fully armored, this arrangement was called a [[Gun turret|turret]] and when partially armored or unarmored, a [[barbette]].\n\nThe [[central battery ship|centre-battery]] was the simpler and, during the 1860s and 1870s, the more popular method. Concentrating guns amidships meant the ship could be shorter and handier than a broadside type. The first full-scale centre-battery ship was {{HMS|Bellerophon|1865|6}} of 1865; the French laid down centre-battery ironclads in 1865 which were not completed until 1870. Centre-battery ships often, but not always, had a recessed freeboard enabling some of their guns to fire directly ahead.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 87.</ref>\n\nThe turret was first used in naval combat on the USS ''Monitor'' in 1862, with a type of turret designed by the Swedish engineer [[John Ericsson]]. A competing turret design was proposed by the British inventor [[Cowper Coles]] with a prototype of this installed on [[HMS Trusty (1855)|HMS ''Trusty'']] in 1861 for testing and evaluation purposes. Ericsson's turret turned on a central spindle, and Coles's turned on a ring of bearings.<ref name = \"Campbell\"/> Turrets offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns, but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s.  The fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging, so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean-going ironclads.  The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy.  Ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret (guns and armor protection) by deliberately designing a ship with very low freeboard.  The weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armor.  Low freeboard, however, also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage\u2014and therefore range of the vessel.  In many respects, the turreted, low-freeboard ''Monitor'' and the broadside sailer HMS ''Warrior'' represented two opposite extremes in what an 'Ironclad' was all about.  The most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes, or 'squaring this circle', was designed by Captain Cowper Phipps Coles: [[HMS Captain (1869)|HMS ''Captain'']], a dangerously low freeboard turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail, and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in 1870. Her half-sister {{HMS|Monarch|1868|6}} was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams. The third Royal Navy ship to combine turrets and masts was {{HMS|Inflexible|1876|6}} of 1876, which carried two turrets on either side of the centre-line, allowing both to fire fore, aft and broadside.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' p. 122.</ref>\n\nA lighter alternative to the turret, particularly popular with the French navy, was the barbette. These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turntable. The crew was sheltered from direct fire, but vulnerable to [[plunging fire]], for instance from shore emplacements. The barbette was lighter than the turret, needing less machinery and no roof armor\u2014though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top-weight of their ships. The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s, and with the addition of an armored 'gun-house', transformed into the turrets of the pre-Dreadnought battleships.<ref name = \"Campbell\"/>\n\n=== Torpedoes ===\nThe ironclad age saw the development of explosive [[torpedo]]es as naval weapons, which helped complicate the design and tactics of ironclad fleets. The first torpedoes were static [[naval mine|mines]], used extensively in the American Civil War. That conflict also saw the development of the [[spar torpedo]], an explosive charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat. For the first time, a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one\u2014and given the relative inefficiency of shellfire against ironclads, the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously. The U.S. Navy converted four of its monitors to become turretless armored spar-torpedo vessels while under construction in 1864\u20135, but these vessels never saw action.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 83.</ref> Another proposal, the towed or 'Harvey' torpedo, involved an explosive on a line or outrigger; either to deter a ship from ramming or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less suicidal.\n\nA more practical and influential weapon was the self-propelled or [[Whitehead torpedo]].  Invented in 1868 and deployed in the 1870s, the Whitehead torpedo formed part of the armament of ironclads of the 1880s like HMS ''Inflexible'' and the Italian ''Caio Duilio'' and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Enrico Dandolo||2}}. The ironclad's vulnerability to the torpedo was a key part of the critique of armored warships made by the [[Jeune Ecole]] school of naval thought; it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent destruction by gunfire would be slow enough to be easily caught by torpedo. In practice, however, the Jeune Ecole was only briefly influential and the torpedo formed part of the confusing mixture of weapons possessed by ironclads.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 156.</ref>\n\n== Armor and construction ==\n[[File:LeRedoutablePhoto.jpg|thumb|The French {{ship|French ironclad|Redoutable||2}} (1876), the first battleship to use steel as the main building material]]\n\nThe first ironclads were built on wooden or iron hulls, and protected by wrought iron armor backed by thick wooden planking.  Ironclads were still being built with wooden hulls into the 1870s.\n\n=== Hulls: iron, wood and steel ===\nUsing iron construction for warships offered advantages for the engineering of the hull. However, unarmored iron had many military disadvantages, and offered technical problems which kept wooden hulls in use for many years, particularly for long-range cruising warships.\n\nIron ships had first been proposed for military use in the 1820s. In the 1830s and 1840s, France, Britain and the United States had all experimented with iron-hulled but unarmored gunboats and frigates. However, the iron-hulled frigate was abandoned by the end of the 1840s, because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot; iron was more brittle than wood, and iron frames more likely to fall out of shape than wood.<ref>Lambert ''Battleships in Transition'', p. 19.</ref>\n\nThe unsuitability of unarmored iron for warship hulls meant that iron was only adopted as a building material for battleships when protected by armor. However, iron gave the naval architect many advantages. Iron allowed larger ships and more flexible design, for instance the use of watertight bulkheads on the lower decks. ''Warrior'', built of iron, was longer and faster than the wooden-hulled ''Gloire''.  Iron could be produced to order and used immediately, in contrast to the need to give wood a long period of [[seasoning (wood)|seasoning]]. And, given the large quantities of wood required to build a steam warship and the falling cost of iron, iron hulls were increasingly cost-effective. The main reason for the French use of wooden hulls for the ironclad fleet built in the 1860s was that the French iron industry could not supply enough, and the main reason why Britain built its handful of wooden-hulled ironclads was to make best use of hulls already started and wood already bought.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp. 30\u20136.</ref>\n\nWooden hulls continued to be used for long-range and smaller ironclads, because iron nevertheless had a significant disadvantage.  Iron hulls suffered quick [[fouling]] by marine life, slowing the ships down\u2014manageable for a European battlefleet close to [[dry dock]]s, but a difficulty for long-range ships. The only solution was to sheath the iron hull first in wood and then in copper, a laborious and expensive process which made wooden construction remain attractive.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp. 32\u20133.</ref> Iron and wood were to some extent interchangeable: the Japanese {{ship|Japanese ironclad|Kong\u014d||2}} and {{ship|Japanese ironclad|Hiei||2}} ordered in 1875 were sister-ships, but one was built of iron and the other of composite construction.<ref>Jenschura Jung & Mickel, ''Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy'', {{ISBN|0-85368-151-1}}.</ref>\n\nAfter 1872, steel started to be introduced as a material for construction. Compared to [[iron]], [[steel]] allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight. The French Navy led the way with the use of steel in its fleet, starting with the {{ship|French ironclad|Redoutable||2}}, laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876.<ref>Gardiner, \"Steam, Steel and Shellfire\", p.96</ref> ''Redoutable'' nonetheless had wrought iron armor plate, and part of her exterior hull was iron rather than steel.\n\nEven though Britain led the world in steel production, the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel warships. The [[Bessemer process]] for steel manufacture produced too many imperfections for large-scale use on ships. French manufacturers used the [[Siemens-Martin process]] to produce adequate steel, but British technology lagged behind.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp. 37\u201341.</ref> The first all-steel warships built by the [[Royal Navy]] were the dispatch vessels ''Iris'' and ''Mercury'', laid down in 1875 and 1876.\n\n=== Armor and protection schemes ===\n[[File:HMS Warrior (1860) bulkhead armour.jpg|thumb|upright|The iron-and-wood armor of {{HMS|Warrior|1860|2}}]]\n\nIron-built ships used wood as part of their protection scheme.  HMS ''Warrior'' was protected by 4.5&nbsp;in (114&nbsp;mm) of [[wrought iron]] backed by 15&nbsp;in (381&nbsp;mm) of [[teak]], the strongest shipbuilding wood. The wood played two roles, preventing [[spalling]] and also preventing the shock of a hit damaging the structure of the ship. Later, wood and iron were combined in 'sandwich' armor, for instance in {{HMS|Inflexible|1876|6}}.<ref>Hill, ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'' p. 39.</ref>\n\nSteel was also an obvious material for armor. It was tested in the 1860s, but the steel of the time was too [[brittle]] and disintegrated when struck by shells.  Steel became practical to use when a way was found to fuse steel onto wrought iron plates, giving a form of [[compound armor]].  This compound armor was used by the British in ships built from the late 1870s, first for turret armor (starting with HMS ''Inflexible'') and then for all armor (starting with {{HMS|Colossus|1882|6}} of 1882).<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' p. 45.</ref>  The French and German navies adopted the innovation almost immediately, with licenses being given for the use of the 'Wilson System' of producing fused armor.<ref name = \"Sondhaus 164-5\">Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 164\u20135.</ref>\n\nThe first ironclads to have all-steel armor were the Italian {{ship|Italian ironclad|Caio Duilio||2}} and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Enrico Dandolo||2}}. Though the ships were laid down in 1873 their armor was not purchased from France until 1877. The French navy decided in 1880 to adopt compound armor for its fleet, but found it limited in supply, so from 1884 the French navy was using steel armor.<ref name = \"Sondhaus 164-5\" /> Britain stuck to compound armor until 1889.\n\nThe ultimate ironclad armor was [[case hardening|case hardened]] nickel-steel. In 1890, the U.S. Navy tested steel armor hardened by the [[Harvey process]] and found it superior to compound armor.  For several years 'Harvey steel' was the state of the art, produced in the U.S., France, Germany, Britain, Austria and Italy. In 1894, the German firm [[Krupp]] developed [[Krupp armour|gas cementing]], which further hardened steel armor. The German {{SMS|Kaiser Friedrich III||2}}, laid down in 1895, was the first ship to benefit from the new 'Krupp armor' and the new armor was quickly adopted; the Royal Navy using it from {{HMS|Canopus|1897|6}}, laid down in 1896. By 1901 almost all new battleships used Krupp armor, though the U.S. continued to use Harvey armor alongside until the end of the decade.\n\nThe equivalent strengths of the different armor plates was as follows: 15&nbsp;in (381&nbsp;mm) of wrought iron was equivalent to 12&nbsp;in (305&nbsp;mm) of either plain steel or compound iron and steel armor, and to 7.75&nbsp;in (197&nbsp;mm) of Harvey armor or 5.75&nbsp;in (146&nbsp;mm) of Krupp armor.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 166.</ref>\n\nIronclad construction also prefigured the later debate in battleship design between tapering and 'all-or-nothing' armor design. ''Warrior'' was only semi-armored, and could have been disabled by hits on the bow and stern.<ref>Reed \"Our Iron Clad Ships\", pp. 45\u20137.</ref> As the thickness of armor grew to protect ships from the increasingly heavy guns, the area of the ship which could be fully protected diminished.  ''Inflexible''{{'}}s armor protection was largely limited to the central citadel amidships, protecting boilers and engines, turrets and magazines, and little else. An ingenious arrangement of cork-filled compartments and watertight bulkheads was intended to keep her stable and afloat in the event of heavy damage to her un-armored sections.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp. 133\u20134.</ref>\n\n== Propulsion: steam and sail ==\n[[File:Gloire.jpg|thumb|left|{{ship|French ironclad|Gloire||2}} under sail]]\nThe first ocean-going ironclads carried masts and sails like their wooden predecessors, and these features were only gradually abandoned. Early steam engines were inefficient; the wooden steam fleet of the Royal Navy could only carry \"5 to 9 days coal\",<ref name=\"Beeler-54\">Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' p. 54.</ref> and the situation was similar with the early ironclads. ''Warrior'' also illustrates two design features which aided hybrid propulsion; she had retractable screws to reduce drag while under sail (though in practice the steam engine was run at a low throttle), and a telescopic funnel which could be folded down to the deck level.<ref>Hill, ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'' p. 44.</ref>\n\n[[File:Arrogante 1864.jpg|thumb|French armored [[floating battery]] {{ship|French ship|Arrogante|1864|3}}.]]\nShips designed for coastal warfare, like the floating batteries of the Crimea, or {{USS|Monitor}} and her sisters, dispensed with masts from the beginning. The British {{HMS|Devastation|1871|6}}, started in 1869, was the first large, ocean-going ironclad to dispense with masts. Her principal role was for combat in the English Channel and other European waters; while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the Atlantic, she would have had little endurance on the other side of the ocean. The ''Devastation'' and the similar ships commissioned by the British and Russian navies in the 1870s were the exception rather than the rule. Most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts, and only the Italian navy, which during that decade was focused on short-range operations in the Adriatic,<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 111\u20132.</ref> built consistently mastless ironclads.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp. 63\u20134.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1860s, steam engines improved with the adoption of [[Steam engine#Compounding engines|double-expansion]] steam engines, which used 30\u201340% less coal than earlier models. The Royal Navy decided to switch to the double-expansion engine in 1871, and by 1875 they were widespread.  However, this development alone was not enough to herald the end of the mast.  Whether this was due to a conservative desire to retain sails, or was a rational response to the operational and strategic situation, is a matter of debate. A steam-only fleet would require a network of coaling stations worldwide, which would need to be fortified at great expense to stop them falling into enemy hands. Just as significantly, because of unsolved problems with the technology of the boilers which provided steam for the engines, the performance of double-expansion engines was rarely as good in practice as it was in theory.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp. 57\u201362.</ref>\n[[File:HMS Inflexible (1881).jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Inflexible|1876|6}}, after the replacement of her sailing masts with 'military masts']]\n\nDuring the 1870s the distinction grew between 'first-class ironclads' or 'battleships' on the one hand, and 'cruising ironclads' designed for long-range work on the other. The demands on first-class ironclads for very heavy armor and armament meant increasing displacement, which reduced speed under sail; and the fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly inconvenient. {{HMS|Inflexible|1876|6}}, launched in 1876 but not commissioned until 1881, was the last British battleship to carry masts, and these were widely seen as a mistake. The start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing rig on ironclad battleships.<ref name=\"Beeler-54\"/>\n\nSails persisted on 'cruising ironclads' for much longer. During the 1860s, the French navy had produced the {{sclass-|Alma|ironclad|5}} and {{sclass-|La Galissonni\u00e8re|ironclad|4}}es as small, long-range ironclads as overseas cruisers<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 88.</ref> and the British had responded with ships like {{HMS|Swiftsure|1870|6}} of 1870. The Russian ship {{ship|Russian cruiser|General-Admiral||2}}, laid down in 1870 and completed in 1875, was a model of a fast, long-range ironclad which was likely to be able to outrun and outfight ships like ''Swiftsure''. Even the later {{HMS|Shannon|1875|6}}, often described as the first British armored cruiser, would have been too slow to outrun ''General-Admiral''. While ''Shannon'' was the last British ship with a retractable propellor, later armored cruisers of the 1870s retained sailing rig, sacrificing speed under steam in consequence. It took until 1881 for the Royal Navy to lay down a long-range armored warship capable of catching enemy commerce raiders, {{HMS|Warspite|1884|6}}, which was completed in 1888.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' p. 194.</ref> While sailing rigs were obsolescent for all purposes by the end of the 1880s, rigged ships were in service until the early years of the 20th century.\n\nThe final evolution of ironclad propulsion was the adoption of the triple-expansion steam engine, a further refinement which was first adopted in {{HMS|Sans Pareil|1887|6}}, laid down in 1885 and commissioned in 1891. Many ships also used a [[forced draught]] to get additional power from their engines, and this system was widely used until the introduction of the [[steam turbine]] in the mid-1900s (decade).<ref name=\"Machinery\">Griffiths, D \"Warship Machinery\" in Gardiner ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire''.</ref>\n\n== Fleets ==\nWhile ironclads spread rapidly in navies worldwide, there were few pitched naval battles involving ironclads. Most European nations settled differences on land, and the [[Royal Navy]] struggled to maintain a deterrent parity with at least France, while providing suitable protection to Britain's commerce and colonial outposts worldwide.  Ironclads remained, for the British Royal Navy, a matter of defending the British Isles first and projecting power abroad second.  Those naval engagements of the latter half of the 19th century which involved ironclads normally involved colonial actions or clashes between second-rate naval powers.  But these encounters were often enough to convince British policy-makers of the increasing hazards of strictly naval foreign intervention, from Hampton Roads in the American Civil War to the hardening combined defences of naval arsenals such as Kronstadt and Cherbourg.\n\nThere were many types of ironclads:<ref>Conway, ''All the World's Fighting Ships 1860\u20131905'', Conway Maritime Press, 1979.  {{ISBN|0-8317-0302-4}}.</ref>\n* Seagoing ships intended to \"stand in the line of battle\"; the precursors of the [[battleship]].<ref>This term was still in use in the 1860s and 1970s for what we would now call 'battleships'.

The [[Royal Navy]] was the second to adopt ironclad warships, and it applied them worldwide in their whole range of roles. In the age of sail, the British strategy for war depended on the Royal Navy mounting a blockade of the ports of the enemy. Because of the limited endurance of steamships, this was no longer possible, so the British at times considered the risk-laden plan of engaging an enemy fleet in harbor as soon as war broke out. To this end, the Royal Navy developed a series of 'coast-defence battleships', starting with the ''Devastation'' class. These '[[monitor (warship)|breastwork monitors]]' were markedly different from the other high-seas ironclads of the period and were an important precursor of the modern battleship.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' p. 204.</ref> As long-range monitors they could reach Bermuda unescorted, for example. However, they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and obstructions (and enemy monitors) as the original monitors of the Union Navy proved to be during the Civil War. The British prepared for an overwhelming mortar bombardment of Kronstadt by the close of the Crimean War, but never considered running the smoke-ridden, shallow-water gauntlet straight to St. Petersburg with ironclads. Likewise, monitors proved acutely unable to 'overwhelm' enemy fortifications single-handed during the American conflict, though their low-profile and heavy armor protection made them ideal for running gauntlets. Mines and obstructions, however, negated these advantages\u2014a problem the British Admiralty frequently acknowledged but never countered throughout the period. The British never laid down enough ''Devastation''-class 'battleships' to instantly overwhelm Cherbourg, Kronstadt or even New York City with gunfire. Although throughout the 1860s and 1870s the Royal Navy was still in many respects superior to its potential rivals, by the early 1880s widespread concern about the threat from France and Germany culminated in the [[Naval Defence Act 1889|Naval Defence Act]], which promulgated the idea of a 'two-power standard', that Britain should possess as many ships as the next two navies combined. This standard provoked aggressive shipbuilding in the 1880s and 1890s.<ref name=\"Kennedy\">Kennedy, Paul M. ''The Rise and Fall of British Naval Mastery'', [[Macmillan Publishers]], London, 1983. {{ISBN|0-333-35094-4}}, pp. 178\u201379.</ref>\n\nBritish ships did not participate in any major wars in the ironclad period. The Royal Navy's ironclads only saw action as part of colonial battles or one-sided engagements like the [[bombardment of Alexandria]] in 1882. Defending British interests against [[Ahmed 'Urabi]]'s [[Urabi Revolt|Egyptian revolt]], a British fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port of Alexandria. A mixture of centre-battery and turret ships bombarded Egyptian positions for most of a day, forcing the [[Egyptians]] to retreat; return fire from Egyptian guns was heavy at first, but inflicted little damage, killing only five British sailors.<ref>Hill, ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'' p. 185.</ref> Few Egyptian guns were actually dismounted, on the other hand, and the fortifications themselves were typically left intact. Had the Egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars that were at their disposal, they might have quickly turned the tide, for the attacking British ironclads found it easy (for accuracy's sake) to simply anchor whilst firing\u2014perfect targets for high-angle fire upon their thinly armored topdecks.\n\nThe French navy built the first ironclad to try to gain a strategic advantage over the British, but were consistently out-built by the British. Despite taking the lead with a number of innovations like [[breech-loading weapon]]s and steel construction, the French navy could never match the size of the Royal Navy. In the 1870s, the construction of ironclads ceased for a while in France as the [[Jeune Ecole]] school of naval thought took prominence, suggesting that [[torpedo boat]]s and unarmored [[cruisers]] would be the future of warships. Like the British, the French navy saw little action with its ironclads; the French blockade of Germany in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] was ineffective, as the war was settled entirely on land.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 101.</ref>\n\nRussia built a number of ironclads, generally copies of British or French designs. Nonetheless, there were real innovations from Russia; the first true type of ironclad [[armored cruiser]], ''General-Admiral'' of the 1870s, and a set of remarkably badly designed [[Russian monitor Novgorod|circular battleships]] referred to as 'popovkas' (for [[Andrei Alexandrovich Popov|Admiral Popov]], who conceived the design). The Russian Navy pioneered the wide-scale use of torpedo boats during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878]], mainly out of necessity because of the superior numbers and quality of ironclads used by the Turkish navy.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 122\u20136.</ref> Russia expanded her navy in the 1880s and 1890s with modern armored cruisers and battleships, but the ships were manned by inexperienced crews and politically appointed leadership, which enhanced their defeat in the [[Battle of Tsushima]] on 27 May 1905.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 187\u201391.</ref>\n\n[[File:Sinking of the Esmeralda during the battle of Iquique.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Iquique]], where Peruvian ironclad {{ship||Hu\u00e1scar|ironclad|2}} sunk the Chilean wooden corvette [[Esmeralda (1855)|''Esmeralda'']].]]\nThe US Navy ended the Civil War with about fifty [[monitor (warship)|monitor]]-type coastal ironclads; by the 1870s most of these were laid up in reserve, leaving the United States virtually without an ironclad fleet. Another five large monitors were ordered in the 1870s. The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the US from projecting power overseas, and until the 1890s the United States would have come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers. The 1890s saw the beginning of what became the [[Great White Fleet]], and it was the modern pre-Dreadnoughts and armored cruisers built in the 1890s which defeated the Spanish fleet in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898. This started a new era of naval warfare.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 126\u201328 173\u201379.</ref>\n\n[[File:BAP Loa blindado.jpg|thumb|left|[[List of Peruvian Navy ships#Minor Warships|''Loa'']] being fitted after its conversion in the Callao harbour, 1864]]\nIronclads were widely used in South America.

The powerful Spanish {{ship|Spanish ironclad|Numancia||2}} participated in the [[Battle of Callao]] but was unable to inflict significant damage upon the Callao defences. Besides, Peru was able to deploy two locally built ironclads based on American Civil War designs,<ref>Historia naval del Per\u00fa.

''Numancia'', a Spanish ship led by Casto M\u00e9ndez N\u00fa\u00f1ez, was the first ironclad to circumnavigate the world, arriving in [[C\u00e1diz]] on 20 September 1867, and earning the motto: \"Enloricata navis que primo terram circuivit\" [\"First ironclad ship to sail around the world\"]). In the [[War of the Pacific]] in 1879, both Peru and Chile had ironclad warships, including some of those used a few years previously against Spain. While ''Independencia'' ran aground early on, the Peruvian ironclad {{ship||Hu\u00e1scar|ironclad|2}} made a great impact against Chilean shipping, delaying Chilean ground invasion by six months.

The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later [[armored cruiser]]s. These ships engaged the Chinese [[Beiyang fleet]] which was superior on paper at least at the [[Battle of Yalu River (1894)|Battle of the Yalu River]]. Thanks to superior short-range firepower, the Japanese fleet came off better, sinking or severely damaging eight ships and receiving serious damage to only four. The naval war was concluded the next year at the [[Battle of Weihaiwei]], where the strongest remaining Chinese ships were surrendered to the Japanese.<ref>Hill, ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'' p. 191.</ref>\n\n== End of the ironclad warship ==\n{{main|Battleship}}\nThere is no clearly defined end to the ironclad, besides the transition from wood hulls to all-metal. Ironclads continued to be used in World War I. Towards the end of the 19th century, the descriptions '[[battleship]]' and '[[armored cruiser]]' came to replace the term 'ironclad'.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' p. 154 states that {{HMS|Edinburgh|1882|6}} was the first British capital ship to be routinely called a battleship.</ref>\n\nThe proliferation of ironclad battleship designs came to an end in the 1890s as navies reached a consensus on the design of battleships, producing the type known as the [[pre-Dreadnought]]. These ships are sometimes covered in treatments of the ironclad warship. The next evolution of battleship design, the [[dreadnought]], is never referred to as an 'ironclad'.<ref>Hill, ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'' p. 18.</ref>\n\nMost of the ironclads of the 1870s and 1880s served into the first decades of the 1900s. For instance, a handful of US navy monitors laid down in the 1870s saw active service in World War I. Pre-Dreadnought battleships and cruisers of the 1890s saw widespread action in World War I and in some cases through to World War II.\n\n=== Legacy ===\n[[File:HG Wells Land Ironclads 1904.jpg|thumb|1904 illustration of [[H.G.

''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'' {{ISBN|0-304-35273-X}}; p. 17.</ref> The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary [[shell (projectile)|shells]]. The first ironclad battleship, {{ship|French ironclad|Gloire||2}}, was launched by the [[French Navy]] in November 1859.<ref>Sondhaus, Lawrence. ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' {{ISBN|0-415-21478-5}}, pp. 73\u20134.</ref> The British [[Admiralty]] had been considering armored warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an armored [[corvette]] in 1857; in early 1859 the [[Royal Navy]] started building two iron-hulled armored frigates, and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all-armored battle fleet. After the [[Battle of Hampton Roads|first clashes of ironclads]] (both with wooden ships and with one another) took place in 1862 during the [[American Civil War]], it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored [[ship of the line]] as the most powerful warship afloat. This type of ship would come to be very successful in the American Civil War.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 86.</ref>\n\nIronclads were designed for several roles, including as high seas [[battleship]]s, [[Littoral (military)|coastal]] defense ships, and long-range [[cruiser]]s. The rapid development of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden-hulled vessel that carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel-built, turreted battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century. This change was pushed forward by the development of heavier naval guns (the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea at the time), more sophisticated steam engines, and [[History of ferrous metallurgy|advances in metallurgy]] which made steel shipbuilding possible.\n\nThe quick pace of change meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were finished, and that naval tactics were in a state of flux. Many ironclads were built to make use of the [[naval ram|ram]] or the [[torpedo]], which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat. There is no clear end to the ironclad period, but towards the end of the 1890s the term ''ironclad'' dropped out of use. New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or [[armored cruiser]]s.\n\n== Ironclad ==\nThe ironclad became technically feasible and tactically necessary because of developments in shipbuilding in the first half of the 19th century. According to naval historian [[J. Richard Hill]]: \"The (ironclad) had three chief characteristics: a metal-skinned hull, steam propulsion and a main armament of guns capable of firing explosive shells. It is only when all three characteristics are present that a fighting ship can properly be called an ironclad.\"<ref name=\"Hill\">Hill, ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'' p. 17.</ref> Each of these developments was introduced separately in the decade before the first ironclads.\n\n=== Steam propulsion ===\n[[File:Napoleon(1850).jpg|thumb|{{ship|French ship|Napol\u00e9on|1850|3}}, the first steam battleship]]\nIn the 18th and early 19th centuries fleets had relied on two types of major warship, the [[ship of the line]] and the [[frigate]]. The first major change to these types was the introduction of [[steam power]] for [[Marine propulsion|propulsion]]. While [[paddle steamer]] warships had been used from the 1830s onwards, steam propulsion only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the [[screw propeller]] in the 1840s.<ref name = \"Screw\">Lambert, A. \"The Screw Propellor Warship\", in Gardiner ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire'' pp. 30\u201344.</ref>\n\nSteam-powered screw frigates were built in the mid-1840s, and at the end of the decade the [[French Navy]] introduced steam power to its [[line of battle]]. The desire for change came from the ambition of [[Napoleon III]] to gain greater influence in Europe, which required a challenge to the British at sea.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 37\u201341.</ref><ref name = \"Hill 25\">Hill, ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'' p. 25.</ref> The first purpose-built steam battleship was the 90-gun {{ship|French ship|Napol\u00e9on|1850|2}} in 1850.<ref name = \"Screw\"/>  ''Napol\u00e9on'' was armed as a conventional ship-of-the-line, but her steam engines could give her a speed of 12 knots (22&nbsp;km/h), regardless of the wind conditions: a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement.\n\nThe introduction of the steam ship-of-the-line led to a building competition between France and Britain. Eight sister ships to ''Napol\u00e9on'' were built in France over a period of ten years, but the United Kingdom soon managed to take the lead in production. Altogether, France built ten new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 from older ships of the line, while the United Kingdom built 18 and converted 41.<ref name = \"Screw\"/>\n\n=== Explosive shells ===\n{{further|Paixhans gun}}\n[[File:PaixhansCanonImage.jpg|thumb|A [[Paixhans gun|Paixhans]] naval [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] gun. 1860 engraving.]]\nThe era of the wooden steam ship-of-the-line was brief, because of new, more powerful naval guns. In the 1820s and 1830s, warships began to mount increasingly heavy guns, replacing [[18-pounder long gun|18-]] and [[24-pounder long gun|24-pounder guns]] with 32-pounders on sailing ships-of-the-line and introducing [[68-pounder]]s on steamers. Then, the first [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the French G\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[Henri-Joseph Paixhans]], and by the 1840s were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the [[French Navy]], [[Royal Navy]], [[Imperial Russian Navy]] and [[United States Navy]]. It is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls, as demonstrated by the Russian destruction of an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] squadron at the [[Battle of Sinop]], spelled the end of the wooden-hulled warship.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 58.</ref> The more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red-hot shot, which could lodge in the hull of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion.  Some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power.<ref name = \"Lambert\">Lambert, A.

There followed, also from Laird, the first full-blown warships with metal hulls, the 1842 steam frigates ''Guadalupe'' and ''Moctezuma'' for the Mexican navy.<ref name=\"Sandler 2004\">{{cite book |last1=Sandler |first1=Stanley |title=Battleships: An Illustrated History of Their Impact |date=2004 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=1851094105 |page=20}}</ref><ref name=\"threedecks\">{{cite web |title=Mexican paddle steamer 'Guadalupe' (1842) |url=https://threedecks.org/index.php?display_type=show_ship&id=11583 |website=threedecks.org |accessdate=6 August 2018}}</ref> But a thin iron skin, while not being susceptible to fire or lethal splintering like wood, was not the same thing as providing iron ''armor'' calculated to stop enemy gunfire.\n\nIn 1843, the United States Navy launched its first iron warship, [[USS Michigan (1843)|USS ''Michigan'']], on the Great Lakes. This pioneering iron-hulled, steam-powered ship served for 70 years in the relatively peaceful region.\n\nFollowing the demonstration of the power of explosive shells against wooden ships at the [[Battle of Sinop]], and fearing that his own ships would be vulnerable to the [[Paixhans guns]] of Russian fortifications in the [[Crimean War]], Emperor [[Napoleon III]] ordered the development of light-draft floating batteries, equipped with heavy guns and protected by heavy armor.<ref name=Baxter70>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rR95Mi7vVHoC&pg=PA82&dq=Lave+Tonnante+D%C3%A9vastation#PPA70,M1 Baxter, ''The Introduction of the Ironclad Warship'', p70]</ref> Experiments made during the first half of 1854 proved highly satisfactory, and on 17 July 1854, the French communicated to the British Government that a solution had been found to make gun-proof vessels and that plans would be communicated.<ref name=Baxter72>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rR95Mi7vVHoC&pg=PA82&dq=Lave+Tonnante+D%C3%A9vastation#PPA72,M1 Baxter, ''The Introduction of the Ironclad Warship'', p72]</ref> After tests in September 1854, the British Admiralty agreed to build five armored floating batteries on the French plans,<ref name=Baxter72/> establishing the important [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company|Thames]] and [[Millwall Iron Works]] within the docks.\n\n\nThe French [[floating battery|floating batteries]] were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the [[Crimean War]]. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries (''Lave'', ''Tonnante'' and ''D\u00e9vastation'') in 1855 against the defenses at the [[Battle of Kinburn (1855)|Battle of Kinburn]] on the [[Black Sea]], where they were effective against Russian shore defences.

The result was the first ocean-going ironclad, {{ship|French ironclad|Gloire||2}}, begun in 1857 and launched in 1859.<ref name=\"Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 73\u20134\">Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 73\u20134.</ref>\n\n''Gloire''{{'}}s wooden hull was modelled on that of a steam ship of the line, reduced to one deck, sheathed in iron plates 4.5&nbsp;inches (110&nbsp;mm) thick. She was propelled by a steam engine, driving a single screw propeller for a speed of 13 knots (24&nbsp;km/h). She was armed with thirty-six {{convert|6.4|in|mm|adj=on}} rifled guns. France proceeded to construct 16 ironclad warships, including two more sister ships to ''Gloire'', and the only two-decked broadside ironclads ever built, {{ship|French ironclad|Magenta||2}} and {{ship|French ironclad|Solf\u00e9rino||2}}.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 74.</ref>\n\n[[File:HMSWarrior.JPG|thumb|left|{{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}} (1860), Britain's first seagoing ironclad warship]]\n\nThe Royal Navy had not been keen to sacrifice its advantage in steam ships of the line, but was determined that the first British ironclad would outmatch the French ships in every respect, particularly speed. A fast ship would have the advantage of being able to choose a range of engagement which could make her invulnerable to enemy fire. The British specification was more a large, powerful [[frigate]] than a ship-of-the-line. The requirement for speed meant a very long vessel, which had to be built from iron. The result was the construction of two {{sclass-|Warrior|ironclad|2}}s; {{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}} and {{HMS|Black Prince|1861|6}}. The ships had a successful design, though there were necessarily compromises between 'sea-keeping', strategic range and armor protection; their weapons were more effective than those of ''Gloire'', and with the largest set of steam engines yet fitted to a ship they could steam at 14.3&nbsp;knots (26.5&nbsp;km/h).<ref name = \"Iron\"/> Yet the ''Gloire'' and her sisters had full iron-armor protection along the waterline and the battery itself.  ''Warrior'' and ''Black Prince'' (but also the smaller [[HMS Defence (1861)|''Defence'']] and [[HMS Resistance (1861)|''Resistance'']]) were obliged to concentrate their armor in a central \"citadel\" or \"armoured box\", leaving many main deck guns and the fore and aft sections of the vessel unprotected.  The use of iron in the construction of ''Warrior ''also came with some drawbacks; iron hulls required more regular and intensive repairs than wooden hulls, and iron was more susceptible to fouling by marine life.\n\nBy 1862, navies across Europe had adopted ironclads. Britain and France each had sixteen either completed or under construction, though the British vessels were larger. Austria, Italy, Russia, and Spain were also building ironclads.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 76.</ref> However, the first battles using the new ironclad ships involved neither Britain nor France, and involved ships markedly different from the broadside-firing, masted designs of ''Gloire'' and ''Warrior''. The use of ironclads by both sides in the American Civil War, and the clash of the Italian and Austrian fleets at the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]], had an important influence on the development of ironclad design.\n\n=== First battles between ironclads: the U.S. Civil War ===\n[[File:Monitor officers2.jpg|right|thumb|<center>Officers of a monitor-class warship, probably {{USS|Patapsco|1862|6}}, photographed during the [[American Civil War]].</center>]][[File:Ironclads off Cairo, Illinois.jpg|right|thumb|<center>United States Navy ironclads off [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]], [[Illinois]], during the [[American Civil War]].</center>]]The first use of ironclads in action came in the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]]. The U.S. Navy at the time the war broke out had no ironclads, its most powerful ships being six unarmored steam-powered frigates.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 77.</ref> Since the bulk of the Navy remained loyal to the Union, the Confederacy sought to gain advantage in the naval conflict by acquiring modern armored ships. In May 1861, the Confederate Congress appropriated $2&nbsp;million for the purchase of ironclads from overseas, and in July and August 1861 the Confederacy started work on construction and converting wooden ships.<ref name = \"ACW\">Still, William \"The American Civil War\" in Gardiner ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire''.</ref>\n\nOn 12 October 1861, {{ship|CSS|Manassas}} became the first ironclad to enter combat, when she fought Union warships on the Mississippi during the [[Battle of the Head of Passes]]. She had been converted from a commercial vessel in New Orleans for river and coastal fighting. In February 1862, the larger {{ship|CSS|Virginia}} joined the Confederate Navy, having been rebuilt at [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard|Norfolk]]. Constructed on the hull of {{USS|Merrimack|1855|6}}, ''Virginia'' originally was a conventional warship made of wood, but she was converted into an iron-covered [[casemate ironclad]] gunship, when she entered the [[Confederate Navy]]. By this time, the Union had completed seven ironclad gunboats of the {{sclass2-|City|ironclad|4}}, and was about to complete {{USS|Monitor}}, an innovative design proposed by the Swedish inventor [[John Ericsson]]. The Union was also building a large armored frigate, {{USS|New Ironsides}}, and the smaller {{USS|Galena|1862|6}}.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 78.</ref>\n\nThe first battle between ironclads happened on 9 March 1862, as the armored ''Monitor'' was deployed to protect the Union's wooden fleet from the ironclad ram ''Virginia'' and other Confederate warships.<ref>Preston, pp. 12\u20134.</ref> In this engagement, the second day of the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]], the two ironclads repeatedly tried to ram one another while shells bounced off their armor.  The battle attracted attention worldwide, making it clear that the wooden warship was now out of date, with the ironclads destroying them easily.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 78\u201381.</ref>\n\nThe Civil War saw more ironclads built by both sides, and they played an increasing role in the naval war alongside the unarmored warships, commerce raiders and blockade runners. The Union built a large fleet of fifty [[monitor (warship)|monitors]] modeled on their namesake.  The Confederacy built ships designed as smaller versions of ''Virginia'', many of which saw action,<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 82.</ref> but their attempts to buy ironclads overseas were frustrated as European nations confiscated ships being built for the Confederacy&nbsp;\u2013 especially in Russia, the only country to openly support the Union through the war. Only [[Japanese ironclad K\u014dtetsu|CSS ''Stonewall'']] was completed, and she arrived in American waters just in time for the end of the war.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 85.</ref>\n\nThrough the remainder of the war, ironclads saw action in the Union's attacks on Confederate ports.  Seven Union monitors, including {{USS|Montauk|1862|6}}, as well as two other ironclads, the ironclad frigate ''New Ironsides'' and a light-draft {{USS|Keokuk|1862|6}}, participated in the failed [[First Battle of Charleston Harbor|attack on Charleston]]; one was sunk. Two small ironclads, {{ship|CSS|Palmetto State}} and {{ship|CSS|Chicora}} participated in the defence of the harbor. For the later attack at [[Battle of Mobile Bay|Mobile Bay]], the Union assembled four monitors as well as 11 wooden ships, facing the {{ship|CSS|Tennessee|1863|6}}, the Confederacy's most powerful ironclad and the gunboats {{ship|CSS|Morgan}}, {{ship|CSS|Gaines}}, {{ship|CSS|Selma|1856|6}}.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 81.</ref>\n\nOn the western front, the Union built a formidable force of river ironclads, beginning with several converted riverboats and then contracting engineer [[James Eads]] of [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] to build the City-class ironclads. These excellent ships were built with twin engines and a central paddle wheel, all protected by an armored casement. They had a shallow draft, allowing them to journey up smaller tributaries, and were very well suited for river operations. Eads also produced monitors for use on the rivers, the first two of which differed from the ocean-going monitors in that they contained a paddle wheel ({{USS|Neosho|1863|6}} and {{USS|Osage|1863|6}}). [[File:Uss Cairo h61568.jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|Cairo}}, an example of a City-class ironclad gunboat]]\n\nThe Union ironclads played an important role in the Mississippi and tributaries by providing tremendous fire upon Confederate forts, installations and vessels with relative impunity to enemy fire.  They were not as heavily armored as the ocean-going monitors of the Union, but they were adequate for their intended use.  More Western Flotilla Union ironclads were sunk by [[torpedo (mine)|torpedoes (mines)]] than by enemy fire, and the most damaging fire for the Union ironclads was from shore installations, not Confederate vessels.<ref>Angus Konstam, (2002), ''Union River Ironclad 1861\u201365'', Osprey Publishing, New Vanguard 56, {{ISBN|978-1-84176-444-3}}</ref>\n\n=== Lissa: First fleet battle ===\n[[File:Battle of Lissa - 1866 - Initial Situation.svg|thumb|The fleets engaging for the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]]]]\nThe first fleet battle, and the first ocean battle, involving ironclad warships was the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]] in 1866. Waged between the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] and [[Regia Marina|Italian]] navies, the battle pitted combined fleets of wooden [[frigate]]s and [[corvette]]s and ironclad warships on both sides in the largest naval battle between the battles of [[Battle of Navarino|Navarino]] and [[Battle of Tsushima|Tsushima]].<ref name=\"Sondhaus\">Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 94\u20136.</ref>\n\nThe Italian fleet consisted of 12 ironclads and a similar number of wooden warships, escorting transports which carried troops intending to land on the Adriatic island of Lissa.  Among the Italian ironclads were seven broadside ironclad frigates, four smaller ironclads, and the newly built {{ship|Italian ironclad|Affondatore||2}}&nbsp;\u2013 a double-turreted ram. Opposing them, the Austrian navy had seven ironclad frigates.<ref name=\"Sondhaus\"/>\n\nThe Austrians believed their ships to have less effective guns than their enemy, so decided to engage the Italians at close range and ram them. The Austrian fleet formed into an arrowhead formation with the ironclads in the first line, charging at the Italian ironclad squadron. In the mel\u00e9e which followed both sides were frustrated by the lack of damage inflicted by guns, and by the difficulty of ramming\u2014nonetheless, the effective ramming attack being made by the Austrian flagship against the Italian attracted great attention in following years.<ref name=\"Sondhaus\"/>\n\nThe superior Italian fleet lost its two ironclads, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re d'Italia||2}} and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Palestro||2}}, while the Austrian unarmored screw two-decker {{SMS|Kaiser|1858|6}} remarkably survived close actions with four Italian ironclads. The battle ensured the popularity of the ram as a weapon in European ironclads for many years, and the victory won by Austria established it as the predominant naval power in the [[Adriatic]].<ref name=\"Sondhaus\"/>\n\nThe battles of the American Civil War and at Lissa were very influential on the designs and tactics of the ironclad fleets that followed. In particular, it taught a generation of naval officers the lesson that ramming was the best way to sink enemy ironclads.\n\n== Armament and tactics ==\nThe adoption of iron armor meant that the traditional naval armament of dozens of light cannon became useless, since their shot would bounce off an armored hull.  To penetrate armor, increasingly heavy guns were mounted on ships; nevertheless, the view that [[naval ram|ramming]] was the only way to sink an ironclad became widespread. The increasing size and weight of guns also meant a movement away from the ships mounting many guns broadside, in the manner of a ship-of-the-line, towards a handful of guns in turrets for all-round fire.\n\n=== Ram craze ===\n[[File:Punch - Over-Weighted.png|thumb|''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon from May 1876 showing [[Britannia]] dressed in the armor of an ironclad with the word ''Inflexible'' around her collar and addressing the sea god Neptune. Note the ram sticking out of Britannia's breast plate.  The caption reads: OVER-WEIGHTED. Britannia. \"Look here, Father Nep!  I can't stand it much longer!  Who's to 'rule the waves' in ''this'' sort of thing?\"]] From the 1860s to the 1880s many naval designers believed that the development of the ironclad meant that the [[naval ram|ram]] was again the most important weapon in naval warfare. With steam power freeing ships from the wind, and armor making them invulnerable to shellfire, the ram seemed to offer the opportunity to strike a decisive blow.\n\nThe scant damage inflicted by the guns of ''Monitor'' and ''Virginia'' at [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] and the spectacular but lucky success of the Austrian flagship [[SMS Erzherzog Ferdinand Max (1865)|SMS ''Erzherzog Ferdinand Max'']] sinking the Italian [[Italian ironclad Re d'Italia|''Re d'Italia'']] at [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Lissa]] gave strength to the ramming craze.<ref>Hill, ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'' p. 35.</ref> From the early 1870s to early 1880s most British naval officers thought that guns were about to be replaced as the main naval armament by the ram.  Those who noted the tiny number of ships that had actually been sunk by ramming struggled to be heard.<ref name = \"Beeler\">Beeler, J. ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design, 1870\u20131881''. London, Caxton, 2003. {{ISBN|1-84067-534-9}} pp. 106\u20137.</ref>\n\nThe revival of ramming had a significant effect on naval tactics. Since the 17th century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the [[line of battle]], where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its [[broadside]] guns. This tactic was totally unsuited to ramming, and the ram threw fleet tactics into disarray. The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle, and if it had been, combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' p. 107.</ref>\n\nThe ram finally fell out of favour in the 1880s, as the same effect could be achieved with a [[torpedo]], with less vulnerability to quick-firing guns.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' p. 146.</ref>\n\n=== Development of naval guns ===\nThe armament of ironclads tended to become concentrated in a small number of powerful guns capable of penetrating the armor of enemy ships at range; [[caliber|calibre]] and weight of guns increased markedly to achieve greater penetration. Throughout the ironclad era navies also grappled with the complexities of [[rifling|rifled]] versus [[smoothbore]] guns and [[breech-loading]] versus [[muzzle-loading]].\n[[File:HMS Warrior 110lb BL.png|thumb|left|upright|Breech-loading 110-pounder [[Armstrong gun]] on {{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}}]]\n\n{{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}} carried a mixture of [[RBL 7 inch Armstrong gun|110-pounder 7&nbsp;inch (180&nbsp;mm) breech-loading rifles]] and more traditional [[68-pounder]] smoothbore guns. ''Warrior'' highlighted the challenges of picking the right armament; the breech-loaders she carried, designed by [[William George Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|Sir William Armstrong]], were intended to be the next generation of heavy armament for the Royal Navy, but were shortly withdrawn from service.<ref name=\"Beeler-71\">Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' p. 71.</ref>\n\nBreech-loading guns seemed to offer important advantages. A breech-loader could be reloaded without moving the gun, a lengthy process particularly if the gun then needed to be re-aimed. ''Warrior''{{'}}s [[Armstrong gun]]s also had the virtue of being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore and, because of their rifling, more accurate.<ref name=\"Beeler-71\"/> Nonetheless, the design was rejected because of problems which plagued breech-loaders for decades.\n\nThe weakness of the breech-loader was the obvious problem of sealing the breech. All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of a solid [[propellant]] into gas. This explosion propels the shot or shell out of the front of the gun, but also imposes great stresses on the gun-barrel. If the breech\u2014which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun\u2014is not entirely secure, then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break. This in turn reduces the [[muzzle velocity]] of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew. ''Warrior''{{'}}s Armstrong guns suffered from both problems; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4.5&nbsp;in (118&nbsp;mm) armor of ''Gloire'', while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing. Similar problems were experienced with the breech-loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp. 72\u20133.</ref>\n\nThese problems influenced the British to equip ships with muzzle-loading weapons of increasing power until the 1880s. After a brief introduction of 100-pounder or 9.5-inch (240&nbsp;mm) smoothbore Somerset Gun, which weighed 6.5&nbsp;[[long ton|tons]] (6.6 t), the Admiralty introduced 7-inch (178&nbsp;mm) rifled guns, weighing 7&nbsp;tons. These were followed by a series of increasingly mammoth weapons\u2014guns weighing 12, 25, 25, 38 and finally 81&nbsp;tons, with [[caliber|calibre]] increasing from 8-inch (203&nbsp;mm) to 16-inch (406&nbsp;mm).\n\nThe decision to retain muzzle-loaders until the 1880s has been criticised by historians. However, at least until the late 1870s, the British muzzle-loaders had superior performance in terms of both range and rate of fire than the French and Prussian breech-loaders, which suffered from the same problems as had the first Armstrong guns.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp. 73\u20135.</ref>\n[[File:Duilio 1880 003.jpg|thumb|right|Reloading the muzzle-loading guns of {{ship|Italian ironclad|Caio Duilio||2}}]]\n\n[[File:Culasse systeme De Bange before 1923.jpg|thumb|The [[Obturating ring|obturator]] invented by [[Charles Ragon de Bange]] allowed the effective sealing of breeches in breech-loading guns.]]\nFrom 1875 onwards, the balance between breech- and muzzle-loading changed. Captain [[Val\u00e9rand de Bange|de Bange]] invented a method of reliably sealing a breech, adopted by the French in 1873. Just as compellingly, the growing size of naval guns made muzzle-loading much more complicated. With guns of such size there was no prospect of hauling in the gun for re-loading, or even re-loading by hand, and complicated hydraulic systems were required for re-loading the gun outside the turret without exposing the crew to enemy fire. In 1882, the 81-ton, 16-inch (406&nbsp;mm) guns of {{HMS|Inflexible|1876|6}} fired only once every 11&nbsp;minutes while bombarding [[Alexandria]] during the [[Urabi Revolt]].<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp.77\u20138</ref> The 100-ton, 450&nbsp;mm (17.72&nbsp;inch) guns of {{ship|Italian ironclad|Caio Duilio||2}} could each fire a round every 15 minutes.<ref>Brown, D.K. ''The Era of Uncertainty'', in ''Steam Steel and Shellfire'', p. 85.</ref>\n\nIn the Royal Navy, the switch to breech-loaders was finally made in 1879; as well as the significant advantages in terms of performance, opinion was swayed by an explosion on board {{HMS|Thunderer|1872|6}} caused by a gun being double-loaded, a problem which could only happen with a muzzle-loading gun.<ref name=\"Roberts\">Roberts, J \"Warships of Steel 1879\u20131889\" in Gardiner ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire''</ref>\n\nThe calibre and weight of guns could only increase so far. The larger the gun, the slower it would be to load, the greater the stresses on the ship's hull, and the less the stability of the ship. The size of the gun peaked in the 1880s, with some of the heaviest calibres of gun ever used at sea. {{HMS|Benbow|1885|6}} carried two [[BL 16.25 inch Mk I naval gun|16.25-inch (413&nbsp;mm) breech-loading guns]], each weighing 110&nbsp;tons\u2014no British battleship would ever carry guns as large. The Italian 450&nbsp;mm (17.72&nbsp;inch) guns would be larger than any gun fitted to a battleship until the [[40 cm/45 Type 94|18.1-inch (460&nbsp;mm)]] armament of the Japanese {{sclass-|Yamato|battleship|4}} of [[World War II]].<ref>The Royal Navy did build {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on}} guns for the ''Furious''-class battlecruisers, though these ships were finished as aircraft carriers and their guns eventually fitted to the {{sclass-|Lord Clive|monitor|2}}s, seeing service in World War I.</ref> One consideration which became more acute was that even from the original Armstrong models, following the Crimean War, range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy, especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as 'floating weapons-platform' could negate the advantage of rifling.  American ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least 'skip' along the surface of the water.  Actual effective combat ranges, they had learned during the Civil War, were comparable to those in the Age of Sail\u2014though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in only a few rounds.  Smoke and the general chaos of battle only added to the problem. As a result, many naval engagements in the 'Age of the Ironclad' were still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets, and well below the maximum reach of their ships' guns.\n\nAnother method of increasing firepower was to vary the projectile fired or the nature of the propellant. Early ironclads used [[Gunpowder|black powder]], which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant [[cannon]]s had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different [[brown powder]] which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.<ref name=\"Campbell\">Campbell, J \"Naval Armaments and Armour\" in Gardiner ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire'', pp. 158\u201369.</ref>\n\nThe development of [[smokeless powder]], based on nitroglycerine or nitrocellulose, by the French inventor [[Paul Marie Eug\u00e8ne Vieille|Paul Vielle]] in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels. The guns of the [[pre-Dreadnought battleship]]s of the 1890s tended to be smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s, most often 12&nbsp;in (305&nbsp;mm), but progressively grew in length of barrel, making use of improved propellants to gain greater muzzle velocity.<ref name=\"Campbell\"/>\n\nThe nature of the projectiles also changed during the ironclad period. Initially, the best armor-piercing projectile was a solid cast-iron shot. Later, shot of [[chill (foundry)|chilled iron]], a harder iron alloy, gave better armor-piercing qualities. Eventually the [[armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing shell]] was developed.<ref name=\"Campbell\" />\n\n=== Positioning of armament ===\n\n==== Broadside ironclads ====\n{{anchor|Broadside}}\n[[File:HMs warrior1860gundeck.JPG|thumb|upright|The conventional [[broadside]] of [[68-pounder]]s on {{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}} of 1860]]\nThe first British, French and Russian ironclads, in a logical development of warship design from the long preceding era of wooden [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]], carried their weapons in a single line along their sides and so were called \"[[broadside]] ironclads\".<ref>Reed, ''Our Ironclad Ships'' p 4, 45\u201350, 68, 139, 217\u2013221, 224\u20136, 228, 233.</ref><ref name=ConwaysBroadside>''Conways's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860\u20131905'' 7\u201311, 118\u20139, 173, 267\u20138, 286\u20137, 301, 337\u20139, 389.</ref> Both {{ship|French ironclad|Gloire||2}} and {{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}} were examples of this type. Because their armor was so heavy, they could only carry a single row of guns along the main deck on each side rather than a row on each deck.<ref name=\"Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 73\u20134\"/>\n\nA significant number of broadside ironclads were built in the 1860s, principally in Britain and France, but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy, Austria, Russia and the United States.<ref name=ConwaysBroadside/> The advantages of mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one adversary at a time, and the rigging did not impede the field of fire.<ref name=\"Beeler-91\">Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp. 91\u20133.</ref>\n\nBroadside armament also had disadvantages, which became more serious as ironclad technology developed. Heavier guns to penetrate ever-thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried. Furthermore, the adoption of ramming as an important tactic meant the need for ahead and all-round fire.<ref>[[Gerard H U Noel|Noel, Gerard H U]] et al., ''The Gun, Ram and Torpedo, Manoeuvres and tactics of a Naval Battle of the Present Day'', 2nd Edition, pub Griffin 1885.</ref> These problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater all-round fire, which included central-battery, turret, and barbette designs.<ref name=\"Beeler-91\"/>\n\n==== Turrets, batteries and barbettes ====\n[[File:Redoutable-barbette.jpg|thumb|A [[barbette]] of {{ship|French ironclad|Redoutable||2}}]]\n[[File:Le Vauban (cuirass\u00e9).jpg|thumb|230px|Barbette of the French ironclad ''Vauban'' (1882\u20131905)]]\n\nThere were two main design alternatives to the broadside. In one design, the guns were placed in an armored casemate amidships: this arrangement was called the 'box-battery' or 'centre-battery'. In the other, the guns could be placed on a rotating platform to give them a broad field of fire; when fully armored, this arrangement was called a [[Gun turret|turret]] and when partially armored or unarmored, a [[barbette]].\n\nThe [[central battery ship|centre-battery]] was the simpler and, during the 1860s and 1870s, the more popular method. Concentrating guns amidships meant the ship could be shorter and handier than a broadside type. The first full-scale centre-battery ship was {{HMS|Bellerophon|1865|6}} of 1865; the French laid down centre-battery ironclads in 1865 which were not completed until 1870. Centre-battery ships often, but not always, had a recessed freeboard enabling some of their guns to fire directly ahead.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 87.</ref>\n\nThe turret was first used in naval combat on the USS ''Monitor'' in 1862, with a type of turret designed by the Swedish engineer [[John Ericsson]]. A competing turret design was proposed by the British inventor [[Cowper Coles]] with a prototype of this installed on [[HMS Trusty (1855)|HMS ''Trusty'']] in 1861 for testing and evaluation purposes. Ericsson's turret turned on a central spindle, and Coles's turned on a ring of bearings.<ref name = \"Campbell\"/> Turrets offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns, but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s.  The fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging, so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean-going ironclads.  The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy.  Ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret (guns and armor protection) by deliberately designing a ship with very low freeboard.  The weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armor.  Low freeboard, however, also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage\u2014and therefore range of the vessel.  In many respects, the turreted, low-freeboard ''Monitor'' and the broadside sailer HMS ''Warrior'' represented two opposite extremes in what an 'Ironclad' was all about.  The most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes, or 'squaring this circle', was designed by Captain Cowper Phipps Coles: [[HMS Captain (1869)|HMS ''Captain'']], a dangerously low freeboard turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail, and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in 1870. Her half-sister {{HMS|Monarch|1868|6}} was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams. The third Royal Navy ship to combine turrets and masts was {{HMS|Inflexible|1876|6}} of 1876, which carried two turrets on either side of the centre-line, allowing both to fire fore, aft and broadside.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' p. 122.</ref>\n\nA lighter alternative to the turret, particularly popular with the French navy, was the barbette. These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turntable. The crew was sheltered from direct fire, but vulnerable to [[plunging fire]], for instance from shore emplacements. The barbette was lighter than the turret, needing less machinery and no roof armor\u2014though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top-weight of their ships. The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s, and with the addition of an armored 'gun-house', transformed into the turrets of the pre-Dreadnought battleships.<ref name = \"Campbell\"/>\n\n=== Torpedoes ===\nThe ironclad age saw the development of explosive [[torpedo]]es as naval weapons, which helped complicate the design and tactics of ironclad fleets. The first torpedoes were static [[naval mine|mines]], used extensively in the American Civil War. That conflict also saw the development of the [[spar torpedo]], an explosive charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat. For the first time, a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one\u2014and given the relative inefficiency of shellfire against ironclads, the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously. The U.S. Navy converted four of its monitors to become turretless armored spar-torpedo vessels while under construction in 1864\u20135, but these vessels never saw action.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 83.</ref> Another proposal, the towed or 'Harvey' torpedo, involved an explosive on a line or outrigger; either to deter a ship from ramming or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less suicidal.\n\nA more practical and influential weapon was the self-propelled or [[Whitehead torpedo]].  Invented in 1868 and deployed in the 1870s, the Whitehead torpedo formed part of the armament of ironclads of the 1880s like HMS ''Inflexible'' and the Italian ''Caio Duilio'' and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Enrico Dandolo||2}}. The ironclad's vulnerability to the torpedo was a key part of the critique of armored warships made by the [[Jeune Ecole]] school of naval thought; it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent destruction by gunfire would be slow enough to be easily caught by torpedo. In practice, however, the Jeune Ecole was only briefly influential and the torpedo formed part of the confusing mixture of weapons possessed by ironclads.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 156.</ref>\n\n== Armor and construction ==\n[[File:LeRedoutablePhoto.jpg|thumb|The French {{ship|French ironclad|Redoutable||2}} (1876), the first battleship to use steel as the main building material]]\n\nThe first ironclads were built on wooden or iron hulls, and protected by wrought iron armor backed by thick wooden planking.  Ironclads were still being built with wooden hulls into the 1870s.\n\n=== Hulls: iron, wood and steel ===\nUsing iron construction for warships offered advantages for the engineering of the hull. However, unarmored iron had many military disadvantages, and offered technical problems which kept wooden hulls in use for many years, particularly for long-range cruising warships.\n\nIron ships had first been proposed for military use in the 1820s. In the 1830s and 1840s, France, Britain and the United States had all experimented with iron-hulled but unarmored gunboats and frigates. However, the iron-hulled frigate was abandoned by the end of the 1840s, because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot; iron was more brittle than wood, and iron frames more likely to fall out of shape than wood.<ref>Lambert ''Battleships in Transition'', p. 19.</ref>\n\nThe unsuitability of unarmored iron for warship hulls meant that iron was only adopted as a building material for battleships when protected by armor. However, iron gave the naval architect many advantages. Iron allowed larger ships and more flexible design, for instance the use of watertight bulkheads on the lower decks. ''Warrior'', built of iron, was longer and faster than the wooden-hulled ''Gloire''.  Iron could be produced to order and used immediately, in contrast to the need to give wood a long period of [[seasoning (wood)|seasoning]]. And, given the large quantities of wood required to build a steam warship and the falling cost of iron, iron hulls were increasingly cost-effective. The main reason for the French use of wooden hulls for the ironclad fleet built in the 1860s was that the French iron industry could not supply enough, and the main reason why Britain built its handful of wooden-hulled ironclads was to make best use of hulls already started and wood already bought.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp. 30\u20136.</ref>\n\nWooden hulls continued to be used for long-range and smaller ironclads, because iron nevertheless had a significant disadvantage.  Iron hulls suffered quick [[fouling]] by marine life, slowing the ships down\u2014manageable for a European battlefleet close to [[dry dock]]s, but a difficulty for long-range ships. The only solution was to sheath the iron hull first in wood and then in copper, a laborious and expensive process which made wooden construction remain attractive.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp. 32\u20133.</ref> Iron and wood were to some extent interchangeable: the Japanese {{ship|Japanese ironclad|Kong\u014d||2}} and {{ship|Japanese ironclad|Hiei||2}} ordered in 1875 were sister-ships, but one was built of iron and the other of composite construction.<ref>Jenschura Jung & Mickel, ''Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy'', {{ISBN|0-85368-151-1}}.</ref>\n\nAfter 1872, steel started to be introduced as a material for construction. Compared to [[iron]], [[steel]] allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight. The French Navy led the way with the use of steel in its fleet, starting with the {{ship|French ironclad|Redoutable||2}}, laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876.<ref>Gardiner, \"Steam, Steel and Shellfire\", p.96</ref> ''Redoutable'' nonetheless had wrought iron armor plate, and part of her exterior hull was iron rather than steel.\n\nEven though Britain led the world in steel production, the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel warships. The [[Bessemer process]] for steel manufacture produced too many imperfections for large-scale use on ships. French manufacturers used the [[Siemens-Martin process]] to produce adequate steel, but British technology lagged behind.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp. 37\u201341.</ref> The first all-steel warships built by the [[Royal Navy]] were the dispatch vessels ''Iris'' and ''Mercury'', laid down in 1875 and 1876.\n\n=== Armor and protection schemes ===\n[[File:HMS Warrior (1860) bulkhead armour.jpg|thumb|upright|The iron-and-wood armor of {{HMS|Warrior|1860|2}}]]\n\nIron-built ships used wood as part of their protection scheme.  HMS ''Warrior'' was protected by 4.5&nbsp;in (114&nbsp;mm) of [[wrought iron]] backed by 15&nbsp;in (381&nbsp;mm) of [[teak]], the strongest shipbuilding wood. The wood played two roles, preventing [[spalling]] and also preventing the shock of a hit damaging the structure of the ship. Later, wood and iron were combined in 'sandwich' armor, for instance in {{HMS|Inflexible|1876|6}}.<ref>Hill, ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'' p. 39.</ref>\n\nSteel was also an obvious material for armor. It was tested in the 1860s, but the steel of the time was too [[brittle]] and disintegrated when struck by shells.  Steel became practical to use when a way was found to fuse steel onto wrought iron plates, giving a form of [[compound armor]].  This compound armor was used by the British in ships built from the late 1870s, first for turret armor (starting with HMS ''Inflexible'') and then for all armor (starting with {{HMS|Colossus|1882|6}} of 1882).<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' p. 45.</ref>  The French and German navies adopted the innovation almost immediately, with licenses being given for the use of the 'Wilson System' of producing fused armor.<ref name = \"Sondhaus 164-5\">Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 164\u20135.</ref>\n\nThe first ironclads to have all-steel armor were the Italian {{ship|Italian ironclad|Caio Duilio||2}} and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Enrico Dandolo||2}}. Though the ships were laid down in 1873 their armor was not purchased from France until 1877. The French navy decided in 1880 to adopt compound armor for its fleet, but found it limited in supply, so from 1884 the French navy was using steel armor.<ref name = \"Sondhaus 164-5\" /> Britain stuck to compound armor until 1889.\n\nThe ultimate ironclad armor was [[case hardening|case hardened]] nickel-steel. In 1890, the U.S. Navy tested steel armor hardened by the [[Harvey process]] and found it superior to compound armor.  For several years 'Harvey steel' was the state of the art, produced in the U.S., France, Germany, Britain, Austria and Italy. In 1894, the German firm [[Krupp]] developed [[Krupp armour|gas cementing]], which further hardened steel armor. The German {{SMS|Kaiser Friedrich III||2}}, laid down in 1895, was the first ship to benefit from the new 'Krupp armor' and the new armor was quickly adopted; the Royal Navy using it from {{HMS|Canopus|1897|6}}, laid down in 1896. By 1901 almost all new battleships used Krupp armor, though the U.S. continued to use Harvey armor alongside until the end of the decade.\n\nThe equivalent strengths of the different armor plates was as follows: 15&nbsp;in (381&nbsp;mm) of wrought iron was equivalent to 12&nbsp;in (305&nbsp;mm) of either plain steel or compound iron and steel armor, and to 7.75&nbsp;in (197&nbsp;mm) of Harvey armor or 5.75&nbsp;in (146&nbsp;mm) of Krupp armor.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 166.</ref>\n\nIronclad construction also prefigured the later debate in battleship design between tapering and 'all-or-nothing' armor design. ''Warrior'' was only semi-armored, and could have been disabled by hits on the bow and stern.<ref>Reed \"Our Iron Clad Ships\", pp. 45\u20137.</ref> As the thickness of armor grew to protect ships from the increasingly heavy guns, the area of the ship which could be fully protected diminished.  ''Inflexible''{{'}}s armor protection was largely limited to the central citadel amidships, protecting boilers and engines, turrets and magazines, and little else. An ingenious arrangement of cork-filled compartments and watertight bulkheads was intended to keep her stable and afloat in the event of heavy damage to her un-armored sections.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp. 133\u20134.</ref>\n\n== Propulsion: steam and sail ==\n[[File:Gloire.jpg|thumb|left|{{ship|French ironclad|Gloire||2}} under sail]]\nThe first ocean-going ironclads carried masts and sails like their wooden predecessors, and these features were only gradually abandoned. Early steam engines were inefficient; the wooden steam fleet of the Royal Navy could only carry \"5 to 9 days coal\",<ref name=\"Beeler-54\">Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' p. 54.</ref> and the situation was similar with the early ironclads. ''Warrior'' also illustrates two design features which aided hybrid propulsion; she had retractable screws to reduce drag while under sail (though in practice the steam engine was run at a low throttle), and a telescopic funnel which could be folded down to the deck level.<ref>Hill, ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'' p. 44.</ref>\n\n[[File:Arrogante 1864.jpg|thumb|French armored [[floating battery]] {{ship|French ship|Arrogante|1864|3}}.]]\nShips designed for coastal warfare, like the floating batteries of the Crimea, or {{USS|Monitor}} and her sisters, dispensed with masts from the beginning. The British {{HMS|Devastation|1871|6}}, started in 1869, was the first large, ocean-going ironclad to dispense with masts. Her principal role was for combat in the English Channel and other European waters; while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the Atlantic, she would have had little endurance on the other side of the ocean. The ''Devastation'' and the similar ships commissioned by the British and Russian navies in the 1870s were the exception rather than the rule. Most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts, and only the Italian navy, which during that decade was focused on short-range operations in the Adriatic,<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 111\u20132.</ref> built consistently mastless ironclads.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp. 63\u20134.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1860s, steam engines improved with the adoption of [[Steam engine#Compounding engines|double-expansion]] steam engines, which used 30\u201340% less coal than earlier models. The Royal Navy decided to switch to the double-expansion engine in 1871, and by 1875 they were widespread.  However, this development alone was not enough to herald the end of the mast.  Whether this was due to a conservative desire to retain sails, or was a rational response to the operational and strategic situation, is a matter of debate. A steam-only fleet would require a network of coaling stations worldwide, which would need to be fortified at great expense to stop them falling into enemy hands. Just as significantly, because of unsolved problems with the technology of the boilers which provided steam for the engines, the performance of double-expansion engines was rarely as good in practice as it was in theory.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' pp. 57\u201362.</ref>\n[[File:HMS Inflexible (1881).jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Inflexible|1876|6}}, after the replacement of her sailing masts with 'military masts']]\n\nDuring the 1870s the distinction grew between 'first-class ironclads' or 'battleships' on the one hand, and 'cruising ironclads' designed for long-range work on the other. The demands on first-class ironclads for very heavy armor and armament meant increasing displacement, which reduced speed under sail; and the fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly inconvenient. {{HMS|Inflexible|1876|6}}, launched in 1876 but not commissioned until 1881, was the last British battleship to carry masts, and these were widely seen as a mistake. The start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing rig on ironclad battleships.<ref name=\"Beeler-54\"/>\n\nSails persisted on 'cruising ironclads' for much longer. During the 1860s, the French navy had produced the {{sclass-|Alma|ironclad|5}} and {{sclass-|La Galissonni\u00e8re|ironclad|4}}es as small, long-range ironclads as overseas cruisers<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 88.</ref> and the British had responded with ships like {{HMS|Swiftsure|1870|6}} of 1870. The Russian ship {{ship|Russian cruiser|General-Admiral||2}}, laid down in 1870 and completed in 1875, was a model of a fast, long-range ironclad which was likely to be able to outrun and outfight ships like ''Swiftsure''. Even the later {{HMS|Shannon|1875|6}}, often described as the first British armored cruiser, would have been too slow to outrun ''General-Admiral''. While ''Shannon'' was the last British ship with a retractable propellor, later armored cruisers of the 1870s retained sailing rig, sacrificing speed under steam in consequence. It took until 1881 for the Royal Navy to lay down a long-range armored warship capable of catching enemy commerce raiders, {{HMS|Warspite|1884|6}}, which was completed in 1888.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' p. 194.</ref> While sailing rigs were obsolescent for all purposes by the end of the 1880s, rigged ships were in service until the early years of the 20th century.\n\nThe final evolution of ironclad propulsion was the adoption of the triple-expansion steam engine, a further refinement which was first adopted in {{HMS|Sans Pareil|1887|6}}, laid down in 1885 and commissioned in 1891. Many ships also used a [[forced draught]] to get additional power from their engines, and this system was widely used until the introduction of the [[steam turbine]] in the mid-1900s (decade).<ref name=\"Machinery\">Griffiths, D \"Warship Machinery\" in Gardiner ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire''.</ref>\n\n== Fleets ==\nWhile ironclads spread rapidly in navies worldwide, there were few pitched naval battles involving ironclads. Most European nations settled differences on land, and the [[Royal Navy]] struggled to maintain a deterrent parity with at least France, while providing suitable protection to Britain's commerce and colonial outposts worldwide.  Ironclads remained, for the British Royal Navy, a matter of defending the British Isles first and projecting power abroad second.  Those naval engagements of the latter half of the 19th century which involved ironclads normally involved colonial actions or clashes between second-rate naval powers.  But these encounters were often enough to convince British policy-makers of the increasing hazards of strictly naval foreign intervention, from Hampton Roads in the American Civil War to the hardening combined defences of naval arsenals such as Kronstadt and Cherbourg.\n\nThere were many types of ironclads:<ref>Conway, ''All the World's Fighting Ships 1860\u20131905'', Conway Maritime Press, 1979.  {{ISBN|0-8317-0302-4}}.</ref>\n* Seagoing ships intended to \"stand in the line of battle\"; the precursors of the [[battleship]].<ref>This term was still in use in the 1860s and 1970s for what we would now call 'battleships'.

The [[Royal Navy]] was the second to adopt ironclad warships, and it applied them worldwide in their whole range of roles. In the age of sail, the British strategy for war depended on the Royal Navy mounting a blockade of the ports of the enemy. Because of the limited endurance of steamships, this was no longer possible, so the British at times considered the risk-laden plan of engaging an enemy fleet in harbor as soon as war broke out. To this end, the Royal Navy developed a series of 'coast-defence battleships', starting with the ''Devastation'' class. These '[[monitor (warship)|breastwork monitors]]' were markedly different from the other high-seas ironclads of the period and were an important precursor of the modern battleship.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' p. 204.</ref> As long-range monitors they could reach Bermuda unescorted, for example. However, they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and obstructions (and enemy monitors) as the original monitors of the Union Navy proved to be during the Civil War. The British prepared for an overwhelming mortar bombardment of Kronstadt by the close of the Crimean War, but never considered running the smoke-ridden, shallow-water gauntlet straight to St. Petersburg with ironclads. Likewise, monitors proved acutely unable to 'overwhelm' enemy fortifications single-handed during the American conflict, though their low-profile and heavy armor protection made them ideal for running gauntlets. Mines and obstructions, however, negated these advantages\u2014a problem the British Admiralty frequently acknowledged but never countered throughout the period. The British never laid down enough ''Devastation''-class 'battleships' to instantly overwhelm Cherbourg, Kronstadt or even New York City with gunfire. Although throughout the 1860s and 1870s the Royal Navy was still in many respects superior to its potential rivals, by the early 1880s widespread concern about the threat from France and Germany culminated in the [[Naval Defence Act 1889|Naval Defence Act]], which promulgated the idea of a 'two-power standard', that Britain should possess as many ships as the next two navies combined. This standard provoked aggressive shipbuilding in the 1880s and 1890s.<ref name=\"Kennedy\">Kennedy, Paul M. ''The Rise and Fall of British Naval Mastery'', [[Macmillan Publishers]], London, 1983. {{ISBN|0-333-35094-4}}, pp. 178\u201379.</ref>\n\nBritish ships did not participate in any major wars in the ironclad period. The Royal Navy's ironclads only saw action as part of colonial battles or one-sided engagements like the [[bombardment of Alexandria]] in 1882. Defending British interests against [[Ahmed 'Urabi]]'s [[Urabi Revolt|Egyptian revolt]], a British fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port of Alexandria. A mixture of centre-battery and turret ships bombarded Egyptian positions for most of a day, forcing the [[Egyptians]] to retreat; return fire from Egyptian guns was heavy at first, but inflicted little damage, killing only five British sailors.<ref>Hill, ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'' p. 185.</ref> Few Egyptian guns were actually dismounted, on the other hand, and the fortifications themselves were typically left intact. Had the Egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars that were at their disposal, they might have quickly turned the tide, for the attacking British ironclads found it easy (for accuracy's sake) to simply anchor whilst firing\u2014perfect targets for high-angle fire upon their thinly armored topdecks.\n\nThe French navy built the first ironclad to try to gain a strategic advantage over the British, but were consistently out-built by the British. Despite taking the lead with a number of innovations like [[breech-loading weapon]]s and steel construction, the French navy could never match the size of the Royal Navy. In the 1870s, the construction of ironclads ceased for a while in France as the [[Jeune Ecole]] school of naval thought took prominence, suggesting that [[torpedo boat]]s and unarmored [[cruisers]] would be the future of warships. Like the British, the French navy saw little action with its ironclads; the French blockade of Germany in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] was ineffective, as the war was settled entirely on land.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' p. 101.</ref>\n\nRussia built a number of ironclads, generally copies of British or French designs. Nonetheless, there were real innovations from Russia; the first true type of ironclad [[armored cruiser]], ''General-Admiral'' of the 1870s, and a set of remarkably badly designed [[Russian monitor Novgorod|circular battleships]] referred to as 'popovkas' (for [[Andrei Alexandrovich Popov|Admiral Popov]], who conceived the design). The Russian Navy pioneered the wide-scale use of torpedo boats during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878]], mainly out of necessity because of the superior numbers and quality of ironclads used by the Turkish navy.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 122\u20136.</ref> Russia expanded her navy in the 1880s and 1890s with modern armored cruisers and battleships, but the ships were manned by inexperienced crews and politically appointed leadership, which enhanced their defeat in the [[Battle of Tsushima]] on 27 May 1905.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 187\u201391.</ref>\n\n[[File:Sinking of the Esmeralda during the battle of Iquique.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Iquique]], where Peruvian ironclad {{ship||Hu\u00e1scar|ironclad|2}} sunk the Chilean wooden corvette [[Esmeralda (1855)|''Esmeralda'']].]]\nThe US Navy ended the Civil War with about fifty [[monitor (warship)|monitor]]-type coastal ironclads; by the 1870s most of these were laid up in reserve, leaving the United States virtually without an ironclad fleet. Another five large monitors were ordered in the 1870s. The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the US from projecting power overseas, and until the 1890s the United States would have come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers. The 1890s saw the beginning of what became the [[Great White Fleet]], and it was the modern pre-Dreadnoughts and armored cruisers built in the 1890s which defeated the Spanish fleet in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898. This started a new era of naval warfare.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 126\u201328 173\u201379.</ref>\n\n[[File:BAP Loa blindado.jpg|thumb|left|[[List of Peruvian Navy ships#Minor Warships|''Loa'']] being fitted after its conversion in the Callao harbour, 1864]]\nIronclads were widely used in South America. Both sides used ironclads in the [[Chincha Islands War]] between Spain and the combined forces of [[Peru]] and [[Chile]] in the early 1860s. The powerful Spanish {{ship|Spanish ironclad|Numancia||2}} participated in the [[Battle of Callao]] but was unable to inflict significant damage upon the Callao defences. Besides, Peru was able to deploy two locally built ironclads based on American Civil War designs,<ref>Historia naval del Per\u00fa. Tomo IV, Valdiz\u00e1n Gamio, Jos\u00e9.</ref> ''Loa'' (a wooden ship converted into a casemate ironclad) and {{ship|BAP|Victoria||2}} (a small monitor armed with a single 68-pdr gun), as well as two British-built ironclads: {{ship|Peruvian ironclad|Independencia||2}}, a centre-battery ship, and the turret ship {{ship||Hu\u00e1scar|ironclad|2}}. ''Numancia'', a Spanish ship led by Casto M\u00e9ndez N\u00fa\u00f1ez, was the first ironclad to circumnavigate the world, arriving in [[C\u00e1diz]] on 20 September 1867, and earning the motto: \"Enloricata navis que primo terram circuivit\" [\"First ironclad ship to sail around the world\"]). In the [[War of the Pacific]] in 1879, both Peru and Chile had ironclad warships, including some of those used a few years previously against Spain. While ''Independencia'' ran aground early on, the Peruvian ironclad {{ship||Hu\u00e1scar|ironclad|2}} made a great impact against Chilean shipping, delaying Chilean ground invasion by six months. She was eventually caught by two more modern Chilean centre-battery ironclads, {{ship|Chilean ironclad|Blanco Encalada||2}} and {{ship|Chilean ironclad|Almirante Cochrane||2}} at the [[Battle of Angamos]] Point.<ref>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare 1815\u20131914'' pp. 97\u201399, 127\u201332.</ref>\n[[File:PrinzAdalbertBordeaux.jpg|thumb|left|The Confederacy's French-built ironclad ''Cheops'' (sister ship to CSS ''Stonewall'') later the Prussian navy's {{SMS|Prinz Adalbert|1865|6}}]]\n[[File:Stonewall-Kotetsu.jpg|thumb|The Confederacy's French-built last ironclad was also Japan's first: [[Japanese ironclad K\u014dtetsu|''Stonewall'' was later renamed ''K\u014dtetsu'']].]]\n\nIronclads were also used from the inception of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN). {{ship|Japanese ironclad|K\u014dtetsu||2}} (Japanese: \u7532\u9244, literally \"Ironclad\", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \"East\") had a decisive role in the [[Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay]] in May 1869, which marked the end of the [[Boshin War]], and the complete establishment of the [[Meiji Restoration]]. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later [[armored cruiser]]s. These ships engaged the Chinese [[Beiyang fleet]] which was superior on paper at least at the [[Battle of Yalu River (1894)|Battle of the Yalu River]]. Thanks to superior short-range firepower, the Japanese fleet came off better, sinking or severely damaging eight ships and receiving serious damage to only four. The naval war was concluded the next year at the [[Battle of Weihaiwei]], where the strongest remaining Chinese ships were surrendered to the Japanese.<ref>Hill, ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'' p. 191.</ref>\n\n== End of the ironclad warship ==\n{{main|Battleship}}\nThere is no clearly defined end to the ironclad, besides the transition from wood hulls to all-metal. Ironclads continued to be used in World War I. Towards the end of the 19th century, the descriptions '[[battleship]]' and '[[armored cruiser]]' came to replace the term 'ironclad'.<ref>Beeler, ''Birth of the Battleship: British Capital Ship Design 1870\u20131881'' p. 154 states that {{HMS|Edinburgh|1882|6}} was the first British capital ship to be routinely called a battleship.</ref>\n\nThe proliferation of ironclad battleship designs came to an end in the 1890s as navies reached a consensus on the design of battleships, producing the type known as the [[pre-Dreadnought]]. These ships are sometimes covered in treatments of the ironclad warship. The next evolution of battleship design, the [[dreadnought]], is never referred to as an 'ironclad'.<ref>Hill, ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'' p. 18.</ref>\n\nMost of the ironclads of the 1870s and 1880s served into the first decades of the 1900s. For instance, a handful of US navy monitors laid down in the 1870s saw active service in World War I. Pre-Dreadnought battleships and cruisers of the 1890s saw widespread action in World War I and in some cases through to World War II.\n\n=== Legacy ===\n[[File:HG Wells Land Ironclads 1904.jpg|thumb|1904 illustration of [[H.G.

Robinson's full description: \"Five minutes below the top of the pass on the other side is the mouth of a lateral valley on the left, coming down nearly from the south. We entered and followed this up to its head in a pretty and well cultivated basin among the hills. On the steep declivity and ridge above it in the south-west, is situated the large village Um el-Fahm; to which we came at 12 o\u2019clock. The ridge is narrow; and south of it a deep valley runs out to the western plain. The side valley which we had ascended, is likewise separated from the valley we left only by a ridge; on the southern end of this latter is the village. It thus overlooks the whole country towards the west; with a fine prospect of the plain and sea, and also of Carmel; with glimpses of the Plain of [[Esdraelon]], and a view of [[Mount Tabor|Tabor]] and Little Hermon beyond. There was, however, a haze in the atmosphere, which prevented us from distinguishing the villages in the plain.\nThere were said to be in Um el-Fahm twenty or thirty families of Christians; some said more. Outside of the village, near the western brow, was a cemetery. Here too was a threshing-sledge; in form like the stone-sledge of New England; made of three planks, each a foot wide; with holes thickly bored in the bottom, into which were driven projecting bits of black volcanic stone. The village belongs to the government of Jenin. They had hitherto paid their taxes at so much a head; but the governor had recently taken an account of their land, horses, and stock; with the purpose, as was supposed, of exacting the tithe. Twenty-five men had been taken as soldiers under the conscription.\" Cited in Zertal, 2016, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XytzCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA116 116]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=XytzCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA117 117]\n</ref>\n\nIn 1870, [[Victor Gu\u00e9rin]] found it had 1800 inhabitants and was surrounded by beautiful gardens.<ref>Gu\u00e9rin,  1875, p. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongogr04gugoog#page/n264/mode/1up 239]</ref>\n\nIn 1872, [[Charles Tyrwhitt-Drake]] noted that Umm al-Fahm was  \"divided into four quarters, El Jebarin, El Mahamin, El Maj\u2019ahineh, and El Akbar\u2019iyeh, each of which has its own sheikh.\"<ref>Tyrwhitt-Drake, 1873, pp.[https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme05pale#page/n37/mode/1up 28]\u201329. He further noted: \"There are some fifteen houses of Christians, which represent a total of about eighty souls. These are mostly birds of passage, who \u2018squat\u2019 wherever and as long as, they find it convenient, and then flit \u2018to fresh fields and pastures new\u2019. The natives are an unruly lot, who never paid taxes till within the last few years, and who have not yet learnt the lesson of subjection. Some days ago a man tried to seize my horse\u2019s bridle as I was passing near a threshing-floor, and insolently told me to be off, at the same time making as though he would strike me; but, seeing then that he had gone rather too far, took to his heels and fled. After a suspense of three or four days, I consented, at the intercession of two of the sheikhs, the kadi, and other village worthies, not to have the man imprisoned at Jen\u2019in [sic], so he was brought and solemnly beaten before my tent door by the sheikh of his quarter. As civility in this country is induced by fear and a sense of inferiority, we shall probably be treated with decent respect for some little time to come. One cause of the villagers\u2019 unruliness is their wealth: they possess large herds of cattle and flocks of goats, a very considerable number of horses, and more than the normal quantity of camels and donkeys. Their land comprises a wide tract of thicket (called Umm el Khattaf, \u2018Mother of the Ravisher,\u2019 from the dense growth which, as it were, seizes and holds those who try to pass through it) to the south and east, arable hills to the west, and virtually as much of the rich plain of [[Esdraelon]] (Merj ibn \u2018Amir) as they choose to cultivate. Besides all this, the village owns some twenty or more springs, under whose immediate influence orange and lemon trees flourish. [[Pomelo|Shaddock]]s [citrus fruit] grow to an enormous size; I have one now in the tent whose circumference lengthwise is 2ft. 61\u20442 in, and its girth 2ft. 31\u20442 in; weight, about eight or nine pounds; and tomatoes, cucumbers, and other thirsty vegetables flourish. The taxes paid by the village amount to 23,000 piasters, or \u00a3185 sterling, in addition to the [[poll-tax]] on sheep, goats, and cattle, which probably comes to \u00a320 or more.\u201d Cited in Zertal, 2016, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XytzCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA118 118]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=XytzCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA119 119]</ref>\n\nIn 1883,  the [[Palestine Exploration Fund|PEF]]'s [[PEF Survey of Palestine|Survey of Western Palestine]] described Umm al-Fahm as having around 500 inhabitants, of which some 80 people were Christians. The place was well-built of stone, and the villagers were described as being very rich in cattle, goats and horses. It was the most important place in the area besides [[Jenin]]. The village was divided into four quarters, ''el Jebarin'', ''el Mahamin'', ''el Mejahineh'', and ''el Akbariyeh'', each quarter having its own [[sheikh]].

Robinson's full description: \"Five minutes below the top of the pass on the other side is the mouth of a lateral valley on the left, coming down nearly from the south. We entered and followed this up to its head in a pretty and well cultivated basin among the hills. On the steep declivity and ridge above it in the south-west, is situated the large village Um el-Fahm; to which we came at 12 o\u2019clock. The ridge is narrow; and south of it a deep valley runs out to the western plain. The side valley which we had ascended, is likewise separated from the valley we left only by a ridge; on the southern end of this latter is the village. It thus overlooks the whole country towards the west; with a fine prospect of the plain and sea, and also of Carmel; with glimpses of the Plain of [[Esdraelon]], and a view of [[Mount Tabor|Tabor]] and Little Hermon beyond. There was, however, a haze in the atmosphere, which prevented us from distinguishing the villages in the plain.\nThere were said to be in Um el-Fahm twenty or thirty families of Christians; some said more. Outside of the village, near the western brow, was a cemetery. Here too was a threshing-sledge; in form like the stone-sledge of New England; made of three planks, each a foot wide; with holes thickly bored in the bottom, into which were driven projecting bits of black volcanic stone. The village belongs to the government of Jenin. They had hitherto paid their taxes at so much a head; but the governor had recently taken an account of their land, horses, and stock; with the purpose, as was supposed, of exacting the tithe. Twenty-five men had been taken as soldiers under the conscription.\" Cited in Zertal, 2016, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XytzCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA116 116]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=XytzCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA117 117]\n</ref>\n\nIn 1870, [[Victor Gu\u00e9rin]] found it had 1800 inhabitants and was surrounded by beautiful gardens.<ref>Gu\u00e9rin,  1875, p.

He further noted: \"There are some fifteen houses of Christians, which represent a total of about eighty souls. These are mostly birds of passage, who \u2018squat\u2019 wherever and as long as, they find it convenient, and then flit \u2018to fresh fields and pastures new\u2019. The natives are an unruly lot, who never paid taxes till within the last few years, and who have not yet learnt the lesson of subjection. Some days ago a man tried to seize my horse\u2019s bridle as I was passing near a threshing-floor, and insolently told me to be off, at the same time making as though he would strike me; but, seeing then that he had gone rather too far, took to his heels and fled. After a suspense of three or four days, I consented, at the intercession of two of the sheikhs, the kadi, and other village worthies, not to have the man imprisoned at Jen\u2019in [sic], so he was brought and solemnly beaten before my tent door by the sheikh of his quarter. As civility in this country is induced by fear and a sense of inferiority, we shall probably be treated with decent respect for some little time to come. One cause of the villagers\u2019 unruliness is their wealth: they possess large herds of cattle and flocks of goats, a very considerable number of horses, and more than the normal quantity of camels and donkeys. Their land comprises a wide tract of thicket (called Umm el Khattaf, \u2018Mother of the Ravisher,\u2019 from the dense growth which, as it were, seizes and holds those who try to pass through it) to the south and east, arable hills to the west, and virtually as much of the rich plain of [[Esdraelon]] (Merj ibn \u2018Amir) as they choose to cultivate. Besides all this, the village owns some twenty or more springs, under whose immediate influence orange and lemon trees flourish. [[Pomelo|Shaddock]]s [citrus fruit] grow to an enormous size; I have one now in the tent whose circumference lengthwise is 2ft. 61\u20442 in, and its girth 2ft. 31\u20442 in; weight, about eight or nine pounds; and tomatoes, cucumbers, and other thirsty vegetables flourish. The taxes paid by the village amount to 23,000 piasters, or \u00a3185 sterling, in addition to the [[poll-tax]] on sheep, goats, and cattle, which probably comes to \u00a320 or more.\u201d Cited in Zertal, 2016, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XytzCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA118 118]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=XytzCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA119 119]</ref>\n\nIn 1883,  the [[Palestine Exploration Fund|PEF]]'s [[PEF Survey of Palestine|Survey of Western Palestine]] described Umm al-Fahm as having around 500 inhabitants, of which some 80 people were Christians.
