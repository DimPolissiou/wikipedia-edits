The building was built on land purchased by Stokes, and was completed in 1892.  It was not formally turned over to the city for four years, over disagreements between the family and the city over control of the library and the need for a maintenance fund.

Recognizing the need for access to materials and facilities beyond the Downtown Library, Chance opened the first branch library in Ann Arbor, the Loving Branch, in 1965. In 1977, the West Branch (now called \"Westgate\") opened its doors. The Northeast Branch began serving the community in 1981.\n\nExpansion continued in 2004 with the opening of the Malletts Creek Branch as a replacement for the Loving Branch. This branch is a unique model of sustainable design featuring solar heating, natural day lighting, a vegetated green roof, convection cooling, naturally captured and filtered storm water, native plants and grasses, and many uses of materials that are renewable resources. The Malletts Creek Branch was awarded the 2005 American Institute of Architects Michigan (AIA Michigan) Award for Sustainable Design.<ref>[http://www.aiami.com/aiami_design_awards/DA_2005/honor_awards_05_home.htm 2005 AIA Michigan Design Award Winners] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705032013/http://www.aiami.com/aiami_design_awards/DA_2005/honor_awards_05_home.htm |date=July 5, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, AADL opened the Pittsfield Branch, a community-based learning center serving the residents of the southwest quadrant of Ann Arbor and Pittsfield Township. This branch, along with its surrounding landscape, capitalizes on environmental principles, allowing the overall project to operate more in harmony with the ecosystem and the community in which it serves.\n\nOn June 30, 2008 the Traverwood Branch opened, replacing the Northeast Branch.  The Traverwood Branch is designed to have as little impact on natural landscape features as possible. Sustainable design features include an innovative stormwater management system and the reuse of harvested ash trees from the building site. A [[rain garden]] is located on the south side of the building. The design of the Branch takes advantage of natural day lighting.\n\nSince 2004, the Library's branch expansion program has emphasized [[sustainability]]. By using sustainable design in the construction of each branch, the Library will teach, by example, responsible coexistence with the natural environment.\n\nThe West Branch closed for renovation in November 2015, reopening in September 2016 as the Westgate Branch.
