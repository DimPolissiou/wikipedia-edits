This version of the Frankenstones  continued to appear throughout the run of the prime-time specials: ''[[The Flintstones: Fred's Final Fling|Fred's Final Fling]]'' (1980), ''[[The Flintstones: Wind-Up Wilma|Wind-Up Wilma]]'' (1981) and ''[[The Flintstones: Jogging Fever|Jogging Fever]]'' (1981).\n\n==The Flintstone Comedy Show==\nThe Frankenstones starred in their own eponymous segment on Saturday mornings as part of ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]'' which premiered on November 22, 1980. This third and final version of the Frankenstone family more closely resembled the version previously seen in ''The New Fred and Barney Show'' than the Frankenstones that just moved in next door in the prime-time specials. This version of the family consisted of:\n\n* '''Frank Frankenstone''' (voiced by [[Charles Nelson Reilly]])\n* '''Hidea Frankenstone''', his wife and previously their daughter's name in the prime-time specials (voiced by [[Ruta Lee]])\n* '''Atrocia Frankenstone''', their kooky daughter who is now the youngest child (voiced by [[Zelda Rubinstein]])\n* '''Freaky Frankenstone''', their son who is now a teenager (voiced by [[Paul Reubens]])\n\nThe Frankenstones have a pet monster named '''Rockjaw''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) who devoured anything in his path.

A broadband burst pulse of clicking sounds is emitted in a focused beam in front of the dolphin. When the clicking sounds hit an object in the water, like a fish or rock, they bounce off and come back to the dolphin as echoes. Echolocation tells the dolphins the shape, size, speed, distance, and location of the object.<ref name=\"auto\"/> To hear the returning echo, they have two small ear openings behind the eyes, but most sound waves are transmitted to the inner ear through the lower jaw. As the object of interest is approached, the echo becomes booming, and the dolphins adjust by decreasing the intensity of the emitted sounds. (This contrasts with [[bat]]s and sonar, which reduce the sensitivity of the sound receptor.) The interclick interval also decreases as the animal nears the target. Evidently, the dolphin waits for each click's echo before clicking again. Echolocation details, such as signal strength, spectral qualities, and discrimination, are well understood by researchers.<ref name=\"Au\">\n{{cite book| last=Au| first=Whitlow| year=1993| title=The Sonar of Dolphins| location=New York| publisher=Springer-Verlag| isbn=978-3-540-97835-0}}</ref> Bottlenose dolphins are also able to extract shape information, suggesting they are able to form an \"echoic image\" or sound picture of their targets.<ref name=\"Pack 1995\">\n{{cite journal |vauthors=Pack AA, Herman LM |title=Sensory integration in the bottlenosed dolphin: immediate recognition of complex shapes across the senses of echolocation and vision |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=98 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=722\u201333 |year=1995|pmid=7642811 |doi=10.1121/1.413566|bibcode = 1995ASAJ...98..722P }}</ref>\n\nDolphins have sharp eyesight.

Self-decoration by wearing grass appears to be an attention-getting device rather than purely play and varies from a single blade to large clusters of grass. John's Pass dolphins self-decorate with grass primarily when they form new social groups or engage in procreative activities.

The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive.

Driving behavior, speed, engine type and separation distance all affect dolphin safety.\n\nHowever, dolphins in these areas can also coexist with humans. For example, in the town of [[Laguna, Brazil|Laguna]] in south Brazil, a pod of bottlenose dolphins resides in the estuary, and some of its members cooperate with humans.  These cooperating dolphins are individually recognized by the local fishermen, who name them.  The fishermen typically stand up to their knees in the shallow waters or sit in canoes, waiting for the dolphins. Now and then, one or more dolphins appear, driving the fish towards the line of fishermen.  One dolphin then displays a unique body movement outside the water, which serves as a signal to the fishermen to cast their nets (the entire sequence is shown here,<ref name=\":0\" /> and a detailed description of the signal's characteristics is available here<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUZhmJ0JSQ|title=Cooperative Dolphins of Laguna: Data on Nature of Signal (video and detailed description)|last=Dr. Moti Nissani|date=2008|website=|access-date=}}</ref>).  In this unique form of cooperation, the dolphins gain because the fish are disoriented and because the fish cannot escape to shallow water where the larger dolphins cannot swim. Likewise, studies show that fishermen casting their nets following the unique signal catch more fish than when fishing alone, without the help of the dolphins.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sim\u00f5es-Lopes|first=Paulo C.|date=1998|title=Dolphin interactions with the mullet artisanal fishing on southern Brazil: a qualitative and quantitative approach|url=|journal=Revista Brasileira de Zoologia|volume=15|pages=709\u2013726|issue=3|doi=10.1590/s0101-81751998000300016|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>  The dolphins were not trained for this behavior; the collaboration began before 1847.

A broadband burst pulse of clicking sounds is emitted in a focused beam in front of the dolphin. When the clicking sounds hit an object in the water, like a fish or rock, they bounce off and come back to the dolphin as echoes. Echolocation tells the dolphins the shape, size, speed, distance, and location of the object.<ref name=\"auto\"/> To hear the returning echo, they have two small ear openings behind the eyes, but most sound waves are transmitted to the inner ear through the lower jaw. As the object of interest is approached, the echo becomes booming, and the dolphins adjust by decreasing the intensity of the emitted sounds. (This contrasts with [[bat]]s and sonar, which reduce the sensitivity of the sound receptor.) The interclick interval also decreases as the animal nears the target. Evidently, the dolphin waits for each click's echo before clicking again. Echolocation details, such as signal strength, spectral qualities, and discrimination, are well understood by researchers.<ref name=\"Au\">\n{{cite book| last=Au| first=Whitlow| year=1993| title=The Sonar of Dolphins| location=New York| publisher=Springer-Verlag| isbn=978-3-540-97835-0}}</ref> Bottlenose dolphins are also able to extract shape information, suggesting they are able to form an \"echoic image\" or sound picture of their targets.<ref name=\"Pack 1995\">\n{{cite journal |vauthors=Pack AA, Herman LM |title=Sensory integration in the bottlenosed dolphin: immediate recognition of complex shapes across the senses of echolocation and vision |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=98 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=722\u201333 |year=1995|pmid=7642811 |doi=10.1121/1.413566|bibcode = 1995ASAJ...98..722P }}</ref>\n\nDolphins have sharp eyesight.

In the 1980s, a female from the local population was kept at a local dolphinarium for three weeks, and the scientist suggests she copied the tail-walking behavior from other dolphins. Two other wild adult female dolphins have now copied it from her.<ref name=\"BBC Adelaide\">{{cite news|last=Black|first=Richard|year=2008|title=Wild dolphins tail-walk on water|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7570097.stm|newspaper=BBC News|accessdate=March 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA study conducted by the [[University of Chicago]] showed that bottlenose dolphins can remember whistles of other dolphins they'd lived with after 20 years of separation.

Self-decoration by wearing grass appears to be an attention-getting device rather than purely play and varies from a single blade to large clusters of grass. John's Pass dolphins self-decorate with grass primarily when they form new social groups or engage in procreative activities. Grass-wearing behavior among these dolphins is a local behavioral tradition that could constitute a cultural difference from other communities.<ref>Weaver, A., & Kuczaj, S. (2016).

The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|isbn=978-0-8050-1950-6\n|author1=Connor Richard C. \n|author2=Peterson, Dawn M.\n|year=1994\n|title=The Lives of Whales and Dolphins\n|publisher=Henry Holt and Company\n|location=New York.\n|url=https://archive.org/details/livesofwhalesd00conn\n}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[breeding season]], males compete for access to females.

Driving behavior, speed, engine type and separation distance all affect dolphin safety.\n\nHowever, dolphins in these areas can also coexist with humans. For example, in the town of [[Laguna, Brazil|Laguna]] in south Brazil, a pod of bottlenose dolphins resides in the estuary, and some of its members cooperate with humans.  These cooperating dolphins are individually recognized by the local fishermen, who name them.  The fishermen typically stand up to their knees in the shallow waters or sit in canoes, waiting for the dolphins. Now and then, one or more dolphins appear, driving the fish towards the line of fishermen.  One dolphin then displays a unique body movement outside the water, which serves as a signal to the fishermen to cast their nets (the entire sequence is shown here,<ref name=\":0\" /> and a detailed description of the signal's characteristics is available here<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUZhmJ0JSQ|title=Cooperative Dolphins of Laguna: Data on Nature of Signal (video and detailed description)|last=Dr. Moti Nissani|date=2008|website=|access-date=}}</ref>).  In this unique form of cooperation, the dolphins gain because the fish are disoriented and because the fish cannot escape to shallow water where the larger dolphins cannot swim. Likewise, studies show that fishermen casting their nets following the unique signal catch more fish than when fishing alone, without the help of the dolphins.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sim\u00f5es-Lopes|first=Paulo C.|date=1998|title=Dolphin interactions with the mullet artisanal fishing on southern Brazil: a qualitative and quantitative approach|url=|journal=Revista Brasileira de Zoologia|volume=15|pages=709\u2013726|issue=3|doi=10.1590/s0101-81751998000300016|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>  The dolphins were not trained for this behavior; the collaboration began before 1847.

He was also a matrilineal great-grandson of the second caliph, [[Umar|Umar ibn Al-Khattab]]. \n\nSurrounded with great scholars, he is credited with having ordered the first official collection of [[Hadith]]s and encouraged education to everyone.\nHe also sent out emissaries to [[China]] and [[Tibet]], inviting their rulers to accept [[Islam]]. At the same time, he remained tolerant with the his non-Muslim citizens. According to Nazeer Ahmed, it was during the time of Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz that the Islamic faith took roots and was accepted by huge segments of the population of [[Persia]] and [[Egypt]].\n \nMilitarily, Umar is deemed a pacifist, since he ordered the withdrawal of the [[Muslim army]] in places such as [[Constantinople]] and [[Central Asia]] despite being a good military leader. Under his rule, the [[Islamic Spain]] conquered good amount of territories from the Christian Kingdoms.\n\n==Early life==\nUmar was likely born in [[Medina]] around 680.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=267}}{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} His father, [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan]], belonged to the wealthy [[Umayyad dynasty|Umayyad]] clan resident in the city, while his mother, Umm Asim Layla bint Asim, was a granddaughter of Caliph [[Umar|Umar ibn al-Khattab]] ({{reign|634|644}}).{{sfn|Cobb|2000|pp=821\u2013822}} His descent from Caliph Umar would later be much emphasized by Umar II and the traditional Muslim sources to differentiate him from the other [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] rulers.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=267}} At the time of his birth, another branch of the Umayyads, the Sufyanids, ruled the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Caliphate]] from [[Damascus]]. When Caliph [[Yazid I]] and his son and successor, [[Mu'awiya II]], died in quick succession in 683 and 684, respectively, Umayyad authority collapsed across the Caliphate and the Umayyads of the [[Hejaz]], including Medina, were expelled by supporters of the rival caliph, the [[Mecca]]-based [[Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr]]. The Umayyad exiles took refuge in Syria, where the dynasty was supported by powerful Arab tribes such as the [[Banu Kalb]]. Umar's grandfather, [[Marwan I]], was ultimately recognized by these tribes as caliph and, with their support, reasserted Umayyad rule in Syria.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=90\u201391}} \n\nIn 685, Marwan ousted Ibn al-Zubayr's governor from [[Egypt]] and appointed Umar's father to the province.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=92\u201393}} Umar spent part of his childhood in Egypt, particularly in [[Helwan|Hulwan]], which had become the seat of his father's governorship between 686 and his death in 705.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} He received his education in Medina, however,{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} which was retaken by the Umayyads under Umar's paternal uncle, Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] ({{reign|685|705}}), in 692.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=98}} Having spent much of his youth in Medina, Umar developed ties with the city's pious men and transmitters of the [[hadith]].{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} Following the death of Umar's father, Abd al-Malik recalled Umar to Damascus, where he married off his daughter, Fatima, to him.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}}\n\n==Governor of Medina==\nShortly after his accession, Abd al-Malik's son and successor, [[al-Walid I]] ({{reign|705|715}}), appointed Umar governor of Medina.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} According to [[Julius Wellhausen]], al-Walid's intention was to use Umar to reconcile the townspeople of Medina to Umayyad rule and \"{{sic|obliterate}} the evil memory\" of the preceding Umayyad governors, namely [[Hisham ibn Isma'il al-Makhzumi]], whose rule over Medina had been harsh to its inhabitants.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=267}} Umar took up the post in February/March 706 and his jurisdiction later extended to Mecca and [[Ta'if]].{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} \n\nInformation about his governorship is scant, but most traditional accounts note that he was a \"just governor\", according to historian [[Paul Cobb]].{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} He often led the annual [[Hajj]] pilgrimage in Mecca and showed favor toward the Islamic legal scholars of Medina, notably [[Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab]].{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} Umar tolerated many of these scholars' vocal criticism of the Umayyad government's conduct.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=267}} However, other accounts hold that he showed himself to be materialistic during his early career.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} On al-Walid's orders, Umar undertook the reconstruction and expansion of the [[Prophet's Mosque]] in Medina beginning in 707.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} Under Umar's generally lenient rule, the Hejaz became a refuge for Iraqi political and religious exiles fleeing the persecutions of [[al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]], al-Walid's powerful viceroy over the eastern half of the Caliphate.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} According to Cobb, this ultimately served as Umar's \"undoing\" as al-Hajjaj pressured the caliph to dismiss Umar in May/June 712.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}}\n\n==Courtier of al-Walid and Sulayman==\nDespite his dismissal, Umar remained in al-Walid's favor, being the brother of the caliph's first wife, Umm al-Banin bint Abd al-Aziz.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=268}} He remained in al-Walid's court in Damascus until the caliph's death in 715,{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} and according to the 9th-century historian [[al-Ya'qubi]], he performed the funeral prayers for al-Walid.{{sfn|Biesterfeldt|G\u00fcnther|2018|p=1001}} The latter's brother and successor, [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik|Sulayman]] ({{reign|715|717}}), held Umar in high regard.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=268}} Alongside [[Raja ibn Haywah|Raja ibn Haywa al-Kindi]], an influential religious figure in the Umayyads' court, Umar served as a principal adviser of Sulayman.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} He accompanied the latter when he led the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in 716 and on his return to [[Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} Likewise, he was at the caliph's side at the Muslims' marshaling camp at [[Dabiq, Syria|Dabiq]] in northern Syria, where Sulayman directed the massive war effort to conquer the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] capital of [[Constantinople]] in 717.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}}\n\n==Caliphate==\n===Accession===\nAccording to the traditional Muslim sources, when Sulayman was on his deathbed in Dabiq, he was persuaded by Raja to designate Umar as his successor.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=106}}{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=72}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=265}} Sulayman's son Ayyub had been his initial nominee, but predeceased him,{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=264}} while his other sons were either too young or away fighting on the Byzantine front.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=72}} The nomination of Umar voided the wishes of Abd al-Malik, who sought to restrict the office to his direct descendants.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} The elevation of Umar, a member of a cadet branch of the dynasty, in preference to the numerous princes descended from Abd al-Malik surprised these princes.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=265}} According to Wellhausen, \"nobody dreamed of this, himself [Umar] least of all\".{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=265}} Raja managed the affair, calling the Umayyad princes present at Dabiq into its mosque and demanding that they recognize Sulayman's will, which Raja had kept secret.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=265}} Only after the Umayyads accepted did Raja reveal that Umar was the caliph's nominee.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=265}} [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] voiced his opposition, but relented after being threatened with the use of force.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=265}} Potential intra-dynastic conflict was averted with the designation of a son of Abd al-Malik, [[Yazid II]], as Umar's successor.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=72}} \n\nAccording to historian Reinhard Eisener, Raja's role in the affair was likely \"exaggerated\"; \"more reasonable\" was that Umar's succession was the result of \"traditional patterns, like seniority and well-founded claims\" stemming from Caliph Marwan I's original designation of Umar's father, Abd al-Aziz, as Abd al-Malik's successor,{{sfn|Eisener|1997|p=822}} which had not materialized due to Abd al-Aziz predeceasing Abd al-Malik.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=59}} Umar acceded without significant opposition on 22 September 717.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}}\n\n===Role in provincial administrations===\nShortly after his accession, Umar overhauled the administrations of the provinces.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} He split up the vast governorship established over Iraq and the eastern Caliphate during the reign of Abd al-Malik and his viceroy [[al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=106}} Sulayman's appointee to this super-province, [[Yazid ibn al-Muhallab]], was dismissed and imprisoned by Umar for failing to forward the spoils from his earlier conquest of [[Tabaristan]] along the southern [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] coast to the caliphal treasury.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=106}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=269}} In place of Ibn al-Muhallab, he assigned Abd al-Hamid ibn Abd al-Rahman ibn Zayd ibn al-Khattab, a member of Caliph Umar I's family, to [[Kufa]], [[Adi ibn Artah al-Fazari]] to [[Basra]], [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah|al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] to [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]] and [[Amr ibn Muslim al-Bahili]], a brother of the accomplished general [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]], to [[Sindh]].{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=269}} To the [[Upper Mesopotamia|Jazira]] (Upper Mesopotamia), he appointed [[Umar ibn Hubayra al-Fazari]], while [[al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani]] was appointed to [[al-Andalus]] (Iberian Peninsula) and [[Ismail ibn Abd Allah ibn Abi al-Muhajir|Isma'il ibn Abd Allah]] to [[Ifriqiya]].{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=269}} \n\nThough many of the appointees in the eastern provinces were pupils of al-Hajjaj or affiliated with the [[Qays]] faction, Umar chose them based on their reliability and integrity, rather than opposition to Sulayman's government.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=269}} His choice of governors for al-Andalus and Ifriqiya stemmed from his perceptions of their neutrality amid the [[Qays\u2013Yaman rivalry|tribal factionalism of the Qays and Yaman]] and justice toward the oppressed.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=269\u2013270}} According to Kennedy, Umar seemingly assigned competent men that he could control, indicating his intention \"to keep a close eye on provincial administration\".{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=106}} Wellhausen notes that the caliph did not leave the governors to their own devices in return for their forwarding of the provincial revenues; rather, he actively oversaw his governors' administrations and his main interest was \"not so much the increase of power as the establishment of right\".{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=270}}\n\n===Military efforts===\n[[File:47-cropped-manasses-chronicle.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Medieval miniature showing cavalry sallying from a city and routing an enemy army|The [[Second Arab Siege of Constantinople]], as depicted in the 14th-century [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] translation of the ''[[Constantine Manasses|Manasses Chronicle]]''.]]\n\nUmar is often deemed a pacifist by the sources, though Cobb attributes the caliph's war-weariness to concerns over the diminishing funds of the Caliphate's treasury.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} Wellhausen asserts that Umar was \"disinclined to wars of conquest, well-knowing that they were waged, not for God, but for the sake of spoil\".{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=268}} Indeed, shortly after his accession in late 717, he ordered the withdrawal of the Muslim army led by his cousin [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik]] from their abortive siege against Constantinople to the region of [[Malatya]], closer to the Syrian frontier.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} Despite the withdrawal, Umar kept up the annual summer raids against the Byzantine frontier,{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} out of the obligation to ''[[jihad]]''.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=268}} Umar remained in northern Syria, often residing at his estate in [[Khanasir|Khunasira]], where he built a fortified headquarters.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}}{{sfn|Powers|1989|p=75, note 263}} \n\nAt some point in 717, he dispatched a force under Ibn Hatim ibn al-Nu'man al-Bahili to [[Adharbayjan]] to disperse a group of Turks who had launched damaging raids against the province.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} In 718, he successively deployed Iraqi and Syrian troops to suppress the [[Khawarij|Kharijite]] rebellion of [[Shawdhab al-Yashkuri]] in Iraq, though some sources say the revolt was settled diplomatically.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} Along the Caliphate's northeastern frontiers, in [[Transoxiana]], Islam had already been established in a number of cities, precluding Umar's withdrawal of Arab troops from there.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=268\u2013269}} However, he prevented further eastward expansion.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=269}} During his reign, Muslim forces based in al-Andalus conquered and fortified the Mediterranean coastal city of [[Narbonne]] in modern-day

himself with great scholars like Muhammad ibn Ka'b and Maymun ibn Mihran. He offered stipends to teachers and encouraged education. Through his personal example, he inculcated piety, steadfastness, business ethics and moral rectitude in the general population. His reforms included strict abolition of drinking, forbidding public nudity, elimination of mixed bathrooms for men and women and fair dispensation of Zakat. He undertook extensive public works in [[Persia]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[North Africa]], including the construction of canals, roads, rest houses for travellers and medical dispensaries.<ref name=\"historyofislam.com\">{{cite web|url=http://historyofislam.com/contents/the-age-of-faith/omar-bin-abdul-aziz/|title=Omar bin Abdul Aziz|date=11 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nHe continued the welfare programs of the last few Umayyad caliphs, expanding them and including special programs for orphans and the destitute. He would also abolish the [[jizya]] tax for converts to Islam, who were former dhimmis, who used to be taxed even after they had converted under other Umayyad rulers.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n\nUmar II is credited with having ordered the first official collection of [[hadith]] (sayings and actions attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad), fearing that some of it might be lost. [[Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad ibn Hazm]] and [[Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri]] are among those who compiled hadiths at Umar II's behest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://people.uncw.edu/bergh/par246/L21RHadithCriticism.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311144448/http://people.uncw.edu/bergh/par246/L21RHadithCriticism.htm |archivedate=2007-03-11 }}</ref>\n\nHe made other reforms:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turntoislam.com/forum/showthread.php?t=13713|title=The Great Khalifah Umar ibn Abdul Aziz - TurnToIslam Islamic Forum & Social Network|website=www.turntoislam.com}}</ref>\n* State officials were excluded from entering into any business.\n* Unpaid labour was made illegal.\n* Pasture lands and game reserves, which were reserved for the family of the dignitaries, were evenly distributed among the poor for the purpose of cultivation.\n* He urged all of the officials to listen the complaints of the people; he would also announce at any public occasion that, if anyone witnessed a public official mistreating others, he should report him to the leader and would be given a reward ranging from 100 to 300 dirhams.\n\n====Taxation====\nUnder previous Umayyad rulers, Arab Muslims had certain financial privileges over non-Arab Muslims. Non-Arab converts to Islam were still expected to pay the [[jizya]] (poll tax) that they paid before becoming Muslims. Umar put into practice a new system that exempted all Muslims, regardless of their heritage, from the jizya tax. He also added some safeguards to the system to make sure that mass conversion to Islam would not cause the collapse of the finances of the Umayyad government.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=77}} Under the new tax policy, converted ''[[mawali]]'' (non-Arab Muslim converts) would not pay the jizya (or any other ''[[dhimmi]]'' tax), but upon conversion, their land would become the property of their villages and would thus remain liable to the full rate of the ''[[kharaj]]'' (land tax). This compensated for the loss of income due to the diminished jizya tax base.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|page=107}}\nHe issued an edict on taxation stating: \n<blockquote>Whosoever accepts Islam, whether Christian, Jew or Zoroastrian, of those now subject to taxes and who joins himself to the body of the Muslims in their abode, forsaking the abode in which he was before, he shall have the same rights and duties as they have, and they are obliged to associate with him and to treat him as one of themselves.{{sfn|Gibb|1955|p=3}}</blockquote>\n\n===Efforts in inviting people to Islam (Dawah)===\nFollowing the example of the Prophet, Umar sent out emissaries to China and Tibet, inviting their rulers to accept Islam. According to Nazeer Ahmed, it was during the time of Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz that Islam took roots and was accepted by a large segment of the population of Persia and Egypt. When the officials complained that because of conversions, the jizya revenues of the state had experienced a steep decline, Umar wrote back saying that he had accepted the Caliphate to invite people to Islam and not to become a tax collector. The infusion of non-Arabs in large number into the fold of Islam shifted the center of gravity of the empire from Medina and Damascus to Persia and Egypt.<ref name=\"historyofislam.com\"/>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nHis reforms in favor of the people greatly angered the nobility of the Umayyads, and they would eventually bribe a servant into poisoning his food. Umar learned of this on his death bed and pardoned the culprit, collecting the punitive payments he was entitled to under Islamic law but depositing them in the public treasury.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} On his way back from Damascus to [[Aleppo]] or possibly to his Khunasira estate, Umar fell ill.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=822}} He died between 5 February and 10 February 720,{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=822}} at the age of 37,{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=311}} in the village of [[Church of Saint Simeon Stylites|Dayr Sim'an]] (the Monastery of [[Simeon Stylites|Simeon]]) near [[Ma'arrat al-Nu'man]].{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=822}} Umar had purchased a plot there with his own funds and was buried in the village, where the ruins of his tomb, built at an unknown date, are still visible.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=822}} He was succeeded by Yazid II.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=107}}\n\nThe unanimous view in the Muslim traditional sources is that Umar was pious and ruled like a true Muslim in singular opposition to the other Umayyad caliphs, who were generally considered \"godless usurpers, tyrants and playboys\".{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=106}} The tradition recognized Umar as an authentic caliph, while the other Umayyads were viewed as kings.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=77}} In the view of Hawting, this is partly based on the historical facts and Umar's character and actions, but \"it is also clear that much of the traditional writing about him should be regarded as pious and moralistic story-telling in keeping with the needs and outlook of tradition\".{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=72}} As a result of this and his short term in office, it is difficult to assess the achievements of his caliphate and his motives.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=77}} Indeed, Kennedy calls Umar \"the most puzzling character among the Marwanid rulers\".{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=106}} According to Hawting, Wellhausen's work marked a transition in western studies of Umar from the early tendency to view this caliph as \"an impractical idealist\" to the more modern view of him as \"a pious individual who attempted to solve the problems of his day in a way which would reconcile the needs of his dynasty and state with the demands of Islam\".{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=77}}\n\n==Views==\n{{PresentScholar|Shah Waliullah Dehlawi|18th}}, stated:<ref>[[Izalat al-Khafa]] p. 77 part 7</ref>\n\n{{cquote|A [[Mujaddid|Mujadid]] appears at the end of every century: The Mujadid of the 1st century was [[Imam#Sunni \"Imams\"|Imam of Ahlul Sunnah]], [[Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]].

Umar made various significant contributions and reforms to the society, and he has been described as \"the most pious and devout\" of the [[Umayyad dynasty|Umayyad rulers]] and was often called the first [[Mujaddid]] and the fifth righteous Caliph of Islam.<ref name=RGHIGP2015:199>[[#RGHIGP2015|Hoyland, ''In God's Path'', 2015]]: p.199</ref>\n\nHe was also a cousin of the former caliph, being the son of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]]'s younger brother, [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan|Abd al-Aziz]]. He was also a matrilineal great-grandson of the second caliph, [[Umar|Umar ibn Al-Khattab]]. \n\nSurrounded with great scholars, he is credited with having ordered the first official collection of [[Hadith]]s and encouraged education to everyone.\nHe also sent out emissaries to [[China]] and [[Tibet]], inviting their rulers to accept [[Islam]]. At the same time, he remained tolerant with the his non-Muslim citizens. According to Nazeer Ahmed, it was during the time of Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz that the Islamic faith took roots and was accepted by huge segments of the population of [[Persia]] and [[Egypt]].\n \nMilitarily, Umar is deemed a pacifist, since he ordered the withdrawal of the [[Muslim army]] in places such as [[Constantinople]] and [[Central Asia]] despite being a good military leader. Under his rule, the [[Islamic Spain]] conquered good amount of territories from the Christian Kingdoms.\n\n==Early life==\nUmar was likely born in [[Medina]] around 680.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=267}}{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} His father, [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan]], belonged to the wealthy [[Umayyad dynasty|Umayyad]] clan resident in the city, while his mother, Umm Asim Layla bint Asim, was a granddaughter of Caliph [[Umar|Umar ibn al-Khattab]] ({{reign|634|644}}).{{sfn|Cobb|2000|pp=821\u2013822}} His descent from Caliph Umar would later be much emphasized by Umar II and the traditional Muslim sources to differentiate him from the other [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] rulers.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=267}} At the time of his birth, another branch of the Umayyads, the Sufyanids, ruled the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Caliphate]] from [[Damascus]]. When Caliph [[Yazid I]] and his son and successor, [[Mu'awiya II]], died in quick succession in 683 and 684, respectively, Umayyad authority collapsed across the Caliphate and the Umayyads of the [[Hejaz]], including Medina, were expelled by supporters of the rival caliph, the [[Mecca]]-based [[Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr]]. The Umayyad exiles took refuge in Syria, where the dynasty was supported by powerful Arab tribes such as the [[Banu Kalb]]. Umar's grandfather, [[Marwan I]], was ultimately recognized by these tribes as caliph and, with their support, reasserted Umayyad rule in Syria.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=90\u201391}} \n\nIn 685, Marwan ousted Ibn al-Zubayr's governor from [[Egypt]] and appointed Umar's father to the province.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=92\u201393}} Umar spent part of his childhood in Egypt, particularly in [[Helwan|Hulwan]], which had become the seat of his father's governorship between 686 and his death in 705.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} He received his education in Medina, however,{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} which was retaken by the Umayyads under Umar's paternal uncle, Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] ({{reign|685|705}}), in 692.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=98}} Having spent much of his youth in Medina, Umar developed ties with the city's pious men and transmitters of the [[hadith]].{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} Following the death of Umar's father, Abd al-Malik recalled Umar to Damascus, where he married off his daughter, Fatima, to him.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}}\n\n==Governor of Medina==\nShortly after his accession, Abd al-Malik's son and successor, [[al-Walid I]] ({{reign|705|715}}), appointed Umar governor of Medina.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} According to [[Julius Wellhausen]], al-Walid's intention was to use Umar to reconcile the townspeople of Medina to Umayyad rule and \"{{sic|obliterate}} the evil memory\" of the preceding Umayyad governors, namely [[Hisham ibn Isma'il al-Makhzumi]], whose rule over Medina had been harsh to its inhabitants.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=267}} Umar took up the post in February/March 706 and his jurisdiction later extended to Mecca and [[Ta'if]].{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} \n\nInformation about his governorship is scant, but most traditional accounts note that he was a \"just governor\", according to historian [[Paul Cobb]].{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} He often led the annual [[Hajj]] pilgrimage in Mecca and showed favor toward the Islamic legal scholars of Medina, notably [[Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab]].{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} Umar tolerated many of these scholars' vocal criticism of the Umayyad government's conduct.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=267}} However, other accounts hold that he showed himself to be materialistic during his early career.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} On al-Walid's orders, Umar undertook the reconstruction and expansion of the [[Prophet's Mosque]] in Medina beginning in 707.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} Under Umar's generally lenient rule, the Hejaz became a refuge for Iraqi political and religious exiles fleeing the persecutions of [[al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]], al-Walid's powerful viceroy over the eastern half of the Caliphate.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} According to Cobb, this ultimately served as Umar's \"undoing\" as al-Hajjaj pressured the caliph to dismiss Umar in May/June 712.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}}\n\n==Courtier of al-Walid and Sulayman==\nDespite his dismissal, Umar remained in al-Walid's favor, being the brother of the caliph's first wife, Umm al-Banin bint Abd al-Aziz.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=268}} He remained in al-Walid's court in Damascus until the caliph's death in 715,{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} and according to the 9th-century historian [[al-Ya'qubi]], he performed the funeral prayers for al-Walid.{{sfn|Biesterfeldt|G\u00fcnther|2018|p=1001}} The latter's brother and successor, [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik|Sulayman]] ({{reign|715|717}}), held Umar in high regard.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=268}} Alongside [[Raja ibn Haywah|Raja ibn Haywa al-Kindi]], an influential religious figure in the Umayyads' court, Umar served as a principal adviser of Sulayman.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} He accompanied the latter when he led the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in 716 and on his return to [[Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} Likewise, he was at the caliph's side at the Muslims' marshaling camp at [[Dabiq, Syria|Dabiq]] in northern Syria, where Sulayman directed the massive war effort to conquer the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] capital of [[Constantinople]] in 717.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}}\n\n==Caliphate==\n===Accession===\nAccording to the traditional Muslim sources, when Sulayman was on his deathbed in Dabiq, he was persuaded by Raja to designate Umar as his successor.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=106}}{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=72}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=265}} Sulayman's son Ayyub had been his initial nominee, but predeceased him,{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=264}} while his other sons were either too young or away fighting on the Byzantine front.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=72}} The nomination of Umar voided the wishes of Abd al-Malik, who sought to restrict the office to his direct descendants.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} The elevation of Umar, a member of a cadet branch of the dynasty, in preference to the numerous princes descended from Abd al-Malik surprised these princes.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=265}} According to Wellhausen, \"nobody dreamed of this, himself [Umar] least of all\".{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=265}} Raja managed the affair, calling the Umayyad princes present at Dabiq into its mosque and demanding that they recognize Sulayman's will, which Raja had kept secret.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=265}} Only after the Umayyads accepted did Raja reveal that Umar was the caliph's nominee.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=265}} [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] voiced his opposition, but relented after being threatened with the use of force.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=265}} Potential intra-dynastic conflict was averted with the designation of a son of Abd al-Malik, [[Yazid II]], as Umar's successor.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=72}} \n\nAccording to historian Reinhard Eisener, Raja's role in the affair was likely \"exaggerated\"; \"more reasonable\" was that Umar's succession was the result of \"traditional patterns, like seniority and well-founded claims\" stemming from Caliph Marwan I's original designation of Umar's father, Abd al-Aziz, as Abd al-Malik's successor,{{sfn|Eisener|1997|p=822}} which had not materialized due to Abd al-Aziz predeceasing Abd al-Malik.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=59}} Umar acceded without significant opposition on 22 September 717.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}}\n\n===Role in provincial administrations===\nShortly after his accession, Umar overhauled the administrations of the provinces.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} He split up the vast governorship established over Iraq and the eastern Caliphate during the reign of Abd al-Malik and his viceroy [[al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=106}} Sulayman's appointee to this super-province, [[Yazid ibn al-Muhallab]], was dismissed and imprisoned by Umar for failing to forward the spoils from his earlier conquest of [[Tabaristan]] along the southern [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] coast to the caliphal treasury.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=106}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=269}} In place of Ibn al-Muhallab, he assigned Abd al-Hamid ibn Abd al-Rahman ibn Zayd ibn al-Khattab, a member of Caliph Umar I's family, to [[Kufa]], [[Adi ibn Artah al-Fazari]] to [[Basra]], [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah|al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] to [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]] and [[Amr ibn Muslim al-Bahili]], a brother of the accomplished general [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]], to [[Sindh]].{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=269}} To the [[Upper Mesopotamia|Jazira]] (Upper Mesopotamia), he appointed [[Umar ibn Hubayra al-Fazari]], while [[al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani]] was appointed to [[al-Andalus]] (Iberian Peninsula) and [[Ismail ibn Abd Allah ibn Abi al-Muhajir|Isma'il ibn Abd Allah]] to [[Ifriqiya]].{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=269}} \n\nThough many of the appointees in the eastern provinces were pupils of al-Hajjaj or affiliated with the [[Qays]] faction, Umar chose them based on their reliability and integrity, rather than opposition to Sulayman's government.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=269}} His choice of governors for al-Andalus and Ifriqiya stemmed from his perceptions of their neutrality amid the [[Qays\u2013Yaman rivalry|tribal factionalism of the Qays and Yaman]] and justice toward the oppressed.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=269\u2013270}} According to Kennedy, Umar seemingly assigned competent men that he could control, indicating his intention \"to keep a close eye on provincial administration\".{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=106}} Wellhausen notes that the caliph did not leave the governors to their own devices in return for their forwarding of the provincial revenues; rather, he actively oversaw his governors' administrations and his main interest was \"not so much the increase of power as the establishment of right\".{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=270}}\n\n===Military efforts===\n[[File:47-cropped-manasses-chronicle.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Medieval miniature showing cavalry sallying from a city and routing an enemy army|The [[Second Arab Siege of Constantinople]], as depicted in the 14th-century [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] translation of the ''[[Constantine Manasses|Manasses Chronicle]]''.]]\n\nUmar is often deemed a pacifist by the sources, though Cobb attributes the caliph's war-weariness to concerns over the diminishing funds of the Caliphate's treasury.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} Wellhausen asserts that Umar was \"disinclined to wars of conquest, well-knowing that they were waged, not for God, but for the sake of spoil\".{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=268}} Indeed, shortly after his accession in late 717, he ordered the withdrawal of the Muslim army led by his cousin [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik]] from their abortive siege against Constantinople to the region of [[Malatya]], closer to the Syrian frontier.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} Despite the withdrawal, Umar kept up the annual summer raids against the Byzantine frontier,{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} out of the obligation to ''[[jihad]]''.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=268}} Umar remained in northern Syria, often residing at his estate in [[Khanasir|Khunasira]], where he built a fortified headquarters.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}}{{sfn|Powers|1989|p=75, note 263}} \n\nAt some point in 717, he dispatched a force under Ibn Hatim ibn al-Nu'man al-Bahili to [[Adharbayjan]] to disperse a group of Turks who had launched damaging raids against the province.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} In 718, he successively deployed Iraqi and Syrian troops to suppress the [[Khawarij|Kharijite]] rebellion of [[Shawdhab al-Yashkuri]] in Iraq, though some sources say the revolt was settled diplomatically.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=821}} Along the Caliphate's northeastern frontiers, in [[Transoxiana]], Islam had already been established in a number of cities, precluding Umar's withdrawal of Arab troops from there.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=268\u2013269}} However, he prevented further eastward expansion.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=269}} During his reign, Muslim forces based in al-Andalus conquered and fortified the Mediterranean coastal city of [[Narbonne]] in modern-day France.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=269, note 1}}\n\n===Reforms===\n[[File:Dirham of Umar II, 718-719.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Silver [[dirham]] of Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]]\n\nUmar was a scholar and surrounded himself with great scholars like Muhammad ibn Ka'b and Maymun ibn Mihran. He offered stipends to teachers and encouraged education. Through his personal example, he inculcated piety, steadfastness, business ethics and moral rectitude in the general population. His reforms included strict abolition of drinking, forbidding public nudity, elimination of mixed bathrooms for men and women and fair dispensation of Zakat. He undertook extensive public works in [[Persia]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[North Africa]], including the construction of canals, roads, rest houses for travellers and medical dispensaries.<ref name=\"historyofislam.com\">{{cite web|url=http://historyofislam.com/contents/the-age-of-faith/omar-bin-abdul-aziz/|title=Omar bin Abdul Aziz|date=11 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nHe continued the welfare programs of the last few Umayyad caliphs, expanding them and including special programs for orphans and the destitute. He would also abolish the [[jizya]] tax for converts to Islam, who were former dhimmis, who used to be taxed even after they had converted under other Umayyad rulers.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n\nUmar II is credited with having ordered the first official collection of [[hadith]] (sayings and actions attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad), fearing that some of it might be lost. [[Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad ibn Hazm]] and [[Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri]] are among those who compiled hadiths at Umar II's behest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://people.uncw.edu/bergh/par246/L21RHadithCriticism.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311144448/http://people.uncw.edu/bergh/par246/L21RHadithCriticism.htm |archivedate=2007-03-11 }}</ref>\n\nHe made other reforms:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turntoislam.com/forum/showthread.php?t=13713|title=The Great Khalifah Umar ibn Abdul Aziz - TurnToIslam Islamic Forum & Social Network|website=www.turntoislam.com}}</ref>\n* State officials were excluded from entering into any business.\n* Unpaid labour was made illegal.\n* Pasture lands and game reserves, which were reserved for the family of the dignitaries, were evenly distributed among the poor for the purpose of cultivation.\n* He urged all of the officials to listen the complaints of the people; he would also announce at any public occasion that, if anyone witnessed a public official mistreating others, he should report him to the leader and would be given a reward ranging from 100 to 300 dirhams.\n\n====Taxation====\nUnder previous Umayyad rulers, Arab Muslims had certain financial privileges over non-Arab Muslims. Non-Arab converts to Islam were still expected to pay the [[jizya]] (poll tax) that they paid before becoming Muslims. Umar put into practice a new system that exempted all Muslims, regardless of their heritage, from the jizya tax. He also added some safeguards to the system to make sure that mass conversion to Islam would not cause the collapse of the finances of the Umayyad government.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=77}} Under the new tax policy, converted ''[[mawali]]'' (non-Arab Muslim converts) would not pay the jizya (or any other ''[[dhimmi]]'' tax), but upon conversion, their land would become the property of their villages and would thus remain liable to the full rate of the ''[[kharaj]]'' (land tax). This compensated for the loss of income due to the diminished jizya tax base.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|page=107}}\nHe issued an edict on taxation stating: \n<blockquote>Whosoever accepts Islam, whether Christian, Jew or Zoroastrian, of those now subject to taxes and who joins himself to the body of the Muslims in their abode, forsaking the abode in which he was before, he shall have the same rights and duties as they have, and they are obliged to associate with him and to treat him as one of themselves.{{sfn|Gibb|1955|p=3}}</blockquote>\n\n===Efforts in inviting people to Islam (Dawah)===\nFollowing the example of the Prophet, Umar sent out emissaries to China and Tibet, inviting their rulers to accept Islam. According to Nazeer Ahmed, it was during the time of Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz that Islam took roots and was accepted by a large segment of the population of Persia and Egypt. When the officials complained that because of conversions, the jizya revenues of the state had experienced a steep decline, Umar wrote back saying that he had accepted the Caliphate to invite people to Islam and not to become a tax collector. The infusion of non-Arabs in large number into the fold of Islam shifted the center of gravity of the empire from Medina and Damascus to Persia and Egypt.<ref name=\"historyofislam.com\"/>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nHis reforms in favor of the people greatly angered the nobility of the Umayyads, and they would eventually bribe a servant into poisoning his food. Umar learned of this on his death bed and pardoned the culprit, collecting the punitive payments he was entitled to under Islamic law but depositing them in the public treasury.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} On his way back from Damascus to [[Aleppo]] or possibly to his Khunasira estate, Umar fell ill.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=822}} He died between 5 February and 10 February 720,{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=822}} at the age of 37,{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=311}} in the village of [[Church of Saint Simeon Stylites|Dayr Sim'an]] (the Monastery of [[Simeon Stylites|Simeon]]) near [[Ma'arrat al-Nu'man]].{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=822}} Umar had purchased a plot there with his own funds and was buried in the village, where the ruins of his tomb, built at an unknown date, are still visible.{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=822}} He was succeeded by Yazid II.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=107}}\n\nThe unanimous view in the Muslim traditional sources is that Umar was pious and ruled like a true Muslim in singular opposition to the other Umayyad caliphs, who were generally considered \"godless usurpers, tyrants and playboys\".{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=106}} The tradition recognized Umar as an authentic caliph, while the other Umayyads were viewed as kings.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=77}} In the view of Hawting, this is partly based on the historical facts and Umar's character and actions, but \"it is also clear that much of the traditional writing about him should be regarded as pious and moralistic story-telling in keeping with the needs and outlook of tradition\".{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=72}} As a result of this and his short term in office, it is difficult to assess the achievements of his caliphate and his motives.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=77}} Indeed, Kennedy calls Umar \"the most puzzling character among the Marwanid rulers\".{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=106}} According to Hawting, Wellhausen's work marked a transition in western studies of Umar from the early tendency to view this caliph as \"an impractical idealist\" to the more modern view of him as \"a pious individual who attempted to solve the problems of his day in a way which would reconcile the needs of his dynasty and state with the demands of Islam\".{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=77}}\n\n==Views==\n{{PresentScholar|Shah Waliullah Dehlawi|18th}}, stated:<ref>[[Izalat al-Khafa]] p. 77 part 7</ref>\n\n{{cquote|A [[Mujaddid|Mujadid]] appears at the end of every century: The Mujadid of the 1st century was [[Imam#Sunni \"Imams\"|Imam of Ahlul Sunnah]], [[Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]].
