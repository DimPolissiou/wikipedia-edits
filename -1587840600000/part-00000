After serving his prison sentence, Obradovi\u0107 returned to the court as a player, and already in his latter days as a player, he began [[basketball coach|coaching]] Partizan Belgrade's youth team. He retired from playing basketball in 1991, and he then immediately signed on as the [[head coach]] of the senior team of the [[Sports club|club]].\n\n==Coaching career==\nObradovi\u0107's greatness as a professional club basketball coach, is fully confirmed by the great collection of titles he has acquired in his twenty-eight-year career as a head coach, including: a record 9 European-wide premiere level [[EuroLeague]] championships (won with five different teams), a record 14 [[EuroLeague Finals]] appearances, a record 18 [[EuroLeague Final Four]] appearances, two European-wide secondary level [[Saporta Cup]] championships, and numerous national domestic league championships and national cups. \n\n===Partizan Belgrade (1991\u20131993)===\nObradovi\u0107's coaching career began quite suddenly in the summer of 1991 while he was still an active thirty-one-year-old [[KK Partizan|Partizan Belgrade]] player getting ready for [[EuroBasket 1991]] with the Yugoslav national team. Selected and coached by [[Du\u0161an Ivkovi\u0107]], the 1991 national squad was to be captained by Obradovi\u0107 \u2014 the oldest player among the assembled group.

He was brought in by Partizan's incoming [[head coach]] at that time [[Zoran Slavni\u0107|Moka Slavni\u0107]], and the club's vice president at the time [[Dragan Ki\u0107anovi\u0107]], both of which were recent retirees from their playing careers, and who had previously starred on the senior [[Yugoslav national basketball team|Yugoslav national team]], throughout the 1970s, as a legendary [[point guard]] and [[shooting guard]] duo.\n\nIn Obradovi\u0107's third season with the team, Partizan won the [[1986\u201387 Yugoslav First Basketball League|1986\u201387]] season title of the [[Yugoslav First Basketball League|Yugoslav League]].

During his time at Partizan, Obradovi\u0107 established himself as one of the best and most reliable point guards in Yugoslavia's top level league.\n\n===National team career===\nObradovi\u0107 was a member of the junior national teams of Yugoslavia. With [[Yugoslavian men's national under-19 basketball team|Yugoslavia's under-19 national team]], he played at the [[1979 FIBA Under-19 World Championship]]. He was also a member of the senior [[Yugoslavia national basketball team|Yugoslavian national team]]. With Yugoslavia's senior national team, he won a [[silver medal]] at the [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1988 Summer Olympics]], and a [[gold medal]] at the [[1990 FIBA World Championship]].\n\n===End of playing career===\nObradovi\u0107's playing career came to a halt, when he was sentenced to two years in [[prison]], due to causing the death of a [[pedestrian]], in a [[car accident]]. After serving his prison sentence, Obradovi\u0107 returned to the court as a player, and already in his latter days as a player, he began [[basketball coach|coaching]] Partizan Belgrade's youth team. He retired from playing basketball in 1991, and he then immediately signed on as the [[head coach]] of the senior team of the [[Sports club|club]].\n\n==Coaching career==\nObradovi\u0107's greatness as a professional club basketball coach, is fully confirmed by the great collection of titles he has acquired in his twenty-eight-year career as a head coach, including: a record 9 European-wide premiere level [[EuroLeague]] championships (won with five different teams), a record 14 [[EuroLeague Finals]] appearances, a record 18 [[EuroLeague Final Four]] appearances, two European-wide secondary level [[Saporta Cup]] championships, and numerous national domestic league championships and national cups. \n\n===Partizan Belgrade (1991\u20131993)===\nObradovi\u0107's coaching career began quite suddenly in the summer of 1991 while he was still an active thirty-one-year-old [[KK Partizan|Partizan Belgrade]] player getting ready for [[EuroBasket 1991]] with the Yugoslav national team. Selected and coached by [[Du\u0161an Ivkovi\u0107]], the 1991 national squad was to be captained by Obradovi\u0107 \u2014 the oldest player among the assembled group. However, after finishing the training camp in [[Pore\u010d]] and coming back to Belgrade to sleep over before leaving in the morning for a preparation friendly tournament in Germany, Obradovi\u0107 got called in for a meeting with the [[KK Partizan|Partizan]] management \u2014 club president Radojica Nik\u010devi\u0107, vice-president [[Dragan Ki\u0107anovi\u0107]], as well as board members \u0110or\u0111e \"Siske\" \u010colovi\u0107, Milorad \"Miketa\" \u0110uri\u0107, and [[Dragan Todori\u0107]] \u2014 who convinced him to take over the Partizan head coaching job, which entailed retiring from playing effective immediately thus giving up a chance to captain the national team at the upcoming EuroBasket.\n\nThe idea was to have Obradovi\u0107, a debutante head coach, work under the guidance of experienced elder statesman of Yugoslav basketball sixty-seven-year-old professor [[Aca Nikoli\u0107]] whose coaching advisory services were soon secured by Ki\u0107anovi\u0107 and the management team. Also joining the club's front office in the technical director capacity was another fresh retiree from playing, thirty-one-year-old [[Milenko Savovi\u0107]], Obradovi\u0107's longtime teammate at Partizan, who had spent the previous 1990\u201391 season playing for [[KK Vojvodina|Vojvodina]].\n\nIn the 1991\u201392 season, Partizan had a 20\u20132 record in the regular season of [[1991\u201392 YUBA League]].

In 1993 Yugoslav Basketball Cup, it lost with 104\u201391 in the final game to [[OKK Beograd]].\n\n===Joventut (1993\u20131994)===\nIn 1993, Obradovi\u0107 signed a contract with the Spanish team [[Club Joventut Badalona|Joventut]], based in Badalona, where Partizan played its international matches in 1991\u201392 season. With Joventut, he won the [[1993\u201394 FIBA European League]]. In [[Liga ACB]], Joventut finished in 3rd place with 24\u201314 record. In [[1994 Copa del Rey de Baloncesto]], Joventut was eliminated in the quarterfinals.\n\n===Real Madrid (1994\u20131997)===\nAfter the end of season, Obradovi\u0107 signed a contract with [[Real Madrid Baloncesto|Real Madrid]]. In his first season with the club, Real Madrid failed to defend the Liga ACB title, finishing in 3rd place with 27\u201319 record. In [[1995 Copa del Rey de Baloncesto]], Real Madrid finished in 4th place.

In 1996\u201397 season, Real Madrid finished as the runner-up in theLiga ACB and was also eliminated in the quarterfinals of the [[1997 Copa del Rey de Baloncesto]]. In European competitions, Real Madrid participated in second-tier [[FIBA Saporta Cup]] and eventually won it with 78\u201364 in the [[1996\u201397 FIBA EuroCup|final game]] over [[Scaligera Basket Verona|Verona]]. At the end of the season, Obradovi\u0107 parted ways with the team.\n\n===Benetton Treviso (1997\u20131999)===\nIn the summer of 1997, Obradovi\u0107 signed a contract with the Italian team [[Pallacanestro Treviso|Benneton Treviso]].

President Truman bought the first CARE package.<ref name=\"McKinsie\" />{{rp|p.1}} CARE guaranteed delivery within four months to anyone in Europe, even if they had left their last known address, and returned a signed delivery receipt to the sender.<ref name=\"Goldberg\" /> Because European [[Mail|postal services]] were unreliable at the time these signed receipts were sometimes the first confirmation that the recipient had survived the war.<ref name=\"Morris\" />\n\nThe first CARE Packages were in fact surplus [[10-in-1 food parcel|\u201cTen-in-One\u201d US army rations packs]] (designed to contain a day's meals for ten people).<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" /> In early 1946 CARE purchased 2.8 million of these warehoused rations packs, originally intended for the [[Operation Downfall|invasion of Japan]], and began advertising in America. On May 11, 1946, six months after the agency's incorporation, the first CARE Packages were delivered in [[Le Havre]], [[France]].<ref name=\"Morris\" /> These packages contained staples such as [[Canning|canned]] meats, [[powdered milk]], [[dried fruit]]s, and [[fat]]s along with a few comfort items such as [[chocolate]], [[coffee]], and [[cigarette]]s. (Several on the CARE [[Board of Directors]] wished to remove the cigarettes, but it was deemed impractical to open and reseal 2.8 million boxes.)<ref name=\"Morris\" /> 1946 also marked CARE's first expansion out of the US with the establishment of an office in [[Canada]].<ref name=\"Henry\" />\n\nBy early 1947 the supply of \"Ten-in-One\" ration packs had been exhausted and CARE began assembling its own packages.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" /> These new packages were designed with the help of a nutritionist. They did not include cigarettes and were tailored somewhat by destination: [[Kosher]] packages were developed, and for example packages for the [[United Kingdom]] included [[tea]] rather than coffee, and packages for [[Italy]] included [[pasta]]. By 1949 CARE offered and shipped more than twelve different packages.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\nAlthough the organization had originally intended to deliver packages only to specified individuals, within a year CARE began delivering packages addressed for example \"to a teacher\" or simply \"to a hungry person in Europe.\"<ref name=\"Morris\" />{{rp|p.18}} These unspecified donations continued and in early 1948 CARE's Board voted narrowly to officially move towards unspecified donations and to expand into more general relief. Some founding member agencies disagreed with this shift, arguing that more general relief would be a duplication of the work of other agencies, but [[Benefactor (law)|donors]] reacted favourably, contributions increased, and this decision would mark the beginning of CARE\u2019s shift towards a broader mandate.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\nBetween the first deliveries of 1946 and the last European deliveries of 1956, millions of CARE Packages were distributed throughout Europe, over 50% of them to [[Germany]] <ref name=\"Henry\" /> including many delivered as part of the [[Berlin airlift]] in response to the [[Berlin Blockade|1948 Soviet blockade of Berlin]].<ref name=\"Morris\" />\n\nThe US [[Agricultural Act of 1949]] made surplus US agricultural products available to be shipped abroad as aid either directly by the [[US government]] or by NGOs including CARE.<ref name=\"Morris\" /> In 1954 [[Public Law 480]], also known as the Food for Peace Act, further expanded the availability of surplus US food as aid.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" /> This act allowed CARE to expand its feeding programs and disaster relief operations considerably, and between 1949 and 2009 CARE used hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of surplus [[commodity|commodities]] in disaster relief and programs such as [[school meal|school lunch]] provision.<ref name=\"Morris\" />\n\n=== 1949\u20131956: Transition out of Europe ===\n\nAlthough the organization's mission had originally been focused on Europe, in July 1948 CARE opened its first non-European mission, in [[Japan]].<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" /> Deliveries to [[China]] and [[Korea]] followed, which CARE described as aid to areas \"implicated by WWII\".<ref name=\"Barnett\" />{{rp|p.119}} In 1949 CARE entered the [[developing world]] for the first time, launching programs in the [[Philippines]]. Projects in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Mexico]] began soon after.<ref name=\"Morris\" /> 1949 also marked CARE's first expansion into non-food aid with the development of \"self-help\" packages containing tools for farming, carpentry, and other trades.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" /> In 1953, because of its expansion to projects outside Europe, CARE changed the meaning of its acronym to \"Cooperative for American Remittances to Everywhere\".<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\nAs Europe recovered economically, CARE faced the need to re-evaluate its mission: in 1955 several Board members argued that with the European recovery CARE's mandate was finished and the organization should dissolve. Other Board members however felt that CARE's mission should continue albeit with a new focus on the developing world.<ref name=\"Barnett\" /> In July 1955 the Board of Directors voted to continue and expand CARE projects outside of Europe. [[Paul Comly French|Paul French]], CARE's executive director at the time, resigned over the debate. New executive director [[Richard W.

In order to reflect these new broader aims, in 1959 CARE changed the meaning of its acronym a second time, becoming the \"Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere\".<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\nReflecting this broadened scope, CARE became involved in 1961 with President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s establishment of the [[Peace Corps]]. CARE was charged with selecting and training the first group of volunteers, who would later be deployed to development projects in [[Colombia]]. The Peace Corps assumed greater control over the training of Peace Corps Volunteers in subsequent missions, but CARE continued to provide country directors to the Peace Corps until CARE-Peace Corps joint projects ended in 1967.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\nIn 1962 CARE merged with and absorbed the medical aid organization MEDICO, which it had been working closely with for several years previously. The merger considerably increased CARE's capacity to deliver health programming including trained medical personnel and medical supplies.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\nDuring this transition the original CARE Package was phased out.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" /> The last food package was delivered in 1967 and the last tools package in 1968.<ref name=\"CARE Package: Then and Now\">{{cite web|title=CARE Package: Then and Now|url=http://www.care.org/care-package-then-now|date=2013-10-31}}</ref> Over 100 million CARE Packages had been delivered worldwide since the first shipment to France.<ref name=\"Rangan\" /> Although 1968 marked the official \"retirement\" of the CARE Package the format would occasionally be used again, for example in CARE's relief to the republics of the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] and to survivors of the [[Bosnian War]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CARE packages prevented starvation in post-war Germany|url=http://www.dw.de/care-packages-prevented-starvation-in-post-war-germany/a-15313828|website=DW|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> The concept was also revived in 2011 as an online campaign encouraging donors to fill a \"virtual CARE Package\" with food aid and services such as education and healthcare.<ref name=Strom />\n\n1967 also marked CARE's first partnership agreement with a government: for the construction of schools in [[Honduras]]. Partnership agreements with governments led programmes to become country-wide rather than targeted only to a few communities. CARE's programmes during this era focused largely on the construction of schools and nutrition centres, and the continued distribution of food. Nutrition centres in particular would become one of CARE's major areas of concentration, linking with school feeding programs and [[Nutrition Education|nutrition education]] aimed at new mothers.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\nIn 1975 CARE implemented a multi-year planning system, again allowing programmes to become both broader and deeper in scope. Projects became increasingly multi-faceted, providing for example not only health education but also access to clean water and an agricultural program to improve nutrition. The multi-year planning system also increased the scope for country-wide projects and partnerships with local governments. A 1977 project for example provided for the construction of over 200 pre-schools and kindergartens throughout [[Chile]] over several years, jointly funded by CARE and the [[Chilean Ministry of Education]].<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\n=== 1975\u20131990: From CARE to CARE International ===\n\nAlthough CARE had opened an office in Canada in 1946, it was not until the mid-1970s that the organization truly started to become an international body.<ref name=\"Henry\" /> [[CARE Canada]] (initially Care of Canada) became an autonomous body in 1973. In 1976 CARE Europe was established in [[Bonn]] following the successful fund-raising campaign \"Dank an CARE\" (Thanks to CARE). In 1981 CARE Germany was created and CARE Europe moved its headquarters to [[Paris]].<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" /> CARE Norway had been created in 1980,<ref name=\"Norway History\" /> and CAREs in Italy and the UK were established. The popularity of CARE offices in Europe was attributed to the fact that many Europeans remembered receiving CARE assistance themselves between 1945 and 1955.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\nIn 1979 planning began for the establishment of an [[umbrella organization]] to coordinate and prevent duplication among the various national CARE organizations. This new body was named CARE International and met for the first time on January 29, 1982, with CARE Canada, CARE Germany, CARE Norway, and CARE USA (formerly simply CARE) in attendance.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\nCARE International would expand significantly during the 1980s, with the addition of CARE France in 1983;<ref name=\"France History\" /> CARE International UK in 1985;<ref name=\"UK History\" /> CARE Austria in 1986;<ref name=\"Austria History\" /> and CARE Australia, CARE Denmark, and CARE Japan in 1987.<ref name=\"CARE Australia History\">{{cite web|title=CARE Australia History|url=https://www.care.org.au/who-we-are/history/|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Denmark History\" /><ref name=\"Japan History\" />\n\n=== 1990\u2013present: Recent history ===\n\nAlong with broader development work CARE's projects in the 1980s and early 1990s focused particularly on [[agroforestry]] initiatives such as [[reforestation]] and [[soil conservation]] in [[eastern Africa]] and [[South America]]. CARE also responded to a number of major emergencies during this period, notably the [[1983\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia]] and the 1991\u20131992 famine in [[Somalia]].<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\nThe 1990s also saw an evolution in CARE's approach to poverty. Originally CARE had viewed poverty primarily as a lack of basic goods and services such as food, clean water, and health care. As CARE's scope expanded both geographically and topically this approach was expanded to include the view that poverty was in many cases caused by [[social exclusion]], marginalization, and [[discrimination]]. In the early 1990s CARE adopted a household [[Sustainable livelihood|livelihood]] security framework which included a multidimensional view of poverty as encompassing not only physical resources but also social position and human capacities. As a result of this, by 2000, CARE had adopted a [[rights-based approach to development]].<ref name=\"Rangan\" />\n\nOne of their buildings was attacked, and people were killed and wounded, during the [[September 2016 Kabul attacks]].\n\n==== Microfinance ====\nIn the early 1990s CARE also developed what would become an important model for cooperative [[microfinance]].\n\nThis model is called the Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs) and it began in 1991 as a pilot project run by CARE's Country Office in [[Niger]].<ref name=\"Hamadziripi\" /> The pilot project was called Mata Masu Dubara (MMD) and CARE Niger developed the VSLA model by adapting the model of [[Rotating Savings and Credit Association|Accumulating Savings and Credit Associations]] (ASCAs). VSLAs involve groups of about 15-30 people who regularly save and borrow using a group fund. Member savings create capital that can be used for short-term loans and capital and interest is shared among the group at the end of a given period (usually about a year), at which point the groups normally re-form to begin a new cycle. Because the bookkeeping required to manage a VSLA is quite simple most groups successfully become independent (needing no outside management help) within a year and enjoy a high rate of long-term group survival.<ref name=\" Anyango\" /> CARE has created over 40,000 VSLAs (over 1 million members total) across Africa, Asia, and Latin America<ref name=\"Hamadziripi\" /> and in 2008 launched Access Africa which aims to extend VSLA training to 39 African countries by 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Micro finance Africa Report|url=http://www.care.org/sites/default/files/documents/MF-2011-Access-Africa-Progress-Report.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe model has also been widely replicated in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] and by other large NGOs including [[Oxfam]], [[Plan International]], and [[Catholic Relief Services]].<ref name=\" Allen\" />\n\nCARE UK later launched [[lendwithcare.org]], which allows members of the public to make [[microloans]], including green loans, to entrepreneurs in Africa and Asia. It avoids many of the criticisms levelled at [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva.org]].\n\n==== Acronym redefinition and 50th anniversary ====\nIn 1993 CARE, to reflect its international organizational structure, changed the meaning of its acronym for a third time, adopting its current name the \"Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere\". CARE also marked its 50th anniversary in 1994.<ref name=\" Rangan\" />\n\nCARE expanded the confederation to twelve members in the early 2000s, with CARE Netherlands (formerly the Disaster Relief Agency) joining in 2001<ref name=\"Netherlands History\" /> and CARE Thailand (called the Raks Thai Foundation) joining in 2003, becoming the first CARE National Member in a developing country.<ref name=\"Thailand History\" />\n\nCARE's well-known \"I am Powerful\" campaign launched in the USA in September 2006 and was intended to bring public attention to the organization's long-standing focus on [[women's empowerment]].<ref name=\"Rangan\" /> CARE states that its programs focus on women and girls both because the world's poor are [[Feminization of poverty|disproportionately female]] and because women's empowerment is thought to be an important driver of development. CARE also emphasizes that it considers working with boys and men an important part of women's empowerment, and that women's empowerment benefits both genders.<ref name=\"Annual Report 2013\" />\n\nIn 2007 CARE announced that by 2009 it would no longer accept certain types of US food aid worth some $45 million a year, arguing that these types of food aid are inefficient and harmful to local markets.<ref name=\"Dugger\" /><ref name=\"Harrell\" /> Specifically, CARE announced that it would forego all [[Monetization of U.S. in-kind food aid|monetized food aid]] (surplus US food shipped to charities in the developing world who then sell the food on the local market to finance development projects)<ref name=\"Harrell\" /> and all food aid intended to establish a commercial advantage for the donor, and would increase its commitment to buying food aid locally.<ref name=\"CARE White Paper\" /> CARE also announced that it would no longer accept [[USDA]] food through [[Food for Peace#Title 1|Title 1]] (concessional sales) or Section 416 (surplus disposal) because these programs are intended mainly to establish a commercial advantage for US agriculture.<ref name=\"CARE White Paper\" />\n\nIn 2011 CARE added its first Affiliate Member, CARE India, and in 2012 the CI board accepted CARE Peru as CARE's second Affiliate Member.<ref name=\"Annual Report 2013\" /> CARE India became a full member in November 2013. The CI board accepted CARE Peru as a full member of the confederation in June 2015.\n\nCARE is currently one of the only major NGOs to make their database of [[project evaluation]]s publicly available, and to regularly conduct a [[meta-analysis]] of evaluation methodologies and overall organizational impact.<ref name=\"Give Well\" /><ref name=\"evaluations library\" />\n\n=== Presidents of CARE ===\n*1945: Clarence Picket (temporary chairman)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The History of CARE: A Personal Account Wallace J.

President Truman bought the first CARE package.<ref name=\"McKinsie\" />{{rp|p.1}} CARE guaranteed delivery within four months to anyone in Europe, even if they had left their last known address, and returned a signed delivery receipt to the sender.<ref name=\"Goldberg\" /> Because European [[Mail|postal services]] were unreliable at the time these signed receipts were sometimes the first confirmation that the recipient had survived the war.<ref name=\"Morris\" />\n\nThe first CARE Packages were in fact surplus [[10-in-1 food parcel|\u201cTen-in-One\u201d US army rations packs]] (designed to contain a day's meals for ten people).<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" /> In early 1946 CARE purchased 2.8 million of these warehoused rations packs, originally intended for the [[Operation Downfall|invasion of Japan]], and began advertising in America. On May 11, 1946, six months after the agency's incorporation, the first CARE Packages were delivered in [[Le Havre]], [[France]].<ref name=\"Morris\" /> These packages contained staples such as [[Canning|canned]] meats, [[powdered milk]], [[dried fruit]]s, and [[fat]]s along with a few comfort items such as [[chocolate]], [[coffee]], and [[cigarette]]s. (Several on the CARE [[Board of Directors]] wished to remove the cigarettes, but it was deemed impractical to open and reseal 2.8 million boxes.)<ref name=\"Morris\" /> 1946 also marked CARE's first expansion out of the US with the establishment of an office in [[Canada]].<ref name=\"Henry\" />\n\nBy early 1947 the supply of \"Ten-in-One\" ration packs had been exhausted and CARE began assembling its own packages.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" /> These new packages were designed with the help of a nutritionist. They did not include cigarettes and were tailored somewhat by destination: [[Kosher]] packages were developed, and for example packages for the [[United Kingdom]] included [[tea]] rather than coffee, and packages for [[Italy]] included [[pasta]]. By 1949 CARE offered and shipped more than twelve different packages.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\nAlthough the organization had originally intended to deliver packages only to specified individuals, within a year CARE began delivering packages addressed for example \"to a teacher\" or simply \"to a hungry person in Europe.\"<ref name=\"Morris\" />{{rp|p.18}} These unspecified donations continued and in early 1948 CARE's Board voted narrowly to officially move towards unspecified donations and to expand into more general relief. Some founding member agencies disagreed with this shift, arguing that more general relief would be a duplication of the work of other agencies, but [[Benefactor (law)|donors]] reacted favourably, contributions increased, and this decision would mark the beginning of CARE\u2019s shift towards a broader mandate.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\nBetween the first deliveries of 1946 and the last European deliveries of 1956, millions of CARE Packages were distributed throughout Europe, over 50% of them to [[Germany]] <ref name=\"Henry\" /> including many delivered as part of the [[Berlin airlift]] in response to the [[Berlin Blockade|1948 Soviet blockade of Berlin]].<ref name=\"Morris\" />\n\nThe US [[Agricultural Act of 1949]] made surplus US agricultural products available to be shipped abroad as aid either directly by the [[US government]] or by NGOs including CARE.<ref name=\"Morris\" /> In 1954 [[Public Law 480]], also known as the Food for Peace Act, further expanded the availability of surplus US food as aid.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" /> This act allowed CARE to expand its feeding programs and disaster relief operations considerably, and between 1949 and 2009 CARE used hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of surplus [[commodity|commodities]] in disaster relief and programs such as [[school meal|school lunch]] provision.<ref name=\"Morris\" />\n\n=== 1949\u20131956: Transition out of Europe ===\n\nAlthough the organization's mission had originally been focused on Europe, in July 1948 CARE opened its first non-European mission, in [[Japan]].<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" /> Deliveries to [[China]] and [[Korea]] followed, which CARE described as aid to areas \"implicated by WWII\".<ref name=\"Barnett\" />{{rp|p.119}} In 1949 CARE entered the [[developing world]] for the first time, launching programs in the [[Philippines]]. Projects in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Mexico]] began soon after.<ref name=\"Morris\" /> 1949 also marked CARE's first expansion into non-food aid with the development of \"self-help\" packages containing tools for farming, carpentry, and other trades.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" /> In 1953, because of its expansion to projects outside Europe, CARE changed the meaning of its acronym to \"Cooperative for American Remittances to Everywhere\".<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\nAs Europe recovered economically, CARE faced the need to re-evaluate its mission: in 1955 several Board members argued that with the European recovery CARE's mandate was finished and the organization should dissolve. Other Board members however felt that CARE's mission should continue albeit with a new focus on the developing world.<ref name=\"Barnett\" /> In July 1955 the Board of Directors voted to continue and expand CARE projects outside of Europe. [[Paul Comly French|Paul French]], CARE's executive director at the time, resigned over the debate. New executive director [[Richard W. Reuter]] took over in 1955 and helped lead the organization in a new direction.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/13/us/richard-w-reuter-executive-at-relief-agencies-dies-at-86.html?_r=1 | title=Richard W.

In order to reflect these new broader aims, in 1959 CARE changed the meaning of its acronym a second time, becoming the \"Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere\".<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\nReflecting this broadened scope, CARE became involved in 1961 with President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s establishment of the [[Peace Corps]]. CARE was charged with selecting and training the first group of volunteers, who would later be deployed to development projects in [[Colombia]]. The Peace Corps assumed greater control over the training of Peace Corps Volunteers in subsequent missions, but CARE continued to provide country directors to the Peace Corps until CARE-Peace Corps joint projects ended in 1967.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\nIn 1962 CARE merged with and absorbed the medical aid organization MEDICO, which it had been working closely with for several years previously. The merger considerably increased CARE's capacity to deliver health programming including trained medical personnel and medical supplies.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\nDuring this transition the original CARE Package was phased out.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" /> The last food package was delivered in 1967 and the last tools package in 1968.<ref name=\"CARE Package: Then and Now\">{{cite web|title=CARE Package: Then and Now|url=http://www.care.org/care-package-then-now|date=2013-10-31}}</ref> Over 100 million CARE Packages had been delivered worldwide since the first shipment to France.<ref name=\"Rangan\" /> Although 1968 marked the official \"retirement\" of the CARE Package the format would occasionally be used again, for example in CARE's relief to the republics of the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] and to survivors of the [[Bosnian War]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CARE packages prevented starvation in post-war Germany|url=http://www.dw.de/care-packages-prevented-starvation-in-post-war-germany/a-15313828|website=DW|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> The concept was also revived in 2011 as an online campaign encouraging donors to fill a \"virtual CARE Package\" with food aid and services such as education and healthcare.<ref name=Strom />\n\n1967 also marked CARE's first partnership agreement with a government: for the construction of schools in [[Honduras]]. Partnership agreements with governments led programmes to become country-wide rather than targeted only to a few communities. CARE's programmes during this era focused largely on the construction of schools and nutrition centres, and the continued distribution of food. Nutrition centres in particular would become one of CARE's major areas of concentration, linking with school feeding programs and [[Nutrition Education|nutrition education]] aimed at new mothers.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\nIn 1975 CARE implemented a multi-year planning system, again allowing programmes to become both broader and deeper in scope. Projects became increasingly multi-faceted, providing for example not only health education but also access to clean water and an agricultural program to improve nutrition. The multi-year planning system also increased the scope for country-wide projects and partnerships with local governments. A 1977 project for example provided for the construction of over 200 pre-schools and kindergartens throughout [[Chile]] over several years, jointly funded by CARE and the [[Chilean Ministry of Education]].<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\n=== 1975\u20131990: From CARE to CARE International ===\n\nAlthough CARE had opened an office in Canada in 1946, it was not until the mid-1970s that the organization truly started to become an international body.<ref name=\"Henry\" /> [[CARE Canada]] (initially Care of Canada) became an autonomous body in 1973. In 1976 CARE Europe was established in [[Bonn]] following the successful fund-raising campaign \"Dank an CARE\" (Thanks to CARE). In 1981 CARE Germany was created and CARE Europe moved its headquarters to [[Paris]].<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" /> CARE Norway had been created in 1980,<ref name=\"Norway History\" /> and CAREs in Italy and the UK were established. The popularity of CARE offices in Europe was attributed to the fact that many Europeans remembered receiving CARE assistance themselves between 1945 and 1955.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\nIn 1979 planning began for the establishment of an [[umbrella organization]] to coordinate and prevent duplication among the various national CARE organizations. This new body was named CARE International and met for the first time on January 29, 1982, with CARE Canada, CARE Germany, CARE Norway, and CARE USA (formerly simply CARE) in attendance.<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\nCARE International would expand significantly during the 1980s, with the addition of CARE France in 1983;<ref name=\"France History\" /> CARE International UK in 1985;<ref name=\"UK History\" /> CARE Austria in 1986;<ref name=\"Austria History\" /> and CARE Australia, CARE Denmark, and CARE Japan in 1987.<ref name=\"CARE Australia History\">{{cite web|title=CARE Australia History|url=https://www.care.org.au/who-we-are/history/|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Denmark History\" /><ref name=\"Japan History\" />\n\n=== 1990\u2013present: Recent history ===\n\nAlong with broader development work CARE's projects in the 1980s and early 1990s focused particularly on [[agroforestry]] initiatives such as [[reforestation]] and [[soil conservation]] in [[eastern Africa]] and [[South America]]. CARE also responded to a number of major emergencies during this period, notably the [[1983\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia]] and the 1991\u20131992 famine in [[Somalia]].<ref name=\"O\u2019Keefe\" />\n\nThe 1990s also saw an evolution in CARE's approach to poverty. Originally CARE had viewed poverty primarily as a lack of basic goods and services such as food, clean water, and health care. As CARE's scope expanded both geographically and topically this approach was expanded to include the view that poverty was in many cases caused by [[social exclusion]], marginalization, and [[discrimination]]. In the early 1990s CARE adopted a household [[Sustainable livelihood|livelihood]] security framework which included a multidimensional view of poverty as encompassing not only physical resources but also social position and human capacities. As a result of this, by 2000, CARE had adopted a [[rights-based approach to development]].<ref name=\"Rangan\" />\n\nOne of their buildings was attacked, and people were killed and wounded, during the [[September 2016 Kabul attacks]].\n\n==== Microfinance ====\nIn the early 1990s CARE also developed what would become an important model for cooperative [[microfinance]].\n\nThis model is called the Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs) and it began in 1991 as a pilot project run by CARE's Country Office in [[Niger]].<ref name=\"Hamadziripi\" /> The pilot project was called Mata Masu Dubara (MMD) and CARE Niger developed the VSLA model by adapting the model of [[Rotating Savings and Credit Association|Accumulating Savings and Credit Associations]] (ASCAs). VSLAs involve groups of about 15-30 people who regularly save and borrow using a group fund. Member savings create capital that can be used for short-term loans and capital and interest is shared among the group at the end of a given period (usually about a year), at which point the groups normally re-form to begin a new cycle. Because the bookkeeping required to manage a VSLA is quite simple most groups successfully become independent (needing no outside management help) within a year and enjoy a high rate of long-term group survival.<ref name=\" Anyango\" /> CARE has created over 40,000 VSLAs (over 1 million members total) across Africa, Asia, and Latin America<ref name=\"Hamadziripi\" /> and in 2008 launched Access Africa which aims to extend VSLA training to 39 African countries by 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Micro finance Africa Report|url=http://www.care.org/sites/default/files/documents/MF-2011-Access-Africa-Progress-Report.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe model has also been widely replicated in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] and by other large NGOs including [[Oxfam]], [[Plan International]], and [[Catholic Relief Services]].<ref name=\" Allen\" />\n\nCARE UK later launched [[lendwithcare.org]], which allows members of the public to make [[microloans]], including green loans, to entrepreneurs in Africa and Asia. It avoids many of the criticisms levelled at [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva.org]].\n\n==== Acronym redefinition and 50th anniversary ====\nIn 1993 CARE, to reflect its international organizational structure, changed the meaning of its acronym for a third time, adopting its current name the \"Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere\". CARE also marked its 50th anniversary in 1994.<ref name=\" Rangan\" />\n\nCARE expanded the confederation to twelve members in the early 2000s, with CARE Netherlands (formerly the Disaster Relief Agency) joining in 2001<ref name=\"Netherlands History\" /> and CARE Thailand (called the Raks Thai Foundation) joining in 2003, becoming the first CARE National Member in a developing country.<ref name=\"Thailand History\" />\n\nCARE's well-known \"I am Powerful\" campaign launched in the USA in September 2006 and was intended to bring public attention to the organization's long-standing focus on [[women's empowerment]].<ref name=\"Rangan\" /> CARE states that its programs focus on women and girls both because the world's poor are [[Feminization of poverty|disproportionately female]] and because women's empowerment is thought to be an important driver of development. CARE also emphasizes that it considers working with boys and men an important part of women's empowerment, and that women's empowerment benefits both genders.<ref name=\"Annual Report 2013\" />\n\nIn 2007 CARE announced that by 2009 it would no longer accept certain types of US food aid worth some $45 million a year, arguing that these types of food aid are inefficient and harmful to local markets.<ref name=\"Dugger\" /><ref name=\"Harrell\" /> Specifically, CARE announced that it would forego all [[Monetization of U.S. in-kind food aid|monetized food aid]] (surplus US food shipped to charities in the developing world who then sell the food on the local market to finance development projects)<ref name=\"Harrell\" /> and all food aid intended to establish a commercial advantage for the donor, and would increase its commitment to buying food aid locally.<ref name=\"CARE White Paper\" /> CARE also announced that it would no longer accept [[USDA]] food through [[Food for Peace#Title 1|Title 1]] (concessional sales) or Section 416 (surplus disposal) because these programs are intended mainly to establish a commercial advantage for US agriculture.<ref name=\"CARE White Paper\" />\n\nIn 2011 CARE added its first Affiliate Member, CARE India, and in 2012 the CI board accepted CARE Peru as CARE's second Affiliate Member.<ref name=\"Annual Report 2013\" /> CARE India became a full member in November 2013. The CI board accepted CARE Peru as a full member of the confederation in June 2015.\n\nCARE is currently one of the only major NGOs to make their database of [[project evaluation]]s publicly available, and to regularly conduct a [[meta-analysis]] of evaluation methodologies and overall organizational impact.<ref name=\"Give Well\" /><ref name=\"evaluations library\" />\n\n=== Presidents of CARE ===\n*1945: Clarence Picket (temporary chairman)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The History of CARE: A Personal Account Wallace J.
