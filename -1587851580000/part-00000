Many of these men not only produced art and intellectual culture, but they also were the passionate audiences that nurtured such culture.

And with AIDS, a whole generation of gay men died practically all at once, within a couple of years. And especially the ones that I knew. The first people who died of AIDS were artists. They were also the most interesting people... The knowing audience also died and no longer exists in a real way...

I was, unfortunately, largely right.\" However, she had also said, \"The way girls are raised now. It\u2019s so different... when I was a child.

Many of these men not only produced art and intellectual culture, but they also were the passionate audiences that nurtured such culture.

And with AIDS, a whole generation of gay men died practically all at once, within a couple of years. And especially the ones that I knew. The first people who died of AIDS were artists. They were also the most interesting people... The knowing audience also died and no longer exists in a real way...

The Clark Sisters are the daughters of gospel musician and choral director Dr. [[Mattie Moss Clark]]. They are credited for helping to bring gospel music to the mainstream and are considered as pioneers of contemporary gospel. Their biggest hits include: \"Is My Living in Vain\", \"Hallelujah\", \"He Gave Me Nothing to Lose\", \"Endow Me\", \"Jesus Is A Love Song\", \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\", \"Pure Gold\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", and their mainstream crossover hit, \"You Brought the Sunshine\".

Dr. Clark was married twice: her first marriage in 1945 to Leo H. Cullum, Sr. produced two children, Leo, Jr. and Jacqueline (Jacky).  After her divorce, she met and later married Pastor Elbert Clark in 1952. This marriage produced four daughters: Denise, Elbernita (Twinkie), Dorinda, and Karen. They each began singing at an early age in the choir at their father's church, and by the late 1960s they were all performing together in church services, usually singing songs written and arranged by their mother. Shortly after the Clarks' divorce in 1973, Dr. Clark formally created \"the Clark Sisters\" and the sisters recorded their first album, ''Jesus Has A Lot To Give'', on their uncle (their mother's younger brother) [[Bill Moss (musician)|Bill Moss]]' local label Billesse Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jlentertainment.com/artistbio.cfm?artistname=The%20Clark%20Sisters|title=The Clark Sisters Biography|publisher=JLEntertainment.com}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, ''Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents the Clark Sisters'' was released and people around Detroit began to take notice of the group. The Clark Sisters signed to Sound of Gospel Records in 1974. Under this association, the group released albums such as ''Unworthy'', ''Count It All Joy'', and ''[[He Gave Me Nothing to Lose]]'', which hit the top 20 of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Spiritual LPs chart.<ref name=\"Spiritual LPs Nov 1 1980\"/><ref name=\"Spiritual LPs Dec 6 1980\"/> By this point, Dr. Clark had turned over control of the group to Twinkie, who continued to write, arrange, conduct, and produce all of the Clark Sisters' recordings. Their popularity soared with the release of the live recording ''Is My Living In Vain'', which gradually grew in popularity. Their debut live recording was first ranked on the 1981 ''Billboard'' Spiritual Albums year-end chart at number 21, before topping the year-end Spiritual Albums chart of 1982.<ref name=\"Spiritual Year-End 1981\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BCQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT83&dq=is+my+living+in+vain+billboard&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwif7PL24oPpAhVpVRUIHar-BLUQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=is%20my%20living%20in%20vain%20billboard&f=false|title=SPIRITUAL ALBUMS|page=YE-32|publication-date=December 26, 1981|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|via=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=April 25, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Top Spiritual Albums 1982\"/> Opening with the bluesy title track, each sister vocally declares that their dedication to Christ is not a useless effort. The innovative \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\" was funky enough to find its way into a Tonex produced track over two decades later. Karen Clark's lead on \"Speak Lord\" expresses deep faith while the call to worship is raised on \"Now Is The Time\". Another hit from this release, \"Expect Your Miracle\", is still a staple in African American churches across the country.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110045508/http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |archivedate=January 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nTheir next release ''[[You Brought the Sunshine]]'' (1981) would result in unprecendent success due to its title track.

This new deal yielded the Grammy-nominated ''Heart & Soul'' featuring the mainstream single \"Time Out\". This project made a top 5 debut on Billboard's Gospel Charts and garnered the group a coveted Dove Award. It featured the original versions of \"Jesus is a Love Song\", \"There is a Balm in Gilead\", and \"Pray for the USA\", which has been re-recorded several times. Although not pictured, Denise had contributed to the album before her departure. The music took on a more contemporary sound with programmed drums and synthesizers. Also included on this album were \"Smile, God Loves You\", \"Time Out\", \"I Am Blessed\", and the funky \"He\u2019ll Turn Your Scars Into Stars.\"<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1988, the Clark Sisters released their Billboard chart-topping and critically acclaimed album ''Conqueror''. It featured a bolder, more intense sound, with synthesizers, drum machines and more funk-oriented beats. ''Conqueror'' quickly became a fan favorite with hits like \"The Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\", \"Take Me Higher\", \"For the Love of the People\", \"Computers Rule the World\", and the original studio version of \"Jesus Forevermore\".<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1989, the Clark Sisters released their highly anticipated live album, ''Bringing it Back Home'', recorded in their home town of Detroit. It was the last recording from the Clark Sisters on Word Records\u2019 Rejoice imprint and the last group album with Twinkie just before the launch of her solo career. The album included both previous hits and new material. It featured guest appearances from gospel icon [[Rance Allen]] and backing choir vocals from the Michigan State Choir under the direction of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1994, the Clark Sisters released their last studio album before breaking grounds into their successful solo careers. Their last studio album of the decade, ''Miracle'', was the first album the Clark Sisters recorded without the songwriting and vocals of sister Twinkie. Produced by [[BeBe Winans]] & [[Michael J. Powell]], this disc features a very pop version of the Clark Sisters classic \"Expect Your Miracle\" (now titled \"Miracle\") and a remake of the classic \"Jesus is The Best Thing\". Dorinda made her songwriting debut on a Clark Sisters recording with \"Work to Do\". That album, although it fared well in sales, did not match the success of previous albums due to the Clark Sisters not being able to tour and promote the project, due to the illness of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, who died in September 1994 from diabetes complications.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===Emerging solo artists===\nFollowing their last Word Records release, Twinkie resumed her calling as a minister and her solo career. She had previously released two solo albums under the Sound of Gospel Record label: 1979's ''Praise Belongs to God'' and 1981's ''Ye Shall Receive Power'', both of which have become classics.  In 1992 she recorded her independent solo album ''Comin' Home''.  She re-appeared in 1996 with a pair of albums to her credit: the solo studio release ''The Masterpiece'' for [[Ben Tankard]]'s [[Tribute Records]] label and the live project ''Twinkie Clark-Terrell Presents the Florida A&M University Gospel Choir''.  She later released the following albums: ''Twinkie Clark & Friends: Live in Charlotte'' in 2002, ''Home Once Again: Live in Detroit'' in 2004, ''With Humility'' in 2011, ''Live & Unplugged'' in 2015, and with her nephew Larry Clark (her sister Denise's oldest son) ''The Generations'' in 2020. \n\nKaren delivered her solo debut ''[[Finally Karen (album)|Finally Karen]]'' in 1997. The album, featuring star turns from the Clark Sisters, [[Faith Evans]], and daughter [[Kierra Sheard]], was nominated for a Grammy Award, in addition to winning a [[Soul Train Lady of Soul Award|Soul Train Lady of Soul]] award. She has since released five more solo albums: ''[[2nd Chance (Karen Clark Sheard album)|2nd Chance]]'', ''[[The Heavens Are Telling (album)|The Heavens Are Telling]]'', ''[[It's Not Over (Karen Clark Sheard album)|It's Not Over]]'', ''[[All in One (Karen Clark Sheard album)|All in One]], and [[Destined to Win]]. ''\n\nDorinda released her self-titled debut solo album, [[Dorinda Clark-Cole]] in 2002, earning her two [[Stellar Awards]], and a Soul Train Lady of Soul award. She has since released four more solo albums: ''Live in Houston'' and ''Take It Back'', each of which have earned her the award for Female Vocalist of the Year at the Stellar Awards; ''I Survived'' in 2011, and in 2015, she released her fifth solo album, ''Living It'', which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album. \n\nJacky released her first solo project, ''Expectancy'', in 2005, which features the Clark Sisters on the track \"Blessing Me.\" In 2014, she released an urban inspired single \u201cMy Season\u201d followed by singles \u201cCover Me\u201d and \u201cShout\u201d. In February 2020, she released a single \"Feel Good\", featuring Mary J. Blige and rapper Tia P.\n\nThe Clark Sisters have all contributed in various capacities to each other's albums, whether they sang or wrote lyrics.\n\n===Live...One Last Time===\nOn July 8, 2006, the Clark Sisters (Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen) recorded a live album in [[Houston, Texas]] entitled ''Live...One Last Time''.

Their first release in over a decade, features production from J. Drew Sheard, II, [[Warryn Campbell|Warryn Campell]], [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], Mano Hines, and [[Kurt Carr]], with a special feature by [[Snoop Dogg]] on the track, \"His Love\".\n\n==\"The Clark Sound\"==\nThe Clark Sisters are renowned for their vocal stylings, dubbed as \"the Clark Sound.\" They incorporate high and fast [[melisma]]s, acrobatic [[trill (music)|trills]] and [[riffs]], and deep, soulful [[growling|growls]], or \"squalls\". The sisters are also known for the individual distinctive sounds that they contribute. Jacky ([[alto]]/[[tenor]]) is known for her sweet, soft, smooth, and deeper vocals. Dorinda ([[alto]]/[[mezzo-soprano]]), the \"jazzy\" sister, inputs [[Scat singing|scats]], riffs, and runs with a fervency that places her in a class of her own. She has an innate ability to make each song her very own and she is a preacher to be reckoned with. Denise ([[soprano]]) was known for her high pitched, youthful singing voice and used her piercing soprano vocals, which are clearly heard on the group's first ten albums. She was also known for her runs and high melismas. Karen([[soprano]]) is known for her unique riffs, runs, growls, scats, very vast vocal range, ability to belt whilst in the whistle range, and has also been known to implement an \"echo\" in her live performances. Twinkie, credited with being \"the Heart of the Clark Sisters\", is known for her complex runs, riffs, powerful mixed-voice belts, soulful squalls, deep growls, and large vocal range spanning from high soprano to baritone--a range very few women have. One of the highest notes recorded by Twinkie came in one of the songs she penned, \u201cThe Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\u201d, hitting a powerful F6 (an F in the 6th octave). Early in the group's development, Twinkie was the chief songwriter, music and vocal arranger, and producer.\n\nThere is no single lead vocalist in the group. Jacky leads songs such as \"Wonderful Counselor,\" \"I've Got An Angel,\" \"So Much Joy\", and \"God Understands All\". Dorinda leads \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost,\" \"Time Out\", \"My Redeemer Liveth\", \"I Won't Let Go 'Til You Bless My Soul\", \"Determination\", \"Looking To Get There (Heaven)\", and \"Sanctify Me Lord\".  Karen sings lead on \"A Praying Spirit\", \"Hallelujah,\" \"Endow Me,\" and the Grammy-winning \"Blessed and Highly Favored.\" Twinkie leads on \"Nothing to Lose\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", \"Pray for the USA,\" \"I've Got The Victory\", and their biggest hit \"You Brought the Sunshine.\" Denise sings lead on \"Who Can I Turn To\", \"Something Worth Living For\", \"Count it All Joy\", and \"Christ is Born Today.\" She co-leads with her sister Twinkie on \"Holiness\" and \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing,\" and also with her sister Dorinda on the original version of \u201cThere Is a Balm In Gilead\u201d performed on local television shows, at concerts, and at Convocations before it was recorded on their album.\n\nThe group's sound and success have been highly influential on the contemporary genre of gospel music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theclarksisters.emigospel.com/news/|title=Lost redirect|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions, sales figures and certifications\n!

The Clark Sisters are the daughters of gospel musician and choral director Dr. [[Mattie Moss Clark]]. They are credited for helping to bring gospel music to the mainstream and are considered as pioneers of contemporary gospel. Their biggest hits include: \"Is My Living in Vain\", \"Hallelujah\", \"He Gave Me Nothing to Lose\", \"Endow Me\", \"Jesus Is A Love Song\", \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\", \"Pure Gold\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", and their mainstream crossover hit, \"You Brought the Sunshine\".

Dr. Clark was married twice: her first marriage in 1945 to Leo H. Cullum, Sr. produced two children, Leo, Jr. and Jacqueline (Jacky).  After her divorce, she met and later married Pastor Elbert Clark in 1952. This marriage produced four daughters: Denise, Elbernita (Twinkie), Dorinda, and Karen. They each began singing at an early age in the choir at their father's church, and by the late 1960s they were all performing together in church services, usually singing songs written and arranged by their mother. Shortly after the Clarks' divorce in 1973, Dr. Clark formally created \"the Clark Sisters\" and the sisters recorded their first album, ''Jesus Has A Lot To Give'', on their uncle (their mother's younger brother) [[Bill Moss (musician)|Bill Moss]]' local label Billesse Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jlentertainment.com/artistbio.cfm?artistname=The%20Clark%20Sisters|title=The Clark Sisters Biography|publisher=JLEntertainment.com}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, ''Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents the Clark Sisters'' was released and people around Detroit began to take notice of the group. The Clark Sisters signed to Sound of Gospel Records in 1974. Under this association, the group released albums such as ''Unworthy'', ''Count It All Joy'', and ''[[He Gave Me Nothing to Lose]]'', which hit the top 20 of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Spiritual LPs chart.<ref name=\"Spiritual LPs Nov 1 1980\"/><ref name=\"Spiritual LPs Dec 6 1980\"/> By this point, Dr. Clark had turned over control of the group to Twinkie, who continued to write, arrange, conduct, and produce all of the Clark Sisters' recordings. Their popularity soared with the release of the live recording ''Is My Living In Vain'', which gradually grew in popularity. Their debut live recording was first ranked on the 1981 ''Billboard'' Spiritual Albums year-end chart at number 21, before topping the year-end Spiritual Albums chart of 1982.<ref name=\"Spiritual Year-End 1981\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BCQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT83&dq=is+my+living+in+vain+billboard&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwif7PL24oPpAhVpVRUIHar-BLUQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=is%20my%20living%20in%20vain%20billboard&f=false|title=SPIRITUAL ALBUMS|page=YE-32|publication-date=December 26, 1981|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|via=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=April 25, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Top Spiritual Albums 1982\"/> Opening with the bluesy title track, each sister vocally declares that their dedication to Christ is not a useless effort. The innovative \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\" was funky enough to find its way into a Tonex produced track over two decades later. Karen Clark's lead on \"Speak Lord\" expresses deep faith while the call to worship is raised on \"Now Is The Time\". Another hit from this release, \"Expect Your Miracle\", is still a staple in African American churches across the country.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110045508/http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |archivedate=January 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nTheir next release ''[[You Brought the Sunshine]]'' (1981) would result in unprecendent success due to its title track. Reminiscent of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s \"[[Master Blaster (Jammin')]],\" the song became a hit in churches and on dance floors, including New York's [[Studio 54]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prayzehymnonline.com/articles_80scountdown.html|title=80's Countdown|publisher=PraiseHymnOnline.com|author=J.

This new deal yielded the Grammy-nominated ''Heart & Soul'' featuring the mainstream single \"Time Out\". This project made a top 5 debut on Billboard's Gospel Charts and garnered the group a coveted Dove Award. It featured the original versions of \"Jesus is a Love Song\", \"There is a Balm in Gilead\", and \"Pray for the USA\", which has been re-recorded several times. Although not pictured, Denise had contributed to the album before her departure. The music took on a more contemporary sound with programmed drums and synthesizers. Also included on this album were \"Smile, God Loves You\", \"Time Out\", \"I Am Blessed\", and the funky \"He\u2019ll Turn Your Scars Into Stars.\"<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1988, the Clark Sisters released their Billboard chart-topping and critically acclaimed album ''Conqueror''. It featured a bolder, more intense sound, with synthesizers, drum machines and more funk-oriented beats. ''Conqueror'' quickly became a fan favorite with hits like \"The Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\", \"Take Me Higher\", \"For the Love of the People\", \"Computers Rule the World\", and the original studio version of \"Jesus Forevermore\".<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1989, the Clark Sisters released their highly anticipated live album, ''Bringing it Back Home'', recorded in their home town of Detroit. It was the last recording from the Clark Sisters on Word Records\u2019 Rejoice imprint and the last group album with Twinkie just before the launch of her solo career. The album included both previous hits and new material. It featured guest appearances from gospel icon [[Rance Allen]] and backing choir vocals from the Michigan State Choir under the direction of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1994, the Clark Sisters released their last studio album before breaking grounds into their successful solo careers. Their last studio album of the decade, ''Miracle'', was the first album the Clark Sisters recorded without the songwriting and vocals of sister Twinkie. Produced by [[BeBe Winans]] & [[Michael J. Powell]], this disc features a very pop version of the Clark Sisters classic \"Expect Your Miracle\" (now titled \"Miracle\") and a remake of the classic \"Jesus is The Best Thing\". Dorinda made her songwriting debut on a Clark Sisters recording with \"Work to Do\". That album, although it fared well in sales, did not match the success of previous albums due to the Clark Sisters not being able to tour and promote the project, due to the illness of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, who died in September 1994 from diabetes complications.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===Emerging solo artists===\nFollowing their last Word Records release, Twinkie resumed her calling as a minister and her solo career. She had previously released two solo albums under the Sound of Gospel Record label: 1979's ''Praise Belongs to God'' and 1981's ''Ye Shall Receive Power'', both of which have become classics.  In 1992 she recorded her independent solo album ''Comin' Home''.  She re-appeared in 1996 with a pair of albums to her credit: the solo studio release ''The Masterpiece'' for [[Ben Tankard]]'s [[Tribute Records]] label and the live project ''Twinkie Clark-Terrell Presents the Florida A&M University Gospel Choir''.  She later released the following albums: ''Twinkie Clark & Friends: Live in Charlotte'' in 2002, ''Home Once Again: Live in Detroit'' in 2004, ''With Humility'' in 2011, ''Live & Unplugged'' in 2015, and with her nephew Larry Clark (her sister Denise's oldest son) ''The Generations'' in 2020. \n\nKaren delivered her solo debut ''[[Finally Karen (album)|Finally Karen]]'' in 1997. The album, featuring star turns from the Clark Sisters, [[Faith Evans]], and daughter [[Kierra Sheard]], was nominated for a Grammy Award, in addition to winning a [[Soul Train Lady of Soul Award|Soul Train Lady of Soul]] award. She has since released five more solo albums: ''[[2nd Chance (Karen Clark Sheard album)|2nd Chance]]'', ''[[The Heavens Are Telling (album)|The Heavens Are Telling]]'', ''[[It's Not Over (Karen Clark Sheard album)|It's Not Over]]'', ''[[All in One (Karen Clark Sheard album)|All in One]], and [[Destined to Win]]. ''\n\nDorinda released her self-titled debut solo album, [[Dorinda Clark-Cole]] in 2002, earning her two [[Stellar Awards]], and a Soul Train Lady of Soul award. She has since released four more solo albums: ''Live in Houston'' and ''Take It Back'', each of which have earned her the award for Female Vocalist of the Year at the Stellar Awards; ''I Survived'' in 2011, and in 2015, she released her fifth solo album, ''Living It'', which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album. \n\nJacky released her first solo project, ''Expectancy'', in 2005, which features the Clark Sisters on the track \"Blessing Me.\" In 2014, she released an urban inspired single \u201cMy Season\u201d followed by singles \u201cCover Me\u201d and \u201cShout\u201d. In February 2020, she released a single \"Feel Good\", featuring Mary J. Blige and rapper Tia P.\n\nThe Clark Sisters have all contributed in various capacities to each other's albums, whether they sang or wrote lyrics.\n\n===Live...One Last Time===\nOn July 8, 2006, the Clark Sisters (Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen) recorded a live album in [[Houston, Texas]] entitled ''Live...One Last Time''.  The recording was directed and produced by [[Donald Lawrence]] and was released as a [[CD]] on April 10, 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theclarksisters.com/whatsnew.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213174605/http://www.theclarksisters.com/whatsnew.htm |archivedate=February 13, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> on EMI Gospel, followed by a CD/DVD Special Edition release June 19, 2007.

Their first release in over a decade, features production from J. Drew Sheard, II, [[Warryn Campbell|Warryn Campell]], [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], Mano Hines, and [[Kurt Carr]], with a special feature by [[Snoop Dogg]] on the track, \"His Love\".\n\n==\"The Clark Sound\"==\nThe Clark Sisters are renowned for their vocal stylings, dubbed as \"the Clark Sound.\" They incorporate high and fast [[melisma]]s, acrobatic [[trill (music)|trills]] and [[riffs]], and deep, soulful [[growling|growls]], or \"squalls\". The sisters are also known for the individual distinctive sounds that they contribute. Jacky ([[alto]]/[[tenor]]) is known for her sweet, soft, smooth, and deeper vocals. Dorinda ([[alto]]/[[mezzo-soprano]]), the \"jazzy\" sister, inputs [[Scat singing|scats]], riffs, and runs with a fervency that places her in a class of her own. She has an innate ability to make each song her very own and she is a preacher to be reckoned with. Denise ([[soprano]]) was known for her high pitched, youthful singing voice and used her piercing soprano vocals, which are clearly heard on the group's first ten albums. She was also known for her runs and high melismas. Karen([[soprano]]) is known for her unique riffs, runs, growls, scats, very vast vocal range, ability to belt whilst in the whistle range, and has also been known to implement an \"echo\" in her live performances. Twinkie, credited with being \"the Heart of the Clark Sisters\", is known for her complex runs, riffs, powerful mixed-voice belts, soulful squalls, deep growls, and large vocal range spanning from high soprano to baritone--a range very few women have. One of the highest notes recorded by Twinkie came in one of the songs she penned, \u201cThe Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\u201d, hitting a powerful F6 (an F in the 6th octave). Early in the group's development, Twinkie was the chief songwriter, music and vocal arranger, and producer.\n\nThere is no single lead vocalist in the group. Jacky leads songs such as \"Wonderful Counselor,\" \"I've Got An Angel,\" \"So Much Joy\", and \"God Understands All\". Dorinda leads \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost,\" \"Time Out\", \"My Redeemer Liveth\", \"I Won't Let Go 'Til You Bless My Soul\", \"Determination\", \"Looking To Get There (Heaven)\", and \"Sanctify Me Lord\".  Karen sings lead on \"A Praying Spirit\", \"Hallelujah,\" \"Endow Me,\" and the Grammy-winning \"Blessed and Highly Favored.\" Twinkie leads on \"Nothing to Lose\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", \"Pray for the USA,\" \"I've Got The Victory\", and their biggest hit \"You Brought the Sunshine.\" Denise sings lead on \"Who Can I Turn To\", \"Something Worth Living For\", \"Count it All Joy\", and \"Christ is Born Today.\" She co-leads with her sister Twinkie on \"Holiness\" and \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing,\" and also with her sister Dorinda on the original version of \u201cThere Is a Balm In Gilead\u201d performed on local television shows, at concerts, and at Convocations before it was recorded on their album.\n\nThe group's sound and success have been highly influential on the contemporary genre of gospel music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theclarksisters.emigospel.com/news/|title=Lost redirect|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions, sales figures and certifications\n!

{"title_page": "Cat's eye (road)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n[[Image:LIGHTDOME.JPG|thumb|right|Original form cat's eye, UK]]\nA '''cat's eye''' or '''road stud''' is a [[retroreflective]] [[Road safety|safety device]] used in [[road marking]] and was the first of a range of [[raised pavement marker]]s. \n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Katzenauge2.jpg|thumb|upright|Cat's eye glass body and principle of operation; back face is mirror-coated]] \nThe cat's eye design originated in the UK in 1934 and is today used all over the world. The original form consisted of two pairs of [[Retroreflector|reflective]] glass spheres set into a white rubber dome, mounted in a [[cast iron]] housing. This is the kind that marks the centre of the road, with one pair of cat's eyes showing in each direction. A single-ended form has become widely used in other colours at road margins and as lane dividers. Cat's eyes are particularly valuable in fog and are largely resistant to damage from [[Snowplow|snow ploughs]].\n\nA key feature of the cat's eye is the flexible rubber dome which is occasionally deformed by the passage of traffic. A fixed rubber wiper cleans the surface of the reflectors as they sink below the surface of the road (the base tends to hold water after a shower of rain, making this process even more efficient). The rubber dome is protected from impact damage by metal 'kerbs' \u2013 which also give tactile and audible feedback for wandering drivers.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Catseye closeup.jpg|thumb|right|Double-ended cat's eye is Shaw's original design and marks road centre-line]]\nThe inventor of cat's eyes was [[Percy Shaw]] of [[Boothtown]], [[Halifax, West Yorkshire]], England.

Red is used for the left side of a dual carriageway, while amber is used for the right side of a dual carriageway.\n* Green indicates a line that may be crossed, such as a slip road or lay-by.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/773421/traffic-signs-manual-chapter-05.pdf|title=Traffic Signs Manual|publisher=The Stationery Office|year=2018|isbn=978 0 11 553208 5|location=London|pages=48|chapter=Chapter 5 - Road Markings|access-date=25 April 2020|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20191215110333/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/773421/traffic-signs-manual-chapter-05.pdf|archive-date=15 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThese units are not very visible in daylight and are generally used in conjunction with traditionally painted lines. Temporary cat's eyes with just a reflective strip are often used during motorway repair work. These are typically day glow green/yellow so they are easily visible in daylight as well as in darkness, they can then be used on their own for lane division.\n\nAlso seen during motorway repair work are plastic traffic pillars that are inserted into the socket of a retractable cat's eye rather than being free-standing. These are often used in conjunction with two rows of the temporary cat's eyes to divide traffic moving in opposite directions during motorway roadworks.\n\nSolar-powered cat's eyes known as solar road studs and showing a red or amber [[LED]] to traffic, have been introduced on roads regarded as particularly dangerous at locations throughout the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astucia.co.uk/case-studies?pageIndex=0|title=Case studies|publisher=Astucia Traffic Safety Systems|accessdate=13 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title =Cats eyes to improve safety on A65, North Yorkshire| publisher =Government News Network| date =6 November 2006| url =http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=239967&NewsAreaID=2| accessdate =15 March 2008| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165256/http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=239967&NewsAreaID=2| archivedate =30 September 2007}}</ref> However, shortly after one such installation in [[Essex]] in the autumn of 2006 the [[BBC]] reported that the devices, which flash at an almost imperceptibly fast rate of 100 times a second, could possibly set off [[epileptic fit]]s and the [[Highways Agency]] had suspended the programme.<ref>{{cite news  | title = New cat's eye 'could trigger fit'  | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 2 January 2007  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/essex/6226285.stm  | accessdate =15 March 2008 }}</ref> The suspension appeared to have been lifted by 2015, when LED cat's eyes began to be installed along newly re-paved sections of the A1 and A1(M) in [[County Durham]] and [[Tyne and Wear]].  \n\nFlashing blue LED cat's eyes were demonstrated on the TV show ''Accident Black Spot'', aired on [[Channel 4]] on 19 December 2000, which alert the driver to potential ice on the road when a low enough temperature, provisionally set at {{convert|3|C}}, is reached.

In addition, standalone reflector batons are often used on the verge of Irish roads. Green cat's eyes are used to alert motorists to upcoming junctions. There are limited installations of actively powered cats eyes, which flash white light, on particularly dangerous sections of road such as the single carriageway sections of the N11.\n\n===United States===\n[[Botts' dots]] (research started 1953, compulsory in California from 1966) and other raised carriageway markers perform a similar function in areas of the United States that receive little snowfall.  In areas of the US receiving substantial accumulating snowfall that requires the use of [[snow removal]] equipment, recessed markers or those encased in protective metal are frequently used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiadot.org/business/resources/bu-mat-PaveMarkCh9.pdf |title=Pavement Markers |publisher=Virginia Department of Transportation |accessdate=15 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408114004/http://www.virginiadot.org/business/resources/bu-mat-PaveMarkCh9.pdf |archivedate=8 April 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===New Zealand===\nIn New Zealand, roads are generally marked with both [[Botts' dots]] and cat's eyes (typically there is one cat's eye followed by three Botts' dots places in every ten-metre stretch of highway). The colour pattern on New Zealand roads is white or yellow cat's eyes along the centre of the road (yellow indicating overtaking is not permitted) and red dots along the hard shoulder or left edge of a motorway. Single blue cat's eyes are used to indicate the location of fire hydrants, and green cat's eyes are used to mark the edge of culverts. In rural settings and along [[New Zealand State Highway network|State Highways]], these markings are augmented by retroreflective posts along the edge of the road (white reflectors on the left, yellow reflectors on the right). Bridges are similarly marked with retroreflective markings in diagonal bands of white and black (to the left) and yellow and black (to the right).<ref>\"[https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/marking-the-edge-of-the-road-with-markers-and-cats-eyes/ Marking the edge of the road with markers and cat\u2019s eyes]\", ''New Zealand Driving Test Resources''. Retrieved 17 August 2017.</ref>\n\n===Continental Europe===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Cateye.jpg|thumb|Road-mounted yellow cat's eyes mark road works (Germany)]]\nBy contrast to the UK where use of cat's eyes is widespread, in Continental Europe, cat's eyes are almost completely absent as a permanent fixture. Some road users, especially cyclists and motorcyclists, consider cat's eyes unnecessary as an additional lane or position marking identification and actually pose a threat to safety upon impact due to their prominent, slippery and unforgiving nature \u2013 particularly in the wet \u2013 and of their propensity to be located in close proximity to areas of increased hazard. It is also suggested that the additional emphasis of an already brightly visible and reflective painted lane marking is simply not required for any potential road event or condition. Many also consider that the absence of cat's eyes reduces the risk of physical and audible discomfort when driving, and that their benefits to safety are exaggerated.\n\n===Lebanon===\n\nIn Lebanon, cat's eyes are widely used on most freeways, highways and roadways. On freeways and highways, every one (or sometimes two) white stripes separating lanes is followed by a white shining cat's eye. On the edge of the road next to the median strip, a yellow cat's eye is placed every {{convert|10|m|ft}}. On the road shoulders a red shining cat's eye is placed every {{convert|10|m|ft}}. On roadways separated by double yellow lines, a yellow cat's eye is placed inside the double yellow lines every {{convert|10|m|ft}}. Before speed bumps, a series of cat's eyes are placed shining white to the oncoming traffic and red to the car from the opposite direction. On pedestrian crossings, blue shining cat's eyes are placed after every zebra line. On roads with traffic lights, a series of red shining cat's eyes are placed {{convert|50|m|ft}} before traffic lights to make drivers slow down.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Safety==\nIn the morning of 25 April 1999 on the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3 motorway]] in Hampshire, England, a van dislodged the steel body of a cat's eye which flew through the windscreen of a following car and hit a passenger (the [[drum and bass]] DJ known as [[Kemistry]]) in the face, killing her instantly.

Red is used for the left side of a dual carriageway, while amber is used for the right side of a dual carriageway.\n* Green indicates a line that may be crossed, such as a slip road or lay-by.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/773421/traffic-signs-manual-chapter-05.pdf|title=Traffic Signs Manual|publisher=The Stationery Office|year=2018|isbn=978 0 11 553208 5|location=London|pages=48|chapter=Chapter 5 - Road Markings|access-date=25 April 2020|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20191215110333/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/773421/traffic-signs-manual-chapter-05.pdf|archive-date=15 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThese units are not very visible in daylight and are generally used in conjunction with traditionally painted lines. Temporary cat's eyes with just a reflective strip are often used during motorway repair work. These are typically day glow green/yellow so they are easily visible in daylight as well as in darkness, they can then be used on their own for lane division.\n\nAlso seen during motorway repair work are plastic traffic pillars that are inserted into the socket of a retractable cat's eye rather than being free-standing. These are often used in conjunction with two rows of the temporary cat's eyes to divide traffic moving in opposite directions during motorway roadworks.\n\nSolar-powered cat's eyes known as solar road studs and showing a red or amber [[LED]] to traffic, have been introduced on roads regarded as particularly dangerous at locations throughout the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astucia.co.uk/case-studies?pageIndex=0|title=Case studies|publisher=Astucia Traffic Safety Systems|accessdate=13 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title =Cats eyes to improve safety on A65, North Yorkshire| publisher =Government News Network| date =6 November 2006| url =http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=239967&NewsAreaID=2| accessdate =15 March 2008| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165256/http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=239967&NewsAreaID=2| archivedate =30 September 2007}}</ref> However, shortly after one such installation in [[Essex]] in the autumn of 2006 the [[BBC]] reported that the devices, which flash at an almost imperceptibly fast rate of 100 times a second, could possibly set off [[epileptic fit]]s and the [[Highways Agency]] had suspended the programme.<ref>{{cite news  | title = New cat's eye 'could trigger fit'  | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 2 January 2007  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/essex/6226285.stm  | accessdate =15 March 2008 }}</ref> The suspension appeared to have been lifted by 2015, when LED cat's eyes began to be installed along newly re-paved sections of the A1 and A1(M) in [[County Durham]] and [[Tyne and Wear]].  \n\nFlashing blue LED cat's eyes were demonstrated on the TV show ''Accident Black Spot'', aired on [[Channel 4]] on 19 December 2000, which alert the driver to potential ice on the road when a low enough temperature, provisionally set at {{convert|3|C}}, is reached.

In addition, standalone reflector batons are often used on the verge of Irish roads. Green cat's eyes are used to alert motorists to upcoming junctions. There are limited installations of actively powered cats eyes, which flash white light, on particularly dangerous sections of road such as the single carriageway sections of the N11.\n\n===United States===\n[[Botts' dots]] (research started 1953, compulsory in California from 1966) and other raised carriageway markers perform a similar function in areas of the United States that receive little snowfall.  In areas of the US receiving substantial accumulating snowfall that requires the use of [[snow removal]] equipment, recessed markers or those encased in protective metal are frequently used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiadot.org/business/resources/bu-mat-PaveMarkCh9.pdf |title=Pavement Markers |publisher=Virginia Department of Transportation |accessdate=15 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408114004/http://www.virginiadot.org/business/resources/bu-mat-PaveMarkCh9.pdf |archivedate=8 April 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===New Zealand===\nIn New Zealand, roads are generally marked with both [[Botts' dots]] and cat's eyes (typically there is one cat's eye followed by three Botts' dots places in every ten-metre stretch of highway). The colour pattern on New Zealand roads is white or yellow cat's eyes along the centre of the road (yellow indicating overtaking is not permitted) and red dots along the hard shoulder or left edge of a motorway. Single blue cat's eyes are used to indicate the location of fire hydrants, and green cat's eyes are used to mark the edge of culverts. In rural settings and along [[New Zealand State Highway network|State Highways]], these markings are augmented by retroreflective posts along the edge of the road (white reflectors on the left, yellow reflectors on the right). Bridges are similarly marked with retroreflective markings in diagonal bands of white and black (to the left) and yellow and black (to the right).<ref>\"[https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/marking-the-edge-of-the-road-with-markers-and-cats-eyes/ Marking the edge of the road with markers and cat\u2019s eyes]\", ''New Zealand Driving Test Resources''. Retrieved 17 August 2017.</ref>\n\n===Continental Europe===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Cateye.jpg|thumb|Road-mounted yellow cat's eyes mark road works (Germany)]]\nBy contrast to the UK where use of cat's eyes is widespread, in Continental Europe, cat's eyes are almost completely absent as a permanent fixture. Some road users, especially cyclists and motorcyclists, consider cat's eyes unnecessary as an additional lane or position marking identification and actually pose a threat to safety upon impact due to their prominent, slippery and unforgiving nature \u2013 particularly in the wet \u2013 and of their propensity to be located in close proximity to areas of increased hazard. It is also suggested that the additional emphasis of an already brightly visible and reflective painted lane marking is simply not required for any potential road event or condition. Many also consider that the absence of cat's eyes reduces the risk of physical and audible discomfort when driving, and that their benefits to safety are exaggerated.\n\n===Lebanon===\n\nIn Lebanon, cat's eyes are widely used on most freeways, highways and roadways. On freeways and highways, every one (or sometimes two) white stripes separating lanes is followed by a white shining cat's eye. On the edge of the road next to the median strip, a yellow cat's eye is placed every {{convert|10|m|ft}}. On the road shoulders a red shining cat's eye is placed every {{convert|10|m|ft}}. On roadways separated by double yellow lines, a yellow cat's eye is placed inside the double yellow lines every {{convert|10|m|ft}}. Before speed bumps, a series of cat's eyes are placed shining white to the oncoming traffic and red to the car from the opposite direction. On pedestrian crossings, blue shining cat's eyes are placed after every zebra line. On roads with traffic lights, a series of red shining cat's eyes are placed {{convert|50|m|ft}} before traffic lights to make drivers slow down.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Safety==\nIn the morning of 25 April 1999 on the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3 motorway]] in Hampshire, England, a van dislodged the steel body of a cat's eye which flew through the windscreen of a following car and hit a passenger (the [[drum and bass]] DJ known as [[Kemistry]]) in the face, killing her instantly.

It is sometimes known as \"The First City of Venezuela\", for being the first city in Venezuela to adopt various types of public services, including electricity, as well as for being located adjacent to shores of Lake Maracaibo, where the name of Venezuela allegedly originates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geographia.com/venezuela/history.htm|title=Venezuela - An Introduction|website=www.geographia.com|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref> \n\nEarly indigenous settlements around the area were of [[Arawaks|Arawak]] and [[Kalina people|Carib]] origin.

There were failed attempts to found the city\u2014in 1529, by Captain [[Ambrosius Ehinger|Ambrosio Ehinger]], and in 1569, by Captain [https://www.britannica.com/place/Maracaibo Alonso Pacheco]. Founded in 1574 as Nueva Zamora de la Laguna de Maracaibo by Captain [https://www.britannica.com/place/Maracaibo Captain Pedro Maldonado], the city became a transshipment point for inland settlements after [[Gibraltar, Venezuela|Gibraltar]], at the head of the lake, had been destroyed by pirates in 1669. It was not until the first decades of the 17th century that the first town was settled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Maracaibo|title=Maracaibo {{!}} Venezuela|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref> Petroleum was discovered in 1917, leading to a large increase in population from migration.\n\nMaracaibo is served by [[La Chinita International Airport]].

The [[La Chiquinquir\u00e1 Church (Maracaibo)|La Chiquinquir\u00e1 Church]] catholic church within the city.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe name Maracaibo is said to come from the brave ''[[cacique]]'' (Indian chief) Mara, a young native who valiantly resisted the Spaniards and died fighting them. Legend says that when Mara fell, the Indians shouted \"''Mara kay\u00f3!''\" (Mara fell!), thus originating the city name --although it would be strange for them to shout in Spanish. Other historians say that the first name of this land in the local language was \"Maara-iwo\" meaning \"Place where serpents abound\".\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Royal Coat of Arms of New Zamora of Maracaibo.svg|thumb|First version of Coat of Arms with royal elements, according to ''Discrezi\u00f3n de la laguna de la ciudad de Maracaibo'' in [[General Archive of the Indies]].|left|200px]]\n\n===Foundation===\nThe first indigenous settlements were of [[Arawaks|Arawak]] and [[Kalina people|Carib]] origin. Around the main group were the [[A\u00f1u]] tribe who built rows of [[stilt house]]s all over the northern riviera of the Lake Maracaibo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efemeridesvenezolanas.com/html/maracaibo.htm|title=Error|author=Irama Iglesias|work=efemeridevenezolana}}</ref> The first Europeans arrived in 1499.\n\nThe city was founded three times: the first time was during the [[Klein-Venedig]] period (1528&ndash;1546), when the [[Welser]] bankers of [[Augsburg]] received a concession over [[Venezuela Province]] from [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I. of Spain]]. In August 1529, the German [[Ambrosius Ehinger]] made his first expedition to [[Lake Maracaibo]], which was bitterly opposed by the indigenous [[Coquivacoa]]. After winning a series of bloody battles, he founded the settlement on 8 September 1529. Ehinger named the settlement New Nuremberg ({{lang-de|Neu-N\u00fcrnberg}}) and the lake after the valiant [[cacique|chieftain]] Mara of the Coquivacoa, who had died in the fighting. The city was renamed Maracaibo after the Spanish took possession.<ref>[http://www.wasistwas.de/geschichte/alle-artikel/artikel/link//aafd6793cf/article/das-imperium-der-welser/-7c05c71e06.html Das Imperium der Welser] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422023929/http://www.wasistwas.de/geschichte/alle-artikel/artikel/link//aafd6793cf/article/das-imperium-der-welser/-7c05c71e06.html |date=2012-04-22 }}</ref> The lack of activity in the zone made [[Nikolaus Federmann]] evacuate the village in 1535 and move its population to [[Santa Marta]] near the then capital of [[Venezuela Province]], [[Santa Ana de Coro]].\n\nA second attempt by Captain [https://www.britannica.com/place/Maracaibo Alonso Pacheco] in 1569 suffered a brief setback when the city had to be evacuated in 1573 due to ferocious attacks by native local tribes. The European settlement returned a short while later, in 1574, however, for which it was re-founded by Captain Pedro Maldonado under Governor [[Diego de Mazariegos]]' command and assuming the name of Nueva Zamora de Maracaibo. \"Nueva Zamora\" comes from Mazariego's place of birth, Zamora, in Spain. Since its definite foundation, the town began to develop as a whole. It is based on the western side of [[Lake Maracaibo]], the dominant feature of the oil-rich [[Maracaibo Basin]]. Favored by prevailing winds and a protected harbour, the city is located on the shores of the lake where the narrows, which eventually lead to the [[Gulf of Venezuela]], first become pronounced.\n\n===Pirates' attacks===\nThe Dutch corsair [[Henrik de Gerard]] plundered Maracaibo in 1614, and in 1642 the city was attacked by the British pirate [[William Jackson (pirate)|William Jackson]]. In 1667, [[l'Olonnais]] with a fleet of eight ships and a crew of six hundred pirates sacked Maracaibo and Gibraltar. En route, l'Olonnais crossed paths with a Spanish treasure ship, which he captured, along with its rich cargo of [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], [[gemstone]]s and more than 260,000 [[pieces of eight]].\n\nIn March 1669, [[Henry Morgan]] sacked Maracaibo, which emptied when his fleet was first spied, and moved on to the Spanish settlement of Gibraltar on the inside of Lake Maracaibo in search of more treasure. A few weeks later, when he attempted to sail out of the lake, Morgan found an occupied fort blocking the inlet to the Caribbean, along with three Spanish ships. These were the ''Magdalena'', the ''San Luis'', and the ''Soledad''. He destroyed the Magdalena and burned the San Luis by sending a dummy ship full of gunpowder to explode near them, after which the crew of the ''Soledad'' surrendered. By faking a landward attack on the fort, thereby convincing the Spanish governor to shift his cannon, he eluded their guns and escaped.<ref>''Harry Morgan's Way'', (AlisonPress, 1977), Dudley Pope, {{ISBN|978-1842324820}}</ref><ref>''Caribbean'', James A.Michener, Guild Publishing, 1989, ASIN: B00EFKMICY</ref>\n\nIn June 1678, [[Michel de Grammont]] French commander of six ships and 700 men captured Maracaibo then followed the plundering of several smaller towns as [[Gibraltar, Venezuela|Gibraltar]], penetrating as far inland as [[Trujillo, Trujillo|Trujillo]].\n\n=== Venezuelan independence ===\n\nIn 1810, the province of Maracaibo did not join the [[First Republic of Venezuela]] and remained loyal to the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish crown]]. Maracaibo then held the seat of the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]].\n\nIn 1821, uprisings in favor of independence began to lead to warfare and hostility. The [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]], led by [[Francisco Tom\u00e1s Morales]], fought with the patriots, led by [[Rafael Urdaneta]], to take back control over the province in the Juana de \u00c1vila Battle, and Morales brought back Spanish rule in 1822 until he was defeated at the [[Battle of Lake Maracaibo]] on 24 July 1823, culminating Venezuela's struggle for independence.\n\n=== Isolation period ===\nFor about 390 years, Maracaibo remained isolated and separated from the rest of the country. Transportation was only possible across the lake by ferry or other marine transport.\n\nCars, buses, and lorries, with their constant flow of manufactured goods and agricultural product, depended on the ferry system between the city and the eastern shore with their roads to connect to the country's motorway system. Maracaibo and the Lake Maracaibo region's economy was more linked to [[Colombia]] than to eastern Venezuela due to the natural route available through Lake Maracaibo then leading to the sea.\n\nThis isolation was both a challenge and an advantage. The very nature of the city's location made for a population known for their independent thought and character. The history of this region is rife with stories about the creation of an independent and sovereign nation apart from Venezuela, a nation called ''La Rep\u00fablica Independiente del Zulia'', which means ''The Independent Republic of Zulia'', but this has never come to be.\n\nIn January 1903, as the naval blockade of Venezuela continued during the negotiations with presidente [[Cipriano Castro]], the German warship ''[[SMS Panther]]'' attempted to enter [[Lake Maracaibo]], which was a center of German commercial activity. On 17 January, it exchanged fire with the settlement of Fort San Carlos, but withdrew after half an hour, as shallow waters prevented it getting close enough to the fort to be effective. The Venezuelans claimed this as a victory, and in response the German commander sent the ''[[SMS Vineta]]'', with heavier weapons, to set an example. On 21 January, the ''SMS Vineta'' bombarded the fort, setting fire to it and destroying it, with the death of 25 civilians in the nearby town.\n\nIn 1908, the ''Friesland'', [[HNLMS Gelderland (1898)|Gelderland]] and [[HNLMS Jacob van Heemskerck (1906)|Jacob van Heemskerck]]\nwere sent to patrol the Venezuelan coast during the ''[[Cipriano Castro|second Castro crisis]]''. ''Friesland'' guarded the entry way to Maracaibo.<ref name=\"scheepvaartmuseum.nl :: Maritieme kalender 1908\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hetscheepvaartmuseum.nl/knowledgebase/calendar%7C1908|publisher=Hetscheepvaartmuseum.nl|title=Maritieme kalender 1908|accessdate=2013-07-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Building of the bridge ===\n[[File:Monumento a la Chinita I.JPG|thumbnail|300px|Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquir\u00e1]]\nThe dictatorial regime of General [[Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez]] in the 1950s set as a goal the construction of a bridge connecting the two lake shores. Various bridge projects for the spanning of the Lake Maracaibo narrows near the city were in the works. The general's government had decided that this \"city of independent thought\" should be more \"connected\" to the rest of the country.\n\nProposals for a bridge design that included rail transport and tourist facilities were seriously considered. The fall of the P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez government on 23 January 1958, quickly led to a less elaborate design project that was approved and funded by a democratic and more conservative government.\n\nThe building of \"El Puente Sobre El Lago de Maracaibo \"General Rafael Urdaneta\"\u2014([[General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge]] over Lake Maracaibo) named after the distinguished General [[Rafael Urdaneta|hero]] of the War of Independence was opened to public traffic in 1962. The project was completed on schedule in 40 months.\n\nThis bridge construction project was a remarkable feat. Built under very difficult conditions, when completed, it became the longest prestressed concrete bridge in the world. The structure is in constant use and remains today as the most important link between Maracaibo, along with much of the state of Zulia, and the rest of Venezuela.\n[[File:Maracaibo city skyline july 2007.jpg|thumb|center|1000px|Panoramic view of Maracaibo City.]]\n\n=== Modern times ===\nMaracaibo has become a large metropolitan city, comprising two municipalities: to the north the municipality of Maracaibo and to the south the San Francisco municipality (established in 1995). In recent years, due to political/economic and cultural reasons, many have moved to Maracaibo from rural areas and other cities (including [[Caracas]]).\n[[File:Ancient office Mene Grande Oil Company.jpg|thumb|right|Former headquarters of the Mene Grande Oil Company]]\nIn the political arena, the citizens of Maracaibo (and most other cities and municipalities in Zulia state) have in recent years voted for a competitive political system in where the governor is from a certain political party and the mayor or mayors are from the opposite political party.\n\nMaracaibo also boasts one of the best universities in the country, the state university. ''[[University of Zulia|La Universidad del Zulia]]'' (LUZ) is well renowned for its excellent law, medical and engineering schools as many other disciplines. Other universities and schools include [[Universidad Dr. Rafael Belloso Chac\u00edn]] (URBE) and [[Universidad Rafael Urdaneta]], with one of the country's leading psychology schools.\n\nThe Diocese of Maracaibo (23 July 1965) was elevated to [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Maracaibo|Archdiocese]] on 30 April 1966 by [[Pope Paulus VI]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dmara.html#hist|title=Maracaibo (Archdiocese) [Catholic-Hierarchy]|author=David M.

The following excerpts describe the local population of Maracaibo:\n\n:''They perform coasting, or long voyages, with equal facility; and when all trade is suspended by the operations of war, they enter privateers. Bred up in the neighbourhood of the lake, they are mostly all expert swimmers and excellent divers. Their reputation stands equally high as soldiers. Those who do not enter into the sea service, form plantations, or assist in cultivating those that belong to their fathers. Nothing proves better their aptitude for this kind of occupation, than the immense flocks of cattle with which the savannas of Maracaybo {{sic}} are covered.''\n\nHe also notes the appreciation of literature, the arts, education, and culture among the people of Maracaibo:\n\n:''But what confers the greatest honour on the inhabitants of Maracaibo, is their application to literature; in which, notwithstanding the wretched state of public education, they make considerable progress....They likewise acquired the art of elocution, and of writing their mother tongue with the greatest purity; in a word, they possessed all the qualities that characterise men of letters.''\n\n==Economy==\nZulia\u00b4s main income comes from oil extraction and refining, agriculture (coffee, rice, maize, cassava, cocoa, sugar cane),\nlivestock production, and mining (clay, limestone, coal and sand{{cn|date=March 2017}}).\n\n=== Medicine ===\n[[Huntington's disease]] prevalence worldwide is 5\u201310 cases per 100,000 persons. One of the highest incidences is in the isolated populations of the Lake Maracaibo region of Venezuela, where HD affects up to 700 per 100,000 persons.<ref>\"Huntington's disease\" ''[[The Lancet]]'' 369 (9557): 218\u201328 [221]. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60111-1. {{PMID|17240289}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Location ===\nThe Maracaibo Municipality is currently divided into 18 parishes, which are\n{{Maracaibo}}\n\n===Climate===\nMaracaibo is one of the hottest cities of [[Venezuela]].

In the past, the climate of the city, indeed all along the coast of Lake Maracaibo, was unhealthy due to the combination of high temperatures with high humidity.

Maracaibo, and the rest of Zulia, are represented in [[baseball]] by the [[\u00c1guilas del Zulia]], a Venezuelan winter league team that plays in the [[Liga Venezolana de B\u00e9isbol Profesional]], and is based in the [[Estadio Luis Aparicio El Grande]]. The city's [[basketball]] team is [[Gaiteros del Zulia]], which plays in the [[Liga Profesional de Baloncesto]] de Venezuela. Its home is the 5.000-people ''Pedro El\u00edas Belisario Aponte'' stadium. Other teams include the [[Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tico Maracaibo]] and the [[Zulia FC]] in [[Football (soccer)|football]], the [[Maracaibo Rugby Football Club]] and the [[Zulianos Rugby Club]].\n\nIn the [[2000 Little League World Series]], the Sierrra Maestra Little League of Maracaibo, Venezuela defeated Bellaire Little League of Bellaire, Texas in the championship game of the 54th Little League World Series. The Coquivocoa Little League team from Maracaibo placed third in the [[1974 Little League World Series]].\n\nRugby in Venezuela was first played in Maracaibo, thanks to the influence of the English community based on the [[Zulia State]]\n\nTeam:\n* Baseball: [[\u00c1guilas del Zulia]] BBC.\n* Basketball: [[Gaiteros del Zulia]]\n* Soccer: [[Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tico Maracaibo]], [[Zulia FC]]\n* Rugby: [[Maracaibo Rugby Football Club \"Oil Blacks\"]], [[Zulianos Rugby Club]]\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Calle Carabobo de Maracaibo.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Carabobo street contains much of the city's famous colonial architecture]]\n\nCulture in Maracaibo is very indigenous and unique, is recognized in every state and city in Venezuela, and is very influential with its [[Gaita (music style)|gaitas]], desserts, style, living, and customs. Most major houses of advertising in Venezuela acknowledge how opposite the culture of Maracaibo is from that of Caracas. Studies of both prove, for example, that Caracas' leading soft drink brand is [[Coca-Cola|Coke]], while in Maracaibo it is [[Pepsi]]. This has made many brands create special localized advertising of their products (including several Pepsi commercials spoken by local celebrities).\n\nMarabinos are extremely proud of their city, their culture, and all of Zulia. They usually claim that Venezuela wouldn't be the country it actually is without Zulia. Rivalry with inhabitants of other regions is common, specially with ''Gochos'' (people of the Trujillo, [[M\u00e9rida State|M\u00e9rida]] and T\u00e1chira state) and ''[[Caraque\u00f1o]]s'' (people of the city of [[Caracas]]).\n\nThe Gaita is a style of Venezuelan folk music from Maracaibo. According to [[Joan Corominas]], it may come from gaits, the Gothic word for \"goat\", which is the skin generally used for the membrane of the furro instrument. Other instruments used in gaita include maracas, cuatro, charrasca and tambora (Venezuelan drum). Song themes range from humorous and love songs to protest songs.The style became popular throughout Venezuela in the 1960s, and it fused with other styles such as salsa and merengue in the 1970s. Famous gaita groups include Maracaibo 15, Gran Coquivacoa, Barrio Obrero, Cardenales del \u00c9xito, Koquimba, Melody Gaita, Guaco, Estrellas del Zulia, Saladillo, and many others.\n[[File:Mural (Venezuela).JPG|thumb|1000px|center|Mural in the Libertador Avenue.]]\n\n=== Museums, cultural centers and theaters ===\n[[File:Tranv\u00eda de Maracaibo I.jpg|thumb|240px|Tram of Maracaibo.]]\n* Museo de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo del estado Zulia (MACZUL)\n* Museo [[General Rafael Urdaneta]]\n* Museo Municipal de Artes Gr\u00e1ficas \"Balmiro Le\u00f3n\"\n* Centro de Bellas Artes de Maracaibo\n* Centro de Arte de Maracaibo \"[[L\u00eda Berm\u00fadez]]\"\n* [[Baralt Theater|Teatro Baralt]]\n*Museo de la Gaita\n\n=== Libraries ===\n* [http://www.bibliotecapublicadelzulia.org.ve Biblioteca Publica del Zulia]\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica \"Arturo Uslar Pietri\"\n* Biblioteca \"Dr. Pedro Alciro Barboza de la Torre\"\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica \"Sim\u00f3n Palmar\"\n* [http://www.cevaz.org Biblioteca P\u00fablica \"Lu\u00eds Guillermo Pineda Belloso\" (De car\u00e1cter p\u00fablico, biling\u00fce y circulante)]\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica Especializada \"Pedag\u00f3gica\"\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica Especializada \"SEDINI\"\n*Biblioteca Privada \"Dr. Nectario Andrade Labarca\"\n\n== Notable natives ==\n{{Cleanup|section|date=November 2010}}\n* [[Betty Cecilia Lugo]] - Philanthropist\n* [[Teolindo Acosta]] - baseball player\n* [[Guaco|Gustavo Aguado]] - musician, singer and leader of Guaco, Venezuela's most influential music band\n* [[Ricardo Aguirre]] - composer and singer\n* [[Daniel Alvarado]] - singer and actor\n* [[Wilson \u00c1lvarez]] - Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher\n* [[Ernesto Aparicio (baseball)|Ernesto Aparicio]] - Major League Baseball baseball player, manager, and team owner\n* [[Luis Aparicio]] - former shortstop in Major League Baseball and member of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]\n*[[:es:Pedro Aranguren|Pedro Aranguren]]- militar\n* [[Eduardo Arcila Far\u00edas]] - journalist and historian\n* [[Rafael Maria Baralt]] - diplomat, writer, philologist, historian, first Latin American to occupy a chair at the 'Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola'\n* [[Huascar Barradas]] - flutist\n*[[Rafael Belloso Chac\u00edn]] - physician\n* [[:es:Luis Barrera Linares|Luis Barrera Linares]] - writer, academic, teacher of [[Universidad Simon Bolivar]]\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Bracho]] - baseball pitcher\n* [[Antonio Bri\u00f1ez]] - first manager to win a National Amateur Baseball championship to Venezuela\n* [[Mar\u00eda Calca\u00f1o]] - poet\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Casanova]] - baseball player and manager of the Venezuelan team that won the gold medal in 1959 Panamerican Games\n* [[Abel Castellano Jr.]] - jockey\n* [[Javier Castellano]]- jockey [[Eclipse Award]] 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016.

It is sometimes known as \"The First City of Venezuela\", for being the first city in Venezuela to adopt various types of public services, including electricity, as well as for being located adjacent to shores of Lake Maracaibo, where the name of Venezuela allegedly originates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geographia.com/venezuela/history.htm|title=Venezuela - An Introduction|website=www.geographia.com|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref> \n\nEarly indigenous settlements around the area were of [[Arawaks|Arawak]] and [[Kalina people|Carib]] origin.

There were failed attempts to found the city\u2014in 1529, by Captain [[Ambrosius Ehinger|Ambrosio Ehinger]], and in 1569, by Captain [https://www.britannica.com/place/Maracaibo Alonso Pacheco]. Founded in 1574 as Nueva Zamora de la Laguna de Maracaibo by Captain [https://www.britannica.com/place/Maracaibo Captain Pedro Maldonado], the city became a transshipment point for inland settlements after [[Gibraltar, Venezuela|Gibraltar]], at the head of the lake, had been destroyed by pirates in 1669. It was not until the first decades of the 17th century that the first town was settled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Maracaibo|title=Maracaibo {{!}} Venezuela|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref> Petroleum was discovered in 1917, leading to a large increase in population from migration.\n\nMaracaibo is served by [[La Chinita International Airport]]. The [[General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge]] connects Maracaibo with the rest of the country. The [[La Chiquinquir\u00e1 Church (Maracaibo)|La Chiquinquir\u00e1 Church]] catholic church within the city.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe name Maracaibo is said to come from the brave ''[[cacique]]'' (Indian chief) Mara, a young native who valiantly resisted the Spaniards and died fighting them. Legend says that when Mara fell, the Indians shouted \"''Mara kay\u00f3!''\" (Mara fell!), thus originating the city name --although it would be strange for them to shout in Spanish. Other historians say that the first name of this land in the local language was \"Maara-iwo\" meaning \"Place where serpents abound\".\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Royal Coat of Arms of New Zamora of Maracaibo.svg|thumb|First version of Coat of Arms with royal elements, according to ''Discrezi\u00f3n de la laguna de la ciudad de Maracaibo'' in [[General Archive of the Indies]].|left|200px]]\n\n===Foundation===\nThe first indigenous settlements were of [[Arawaks|Arawak]] and [[Kalina people|Carib]] origin. Around the main group were the [[A\u00f1u]] tribe who built rows of [[stilt house]]s all over the northern riviera of the Lake Maracaibo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efemeridesvenezolanas.com/html/maracaibo.htm|title=Error|author=Irama Iglesias|work=efemeridevenezolana}}</ref> The first Europeans arrived in 1499.\n\nThe city was founded three times: the first time was during the [[Klein-Venedig]] period (1528&ndash;1546), when the [[Welser]] bankers of [[Augsburg]] received a concession over [[Venezuela Province]] from [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I. of Spain]]. In August 1529, the German [[Ambrosius Ehinger]] made his first expedition to [[Lake Maracaibo]], which was bitterly opposed by the indigenous [[Coquivacoa]]. After winning a series of bloody battles, he founded the settlement on 8 September 1529. Ehinger named the settlement New Nuremberg ({{lang-de|Neu-N\u00fcrnberg}}) and the lake after the valiant [[cacique|chieftain]] Mara of the Coquivacoa, who had died in the fighting. The city was renamed Maracaibo after the Spanish took possession.<ref>[http://www.wasistwas.de/geschichte/alle-artikel/artikel/link//aafd6793cf/article/das-imperium-der-welser/-7c05c71e06.html Das Imperium der Welser] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422023929/http://www.wasistwas.de/geschichte/alle-artikel/artikel/link//aafd6793cf/article/das-imperium-der-welser/-7c05c71e06.html |date=2012-04-22 }}</ref> The lack of activity in the zone made [[Nikolaus Federmann]] evacuate the village in 1535 and move its population to [[Santa Marta]] near the then capital of [[Venezuela Province]], [[Santa Ana de Coro]].\n\nA second attempt by Captain [https://www.britannica.com/place/Maracaibo Alonso Pacheco] in 1569 suffered a brief setback when the city had to be evacuated in 1573 due to ferocious attacks by native local tribes. The European settlement returned a short while later, in 1574, however, for which it was re-founded by Captain Pedro Maldonado under Governor [[Diego de Mazariegos]]' command and assuming the name of Nueva Zamora de Maracaibo. \"Nueva Zamora\" comes from Mazariego's place of birth, Zamora, in Spain. Since its definite foundation, the town began to develop as a whole. It is based on the western side of [[Lake Maracaibo]], the dominant feature of the oil-rich [[Maracaibo Basin]]. Favored by prevailing winds and a protected harbour, the city is located on the shores of the lake where the narrows, which eventually lead to the [[Gulf of Venezuela]], first become pronounced.\n\n===Pirates' attacks===\nThe Dutch corsair [[Henrik de Gerard]] plundered Maracaibo in 1614, and in 1642 the city was attacked by the British pirate [[William Jackson (pirate)|William Jackson]]. In 1667, [[l'Olonnais]] with a fleet of eight ships and a crew of six hundred pirates sacked Maracaibo and Gibraltar. En route, l'Olonnais crossed paths with a Spanish treasure ship, which he captured, along with its rich cargo of [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], [[gemstone]]s and more than 260,000 [[pieces of eight]].\n\nIn March 1669, [[Henry Morgan]] sacked Maracaibo, which emptied when his fleet was first spied, and moved on to the Spanish settlement of Gibraltar on the inside of Lake Maracaibo in search of more treasure. A few weeks later, when he attempted to sail out of the lake, Morgan found an occupied fort blocking the inlet to the Caribbean, along with three Spanish ships. These were the ''Magdalena'', the ''San Luis'', and the ''Soledad''. He destroyed the Magdalena and burned the San Luis by sending a dummy ship full of gunpowder to explode near them, after which the crew of the ''Soledad'' surrendered. By faking a landward attack on the fort, thereby convincing the Spanish governor to shift his cannon, he eluded their guns and escaped.<ref>''Harry Morgan's Way'', (AlisonPress, 1977), Dudley Pope, {{ISBN|978-1842324820}}</ref><ref>''Caribbean'', James A.Michener, Guild Publishing, 1989, ASIN: B00EFKMICY</ref>\n\nIn June 1678, [[Michel de Grammont]] French commander of six ships and 700 men captured Maracaibo then followed the plundering of several smaller towns as [[Gibraltar, Venezuela|Gibraltar]], penetrating as far inland as [[Trujillo, Trujillo|Trujillo]].\n\n=== Venezuelan independence ===\n\nIn 1810, the province of Maracaibo did not join the [[First Republic of Venezuela]] and remained loyal to the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish crown]]. Maracaibo then held the seat of the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]].\n\nIn 1821, uprisings in favor of independence began to lead to warfare and hostility. The [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]], led by [[Francisco Tom\u00e1s Morales]], fought with the patriots, led by [[Rafael Urdaneta]], to take back control over the province in the Juana de \u00c1vila Battle, and Morales brought back Spanish rule in 1822 until he was defeated at the [[Battle of Lake Maracaibo]] on 24 July 1823, culminating Venezuela's struggle for independence.\n\n=== Isolation period ===\nFor about 390 years, Maracaibo remained isolated and separated from the rest of the country. Transportation was only possible across the lake by ferry or other marine transport.\n\nCars, buses, and lorries, with their constant flow of manufactured goods and agricultural product, depended on the ferry system between the city and the eastern shore with their roads to connect to the country's motorway system. Maracaibo and the Lake Maracaibo region's economy was more linked to [[Colombia]] than to eastern Venezuela due to the natural route available through Lake Maracaibo then leading to the sea.\n\nThis isolation was both a challenge and an advantage. The very nature of the city's location made for a population known for their independent thought and character. The history of this region is rife with stories about the creation of an independent and sovereign nation apart from Venezuela, a nation called ''La Rep\u00fablica Independiente del Zulia'', which means ''The Independent Republic of Zulia'', but this has never come to be.\n\nIn January 1903, as the naval blockade of Venezuela continued during the negotiations with presidente [[Cipriano Castro]], the German warship ''[[SMS Panther]]'' attempted to enter [[Lake Maracaibo]], which was a center of German commercial activity. On 17 January, it exchanged fire with the settlement of Fort San Carlos, but withdrew after half an hour, as shallow waters prevented it getting close enough to the fort to be effective. The Venezuelans claimed this as a victory, and in response the German commander sent the ''[[SMS Vineta]]'', with heavier weapons, to set an example. On 21 January, the ''SMS Vineta'' bombarded the fort, setting fire to it and destroying it, with the death of 25 civilians in the nearby town.\n\nIn 1908, the ''Friesland'', [[HNLMS Gelderland (1898)|Gelderland]] and [[HNLMS Jacob van Heemskerck (1906)|Jacob van Heemskerck]]\nwere sent to patrol the Venezuelan coast during the ''[[Cipriano Castro|second Castro crisis]]''. ''Friesland'' guarded the entry way to Maracaibo.<ref name=\"scheepvaartmuseum.nl :: Maritieme kalender 1908\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hetscheepvaartmuseum.nl/knowledgebase/calendar%7C1908|publisher=Hetscheepvaartmuseum.nl|title=Maritieme kalender 1908|accessdate=2013-07-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Building of the bridge ===\n[[File:Monumento a la Chinita I.JPG|thumbnail|300px|Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquir\u00e1]]\nThe dictatorial regime of General [[Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez]] in the 1950s set as a goal the construction of a bridge connecting the two lake shores. Various bridge projects for the spanning of the Lake Maracaibo narrows near the city were in the works. The general's government had decided that this \"city of independent thought\" should be more \"connected\" to the rest of the country.\n\nProposals for a bridge design that included rail transport and tourist facilities were seriously considered. The fall of the P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez government on 23 January 1958, quickly led to a less elaborate design project that was approved and funded by a democratic and more conservative government.\n\nThe building of \"El Puente Sobre El Lago de Maracaibo \"General Rafael Urdaneta\"\u2014([[General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge]] over Lake Maracaibo) named after the distinguished General [[Rafael Urdaneta|hero]] of the War of Independence was opened to public traffic in 1962. The project was completed on schedule in 40 months.\n\nThis bridge construction project was a remarkable feat. Built under very difficult conditions, when completed, it became the longest prestressed concrete bridge in the world. The structure is in constant use and remains today as the most important link between Maracaibo, along with much of the state of Zulia, and the rest of Venezuela.\n[[File:Maracaibo city skyline july 2007.jpg|thumb|center|1000px|Panoramic view of Maracaibo City.]]\n\n=== Modern times ===\nMaracaibo has become a large metropolitan city, comprising two municipalities: to the north the municipality of Maracaibo and to the south the San Francisco municipality (established in 1995). In recent years, due to political/economic and cultural reasons, many have moved to Maracaibo from rural areas and other cities (including [[Caracas]]).\n[[File:Ancient office Mene Grande Oil Company.jpg|thumb|right|Former headquarters of the Mene Grande Oil Company]]\nIn the political arena, the citizens of Maracaibo (and most other cities and municipalities in Zulia state) have in recent years voted for a competitive political system in where the governor is from a certain political party and the mayor or mayors are from the opposite political party.\n\nMaracaibo also boasts one of the best universities in the country, the state university. ''[[University of Zulia|La Universidad del Zulia]]'' (LUZ) is well renowned for its excellent law, medical and engineering schools as many other disciplines.

The following excerpts describe the local population of Maracaibo:\n\n:''They perform coasting, or long voyages, with equal facility; and when all trade is suspended by the operations of war, they enter privateers. Bred up in the neighbourhood of the lake, they are mostly all expert swimmers and excellent divers. Their reputation stands equally high as soldiers. Those who do not enter into the sea service, form plantations, or assist in cultivating those that belong to their fathers. Nothing proves better their aptitude for this kind of occupation, than the immense flocks of cattle with which the savannas of Maracaybo {{sic}} are covered.''\n\nHe also notes the appreciation of literature, the arts, education, and culture among the people of Maracaibo:\n\n:''But what confers the greatest honour on the inhabitants of Maracaibo, is their application to literature; in which, notwithstanding the wretched state of public education, they make considerable progress....They likewise acquired the art of elocution, and of writing their mother tongue with the greatest purity; in a word, they possessed all the qualities that characterise men of letters.''\n\n==Economy==\nZulia\u00b4s main income comes from oil extraction and refining, agriculture (coffee, rice, maize, cassava, cocoa, sugar cane),\nlivestock production, and mining (clay, limestone, coal and sand{{cn|date=March 2017}}).\n\n=== Medicine ===\n[[Huntington's disease]] prevalence worldwide is 5\u201310 cases per 100,000 persons.

Maracaibo, and the rest of Zulia, are represented in [[baseball]] by the [[\u00c1guilas del Zulia]], a Venezuelan winter league team that plays in the [[Liga Venezolana de B\u00e9isbol Profesional]], and is based in the [[Estadio Luis Aparicio El Grande]]. The city's [[basketball]] team is [[Gaiteros del Zulia]], which plays in the [[Liga Profesional de Baloncesto]] de Venezuela. Its home is the 5.000-people ''Pedro El\u00edas Belisario Aponte'' stadium. Other teams include the [[Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tico Maracaibo]] and the [[Zulia FC]] in [[Football (soccer)|football]], the [[Maracaibo Rugby Football Club]] and the [[Zulianos Rugby Club]].\n\nIn the [[2000 Little League World Series]], the Sierrra Maestra Little League of Maracaibo, Venezuela defeated Bellaire Little League of Bellaire, Texas in the championship game of the 54th Little League World Series. The Coquivocoa Little League team from Maracaibo placed third in the [[1974 Little League World Series]].\n\nRugby in Venezuela was first played in Maracaibo, thanks to the influence of the English community based on the [[Zulia State]]\n\nTeam:\n* Baseball: [[\u00c1guilas del Zulia]] BBC.\n* Basketball: [[Gaiteros del Zulia]]\n* Soccer: [[Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tico Maracaibo]], [[Zulia FC]]\n* Rugby: [[Maracaibo Rugby Football Club \"Oil Blacks\"]], [[Zulianos Rugby Club]]\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Calle Carabobo de Maracaibo.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Carabobo street contains much of the city's famous colonial architecture]]\n\nCulture in Maracaibo is very indigenous and unique, is recognized in every state and city in Venezuela, and is very influential with its [[Gaita (music style)|gaitas]], desserts, style, living, and customs. Most major houses of advertising in Venezuela acknowledge how opposite the culture of Maracaibo is from that of Caracas. Studies of both prove, for example, that Caracas' leading soft drink brand is [[Coca-Cola|Coke]], while in Maracaibo it is [[Pepsi]]. This has made many brands create special localized advertising of their products (including several Pepsi commercials spoken by local celebrities).\n\nMarabinos are extremely proud of their city, their culture, and all of Zulia. They usually claim that Venezuela wouldn't be the country it actually is without Zulia. Rivalry with inhabitants of other regions is common, specially with ''Gochos'' (people of the Trujillo, [[M\u00e9rida State|M\u00e9rida]] and T\u00e1chira state) and ''[[Caraque\u00f1o]]s'' (people of the city of [[Caracas]]).\n\nThe Gaita is a style of Venezuelan folk music from Maracaibo. According to [[Joan Corominas]], it may come from gaits, the Gothic word for \"goat\", which is the skin generally used for the membrane of the furro instrument. Other instruments used in gaita include maracas, cuatro, charrasca and tambora (Venezuelan drum). Song themes range from humorous and love songs to protest songs.The style became popular throughout Venezuela in the 1960s, and it fused with other styles such as salsa and merengue in the 1970s. Famous gaita groups include Maracaibo 15, Gran Coquivacoa, Barrio Obrero, Cardenales del \u00c9xito, Koquimba, Melody Gaita, Guaco, Estrellas del Zulia, Saladillo, and many others.\n[[File:Mural (Venezuela).JPG|thumb|1000px|center|Mural in the Libertador Avenue.]]\n\n=== Museums, cultural centers and theaters ===\n[[File:Tranv\u00eda de Maracaibo I.jpg|thumb|240px|Tram of Maracaibo.]]\n* Museo de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo del estado Zulia (MACZUL)\n* Museo [[General Rafael Urdaneta]]\n* Museo Municipal de Artes Gr\u00e1ficas \"Balmiro Le\u00f3n\"\n* Centro de Bellas Artes de Maracaibo\n* Centro de Arte de Maracaibo \"[[L\u00eda Berm\u00fadez]]\"\n* [[Baralt Theater|Teatro Baralt]]\n*Museo de la Gaita\n\n=== Libraries ===\n* [http://www.bibliotecapublicadelzulia.org.ve Biblioteca Publica del Zulia]\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica \"Arturo Uslar Pietri\"\n* Biblioteca \"Dr. Pedro Alciro Barboza de la Torre\"\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica \"Sim\u00f3n Palmar\"\n* [http://www.cevaz.org Biblioteca P\u00fablica \"Lu\u00eds Guillermo Pineda Belloso\" (De car\u00e1cter p\u00fablico, biling\u00fce y circulante)]\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica Especializada \"Pedag\u00f3gica\"\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica Especializada \"SEDINI\"\n*Biblioteca Privada \"Dr. Nectario Andrade Labarca\"\n\n== Notable natives ==\n{{Cleanup|section|date=November 2010}}\n* [[Betty Cecilia Lugo]] - Philanthropist\n* [[Teolindo Acosta]] - baseball player\n* [[Guaco|Gustavo Aguado]] - musician, singer and leader of Guaco, Venezuela's most influential music band\n* [[Ricardo Aguirre]] - composer and singer\n* [[Daniel Alvarado]] - singer and actor\n* [[Wilson \u00c1lvarez]] - Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher\n* [[Ernesto Aparicio (baseball)|Ernesto Aparicio]] - Major League Baseball baseball player, manager, and team owner\n* [[Luis Aparicio]] - former shortstop in Major League Baseball and member of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]\n*[[:es:Pedro Aranguren|Pedro Aranguren]]- militar\n* [[Eduardo Arcila Far\u00edas]] - journalist and historian\n* [[Rafael Maria Baralt]] - diplomat, writer, philologist, historian, first Latin American to occupy a chair at the 'Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola'\n* [[Huascar Barradas]] - flutist\n*[[Rafael Belloso Chac\u00edn]] - physician\n* [[:es:Luis Barrera Linares|Luis Barrera Linares]] - writer, academic, teacher of [[Universidad Simon Bolivar]]\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Bracho]] - baseball pitcher\n* [[Antonio Bri\u00f1ez]] - first manager to win a National Amateur Baseball championship to Venezuela\n* [[Mar\u00eda Calca\u00f1o]] - poet\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Casanova]] - baseball player and manager of the Venezuelan team that won the gold medal in 1959 Panamerican Games\n* [[Abel Castellano Jr.]] - jockey\n* [[Javier Castellano]]- jockey [[Eclipse Award]] 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016.

Opened in 1974, it originally featured [[J. C. Penney]] and [[Sears]] as its major [[anchor store]]s, the latter taking the place of a [[Britt's]] discount store which never opened for business. A 1980 expansion added a new wing with a [[Meis (department store)|Meis]] department store, which was sold to [[Elder-Beerman]] in 1989, while Sears relocated to [[Illinois Star Centre|Illinois Centre Mall]] and was replaced by [[Montgomery Ward]]. Further expansion in 1991 added several new tenants, along with a [[food court]] and the anchor stores [[Famous-Barr]] and [[Venture Stores]]. The latter closed in 1993 and was converted to [[K's Merchandise Mart]]; Elder-Beerman and Montgomery Ward also closed in the 1990s, with the former undergoing conversion to offices and the latter being subdivided for a theater and smaller stores. Famous-Barr converted to [[Macy's]] in 2006, and K's Merchandise Mart closed in 2007. The mall has seen several closures in stores throughout the 21st century; remaining mall tenants include J. C. Penney, Macy's (closing in March 2020), [[Shoe Show|Shoe Dept. Encore]], [[Ross Dress for Less]], [[Old Navy]], and [[Bed Bath & Beyond]]. University Mall is managed by Namdar Realty.\n\n==History==\nThe first store to open at University Mall was a brand new [[JCPenney]] department store, which opened in 1971. The same year, real estate developers David E. Hocker and Alan Squitieri, both of [[Owensboro, Kentucky]], announced plans to build a mall extending easterly from the J. C. Penney store. Under their plans, the other original anchor stores would be [[Britt's]] (a discount department store owned by [[J. J.
