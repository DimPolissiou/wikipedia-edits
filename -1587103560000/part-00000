In one, Midas was king of [[Pessinus]], a city of [[Phrygia]], who as a child was adopted by King [[Gordias]] and [[Cybele]], the [[goddess]] whose consort he was, and who (by some accounts) was the goddess-mother of Midas himself.<ref>\"King Midas, a Phrygian, son of Cybele\" ([[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 274).</ref> Some accounts place the youth of Midas in [[Macedon]]ian Bermion (See [[Bryges]]).<ref>\"Bromium\" in Graves 1960:83.a; Greek traditions of the migration from Macedon to Anatolia are examined\u2014 as purely literary constructions\u2014 in Peter Carrington, \"The Heroic Age of Phrygia in Ancient Literature and Art\" ''Anatolian Studies'' '''27''' (1977:117-126).</ref> In [[Thrace|Thracian]] [[Mygdonia (Europe)|Mygdonia]],<ref>Mygdonia became part of [[Macedon]] in historical times.</ref> [[Herodotus]] referred to a wild rose garden at the foot of Mount Bermion as \"the garden of Midas son of Gordias, where roses grow of themselves, each bearing sixty blossoms and of surpassing fragrance\".<ref>Herodotus, ''Histories'' 8.138.1</ref> Herodotus says elsewhere that Phrygians anciently lived in Europe where they were known as [[Bryges]],<ref>Herodotus 7.73</ref> and the existence of the garden implies that Herodotus believed that Midas lived prior to a Phrygian migration to Anatolia.\n\nAccording to some accounts, Midas had a son, [[Lityerses]], the demonic reaper of men, but in some variations of the myth he instead had a daughter, Zo\u00eb or \"life\". According to other accounts he had a son named [[Anchurus]].\n\n[[Arrian]] gives an alternative story of the descent and life of Midas. According to him, Midas was the son of Gordios, a poor peasant, and a [[Telmissus|Telmissian]] maiden of the prophetic race. When Midas grew up to be a handsome and valiant man, the Phrygians were harassed by civil discord, and consulting the oracle, they were told that a wagon would bring them a king, who would put an end to their discord. While they were still deliberating, Midas arrived with his father and mother, and stopped near the assembly, wagon and all. They, comparing the oracular response with this occurrence, decided that this was the person whom the god told them the wagon would bring. They therefore appointed Midas king and he, putting an end to their discord, dedicated his father\u2019s wagon in the citadel as a thank-offering to Zeus the king. In addition to this the following saying was current concerning the wagon, that whosoever could loosen the cord of the yoke of this wagon, was destined to gain the rule of Asia. This someone was to be [[Alexander the Great]].<ref>Arrian, Alexandri Anabasis, B.3.4-6</ref> In other versions of the legend, it was Midas' father [[Gordias]] who arrived humbly in the cart and made the [[Gordian Knot]].\n\nHerodotus said that a \"Midas son of Gordias\" made an offering to the [[Oracle of Delphi]] of a royal throne \"from which he made judgments\" that were \"well worth seeing\", and that this Midas was the only foreigner to make an offering to Delphi before [[Gyges of Lydia]].<ref>Herodotus I.14.</ref> The historical Midas of the 8th century BC and Gyges are believed to have been contemporaries, so it seems most likely that Herodotus believed that the throne was donated by the earlier, legendary King Midas. However, some historians believe that this throne was donated by the later, historical King Midas.<ref>See for example Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, notes to Penguin edition of Herodotus.</ref>\n\n== Myths ==\n=== Golden Touch ===\n\nOne day, as [[Ovid]] relates in ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' XI,<ref>[http://www.theoi.com/Text/OvidMetamorphoses11.html On-line text at Theoi.com]</ref> [[Dionysus]] found that his old schoolmaster and foster father, the [[satyr]] [[Silenus]], was missing.<ref>This myth appears in a fragment of [[Aristotle]], ''Eudemus'', (fr.6); [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was aware that Midas mixed water with wine to capture Silenus (''Description of Greece'' 1.4.1); a muddled version is recounted in [[Flavius Philostratus]]' ''Life of Apollonius of Tyana'', vi.27: \"Midas himself had some of the blood of [[satyr]]s in his veins, as was clear from the shape of his ears; and a satyr once, trespassing on his kinship with Midas, made merry at the expense of his ears, not only singing about them, but piping about them. Well, Midas, I understand, had heard from his mother that when a satyr is overcome by wine he falls asleep, and at such times comes to his senses and will make friends with you; so he mixed wine which he had in his palace in a fountain and let the satyr get at it, and the latter drank it up and was overcome\".</ref> The old satyr had been drinking wine and wandered away drunk, to be found by some Phrygian [[peasant]]s who carried him to their king, Midas (alternatively, Silenus passed out in Midas' rose garden). Midas recognized him and treated him hospitably, entertaining him for ten days and nights with politeness, while Silenus delighted Midas and his friends with stories and songs.<ref>[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''Varia Historia'' iii.18 relates some of Silenus' accounts (Graves 1960:83.b.3).</ref> On the eleventh day, he brought Silenus back to Dionysus in [[Lydia]]. Dionysus offered Midas his choice of whatever reward he wished for. Midas asked that whatever he might touch should be changed into [[gold]].\n\nMidas rejoiced in his new power, which he hastened to put to the test. He touched an oak twig and a stone; both turned to gold. Overjoyed, as soon as he got home, he touched every rose in the rose garden, and all became gold. He ordered the servants to set a feast on the table. Upon discovering how even the food and drink turned into gold in his hands, he regretted his wish and cursed it. [[Claudian]] states in his ''In Rufinum'': \"So Midas, king of Lydia, swelled at first with pride when he found he could transform everything he touched to gold; but when he beheld his food grow rigid and his drink harden into golden ice then he understood that this gift was a bane and in his loathing for gold, cursed his prayer.\"<ref>Claudian, ''In Rufinum'': \"sic rex ad prima tumebat Maeonius, pulchro cum verteret omnia tactu;\nsed postquam riguisse dapes fulvamque revinctos in glaciem vidit latices, tum munus acerbum sensit et inviso votum damnavit in auro.\"</ref>\n\nIn a version told by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] in ''[[A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys]]'' (1852), Midas' daughter came to him, upset about the roses that had lost their fragrance and become hard, and when he reached out to comfort her, found that when he touched his daughter, she turned to gold as well. Now, Midas hated the gift he had coveted. He prayed to Dionysus, begging to be delivered from starvation. Dionysus heard his prayer, and consented; telling Midas to wash in the river [[Pactolus]]. Then, whatever he put into the water would be reversed of the touch.\n\nMidas did so, and when he touched the waters, the power flowed into the river, and the river sands turned into gold. This explained why the river Pactolus was so rich in gold and [[electrum]], and the wealth of the dynasty of [[Alyattes of Lydia]] claiming Midas as its forefather no doubt the impetus for this [[origin myth]]. Gold was perhaps not the only metallic source of Midas' riches: \"King Midas, a Phrygian, son of [[Cybele]], first discovered black and white lead\".<ref>[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' 274</ref>\n\n=== Ears of a Donkey ===\nMidas, now hating wealth and splendor, moved to the country and became a worshipper of [[Pan (god)|Pan]], the god of the fields and satyrs.<ref>This myth puts Midas in another setting. \"Midas himself had some of the blood of satyrs in his veins, as was clear from the shape of his ears\" was the assertion of [[Flavius Philostratus]], in his ''Life of [[Apollonius of Tyana]]'' (vi.27), not always a dependable repository of myth. ([https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_6_26.html on-line])</ref> Roman mythographers<ref>[[Cicero]] ''On Divination''i.36; [[Valerius Maximus]], i.6.3; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]], xi.92f.</ref> asserted that his tutor in music was [[Orpheus]].\n[[File:Gordion82.JPG|thumb|left|The \"Tomb of Midas\" in [[Gordion]], dated 740 BC.]]\nOnce, Pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of [[Apollo]], and challenged Apollo to a trial of skill (also see [[Marsyas]]). [[Tmolus]], the mountain-god, was chosen as umpire. Pan blew on his pipes and, with his rustic melody, gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, Midas, who happened to be present. Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and all but one agreed with the judgment. Midas dissented, and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and said \"Must have ears of an ass!\", which caused Midas's ears to become those of a [[donkey]].<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 191.</ref> The myth is illustrated by two paintings, ''\"[[Apollo and Marsyas]]\"'' by [[Palma il Giovane]] (1544\u20131628), one depicting the scene before, and one after, the punishment. Midas was mortified at this mishap. He attempted to hide his misfortune under an ample turban or headdress, but his [[barber]] of course knew the secret, so was told not to mention it. However, the barber could not keep the secret. He went out into the meadow, dug a hole in the ground, whispered the story into it, then covered the hole up. A thick bed of reeds later sprang up in the meadow, and began whispering the story, saying \"King Midas has an ass' ears\".<ref>The whispering sound of reeds is an ancient [[literary trope]]: the Sumerian ''Instructions of Shuruppak'' (3rd millennium BCE) warn \"The reed-beds are ..., they can hide (?) slander\". ([http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section5/tr561.htm ''Instructions of Shuruppak'', lines 92-93]).</ref> Some sources said that Midas killed himself by drinking the blood of an [[ox]].\n[[File:Abraham Janssens - The judgement of Midas.jpg|thumb|280px|''The judgement of Midas'' by [[Abraham Janssens]]]]\nSarah Morris demonstrated (Morris, 2004) that donkeys' ears were a Bronze Age royal attribute, borne by King Tarkasnawa (Greek Tarkondemos) of [[Arzawa|Mira]], on a seal inscribed in both [[Hittite language|Hittite]] cuneiform and [[Luwian]] hieroglyphs. In this connection, the myth would appear for Greeks to justify the exotic attribute.\n\nThe stories of the contests with Apollo of Pan and Marsyas were very often confused, so [[Titian]]'s ''[[Flaying of Marsyas (Titian)|Flaying of Marsyas]]'' includes a figure of Midas (who may be a self-portrait), though his ears seem normal.<ref>Hall, James, ''Hall's Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art'', pp. 27-28, 1996 (2nd edn.), John Murray, {{ISBN|0719541476}}</ref>\n\n==== Similar myths in other cultures ====\nIn pre-Islamic legend of Central Asia, the king of the [[Ossounes]] of the [[Yenisei]] basin had [[donkey's ears]]. He would hide them, and order each of his barbers murdered to hide his secret. The last barber among his people was counselled to whisper the heavy secret into a well after sundown, but he didn't cover the well afterwards. The well water rose and flooded the kingdom, creating the waters of [[Lake Issyk-Kul]].<ref>The legend is related in [[Ella Maillart]], [[Dervla Murphy]], ''Turkestan solo: a journey through Central Asia'' (1938) 2005:48f; a wholly separate origin uncontaminated by the legend of Midas is not likely.</ref>\n\nAccording to an Irish legend, the king [[Labraid Loingsech]] had horse's ears, something he was concerned to keep quiet. He had his hair cut once a year, and the barber, who was chosen by lot, was immediately put to death. A widow, hearing that her only son had been chosen to cut the king's hair, begged the king not to kill him, and he agreed, so long as the barber kept his secret. The burden of the secret was so heavy that the barber fell ill. A [[druid]] advised him to go to a crossroads and tell his secret to the first tree he came to, and he would be relieved of his burden and be well again. He told the secret to a large [[willow]]. Soon after this, however, a harper named Craiftine broke his instrument, and made a new one out of the very willow the barber had told his secret to. Whenever he played it, the harp sang \"Labraid Lorc has horse's ears\". Labraid repented of all the barbers he had put to death and admitted his secret.<ref>[[Geoffrey Keating]], ''Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text039.html 1.29]-[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text040.html 1.30]</ref>\n\nIn Ireland, at Loch Ine, West Cork, there is a similar story told of the inhabitant of its island, who had ass's ears. Anyone engaged to cut this King's hair was then put to death. But the reeds (in the form of a musical flute) spoke of them and the secret was out.\n\n==Historicity==\nThe King Midas who ruled Phrygia in the late 8th century BC is known from Greek and Assyrian sources. According to the former, he married a Greek princess, [[Hermodike II (Demodike II, Hermodice II, Damodice II)|Damodice]] daughter of [[Agamemnon]] of [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Cyme]], and traded extensively with the Greeks. Damodice is credited with inventing coined money by [[Julius Pollux]] after she married Midas.<ref>The Mycenaean Origin of Greek Mythology, Martin Persson Nilsson, University of California Press, 1972, pg48</ref> Some historians believe this Midas donated the throne that [[Herodotus]] says was offered to the [[Oracle of Delphi]] by \"Midas son of Gordias\" (see above). Assyrian tablets from the reign of [[Sargon II]] record attacks by a \"Mita\", king of the [[Mushki]], against Assyria's eastern Anatolian provinces. Some historians believe Assyrian texts called this Midas king of the \"Mushki\" because he had subjected the eastern Anatolian people of that name and incorporated them into his army. Greek sources including [[Strabo]]<ref>[[Strabo]] I.3.21.</ref> say that Midas committed suicide by drinking [[bull's blood]] during an attack by the Cimmerians, which [[Eusebius]] dated to around 695 BC and [[Julius Africanus]] to around 676 BC. Archeology has confirmed that [[Gordium]] was destroyed and burned around that time.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.</ref>\n\n==Possible tomb==\n[[Image:Museum of Anatolian Civilizations055 kopie1.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Reconstruction of the Tumulus MM burial, [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]], Ankara, Turkey.]]\n\nIn 1957, [[Rodney Young (archaeologist)|Rodney Young]] and a team from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] opened a chamber tomb at the heart of the Great Tumulus (in Greek, \u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1)\u201453&nbsp;metres in height, about 300&nbsp;metres in diameter\u2014on the site of ancient [[Gordium|Gordion]] (modern [[Yass\u0131h\u00fcy\u00fck, Polatl\u0131|Yass\u0131h\u00fcy\u00fck]], Turkey), where there are more than 100 [[tumulus|tumuli]] of different sizes and from different periods.<ref>Rodney Young, ''Three Great Early Tumuli: The Gordion Excavations Final Reports, Volume 1,'' (1981):79-102.</ref> They discovered a royal burial, its timbers dated as cut to about 740 BC<ref>{{cite book |first=Keith |last=DeVries |chapter=Greek Pottery and Gordion Chronology |editor-first=Lisa |editor-last=Kealhofer |title=The Archaeology of Midas and the Phrygians: Recent Work at Gordion |year=2005 |pages=42ff. |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology |isbn=1-931707-76-6 }} {{cite journal |first=Sturt |last=Manning |title=Anatolian Tree Rings and a New Chronology for the East Mediterranean Bronze-Iron Ages |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=294 |issue=5551 |year=2001 |pages=2532\u20132535 [p. 2534] |doi=10.1126/science.1066112 |pmid=11743159|display-authors=etal}}</ref> complete with remains of the funeral feast and \"the best collection of Iron Age drinking vessels ever uncovered\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/1026/title/King_Midas_Modern_Mourners |work=Science News |title=King Midas' modern mourners |date=November 4, 2000 }}</ref> This inner chamber was rather large: 5.15&nbsp;metres by 6.2&nbsp;metres in breadth and 3.25&nbsp;metres high.

However, some historians believe that this throne was donated by the later, historical King Midas.<ref>See for example Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, notes to Penguin edition of Herodotus.</ref>\n\n== Myths ==\n=== Golden Touch ===\n\nOne day, as [[Ovid]] relates in ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' XI,<ref>[http://www.theoi.com/Text/OvidMetamorphoses11.html On-line text at Theoi.com]</ref> [[Dionysus]] found that his old schoolmaster and foster father, the [[satyr]] [[Silenus]], was missing.<ref>This myth appears in a fragment of [[Aristotle]], ''Eudemus'', (fr.6); [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was aware that Midas mixed water with wine to capture Silenus (''Description of Greece'' 1.4.1); a muddled version is recounted in [[Flavius Philostratus]]' ''Life of Apollonius of Tyana'', vi.27: \"Midas himself had some of the blood of [[satyr]]s in his veins, as was clear from the shape of his ears; and a satyr once, trespassing on his kinship with Midas, made merry at the expense of his ears, not only singing about them, but piping about them. Well, Midas, I understand, had heard from his mother that when a satyr is overcome by wine he falls asleep, and at such times comes to his senses and will make friends with you; so he mixed wine which he had in his palace in a fountain and let the satyr get at it, and the latter drank it up and was overcome\".</ref> The old satyr had been drinking wine and wandered away drunk, to be found by some Phrygian [[peasant]]s who carried him to their king, Midas (alternatively, Silenus passed out in Midas' rose garden). Midas recognized him and treated him hospitably, entertaining him for ten days and nights with politeness, while Silenus delighted Midas and his friends with stories and songs.<ref>[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''Varia Historia'' iii.18 relates some of Silenus' accounts (Graves 1960:83.b.3).</ref> On the eleventh day, he brought Silenus back to Dionysus in [[Lydia]]. Dionysus offered Midas his choice of whatever reward he wished for. Midas asked that whatever he might touch should be changed into [[gold]].\n\nMidas rejoiced in his new power, which he hastened to put to the test. He touched an oak twig and a stone; both turned to gold. Overjoyed, as soon as he got home, he touched every rose in the rose garden, and all became gold. He ordered the servants to set a feast on the table. Upon discovering how even the food and drink turned into gold in his hands, he regretted his wish and cursed it. [[Claudian]] states in his ''In Rufinum'': \"So Midas, king of Lydia, swelled at first with pride when he found he could transform everything he touched to gold; but when he beheld his food grow rigid and his drink harden into golden ice then he understood that this gift was a bane and in his loathing for gold, cursed his prayer.\"<ref>Claudian, ''In Rufinum'': \"sic rex ad prima tumebat Maeonius, pulchro cum verteret omnia tactu;\nsed postquam riguisse dapes fulvamque revinctos in glaciem vidit latices, tum munus acerbum sensit et inviso votum damnavit in auro.\"</ref>\n\nIn a version told by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] in ''[[A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys]]'' (1852), Midas' daughter came to him, upset about the roses that had lost their fragrance and become hard, and when he reached out to comfort her, found that when he touched his daughter, she turned to gold as well. Now, Midas hated the gift he had coveted. He prayed to Dionysus, begging to be delivered from starvation. Dionysus heard his prayer, and consented; telling Midas to wash in the river [[Pactolus]]. Then, whatever he put into the water would be reversed of the touch.\n\nMidas did so, and when he touched the waters, the power flowed into the river, and the river sands turned into gold. This explained why the river Pactolus was so rich in gold and [[electrum]], and the wealth of the dynasty of [[Alyattes of Lydia]] claiming Midas as its forefather no doubt the impetus for this [[origin myth]]. Gold was perhaps not the only metallic source of Midas' riches: \"King Midas, a Phrygian, son of [[Cybele]], first discovered black and white lead\".<ref>[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' 274</ref>\n\n=== Ears of a Donkey ===\nMidas, now hating wealth and splendor, moved to the country and became a worshipper of [[Pan (god)|Pan]], the god of the fields and satyrs.<ref>This myth puts Midas in another setting. \"Midas himself had some of the blood of satyrs in his veins, as was clear from the shape of his ears\" was the assertion of [[Flavius Philostratus]], in his ''Life of [[Apollonius of Tyana]]'' (vi.27), not always a dependable repository of myth. ([https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_6_26.html on-line])</ref> Roman mythographers<ref>[[Cicero]] ''On Divination''i.36; [[Valerius Maximus]], i.6.3; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]], xi.92f.</ref> asserted that his tutor in music was [[Orpheus]].\n[[File:Gordion82.JPG|thumb|left|The \"Tomb of Midas\" in [[Gordion]], dated 740 BC.]]\nOnce, Pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of [[Apollo]], and challenged Apollo to a trial of skill (also see [[Marsyas]]). [[Tmolus]], the mountain-god, was chosen as umpire. Pan blew on his pipes and, with his rustic melody, gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, Midas, who happened to be present. Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and all but one agreed with the judgment. Midas dissented, and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and said \"Must have ears of an ass!\", which caused Midas's ears to become those of a [[donkey]].<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 191.</ref> The myth is illustrated by two paintings, ''\"[[Apollo and Marsyas]]\"'' by [[Palma il Giovane]] (1544\u20131628), one depicting the scene before, and one after, the punishment. Midas was mortified at this mishap. He attempted to hide his misfortune under an ample turban or headdress, but his [[barber]] of course knew the secret, so was told not to mention it. However, the barber could not keep the secret. He went out into the meadow, dug a hole in the ground, whispered the story into it, then covered the hole up. A thick bed of reeds later sprang up in the meadow, and began whispering the story, saying \"King Midas has an ass' ears\".<ref>The whispering sound of reeds is an ancient [[literary trope]]: the Sumerian ''Instructions of Shuruppak'' (3rd millennium BCE) warn \"The reed-beds are ..., they can hide (?) slander\". ([http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section5/tr561.htm ''Instructions of Shuruppak'', lines 92-93]).</ref> Some sources said that Midas killed himself by drinking the blood of an [[ox]].\n[[File:Abraham Janssens - The judgement of Midas.jpg|thumb|280px|''The judgement of Midas'' by [[Abraham Janssens]]]]\nSarah Morris demonstrated (Morris, 2004) that donkeys' ears were a Bronze Age royal attribute, borne by King Tarkasnawa (Greek Tarkondemos) of [[Arzawa|Mira]], on a seal inscribed in both [[Hittite language|Hittite]] cuneiform and [[Luwian]] hieroglyphs. In this connection, the myth would appear for Greeks to justify the exotic attribute.\n\nThe stories of the contests with Apollo of Pan and Marsyas were very often confused, so [[Titian]]'s ''[[Flaying of Marsyas (Titian)|Flaying of Marsyas]]'' includes a figure of Midas (who may be a self-portrait), though his ears seem normal.<ref>Hall, James, ''Hall's Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art'', pp. 27-28, 1996 (2nd edn.), John Murray, {{ISBN|0719541476}}</ref>\n\n==== Similar myths in other cultures ====\nIn pre-Islamic legend of Central Asia, the king of the [[Ossounes]] of the [[Yenisei]] basin had [[donkey's ears]]. He would hide them, and order each of his barbers murdered to hide his secret. The last barber among his people was counselled to whisper the heavy secret into a well after sundown, but he didn't cover the well afterwards. The well water rose and flooded the kingdom, creating the waters of [[Lake Issyk-Kul]].<ref>The legend is related in [[Ella Maillart]], [[Dervla Murphy]], ''Turkestan solo: a journey through Central Asia'' (1938) 2005:48f; a wholly separate origin uncontaminated by the legend of Midas is not likely.</ref>\n\nAccording to an Irish legend, the king [[Labraid Loingsech]] had horse's ears, something he was concerned to keep quiet. He had his hair cut once a year, and the barber, who was chosen by lot, was immediately put to death. A widow, hearing that her only son had been chosen to cut the king's hair, begged the king not to kill him, and he agreed, so long as the barber kept his secret. The burden of the secret was so heavy that the barber fell ill. A [[druid]] advised him to go to a crossroads and tell his secret to the first tree he came to, and he would be relieved of his burden and be well again. He told the secret to a large [[willow]]. Soon after this, however, a harper named Craiftine broke his instrument, and made a new one out of the very willow the barber had told his secret to. Whenever he played it, the harp sang \"Labraid Lorc has horse's ears\". Labraid repented of all the barbers he had put to death and admitted his secret.<ref>[[Geoffrey Keating]], ''Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text039.html 1.29]-[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text040.html 1.30]</ref>\n\nIn Ireland, at Loch Ine, West Cork, there is a similar story told of the inhabitant of its island, who had ass's ears. Anyone engaged to cut this King's hair was then put to death. But the reeds (in the form of a musical flute) spoke of them and the secret was out.\n\n==Historicity==\nThe King Midas who ruled Phrygia in the late 8th century BC is known from Greek and Assyrian sources. According to the former, he married a Greek princess, [[Hermodike II (Demodike II, Hermodice II, Damodice II)|Damodice]] daughter of [[Agamemnon]] of [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Cyme]], and traded extensively with the Greeks. Damodice is credited with inventing coined money by [[Julius Pollux]] after she married Midas.<ref>The Mycenaean Origin of Greek Mythology, Martin Persson Nilsson, University of California Press, 1972, pg48</ref> Some historians believe this Midas donated the throne that [[Herodotus]] says was offered to the [[Oracle of Delphi]] by \"Midas son of Gordias\" (see above). Assyrian tablets from the reign of [[Sargon II]] record attacks by a \"Mita\", king of the [[Mushki]], against Assyria's eastern Anatolian provinces. Some historians believe Assyrian texts called this Midas king of the \"Mushki\" because he had subjected the eastern Anatolian people of that name and incorporated them into his army. Greek sources including [[Strabo]]<ref>[[Strabo]] I.3.21.</ref> say that Midas committed suicide by drinking [[bull's blood]] during an attack by the Cimmerians, which [[Eusebius]] dated to around 695 BC and [[Julius Africanus]] to around 676 BC. Archeology has confirmed that [[Gordium]] was destroyed and burned around that time.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.</ref>\n\n==Possible tomb==\n[[Image:Museum of Anatolian Civilizations055 kopie1.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Reconstruction of the Tumulus MM burial, [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]], Ankara, Turkey.]]\n\nIn 1957, [[Rodney Young (archaeologist)|Rodney Young]] and a team from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] opened a chamber tomb at the heart of the Great Tumulus (in Greek, \u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1)\u201453&nbsp;metres in height, about 300&nbsp;metres in diameter\u2014on the site of ancient [[Gordium|Gordion]] (modern [[Yass\u0131h\u00fcy\u00fck, Polatl\u0131|Yass\u0131h\u00fcy\u00fck]], Turkey), where there are more than 100 [[tumulus|tumuli]] of different sizes and from different periods.<ref>Rodney Young, ''Three Great Early Tumuli: The Gordion Excavations Final Reports, Volume 1,'' (1981):79-102.</ref> They discovered a royal burial, its timbers dated as cut to about 740 BC<ref>{{cite book |first=Keith |last=DeVries |chapter=Greek Pottery and Gordion Chronology |editor-first=Lisa |editor-last=Kealhofer |title=The Archaeology of Midas and the Phrygians: Recent Work at Gordion |year=2005 |pages=42ff. |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology |isbn=1-931707-76-6 }} {{cite journal |first=Sturt |last=Manning |title=Anatolian Tree Rings and a New Chronology for the East Mediterranean Bronze-Iron Ages |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=294 |issue=5551 |year=2001 |pages=2532\u20132535 [p. 2534] |doi=10.1126/science.1066112 |pmid=11743159|display-authors=etal}}</ref> complete with remains of the funeral feast and \"the best collection of Iron Age drinking vessels ever uncovered\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/1026/title/King_Midas_Modern_Mourners |work=Science News |title=King Midas' modern mourners |date=November 4, 2000 }}</ref> This inner chamber was rather large: 5.15&nbsp;metres by 6.2&nbsp;metres in breadth and 3.25&nbsp;metres high.

The main office and academic facilities are located in Maribor. The academic programmes also take place in Ljubljana and Murska Sobota.<br />\nSome of the academic programmes mostly enroll students from Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia. The lectures, seminars and exams take place in Zagreb, Croatia.<br />\nAMEU also has its affiliates in Salzburg, Austria.\n\n=== Buildings ===\nAlma Mater Europaea has its headquarters in Slovenska Ulica 17, Maribor, Slovenia. Prior to July 2015 the headquarters were on Gosposka Ulica 1. The headquarters consist of several floors containing administration offices and several classrooms with capacities ranging from 20 to 150 students. The building is equipped with state of the art electronic equipment such as laptops, projectors, tablet computers, medical equipment for health care and physiotherapy programmes such as massage beds, inflatable balls, skeleton models etc.\n\n== Career center ==\n\nAlma Mater Europaea has a career center, which assists students with their employment.

Recognizing that students get most of their information from the internet, AMEU wanted to adapt their teaching methods to an increasingly digital world, to help students better prepare for real life. By incorporating digital literacy standards into the curriculum, the goal was to create a teaching environment using the same technology that students were already using outside school. Because it was important to move away from traditional textbooks, AMEU chose the iPad as a learning tool because it gives students access to the world as it is today. Giving students access to iPad also allows teachers to better adapt to their students\u2019 unique needs and abilities. Students are no longer limited to writing essays and answering multiple-choice questions in order to demonstrate what they have learned.\n\n=== Athletics ===\nAMEU provides students with opportunities to participate in sporting events and has therefore formed several teams to compete in sports.
