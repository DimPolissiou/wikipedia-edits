It consists of [[Vast Aire]] and [[Vordul Mega]], often accompanied by DJ Cip-One.\n\n==History==\nIn 2001, Cannibal Ox released their first album ''[[The Cold Vein]]'' on [[Definitive Jux]], which was the label's first full-length studio album. ''The Cold Vein'' received positive reviews from critics and put the duo in the underground hip hop spotlight, and has since been described as one of the best rap albums of the 2000s.<ref>[http://www.stylusmagazine.com/feature.php?ID=1430 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113165219/http://www.stylusmagazine.com/feature.php?ID=1430 |date=November 13, 2013 }}</ref><ref>[http://blog.rhapsody.com/2009/10/hiphopdecade.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924071122/http://blog.rhapsody.com/2009/10/hiphopdecade.html |date=September 24, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the group was rumored to have disbanded. However, fellow Definitive Jux rapper [[Murs (rapper)|Murs]] said \"Can Ox is not broken up, it's just a rumor\" between tracks on fellow Definitive Jux rapper [[Aesop Rock]]'s album ''[[Bazooka Tooth]]''.\n\nNovember 2005 brought the release of the live album ''[[Return of the Ox: Live at CMJ]]'' with a statement in the liner notes hinting at a Cannibal Ox LP to be released summer of 2006. Supposedly, [[RZA]], [[Pete Rock]] and [[El-P]] were set to contribute. However, the alleged album was never released.\n\nIn March 2007, El-P answered \"I really doubt it\" when asked if a new Cannibal Ox album was coming out anytime in the near future.<ref name=rwd2>[http://www.canibringmygat.com/2007/03/14/an-interview-with-el-p/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930181901/http://www.canibringmygat.com/2007/03/14/an-interview-with-el-p/ |date=September 30, 2011 }}</ref>\nThat same year, Vast Aire confirmed that he was no longer working with Definitive Jux, that he left [[The Weathermen (hip hop group)|The Weathermen]], and that plans for a new Cannibal Ox LP were scrapped.

He is well known for his historical novels in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], especially his trilogy ''Patan-ni-Prabhuta'' (The Greatness of Patan), ''Gujarat-no-Nath'' (The Ruler of Gujarat) and ''Rajadhiraj'' (The Emperor). His other works include ''Jay Somnath'' (on [[Somnath]] temple), ''[[Krishnavatara]]'' (on Lord [[Krishna]]), ''Bhagavan Parasurama'' (on [[Parshurama]]), and ''Tapasvini'' (The Lure of Power) a novel with a fictional parallel drawn from the Freedom Movement of India under [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Munshi also wrote several notable works in English.\n\nMunshi has written mostly based on fictional historical themes namely\n\n# Earlier Aryan settlements in India (What he calls Gaurang's \u2013 white skinned)\n# Krishna's endeavors in Mahabharata times\n# More recently in 10th century India around Gujarat, Malwa and Southern India.\n\nK.M. Munshi's novel ''[[Prithivivallabh]]'' was made into a movie of the same name twice. The adaptation directed by Manilal Joshi in 1924 was very controversial in its day: [[Mahatma Gandhi]] criticised it for excessive sex and violence. [[Prithvi Vallabh|The second version]] was by [[Sohrab Modi]] in 1943.\n\n===Works in Gujarati and Hindi===\nHis works are as following:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite news|title=Source: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai}}</ref><ref name=kh>[https://openlibrary.org/search?author_key=OL4167A&language=hin Open Library \u2013 Books of Kanhiyalal Munshi].

Most tourists focus their trip in [[Yerevan]], the capital, where the majority of travel agencies, attractions and hotels are located.\n\nOutdoor activities, sightseeing and nature tourism seem to be the primary attractions. [[Tsaghkadzor]], [[Jermuk]], [[Dilijan]] are known as mountainous resorts, which are outside of the capital. Tourists stay at the hotels of those towns in order to engage in extended trips over all Armenia without returning to Yerevan every day. The classical sightseeing trips to Armenia are popular not only among tourists, but also with the local population. [[Mountaineering]], [[camping]], [[hiking]] and other kinds of outdoor activities are also common.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Since 2015 ===\nIn February 2020, the [[UN]]'s [[World Tourism Organization]] reported that Armenia is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing tourist destinations according to the latest statistics.

For example, Armenia hosted the Plenary meeting of the [[Euronest Parliamentary Assembly]] in 2015 as well as ongoing [[Eastern Partnership]] and [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] conferences.

Many Iranians enjoy celebrating [[Nowruz]] (Iranian New Year) in Armenia, which is held on the 21 March, and spend their summer and winter vacations in a country free of religious restrictions and greater freedoms. The number of tourists visiting [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] has seen increases as well.\n\nIn 2011 there were 128 hotels, 102 camps, 31 holiday homes, 19 tour bases in Armenia - for 98,500 people overall. Since 2012 new hotels were built in Armenia, and the old ones were reconstructed. \u2033Tufenkian\u2033 hotels (in Yerevan, [[Tsapatagh]], [[Dzoraget]] and [[Dilijan]]), \u2033National\u2033, \u2033Paris\u2033 hotels were built in Yerevan, \u2033Nairi\u2033 and \u2033Silachi\u2033 hotels were reopened, \u2033Marriott\u2033 opened the second hotel in Tsaghkadzor, and in 2013 \u2033Hyatt\u2033 opened two hotels - in Jermuk and Yerevan, Golden Palace was opened in [[Tsaghkadzor]], later two more hotels - [https://www.operasuitehotel.com Opera Suite Hotel] and [[Radisson Blu Hotel, Yerevan|Radisson Blu]] were opened in Yerevan. These were the best hotels, with 4 or 5 stars.\n\nThe number of visitors to Armenia increases also due to festivals and international competitions. Examples include, the annual [[Golden Apricot]] international film festival, the annual [[Aurora Prize for Awakening Humanity]] award shows, the 2011 [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2011|Junior Eurovision Song Contest]] hosted in Armenia, the [[Birthright Armenia]] Program in which thousands of schoolchildren and students worldwide visit Armenia, and every four years, the [[Pan-Armenian Games]] are hosted in Armenia, in which thousands of competitors from across the [[Armenian Diaspora]] compete in various sporting events.[[File:Hotel Yerevan Royal Tulip (7).JPG|280px|thumb|<center>[[Grand Hotel Yerevan|Hotel Yerevan]], established in 1926 and formerly named \"Intourist\".</center>|alt=]]\n\n=== Soviet and transitional period ===\nDuring the [[Union of soviet socialist republics|soviet times]] (1922-1991) lots of citizens of the USSR republics visited [[Soviet Armenia]]. They were coming mainly for the work or pleasure. The new hotels were famous not only for the tourists, but also local population. The most popular hotels of Yerevan were \"Hotel Armenia\" (now [[Armenia Marriott Hotel Yerevan]]), \u2033Intourist\u2033 (became \"Yerevan Hotel\" in 1959 and currently known as [[Grand Hotel Yerevan]]), and \"Ani Hotel\" (now [[Ani Plaza Hotel]]). The latter was built in 1970 for the 50th anniversary of Armenian SSR and was called after the medieval capital of [[Bagratid Armenia]], [[Ani]].\n\nNew hotels such as the \"Youth Palace\", \"Dvin\", \"Shirak\" and others were built in Yerevan in 1980s. [[Dilijan]], [[Tsaghkadzor]], [[Sevan, Armenia|Sevan]], [[Arzni]], [[Vanadzor]], and [[Jermuk]] became famous resorts of summer vacations. Hotels and holiday homes were built in those towns as well. Besides the Armenian railways, which became twice as long, hundreds of kilometers of highways were built in Armenia. [[Erebuni Airport|Erebuni]] and [[Zvartnots International Airport|Zvartnots]] international airports, and also local airports in the towns of [[Berd]], [[Stepanavan]], [[Tashir]], [[Gyumri]], [[Sisian]], [[Jermuk]], [[Goris]], [[Kapan]] and [[Meghri]] in the second half of 20th century were developed.\n\nTourism in Armenia declined 1990s because of the [[1988 Armenian earthquake|Spitak earthquake]], the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] and [[Armenian energy crisis of 1990s|Armenian energy crisis]]. Armenian railways closed with neighboring Turkey and Azerbaijan, and Armenia rail lines only remained connected  with the Georgian railways. The only airport which worked permanently, was [[Zvartnots International Airport|Zvartnots]], as [[Erebuni Airport|Erebuni]] became a military airport. The eastern and western borders with [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Turkey]] remain closed.\n\n=== Before WWI ===\n[[File:Hotel London (Yerevan, 1891).jpg|thumb|280px|right|<center>Hotel de Londres, [[Yerevan]], 1891</center>]]\nThe inhabitants of neighboring and overseas countries were always interested in Armenia, since it had a [[History of Armenia|rich history]] and [[Culture of Armenia|unique culture]]. [[Hotel]]s and [[caravanserai]]s were built in Armenia since the Middle Ages. They were provided for the travelers and the traders of the [[Great Silk Way]].\n\nTourism infrastructure began to develop in Armenia in the modern era. Since the end of 19th century the Armenian provinces of [[Russian Empire]] ([[Yerevan Governorate|Yerevan]] and [[Elisabethpol Governorate|Elisabethpol]] governorates and [[Kars Oblast|Kars]] province) were connected by railway and telegraph with the other parts of [[Transcaucasia]], the central parts of the empire and the neighboring countries of that state. In the beginning of 20th century new railroads and causeways were built, including better infrastructure and telephone lines.

Many Iranians enjoy celebrating [[Nowruz]] (Iranian New Year) in Armenia, which is held on the 21 March, and spend their summer and winter vacations in a country free of religious restrictions and greater freedoms. The number of tourists visiting [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] has seen increases as well.\n\nIn 2011 there were 128 hotels, 102 camps, 31 holiday homes, 19 tour bases in Armenia - for 98,500 people overall. Since 2012 new hotels were built in Armenia, and the old ones were reconstructed. \u2033Tufenkian\u2033 hotels (in Yerevan, [[Tsapatagh]], [[Dzoraget]] and [[Dilijan]]), \u2033National\u2033, \u2033Paris\u2033 hotels were built in Yerevan, \u2033Nairi\u2033 and \u2033Silachi\u2033 hotels were reopened, \u2033Marriott\u2033 opened the second hotel in Tsaghkadzor, and in 2013 \u2033Hyatt\u2033 opened two hotels - in Jermuk and Yerevan, Golden Palace was opened in [[Tsaghkadzor]], later two more hotels - [https://www.operasuitehotel.com Opera Suite Hotel] and [[Radisson Blu Hotel, Yerevan|Radisson Blu]] were opened in Yerevan. These were the best hotels, with 4 or 5 stars.\n\nThe number of visitors to Armenia increases also due to festivals and international competitions. Examples include, the annual [[Golden Apricot]] international film festival, the annual [[Aurora Prize for Awakening Humanity]] award shows, the 2011 [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2011|Junior Eurovision Song Contest]] hosted in Armenia, the [[Birthright Armenia]] Program in which thousands of schoolchildren and students worldwide visit Armenia, and every four years, the [[Pan-Armenian Games]] are hosted in Armenia, in which thousands of competitors from across the [[Armenian Diaspora]] compete in various sporting events.[[File:Hotel Yerevan Royal Tulip (7).JPG|280px|thumb|<center>[[Grand Hotel Yerevan|Hotel Yerevan]], established in 1926 and formerly named \"Intourist\".</center>|alt=]]\n\n=== Soviet and transitional period ===\nDuring the [[Union of soviet socialist republics|soviet times]] (1922-1991) lots of citizens of the USSR republics visited [[Soviet Armenia]]. They were coming mainly for the work or pleasure. The new hotels were famous not only for the tourists, but also local population. The most popular hotels of Yerevan were \"Hotel Armenia\" (now [[Armenia Marriott Hotel Yerevan]]), \u2033Intourist\u2033 (became \"Yerevan Hotel\" in 1959 and currently known as [[Grand Hotel Yerevan]]), and \"Ani Hotel\" (now [[Ani Plaza Hotel]]). The latter was built in 1970 for the 50th anniversary of Armenian SSR and was called after the medieval capital of [[Bagratid Armenia]], [[Ani]].\n\nNew hotels such as the \"Youth Palace\", \"Dvin\", \"Shirak\" and others were built in Yerevan in 1980s. [[Dilijan]], [[Tsaghkadzor]], [[Sevan, Armenia|Sevan]], [[Arzni]], [[Vanadzor]], and [[Jermuk]] became famous resorts of summer vacations. Hotels and holiday homes were built in those towns as well. Besides the Armenian railways, which became twice as long, hundreds of kilometers of highways were built in Armenia. [[Erebuni Airport|Erebuni]] and [[Zvartnots International Airport|Zvartnots]] international airports, and also local airports in the towns of [[Berd]], [[Stepanavan]], [[Tashir]], [[Gyumri]], [[Sisian]], [[Jermuk]], [[Goris]], [[Kapan]] and [[Meghri]] in the second half of 20th century were developed.\n\nTourism in Armenia declined 1990s because of the [[1988 Armenian earthquake|Spitak earthquake]], the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] and [[Armenian energy crisis of 1990s|Armenian energy crisis]]. Armenian railways closed with neighboring Turkey and Azerbaijan, and Armenia rail lines only remained connected  with the Georgian railways. The only airport which worked permanently, was [[Zvartnots International Airport|Zvartnots]], as [[Erebuni Airport|Erebuni]] became a military airport. The eastern and western borders with [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Turkey]] remain closed.\n\n=== Before WWI ===\n[[File:Hotel London (Yerevan, 1891).jpg|thumb|280px|right|<center>Hotel de Londres, [[Yerevan]], 1891</center>]]\nThe inhabitants of neighboring and overseas countries were always interested in Armenia, since it had a [[History of Armenia|rich history]] and [[Culture of Armenia|unique culture]]. [[Hotel]]s and [[caravanserai]]s were built in Armenia since the Middle Ages. They were provided for the travelers and the traders of the [[Great Silk Way]].\n\nTourism infrastructure began to develop in Armenia in the modern era. Since the end of 19th century the Armenian provinces of [[Russian Empire]] ([[Yerevan Governorate|Yerevan]] and [[Elisabethpol Governorate|Elisabethpol]] governorates and [[Kars Oblast|Kars]] province) were connected by railway and telegraph with the other parts of [[Transcaucasia]], the central parts of the empire and the neighboring countries of that state. In the beginning of 20th century new railroads and causeways were built, including better infrastructure and telephone lines. In the main cities of [[Yerevan]], [[Shushi]], [[Alexandropol]] ([[Gyumri]]) and [[Kars]] building process of hotels started.\n\n== Government regulation ==\nThe tourism sector is regulated by the Tourism Committee,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://armenia.travel/en|title=The official tourism website of Armenia|website=armenia.travel|language=en|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref> a department of the [[Ministry of Economy (Armenia)|Ministry of Economy]].\n\n== Statistics ==\n{| class=\"infobox\"\n|colspan=\"8\" style=\"background:#CF4A4A; color:white\"|<center>'''Tourists in Armenia'''<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal |date= 31 March 2016|title= \u0536\u0562\u0578\u057d\u0561\u0577\u0580\u057b\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0576\u0568 \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0574. \"\u0546\u0561\u056d\u0576\u0575\u0561\u0581 \u0570\u0561\u0575\u0580\u0565\u0576\u056b\u0584\u056b \u056f\u0561\u0576\u0579\u0568\" \u0579\u056b \u0583\u0580\u056f\u0578\u0582\u0574 \u0576\u0565\u0580\u0563\u0576\u0561 \u0566\u0562\u0578\u057d\u0561\u0577\u0580\u057b\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0576\u0576 \u0561\u0576\u056f\u0578\u0582\u0574\u056b\u0581 |url= http://www.tert.am/am/news/2016/03/31/ameria/1979635|url-status= |journal= tert.am |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170427122522/http://www.tert.am/am/news/2016/03/31/ameria/1979635 |archive-date= 27 April 2016 }}</ref></center>\n|-\n!

MRI enables assessment of the average molecular composition of soft tissues, and thus provides information regarding the relative fat content of marrow.

Because fat molecules have a high [[T1-weighted MRI|T1-relaxivity]], T1-weighted imaging sequences show \"yellow\" fatty marrow as bright (hyperintense). Furthermore, normal fatty marrow loses signal on fat-saturation sequences, in a similar pattern to subcutaneous fat.\n\nWhen \"yellow\" fatty marrow becomes replaced by tissue with more cellular composition, this change is apparent as decreased brightness on T1-weighted sequences. Both normal \"red\" marrow and pathologic marrow lesions (such as cancer) are darker than \"yellow\" marrow on T1-weight sequences, although can often be distinguished by comparison with the MR signal intensity of adjacent soft tissues.

For instance, they generate [[colony stimulating factors]], which have a significant effect on [[hematopoiesis]]. Cell types that constitute the bone marrow stroma include:\n*[[fibroblasts]] ([[reticular connective tissue]])\n*[[macrophages]], which contribute especially to [[red blood cell]] production, as they deliver [[iron]] for [[hemoglobin]] production.\n*[[Marrow Adipose Tissue|adipocytes]] (fat cells)\n*[[osteoblasts]] (synthesize bone)\n*[[osteoclasts]] (resorb bone)\n*[[endothelial cells]], which form the [[sinusoid blood vessel|sinusoids]]. These derive from [[endothelial stem cell]]s, which are also present in the bone marrow.<ref name=ruben/>\n\n==Function==\n\n===Mesenchymal stem cells===\n{{Main|Mesenchymal stem cell}}\nThe bone marrow stroma contains [[mesenchymal stem cells]] (MSCs),<ref name=ruben/> also known as marrow stromal cells. These are [[multipotent]] [[stem cell]]s that can [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into a variety of cell types. MSCs have been shown to differentiate, [[in vitro]] or [[in vivo]], into [[osteoblast]]s, [[chondrocyte]]s, [[myocyte]]s, [[Marrow Adipose Tissue|marrow adipocytes]] and [[Beta cell|beta-pancreatic islets cells]].\n\n===Bone marrow barrier===\nThe [[blood vessels]] of the bone marrow constitute a barrier, inhibiting immature blood cells from leaving the marrow. Only mature blood cells contain the [[membrane protein]]s, such as [[aquaporin]] and [[glycophorin]], that are required to attach to and pass the blood vessel [[endothelium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acbd.monash.org/docs/red-cell-membrane.pdf|title=The Red Cell Membrane: structure and pathologies|publisher=Australian Centre for Blood Diseases/[[Monash University]]|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref> [[Hematopoietic stem cell]]s may also cross the bone marrow barrier, and may thus be harvested from blood.\n\n===Lymphatic role===\nThe red bone marrow is a key element of the [[lymphatic system]], being one of the [[Lymphatic system#Primary lymphoid organs|primary lymphoid organs]] that generate [[lymphocytes]] from immature hematopoietic [[progenitor cell]]s.<ref name=\"AllOnHealthLymph\">[http://allonhealth.com/health-news/par-lymphatic-system.htm The Lymphatic System]. Allonhealth.com. Retrieved 5 December 2011.</ref> The bone marrow and [[thymus]] constitute the primary lymphoid tissues involved in the production and early selection of lymphocytes. Furthermore, bone marrow performs a [[valve]]-like function to prevent the backflow of [[lymphatic fluid]] in the lymphatic system.\n\n===Compartmentalization===\n[[Cellular compartment|Biological compartmentalization]] is evident within the bone marrow, in that certain cell types tend to aggregate in specific areas. For instance, [[erythrocytes]], [[macrophages]], and their [[chemical precursor|precursors]] tend to gather around [[blood vessels]], while [[granulocytes]] gather at the borders of the bone marrow.<ref name=ruben/>\n\n==As food==\n{{See also|Bone marrow (food)}}\nAnimal bone marrow has been [[Bone marrow (food)|used in cuisine]] worldwide for millennia, such as the famed  [[Milan]]ese  [[Ossobuco]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Clinical significance==\n\n===Disease===\nThe normal bone marrow architecture can be damaged or displaced by [[aplastic anemia]], [[cancer|malignancies]] such as [[multiple myeloma]], or infections such as [[tuberculosis]], leading to a decrease in the production of blood cells and blood platelets. The bone marrow can also be affected by various forms of [[leukemia]], which attacks its hematologic progenitor cells.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Human acute myeloid leukemia is organized as a hierarchy that originates from a primitive hematopoietic cell|date=1997|volume=3|issue=7|doi=10.1038/nm0797-730|pages=730\u2013737|journal=Nature Medicine|pmid=9212098 | last1 = Bonnet | first1 = D | last2 = Dick | first2 = JE}}</ref> Furthermore, exposure to [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] or [[chemotherapy]] will kill many of the rapidly dividing cells of the bone marrow, and will therefore result in a depressed [[immune system]]. Many of the symptoms of [[radiation poisoning]] are due to damage sustained by the bone marrow cells.\n\nTo diagnose diseases involving the bone marrow, a [[bone marrow aspiration]] is sometimes performed. This typically involves using a hollow needle to acquire a sample of red bone marrow from the [[iliac crest|crest of the ilium]] under general or [[local anesthesia]].<ref name=T4/>\n\n===Application of stem cells in therapeutics===\n\nBone marrow derived stem cells have a wide array of application in regenerative medicine.<ref>\n{{cite journal |authors=Mahla RS| title = Stem cells application in regenerative medicine and disease threpeutics | journal = International Journal of Cell Biology  | volume = 2016 | issue = 7 | pages = 1\u201324 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27516776 | doi = 10.1155/2016/6940283 | pmc=4969512}}</ref>\n\n===Imaging===\nMedical imaging may provide a limited amount of information regarding bone marrow. [[Radiograph|Plain film x-rays]] pass through soft tissues such as marrow and do not provide visualization, although any changes in the structure of the associated bone may be detected.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ellmann|first=Stephan|last2=Beck|first2=Michael|last3=Kuwert|first3=Torsten|last4=Uder|first4=Michael|last5=B\u00e4uerle|first5=Tobias|title=Multimodal imaging of bone metastases: From preclinical to clinical applications |journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Translation|volume=3|issue=4|pages=166\u2013177|doi=10.1016/j.jot.2015.07.004|pmid=30035055|pmc=5986987|year=2015}}</ref> [[Computed tomography|CT]] imaging has somewhat better capacity for assessing the marrow cavity of bones, although with low sensitivity and specificity. For example, normal fatty \"yellow\" marrow in adult long bones is of low density (-30 to -100 Hounsfield units), between subcutaneous fat and soft tissue. Tissue with increased cellular composition, such as normal \"red\" marrow or cancer cells within the medullary cavity will measure variably higher in density.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nishida|first=Y|last2=Matsue|first2=Y|last3=Suehara|first3=Y|last4=Fukumoto|first4=K|last5=Fujisawa|first5=M|last6=Takeuchi|first6=M|last7=Ouchi|first7=E|last8=Matsue|first8=K|date=August 2015|title=Clinical and prognostic significance of bone marrow abnormalities in the appendicular skeleton detected by low-doe whole-body multidetector computed tomography in patients with multiple myeloma |journal=Blood Cancer Journal|language=En|volume=5|issue=7|page=e329|doi=10.1038/bcj.2015.57|pmid=26230953|pmc=4526783|issn=2044-5385}}</ref>\n\n[[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] is more sensitive and specific for assessing bone composition. MRI enables assessment of the average molecular composition of soft tissues, and thus provides information regarding the relative fat content of marrow. In adult humans, \"yellow\" fatty marrow is the dominant tissue in bones, particularly in the (peripheral) [[appendicular skeleton]]. Because fat molecules have a high [[T1-weighted MRI|T1-relaxivity]], T1-weighted imaging sequences show \"yellow\" fatty marrow as bright (hyperintense). Furthermore, normal fatty marrow loses signal on fat-saturation sequences, in a similar pattern to subcutaneous fat.\n\nWhen \"yellow\" fatty marrow becomes replaced by tissue with more cellular composition, this change is apparent as decreased brightness on T1-weighted sequences. Both normal \"red\" marrow and pathologic marrow lesions (such as cancer) are darker than \"yellow\" marrow on T1-weight sequences, although can often be distinguished by comparison with the MR signal intensity of adjacent soft tissues. Normal \"red\" marrow is typically equivalent or brighter than skeletal muscle or intervertebral disc on T1-weighted sequences.<ref name=\"Chan 1911\u20131930\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Poulton|first1=TB|last2=Murphy|first2=WD|last3=Duerk|first3=JL|last4=Chapek|first4=CC|last5=Feiglin|first5=DH|date=December 1993|title=Bone marrow reconversion in adults who are smokers: MR Imaging findings.|journal=AJR.

Bone marrow examination is used in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, [[anemia]], and [[pancytopenia]]. The bone marrow produces the cellular elements of the blood, including [[platelet]]s, [[red blood cell]]s and [[white blood cell]]s. While much information can be gleaned by testing the blood itself (drawn from a vein by [[Venipuncture|phlebotomy]]), it is sometimes necessary to examine the source of the blood cells in the bone marrow to obtain more information on hematopoiesis; this is the role of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.\n\nThe ratio between [[Myeloid cell|myeloid series]] and [[erythroid]] cells is relevant to bone marrow function, and also to diseases of the bone marrow and [[peripheral blood]], such as leukemia and anemia. The normal myeloid-to-erythroid ratio is around 3:1; this ratio may increase in [[myelogenous leukemia]]s, decrease in [[polycythemia]]s, and reverse in cases of [[thalassemia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=75938|title=Definition: 'M:E Ratio'|publisher=Stedman's Medical Dictionary via MediLexicon.com|date=2006|accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Donation and transplantation===\n{{Main|Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation}}\n[[Image:Bone marrow biopsy.jpg|thumb|A bone marrow harvest in progress.]]\n[[File:Site for procedure of Bone Marrow.jpg|thumb|The preferred sites for the procedure]]\nIn a [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone marrow transplant]], hematopoietic stem cells are removed from a person and infused into another person (allogenic) or into the same person at a later time (autologous). If the donor and recipient are compatible, these infused cells will then travel to the bone marrow and initiate blood cell production. Transplantation from one person to another is conducted for the treatment of severe bone marrow diseases, such as congenital defects, autoimmune diseases or malignancies. The patient's own marrow is first killed off with drugs or [[radiotherapy|radiation]], and then the new stem cells are introduced. Before radiation therapy or [[chemotherapy]] in cases of [[cancer]], some of the patient's hematopoietic stem cells are sometimes harvested and later infused back when the therapy is finished to restore the immune system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-transplantation-stem-cell-transplantation-beyond-the-basics|title=Bone marrow transplantation|publisher=UpToDate.com|accessdate=12 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nBone marrow stem cells can be induced to become neural cells to treat neurological illnesses,<ref name=Antibody2013/> and can also potentially be used for the treatment of other illnesses, such as [[inflammatory bowel disease]].<ref name=\"wakehealth.edu\"/> In 2013, following a clinical trial, scientists proposed that bone marrow transplantation could be used to treat [[HIV]] in conjunction with [[antiretroviral]] drugs;<ref name=HIVTreat>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23132561|title=Bone marrow 'frees men of HIV drugs'|publisher=BBC|date=3 July 2013|accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref><ref name=PopularSci2013>{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-07/stem-cell-transplants-erase-hiv-two-men|title=Stem-Cell Transplants Erase HIV In Two Men|work=PopSci|date=3 July 2013|accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref> however, it was later found that HIV remained in the bodies of the test subjects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/12/10/hiv-returns-in-two-men-thought-cured-by-bone-marrow-transplants/|title=HIV Returns in Two Men Thought 'Cured' by Bone Marrow Transplants|publisher=RH Reality Check|date=10 December 2013|accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Harvesting====\nThe stem cells are typically harvested directly from the red marrow in the [[iliac crest]], often under [[general anesthesia]].

The treaty's full name is '''Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes'''. It allows the United States and the UK to exchange nuclear materials, technology and information. While the US has [[nuclear sharing|nuclear co-operation]] agreements with other countries, including France and other [[NATO]] countries, this agreement is by far the most comprehensive. Because of the agreement's strategic value to Britain, [[Harold Macmillan]] (the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] who presided over the United Kingdom's entry into the agreement) called it \"the Great Prize\".{{sfn|Macmillan|1971|p=323}}\n\nThe treaty was signed on 3 July 1958, after the [[Soviet Union]] [[Sputnik crisis|shocked the American public]] with the launch of [[Sputnik]] on 4 October 1957, and the [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] successfully tested a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test on 8 November. The Anglo-American [[Special Relationship]] proved mutually beneficial, although it was never one of equals after the World Wars; the United States was (and is) far larger than Britain both militarily and economically. Britain soon became dependent on the United States for its nuclear weapons, as it lacked the resources to produce a range of designs. The treaty allowed American nuclear weapons to be supplied to Britain through [[Project E]], for use by the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[British Army of the Rhine]].\n\nThe treaty provided for the sale to the UK of one complete [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] plant, plus ten years' supply of [[enriched uranium]] to fuel it. Other nuclear material was also acquired from the United States under the treaty. Some 5.4 tonnes of UK-produced [[plutonium]] was sent to the US in return for {{convert|6.7|kg|lb}} of [[tritium]] and 7.5 tonnes of [[highly enriched uranium]] (HEU) between 1960 and 1979, although much of the HEU was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing fleet of UK [[nuclear submarine]]s. The treaty paved the way for the [[Polaris Sales Agreement]], and the [[Royal Navy]] ultimately acquired entire weapons systems, with the [[UK Polaris programme]] and [[Trident nuclear programme]] using American missiles with British nuclear warheads.\n\nThe treaty has been amended and renewed nine times. The most recent renewal extended it to 31 December 2024.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Quebec Agreement ===\n[[File:Winston Churchill at the Quebec Conference, August 1943 H32144.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in 1943.

When [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]] raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June 1945, the American copy could not be found.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=457\u2013458}} The Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. On 4 July, Wilson gave British agreement for the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use of nuclear weapons against Japan]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=372}} On 8 August the Prime Minister, [[Clement Attlee]], sent a message to President [[Harry Truman]] in which he referred to themselves as \"heads of the Governments which have control of this great force\".{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=372\u2013373}}\n\n=== Truman administration ===\nThe British government had trusted that the United States would continue to share nuclear technology, which it considered to be a joint discovery.{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}} On 9 November 1945, Attlee and the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Mackenzie King]], went to Washington, DC, to confer with Truman about future co-operation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power.{{sfn|Gott|1963|p=240}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=73\u201377}} A Memorandum of Intention they signed on 16 November 1945 made Canada a full partner, and replaced the Quebec Agreement's requirement for \"mutual consent\" before using nuclear weapons with one for \"prior consultation\". There was to be \"full and effective co-operation in the field of atomic energy\", but British hopes were soon disappointed;{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=92}} this was only \"in the field of basic scientific research\".{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=80\u201383}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=468}}\n\nTechnical co-operation was ended by the [[United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (McMahon Act), which forbade passing \"restricted data\" to the United States' allies under pain of death.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=106\u2013108}} This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of British physicist [[Alan Nunn May]] in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=105\u2013108}} Fearing a resurgence of [[United States non-interventionism|American isolationism]], and Britain losing its [[great power]] status, the British government restarted its own development effort,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=181\u2013184}} now codenamed [[High Explosive Research]].{{sfn|Cathcart|1995|pp=23\u201324, 48, 57}}\n\nBy the end of 1947, {{convert|1900|lt}} of uranium ore from the [[Belgian Congo]] was stockpiled for the Combined Development Trust at [[Springfields]], near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in [[Lancashire]], as part of a wartime sharing agreement, along with {{convert|1350|lt}} for British use. To gain access to the stockpile for their own nuclear weapons project, the Americans opened negotiations that resulted in the ''[[Modus Vivendi]]'',{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=358\u2013360}} an agreement which was signed on 7 January 1948. This officially terminated all previous agreements, including the Quebec Agreement. It removed the British right of consultation on the use of nuclear weapons,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=34\u201335}} allowed for limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=245\u2013254}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=281\u2013283}} and continued the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=34\u201335}} although the latter was renamed the [[Combined Development Agency]].{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=352\u2013353}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=285}}\n\nIn 1949, the Americans offered to make atomic bombs in the United States available for Britain to use if the British agreed to curtail their atomic bomb programme.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=307\u2013308}} This would have given Britain nuclear weapons much sooner than its own target date of late 1952.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=310}} Only those bomb components required by war plans would be stored in the UK, the rest would be kept in the US and Canada.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=281\u2013283}} The offer was rejected by the British on the grounds that it was not \"compatible with our status as a first-class power to depend on others for weapons of this supreme importance\".{{sfn|Baylis|1995|p=75}}\n\nAs a counter-offer, the British proposed limiting the British programme in return for American bombs.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=309\u2013310}} The opposition of key American officials, including [[Lewis Strauss]] from the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC), and Senators [[Bourke B. Hickenlooper]] and [[Arthur Vandenberg]] of the [[Joint Committee on Atomic Energy]] (JCAE), coupled with security concerns aroused by the 2 February 1950 arrest of the British physicist [[Klaus Fuchs]], as an [[atomic spy]], caused the proposal to be dropped.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=312\u2013314}} The June 1951 defection of [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]], who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, reinforced the Americans' distrust of British security arrangements.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n=== Eisenhower administration ===\nThe first British atomic bomb was successfully tested in [[Western Australia]] in [[Operation Hurricane]] on 3 October 1952,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=493\u2013495}}\nbut although it was more advanced than the American bombs of 1946, Britain was still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=474\u2013475}} On 1 November, the United States conducted [[Ivy Mike]], the first [[nuclear test]] of a true [[thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear device]] (also known as a hydrogen bomb).{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=16\u201320}} The JCAE saw little benefit for the United States from sharing technology with Britain.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=27\u201330}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=498\u2013500}} The [[Soviet Union]] responded to Ivy Mike with the test of [[Joe 4]], a [[boosted fission weapon]] on 12 August 1953.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=27\u201330}} This prompted President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], who was [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] in January 1953, to inform the [[United States Congress]] that the McMahon Act, which he considered a \"terrible piece of legislation\" and \"one of the most deplorable incidents in American history of which he personally felt ashamed\", was obsolete.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=429\u2013430}}\n\n[[File:International Diplomacy.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Dwight D.

The United States would have to disclose their weights and dimensions, while their delivery would require data concerning their ballistics. Further down the track, there would also be issues of custody, security and targeting. The release of such information was restricted by the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nThis was amended on 30 August 1954 by the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]], which allowed for greater exchange of information with foreign nations,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=140\u2013141}} paving the way for the Agreement for Co-operation Regarding Atomic Information for Mutual Defence Purposes, which was signed on 15 June 1955.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=147\u2013149}} On 13 June 1956, another agreement was concluded, for the transfer of [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] technology to Britain, saving the British government millions of pounds in research and development costs. This precipitated a row with the JCAE over whether this was permitted under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and whether Britain met the security standards set by the 1955 agreement. With the [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 presidential election]] approaching, Eisenhower was forced to rescind the offer.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=161\u2013164}}\n\nThe October 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] brought relations between Britain and the United States to a low ebb.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=171\u2013174}} When Eisenhower met with the new Prime Minister, [[Harold Macmillan]], in Bermuda in March 1957, he raised the possibility of basing US [[intermediate range ballistic missile]] (IRBM) systems in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=174\u2013177}} This came to be called [[Project Emily]].{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=98\u201399}} There were also discussions on exchanging nuclear submarine propulsion technology for information on the British [[Calder Hall]] [[nuclear power plant]], allowing the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA) to purchase uranium ore from Canada, and co-ordinating the war plans of [[RAF Bomber Command]] with those of the [[Strategic Air Command]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=180\u2013181}}\n\nAlthough the IRBM negotiations pre-dated the Suez Crisis, it suited the British government to tout the IRBM deal as a demonstration that the rift had been healed.{{sfn|Young|2007|p=8}} The [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] attempted to detonate a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test series at [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]] in the Pacific.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}} The test series was facilitated by the United States, which also claimed the island.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=159\u2013160}} Although the first tests were unsuccessful,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=147}} the Grapple X test on 8 November achieved the desired result.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}}{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=160\u2013162}}\n==Negotiation==\n===Sputnik crisis===\n[[File:HD.3C.001 (13406014683).jpg|thumb|right|Eisenhower (left) lays the cornerstone for the new [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) building in [[Germantown, Maryland]], on 8 November 1957.

The Soviet Union's launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the world's first [[artificial satellite]], on 4 October 1957, came as a tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Now, suddenly, there was incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action in response to the [[Sputnik crisis]], officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend their relationship.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=199\u2013201}} At the suggestion of [[Harold Caccia, Baron Caccia|Harold Caccia]], the [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to the United States|British Ambassador to the United States]], Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=199}} as Macmillan put it, to meet the Soviet challenge on every front, \"military, economic and political\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1955-57v27/d306 |access-date=12 September 2017 |title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1955\u20131957, Western Europe and Canada, Volume XXVII \u2013 Document 306  |publisher=Office of the Historian, United States Department of State }}</ref>\n\nMacmillan flew to Washington, DC, for talks on 25 October.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} He had concerns that the disastrous 10 October [[Windscale fire]] might prove a stumbling block in negotiations,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} as it might reflect badly on British expertise and provide ammunition for opponents of closer co-operation with the UK.

Quarles]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense]], to consider how the deployment of IRBMs to Britain might be expedited.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} Another study group, under Strauss and Sir [[Edwin Plowden, Baron Plowden|Edwin Plowden]], the head of the UKAEA, would investigate nuclear co-operation and the exchange of nuclear information.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} The personal relationship developed between Plowden and Strauss would be crucial in converting the latter over to the idea of providing information to Britain.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}}\n\nBy December, most of the issues with the IRBM negotiations had been ironed out,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=442}} and a formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December, although it was not until the end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]] and not [[PGM-19|Jupiter]] missiles.{{sfn|Wynn|1997|p=287}} However, the nuclear submarine propulsion effort was running into trouble. Under the July 1956 agreement and a February 1957 directive from Eisenhower, [[Royal Navy]] officers had been assigned to study the US Navy's nuclear submarine programme. By October 1957, its head, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Hyman G. Rickover]], felt that their questions were slowing the deployment of the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarine-launched IRBM at a critical time. He feared that any delay might cause Congress to favour land-based missiles. By December, the British liaison officers were complaining of slow response to their questions. Rickover proposed that [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] be permitted to sell the Royal Navy a nuclear submarine reactor, which would allow it to immediately proceed with building its own nuclear-powered submarine. The British government endorsed this idea, as it would save it a great deal of money.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}}{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=441\u2013442}}\n\n===Amending the McMahon Act===\nFor their part, the British wanted the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear co-operation to be relaxed. They wanted to know the weight and dimensions, fusing and firing sequences, safety features, and in-flight procedures; the information that would allow American bombs to be carried in British [[V-bombers]], and American warheads to be fitted to British [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]] missiles.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} This would potentially save millions of pounds and avoid domestic political complications if Britain had to persist with nuclear testing during an international moratorium.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}} While the British knew what they wanted, there was no consensus among the Americans as to what they wanted to provide.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} The [[United States Secretary of State]], [[John Foster Dulles]], was concerned that a special relationship with Britain might complicate the United States' relationships with its other allies.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=439}} Strauss in particular felt that a proposal to give hydrogen bomb secrets to the British would likely not get past the JCAE, and counselled drafting amendments that were sufficiently vague as to give the president the authority he needed without arousing its ire.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} Eisenhower declared that the US and UK were \"interdependent\", and pledged to ask Congress to amend the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Moore|2010|p=33}}\n\nCrucially, he managed to secure the support of [[Carl T. Durham]], the chairman of the JCAE. Eisenhower met with congressional leaders on 3 December 1957, and pressed for more discretion to co-operate with all America's [[NATO]] allies, and not just Britain.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} Indeed the administration negotiated agreements with Australia, Canada and NATO.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} While Eisenhower did not yet have wholehearted support for the proposal, outright opposition from [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Clinton P. Anderson]] failed to attract much support.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} On 27 January 1958, Strauss sent Durham the administration's proposed legislative changes,{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} and the JCAE Subcommittee on Agreements for Cooperation, chaired by Senator [[John O. Pastore]], held hearings from 29 to 31 January. Quarles and [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Herbert Loper]], the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy Affairs, were forced to deal with pointed questions about [[nuclear proliferation]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=215\u2013219}} British information security, or the lack thereof, no longer seemed so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead, and the United Kingdom had independently developed the hydrogen bomb,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=224\u2013225}} but the JCAE objected to the terms of the proposed deal to trade British uranium-235 for American [[plutonium]], under which the US would pay [[United States dollar|USD]] $30 per gram for plutonium that cost USD $12 per gram to produce in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=224}}\n\nThe amendments were passed by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on 19 June, but not without changes. It now limited exchanges of nuclear weapons data to nations that had made substantial progress in the field. The same restriction applied to the actual transfer of non-nuclear components of nuclear weapons. American nuclear weapons were to remain under US custody and could only be turned over to allies in the event of war. The sale of nuclear reactors for submarines and nuclear fuel for them and other military reactors was permitted. Only Britain qualified as a nation that had made substantial progress.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=232\u2013233}} The bill passed Congress on 30 June 1958, and was signed into law by Eisenhower on 2 July 1958.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=234\u2013236}} The 1958 US\u2013UK Mutual Defence Agreement was signed by Dulles and [[Samuel Hood, 6th Viscount Hood|Samuel Hood]], the British Minister in Washington, DC, on 3 July,<ref name=\"full text\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/media/pdfs/56_4.pdf |title=Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defence Purposes |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |access-date=1 June 2017 }}</ref> and approved by Congress on 30 July.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=238}}\n\n==Implementation==\n===Details of the agreement===\n[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 080709-D-7203C-008.jpg|thumb|left|UK Defence Minister [[Des Browne]] (right) addresses a reception hosted by US Defense Secretary [[Robert M.

The treaty's full name is '''Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes'''. It allows the United States and the UK to exchange nuclear materials, technology and information. While the US has [[nuclear sharing|nuclear co-operation]] agreements with other countries, including France and other [[NATO]] countries, this agreement is by far the most comprehensive. Because of the agreement's strategic value to Britain, [[Harold Macmillan]] (the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] who presided over the United Kingdom's entry into the agreement) called it \"the Great Prize\".{{sfn|Macmillan|1971|p=323}}\n\nThe treaty was signed on 3 July 1958, after the [[Soviet Union]] [[Sputnik crisis|shocked the American public]] with the launch of [[Sputnik]] on 4 October 1957, and the [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] successfully tested a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test on 8 November. The Anglo-American [[Special Relationship]] proved mutually beneficial, although it was never one of equals after the World Wars; the United States was (and is) far larger than Britain both militarily and economically. Britain soon became dependent on the United States for its nuclear weapons, as it lacked the resources to produce a range of designs. The treaty allowed American nuclear weapons to be supplied to Britain through [[Project E]], for use by the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[British Army of the Rhine]].\n\nThe treaty provided for the sale to the UK of one complete [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] plant, plus ten years' supply of [[enriched uranium]] to fuel it. Other nuclear material was also acquired from the United States under the treaty. Some 5.4 tonnes of UK-produced [[plutonium]] was sent to the US in return for {{convert|6.7|kg|lb}} of [[tritium]] and 7.5 tonnes of [[highly enriched uranium]] (HEU) between 1960 and 1979, although much of the HEU was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing fleet of UK [[nuclear submarine]]s. The treaty paved the way for the [[Polaris Sales Agreement]], and the [[Royal Navy]] ultimately acquired entire weapons systems, with the [[UK Polaris programme]] and [[Trident nuclear programme]] using American missiles with British nuclear warheads.\n\nThe treaty has been amended and renewed nine times. The most recent renewal extended it to 31 December 2024.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Quebec Agreement ===\n[[File:Winston Churchill at the Quebec Conference, August 1943 H32144.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in 1943.

When [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]] raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June 1945, the American copy could not be found.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=457\u2013458}} The Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. On 4 July, Wilson gave British agreement for the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use of nuclear weapons against Japan]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=372}} On 8 August the Prime Minister, [[Clement Attlee]], sent a message to President [[Harry Truman]] in which he referred to themselves as \"heads of the Governments which have control of this great force\".{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=372\u2013373}}\n\n=== Truman administration ===\nThe British government had trusted that the United States would continue to share nuclear technology, which it considered to be a joint discovery.{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}} On 9 November 1945, Attlee and the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Mackenzie King]], went to Washington, DC, to confer with Truman about future co-operation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power.{{sfn|Gott|1963|p=240}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=73\u201377}} A Memorandum of Intention they signed on 16 November 1945 made Canada a full partner, and replaced the Quebec Agreement's requirement for \"mutual consent\" before using nuclear weapons with one for \"prior consultation\". There was to be \"full and effective co-operation in the field of atomic energy\", but British hopes were soon disappointed;{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=92}} this was only \"in the field of basic scientific research\".{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=80\u201383}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=468}}\n\nTechnical co-operation was ended by the [[United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (McMahon Act), which forbade passing \"restricted data\" to the United States' allies under pain of death.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=106\u2013108}} This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of British physicist [[Alan Nunn May]] in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=105\u2013108}} Fearing a resurgence of [[United States non-interventionism|American isolationism]], and Britain losing its [[great power]] status, the British government restarted its own development effort,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=181\u2013184}} now codenamed [[High Explosive Research]].{{sfn|Cathcart|1995|pp=23\u201324, 48, 57}}\n\nBy the end of 1947, {{convert|1900|lt}} of uranium ore from the [[Belgian Congo]] was stockpiled for the Combined Development Trust at [[Springfields]], near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in [[Lancashire]], as part of a wartime sharing agreement, along with {{convert|1350|lt}} for British use. To gain access to the stockpile for their own nuclear weapons project, the Americans opened negotiations that resulted in the ''[[Modus Vivendi]]'',{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=358\u2013360}} an agreement which was signed on 7 January 1948. This officially terminated all previous agreements, including the Quebec Agreement. It removed the British right of consultation on the use of nuclear weapons,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=34\u201335}} allowed for limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=245\u2013254}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=281\u2013283}} and continued the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=34\u201335}} although the latter was renamed the [[Combined Development Agency]].{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=352\u2013353}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=285}}\n\nIn 1949, the Americans offered to make atomic bombs in the United States available for Britain to use if the British agreed to curtail their atomic bomb programme.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=307\u2013308}} This would have given Britain nuclear weapons much sooner than its own target date of late 1952.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=310}} Only those bomb components required by war plans would be stored in the UK, the rest would be kept in the US and Canada.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=281\u2013283}} The offer was rejected by the British on the grounds that it was not \"compatible with our status as a first-class power to depend on others for weapons of this supreme importance\".{{sfn|Baylis|1995|p=75}}\n\nAs a counter-offer, the British proposed limiting the British programme in return for American bombs.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=309\u2013310}} The opposition of key American officials, including [[Lewis Strauss]] from the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC), and Senators [[Bourke B. Hickenlooper]] and [[Arthur Vandenberg]] of the [[Joint Committee on Atomic Energy]] (JCAE), coupled with security concerns aroused by the 2 February 1950 arrest of the British physicist [[Klaus Fuchs]], as an [[atomic spy]], caused the proposal to be dropped.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=312\u2013314}} The June 1951 defection of [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]], who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, reinforced the Americans' distrust of British security arrangements.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n=== Eisenhower administration ===\nThe first British atomic bomb was successfully tested in [[Western Australia]] in [[Operation Hurricane]] on 3 October 1952,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=493\u2013495}}\nbut although it was more advanced than the American bombs of 1946, Britain was still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=474\u2013475}} On 1 November, the United States conducted [[Ivy Mike]], the first [[nuclear test]] of a true [[thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear device]] (also known as a hydrogen bomb).{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=16\u201320}} The JCAE saw little benefit for the United States from sharing technology with Britain.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=27\u201330}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=498\u2013500}} The [[Soviet Union]] responded to Ivy Mike with the test of [[Joe 4]], a [[boosted fission weapon]] on 12 August 1953.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=27\u201330}} This prompted President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], who was [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] in January 1953, to inform the [[United States Congress]] that the McMahon Act, which he considered a \"terrible piece of legislation\" and \"one of the most deplorable incidents in American history of which he personally felt ashamed\", was obsolete.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=429\u2013430}}\n\n[[File:International Diplomacy.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Dwight D.

The United States would have to disclose their weights and dimensions, while their delivery would require data concerning their ballistics. Further down the track, there would also be issues of custody, security and targeting. The release of such information was restricted by the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nThis was amended on 30 August 1954 by the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]], which allowed for greater exchange of information with foreign nations,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=140\u2013141}} paving the way for the Agreement for Co-operation Regarding Atomic Information for Mutual Defence Purposes, which was signed on 15 June 1955.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=147\u2013149}} On 13 June 1956, another agreement was concluded, for the transfer of [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] technology to Britain, saving the British government millions of pounds in research and development costs. This precipitated a row with the JCAE over whether this was permitted under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and whether Britain met the security standards set by the 1955 agreement. With the [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 presidential election]] approaching, Eisenhower was forced to rescind the offer.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=161\u2013164}}\n\nThe October 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] brought relations between Britain and the United States to a low ebb.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=171\u2013174}} When Eisenhower met with the new Prime Minister, [[Harold Macmillan]], in Bermuda in March 1957, he raised the possibility of basing US [[intermediate range ballistic missile]] (IRBM) systems in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=174\u2013177}} This came to be called [[Project Emily]].{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=98\u201399}} There were also discussions on exchanging nuclear submarine propulsion technology for information on the British [[Calder Hall]] [[nuclear power plant]], allowing the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA) to purchase uranium ore from Canada, and co-ordinating the war plans of [[RAF Bomber Command]] with those of the [[Strategic Air Command]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=180\u2013181}}\n\nAlthough the IRBM negotiations pre-dated the Suez Crisis, it suited the British government to tout the IRBM deal as a demonstration that the rift had been healed.{{sfn|Young|2007|p=8}} The [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] attempted to detonate a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test series at [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]] in the Pacific.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}} The test series was facilitated by the United States, which also claimed the island.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=159\u2013160}} Although the first tests were unsuccessful,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=147}} the Grapple X test on 8 November achieved the desired result.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}}{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=160\u2013162}}\n==Negotiation==\n===Sputnik crisis===\n[[File:HD.3C.001 (13406014683).jpg|thumb|right|Eisenhower (left) lays the cornerstone for the new [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) building in [[Germantown, Maryland]], on 8 November 1957.

The Soviet Union's launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the world's first [[artificial satellite]], on 4 October 1957, came as a tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Now, suddenly, there was incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action in response to the [[Sputnik crisis]], officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend their relationship.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=199\u2013201}} At the suggestion of [[Harold Caccia, Baron Caccia|Harold Caccia]], the [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to the United States|British Ambassador to the United States]], Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=199}} as Macmillan put it, to meet the Soviet challenge on every front, \"military, economic and political\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1955-57v27/d306 |access-date=12 September 2017 |title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1955\u20131957, Western Europe and Canada, Volume XXVII \u2013 Document 306  |publisher=Office of the Historian, United States Department of State }}</ref>\n\nMacmillan flew to Washington, DC, for talks on 25 October.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} He had concerns that the disastrous 10 October [[Windscale fire]] might prove a stumbling block in negotiations,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} as it might reflect badly on British expertise and provide ammunition for opponents of closer co-operation with the UK.

Quarles]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense]], to consider how the deployment of IRBMs to Britain might be expedited.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} Another study group, under Strauss and Sir [[Edwin Plowden, Baron Plowden|Edwin Plowden]], the head of the UKAEA, would investigate nuclear co-operation and the exchange of nuclear information.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} The personal relationship developed between Plowden and Strauss would be crucial in converting the latter over to the idea of providing information to Britain.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}}\n\nBy December, most of the issues with the IRBM negotiations had been ironed out,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=442}} and a formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December, although it was not until the end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]] and not [[PGM-19|Jupiter]] missiles.{{sfn|Wynn|1997|p=287}} However, the nuclear submarine propulsion effort was running into trouble. Under the July 1956 agreement and a February 1957 directive from Eisenhower, [[Royal Navy]] officers had been assigned to study the US Navy's nuclear submarine programme. By October 1957, its head, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Hyman G. Rickover]], felt that their questions were slowing the deployment of the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarine-launched IRBM at a critical time. He feared that any delay might cause Congress to favour land-based missiles. By December, the British liaison officers were complaining of slow response to their questions. Rickover proposed that [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] be permitted to sell the Royal Navy a nuclear submarine reactor, which would allow it to immediately proceed with building its own nuclear-powered submarine. The British government endorsed this idea, as it would save it a great deal of money.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}}{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=441\u2013442}}\n\n===Amending the McMahon Act===\nFor their part, the British wanted the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear co-operation to be relaxed. They wanted to know the weight and dimensions, fusing and firing sequences, safety features, and in-flight procedures; the information that would allow American bombs to be carried in British [[V-bombers]], and American warheads to be fitted to British [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]] missiles.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} This would potentially save millions of pounds and avoid domestic political complications if Britain had to persist with nuclear testing during an international moratorium.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}} While the British knew what they wanted, there was no consensus among the Americans as to what they wanted to provide.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} The [[United States Secretary of State]], [[John Foster Dulles]], was concerned that a special relationship with Britain might complicate the United States' relationships with its other allies.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=439}} Strauss in particular felt that a proposal to give hydrogen bomb secrets to the British would likely not get past the JCAE, and counselled drafting amendments that were sufficiently vague as to give the president the authority he needed without arousing its ire.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} Eisenhower declared that the US and UK were \"interdependent\", and pledged to ask Congress to amend the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Moore|2010|p=33}}\n\nCrucially, he managed to secure the support of [[Carl T. Durham]], the chairman of the JCAE. Eisenhower met with congressional leaders on 3 December 1957, and pressed for more discretion to co-operate with all America's [[NATO]] allies, and not just Britain.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} Indeed the administration negotiated agreements with Australia, Canada and NATO.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} While Eisenhower did not yet have wholehearted support for the proposal, outright opposition from [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Clinton P. Anderson]] failed to attract much support.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} On 27 January 1958, Strauss sent Durham the administration's proposed legislative changes,{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} and the JCAE Subcommittee on Agreements for Cooperation, chaired by Senator [[John O. Pastore]], held hearings from 29 to 31 January. Quarles and [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Herbert Loper]], the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy Affairs, were forced to deal with pointed questions about [[nuclear proliferation]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=215\u2013219}} British information security, or the lack thereof, no longer seemed so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead, and the United Kingdom had independently developed the hydrogen bomb,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=224\u2013225}} but the JCAE objected to the terms of the proposed deal to trade British uranium-235 for American [[plutonium]], under which the US would pay [[United States dollar|USD]] $30 per gram for plutonium that cost USD $12 per gram to produce in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=224}}\n\nThe amendments were passed by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on 19 June, but not without changes. It now limited exchanges of nuclear weapons data to nations that had made substantial progress in the field. The same restriction applied to the actual transfer of non-nuclear components of nuclear weapons. American nuclear weapons were to remain under US custody and could only be turned over to allies in the event of war. The sale of nuclear reactors for submarines and nuclear fuel for them and other military reactors was permitted. Only Britain qualified as a nation that had made substantial progress.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=232\u2013233}} The bill passed Congress on 30 June 1958, and was signed into law by Eisenhower on 2 July 1958.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=234\u2013236}} The 1958 US\u2013UK Mutual Defence Agreement was signed by Dulles and [[Samuel Hood, 6th Viscount Hood|Samuel Hood]], the British Minister in Washington, DC, on 3 July,<ref name=\"full text\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/media/pdfs/56_4.pdf |title=Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defence Purposes |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |access-date=1 June 2017 }}</ref> and approved by Congress on 30 July.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=238}}\n\n==Implementation==\n===Details of the agreement===\n[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 080709-D-7203C-008.jpg|thumb|left|UK Defence Minister [[Des Browne]] (right) addresses a reception hosted by US Defense Secretary [[Robert M.

In return, the British provided the details of seven of theirs, including [[Yellow Sun (nuclear weapon)#Green Grass|Green Grass]]; Pennant, the boosted device which had been detonated in the Grapple Z test on 22 August; Flagpole, the two-stage device scheduled for 2 September; Burgee, scheduled for 23 September; and the three-stage Halliard 3. The Americans were impressed with the British designs, particularly with Halliard 1, the heavier version of Halliard 3. Cook therefore changed the Grapple Z programme to fire Halliard 1 instead of Halliard 3.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=202\u2013205}} Macmillan noted in his diary, with satisfaction that:{{quote|in some respects we are as far, and even further, advanced in the art than our American friends.
