He is known for his three-volume work ''Gnosis: Study and Commentaries on the Esoteric Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy''.<ref name=\"inner\">Smoley, Richard, ''Inner Christianity: A Guide to the Esoteric Tradition''. Boston: Shambhala, 2002, p.41.</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early years: Russia ===\nBoris Mouravieff was born in Kronstadt, Imperial Russia, on 8th March 1890. He was the second of Count Piotr Petrovitch Mouravieff's three sons. His father was an [[Admiral]] and [[Secretary of State]] to the [[Russian Imperial Navy]]. His ancestor's included General Prince [[Nikola\u00ef Mouraviev-Karsski | Nicolas Mouravieff -Karski]], [[Andre\u00ef Mouraviov]] (A. N. Mouravieff (author)), General Count [[Mikha\u00efl Mouraviov-Vilenski | Michel Mouravieff-Vilenski]] and General Count [[Nikola\u00ef Mouraviov-Amourski | Nicolas Mouravieff-Amourski]].\n\nA commissioned officer of the Imperial Russian Naval Academy Mouravieff rose through the ranks, in particular from 1909 to 1912 when he served aboard the [[Russian cruiser Aurora]]. Aurora won fame in 1917, giving the signal for the start of the [[February Revolution | Bolshevik Revolution]]. During the [[First World War]], he served in the [[Black Sea Fleet]]. Promoted to lieutenant commander in 1916, he commanded a flotilla of fast torpedo boats of which he had been the designer and the promoter.\n\nIn March 1917 at the age of 27, he was promoted to frigate captain, before being appointed Principal Private Secretary to [[Alexander Kerensky]] in the first provisional government, led by Prince [[Georgy Lvov]]. Following this he was appointed deputy chief of staff of the Black Sea fleet by Kerensky, who in turn became head of the Russian government until his overthrow by the Bolsheviks during the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. Shortly after the signing of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], in 1918, he left the military but remained in [[Crimea]] to devote himself to business interests, archaeological work as well as esoteric and historical research.\n\nAt the end of 1920, Mouravieff left Russia for [[Constantinople]] and in 1922 he moved again to [[Bulgaria]] until 1924.\n\nSince his youth, Mouravieff had been interested in the esoteric tradition of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Assisted by indications left by [[Andre\u00ef Mouraviov]] (A.N. Mouravieff), his great-uncle (who died in 1874) and a founder of the [[Skete of Saint Andrew]], one of the great Orthodox monasteries of [[Mount Athos]]. The latter had undertaken research in [[Egypt]], [[Armenia]], [[Kurdistan]] and even [[Persia]] to find traces of this tradition and manuscripts from the first centuries of our [[Common Era]].\n\n=== Exile ===\nWhile in Constantinople between 1920-21 Mouravieff attended public lectures given by [[P. D. Ouspensky]] and became acquainted with [[Gurdjieff]], whom he had contact with in later years both at [[Fontainebleau]] and in [[Paris]]. Mouravieff and Ouspensky became close friends and worked together either in Paris or London for many years most notably on the manuscript of [[In Search of the Miraculous]]. They met for the last time at Lyne Place Manor <ref> https://www.ouspenskytoday.org/wp/chronology/1931-1941-london-gadsden-lyne/lyne-place-house-and-history/</ref>, near London, in May 1937. Mouravieff detailed the nature of his relationship with both Ouspensky and Gurdjieff in an article published by [[Synthese]] in 1957 entitled Ouspensky, Gurdjieff and the Fragments of an Unknown Teaching <ref> Mouravieff, Boris (1997). Amis, Robin (ed) Ouspensky, Gurdjieff and Fragments of an Unknown Teaching, ISBN 1-872-292-224 </ref>.\n\n=== In France ===\nMouravieff arrived in [[France]] as a refugee in 1924. He lived first in Paris, then moved to [[Bordeaux]]. In 1935, while in Bordeaux he met Larissa Bassof-Volkoff, born in 1901 in [[Tashkent]], in [[Uzbekistan]], a ballerina. Larissa had a child from her first marriage, Boris Vsevolod Volkoff, born in 1928 in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine | Neuilly]]. Boris Mouravieff married her in 1936 and all three moved to Paris the same year.\n\nUp until 1941 Mouravieff worked as a consulting engineer for various oil companies, while devoting his free time to his historical research, as well as to the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy. Since 1921, Boris Mouravieff has pursued his research relating to the political and diplomatic history of Russia, and in particular to [[Peter I the Great | Pierre the Great]], which gave rise to a number of articles and books. <ref> Mouravieff, Boris.

The Russian Alliance in the Middle of the Napoleonic Wars, La Baconni\u00e8re, Collection \"The evolution of the World and Ideas\", Neuch\u00e2tel, 1954 </ref>.\n\nOn June 11, 1940, Boris Mouravieff left Paris for [[Carry-le-Rouet]] in the South of France, where the firm that employed him had relocated. He then moved to [[Aix-en-Provence]] until July 1943, and finally to [[Haute-Savoie]], [[Neuvecelle]], above [[Evian]]. Refusing to collaborate with the Germans, he was arrested in early 1944 by the [[Gestapo]], interned in [[Annemasse]], then released under surveillance <ref> http://www.association-boris-mouravieff.com </ref> <ref> Mouravieff, Larissa. Boris Mouravieff Biography, Geneva University Archive </ref>.\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nAt this point resistance fighters of the French Gendarmerie in the department organised his flight and that of his family on March 9, 1944 for [[Switzerland]]. Received as refugees, Boris and Larissa Mouravieff are first assigned to residence in a refugee camp in [[Randa]] in [[Valais]]. At the end of the war, they were allowed to settle in Geneva in an establishment called \"Home for intellectual refugees\", while waiting to occupy an apartment in town.\n\nBoris Mouravieff is 55 years old. He has to start from scratch again. His material situation is precarious: he hardly earns his living by means of lessons and industrial translations.\n\nAs early as April 1945, Boris Mouravieff applied for enrolment as a student at the [[Institute for Advanced International and Development Studies | Institute for Advanced International Studies]] in Geneva. In 1951, he graduated from this institute for his work: \"The Russian-Turkish Alliance in the Middle of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]\".\n\nAround the same time, his wife opened the \"Larissa Mouravieff Classical Dance School\", which she ran for a quarter of a century. At the beginning, Boris Mouravieff participated by accompanying the lessons, on the piano.\n\nDuring this period, he undertook work to formalize the esoteric Christian tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy. He initially planned to present this doctrine in romantic form (unfinished manuscript: \"Initiation - The life and dreams of Boris Kouratov\").\n\n=== Teaching ===\nIn April 1955, Boris Mouravieff becomes [[privat-docent]] at [[University of Geneva]] where he gives two courses until 1961, one concerning the history of Russia before 1917 and the other esoteric philosophy. This last course will be entitled precisely: \"Introduction to esoteric philosophy according to the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy\". It will regularly bring together between ten and thirty students. The introductory speech of the 1956 academic year on the theme of \"The Problem of the New Man\" will be published by the journal \"Syntheses\". Other articles will follow this first publication.\n\nThe teaching provided at the University of Geneva served as the basis for writing his master work, \"Gn\u00f4sis\", the first volume of which was published in April 1961 by the editions \"La Colombe\" in Paris. The mastery and the clarity of the presentation were recognized and the work obtained the following year the price of esoteric literature [[Victor-\u00c9mile Michelet]]. A rigorous and concrete spirit, Boris Mouravieff presents and comments, through this work, the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy in a language that is clear and accessible to a cultivated person of our time.\n\nThat same year, 1961, Boris Mouravieff created the Center for Esoteric Christian Studies (C.E.C.E.), based in Geneva, which he chaired and led until his death. The main goal assigned to the C.E.C.E. was to contribute to the formation of the New Man whom Boris Mouravieff wished for, in a critical historical period - ours - which he qualified as\n\"Transition period\", between a cycle which is ending and a new cycle, carrying promises as much as heavy dangers.\n\nFollowing the publication of volume I of '' Gn\u00f4sis '', Boris Mouravieff receives a voluminous correspondence. He does not just respond to people interested in the education disclosed in \"Gn\u00f4sis\": he encourages the creation of study groups that are emerging in Geneva, Paris, [[Lille]], [[Brussels] ], [[Cairo]], at {{lh | Congo}}, etc. These groups, formed under the aegis of the C.E.C.E., aimed to jointly deepen the doctrine set out in Gn\u00f4sis.\n\nIn 1962, Boris Mouravieff took leave of the University of Geneva to devote himself entirely to the activities of the Center and to the writing of the last two volumes of the trilogy of \"Gn\u00f4sis\". Volume II appeared in 1962, volume III in 1965.\n\nWithin the framework of the C.E.C.E., Boris Mouravieff sees his audience widened to multiple groups whose work he follows, personally responding to the collective or individual questioning of their members. Visits will support the activity of certain groups such as Paris, Lille or Brussels. In the same way, he made a trip to [[Greece]] in July 1964 (A translation of \"Gn\u00f4sis\" in Greek was made following this trip).\n\nTo inform the groups and coordinate their work, \"Information Bulletins\" are periodically published by the C.E.C.E. for members. The development of the activity of the C.E.C.E. was made possible thanks to a patronage which made it possible to have the necessary material means.\n\nThe last years of Boris Mouravieff's life are devoted to this teaching activity. In a perspective of clarification, deepening and practical application, he undertook the writing of a \u201cCollection of Notes on esoteric Christian teaching: The Stromata\u201d, in imitation of [[Clement of Alexandria] ]. With these Stromates, grouped under the general title of \"The Art of Winning\", Boris Mouravieff embarks on a vast and ambitious project. The aim was to supplement the teaching given in \"Gn\u00f4sis\" with practical elements answering the questions that the study of doctrine raised among students. The first chapter appeared in 1966. Two other chapters were published posthumously.\n\n=== Death ===\nThis intense activity has an impact on Boris Mouravieff's state of health. In March 1965, already, a heart attack imposed him a short rest in Cannes. In June 1966, he was struck down by a crisis of rheumatoid arthritis accompanied by severe pain which forced him to live in bed.\n\nBoris Mouravieff died in Geneva of a [[heart attack]] on September 28, 1966, at 8.15 p.m., at the age of 76. He rests at [[Geneva # Saint-Georges | Saint-Georges cemetery]], in Geneva <ref> At N \u00b0 2071, District 3, of the St-Georges Cemetery,\nPlateau de Saint-Georges - 1 avenue du Cimeti\u00e8re, 1213 Petit-Lancy (Geneva). </ref>.\n\nThe C.E.C.E. ceases operations shortly after the death of its founder.\n\n=== Posterity ===\nHis widow, Larissa Mouravieff published chapters 2 and 3 of the first \"Stromate\" in 1968 and 1970. She watches over the archives of the Center and, in 1988, has them deposited at the [[Library of Geneva | Public and University Library of Geneva]] before leaving for [[Canada]] to join her son. Larissa Mouravieff died in [[Montreal]] on September 26, 1989, leaving Boris Vsevolod Volkoff, sole heir of rights. When the latter died, in March 2012, the remaining archives were handed over to the Library of Geneva (BGE, department of manuscripts), where a Mouravieff collection had been set up, which could be consulted by researchers who request it.\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Political and Diplomatic History (in French)'''\n* ''L\u2019histoire de Russie mal connue'' (\u00e9puis\u00e9).\n* ''Le Testament de Pierre le Grand, l\u00e9gende et r\u00e9alit\u00e9'', \u00e0 la Baconni\u00e8re, Collection \u00ab L\u2019\u00e9volution du monde et des id\u00e9es \u00bb.

Volume II appeared in 1962, volume III in 1965.\n\nWithin the framework of the C.E.C.E., Boris Mouravieff sees his audience widened to multiple groups whose work he follows, personally responding to the collective or individual questioning of their members. Visits will support the activity of certain groups such as Paris, Lille or Brussels. In the same way, he made a trip to [[Greece]] in July 1964 (A translation of \"Gn\u00f4sis\" in Greek was made following this trip).\n\nTo inform the groups and coordinate their work, \"Information Bulletins\" are periodically published by the C.E.C.E. for members. The development of the activity of the C.E.C.E. was made possible thanks to a patronage which made it possible to have the necessary material means.\n\nThe last years of Boris Mouravieff's life are devoted to this teaching activity. In a perspective of clarification, deepening and practical application, he undertook the writing of a \u201cCollection of Notes on esoteric Christian teaching: The Stromata\u201d, in imitation of [[Clement of Alexandria] ]. With these Stromates, grouped under the general title of \"The Art of Winning\", Boris Mouravieff embarks on a vast and ambitious project. The aim was to supplement the teaching given in \"Gn\u00f4sis\" with practical elements answering the questions that the study of doctrine raised among students. The first chapter appeared in 1966. Two other chapters were published posthumously.\n\n=== Death ===\nThis intense activity has an impact on Boris Mouravieff's state of health. In March 1965, already, a heart attack imposed him a short rest in Cannes. In June 1966, he was struck down by a crisis of rheumatoid arthritis accompanied by severe pain which forced him to live in bed.\n\nBoris Mouravieff died in Geneva of a [[heart attack]] on September 28, 1966, at 8.15 p.m., at the age of 76. He rests at [[Geneva # Saint-Georges | Saint-Georges cemetery]], in Geneva <ref> At N \u00b0 2071, District 3, of the St-Georges Cemetery,\nPlateau de Saint-Georges - 1 avenue du Cimeti\u00e8re, 1213 Petit-Lancy (Geneva). </ref>.\n\nThe C.E.C.E. ceases operations shortly after the death of its founder.\n\n=== Posterity ===\nHis widow, Larissa Mouravieff published chapters 2 and 3 of the first \"Stromate\" in 1968 and 1970. She watches over the archives of the Center and, in 1988, has them deposited at the [[Library of Geneva | Public and University Library of Geneva]] before leaving for [[Canada]] to join her son. Larissa Mouravieff died in [[Montreal]] on September 26, 1989, leaving Boris Vsevolod Volkoff, sole heir of rights. When the latter died, in March 2012, the remaining archives were handed over to the Library of Geneva (BGE, department of manuscripts), where a Mouravieff collection had been set up, which could be consulted by researchers who request it.\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Political and Diplomatic History (in French)'''\n* ''L\u2019histoire de Russie mal connue'' (\u00e9puis\u00e9).\n* ''Le Testament de Pierre le Grand, l\u00e9gende et r\u00e9alit\u00e9'', \u00e0 la Baconni\u00e8re, Collection \u00ab L\u2019\u00e9volution du monde et des id\u00e9es \u00bb.

{"title_page": "Ahmad Sohrab", "text_new": "'''M\u00edrz\u00e1 A\u1e25mad Sohr\u00e1b''' (March 21, 1890 \u2013 April 20, 1958) was a [[Persian people|Persian]]-[[United States|American]] author and [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed]] who served as [[\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1]]'s secretary and interpreter from 1912 to 1919.  He co-founded the New History Society and the [[Caravan of East and West]] in [[New York City|New York]] and was [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] from the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in 1939 by [[Shoghi Effendi]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nBorn a [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed]] in [[Isfahan Province|Sedeh, Isfahan Province, Persia]] (now [[Iran]]), Sohrab's father \u02bbAbdu'l-Baghi was a descendant of [[Muhammad]].  \u02bbAbdu'l-Baghi was the chief dyer of the town.  Both sides of Sohrab's family, his mother and his father, claimed descent from the Imam Husayn, grandson of Muhammad.  His mother died when Sohrab was a few months old, while she herself was still a teenager, and he was taken to live with his maternal grandmother in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]].\n\n===New History Society===\n[[File:Belmont Lofts.JPG|thumb|Former residence of Ahmad Sohrab in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nBy 1911, he had founded an organization called the [[Persian-American Educational Society]].  Later that year he sailed to Europe \"in the interests of his work\".<ref>''[[The Washington Post]]'', November 13, 1911, p.4</ref> Sohrab was secretary and interpreter to [[\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1]] from 1912 to 1919.  He emigrated to the United States in 1919, sailing as a first class passenger from Port Said, Egypt to New York, on board the S/S ''Yeboshi Maru''. In the 1920s, while living in [[Los Angeles]], he helped write a scenario for a movie dealing with [[Mary Magdalene]], for the actress [[Valeska Surratt]].  In 1927 [[Cecil B. Demille]] released [[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]] which the duo claimed he had stolen from their scenario.  Suratt sued [[Cecil B. Demille]] and others in 1928, and mentioned that Sohrab had helped her write the play.<ref>''[[The New York Times]]'', February 28, 1928, p2</ref>  The case went to trial in 1930 and was quietly settled out of court.<ref>http://www.tribstar.com/history/local_story_073225216.html{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nHe found it necessary to go to New York to discuss business matters with Miss Surratt and it was through her that he was introduced to [[Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler]] and his wife [[Julie Chanler|Julie]].  Together they formed the \"New History Society\" in 1929 as an indirect way of spreading the teachings of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\n\nOn Mar 10, 1930, \"Mirza Ahmad Sohrab\" filed a petition for naturalization in the US District Court of New York City.  The petition states that he is 39 years old and residing at 28 W 50th Street.\n\n===Caravan of East and West===\nThe New History Society gave rise in 1930 to the [[Caravan of East and West]], and the Chanler's New York house was now called ''Caravan House''.  This foundation was designed to prepare children and youth to join the New History Society. This group had a quarterly magazine called ''The Caravan'', where Sohrab's partial autobiography first appeared.  (The autobiography appeared again in 1959, shortly after his death, with a few additional paragraphs which add little.)\n\n:\"The Caravan of East and West is an educational movement, the chief activity of which is international correspondence. It numbers 1,300 Chapters in 37 countries, with an aggregate membership of 100,000 children, young people and adults. Its publications, The Caravan and Pen Friends Guide, respectively appearing quarterly and monthly, keep the large circle of its readers informed as to the growth and influence of the movement.  The New History Society and the Caravan is a movement in itself for the spreading of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed ideals and principles, independent of and unaffiliated with the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed organization.\"<ref>[http://bahai-library.com/sohrab_ferm Bahai Library \"Ferm\"]</ref>\n\nSohrab had already published a few books, pamphlets and a movie scenario, when in 1933, with Julie Chanler he wrote a book that provided an overview of many of the events of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed movement; it contained a description of the events of the [[B\u00e1b]], [[Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h]] &mdash; his claim in the [[Garden of Ridv\u00e1n, Baghdad|Garden of Ridv\u00e1n]]&mdash; [[T\u00e1hirih]], and \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1.  The book also contains several pictures, including some which may be unique.\n\n===The Split===\nMrs. Chanler attempted to patch things up between Sohrab and [[Horace Holley (1887-1960)|Horace Holley]], \"one of the chief men in the American Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Administration\".<ref>[http://freebahais.com/white.htm Free Bahais \"White\"]</ref> But Sohrab refused to allow the New York [[Spiritual Assembly]], to have oversight of the affairs of the New History Society.  Since Holley sat on the National Spiritual Assembly at this time, this led to a confrontation which resulted in Sohrab and the Chanlers being expelled from the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community about 1939.\n\nSohrab's wife and daughter remained faithful to Shoghi Effendi and changed their names.<ref>[http://bci.org/bahaistudies/courses/shoghi.htm Bahai Studies \"Shoghi\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515041702/http://bci.org/bahaistudies/courses/shoghi.htm |date=May 15, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Lawsuit===\nIn 1941, Allen McDaniel and others, as members of the National Spiritual Assembly, filed suit against Sohrab to try to stop him from using the name Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed.  The NSA felt this created the impression that Sohrab was \"connected with and authorized to represent the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed religion...\"\n\nThis suit was filed in the Supreme Court of New York County.  The judge granted a motion to dismiss, stating that \"the plaintiffs have no right to a monopoly of the name of a religion.  The defendants, who purport to be members of the same religion, have an equal right to use the name of the religion...\"\n\nThe judge mentioned that the complaint could be further amended <ref>[http://bahai-library.com/sohrab_vs_us-nsa_1941 Bahai Library \"Sohrab Vs NSA\"]</ref> and the NSA appealed <ref>[http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/diglib/books/P-T/S/sohrab/BS247.gif H-Net \"Sohrab BS247\"]</ref> but the Appellate Court affirmed the decision of the lower court.\n\n===Collaboration with other opponents of Shoghi Effendi===\n\nAfter his excommunication, Sohrab joined forces with other people who opposed [[Shoghi Effendi]]. Part of this combination was a court case raised by Qamar Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed, Jalal the grandson of [[M\u00edrz\u00e1 M\u00fas\u00e1]] and others in about 1950-1, challenging Shoghi Effendi's right to carry out major construction work around the [[Shrine of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h]]. One of their key witnesses, Nayyir Afnan, died shortly before the case was due to open, and it all came to nothing. One of the culminations of this was a meeting that was held in [[Famagusta]] in the late 1950s. Representatives of all three main generations of what Baha'is call \"[[Covenant-breaker]]s\" were present including: Jalal Azal representing the followers of [[Subh-i-Azal|Mirza Yahya]], \u02bbIsmat and others represented the followers of [[M\u00edrz\u00e1 Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed]], and Ahmad Sohrab represented those opposed to any form of administration. One of the aims of this conference was to build a mausoleum over the grave of M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1. To this end, an amount of money was collected but it \"disappeared\" and nothing came of the project.<ref>[http://bahai-library.com/momen_cyprus_exiles Bahai Library \"Exiles\"]</ref>\n\n[[Moojan Momen]] notes that:\n:\"In theory, the second generation, who accepted Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, should have had nothing to do with the first generation followers of Azal, the enemy of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. Similarly, the third generation, accounting themselves loyal followers of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, should have had nothing to do with the second generation who were vehement opponents of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1; even less should they support the first generation. But in fact strong links formed between these generations.\"<ref>[http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant Bahai Library \"Momen\"]</ref>\n\n===Final years===\nCaravan eventually severed the links with the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, but Sohrab, Mrs. Chanler, and their organizations continued claim association with the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith as long as they both were living.\n\nThe Caravan existed for a time as a worldwide pen-pal club with social ideals.  In addition, there are various references to the Caravan Art Gallery at this same address.  There are also references in Mrs. Chanler's and Sohrab's writings to art showings.\n\nSohrab died April 20, 1958.<ref>''[[The New York Times]]'', April 22, 1958; p. 33 \"Obituary\"</ref> In his obituary he is described as \"leader of the Reform Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Movement in the United States and co-director of the [[Caravan of East and West]]\".\n\nThe New History Society is now defunct, not outliving Sohrab, however the Caravan of East and West persisted and currently operates at the same address as Caravan Institute, an adult-education Italian language school with no connection to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\n\n== Works ==\n*''The Song of the Caravan''.

The petition states that he is 39 years old and residing at 28 W 50th Street.\n\n===Caravan of East and West===\nThe New History Society gave rise in 1930 to the [[Caravan of East and West]], and the Chanler's New York house was now called ''Caravan House''.  This foundation was designed to prepare children and youth to join the New History Society. This group had a quarterly magazine called ''The Caravan'', where Sohrab's partial autobiography first appeared.  (The autobiography appeared again in 1959, shortly after his death, with a few additional paragraphs which add little.)\n\n:\"The Caravan of East and West is an educational movement, the chief activity of which is international correspondence. It numbers 1,300 Chapters in 37 countries, with an aggregate membership of 100,000 children, young people and adults. Its publications, The Caravan and Pen Friends Guide, respectively appearing quarterly and monthly, keep the large circle of its readers informed as to the growth and influence of the movement.  The New History Society and the Caravan is a movement in itself for the spreading of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed ideals and principles, independent of and unaffiliated with the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed organization.\"<ref>[http://bahai-library.com/sohrab_ferm Bahai Library \"Ferm\"]</ref>\n\nSohrab had already published a few books, pamphlets and a movie scenario, when in 1933, with Julie Chanler he wrote a book that provided an overview of many of the events of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed movement; it contained a description of the events of the [[B\u00e1b]], [[Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h]] &mdash; his claim in the [[Garden of Ridv\u00e1n, Baghdad|Garden of Ridv\u00e1n]]&mdash; [[T\u00e1hirih]], and \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1.  The book also contains several pictures, including some which may be unique.\n\n===The Split===\nMrs. Chanler attempted to patch things up between Sohrab and [[Horace Holley (1887-1960)|Horace Holley]], \"one of the chief men in the American Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Administration\".<ref>[http://freebahais.com/white.htm Free Bahais \"White\"]</ref> But Sohrab refused to allow the New York [[Spiritual Assembly]], to have oversight of the affairs of the New History Society.  Since Holley sat on the National Spiritual Assembly at this time, this led to a confrontation which resulted in Sohrab and the Chanlers being expelled from the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community about 1939.\n\nSohrab's wife and daughter remained faithful to Shoghi Effendi and changed their names.<ref>[http://bci.org/bahaistudies/courses/shoghi.htm Bahai Studies \"Shoghi\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515041702/http://bci.org/bahaistudies/courses/shoghi.htm |date=May 15, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Lawsuit===\nIn 1941, Allen McDaniel and others, as members of the National Spiritual Assembly, filed suit against Sohrab to try to stop him from using the name Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed.  The NSA felt this created the impression that Sohrab was \"connected with and authorized to represent the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed religion...\"\n\nThis suit was filed in the Supreme Court of New York County.  The judge granted a motion to dismiss, stating that \"the plaintiffs have no right to a monopoly of the name of a religion.  The defendants, who purport to be members of the same religion, have an equal right to use the name of the religion...\"\n\nThe judge mentioned that the complaint could be further amended <ref>[http://bahai-library.com/sohrab_vs_us-nsa_1941 Bahai Library \"Sohrab Vs NSA\"]</ref> and the NSA appealed <ref>[http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/diglib/books/P-T/S/sohrab/BS247.gif H-Net \"Sohrab BS247\"]</ref> but the Appellate Court affirmed the decision of the lower court.\n\n===Collaboration with other opponents of Shoghi Effendi===\n\nAfter his excommunication, Sohrab joined forces with other people who opposed [[Shoghi Effendi]]. Part of this combination was a court case raised by Qamar Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed, Jalal the grandson of [[M\u00edrz\u00e1 M\u00fas\u00e1]] and others in about 1950-1, challenging Shoghi Effendi's right to carry out major construction work around the [[Shrine of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h]]. One of their key witnesses, Nayyir Afnan, died shortly before the case was due to open, and it all came to nothing. One of the culminations of this was a meeting that was held in [[Famagusta]] in the late 1950s. Representatives of all three main generations of what Baha'is call \"[[Covenant-breaker]]s\" were present including: Jalal Azal representing the followers of [[Subh-i-Azal|Mirza Yahya]], \u02bbIsmat and others represented the followers of [[M\u00edrz\u00e1 Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed]], and Ahmad Sohrab represented those opposed to any form of administration. One of the aims of this conference was to build a mausoleum over the grave of M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1. To this end, an amount of money was collected but it \"disappeared\" and nothing came of the project.<ref>[http://bahai-library.com/momen_cyprus_exiles Bahai Library \"Exiles\"]</ref>\n\n[[Moojan Momen]] notes that:\n:\"In theory, the second generation, who accepted Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, should have had nothing to do with the first generation followers of Azal, the enemy of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. Similarly, the third generation, accounting themselves loyal followers of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, should have had nothing to do with the second generation who were vehement opponents of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1; even less should they support the first generation. But in fact strong links formed between these generations.\"<ref>[http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant Bahai Library \"Momen\"]</ref>\n\n===Final years===\nCaravan eventually severed the links with the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, but Sohrab, Mrs. Chanler, and their organizations continued claim association with the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith as long as they both were living.\n\nThe Caravan existed for a time as a worldwide pen-pal club with social ideals.  In addition, there are various references to the Caravan Art Gallery at this same address.  There are also references in Mrs. Chanler's and Sohrab's writings to art showings.\n\nSohrab died April 20, 1958.<ref>''[[The New York Times]]'', April 22, 1958; p. 33 \"Obituary\"</ref> In his obituary he is described as \"leader of the Reform Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Movement in the United States and co-director of the [[Caravan of East and West]]\".\n\nThe New History Society is now defunct, not outliving Sohrab, however the Caravan of East and West persisted and currently operates at the same address as Caravan Institute, an adult-education Italian language school with no connection to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\n\n== Works ==\n*''The Song of the Caravan''.

(See External Links below).</ref>\n\n==Character==\n\n=== Chip off the Old Block ===\nFaridi is the only son of Nawab Azeezuddin Khan.  His father is an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]], famous for his adventurous nature.  Faridi is often regarded as a copy of his father in looks and instincts.  [[Ibn-e-Safi|Safi]] had mentioned several of ''Nawab Sahab's'' friends who come in contact with Faridi.  Little detail is given on the rest of Faridi's family.\n\n===Rectitude of character===\nThe main attraction in his face is his eyes. He appears to be a sleepy, lazy, careless businessman (refer to ''Zameen Ke Badal'' \u2013 \u0632\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0628\u0627\u062f\u0644). However, those eyes are very deceiving. Behind them is the most alert mind of the century. Few people are able to talk to him while looking into his eyes.\n\nFaridi's character has a multitude of inspiring qualities. He's a man of principles. He believes in leading life by strict rules, controlled emotions, and objectivity. His abstinence from drugs, non-conjugal sex, and uncontrolled desires shows his strong character. He emotionally remains unmoved in respect to the fairer sex. Other strong traits include respect of law, nationalism, observation, common sense, and optimism. He is strong and powerful like a lion, but is as swift as lightning.\n\nBecause of his composed, impassive and subdued emotional nature, Hameed, his closest partner and assistant, dubs him as \"Father Hardstone\".\n\n===Matters of heart===\nColonel Hardstone was once seriously involved with Nawab Rasheeduz Zaman's daughter Ghazala.  The [[romantic love|romance]] did not last long.  Faridi never liked talking about his affair with Ghizala and always kept his emotions contained.  Soon, he realised that his life could not afford to have a strong emotion such as love, which could eventually become his greatest weakness in solving mysteries and catching culprits. The fact that he does not choose to fall in love with a member of the opposite sex does not mean that he cannot love or is not affected by it. Rajkumari Tara in ''Zahreela Admi'' (\u0632\u06c1\u0631\u06cc\u0644\u0627 \u0622\u062f\u0645\u06cc) was one of the unfortunate girls who lost her life for Faridi. The account of her devastating destruction left Faridi trembling and astounded.\n\n===Peculiar hobbies===\nFaridi is also unique in selecting hobbies.  His major interests include reading and [[domestication|domesticating]] dogs and snakes.  Science, specifically [[chemistry]] projects, is another diversion that he indulges in during his spare time. He seems to know several languages and is found reading books in different languages, including German.  Many breeds of dogs can be found in his enormous doghouse. He seems to possess some famous species of dogs, such as the African Yellow [[Dingo]], [[German Shepherd]], [[Greyhound]], [[Bloodhound]], etc.  He takes the same approach with pet snakes.  [[Black mamba]] and [[Indian cobra]] are some of the more dangerous kinds that he can handle with ease due to his training with the reptiles. One of the most distinguished arts that he has mastered is to incapacitate snakes by grabbing them by the tail and jolting them.\n\n===Residence===\nFaridi lives in a lavish [[mansion]] of gigantic proportion.  His residence encompasses a backyard of several acres.  Many rooms including bedrooms, living room, dining room, library, laboratory, museum, and servant quarters have been mentioned in his novels specifically. A front porch for parking and a huge garage for his cars is also part of the same residence. His mansion also has secret underground cellars.\n\n===Automobiles===\nFaridi drives models of several state-of-art auto brands of their time, namely [[Cadillac]], [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]], and Austin [[Mini]] (a British Leyland car). In addition to his regular means of conveyance, Faridi's garage carries several vehicles for different occasions.  For example, in ''Jungle Ki Aag'' (\u062c\u0646\u06af\u0644 \u06a9\u06cc \u0622\u06af), Faridi preps up a [[Jeep]] with machine guns and other arms.  On several occasions, he repaints one of his many [[Fiat]]s for concealment before going on a specific mission.  Faridi also owns a boat that was used once or twice to chase down criminals.\n\n===From Inspector to \"Colonel\"===\nThe title \"[[Colonel]]\" is honorary, much-awaited title that he reluctantly accepted after he caught a very contemptible character, Gerald Shastri, in ''Maut Ki Chataan'' (\u0645\u0648\u062a \u06a9\u06cc \u0686\u0679\u0627\u0646). Hameed also received his honorary \"Captain\" title at the same time. Faridi also possesses a \"special permission\" from the President to interfere in any matter that required his attention. Many of his colleagues and even senior officers envy him because of the endowments that he receives either by inheritance or by travail.\n\n===Wealth===\nColonel Faridi's wealth is \"inconceivable\".  The reader slowly realises Faridi's great wealth, an aspect of his character that makes him so mystical. From owning expensive vehicles, [[Ibn-e-Safi|Ibne-Safi]] eventually takes Faridi to a level that is just unprecedented \u2013 an owner of an independent state as referred in ''Zahreela Admi'' (\u0632\u06c1\u0631\u06cc\u0644\u0627 \u0622\u062f\u0645\u06cc) and ''Bechara/bechari'' (\u0628\u06cc\u0686\u0627\u0631\u06c1/\u0628\u06cc\u0686\u0627\u0631\u06cc).\n\n=== Black Force organisation ===\nFaridi is also the head of a secret crime-fighting organisation called the \"Black Force\".  As opposed to other superheroes, most members of his team know who their boss is. They usually refer to Faridi as Colonel Hardstone. On the other hand, members of Black Force usually hide their identity so much so that even Hameed gets irritated by it since he thinks he is the closest companion of \"Father Hardstone\".  Black Force is also an international organisation and its members are found all over the world. These members are usually recognised by code names such as B11, B2, etc.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n* [[Ibn-e-Safi]]\n* [[Jasoosi Dunya]]\n* [[Sajid Hameed]]\n* [[Faridi's Unofficial Aide]]\n* [[Villains of Jasoosi Dunya]]\n* [[Complete List of Jasoosi Dunya (Old)]]\n* [[Complete List of Jasoosi Dunya (New)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.compast.com/ibnesafi/faridi.htm The official Ibne-Safi website]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Faridi, Ahmad Kamal}}\n[[Category:Fictional secret agents and spies]]\n[[Category:Ibn-e-Safi]]\n[[Category:Jasoosi Dunya]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n\n{{Infobox character\n| name          = Ahmad Kamal Faridi \n| series        = [[Jasoosi Dunya]]\n| first         = March 1952 (''Dilaer Mujrim'')\n| last          = 17 July 1980 (''Sehra'ee Deewaanah-2'')\n| creator       = [[Ibn-e-Safi|Ibne-Safi]]\n| alias         = Colonel Hardstone, Colonel Faridi\n| nickname      = Father Hardstone\n| gender        = Male\n| occupation    = Detective\n| title         = Inspector (Crime Branch)\n| family        = Nawab Azizuddin Khan (Father)\n| religion      = [[Islam]]\n| nationality   = [[Indian people|Indian]]\n| lbl21         = Education\n| data21        = Masters in Criminology\n| lbl22         = School / University\n| data22        = [[Oxford University]]\n}}\n\n'''Ahmad Kamal Faridi''' ([[Urdu]]:  '''\u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u06a9\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0641\u0631\u06cc\u062f\u06cc''') (Inspector Faridi, later Colonel Faridi, also known as Colonel Hardstone) is a fictional spy and crime-fighter, created by [[Ibn-e-Safi]] as the lead character of the [[Urdu language|Urdu]] [[spy fiction|spy novel]] series ''[[Jasoosi Dunya]]'' (''The Spy World'').<ref>More details can be found in Faridi's portrait at official website of Mr. Ibne Safi.

His mansion also has secret underground cellars.\n\n===Automobiles===\nFaridi drives models of several state-of-art auto brands of their time, namely [[Cadillac]], [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]], and Austin [[Mini]] (a British Leyland car). In addition to his regular means of conveyance, Faridi's garage carries several vehicles for different occasions.  For example, in ''Jungle Ki Aag'' (\u062c\u0646\u06af\u0644 \u06a9\u06cc \u0622\u06af), Faridi preps up a [[Jeep]] with machine guns and other arms.  On several occasions, he repaints one of his many [[Fiat]]s for concealment before going on a specific mission.  Faridi also owns a boat that was used once or twice to chase down criminals.\n\n===From Inspector to \"Colonel\"===\nThe title \"[[Colonel]]\" is honorary, much-awaited title that he reluctantly accepted after he caught a very contemptible character, Gerald Shastri, in ''Maut Ki Chataan'' (\u0645\u0648\u062a \u06a9\u06cc \u0686\u0679\u0627\u0646). Hameed also received his honorary \"Captain\" title at the same time. Faridi also possesses a \"special permission\" from the President to interfere in any matter that required his attention. Many of his colleagues and even senior officers envy him because of the endowments that he receives either by inheritance or by travail.\n\n===Wealth===\nColonel Faridi's wealth is \"inconceivable\".  The reader slowly realises Faridi's great wealth, an aspect of his character that makes him so mystical. From owning expensive vehicles, [[Ibn-e-Safi|Ibne-Safi]] eventually takes Faridi to a level that is just unprecedented \u2013 an owner of an independent state as referred in ''Zahreela Admi'' (\u0632\u06c1\u0631\u06cc\u0644\u0627 \u0622\u062f\u0645\u06cc) and ''Bechara/bechari'' (\u0628\u06cc\u0686\u0627\u0631\u06c1/\u0628\u06cc\u0686\u0627\u0631\u06cc).\n\n=== Black Force organisation ===\nFaridi is also the head of a secret crime-fighting organisation called the \"Black Force\".  As opposed to other superheroes, most members of his team know who their boss is. They usually refer to Faridi as Colonel Hardstone. On the other hand, members of Black Force usually hide their identity so much so that even Hameed gets irritated by it since he thinks he is the closest companion of \"Father Hardstone\".  Black Force is also an international organisation and its members are found all over the world. These members are usually recognised by code names such as B11, B2, etc.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n* [[Ibn-e-Safi]]\n* [[Jasoosi Dunya]]\n* [[Sajid Hameed]]\n* [[Faridi's Unofficial Aide]]\n* [[Villains of Jasoosi Dunya]]\n* [[Complete List of Jasoosi Dunya (Old)]]\n* [[Complete List of Jasoosi Dunya (New)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.compast.com/ibnesafi/faridi.htm The official Ibne-Safi website]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Faridi, Ahmad Kamal}}\n[[Category:Fictional secret agents and spies]]\n[[Category:Ibn-e-Safi]]\n[[Category:Jasoosi Dunya]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Kamal_Faridi"}
