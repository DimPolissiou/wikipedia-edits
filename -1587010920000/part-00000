It runs north along the same road as [[Delaware Route 141]], then joins with [[Interstate 95 in Delaware|Interstate 95]] through Wilmington. North of the city, it exits the freeway onto Concord Pike, heading north; [[Delaware Route 202]] also continues south from this point. US&nbsp;202 continues north towards the state line as a six-lane [[arterial road]] and is lined with numerous strip malls and \"[[big-box stores]]\".\n\n===Pennsylvania===\n{{main|U.S. Route 202 in Pennsylvania}}\n[[File:US 202 NB shield between PA 463 and County Line Road.jpeg|thumb|right|US 202 parkway northbound in Montgomery Township, PA]]\nUS&nbsp;202 continues north toward [[West Chester, Pennsylvania|West Chester]], joining with [[U.S. Route 322|US&nbsp;322]] after intersecting [[U.S. Route 1]]. South of [[West Chester, Pennsylvania|West Chester]], US&nbsp;202/322 exits onto a limited-access bypass of the borough; that is the old West Chester By-Pass, and includes a grade-level intersection at Matlack Street. North of West Chester, US&nbsp;322 exits, and US&nbsp;202 continues north as a freeway towards [[Frazer, Pennsylvania|Frazer]], where it interchanges with [[U.S. Route 30]] and bends east to head towards [[Malvern, Pennsylvania|Malvern]] and [[King of Prussia, Pennsylvania|King of Prussia]]. The stretch between Mill Lane in Malvern to King of Prussia was recently widened to three lanes in each direction.  In King of Prussia, the highway forms a large, complicated interchange with the [[Schuylkill Expressway]], the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]], and [[U.S. Route 422]].\n\nThe freeway then transitions into a [[divided highway]], passing the [[King of Prussia (mall)|King of Prussia]] mall and heading northeast through commercial areas before splitting into a [[one-way pair]] through the streets of [[Bridgeport, Pennsylvania|Bridgeport]] and [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]], crossing the [[Schuylkill River]] in the process.\n\nNorth of Norristown, US&nbsp;202 continues as a two-lane road heading northeast through the Philadelphia suburbs, passing through [[Blue Bell, Pennsylvania|Blue Bell]] and [[Lower Gwynedd Township, Pennsylvania|Lower Gwynedd]], where it becomes a four-lane full-access highway for about two miles (3&nbsp;km). East of [[Lansdale, Pennsylvania|Lansdale]], in [[Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania|Montgomeryville]], it turns into a parkway with a [[US 202 Parkway Trail|parallel trail]], which opened in December 2012.<ref name=intell12312>{{cite news|first=Freda R.|last=Savana|title=It's official: The 202 parkway is open|work=[[The Intelligencer (Doylestown, Pennsylvania)|The Intelligencer]]|date=December 3, 2012|url=http://www.phillyburbs.com/my_town/doylestown/it-s-official-the-parkway-is-open/article_494036d4-0b7b-5e49-8ac6-b706709c40ac.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130131090403/http://www.phillyburbs.com/my_town/doylestown/it-s-official-the-parkway-is-open/article_494036d4-0b7b-5e49-8ac6-b706709c40ac.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 31, 2013|accessdate=December 3, 2012}}</ref> It continues northeast towards [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania|Doylestown]], where it joins an older section of bypass at [[Pennsylvania Route 611]] and proceeds north to the old alignment of Route 202 (State Street). It continues as a two-lane road to [[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope]], crossing the [[Delaware River]] on the [[New Hope-Lambertville Toll Bridge]].\n\n===New Jersey===\n{{main|U.S. Route 202 in New Jersey}}\nOn the toll bridge, US&nbsp;202 has two lanes in each direction. It continues a northeasterly course for about {{convert|5.7|mi|km}} as a [[freeway]]. This segment of US&nbsp;202 was earlier called the US&nbsp;202 bypass (as it bypassed the [[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope]]-[[Lambertville, New Jersey|Lambertville]] area) from its original route. The old section of US&nbsp;202 between New Hope and [[Ringoes, New Jersey]] is now [[New Jersey Route 179|Route&nbsp;179]] which is also [[Old York Road]], the first roadway to connect [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  In 1953, this section of Old York Road was renumbered US&nbsp;202.  A small section of the US&nbsp;202 bypass was built in 1965 and the old route was renamed Route&nbsp;179.  When the western section of the bypass was built to the Delaware River, the whole former segment was renamed Route&nbsp;179. The section of the new US&nbsp;202 freeway section ends once it begins to run concurrently with [[New Jersey Route 31|Route&nbsp;31]] in [[East Amwell Township, New Jersey|East Amwell Township]]. The concurrency runs for five miles (8&nbsp;km), to [[Flemington, New Jersey|Flemington]].  This stretch, and the 13 miles (21&nbsp;km) between Flemington and [[Somerville, New Jersey|Somerville]], is a four-lane divided roadway.\n\n[[Image:US202NYNJborder.jpg|thumb|US&nbsp;202 just inside New Jersey at the NY/NJ state line]]\nAt Somerville, the road merges with [[U.S. Route 206|US&nbsp;206]] at a now-reconfigured [[Somerville Circle]].  Parts of the old [[traffic circle]], which also carries [[New Jersey Route 28|Route&nbsp;28]], remain below the US&nbsp;202 [[Overpass|flyover]].  US&nbsp;202 splits northeastward from US&nbsp;206 at [[Bedminster Township, New Jersey|Bedminster Township]] and again becomes a two-lane road.\n\nFrom here to the state line, US&nbsp;202 parallels, and has largely been supplanted by, [[Interstate 287|I-287]], which during its construction dumped traffic onto US&nbsp;202. US&nbsp;202 continues through [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]] to [[Morris Plains, New Jersey|Morris Plains]] with an intersection with [[New Jersey Route 53|Route&nbsp;53]]. With a few exceptions, US&nbsp;202 is maintained by counties rather than the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] north of Route&nbsp;53.\n\nThe following sections are state-maintained:\n*At the [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|I-80]] interchange\n*At the [[U.S. Route 46|US&nbsp;46]] intersection\n*Along the [[New Jersey Route 23|Route&nbsp;23]] concurrency\n*At the [[Interstate 287|I-287]] interchange in [[Oakland, New Jersey|Oakland]]\n\nUS&nbsp;202 continues past [[Boonton, New Jersey|Boonton]] along the [[Boonton Turnpike]] to historic Mountain View in [[Wayne, New Jersey|Wayne]], where it then picks up Route&nbsp;23 for about two miles (3&nbsp;km) and then exits on Black Oak Ridge Road.  It then follows the [[Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike]], Terhune Drive on the east side of Pompton Lake (past the former homes of Cecille B. DeMille and Albert Payson Terhune), and Ramapo Valley Road (more or less paralleling the Ramapo River through Oakland) to [[Mahwah, New Jersey|Mahwah]] before crossing the New York state line on the [[Franklin Turnpike (New Jersey)|Franklin Turnpike]].\n\n[[Image:Bear Mtn Bridge.jpg|250px|thumb|View of the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]] from [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]]]]\n\n===New York===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Putnam County, New York]] -->\n{{main|U.S. Route 202 in New York}}\nUS&nbsp;202 is mostly designated east\u2013west in New York, owing to its greater coverage in those directions.\n\n[[Franklin Turnpike (New Jersey)|Franklin Turnpike]] becomes Orange Avenue in [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]], and US&nbsp;202 continues to a block-long [[wrong-way concurrency]] with [[New York State Route 59|NY 59]] before tailing off on Wayne Avenue and heading east toward [[Haverstraw, New York|Haverstraw]].  Most of this stretch is two-lane road.\n\nAt Haverstraw, US&nbsp;202 turns north along [[U.S. Route 9W|US&nbsp;9W]] to [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]] and then crosses the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]], running concurrently with [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|US&nbsp;6]], the Grand Army Of The Republic Highway. The two wind around [[Anthony's Nose (Westchester)|Anthony's Nose]], briefly forming New York's only three-way concurrency of U.S. highways with [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]] at [[Peekskill, New York|Peekskill]]. Afterwards, the two separate for several miles, with US&nbsp;202 taking the more southerly route through [[Somers, New York|Somers]]. The highways reunite at [[Brewster, New York|Brewster]] and become a four-lane road for their last few miles before the state line, taking in [[New York State Route 121|NY 121]] in the process.<ref>{{cite book| title=New York State Atlas and Gazetteer |author=DeLorme Mapping Company |publisher=DeLorme Mapping Company |year=1993 |isbn=0-89933-230-7 |pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Connecticut===\n{{main|U.S. Route 202 in Connecticut}}\nAt [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], US&nbsp;6 and 202 climb up onto [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]], which had just been joined by the north\u2013south [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|US&nbsp;7]], making a four-way concurrency.  US 7 and 202 split from I-84 and US&nbsp;6 at Exit 7. It is a two-lane road in southern [[Brookfield, Connecticut|Brookfield]] as it follows Federal Road. US 202 diverts from U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;7 at the next exit to a parallel surface route. The US&nbsp;7 freeway continues for another {{convert|8.5|mi|km}} before it rejoins US&nbsp;202 at the Brookfield/New Milford town line. The now rejoined US&nbsp;7 and 202 approach [[New Milford, Connecticut|New Milford]] in bucolic [[Litchfield County, Connecticut|Litchfield County]], where they once again split.\n\nUS&nbsp;202 continues through [[Torrington, Connecticut|Torrington]] and on to [[Cherry Brook, Connecticut|Cherry Brook]], where it then runs concurrently with [[U.S. Route 44 in Connecticut|US&nbsp;44]] for several miles before turning northward at [[Avon, Connecticut|Avon]].  For the run to the state line, US&nbsp;202 runs concurrently with [[Connecticut Route 10|Route 10]].\n\n===Massachusetts===\nUnlike elsewhere in New England, US&nbsp;202 is posted as a north\u2013south highway in Massachusetts, as the highway runs mostly in those directions for its length through the state.\n\nUS&nbsp;202 and [[Massachusetts Route 10|Route 10]] enter the Bay State at the \"[[Congamond, Massachusetts|Congamond]] Notch\" in [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick]], a southward jog in the state line that includes [[Congamond Lake]]. North of [[Westfield, Massachusetts|Westfield]], US&nbsp;202 turns eastward toward [[Holyoke, Massachusetts|Holyoke]], crosses the [[Joseph E. Muller Bridge]] and South Hadley Falls Interchange, traversing [[Massachusetts Route 116|MA 116]] and [[Massachusetts Route 33|MA 33]] toward [[Belchertown, Massachusetts|Belchertown]].  After crossing [[Massachusetts Route 9|MA 9]], it then heads north along the west side of the [[Quabbin Reservoir]] through [[New Salem, Massachusetts|New Salem]] toward [[Athol, Massachusetts|Athol]].  This section of US&nbsp;202 has been dubbed the [[Daniel Shays]] Highway, named for a Revolutionary War veteran who [[Shays' Rebellion|led an insurrection]] against the state government of Massachusetts. US&nbsp;202 meets [[Massachusetts Route 2]] at [[Orange, Massachusetts|Orange]], and runs along the [[two-lane freeway]] to [[Phillipston, Massachusetts|Phillipston]].  There, it diverges to the north again as a two-lane road.\n\nIn Massachusetts, US&nbsp;202 passes through the municipalities of [[Southwick, MA|Southwick]], [[Westfield, MA|Westfield]], [[Holyoke, MA|Holyoke]], [[South Hadley, MA|South Hadley]], [[Granby, MA|Granby]], [[Belchertown, MA|Belchertown]], [[Pelham, MA|Pelham]], [[Shutesbury, MA|Shutesbury]], [[New Salem, MA|New Salem]], [[Orange, MA|Orange]], [[Athol, MA|Athol]], [[Phillipston, MA|Phillipston]], [[Templeton, MA|Templeton]], and [[Winchendon, MA|Winchendon]].\n\nThe stretch of highway through Belchertown, Pelham, Shutesbury, and New Salem opened in 1935 to coincide with the completion and opening of the Quabbin Reservoir. The roadway reaches its closest point to the reservoir itself at the crossing of the Swift River, at the Shutesbury/New Salem town line. Access to the west side of the Quabbin Reservation is made through multiple gates in the three towns. There is no public access, however, to the Prescott Peninsula.\n\n===New Hampshire=== \n[[File:Centerline Rumble Strip.jpg|thumb|Section of US 202 in Henniker, NH]]\nUS&nbsp;202 is posted as an east\u2013west highway in New Hampshire. It remains a two-lane highway for most of its length in the Granite State.\n\nIt heads north, through [[Rindge, New Hampshire|Rindge]], [[Jaffrey, New Hampshire|Jaffrey]], and [[Peterborough, New Hampshire|Peterborough]], to [[Hillsborough, New Hampshire|Hillsborough]], where it turns eastward along a concurrency with [[New Hampshire Route 9]]. The span of the road between Hillsborough and [[Hopkinton, New Hampshire|Hopkinton]], which passes through [[Henniker, New Hampshire|Henniker]], is among the most deadly sections of roadway in the state.<ref>[http://www.cmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050605/REPOSITORY/506050432/1031 \"Crash takes two lives\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927214230/http://www.cmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050605%2FREPOSITORY%2F506050432%2F1031 |date=September 27, 2007 }}.

The freeway ends short of [[Chichester, New Hampshire|Chichester]], and NH 9 rejoins the two-lane concurrency along with US&nbsp;4 and 202.\n\nAt [[Northwood, New Hampshire|Northwood]], US&nbsp;202 and NH 9 leave US&nbsp;4.  NH 9 splits off a few miles later, leaving US&nbsp;202 to continue alone toward [[Rochester, New Hampshire|Rochester]], where the road jumps up onto the [[Spaulding Turnpike]] ([[New Hampshire Route 16|NH 16]]) for a short, non-tolled distance.  US&nbsp;202 leaves the turnpike two miles (3&nbsp;km) before the state line at [[East Rochester, New Hampshire|East Rochester]].\n\n===Maine===\n[[Image:NewEnglandConnectingFarm.png|thumb|[[Connected farm]] in [[Windham, Maine]], typical of older residences adjacent to Route 202 through rural [[New England]].]]\n\nUS&nbsp;202 is posted as an east\u2013west highway in Maine.\n\nThe highway enters the state by crossing the [[Salmon Falls River]] at [[Lebanon, Maine|South Lebanon]] and bridges the [[Mousam River]] in [[Sanford, Maine|Sanford]]. The highway then passes through [[Alfred, Maine|Alfred]], [[Waterboro, Maine|Waterboro]] and [[Hollis, Maine|Hollis]] before crossing the [[Saco River]] at [[Buxton, Maine|Salmon Falls]]. The highway passes through [[Gorham, Maine|Gorham]] and crosses the [[Presumpscot River]] into [[South Windham, Maine|South Windham]]. There is a rotary with [[U.S. Route 302]] at [[Windham, Maine|Foster's Corner]] and an interchange with [[Interstate 95 in Maine|I-95]] at [[Gray, Maine|Gray]]. The highway parallels I-95 through [[New Gloucester, Maine|New Gloucester]] to [[Auburn, Maine|Auburn]] and crosses the [[Androscoggin River]] into [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]], passing near the campus of [[Bates College]].<ref name=\"maine\">{{cite book| title=The Maine Atlas and Gazetteer |author=DeLorme Mapping Company |publisher=DeLorme Mapping Company |year=1988 |isbn=0-89933-035-5 |pages=}}</ref> A very short stretch through the latter two cities is four-lane highway, but most of its length in the Pine Tree State consists of two-lane road. Its final miles west of [[Hampden, Maine|Hampden]], including the short overlay on I-395, and concurrency with US&nbsp;1A also include four-laned segments.\n\nThe highway passes through [[Greene, Maine|Greene]], [[Monmouth, Maine|Monmouth]], and [[Winthrop, Maine|Winthrop]] concurrently with [[State Route 11 (Maine)|Maine Route 11]] and [[State Route 100 (Maine)|Maine Route 100]], and becomes concurrent with [[State Route 17 (Maine)|State Route 17]] at [[Manchester, Maine|Manchester]]. US&nbsp;202 runs concurrently with [[U.S. Route 201]] as it crosses the [[Kennebec River]] at [[Augusta, Maine|Augusta]], and shortly thereafter it picks up [[State Route 3 (Maine)|State Route 3]] and [[State Route 9 (Maine)|State Route 9]].  Maine 3 splits off at [[South China, Maine|South China]], but Maine 9 stays with US&nbsp;202 through [[Albion, Maine|Albion]], [[Unity, Maine|Unity]], [[Troy, Maine|Troy]], [[Dixmont, Maine|Dixmont]], [[Newburgh, Maine|Newburgh]], and [[Hampden, Maine|Hampden]] almost all the way to its terminus in [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]].<ref name=\"maine\"/> When Maine 9 turns right onto Summer Street in Bangor with US&nbsp;1A, US&nbsp;202 runs four more blocks to its eastern (or northern) terminus at the US&nbsp;2 intersection at the corner of Hammond, Main, Central and State Streets.\n\n==History==\n{{infobox road small\n|country=USA\n|type=US 1926\n|route=122\n|location=[[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington, DE]]\u2013[[Haverstraw, New York|Haverstraw, NY]]\n|length_mi=\n|length_ref=\n|length_round=\n|formed=1926\n|deleted=1934\n}}\n'''U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;122''' was created in 1926, connecting [[US 22 (NJ)|US&nbsp;22]] at [[Whitehouse Station, New Jersey]], with [[Wilmington, Delaware]].

That intersection is still seen as US 202's end.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usends.com/202.html|title=End of US highway 202|website=US Ends.com|language=en|access-date=August 26,

It runs north along the same road as [[Delaware Route 141]], then joins with [[Interstate 95 in Delaware|Interstate 95]] through Wilmington. North of the city, it exits the freeway onto Concord Pike, heading north; [[Delaware Route 202]] also continues south from this point. US&nbsp;202 continues north towards the state line as a six-lane [[arterial road]] and is lined with numerous strip malls and \"[[big-box stores]]\".\n\n===Pennsylvania===\n{{main|U.S. Route 202 in Pennsylvania}}\n[[File:US 202 NB shield between PA 463 and County Line Road.jpeg|thumb|right|US 202 parkway northbound in Montgomery Township, PA]]\nUS&nbsp;202 continues north toward [[West Chester, Pennsylvania|West Chester]], joining with [[U.S. Route 322|US&nbsp;322]] after intersecting [[U.S. Route 1]]. South of [[West Chester, Pennsylvania|West Chester]], US&nbsp;202/322 exits onto a limited-access bypass of the borough; that is the old West Chester By-Pass, and includes a grade-level intersection at Matlack Street. North of West Chester, US&nbsp;322 exits, and US&nbsp;202 continues north as a freeway towards [[Frazer, Pennsylvania|Frazer]], where it interchanges with [[U.S. Route 30]] and bends east to head towards [[Malvern, Pennsylvania|Malvern]] and [[King of Prussia, Pennsylvania|King of Prussia]]. The stretch between Mill Lane in Malvern to King of Prussia was recently widened to three lanes in each direction.  In King of Prussia, the highway forms a large, complicated interchange with the [[Schuylkill Expressway]], the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]], and [[U.S. Route 422]].\n\nThe freeway then transitions into a [[divided highway]], passing the [[King of Prussia (mall)|King of Prussia]] mall and heading northeast through commercial areas before splitting into a [[one-way pair]] through the streets of [[Bridgeport, Pennsylvania|Bridgeport]] and [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]], crossing the [[Schuylkill River]] in the process.\n\nNorth of Norristown, US&nbsp;202 continues as a two-lane road heading northeast through the Philadelphia suburbs, passing through [[Blue Bell, Pennsylvania|Blue Bell]] and [[Lower Gwynedd Township, Pennsylvania|Lower Gwynedd]], where it becomes a four-lane full-access highway for about two miles (3&nbsp;km). East of [[Lansdale, Pennsylvania|Lansdale]], in [[Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania|Montgomeryville]], it turns into a parkway with a [[US 202 Parkway Trail|parallel trail]], which opened in December 2012.<ref name=intell12312>{{cite news|first=Freda R.|last=Savana|title=It's official: The 202 parkway is open|work=[[The Intelligencer (Doylestown, Pennsylvania)|The Intelligencer]]|date=December 3, 2012|url=http://www.phillyburbs.com/my_town/doylestown/it-s-official-the-parkway-is-open/article_494036d4-0b7b-5e49-8ac6-b706709c40ac.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130131090403/http://www.phillyburbs.com/my_town/doylestown/it-s-official-the-parkway-is-open/article_494036d4-0b7b-5e49-8ac6-b706709c40ac.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 31, 2013|accessdate=December 3, 2012}}</ref> It continues northeast towards [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania|Doylestown]], where it joins an older section of bypass at [[Pennsylvania Route 611]] and proceeds north to the old alignment of Route 202 (State Street). It continues as a two-lane road to [[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope]], crossing the [[Delaware River]] on the [[New Hope-Lambertville Toll Bridge]].\n\n===New Jersey===\n{{main|U.S. Route 202 in New Jersey}}\nOn the toll bridge, US&nbsp;202 has two lanes in each direction. It continues a northeasterly course for about {{convert|5.7|mi|km}} as a [[freeway]]. This segment of US&nbsp;202 was earlier called the US&nbsp;202 bypass (as it bypassed the [[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope]]-[[Lambertville, New Jersey|Lambertville]] area) from its original route. The old section of US&nbsp;202 between New Hope and [[Ringoes, New Jersey]] is now [[New Jersey Route 179|Route&nbsp;179]] which is also [[Old York Road]], the first roadway to connect [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  In 1953, this section of Old York Road was renumbered US&nbsp;202.  A small section of the US&nbsp;202 bypass was built in 1965 and the old route was renamed Route&nbsp;179.  When the western section of the bypass was built to the Delaware River, the whole former segment was renamed Route&nbsp;179. The section of the new US&nbsp;202 freeway section ends once it begins to run concurrently with [[New Jersey Route 31|Route&nbsp;31]] in [[East Amwell Township, New Jersey|East Amwell Township]]. The concurrency runs for five miles (8&nbsp;km), to [[Flemington, New Jersey|Flemington]].  This stretch, and the 13 miles (21&nbsp;km) between Flemington and [[Somerville, New Jersey|Somerville]], is a four-lane divided roadway.\n\n[[Image:US202NYNJborder.jpg|thumb|US&nbsp;202 just inside New Jersey at the NY/NJ state line]]\nAt Somerville, the road merges with [[U.S. Route 206|US&nbsp;206]] at a now-reconfigured [[Somerville Circle]].  Parts of the old [[traffic circle]], which also carries [[New Jersey Route 28|Route&nbsp;28]], remain below the US&nbsp;202 [[Overpass|flyover]].  US&nbsp;202 splits northeastward from US&nbsp;206 at [[Bedminster Township, New Jersey|Bedminster Township]] and again becomes a two-lane road.\n\nFrom here to the state line, US&nbsp;202 parallels, and has largely been supplanted by, [[Interstate 287|I-287]], which during its construction dumped traffic onto US&nbsp;202. US&nbsp;202 continues through [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]] to [[Morris Plains, New Jersey|Morris Plains]] with an intersection with [[New Jersey Route 53|Route&nbsp;53]]. With a few exceptions, US&nbsp;202 is maintained by counties rather than the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] north of Route&nbsp;53.\n\nThe following sections are state-maintained:\n*At the [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|I-80]] interchange\n*At the [[U.S. Route 46|US&nbsp;46]] intersection\n*Along the [[New Jersey Route 23|Route&nbsp;23]] concurrency\n*At the [[Interstate 287|I-287]] interchange in [[Oakland, New Jersey|Oakland]]\n\nUS&nbsp;202 continues past [[Boonton, New Jersey|Boonton]] along the [[Boonton Turnpike]] to historic Mountain View in [[Wayne, New Jersey|Wayne]], where it then picks up Route&nbsp;23 for about two miles (3&nbsp;km) and then exits on Black Oak Ridge Road.  It then follows the [[Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike]], Terhune Drive on the east side of Pompton Lake (past the former homes of Cecille B. DeMille and Albert Payson Terhune), and Ramapo Valley Road (more or less paralleling the Ramapo River through Oakland) to [[Mahwah, New Jersey|Mahwah]] before crossing the New York state line on the [[Franklin Turnpike (New Jersey)|Franklin Turnpike]].\n\n[[Image:Bear Mtn Bridge.jpg|250px|thumb|View of the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]] from [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]]]]\n\n===New York===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Putnam County, New York]] -->\n{{main|U.S. Route 202 in New York}}\nUS&nbsp;202 is mostly designated east\u2013west in New York, owing to its greater coverage in those directions.\n\n[[Franklin Turnpike (New Jersey)|Franklin Turnpike]] becomes Orange Avenue in [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]], and US&nbsp;202 continues to a block-long [[wrong-way concurrency]] with [[New York State Route 59|NY 59]] before tailing off on Wayne Avenue and heading east toward [[Haverstraw, New York|Haverstraw]].  Most of this stretch is two-lane road.\n\nAt Haverstraw, US&nbsp;202 turns north along [[U.S. Route 9W|US&nbsp;9W]] to [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]] and then crosses the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]], running concurrently with [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|US&nbsp;6]], the Grand Army Of The Republic Highway. The two wind around [[Anthony's Nose (Westchester)|Anthony's Nose]], briefly forming New York's only three-way concurrency of U.S. highways with [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]] at [[Peekskill, New York|Peekskill]]. Afterwards, the two separate for several miles, with US&nbsp;202 taking the more southerly route through [[Somers, New York|Somers]]. The highways reunite at [[Brewster, New York|Brewster]] and become a four-lane road for their last few miles before the state line, taking in [[New York State Route 121|NY 121]] in the process.<ref>{{cite book| title=New York State Atlas and Gazetteer |author=DeLorme Mapping Company |publisher=DeLorme Mapping Company |year=1993 |isbn=0-89933-230-7 |pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Connecticut===\n{{main|U.S. Route 202 in Connecticut}}\nAt [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], US&nbsp;6 and 202 climb up onto [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]], which had just been joined by the north\u2013south [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|US&nbsp;7]], making a four-way concurrency.  US 7 and 202 split from I-84 and US&nbsp;6 at Exit 7. It is a two-lane road in southern [[Brookfield, Connecticut|Brookfield]] as it follows Federal Road. US 202 diverts from U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;7 at the next exit to a parallel surface route. The US&nbsp;7 freeway continues for another {{convert|8.5|mi|km}} before it rejoins US&nbsp;202 at the Brookfield/New Milford town line. The now rejoined US&nbsp;7 and 202 approach [[New Milford, Connecticut|New Milford]] in bucolic [[Litchfield County, Connecticut|Litchfield County]], where they once again split.\n\nUS&nbsp;202 continues through [[Torrington, Connecticut|Torrington]] and on to [[Cherry Brook, Connecticut|Cherry Brook]], where it then runs concurrently with [[U.S. Route 44 in Connecticut|US&nbsp;44]] for several miles before turning northward at [[Avon, Connecticut|Avon]].  For the run to the state line, US&nbsp;202 runs concurrently with [[Connecticut Route 10|Route 10]].\n\n===Massachusetts===\nUnlike elsewhere in New England, US&nbsp;202 is posted as a north\u2013south highway in Massachusetts, as the highway runs mostly in those directions for its length through the state.\n\nUS&nbsp;202 and [[Massachusetts Route 10|Route 10]] enter the Bay State at the \"[[Congamond, Massachusetts|Congamond]] Notch\" in [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick]], a southward jog in the state line that includes [[Congamond Lake]]. North of [[Westfield, Massachusetts|Westfield]], US&nbsp;202 turns eastward toward [[Holyoke, Massachusetts|Holyoke]], crosses the [[Joseph E. Muller Bridge]] and South Hadley Falls Interchange, traversing [[Massachusetts Route 116|MA 116]] and [[Massachusetts Route 33|MA 33]] toward [[Belchertown, Massachusetts|Belchertown]].  After crossing [[Massachusetts Route 9|MA 9]], it then heads north along the west side of the [[Quabbin Reservoir]] through [[New Salem, Massachusetts|New Salem]] toward [[Athol, Massachusetts|Athol]].  This section of US&nbsp;202 has been dubbed the [[Daniel Shays]] Highway, named for a Revolutionary War veteran who [[Shays' Rebellion|led an insurrection]] against the state government of Massachusetts. US&nbsp;202 meets [[Massachusetts Route 2]] at [[Orange, Massachusetts|Orange]], and runs along the [[two-lane freeway]] to [[Phillipston, Massachusetts|Phillipston]].  There, it diverges to the north again as a two-lane road.\n\nIn Massachusetts, US&nbsp;202 passes through the municipalities of [[Southwick, MA|Southwick]], [[Westfield, MA|Westfield]], [[Holyoke, MA|Holyoke]], [[South Hadley, MA|South Hadley]], [[Granby, MA|Granby]], [[Belchertown, MA|Belchertown]], [[Pelham, MA|Pelham]], [[Shutesbury, MA|Shutesbury]], [[New Salem, MA|New Salem]], [[Orange, MA|Orange]], [[Athol, MA|Athol]], [[Phillipston, MA|Phillipston]], [[Templeton, MA|Templeton]], and [[Winchendon, MA|Winchendon]].\n\nThe stretch of highway through Belchertown, Pelham, Shutesbury, and New Salem opened in 1935 to coincide with the completion and opening of the Quabbin Reservoir. The roadway reaches its closest point to the reservoir itself at the crossing of the Swift River, at the Shutesbury/New Salem town line. Access to the west side of the Quabbin Reservation is made through multiple gates in the three towns. There is no public access, however, to the Prescott Peninsula.\n\n===New Hampshire=== \n[[File:Centerline Rumble Strip.jpg|thumb|Section of US 202 in Henniker, NH]]\nUS&nbsp;202 is posted as an east\u2013west highway in New Hampshire. It remains a two-lane highway for most of its length in the Granite State.\n\nIt heads north, through [[Rindge, New Hampshire|Rindge]], [[Jaffrey, New Hampshire|Jaffrey]], and [[Peterborough, New Hampshire|Peterborough]], to [[Hillsborough, New Hampshire|Hillsborough]], where it turns eastward along a concurrency with [[New Hampshire Route 9]]. The span of the road between Hillsborough and [[Hopkinton, New Hampshire|Hopkinton]], which passes through [[Henniker, New Hampshire|Henniker]], is among the most deadly sections of roadway in the state.<ref>[http://www.cmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050605/REPOSITORY/506050432/1031 \"Crash takes two lives\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927214230/http://www.cmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050605%2FREPOSITORY%2F506050432%2F1031 |date=September 27, 2007 }}.

The freeway ends short of [[Chichester, New Hampshire|Chichester]], and NH 9 rejoins the two-lane concurrency along with US&nbsp;4 and 202.\n\nAt [[Northwood, New Hampshire|Northwood]], US&nbsp;202 and NH 9 leave US&nbsp;4.  NH 9 splits off a few miles later, leaving US&nbsp;202 to continue alone toward [[Rochester, New Hampshire|Rochester]], where the road jumps up onto the [[Spaulding Turnpike]] ([[New Hampshire Route 16|NH 16]]) for a short, non-tolled distance.  US&nbsp;202 leaves the turnpike two miles (3&nbsp;km) before the state line at [[East Rochester, New Hampshire|East Rochester]].\n\n===Maine===\n[[Image:NewEnglandConnectingFarm.png|thumb|[[Connected farm]] in [[Windham, Maine]], typical of older residences adjacent to Route 202 through rural [[New England]].]]\n\nUS&nbsp;202 is posted as an east\u2013west highway in Maine.\n\nThe highway enters the state by crossing the [[Salmon Falls River]] at [[Lebanon, Maine|South Lebanon]] and bridges the [[Mousam River]] in [[Sanford, Maine|Sanford]]. The highway then passes through [[Alfred, Maine|Alfred]], [[Waterboro, Maine|Waterboro]] and [[Hollis, Maine|Hollis]] before crossing the [[Saco River]] at [[Buxton, Maine|Salmon Falls]]. The highway passes through [[Gorham, Maine|Gorham]] and crosses the [[Presumpscot River]] into [[South Windham, Maine|South Windham]]. There is a rotary with [[U.S. Route 302]] at [[Windham, Maine|Foster's Corner]] and an interchange with [[Interstate 95 in Maine|I-95]] at [[Gray, Maine|Gray]]. The highway parallels I-95 through [[New Gloucester, Maine|New Gloucester]] to [[Auburn, Maine|Auburn]] and crosses the [[Androscoggin River]] into [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]], passing near the campus of [[Bates College]].<ref name=\"maine\">{{cite book| title=The Maine Atlas and Gazetteer |author=DeLorme Mapping Company |publisher=DeLorme Mapping Company |year=1988 |isbn=0-89933-035-5 |pages=}}</ref> A very short stretch through the latter two cities is four-lane highway, but most of its length in the Pine Tree State consists of two-lane road. Its final miles west of [[Hampden, Maine|Hampden]], including the short overlay on I-395, and concurrency with US&nbsp;1A also include four-laned segments.\n\nThe highway passes through [[Greene, Maine|Greene]], [[Monmouth, Maine|Monmouth]], and [[Winthrop, Maine|Winthrop]] concurrently with [[State Route 11 (Maine)|Maine Route 11]] and [[State Route 100 (Maine)|Maine Route 100]], and becomes concurrent with [[State Route 17 (Maine)|State Route 17]] at [[Manchester, Maine|Manchester]]. US&nbsp;202 runs concurrently with [[U.S. Route 201]] as it crosses the [[Kennebec River]] at [[Augusta, Maine|Augusta]], and shortly thereafter it picks up [[State Route 3 (Maine)|State Route 3]] and [[State Route 9 (Maine)|State Route 9]].  Maine 3 splits off at [[South China, Maine|South China]], but Maine 9 stays with US&nbsp;202 through [[Albion, Maine|Albion]], [[Unity, Maine|Unity]], [[Troy, Maine|Troy]], [[Dixmont, Maine|Dixmont]], [[Newburgh, Maine|Newburgh]], and [[Hampden, Maine|Hampden]] almost all the way to its terminus in [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]].<ref name=\"maine\"/> When Maine 9 turns right onto Summer Street in Bangor with US&nbsp;1A, US&nbsp;202 runs four more blocks to its eastern (or northern) terminus at the US&nbsp;2 intersection at the corner of Hammond, Main, Central and State Streets.\n\n==History==\n{{infobox road small\n|country=USA\n|type=US 1926\n|route=122\n|location=[[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington, DE]]\u2013[[Haverstraw, New York|Haverstraw, NY]]\n|length_mi=\n|length_ref=\n|length_round=\n|formed=1926\n|deleted=1934\n}}\n'''U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;122''' was created in 1926, connecting [[US 22 (NJ)|US&nbsp;22]] at [[Whitehouse Station, New Jersey]], with [[Wilmington, Delaware]].

The library holds over 1.8 million print and electronic items, including books, journals, newspapers, reports, conference proceedings, working papers, maps, Macquarie postgraduate theses, computer software, multimedia, microfilm, microfiche and additional non-print resources. New items are regularly added to ensure high quality resources are available for learning, teaching and research.\n\nThe library provides access to over 600 databases; 500,000 e-books; more than 69,000 electronic journals; books, printed resources and multimedia via MultiSearch.\n\n== The New Library ==\n\nThe new Library building was opened on 25 July 2011, and was assigned building number C3C. It provides a 21st-century learning and research environment that facilitates vital interactions between people and knowledge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mq.edu.au/about/campus-services-and-facilities/library/about-us/about-our-building|title=Macquarie University - Our building|last=|first=|date=|website=Macquarie University|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe new Library has over 2500 seats for group and individual study and more than 200 PCs for students. The library also provides study seats with desktop power for laptops, Macquarie network access, vending machines and has dedicated Postgraduates and Higher Degree Research study spaces with free lockers for Macquarie University Students.\n\nThe native park lands of the campus have inspired an innovative design, which aims to set impressive sustainability standards such as: \n* A green roof with grass and gardens\n* Natural light wells for lower floors\n* External shade fins\n* Zoned lighting\n* Use of recycled material in construction\n* An Automated Storage and Retrieval System\n\n== Automated Storage and Retrieval System ==\n\nMacquarie University Library was the first University in Australia to install an Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) in its Library. The ASRS consists of an environmentally controlled vault with metal bins storing the items. Robotic cranes retrieve an item on request and deliver the item to the service desk for collection. The retrieval process takes just a few minutes and helps increase the use of the print collection by making access more convenient.\n\nThis innovative technology was adapted from the automotive industry's application for warehousing and retrieving small components. It allows higher density storage resulting in a significantly smaller footprint and a more affordable project cost.

It is the largest academic library in Northern Sydney. The library holds over 1.8 million print and electronic items, including books, journals, newspapers, reports, conference proceedings, working papers, maps, Macquarie postgraduate theses, computer software, multimedia, microfilm, microfiche and additional non-print resources. New items are regularly added to ensure high quality resources are available for learning, teaching and research.\n\nThe library provides access to over 600 databases; 500,000 e-books; more than 69,000 electronic journals; books, printed resources and multimedia via MultiSearch.\n\n== The New Library ==\n\nThe new Library building was opened on 25 July 2011, and was assigned building number C3C. It provides a 21st-century learning and research environment that facilitates vital interactions between people and knowledge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mq.edu.au/about/campus-services-and-facilities/library/about-us/about-our-building|title=Macquarie University - Our building|last=|first=|date=|website=Macquarie University|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe new Library has over 2500 seats for group and individual study and more than 200 PCs for students. The library also provides study seats with desktop power for laptops, Macquarie network access, vending machines and has dedicated Postgraduates and Higher Degree Research study spaces with free lockers for Macquarie University Students.\n\nThe native park lands of the campus have inspired an innovative design, which aims to set impressive sustainability standards such as: \n* A green roof with grass and gardens\n* Natural light wells for lower floors\n* External shade fins\n* Zoned lighting\n* Use of recycled material in construction\n* An Automated Storage and Retrieval System\n\n== Automated Storage and Retrieval System ==\n\nMacquarie University Library was the first University in Australia to install an Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) in its Library. The ASRS consists of an environmentally controlled vault with metal bins storing the items. Robotic cranes retrieve an item on request and deliver the item to the service desk for collection. The retrieval process takes just a few minutes and helps increase the use of the print collection by making access more convenient.\n\nThis innovative technology was adapted from the automotive industry's application for warehousing and retrieving small components. It allows higher density storage resulting in a significantly smaller footprint and a more affordable project cost. Around 80% of the physical collection is stored in the ASRS and 20% on open access shelves.\n\n== Lachlan and Elizabeth Macquarie Room ==\n\nAnother special feature in the Library is the Lachlan and Elizabeth Macquarie Room, which provides a unique historical link between Macquarie University and its namesake, [[Lachlan Macquarie]], the fifth British governor of New South Wales.

Denise, the wife of the proprietor, tends to her chores while singing \"Chanson\": first in French, then English. She sees the same faces every day, but sometimes, things can happen that change you, making life different and new.\n\nFocus is shifted to the customers at the tables. Bits of conversation are heard: complaints from a gardener whose neighbor's tree is shading his spinach; an argument between the local priest and the school teacher who has been teaching that Joan of Arc \"thought\" she heard voices; the owner of a well quarrelling with the neighbor whose dog had breached that well seven years previously. The bickering villagers insist to one another that their lives would be much better \"If It Wasn't for You\". All are anticipating the arrival of the baker: the village has been without bread since the previous baker died, and tensions are running higher than normal.\n\nThe Marquis enters with his three \"nieces\" and welcomes the new baker, Aimable Castagnet. Accurately named, he is a jolly, middle-aged fellow. With him is his young and beautiful wife Genevi\u00e8ve, whom the Marquis mistakes for the baker's daughter. The error is quickly addressed, but does not go unremarked by the townspeople. With Pompom, their cat, the couple is shown to their new home\u2014with comments from the townsfolk, about the baker robbing the cradle, following in their wake.\n\nIn their new bakery, Aimable is clearly pleased with his new shop. To Genevi\u00e8ve, he sings \"Merci, Madame\", as enchanted with her as he is with his new surroundings. He is excited about the prospects of a prosperous life with a family. The villagers, too, are pleased with the return of \"Bread\" to the small town.\n\nThe customers argue about their place in line in the small shop, eager to sample the wares of the new baker.  Others gossip about the Marquis and his nieces; and Antoine, one of the villagers, asks Aimable how an old man like him was able to snare the beautiful Genevi\u00e8ve. \"God was good to me,\" he replies, and Genevi\u00e8ve reminds the villagers that not only did her husband choose her, she chose him, too\u2014and, she insists, she couldn't be happier.  She smiles at the customers but, embarrassed by their prying, rushes inside in tears.  She sings of the \"Gifts of Love\" she's received from men in her past: her passionate affair with a married man named Paul, and her gentler feelings for Aimable. Closing the door on her past, she resolves to be a good wife to the baker.\n\nWhile picking up the Marquis' pastry order, his driver, Dominique, eyes Genevi\u00e8ve, mistaking her for the baker's daughter, just as the Marquis himself did earlier. Genevi\u00e8ve corrects the handsome chauffeur, but he cockily insists on addressing her as Mademoiselle. Genevi\u00e8ve insists, \"Madame!\", but he continues flirting with her, flustering her. Aimable returns after trying to find Pompom and reports that the cat has run off.\n\nSome time later in the village square, Dominique again advances upon Genevi\u00e8ve. She rebuffs him, reminding him that she is happily married, but he resolves that he will be with his \"Proud Lady\".\n\nThe villagers gather again outside the caf\u00e9, engaged in their usual squabbles. The baker and his wife arrive and sit at a table near Antoine who continues to tease them about the difference in their ages. He implies that while the baker may be able to create the perfect croissant, his ability to create a child might have passed. Dominique comes to the couple's defense, hitting Antoine, but Genevieve is humiliated by the entire scene and exits in a huff. The men of the village slyly advise one another to \"Look For the Woman\" whenever conflict arises among them: \"It's when the hen walks into the barnyard that the roosters start pecking at each other.\"\n\nThat evening, we see three couples \u2014 including the baker and his wife \u2014 getting ready for bed. Dominique and his guitar-toting friend Philippe plot their evening in the town square, and as the three couples end their reprise of \"Chanson\", Dominique and Philippe start their \"Serenade\". The baker believes their song is a tribute offered in thanks for his baking, but Genevi\u00e8ve understands correctly that Dominique is singing to her. Aimable, ever the good man, sends Genevi\u00e8ve to give Dominique some unsold baguettes.  She castigates her insistent suitor, but Dominique is undeterred. Despite her protests, Genevi\u00e8ve is unable to resist him, and they decide to meet an hour later and run off together.\n\nAimable calls down to Genevi\u00e8ve, and she replies that she'll return to bed in a minute. As he drops off to sleep, she contemplates her situation, singing the legend of the \"Meadowlark\". In the story, the bird decides to stay with the old king who adored her\u2014and perishes of sadness, having missed her opportunity to fly away with the sun-god who had wooed her. Resisting the meadowlark's sad fate, Genevi\u00e8ve embarks for an unknown future with her \"beautiful young man\".\n\nThe neighbors are awakened to a fire in the bakery's oven, where the baker finds charred loaves. Usually Genevi\u00e8ve is the early riser of the household, and he begins to search for her, believing that she has gone in search for Pompom. A crowd begins to gather and the gossip begins at once, \"Buzz A-Buzz\": they know Aimable's search will yield neither cat nor wife.\n\nThe Marquis arrives and takes the baker aside, telling him that Genevi\u00e8ve had run off with his chauffeur in the Marquis' Peugeot. Philippe arrives and confirms the story, but Aimable chooses to believe that Genevi\u00e8ve has merely gone to visit her mother. As the gossip continues, the Marquis threatens to report his stolen car to the police, and to have the two lovers arrested. The gossiping townsfolk gleefully agree that the whole outrageous scandal is the \"best thing to happen in this town in all my life!\"\n\n===Act Two===\nThe second act opens as the first, with Denise reprising her \"Chanson\". The villagers reprise \"If It Wasn't for You\", while keeping an eye on the baker: they are relieved to see him begin a new batch of dough. The teacher and the priest argue again, the priest accusing the villagers of contaminating Genevieve with their immoral conduct, the teacher championing free will. The Marquis dismisses both explanations, insisting that Genevieve's behavior was simple human nature\u2014that we are all captive to the joys of the flesh.\n\nAimable crosses to the caf\u00e9 to inform the customers that the bread will be ready momentarily. The typically sober baker orders a cognac, and another, and sings tipsily that Genevieve will be home on an \"Any-Day-Now Day\": she has just gone to visit her mother. In an attempt to sober him up, the villagers follow him into the bakery, only to find it in a shambles. Aimable collapses amongst the spilled flour, dough hanging from the ceiling, and burnt loaves of bread.\n\nThe villagers realize that the town is in danger of being once again without a baker, and they blame the despondent baker's runaway wife for the sorry state of affairs. In the closed bakery, they try to cheer up Aimable and get him baking again by telling him that he's the \"Luckiest Man in the World\": he's been spared the boredom and arguments of married life.\n\nThe Marquis enters, telling Aimable that all he needs to cheer up is some \"Feminine Companionship,\" even offering to loan his \"nieces\". The villagers ask the Marquis if the girls are really his nieces, to which he responds, \"What is a niece but the daughter of a brother, and as I consider all men my brothers....\" The girls surround the baker, flirting and caressing him. The priest enters and, shocked at the scene, begins feuding with the Marquis.  The villagers join in the fray, and the baker throws them all out.\n\nAt a town meeting in the church, Aimable admits that he knows that Genevi\u00e8ve has run off. He offers the Marquis his life savings to deter him from hunting down the couple. He leaves the church, and the villagers\u2014chastened by the aging man's selflessness even in the face of profound anguish\u2014vow to work together to find Genevi\u00e8ve and persuade her to return to her husband.\n\nAlone in the bakery, Aimable decides \"If I Have to Live Alone\", that he will do so with dignity.\n\nThe villagers are again at the cafe, and Antoine enters claiming that he has found the young couple at a hotel in a nearby town.  They agree to form a search party, and the Marquis, the priest, and the teacher go after the outcasts to persuade the baker's wife to return home. Left behind, the women of the town comment ruefully on the \"Romance\" that is missing from their own lives.\n\nIn a small hotel room, Genevi\u00e8ve and Dominique are together, but all is not well. She admits her passion for the young man, but wonders \"Where Is the Warmth?\" She gathers her things and leaves him asleep.\n\nAt a bus stop, the villagers encounter Genevi\u00e8ve on her way to [[Marseille]]. They beg her to return but, guilt-stricken and ashamed, she tells them that she can never go home again. They eventually convince her to return: \"all sins are forgivable\".\n\nThe villagers are asked to remain in their houses so as to not embarrass Genevi\u00e8ve when she arrives. Escorted by the priest and the Marquis, Genevi\u00e8ve walks through the empty street to the bakery and cautiously approaches her door.\n\nShe finds Aimable and attempts to tell him the truth, but he awkwardly refuses to listen, offering her dinner and insisting that she has returned from visiting her mother. Pompom arrives at the window, and Aimable angrily chastises the cat for running after \"some tom that looked good in the moonlight.\" He unleashes all of his pent-up bitterness toward Genevi\u00e8ve on the small cat, but offers it a saucer of milk. He has faithfully refilled the milk each day, and when Aimable charges that the cat will run off yet again, a tearful Genevi\u00e8ve assures him that \"she will not leave\". Reconciled, the two begin to prepare the bread for the next day.\n\nDenise begins the new day at the caf\u00e9, reprising her \"Chanson\", joined by the town in harmony.\n\n==Songs==\nThis song list reflects the recording of the 1990 London production.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n* \"Chanson\" \u2013 Denise\n* \"If It Wasn't for You\" \u2013 Teacher, Priest, Marquis, and Villagers\n* \"Merci, Madame\" \u2013 Aimable and Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Bread \u2013 Villagers\n* \"Gifts of Love\" \u2013 Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Plain and Simple\" \u2013 Aimable and Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Proud Lady\" \u2013 Dominique\n* \"Look for the Woman\" \u2013 Teacher, Marquis, Claude, Barnab\u00e9, Antoine, Casimir, Pierre, Doumergue\n* \"Chanson (Reprise)\" \u2013 Denise\n* \"Serenade\" \u2013 Dominique, Philippe, Aimable, and Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"[[Meadowlark (song)|Meadowlark]]\" \u2013 Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Buzz A-Buzz\" \u2013 Aimable, Marquis, Philippe, Villagers\n{{col-break}}\n;Act II\n* \"Chanson (Reprise)\" \u2013 Denise\n* \"If It Wasn't for You\" \u2013 Priest, Teacher, Marquis, and Villagers\n* \"Any-Day-Now Day\" \u2013 Aimable, Villagers\n* \"Endless Delights\" \u2013 Dominique, Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Luckiest Man in the World\" \u2013 Claude, Village Men, Marquis, Simone, In\u00e8s, Nicole\n* \"Feminine Companionship\" \u2013 Claude, Village Men, Marquis, Simone, In\u00e8s, Nicole\n* \"If I Have to Live Alone\" \u2013 Aimable\n* \"Romance\" \u2013 Denise, Hortense, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, Simone, Inez, Nicole\n* \"Where is the Warmth?\" \u2013 Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Gifts of Love (Reprise)\" \u2013 Denise, Aimable, Genevi\u00e8ve, Villagers\n* \"Chanson (Reprise)\" \u2013 Denise, Aimable, Genevi\u00e8ve, Villagers\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Cast recordings==\nAlthough bootleg live recordings are known to exist, a full cast album of ''The Baker's Wife'' was never recorded at the time of its original tour in 1976. While the show was playing in Boston, it was seen by long-time theatre enthusiasts Bruce and Doris Yeko, who had only recently started up their own record label, [[Original Cast (record label)|''Take Home Tunes'']], devoted to the preservation of musical scores that might not otherwise be recorded.  Impressed by the score, the Yekos contacted Stephen Schwartz, who suggested to them that a full cast album might be recorded.<ref>Carol de Giere, ''Defying Gravity'', pp. 138-39.</ref> At that time, however, the couple had little experience in record production, having only released an EP of songs from ''[[The Robber Bridegroom (musical)|The Robber Bridegroom]]''. However, after ''The Baker's Wife'' closed on the road, the Yekos and Schwartz negotiated to record an LP of excerpts from the score, with the composer himself selecting what he considered to be the best songs (rather than those, necessarily, that might advance the plot).\n\nThe recording sessions took place in early 1977 in an apartment studio in Greenwich Village that was too small to accommodate an ensemble. As a result, Schwartz suggested that, to save both space and money, only the songs performed by the three protagonists would be recorded. Thus the resulting LP contained six solo numbers and five duets, performed by original cast members Paul Sorvino and Patti LuPone, along with Terri Ralston (who sang \"Chanson\").\n\nAt the same time, the Yekos produced and released an EP with additional songs performed by original cast member Sorvino along with [[Darlene Conley]], [[Denise Lor]], and [[Portia Nelson]] (who were not in the touring production) and composer/lyricist Stephen Schwartz and his wife, Carol.\n\nThis \"original cast\" LP of ''The Baker's Wife'' became very popular. It has since been re-released on CD twice: once in 1989 (the first CD to be released by Bruce Yeko's Original Cast label) and again in 1992.\n\nThe 1990 London production, directed by Trevor Nunn, was recorded and released on the JAY label as a lavish two-CD set.  This comprised 20 songs, of which 10 had been previously heard on the 1976 LP and one other from the studio cast EP. The remaining songs, not previously recorded, either came from the original tour, the 1985 off-Broadway revival, or had been specially written for the new London production.\n\nSince the late 1980s, songs from the show have also been recorded by solo artists. \"Meadowlark\" is by far the most frequently covered song, having been recorded by [[Sarah Brightman]], [[Betty Buckley]], [[Susan Egan]], [[Liz Callaway]], [[Sandy Campbell (singer)|Sandy Campbell]], [[Meredith Braun]], [[Dianne Pilkington]], [[Judy Kuhn]], [[Roslyn Kind]], [[Susannah Mars]] and others.\n\n==References==\n*De Giere, Carol.

Nearly a decade later [[Zero Mostel]] was named to take the lead.\n\nBy 1976 the rights had devolved to producer [[David Merrick]].

Denise, the wife of the proprietor, tends to her chores while singing \"Chanson\": first in French, then English. She sees the same faces every day, but sometimes, things can happen that change you, making life different and new.\n\nFocus is shifted to the customers at the tables. Bits of conversation are heard: complaints from a gardener whose neighbor's tree is shading his spinach; an argument between the local priest and the school teacher who has been teaching that Joan of Arc \"thought\" she heard voices; the owner of a well quarrelling with the neighbor whose dog had breached that well seven years previously. The bickering villagers insist to one another that their lives would be much better \"If It Wasn't for You\". All are anticipating the arrival of the baker: the village has been without bread since the previous baker died, and tensions are running higher than normal.\n\nThe Marquis enters with his three \"nieces\" and welcomes the new baker, Aimable Castagnet. Accurately named, he is a jolly, middle-aged fellow. With him is his young and beautiful wife Genevi\u00e8ve, whom the Marquis mistakes for the baker's daughter. The error is quickly addressed, but does not go unremarked by the townspeople. With Pompom, their cat, the couple is shown to their new home\u2014with comments from the townsfolk, about the baker robbing the cradle, following in their wake.\n\nIn their new bakery, Aimable is clearly pleased with his new shop. To Genevi\u00e8ve, he sings \"Merci, Madame\", as enchanted with her as he is with his new surroundings. He is excited about the prospects of a prosperous life with a family. The villagers, too, are pleased with the return of \"Bread\" to the small town.\n\nThe customers argue about their place in line in the small shop, eager to sample the wares of the new baker.  Others gossip about the Marquis and his nieces; and Antoine, one of the villagers, asks Aimable how an old man like him was able to snare the beautiful Genevi\u00e8ve. \"God was good to me,\" he replies, and Genevi\u00e8ve reminds the villagers that not only did her husband choose her, she chose him, too\u2014and, she insists, she couldn't be happier.  She smiles at the customers but, embarrassed by their prying, rushes inside in tears.  She sings of the \"Gifts of Love\" she's received from men in her past: her passionate affair with a married man named Paul, and her gentler feelings for Aimable. Closing the door on her past, she resolves to be a good wife to the baker.\n\nWhile picking up the Marquis' pastry order, his driver, Dominique, eyes Genevi\u00e8ve, mistaking her for the baker's daughter, just as the Marquis himself did earlier. Genevi\u00e8ve corrects the handsome chauffeur, but he cockily insists on addressing her as Mademoiselle. Genevi\u00e8ve insists, \"Madame!\", but he continues flirting with her, flustering her. Aimable returns after trying to find Pompom and reports that the cat has run off.\n\nSome time later in the village square, Dominique again advances upon Genevi\u00e8ve. She rebuffs him, reminding him that she is happily married, but he resolves that he will be with his \"Proud Lady\".\n\nThe villagers gather again outside the caf\u00e9, engaged in their usual squabbles. The baker and his wife arrive and sit at a table near Antoine who continues to tease them about the difference in their ages. He implies that while the baker may be able to create the perfect croissant, his ability to create a child might have passed. Dominique comes to the couple's defense, hitting Antoine, but Genevieve is humiliated by the entire scene and exits in a huff. The men of the village slyly advise one another to \"Look For the Woman\" whenever conflict arises among them: \"It's when the hen walks into the barnyard that the roosters start pecking at each other.\"\n\nThat evening, we see three couples \u2014 including the baker and his wife \u2014 getting ready for bed. Dominique and his guitar-toting friend Philippe plot their evening in the town square, and as the three couples end their reprise of \"Chanson\", Dominique and Philippe start their \"Serenade\". The baker believes their song is a tribute offered in thanks for his baking, but Genevi\u00e8ve understands correctly that Dominique is singing to her. Aimable, ever the good man, sends Genevi\u00e8ve to give Dominique some unsold baguettes.  She castigates her insistent suitor, but Dominique is undeterred. Despite her protests, Genevi\u00e8ve is unable to resist him, and they decide to meet an hour later and run off together.\n\nAimable calls down to Genevi\u00e8ve, and she replies that she'll return to bed in a minute. As he drops off to sleep, she contemplates her situation, singing the legend of the \"Meadowlark\". In the story, the bird decides to stay with the old king who adored her\u2014and perishes of sadness, having missed her opportunity to fly away with the sun-god who had wooed her. Resisting the meadowlark's sad fate, Genevi\u00e8ve embarks for an unknown future with her \"beautiful young man\".\n\nThe neighbors are awakened to a fire in the bakery's oven, where the baker finds charred loaves. Usually Genevi\u00e8ve is the early riser of the household, and he begins to search for her, believing that she has gone in search for Pompom. A crowd begins to gather and the gossip begins at once, \"Buzz A-Buzz\": they know Aimable's search will yield neither cat nor wife.\n\nThe Marquis arrives and takes the baker aside, telling him that Genevi\u00e8ve had run off with his chauffeur in the Marquis' Peugeot. Philippe arrives and confirms the story, but Aimable chooses to believe that Genevi\u00e8ve has merely gone to visit her mother. As the gossip continues, the Marquis threatens to report his stolen car to the police, and to have the two lovers arrested. The gossiping townsfolk gleefully agree that the whole outrageous scandal is the \"best thing to happen in this town in all my life!\"\n\n===Act Two===\nThe second act opens as the first, with Denise reprising her \"Chanson\". The villagers reprise \"If It Wasn't for You\", while keeping an eye on the baker: they are relieved to see him begin a new batch of dough. The teacher and the priest argue again, the priest accusing the villagers of contaminating Genevieve with their immoral conduct, the teacher championing free will. The Marquis dismisses both explanations, insisting that Genevieve's behavior was simple human nature\u2014that we are all captive to the joys of the flesh.\n\nAimable crosses to the caf\u00e9 to inform the customers that the bread will be ready momentarily. The typically sober baker orders a cognac, and another, and sings tipsily that Genevieve will be home on an \"Any-Day-Now Day\": she has just gone to visit her mother. In an attempt to sober him up, the villagers follow him into the bakery, only to find it in a shambles. Aimable collapses amongst the spilled flour, dough hanging from the ceiling, and burnt loaves of bread.\n\nThe villagers realize that the town is in danger of being once again without a baker, and they blame the despondent baker's runaway wife for the sorry state of affairs. In the closed bakery, they try to cheer up Aimable and get him baking again by telling him that he's the \"Luckiest Man in the World\": he's been spared the boredom and arguments of married life.\n\nThe Marquis enters, telling Aimable that all he needs to cheer up is some \"Feminine Companionship,\" even offering to loan his \"nieces\". The villagers ask the Marquis if the girls are really his nieces, to which he responds, \"What is a niece but the daughter of a brother, and as I consider all men my brothers....\" The girls surround the baker, flirting and caressing him. The priest enters and, shocked at the scene, begins feuding with the Marquis.  The villagers join in the fray, and the baker throws them all out.\n\nAt a town meeting in the church, Aimable admits that he knows that Genevi\u00e8ve has run off. He offers the Marquis his life savings to deter him from hunting down the couple. He leaves the church, and the villagers\u2014chastened by the aging man's selflessness even in the face of profound anguish\u2014vow to work together to find Genevi\u00e8ve and persuade her to return to her husband.\n\nAlone in the bakery, Aimable decides \"If I Have to Live Alone\", that he will do so with dignity.\n\nThe villagers are again at the cafe, and Antoine enters claiming that he has found the young couple at a hotel in a nearby town.  They agree to form a search party, and the Marquis, the priest, and the teacher go after the outcasts to persuade the baker's wife to return home. Left behind, the women of the town comment ruefully on the \"Romance\" that is missing from their own lives.\n\nIn a small hotel room, Genevi\u00e8ve and Dominique are together, but all is not well. She admits her passion for the young man, but wonders \"Where Is the Warmth?\" She gathers her things and leaves him asleep.\n\nAt a bus stop, the villagers encounter Genevi\u00e8ve on her way to [[Marseille]]. They beg her to return but, guilt-stricken and ashamed, she tells them that she can never go home again. They eventually convince her to return: \"all sins are forgivable\".\n\nThe villagers are asked to remain in their houses so as to not embarrass Genevi\u00e8ve when she arrives. Escorted by the priest and the Marquis, Genevi\u00e8ve walks through the empty street to the bakery and cautiously approaches her door.\n\nShe finds Aimable and attempts to tell him the truth, but he awkwardly refuses to listen, offering her dinner and insisting that she has returned from visiting her mother. Pompom arrives at the window, and Aimable angrily chastises the cat for running after \"some tom that looked good in the moonlight.\" He unleashes all of his pent-up bitterness toward Genevi\u00e8ve on the small cat, but offers it a saucer of milk. He has faithfully refilled the milk each day, and when Aimable charges that the cat will run off yet again, a tearful Genevi\u00e8ve assures him that \"she will not leave\". Reconciled, the two begin to prepare the bread for the next day.\n\nDenise begins the new day at the caf\u00e9, reprising her \"Chanson\", joined by the town in harmony.\n\n==Songs==\nThis song list reflects the recording of the 1990 London production.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n* \"Chanson\" \u2013 Denise\n* \"If It Wasn't for You\" \u2013 Teacher, Priest, Marquis, and Villagers\n* \"Merci, Madame\" \u2013 Aimable and Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Bread \u2013 Villagers\n* \"Gifts of Love\" \u2013 Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Plain and Simple\" \u2013 Aimable and Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Proud Lady\" \u2013 Dominique\n* \"Look for the Woman\" \u2013 Teacher, Marquis, Claude, Barnab\u00e9, Antoine, Casimir, Pierre, Doumergue\n* \"Chanson (Reprise)\" \u2013 Denise\n* \"Serenade\" \u2013 Dominique, Philippe, Aimable, and Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"[[Meadowlark (song)|Meadowlark]]\" \u2013 Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Buzz A-Buzz\" \u2013 Aimable, Marquis, Philippe, Villagers\n{{col-break}}\n;Act II\n* \"Chanson (Reprise)\" \u2013 Denise\n* \"If It Wasn't for You\" \u2013 Priest, Teacher, Marquis, and Villagers\n* \"Any-Day-Now Day\" \u2013 Aimable, Villagers\n* \"Endless Delights\" \u2013 Dominique, Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Luckiest Man in the World\" \u2013 Claude, Village Men, Marquis, Simone, In\u00e8s, Nicole\n* \"Feminine Companionship\" \u2013 Claude, Village Men, Marquis, Simone, In\u00e8s, Nicole\n* \"If I Have to Live Alone\" \u2013 Aimable\n* \"Romance\" \u2013 Denise, Hortense, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, Simone, Inez, Nicole\n* \"Where is the Warmth?\" \u2013 Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Gifts of Love (Reprise)\" \u2013 Denise, Aimable, Genevi\u00e8ve, Villagers\n* \"Chanson (Reprise)\" \u2013 Denise, Aimable, Genevi\u00e8ve, Villagers\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Cast recordings==\nAlthough bootleg live recordings are known to exist, a full cast album of ''The Baker's Wife'' was never recorded at the time of its original tour in 1976. While the show was playing in Boston, it was seen by long-time theatre enthusiasts Bruce and Doris Yeko, who had only recently started up their own record label, [[Original Cast (record label)|''Take Home Tunes'']], devoted to the preservation of musical scores that might not otherwise be recorded.  Impressed by the score, the Yekos contacted Stephen Schwartz, who suggested to them that a full cast album might be recorded.<ref>Carol de Giere, ''Defying Gravity'', pp. 138-39.</ref> At that time, however, the couple had little experience in record production, having only released an EP of songs from ''[[The Robber Bridegroom (musical)|The Robber Bridegroom]]''. However, after ''The Baker's Wife'' closed on the road, the Yekos and Schwartz negotiated to record an LP of excerpts from the score, with the composer himself selecting what he considered to be the best songs (rather than those, necessarily, that might advance the plot).\n\nThe recording sessions took place in early 1977 in an apartment studio in Greenwich Village that was too small to accommodate an ensemble. As a result, Schwartz suggested that, to save both space and money, only the songs performed by the three protagonists would be recorded. Thus the resulting LP contained six solo numbers and five duets, performed by original cast members Paul Sorvino and Patti LuPone, along with Terri Ralston (who sang \"Chanson\").\n\nAt the same time, the Yekos produced and released an EP with additional songs performed by original cast member Sorvino along with [[Darlene Conley]], [[Denise Lor]], and [[Portia Nelson]] (who were not in the touring production) and composer/lyricist Stephen Schwartz and his wife, Carol.\n\nThis \"original cast\" LP of ''The Baker's Wife'' became very popular. It has since been re-released on CD twice: once in 1989 (the first CD to be released by Bruce Yeko's Original Cast label) and again in 1992.\n\nThe 1990 London production, directed by Trevor Nunn, was recorded and released on the JAY label as a lavish two-CD set.  This comprised 20 songs, of which 10 had been previously heard on the 1976 LP and one other from the studio cast EP. The remaining songs, not previously recorded, either came from the original tour, the 1985 off-Broadway revival, or had been specially written for the new London production.\n\nSince the late 1980s, songs from the show have also been recorded by solo artists. \"Meadowlark\" is by far the most frequently covered song, having been recorded by [[Sarah Brightman]], [[Betty Buckley]], [[Susan Egan]], [[Liz Callaway]], [[Sandy Campbell (singer)|Sandy Campbell]], [[Meredith Braun]], [[Dianne Pilkington]], [[Judy Kuhn]], [[Roslyn Kind]], [[Susannah Mars]] and others.\n\n==References==\n*De Giere, Carol.

Each wrestler who lost to one of the two finalists moved into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.\n\nEach bout consisted of up to three rounds, lasting two minutes apiece. The wrestler who scored more points in each round was the winner of that rounds; the bout finished when one wrestler had won two rounds (and thus the match).\n\n==Schedule==\n<small>All times are
