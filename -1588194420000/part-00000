A 2006 memorandum by U.S. diplomat [[William Roebuck]] of the embassy in Damascus stated:<blockquote>We believe Bashar's weaknesses are in how he chooses to react to looming issues, both perceived and real, such as...the potential threat to the regime from the increasing presence of transiting Islamist extremists. This cable summarizes our assessment of these vulnerabilities and suggests that there may be actions, statements and signals that the [[United States Government|USG]] can send that will improve the likelihood of such opportunities arising. These proposals will need to be fleshed out and converted into real actions and we need to be ready to move quickly to take advantage of such opportunities.  Many of our suggestions underline using Public Diplomacy and more indirect means to send messages that influence the inner circle.</blockquote>According to [[Seymour Hersh]] and activist [[Robert Naiman (activist)|Robert Naiman]], Roebuck, who went on to be [[Charg\u00e9 d'affaires|charge d'affairs]] of the Libyan embassy under Obama, also considered the advantages of promoting religious sectarianism in Syria.<ref name=naiman91117/><ref name=hersh01117/>\n\nFollowing the start of the [[Arab Spring]] in 2011, [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War|protests]] in Syria against the Assad administration were violently suppressed and a civil war began.<ref name=\"ISW-2011-12\"/> By 2012 there were several armed opposition groups operating in the country, including the [[Free Syrian Army]], formed in July 2011 by officers who defected from the [[Syrian Armed Forces]]. In 2012, the [[al-Nusra Front]] was established by the [[Islamic State of Iraq]] as the official branch of ''al-Qaeda in Syria''. The al-Nusra Front was eclipsed by its own creator, and [[al-Qaeda]] severed its ties to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] in February 2014, after an eight-month power struggle.<ref name=\"Politico-2014-5-23\"/>\n\n=== Pre-coalition arming and training of the Syrian opposition ===\n{{Further|Timber Sycamore|CIA activities in Syria|Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War#United States}}\n\nAt the direction of U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) was put in charge of operations worth about $1 billion annually to arm anti-government forces in Syria,<ref name=\"covert\"/><ref name=\"trim\"/><ref name=\"syria-aid-fears\"/><ref name=\"larger\"/> an operation which formally began in 2013, more than two years after the start of the civil war in 2011.

Main article already included-->\nFollowing the abduction of a number of foreigners in Syria, on 4 July 2014, the U.S. carried out an operation to rescue foreign hostages being held by ISIL. U.S. airstrikes were conducted against an ISIL military base known as the \"Osama bin Laden Camp\" while at the same time, two dozen [[US special forces]] soldiers parachuted from helicopters near an ISIL-held building, thought to be for high-value prisoners. No prisoners were found in the building and the soldiers were quickly engaged by ISIL forces dispatched from [[Raqqa]], which started a three-hour firefight.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/> U.S. forces concluded that the hostages were no longer at the site and abandoned the rescue attempt. At least five ISIL fighters were killed and one U.S. soldier was wounded. Jordanian forces were also reportedly involved in the operation, with one Jordanian soldier reportedly wounded, but Jordanian involvement was not confirmed. Later on, it was reported that the hostages had been moved 24 hours before the attempted rescue.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/> Following the mission, it was still unclear whether the operation failed due to bad intelligence or whether ISIL forces were alerted in advance of the mission.<ref name=hennigan73334/>\n\nIn the aftermath of the rescue mission, and purportedly as a response to airstrikes in Iraq, ISIL beheaded three hostages over a one-month period: Americans [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]]<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/> and [[Steven Sotloff]] on 19 August and 2 September respectively,{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} and Briton [[David Cawthorne Haines|David Haines]] on 13 September.<ref name=botelho83334/>\n\n=== Surveillance flights over Syria ===\nOn 26 August 2014, the U.S. began sending [[Aerial reconnaissance|surveillance flights]], including [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]], over Syria to gather intelligence on ISIL targets. The flights began gathering intelligence that would aid future airstrikes even though airstrikes were not yet authorized at that point.<ref name=pace93334/> No approval was sought from the Assad government for flights entering Syrian airspace.<ref name=nissenbaum03334/>\n\n== U.S.-led coalition against ISIL ==\n{{main| Military intervention against ISIL#International coalitions against ISIS}}\nThe United States had since 2014 led efforts to establish a global coalition to counter ISIL.<ref name=eurparlcoal/>\n\nOn 5 September, 15 September<ref name=franceinthenews15556/> and 3 December 2014, various sets of countries came together to discuss concerted action against ISIL.

Officials stated it was a part of an initiative to get NATO allies to commit to a multinational observer force that would establish a \"safe zone\" in Rojava to keep the Kurds and Turks from clashing, to prevent pro-Syrian government forces from attacking the Kurds, and to keep up pressure to prevent an ISIL resurgence.

On 29 March, U.S. officials reportedly said the Pentagon's latest plans called for cutting its combat force in northeastern Syria roughly in half by early May 2019, or to about 1,000 troops, and would then pause pullout operations. The military would then reduce the number of forces every six months, depending on conditions on the ground, until it reaches the 400 troops previously approved by the president. Under this plan, the lowest troop numbers would not be reached until autumn 2020. The longer timetable would provide the U.S. more time to negotiate and work out details over the planned multinational safe zone along Turkey's border. Officials cautioned that the timetable was open-ended and still subject to change, with factors  ranging from allied troop contributions to new orders from the president himself.<ref name=nyt87645/>\n\nIn early May, video emerged online of U.S. forces firing upon an alleged Syrian government barge ferrying oil supplies in the Middle Euphrates River Valley.

A 2006 memorandum by U.S. diplomat [[William Roebuck]] of the embassy in Damascus stated:<blockquote>We believe Bashar's weaknesses are in how he chooses to react to looming issues, both perceived and real, such as...the potential threat to the regime from the increasing presence of transiting Islamist extremists.

These proposals will need to be fleshed out and converted into real actions and we need to be ready to move quickly to take advantage of such opportunities.  Many of our suggestions underline using Public Diplomacy and more indirect means to send messages that influence the inner circle.</blockquote>According to [[Seymour Hersh]] and activist [[Robert Naiman (activist)|Robert Naiman]], Roebuck, who went on to be [[Charg\u00e9 d'affaires|charge d'affairs]] of the Libyan embassy under Obama, also considered the advantages of promoting religious sectarianism in Syria.<ref name=naiman91117/><ref name=hersh01117/>\n\nFollowing the start of the [[Arab Spring]] in 2011, [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War|protests]] in Syria against the Assad administration were violently suppressed and a civil war began.<ref name=\"ISW-2011-12\"/> By 2012 there were several armed opposition groups operating in the country, including the [[Free Syrian Army]], formed in July 2011 by officers who defected from the [[Syrian Armed Forces]]. In 2012, the [[al-Nusra Front]] was established by the [[Islamic State of Iraq]] as the official branch of ''al-Qaeda in Syria''.

Main article already included-->\nFollowing the abduction of a number of foreigners in Syria, on 4 July 2014, the U.S. carried out an operation to rescue foreign hostages being held by ISIL. U.S. airstrikes were conducted against an ISIL military base known as the \"Osama bin Laden Camp\" while at the same time, two dozen [[US special forces]] soldiers parachuted from helicopters near an ISIL-held building, thought to be for high-value prisoners. No prisoners were found in the building and the soldiers were quickly engaged by ISIL forces dispatched from [[Raqqa]], which started a three-hour firefight.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/> U.S. forces concluded that the hostages were no longer at the site and abandoned the rescue attempt. At least five ISIL fighters were killed and one U.S. soldier was wounded. Jordanian forces were also reportedly involved in the operation, with one Jordanian soldier reportedly wounded, but Jordanian involvement was not confirmed. Later on, it was reported that the hostages had been moved 24 hours before the attempted rescue.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/> Following the mission, it was still unclear whether the operation failed due to bad intelligence or whether ISIL forces were alerted in advance of the mission.<ref name=hennigan73334/>\n\nIn the aftermath of the rescue mission, and purportedly as a response to airstrikes in Iraq, ISIL beheaded three hostages over a one-month period: Americans [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]]<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/> and [[Steven Sotloff]] on 19 August and 2 September respectively,{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} and Briton [[David Cawthorne Haines|David Haines]] on 13 September.<ref name=botelho83334/>\n\n=== Surveillance flights over Syria ===\nOn 26 August 2014, the U.S. began sending [[Aerial reconnaissance|surveillance flights]], including [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]], over Syria to gather intelligence on ISIL targets.

The peacekeeping deployment would be indefinite.<ref name=nbc67645/> The next day it was revealed the actual number was 400 troops, not 200, as half would be based in [[Rojava]] and half at al-Tanf. Officials stated it was a part of an initiative to get NATO allies to commit to a multinational observer force that would establish a \"safe zone\" in Rojava to keep the Kurds and Turks from clashing, to prevent pro-Syrian government forces from attacking the Kurds, and to keep up pressure to prevent an ISIL resurgence.

On 29 March, U.S. officials reportedly said the Pentagon's latest plans called for cutting its combat force in northeastern Syria roughly in half by early May 2019, or to about 1,000 troops, and would then pause pullout operations. The military would then reduce the number of forces every six months, depending on conditions on the ground, until it reaches the 400 troops previously approved by the president. Under this plan, the lowest troop numbers would not be reached until autumn 2020. The longer timetable would provide the U.S. more time to negotiate and work out details over the planned multinational safe zone along Turkey's border. Officials cautioned that the timetable was open-ended and still subject to change, with factors  ranging from allied troop contributions to new orders from the president himself.<ref name=nyt87645/>\n\nIn early May, video emerged online of U.S. forces firing upon an alleged Syrian government barge ferrying oil supplies in the Middle Euphrates River Valley.

Tools and technologies of spinning and weaving were similar to those of the Roman period; it is likely that fine, white wool continued to be produced from sheep introduced from the Mediterranean region alongside coarser local wools. Dyes included woad for blue and less frequently madder and lichens for reds and purples.

For example, since Continental industry relied on English wool, and export embargoes could 'bring whole areas to the brink of starvation and economic ruin', the wool trade was a powerful political tool. Likewise, [[Maltolt|taxes]] on the wool trade financed [[Edward I|Edward I's]] wars and enabled England to conduct the [[Hundred Years' War]] with better resources than France. These instabilities led to a boom-bust cycle in prices and exports.<ref>Adrian R. Bell, Chris Brooks, Paul R. Dryburgh, ''The English Wool Market, c.1230\u20131327'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 1.</ref>\n\nIn the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the English wool trade was primarily with Flanders (where wool was made into cloth, primarily for sale via the [[Champagne fairs]] into the Mediterranean basin), and was dominated by Flemish merchants. But in 1264, the strife in England of the [[Second Barons' War]] brought Anglo-Flemish trade almost to a halt and by 1275, when [[Edward I of England]] negotiated an agreement with the domestic merchant community (and secured a permanent duty on wool), Italian merchants had begun to gain dominance in the trade. Extending their activities to finance, the [[House of Simonetti#Simonetti of Lucca|Riccardi]], a group of bankers from [[Lucca]] in Italy, became particularly prominent in English taxation and finance.<ref>Emilia Jamroziak, 'Rievaulx Abbey as a Wool Producer in the Late Thirteenth Century: Cistercians, Sheep, and Debts', ''Northern History'', 40 (2003), 197\u2013218 (pp. 200\u20131).</ref> Among the most famous merchants participating in the English wool trade were [[Jean Boinebroke of Douai]] (d. 1286) on the Continental side,<ref>John H.

Tools and technologies of spinning and weaving were similar to those of the Roman period; it is likely that fine, white wool continued to be produced from sheep introduced from the Mediterranean region alongside coarser local wools. Dyes included woad for blue and less frequently madder and lichens for reds and purples.

For example, since Continental industry relied on English wool, and export embargoes could 'bring whole areas to the brink of starvation and economic ruin', the wool trade was a powerful political tool. Likewise, [[Maltolt|taxes]] on the wool trade financed [[Edward I|Edward I's]] wars and enabled England to conduct the [[Hundred Years' War]] with better resources than France. These instabilities led to a boom-bust cycle in prices and exports.<ref>Adrian R. Bell, Chris Brooks, Paul R.

But in 1264, the strife in England of the [[Second Barons' War]] brought Anglo-Flemish trade almost to a halt and by 1275, when [[Edward I of England]] negotiated an agreement with the domestic merchant community (and secured a permanent duty on wool), Italian merchants had begun to gain dominance in the trade. Extending their activities to finance, the [[House of Simonetti#Simonetti of Lucca|Riccardi]], a group of bankers from [[Lucca]] in Italy, became particularly prominent in English taxation and finance.<ref>Emilia Jamroziak, 'Rievaulx Abbey as a Wool Producer in the Late Thirteenth Century: Cistercians, Sheep, and Debts', ''Northern History'', 40 (2003), 197\u2013218 (pp. 200\u20131).</ref> Among the most famous merchants participating in the English wool trade were [[Jean Boinebroke of Douai]] (d. 1286) on the Continental side,<ref>John H.

There he began his long association with [[Pierre Boulez]], playing frequently in his [[Domaine musical]] concerts, which introduced many of the key works of the early twentieth-century to post-war Paris. At a single concert in 1954, which must have lasted close to five hours and also included works by [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and [[Edgard Var\u00e8se|Var\u00e8se]], Jacobs contributed chamber music by [[Alban Berg|Berg]], [[Anton Webern|Webern]] and [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] and gave the premi\u00e8re of a new work by [[Michel Philippot]].<ref>[[Antoine Gol\u00e9a]]: ''Rencontres avec Pierre Boulez'' (Paris: Editions Slatkine, 1982), 188, {{ISBN|2-05-000205-X}}</ref> In a 1958 Domaine concert he played a work written for him by the 21-year-old Richard Rodney Bennett, his ''Cycle 2 for Paul Jacobs''.<ref>J\u00e9sus Aguila: ''Le domaine musical - Pierre Boulez et vingt ans de cr\u00e9ation contemporaine'' (Paris: Fayard/Fondation SACEM, 1992), 290, {{ISBN|2-213-02952-0}}</ref>\n\nHe acted as rehearsal pianist for the incidental music which Boulez wrote for [[Jean-Louis Barrault]]'s production of the ''Oresteia'' in 1955.<ref>[[Dominique Jameux]]: ''Boulez'' (Paris: [[Fayard]]/Fondation SACEM, 1984), 108, {{ISBN|2-213-01077-3}}</ref> Jacobs later said that meeting Boulez had put an end to his own composing ambitions: 'I just gave it up.

For broadcasts he would be paid as little as $5, which went up to $25 when he played the premiere of the Henze Piano Concerto 'because of the special difficulty of the piece'. He lived in a hotel 'with a window facing a wall so that I had to go outside to see what the weather was.

He taught at [[Tanglewood Music Festival|Tanglewood]] and at the [[Mannes College The New School for Music|Mannes]] and [[Manhattan School of Music|Manhattan]] music schools in New York.

He was one of the four American pianists who commissioned Carter's large-scale solo piano work ''[[Night Fantasies]]'' (1978\u201380), the others being [[Charles Rosen]], [[Gilbert Kalish]] and [[Ursula Oppens]] (with whom Jacobs often performed two-piano works).<ref>John F.

Few who heard him play will ever forget the splashing brilliance of his runs, the glitter of his attacks, his aristocratic sense of rhythm and [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] ... I have never seen anyone play the piano with such feline grace and alertness.'<ref name=\"[[Gilbert Kalish]]: accompanying note to Jacobs' recording of the Debussy Etudes, Nonesuch 9 79161-2, CD\"/>\n\nOf his commitment to contemporary music, Jacobs himself said this: 'I feel absolutely perplexed at times why performers don't feel at home with the music of their own century. The music that hit me first when I was an adolescent was the music of the beginning of the century, all the way up through Stravinsky, even in his later years. It just doesn't pose any stylistic problems, it's as easy to speak as if you were reading the newspaper, I just know what to do with it.'<ref name=\"Michel Carton\"/>\n\nPerhaps the composer with whom he is now most closely associated is [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], most of whose major piano works he recorded, including the ''[[Pr\u00e9ludes (Debussy)|Pr\u00e9ludes]]'', ''[[\u00c9tudes (Debussy)|Etudes]]'', ''Images'' and ''[[Estampes]]''. His was one of the first recordings of Debussy's three 1894 ''Images'', which had only recently been published. Writing of a reissue of one of these recordings in 2002, the ''Gramophone'' commented: 'Hearing Paul Jacobs ... is a sharp and salutary reminder of a novel\u201a vigorous and superbly uncluttered view of Debussy ... one which stresses the composer\u2019s revolutionary fervour. The power and focus of these performances remain astonishing with opalescent mists and hazes burnt away to reveal a corruscating wit and vitality. There is absolutely nothing here of the decadent and lethargic man of popular imagination. Throughout\u201a Jacobs' commitment to every note of Debussy\u2019s phantasmagoric visions is total. All his recordings should be reissued.'<ref>''Gramophone'' magazine, August 2002</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n===Early recordings===\nJacobs began his recording career in Europe in the 1950s. One of his first records (in 1953) was of Beethoven's Second Piano Concerto with the Paris Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by [[Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz]], coupled with Leibowitz's own realisation of Beethoven's Piano Concerto in E flat major of 1784, written when Beethoven was 14 and of which only the piano part survives.<ref>Oceanic OCS 35, LP (1953); Disco Archivia 1007, CD</ref> In Paris in 1956 he gave the first complete cycle in a single concert of the [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] piano music, going on to record it for the V\u00e9ga label. He also acted as producer on recordings conducted by [[Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz]], including the first LP recording of [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s ''Gurrelieder''. He was the harpsichord soloist in the 1968 Columbia recording of the Carter ''Double Concerto'' with Charles Rosen (piano) and the English Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Frederick Prausnitz.<ref>Columbia MS 7191, LP</ref> and played on the 1970 CRI recording of Morton Feldman's ''The Viola in My Life''.<ref>New World Records, 80657-2, CD</ref>\n\n===Nonesuch LPs===\nHis reputation as a recording artist rests largely on a series of LPs he made for the American [[Nonesuch Records|Nonesuch]] label, for most of which he wrote a wide-ranging accompanying essay. Beginning in 1968 and 1973 with chamber and concertante works by Carter, from 1976 onwards he concentrated on the solo and duet repertoire. Most have remained available over the years thanks to CD reissues by Nonesuch and, later, by [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner]].

Few who heard him play will ever forget the splashing brilliance of his runs, the glitter of his attacks, his aristocratic sense of rhythm and [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] ... I have never seen anyone play the piano with such feline grace and alertness.'<ref name=\"[[Gilbert Kalish]]: accompanying note to Jacobs' recording of the Debussy Etudes, Nonesuch 9 79161-2, CD\"/>\n\nOf his commitment to contemporary music, Jacobs himself said this: 'I feel absolutely perplexed at times why performers don't feel at home with the music of their own century. The music that hit me first when I was an adolescent was the music of the beginning of the century, all the way up through Stravinsky, even in his later years. It just doesn't pose any stylistic problems, it's as easy to speak as if you were reading the newspaper, I just know what to do with it.'<ref name=\"Michel Carton\"/>\n\nPerhaps the composer with whom he is now most closely associated is [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], most of whose major piano works he recorded, including the ''[[Pr\u00e9ludes (Debussy)|Pr\u00e9ludes]]'', ''[[\u00c9tudes (Debussy)|Etudes]]'', ''Images'' and ''[[Estampes]]''. His was one of the first recordings of Debussy's three 1894 ''Images'', which had only recently been published. Writing of a reissue of one of these recordings in 2002, the ''Gramophone'' commented: 'Hearing Paul Jacobs ... is a sharp and salutary reminder of a novel\u201a vigorous and superbly uncluttered view of Debussy ... one which stresses the composer\u2019s revolutionary fervour. The power and focus of these performances remain astonishing with opalescent mists and hazes burnt away to reveal a corruscating wit and vitality. There is absolutely nothing here of the decadent and lethargic man of popular imagination. Throughout\u201a Jacobs' commitment to every note of Debussy\u2019s phantasmagoric visions is total. All his recordings should be reissued.'<ref>''Gramophone'' magazine, August 2002</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n\n===Early recordings===\n\nJacobs began his recording career in Europe in the 1950s. One of his first records (in 1953) was of Beethoven's Second Piano Concerto with the Paris Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by [[Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz]], coupled with Leibowitz's own realisation of Beethoven's Piano Concerto in E flat major of 1784, written when Beethoven was 14 and of which only the piano part survives.<ref>Oceanic OCS 35, LP (1953); Disco Archivia 1007, CD</ref> In Paris in 1956 he gave the first complete cycle in a single concert of the [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] piano music, going on to record it for the V\u00e9ga label. He also acted as producer on recordings conducted by [[Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz]], including the first LP recording of [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s ''Gurrelieder''. He was the harpsichord soloist in the 1968 Columbia recording of the Carter ''Double Concerto'' with Charles Rosen (piano) and the English Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Frederick Prausnitz.<ref>Columbia MS 7191, LP</ref> and played on the 1970 CRI recording of Morton Feldman's ''The Viola in My Life''.<ref>New World Records, 80657-2, CD</ref>\n\n===Nonesuch LPs===\n\nHis reputation as a recording artist rests largely on a series of LPs he made for the American [[Nonesuch Records|Nonesuch]] label, for most of which he wrote a wide-ranging accompanying essay. Beginning in 1968 and 1973 with chamber and concertante works by Carter, from 1976 onwards he concentrated on the solo and duet repertoire. Most have remained available over the years thanks to CD reissues by Nonesuch and, later, by [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner]]. The small American label [https://web.archive.org/web/20120911013330/http://www.arbiterrecords.com/catalog.html Arbiter] has also done much to keep Jacobs' recorded legacy before the public. In 2008 Arbiter released a two-CD set of the Stravinsky two piano / four-hand repertoire (with [[Ursula Oppens]]), coupled with some previously unpublished live recordings by Jacobs. They have also reissued his recordings of the piano music of [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]], whom Jacobs considered 'the great underrated master of the twentieth century'.<ref name=Sterne/>\n\nThe list of the Nonesuch LPs is in chronological order, with CD reissues under each entry.\n\n*'''[[Elliott Carter|Carter]]: Chamber Music'''\n**''Sonata for Flute, Oboe, Cello and Harpsichord'' (with Harvey Sollberger, flute; Charles Kuskin, oboe; [[Fred Sherry]], cello)\n**''Sonata for Cello and Piano'' (with Joel Krosnick, cello)\n**Recorded August 1968, Rutgers Presbyterian Church, New York, under the supervision of the composer\n**Nonesuch LP H-71234; published 1969\n**Reissued on CD with the Harpsichord Concerto (next) on Elektra Nonesuch CD, 9 79183-2, published 1992\n**Also included in ''Elliott Carter: A Nonesuch Retrospective'', 4-CD set, Nonesuch 7559-79922-1, published 2009\n*'''Carter: Harpsichord Concerto'''\n**''Double Concerto for Harpsichord and Piano with Two Chamber Orchestras''\n**Jacobs, harpsichord; [[Gilbert Kalish]], piano; The Contemporary Chamber Ensemble; Arthur Weisberg, conducting\n**Recorded September 1973\n**Nonesuch LP H-71314; published 1975\n**Reissued with the two chamber sonatas from Nonesuch LP H-71234 (previous) on Elektra Nonesuch CD, 9 79183-2, published 1992\n**Also included in ''Elliott Carter: A Nonesuch Retrospective'', 4-CD set, Nonesuch 7559-79922-1, published 2009\n*'''[[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]: Complete Piano Music'''\n**''Three piano pieces, Op. 11''\n**''Six little piano pieces, Op. 19''\n**''Piano pieces, Opp. 33a, 33b''\n**''Five piano pieces, Op. 23''\n**''Suite for piano, Op. 25''\n**Nonesuch LP H-71309, published 1975\n**Reissued on Nonesuch CD, 9 71309-2; Warner Apex CD, {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n*'''[[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]: Etudes'''\n**''Etudes for piano, Book I''\n**''Etudes for piano, Book II''\n**Recorded June 1975, Rutgers Presbyterian Church, New York\n**Nonesuch LP H-71322; published 1976\n**Reissued 1987 on Nonesuch CD, 9 79161-2, coupled with a live recording of Debussy's ''[[En blanc et noir]]'' (with [[Gilbert Kalish]]), Ojai Festival, California, 5 June 1982\n*'''Twentieth-century Piano Etudes'''\n**[[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]]: ''Three Etudes, Op. 18''\n**[[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]]: ''Six Polyphonic Etudes''\n**[[Olivier Messiaen|Messiaen]]: ''[[Quatre \u00e9tudes de rythme]]''\n**[[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]: ''Four Etudes, Op. 7''\n**Recorded April 26\u201328, 1976, New York\n** Nonesuch LP H-71334; published 1976\n**Included on Arbiter 2-CD set, arbiter 124\n*'''[[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]: Preludes'''\n**''Preludes for piano, Book I''\n**''Preludes for piano, Book II''\n**Nonesuch LP HB-73031, published 1978\n**Reissued on Nonesuch CD, 9 73031-2; Warner Ultima CD 79474\n*'''[[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]: Music for Two Pianos and Piano, Four Hands'''\n**(with [[Ursula Oppens]])\n**''Concerto per due pianoforti soli''\n**''Sonata for two pianos''\n**''Zvietotchnoy valse'' (for piano, 4 hands)\n**''Three easy pieces'' (for piano, 4 hands)\n**''Five easy pieces'' (for piano, 4 hands)\n**''Etude for pianola'' (performed on 2 pianos)\n**Recorded June 13\u201315, 1977, New York\n**Nonesuch LP H-71347; published 1978\n**Included on arbiter 155, a 2-CD set, which also includes previously unpublished concert recordings 1972-81\n*'''[[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]: Works for Piano, Four and Six Hands'''\n**''Sites auriculaires'' (with [[Gilbert Kalish]])\n**''Frontispice'' (with Gilbert Kalish and Teresa Sterne)\n**coupled with Ravel vocal and chamber works played by other artists\n**Nonesuch LP H-71355; published 1978\n**Reissued 1987 on Nonesuch CD, 9 71355-2\n*'''[[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]]: The Six Sonatinas for Piano'''\n**''Sonatina'' (1910)\n**''Sonatina seconda'' (1912)\n**''Sonatina ad usum infantis'' (1915)\n**''Sonatina in diem nativitatis MCMXVII'' (1917)\n**''Sonatina brevis.

It was named for [[William Alexander Aitken]], a fur trader for the [[American Fur Company]], under [[John Jacob Astor]]. Formed from [[Ramsey County, Minnesota|Ramsey]] and [[Pine County, Minnesota|Pine]] counties, Aiken County originally consisted of the 17 [[township (United States)|townships]] closest to [[Mille Lacs Lake]]. It acquired outlands of Ramsey, [[Itasca County, Minnesota|Itasca]] and Pine Counties to its north and east. It was organized in 1871, taking up lands from [[Cass County, Minnesota|Cass]] and Itasca Counties and losing a point in the southwestern corner to [[Crow Wing County, Minnesota|Crow Wing]] County to form its current boundaries.\n\n==Geography==\nThe [[Mississippi River]] flows southward through the west central part of the county.

The county was created in 1857 and organized in 1871.\n\n==History==\nAitkin County was established in 1857 as ''Aiken County''. The current spelling was adopted in 1872. It was named for [[William Alexander Aitken]], a fur trader for the [[American Fur Company]], under [[John Jacob Astor]]. Formed from [[Ramsey County, Minnesota|Ramsey]] and [[Pine County, Minnesota|Pine]] counties, Aiken County originally consisted of the 17 [[township (United States)|townships]] closest to [[Mille Lacs Lake]]. It acquired outlands of Ramsey, [[Itasca County, Minnesota|Itasca]] and Pine Counties to its north and east. It was organized in 1871, taking up lands from [[Cass County, Minnesota|Cass]] and Itasca Counties and losing a point in the southwestern corner to [[Crow Wing County, Minnesota|Crow Wing]] County to form its current boundaries.\n\n==Geography==\nThe [[Mississippi River]] flows southward through the west central part of the county. The county terrain consists of wooded rolling hills, dotted with lakes and ponds.<ref name=ACM>[https://www.google.com/maps/place/Aitkin+County,+MN/@46.5923345,-93.7132545,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x52b106186a668827:0x9821a013a83d46f4!8m2!3d46.6185433!4d-93.4536692 ''Aitkin County MN''  Google Maps (accessed 4 March 2019)]</ref> The terrain slopes to the south; its highest point is Quadna Mountain, 2.5 miles (4.0&nbsp;km) south-southeast of [[Hill City, Minnesota]], at 1,591' (485m) ASL.<ref>[https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=6446 Quadna Mountain MN.

Groves High School''' or '''Groves''') is a [[high school]] in [[Beverly Hills, Michigan]], United States, in the [[Birmingham City School District|Birmingham Public School District]].  Groves' colors are green, white, and yellow and its mascot is Freddy the Falcon. The current principal is Dr. Embekka Roberson, and the assistant principals are Othamian Peterson, Delois Spryszak, and Darin Wilcox, and the athletic director is Tom Flynn.\n\nThe [[French School of Detroit]] holds its high school classes at Groves High School.<ref>\"[http://www.frenchschoolofdetroit.org/curriculum/high-school The High School].\" [[French School of Detroit]]. Retrieved on June 20, 2015. \"Location: Groves High School, 20500 13 mile Road, Beverly, MI 48025.\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Name ===\nIn 1951, a new high school in Birmingham opened under the name Birmingham High School (which is now known as Seaholm High School). At the time, the president of the Board of Education was Ernest W. Seaholm and the treasurer was Wylie E. Groves. When Birmingham had to build another school to accommodate the incoming baby boomers, these men's names would become the source of the modern names of Birmingham's two main high schools: Seaholm High School and Groves High School.\n\n=== Building history ===\nCompleted in 1959, the building was an example of the International Style applied to ordinary school design, resulting in a modernistic exterior look similar to much subsequent school construction. The building's original architectural \"signature\" was a scalloped circular white roof over the circular library; now painted black, it is visible but no longer prominent. The building has a grid-like floor plan, with three main hallways intersected by six shorter ones. Liberal use was made of glass walls and interior courtyards, with energy costs not yet a major concern in 1959. Since the school's opening, the building has undergone periodic renovations, the most extensive occurring from 1999\u20132001 when the school was completely remodeled. The school features state of the art technology, including seven computer labs (including one for modern languages) and a large media center; state of the art science labs for biology, chemistry, physics, CAD, and robotics; a little theatre that seats approximately 300; an auditorium that seats approximately 1200; art studios for drawing, photography, jewelry, ceramics, and graphic design; a TV studio; and a large, open commons area where students gather for lunch, dances, and other activities. In 2005, construction began to renovate the athletic wing of the school, as well as to build a new competitive size swimming pool. The former swimming pool has been converted into classrooms, a fitness center, and a dance studio. The school was one of the first schools in Michigan to use artificial \"[[FieldTurf]]\" for its football/soccer field. In 2017, there was renovations of the auditorium and construction of a scene shop addition.\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe school opened in the fall of 1959 with 1,052 students in grades seven through ten. Intended eventually to be Birmingham's second high school, it was named after a local civic leader and school board member. In the first year, students selected the school colors (green and white), team nickname (Falcons), fight song (\"Rise Up, All Falcons,\" music and lyrics composed by Mr. Burton Bronson, Groves Band Director), names of the yearbook (\"Talon\") and newspaper (\"Scriptor\"), etc. The original tenth graders became the first class of graduating seniors in 1962. For a brief period the school was a junior and senior high school, and the classes of 1965, 1966 and 1967 spent grades seven through twelve there. Beginning with the 1963-64 school year, grades seven and eight were moved from Groves to Berkshire Middle School, which today serves grades six through eight in the Birmingham City School District.  The lower grades were eliminated as new junior high schools were built. This pattern enabled the school district to accommodate, with phased construction, the demographic wave of babyboomers emerging from elementary schools in the late 1950s and 1960s.\n\n== Academics ==\nThe school offers numerous Honors and Advanced Placement courses for students to elect. Advanced Placement is offered for Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, Computer Science, Economics, English Language, English Literature, Environmental Science, European History, French, Music Theory, Psychology, Spanish, Statistics, US History, and US Government. The school has a variety of academic elective options for students who do not wish to take Honors or AP courses. The school also offers many courses in journalism, with the newspaper- \"The Scriptor\", the yearbook- \"The Talon\", and the television production- \"The Fann (Falcon Action News Network)\"\n\n== Athletics and activities ==\nThe school offers over thirty varsity sports for both men and women.  Most sports are broken down into varsity, junior varsity, and freshmen teams. Groves is a member of the Oakland Activities Association and has won league championships in nearly every sport since the league's inception in 1994. Groves also offers a variety of activities for students to participate in, including instrumental music (both band and orchestra), forensics team, eco club, interact club, fashion club, Amnesty and Animal Rights club, Gay-Straight Alliance club, Japanese club, Spanish club, French club, debate team, theatre, quiz bowl, bowling club, photography club, and the National Honor Society. Both the forensics and debate teams have enjoyed success in recent years. The forensics team finished second in the state in 2007, while the debate team finished first in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010.\n\nGroves Student Congress (GSC) is responsible for planning school-wide activities and events such as Spirit Week, Field Day, Extreme Dodgeball, Operation Volleyball, Sadie Hawkins Dance, Wylie's Winter Week, and two blood drives. Members of GSC are elected in school-wide elections. In addition, each class elects its own government, which is responsible for planning class-wide events. Groves students also run their own events independent of the school, including the seniors-only \"Water Wars\" tournament at the end of the year.\n\n=== State Championships ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\"|State Championships\n|-\n!

Groves High School''' or '''Groves''') is a [[high school]] in [[Beverly Hills, Michigan]], United States, in the [[Birmingham City School District|Birmingham Public School District]].  Groves' colors are green, white, and yellow and its mascot is Freddy the Falcon. The current principal is Dr. Embekka Roberson, and the assistant principals are Othamian Peterson, Delois Spryszak, and Darin Wilcox, and the athletic director is Tom Flynn.\n\nThe [[French School of Detroit]] holds its high school classes at Groves High School.<ref>\"[http://www.frenchschoolofdetroit.org/curriculum/high-school The High School].\" [[French School of Detroit]]. Retrieved on June 20, 2015. \"Location: Groves High School, 20500 13 mile Road, Beverly, MI 48025.\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Name ===\nIn 1951, a new high school in Birmingham opened under the name Birmingham High School (which is now known as Seaholm High School). At the time, the president of the Board of Education was Ernest W. Seaholm and the treasurer was Wylie E. Groves. When Birmingham had to build another school to accommodate the incoming baby boomers, these men's names would become the source of the modern names of Birmingham's two main high schools: Seaholm High School and Groves High School.\n\n=== Building history ===\nCompleted in 1959, the building was an example of the International Style applied to ordinary school design, resulting in a modernistic exterior look similar to much subsequent school construction. The building's original architectural \"signature\" was a scalloped circular white roof over the circular library; now painted black, it is visible but no longer prominent. The building has a grid-like floor plan, with three main hallways intersected by six shorter ones. Liberal use was made of glass walls and interior courtyards, with energy costs not yet a major concern in 1959. Since the school's opening, the building has undergone periodic renovations, the most extensive occurring from 1999\u20132001 when the school was completely remodeled. The school features state of the art technology, including seven computer labs (including one for modern languages) and a large media center; state of the art science labs for biology, chemistry, physics, CAD, and robotics; a little theatre that seats approximately 300; an auditorium that seats approximately 1200; art studios for drawing, photography, jewelry, ceramics, and graphic design; a TV studio; and a large, open commons area where students gather for lunch, dances, and other activities. In 2005, construction began to renovate the athletic wing of the school, as well as to build a new competitive size swimming pool. The former swimming pool has been converted into classrooms, a fitness center, and a dance studio. The school was one of the first schools in Michigan to use artificial \"[[FieldTurf]]\" for its football/soccer field. In 2017, there was renovations of the auditorium and construction of a scene shop addition.\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe school opened in the fall of 1959 with 1,052 students in grades seven through ten. Intended eventually to be Birmingham's second high school, it was named after a local civic leader and school board member. In the first year, students selected the school colors (green and white), team nickname (Falcons), fight song (\"Rise Up, All Falcons,\" music and lyrics composed by Mr. Burton Bronson, Groves Band Director), names of the yearbook (\"Talon\") and newspaper (\"Scriptor\"), etc. The original tenth graders became the first class of graduating seniors in 1962. For a brief period the school was a junior and senior high school, and the classes of 1965, 1966 and 1967 spent grades seven through twelve there. Beginning with the 1963-64 school year, grades seven and eight were moved from Groves to Berkshire Middle School, which today serves grades six through eight in the Birmingham City School District.  The lower grades were eliminated as new junior high schools were built. This pattern enabled the school district to accommodate, with phased construction, the demographic wave of babyboomers emerging from elementary schools in the late 1950s and 1960s.\n\n== Academics ==\nThe school offers numerous Honors and Advanced Placement courses for students to elect. Advanced Placement is offered for Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, Computer Science, Economics, English Language, English Literature, Environmental Science, European History, French, Music Theory, Psychology, Spanish, Statistics, US History, and US Government. The school has a variety of academic elective options for students who do not wish to take Honors or AP courses. The school also offers many courses in journalism, with the newspaper- \"The Scriptor\", the yearbook- \"The Talon\", and the television production- \"The Fann (Falcon Action News Network)\"\n\n== Athletics and activities ==\nThe school offers over thirty varsity sports for both men and women.  Most sports are broken down into varsity, junior varsity, and freshmen teams. Groves is a member of the Oakland Activities Association and has won league championships in nearly every sport since the league's inception in 1994. Groves also offers a variety of activities for students to participate in, including instrumental music (both band and orchestra), forensics team, eco club, interact club, fashion club, Amnesty and Animal Rights club, Gay-Straight Alliance club, Japanese club, Spanish club, French club, debate team, theatre, quiz bowl, bowling club, photography club, and the National Honor Society. Both the forensics and debate teams have enjoyed success in recent years. The forensics team finished second in the state in 2007, while the debate team finished first in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010.\n\nGroves Student Congress (GSC) is responsible for planning school-wide activities and events such as Spirit Week, Field Day, Extreme Dodgeball, Operation Volleyball, Sadie Hawkins Dance, Wylie's Winter Week, and two blood drives. Members of GSC are elected in school-wide elections. In addition, each class elects its own government, which is responsible for planning class-wide events. Groves students also run their own events independent of the school, including the seniors-only \"Water Wars\" tournament at the end of the year.\n\n=== State Championships ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\"|State Championships\n|-\n!

They disrupt the ecosystems by [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]] [[colonization]], and damage harbors and waterways, ships and boats, and water treatment and power plants. Water treatment plants are most affected because the water intakes bring the microscopic free-swimming larvae directly into the facilities. Zebra mussels also cling to pipes under the water and clog them.\n\nGrossinger reported it in [[Hungary]] in 1794.

Another possible mode of introduction is on anchors and chains, although this has not been proven. Since adult zebra mussels can survive out of water for several days or weeks if the temperature is low and humidity is high, chain lockers provide temporary refuge for clusters of adult mussels that could easily be released when transoceanic ships drop anchor in freshwater ports. They have become an invasive species in North America, and as such they are the target of federal policy to control them, for instance in the [[National Invasive Species Act (1996)#Zebra mussels|National Invasive Species Act (1996)]].\n\nUsing models based on the genetic algorithm for rule-set production (GARP), a group of researchers predicted that the [[southeastern United States]] is moderately to highly likely to be inhabited by zebra mussels and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] unlikely to experience a zebra mussel invasion of water bodies.<ref>Drake, John M., and Jonathan M.

Trailered boat traffic is the most likely vector for invasion into [[Western Cordillera (North America)|Western North America]]. This spread is preventable if boaters thoroughly clean and dry their boats and associated equipment before transporting them to new bodies of water. Since no North American predator or combination of predators has been shown to significantly reduce zebra mussel numbers, such spread would most likely result in permanent establishment of zebra mussels in many North American [[waterway]]s.\n\nA major decrease in the concentration of dissolved oxygen was observed in the Seneca River in central New York in the summer of 1993. This decrease was caused by extremely high concentrations of zebra mussels in the watershed. Additionally, the Seneca River had significantly less chlorophyll in the water, which is used as a measure of phytoplankton biomass, because of the presence of zebra mussels.<ref>Effler, Steven W., Carol M.

Another possible mode of introduction is on anchors and chains, although this has not been proven.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.
