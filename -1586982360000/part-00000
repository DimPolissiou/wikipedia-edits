It was first released in July 1994 by [[XL Recordings]] in the United Kingdom and by [[Mute Records]] in the United States. Just as on the group's debut album ''[[Experience (Prodigy album)|Experience]]'' (1992), [[Maxim Reality]] was the only member of the band's lineup\u2014besides [[Liam Howlett]]\u2014to contribute to the album.\n\nA remastered and expanded edition of the album titled ''More Music for the Jilted Generation'' was released in 2008.<ref name=\"MMFTJF\">\"More Music for the Jilted Generation\", 2008 release [http://www.brainkiller.it/] (Retrieved 26 May 2008)</ref>\n\n== Music and content ==\n\n''Music for the Jilted Generation'' uses elements of [[rave]],<ref name=\"AllMusic\" /> [[breakbeat techno]],<ref name=\"AllMusic\" /> [[techno]],<ref name=Guardian /> [[hardcore techno]],<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\" /> and [[oldskool jungle]].<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\" />\n\nThe album is largely a response to the corruption of the [[rave]] scene in Britain by its mainstream status as well as Great Britain's [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]], which criminalised raves and parts of rave culture.<ref name=\"AllMusic\" /> This is exemplified in the song \"Their Law\" with the spoken word intro and the predominant lyric, the \"Fuck 'em and their law\" sample. Many years later, after the controversy died down, [[Liam Howlett]] derided the title of the album, which he referred to as \"stupid\", and maintained that the album was never meant to be political in the first place.<ref name=\"book\"/>\n\nMany of the samples featured on the album are sound clips from, or inspired by, movies. \"Intro\" features a sample that sounds like it's from the film ''[[The Lawnmower Man (film)|The Lawnmower Man]]'', however it is an American voice on \"Intro\" instead of Pierce Brosnan's English accent and the words are subtly different (on \"Intro\" the words are \"So, I've decided to take my work ''back'' underground, to stop it falling into the wrong hands\",<ref>{{cite web|title=The Prodigy - Intro + Break & Enter|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fg-_pEwmw|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> but in ''The Lawnmower Man'' the line is \"So I'm taking my work underground, I can't let it fall into the wrong hands ''again''\"<ref>Clip from The Lawnmower Man, skip to 9:20 {{cite web|title=The Lawnmower Man - Ending|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doAnB5_eDnw|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref>).  \"Their Law\" begins with a rephrased version of a quote from ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Smokey and the Bandit|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fJIdMG-2WQ|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=19 February 2018}}</ref> [[Jackie Gleason]]'s exasperated line \"What we're dealing with here is a ''complete'' lack of respect for the law\" becomes \"what we're dealing with here is a ''total'' lack of respect for the law\". \"Full Throttle\" contains a reverse sample from the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' movie, and \"The Heat (The Energy)\" features a sample from ''[[Poltergeist III]]''.<ref name=\"book\">{{cite book|last=Dimery|first=Robert|title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die|year=2005|publisher=Quintet Publishing|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-7893-1371-5|page=750}}</ref> In \"Claustrophobic Sting\", a voice whispers \"My mind is ''glowing''\",<ref>{{cite web|title=The Prodigy - claustrophobic sting (Narcotic Suite)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mVecwflO4|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> similar to [[HAL 9000]] saying \"My mind is ''going''\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Deactivation of HAL 9000|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8N72t7aScY|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> in the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.\n\nWhen Liam Howlett came to the cutting room for the final phase in the album production, he realised that all the tracks he had originally planned for wouldn't fit onto a CD, so \"One Love\" had to be edited which resulted in a cut of approximately 3 minutes and 53 seconds, \"The Heat (The Energy)\" was slightly cut, and the track called \"We Eat Rhythm\" was left out. \"We Eat Rhythm\" was later released on a free cassette with ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'' magazine in October 1994 entitled ''Select Future Tracks''. Liam Howlett later asserted that he felt the edit of \"One Love\" and \"Full Throttle\" could have been dropped from the track listing.<ref name=\"book\"/>\n\n=== Artwork ===\n\nThe album artwork for ''Music for the Jilted Generation'' was designed by Stewart Haygarth (cover) and [[Les Edwards]] (inner). The inner art, alluding to the conflicts of raver versus the police during the era of the 1994 [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice Act]] is particularly renowned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/20680/1/music-for-the-jilted-generation-the-artwork|title=Music for the Jilted Generation: the artwork|author=Huw Nesbitt|work=Dazed Digital|date=4 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Critical reception ==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/music-for-the-jilted-generation-mw0000622674 |title=Music for the Jilted Generation \u2013 The Prodigy |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=11 September 2011 |last=Bush |first=John}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[The Boston Phoenix]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|3.5|4}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/alt1/archive/music/reviews/01-02-97/OTR/PRODIGY.html |title=Prodigy: Music For The Jilted Generation (Mute) |work=[[The Boston Phoenix]] |date=2\u20139 January 1997 |accessdate=11 September 2011 |last=Freedberg |first=Michael |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305141232/http://bostonphoenix.com/alt1/archive/music/reviews/01-02-97/OTR/PRODIGY.html |archivedate=5 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s|Christgau's Consumer Guide]]''\n| rev3Score = A<ref name=\"Christgau\">{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3782 |chapter=The Prodigy: Music for the Jilted Generation |accessdate=11 September 2011 |last=Christgau |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Christgau |title=[[Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s]] |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |year=2000 |isbn=0-312-24560-2}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev4Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |last=Larkin |first=Colin |authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer) |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |edition=5th concise |year=2011 |isbn=0-85712-595-8}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[The Guardian]]''\n| rev5Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/01/electronicmusic.alexispetridis |title=Electronic review: The Prodigy, More Music For the Jilted Generation |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=1 August 2008 |accessdate=11 September 2011 |last=Petridis |first=Alexis |authorlink=Alexis Petridis}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev6Score = 9/10<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19980101000315reviews.html |title=The Prodigy \u2013 Music For The Jilted Generation |journal=[[NME]] |date=9 July 1994 |accessdate=11 May 2016 |last=Fadele |first=Dele |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001013034254/http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19980101000315reviews.html |archivedate=13 October 2000 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev7Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Prodigy: Music for the Jilted Generation |work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |issue=266 |date=September 2008 |page=117}}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[Record Collector]]''\n| rev8Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Prodigy: Music for the Jilted Generation |work=[[Record Collector]] |issue= |date=2008 |page=83 |quote=Under the booming breakbeats, thrash guitars and inflammatory soundbites, Howlett's supernova's talent was on overdrive...}}</ref>\n| rev9 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev9Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/recordings/review.asp?aid=31024&cf=1125 |title=The Prodigy: Music for the Jilted Generation |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=20 April 1995 |accessdate=11 May 2016 |last=Evans |first=Paul |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020113091102/http://www.rollingstone.com/recordings/review.asp?aid=31024&cf=1125 |archivedate=13 January 2002 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| rev10 = ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]''\n| rev10Score = 5/5<ref>{{cite journal |title=Essexpress! |work=[[Select (magazine)|Select]] |issue=50 |date=August 1994 |last=Harrison |first=Andrew |page=81}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Music for the Jilted Generation'' has received critical acclaim.

Many years later, after the controversy died down, [[Liam Howlett]] derided the title of the album, which he referred to as \"stupid\", and maintained that the album was never meant to be political in the first place.<ref name=\"book\"/>\n\nMany of the samples featured on the album are sound clips from, or inspired by, movies. \"Intro\" features a sample that sounds like it's from the film ''[[The Lawnmower Man (film)|The Lawnmower Man]]'', however it is an American voice on \"Intro\" instead of Pierce Brosnan's English accent and the words are subtly different (on \"Intro\" the words are \"So, I've decided to take my work ''back'' underground, to stop it falling into the wrong hands\",<ref>{{cite web|title=The Prodigy - Intro + Break & Enter|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fg-_pEwmw|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> but in ''The Lawnmower Man'' the line is \"So I'm taking my work underground, I can't let it fall into the wrong hands ''again''\"<ref>Clip from The Lawnmower Man, skip to 9:20 {{cite web|title=The Lawnmower Man - Ending|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doAnB5_eDnw|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref>).  \"Their Law\" begins with a rephrased version of a quote from ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Smokey and the Bandit|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fJIdMG-2WQ|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=19 February 2018}}</ref> [[Jackie Gleason]]'s exasperated line \"What we're dealing with here is a ''complete'' lack of respect for the law\" becomes \"what we're dealing with here is a ''total'' lack of respect for the law\". \"Full Throttle\" contains a reverse sample from the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' movie, and \"The Heat (The Energy)\" features a sample from ''[[Poltergeist III]]''.<ref name=\"book\">{{cite book|last=Dimery|first=Robert|title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die|year=2005|publisher=Quintet Publishing|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-7893-1371-5|page=750}}</ref> In \"Claustrophobic Sting\", a voice whispers \"My mind is ''glowing''\",<ref>{{cite web|title=The Prodigy - claustrophobic sting (Narcotic Suite)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mVecwflO4|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> similar to [[HAL 9000]] saying \"My mind is ''going''\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Deactivation of HAL 9000|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8N72t7aScY|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> in the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.\n\nWhen Liam Howlett came to the cutting room for the final phase in the album production, he realised that all the tracks he had originally planned for wouldn't fit onto a CD, so \"One Love\" had to be edited which resulted in a cut of approximately 3 minutes and 53 seconds, \"The Heat (The Energy)\" was slightly cut, and the track called \"We Eat Rhythm\" was left out. \"We Eat Rhythm\" was later released on a free cassette with ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'' magazine in October 1994 entitled ''Select Future Tracks''. Liam Howlett later asserted that he felt the edit of \"One Love\" and \"Full Throttle\" could have been dropped from the track listing.<ref name=\"book\"/>\n\n=== Artwork ===\n\nThe album artwork for ''Music for the Jilted Generation'' was designed by Stewart Haygarth (cover) and [[Les Edwards]] (inner).

''Geography of the German Democratic Republic'', VEB Hermann Haack, Gotha, pp. 8 ff. {{ISBN|978-3-7301-0522-1}}.</ref> in [[structural geology]] describes a [[Fold and thrust belt|fold belt]] of west and central Europe, formed during the [[Hercynian orogeny]] (about {{ma|350|280}}). The zone consists of [[fold (geology)|folded]] and [[thrust fault|thrusted]] [[Devonian]] and early [[Carboniferous]] [[sedimentary rock]]s that were deposited in a [[back-arc basin]] along the southern margin of the then existing [[paleocontinent]] [[Laurussia]].\n\nThe Rhenohercynian Zone, named for the [[Rhine River]] and the [[Hercynian Forest]] of Antiquity, forms a narrow zone through western and central Europe, from [[Cornwall]] and [[Ireland]] in the west to the [[Harz mountains]] of central [[Germany]] in the east, including the [[Rhenish Massif]] ([[Ardennes]], [[Taunus]], [[Eifel]] and [[Hunsr\u00fcck]]). The total length of this ancient basin (the '''Rhenohercynian Basin''') could have been more than 2500&nbsp;km. In the east the basin merges with the [[East-Silesian basin]] of southern [[Poland]]. The sedimentary rocks that were laid down in the basin are often weakly [[metamorphism|metamorphic]] ([[greenschist facies]]). Most geologists consider the [[South-Portuguese zone]] to be a continuation of the zone to the west.\n\nWhether the Rhenohercynian Basin was a continuous feature or rather a string of temporaneously interconnected smaller basins is not well understood, because in many places the Devonian and Carboniferous rock strata are covered with younger deposits. Parts of the basin have their own names, like the ''Cornwall basin'' in Cornwall, the ''[[Munster basin]]'' in [[Ireland]] or the ''Rhenisch basin'' in Belgium and Germany.\n\n==Tectonic structure and metamorphism==\n{{references|section|date=July 2015}}\n[[File:Synclinal.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Syncline]] at a [[quarry]] at [[Profondeville]], in the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Ardennes]]. The rock strata are [[Upper Devonian]] [[sandstone]]s and [[limestone]]s, folded during the late phases of the [[Hercynian orogeny]].]]\nThe Rhenohercynian Zone is a part of the northern [[Foreland basin|foreland]] of the Hercynian orogeny. It has a lower grade of metamorphism than the [[Saxothuringian Zone]] to the south, meaning its rocks have generally been at smaller depths and under lower temperatures. The [[Subvariscan Zone]] north of the Rhenohercynian Zone was untouched by Hercynian metamorphism. During the Hercynian orogeny, the Rhenohercynian zone was folded and thrusted internally. It was thrust over the foreland to the north (the [[London-Brabant Massif]] and other [[Avalonia]]n [[terrane]]s). From the south it was overthrust by the [[Mid-German Crystalline High]], part of the Saxothuringian Zone.\n\nThe metamorphic grade or degree of metamorphism increases towards the south or southeast. The southern edge of the Rhenish Massif lies in the [[Northern Phyllite Zone]], which has a higher grade than other parts of the zone.\n\n==Geodynamic history==\n===The Devonian basin===\nThe Rhenohercynian basin was situated north of the [[Rheic Ocean]], the ocean that spread between the continents of Laurussia (north) and [[Gondwana]] (south) from the [[Silurian]] onwards. The southern margin of Laurussia was formed during the [[Caledonian orogeny]] of the [[Silurian]] period, about 420 [[megaannum|million years ago]]. In the [[Lochkovian|Gedinnian/Lochkovian]] (Early Devonian) the southern part of the Caledonian mountain belt became a region of north\u2013south [[extensional tectonics|extension]]. An elongated basin was formed parallel to the continental margin. It separated the [[London-Brabant Massif]] to the north from the [[Normannian High|Normannian]] and [[Mid-German High]]s to the south.<ref>As in Ziegler (1990), pp. 31-32 and enclosure 11</ref>\n\nIn the Middle Devonian (from 390 million years ago) a [[subduction zone]] existed south of Laurussia, where [[oceanic lithosphere]] of the Rheic Ocean subducted beneath the Mid-German/Normannian highs. [[Volcanism]] above the subduction zone created a [[cordillera]]-type mountain chain, the [[Ligerian orogeny|Ligerian cordillera]]. In the [[Pragian|Siegenian/Pragian]] and [[Emsian]] the Rhenohercynic basin was a back-arc basin behind this cordillera. [[Tectonic subsidence]] in a system of [[horst (geology)|horsts]] and [[graben]]s together with [[basalt]]ic volcanism resulted in the creation of new oceanic lithosphere. In the Middle Devonian a second basin, the [[Saxothuringian basin|Saxothuringian]]/[[Armorican basin]], developed south of the Rhenohercynian basin. To the west some crustal convergence took place, and the Normannian High was partly [[thrust]] over the sedimentary basin fill of the Rhenohercynian basin.\n\n===Carboniferous compression===\nThe Rhenohercynian basin disappeared when the continent Gondwana [[continental collision|collided]] with Laurussia in the course of the Carboniferous period (the [[Hercynian orogeny]]). The sedimentary rocks in the basin were thrust in a series of [[piggyback basin]]s over the northern foreland (the London-Brabant Massif). These rocks now form the [[fold (geology)|folded]] sequences of Cornwall, the [[Ardennes]], the [[Eifel]] and the Harz.\n\nFrom the [[Frasnian]] age (380 million years ago) the [[Mafic|mafic volcanism]] ended, and the basin came locally under [[Compression (geology)|compressional]] [[stress (mechanics)|stress]], which led to folding and thrusting in the sedimentary rocks. Somewhere near the end of the Devonian, a subduction zone developed under the Mid-German/Normannian highs and Rhenohercynian crust began to subduct.<ref>Franke (1989); Ziegler (1990), p. 36</ref> This was the short [[Bretonnic phase]] of the Hercynian orogeny. It was followed, from the [[Tournaisian]] (early Carboniferous, 355 million years ago) till the end of the [[Visean]] by a new period of extension.<ref>Ziegler (1990), pp. 37-38</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Sudetic phase|Sudetic (main) phase]] of the Hercynian orogeny (330-320 million years ago, Late-Visean and [[Namurian]]/[[Serpukhovian]]) [[compressional tectonics]] had the upper hand again. In the Namurian age full-scale continental collision between Laurussia and Gondwana resulted in the destruction of the last oceanic crust of the basin. Its sedimentary fill was, however, not (totally) subducted but instead thrust northward. During the later part of the Carboniferous period ([[Westphalian (stage)|Westphalian]] and [[Stephanian (stage)|Stephanian]]) the Rhenohercynian zone formed the foreland of a relatively fast-developing Hercynian mountainbelt to the south.

''Geography of the German Democratic Republic'', VEB Hermann Haack, Gotha, pp. 8 ff. {{ISBN|978-3-7301-0522-1}}.</ref> in [[structural geology]] describes a [[Fold and thrust belt|fold belt]] of west and central Europe, formed during the [[Hercynian orogeny]] (about {{ma|350|280}}). The zone consists of [[fold (geology)|folded]] and [[thrust fault|thrusted]] [[Devonian]] and early [[Carboniferous]] [[sedimentary rock]]s that were deposited in a [[back-arc basin]] along the southern margin of the then existing [[paleocontinent]] [[Laurussia]].\n\nThe Rhenohercynian Zone, named for the [[Rhine River]] and the [[Hercynian Forest]] of Antiquity, forms a narrow zone through western and central Europe, from [[Cornwall]] and [[Ireland]] in the west to the [[Harz mountains]] of central [[Germany]] in the east, including the [[Rhenish Massif]] ([[Ardennes]], [[Taunus]], [[Eifel]] and [[Hunsr\u00fcck]]). The total length of this ancient basin (the '''Rhenohercynian Basin''') could have been more than 2500&nbsp;km. In the east the basin merges with the [[East-Silesian basin]] of southern [[Poland]]. The sedimentary rocks that were laid down in the basin are often weakly [[metamorphism|metamorphic]] ([[greenschist facies]]). Most geologists consider the [[South-Portuguese zone]] to be a continuation of the zone to the west.\n\nWhether the Rhenohercynian Basin was a continuous feature or rather a string of temporaneously interconnected smaller basins is not well understood, because in many places the Devonian and Carboniferous rock strata are covered with younger deposits. Parts of the basin have their own names, like the ''Cornwall basin'' in Cornwall, the ''[[Munster basin]]'' in [[Ireland]] or the ''Rhenisch basin'' in Belgium and Germany.\n\n==Tectonic structure and metamorphism==\n{{references|section|date=July 2015}}\n[[File:Synclinal.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Syncline]] at a [[quarry]] at [[Profondeville]], in the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Ardennes]]. The rock strata are [[Upper Devonian]] [[sandstone]]s and [[limestone]]s, folded during the late phases of the [[Hercynian orogeny]].]]\nThe Rhenohercynian Zone is a part of the northern [[Foreland basin|foreland]] of the Hercynian orogeny. It has a lower grade of metamorphism than the [[Saxothuringian Zone]] to the south, meaning its rocks have generally been at smaller depths and under lower temperatures. The [[Subvariscan Zone]] north of the Rhenohercynian Zone was untouched by Hercynian metamorphism. During the Hercynian orogeny, the Rhenohercynian zone was folded and thrusted internally. It was thrust over the foreland to the north (the [[London-Brabant Massif]] and other [[Avalonia]]n [[terrane]]s). From the south it was overthrust by the [[Mid-German Crystalline High]], part of the Saxothuringian Zone.\n\nThe metamorphic grade or degree of metamorphism increases towards the south or southeast. The southern edge of the Rhenish Massif lies in the [[Northern Phyllite Zone]], which has a higher grade than other parts of the zone.\n\n==Geodynamic history==\n===The Devonian basin===\nThe Rhenohercynian basin was situated north of the [[Rheic Ocean]], the ocean that spread between the continents of Laurussia (north) and [[Gondwana]] (south) from the [[Silurian]] onwards. The southern margin of Laurussia was formed during the [[Caledonian orogeny]] of the [[Silurian]] period, about 420 [[megaannum|million years ago]]. In the [[Lochkovian|Gedinnian/Lochkovian]] (Early Devonian) the southern part of the Caledonian mountain belt became a region of north-south [[extensional tectonics|extension]]. An elongated basin was formed parallel to the continental margin. It separated the [[London-Brabant Massif]] to the north from the [[Normannian High|Normannian]] and [[Mid-German High]]s to the south.<ref>As in Ziegler (1990), pp. 31-32 and enclosure 11</ref>\n\nIn the Middle Devonian (from 390 million years ago) a [[subduction zone]] existed south of Laurussia, where [[oceanic lithosphere]] of the Rheic Ocean subducted beneath the Mid-German/Normannian highs. [[Volcanism]] above the subduction zone created a [[cordillera]]-type mountain chain, the [[Ligerian orogeny|Ligerian cordillera]]. In the [[Pragian|Siegenian/Pragian]] and [[Emsian]] the Rhenohercynic basin was a back-arc basin behind this cordillera. [[Tectonic subsidence]] in a system of [[horst (geology)|horsts]] and [[graben]]s together with [[basalt]]ic volcanism resulted in the creation of new oceanic lithosphere. In the Middle Devonian a second basin, the [[Saxothuringian basin|Saxothuringian]]/[[Armorican basin]], developed south of the Rhenohercynian basin. To the west some crustal convergence took place, and the Normannian High was partly [[thrust]] over the sedimentary basin fill of the Rhenohercynian basin.\n\n===Carboniferous compression===\nThe Rhenohercynian basin disappeared when the continent Gondwana [[continental collision|collided]] with Laurussia in the course of the Carboniferous period (the [[Hercynian orogeny]]). The sedimentary rocks in the basin were thrust in a series of [[piggyback basin]]s over the northern foreland (the London-Brabant Massif). These rocks now form the [[fold (geology)|folded]] sequences of Cornwall, the [[Ardennes]], the [[Eifel]] and the Harz.\n\nFrom the [[Frasnian]] age (380 million years ago) the [[Mafic|mafic volcanism]] ended, and the basin came locally under [[Compression (geology)|compressional]] [[stress (mechanics)|stress]], which led to folding and thrusting in the sedimentary rocks. Somewhere near the end of the Devonian, a subduction zone developed under the Mid-German/Normannian highs and Rhenohercynian crust began to subduct.<ref>Franke (1989); Ziegler (1990), p. 36</ref> This was the short [[Bretonnic phase]] of the Hercynian orogeny. It was followed, from the [[Tournaisian]] (early Carboniferous, 355 million years ago) till the end of the [[Visean]] by a new period of extension.<ref>Ziegler (1990), pp. 37-38</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Sudetic phase|Sudetic (main) phase]] of the Hercynian orogeny (330-320 million years ago, Late-Visean and [[Namurian]]/[[Serpukhovian]]) [[compressional tectonics]] had the upper hand again. In the Namurian age full-scale continental collision between Laurussia and Gondwana resulted in the destruction of the last oceanic crust of the basin. Its sedimentary fill was, however, not (totally) subducted but instead thrust northward. During the later part of the Carboniferous period ([[Westphalian (stage)|Westphalian]] and [[Stephanian (stage)|Stephanian]]) the Rhenohercynian zone formed the foreland of a relatively fast-developing Hercynian mountainbelt to the south. [[isostasy|Isostatic]] subsidence of the foreland resulted in the development of a deep [[foreland basin]]. This filled with the products of [[erosion]] in the Hercynian mountains and the contemporaneously uplifted London-Brabant Massif to the north. During the Westphalian, the basin was completely filled and rose above sea level.<ref>Ziegler (1990), pp. 41-42</ref>\n\n==Stratigraphy==\n{{references|section|date=July 2015}}\nThe Rhenohercynian basin was filled with Devonian and Carboniferous sediments.
