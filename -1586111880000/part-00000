In the fall of 1986, he then appeared as another cop, Sergeant Luke Halui, in all 13 episodes of ''[[Heart of the City (TV series)|Heart of the City]]''. It was the second lowest rated show that season, due to having to do battle with NBC's Top 20 hits ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and ''[[Amen (TV series)|Amen]]'', as well as losing out to CBS's show ''[[The New Mike Hammer]]''. It ranked only 78th out of 79 shows and lasted only 13 episodes.\n\nProbably his most well known and prominent television role was in 1990s hit syndicated television series ''[[Renegade (TV series)|Renegade]]'' as Bobby Sixkiller. He also appeared in a minor role as Moki in the pilot episode of ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', before the role was taken over by another actor for the series (he played several bad guy bit parts in later episodes). His many other television appearances include series such as ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'', ''[[The A-Team]]'' and ''[[The Highwayman (TV series)|The Highwayman]]''. He has appeared in ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'', ''[[Action Jackson (1988 film)|Action Jackson]]'', ''[[Journey 2: The Mysterious Island]]'', ''[[Aces: Iron Eagle III]]'', ''[[Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man]]'', ''[[Christopher Columbus: The Discovery]]'', and in ''[[The Scorpion King]]'', as Mathayus's half-brother.\n\nHe was inducted to the [[Motorcycle Hall of Fame]] in 2003.<ref>{{mhof|356}}</ref> Grindcore band [[Anal Cunt]]  paid tribute to him in a track called \"Branscombe Richmond\" on their album ''[[I Like It When You Die]]''.\n\nHe now has taken part in being a voice actor for the hit game \"Apex Legends\", voicing the character Gibraltar.\n\n== Selected filmography ==\n{{Div col}}\n* ''[[Two-Minute Warning]]'' (1976) as Bystander with Blood on His Hands (uncredited)\n* ''[[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|Rollercoaster]]'' (1977) as Minor Role (uncredited)\n* ''[[MacArthur (film)|MacArthur]]'' (1977) as Korean Soldier (uncredited)\n* ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]'' (1977) as Guard (segment \"A Fistful of Yen\")\n* ''[[The Chicken Chronicles]]'' (1977) as Mark\n* ''Kill the Golden Goose'' (1979) as Mahuna\n* ''[[The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh]]'' (1979) as Winston Running Hawk\n* ''[[Magnum P.I.]]'' (1982) as native killed by curse\n* ''[[Killpoint]]'' (1984) as Informant in Locker Room (uncredited)\n* ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'' (1984) as Klingon Gunner #2\n* ''[[Cannonball Run II]]'' (1984) as Biker (uncredited)\n* ''[[Hawaiian Heat]]'' (1984) as Harker (main role)\n* ''[[Commando (1985 film)|Commando]]'' (1985) as Vega\n* ''[[Never Too Young to Die]]'' (1986) as Minkie's Partner \n* ''[[MacGyver]]'' (1986, TV Series) as Grade\n* ''[[Firewalker (film)|Firewalker]]'' (1986) as Mexican Bar Fight Person (uncredited)\n* ''[[Heart of the City (TV series)|Heart of the City]]'' (1986\u20131987, TV Series) as Sergeant Luke Halui (main role)\n* ''No Safe Haven'' (1987) as Manuel\n* ''[[Best Seller]]'' (1987) as Longshoreman #1\n* ''[[The Hidden (film)|The Hidden]]'' (1987) as Roberts\n* ''[[Action Jackson (1988 film)|Action Jackson]]'' (1988) as Poolroom Thug #2\n* ''[[The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking]]'' (1988) as Fridolf\n* ''[[Hero and the Terror]]'' (1988) as Victor\n* ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' (1989) as Barrelhead Bar Patron (uncredited)\n* ''[[L.A.

The main bus service operating on the busway is the Metro Silver Line which was introduced on December 13, 2009. The [[Silver Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Silver Line]] bus rapid transit line runs on the Harbor Transitway from [[Harbor Gateway Transit Center]] to [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and continues to [[El Monte Bus Station]]. The line operates daily with frequent service. In addition to Metro Silver Line, other Metro bus and municipal bus routes also operate on the Harbor Transitway. They include [[Metro Express (Los Angeles County)|Metro Express]] lines 442, 460 and 550, [[Torrance Transit]] line 4, [[Gardena Transit]] line 1X and [[Orange County Transportation Authority]] lines 701, 721. Metro Express lines 442 and 550 operate only during weekdays peak hours. Metro Line 442 operates peak a.m. northbound only and southbound p.m. only. Torrance Transit line 4, Gardena Transit line 1X, and [[Orange County Transportation Authority]]: 701, 721 operate only during weekday peak hours. Metro Express line 460 operates daily along with the Metro Silver Line. Busway bus lines originate from [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and [[El Monte, California|El Monte]], with final destinations in [[Disneyland]], and [[Disney California Adventure Park]] located in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[Knott's Berry Farm]], [[Artesia, California|Artesia]], [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]], [[Gardena, California|Gardena]], [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]], [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]], [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]] and [[Torrance, California|Torrance]].\n\nIn November 2012, the existing [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s within the Transitway were converted to [[high occupancy/toll and express toll lanes|high-occupancy toll lanes]]. This is part of the larger [[Metro ExpressLanes]] project which added major transportation improvements to the area. A few project-mandated improvements along the Transitway are still being completed.\n\nThere are six transit stations on the main section of the Harbor transitway (the section with high-occupancy lanes): [[37th Street (LACMTA station)|37th Street Station]], [[Slauson (Harbor Transitway) (LACMTA station)|Slauson Station]], [[Manchester (LACMTA station)|Manchester Station]], [[Harbor Freeway (LACMTA station)|Harbor Freeway/I-105 Station]], [[Rosecrans (LACMTA station)|Rosecrans Station]] and [[Harbor Gateway Transit Center]] (to one side). All of these 6 stations are branded as [[Silver Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Silver Line]] stations. In addition, there are two stations on the freeway to the south of the transitway: [[Carson (Los Angeles Metro station)|Carson Station]] and [[Pacific Coast Highway (Harbor Transitway station)|Pacific Coast Highway station]]. On December 13, 2015, the Metro Silver Line route was extended to serve and terminate in San Pedro. The extension replaced Metro Express Line 450 which had also utilized the transitway. Not all Metro Silver Line trips terminates in San Pedro.\n\n==History==\nAfter 20 years of planning and then construction the combined high-occupancy roadway and transitway was opened in 1998{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} at a cost of $500 million. Provision was made for the transitway to continue further north from Adams Boulevard/ Flower Street to join the [[El Monte Busway]]<ref name=\"dual hub\">{{cite web|url=http://libraryarchives.metro.net/DPGTL/hov/dual_hub_hov_transitway.pdf|title=Dual Hub High Occupancy Vehicle Transitway|publisher=MetroMTA}}</ref> and construction of the busway included 'ski jumps' just past the on/off ramps at this point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Los+Angeles,+CA,+USA&hl=en&ll=34.025352,-118.275687&spn=0.00194,0.002677&sll=53.800651,-4.064941&sspn=16.052594,43.857422&t=h&z=19|title=Google maps satellite view of 'ski jumps'|publisher=Google}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early months of the busway ridership was roughly 3,000 boardings a day. Initial usage was only 5% of the predicted 65,000 and fares were reduced from $3.35 to $1.35 in 2000 to encourage additional usage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/nov/18/local/me-53956|title=Harbor Transitway Has Everything but Riders|work=Los Angeles Times|date=November 20, 2000|quote=The $500-million Harbor Transitway from Wilmington to downtown Los Angeles was supposed to generate 65,000 bus rides a day along the Harbor Freeway.

During the 1990s Metro staff was studying the possibility of connecting the El Monte Busway with the Harbor Transitway by operating a bus rapid transit line. The project was supported by Metro, but plans were later scrapped because of the lack of funds to operate the bus rapid transit line. The project was later revealed early 2009 by staff. The new project would be called the '''Dual Hub BRT''' which was later called the '''Metro Silver Line'''. The line got its color from the former color on the El Monte Busway which was silver. The project looked at operating a bus rapid transit on both the El Monte Busway and Harbor Transitway serving Downtown Los Angeles as the halfway point of the line. Future project amenities looked similar to the ones on the [[Orange Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Orange Line]]. A council meeting was held to propose a fare for the Metro Silver Line. The line was originally proposed to operate with a local fare, but was later changed due to the interference of Foothill Transit's Silver Streak line which does not have a local fare. The Metro Silver Line was presented to several council meetings for support from passengers and was approved for implementation.\n\nThe [[Silver Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Silver Line]] was introduced on December 13, 2009 using both the Harbor Transitway and the [[El Monte Busway]] for a 26-mile service operating mostly on the freeways.  Usage on the Harbor Transit way has significantly increased with the implementation of the Metro Silver Line. In particular, ridership has increased between 7th Street/Metro Center Station and the Harbor Freeway Station. Weeks after the Silver Line began service, Metro mailed thousands of brochures of the Metro Silver Line to people living near the I-110 freeway to become aware of the new bus rapid transit line.\n\n===Metro ExpressLanes project===\nThe [[Metro ExpressLanes project]] began work in 2010 to add improvements to the public transport services and facilities. The security of the Harbor Gateway Transit Center (formerly the Artesia Transit Center) was improved in November 2010 and [[CCTV]] was installed. Bike lockers were installed and the existing building was re-purposed as a Sheriff substation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.net/board/Items/2012/04_April/20120418AHCPItem31Handout.pdf|title=LOS ANGELES COUNTY CONGESTION REDUCTION DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM STATUS REPORT|date=April 18, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"metro.net\">http://www.metro.net/projects/silverline/</ref> Improvements were made to station Lighting Improvements and to the Slauson and Manchester stations.\n\nThe high-occupancy lanes between Harbor Gateway Transit Center and Adams Blvd were converted to [[High occupancy/toll and express toll lanes|high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes]]. Opened in November 2012, the HOT lanes require [[Fastrak]] transponders.\n\nOther changes also include:\n\n*[[Bus priority]] is being expanded in Downtown Los Angeles, which will improve performance of the Metro Silver Line.\n*New security cameras and digital message boards are being installed at stations on the route.<ref name=ExpressLanes>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.net/projects/expresslanes/|title=Metro ExpressLanes|publisher=Metro MTA}}</ref>\n*Park & Ride facilities are being improved at the Harbor Transitway station.\n*More bicycle lockers are to be provided the [[Harbor Gateway Transit Center]].\n*A new Bus Maintenance Facility is being constructed in Downtown Los Angeles.\n*59 new [[Compressed natural gas]] powered 45-foot buses are to be introduced on the Silver Line, together with 100 new Metro [[Vanpool]] vehicles.<ref name=ExpressLanes/>\n\n==Bus services==\nThe Harbor transitway is served by the Metro Silver Line, Metro Express and municipal operators. The Metro Silver Line is the bus service used the most based on ridership on the busway. The busway is primarily used by the Metro Silver Line although there are a number of other express lines, some of which are operated by other transit operators. Each line in the busway has a different fare structure. Metro Silver Line charges $2.50 for a base fare, one way, but Metro Day pass holders do not need to pay an additional charge. Metro and Foothill Transit's ''Silver 2 Silver'' program does not apply on the Harbor transitway portion even though the Silver Line operates on both the Harbor and El Monte Busways. \n{|align= \"middle\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n![[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Metro]]\n![[Torrance Transit]]\n|-\n|[[Silver Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Silver Line]]{{LACMTA icon strip|Silver}}<br>[[Metro Express (Los Angeles County)|Metro Express]] Lines: 442, 460, & 550.\n|[[Torrance Transit]]: 4\n|-\n|}\n\n==Stations==\nThe transitway is a key component served by the [[Silver Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Silver Line]] and is also served by [[Metro Express (Los Angeles County)|Metro Express]] buses, [[Los Angeles Department of Transportation]], [[Orange County Transportation Authority]], [[Gardena Transit]] and [[Torrance Transit]] buses.

The Metro Silver Line began service on December 13, 2009. Ridership is lower than the El Monte Busway, which is also served by the Metro Silver Line. A number of reasons have been identified: The main causes for the low ridership are the premium express fare charged to passengers compared to riders on the Blue Line and Metro Rapid (up to $1 more each way than a trip made on the Rapid or Blue Line),{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} the isolated and noisy freeway environment of the stations, and the inconvenience of accessing the stations (and lack of surrounding buses) around the stations compared to surface level light rail or Rapid service.  Ridership began increasing with the advent of the Metro Silver Line. In late June 2011, Metro Silver Line service frequency increased from 30 mins to 15 mins on Weekdays and on Saturdays, service increased from 60 mins to 40 mins. In the February 2012 Metro Express Lanes Program report, ridership on the Silver Line alone on the Harbor Transitway was 3,969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.net/board/Items/2012/04_April/20120418AHCPItem31.pdf|title=Metro ExpressLanes February 2012 Report |date=March 19, 2012}}</ref> The report revealed that ridership on the [[Silver Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Silver Line]] alone increased 43% from the June 2011 improved frequency of the Metro Silver Line. On June 17, 2012 Metro added the second phase of adding more service to the Silver Line. Weekday peak hour service was added for the Metro Silver Line (an improvement from 10 mins to 4-8 mins). Saturday, Sunday/Holiday service was added for the Silver Line (an improvement from 40 mins to 20 mins on Saturdays and from 60 mins to 30 mins on Sundays/Holidays).\n\nIts main competitors are the [[Blue Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Blue Line]] to Long Beach and the [[Metro Rapid]] Line 745, just a block away on Broadway.  Ridership on the Transitway is not officially tabulated because service on the Transitway consists of several [[Metro Express (Los Angeles County)|Metro Express]] lines, two routes operated by the [[Orange County Transportation Authority]], and services operated by the cities of [[Gardena, California|Gardena]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and [[Torrance, California|Torrance]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nUsage of the express lanes by private vehicles has become high enough that speeds have decreased, leading to carpool-only restrictions during peak hours. To compensate, Metro is considering increasing the maximum toll from its current $1.40 per mile cap.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nelson|first1=Laura J.|title=MTA's toll-lane project may be a victim of its own success|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-commute-20150324-story.html|accessdate=June 8, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Service history===\nWhen the Harbor Transitway opened in 1995 increased service on the existing Harbor Freeway express bus lines and operating each as independent routes. Because most of the buses traveling on the Harbor Freeway served the needs of commuters, service was frequent along the corridors during the weekday peak hours, but infrequent during other times.

The main bus service operating on the busway is the Metro Silver Line which was introduced on December 13, 2009. The [[Silver Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Silver Line]] bus rapid transit line runs on the Harbor Transitway from [[Harbor Gateway Transit Center]] to [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and continues to [[El Monte Bus Station]]. The line operates daily with frequent service. In addition to Metro Silver Line, other Metro bus and municipal bus routes also operate on the Harbor Transitway. They include [[Metro Express (Los Angeles County)|Metro Express]] lines 442, 460 and 550, [[Torrance Transit]] line 4, [[Gardena Transit]] line 1X and [[Orange County Transportation Authority]] lines 701, 721. Metro Express lines 442 and 550 operate only during weekdays peak hours. Metro Line 442 operates peak a.m. northbound only and southbound p.m. only. Torrance Transit line 4, Gardena Transit line 1X, and [[Orange County Transportation Authority]]: 701, 721 operate only during weekday peak hours. Metro Express line 460 operates daily along with the Metro Silver Line. Busway bus lines originate from [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and [[El Monte, California|El Monte]], with final destinations in [[Disneyland]], and [[Disney California Adventure Park]] located in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[Knott's Berry Farm]], [[Artesia, California|Artesia]], [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]], [[Gardena, California|Gardena]], [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]], [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]], [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]] and [[Torrance, California|Torrance]].\n\nIn November 2012, the existing [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s within the Transitway were converted to [[high occupancy/toll and express toll lanes|high-occupancy toll lanes]]. This is part of the larger [[Metro ExpressLanes]] project which added major transportation improvements to the area. A few project-mandated improvements along the Transitway are still being completed.\n\nThere are six transit stations on the main section of the Harbor transitway (the section with high-occupancy lanes): [[37th Street (LACMTA station)|37th Street Station]], [[Slauson (Harbor Transitway) (LACMTA station)|Slauson Station]], [[Manchester (LACMTA station)|Manchester Station]], [[Harbor Freeway (LACMTA station)|Harbor Freeway/I-105 Station]], [[Rosecrans (LACMTA station)|Rosecrans Station]] and [[Harbor Gateway Transit Center]] (to one side). All of these 6 stations are branded as [[Silver Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Silver Line]] stations. In addition, there are two stations on the freeway to the south of the transitway: [[Carson (Los Angeles Metro station)|Carson Station]] and [[Pacific Coast Highway (Harbor Transitway station)|Pacific Coast Highway station]]. On December 13, 2015, the Metro Silver Line route was extended to serve and terminate in San Pedro. The extension replaced Metro Express Line 450 which had also utilized the transitway. Not all Metro Silver Line trips terminates in San Pedro.\n\n==History==\nAfter 20 years of planning and then construction the combined high-occupancy roadway and transitway was opened in 1998{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} at a cost of $500 million. Provision was made for the transitway to continue further north from Adams Boulevard/ Flower Street to join the [[El Monte Busway]]<ref name=\"dual hub\">{{cite web|url=http://libraryarchives.metro.net/DPGTL/hov/dual_hub_hov_transitway.pdf|title=Dual Hub High Occupancy Vehicle Transitway|publisher=MetroMTA}}</ref> and construction of the busway included 'ski jumps' just past the on/off ramps at this point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Los+Angeles,+CA,+USA&hl=en&ll=34.025352,-118.275687&spn=0.00194,0.002677&sll=53.800651,-4.064941&sspn=16.052594,43.857422&t=h&z=19|title=Google maps satellite view of 'ski jumps'|publisher=Google}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early months of the busway ridership was roughly 3,000 boardings a day. Initial usage was only 5% of the predicted 65,000 and fares were reduced from $3.35 to $1.35 in 2000 to encourage additional usage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/nov/18/local/me-53956|title=Harbor Transitway Has Everything but Riders|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2000-11-20|quote=The $500-million Harbor Transitway from Wilmington to downtown Los Angeles was supposed to generate 65,000 bus rides a day along the Harbor Freeway.

During the 1990s Metro staff was studying the possibility of connecting the El Monte Busway with the Harbor Transitway by operating a bus rapid transit line. The project was supported by Metro, but plans were later scrapped because of the lack of funds to operate the bus rapid transit line. The project was later revealed early 2009 by staff. The new project would be called the '''Dual Hub BRT''' which was later called the '''Metro Silver Line'''. The line got its color from the former color on the El Monte Busway which was silver. The project looked at operating a bus rapid transit on both the El Monte Busway and Harbor Transitway serving Downtown Los Angeles as the halfway point of the line. Future project amenities looked similar to the ones on the [[Orange Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Orange Line]]. A council meeting was held to propose a fare for the Metro Silver Line. The line was originally proposed to operate with a local fare, but was later changed due to the interference of Foothill Transit's Silver Streak line which does not have a local fare. The Metro Silver Line was presented to several council meetings for support from passengers and was approved for implementation.\n\nThe [[Silver Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Silver Line]] was introduced on December 13, 2009 using both the Harbor Transitway and the [[El Monte Busway]] for a 26-mile service operating mostly on the freeways.  Usage on the Harbor Transit way has significantly increased with the implementation of the Metro Silver Line. In particular, ridership has increased between 7th Street/Metro Center Station and the Harbor Freeway Station. Weeks after the Silver Line began service, Metro mailed thousands of brochures of the Metro Silver Line to people living near the I-110 freeway to become aware of the new bus rapid transit line.\n\n===Metro ExpressLanes project===\nThe [[Metro ExpressLanes project]] began work in 2010 to add improvements to the public transport services and facilities. The security of the Harbor Gateway Transit Center (formerly the Artesia Transit Center) was improved in November 2010 and [[CCTV]] was installed. Bike lockers were installed and the existing building was re-purposed as a Sheriff substation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.net/board/Items/2012/04_April/20120418AHCPItem31Handout.pdf|title=LOS ANGELES COUNTY CONGESTION REDUCTION DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM STATUS REPORT|date=2012-04-18}}</ref><ref name=\"metro.net\">http://www.metro.net/projects/silverline/</ref> Improvements were made to station Lighting Improvements and to the Slauson and Manchester stations.\n\nThe high-occupancy lanes between Harbor Gateway Transit Center and Adams Blvd were converted to [[High occupancy/toll and express toll lanes|high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes]]. Opened in November 2012, the HOT lanes require [[Fastrak]] transponders.\n\nOther changes also include:\n\n*[[Bus priority]] is being expanded in Downtown Los Angeles, which will improve performance of the Metro Silver Line.\n*New security cameras and digital message boards are being installed at stations on the route.<ref name=ExpressLanes>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.net/projects/expresslanes/|title=Metro ExpressLanes|publisher=Metro MTA}}</ref>\n*Park & Ride facilities are being improved at the Harbor Transitway station.\n*More bicycle lockers are to be provided the [[Harbor Gateway Transit Center]].\n*A new Bus Maintenance Facility is being constructed in Downtown Los Angeles.\n*59 new [[Compressed natural gas]] powered 45-foot buses are to be introduced on the Silver Line, together with 100 new Metro [[Vanpool]] vehicles.<ref name=ExpressLanes/>\n\n==Bus services==\nThe Harbor transitway is served by the Metro Silver Line, Metro Express and municipal operators. The Metro Silver Line is the bus service used the most based on ridership on the busway. The busway is primarily used by the Metro Silver Line although there are a number of other express lines, some of which are operated by other transit operators. Each line in the busway has a different fare structure. Metro Silver Line charges $2.50 for a base fare, one way, but Metro Day pass holders do not need to pay an additional charge. Metro and Foothill Transit's ''Silver 2 Silver'' program does not apply on the Harbor transitway portion even though the Silver Line operates on both the Harbor and El Monte Busways. \n{|align= \"middle\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n![[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Metro]]\n![[Torrance Transit]]\n|-\n|[[Silver Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Silver Line]]{{LACMTA icon strip|Silver}}<br>[[Metro Express (Los Angeles County)|Metro Express]] Lines: 442, 460, & 550.\n|[[Torrance Transit]]: 4\n|-\n|}\n\n==Stations==\nThe transitway is a key component served by the [[Silver Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Silver Line]] and is also served by [[Metro Express (Los Angeles County)|Metro Express]] buses, [[Los Angeles Department of Transportation]], [[Orange County Transportation Authority]], [[Gardena Transit]] and [[Torrance Transit]] buses.

The Metro Silver Line began service on December 13, 2009. Ridership is lower than the El Monte Busway, which is also served by the Metro Silver Line. A number of reasons have been identified: The main causes for the low ridership are the premium express fare charged to passengers compared to riders on the Blue Line and Metro Rapid (up to $1 more each way than a trip made on the Rapid or Blue Line),{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} the isolated and noisy freeway environment of the stations, and the inconvenience of accessing the stations (and lack of surrounding buses) around the stations compared to surface level light rail or Rapid service.  Ridership began increasing with the advent of the Metro Silver Line. In late June 2011, Metro Silver Line service frequency increased from 30 mins to 15 mins on Weekdays and on Saturdays, service increased from 60 mins to 40 mins. In the February 2012 Metro Express Lanes Program report, ridership on the Silver Line alone on the Harbor Transitway was 3,969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.net/board/Items/2012/04_April/20120418AHCPItem31.pdf|title=Metro ExpressLanes February 2012 Report |date=2012-03-19}}</ref> The report revealed that ridership on the [[Silver Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Silver Line]] alone increased 43% from the June 2011 improved frequency of the Metro Silver Line. On June 17, 2012 Metro added the second phase of adding more service to the Silver Line. Weekday peak hour service was added for the Metro Silver Line (an improvement from 10 mins to 4-8 mins). Saturday, Sunday/Holiday service was added for the Silver Line (an improvement from 40 mins to 20 mins on Saturdays and from 60 mins to 30 mins on Sundays/Holidays).\n\nIts main competitors are the [[Blue Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Blue Line]] to Long Beach and the [[Metro Rapid]] Line 745, just a block away on Broadway.  Ridership on the Transitway is not officially tabulated because service on the Transitway consists of several [[Metro Express (Los Angeles County)|Metro Express]] lines, two routes operated by the [[Orange County Transportation Authority]], and services operated by the cities of [[Gardena, California|Gardena]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and [[Torrance, California|Torrance]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nUsage of the express lanes by private vehicles has become high enough that speeds have decreased, leading to carpool-only restrictions during peak hours. To compensate, Metro is considering increasing the maximum toll from its current $1.40 per mile cap.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nelson|first1=Laura J.|title=MTA's toll-lane project may be a victim of its own success|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-commute-20150324-story.html|accessdate=8 June 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Service history===\nWhen the Harbor Transitway opened in 1995 increased service on the existing Harbor Freeway express bus lines and operating each as independent routes.

While it is independent, it has usually supported the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. From 2009 to 2018, it faced serious financial difficulties until it was purchased by ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' in late 2018, shifting to a quarterly publication model.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Origins ===\n''Tribune'' was founded in early 1937 by two wealthy left-wing Labour Party [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs), [[Sir Stafford Cripps]] and [[George Strauss]], to back the [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)#The Unity Campaign|Unity Campaign]], an attempt to secure an anti-fascist and anti-appeasement [[United Front]] between the Labour Party and socialist parties to the left. The latter included Cripps's (Labour-affiliated) [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)|Socialist League]], the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) and the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB).\n\nThe paper's first editor was [[William Mellor (journalist)|William Mellor]]. Among its journalists were [[Michael Foot]] and Barbara Betts (later [[Barbara Castle]]), while the board included the Labour MPs [[Aneurin Bevan]] and [[Ellen Wilkinson]], [[Harold Laski]] of the [[Left Book Club]] and the veteran left-wing journalist and former ILP member [[H. N. Brailsford]].\n\nMellor was fired in 1938 for refusing to adopt a new CPGB policy\u2014supported by Cripps\u2014of backing a [[Popular Front]], including non-socialist parties, against fascism and appeasement; Foot resigned in solidarity. Mellor was succeeded by H. J. Hartshorn, a secret member of the CPGBP. Meanwhile [[Victor Gollancz]], the Left Book Club's publisher, joined the board of directors. For the next year, the paper was little more than an appendage of the Left Book Club, taking an uncritical line on the Popular Front and the Soviet Union.\n\n===1940s===\nWith the [[Nazi-Soviet pact]] and the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1939, ''Tribune'' initially adopted the CPGB's position of denouncing the British and French declarations of war on Germany as imperialist. After the Soviet invasion of Finland, with Cripps off on a world tour, Strauss and Bevan became increasingly impatient with Hartshorn's unrelenting [[Stalinism]]. Strauss fired Hartshorn in February 1940, replacing him as editor with [[Raymond Postgate]]. Under Postgate's editorship, the Soviet [[fellow travellers]] at ''Tribune'' were either dismissed, or in Postgate's words, \"left soon after in dislike of me\".<ref>Bill Jones, ''The Russia Complex: the British Labour Party and the Soviet Union'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1977,  {{ISBN|0719006961}}), pp. 48-49</ref> From then on, the paper became the voice of the pro-war democratic left in the Labour Party, taking a position similar to that adopted by Gollancz in the volume ''[[Betrayal of the Left]]'' he edited attacking the communists for backing the Nazi-Soviet pact.{{Citation needed}} \n\n[[Image:Tribune flier 1941.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Early 1941 ''Tribune'' flier]]\nBevan ousted Postgate after a series of personality clashes in 1941, assuming the role of editor himself, although the day-to-day running of the paper was done by [[Jon Kimche]]. The Bevan-Kimche ''Tribune'' is revered as one of the greatest left-wing papers in British history{{By whom|date=April 2020}}. It campaigned vigorously for the opening of a second front against [[Adolf Hitler]]'s Germany, was consistently critical of the [[Winston Churchill]] government's failings, and argued that only a democratic socialist post-war settlement in Britain and Europe as a whole was viable.\n\n[[George Orwell]] was hired in 1943 as literary editor. In this role, as well as commissioning and writing reviews, he wrote a series of columns, most of them under the title \"[[As I Please]]\", that have become touchstones of the opinion journalist's craft. Orwell left the ''Tribune'' staff in early 1945 to become a war correspondent for ''[[The Observer]]'', to be replaced as literary editor by his friend [[Tosco Fyvel]], but he remained a regular contributor until March 1947.\n\nOrwell's most famous contributions to ''Tribune'' as a columnist include \"You and the atom bomb\", \"The sporting spirit\", \"Books v cigarettes\", \"[[Decline of the English Murder]]\" and \"[[Some Thoughts on the Common Toad]]\", all of which have since appeared in dozens of anthologies.\n\nOther writers who contributed to ''Tribune'' in the 1940s include [[Naomi Mitchison]], [[Stevie Smith]], [[Alex Comfort]], [[Arthur Calder-Marshall]], [[Julian Symons]], [[Elizabeth Taylor (novelist)|Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rhys Davies (writer)|Rhys Davies]], Daniel George, [[Inez Holden]], and [[Phyllis Shand Allfrey]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Lizabeth |last=Paravisini-Gebert |title=Phyllis Shand Allfrey: A Caribbean Life |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-8135-2265-X |page=61 }}</ref>\n\nKimche left ''Tribune'' to join Reuters in 1945, his place being taken by [[Frederic Mullally]]. After the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|Labour landslide election victory of 1945]], Bevan joined [[Clement Attlee]]'s government and formally left the paper, leaving Mullally and [[Evelyn Anderson]] as joint editors, with Foot playing Bevan's role of political director. Over the next five years, ''Tribune'' was critically involved in every key political event in the life of the Labour government and reached its highest-ever circulation, of some 40,000. Foot persuaded Kimche to return as joint editor in 1946 (after Mullally's departure to the [[Sunday Pictorial]]) and in 1948 himself became joint editor with Anderson, after Kimche was fired for disappearing from the office to travel to Istanbul to negotiate the safe passage of two Jewish refugee ships through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles.\n\nIn the first few years of the Attlee administration, ''Tribune'' became the focus for the Labour left's attempts to persuade [[Ernest Bevin]], the Foreign Secretary, to adopt a \"third force\" democratic socialist foreign policy, with Europe acting independently from the United States and the Soviet Union, most coherently advanced in the pamphlet ''[[Keep Left (pamphlet)|Keep Left]]'' (which was published by the rival ''[[New Statesman]]'').\n\nAfter the Soviet rejection of [[Marshall Aid]] and the communist takeover of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1948, ''Tribune'' endorsed the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and took a strongly anti-communist line, with its editor declaring in November 1948: \"The major threat to democratic socialism and the major danger of war in Europe arises from Soviet policy and not from American policy. It is not the Americans who have imposed a blockade on Berlin. It is not the Americans who have used conspiratorial methods to destroy democratic socialist parties in one country after another. It is not the Americans who have blocked effective action through one United Nations agency after another\".\n\n=== Bevanism and Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ===\nFoot remained in the editorial chair until 1952 when [[Bob Edwards (British journalist)|Bob Edwards]] took over, but he returned after losing his parliamentary seat in Plymouth in 1955. During the early 1950s, ''Tribune'' became the organ of the [[Bevanite]] left opposition to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leadership, turning against the United States over its handling of the Korean War, then arguing strongly against West German rearmament and nuclear arms. However, ''Tribune'' remained critical of the Soviet Union as it denounced Stalin on his death in 1953 and in 1956 opposed the Soviet suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] and the British government's [[Suez]] adventure. The paper and Bevan parted company after his \"naked into the conference chamber\" speech at the 1957 Labour Party conference. For the next five years, ''Tribune'' was at the forefront of the campaign to commit Labour to a non-nuclear defence policy, \"the official weekly of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]\" (CND) as the direct actionists in the peace movement put it. CND's general secretary [[Peggy Duff]] had been ''Tribune'' general manager. Among journalists on ''Tribune'' in the 1950s were [[Richard Clements (journalist)|Richard Clements]], [[Ian Aitken (journalist)|Ian Aitken]] and [[Mervyn Jones (UK journalist)|Mervyn Jones]], who related his experience on the paper in his autobiography ''Chances''.\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\nAfter Foot was re-elected to Parliament in 1960 for Bevan's old seat of [[Ebbw Vale]], Richard Clements became editor. During the 1960s and 1970s the paper faithfully expressed the ideas of the parliamentary Labour left and allied itself with the new generation of left-wing trade union leaders that emerged on the back of a wave of workplace militancy from the early 1960s onwards.\n\nAs such, it played a massive role in the politics of the time. Although it welcomed the election of Harold Wilson's Labour government in 1964\u2014\"Tribune takes over from Eton in the cabinet\", exclaimed a headline\u2014the paper became rapidly disillusioned. It denounced the Wilson government's timidity on nationalisation and devaluation, opposed its moves to join the [[European Communities]] (EC) and attacked it for failing to take a principled position against the [[Vietnam War]]. It also backed the unions' campaigns against the government's prices-and-incomes policies and against ''[[In Place of Strife]]'', Barbara Castle's 1969 package of trade union law reforms.\n\nThe paper continued in the same vein after [[Edward Heath]] won the 1970 general election, opposing his Tory government's trade union legislation between 1970 and 1974 and placing itself at the head of opposition to Heath's negotiations for Britain to join the EEC. After Labour regained power in 1974, ''Tribune'' played a central part in the \"no\" campaign in the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum on British EEC membership]].\n\nHowever, ''Tribune'' in this period did not speak to, let alone represent, the concerns of the younger generation of leftists who were at the centre of the campaign against the Vietnam War and the post-1968 student revolt, who found the paper's reformism and commitment to Labour tame and old-fashioned. Circulation, around 20,000 in 1960, was said by 1980 to be around 10,000, but it was in fact much less.\n\n===Brief support of Tony Benn===\nClements resigned as editor in 1982 to become a political adviser to Foot (by now Labour leader), a role he continued under Foot's successor as Labour leader, [[Neil Kinnock]]. Clements was succeeded in the ''Tribune'' chair by [[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]], who steered the paper into supporting [[Tony Benn]] (then just past the peak of his influence on the Labour left) and attempted to turn it into a friendly society in which readers were invited to buy shares, much to the consternation of the old Bevanite shareholders, most prominent among them [[John Silkin]] and [[Donald Bruce, Baron Bruce of Donington|Donald Bruce]], who attempted unsuccessfully to take control of the paper. A protracted dispute ensued that at one point seemed likely to close the paper.<ref>For a detailed account of the Silkin takeover attempt, see articles by Chris Mullin, New Statesman, January 11 and 18, 1985.</ref>\n\n===Paper of the soft left===\nMullin left in 1984, with circulation at around 6,000, a level it roughly remained for the next ten years). He was replaced by his equally Bennite protege [[Nigel Williamson (UK journalist)|Nigel Williamson]], who surprised everyone by arguing for a realignment of the left and took the paper into the [[soft left]] camp, supporting Kinnock, a long-time ''Tribune'' contributor and onetime board member, as Labour leader against the Bennites. The next two editors [[Phil Kelly (UK journalist)|Phil Kelly]] and [[Paul Anderson (UK journalist)|Paul Anderson]] took much the same line, although both clashed with Kinnock, particularly over his decision to abandon Labour's non-nuclear defence policy.\n\nUnder Kelly, ''Tribune'' supported [[John Prescott]]'s challenge to [[Roy Hattersley]] as Labour Deputy leader in 1988 and came close to going bust, a fate averted by an emergency appeal launched by a front page exclaiming \"Don't let this be the last issue of ''Tribune''\". Under Anderson, the paper took a strongly pro-European stance, supported electoral reform and argued for military intervention against Serbian aggression in Croatia and Bosnia. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, ''Tribune'' acted as a clearing house for arguments inside the Labour Party, with contributions from all major players.\n\n===Back to basics===\nFrom 1993, [[Mark Seddon (UK journalist)|Mark Seddon]] shifted ''Tribune'' several degrees back to the left, particularly after [[Tony Blair]] became Labour leader in 1994. The paper strongly opposed Blair's abandonment of [[Clause Four]] of the Labour Party constitution and resisted his rebranding of the party as New Labour.\n\nAfter Labour won the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], the paper maintained an oppositionist stance, objecting to the Blair government's military interventions and its reliance on spin-doctors. In 2001, ''Tribune'' opposed the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|United States-led invasion of Afghanistan]] and it was outspoken against the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in 2003. The paper under Seddon also reverted to an anti-European position very similar to that it adopted in the 1970s and early 1980s and campaigned for Gordon Brown to replace Blair as Labour Leader and Prime Minister.\n\n''Tribune'' changed format from newspaper to magazine in 2001, but remained plagued by financial uncertainty, coming close to folding again in 2002.

While it is independent, it has usually supported the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. From 2009 to 2018, it faced serious financial difficulties until it was purchased by ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' in late 2018, shifting to a quarterly publication model.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Origins ===\n''Tribune'' was founded in early 1937 by two wealthy left-wing Labour Party [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs), [[Sir Stafford Cripps]] and [[George Strauss]], to back the [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)#The Unity Campaign|Unity Campaign]], an attempt to secure an anti-fascist and anti-appeasement [[United Front]] between the Labour Party and socialist parties to the left. The latter included Cripps's (Labour-affiliated) [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)|Socialist League]], the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) and the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB).\n\nThe paper's first editor was [[William Mellor (journalist)|William Mellor]]. Among its journalists were [[Michael Foot]] and Barbara Betts (later [[Barbara Castle]]), while the board included the Labour MPs [[Aneurin Bevan]] and [[Ellen Wilkinson]], [[Harold Laski]] of the [[Left Book Club]] and the veteran left-wing journalist and former ILP member [[H. N. Brailsford]].\n\nMellor was fired in 1938 for refusing to adopt a new CPGB policy\u2014supported by Cripps\u2014of backing a [[Popular Front]], including non-socialist parties, against fascism and appeasement; Foot resigned in solidarity. Mellor was succeeded by H. J. Hartshorn, a secret member of the CPGBP. Meanwhile [[Victor Gollancz]], the Left Book Club's publisher, joined the board of directors. For the next year, the paper was little more than an appendage of the Left Book Club, taking an uncritical line on the Popular Front and the Soviet Union.\n\n===1940s===\nWith the [[Nazi-Soviet pact]] and the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1939, ''Tribune'' initially adopted the CPGB's position of denouncing the British and French declarations of war on Germany as imperialist. After the Soviet invasion of Finland, with Cripps off on a world tour, Strauss and Bevan became increasingly impatient with Hartshorn's unrelenting [[Stalinism]]. Strauss fired Hartshorn in February 1940, replacing him as editor with [[Raymond Postgate]]. Under Postgate's editorship, the Soviet [[fellow travellers]] at ''Tribune'' were either dismissed, or in Postgate's words, \"left soon after in dislike of me\".<ref>Bill Jones, ''The Russia Complex: the British Labour Party and the Soviet Union'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1977,  {{ISBN|0719006961}}), pp. 48-49</ref> From then on, the paper became the voice of the pro-war democratic left in the Labour Party, taking a position similar to that adopted by Gollancz in the volume ''[[Betrayal of the Left]]'' he edited attacking the communists for backing the Nazi-Soviet pact,\n\n[[Image:Tribune flier 1941.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Early 1941 ''Tribune'' flier]]\nBevan ousted Postgate after a series of personality clashes in 1941, assuming the role of editor himself, although the day-to-day running of the paper was done by [[Jon Kimche]]. The Bevan-Kimche ''Tribune'' is revered as one of the greatest left-wing papers in British history. It campaigned vigorously for the opening of a second front against [[Adolf Hitler]]'s Germany, was consistently critical of the [[Winston Churchill]] government's failings, and argued that only a democratic socialist post-war settlement in Britain and Europe as a whole was viable.\n\n[[George Orwell]] was hired in 1943 as literary editor. In this role, as well as commissioning and writing reviews, he wrote a series of columns, most of them under the title \"[[As I Please]]\", that have become touchstones of the opinion journalist's craft. Orwell left the ''Tribune'' staff in early 1945 to become a war correspondent for ''[[The Observer]]'', to be replaced as literary editor by his friend [[Tosco Fyvel]], but he remained a regular contributor until March 1947.\n\nOrwell's most famous contributions to ''Tribune'' as a columnist include \"You and the atom bomb\", \"The sporting spirit\", \"Books v cigarettes\", \"[[Decline of the English Murder]]\" and \"[[Some Thoughts on the Common Toad]]\", all of which have since appeared in dozens of anthologies.\n\nOther writers who contributed to ''Tribune'' in the 1940s include [[Naomi Mitchison]], [[Stevie Smith]], [[Alex Comfort]], [[Arthur Calder-Marshall]], [[Julian Symons]], [[Elizabeth Taylor (novelist)|Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rhys Davies (writer)|Rhys Davies]], Daniel George, [[Inez Holden]], and [[Phyllis Shand Allfrey]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Lizabeth |last=Paravisini-Gebert |title=Phyllis Shand Allfrey: A Caribbean Life |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-8135-2265-X |page=61 }}</ref>\n\nKimche left ''Tribune'' to join Reuters in 1945, his place being taken by [[Frederic Mullally]]. After the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|Labour landslide election victory of 1945]], Bevan joined [[Clement Attlee]]'s government and formally left the paper, leaving Mullally and [[Evelyn Anderson]] as joint editors, with Foot playing Bevan's role of political director. Over the next five years, ''Tribune'' was critically involved in every key political event in the life of the Labour government and reached its highest-ever circulation, of some 40,000. Foot persuaded Kimche to return as joint editor in 1946 (after Mullally's departure to the [[Sunday Pictorial]]) and in 1948 himself became joint editor with Anderson, after Kimche was fired for disappearing from the office to travel to Istanbul to negotiate the safe passage of two Jewish refugee ships through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles.\n\nIn the first few years of the Attlee administration, ''Tribune'' became the focus for the Labour left's attempts to persuade [[Ernest Bevin]], the Foreign Secretary, to adopt a \"third force\" democratic socialist foreign policy, with Europe acting independently from the United States and the Soviet Union, most coherently advanced in the pamphlet ''[[Keep Left (pamphlet)|Keep Left]]'' (which was published by the rival ''[[New Statesman]]'').\n\nAfter the Soviet rejection of [[Marshall Aid]] and the communist takeover of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1948, ''Tribune'' endorsed the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and took a strongly anti-communist line, with its editor declaring in November 1948: \"The major threat to democratic socialism and the major danger of war in Europe arises from Soviet policy and not from American policy. It is not the Americans who have imposed a blockade on Berlin. It is not the Americans who have used conspiratorial methods to destroy democratic socialist parties in one country after another. It is not the Americans who have blocked effective action through one United Nations agency after another\".\n\n=== Bevanism and Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ===\nFoot remained in the editorial chair until 1952 when [[Bob Edwards (British journalist)|Bob Edwards]] took over, but he returned after losing his parliamentary seat in Plymouth in 1955. During the early 1950s, ''Tribune'' became the organ of the [[Bevanite]] left opposition to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leadership, turning against the United States over its handling of the Korean War, then arguing strongly against West German rearmament and nuclear arms. However, ''Tribune'' remained critical of the Soviet Union as it denounced Stalin on his death in 1953 and in 1956 opposed the Soviet suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] and the British government's [[Suez]] adventure. The paper and Bevan parted company after his \"naked into the conference chamber\" speech at the 1957 Labour Party conference. For the next five years, ''Tribune'' was at the forefront of the campaign to commit Labour to a non-nuclear defence policy, \"the official weekly of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]\" (CND) as the direct actionists in the peace movement put it. CND's general secretary [[Peggy Duff]] had been ''Tribune'' general manager. Among journalists on ''Tribune'' in the 1950s were [[Richard Clements (journalist)|Richard Clements]], [[Ian Aitken (journalist)|Ian Aitken]] and [[Mervyn Jones (UK journalist)|Mervyn Jones]], who related his experience on the paper in his autobiography ''Chances''.\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\nAfter Foot was re-elected to Parliament in 1960 for Bevan's old seat of [[Ebbw Vale]], Richard Clements became editor. During the 1960s and 1970s the paper faithfully expressed the ideas of the parliamentary Labour left and allied itself with the new generation of left-wing trade union leaders that emerged on the back of a wave of workplace militancy from the early 1960s onwards.\n\nAs such, it played a massive role in the politics of the time. Although it welcomed the election of Harold Wilson's Labour government in 1964\u2014\"Tribune takes over from Eton in the cabinet\", exclaimed a headline\u2014the paper became rapidly disillusioned. It denounced the Wilson government's timidity on nationalisation and devaluation, opposed its moves to join the [[European Communities]] (EC) and attacked it for failing to take a principled position against the [[Vietnam War]]. It also backed the unions' campaigns against the government's prices-and-incomes policies and against ''[[In Place of Strife]]'', Barbara Castle's 1969 package of trade union law reforms.\n\nThe paper continued in the same vein after [[Edward Heath]] won the 1970 general election, opposing his Tory government's trade union legislation between 1970 and 1974 and placing itself at the head of opposition to Heath's negotiations for Britain to join the EEC. After Labour regained power in 1974, ''Tribune'' played a central part in the \"no\" campaign in the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum on British EEC membership]].\n\nHowever, ''Tribune'' in this period did not speak to, let alone represent, the concerns of the younger generation of leftists who were at the centre of the campaign against the Vietnam War and the post-1968 student revolt, who found the paper's reformism and commitment to Labour tame and old-fashioned. Circulation, around 20,000 in 1960, was said by 1980 to be around 10,000, but it was in fact much less.\n\n===Brief support of Tony Benn===\nClements resigned as editor in 1982 to become a political adviser to Foot (by now Labour leader), a role he continued under Foot's successor as Labour leader, [[Neil Kinnock]]. Clements was succeeded in the ''Tribune'' chair by [[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]], who steered the paper into supporting [[Tony Benn]] (then just past the peak of his influence on the Labour left) and attempted to turn it into a friendly society in which readers were invited to buy shares, much to the consternation of the old Bevanite shareholders, most prominent among them [[John Silkin]] and [[Donald Bruce, Baron Bruce of Donington|Donald Bruce]], who attempted unsuccessfully to take control of the paper. A protracted dispute ensued that at one point seemed likely to close the paper.<ref>For a detailed account of the Silkin takeover attempt, see articles by Chris Mullin, New Statesman, January 11 and 18, 1985.</ref>\n\n===Paper of the soft left===\nMullin left in 1984, with circulation at around 6,000, a level it roughly remained for the next ten years). He was replaced by his equally Bennite protege [[Nigel Williamson (UK journalist)|Nigel Williamson]], who surprised everyone by arguing for a realignment of the left and took the paper into the [[soft left]] camp, supporting Kinnock, a long-time ''Tribune'' contributor and onetime board member, as Labour leader against the Bennites. The next two editors [[Phil Kelly (UK journalist)|Phil Kelly]] and [[Paul Anderson (UK journalist)|Paul Anderson]] took much the same line, although both clashed with Kinnock, particularly over his decision to abandon Labour's non-nuclear defence policy.\n\nUnder Kelly, ''Tribune'' supported [[John Prescott]]'s challenge to [[Roy Hattersley]] as Labour Deputy leader in 1988 and came close to going bust, a fate averted by an emergency appeal launched by a front page exclaiming \"Don't let this be the last issue of ''Tribune''\". Under Anderson, the paper took a strongly pro-European stance, supported electoral reform and argued for military intervention against Serbian aggression in Croatia and Bosnia. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, ''Tribune'' acted as a clearing house for arguments inside the Labour Party, with contributions from all major players.\n\n===Back to basics===\nFrom 1993, [[Mark Seddon (UK journalist)|Mark Seddon]] shifted ''Tribune'' several degrees back to the left, particularly after [[Tony Blair]] became Labour leader in 1994. The paper strongly opposed Blair's abandonment of [[Clause Four]] of the Labour Party constitution and resisted his rebranding of the party as New Labour.\n\nAfter Labour won the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], the paper maintained an oppositionist stance, objecting to the Blair government's military interventions and its reliance on spin-doctors. In 2001, ''Tribune'' opposed the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|United States-led invasion of Afghanistan]] and it was outspoken against the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in 2003. The paper under Seddon also reverted to an anti-European position very similar to that it adopted in the 1970s and early 1980s and campaigned for Gordon Brown to replace Blair as Labour Leader and Prime Minister.\n\n''Tribune'' changed format from newspaper to magazine in 2001, but remained plagued by financial uncertainty, coming close to folding again in 2002. However, Seddon and Chairman of Tribune Publications, the Labour MP [[Peter Kilfoyle]] led a team of pro-bono advisers who organised a rescue package with a consortium of trade unions ([[UNISON|Unison]], [[Amicus (trade union)|Amicus]], [[Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen|Aslef]],<ref name=\"Plunkett\">John Plunkett, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/09/pressandpublishing \"Tribune set to close by November\"], ''The Guardian'', 9 October 2008.

Seddon resigned as editor in summer 2004 and was succeeded by [[Chris McLaughlin (UK journalist)|Chris McLaughlin]], former political editor of the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]''.\n\nDuring 2007, ''Tribune'' spawned two offshoot websites, a Tribune Cartoons blog, put together by cartoonists who draw for the magazine; and a ''Tribune'' History blog.\n\nIn September 2008, the magazine's future was again in doubt thanks to problems with its trade union funding.
