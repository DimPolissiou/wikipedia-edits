It is primarily a [[video game franchise]], with the franchise's other forms of media including several [[List of Mario television series|television series]] and a [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|feature film]]. It was originally created by game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] with the arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', released on July 9, 1981. The games have been developed by a variety of developers including Nintendo, [[Hudson Soft]], and [[AlphaDream Corporation|AlphaDream]]. Most ''Mario'' games have been released for Nintendo's various video game consoles and handhelds, from the [[Third generation of video game consoles|third generation]] onward.\n\nThe main series in the franchise is the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series of [[platform game|platform games]] which mostly follows Mario's adventures in the fictional world of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. These games typically rely on Mario's jumping ability to allow him to progress through [[Level (video gaming)|levels]]. The franchise has spawned more than 200 games of various genres and series, including ''[[Mario Kart]]'', ''[[Mario Party]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', and ''[[Mario Golf (video game)|Mario Golf]]''.\n\nThe ''Mario'' series is one of Nintendo's most renowned and successful franchises; many games in its series, specifically the \"Super Mario\" portion, are considered to be some of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games ever made]]. By 2011, the core ''Super Mario'' video games had grossed an estimated {{US$|12 billion}} in sales.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ryan|first1=Jeff|title=Super Mario: How Nintendo Conquered America|date=2011|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=9781101517635|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1k-6ksl3uLsC&pg=PT8|language=en}}</ref> More than 600 million copies of ''Mario'' games have been sold, making it the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchise of all time]]. It is also the 9th [[List of highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing media franchise]] of all time, with an estimated revenue above {{US$|36 billion|long=no}}.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Characters ==\n{{Main|List of Mario franchise characters}}\n\n== Video games ==\n{{Main|List of video games featuring Mario}}\n\n=== Origin games ===\n\n==== ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' ====\n{{Main|Donkey Kong (video game)}}\n[[File:Donkey Kong arcade.png|thumb|125px|A replica of a ''Donkey Kong'' arcade cabinet.]]\n\nAfter the commercial failure of ''[[Radar Scope]]'', Nintendo's company president referred to [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] to create an arcade game to save the company. Miyamoto came up with the idea of a game in which the playable character has to make his way through an obstacle course consisting of sloped platforms, ladders and rolling barrels. Miyamoto named the game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and its main protagonist \"Jumpman\". ''Donkey Kong'' is an early example of the [[platform game|platform]] genre. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game gives the player a [[score (gaming)|score]]. Points are awarded for finishing screens; leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer [[power-up]]; collecting items such as hats, [[parasol]]s, and [[Coin purse|purse]]s (presumably belonging to the Lady/Pauline); and completing other tasks. The game was surprisingly successful.<ref>{{Cite news|date=June 1994|title=|periodical=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|issue=61|pages=}}</ref> \"Jumpman\" was called \"[[Mario]]\" in certain promotional materials for the game's release overseas;<ref name=\"US Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=316&image=2 |title= Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Nintendo |work= The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate= October 29, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"France Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=2950&image=2 |title=Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Karateco |work=The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref> his namesake was [[Mario Segale]], the landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]'s office/warehouse, who barged in on a meeting to demand an overdue rent payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Mario Fun Facts!|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2007/09/22/10-mario-fun-facts/|accessdate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> Eventually Jumpman's name was internationally and permanently changed to Mario. The success of the game spawned several ports, and a sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'', which is Mario's only appearance as an antagonist. ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'' did not feature Mario.\n\n==== ''Mario Bros.'' ====\n{{Main|Mario Bros.}}\n\nThe ''Mario'' branding was used for the first time in a later arcade game, ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', which introduced Mario's brother, [[Luigi]]. The objective of ''Mario Bros.'' is to defeat all of the enemies in each [[Level (video gaming)|phase]]. Each phase is a series of platforms with four pipes at each corner of the screen, and an object called a \"POW\" block in the center.<ref name=\"NESpg5\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 5 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref><ref name=\"NESpg8\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 8 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref> The mechanics of ''Mario Bros.'' involve only running and jumping. Unlike future ''Mario'' titles, players cannot jump on enemies until they are flipped over; this can be accomplished by jumping under the platform they are on or by using the \"POW\" block. Both sides of every phase feature a mechanism that allows the player to go off-screen to the left and appear on the right, and vice versa.<ref name=\"NESpg8\" /> The game has since reappeared in various forms, including as a minigame in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and the ''[[Super Mario Advance]]'' series, and reimagined as ''[[Mario Clash]]''.\n\n==== Game & Watch ====\n{{Main|List of LCD games featuring Mario}}\n\n[[Nintendo]] has released several ''Mario'' and ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' LCD video games for the [[Game & Watch series|Game & Watch line]]. Eleven were released between 1982 and 1994. Nintendo also licensed the release of six LCD games for [[Nelsonic Industries|Nelsonic]]'s Game Watch line between 1989 and 1994. Many remakes of Game & Watch games have changed the protagonist from a generic [[Game & Watch#Mr. Game & Watch|Mr. Game & Watch]] character to Mario.\n\n=== Platform games ===\n==== ''Super Mario'' series ====\n{{Main|Super Mario}}\nMario then became the star of his own side scrolling platform game in [[1985 in video gaming|1985]], titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', which was the pack-in game included with the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] console. It was also later sold in a package with ''[[Duck Hunt]]''. In [[Japan]], a game titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' was released in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]], but a different [[Super Mario Bros. 2|game with the same name]] was released internationally in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]], followed by ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' later that same year. The Japanese version would subsequently be released in the United States in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] under the title ''Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels'' as part of the ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' title for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], a console that also features iterations of the game known as ''[[Super Mario World]]''. While ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and two sequels were the [[Game Boy]] installments in the series, the [[Game Boy Advance]] did not receive any original entries, only [[Video game remake|remakes]]. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' debuted as the launch title for the [[Nintendo 64]] console in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]]. ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' was the series' entry for the [[GameCube]], and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its [[Super Mario Galaxy 2|sequel]] continued the franchise for the [[Wii]]. ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' was the series' flagship title for [[Nintendo 3DS]]. The [[Wii U]] saw the release of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' would be the first original game in the series to be released on the [[Nintendo Switch]], and was released in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2017/11/8/16621744/the-best-mario-games|title=Ranking the core Super Mario games|first=Jeremy | last=Parish | date=November 8, 2017 | accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, a [[Retrogaming#Modern retrogaming|retro]] throwback sub-series called ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' was inaugurated on the Nintendo DS, featuring the mechanics of the ''Super Mario Bros.'' games.

This gameplay is further offered by the level creator game ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'', released on [[Wii U]] in 2015. A sequel, ''[[Super Mario Maker 2]]'', was released on Nintendo Switch in June 2019.\n\nIn 2016, the team behind ''New Super Mario Bros.'' released ''[[Super Mario Run]]'' that became Nintendo's first real [[smartphone]] game and one of the few instances a ''Mario'' game was developed for non-Nintendo hardware.<ref name=\"MarioRun\">{{cite web|last1=Ingraham|first1=Nathan|title='Super Mario Run' is just as much fun as we'd hoped|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/08/super-mario-run-iphone-hands-on/|publisher=Engadet|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Puzzle games ===\n{{Main|List of Mario puzzle games}}\n\n==== ''Dr. Mario'' series ====\n[[File:Dr. Mario series logo.png|thumb|The ''Dr. Mario'' series logo.]]\n\n{{nihongo foot|'''''Dr. Mario'''''|\u30c9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa|Dokut\u0101 Mario|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} (stylized as ''D\u211e.

The player progresses through the game by eliminating all the viruses on the screen in each [[level (video gaming)|level]].\n\n<!-- Titles -->\nThere have been 4 ''[[Dr. Mario]]'' games released for home consoles and two portable games, for a total of six original titles.

These games did not use the ''Mario'' branding and only featured Mario in the capacity of a cameo. He then appeared in ''[[Mario's Tennis]]'' for the Virtual Boy. After this, [[Camelot Software Planning]] released ''[[Mario Tennis]]'' for the Nintendo 64. They would subsequently develop other games in this series: ''[[Mario Power Tennis]]'' for the GameCube and Wii, ''[[Mario Tennis: Power Tour|Power Tour]]'' for the Game Boy Advance, ''[[Mario Tennis Open]]'' for the Nintendo 3DS, ''[[Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash|Ultra Smash]]'' for the Wii U, and ''[[Mario Tennis Aces|Aces]]'' for the Nintendo Switch.\n\n==== ''Mario Golf'' series ====\nThe first use of Mario's likeness in a golf game was that the golfer in ''[[Golf (1984 video game)|Golf]]'' for NES and Game Boy featured a mustached man resembling Mario. Later, ''[[NES Open Tournament Golf]]'' was released. It featured Mario and Luigi as the golfers, with [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]] and [[Princess Daisy]] as their caddies.

Few of these games were platformers; most sought to teach skills such as typing, mathematics or history. They are officially licensed but not officially recognized by Nintendo. The games were developed independently by Software Toolworks, Interplay and Brainstorm. Nine educational games were released from 1991 to 1996.\n\n=== Games not published by Nintendo ===\nThis section covers games [[Video game developer|developed]] by other companies without Nintendo involvement.

It is similar to the original ''Mario Bros.'', but featured a new gameplay mechanic of \"punch balls\", small balls which [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] can kick into enemies to stun them, instead of hitting them from below, as in the original.\n\nHudson Soft was originally responsible for the ''Mario Party'' series until ''[[Mario Party DS]]'' in 2007, but as of March 2012 this has been taken over by [[Nd Cube]] since Hudson has become a part of [[Konami]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Konami acquiring Hudson|url=http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724081748/http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|archivedate=July 24, 2012}}</ref> Many of Hudson's employees now work for Nd Cube.\n\n==== Philips ====\nThree games were planned for development by [[Philips|Philips Interactive Media]] for use on its [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] machine: ''[[Super Mario's Wacky Worlds]]'', ''[[Hotel Mario]]'', and ''Mario Takes America''. Only ''Hotel Mario'' was released; ''Super Mario's Wacky Worlds'' and ''Mario Takes America'' were eventually cancelled.

Though the game [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] are based on those in ''Super Mario World'', the level design is based on Earth locations rather than Dinosaur Land. Due to the limitations of the CD-i, several features could not be included in the game, such as large numbers of sprites on the screen, and many visual effects. The nature of the pointing device controller provides difficult controls for Mario, as the game has the default controls of running and jumping.\n\n''Mario Takes America'' was proposed about Mario's trip to Hollywood to make his own movie. The game's concept initially impressed Philips, but was cancelled due to the company being unsatisfied with the game's development progress.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Cancelled Mario Game That Was Taken Away By A Bank In Canada|url=https://www.unseen64.net/2014/09/15/mario-takes-america-cdi-cancelled/|website=Unseen64|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Hotel Mario'' is a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] developed by Fantasy Factory and published by Philips Interactive Media for the CD-i in 1994. The primary characters of the game are [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who must find [[Princess Peach]] by going through seven [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]] Hotels in the Mushroom Kingdom. Every hotel is divided into multiple stages, and the objective is to close all doors on each stage. The game has been criticized as one of the worst ''Mario''-centered games, mainly because of its [[cutscene]]s and simple gameplay.<ref name=\"instructions2\">{{cite book|year=1994|title=Hotel Mario instruction book|publisher=Philips Interactive Media|id=PP0260 GA|page=3}}</ref><ref name=\"EG\">{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Whitehead|title=The History of Mario|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-history-of-mario-article?page=3|date=March 9, 2007|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=June 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Ubisoft Milan ====\n\n''[[Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle]]'' is a [[turn-based]] [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Milan]] (Ubisoft's Italian studio division) for the Nintendo Switch. The game is a [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] with Ubisoft's ''[[Raving Rabbids]]'' franchise, and features both singleplayer and [[local cooperative|cooperative]] multiplayer gameplay. The game's story sees players controlling Mario, his friends, and a group of Rabbids dressed as them, dealing with the aftermath of a sudden invasion by a group of Rabbids, who have accidentally misused a powerful invention that has brought chaos to the Mushroom Kingdom. Shigeru Miyamoto was initially impressed by the prototype of the game, that was presented to him by creative director Davide Soliani in 2014, which later caused Nintendo to greenlight the game for a Nintendo Switch release. It was released in Europe and North America on August 29, 2017, and was met with generally favorable reception from critics, who praised its gameplay, depth, and graphics.\n\n==== Others ====\n[[Electronic Arts]] developed and released ''[[NBA Street V3]]'' and ''[[SSX on Tour]]'' in 2005, both of which included Mario, Luigi, and Peach as playable characters in the GameCube versions.\n\n== Other media ==\n{{Main|List of non-video game media featuring Mario}}\nThe ''Mario'' franchise includes many comics, manga and TV series based on the games. Most were released in the late 1980s to early 1990s, and have since become obscure. Mario, Luigi and Peach have made cameo appearances in two sports games, including the [[GameCube]] version of ''[[NBA Street V3]]''. The series launched two films, the [[anime]] ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen]]'' released in 1986 and the [[live action]] film ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'' in 1993. The latter lost a large amount of money at the box office and was widely considered to be a [[Box office bomb|failure]].<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. 1993\">{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=supermariobros.htm |title=Super Mario Bros.

It aired on [[NBC]] from September 8 to December 1, 1990. Based on the ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' video game, the cartoon shows Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool and Toad fighting against Bowser and his [[Koopalings]], who went by different names on the show (Hip, Hop, Kooky, Kootie Pie, Big Mouth, Cheatsy, and Bully). Like the previous Mario cartoon series, the animation was done by Sei Young Animation Co. Ltd, however this show was co-produced by Reteitalia S.P.A., hence the slight differences in character design.\n\n''[[Super Mario Challenge]]'' was a show which aired on [[The Children's Channel]]. It ran from 1990 to 1991 and aired at 4:30&nbsp;p.m. every weekday. The presenter, [[John Lenahan]], was a lookalike of [[Mario]], and dressed in his clothes. Two guest players had to do tasks, all of which involved playing the ''Mario'' video games ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and, after its release in 1991, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''. Rounds included challenges to see which player could complete a level in the fastest time and who could collect the most gold coins on a certain level.\n\n''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'' is an [[Cartoon series|animated television series]] based on the [[Super Mario World|SNES video game of the same name]].

The show was originally aired on Saturday mornings on [[NBC]] in the 1991\u201392 season. It was featured in a half-hour time slot with a shortened version of ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]''.

Afterwards, the series was split from ''Captain N'' altogether and shown in time-compressed reruns on ''Mario All-Stars''.\n\n=== Anime ===\n''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!]]'' is a [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] film released on July 20, 1986. Directed by Masami Hata and produced by Masakatsu Suzuki and Tsunemasa Hatano, it stars [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who get stuck in a [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] [[video game]], in which they must save [[Princess Peach]] from [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]]. A [[manga]] adaptation of the film was published in Japan around the same time as the film's release.\n\nA series of three [[Original video animation|OVA]] episodes titled ''[[Amada Anime Series: Super Mario Bros.]]'', based on ''[[Momotar\u014d]]'', ''[[Issun-b\u014dshi]]'' and ''[[Snow White]]'', were released on August 3, 1989.

It was part of a licensing deal with [[Nintendo]], featuring characters from their [[video game]]s and the [[cartoon]]s based on them. Valiant's ''Super Mario Bros.'' comic books were based on the three main ''Mario'' games on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], as well as ''[[Super Mario Bros. (TV)|The Super Mario Bros. Super Show]]''. The ''Mario'' line was renewed for 1991 with two different books\u2014''Super Mario Bros.'' and ''Adventures of the Super Mario Bros.''\n\nThe ''[[Nintendo Adventure Book]]'' series was published from 1991 to 1992 by Archway books, and Mammoth books in the [[United Kingdom]]. There are twelve in all. They are formatted like the popular [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] books, where the reader makes decisions that change the outcome of the story. Ten of the books are about the [[Mario Bros.]]' adventures in the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] and are based primarily on the [[Valiant Comics|Valiant comics]] published for the [[Nintendo Comics System]] imprint.\n\n{{nihongo foot|''[[Super Mario Adventures]]''|SUPER MARIO ADVENTURES \u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u306e\u5927\u5192\u967a|''Mario no daib\u014dken''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha|<ref>\"[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006QBMK0 Super Mario Adventures Official Nintendo Comic Book (Paperback)].\" ''Amazon.com''.

A 1996 article in ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' declared that \"The evolution of the ''Mario'' series led the rest of gaming by the hand, blazing a trail, and teaching lessons in game mechanics, structure, and sheer playability to any who would study its secrets\".\n\n== Setting ==\nMost of Mario's games are set in the fictional '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', but there are other settings which explore more details of the Mario Universe.\n\nThe places introduced in the ''Mario'' franchise are:\n\n* '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', the central kingdom of the universe and the setting of most Mario games. It is usually ruled by '''[[Princess Peach]]'''. The capital of the kingdom is '''Toad Town''', a city that lies below Peach's Castle.\n* '''Subcon''' is the dreamworld that is the setting of [[Super Mario Bros. 2]].\n* '''Bowser's Kingdom''', the kingdom ruled by '''[[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]''', the main antagonist of the series. The kingdom has appeared in several games under different names, and often appears as the final level of the game which it is featured in. The first time this kingdom appears under the name Bowser's Kingdom is in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''.\n* '''Sprixie Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', is home to fairy-like creatures called '''Sprixies'''. It is composed of 8 islands with different themes, with each island being ruled by a Sprixie. It is the main setting of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n* '''Kingdom of Bask''', introduced in ''[[Mario Tennis Aces]]'', the Kingdom of Bask was ruled by '''King Bask''' until '''Lucien''', the main antagonist of the game, attacked it, forcing King Bask to split his power into Power Stones. It is the main setting of ''Mario Tennis Aces''.\n* '''Sarasaland''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Land]]'', is ruled by '''[[Princess Daisy]]''', and is divided into four kingdoms: '''Birabuto Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient Egypt]]), '''Muda Kingdom''' (based on Mu and [[Bermuda]]), '''Easton Kingdom''' (based on Easter Island) and '''Chai Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient China]]). It is the main setting of ''Super Mario Land''.\n* '''Beanbean Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'', is governed by '''Queen Bean''' and his son '''Prince Peasley'''. The capital is '''Beanbean Castle Town''', and the kingdom is known to have good relations with the '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', in addition to bordering it. The regions are named after laughter onomatopoeias. Just like the Mushroom Kingdom is mushroom themed, the Beanbean Kingdom is bean themed. It is also home to the famous '''Chuckola Cola'''. The forest where it is produced is named '''Chucklehuck Woods'''. It is the main setting of ''Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga''.\n* '''Pi'illo Island''', formerly known as '''Pi'illo Kingdom''', is introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', and is an island that was ruled by '''Prince Dreambert''' until he and the other Pi'illos were imprisoned by '''Antasma''', the main antagonist of the game. At some undefined time in the past, the island was acquired by '''Dr. Snoozemore'''. At the end of the game, with all the Pi'illos released, the island is once again governed by '''Prince Dreambert.''' It is the main setting of ''Mario & Luigi: Dream Team''.\n* '''Isle Delfino''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', is a [[dolphin]]-shaped paradise island somewhere outside the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. It's the setting for ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. The capital is '''Delfino Plaza'''.\n* ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' introduces a variety of new locations such as the '''Cap Kingdom''', '''Cascade Kingdom''', '''Metro Kingdom''' and '''Luncheon Kingdom''', just to name a few.\n\n== Impact and legacy ==\nMario has been featured in 256 games of various genres (including sports, puzzle, party, racing and first-person shooter), and the ''Mario'' franchise is the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchise of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html |title=Italian Plumber More Memorable Than Harper, Dion |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |date=December 13, 2007 |publisher=CNW Group |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911224500/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html |url-status=dead |archivedate=September 11, 2009 }}</ref> At least 31 different ''Mario'' games have sold more than a million copies each since 1995.

Miyamoto came up with the idea of a game in which the playable character has to make his way through an obstacle course consisting of sloped platforms, ladders and rolling barrels. Miyamoto named the game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and its main protagonist \"Jumpman\". ''Donkey Kong'' is an early example of the [[platform game|platform]] genre. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game gives the player a [[score (gaming)|score]]. Points are awarded for finishing screens; leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer [[power-up]]; collecting items such as hats, [[parasol]]s, and [[Coin purse|purse]]s (presumably belonging to the Lady/Pauline); and completing other tasks. The game was surprisingly successful.<ref>{{Cite news|date=June 1994|title=|periodical=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|issue=61|pages=}}</ref> \"Jumpman\" was called \"[[Mario]]\" in certain promotional materials for the game's release overseas;<ref name=\"US Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=316&image=2 |title= Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Nintendo |work= The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate= October 29, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"France Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=2950&image=2 |title=Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Karateco |work=The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref> his namesake was [[Mario Segale]], the landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]'s office/warehouse, who barged in on a meeting to demand an overdue rent payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Mario Fun Facts!|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2007/09/22/10-mario-fun-facts/|accessdate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> Eventually Jumpman's name was internationally and permanently changed to Mario. The success of the game spawned several ports, and a sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'', which is Mario's only appearance as an antagonist. ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'' did not feature Mario.\n\n==== ''Mario Bros.'' ====\n{{Main|Mario Bros.}}\n\nThe ''Mario'' branding was used for the first time in a later arcade game, ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', which introduced Mario's brother, [[Luigi]]. The objective of ''Mario Bros.'' is to defeat all of the enemies in each [[Level (video gaming)|phase]]. Each phase is a series of platforms with four pipes at each corner of the screen, and an object called a \"POW\" block in the center.<ref name=\"NESpg5\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 5 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref><ref name=\"NESpg8\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 8 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref> The mechanics of ''Mario Bros.'' involve only running and jumping. Unlike future ''Mario'' titles, players cannot jump on enemies until they are flipped over; this can be accomplished by jumping under the platform they are on or by using the \"POW\" block. Both sides of every phase feature a mechanism that allows the player to go off-screen to the left and appear on the right, and vice versa.<ref name=\"NESpg8\" /> The game has since reappeared in various forms, including as a minigame in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and the ''[[Super Mario Advance]]'' series, and reimagined as ''[[Mario Clash]]''.\n\n==== Game & Watch ====\n{{Main|List of LCD games featuring Mario}}\n\n[[Nintendo]] has released several ''Mario'' and ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' LCD video games for the [[Game & Watch series|Game & Watch line]]. Eleven were released between 1982 and 1994. Nintendo also licensed the release of six LCD games for [[Nelsonic Industries|Nelsonic]]'s Game Watch line between 1989 and 1994. Many remakes of Game & Watch games have changed the protagonist from a generic [[Game & Watch#Mr. Game & Watch|Mr. Game & Watch]] character to Mario.\n\n=== Platform games ===\n==== ''Super Mario'' series ====\n{{Main|Super Mario}}\nMario then became the star of his own side scrolling platform game in [[1985 in video gaming|1985]], titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', which was the pack-in game included with the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] console. It was also later sold in a package with ''[[Duck Hunt]]''. In [[Japan]], a game titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' was released in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]], but a different [[Super Mario Bros. 2|game with the same name]] was released internationally in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]], followed by ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' later that same year. The Japanese version would subsequently be released in the United States in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] under the title ''Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels'' as part of the ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' title for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], a console that also features iterations of the game known as ''[[Super Mario World]]''. While ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and two sequels were the [[Game Boy]] installments in the series, the [[Game Boy Advance]] did not receive any original entries, only [[Video game remake|remakes]]. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' debuted as the launch title for the [[Nintendo 64]] console in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]]. ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' was the series' entry for the [[GameCube]], and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its [[Super Mario Galaxy 2|sequel]] continued the franchise for the [[Wii]]. ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' was the series' flagship title for [[Nintendo 3DS]]. The [[Wii U]] saw the release of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' would be the first original game in the series to be released on the [[Nintendo Switch]], and was released in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2017/11/8/16621744/the-best-mario-games|title=Ranking the core Super Mario games|first=Jeremy | last=Parish | date=November 8, 2017 | accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, a [[Retrogaming#Modern retrogaming|retro]] throwback sub-series called ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' was inaugurated on the Nintendo DS, featuring the mechanics of the ''Super Mario Bros.'' games.

Few of these games were platformers; most sought to teach skills such as typing, mathematics or history. They are officially licensed but not officially recognized by Nintendo. The games were developed independently by Software Toolworks, Interplay and Brainstorm. Nine educational games were released from 1991 to 1996.\n\n=== Games not published by Nintendo ===\nThis section covers games [[Video game developer|developed]] by other companies without Nintendo involvement.

It is similar to the original ''Mario Bros.'', but featured a new gameplay mechanic of \"punch balls\", small balls which [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] can kick into enemies to stun them, instead of hitting them from below, as in the original.\n\nHudson Soft was originally responsible for the ''Mario Party'' series until ''[[Mario Party DS]]'' in 2007, but as of March 2012 this has been taken over by [[Nd Cube]] since Hudson has become a part of [[Konami]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Konami acquiring Hudson|url=http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724081748/http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|archivedate=July 24, 2012}}</ref> Many of Hudson's employees now work for Nd Cube.\n\n==== Philips ====\nThree games were planned for development by [[Philips|Philips Interactive Media]] for use on its [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] machine: ''[[Super Mario's Wacky Worlds]]'', ''[[Hotel Mario]]'', and ''Mario Takes America''. Only ''Hotel Mario'' was released; ''Super Mario's Wacky Worlds'' and ''Mario Takes America'' were eventually cancelled.

Though the game [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] are based on those in ''Super Mario World'', the level design is based on Earth locations rather than Dinosaur Land. Due to the limitations of the CD-i, several features could not be included in the game, such as large numbers of sprites on the screen, and many visual effects. The nature of the pointing device controller provides difficult controls for Mario, as the game has the default controls of running and jumping.\n\n''Mario Takes America'' was proposed about Mario's trip to Hollywood to make his own movie. The game's concept initially impressed Philips, but was cancelled due to the company being unsatisfied with the game's development progress.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Cancelled Mario Game That Was Taken Away By A Bank In Canada|url=https://www.unseen64.net/2014/09/15/mario-takes-america-cdi-cancelled/|website=Unseen64|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Hotel Mario'' is a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] developed by Fantasy Factory and published by Philips Interactive Media for the CD-i in 1994. The primary characters of the game are [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who must find [[Princess Peach]] by going through seven [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]] Hotels in the Mushroom Kingdom. Every hotel is divided into multiple stages, and the objective is to close all doors on each stage. The game has been criticized as one of the worst ''Mario''-centered games, mainly because of its [[cutscene]]s and simple gameplay.<ref name=\"instructions2\">{{cite book|year=1994|title=Hotel Mario instruction book|publisher=Philips Interactive Media|id=PP0260 GA|page=3}}</ref><ref name=\"EG\">{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Whitehead|title=The History of Mario|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-history-of-mario-article?page=3|date=March 9, 2007|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=June 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Ubisoft Milan ====\n\n''[[Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle]]'' is a [[turn-based]] [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Milan]] (Ubisoft's Italian studio division) for the Nintendo Switch. The game is a [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] with Ubisoft's ''[[Raving Rabbids]]'' franchise, and features both singleplayer and [[local cooperative|cooperative]] multiplayer gameplay. The game's story sees players controlling Mario, his friends, and a group of Rabbids dressed as them, dealing with the aftermath of a sudden invasion by a group of Rabbids, who have accidentally misused a powerful invention that has brought chaos to the Mushroom Kingdom. Shigeru Miyamoto was initially impressed by the prototype of the game, that was presented to him by creative director Davide Soliani in 2014, which later caused Nintendo to greenlight the game for a Nintendo Switch release. It was released in Europe and North America on August 29, 2017, and was met with generally favorable reception from critics, who praised its gameplay, depth, and graphics.\n\n==== Others ====\n[[Electronic Arts]] developed and released ''[[NBA Street V3]]'' and ''[[SSX on Tour]]'' in 2005, both of which included Mario, Luigi, and Peach as playable characters in the GameCube versions.\n\n== Other media ==\n{{Main|List of non-video game media featuring Mario}}\nThe ''Mario'' franchise includes many comics, manga and TV series based on the games. Most were released in the late 1980s to early 1990s, and have since become obscure. Mario, Luigi and Peach have made cameo appearances in two sports games, including the [[GameCube]] version of ''[[NBA Street V3]]''. The series launched two films, the [[anime]] ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen]]'' released in 1986 and the [[live action]] film ''[[Super Mario Bros.

The show starred King Koopa (also known as [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]), the main antagonist of the ''Mario'' series. The 30-minute program was originally broadcast during the after-school afternoon time-slots on [[Los Angeles]]-based [[KTTV|KTTV Fox 11]].\n\n''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' is the second TV series based on the ''Mario'' NES games. It aired on [[NBC]] from September 8 to December 1, 1990. Based on the ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' video game, the cartoon shows Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool and Toad fighting against Bowser and his [[Koopalings]], who went by different names on the show (Hip, Hop, Kooky, Kootie Pie, Big Mouth, Cheatsy, and Bully). Like the previous Mario cartoon series, the animation was done by Sei Young Animation Co. Ltd, however this show was co-produced by Reteitalia S.P.A., hence the slight differences in character design.\n\n''[[Super Mario Challenge]]'' was a show which aired on [[The Children's Channel]]. It ran from 1990 to 1991 and aired at 4:30&nbsp;p.m. every weekday. The presenter, [[John Lenahan]], was a lookalike of [[Mario]], and dressed in his clothes. Two guest players had to do tasks, all of which involved playing the ''Mario'' video games ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and, after its release in 1991, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''. Rounds included challenges to see which player could complete a level in the fastest time and who could collect the most gold coins on a certain level.\n\n''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'' is an [[Cartoon series|animated television series]] based on the [[Super Mario World|SNES video game of the same name]]. It is the third and currently last [[Saturday morning cartoons|Saturday morning cartoon]] based on the ''Mario'' series. The show was originally aired on Saturday mornings on [[NBC]] in the 1991\u201392 season. It was featured in a half-hour time slot with a shortened version of ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]''. Episodes of ''Super Mario World'' were later shown as part of the [[Television syndication|syndication]] package ''Captain N and the Video Game Masters''. Afterwards, the series was split from ''Captain N'' altogether and shown in time-compressed reruns on ''Mario All-Stars''.\n\n=== Anime ===\n''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!]]'' is a [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] film released on July 20, 1986. Directed by Masami Hata and produced by Masakatsu Suzuki and Tsunemasa Hatano, it stars [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who get stuck in a [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] [[video game]], in which they must save [[Princess Peach]] from [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]]. A [[manga]] adaptation of the film was published in Japan around the same time as the film's release.\n\nA series of three [[Original video animation|OVA]] episodes titled ''[[Amada Anime Series: Super Mario Bros.]]'', based on ''[[Momotar\u014d]]'', ''[[Issun-b\u014dshi]]'' and ''[[Snow White]]'', were released on August 3, 1989.

Miyamoto found Meledandri's creative process similar to his own, and decided he would be the proper lead for a Mario film.

A 1996 article in ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' declared that \"The evolution of the ''Mario'' series led the rest of gaming by the hand, blazing a trail, and teaching lessons in game mechanics, structure, and sheer playability to any who would study its secrets\".\n\n== Setting ==\nMost of Mario's games are set in the fictional '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', but there are other settings which explore more details of the Mario Universe.\n\nThe places introduced in the ''Mario'' franchise are:\n\n* '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', the central kingdom of the universe and the setting of most Mario games. It is usually ruled by '''[[Princess Peach]]'''. The capital of the kingdom is '''Toad Town''', a city that lies below Peach's Castle.\n* '''Subcon''' is the dreamworld that is the setting of [[Super Mario Bros. 2]].\n* '''Bowser's Kingdom''', the kingdom ruled by '''[[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]''', the main antagonist of the series. The kingdom has appeared in several games under different names, and often appears as the final level of the game which it is featured in. The first time this kingdom appears under the name Bowser's Kingdom is in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''.\n* '''Sprixie Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', is home to fairy-like creatures called '''Sprixies'''. It is composed of 8 islands with different themes, with each island being ruled by a Sprixie. It is the main setting of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n* '''Kingdom of Bask''', introduced in ''[[Mario Tennis Aces]]'', the Kingdom of Bask was ruled by '''King Bask''' until '''Lucien''', the main antagonist of the game, attacked it, forcing King Bask to split his power into Power Stones. It is the main setting of ''Mario Tennis Aces''.\n* '''Sarasaland''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Land]]'', is ruled by '''[[Princess Daisy]]''', and is divided into four kingdoms: '''Birabuto Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient Egypt]]), '''Muda Kingdom''' (based on Mu and [[Bermuda]]), '''Easton Kingdom''' (based on Easter Island) and '''Chai Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient China]]). It is the main setting of ''Super Mario Land''.\n* '''Beanbean Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'', is governed by '''Queen Bean''' and his son '''Prince Peasley'''. The capital is '''Beanbean Castle Town''', and the kingdom is known to have good relations with the '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', in addition to bordering it. The regions are named after laughter onomatopoeias. Just like the Mushroom Kingdom is mushroom themed, the Beanbean Kingdom is bean themed. It is also home to the famous '''Chuckola Cola'''. The forest where it is produced is named '''Chucklehuck Woods'''. It is the main setting of ''Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga''.\n* '''Pi'illo Island''', formerly known as '''Pi'illo Kingdom''', is introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', and is an island that was ruled by '''Prince Dreambert''' until he and the other Pi'illos were imprisoned by '''Antasma''', the main antagonist of the game. At some undefined time in the past, the island was acquired by '''Dr. Snoozemore'''. At the end of the game, with all the Pi'illos released, the island is once again governed by '''Prince Dreambert.''' It is the main setting of ''Mario & Luigi: Dream Team''.\n* '''Isle Delfino''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', is a [[dolphin]]-shaped paradise island somewhere outside the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. It's the setting for ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. The capital is '''Delfino Plaza'''.\n* ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' introduces a variety of new locations such as the '''Cap Kingdom''', '''Cascade Kingdom''', '''Metro Kingdom''' and '''Luncheon Kingdom''', just to name a few.\n\n== Impact and legacy ==\nMario has been featured in 256 games of various genres (including sports, puzzle, party, racing and first-person shooter), and the ''Mario'' franchise is the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchise of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html |title=Italian Plumber More Memorable Than Harper, Dion |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |date=December 13, 2007 |publisher=CNW Group |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911224500/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html |url-status=dead |archivedate=September 11, 2009 }}</ref> At least 31 different ''Mario'' games have sold more than a million copies each since 1995.

Out of 89,000  [[Slovak Jews|Jews]] in the country in 1940, around 69,000 were murdered in the [[Holocaust]].\n\nIn 1938, Slovakia lost significant territory to Hungary in the [[First Vienna Award]]; the following year, the ruling [[ethnonationalist]] [[Slovak People's Party]] declared independence from [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] with German protection. State propaganda blamed the Jews for the territorial losses. Jews were targeted for discrimination and harassment, including the [[Aryanization in Slovakia|confiscation of property and businesses]]. The exclusion of Jews from the economy impoverished the community, which encouraged the government to conscript them for forced labor. \n\nIn 1941, the Slovak government negotiated with Nazi Germany for the mass deportation of Jews to [[German-occupied Poland]]. Between March and October 1942, [[List of Holocaust transports from Slovakia|58,000 Jews were deported]] to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] and the [[Lublin District]] of the [[General Governorate]] in German-occupied Poland; only a few hundred survived. The Slovak government organized the transports and paid 500 [[Reichsmarks]] per Jew for the supposed cost of resettlement. The persecution of Jews resumed in August 1944, when [[German occupation of Slovakia|Germany invaded Slovakia]] and triggered the [[Slovak National Uprising]]. Another 13,500 Jews were deported and hundreds to thousands were murdered in Slovakia by [[Einsatzgruppe H]] and the [[Hlinka Guard Emergency Divisions]].\n\nSurvivors faced renewed antisemitism and difficulty regaining stolen property; most emigrated after the [[1948 Communist coup]]. The [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|postwar Communist regime]] censored discussion of the Holocaust; free speech was restored after the [[Velvet Revolution|fall of the Communist regime]] in 1989. The Slovak government's complicity in the Holocaust remains a source of controversy.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{further|History of the Jews in Slovakia}}\n\n[[File:Synagogue Zilina 1931.jpg|thumb|left|alt=modern square building|The [[New Synagogue (\u017dilina)|New Synagogue]] in [[\u017dilina]] shortly after completion, {{circa|1931}}]]\nBefore 1939, Slovakia had never been an independent country.

propaganda poster exhorts readers not to \"be a servant to the Jew\".|upright=1.2]]\n{{The Holocaust sidebar}}\n'''The Holocaust in Slovakia''' was the systematic dispossession, deportation, and murder of Jews in the [[Slovak State]], a [[client state]] of [[Nazi Germany]], during [[World War II]]. Out of 89,000  [[Slovak Jews|Jews]] in the country in 1940, around 69,000 were murdered in the [[Holocaust]].\n\nIn 1938, Slovakia lost significant territory to Hungary in the [[First Vienna Award]]; the following year, the ruling [[ethnonationalist]] [[Slovak People's Party]] declared independence from [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] with German protection. State propaganda blamed the Jews for the territorial losses. Jews were targeted for discrimination and harassment, including the [[Aryanization in Slovakia|confiscation of property and businesses]]. The exclusion of Jews from the economy impoverished the community, which encouraged the government to conscript them for forced labor. \n\nIn 1941, the Slovak government negotiated with Nazi Germany for the mass deportation of Jews to [[German-occupied Poland]]. Between March and October 1942, [[List of Holocaust transports from Slovakia|58,000 Jews were deported]] to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] and the [[Lublin District]] of the [[General Governorate]] in German-occupied Poland; only a few hundred survived. The Slovak government organized the transports and paid 500 [[Reichsmarks]] per Jew for the supposed cost of resettlement. The persecution of Jews resumed in August 1944, when [[German occupation of Slovakia|Germany invaded Slovakia]] and triggered the [[Slovak National Uprising]]. Another 13,500 Jews were deported and hundreds to thousands were murdered in Slovakia by [[Einsatzgruppe H]] and the [[Hlinka Guard Emergency Divisions]].\n\nSurvivors faced renewed antisemitism and difficulty regaining stolen property; most emigrated after the [[1948 Communist coup]]. The [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|postwar Communist regime]] censored discussion of the Holocaust; free speech was restored after the [[Velvet Revolution|fall of the Communist regime]] in 1989.
