[[Natural England]] manages the reserve which covers five separate dales of the [[White Peak]] ([[Lathkill Dale]], Cressbrook Dale, Hay Dale, Long Dale and [[Monk's Dale|Monk\u2019s Dale]]). The reserve contains [[Fraxinus|ash]] and [[Ulmus glabra|wych elm]] woodland and shrubs including [[Mercurialis perennis|dog\u2019s mercury]], [[Acer campestre|field maple]], [[Viburnum opulus|guelder rose]], [[Corylus avellana|hazel]], [[Prunus padus|bird cherry]] and [[Cornus sanguinea|dogwood]]. Wildflowers in the reserve include  [[lily-of-the-valley]], [[Allium ursinum|ramsons]] and [[Geranium sanguineum|bloody cranesbill]]. There are broad areas of scrub with [[Crataegus|hawthorn]], [[Prunus spinosa|blackthorn]], [[Rhamnus (plant)|buckthorn]] and rose. [[Helictotrichon pratense|Meadow oat]] and [[Carex panicea|carnation sedge]] spread across the ungrazed grasslands, with patches of rare bird\u2019s-foot sedge (''Carex ornithopoda''). Cressbrook Dale is also a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI).

A body of cultural criticism that attends to what [[Carol J.

Vegan studies, in both Wright\u2019s and Adams\u2019s terms, would extend the consciousness-raising impetus of everyday animal ethics to a critical practice that focuses on animal suffering and commodification. While theorists associated with the 'animal turn', such as [[Donna J. Haraway]], have warned that veganism runs the risk of insisting on absolutist moral code that would constitute a restrictive 'Feminist Doxa' (Haraway 2008, p. 80), Wright's work insists on a definition of veganism in which it is understood that there is no 'singular reason' for veganism and no 'singular representative vegan body' but rather a plurality of cultural and dietary motives and practices (Wright 2015, p. 8).

In Wright's view, the vegan body and vegan identity \"constitute a [[Performative turn|performative project]] and an entity in a state of perpetual transformation\".{{sfnp|Wright|2019|p=xv}}\n\nWright offers as an example of a vegan studies analysis a 2018 article by Stobie in [[Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment|ISLE]] about ''[[The Vegetarian]]'' by [[Han Kang]], winner of the 2016 [[Man Booker International Prize]]: \"Rather than read protagonist Yeong-hye's plight as the result of illogical mental illness, Stobie reads her character's actions\u2014to eschew eating meat to the point of starvation, even when members of her family try to force feed it to her\u2014as a posthumanist performance of vegan praxis dependent upon inarticulable trauma and the desire for intersectional and interspecies connection.\"<ref>{{harvp|Wright|2017|p=733}}; {{harvp|Stobie|2017}}.</ref>\n\nAnother example is Sara Salih's account, in Quinn and Westwood's 2018 collection, of \"three scenes of failed witness\", including when she left a formal lunch in tears when the chicken dish arrived, and when she and others stood staring (pointlessly, she felt at the time) at slaughterhouse workers using electric prods to push pigs off a lorry. Salih argues that there is in fact an ethical purpose to witnessing such acts. The witnessing outside the slaughterhouse was a performative act, an \"illegal act un-sanctioning\", directed at the workers.{{sfnp|Salih|2018|pp=57\u201360}} At the same time as asking these questions, Salih was feeding standard [[cat food]] to seven cats.{{sfnp|Salih|2018|pp=67, 70}} \"Why\", she asks [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]], who wrote about his cat in ''[[The Animal That Therefore I Am]]'' (2008), \"have you chosen to turn towards this animal rather than that one?\"{{sfnp|Salih|2018|p=67}} She suggests that the scale of suffering makes \"[o]ur imaginations baulk\"; it seems absurd to understand that \"we are in the presence of the dead&nbsp;... when faced with a scoopful of kibble.\"{{sfnp|Salih|2018|p=70}} Nevertheless she advises: \"Look as closely as you can at your bowl or the neighbour's bowl or the cat's bowl, bear witness, and then decide whether the current norms of logic or rationality possess any moral validity.\"{{sfnp|Salih|2018|p=72}}\n\n===Relationship with animal studies===\nAlmiron, Cole and Freeman write that vegan studies and [[critical animal studies]] (CAS) share common roots as \"related branches in the evolution of critical approaches to human domination\".{{sfnp|Almiron|Cole|Freeman|2018|p=373}}{{efn|name=Almiron2018b|N\u00faria Almiron, Matthew Cole, and Carrie P. Freeman (''[[European Journal of Communication]]'', 1 August 2018): \"The multidisciplinary tenor of vegan studies is shared with the prior emergence of one of the most important critical projects of recent years: CAS &#91;[[critical animal studies]]&#93;. Indeed, vegan studies and CAS share common roots in many respects (with veganism as a baseline for CAS praxis) and may best be understood as related branches in the evolution of critical approaches to human domination, with, we argue, CAMS [critical animal media studies] as another branch to be acknowledged alongside them.\"{{sfnp|Almiron|Cole|Freeman|2018|pp=372\u2013373}}}} Wright views vegan studies as \"informed by and divergent from\" animal studies, including critical animal studies.<ref>{{harvp|Wright|2017|pp=729\u2013730}}; {{harvp|Wright|2015|p=11}}.</ref> According to Larue, vegan studies is \"both narrower and broader than animal studies\". It intersects with critical animal studies but encompasses fields such as environmental studies and nutrition, which play an important role in the way veganism has been perceived, promoted, or criticized in the last few decades and today.\"{{efn|name=Larue|Renan Larue (2019): \"Vegan studies is an emerging field of research, which is about understanding the vegan phenomenon, from its first manifestations until the present time, and explores what is at stake with it theologically, morally, anthropologically, socially, or psychologically.{{pb}}\"Vegan studies constitutes a realm both narrower and broader than animal studies. Narrower, because it focuses on the way human beings behave towards animals, in particular those we fish, hunt, breed, use, slaughter, and eat (in that sense, vegan studies intersect partly with critical animal studies). Broader, because vegan studies encompasses other fields, namely environmental studies and nutrition, which play an important role in the way veganism has been perceived, promoted, or criticized in the last few decades and today.\"{{sfnp|Larue|2019}}}}\n\nAccording to Alex Lockwood of the [[University of Sunderland]], vegan studies offers a \"radical and more coherent way of ensuring the present experiences of all beings are taken into account when examining the ways in which discourse shapes power\".{{sfnp|Lockwood|2019|p=219}} It \"engages a lived politics\" of empathy and care, as Wright describes it.{{sfnp|Wright|2019|p=viii}}<!--expand with vegan studies art example; more about vegan studies and ecofeminism-->\n\n==Sources==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist|26em}}\n\n===References===\n{{reflist|26em}}\n\n===Works cited===\n{{refbegin|26em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book |last1=Adams |first1=Carol J. |author-link=Carol J.

A body of cultural criticism that attends to what [[Carol J. Adams]] identifies as the 'overt associations between meat eating and virile maleness,' vegan studies implores critics to not only attend to cultural representations of animal bodies but the 'patriarchal attitudes' encoded in such representations (Adams 2010, pp. 25\u201326).&nbsp;... Vegan studies, in both Wright\u2019s and Adams\u2019s terms, would extend the consciousness-raising impetus of everyday animal ethics to a critical practice that focuses on animal suffering and commodification. While theorists associated with the 'animal turn', such as [[Donna J. Haraway]], have warned that veganism runs the risk of insisting on absolutist moral code that would constitute a restrictive 'Feminist Doxa' (Haraway 2008, p. 80), Wright's work insists on a definition of veganism in which it is understood that there is no 'singular reason' for veganism and no 'singular representative vegan body' but rather a plurality of cultural and dietary motives and practices (Wright 2015, p. 8). Despite points of difference, both critical vegan studies and animal philosophy are predicated on reappraising how embodiment, materiality, and language, structure human and animal relations.\"{{sfnp|Adkins|2017|p=3}}}}\n\nIn 2016 the French scholar {{Interlanguage link multi|Renan Larue|fr|3=Renan Larue}}, author of ''Le v\u00e9g\u00e9tarisme et ses ennemis: Vingt-cinq si\u00e8cles de d\u00e9bats'' (2015), began teaching a vegan studies course at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Prieto |first1=Eric |title=News for Alumni & Friends of the Comparative Literature Program |url=http://www.complit.ucsb.edu/sites/comparative-literature/files/CLitW15_web_v3.pdf |publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106120512/http://www.complit.ucsb.edu/sites/comparative-literature/files/CLitW15_web_v3.pdf |archivedate=6 January 2019 |page=4 |date=Fall 2014&nbsp;\u2013 Summer 2015}}{{pb}}\n{{cite news |last1=Garcia |first1=L\u00e9na |title=What Vegans Study |url=https://www.independent.com/news/2016/mar/15/what-vegans-study/ |work=Santa Barbara Independent |date=15 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317042048/https://www.independent.com/news/2016/mar/15/what-vegans-study/|archivedate=17 March 2016|url-status=live|ref=harv}}.{{pb}}\n{{cite news |last1=Dicks |first1=Brett Leigh |title=Animal Ethics 101 |url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58263aded2b85743cd932e49/t/59f6082771c10b247de8847c/1509296168738/SBNParticle.pdf |work=Santa Barbara News-Press |date=19 April 2016|ref=harv|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106113236/https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58263aded2b85743cd932e49/t/59f6082771c10b247de8847c/1509296168738/SBNParticle.pdf|archive-date=6 January 2019|url-status=live}}{{pb}}\n{{cite news |last1=Cugnier |first1=St\u00e9phane |title=Renan Larue, proph\u00e8te fran\u00e7ais du veganisme \u00e0 UC Santa Barbara |url=https://frenchmorning.com/renan-laruegourou-francais-veganisme-a-luniversite-de-santa-barbara/ |work=French Morning |date=20 April 2016|ref=harv|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106112044/https://frenchmorning.com/renan-laruegourou-francais-veganisme-a-luniversite-de-santa-barbara/|archive-date=6 January 2019|url-status=live}}{{pb}}\n{{cite web |title=Domain information: veganstudies.org |url=https://www.whois.com/whois/veganstudies.org |publisher=Whois.com |date=1 February 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190101040635/https://www.whois.com/whois/veganstudies.org |archivedate=1 January 2019|url-status=live|postscript=none}}.{{pb}}\n{{cite web|last=Larue|first=Renan|url=https://www.veganstudies.org/course-description/|title=Course description|website=veganstudies.org |publisher=Vegan Studies at UC Santa Barbara, University of California, Santa Barbara|date=2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181231050516/https://www.veganstudies.org/course-description/|archivedate=31 December 2018|url-status=live|ref=harv}}{{pb}}\n{{cite web |title=Archive: Fall 2018.

Salih argues that there is in fact an ethical purpose to witnessing such acts. The witnessing outside the slaughterhouse was a performative act, an \"illegal act un-sanctioning\", directed at the workers.{{sfnp|Salih|2018|pp=57\u201360}} At the same time as asking these questions, Salih was feeding standard [[cat food]] to seven cats.{{sfnp|Salih|2018|pp=67, 70}} \"Why\", she asks [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]], who wrote about his cat in ''[[The Animal That Therefore I Am]]'' (2008), \"have you chosen to turn towards this animal rather than that one?\"{{sfnp|Salih|2018|p=67}} She suggests that the scale of suffering makes \"[o]ur imaginations baulk\"; it seems absurd to understand that \"we are in the presence of the dead&nbsp;... when faced with a scoopful of kibble.\"{{sfnp|Salih|2018|p=70}} Nevertheless she advises: \"Look as closely as you can at your bowl or the neighbour's bowl or the cat's bowl, bear witness, and then decide whether the current norms of logic or rationality possess any moral validity.\"{{sfnp|Salih|2018|p=72}}\n\n===Relationship with animal studies===\nAlmiron, Cole and Freeman write that vegan studies and [[critical animal studies]] (CAS) share common roots as \"related branches in the evolution of critical approaches to human domination\".{{sfnp|Almiron|Cole|Freeman|2018|p=373}}{{efn|name=Almiron2018b|N\u00faria Almiron, Matthew Cole, and Carrie P.

Narrower, because it focuses on the way human beings behave towards animals, in particular those we fish, hunt, breed, use, slaughter, and eat (in that sense, vegan studies intersect partly with critical animal studies). Broader, because vegan studies encompasses other fields, namely environmental studies and nutrition, which play an important role in the way veganism has been perceived, promoted, or criticized in the last few decades and today.\"{{sfnp|Larue|2019}}}}\n\nAccording to Alex Lockwood of the [[University of Sunderland]], vegan studies offers a \"radical and more coherent way of ensuring the present experiences of all beings are taken into account when examining the ways in which discourse shapes power\".{{sfnp|Lockwood|2019|p=219}} It \"engages a lived politics\" of empathy and care, as Wright describes it.{{sfnp|Wright|2019|p=viii}}<!--expand with vegan studies art example; more about vegan studies and ecofeminism-->\n\n==Sources==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist|26em}}\n\n===References===\n{{reflist|26em}}\n\n===Works cited===\n{{refbegin|26em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book |last1=Adams |first1=Carol J. |author-link=Carol J.

Despite its 65+ years of existence in [[India]], the profession has gained momentum in the [[Health care|healthcare]] sector of India only in the recent years.\n\n== Beginning years ==\n\nThe first department of [[occupational therapy]] (OT) was established at the King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital in [[Mumbai]], India in 1950.  The founder of the \u2018OT profession in India\u2019 as well as the \u2018first school of OT in India/Asia\u2019 was Mrs. Kamla V. Nimbkar[1] [nee Elizabeth Lundy].  Mrs. Nimbhkar was a [[social activist]] who spent her early 30s at Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s Sabarmati Ashram.  She became interested in OT when she came across an article written by Ms. Helen Willard, a notable occupational therapist in the United States.  Dr. Nimbhkar went  to the US to study OT at the [[Philadelphia School of Occupational Therapy|Philadelphia School of OT]] at the age of 45.  After passing the OT board exam in February 1948 she returned to India and persuaded the KEM Hospital Administration to start the OT department.\n\nMrs. Nimbkar was also the founder and first president of the All India Occupational Therapists Association, which is one of the founding member organizations of the World Federation of Occupational Therapists (WFOT).  Mrs. Nimbhkar was also the first editor of the Indian Journal of Occupational Therapy in its beginning years.  Mrs. Nimbkar retired in 1957 from the Occupational Therapy School at KEM Hospital and established the second OT school at Nagpur in 1958.\n\n== 1960\u20131980s ==\n\nSubsequent decades saw the emergence of a few OT diploma educational programs in the states of Bihar [Bihar College of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy - 1966], New Delhi [PDU Institute for the Physically Handicapped - 1960; College of Occupational Therapy, AIIMS - 1971], Tamil Nadu [Occupational Therapy School at Christian Medical College - 1969], and Uttar Pradesh [Occupational Therapy School at King George's Medical School - 1970; Occupational Therapy School at Institute of Engineering and Technology - 1981].\n\n== Age of notable growth ==\n\nOccupational therapy's stature began to grow when diploma level educational programs transitioned to baccalaureate level programs in late 1980s. The last decade of the 20th century was a golden decade for OT in India as 13 new baccalaureate level OT programs were established in India between 1990 and 2000. Many schools were established in [[Maharashtra]] and [[Tamil Nadu]].  The number of OT educational programs continued to rise in early 2000.  The length of the baccalaureate degree was increased from 3.5 years to 4.5 years in 1ate 1990s.  Institutions also began to offer OT at a master's level (ranging 2\u20133 years) beginning late 1990s.  Since 2012, doctoral level [PhD] OT degrees are also being offered in India.\n\nThe demand for OT professionals in India has gathered momentum in the past decade. Indian OT professionals work in a variety of practice settings including government and private hospitals, multi-specialty hospitals, rehabilitation centers, non-governmental organizations, special schools, outpatient clinics, and academic institutions.  Many OTs in India run their own outpatient clinics.  Due to the excessive demand for OT professionals all over the world, graduates of OT programs in India comprise a notable part of India's [[diaspora]].\n\n== Entry-level requirements ==\n\nTo practice OT in India, one must graduate with a baccalaureate level degree in OT (BOT). One must also fulfil other applicable regulatory requirements such as obtaining a registration certificate from the council (if one is established in the state) before starting to practice. Currently, more than 30 schools offer OT courses in India.\n\n== Occupational therapy schools in India  ==\nA few well-known institutes that run BOT courses in India are as follows<ref>BOT Institutes http://www.indicareer.com/colleges-for-BPT%20and%20BOT-degree.html</ref>\n# Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, Tamil Nadu [http://www.sriramachandra.edu.in/university/admissions]\n#[http://www.jkkm.info JKKMMRF College of Occupational therapy, Tamil Nadu]\n#NIEPMD, Chennai, Tamil Nadu [http://niepmd.tn.nic.in/c_bot.php]\n# [https://web.archive.org/web/20110430201901/http://www.nioh.in/ National Institute for locomotor disabilities, Kolkata, West Bengal, India]\n# [http://aiipmr.gov.in  All India Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Haji Ali, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India]\n# [http://nirtar.nic.in Swami Vivekanand National Institute of Rehabilitation Training and Research (SVNIRTAR), Cuttack, Odisha, India]\n# [http://www.iphnewdelhi.in Pt.

However, efforts are underway to create a national level council.  The All India Occupational Therapists Association offers voluntary registration with its Academic Council for interested OT practitioners in India.  The State of Maharashtra and the Union Territory of Delhi legally require OT practitioners to register themselves with the respective councils (The Delhi Council for Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy & Maharashtra State Occupational and Physiotherapy Council).\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110724230649/http://www.aiota.org/OTinIndia.asp OT in India]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Occupationnal Therapy In India}}\n[[Category:Occupational therapy]]\n", "text_old": "{{format references|date=August 2019}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{external links|date=May 2018}}\n{{Primary sources|date=October 2010}}\n{{underlinked|date=May 2018}}\n}}\nThe profession of occupational therapy was established in India in 1950.

The State of Maharashtra and the Union Territory of Delhi legally require OT practitioners to register themselves with the respective councils (The Delhi Council for Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy & Maharashtra State Occupational and Physiotherapy Council).\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110724230649/http://www.aiota.org/OTinIndia.asp OT in India]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Occupationnal Therapy In India}}\n[[Category:Occupational therapy]]\n", "name_user": "Joseph445", "label": "safe", "comment": "india link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy_in_India"}
