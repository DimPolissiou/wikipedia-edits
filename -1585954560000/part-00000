Her given name was '''Marie Valerie Mathilde Amalie''', but she was usually called Valerie.\n\n==Early life==\nPrincess Marie Valerie was born at [[Ofen]] ([[Buda]]) in [[Hungary]]. The Empress Elisabeth was especially attached to Valerie, who was born ten years after the imperial couple's third child, and whom she was allowed to raise herself in contrast to her first three children who were taken from her in infancy and raised by the Emperor's mother, [[Sophie, Princess of Bavaria|Archduchess Sophie]].  Sophie herself wrote to Elisabeth's mother [[Princess Ludovika of Bavaria|Ludovika]], \"Sisi is completely absorbed by her love and care for this irresistible little angel.\"\n\nShe was Elisabeth's favorite child by far, and was acidly referred to by some courtiers as \"Die Einzige\" (\"The Only Child\") because Elisabeth paid so much more attention to her than her siblings.  Valerie loved her mother, but according to her diaries, often felt embarrassed and overwhelmed by Elisabeth's concentration on her, particularly as she herself was of a modest and practical nature.\n\nAnother of Valerie's nicknames was \"The Hungarian Child\" because her birth had been a concession by Elisabeth, who disliked physical intimacy and pregnancy, in exchange for Franz Joseph's conciliation with [[Hungary]], her most favored part of the Empire.  This process culminated in their joint coronation in [[Budapest]] on 8 June 1867, as King and Queen of Hungary.  Valerie was born just over nine months later.\n\nElisabeth deliberately chose Hungary as her child's birthplace; no royal child had been born in Hungary for centuries.  Had Valerie been a boy, she would have been named Stephan after [[Stephen I of Hungary|Hungary's canonized king and patron saint]].  According to historian [[Brigitte Hamann]], a boy born to the Queen of Hungary in the castle at Budapest would have raised the possibility of his someday becoming its king, separating Hungary from the Austrian empire, and there was universal relief at the Viennese court that Valerie was a girl.\n\nMalicious rumors intimated that Valerie was actually the daughter of Elisabeth's friend and admirer [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]], the Hungarian prime minister.  These persisted into Valerie's childhood, hurting her deeply.  However, she physically resembled Franz Joseph more than any of her siblings, even more so as she grew older, and eventually the rumors died away.  Due to the atmosphere they created, however, Valerie developed a lifelong antipathy toward anything to do with Hungary, exacerbated by Elisabeth's insistence on speaking to her only in Hungarian.  She was joyful when she was given permission to speak German with her father, whom she worshiped.  In addition, she spoke English, French, and Italian fluently, loved to write plays and poems, and was a talented amateur artist who particularly enjoyed painting flowers.  She was a great supporter of the [[Burgtheater]] in Vienna, and attended its productions as often as possible.\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:Franz Salvator & Marie Valerie of Austria.jpg|thumb|left|Franz Salvator and Marie Valerie]]\nIn [[Bad Ischl]] on 31 July 1890, Valerie married her second cousin [[Archduke Franz Salvator of Austria|Archduke Franz Salvator]]. They had met in 1886 at a ball, but Valerie waited several years to be sure that her feelings toward Franz Salvator were strong enough to make a successful marriage.  It was hoped by many at court that she would marry someone like the [[Frederick Augustus III of Saxony|Crown Prince of Saxony]] or the [[Carlos I of Portugal|Prince Royal of Portugal]], and she was also courted by [[Prince Alfons of Bavaria]]. Elisabeth, however, declared that Valerie would be allowed to marry even a chimney sweeper if she so desired (in contrast to her other children, who had both had to make dynastic marriages).  Valerie chose for love Franz Salvator, a relatively minor prince from the Tuscan branch of the Austrian imperial family who had no great wealth to offer, and Elisabeth, as promised, supported her favorite daughter. This caused a deep rift between Valerie and her sister and brother [[Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria|Crown Prince Rudolf]] for a time, but eventually Rudolf became reconciled to the marriage when Valerie and Franz became engaged on Christmas 1888.\n\nValerie's solemn renunciation of her rights to the Austrian throne, which was necessary for the marriage to proceed, took place on  16 July 1890 at the [[Hermesvilla]].<ref>[[Brigitte Hamann]]: ''Kaiserin wider Willen'', 1981. {{ISBN|3-492-22990-5}}</ref> The young couple's festive wedding followed in the parish church of [[Bad Ischl]] on 31 July.  The ceremony was conducted by the [[Bishop of Linz]], [[Franz Maria Doppelbauer]].  Afterwards, Valerie and Franz honeymooned in Italy, Switzerland, and Bavaria.\n\n==Children==\nMarie Valerie and Franz Salvator had 10 children:\n\n{| border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!Name!!Birth!!Death!!Notes\n|-\n| [[Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria (1892\u20131930)|Elisabeth Franziska \"Ella\"]] || 27 January 1892  || 29 January 1930 || married  Count Georg of Waldburg-Zeil-Trauchburg, had issue.\n|-\n| Franz Karl Salvator  || 17 February 1893 || 12 December 1918 || died unmarried of the [[Spanish flu]].\n|-\n| [[Archduke Hubert Salvator of Austria|Hubert Salvator]] || 30 April 1894 || 24 March 1971 || married [[Princess Rosemary of Salm-Salm]], had issue.\n|-\n| [[Archduchess Hedwig of Austria|Hedwig]] || 24 September 1896 || 1 November 1970 || married  Count Bernard of Stolberg-Stolberg, had issue.\n|-\n| Theodor Salvator || 9 October 1899 || 8 April  1978 ||  married  Countess Maria Theresa of Waldburg-Zeil-Trauchburg, had issue, including [[Princess Theresa of Bavaria (b. 1931)|Princess Theresa]].\n|-\n| Gertrud || 19 November 1900 || 20 December 1962 || married Count Georg of Waldburg-Zeil-Trauchburg, widower of her sister Elisabeth, had issue.\n|-\n| Maria Elisabeth || 19 November 1901 || 29 December 1936 || died unmarried.\n|-\n| Clemens Salvator || 6 October 1904 || 20 August 1974 || married Countess Elisabeth Ress\u00e9guier de Miremont, took the title Prince of Altenburg, had issue.\n|-\n| Mathilde || 9 August 1906 || 18 October  1991 || married Ernst Hefel, no issue.\n|-\n| Agnes || 26 June 1911  || 26 June 1911 || died at the age of eight hours.\n|}\n\n==Later life==\nAt first, Valerie and Franz lived at Schloss Lichtenegg (Lichtenegg Palace). On  11 June 1895, the couple purchased Schloss Wallsee (Wallsee Palace) on the [[Danube River]] from its then owner, [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] and completely renovated it. When the renovation was finished, a ceremony marking their moving into the new palace was held on  4 September 1897.  There was great celebration of the event in Wallsee due to Valerie's popularity.\n\nShe was known and loved for her generous involvement in local charitable endeavors.  In 1900, she became a patron of the [[Red Cross]], for which she founded hospitals and raised considerable sums of money; she was also patron of seven other charities.  During World War I, she created a hospital barracks in the castle itself and helped care for the wounded.  She was a devout Catholic who also spent much time supporting religious charities and was known to the people as the \"Angel of Waldsee\".  She was also a [[Dame (title)|Dame]] of the [[Star Cross Order]].<ref>Costados, Gon\u00e7alo de Mesquita da Silveira de Vasconcelos e Sousa, Livraria Esquina, 1.\u00aa Edi\u00e7\u00e3o, Porto, 1997, N.\u00ba 9</ref>\n\nValerie was greatly affected by the suicide of her brother Rudolf on 30 January 1889, and the assassination of her mother Elisabeth in September 1898.  She and her sister Gisela were a great support to their father in the aftermath of these tragedies.\n\nWhile the marriage of Valerie and Franz was harmonious at first, it became less so with time.  Franz had many affairs, including one with a dancer [[Stephanie von Hohenlohe|Stephanie Richter]] (1891\u20131972), who was later known as \"Hitler's Spy Princess\" for her espionage activities before and during [[World War II]].  In 1914, she gave birth to a son by him, Franz Joseph, whom he acknowledged as his while Valerie was still alive.  Valerie faced these blows stoically, confiding only in her journal.\n\nAfter the end of World War I, Valerie officially recognized the end of the Habsburg monarchy and signed documents renouncing all rights toward the same for herself and her descendants. The renunciation allowed her to keep her home and possessions.\n\n==Death==\nValerie died in [[Schloss Wallsee]] on 6 September 1924 of [[lymphoma]]. Shortly before her death, her sister Gisela wrote in a letter, \"I must add that I have seen Valerie - fully conscious, completely aware of her condition, and so devoutly accepting, even joyfully anticipating her impending departure, that I believe an unexpected recovery would actually disappoint her.\"  She is buried in a crypt behind the high altar at the parish church in [[Wallsee-Sindelburg|Sindelburg]], Austria.  Several thousand people followed her coffin to its resting place.\n\nOn 28 April 1934, ten years after Valerie's death, Franz married a second time, to Freiin (a title corresponding to \"Baroness\") Melanie von Riesenfels (20 September 1898 \u2013 10 November 1984).  This was a [[morganatic]] marriage; the wedding took place in Vienna.  The pair had met after Valerie's death at Melanie's home, [[Seisenegg Palace]], where she lived with her sisters Maria Anna and Johanna.
