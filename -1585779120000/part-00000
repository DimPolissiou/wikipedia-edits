The old city centre consists of three parts: Kalaja (on the castle hill), Mangalem (at the foot of the castle hill) and Gorica (on the left bank of the Osum). It has a wealth of beautiful buildings of high architectural and historical interest. The pine forests above the city, on the slopes of the towering [[Tomorr]] mountains, provide a backdrop of appropriate grandeur. The Osumi river has cut a 915-metre deep gorge through the limestone rock on the west side of the valley to form a precipitous natural fortress, around which the town was built on several river terraces.\n\nAccording to an Albanian legend, the Tomorr mountain was originally a giant, who fought with another giant (mountain) called Shpirag over a young woman. They killed each other and the girl drowned in her tears, which then became the Osum river.\n\n[[Mount Shpirag]], named after the second giant, is on the left bank of the gorge, above the district of Gorica. Berat is known to Albanians as the city of \"One above another Windows\" (a similar epithet is sometimes applied to [[Gjirokastra]]), or ''The City of Two Thousand Steps''. It was proclaimed a 'Museum City' by the dictator [[Enver Hoxha]] in June 1961.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Ancient ===\nThe earliest recorded inhabitants of the city (6th century BC) were the ancient Greek tribe of the [[Dassaretae]] or Dexarioi, the northernmost subgroup of the [[Chaonians]], and the region was known as ''Dessaretis'' after them.<ref name=\"HammondWalbank1988\" /><ref name=\"LewisBoardman1994\">{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=D.

During the Roman and early Byzantine period, the city was known as ''Pulcheriopolis''.\n\nThe [[First Bulgarian Empire]] under [[Presian I of Bulgaria|Presian I]] captured the town in the 9th century, and the city received the Slavic name ''Bel[i]grad'' (\"White City\"), Belegrada (\u0392\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03b1) in Greek, which persisted throughout the medieval period, changing to ''Berat'' under Ottoman rule. The town became one of the most important towns in the Bulgarian region [[Kutmichevitsa]]. The Bulgarian governor [[Elemag]] surrendered the city to the emperor [[Basil II]] in 1018, and the city remained in Byzantine hands until the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] retook the city in 1203 during the rule of [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria|Kaloyan]]. During the 13th century, it fell to [[Michael I Ducas]], the ruler of the [[Despotate of Epirus]].\n\n[[File:Berat Albania 15.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The entrance of the citadel, with the 13th century Byzantine [[Holy Trinity Church, Berat|Holy Trinity Church]].]]\n\nByzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] sent letters to the Albanian leaders of Berat and [[Durr\u00ebs]] in 1272 asking them to abandon their alliance with [[Charles I of Naples]], leader of the [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|Kingdom of Albania]], who had captured and incorporated it at the same period in the Kingdom of Albania.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2009/mphlae01.pdf|title=Regnum Albaniae and the Papal Curia|last=Lala|first=Etleva|author2=Gerhard Jaritz|year=2008|publisher=Central European University|page=32|accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Wirth1977\">{{cite book|last=Wirth|first=Peter|title=Regesten der Kaiserurkunden des ostr\u00f6mischen Reiches von 565-1453: Regesten von 1204-1282|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=qsM339yaKZMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Regesten+und+Kaiserurkunden&source=bl&ots=aDW22ULQ_V&sig=Uuz54fCUhMkAPAXSPFNpfSegnaI&hl=en&ei=nxlLTbTQF4GDOoXVrfEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Berat&f=false|accessdate=3 February 2011|date=2 March 1977|publisher=C.H.Beck|isbn=978-3-406-00738-5|page=114}}</ref><ref name=\"Norris36\">{{cite book|last=Norris|first=Harry Thirlwall|title=Islam in the Balkans: religion and society between Europe and the Arab world|year=1993|location=Columbia|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|url=https://archive.org/details/islaminbalkansre00norr|url-access=registration|isbn=9780872499775|page=[https://archive.org/details/islaminbalkansre00norr/page/36 36]|ref=harv}}</ref> However, they sent the letters to Charles as a sign of their loyalty.<ref name=\"Nicol2010\">{{cite book|last=Nicol|first=Donald M.|title=The Despotate of Epiros 1267-1479: A Contribution to the History of Greece in the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=XIj0FfKto9AC&pg=PA109&dq=Tomoritsa&hl=en&ei=-DhHTdCOO4Wq8QOWmYWvCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=In%201272%20he%20wrote%20the%20Albanians%20of%20Durazzo%20and%20Berat%20urging%20them%20to%20renounce&f=false|accessdate=1 February 2011|date=11 February 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-13089-9|page=16}}</ref>\nIn 1274 Michael VIII recaptured Berat and after being joined by Albanians who supported the Byzantine Empire, marched unsuccessfully against the Angevin capital of Durr\u00ebs.<ref name=\"Bartusis1997\">{{cite book|last=Bartusis|first=Mark C.|title=The late Byzantine army: arms and society, 1204-1453|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUs-hHd89xAC&pg=PA62|accessdate=1 February 2011|year=1997|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-1620-2|page=62}}</ref> In 1280-1281 the Sicilian forces under [[Hugh the Red of Sully]] [[Siege of Berat (1280\u20131281)|laid siege]] to Berat.

After being burned down by the Romans in 200 BC the walls were strengthened in the 5th century under Byzantine [[Emperor Theodosius II]], and were rebuilt during the 6th century under the Emperor [[Justinian I]] and again in the 13th century under the Despot of Epirus, [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas|Michael Komnenos Doukas]], cousin of the Byzantine Emperor. The main entrance, on the north side, is defended by a fortified courtyard and there are three smaller entrances. The fortress of Berat in its present state, even though considerably damaged, remains a magnificent sight. The surface that it encompasses made it possible to house a considerable portion of the town's inhabitants. The buildings inside the fortress were built during the 13th century and because of their characteristic architecture are preserved as cultural monuments. The population of the fortress was Christian, and it had about 20 churches (most built during the 13th century) and only one mosque, for the use of the Muslim garrison, (of which there survives only a few ruins and the base of the minaret). The churches of the fortress have been damaged through the years and only some remain.\n\nThe [[Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Berat)|Church of St. Mary of Blachernae]] dating from the 13th century, has 16th century mural paintings by Nikoll\u00eb Onufri, son of the most important post-medieval Albanian painter, [[Onufri]]. In a small tree - planted square, on a hillside inside the walls of the fortress, stands the 14th century Church of the Holy Trinity. It is built in the form of a cross and has Byzantine murals. Outside the ramparts is the Church of St. Michael (Sh\u00ebn Mehill), built in the 13th century. This church is reached by a steep but perfectly safe path. Near the entrance, after a guardhouse, is the little Church of St. Theodore (Shen Todher), which have wall paintings by Onufri himself. The most interesting is the cathedral of St. Nicholas, which has been well restored and is now a museum dedicated to Onufri. Onufri was the greatest of the 16th century painters in Albania. Not only was he a master of the techniques of fresco and icons, but he was the first to introduce a new colour in painting, shiny red, which the French called \"Onufri's Red\". In addition, Onufri introduced a certain realism and a degree of individuality in facial expression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beratkulture.com/ShenMeriVllaherna.aspx |title=Kisha e Sh\u00ebn M\u00ebri Vllahern\u00ebs |language=Albanian |accessdate=6 November 2010 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n |total_width = 500\n | align = left\n | background color = #BBDD99\n | width = 200\n | image1 =Old town of berat albania 3.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | image2 = Old town of berat 1.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | image3 = Old town of berat 2 albania 2016.jpg\n | alt3 = \n | footer_background = #BBDD99\n | footer_align = center\n | footer = The [[UNESCO]] Site of [[Historic Centres of Berat and Gjirokast\u00ebr|Berat]].\n}}\n\nThe first inscription recording Onufri's name was found in 1951, in the Shelqan church. The Kastoria church has a date 23 July 1547 and a reference to Onufri's origin : ''I am Onufri, and come from the town of Berat''. Onufri's style in painting was inherited by his son, Nikolla (Nicholas), though not so successful as his father. In Onufri's museum can be found works of Onufri, his son, Nikolla and other painters'. There are also numbers of icons and some fine examples of religious silversmith's work (sacred vessels, icon casings, covers of Gospel books, etc.). Berat Gospels, which date from the 4th century, are copies (the originals are preserved in the National Archives in Tirana). The church itself has a magnificent iconostasis of carved wood, with two very fine icons of Christ and the Virgin Mary. The bishop's throne and the pulpit are also of considerable quality. \nNear the street running down from the fortress is the Bachelors' Mosque (Xhami e Beqareve), built in 1827. This has a handsome portico and an interesting external decoration of flowers, plants, houses, etc. The 'Bachelors' were the young shop-assistants (in practice generally unmarried), whom the merchants in Berat used as their own private militia. \n\nThe [[King Mosque, Berat|King Mosque]] ({{lang-sq|Xhamia e Mbretit}}), the oldest in the town built in the reign of [[Bayazid II]] (1481\u20131512),<ref name=\"Norris56\"/> is notable for its fine ceiling.

It is composed of the prayer hall with a square plan, a small ambience for special religious services and a gracious portico in front of the entrance to the prayer hall. In the prayer hall is a mafil carved in wood and decorated. On the eastern side of the prayer hall is the [[mihrab]] decorated with stone stalactites. The inner walls have been decorated with eight frescoes, depicting dwelling houses, [[Muslim]] religious buildings and landscapes.\n\nThe walls below the frescoes are covered by holes that improve the acoustics in the prayer hall. The ceiling of the prayer hall is made of wood and is decorated with paintings valued as the most beautiful of the time. The ceiling has been decorated in the [[Baroque style]] adopted in Islamic art and is covered with 14 carat gold plates. The inner decorations were carried out by Master [[Dush Barka]]. Attached to the prayer hall is a room in which once was the mausoleum of [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha]] and his son. The portico of the tekke has five stone columns which were taken from the [[ancient Greek]] city of [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]]. Above the main door in the portico is an inscription dedicated to the values of the tekke and to [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beratkulture.com/THelvetive.aspx|title=Teqja e Helvetive|language=Albanian|accessdate=6 November 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Monuments dating to the late Ottoman period from the Albanian Vrioni family exist such as the gate to a former palace and a tomb, other monuments are from the Vlora family.<ref name=\"Kiel52\">{{cite book|last=Kiel|first=Machiel|title=Ottoman architecture in Albania, 1385-1912|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=2xYzAAAAIAAJ&dq=Berat+ottoman&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Berat+|year=1990|publisher=Research Centre for Islamic History, Art and Culture|isbn=978-92-9063-330-3|page=52|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nNear of tekke is purported to be the grave of [[Sabbatai Zevi]], a [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Jew]] who had been banished to [[Dulcigno]] (present day Ulcinj) who created controversy among his followers upon his conversion to [[Islam]].

The old city centre consists of three parts: Kalaja (on the castle hill), Mangalem (at the foot of the castle hill) and Gorica (on the left bank of the Osum). It has a wealth of beautiful buildings of high architectural and historical interest. The pine forests above the city, on the slopes of the towering [[Tomorr]] mountains, provide a backdrop of appropriate grandeur. The Osumi river has cut a 915-metre deep gorge through the limestone rock on the west side of the valley to form a precipitous natural fortress, around which the town was built on several river terraces.\n\nAccording to an Albanian legend, the Tomorr mountain was originally a giant, who fought with another giant (mountain) called Shpirag over a young woman. They killed each other and the girl drowned in her tears, which then became the Osum river.\n\n[[Mount Shpirag]], named after the second giant, is on the left bank of the gorge, above the district of Gorica. Berat is known to Albanians as the city of \"One above another Windows\" (a similar epithet is sometimes applied to [[Gjirokastra]]), or ''The City of Two Thousand Steps''. It was proclaimed a 'Museum City' by the dictator [[Enver Hoxha]] in June 1961.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Ancient ===\nThe earliest recorded inhabitants of the city (6th century BC) were the ancient Greek tribe of the [[Dassaretae]] or Dexarioi, the northernmost subgroup of the [[Chaonians]], and the region was known as ''Dessaretis'' after them.<ref name=\"HammondWalbank1988\" /><ref name=\"LewisBoardman1994\">{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=D.

During the Roman and early Byzantine period, the city was known as ''Pulcheriopolis''.\n\nThe [[First Bulgarian Empire]] under [[Presian I of Bulgaria|Presian I]] captured the town in the 9th century, and the city received the Slavic name ''Bel[i]grad'' (\"White City\"), Belegrada (\u0392\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03b1) in Greek, which persisted throughout the medieval period, changing to ''Berat'' under Ottoman rule.

After being burned down by the Romans in 200 BC the walls were strengthened in the 5th century under Byzantine [[Emperor Theodosius II]], and were rebuilt during the 6th century under the Emperor [[Justinian I]] and again in the 13th century under the Despot of Epirus, [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas|Michael Komnenos Doukas]], cousin of the Byzantine Emperor. The main entrance, on the north side, is defended by a fortified courtyard and there are three smaller entrances. The fortress of Berat in its present state, even though considerably damaged, remains a magnificent sight. The surface that it encompasses made it possible to house a considerable portion of the town's inhabitants. The buildings inside the fortress were built during the 13th century and because of their characteristic architecture are preserved as cultural monuments. The population of the fortress was Christian, and it had about 20 churches (most built during the 13th century) and only one mosque, for the use of the Muslim garrison, (of which there survives only a few ruins and the base of the minaret). The churches of the fortress have been damaged through the years and only some remain.\n\nThe [[Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Berat)|Church of St. Mary of Blachernae]] dating from the 13th century, has 16th century mural paintings by Nikoll\u00eb Onufri, son of the most important post-medieval Albanian painter, [[Onufri]]. In a small tree - planted square, on a hillside inside the walls of the fortress, stands the 14th century Church of the Holy Trinity. It is built in the form of a cross and has Byzantine murals. Outside the ramparts is the Church of St. Michael (Sh\u00ebn Mehill), built in the 13th century. This church is reached by a steep but perfectly safe path. Near the entrance, after a guardhouse, is the little Church of St. Theodore (Shen Todher), which have wall paintings by Onufri himself. The most interesting is the cathedral of St. Nicholas, which has been well restored and is now a museum dedicated to Onufri. Onufri was the greatest of the 16th century painters in Albania. Not only was he a master of the techniques of fresco and icons, but he was the first to introduce a new colour in painting, shiny red, which the French called \"Onufri's Red\". In addition, Onufri introduced a certain realism and a degree of individuality in facial expression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beratkulture.com/ShenMeriVllaherna.aspx |title=Kisha e Sh\u00ebn M\u00ebri Vllahern\u00ebs |language=Albanian |accessdate=6 November 2010 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n |total_width = 500\n | align = left\n | background color = #BBDD99\n | width = 200\n | image1 =Old town of berat albania 3.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | image2 = Old town of berat 1.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | image3 = Old town of berat 2 albania 2016.jpg\n | alt3 = \n | footer_background = #BBDD99\n | footer_align = center\n | footer = The [[UNESCO]] Site of [[Historic Centres of Berat and Gjirokast\u00ebr|Berat]].\n}}\n\nThe first inscription recording Onufri's name was found in 1951, in the Shelqan church. The Kastoria church has a date 23 July 1547 and a reference to Onufri's origin : ''I am Onufri, and come from the town of Berat''. Onufri's style in painting was inherited by his son, Nikolla (Nicholas), though not so successful as his father. In Onufri's museum can be found works of Onufri, his son, Nikolla and other painters'. There are also numbers of icons and some fine examples of religious silversmith's work (sacred vessels, icon casings, covers of Gospel books, etc.). Berat Gospels, which date from the 4th century, are copies (the originals are preserved in the National Archives in Tirana). The church itself has a magnificent iconostasis of carved wood, with two very fine icons of Christ and the Virgin Mary. The bishop's throne and the pulpit are also of considerable quality. \nNear the street running down from the fortress is the Bachelors' Mosque (Xhami e Beqareve), built in 1827. This has a handsome portico and an interesting external decoration of flowers, plants, houses, etc. The 'Bachelors' were the young shop-assistants (in practice generally unmarried), whom the merchants in Berat used as their own private militia. \n\nThe [[King Mosque, Berat|King Mosque]] ({{lang-sq|Xhamia e Mbretit}}), the oldest in the town built in the reign of [[Bayazid II]] (1481\u20131512),<ref name=\"Norris56\"/> is notable for its fine ceiling.

It was rebuilt by [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha]] in 1782. It belongs to the [[Khalwati order|Khalwati Sufi order]]. It is composed of the prayer hall with a square plan, a small ambience for special religious services and a gracious portico in front of the entrance to the prayer hall. In the prayer hall is a mafil carved in wood and decorated. On the eastern side of the prayer hall is the [[mihrab]] decorated with stone stalactites. The inner walls have been decorated with eight frescoes, depicting dwelling houses, [[Muslim]] religious buildings and landscapes.\n\nThe walls below the frescoes are covered by holes that improve the acoustics in the prayer hall. The ceiling of the prayer hall is made of wood and is decorated with paintings valued as the most beautiful of the time. The ceiling has been decorated in the [[Baroque style]] adopted in Islamic art and is covered with 14 carat gold plates. The inner decorations were carried out by Master [[Dush Barka]]. Attached to the prayer hall is a room in which once was the mausoleum of [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha]] and his son. The portico of the tekke has five stone columns which were taken from the [[ancient Greek]] city of [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]]. Above the main door in the portico is an inscription dedicated to the values of the tekke and to [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beratkulture.com/THelvetive.aspx|title=Teqja e Helvetive|language=Albanian|accessdate=6 November 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Monuments dating to the late Ottoman period from the Albanian Vrioni family exist such as the gate to a former palace and a tomb, other monuments are from the Vlora family.<ref name=\"Kiel52\">{{cite book|last=Kiel|first=Machiel|title=Ottoman architecture in Albania, 1385-1912|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=2xYzAAAAIAAJ&dq=Berat+ottoman&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Berat+|year=1990|publisher=Research Centre for Islamic History, Art and Culture|isbn=978-92-9063-330-3|page=52|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nNear of tekke is purported to be the grave of [[Sabbatai Zevi]], a [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Jew]] who had been banished to [[Dulcigno]] (present day Ulcinj) who created controversy among his followers upon his conversion to [[Islam]].
