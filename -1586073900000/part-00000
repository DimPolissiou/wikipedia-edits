An expanded version featuring new content, '''''Persona 5 Royal''''',{{efn|Known as ''Persona 5: The Royal'' {{nihongo||\u30da\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca5 \u30b6\u30fb\u30ed\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb|Perusona Faibu Za Roiyaru}} in Japanese}} was released in Japan in October 2019 and worldwide in March 2020.\n\n''Persona 5'' takes place in modern-day [[Tokyo]] and follows [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] after his transfer to Shujin Academy due to being put on probation for an assault of which he was falsely accused. During a school year, he and other students awaken to special powers, becoming a group of secret [[vigilante]]s known as the [[Phantom Thieves of Hearts]]. They explore the Metaverse, a supernatural realm born from humanity's subconscious desires, to steal malevolent intent from the hearts of adults. As with previous games in the series, the party battles enemies known as Shadows using physical manifestations of their psyche known as the [[Persona (series)#Personas|Persona]]. The game incorporates role-playing and [[dungeon crawl]]ing elements alongside [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] scenarios.\n\n''Persona 5'' was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus led by game director and producer [[Katsura Hashino]]. Along with Hashino, returning staff from earlier ''Persona'' games included character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]] and music composer [[Shoji Meguro]]. Preparatory work began during the development of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning after the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011. First announced in 2013, ''Persona 5'' was delayed from its original late 2014 release date due to the game not being fully finished. The game's themes revolved around attaining freedom from the limitations of modern society, while its story was strongly inspired by [[picaresque fiction]] and the party's Personas being based on well-known literary outlaws and rebels.\n\n''Persona 5'' was met with critical acclaim, with praise given to its visual presentation and art direction, cast, gameplay, and music. The game is considered to be one of the greatest role-playing games of all time and was nominated for and won multiple awards. The game shipped over three million copies worldwide by the end of 2019, making it the best-selling entry in the overall ''Megami Tensei'' franchise. Several other media, including two spin-off games, ''[[Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight]]'' and ''[[Persona 5 Scramble]]'', as well as manga and [[Persona 5: The Animation|anime adaptations]], have also been released. The game's cast has also made appearances in other games, such as Joker appearing as a playable character in the 2018 crossover fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{See also|Persona (series)#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of the Persona series}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| footer = [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], the game's protagonist, has two alternating lifestyles: a normal student life ''(top)'', and adventures into otherworldly locations ''(bottom)''.\n| image1 = Persona 5 Classroom.jpg\n| width1 = 250\n| image2 = Persona 5 Palace Combat.jpg\n| width2 = 250\n}}\n''Persona 5'' is a [[role-playing video game]] where the player takes on the role of a high school student, codenamed [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], who lives out a single year while attending school in modern-day [[Tokyo]]. The game is governed by a day-night cycle and weather systems that determine general behavior similar to a [[social simulation game]]. The year is punctuated by both scripted and random events as Joker attends school. He can perform part-time jobs and pursue leisure activities or create battle items. These various activities raise character attributes, which grant passive [[Status effect#Buffs|buffing]] effects during battle.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/> When in the real world, the main protagonist can develop character relationships known as ''Confidants''; an evolution of the ''Social Link'' system from ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''[[Persona 4]]''. With this system, the main protagonist can converse with and improve his relationship with other characters he meets, with some leading to possible romances. Improving Confidant ranks with [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] members unlocks various abilities for use in combat, such as the \"Baton Pass\" ability, which allows the player to directly select another character after a critical hit while granting a temporary attack boost.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/> Improving ranks with non-party Confidants grant other bonuses, such as giving access to new [[Item (gaming)|items]] and equipment and boosting [[experience point]] and yen gain.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nAlongside the normal school life is [[dungeon crawl]]ing gameplay of two different types within a realm called the Metaverse: story-specific dungeons called Palaces and randomly-generated Mementos dungeons. Both are populated by Shadows, physical manifestations of suppressed psyches that are modeled after mythological and religious figures. Within Mementos dungeons, the party can fulfill requests from [[non-playable character]]s (NPCs) received from a \"Confidant\" links.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> While navigating, the party uses stealth to avoid the sight of enemy Shadows, and some areas hold puzzles that can be solved using an insight ability known as \"Third Eye\",<ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/> which highlights interactable objects and enemy strength compared to the party. When exploring story-centered Palaces, an \"Alertness Meter\" is present, where the party being spotted or fleeing combat results in security being raised. If security reaches 100%, the party is forced to leave the Palace. The Alertness level can be lowered by launching surprise attacks on and eliminating enemies, and also lowers automatically overnight.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/> Throughout Palaces are locations known as \"safe rooms\". In them, the player can [[Saved game|save their game]], heal their party, and [[fast travel]] to other safe rooms within the Palace.\n\nAs with previous entries in the series, the game uses a [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] combat system: battles can be initiated when the party runs into an enemy, or they can launch a surprise attack and gain an advantage in battle. In battle, the party has access to both melee and gun weapons, in addition to being able to summon Personas, manifestations of the main characters' inner psyche used mainly for special attacks.<ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"ShackMasks\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |title=Persona 5 Royal New PS4 Game 2020?? |last=Teja|first=Ravi |publisher=Raviteja|date=March 4, 2020 |accessdate=March 4, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830213249/https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |archivedate=March 4, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ShackMasks\"/> If a character strikes an enemy's weakness, they knock the enemy down and are awarded an additional turn. If all enemies are knocked down, a \"Hold Up\" is triggered. During one, the party can launch a devastating \"All-Out Attack\", demand money or items, or enter a negotiation. Negotiation allows Joker to win the selected Shadow over to their side to become a new Persona: they can only be persuaded to join if Joker is their level or higher.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"DigiGameplay\"/> Similar to previous entries, party members can be knocked out, and if the main character is knocked out, the game ends. At times, if a party member is knocked out, they can be captured by enemy Shadows, and is unable to return to the party if the resultant negotiation fails.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\nNew Personas are gained from battle through successful negotiation, and different Persona types are represented through different arcana linked to Confidant links. Personas can be combined, or \"fused\", or otherwise further manipulated within the Velvet Room, a realm Joker visits as part of his journey through the story.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/><ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/> In the Velvet Room, Personas can be fused with \"Guillotine\" fusion processes, with the resultant Persona inheriting skills and stats from its parents. The more skills a Persona has, the more are passed on to the fused Persona. How powerful Personas are through fusion depends on how advanced its associated Confidant link is. Also, Personas can be sacrificed in various ways, also styled after styles of capital punishment: \"Hanging\" grants a sacrificed Persona's experience points to another chosen Persona, and \"Electric Chair\" sacrifice one to create a high-end item. A Persona can also be sent into \"Solitary Confinement\", where they undergo intensive training and gain additional skills quicker than normal. The number of days a Persona must remain to gain strength lessens based on its arcana strength.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/>\n\nMinor multiplayer elements are incorporated into the game through the \"Thieves Guild\" feature. Similar to the \"Vox Populi\" system from ''Persona 4 Golden'', players have the option of seeing what activities other players did during any given day. Players can send messages to each other, in addition to affecting the Alertness meter in the player's favor, and aiding in battle when a party member is taken hostage by an enemy.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting and characters===\n{{Main Article|List of Persona 5 characters}}\n''Persona 5'' takes place within the ''Persona'' universe, revolving around a group of high school students who harness Personas, physical manifestations of their inner psyche.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/> ''Persona 5'' is set in modern-day Tokyo, in April of the year \"20XX\", with navigable real-world locations within the city including [[Akihabara]], [[Shinjuku]] and [[Shibuya]].<ref name=\"P5year\"/> Alongside larger environments, there are specific locations that can be entered, such as shops, restaurants and movie theaters. A major setting throughout the game is Shujin Academy, a high school that the protagonist attends.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/> The second major location is the \"Metaverse\", a supernatural realm consisting of the physical manifestation of humanity's subconscious desires. In the Metaverse, people with corrupted enough desires form their own unique \"Palace\", which is modeled after their distorted perception of the world, along with a Shadow version of themselves possessing a \"Treasure\" symbolic of their desires.<ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"PMythDetail\"/> Returning from earlier entries is the Velvet Room, a place that exists for the growth of Persona users that shifts appearance depending on the current guest: in ''Persona 5'', it takes the form of a prison.<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe [[player character]] is a [[silent protagonist]], a commonplace feature in other ''Persona'' games, codenamed [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]]. He becomes the leader of a [[vigilante]] group known as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, who change the hearts of criminals and other malevolent people through the Metaverse.<ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> He forms it with Morgana, a mysterious cat-like creature who serves as the Thieves' second-in-command, who wants to discover his origins and restore his true form. Other founding members include school delinquent Ryuji Sakamoto and fashion model Ann Takamaki. More people join the group throughout the game, including art prodigy Yusuke Kitagawa, student council president [[Makoto Niijima]], [[hikikomori]] computer hacker Futaba Sakura, and cultured corporate heiress Haru Okumura.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Also interacting with Joker are Goro Akechi, a high school detective; Sae Niijima, public prosecutor and Makoto's older sister; and the residents of the Velvet Room, Igor and his two assistants Caroline and Justine.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"KotakuLysis\"/> Joker also has interactions with other confidants, including his caretaker and Futaba's adoptive father Sojiro Sakura, classmate Yuuki Mishima, his teacher and part-time maid Sadayo Kawakami, arcade gamer Shinya Oda, journalist Ichiko Ohya, [[fortune teller]] Chihaya Mifune, [[shogi]] master Hifumi Togo, doctor Tae Takemi, politician Toranosuke Yoshida, and [[model gun]] store owner Munehisa Iwai.\n\n===Plot===\nAfter Joker defends a woman from being abused by a drunken man on the street, he is falsely charged with assault and put on [[probation]], resulting in expulsion from his school. Joker is sent to Tokyo to stay with his family associate Sojiro Sakura and attend Shujin Academy during his year-long probation. After his arrival, he is drawn into the Velvet Room, where Igor warns him that he must \"rehabilitate\" to avoid forthcoming ruin, and grants him access to a supernatural mobile app that leads Joker into the Metaverse and the Palace of the school's abusive volleyball coach Suguru Kamoshida. Joker meets Morgana, who informs him of the ability to change wicked people's hearts by stealing their \"Treasure\", the emotional root of their behavior, from the Palaces ruled by their Shadow selves. After successfully reforming Kamoshida, Ryuji, Joker, Ann, and Morgana form the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, stealing corruption from the hearts of adults to reform the city.\n\nAs the number of the Phantom Thieves' members and successes grows, they attract the attention of the public and police, including public prosecutor Sae Niijima and detective prodigy Goro Akechi. The Phantom Thieves learn that another secret group, including a black-masked assassin, is using the Metaverse to murder their targets and then framing the Phantom Thieves of Hearts for the killings. In pursuit of the conspiracy, the group is joined by Akechi, who is subsequently revealed to be the black-masked assassin. Escaping into hiding with Sae's help, the Phantom Thieves deduce that the conspiracy's leader is politician Masayoshi Shido, who has been using Akechi's ability to infiltrate the Metaverse to remove obstacles to his becoming Prime Minister and imposing his reforms on Japan, as well as the one who pressed assault charges against Joker. When the Phantom Thieves infiltrate Shido's Palace, they face Akechi, who reveals himself to be Shido's illegitimate son. He also reveals that he has been secretly plotting to exact his revenge on Shido for years of neglect and summons his true Persona: Loki. Once defeated, Akechi sacrifices himself to protect the Phantom Thieves from a group of enemies, allowing them to escape and reach Shido.\n\nDespite Shido's arrest and confession after his change of heart, the public remains uninterested and has lost trust in both authority and the Phantom Thieves. In response, the Phantom Thieves make a final heist to infiltrate the depths of Mementos and steal the treasure at its core. Inside, they discover that the public is in chaos and has chosen to give up their autonomy. The Phantom Thieves are then ejected from Mementos by the Treasure, taking form as the Holy Grail, and vanish after witnessing the Metaverse merge with reality. Waking in the Velvet Room, Joker confronts Igor, Caroline, and Justine. Caroline and Justine regain their memories and merge into Lavenza, their true form. Lavenza reveals the Igor Joker has been seeing in the Velvet room up until this point to be an imposter who imprisoned the real Igor. The imposter is then revealed to be [[Yaldabaoth]], the Holy Grail, who was created from humanity's wish to give up control. Through a bet made with Igor over humanity's goals, Yaldabaoth had given Joker and Akechi their abilities to see whether the world would be preserved or be destroyed through their actions, all while steering the game in his favor.\n\nJoker rejects Yaldabaoth's offer to return to his world at the cost of his freedom, and he, along with the rest of the Phantom Thieves, fight him. Joker's confidants rally the popular support of the people, rebelling against Yaldabaoth's control of humanity and allowing Joker to awaken his ultimate persona to destroy Yaldabaoth and the Metaverse. After Yaldabaoth's defeat, in order for Shido to be prosecuted, Joker must turn himself into the police. While Joker is incarcerated, the rest of the Phantom Thieves and his confidants successfully help secure evidence of Joker's innocence in the assault charge, leading to his conviction being overturned. By spring, Joker's friends drive him back to his hometown.\n\n===''Royal''===\nIn ''Persona 5 Royal'', two new characters interact with the Phantom Thieves: Kasumi Yoshizawa, an accomplished rhythmic gymnast who transferred to Shujin at the same time as the protagonist, and Takuto Maruki, a school counselor hired after Kamoshida is exposed. Kasumi awakens to her Persona after calling the protagonist to a new Palace in Odaiba that quickly vanishes. Maruki, in turn, talks to each of the Phantom Thieves, learning their deepest wishes. After defeating Yaldabaoth, the still-living Akechi turns himself over to Sae in the protagonist's place. At the beginning of the following year, the protagonist finds reality distorted; Akechi was released without reason, and each Phantom Thief member has had their deepest wish granted. The protagonist and Akechi, together with the also-aware Kasumi, return to the Odaiba Palace and investigate. The Palace's master is Maruki, who reveals that \"Kasumi\" is Sumire, sister to the original Kasumi, who died in a car accident saving Sumire.\n\nMaruki can use his Persona to alter a person's reality, with his first use of it being to make his then-girlfriend forget her parents' murder. Yaldabaoth's manipulation of the world drove Maruki and his Persona over the edge, and they became the new controllers of Mementos and warped all reality into a dream-like ideal. Sumire turns against the protagonist to protect her identity as \"Kasumi.\" The protagonist snaps his friends out of Maruki's reality, then frees Sumire from his influence. Depending on player choices, it is revealed that Akechi's survival is dependant on the new reality, and Maruki offers the protagonist the option of accepting it to save Akechi. Refusing the offer, the reformed Phantom Thieves, including Akechi and Sumire, defeat Maruki. Reality returns to normal, and with Akechi missing and the protagonist in prison.\n\nOn their final meeting after the protagonist's release, each member of the Phantom Thieves chooses to pursue their dreams within the current reality. On the day he is due to return home, the protagonist escapes tailing government agents with help from both the Phantom Thieves and a reformed Maruki. At the station, Sumire bids him farewell. If Akechi's confidant level is at its highest, and with the right dialogue choices, a man wearing Akechi's clothes is briefly seen passing through the train window that the protagonist is riding.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus dedicated to handling the ''Persona'' series. Preparatory development of the game began in 2008, following the release of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning following the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011.<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/><ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Hashino was only fully involved in development after ''Catherine'' was finished, later calling the latter game a test for the next ''Persona'' game's development. Development lasted five years.<ref name=\"PersonaBlog\"/><ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> ''Persona 5'' would be Hashino's last game in the series as the leader of P-Studio, as he would afterwards form a separate internal team called Studio Zero.<ref name=\"P5studioA\"/><ref name=\"P5studioB\"/> When production started, the staff consisted of around 40 people. During full production, this number expanded to 70: 15 planners, 15 programmers, and between 30 and 45 designers. These included the game's lead designer Naoya Maeda, who had previously done modeling work for the ''[[Trauma Center (video game series)|Trauma Center]]'' series. The general development was a challenge for the team, as they intentionally changed their development structure due to the more powerful hardware they were working with.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/>\n\nWhile the final game retained the turn-based system from earlier entries, one of the early design drafts was for an action-based system incorporating real-time elements foreign to the series. This idea was ultimately scrapped, but real-time command elements were introduced into the battle system, allowing the gameplay to evolve without extensive changes to the core system.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> A major new addition was the inclusions of unique dungeons with locked layouts as opposed to the dominant randomly generated dungeons of previous ''Persona'' games. This was done to both emulate the game's themes and provide veteran players with something different.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\"/> A returning feature from both earlier ''Persona'' games and the mainline ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series was Negotiation: as it was considered a key part of the overall franchise by fans, Hashino decided to reintroduce it after being absent from the previous two mainline entries. The Negotiation system for ''Persona 5'' was tied into the origins of Shadows as suppressed psyches within the Collective Unconscious. The \"Hold Up\" function was inspired by scenes in films where the antagonist would hold people at gunpoint and make demands. These functions were incorporated due to the game being in part a celebration of the series' history.<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> While designing the gameplay elements, the weather, and environmental elements were all designed to reflect the real world. Dungeon layout was split into three distinct types: the Tokyo overworld environments, \"institutions\" such as Joker's high school, and dungeon environments.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Some segments took control away from the player aside from limited dialogue choices; this was chosen as it reflected the controlled environment of Japanese high schoolers.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/>\n\nWhile ''Catherine'' used the third-party [[Gamebryo]] [[game engine]], ''Persona 5'' used a specially-created engine. Hashino believed that the new engine would make rendering their ideas much easier, although it would result in a long wait by fans for the game.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CathBryon\"/> The event scene software was also developed internally by Atlus, with an estimated 1,160 being featured in the final game. The tools for developing and handling them were greatly expanded over the previous two entries to properly communicate them to players on the more advanced hardware.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Character modeling, in general, was handled with a specially-developed toon shader which helped properly translate the character designs into the game, while also allowing for easy adjustment of shaders and lighting effects during fine-tuning.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> The characters were originally rendered realistically like in ''Catherine'', but the team felt that it was \"wrong\" for the ''Persona'' series. With this in mind, the team did some trial and error before finding a style that satisfied them, doing something similar for the interface and menu design.<ref name=\"P5magazine\"/> In contrast to ''Persona 4'', which had a general deformed look to hardware limitations on the variety of body shapes, the technology available to the team for ''Persona 5'' enabled unique customization for all relevant character models. Two different models were used for members of the main cast: a detailed model for real-time cutscenes, and a general-use model for general event scenes and gameplay.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> ''Persona 5'' was the first time a large number of Personas had been rendered in high definition, something which proved a grueling challenge for the team.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/>\n\n===Story and themes===\nThe original story concept was written by Hashino, while the scenario was co-written by Shinji Yamamoto and Yuichiro Tanaka.<ref name=\"P5credits\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/> The initial concept was for a storyline that diverged from the established paths of ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'', with \"self-discovery\" and \"journey\" being its keywords.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Originally using the concept of a [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking trip]] around the world as a framing device for the story, Hashino decided to refocus on Japan in the wake of the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]].<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> More specifically, it has been noted that the Japanese government's actions in response to the earthquake and tsunami's fallout, along with Japanese citizens' reactions to how the government acted during that time, may have served as partial influences on the game's themes.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|title=The Real-World Problems Behind Persona 5|last=McCarthy|first=Caty|date=May 5, 2017|website=USgamer|language=en|access-date=June 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603100720/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|archive-date=June 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Following that crisis and seeing how people were bonding in the face of it, Hashino decided to have the story take place solely in Japan, with the journeying being done through the ever-shifting Palaces.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Ultimately, the story's central concepts were inspired by equivalent social changes he saw in modern society, particularly in Japan.<ref name=\"PMythDetail\" /> Hashino also described the central theme of the game as being about freedom and how the characters attain it.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> He wanted to make the game more \"thematically approachable\" for newcomers to the series, and to be an emotional experience that left its audience with a strong sense of [[catharsis]] and the inspiration to take on problems in their lives.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/><ref name=\"SilCath\"/>\n\nThe narrative of ''Persona 5'' was designed like an omnibus, with the antagonists pursued by the party changing regularly.<ref name=\"P5persona\"/> As inspiration, the development team has also cited three main stories: the Chinese novel ''[[Water Margin]]'', the Japanese crime movie ''Hakuchuu no Shikaku'', and the Spanish novel ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]''.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> Furthermore, the setting and style was compared to a [[Picaresque novel|picaresque fiction]]; the team originally asked the question of how a character like [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]] might win appeal in modern society.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> This picaresque theme was carried over into the aesthetics of Persona fusion and sacrifice, which were themed after styles of capital punishment.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> Having a more \"stereotypical\" theme enabled the team to create surprising story developments, mixing contemporary drama with the setting of the ''Persona'' series. The series' recurring motif of \"masks\" was used more overtly in the game's plot than previous entries as well,<ref name=\"SilP5Fam\"/> and the game's main locations were based heavily on their real-world counterparts.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nThe main characters, according to Hashino, share a mindset that they \"no longer have a place where they belong in society\": the events of the game give them a sense of belonging.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Hashino stated that while the last few games were about the protagonists chasing the antagonists, ''Persona 5'' would instead more prominently feature the antagonists and phenomena caused by them chasing the protagonists during the latter's activities. The characters have been described as \"juvenile academics,\"<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> with their activities as thieves being part of the way they break from societal norms and express themselves. Adhering with this concept, the game's main aim was to show the characters finding the courage to go outside the normal limits of society as set by previous generations.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> In contrast to previous ''Persona'' casts, the party of ''Persona 5'' willingly embrace the unfolding unusual events in their role of masked vigilantes rather than being dragged into them.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> The cast was originally going to be larger with character Hifumi Togo becoming a Phantom Thief, but as the story was already very large, she was relegated to an optional role as part of the Confidant system.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> Technological advances such as [[smartphones]] and the use of [[social media]] were integrated into both the story and gameplay due to their growing prevalence in modern society and how the public responds to real-world scandals.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe characters' initial Personas ([[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin|Ars\u00e8ne]], [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]], [[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]], [[Zorro]], [[Ishikawa Goemon|Goemon]], [[Pope Joan|Johanna]], [[Necronomicon]], [[Milady de Winter|Milady]], [[Robin Hood]]) were themed after outlaws and picaresque heroes to reflect the function and dominant suppressed passions forming the Palace, and also represent aspects of their owners' personalities.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> Joker's initial Persona was originally the German demon [[Mephistopheles]], but it was changed to Ars\u00e8ne as the latter character better fit the game's themes.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> The cast's alternate Personas ([[Satan]]ael, [[Sun Wukong|Seiten Taisei]], [[Hecate]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]], [[Susano-o|Kamu Susanoo]], [[Anat]], [[Prometheus]], [[Astarte]], [[Loki]]) are taken from mythical beings who act as tricksters or rebels.<ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> The three main inspirations behind Joker's alter ego were [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin]], [[The Fiend with Twenty Faces]], and Japanese outlaw hero Ishikawa Goemon.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> The name of Joker's high school, \"Shujin\", was chosen because it was a [[homonym]] of {{nihongo|''Sh\u016bjin''|\u56da\u4eba}}, the Japanese word for \"prisoner\".<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaB\"/> Following a trend from earlier entries, the Velvet Room assistants are named after characters from the novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]].<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe use of adults as antagonists was a more overt expression of narrative elements previously explored in ''Persona 4''. The relation to police activities was also carried over from ''Persona 4'', but this time with the role of protagonists and antagonists reversed.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\" /> Several writers have highlighted the parallels between the game's various antagonists and real incidents/figures in different sectors of Japanese society (e.g. political, corporate, academic), and how the game's story and characters serve as social commentary on life in Japan.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|title=The Real Japan Behind Persona 5|last=Gay|first=Elliot|date=May 12, 2017|website=Anime News Network|language=en|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630013134/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|archive-date=June 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The game's villains and protagonists were also constructed to be parallels of each other, both groups being misfits trying to shape a world they saw as unsatisfactory or corrupted. This was intended to create moral ambiguity about the Phantom Thieves' actions, causing the player to question their concept of justice and their mission as a whole.<ref name=\"4Gstory\" /> In addition, the way a vocal minority online could draw attention to and shift public opinion on events and scandals in the news was cited as an inspiration for the ambiguous nature of the Phantom Thieves' actions.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\" />\n\n===Art design===\n[[Shigenori Soejima]], who had worked on the last two main-series ''Persona'' games, returned as character designer.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> The game's art director was Masayoshi Suto, whose most notable work on earlier games included the [[user interface]] (UI) displays.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> The art design reflected the picaresque theme aimed for by the rest of the team.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> As the team considered previous ''Persona'' games to be \"fun\" but not well marketed, they designed the UI in such a way as to attract a larger, more mainstream audience.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/> According to Soejima, he was working on prospective designs for the game while ''Persona 4'' was still in development, with his designs evolving as the story for ''Persona 5'' came together.<ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/> Aesthetically, the team felt that they were picking up where ''Persona 4'' left off. Its styling presentation was an unintentional reflection on the hurdles the team needed to overcome during development.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> Following the respective thematic coloring of ''Persona 3'' and ''4''{{'s}} blue and yellow, ''Persona 5'' used red, which was chosen to a harsh feeling.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/><ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Because of this, Suto tested multiple font colors until settling on black and white, as it stood out best against it.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> There was also a wish, especially in the teaser image used for the game's announcement, which represented the main characters' being chained down by the rules of the modern world.<ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Soejima designed the logo to convey the high-speed existences of the young cast, while elements such as Joker's Persona Ars\u00e8ne were designed to appear old-fashioned by comparison. This presented challenges as Soejima needed to balance this with a strong sense of style.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The main aim for the game's environments was to create a sense of realism, with Tokyo being modeled after real locations.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=Persona 5's In-Game Locations Compared To The Real World|url=https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|website=Kotaku|accessdate=January 27, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031184625/https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|archivedate=October 31, 2017}}</ref> When creating the UI, Hashino wanted to demonstrate how a shift in perspective could alter a dull life into an exciting one in the context of the story. Early UI designs were so \"aggressively animated\" that it obscured what was happening in the game. Because of this, the animations were toned down and text orientation was altered, toning down the UI's graphical elements to present a balance between user-friendliness and style.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/> Rather than the use of sub-colors for earlier entries, the UI used only the primary red, black and white colors aside from health and magic point meters, with the menus using a special moving 3D model of Joker which would change position depending on the selected menu.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/>\n\nThe first character sketches were submitted in 2012.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaB\"/> Soejima worked closely with Hashino so the characters and environments reflected the game's themes.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> Due to being high school students, Soejima found it difficult to make each main character's uniform design distinctive, so he expressed their individuality through their thief costumes.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Joker's design was cited by Soejima as his most challenging recent work. Joker needed to both convey a taste of the game's overall art style and to act as an avatar for the player. As the main theme and narrative of ''Persona 5'' revolved around crime and vigilantes triggered by Joker voluntarily choosing that path, Soejima needed to convey this while allowing the character to suit whatever dialogue choices the player decided upon. Due to these difficulties, Joker was given multiple designs in a trial and error process to find the best one. As the \"phantom thief\" premise was a common stereotype in fiction, Soejima initially drew Joker and main cast in a style similar to [[sh\u014dnen manga]], but these designs were scrapped as they clashed with the ''Persona'' series' realistic aesthetics. As with previous entries, Joker was a silent character, so as with previous protagonist Soejima had to work out a way he could communicate without dialogue. His solution was to imagine him as the type of person who made plans but did not share them with others.<ref name=\"FamSoejima\"/> The Persona designs, being based on characters from literature, were intended to evoke both familiarity and surprise from players. Once the names were chosen, Soejima designed the Personas based on that character.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/>\n\nThe game's animated [[cutscene]]s were produced by [[Production I.G]] and Domerica, and were directed and supervised by Toshiyuki Kono.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"Domerica\"/> Kono was contacted three and a half years before the game's completion by Hashino: faced with the project, Kono felt a great deal of pressure in his role. ''Persona 5'' was the first time Production I.G had worked on the series, though many staff at the studio were fans. Despite this, the studio did not change their standard animation process, focusing on characters as they had done for many of their previous projects. The most important part of the cutscenes was getting the character's expressions right, particularly when it came to the general-mute protagonist. The game's animated opening sequence was directed by [[Sayo Yamamoto]].<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/> The concept behind the characters figure skating around the environment was done as a visual symbolization of the game's overall theme, breaking free of an oppressive force, and was similar to her work in ''[[Yuri on Ice]]''.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The scene where Joker first summoned his Persona was requested by Atlus to appear \"wild\", which again was difficult to Joker's purpose as an extension of the player. The blue flame effects related to the Persona were not created with CGI, but hand-drawn by the animators. All the anime cutscenes together were estimated as containing over an hour of footage.<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe game's original score was composed, performed, and produced by series sound director [[Shoji Meguro]].<ref name=\"P5liners\"/> Further contributions, among other general sound design, was handled by Toshiki Konishi, Kenichi Tsuchiya, Atsushi Kitajoh, and Ryota Kozuka; all of them having previously worked on the series as well.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Meguro was given full creative freedom to work on the soundtrack, with around 80% of the tracks used in the game being his, which lasted around three years in total.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Seven tracks were performed in English by Lyn Inaizumi, a [[jazz]] and [[soul music]] singer.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/><ref name=\"LynTwitter\"/> Her first performance in a video game, Inaizumi claimed that the most difficult part of her contributions was performing a rap segment in the opening theme, \"Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There\".<ref name=\"PSCmusic\"/> The lyrics were written by Benjamin Franklin, while the ending song, \"Hoshi To Bokura To\", had lyrics written in Japanese by Shigeo Komori.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/>\n\nTo express the game's mood, Meguro incorporated strong [[acid jazz]] elements into the score.<ref name=\"SilComposer\"/> He also aimed to make the music sound more realistic than previous ''Persona'' games, aiming to match the game's visuals.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Meguro also changed the way the music flowed when compared to the last two ''Persona'' games. Instead of the opening and ending themes being conglomerates of the overall score, he described the entire score as a single continuous work. A recurring musical element he included was described as a \"[[Solmization|do-la]]\" syllable: the opening used \"so la re mi\" on strings as a hook, which then led into the \"do-la\" syllable for other tracks, including the normal battle theme. While he was creating the music, Meguro received positive comments from Hashino when he made early tracks created for an internal demo.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/>\n\nA three-disc soundtrack was released in Japan by Mastard Records on January 17, 2017.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Upon its debut, the album reached fifth on the [[Oricon]] charts with sales of over 29,000.<ref name=\"P5OSToricon\"/> The album featured 110 tracks with commentary from the sound team, while the cover and [[liner note]] artwork were designed by Soejima.<ref name=\"P5AlbumInfo\"/> In addition to the soundtrack, a 19-track disc featuring a selection of the main themes from the game, ''Persona 5: Sounds of the Rebellion'', was released as part of the North American and European collector's edition bundle.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> The complete soundtrack later received a localized English release on [[iTunes]] on April 18, 2017, and on vinyl later that year by [[iam8bit]].<ref name=\"P5ostItunes\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Arif|first1=Shabana|title=Persona 5's complete soundtrack is available to pre-order on vinyl as a 6 LP deluxe edition for $175|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|website=VG24/7|accessdate=January 2, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102141737/https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|archivedate=January 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Sega promotional models and Persona 5 title, Taipei Game Show 20170123.jpg|thumb|Promotion of ''Persona 5'' at the 2017 Taipei Game Show]]\n''Persona 5'' was first announced with a teaser trailer in 2013, alongside spin-off games ''[[Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Persona 4: Dancing All Night]]'', and the [[PlayStation 3]] [[Porting|port]] of ''[[Persona 4 Arena Ultimax]]''.<ref name=\"PolyPersona\" /> The game was originally announced for a late 2014 release exclusively for the PlayStation 3. During a Sony press conference in September 2014, it was announced that the game would also be released for the PlayStation 4, also announcing that it had been delayed into 2015. According to director Katsura Hashino, the game was delayed to fully develop for the PlayStation 4, and improve the general quality of the game for both versions.<ref name=\"PersonaPS4\" /> The game's first gameplay trailer was revealed during a special livestream on February 5, 2015. A [[Blu-ray Disc]] containing an exclusive trailer for the game was bundled with first print copies of ''Persona 4: Dancing All Night'' in Japan on June 25, 2015.<ref name=\"ANNreveal\" /> The song used in the first gameplay trailer was an instrumental version of the main theme.<ref name=\"SilComposer\" /> During a special livestream for the game at the 2015 [[Tokyo Game Show]], it was announced that the game would be delayed once again to late 2016.<ref name=\"GIdelay\" /> Speaking in a staff interview, Hashino apologized for the delay and stated that it was necessary to deliver a high-quality product without having to hold back in terms of content.<ref name=\"PersonaDelay\" />\n\nIn April 2016, Atlus launched an official countdown relating to the game that counted down to May 5, 2016.

The game is chronologically the sixth installment in the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, which is part of the larger ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise. It was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation 4]] in Japan in September 2016 and worldwide in April 2017. It was published by Atlus in Japan and North America and by [[Deep Silver]] in Europe and Australia. An expanded version featuring new content, '''''Persona 5 Royal''''',{{efn|Known as ''Persona 5: The Royal'' {{nihongo||\u30da\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca5 \u30b6\u30fb\u30ed\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb|Perusona Faibu Za Roiyaru}} in Japanese}} was released in Japan in October 2019 and worldwide in March 2020.\n\n''Persona 5'' takes place in modern-day [[Tokyo]] and follows [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] after his transfer to Shujin Academy due to being put on probation for an assault of which he was falsely accused. During a school year, he and other students awaken to special powers, becoming a group of secret [[vigilante]]s known as the [[Phantom Thieves of Hearts]]. They explore the Metaverse, a supernatural realm born from humanity's subconscious desires, to steal malevolent intent from the hearts of adults. As with previous games in the series, the party battles enemies known as Shadows using physical manifestations of their psyche known as the [[Persona (series)#Personas|Persona]]. The game incorporates role-playing and [[dungeon crawl]]ing elements alongside [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] scenarios.\n\n''Persona 5'' was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus led by game director and producer [[Katsura Hashino]]. Along with Hashino, returning staff from earlier ''Persona'' games included character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]] and music composer [[Shoji Meguro]]. Preparatory work began during the development of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning after the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011. First announced in 2013, ''Persona 5'' was delayed from its original late 2014 release date due to the game not being fully finished. The game's themes revolved around attaining freedom from the limitations of modern society, while its story was strongly inspired by [[picaresque fiction]] and the party's Personas being based on well-known literary outlaws and rebels.\n\n''Persona 5'' was met with critical acclaim, with praise given to its visual presentation and art direction, cast, gameplay, and music. The game is considered to be one of the greatest role-playing games of all time and was nominated for and won multiple awards. The game shipped over three million copies worldwide by the end of 2019, making it the best-selling entry in the overall ''Megami Tensei'' franchise. Several other media, including two spin-off games, ''[[Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight]]'' and ''[[Persona 5 Scramble]]'', as well as manga and [[Persona 5: The Animation|anime adaptations]], have also been released. The game's cast has also made appearances in other games, such as Joker appearing as a playable character in the 2018 crossover fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{See also|Persona (series)#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of the Persona series}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| footer = [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], the game's protagonist, has two alternating lifestyles: a normal student life ''(top)'', and adventures into otherworldly locations ''(bottom)''.\n| image1 = Persona 5 Classroom.jpg\n| width1 = 250\n| image2 = Persona 5 Palace Combat.jpg\n| width2 = 250\n}}\n''Persona 5'' is a [[role-playing video game]] where the player takes on the role of a high school student, codenamed [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], who lives out a single year while attending school in modern-day [[Tokyo]]. The game is governed by a day-night cycle and weather systems that determine general behavior similar to a [[social simulation game]]. The year is punctuated by both scripted and random events as Joker attends school. He can perform part-time jobs and pursue leisure activities or create battle items. These various activities raise character attributes, which grant passive [[Status effect#Buffs|buffing]] effects during battle.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/> When in the real world, the main protagonist can develop character relationships known as ''Confidants''; an evolution of the ''Social Link'' system from ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''[[Persona 4]]''. With this system, the main protagonist can converse with and improve his relationship with other characters he meets, with some leading to possible romances. Improving Confidant ranks with [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] members unlocks various abilities for use in combat, such as the \"Baton Pass\" ability, which allows the player to directly select another character after a critical hit while granting a temporary attack boost.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/> Improving ranks with non-party Confidants grant other bonuses, such as giving access to new [[Item (gaming)|items]] and equipment and boosting [[experience point]] and yen gain.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nAlongside the normal school life is [[dungeon crawl]]ing gameplay of two different types within a realm called the Metaverse: story-specific dungeons called Palaces and randomly-generated Mementos dungeons. Both are populated by Shadows, physical manifestations of suppressed psyches that are modeled after mythological and religious figures. Within Mementos dungeons, the party can fulfill requests from [[non-playable character]]s (NPCs) received from a \"Confidant\" links.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> While navigating, the party uses stealth to avoid the sight of enemy Shadows, and some areas hold puzzles that can be solved using an insight ability known as \"Third Eye\",<ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/> which highlights interactable objects and enemy strength compared to the party. When exploring story-centered Palaces, an \"Alertness Meter\" is present, where the party being spotted or fleeing combat results in security being raised. If security reaches 100%, the party is forced to leave the Palace. The Alertness level can be lowered by launching surprise attacks on and eliminating enemies, and also lowers automatically overnight.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/> Throughout Palaces are locations known as \"safe rooms\". In them, the player can [[Saved game|save their game]], heal their party, and [[fast travel]] to other safe rooms within the Palace.\n\nAs with previous entries in the series, the game uses a [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] combat system: battles can be initiated when the party runs into an enemy, or they can launch a surprise attack and gain an advantage in battle. In battle, the party has access to both melee and gun weapons, in addition to being able to summon Personas, manifestations of the main characters' inner psyche used mainly for special attacks.<ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"ShackMasks\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |title=Persona 5 Royal New PS4 Game 2020?? |last=Teja|first=Ravi |publisher=Raviteja|date=March 4, 2020 |accessdate=March 4, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830213249/https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |archivedate=March 4, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ShackMasks\"/> If a character strikes an enemy's weakness, they knock the enemy down and are awarded an additional turn. If all enemies are knocked down, a \"Hold Up\" is triggered. During one, the party can launch a devastating \"All-Out Attack\", demand money or items, or enter a negotiation. Negotiation allows Joker to win the selected Shadow over to their side to become a new Persona: they can only be persuaded to join if Joker is their level or higher.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"DigiGameplay\"/> Similar to previous entries, party members can be knocked out, and if the main character is knocked out, the game ends. At times, if a party member is knocked out, they can be captured by enemy Shadows, and is unable to return to the party if the resultant negotiation fails.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\nNew Personas are gained from battle through successful negotiation, and different Persona types are represented through different arcana linked to Confidant links. Personas can be combined, or \"fused\", or otherwise further manipulated within the Velvet Room, a realm Joker visits as part of his journey through the story.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/><ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/> In the Velvet Room, Personas can be fused with \"Guillotine\" fusion processes, with the resultant Persona inheriting skills and stats from its parents. The more skills a Persona has, the more are passed on to the fused Persona. How powerful Personas are through fusion depends on how advanced its associated Confidant link is. Also, Personas can be sacrificed in various ways, also styled after styles of capital punishment: \"Hanging\" grants a sacrificed Persona's experience points to another chosen Persona, and \"Electric Chair\" sacrifice one to create a high-end item. A Persona can also be sent into \"Solitary Confinement\", where they undergo intensive training and gain additional skills quicker than normal. The number of days a Persona must remain to gain strength lessens based on its arcana strength.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/>\n\nMinor multiplayer elements are incorporated into the game through the \"Thieves Guild\" feature. Similar to the \"Vox Populi\" system from ''Persona 4 Golden'', players have the option of seeing what activities other players did during any given day. Players can send messages to each other, in addition to affecting the Alertness meter in the player's favor, and aiding in battle when a party member is taken hostage by an enemy.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting and characters===\n{{Main Article|List of Persona 5 characters}}\n''Persona 5'' takes place within the ''Persona'' universe, revolving around a group of high school students who harness Personas, physical manifestations of their inner psyche.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/> ''Persona 5'' is set in modern-day Tokyo, in April of the year \"20XX\", with navigable real-world locations within the city including [[Akihabara]], [[Shinjuku]] and [[Shibuya]].<ref name=\"P5year\"/> Alongside larger environments, there are specific locations that can be entered, such as shops, restaurants and movie theaters. A major setting throughout the game is Shujin Academy, a high school that the protagonist attends.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/> The second major location is the \"Metaverse\", a supernatural realm consisting of the physical manifestation of humanity's subconscious desires. In the Metaverse, people with corrupted enough desires form their own unique \"Palace\", which is modeled after their distorted perception of the world, along with a Shadow version of themselves possessing a \"Treasure\" symbolic of their desires.<ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"PMythDetail\"/> Returning from earlier entries is the Velvet Room, a place that exists for the growth of Persona users that shifts appearance depending on the current guest: in ''Persona 5'', it takes the form of a prison.<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe [[player character]] is a [[silent protagonist]], a commonplace feature in other ''Persona'' games, codenamed [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]]. He becomes the leader of a [[vigilante]] group known as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, who change the hearts of criminals and other malevolent people through the Metaverse.<ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> He forms it with Morgana, a mysterious cat-like creature who serves as the Thieves' second-in-command, who wants to discover his origins and restore his true form. Other founding members include school delinquent Ryuji Sakamoto and fashion model Ann Takamaki. More people join the group throughout the game, including art prodigy Yusuke Kitagawa, student council president [[Makoto Niijima]], [[hikikomori]] computer hacker Futaba Sakura, and cultured corporate heiress Haru Okumura.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Also interacting with Joker are Goro Akechi, a high school detective; Sae Niijima, public prosecutor and Makoto's older sister; and the residents of the Velvet Room, Igor and his two assistants Caroline and Justine.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"KotakuLysis\"/> Joker also has interactions with other confidants, including his caretaker and Futaba's adoptive father Sojiro Sakura, classmate Yuuki Mishima, his teacher and part-time maid Sadayo Kawakami, arcade gamer Shinya Oda, journalist Ichiko Ohya, [[fortune teller]] Chihaya Mifune, [[shogi]] master Hifumi Togo, doctor Tae Takemi, politician Toranosuke Yoshida, and [[model gun]] store owner Munehisa Iwai.\n\n===Plot===\nAfter Joker defends a woman from being abused by a drunken man on the street, he is falsely charged with assault and put on [[probation]], resulting in expulsion from his school. Joker is sent to Tokyo to stay with his family associate Sojiro Sakura and attend Shujin Academy during his year-long probation. After his arrival, he is drawn into the Velvet Room, where Igor warns him that he must \"rehabilitate\" to avoid forthcoming ruin, and grants him access to a supernatural mobile app that leads Joker into the Metaverse and the Palace of the school's abusive volleyball coach Suguru Kamoshida. Joker meets Morgana, who informs him of the ability to change wicked people's hearts by stealing their \"Treasure\", the emotional root of their behavior, from the Palaces ruled by their Shadow selves. After successfully reforming Kamoshida, Ryuji, Joker, Ann, and Morgana form the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, stealing corruption from the hearts of adults to reform the city.\n\nAs the number of the Phantom Thieves' members and successes grows, they attract the attention of the public and police, including public prosecutor Sae Niijima and detective prodigy Goro Akechi. The Phantom Thieves learn that another secret group, including a black-masked assassin, is using the Metaverse to murder their targets and then framing the Phantom Thieves of Hearts for the killings. In pursuit of the conspiracy, the group is joined by Akechi, who is subsequently revealed to be the black-masked assassin. Escaping into hiding with Sae's help, the Phantom Thieves deduce that the conspiracy's leader is politician Masayoshi Shido, who has been using Akechi's ability to infiltrate the Metaverse to remove obstacles to his becoming Prime Minister and imposing his reforms on Japan, as well as the one who pressed assault charges against Joker. When the Phantom Thieves infiltrate Shido's Palace, they face Akechi, who reveals himself to be Shido's illegitimate son. He also reveals that he has been secretly plotting to exact his revenge on Shido for years of neglect and summons his true Persona: Loki. Once defeated, Akechi sacrifices himself to protect the Phantom Thieves from a group of enemies, allowing them to escape and reach Shido.\n\nDespite Shido's arrest and confession after his change of heart, the public remains uninterested and has lost trust in both authority and the Phantom Thieves. In response, the Phantom Thieves make a final heist to infiltrate the depths of Mementos and steal the treasure at its core. Inside, they discover that the public is in chaos and has chosen to give up their autonomy. The Phantom Thieves are then ejected from Mementos by the Treasure, taking form as the Holy Grail, and vanish after witnessing the Metaverse merge with reality. Waking in the Velvet Room, Joker confronts Igor, Caroline, and Justine. Caroline and Justine regain their memories and merge into Lavenza, their true form. Lavenza reveals the Igor Joker has been seeing in the Velvet room up until this point to be an imposter who imprisoned the real Igor. The imposter is then revealed to be [[Yaldabaoth]], the Holy Grail, who was created from humanity's wish to give up control. Through a bet made with Igor over humanity's goals, Yaldabaoth had given Joker and Akechi their abilities to see whether the world would be preserved or be destroyed through their actions, all while steering the game in his favor.\n\nJoker rejects Yaldabaoth's offer to return to his world at the cost of his freedom, and he, along with the rest of the Phantom Thieves, fight him. Joker's confidants rally the popular support of the people, rebelling against Yaldabaoth's control of humanity and allowing Joker to awaken his ultimate persona to destroy Yaldabaoth and the Metaverse. After Yaldabaoth's defeat, in order for Shido to be prosecuted, Joker must turn himself into the police. While Joker is incarcerated, the rest of the Phantom Thieves and his confidants successfully help secure evidence of Joker's innocence in the assault charge, leading to his conviction being overturned. By spring, Joker's friends drive him back to his hometown.\n\n===''Royal''===\nIn ''Persona 5 Royal'', two new characters interact with the Phantom Thieves: Kasumi Yoshizawa, an accomplished rhythmic gymnast who transferred to Shujin at the same time as the protagonist, and Takuto Maruki, a school counselor hired after Kamoshida is exposed. Kasumi awakens to her Persona after calling the protagonist to a new Palace in Odaiba that quickly vanishes. Maruki, in turn, talks to each of the Phantom Thieves, learning their deepest wishes. After defeating Yaldabaoth, the still-living Akechi turns himself over to Sae in the protagonist's place. At the beginning of the following year, the protagonist finds reality distorted; Akechi was released without reason, and each Phantom Thief member has had their deepest wish granted. The protagonist and Akechi, together with the also-aware Kasumi, return to the Odaiba Palace and investigate. The Palace's master is Maruki, who reveals that \"Kasumi\" is Sumire, sister to the original Kasumi, who died in a car accident saving Sumire.\n\nMaruki can use his Persona to alter a person's reality, with his first use of it being to make his then-girlfriend forget her parents' murder. Yaldabaoth's manipulation of the world drove Maruki and his Persona over the edge, and they became the new controllers of Mementos and warped all reality into a dream-like ideal. Sumire turns against the protagonist to protect her identity as \"Kasumi.\" The protagonist snaps his friends out of Maruki's reality, then frees Sumire from his influence. Depending on player choices, it is revealed that Akechi's survival is dependant on the new reality, and Maruki offers the protagonist the option of accepting it to save Akechi. Refusing the offer, the reformed Phantom Thieves, including Akechi and Sumire, defeat Maruki. Reality returns to normal, and with Akechi missing and the protagonist in prison.\n\nOn their final meeting after the protagonist's release, each member of the Phantom Thieves chooses to pursue their dreams within the current reality. On the day he is due to return home, the protagonist escapes tailing government agents with help from both the Phantom Thieves and a reformed Maruki. At the station, Sumire bids him farewell. If Akechi's confidant level is at its highest, and with the right dialogue choices, a man wearing Akechi's clothes is briefly seen passing through the train window that the protagonist is riding.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus dedicated to handling the ''Persona'' series. Preparatory development of the game began in 2008, following the release of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning following the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011.<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/><ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Hashino was only fully involved in development after ''Catherine'' was finished, later calling the latter game a test for the next ''Persona'' game's development. Development lasted five years.<ref name=\"PersonaBlog\"/><ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> ''Persona 5'' would be Hashino's last game in the series as the leader of P-Studio, as he would afterwards form a separate internal team called Studio Zero.<ref name=\"P5studioA\"/><ref name=\"P5studioB\"/> When production started, the staff consisted of around 40 people. During full production, this number expanded to 70: 15 planners, 15 programmers, and between 30 and 45 designers. These included the game's lead designer Naoya Maeda, who had previously done modeling work for the ''[[Trauma Center (video game series)|Trauma Center]]'' series. The general development was a challenge for the team, as they intentionally changed their development structure due to the more powerful hardware they were working with.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/>\n\nWhile the final game retained the turn-based system from earlier entries, one of the early design drafts was for an action-based system incorporating real-time elements foreign to the series. This idea was ultimately scrapped, but real-time command elements were introduced into the battle system, allowing the gameplay to evolve without extensive changes to the core system.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> A major new addition was the inclusions of unique dungeons with locked layouts as opposed to the dominant randomly generated dungeons of previous ''Persona'' games. This was done to both emulate the game's themes and provide veteran players with something different.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\"/> A returning feature from both earlier ''Persona'' games and the mainline ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series was Negotiation: as it was considered a key part of the overall franchise by fans, Hashino decided to reintroduce it after being absent from the previous two mainline entries. The Negotiation system for ''Persona 5'' was tied into the origins of Shadows as suppressed psyches within the Collective Unconscious. The \"Hold Up\" function was inspired by scenes in films where the antagonist would hold people at gunpoint and make demands. These functions were incorporated due to the game being in part a celebration of the series' history.<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> While designing the gameplay elements, the weather, and environmental elements were all designed to reflect the real world. Dungeon layout was split into three distinct types: the Tokyo overworld environments, \"institutions\" such as Joker's high school, and dungeon environments.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Some segments took control away from the player aside from limited dialogue choices; this was chosen as it reflected the controlled environment of Japanese high schoolers.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/>\n\nWhile ''Catherine'' used the third-party [[Gamebryo]] [[game engine]], ''Persona 5'' used a specially-created engine. Hashino believed that the new engine would make rendering their ideas much easier, although it would result in a long wait by fans for the game.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CathBryon\"/> The event scene software was also developed internally by Atlus, with an estimated 1,160 being featured in the final game. The tools for developing and handling them were greatly expanded over the previous two entries to properly communicate them to players on the more advanced hardware.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Character modeling, in general, was handled with a specially-developed toon shader which helped properly translate the character designs into the game, while also allowing for easy adjustment of shaders and lighting effects during fine-tuning.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> The characters were originally rendered realistically like in ''Catherine'', but the team felt that it was \"wrong\" for the ''Persona'' series. With this in mind, the team did some trial and error before finding a style that satisfied them, doing something similar for the interface and menu design.<ref name=\"P5magazine\"/> In contrast to ''Persona 4'', which had a general deformed look to hardware limitations on the variety of body shapes, the technology available to the team for ''Persona 5'' enabled unique customization for all relevant character models. Two different models were used for members of the main cast: a detailed model for real-time cutscenes, and a general-use model for general event scenes and gameplay.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> ''Persona 5'' was the first time a large number of Personas had been rendered in high definition, something which proved a grueling challenge for the team.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/>\n\n===Story and themes===\nThe original story concept was written by Hashino, while the scenario was co-written by Shinji Yamamoto and Yuichiro Tanaka.<ref name=\"P5credits\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/> The initial concept was for a storyline that diverged from the established paths of ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'', with \"self-discovery\" and \"journey\" being its keywords.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Originally using the concept of a [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking trip]] around the world as a framing device for the story, Hashino decided to refocus on Japan in the wake of the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]].<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> More specifically, it has been noted that the Japanese government's actions in response to the earthquake and tsunami's fallout, along with Japanese citizens' reactions to how the government acted during that time, may have served as partial influences on the game's themes.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|title=The Real-World Problems Behind Persona 5|last=McCarthy|first=Caty|date=May 5, 2017|website=USgamer|language=en|access-date=June 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603100720/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|archive-date=June 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Following that crisis and seeing how people were bonding in the face of it, Hashino decided to have the story take place solely in Japan, with the journeying being done through the ever-shifting Palaces.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Ultimately, the story's central concepts were inspired by equivalent social changes he saw in modern society, particularly in Japan.<ref name=\"PMythDetail\" /> Hashino also described the central theme of the game as being about freedom and how the characters attain it.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> He wanted to make the game more \"thematically approachable\" for newcomers to the series, and to be an emotional experience that left its audience with a strong sense of [[catharsis]] and the inspiration to take on problems in their lives.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/><ref name=\"SilCath\"/>\n\nThe narrative of ''Persona 5'' was designed like an omnibus, with the antagonists pursued by the party changing regularly.<ref name=\"P5persona\"/> As inspiration, the development team has also cited three main stories: the Chinese novel ''[[Water Margin]]'', the Japanese crime movie ''Hakuchuu no Shikaku'', and the Spanish novel ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]''.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> Furthermore, the setting and style was compared to a [[Picaresque novel|picaresque fiction]]; the team originally asked the question of how a character like [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]] might win appeal in modern society.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> This picaresque theme was carried over into the aesthetics of Persona fusion and sacrifice, which were themed after styles of capital punishment.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> Having a more \"stereotypical\" theme enabled the team to create surprising story developments, mixing contemporary drama with the setting of the ''Persona'' series. The series' recurring motif of \"masks\" was used more overtly in the game's plot than previous entries as well,<ref name=\"SilP5Fam\"/> and the game's main locations were based heavily on their real-world counterparts.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nThe main characters, according to Hashino, share a mindset that they \"no longer have a place where they belong in society\": the events of the game give them a sense of belonging.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Hashino stated that while the last few games were about the protagonists chasing the antagonists, ''Persona 5'' would instead more prominently feature the antagonists and phenomena caused by them chasing the protagonists during the latter's activities. The characters have been described as \"juvenile academics,\"<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> with their activities as thieves being part of the way they break from societal norms and express themselves. Adhering with this concept, the game's main aim was to show the characters finding the courage to go outside the normal limits of society as set by previous generations.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> In contrast to previous ''Persona'' casts, the party of ''Persona 5'' willingly embrace the unfolding unusual events in their role of masked vigilantes rather than being dragged into them.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> The cast was originally going to be larger with character Hifumi Togo becoming a Phantom Thief, but as the story was already very large, she was relegated to an optional role as part of the Confidant system.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> Technological advances such as [[smartphones]] and the use of [[social media]] were integrated into both the story and gameplay due to their growing prevalence in modern society and how the public responds to real-world scandals.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe characters' initial Personas ([[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin|Ars\u00e8ne]], [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]], [[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]], [[Zorro]], [[Ishikawa Goemon|Goemon]], [[Pope Joan|Johanna]], [[Necronomicon]], [[Milady de Winter|Milady]], [[Robin Hood]]) were themed after outlaws and picaresque heroes to reflect the function and dominant suppressed passions forming the Palace, and also represent aspects of their owners' personalities.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> Joker's initial Persona was originally the German demon [[Mephistopheles]], but it was changed to Ars\u00e8ne as the latter character better fit the game's themes.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> The cast's alternate Personas ([[Satan]]ael, [[Sun Wukong|Seiten Taisei]], [[Hecate]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]], [[Susano-o|Kamu Susanoo]], [[Anat]], [[Prometheus]], [[Astarte]], [[Loki]]) are taken from mythical beings who act as tricksters or rebels.<ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> The three main inspirations behind Joker's alter ego were [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin]], [[The Fiend with Twenty Faces]], and Japanese outlaw hero Ishikawa Goemon.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> The name of Joker's high school, \"Shujin\", was chosen because it was a [[homonym]] of {{nihongo|''Sh\u016bjin''|\u56da\u4eba}}, the Japanese word for \"prisoner\".<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaB\"/> Following a trend from earlier entries, the Velvet Room assistants are named after characters from the novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]].<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe use of adults as antagonists was a more overt expression of narrative elements previously explored in ''Persona 4''. The relation to police activities was also carried over from ''Persona 4'', but this time with the role of protagonists and antagonists reversed.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\" /> Several writers have highlighted the parallels between the game's various antagonists and real incidents/figures in different sectors of Japanese society (e.g. political, corporate, academic), and how the game's story and characters serve as social commentary on life in Japan.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|title=The Real Japan Behind Persona 5|last=Gay|first=Elliot|date=May 12, 2017|website=Anime News Network|language=en|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630013134/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|archive-date=June 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The game's villains and protagonists were also constructed to be parallels of each other, both groups being misfits trying to shape a world they saw as unsatisfactory or corrupted. This was intended to create moral ambiguity about the Phantom Thieves' actions, causing the player to question their concept of justice and their mission as a whole.<ref name=\"4Gstory\" /> In addition, the way a vocal minority online could draw attention to and shift public opinion on events and scandals in the news was cited as an inspiration for the ambiguous nature of the Phantom Thieves' actions.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\" />\n\n===Art design===\n[[Shigenori Soejima]], who had worked on the last two main-series ''Persona'' games, returned as character designer.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> The game's art director was Masayoshi Suto, whose most notable work on earlier games included the [[user interface]] (UI) displays.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> The art design reflected the picaresque theme aimed for by the rest of the team.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> As the team considered previous ''Persona'' games to be \"fun\" but not well marketed, they designed the UI in such a way as to attract a larger, more mainstream audience.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/> According to Soejima, he was working on prospective designs for the game while ''Persona 4'' was still in development, with his designs evolving as the story for ''Persona 5'' came together.<ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/> Aesthetically, the team felt that they were picking up where ''Persona 4'' left off. Its styling presentation was an unintentional reflection on the hurdles the team needed to overcome during development.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> Following the respective thematic coloring of ''Persona 3'' and ''4''{{'s}} blue and yellow, ''Persona 5'' used red, which was chosen to a harsh feeling.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/><ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Because of this, Suto tested multiple font colors until settling on black and white, as it stood out best against it.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> There was also a wish, especially in the teaser image used for the game's announcement, which represented the main characters' being chained down by the rules of the modern world.<ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Soejima designed the logo to convey the high-speed existences of the young cast, while elements such as Joker's Persona Ars\u00e8ne were designed to appear old-fashioned by comparison. This presented challenges as Soejima needed to balance this with a strong sense of style.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The main aim for the game's environments was to create a sense of realism, with Tokyo being modeled after real locations.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=Persona 5's In-Game Locations Compared To The Real World|url=https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|website=Kotaku|accessdate=January 27, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031184625/https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|archivedate=October 31, 2017}}</ref> When creating the UI, Hashino wanted to demonstrate how a shift in perspective could alter a dull life into an exciting one in the context of the story. Early UI designs were so \"aggressively animated\" that it obscured what was happening in the game. Because of this, the animations were toned down and text orientation was altered, toning down the UI's graphical elements to present a balance between user-friendliness and style.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/> Rather than the use of sub-colors for earlier entries, the UI used only the primary red, black and white colors aside from health and magic point meters, with the menus using a special moving 3D model of Joker which would change position depending on the selected menu.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/>\n\nThe first character sketches were submitted in 2012.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaB\"/> Soejima worked closely with Hashino so the characters and environments reflected the game's themes.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> Due to being high school students, Soejima found it difficult to make each main character's uniform design distinctive, so he expressed their individuality through their thief costumes.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Joker's design was cited by Soejima as his most challenging recent work. Joker needed to both convey a taste of the game's overall art style and to act as an avatar for the player. As the main theme and narrative of ''Persona 5'' revolved around crime and vigilantes triggered by Joker voluntarily choosing that path, Soejima needed to convey this while allowing the character to suit whatever dialogue choices the player decided upon. Due to these difficulties, Joker was given multiple designs in a trial and error process to find the best one. As the \"phantom thief\" premise was a common stereotype in fiction, Soejima initially drew Joker and main cast in a style similar to [[sh\u014dnen manga]], but these designs were scrapped as they clashed with the ''Persona'' series' realistic aesthetics. As with previous entries, Joker was a silent character, so as with previous protagonist Soejima had to work out a way he could communicate without dialogue. His solution was to imagine him as the type of person who made plans but did not share them with others.<ref name=\"FamSoejima\"/> The Persona designs, being based on characters from literature, were intended to evoke both familiarity and surprise from players. Once the names were chosen, Soejima designed the Personas based on that character.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/>\n\nThe game's animated [[cutscene]]s were produced by [[Production I.G]] and Domerica, and were directed and supervised by Toshiyuki Kono.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"Domerica\"/> Kono was contacted three and a half years before the game's completion by Hashino: faced with the project, Kono felt a great deal of pressure in his role. ''Persona 5'' was the first time Production I.G had worked on the series, though many staff at the studio were fans. Despite this, the studio did not change their standard animation process, focusing on characters as they had done for many of their previous projects. The most important part of the cutscenes was getting the character's expressions right, particularly when it came to the general-mute protagonist. The game's animated opening sequence was directed by [[Sayo Yamamoto]].<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/> The concept behind the characters figure skating around the environment was done as a visual symbolization of the game's overall theme, breaking free of an oppressive force, and was similar to her work in ''[[Yuri on Ice]]''.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The scene where Joker first summoned his Persona was requested by Atlus to appear \"wild\", which again was difficult to Joker's purpose as an extension of the player. The blue flame effects related to the Persona were not created with CGI, but hand-drawn by the animators. All the anime cutscenes together were estimated as containing over an hour of footage.<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe game's original score was composed, performed, and produced by series sound director [[Shoji Meguro]].<ref name=\"P5liners\"/> Further contributions, among other general sound design, was handled by Toshiki Konishi, Kenichi Tsuchiya, Atsushi Kitajoh, and Ryota Kozuka; all of them having previously worked on the series as well.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Meguro was given full creative freedom to work on the soundtrack, with around 80% of the tracks used in the game being his, which lasted around three years in total.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Seven tracks were performed in English by Lyn Inaizumi, a [[jazz]] and [[soul music]] singer.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/><ref name=\"LynTwitter\"/> Her first performance in a video game, Inaizumi claimed that the most difficult part of her contributions was performing a rap segment in the opening theme, \"Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There\".<ref name=\"PSCmusic\"/> The lyrics were written by Benjamin Franklin, while the ending song, \"Hoshi To Bokura To\", had lyrics written in Japanese by Shigeo Komori.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/>\n\nTo express the game's mood, Meguro incorporated strong [[acid jazz]] elements into the score.<ref name=\"SilComposer\"/> He also aimed to make the music sound more realistic than previous ''Persona'' games, aiming to match the game's visuals.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Meguro also changed the way the music flowed when compared to the last two ''Persona'' games. Instead of the opening and ending themes being conglomerates of the overall score, he described the entire score as a single continuous work. A recurring musical element he included was described as a \"[[Solmization|do-la]]\" syllable: the opening used \"so la re mi\" on strings as a hook, which then led into the \"do-la\" syllable for other tracks, including the normal battle theme. While he was creating the music, Meguro received positive comments from Hashino when he made early tracks created for an internal demo.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/>\n\nA three-disc soundtrack was released in Japan by Mastard Records on January 17, 2017.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Upon its debut, the album reached fifth on the [[Oricon]] charts with sales of over 29,000.<ref name=\"P5OSToricon\"/> The album featured 110 tracks with commentary from the sound team, while the cover and [[liner note]] artwork were designed by Soejima.<ref name=\"P5AlbumInfo\"/> In addition to the soundtrack, a 19-track disc featuring a selection of the main themes from the game, ''Persona 5: Sounds of the Rebellion'', was released as part of the North American and European collector's edition bundle.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> The complete soundtrack later received a localized English release on [[iTunes]] on April 18, 2017, and on vinyl later that year by [[iam8bit]].<ref name=\"P5ostItunes\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Arif|first1=Shabana|title=Persona 5's complete soundtrack is available to pre-order on vinyl as a 6 LP deluxe edition for $175|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|website=VG24/7|accessdate=January 2, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102141737/https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|archivedate=January 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Sega promotional models and Persona 5 title, Taipei Game Show 20170123.jpg|thumb|Promotion of ''Persona 5'' at the 2017 Taipei Game Show]]\n''Persona 5'' was first announced with a teaser trailer in 2013, alongside spin-off games ''[[Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Persona 4: Dancing All Night]]'', and the [[PlayStation 3]] [[Porting|port]] of ''[[Persona 4 Arena Ultimax]]''.<ref name=\"PolyPersona\" /> The game was originally announced for a late 2014 release exclusively for the PlayStation 3. During a Sony press conference in September 2014, it was announced that the game would also be released for the PlayStation 4, also announcing that it had been delayed into 2015. According to director Katsura Hashino, the game was delayed to fully develop for the PlayStation 4, and improve the general quality of the game for both versions.<ref name=\"PersonaPS4\" /> The game's first gameplay trailer was revealed during a special livestream on February 5, 2015. A [[Blu-ray Disc]] containing an exclusive trailer for the game was bundled with first print copies of ''Persona 4: Dancing All Night'' in Japan on June 25, 2015.<ref name=\"ANNreveal\" /> The song used in the first gameplay trailer was an instrumental version of the main theme.<ref name=\"SilComposer\" /> During a special livestream for the game at the 2015 [[Tokyo Game Show]], it was announced that the game would be delayed once again to late 2016.<ref name=\"GIdelay\" /> Speaking in a staff interview, Hashino apologized for the delay and stated that it was necessary to deliver a high-quality product without having to hold back in terms of content.<ref name=\"PersonaDelay\" />\n\nIn April 2016, Atlus launched an official countdown relating to the game that counted down to May 5, 2016. Shortly after, a special [[livestream]] was announced titled ''Take Tokyo Tower'', which would coincide with the countdown date. During the Take Tokyo Tower livestream on that day, the release date for the game was revealed in a trailer shown during the livestream. The game was released in Japan on September 15, 2016.<ref name=\"IGNtake\"/> Along with the standard edition, a ''20th Anniversary Edition'' was released, which features all [[downloadable content]] (DLC) based on ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'', a five-CD [[best-of]] album set featuring music from all six main games in the series, and the official artbook for the game by Soejima.<ref name=\"GemRelease\"/> In honor of the game's Japanese release, the series-focused variety show ''Persona Stalker Club'' featured a new programming block titled ''Persona Stalker Club V''.<ref name=\"PSCchange\"/> In promotion of the game in Japan, Atlus partnered with [[AKG Acoustics]] to release a limited edition wireless [[headphone]] based on the one Futaba wears in-game.<ref name=\"AKG\">{{cite web|author1=Sato|title=Persona 5 Is Getting Futaba Sakura Collaboration Headphones From AKG|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2016/07/19/persona-5-getting-futaba-sakura-collaboration-headphones-akg/|website=Siliconera|accessdate=January 3, 2018|date=July 19, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522231221/http://www.siliconera.com/2016/07/19/persona-5-getting-futaba-sakura-collaboration-headphones-akg/|archivedate=May 22, 2017}}</ref> The headphones came with box art designed by Soejima, as well as a music CD featuring two remixed tracks from the game by Meguro and Kozuka.<ref name=\"AKG\"/> Certain character apparel from the game were also made and released in Japan, such as jackets and tote bags.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Sato|title=Persona 5 Is Getting Real-Life Ann's Hoodie And Futaba's Jacket, Supervised By Shigenori Soejima|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2017/09/28/persona-5-getting-real-life-anns-hoodie-futabas-jacket-supervised-shigenori-soejima/|website=Siliconera|accessdate=January 3, 2018|date=September 28, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103134832/http://www.siliconera.com/2017/09/28/persona-5-getting-real-life-anns-hoodie-futabas-jacket-supervised-shigenori-soejima/|archivedate=January 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Alistair|title=Persona 5 Tote Bags Were Probably Something You Did See Coming|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2017/11/28/persona-5-tote-bags-probably-something-see-coming/|website=Siliconera|accessdate=January 3, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103134801/http://www.siliconera.com/2017/11/28/persona-5-tote-bags-probably-something-see-coming/|archivedate=January 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFollowing its release, character skins and additional Personas were released as paid [[downloadable content]] (DLC). The costumes included those incorporated into the ''20th Anniversary Edition'' based on ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'', in addition to new costumes based on the characters of ''[[Revelations: Persona]]'', the ''Persona 2'' duology (''[[Persona 2: Innocent Sin|Innocent Sin]]'' and ''[[Persona 2: Eternal Punishment|Eternal Punishment]]''), ''[[Shin Megami Tensei If...]]'', ''Catherine'', ''[[Shin Megami Tensei IV]]'', ''[[Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army]]'', ''[[Persona 4 Arena]]'', and ''Dancing All Night''.<ref name=\"P5blogDLC\"/><ref name=\"P5dlc2\"/><ref name=\"P5dlcWest\"/> The costumes were accompanied by arranged battle music from each costume set's respective game, which replaces the default battle theme based on what costume Joker wears.

According to Namba, the team began with a \"blank slate\" when choosing the English voice cast, as it was a new setting to earlier ''Persona'' games.<ref name=\"P5local\"/> Localizing ''Persona 5'' was described by Namba as a massive project with the largest staff yet dedicated to the series.

He is a soccer referee, he is obsessed by the rules in life, as by the rules of the game. His partner leaves him and when he believes again only the presence of his nephews and his niece invades him.

He is a soccer referee, he is obsessed by the rules in life, as by the rules of the game. His partner leaves him and when he believes again only the presence of his nephews and his niece invades him.

A short time later their younger sister Valeria Marquesi ([[Florencia Bertotti]]) joins the presence of her two brothers that can no longer support the village life. Getting used to a style of coexistence bullanguero, chaotic for a rigid man is a problem. This is what life proposes with the arrival of his nephews and his niece and will gradually learn to manage it. This is also the story of Dolores \"Lola\" Montero (Millie Stegman) a woman who turns out to be hidden in two ways of being. On the one hand it is an efficient professional.

Guillermo Carmona ([[Mario Pasik]]) a man who, still loving her, maintains a certain selfishness that she does not initially perceive. Flattered, taken care of and believing in love, she starts the story by turning thirty in the midst of a crisis she doesn't understand.

The town directly borders [[Sengkang]] to the south and shares riverine boundaries with the planning area of [[Seletar]] to the west and [[Pasir Ris]] to the east. Bounding the town to the north and north-east is the [[Straits of Johor]], with [[Coney Island, Punggol|Coney Island]] included as a part of the Punggol planning area.\n\nUnder the Punggol 21 initiative, plans to turn the area into a new residential town were announced in 1996 and development of the town started in 1998. Due to the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the financial troubles within the construction industry in 2003, the plan did not fully materialise. In 2007, a new initiative, the Punggol 21-plus plan, was introduced to redevelop the area into a waterfront town. Punggol is divided into 11 districts, namely, Coney Island, Matilda, Northshore District, Punggol Central District, Punggol Field East, Punggol Field West, Punggol Downtown District, Punggol Point District, Canal District, Crescent District and Waterway West District.<ref>{{cite news |title=HDB to launch BTO projects in Punggol inspired by early zoo, fishing village |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/hdb-to-launch-bto-projects-in-punggol-inspired-by-early-zoo-11861836 |accessdate=1 September 2019 |work=CNA |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nPunggol Point or Tanjong Punggol appears as Tanjong Rangon on Franklin and [[Philip Jackson (surveyor)|Jackson's]] 1828 map of Singapore. ''Punggol'', also spelled Ponggol, means \"hurling sticks at the branches of fruit trees to bring them down to the ground\" in [[Malay language|Malay]]. It could also refer to a place where fruits and forest produce are offered wholesale and carried away. These possible names indicate that Punggol was a fruit growing district. The place is said to take its name from the river [[Sungei Punggol|Sungei Ponggol]].\n\nPonggol also means \"a stump of a tree\", especially \"a high stump\". There are suggestions that the word is [[Tamil language|Tamil]] ([[Thai Pongal|Pongal]], \"the feast of the boiling rice\", is celebrated when the sun enters the sign of [[Capricornus|Capricorn]]). However, the word ''Ponggol'' or ''Punggol'' is definitely [[Malay language|Malay]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Pw7 soo teck.jpg|thumb|The [[Punggol LRT Line|Punggol West LRT]] is located in relatively undeveloped surroundings in 2006. As of 2015, one can no longer view the LRT Station directly from this point of view. The plain area with [[Matilda House]] shown here, has been developed into new HDB flats and condominiums.]]\n\nLocated in the vicinity of the Punggol Jetty, Punggol was believed to have existed 200 years ago before [[Sir Stamford Raffles]] founded Singapore. The Punggol area used to be a well-established rural district dotted with farmhouses and farm structures, which were serviced by roads and dirt tracks. It was one of the oldest settlements in Singapore. The original settlers were predominantly [[Malays in Singapore|Malays]]. The early Chinese immigrants, who settled in Punggol from the mid 19th century onwards, were engaged in plantation work, mainly rubber. As the population of the Chinese increased, many Chinese villagers were then engaged in poultry, pig or fish farming, as well as farm produce. The last pig farm closed down in 1990. [[Hydroponic]] non-pollutive vegetable farms and orchid farms used to flourish along the Cheng Lim Farmways and Buangkok Farmways, along with old [[kampung|kampong]]s and low-rise residential areas. Most of these farms have given way to the high-rise [[Housing and Development Board|HDB]] [[apartment|flats]] of [[Sengkang New Town]] and Punggol New Town.\n\nHistorically, Punggol was populated mostly by [[Teochew people|Teochews]] and [[Catholic]]s. However, the original settlers were predominantly [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]]. The end of Upper Serangoon Road is known to Teochews as ''kangkar'' or \"[[river bank]]\" or \"[[river mouth]]\". [[Ferries]] were used on the [[Sungei Serangoon|Serangoon River]] as transport. An old market was also located here. The Catholic [[missionaries]] arrived here 140 years ago and set up churches and schools. A Malay kampong, which has since been cleared, could also be found at Tanjong Punggol. At the end of Punggol Port Road, Indonesian and Malaysian fishermen auctioned their catch at the wholesale fish market.\n\n===World War II===\nDuring the [[Second World War]] in 1942, about 400 Chinese civilians were massacred by the Japanese military forces at [[Punggol Point]], the northern tip of the area, in what was to be known as the Punggol Beach Massacre as part of the [[Sook Ching massacre]] during the [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore]]. Today, that location has been marked as a national [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] site, and a war memorial now exists at the area.\n\n===Post-war Punggol===\nIn the 1960s, basic amenities like piped water, electricity, paved roads, and [[Sewage|drainage systems]] were introduced through government and self-help programmes. It was also at this time that television became popular and antennas could be seen installed on many kampong rooftops.\n\nPunggol was also known for its sumptuous seafood and boatels that provided services like docking and renting of boats for boating, [[water skiing]] and [[Scuba diving|skindiving]] lessons. These seafood restaurants and boatels have since been relocated in the mid-1990s to facilitate [[land reclamation]] works.<ref name=\"Mak Mun San\">Only two out of the four seafood eateries that operated at the old Punggol Point until 1995 are still around in Singapore: {{cite news | author = Mak Mun San| title = Punggol revisited | work = [[The Sunday Times (Singapore)|The Sunday Times]] | date = 26 August 2007}}</ref> Poultry and pig farms were also gradually phased out when redevelopment commenced in the 1970s. The last pig farm closed down in 1990. Land vacated by resettled farmers were then tendered out on short term leases for non-pollutive agricultural activities, which included hydroponic non-pollutive vegetable and orchid farms that used to flourish along the Cheng Lim Farmways and Buangkok Farmways. These farms existed along with old kampongs and low-rise residential areas. Most of these farms have given way to the high-rise HDB flats of Sengkang New Town and [[Punggol New Town]].\n\n===Today===\n\n====Punggol 21====\n[[File:Singapore punggol 001 2002.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Punggol in 2002, with the first phase of the Punggol 21 plan completed]]\nIn his [[National Day Rally]] speech on 18 August 1996, then-Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] announced the [[Singapore Government]]'s plan to develop Punggol, known as \"Punggol 21\". Punggol 21 was a new model for housing, which would feature a new concept in housing as a model for new towns in the 21st century. It would have a mix of private houses, executive condominiums,<ref>[https://www.the-piermontgrand-ec.com Piermont Grand Executive Condominium By CDL]</ref> and high-grade HDB flats grouped into smaller, distinctly designed estates. Each estate would contain between 1,200 and 2,800 units, with a common neighbourhood green. Every housing unit would be located within 300 metres of the nearest [[Light Rail Transit (Singapore)|LRT]] station. Schools, libraries, and [[community centre|community clubs]] would be clustered for convenience, and there would be three commercial centres, including shopping centres.<ref name=\"Warren Fernandez\">{{cite news | author = Warren Fernandez| title = PM Goh urges young to rally behind him | work = [[The Straits Times]] | date = 19 August 1996| page=1}}</ref><ref name=\"The Straits Times Aug 1996\">{{cite news | title = Punggol 21| work = [[The Straits Times]] | date = 19 August 1996| page=24}}</ref>\n\nA few months after the speech, Punggol 21, which was part of [[Cheng San Group Representation Constituency]] then, became an election [[Carrot and stick|carrot]] for the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) to beat a [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]] team led by [[J.B.

Although construction began the next year, it was stopped when demand for new flats fell sharply. Plans were again delayed when the construction industry in Singapore experienced financial troubles in 2003. As a result, only some 16,000 flats, out of the 80,000 planned units, have been built as at 2007. There was only one shopping mall in the estate, Punggol Plaza, and there were no recreational facilities like [[Cinema (place)|cinemas]] or swimming pools.<ref name=\"Peh Shing Huei\"/><ref name=\"Jessica Cheam\">{{cite news | author = Jessica Cheam| title = Residents look forward to 'Punggol 21-plus'| work = [[The Straits Times]] | date = 22 August 2007}}</ref> As of January 2016, a second shopping mall in the estate, [[Waterway Point]], has opened, and recreational facilities have since been planned within the estate.\n\n====Punggol 21-plus====\n[[File:Punggol Discovery Cube.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The Punggol Discovery Cube is a visitor's centre for residents and visitors to learn about Punggol's history.]]\nIn his National Day Rally speech on 19 August 2007, Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] offered a new vision for Punggol New Town, and introduced the \"Punggol 21-plus\" plan to re-vitalise the town.<ref name=\"Peh Shing Huei\"/><ref name=\"Lynn Lee\">{{cite news | author = Lynn Lee| title = Punggol 21 reborn \u2013 and jazzed up as well| work = [[The Straits Times]] | date = 20 August 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"Lynn Lee 2\">{{cite news | author = Lynn Lee| title = Big plus for Punggol residents| work = [[The Straits Times]] | date = 20 August 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"Jasmine Yin\">{{cite news | author = Jasmine Yin| title = The whole country will be transformed| work = [[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]] | date = 20 August 2007| page=6}}</ref><ref name=\"Nazry Bahrawi\">{{cite news | author = Nazry Bahrawi| title = It's time to dream again...: Value of flats in Punggol will go up as area is developed| work = [[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]] | date = 21 August 2007| page=3}}</ref>\n\nUnder the new plan, [[Sungei Punggol]] and [[Sungei Serangoon]], which flank the town, will be dammed up to create a freshwater lake and serve as a [[Water reservoir|reservoir]]. A 4.2-kilometre long, 20-30-metre wide [[canal|man-made waterway]] will run through the estate, linking both rivers. Work on it will start in 2009, and had been completed on 26 October 2011. When built, there will be recreational facilities like water sports for [[kayaking]] and [[canoeing]], gardens and parks with [[jogging]] and cycling tracks, [[rooftop garden]]s, eateries for [[al fresco dining]] and a [[floating island]].<ref name=\"Peh Shing Huei\"/><ref name=\"Jessica Cheam\"/><ref name=\"Lynn Lee\"/><ref name=\"Jasmine Yin\"/><ref name=\"Tan Hui Yee\">{{cite news | author = Tan Hui Yee| title = Punggol perks | work = [[The Straits Times]] | date = 1 September 2007| page=H10}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Punggol 21-plus\" project involves 18,000 new HDB and private flats, and about 3,000 new flats will be built in Punggol New Town every year. Punggol New Town is projected to have 96,000 units when fully developed in the long term. Waterfront housing will have stepped courtyards. There will be a promenade on the northern sea front, stretching about 8.7&nbsp;km. An integrated waterfront commercial and residential development has also been planned at the town centre, which will be built on both banks of the waterway.

The town directly borders [[Sengkang]] to the south and shares riverine boundaries with the planning area of [[Seletar]] to the west and [[Pasir Ris]] to the east. Bounding the town to the north and north-east is the [[Straits of Johor]], with [[Coney Island, Punggol|Coney Island]] included as a part of the Punggol planning area.\n\nUnder the Punggol 21 initiative, plans to turn the area into a new residential town were announced in 1996 and development of the town started in 1998. Due to the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the financial troubles within the construction industry in 2003, the plan did not fully materialise. In 2007, a new initiative, the Punggol 21-plus plan, was introduced to redevelop the area into a waterfront town. Punggol is divided into 11 districts, namely, Coney Island, Matilda, Northshore District, Punggol Central District, Punggol Field East, Punggol Field West, Punggol Downtown District, Punggol Point District, Canal District, Crescent District and Waterway West District.<ref>{{cite news |title=HDB to launch BTO projects in Punggol inspired by early zoo, fishing village |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/hdb-to-launch-bto-projects-in-punggol-inspired-by-early-zoo-11861836 |accessdate=1 September 2019 |work=CNA |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nPunggol Point or Tanjong Punggol appears as Tanjong Rangon on Franklin and [[Philip Jackson (surveyor)|Jackson's]] 1828 map of Singapore. ''Punggol'', also spelled Ponggol, means \"hurling sticks at the branches of fruit trees to bring them down to the ground\" in [[Malay language|Malay]]. It could also refer to a place where fruits and forest produce are offered wholesale and carried away. These possible names indicate that Punggol was a fruit growing district. The place is said to take its name from the river [[Sungei Punggol|Sungei Ponggol]].\n\nPonggol also means \"a stump of a tree\", especially \"a high stump\". There are suggestions that the word is [[Tamil language|Tamil]] ([[Thai Pongal|Pongal]], \"the feast of the boiling rice\", is celebrated when the sun enters the sign of [[Capricornus|Capricorn]]). However, the word ''Ponggol'' or ''Punggol'' is definitely [[Malay language|Malay]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Pw7 soo teck.jpg|thumb|The [[Punggol LRT Line|Punggol West LRT]] is located in relatively undeveloped surroundings in 2006. As of 2015, one can no longer view the LRT Station directly from this point of view. The plain area with [[Matilda House]] shown here, has been developed into new HDB flats and condominiums.]]\n\nLocated in the vicinity of the Punggol Jetty, Punggol was believed to have existed 200 years ago before [[Sir Stamford Raffles]] founded Singapore. The Punggol area used to be a well-established rural district dotted with farmhouses and farm structures, which were serviced by roads and dirt tracks. It was one of the oldest settlements in Singapore. The original settlers were predominantly [[Malays in Singapore|Malays]]. The early Chinese immigrants, who settled in Punggol from the mid 19th century onwards, were engaged in plantation work, mainly rubber. As the population of the Chinese increased, many Chinese villagers were then engaged in poultry, pig or fish farming, as well as farm produce. The last pig farm closed down in 1990. [[Hydroponic]] non-pollutive vegetable farms and orchid farms used to flourish along the Cheng Lim Farmways and Buangkok Farmways, along with old [[kampung|kampong]]s and low-rise residential areas. Most of these farms have given way to the high-rise [[Housing and Development Board|HDB]] [[apartment|flats]] of [[Sengkang New Town]] and Punggol New Town.\n\nHistorically, Punggol was populated mostly by [[Teochew people|Teochews]] and [[Catholic]]s. However, the original settlers were predominantly [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]]. The end of Upper Serangoon Road is known to Teochews as ''kangkar'' or \"[[river bank]]\" or \"[[river mouth]]\". [[Ferries]] were used on the [[Sungei Serangoon|Serangoon River]] as transport. An old market was also located here. The Catholic [[missionaries]] arrived here 140 years ago and set up churches and schools. A Malay kampong, which has since been cleared, could also be found at Tanjong Punggol. At the end of Punggol Port Road, Indonesian and Malaysian fishermen auctioned their catch at the wholesale fish market.\n\n===World War II===\nDuring the [[Second World War]] in 1942, about 400 Chinese civilians were massacred by the Japanese military forces at [[Punggol Point]], the northern tip of the area, in what was to be known as the Punggol Beach Massacre as part of the [[Sook Ching massacre]] during the [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore]]. Today, that location has been marked as a national [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] site, and a war memorial now exists at the area.\n\n===Post-war Punggol===\nIn the 1960s, basic amenities like piped water, electricity, paved roads, and [[Sewage|drainage systems]] were introduced through government and self-help programmes. It was also at this time that television became popular and antennas could be seen installed on many kampong rooftops.\n\nPunggol was also known for its sumptuous seafood and boatels that provided services like docking and renting of boats for boating, [[water skiing]] and [[Scuba diving|skindiving]] lessons. These seafood restaurants and boatels have since been relocated in the mid-1990s to facilitate [[land reclamation]] works.<ref name=\"Mak Mun San\">Only two out of the four seafood eateries that operated at the old Punggol Point until 1995 are still around in Singapore: {{cite news | author = Mak Mun San| title = Punggol revisited | work = [[The Sunday Times (Singapore)|The Sunday Times]] | date = 26 August 2007}}</ref> Poultry and pig farms were also gradually phased out when redevelopment commenced in the 1970s. The last pig farm closed down in 1990. Land vacated by resettled farmers were then tendered out on short term leases for non-pollutive agricultural activities, which included hydroponic non-pollutive vegetable and orchid farms that used to flourish along the Cheng Lim Farmways and Buangkok Farmways. These farms existed along with old kampongs and low-rise residential areas. Most of these farms have given way to the high-rise HDB flats of Sengkang New Town and [[Punggol New Town]].\n\n===Today===\n\n====Punggol 21====\n[[File:Singapore punggol 001 2002.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Punggol in 2002, with the first phase of the Punggol 21 plan completed]]\nIn his [[National Day Rally]] speech on 18 August 1996, then-Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] announced the [[Singapore Government]]'s plan to develop Punggol, known as \"Punggol 21\". Punggol 21 was a new model for housing, which would feature a new concept in housing as a model for new towns in the 21st century. It would have a mix of private houses, executive condominiums,<ref>[https://www.the-piermontgrand-ec.com Piermont Grand Executive Condominium By CDL]</ref> and high-grade HDB flats grouped into smaller, distinctly designed estates. Each estate would contain between 1,200 and 2,800 units, with a common neighbourhood green. Every housing unit would be located within 300 metres of the nearest [[Light Rail Transit (Singapore)|LRT]] station. Schools, libraries, and [[community centre|community clubs]] would be clustered for convenience, and there would be three commercial centres, including shopping centres.<ref name=\"Warren Fernandez\">{{cite news | author = Warren Fernandez| title = PM Goh urges young to rally behind him | work = [[The Straits Times]] | date = 19 August 1996| page=1}}</ref><ref name=\"The Straits Times Aug 1996\">{{cite news | title = Punggol 21| work = [[The Straits Times]] | date = 19 August 1996| page=24}}</ref>\n\nA few months after the speech, Punggol 21, which was part of [[Cheng San Group Representation Constituency]] then, became an election [[Carrot and stick|carrot]] for the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) to beat a [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]] team led by [[J.B.

Although construction began the next year, it was stopped when demand for new flats fell sharply. Plans were again delayed when the construction industry in Singapore experienced financial troubles in 2003. As a result, only some 16,000 flats, out of the 80,000 planned units, have been built as at 2007. There was only one shopping mall in the estate, Punggol Plaza, and there were no recreational facilities like [[Cinema (place)|cinemas]] or swimming pools.<ref name=\"Peh Shing Huei\"/><ref name=\"Jessica Cheam\">{{cite news | author = Jessica Cheam| title = Residents look forward to 'Punggol 21-plus'| work = [[The Straits Times]] | date = 22 August 2007}}</ref> As of January 2016, a second shopping mall in the estate, [[Waterway Point]], has opened, and recreational facilities have since been planned within the estate.\n\n====Punggol 21-plus====\n[[File:Punggol Discovery Cube.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The Punggol Discovery Cube is a visitor's centre for residents and visitors to learn about Punggol's history.]]\nIn his National Day Rally speech on 19 August 2007, Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] offered a new vision for Punggol New Town, and introduced the \"Punggol 21-plus\" plan to re-vitalise the town.<ref name=\"Peh Shing Huei\"/><ref name=\"Lynn Lee\">{{cite news | author = Lynn Lee| title = Punggol 21 reborn \u2013 and jazzed up as well| work = [[The Straits Times]] | date = 20 August 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"Lynn Lee 2\">{{cite news | author = Lynn Lee| title = Big plus for Punggol residents| work = [[The Straits Times]] | date = 20 August 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"Jasmine Yin\">{{cite news | author = Jasmine Yin| title = The whole country will be transformed| work = [[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]] | date = 20 August 2007| page=6}}</ref><ref name=\"Nazry Bahrawi\">{{cite news | author = Nazry Bahrawi| title = It's time to dream again...: Value of flats in Punggol will go up as area is developed| work = [[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]] | date = 21 August 2007| page=3}}</ref>\n\nUnder the new plan, [[Sungei Punggol]] and [[Sungei Serangoon]], which flank the town, will be dammed up to create a freshwater lake and serve as a [[Water reservoir|reservoir]].

Punggol New Town is projected to have 96,000 units when fully developed in the long term. Waterfront housing will have stepped courtyards. There will be a promenade on the northern sea front, stretching about 8.7&nbsp;km.
