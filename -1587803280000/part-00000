It is one of the so-called fantastical (''aventiurehaft'') Dietrich poems, so called because it more closely resembles a [[courtly romance]] than a [[heroic epic]]. The poem was composed by 1300 at the latest, and may have been composed as early as the second quarter of the thirteenth century.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=127}}\n\nThere are three principle versions of the ''Virginal''. The poem concerns the still young and inexperienced Dietrich's quest to save the [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] queen Virginal in [[Tyrol]] from a force of attacking heathens. After defeating the heathens, Dietrich encounters a series of further adventures while trying to reach Virginal's court, including, depending on version, his capture by giants and his rescue of the hero Rentwin out of the mouth of a dragon. When he finally reaches Virginal's court, Dietrich marries Virginal in two of the three versions.\n\n==Summary==\n[[File:Dietrich und Hildebrand kaempfen gegen Drachen.jpg|thumb|Dietrich von Bern and Hildebrand fight against dragons. UBH Cod.Pal.germ. 324 Virginal, fol. 43r]]\nThere are three complete versions of the ''Virginal'', the Heidelberg, the Vienna, and the Dresden versions.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=137}} Here follows a summary of each version.\n\n'''Heidelberg Version (V<sub>10</sub>)''': Young Dietrich does not yet know what adventure (Middle High German \"''\u00e2ventiure''\") means, so Hildebrand takes him into the wooded mountains of Tyrol to fight against the heathen Orkise, who has invaded the kingdom of the dwarf king Virginal and demands a virgin as tribute to eat. Hildebrand finds a girl who is being sacrificed to Orkise, and slays a group of heathens who have come to collect her. Hildebrand returns to Dietrich, only to discover that his pupil is himself under attack\u2014with Hildebrand's help, Dietrich defeats the heathens. The girl invites Dietrich and Hildebrand to Virginal's palace at Jeraspunt, heading there herself as messenger to announce the heroes. Virginal sends the dwarf Bibung as a messenger to Dietrich and Hildebrand. When Bibung finds the heroes, they are in the midst of fighting a swarm of dragons. Hildebrand rescues a knight who has been half-swallowed by a dragon. The knight is named Rentwin, son of Helferich von Lune und der Portalaphe, and thus great nephew of Hildebrand. He invites his rescuers to his father's castle at [[Arona, Piedmont|Arona]]. Bibung also goes to the castle, bringing Virginal's invitation. Dietrich rides alone ahead when the heroes head to Virginal's palace, and gets lost, arriving at the castle Muter. There the giant Wicram, together with other giants, overpowers him and takes him captive on behalf of his master, Nitger. Meanwhile, the other heroes arrive at Jeraspunt and notice that Dietrich is missing. In Muter, Nitger's sister Ibelin takes care of Dietrich, and with her help he is able to send a message to his friends telling them of his predicament. Hildebrand and Helferich decide to gather a force to free Dietrich, calling for the aid King Imian of [[Hungary]], [[Witege]], [[Heime]], and Biterolf and Dietleib. The heroes go to Muter and arrange combat with Nitger. There are eleven cases of single combat, with Nitger even allowing Dietrich himself to fight, and all the giants are slain. The heroes head back to Jeraspunt, on the way slaying even more dragons and giants. Finally, there is an enormous feast at Virginal's palace. However, Dietrich receives news of a threatened siege of Bern ([[Verona]], so Dietrich must hurry back home to further hardships.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=137-138}}\n\n'''Dresden Virginal (V<sub>11</sub>)''': The Dresden version has been radically reduced in length by the scribe of the Dresdner Heldenbuch. This version does not contain the episode of Dietrich's capture at Muter. During Dietrich's stay at Arona, further adventures are told: Dietrich is challenged by Prince Libertin of [[Palermo]], defeats him, and becomes his friend. Hildebrand, Helferich, Rentwin, and Libertin are invited to the castle Orteneck by the heathen Janapas, Orkise's son, while they were heading to Jeraspunt. The heathen ambushes them there, and the heroes must fight against lions and heathens. Their victory frees three maidens who the heathens had taken from Virginal. Dietrich, meanwhile, fights a ferocious boar and then a giant, who objects to Dietrich hunting on his land, while all this is happening. Dietrich defeats the giant as his friends arrive and see, taking the giant captive. The heroes finally arrive at Jeraspunt, where Dietrich marries Virginal. For two nights he is unable to consummate his union, while Hildebrand hides under the bed and counsels the young warrior. On the third night, he is successful.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=138-139}}\n\n'''Vienna Virginal (V<sub>12</sub>)''': A much longer version of the events also contained in the Dresden version, but without detail that Dietrich was at first unable to consummate his marriage. It also contains the Muter episode.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=139}}\n\n==Transmissions, Versions, and Dating==\nThe ''Virginal'' must have been composed prior by 1300 at the latest, based on the dating of the earliest fragments. Because of the oldest fragments of the poem come from the Swabian-Alemannic area, the poem is thought to have been composed there.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=139}} Like almost all German heroic poetry, the ''Virginal'' is anonymous.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1974|pp=11-12}}\n\nThe three complete manuscripts, the Heidelberg V<sub>10</sub>, Dresden V<sub>11</sub>, and Vienna V<sub>12</sub> versions, each contains an independent version of the poem. Most of the fragments match the Heidelberg version most closely, but due to the extreme variability of the fantastical Dietrich epic, each individual manuscript can be considered an equally valid version.{{sfn|Heinzle|1997|p=137}}\n\nThe ''Virginal'' has the following manuscript attestations:\n\n*V<sub>1</sub> (U): University College London, Ms. Frag.

Fragment of a parchment manuscript, first half of the fourteenth century, Bavarian dialect.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=137}}\n\n==Interpretation==\nOlder scholarship believed that the ''Virginal'' consisted of three originally separate parts: Dietrich's fight against Orkise, his rescue of Rentwin, and his captivity at Muter.{{sfn|Haymes|Samples|1996|p=83}} Considerable efforts were spent trying to discern when these three stories came to be attached to the poem, with the fight against Orkise generally being supposed to have been written first, with the Rentwin and the Muter episodes added later based on stories in oral circulation.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1974|pp=204-207}} Joachim Heinzle dismisses such attempts to differentiate separate layers of the poem over time as setting an impossible task.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=139}}\n\nMore recent scholarship has focused on the ''Virginal's'' portrayal of Dietrich's learning the meaning of adventure: Victor Millet notes that the various episodes introduce Dietrich to almost all possible kinds of battles.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=340}} The characterization of Dietrich as still inexperienced and young makes the poem into a sort of pedagogical exercise.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=129}} The discussion of adventure (Middle High German ''\u00e2ventiure'') is, moreover, a [[metaliterature|metaliterary]] discussion, with Dietrich's adventures in the story being inspired by his inability to narrative adventures.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=340}} The Heidelberg version accentuates this theme by filling the poem with letters and oral messages that retell elements of the story to characters absent at the time of those events.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=130}}\n\nThe poem also shows Dietrich's continued resistance to courtly [[love service]] and [[chivalry]] in the service of ladies, topics also found in the ''[[Goldemar]]'' fragment and the ''[[Eckenlied]]''.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=341-342}} While the Vienna and Dresden versions end with Dietrich marrying Virginal, in the Heidelberg version he successfully resists the narrative expectation that he ought to marry Virginal after rescuing her. The poem emphasizes the fellowship of the heroic warriors, particularly between Dietrich and Hildebrand, as the heroes join forces to defeat adversaries such as Orkise or the giants at Muter. The defeat of giants and heathens, moreover, appears to be a duty for Dietrich as a ruler.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=129}}\n\nThe Heidelberg version shows a tendency toward realism, particularly when Dietrich must abruptly leave Virginal to save his kingdom from an unnamed threat. He is thus taken back out of the world of fantastical adventure to the world of real concerns such as war.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=130}}\n\n==Metrical Form==\nLike the majority of German [[heroic epic]]s, the ''Virginal'' is written in stanzas.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1974|p=17}} The poem is composed in a stranzaic form known as the \"Berner Ton,\" which consists of 13 lines in the following rhyme scheme: '''aabccbdedefxf'''. It shares this metrical form with the poems ''[[Goldemar]]'', ''[[Sigenot]]'', and ''[[Eckenlied]]''.  Early modern melodies for the \"Berner Ton\" have survived, indicating that it was meant to be sung.{{snf|Heinzle|1999|pp=102-103}} The following stanza of the ''Eckenlied'' can stand in as a typical example:{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=100}}\n\n:Ez s\u00e2zen helde in eime sal, '''a''' (four feet)\n:s\u00ee retten wunder \u00e2ne zal '''a''' (four feet)\n:von \u00fbz erwelten recken.

'''f''' (four feet)\n:s\u00f4 waer mit listen k\u00fcene '''x''' (three feet)\n:der alte Hiltebrant. '''f''' (three feet)\n\n==Relation to the Oral Tradition==\n[[File:Andlau Abbatiale085.JPG|thumb|Exterior Sculpture of \u00c9glise Saints-Pierre-et-Paul dite Sainte-Richarde in Andlau, Alsace, possibly inspired by the scene of Hildebrand saving Rentwin recorded in ''Virginal'']]\n[[File:Visconti znak.jpg|thumb|Coat of arms of the Visconti of Milan depicting the [[biscione]], a serpent who appears to be swallowing a human]]\nDietrich's captivity among giants is an extremely old part of the oral tradition surrounding him, being referenced in the [[Old English]] ''[[Waldere]]'', where Witege saves him. In the ''Virginal'', Witege is still involved in the rescue, though he plays no special role.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=140-141}}{{sfn|Hoffmann|1974|p=207}} Another version of Dietrich's captivity by giants is found in the ''[[Sigenot]]''. The giant Wicram, in taking Dietrich captive, references Dietrich having killed his kinsmen in ''Britanje'': this may be a reference to Dietrich's adventures in Bertangenland recounted in the [[Thidrekssaga]]. Its presence here conrtadicts the claim made at the beginning of the ''Virginal'' that this is Dietrich's first adventure.{{sfn|Kerth|2008|pp=173-174}}{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=340}}\n\nThe tale connecting Dietrich to the rescue a man half-swallowed by a serpant or dragon appears to be part of a wide-spread oral tradition about Dietrich. This image first occurs on an exterior frieze at the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] abbey of [[Andlau]] (c. 1130/40?) and on the capital of a column in the cathedral of [[Basel]] (after 1185): this could be a depiction of this story about Dietrich, but might also be a general depiction of good vanquishing evil.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=141-142}} Lienert  dismisses these sculptural depictions as unrelated to Dietrich.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=130}} Another version of the same story is also found in the [[Thidrekssaga]]: there Dietrich and [[Eckenlied|Fasolt]] come across the knight Sintram, Hilderband's nephew, in the mouth of a dragon. Fasolt rescues the Sintram with the use of a sword stuck in the dragon's mouth.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=140-141}} Sintram also appears as the name of the man being swallowed by the dragon also in a 15th-century Swiss chronicle, by the Bernese Chronicle of [[Konrad Justinger]], which relocates the action to [[Bern, Switzerland]], and does not include Dietrich's name. It is thus not clear if the motif was transferred onto Dietrich from an independent legend or whether the Swiss version had lost the original connection with Dietrich.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=140-141}} In the ''Virginal'', the presence of this story may be connected to the coat of arms of the [[House of Visconti (Milan)|Visconti]], which depicts a man being swallowed by a dragon. The Visconti were in possession of the case of [[Arona (NO)|Arona]] (''Arone'') at the time of the ''Virginal's'' composition, and this is the castle where Rentwin and his father Helferich live.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1974|p=206}} However, this coat of arms is only attested for the Visconti beginning in the fourteenth century.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=142}} Heinzle dismisses attempts to connect the image to similar stories about [[Sinbad the Sailor]].{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=142}}\n\n19th century scholarship attempted to connect Orkise with [[Ork (folklore)|Ork]], a demon of Tyrolian and North Italian folklore.{{sfn|Gillespie|1973|p=100}} Joachim Heinzle largely dismisses such speculations, instead preferring to point to the ''Virginal's'' use of the motif of a man hunting woman, something also found in Dietrich's opponents the ''[[Wunderer]]'' and ''[[Eckenlied]]'', as well as in certain legends about Dietrich himself.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=140}}\n\nAlthough queen Virginal's name strongly resembles the romance word \"virgin\", it may in fact be connected with [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''fairguni'', meaning mountain.{{sfn|Gillespie|1973|p=45}} Compare also [[Anglo-Saxon]] ''firgen'', meaning mountain woodland.{{sfn|Gillespie|1973|p=45}}\n\nThe poem also has at least one peculiarity: the king of the Hungarians, whom medieval tradition associated with the [[Huns]], is named Imian, not [[Attila|Etzel]]. This may have been an effort to distance the poem from criticisms that Etzel (Attila) and Dietrich (Theoderic the Great) were not contemporaries.{{sfn|Kerth|2008|p=166-167}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Editions==\n*{{cite book|editor-last1=Lienert|editor-first1=Elisabeth|editor-last2=Pontini|editor-first2=Elisa|editor-last3=Schumacher|editor-first3=Katrin |title=Virginal.

It is one of the so-called fantastical (''aventiurehaft'') Dietrich poems, so called because it more closely resembles a [[courtly romance]] than a [[heroic epic]]. The poem was composed by 1300 at the latest, and may have been composed as early as the second quarter of the thirteenth century.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=127}}\n\nThere are three principle versions of the ''Virginal''. The poem concerns the still young and inexperienced Dietrich's quest to save the [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] queen Virginal in [[Tyrol]] from a force of attacking heathens. After defeating the heathens, Dietrich encounters a series of further adventures while trying to reach Virginal's court, including, depending on version, his capture by giants and his rescue of the hero Rentwin out of the mouth of a dragon.

Hildebrand finds a girl who is being sacrificed to Orkise, and slays a group of heathens who have come to collect her. Hildebrand returns to Dietrich, only to discover that his pupil is himself under attack\u2014with Hildebrand's help, Dietrich defeats the heathens. The girl invites Dietrich and Hildebrand to Virginal's palace at Jeraspunt, heading there herself as messenger to announce the heroes. Virginal sends the dwarf Bibung as a messenger to Dietrich and Hildebrand. When Bibung finds the heroes, they are in the midst of fighting a swarm of dragons. Hildebrand rescues a knight who has been half-swallowed by a dragon. The knight is named Rentwin, son of Helferich von Lune und der Portalaphe, and thus great nephew of Hildebrand. He invites his rescuers to his father's castle at [[Arona, Piedmont|Arona]]. Bibung also goes to the castle, bringing Virginal's invitation. Dietrich rides alone ahead when the heroes head to Virginal's palace, and gets lost, arriving at the castle Muter. There the giant Wicram, together with other giants, overpowers him and takes him captive on behalf of his master, Nitger. Meanwhile, the other heroes arrive at Jeraspunt and notice that Dietrich is missing. In Muter, Nitger's sister Ibelin takes care of Dietrich, and with her help he is able to send a message to his friends telling them of his predicament. Hildebrand and Helferich decide to gather a force to free Dietrich, calling for the aid King Imian of [[Hungary]], [[Witege]], [[Heime]], and Biterolf and Dietleib. The heroes go to Muter and arrange combat with Nitger. There are eleven cases of single combat, with Nitger even allowing Dietrich himself to fight, and all the giants are slain. The heroes head back to Jeraspunt, on the way slaying even more dragons and giants. Finally, there is an enormous feast at Virginal's palace. However, Dietrich receives news of a threatened siege of Bern ([[Verona]], so Dietrich must hurry back home to further hardships.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=137-138}}\n\n'''Dresden Virginal (V<sub>11</sub>)''': The Dresden version has been radically reduced in length by the scribe of the Dresdner Heldenbuch. This version does not contain the episode of Dietrich's capture at Muter. During Dietrich's stay at Arona, further adventures are told: Dietrich is challenged by Prince Libertin of [[Palermo]], defeats him, and becomes his friend. Hildebrand, Helferich, Rentwin, and Libertin are invited to the castle Orteneck by the heathen Janapas, Orkise's son, while they were heading to Jeraspunt. The heathen ambushes them there, and the heroes must fight against lions and heathens. Their victory frees three maidens who the heathens had taken from Virginal. Dietrich, meanwhile, fights a ferocious boar and then a giant, who objects to Dietrich hunting on his land, while all this is happening. Dietrich defeats the giant as his friends arrive and see, taking the giant captive. The heroes finally arrive at Jeraspunt, where Dietrich marries Virginal. For two nights he is unable to consummate his union, while Hildebrand hides under the bed and counsels the young warrior. On the third night, he is successful.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=138-139}}\n\n'''Vienna Virginal (V<sub>12</sub>)''': A much longer version of the events also contained in the Dresden version, but without detail that Dietrich was at first unable to consummate his marriage.

Fragment of a parchment manuscript, first half of the fourteenth century, Bavarian dialect.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=137}}\n\n==Interpretation==\nOlder scholarship believed that the ''Virginal'' consisted of three originally separate parts: Dietrich's fight against Orkise, his rescue of Rentwin, and his captivity at Muter.{{sfn|Haymes|Samples|1996|p=83}} Considerable efforts were spent trying to discern when these three stories came to be attached to the poem, with the fight against Orkise generally being supposed to have been written first, with the Rentwin and the Muter episodes added later based on stories in oral circulation.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1974|pp=204-207}} Joachim Heinzle dismisses such attempts to differentiate separate layers of the poem over time as setting an impossible task.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=139}}\n\nMore recent scholarship has focused on the ''Virginal's'' portrayal of Dietrich's learning the meaning of adventure: Victor Millet notes that the various episodes introduce Dietrich to almost all possible kinds of battles.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=340}} The characterization of Dietrich as still inexperienced and young makes the poem into a sort of pedagogical exercise.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=129}} The discussion of adventure (Middle High German ''\u00e2ventiure'') is, moreover, a [[metaliterature|metaliterary]] discussion, with Dietrich's adventures in the story being inspired by his inability to narrative adventures.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=340}} The Heidelberg version accentuates this theme by filling the poem with letters and oral messages that retell elements of the story to characters absent at the time of those events.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=130}}\n\nThe poem also shows Dietrich's continued resistance to courtly [[love service]] and [[chivalry]] in the service of ladies, topics also found in the ''[[Goldemar]]'' fragment and the ''[[Eckenlied]]''.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=341-342}} While the Vienna and Dresden versions end with Dietrich marrying Virginal, in the Heidelberg version he successfully resists the narrative expectation that he ought to marry Virginal after rescuing her. The poem emphasizes the fellowship of the heroic warriors, particularly between Dietrich and Hildebrand, as the heroes join forces to defeat adversaries such as Orkise or the giants at Muter. The defeat of giants and heathens, moreover, appears to be a duty for Dietrich as a ruler.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=129}}\n\nThe Heidelberg version shows a tendency toward realism, particularly when Dietrich must abruptly leave Virginal to save his kingdom from an unnamed threat. He is thus taken back out of the world of fantastical adventure to the world of real concerns such as war.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=130}}\n\n==Metrical Form==\nLike the majority of German [[heroic epic|heroic epics]], the ''Virginal'' is written in stanzas.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1974|p=17}} The poem is composed in a stranzaic form known as the \"Berner Ton,\" which consists of 13 lines in the following rhyme scheme: '''aabccbdedefxf'''. It shares this metrical form with the poems ''[[Goldemar]]'', ''[[Sigenot]]'', and ''[[Eckenlied]]''.  Early modern melodies for the \"Berner Ton\" have survived, indicating that it was meant to be sung.{{snf|Heinzle|1999|pp=102-103}} The following stanza of the ''Eckenlied'' can stand in as a typical example:{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=100}}\n\n:Ez s\u00e2zen helde in eime sal, '''a''' (four feet)\n:s\u00ee retten wunder \u00e2ne zal '''a''' (four feet)\n:von \u00fbz erwelten recken. '''b''' (three feet)\n:der eine was sich her V\u00e2solt '''c''' (four feet)\n:(dem w\u00e2ren schoene vrouwen holt), '''c''' (four feet)\n:daz ander was her Ecke, '''b''' (three feet)\n:daz dritte der wild Ebenr\u00f4t. '''d''' (four feet)\n:s\u00ee retten al gel\u00eeche '''e''' (three feet)\n:daz nieman k\u00fcener waer ze n\u00f4t, '''d''' (four feet)\n:den von Berne her Dieter\u00eeche: '''e''' (three feet)\n:der waer ein helt \u00fcbr alliu lant. '''f''' (four feet)\n:s\u00f4 waer mit listen k\u00fcene '''x''' (three feet)\n:der alte Hiltebrant. '''f''' (three feet)\n\n==Relation to the Oral Tradition==\n[[File:Andlau Abbatiale085.JPG|thumb|Exterior Sculpture of \u00c9glise Saints-Pierre-et-Paul dite Sainte-Richarde in Andlau, Alsace, possibly inspired by the scene of Hildebrand saving Rentwin recorded in ''Virginal'']]\n[[File:Visconti znak.jpg|thumb|Coat of arms of the Visconti of Milan depicting the [[biscione]], a serpent who appears to be swallowing a human]]\nDietrich's captivity among giants is an extremely old part of the oral tradition surrounding him, being referenced in the [[Old English]] ''[[Waldere]]'', where Witege saves him. In the ''Virginal'', Witege is still involved in the rescue, though he plays no special role.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=140-141}}{{sfn|Hoffmann|1974|p=207}} Another version of Dietrich's captivity by giants is found in the ''[[Sigenot]]''. The giant Wicram, in taking Dietrich captive, references Dietrich having killed his kinsmen in ''Britanje'': this may be a reference to Dietrich's adventures in Bertangenland recounted in the [[Thidrekssaga]]. Its presence here conrtadicts the claim made at the beginning of the ''Virginal'' that this is Dietrich's first adventure.{{sfn|Kerth|2008|pp=173-174}}{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=340}}\n\nThe tale connecting Dietrich to the rescue a man half-swallowed by a serpant or dragon appears to be part of a wide-spread oral tradition about Dietrich. This image first occurs on an exterior frieze at the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] abbey of [[Andlau]] (c. 1130/40?) and on the capital of a column in the cathedral of [[Basel]] (after 1185): this could be a depiction of this story about Dietrich, but might also be a general depiction of good vanquishing evil.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=141-142}} Lienert  dismisses these sculptural depictions as unrelated to Dietrich.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=130}} Another version of the same story is also found in the [[Thidrekssaga]]: there Dietrich and [[Eckenlied|Fasolt]] come across the knight Sintram, Hilderband's nephew, in the mouth of a dragon. Fasolt rescues the Sintram with the use of a sword stuck in the dragon's mouth.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=140-141}} Sintram also appears as the name of the man being swallowed by the dragon also in a 15th-century Swiss chronicle, by the Bernese Chronicle of [[Konrad Justinger]], which relocates the action to [[Bern, Switzerland]], and does not include Dietrich's name. It is thus not clear if the motif was transferred onto Dietrich from an independent legend or whether the Swiss version had lost the original connection with Dietrich.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=140-141}} In the ''Virginal'', the presence of this story may be connected to the coat of arms of the [[House of Visconti (Milan)|Visconti]], which depicts a man being swallowed by a dragon. The Visconti were in possession of the case of [[Arona (NO)|Arona]] (''Arone'') at the time of the ''Virginal's'' composition, and this is the castle where Rentwin and his father Helferich live.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1974|p=206}} However, this coat of arms is only attested for the Visconti beginning in the fourteenth century.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=142}} Heinzle dismisses attempts to connect the image to similar stories about [[Sinbad the Sailor]].{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=142}}\n\n19th century scholarship attempted to connect Orkise with [[Ork (folklore)|Ork]], a demon of Tyrolian and North Italian folklore.{{sfn|Gillespie|1973|p=100}} Joachim Heinzle largely dismisses such speculations, instead preferring to point to the ''Virginal's'' use of the motif of a man hunting woman, something also found in Dietrich's opponents the ''[[Wunderer]]'' and ''[[Eckenlied]]'', as well as in certain legends about Dietrich himself.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=140}}\n\nAlthough queen Virginal's name strongly resembles the romance word \"virgin\", it may in fact be connected with [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''fairguni'', meaning mountain.{{sfn|Gillespie|1973|p=45}} Compare also [[Anglo-Saxon]] ''firgen'', meaning mountain woodland.{{sfn|Gillespie|1973|p=45}}\n\nThe poem also has at least one peculiarity: the king of the Hungarians, whom medieval tradition associated with the [[Huns]], is named Imian, not [[Attila|Etzel]]. This may have been an effort to distance the poem from criticisms that Etzel (Attila) and Dietrich (Theoderic the Great) were not contemporaries.{{sfn|Kerth|2008|p=166-167}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Editions==\n*{{cite book|editor-last1=Lienert|editor-first1=Elisabeth|editor-last2=Pontini|editor-first2=Elisa|editor-last3=Schumacher|editor-first3=Katrin |title=Virginal.

to three-year-old [[thoroughbred]] [[Colt (horse)|colts]] and [[Filly|fillies]]. It is run at [[Longchamp Racecourse|Longchamp]] over a distance of 2,400 metres (about 1\u00bd miles), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September.\n\nThe race serves as a trial for the [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]], which is held at the same venue three weeks later.\n\n==History==\nA precursor of the race called the Prix de Chantilly was formerly staged at [[Chantilly Racecourse|Chantilly]] in early September. It was open to horses aged three or older, and for a period its distance was 3,100 metres. It was subsequently transferred to Longchamp and run over 3,000 metres. It was shortened to 2,400 metres in 1952, and reduced to 2,300 metres in 1953.\n\nThe Prix de Chantilly was restricted to three-year-olds when a separate event was introduced for older horses in 1955. The new race was initially titled the [[Prix Foy|Prix Henri Foy]], and from this point the Prix de Chantilly was contested over 2,400 metres.\n\nThe race was cut to 2,000 metres in 1960, and restored to 2,400 metres the following year. It was switched to Chantilly in 1964, and returned to Longchamp with a length of 2,100 metres in 1966. It was extended to 2,200 metres in 1968.\n\nThe event was renamed in memory of Gaston Niel (1880\u20131970), a long-serving member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Encouragement, in 1972. For several years the Prix Niel held Group 3 status. It was increased to 2,400 metres in 1979, and promoted to Group 2 level in 1987.\n\nThe Prix Niel became part of the [[Breeders' Cup Challenge]] series in 2010, with the winner earning an automatic invitation to compete in the [[Breeders' Cup Turf]]. It was removed from the series in 2012.\n\nTwelve winners of the race have achieved victory in the same year's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. The first was Sica Boy in 1954, and the most recent [[Rail Link (horse)|Rail Link]] in 2006.\n\nPrix Niel is eligible for geldings from 2020.<ref>[https://www.racing.com/news/2019-07-09/news-geldings-green-light-in-french-group-races Geldings' green light in French Group races]</ref> Due to [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on sports|the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]], 2020 Prix Niel are not run, and are replaced by the [[Grand Prix de Paris]].<ref>[https://www.racingpost.com/news/international/french-racing-to-start-with-four-group-races-as-revised-schedule-released/432288 French racing to restart with four Group races and Monday slot for the Guineas]</ref>\n\n==Records==\n<div style=\"font-size:90%\">\n'''Leading [[jockey]] since 1952 (4 wins):'''\n* [[Yves Saint-Martin]] \u2013 ''Nelcius (1966), Akarad (1981), Sagace (1983), Mouktar (1985)''\n* [[Freddy Head]] \u2013 ''Taj Dewan (1967), {{sic|hide=y|Mississipian}} (1974), Gay Mecene (1978), Cariellor (1984)''\n\n'''Leading [[Horse trainer|trainer]] since 1952 (11 wins):'''\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Fabre]] \u2013 ''Cariellor (1984), Trempolino (1987), Subotica (1991), Carnegie (1994), Housamix (1995), Sagamix (1998), Valixir (2004), Hurricane Run (2005), Rail Link (2006), Cavalryman (2009), New Bay (2015)''\n\n'''Leading owner since 1952 (5 wins):'''\n* [[Aga Khan IV|HH Aga Khan IV]] \u2013 ''Akarad (1981), Mouktar (1985), Sinndar (2000), Dalakhani (2003), Behkabad (2010)''\n</div>\n\n==Winners since 1978==\n{| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\"\n!

to three-year-old [[thoroughbred]] [[Colt (horse)|colts]] and [[Filly|fillies]]. It is run at [[Longchamp Racecourse|Longchamp]] over a distance of 2,400 metres (about 1\u00bd miles), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September.\n\nThe race serves as a trial for the [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]], which is held at the same venue three weeks later.\n\n==History==\nA precursor of the race called the Prix de Chantilly was formerly staged at [[Chantilly Racecourse|Chantilly]] in early September. It was open to horses aged three or older, and for a period its distance was 3,100 metres. It was subsequently transferred to Longchamp and run over 3,000 metres. It was shortened to 2,400 metres in 1952, and reduced to 2,300 metres in 1953.\n\nThe Prix de Chantilly was restricted to three-year-olds when a separate event was introduced for older horses in 1955. The new race was initially titled the [[Prix Foy|Prix Henri Foy]], and from this point the Prix de Chantilly was contested over 2,400 metres.\n\nThe race was cut to 2,000 metres in 1960, and restored to 2,400 metres the following year. It was switched to Chantilly in 1964, and returned to Longchamp with a length of 2,100 metres in 1966. It was extended to 2,200 metres in 1968.\n\nThe event was renamed in memory of Gaston Niel (1880\u20131970), a long-serving member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Encouragement, in 1972. For several years the Prix Niel held Group 3 status. It was increased to 2,400 metres in 1979, and promoted to Group 2 level in 1987.\n\nThe Prix Niel became part of the [[Breeders' Cup Challenge]] series in 2010, with the winner earning an automatic invitation to compete in the [[Breeders' Cup Turf]]. It was removed from the series in 2012.\n\nTwelve winners of the race have achieved victory in the same year's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. The first was Sica Boy in 1954, and the most recent [[Rail Link (horse)|Rail Link]] in 2006.\n\nPrix Niel is eligible for geldings from 2020.<ref>[https://www.racing.com/news/2019-07-09/news-geldings-green-light-in-french-group-races Geldings' green light in French Group races]</ref>.

Previously, the nameplate [[Nash Ambassador|Ambassador]] applied to [[Nash Motors|Nash's]] full-size cars. The nameplate referred to a trim level between 1927 and 1931.\n\nAmbassadors were manufactured in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] as well as at AMC's [[Brampton Assembly]] in Brampton, Ontario from 1963 to 1966. [[Australian Motor Industries]] (AMI) assembled Ambassadors from [[knock-down kit]]s with [[right-hand drive]] from 1961 to 1963. The U.S. fifth generation Ambassadors were manufactured by [[Industrias Kaiser Argentina]] (IKA) in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina]] from 1965 to 1972, as well as assembled by ECASA in [[Costa Rica]] from 1965 to 1970. Planta REO assembled first-generation Ambassadors in Mexico at its Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n plant. Fifth and seventh generation Ambassadors were modified into custom stretch [[limousine]]s in Argentina and the U.S.\n\n== Development ==\nFollowing [[George W. Mason]]'s unexpected death in the fall of 1954, [[George W. Romney|George Romney]] (whom Mason had been grooming as his eventual successor), succeeded him as president and CEO of the newly formed American Motors. Romney recognized that to be successful in the postwar marketplace, an automobile manufacturer would have to be able to produce and sell cars in sufficient volume to [[Amortization (business)|amortize]] the high cost of tooling. Toward that end, he set out to increase AMC's market share with its Rambler models that were selling in [[market segment]] in which the domestic Big Three ([[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company]], and [[Chrysler]]) automakers did not yet compete. While development of a redesigned 1958 Nash Ambassador, based on a stretched and reskinned 1956 Rambler [[Coachwork|body]] was almost complete, AMC's [[Automotive design|designers]] were also working on a retrimmed [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]] equivalent, called '''Rebel''', to offer Hudson [[Car dealership|dealers]].\n\nHowever, as sales of the large-sized [[Nash Ambassador]] and [[Hudson Hornet]] models slowed, it became clear to Romney that consumer confidence in the historic Nash and Hudson nameplates had collapsed. Reluctantly, he decided that 1957 would be the end of both nameplates, and the company would concentrate on the new Rambler line, which was registered as a separate [[marque]] for 1957.\n\nThe market positioning meant that \"the AMC Ambassador was a car with no real competitors throughout most of the sixties\" because it was viewed as a luxury-type car and could be put against the higher end large-sized models from the domestic Big Three automakers, but the Ambassador was more of a midsized car.<ref>{{cite book |last=Flory, Jr. |first=J. \u201cKelly\u201d |title=American Cars, 1973-1980: Every Model, Year by Year |date=2012 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786456369 |page=2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1DiNAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=the+AMC+Ambassador+was+a+car+with+no+real+competitors+throughout+most+of+the+sixtie |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n== First generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image        = Rambler Ambassador (3893707660).jpg\n| caption      = 1958 Ambassador V8, Custom sedan\n| model_years  = 1958\u20131959\n| aka          = Ambassador V8 by Rambler\n| name         = First generation\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] station wagon }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|117|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| engine       = {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]]\n}}\n\n=== 1958 ===\n[[File:1958 Ambassador 4-d hardtop.jpg|thumb|right|1958 Ambassador Custom hardtop sedan with [[continental tire]] ]]\n[[File:1958 Ambassador 4-d hardtop wagon 2.JPG|thumb|right|Ambassador hardtop (pillarless) Cross Country station wagon]]\n\nAmerican Motors planned to produce a stretched a {{convert|117|in|0|adj=on}} [[wheelbase]] version of the Rambler platform for Nash dealers to be the new Nash Ambassador, and another for Hudson dealers. Shortly before committing to production of the new long-wheelbase versions of the Hudson and the Nash, CEO Romney decided to abandon the Nash and Hudson marques.\n\nDespite the fact that the Nash and Hudson names were canceled, work on the car itself continued, and American Motors introduced debuted in the fall of 1957, the 1958 \"Ambassador V-8 by Rambler\" on a {{convert|117|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase. Its features included a {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]] (equipped with a 4-barrel [[carburetor]] and dual exhausts and rated at {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|360|lb\u00b7ft|N\u00b7m}} of torque) mated to a [[BorgWarner]] supplied 3-speed [[automatic transmission]] with push button gear selection.\n\nIn 1956, AMC first produced its own V8, a modern overhead valve V8 displacing {{convert|250|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, with a forged steel crank shaft, which when equipped with a 4-barrel carburetor was rated at {{convert|215|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. In 1957, AMC bored and stroked the 250 CID V8 to {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} displacement which when offered in the [[Rambler Rebel]] used solid lifters and Bendix electronic fuel injection was rated at {{convert|288|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 1958, the Ambassador was equipped with a hydraulic lifter version of AMC's 327 CID V8 rated at {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. Although AMC's 327 CID V8 shares its displacement with the Chevrolet small-block, AMC's 327 came out six years before Chevrolet first offered its 327 in 1962.\n\nThe Ambassador was available in a body style exclusive to its line, a pillarless [[hardtop]] '''Cross Country''' [[station wagon]]. The 1958 Ambassador was offered in a single high level trim level and came equipped with such luxury items as electric clock, twin front and rear ashtrays, Nash tradition \"deep coil\" spring suspension front and rear, split back reclining front seats that fold down into a bed, as well as upscale fabrics for the interior.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-24-25 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816085955/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-24-25 |archivedate=August 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nManagement had found that the public associated the Rambler name with small economy cars, and did not want the upscale nature of the new Ambassador to be so closely associated with Rambler's favorable, but economical image. Therefore, a decision was made that the larger Ambassador would be marketed as the '''Ambassador V-8 by Rambler''' in order to identify it with the Rambler name's burgeoning success, but to indicate an air of exclusivity by showing it to be a different kind of vehicle. However, the car wore \"Rambler Ambassador\" badges on its front fenders.\n\nThe 1958 Ambassador is a substantially longer car than the {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase [[Rambler Six]] and [[Rambler Rebel|Rebel V8]], although both lines shared the same basic body, styling, and visual cues. However, all of the Ambassador's extra {{convert|9|in|mm|spell=in}} of wheelbase (and, therefore, overall length) were added ahead of the cowl, meaning that the passenger compartment had the same volume as the smaller Ramblers. The Ambassadors came with plusher interior and exterior trims while the front end incorporated the Rebel \"V-Line\" grille from the prototype Hudson model. Through effective [[market segment]]ation, the Ambassador was [[Positioning (marketing)|positioned]] to compete with the larger models offered by other automakers.\n\nModel identification was located on the car's front fenders and deck lid. '''Super''' trim level Ambassadors featured painted side trim in a color that complemented the body color; '''Custom''' models featured a silver [[anodized aluminum]] panel on sedans and vinyl woodgrain decals on station wagons. Ambassador body styles included a four-door sedan and a [[hardtop]] sedan, a four-door pillared station wagon, and the aforementioned hardtop station wagon, a body style that first saw duty as an industry first in the 1956 [[Nash Rambler|Nash and Hudson Rambler]] line, on which all of the 1958 Ramblers were based.\n\nThe Ambassador had an excellent power-to-weight ratio for its time and provided spirited performance with [[0 to 60 mph]] (0 to 97&nbsp;km/h) times of less than 10-seconds, and low 17-second times through a quarter-mile (402&nbsp;m) [[dragstrip]]. It could be equipped with a [[limited slip differential]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-20-21 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816065829/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-20-21 |archivedate=August 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> as well as power brakes, power steering, power windows, and [[air conditioning]].

[[Scotchlite]] reflectors were also added to the rear of the tailfins to increase visibility at night. Front and rear bumpers were over 20% thicker, and featured recessed center sections to protect [[license plates]]. Adjustable headrests were now available as an option for the front seats, an industry first. [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] touted the added comfort the headrests provided, as well as their potential for reducing [[whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] injuries in the event of a rear-end collision. Other changes included the activation of the starter through the neutral pushbutton (on automatic transmission equipped cars), and the addition of an optional \"Powr-Saver\" engine fan, which featured a [[Fan clutch|fluid-filled clutch]] for quieter high-speed operation.\n\nThe 1959 model year also saw the addition of an optional \"Air-Coil Ride\" [[air suspension]] system, utilizing air bags installed within the rear coil springs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/AMC/1959_AMC/1959_Rambler_Wagons/1959-Rambler-Wagons-05 |title=1959 Rambler Wagons brochure |publisher=oldcarbrochures.org |accessdate=23 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522175749/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/AMC/1959_AMC/1959_Rambler_Wagons/1959-Rambler-Wagons-05 |archivedate=May 22, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref> An engine-driven [[Gas compressor|compressor]], reservoir, and ride-height control valve comprised the rest of the system, but as other automakers discovered, the troublesome nature of air-suspension outweighed its benefits. [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] discontinued the unpopular option at the end of the model year.\n\nAmbassador sales improved considerably over 1958, reaching an output of 23,769; nearly half of which were '''Custom''' four-door sedans. Much rarer was the hardtop station wagon, of which only 578 were built.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Second generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image        = 1960 AMC Rambler Ambassador sedan green NJ.jpg\n| caption      = 1960 Ambassador V8 by Rambler\n| model_years  = 1960\u20131961\n| aka          = Rambler Ambassador\n| name         = Second generation\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] station wagon }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|117|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]]\n}}\n\n=== 1960 ===\n1960 saw the Ambassador lineup totally reskinned, wearing new fenders, hood, deck lid, door skins, roofline, grille, taillights, bumpers, windshield, and backlight. Significant were the lower hood line, lower windshield cowl, simplified side trim, egg crate grill, while the tailfins were reduced in height and were canted to either side making for a modern and integrated appearance. The overall effect was rather fresh, as the new roof had a lower, lighter look, to complement the lower fins and grille.\n\nAll Ambassadors came equipped with the American Motors {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]], but for the first time it was available in two versions. First was the original {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|360|lb\u00b7ft|N\u00b7m|abbr=on}} of torque, performance version equipped with the 4-barrel carburetor and a 9.7:1 compression ratio, which required premium fuel, and a second economy version running on regular gasoline making {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|340|lb\u00b7ft|N\u00b7m|abbr=on}} of torque, equipped with a 2-barrel carburetor and an 8.7:1 compression ratio.\n\nAmbassadors now came with a unique compound curved windshield that cut into the roof. This improved visibility, did away with the \u201cknee knocker\u201d dogleg design of AMC's first generation wrap-around windshield, and resulted in an even stiffer unitized structure. The 1960 Ambassador had a low cowl which with the compound windshield afforded excellent visibility. The Ambassador was offered in higher end Custom or entry level Super trim levels. All 1960 Ambassadors came with a new instrument cluster under a padded cowl, as well as illuminated controls for lights, wipers, fan, and defrost functions. The 1960 Ambassadors continued with an enclosed drive shaft (torque tube) and coil springs at all four corners, although the suspension was revised resulting in better handling. The top-of-the-line Ambassador models came standard with individual \"airliner\" reclining front seats that now had even more luxurious fabrics than in previous years.\n\nThe Ambassador was the only American midsize, luxury high-performance car offered in 1960. The 1960 Ambassador came in 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], 4-door pillarless hardtop, 4-door [[station wagon]], and a 4-door pillarless ([[hardtop]]) station wagon. Equipped with the 270&nbsp;horsepower 327&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in V8, and the Borg Warner pushbutton-operated 3-speed planetary gear and torque converter automatic transmission, the Ambassadors reached {{convert|60|mph|km/h|0}} in just over 9 seconds and passed the quarter-mile in 17 seconds.\n\n=== 1961 ===\n[[File:1961 Rambler Ambassador Custom blue-fl.jpg|thumb|left|1961 Rambler Ambassador Custom]]\n[[File:1961 AMC Rambler Ambassador 4-door pink rear.JPG|thumb|right|1961 Rambler Ambassador sedan]]\n\nThe 1961 Ambassador continued the previous year's {{convert|117|in|mm|0|adj=on}} basic [[Unit body|unitized platform]], but received an unusual new front-end styling that was overseen by AMC's in-house design department headed by [[Edmund E. Anderson|Edmund Anderson]]. The new face consisted of a trapezoid grille and headlights that floated in a body-colored panel, while the front fenders arched downward and forward of the leading edge of the hood. Different from anything else on the market, AMC's marketing department promoted the look as \"European.\" While the new look was meant to distinguish the Ambassador from the lower-priced Ramblers, it was neither a consumer success nor well received in the automotive press. Overall sales fell as the entire industry was experiencing a [[recession]]. The hardtop sedan and wagon models did not return for 1961.\n\nStandard was the {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with a [[Manual transmission#Synchronized transmission|synchromesh manual transmission]].

And while Rambler sales had been good enough for third place in industry sales (behind [[Chevrolet]] and [[Ford]]), AMC's management was working on a revolutionary and somewhat costly design set to debut for the 1963 model year. In the meantime, American Motors needed to save money, and since the Ambassador's sales had fallen in 1961, it was decided that the car would be downsized for 1962 to share its body, windshield and {{convert|108|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase with its [[Rambler Classic|Classic]] line mate. Accordingly, the car was marketed as a '''Rambler Ambassador'''.\n\nThe 1962 Ambassador received a new front end that was very similar to the 1961\u201362 Classic's, but with a crosshatch design, recessed center section, and '''Ambassador''' lettering. New, rectangular taillights were seen at the ends of restyled rear fenders, which lost their fins entirely. Exterior trim was reshuffled, and a new 2-door pillared sedan debuted. A new '400' trim line was added at the top of the line, with Super and Custom models remaining. The Ambassador offered even more luxurious interiors, perhaps to make up for the fact that it now shared its wheelbase with the Rambler Classic. The 400 could be had with vinyl [[bucket seat]]s, headrests, and color coordinated shag carpets.\n\nThe only available engine was AMC's {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} OHV V8, in either the regular fuel, 2-barrel carburetor and 8.7:1 compression ratio, {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version or the premium gasoline, 4-barrel version with 9.7:1 compression ratio, {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version. The 1962 Ambassador came with a dual chamber [[master brake cylinder]] that separated the front and rear brakes so that in the event of the failure of one chamber some braking function would remain. This design was offered by only a few cars at that time. The 1962 models were equipped with \"Walker\" (brand) flow-through mufflers. The {{convert|108|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase 1962 Ambassador was lighter than its {{convert|117|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase predecessors and when equipped with the {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, it was a spirited performer.\n\nThe 1962, {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 Ambassador for the first time used the same {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase structure as did the 1957 Rambler Rebel which was also equipped with an earlier solid lifter version of the AMC 327. The 1957 Rambler Rebel equipped with a 3-speed column mounted manual transmission, was the quickest 4-door sedan made in the United States, achieving {{convert|0|to|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} [[acceleration]] in just over 7 seconds, making it faster than the Hemi [[Chrysler 300 letter series|Chrysler 300C]], the [[DeSoto Adventurer]], the Dodge D500, the Plymouth Fury, and the Chevrolet fuel-injected 283.<ref>{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide''|title=1957-1960 Rambler Rebel |publisher=howstuffworks.com |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1960-rambler-rebel1.htm |date=22 August 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> The 1962 Ambassador was available with a 3-speed manual transmission and being basically the same vehicle, should also reach 60&nbsp;mph about as quickly as did the 1957 Rambler Rebel.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fourth generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| model_years  = 1963\u20131964\n| image        = File:1963 Rambler Ambassador 880 sedan gold-white K-f.jpg\n| caption      = 1963 Rambler Ambassador 880 Sedan\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 2-door [[coupe]] (1963) | 4-door sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 2-door [[hardtop]] (1964) }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|112|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|188.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|71.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|55.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]]\n| name         = Fourth generation\n}}\n\n=== 1963 ===\n[[File:1963 Rambler Ambassador 990 Sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Rambler Ambassador 990 Sedan]]\nIn 1962 Romney left AMC to run for [[Governor of Michigan|Governor]] of [[Michigan]], a position that he won. The automaker's new president, [[Roy Abernethy]], who was responsible for the increasing sales under Romney, reacted to the mounting competition (in 1963 AMC built as many cars as they had in 1960, but overall total car sales had increased so much that it gave AMC only sixth place in production; the same output in 1960 had put them third) in a logical way: \"Let's get rid of this Romney image.\"<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964\">{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1963-1964 AMC/Rambler Ambassador & Classic, page 1|date=21 November 2007 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1963-1964-amc-rambler-ambassador-classic.htm |accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nA completely redesigned larger Rambler lineup appeared.

AMC Ambassador and Classics used outerpanels stamped from single sheet metal panels which included both door frames and outer rocker panels. This resulted in an extremely rigid and rattle-free structure, better fit of doors into frames, production cost savings and reduced noise, vibration and harshness. The \"uniside\" structure was superior to the conventional production methods in which multiple smaller pieces were welded together.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://amcrc.com/aug05feature.html |last=Isbrandt |first=Ralph H. |title=Rambler Engineering |journal=Motor Trend |date=February 1963 |publisher=AMCRC |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> There were 30% fewer parts and the result was greater structural rigidity, quieter car operation, and an overall weight reduction of about {{convert|150|lb|kg|0|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/>\n\nCurved side glass and [[push-button]] door handles were new and costly upgrades, but contributed to the new Rambler's handsome, elegant, and modern Mercedes-like bodyside styling, by adding greater elegance in detail. At the time, curved side glass was used only in much more expensive luxury cars, but increased interior room and visibility, as well as reducing wind noise and improved proportions and styling of the cars.<ref name=\"DrivingGeorgeRomney\"/> The Ambassador also featured a squared-off [[Ford Thunderbird|Thunderbird]]-type roofline.<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/> The front end featured a forward-thrusting upper and lower ends with a vertical bar \"electric shaver\" chrome grille insert. The Ambassador's grille was differentiated from the Classic's grille by its use of the Ambassador name in script in the small horizontal bar between the upper and lower grille sections. Round quad headlights were slightly recessed in chrome bezels mounted side-by-side within the grille at its outermost edges. Overall, the new Ambassadors were described by the staff of ''Automotive Fleet'' magazine as \"probably the finest looking cars ever produced by American Motors.\"<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/>\n\nAmbassadors once again came in 2-door [[coupe]], 4-door sedan, and 4-door wagon body styles, but new trim lines debuted. A \"Mercedes-like three-number model designation was developed\" with the '''800''' as the Ambassador's base line (replacing the previous year's Super model) for the police, taxi, and fleet market, a '''880''' model (in place of the Custom), and the up level '''990''' trim (replacing the previous 400 models).<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964_1\"/>\n\nThe 1963 Ambassadors were offered only with the {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, in either {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 2-barrel or {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 4-barrel versions. AMC's smaller {{convert|287|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine was only offered in the Classic line. The automatic transmission was controlled by a steering column mounted lever, replacing the previous pushbutton system. Maintenance was reduced with service intervals of the front wheel bearings increased from {{convert|12000|-|25000|mi|km|0|abbr=off}}, the recommended engine oil change was at {{convert|4000|mi|km|0|abbr=off}}, and all Ambassador models included an [[Alternator (automotive)|alternator]] and an [[Voltage regulator|electronic voltage regulator]] as standard equipment.<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/>\n\nSales were brisk, and the redesign was billed a success, with ''[[Motor Trend]]'' Magazine bestowing '''[[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Car of the Year]]''' status on the entire 1963 Rambler line, including the Ambassador. The marketing formula for the Ambassador generated record sales for the model with buyers favoring more luxury and features as evidenced by the Ambassador 990 models outselling the 880 versions by nearly 2-to-1, while the base 800 model had a total of only 43 two-door sedans built.<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964_1\"/> The automaker did not have the resources of GM, Ford, and Chrysler, nor the sales volume to spread out its new model tooling and advertising costs over large production volumes; however, Richard Teague \"turned these economical cars into smooth, streamlined beauties with tons of options and V-8 pep.\"<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1963-1964 AMC/Rambler Ambassador & Classic Specifications |date=21 November 2007 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1963-1964-amc-rambler-ambassador-classic2.htm |accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== 1964 ===\nThe 1964 model year introduced minor trim changes and new options. The \"electric-shaver\" grille on the 1963 model was replaced with a flush-mounted design, and the engine and transmission options were widened. A two-door [[hardtop]] body style called '''990-H''' was added for the first time since 1957. Base 880 and the 880 models were dropped from the line.\n\nThe 1964 Ambassadors featured the {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 2-barrel {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 as standard, with the 4-barrel {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version as optional. The automaker did not offer a 4-speed manual transmission to compete with the sporty mid-size V8 offerings from Ford or GM. Instead, AMC offered its innovative \u201cTwin-Stick\u201d manual transmission. The \"Twin stick\" option consisted a three-speed manual transmission, operated by one of the two console mounted \"sticks\" in conjunction with an overdrive unit that was controlled by the second \"stick\" in both 2nd and 3rd gears. This gave the driver the option of using five forward gears.

Using the experience he gained as an outstanding salesman as a guide, Abernethy closely looked at the direction that American Motors' competition was going and decided that the company would be much more successful if its products competed more directly with the Big Three. He would achieve this by pushing all AMC vehicles further upmarket among the various [[market segment]]s, shaking off the company's economy car image, and offering vehicles once again in all three major American car size classes: compact, intermediate, and full-size. The American and Classic were strong competitors in the former two segments, so for the 1965 model year, he set his sights on turning the Ambassador into a proper full-size car by stretching the Classic's wheelbase and giving it much different styling. The general sizes of automobiles at that time were based on industry standard wheelbase lengths, rather than on the vehicle's interior and cargo space. The 1965 Ambassador represented a fundamental shift in corporate ideology, a shift away from primarily fuel-efficient vehicles, to bigger, faster, and potentially more profitable cars.<ref name=\"gunn65-66\">{{cite web |last=Gunn |first=Malcolm |title=Fine Lines: 1965\u20131966 AMC Ambassador |publisher=auto123 |url= http://www.auto123.com/en/car-reviews/used/fine-lines-1965-1966-amc-ambassador?model=AMBASSADOR&artid=66071&pg=1 |date=23 July 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Ambassador rode the same platform as its 1963\u201364 forebears, the 1965 models looked all-new.

At the front, the Ambassador again sparked minor controversy with its new vertically stacked quad headlights, which were slightly recessed in their bezels, as they flanked an all-new horizontal bar grille. This new wall-to-wall grille projected forward, horizontally, in the center, to create an effect somewhat opposite to 1963's grille treatment. The front end design provided a bold, rugged appearance.<ref name=\"Vance65-66\"/>\n\nOnce again, the Ambassador\u2019s entire extra wheelbase was ahead of the cowl, meaning that interior volume was the same as the intermediate-sized Classic. Another new body style debuted in the Ambassador lineup for 1965: an attractive new convertible offered as part of the 990 series. This was the first time a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] was offered in the Ambassador line since 1948. All Ambassador body styles (except the 990-H coupe) offered seating for six passengers, with coupes and convertibles having the option of buckets seats with center console and floor shifter.

[[Chevrolet|Bel Air]] and [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]], Ford Custom 500 and [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie]], as well as [[Plymouth Fury]]) came with six-cylinder engines as standard equipment. They therefore appealed to a wider range of customers than the Ambassador was getting.

The effect was repeated in the new vertical wraparound taillamps with the top-line models receiving a twin set of horizontal ribbed moldings across the back of the trunk lid that simulated the look of the front grille. Hardtop coupes received a redesigned roofline that was angular in appearance with an angle cut rear side windows and rectangular rear window. The backlight no longer curved and wrapped slightly around the C-pillars. The changes made for a more \"formal\" [[notchback]] look that was popular at the time.\n\nStation wagons also received a new roof (that did not have as pronounced dip over the rear cargo area) as well as a redesigned tailgate and optional [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] exterior side panels.

Abernethy was again responsible for this marketing move, as he attempted to move the stylish new Ambassador even further upmarket. To him, that meant that the Rambler name, and its economy car image would be eschewed to give the car a clean slate in a market that was turning away from economy and toward V8 performance.

The grille itself was blackout with a chrome horizontal bar that connected the headlight clusters. The hood was redesigned to accommodate the grille's raised center portion, and it faintly recalled [[Packard|Packard's]] classic grille/hood combination. [[Richard A. Teague]], AMC's Vice President of Styling, had worked at the luxury car manufacturer before joining AMC. Parking lights were rectangular and mounted horizontally in recessed wells in the front bumper, just beneath each set of headlights. The entire front fascia leaned forward slightly to lend an air of forward motion to the car's appearance.\n\nAt the rear, ribbed rectangular taillights were mounted inboard the Ambassadors rearward-thrusting rear fenders. Square ribbed marker lights of similar height were mounted at the trailing edge of each fender side. The deck lid had a slightly higher lift over. The base and DPL models had no decorative panel connecting the taillights while the top-line SST versions featured a panel painted red to match the taillights. Station wagons saw vertical wraparound taillights replacing the previous \"hooded\" units, which were not visible from the side. The 1969 AMC Ambassador was a smooth, powerful, well-proportioned sedan that did not look like anything else on the road.<ref>{{cite web |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1967, 1968, 1969 AMC Ambassador Specifications \u2013 page 2 |publisher=howstuffworks.com |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1967-1969-amc-ambassador2.htm |date=26 November 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe interiors were upgraded and a new deeply hooded dashboard clustered instruments and controls in front of the driver. There was an increased emphasis on luxury-type trim and features. The base model two-door hardtop was dropped for 1969.\n\nThe 1969 Ambassador stressed luxury, with the marketing tagline developed by [[Mary Wells Lawrence]] at the Wells Rich Greene agency, tying the car's value, \"It will remind you of the days when money really bought something.\"<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CyBFAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA102&dq=1969+Ambassador+It+will+remind+you+of+the+days+when+money+really+bought+something |page=102 |title=American Motors Corporation: The Rise and Fall of America's Last Independent |first=Patrick R. |last=Foster |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2013 |isbn=9780760344255 |accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> The combination of rich velour upholstery, individually adjustable reclining seats, standard air conditioning, and the longer wheelbase were highlighted in advertisements with Ambassador's posh\"[[limousine]]\" ride at an economical price. One aspect of this new advertising theme included many AMC dealers inviting prospective customers to call and request a \"demonstration ride\", in which a uniformed chauffeur would arrive at the prospect's home and drive them around in an Ambassador SST sedan. AMC's efforts worked, and Ambassador sales shot up again.\n\n[[File:1969 AMC Ambassador limousine in Wisconsin sideR.JPG|thumb|left|1969 Ambassador Royale Stretch Limo by Armbruster/Stageway.

The conversions were unusual in that they did not keep the stock rear doors\u2014as is typical in most limos. The back doors were welded shut and the Ambassadors were lengthened by inserting a section just behind the original [[Pillar (car)|B-pillar]] that had an entirely new central door in this center making a large opening for entry and egress. {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on|spell=In}} steel \"I-beams\" bridge the expanse created by stretch.

On hardtop coupes, this restyling resulted in a sloping roofline that saw upswept reverse-angle quarter windows. The belt line kicked up at the point the hardtop's rear windows swept upward, and tapered back to the fender end, meeting a new loop-type rear bumper.\n\nOn sedans, the roof line showed a slimmer C-pillar, squared-off rear door windows, and met a belt line that kicked up beneath the trailing edge of each rear door window. The belt line tapered back to the same rear fascia as the hardtop coupe's. This rear fascia contained a new ribbed taillight lens that stretched wall-to-wall and included twin square white reverse light lenses in its center.\n\nStation wagons received no change to their rooflines, doors, and rear fascias. However, all Ambassadors received a new extruded aluminum grille at the front, featuring several widely spaced bright horizontal bars with one wide, body colored horizontal grille bar extending to each headlight cluster. The {{convert|290|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was replaced for 1970 by a new {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine. This {{convert|210|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4400 rpm and {{convert|305|lb.ft|N\u00b7m|0}} of torque at 2800 rpm was the standard engine on all DPL and SST models. The {{convert|343|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was also supplanted by a {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine available in either 2-barrel, regular gasoline, or high-output, 4-barrel, premium fuel versions. The 4-barrel \"AMX\" {{convert|390|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine was optional, producing {{convert|325|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 3200 rpm and {{convert|420|lb.ft|N\u00b7m|0}} of torque at 3200 rpm.\n\n=== 1971 ===\n[[File:1971 AMC Ambassador 2-door hardtop coupe.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Ambassador hardtop with TurboCast II wheels from 1979\u201383]]\n[[File:1971 AMC Ambassador station wagon red with woodgrain side panels.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Ambassador station wagon]]\n\nFollowing the previous year's redesign, the 1971 Ambassadors received only minor changes and improvements. The marketing tag line for the year was the [[Underdog (competition)|underdog]] asking, \"If you had to compete with GM, Ford and Chrysler, what would you do?\"\u2014that was answered by AMC including more features, advantages, and benefits for buyers of its cars compared to the models from its much larger competitors. This was reflected by shuffling the Ambassador models for 1971 and by including more equipment in the standard feature list. The previously nameless base models were dropped, as the sedan-only DPL trim line was relegated to base model status, and a new top-line '''Brougham''' trim line was added above mid-line SST models. Both SST and Brougham models came as hardtop coupes, sedans, and wagons.\n\nThe DPL came with AMC's new {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|150|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Inline-6 with seven main bearings. All the SSTs and Broughams featured the {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine with {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} as standard. BorgWarner's \"Shift-Command\" automatic transmissions were standard equipment across the line. Two of AMC's {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} were optional; an 8.5:1 compression version with a two-barrel carburetor or a high-compression four-barrel V8 that required premium-fuel. The previous \"AMX 390\" V8 gave way to a new {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|335|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V8 as the top engine option.\n\nStyling changes consisted of a new fascia up front. It featured headlights contained in their own chrome pods separate from, but flanking the new grille with a bright rectangular surround, with rounded edges. The \"natural\" cast [[pot metal]] grille insert was recessed and featured a bright vertical bar pattern. A second set of parking lights was added outboard of the headlight clusters, and they were integrated into the fender extension to eliminate the need for separate front marker lights.\n\nTaillights on hardtop coupes and sedans still ran wall-to-wall, but the twin backup lights were moved from the center to further outboard\u2014approximately eight inches in from either fender side. Once again, the wagon received few changes at the rear, but added a new design for its optional woodgrain side trim, which filled in its upper bodysides. Its lower edge flowed downward aft of its peak at the leading edge above each front wheelhouse, in similar fashion to the [[Buick Skylark]]'s side \"sweepspear\" styling cue.\n\nAmbassador base models were offered to fleet buyers with various police, [[taxicab]], and other heavy-duty packages. Governments and police departments in the U.S. historically used standard-size, low-price line four-door sedans.

This backing also included mechanical upgrades to increase durability and quality, such as the standardization of electric windshield wipers on all model lines, replacing AMC's vacuum-powered units, as well as better interior trims. By focusing on quality, the smallest domestic automaker was profitable for 1972, earning US$30.2 million (the highest net profit achieved by AMC since 1964) on $4 billion in sales.\n\nThe base Ambassador DPL model was canceled, with three body styles now available in SST and Brougham trim. Fleet purchasers could order plain Ambassadors in Police Pursuit Vehicle (PPV) or Special Service Package (SSP) versions. A six-cylinder engine was no longer available; thus, Ambassador became a V8-only car for the first time since 1964. This made the Ambassador the only volume-produced American car that included air conditioning, power brakes, automatic transmission, and a V8 engine as standard equipment; all while being priced less than the Big Three's full-sized cars.<ref name=\"1972AMCphotos\">{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/AMC/1972_AMC/1972_Ambassador_Promo/1972%20Ambassador%20Promo-01.html |title=1972 AMC Ambassador press photos |date=1 September 1971 |work=The Old Car Manual Project |accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref> The base engine was the {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} with two {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} or a {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} versions optional.

The grille gained heavier horizontal bars and headlight bezels took on blackout trim in their recessed portions.\n\n== Eighth generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| model_years  = 1974\n| image        = 1974 AMC Ambassador Brougham 4-door sedan beige.JPG\n| caption      = 1974 Ambassador Brougham sedan\n| class        = [[Full-size car|Full-size]]\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door [[station wagon]] }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|122|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|217.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list | {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]] | {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 | {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 }}\n| transmission = 3-speed ''[[Torqueflite|Torque Command]]'' [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| name         = Eighth generation\n}}\n\n=== 1974 ===\n[[File:1974 AMC Ambassador sedan blue-white Kenosha-r.jpg|thumb|left|1974 AMC Ambassador sedan]]\n[[File:1974 AMC Ambassador sedan blue-white Kenosha-a.jpg|thumb|left|1974 AMC Ambassador sedan]]\n\nAmbassador sales had remained steady since 1970, despite the lack of major changes to the vehicle. 1974 models were stretched, {{convert|7|in|mm|spell=in}}, just as the 1973 [[1973 oil crisis|Arab Oil Embargo]] sparked nationwide gasoline rationing to accommodate energy absorbing bumpers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Norbye |first=Jan P. |title=New bumpers have uniform height, take angle impacts |journal=Popular Science |pages=90\u201391 |date=October 1973 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lpiMSzja6W4C&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=New+bumpers+have+uniform+Ambassador |volume=203 |issue=4 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe 1974 Ambassador Brougham was no longer available as a 2-door (pillar-less) [[hardtop]], leaving the 4-door sedan and station wagon body styles. The hardtop's cancellation was due in part to low sales volume of the Ambassador 2-door versions, as well as the introduction of the 1974 [[AMC Matador|Matador coupe]] which received the ''[[Car and Driver]]'' \"Best Styled Car of 1974,\" featuring a long hood and short rear deck design that avoided (at least on introduction) period hallmarks such as imitation landau bars and opera lights.<ref>{{cite journal |title=none|journal=Car and Driver |date=November 1973 }}</ref>\n\nStyling changes for the Ambassador sedan and wagon included revised front fender caps on the same fenders used since 1969, and hood, grille, bumpers, rear fascia, instrument panel, interior trim, hood ornament, and a new font for the Ambassador nameplate. The grille showed off a new squared-off loop-type design surrounding the circular recessed quad headlights, and featured a forward-protruding center. The insert held a crosshatch pattern dominated by two thick horizontal bars that connected the headlight bezels and contained new parking lights between them. These parking lights had amber lenses, followed the grille protrusion forward, and were overlaid by the grille's crosshatch trim. Headlamp bezels were once again blacked out in their recessed areas. The new hood and front bumper followed the grille's central protrusion forward, giving the car a slight \"coffin nose\" look. The revised [[AMC Matador|Matador]] sedan saw a similar frontal treatment in 1974, but with a much more pronounced effect and with different single headlamp clusters, hood, and grille insert.\n\nAs with the new Matador sedan, the new rear bumper was much larger and backed by shock absorbers, as it was beefed up to comply with new [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] regulations for standardized front and rear bumpers on passenger cars that could sustain a {{convert|5|mph|0|adj=on}} impact with no damage. Sedan rear fenders received fiberglass caps that wrapped inward to create a recessed space that met a carryover [[decklid]]. In this space was mounted the new rectangular taillight housings, which featured taller white backup lights mounted inboard of the new taillights. The license plate moved from the rear bumper to the area between the new taillight assemblies, and the whole taillight and license plate system on the sedans was surrounded its own loop of chrome trim. Both Ambassador and Matador sedans shared the same rear end styling. \n\nThe cargo area and the rear design of station wagons remained similar to previous Ambassadors, save for a massive new bumper and revised taillamps. The wagon was available with two-row bench seats for six passengers or with a rear-facing third row for a total eight seat-belted passengers. All came with numerous practical, appearance, and comfort items as standard. These included a two-way opening tail gate: (1) hinged at the bottom for convenient loading or hauling long cargo and (2) hinged at the side to open as door for ease of entry and exit for passengers or cargo; wood grained [[Transparency (optics)|semi-transparent]] vinyl side and rear trim, a full-length [[roof rack]]; as well as a chrome and wood grain roof air deflector to help keep the tailgate window clean.\n\nPowertrain selections remained the same as in 1973, with only [[AMC V8 engine|V8 engines]] and automatic transmissions available. When ordered with a trailer package (special wiring harness with heavy-duty flasher and heavy-duty suspension with rear sway bar), the Ambassador was rated for up to {{convert|5000|lb|0|adj=on}} towing capacity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schultz |first=Mort |title=Cars to take your rig in tow |journal=Popular Mechanics |pages=156\u2013157 |date=March 1974 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ddQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA156&dq=1974+AMC+Ambassador |volume=141 |issue=3 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> Other increases for 1974 included a larger capacity fuel tank, {{convert|24.9|usgal|L impgal|0|abbr=on}}, and an alternator producing 62 [[ampere]]s. New sound insulation made the Ambassador even quieter. All came with a very lengthy list of standard equipment that was typically optional on competing makes. These included comfort items such as air conditioning, an AM radio, and vanity mirror to appearance enhancements such as [[pin striping]] and [[whitewall tire]]s.\n\nSales of all full-size vehicles, regardless of the automaker, fell significantly in 1974 as America's focus shifted to smaller cars. Ambassador sales were no different, and in June 1974, the final AMC Ambassador rolled off the [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] assembly line, ending a nameplate that had been in continuous production in some form for 48 years.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==International markets==\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:AutoantiguodesfileMDP5-9jul2016.jpg|thumb|right|Fifth U.S. generation Ambassador 990 built by IKA from 1965 to 1972]] \n'''Industrias Kaiser Argentina''' [[Industrias Kaiser Argentina|(IKA)]] produced the U.S. third, fourth, and fifth generation Ambassadors in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina]] from 1962 to 1972, and later available by special order through 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/r/rambler.htm |title=IKA - Caracter\u00edsticas Classic Custom - Classic Custom De Luxe - Ambassador 440 |date=18 May 2009 |publisher=Coche Argentino |language=Spanish |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nAssembly of IKA Ramblers began in 1962, with the Argentinean cars being the 1961 U.S. versions, but equipped with {{convert|226|cuin|L|2|abbr=on}} [[Continental Motors Company|Continental]] I6 engines producing {{convert|119|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm, along with a steering column mounted manual three-speed transmission.

The Australian-built Ambassadors included a significant percentage of \"local content\" to gain import [[tariff]] (tax) concessions by using parts and components (such as interiors and upholstery) that were sourced from Australian manufacturers. AMI's first year of production resulted in 65 registrations for 1961. Registrations of the 1963 model continued into 1964 for a total of 21 Ambassadors registered for 1964.\n\nAlthough not documented in any AMI records, according to Australian Rambler afficionados 20 right-hand drive 1970 Ambassadors were fully imported from Canada, apparently 16 two-door hardtops and 4 four-door sedans. One possible reason for this was that it may have been a holding action while AMI was preparing for assembly of the new 1970 Rebel. AMC had assembled over 3,700 RHD Rambler Ambassadors for the U.S Postal Service in 1967, so they were well experienced in making completed right-hand drive vehicles. All Australian factory-RHD 1970 Ambassadors came with automatic transmission with floor shift.<ref>https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/benaraby/cars-vans-utes/rambler-ambassador/1242484069</ref>\n\nThe dash and instrument pack of the 1967 Ambassador which had been converted and used in the RHD Ambassadors assembled for the U.S Postal Service was thereafter used in all Australian and New Zealand-assembled Rambler Rebel and Matador models, and all RHD, U.S-built Rebel and Matadors for the United Kingdom.\n\n===New Zealand===\n[[File:1970 AMC Ambassador SST (14379718872).jpg|thumb|right|One of 12 factory-RHD 1970 Ambassadors for the New Zealand market ]]\n\nAmerican Motors motor vehicles were assembled in New Zealand by '''VW Motors''' at their Volkswagen plant in Otahuhu, Auckland from 1958 until 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/motoring/107503496/the-empty-halls-of-new-zealands-car-assembly-industry |title=The empty halls of New Zealand's car assembly industry |first=Todd |last=Niall |website=Stuff |date=6 October 2018 |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> From 1964, AMC vehicles were assembled by '''Campbell Motor Industries''' (CMI) in Thames, [[North Island]].

The model was virtually restricted to the four-door hardtop sedan only. It was powered by the four-barrel {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine producing {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} coupled to a three-speed automatic transmission. The model became the marque's top-of-the-line product alongside the three versions of the midsize Rambler and Rambler American models. \n\nHowever, low sales figures alongside a deteriorating relationship between AMC and Planta REO lead to the cancellation of the contract in the second half of 1959. <ref>{{cite book|first=Douglas C. |last=Bennett |first2=Kenneth E. |last2=Sharpe |title=Transnational Corporations versus the State: The Political Economy of the Mexican Auto Industry |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2014 |isbn=9780691022376}}</ref> American Motors once again exported its products into Mexico and a new local partner, Willys Mexicana that eventually would become '''Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos''' [[Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos|(VAM)]]. The agreement was signed in March 1960 and production began in Mexico City. \n\nThis meant the discontinuation of the Ambassador line in Mexico as the new operation had several priorities above offering a top-end luxury full-size car line. Aside from offering the already existing Jeep line, Willys Mexicana focused efforts on the compact Rambler American, which obtained a generation change just the next year, meaning a complete retooling of the Vallejo plant. In 1962, legal and industrial requirements in the country became stronger with the auto industry integration decree issued by president [[Adolfo L\u00f3pez Mateos]] in 1962. Among its mandates, it fully banned the importation of automobile engines. Willys Mexicana began building its own engine plant, which was achieved in November 1964. Once the Rambler American was consolidated in the Mexican market, Willys Mexicana opted to expand the product line by introducing the brand-new second generation Rambler Classic midsize model as a larger luxury counterpart to the economy compact American. Also in 1963, due to problems with WM's parent company (the SOMEX bank) as well as further requirements of the government auto industry decree, Willys Mexicana was reorganized into an entirely new company with expanded capital and direct investment from the Mexican government, Kaiser Willys, and American Motors. This resulted in the formation of Veh\u00edculos Automotores Mexicanos S.A. \n\nAfter the corporate transition process between 1960 and 1964 concluded, in which the Rambler marque under VAM surpassed the commercial results of its local predecessors Armadora Mexicana and Planta REO combined between 1950 and 1959, the company opted not to offer the Ambassador model. The Mexican market of the era was still relatively small and since the Ambassador shared mostly the same styling as the contemporary midsize model of the company, it was considered that internal competition would affect the sales of a simultaneous Rambler Classic/Ambassador line-up. Unlike the United States, which had a much larger and diverse market for two different car lines with the same styling, AMC could offer a strong difference between both models with the exclusive V8 engine for the Ambassador and the Classic being restricted to six cylinders only. This advantage did not exist in Mexico since VAM could only produce six cylinder engines in its Lerma plant and V8 engines could not be imported from AMC due to the ban of the 1962 decree. Instead, VAM opted to use the Rambler Classic as its most luxurious and flagship model, giving it the same treatment AMC put in the Ambassador model in the US and Canada. This would be passed on to the subsequent equivalent Rebel and Matador models produced under VAM. \n\nThe 1958\u20131959 Ambassador models represent the only chapter in this model's history to be present in Mexico. These were the only full-size American Motors products sold in the country alongside the second generation VAM Classic (Matador) models. Even more unique was the fact that it was a factory V8 model, the only one of its kind to ever be sold in Mexico belonging to American Motors.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nRambler Ambassadors were exported in limited numbers to the United Kingdom in factory right-hand-drive direct from AMC during the 1960s and up to its final year of 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/File:Im196610MotSC-RamblerMots.jpg |title=Image of Rambler Motors (AMC) Ltd. advertisement |website=www.gracesguide.co.uk |date=1967 |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> They were imported by '''Rambler Motors (A.M.C) Ltd''' of Chiswick in West London which became a subsidiary of AMC in 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Rambler_Motors |title=Rambler Motors |website=www.gracesguide.co.uk |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> The location had previously been used since 1926 for British assembly of Hudson, Essex, and Terraplane vehicles<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/april-1968/44/us-car-concessionaires-great-britain|title=U.S. Car Concessionaires in Great Britain |date=April 1968 |website=Motor Sport Magazine (Archive) |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> and later AMC's post-1954 Hudson, Nash and Rambler models. Ambassador models marketed in the UK were the Ambassador saloon (sedan), SST coupe, and station wagon. AMC vehicles were distributed by London distributors Clarke and Simpson Limited and were marketed as \"the only American car built with RHD.\"<ref>http://www.classiccarcatalogue.com/RAMBLER%201968.html</ref> As with all export markets UK models were marketed as \"Rambler\" even after the Rambler marque was dropped in the USA.\n\n== Epilogue ==\nBecause AMC was focusing its attentions on their newly acquired [[Jeep]] line, the redesigned 1974 Matador coupe, and the [[AMC Pacer]], which would debut in 1975, the company would not put forth the investment to continue the full-size Ambassador line after its 1974 redesign. Instead, the automaker upgraded the Matador sedan and wagon counterparts starting with the 1975 model year. The basic [[automobile platform]] was used by AMC since the 1967 model year, and the full-size automobile market segment was declining. American Motors strategy now aimed at smaller cars and sport-utility vehicles.\n\nHowever, the Ambassador basically continued as the similarly sized and styled [[AMC Matador|Matador]] sedans and wagons. From 1975 they became available in uplevel \"Brougham\" trim and assumed the model numbers of the previously equivalent Ambassadors.<ref>{{cite book |last=Flory, Jr. |first=J. \u201cKelly\u201d

Rambler''', '''Rambler Ambassador''', and finally '''AMC Ambassador.''' Previously, the nameplate [[Nash Ambassador|Ambassador]] applied to [[Nash Motors|Nash's]] full-size cars. The nameplate referred to a trim level between 1927 and 1931.\n\nAmbassadors were manufactured in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] as well as at AMC's [[Brampton Assembly]] in Brampton, Ontario from 1963 to 1966. [[Australian Motor Industries]] (AMI) assembled Ambassadors from [[knock-down kit]]s with [[right-hand drive]] from 1961 to 1963. The U.S. fifth generation Ambassadors were manufactured by [[Industrias Kaiser Argentina]] (IKA) in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina]] from 1965 to 1972, as well as assembled by ECASA in [[Costa Rica]] from 1965 to 1970. Planta REO assembled first-generation Ambassadors in Mexico at its Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n plant. Fifth and seventh generation Ambassadors were modified into custom stretch [[limousine]]s in Argentina and the U.S.\n\n== Development ==\nFollowing [[George W. Mason]]'s unexpected death in the fall of 1954, [[George W. Romney|George Romney]] (whom Mason had been grooming as his eventual successor), succeeded him as president and CEO of the newly formed American Motors. Romney recognized that to be successful in the postwar marketplace, an automobile manufacturer would have to be able to produce and sell cars in sufficient volume to [[Amortization (business)|amortize]] the high cost of tooling. Toward that end, he set out to increase AMC's market share with its Rambler models that were selling in [[market segment]] in which the domestic Big Three ([[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company]], and [[Chrysler]]) automakers did not yet compete. While development of a redesigned 1958 Nash Ambassador, based on a stretched and reskinned 1956 Rambler [[Coachwork|body]] was almost complete, AMC's [[Automotive design|designers]] were also working on a retrimmed [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]] equivalent, called '''Rebel''', to offer Hudson [[Car dealership|dealers]].\n\nHowever, as sales of the large-sized [[Nash Ambassador]] and [[Hudson Hornet]] models slowed, it became clear to Romney that consumer confidence in the historic Nash and Hudson nameplates had collapsed. Reluctantly, he decided that 1957 would be the end of both nameplates, and the company would concentrate on the new Rambler line, which was registered as a separate [[marque]] for 1957.\n\nThe market positioning meant that \"the AMC Ambassador was a car with no real competitors throughout most of the sixties\" because it was viewed as a luxury-type car and could be put against the higher end large-sized models from the domestic Big Three automakers, but the Ambassador was more of a midsized car.<ref>{{cite book |last=Flory, Jr. |first=J. \u201cKelly\u201d |title=American Cars, 1973-1980: Every Model, Year by Year |date=2012 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786456369 |page=2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1DiNAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=the+AMC+Ambassador+was+a+car+with+no+real+competitors+throughout+most+of+the+sixtie |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n== First generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image        = Rambler Ambassador (3893707660).jpg\n| caption      = 1958 Ambassador V8, Custom sedan\n| model_years  = 1958\u20131959\n| aka          = Ambassador V8 by Rambler\n| name         = First generation\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] station wagon }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|117|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| engine       = {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]]\n}}\n\n=== 1958 ===\n[[File:1958 Ambassador 4-d hardtop.jpg|thumb|right|1958 Ambassador Custom hardtop sedan with [[continental tire]] ]]\n[[File:1958 Ambassador 4-d hardtop wagon 2.JPG|thumb|right|Ambassador hardtop (pillarless) Cross Country station wagon]]\n\nAmerican Motors planned to produce a stretched a {{convert|117|in|0|adj=on}} [[wheelbase]] version of the Rambler platform for Nash dealers to be the new Nash Ambassador, and another for Hudson dealers. Shortly before committing to production of the new long-wheelbase versions of the Hudson and the Nash, CEO Romney decided to abandon the Nash and Hudson marques.\n\nDespite the fact that the Nash and Hudson names were canceled, work on the car itself continued, and American Motors introduced debuted in the fall of 1957, the 1958 \"Ambassador V-8 by Rambler\" on a {{convert|117|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase. Its features included a {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]] (equipped with a 4-barrel [[carburetor]] and dual exhausts and rated at {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|360|lb\u00b7ft|N\u00b7m}} of torque) mated to a [[BorgWarner]] supplied 3-speed [[automatic transmission]] with push button gear selection.\n\nIn 1956, AMC first produced its own V8, a modern overhead valve V8 displacing {{convert|250|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, with a forged steel crank shaft, which when equipped with a 4-barrel carburetor was rated at {{convert|215|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. In 1957, AMC bored and stroked the 250 CID V8 to {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} displacement which when offered in the [[Rambler Rebel]] used solid lifters and Bendix electronic fuel injection was rated at {{convert|288|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 1958, the Ambassador was equipped with a hydraulic lifter version of AMC's 327 CID V8 rated at {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. Although AMC's 327 CID V8 shares its displacement with the Chevrolet small-block, AMC's 327 came out six years before Chevrolet first offered its 327 in 1962.\n\nThe Ambassador was available in a body style exclusive to its line, a pillarless [[hardtop]] '''Cross Country''' [[station wagon]]. The 1958 Ambassador was offered in a single high level trim level and came equipped with such luxury items as electric clock, twin front and rear ashtrays, Nash tradition \"deep coil\" spring suspension front and rear, split back reclining front seats that fold down into a bed, as well as upscale fabrics for the interior.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-24-25 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816085955/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-24-25 |archivedate=August 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nManagement had found that the public associated the Rambler name with small economy cars, and did not want the upscale nature of the new Ambassador to be so closely associated with Rambler's favorable, but economical image. Therefore, a decision was made that the larger Ambassador would be marketed as the '''Ambassador V-8 by Rambler''' in order to identify it with the Rambler name's burgeoning success, but to indicate an air of exclusivity by showing it to be a different kind of vehicle. However, the car wore \"Rambler Ambassador\" badges on its front fenders.\n\nThe 1958 Ambassador is a substantially longer car than the {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase [[Rambler Six]] and [[Rambler Rebel|Rebel V8]], although both lines shared the same basic body, styling, and visual cues. However, all of the Ambassador's extra {{convert|9|in|mm|spell=in}} of wheelbase (and, therefore, overall length) were added ahead of the cowl, meaning that the passenger compartment had the same volume as the smaller Ramblers. The Ambassadors came with plusher interior and exterior trims while the front end incorporated the Rebel \"V-Line\" grille from the prototype Hudson model. Through effective [[market segment]]ation, the Ambassador was [[Positioning (marketing)|positioned]] to compete with the larger models offered by other automakers.\n\nModel identification was located on the car's front fenders and deck lid. '''Super''' trim level Ambassadors featured painted side trim in a color that complemented the body color; '''Custom''' models featured a silver [[anodized aluminum]] panel on sedans and vinyl woodgrain decals on station wagons. Ambassador body styles included a four-door sedan and a [[hardtop]] sedan, a four-door pillared station wagon, and the aforementioned hardtop station wagon, a body style that first saw duty as an industry first in the 1956 [[Nash Rambler|Nash and Hudson Rambler]] line, on which all of the 1958 Ramblers were based.\n\nThe Ambassador had an excellent power-to-weight ratio for its time and provided spirited performance with [[0 to 60 mph]] (0 to 97&nbsp;km/h) times of less than 10-seconds, and low 17-second times through a quarter-mile (402&nbsp;m) [[dragstrip]]. It could be equipped with a [[limited slip differential]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-20-21 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816065829/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-20-21 |archivedate=August 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> as well as power brakes, power steering, power windows, and [[air conditioning]].

[[Scotchlite]] reflectors were also added to the rear of the tailfins to increase visibility at night. Front and rear bumpers were over 20% thicker, and featured recessed center sections to protect [[license plates]]. Adjustable headrests were now available as an option for the front seats, an industry first. [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] touted the added comfort the headrests provided, as well as their potential for reducing [[whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] injuries in the event of a rear-end collision. Other changes included the activation of the starter through the neutral pushbutton (on automatic transmission equipped cars), and the addition of an optional \"Powr-Saver\" engine fan, which featured a [[Fan clutch|fluid-filled clutch]] for quieter high-speed operation.\n\nThe 1959 model year also saw the addition of an optional \"Air-Coil Ride\" [[air suspension]] system, utilizing air bags installed within the rear coil springs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/AMC/1959_AMC/1959_Rambler_Wagons/1959-Rambler-Wagons-05 |title=1959 Rambler Wagons brochure |publisher=oldcarbrochures.org |accessdate=23 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522175749/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/AMC/1959_AMC/1959_Rambler_Wagons/1959-Rambler-Wagons-05 |archivedate=May 22, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref> An engine-driven [[Gas compressor|compressor]], reservoir, and ride-height control valve comprised the rest of the system, but as other automakers discovered, the troublesome nature of air-suspension outweighed its benefits. [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] discontinued the unpopular option at the end of the model year.\n\nAmbassador sales improved considerably over 1958, reaching an output of 23,769; nearly half of which were '''Custom''' four-door sedans. Much rarer was the hardtop station wagon, of which only 578 were built.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Second generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image        = 1960 AMC Rambler Ambassador sedan green NJ.jpg\n| caption      = 1960 Ambassador V8 by Rambler\n| model_years  = 1960\u20131961\n| aka          = Rambler Ambassador\n| name         = Second generation\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] station wagon }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|117|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]]\n}}\n\n=== 1960 ===\n1960 saw the Ambassador lineup totally reskinned, wearing new fenders, hood, deck lid, door skins, roofline, grille, taillights, bumpers, windshield, and backlight. Significant were the lower hood line, lower windshield cowl, simplified side trim, egg crate grill, while the tailfins were reduced in height and were canted to either side making for a modern and integrated appearance. The overall effect was rather fresh, as the new roof had a lower, lighter look, to complement the lower fins and grille.\n\nAll Ambassadors came equipped with the American Motors {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]], but for the first time it was available in two versions. First was the original {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|360|lb\u00b7ft|N\u00b7m|abbr=on}} of torque, performance version equipped with the 4-barrel carburetor and a 9.7:1 compression ratio, which required premium fuel, and a second economy version running on regular gasoline making {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|340|lb\u00b7ft|N\u00b7m|abbr=on}} of torque, equipped with a 2-barrel carburetor and an 8.7:1 compression ratio.\n\nAmbassadors now came with a unique compound curved windshield that cut into the roof. This improved visibility, did away with the \u201cknee knocker\u201d dogleg design of AMC's first generation wrap-around windshield, and resulted in an even stiffer unitized structure. The 1960 Ambassador had a low cowl which with the compound windshield afforded excellent visibility. The Ambassador was offered in higher end Custom or entry level Super trim levels. All 1960 Ambassadors came with a new instrument cluster under a padded cowl, as well as illuminated controls for lights, wipers, fan, and defrost functions. The 1960 Ambassadors continued with an enclosed drive shaft (torque tube) and coil springs at all four corners, although the suspension was revised resulting in better handling. The top-of-the-line Ambassador models came standard with individual \"airliner\" reclining front seats that now had even more luxurious fabrics than in previous years.\n\nThe Ambassador was the only American midsize, luxury high-performance car offered in 1960. The 1960 Ambassador came in 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], 4-door pillarless hardtop, 4-door [[station wagon]], and a 4-door pillarless ([[hardtop]]) station wagon. Equipped with the 270&nbsp;horsepower 327&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in V8, and the Borg Warner pushbutton-operated 3-speed planetary gear and torque converter automatic transmission, the Ambassadors reached {{convert|60|mph|km/h|0}} in just over 9 seconds and passed the quarter-mile in 17 seconds.\n\n=== 1961 ===\n[[File:1961 Rambler Ambassador Custom blue-fl.jpg|thumb|left|1961 Rambler Ambassador Custom]]\n[[File:1961 AMC Rambler Ambassador 4-door pink rear.JPG|thumb|right|1961 Rambler Ambassador sedan]]\n\nThe 1961 Ambassador continued the previous year's {{convert|117|in|mm|0|adj=on}} basic [[Unit body|unitized platform]], but received an unusual new front-end styling that was overseen by AMC's in-house design department headed by [[Edmund E. Anderson|Edmund Anderson]]. The new face consisted of a trapezoid grille and headlights that floated in a body-colored panel, while the front fenders arched downward and forward of the leading edge of the hood. Different from anything else on the market, AMC's marketing department promoted the look as \"European.\" While the new look was meant to distinguish the Ambassador from the lower-priced Ramblers, it was neither a consumer success nor well received in the automotive press. Overall sales fell as the entire industry was experiencing a [[recession]]. The hardtop sedan and wagon models did not return for 1961.\n\nStandard was the {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with a [[Manual transmission#Synchronized transmission|synchromesh manual transmission]].

And while Rambler sales had been good enough for third place in industry sales (behind [[Chevrolet]] and [[Ford]]), AMC's management was working on a revolutionary and somewhat costly design set to debut for the 1963 model year. In the meantime, American Motors needed to save money, and since the Ambassador's sales had fallen in 1961, it was decided that the car would be downsized for 1962 to share its body, windshield and {{convert|108|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase with its [[Rambler Classic|Classic]] line mate. Accordingly, the car was marketed as a '''Rambler Ambassador'''.\n\nThe 1962 Ambassador received a new front end that was very similar to the 1961\u201362 Classic's, but with a crosshatch design, recessed center section, and '''Ambassador''' lettering. New, rectangular taillights were seen at the ends of restyled rear fenders, which lost their fins entirely. Exterior trim was reshuffled, and a new 2-door pillared sedan debuted. A new '400' trim line was added at the top of the line, with Super and Custom models remaining. The Ambassador offered even more luxurious interiors, perhaps to make up for the fact that it now shared its wheelbase with the Rambler Classic. The 400 could be had with vinyl [[bucket seat]]s, headrests, and color coordinated shag carpets.\n\nThe only available engine was AMC's {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} OHV V8, in either the regular fuel, 2-barrel carburetor and 8.7:1 compression ratio, {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version or the premium gasoline, 4-barrel version with 9.7:1 compression ratio, {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version. The 1962 Ambassador came with a dual chamber [[master brake cylinder]] that separated the front and rear brakes so that in the event of the failure of one chamber some braking function would remain. This design was offered by only a few cars at that time. The 1962 models were equipped with \"Walker\" (brand) flow-through mufflers. The {{convert|108|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase 1962 Ambassador was lighter than its {{convert|117|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase predecessors and when equipped with the {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, it was a spirited performer.\n\nThe 1962, {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 Ambassador for the first time used the same {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase structure as did the 1957 Rambler Rebel which was also equipped with an earlier solid lifter version of the AMC 327. The 1957 Rambler Rebel equipped with a 3-speed column mounted manual transmission, was the quickest 4-door sedan made in the United States, achieving {{convert|0|to|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} [[acceleration]] in just over 7 seconds, making it faster than the Hemi [[Chrysler 300 letter series|Chrysler 300C]], the [[DeSoto Adventurer]], the Dodge D500, the Plymouth Fury, and the Chevrolet fuel-injected 283.<ref>{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide''|title=1957-1960 Rambler Rebel |publisher=howstuffworks.com |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1960-rambler-rebel1.htm |date=22 August 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> The 1962 Ambassador was available with a 3-speed manual transmission and being basically the same vehicle, should also reach 60&nbsp;mph about as quickly as did the 1957 Rambler Rebel.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fourth generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| model_years  = 1963\u20131964\n| image        = File:1963 Rambler Ambassador 880 sedan gold-white K-f.jpg\n| caption      = 1963 Rambler Ambassador 880 Sedan\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 2-door [[coupe]] (1963) | 4-door sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 2-door [[hardtop]] (1964) }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|112|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|188.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|71.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|55.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]]\n| name         = Fourth generation\n}}\n\n=== 1963 ===\n[[File:1963 Rambler Ambassador 990 Sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Rambler Ambassador 990 Sedan]]\nIn 1962 Romney left AMC to run for [[Governor of Michigan|Governor]] of [[Michigan]], a position that he won.

This resulted in an extremely rigid and rattle-free structure, better fit of doors into frames, production cost savings and reduced noise, vibration and harshness. The \"uniside\" structure was superior to the conventional production methods in which multiple smaller pieces were welded together.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://amcrc.com/aug05feature.html |last=Isbrandt |first=Ralph H. |title=Rambler Engineering |journal=Motor Trend |date=February 1963 |publisher=AMCRC |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> There were 30% fewer parts and the result was greater structural rigidity, quieter car operation, and an overall weight reduction of about {{convert|150|lb|kg|0|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/>\n\nCurved side glass and [[push-button]] door handles were new and costly upgrades, but contributed to the new Rambler's handsome, elegant, and modern Mercedes-like bodyside styling, by adding greater elegance in detail. At the time, curved side glass was used only in much more expensive luxury cars, but increased interior room and visibility, as well as reducing wind noise and improved proportions and styling of the cars.<ref name=\"DrivingGeorgeRomney\"/> The Ambassador also featured a squared-off [[Ford Thunderbird|Thunderbird]]-type roofline.<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/> The front end featured a forward-thrusting upper and lower ends with a vertical bar \"electric shaver\" chrome grille insert. The Ambassador's grille was differentiated from the Classic's grille by its use of the Ambassador name in script in the small horizontal bar between the upper and lower grille sections. Round quad headlights were slightly recessed in chrome bezels mounted side-by-side within the grille at its outermost edges. Overall, the new Ambassadors were described by the staff of ''Automotive Fleet'' magazine as \"probably the finest looking cars ever produced by American Motors.\"<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/>\n\nAmbassadors once again came in 2-door [[coupe]], 4-door sedan, and 4-door wagon body styles, but new trim lines debuted. A \"Mercedes-like three-number model designation was developed\" with the '''800''' as the Ambassador's base line (replacing the previous year's Super model) for the police, taxi, and fleet market, a '''880''' model (in place of the Custom), and the up level '''990''' trim (replacing the previous 400 models).<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964_1\"/>\n\nThe 1963 Ambassadors were offered only with the {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, in either {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 2-barrel or {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 4-barrel versions. AMC's smaller {{convert|287|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine was only offered in the Classic line. The automatic transmission was controlled by a steering column mounted lever, replacing the previous pushbutton system. Maintenance was reduced with service intervals of the front wheel bearings increased from {{convert|12000|-|25000|mi|km|0|abbr=off}}, the recommended engine oil change was at {{convert|4000|mi|km|0|abbr=off}}, and all Ambassador models included an [[Alternator (automotive)|alternator]] and an [[Voltage regulator|electronic voltage regulator]] as standard equipment.<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/>\n\nSales were brisk, and the redesign was billed a success, with ''[[Motor Trend]]'' Magazine bestowing '''[[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Car of the Year]]''' status on the entire 1963 Rambler line, including the Ambassador. The marketing formula for the Ambassador generated record sales for the model with buyers favoring more luxury and features as evidenced by the Ambassador 990 models outselling the 880 versions by nearly 2-to-1, while the base 800 model had a total of only 43 two-door sedans built.<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964_1\"/> The automaker did not have the resources of GM, Ford, and Chrysler, nor the sales volume to spread out its new model tooling and advertising costs over large production volumes; however, Richard Teague \"turned these economical cars into smooth, streamlined beauties with tons of options and V-8 pep.\"<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1963-1964 AMC/Rambler Ambassador & Classic Specifications |date=21 November 2007 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1963-1964-amc-rambler-ambassador-classic2.htm |accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== 1964 ===\nThe 1964 model year introduced minor trim changes and new options. The \"electric-shaver\" grille on the 1963 model was replaced with a flush-mounted design, and the engine and transmission options were widened. A two-door [[hardtop]] body style called '''990-H''' was added for the first time since 1957. Base 880 and the 880 models were dropped from the line.\n\nThe 1964 Ambassadors featured the {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 2-barrel {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 as standard, with the 4-barrel {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version as optional. The automaker did not offer a 4-speed manual transmission to compete with the sporty mid-size V8 offerings from Ford or GM. Instead, AMC offered its innovative \u201cTwin-Stick\u201d manual transmission. The \"Twin stick\" option consisted a three-speed manual transmission, operated by one of the two console mounted \"sticks\" in conjunction with an overdrive unit that was controlled by the second \"stick\" in both 2nd and 3rd gears. This gave the driver the option of using five forward gears. One magazine noted the Twin-Stick, {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Ambassador was heading for a sub 16-second quarter-mile when they blew up the clutch.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:1964 Ambassador 2-d white f.jpg|1964 Rambler Ambassador\nFile:1964 Ambassador 2-d white r.jpg|1964 Rambler Ambassador\nFile:1964 Ambassador 2-d white i.jpg|1964 Rambler Ambassador interior with \"Twin-Stick\" transmission\n</gallery>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fifth generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| model_years  = 1965\u20131966\n| image        = 1965 AMC Ambassador black 2door-HT in NJ.JPG\n| caption      = 1965 Rambler Ambassador 990 2-door hardtop\n| aka          = Rambler Ambassador<br/>AMC Ambassador\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 2-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 2-door [[hardtop]] | 2-door [[convertible]] }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|116|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|200|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list | {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC Straight-6 engine|I6]] | {{convert|287|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]] | {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 }}\n| name         = Fifth generation\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list | 3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] | 3-speed with [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] | \"Twin-Stick\" on console (1965) | 4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] (1966) | 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] | 3-speed \u201cShift-Command\u201d on console }}\n}}\n\n=== 1965 ===\n\nNo matter how much success the new Ramblers achieved in the marketplace, Roy Abernethy was not completely satisfied. Using the experience he gained as an outstanding salesman as a guide, Abernethy closely looked at the direction that American Motors' competition was going and decided that the company would be much more successful if its products competed more directly with the Big Three. He would achieve this by pushing all AMC vehicles further upmarket among the various [[market segment]]s, shaking off the company's economy car image, and offering vehicles once again in all three major American car size classes: compact, intermediate, and full-size. The American and Classic were strong competitors in the former two segments, so for the 1965 model year, he set his sights on turning the Ambassador into a proper full-size car by stretching the Classic's wheelbase and giving it much different styling. The general sizes of automobiles at that time were based on industry standard wheelbase lengths, rather than on the vehicle's interior and cargo space. The 1965 Ambassador represented a fundamental shift in corporate ideology, a shift away from primarily fuel-efficient vehicles, to bigger, faster, and potentially more profitable cars.<ref name=\"gunn65-66\">{{cite web |last=Gunn |first=Malcolm |title=Fine Lines: 1965\u20131966 AMC Ambassador |publisher=auto123 |url= http://www.auto123.com/en/car-reviews/used/fine-lines-1965-1966-amc-ambassador?model=AMBASSADOR&artid=66071&pg=1 |date=23 July 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Ambassador rode the same platform as its 1963\u201364 forebears, the 1965 models looked all-new.

At the front, the Ambassador again sparked minor controversy with its new vertically stacked quad headlights, which were slightly recessed in their bezels, as they flanked an all-new horizontal bar grille. This new wall-to-wall grille projected forward, horizontally, in the center, to create an effect somewhat opposite to 1963's grille treatment. The front end design provided a bold, rugged appearance.<ref name=\"Vance65-66\"/>\n\nOnce again, the Ambassador\u2019s entire extra wheelbase was ahead of the cowl, meaning that interior volume was the same as the intermediate-sized Classic. Another new body style debuted in the Ambassador lineup for 1965: an attractive new convertible offered as part of the 990 series. This was the first time a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] was offered in the Ambassador line since 1948. All Ambassador body styles (except the 990-H coupe) offered seating for six passengers, with coupes and convertibles having the option of buckets seats with center console and floor shifter. The Ambassador 990-H was an up-scale two-door hardtop model, available only in 5-passenger form.\n[[File:1965 Ambassador 990 convertible yellow pb-rr.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Ambassador 990 convertible]]\nAmbassadors also saw an expanded list of trim lines, convenience options, and engine choices. The 990 and 990-H models were back, while 880 models were the new economy leaders in the 1965 Ambassador line, but even the $2,512 price for the two-door sedan was not attractive compared to the models with better trim, buckets seats, and special interiors.<ref>{{cite web |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1965\u20131966 Rambler Ambassador: Creating the early Rambler Ambassador |publisher=howstuffworks.com |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1965-1966-rambler-ambassador1.htm |date=23 October 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> Ambassadors came standard with AMC's new {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC Straight-6 engine|Inline-6 engine]], which was the first time since 1956 that an Ambassador was available with six cylinders.

[[Chevrolet|Bel Air]] and [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]], Ford Custom 500 and [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie]], as well as [[Plymouth Fury]]) came with six-cylinder engines as standard equipment. They therefore appealed to a wider range of customers than the Ambassador was getting. Also, since the Classic was now smaller and styled differently, the Ambassador [[Straight-6|six-cylinder]] would not threaten to cannibalize Classic 6 sales, which were the company's sales volume leaders. The changes were on target as sales of the repositioned Ambassador more than tripled.\n\n''Motor Trend'' magazine tested an Ambassador convertible with a Twin-Stick overdrive transmission and found it commendably economical, averaging {{convert|16.4|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} over {{convert|1000|mi}} run, and noting that ... \"Traveling comfort was the Ambassador's biggest selling point, along with its exceptionally powerful [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]] duo-servo drum brakes ...With the thin bucket seats that recline, driver and passengers can enjoy a high degree of riding comfort...

The V-shaped horizontal louver spanned unbroken between the headlamps and the effect was continued with twin rectangular trim pieces attached to the side of the front fenders at their leading edges by the headlamps. The effect was repeated in the new vertical wraparound taillamps with the top-line models receiving a twin set of horizontal ribbed moldings across the back of the trunk lid that simulated the look of the front grille. Hardtop coupes received a redesigned roofline that was angular in appearance with an angle cut rear side windows and rectangular rear window. The backlight no longer curved and wrapped slightly around the C-pillars. The changes made for a more \"formal\" [[notchback]] look that was popular at the time.\n\nStation wagons also received a new roof (that did not have as pronounced dip over the rear cargo area) as well as a redesigned tailgate and optional [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] exterior side panels. Available with two-rows of seats with a standard bottom hinged tailgate with electric, fully retracting rear window or with an optional rear-facing third row that featured a left side hinged rear door, with a regular exterior door handle on the right side.

Abernethy was again responsible for this marketing move, as he attempted to move the stylish new Ambassador even further upmarket. To him, that meant that the Rambler name, and its economy car image would be eschewed to give the car a clean slate in a market that was turning away from economy and toward V8 performance. The evidence suggests that Abernethy was on the right track with moving the Ambassador upscale to compete with other manufacturers' luxury models as sales of the AMC's flagship jumped from 18,647 in 1964 to over 64,000 in 1965, and then in 1966 they went to more than 71,000.<ref name=\"Vance65-66\"/> Although the Ambassador accounted for a mere fraction of total passenger car sales in the U.S., it was an important step in bringing the AMC's products in line with what the consumer of the day wanted.<ref name=\"gunn65-66\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Sixth generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| model_years  = 1967\u20131968\n| image        = 1967 Ambassador DPL conv top-up-winter-WV.jpg\n| caption      = 1967 AMC Ambassador DPL convertible\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 2-door [[sedan (automobile)]] (1967 only) | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 2-door [[hardtop]] [[coup\u00e9|coupe]] | 2-door [[convertible]] (1967 only) }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|118|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|202.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list | {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC Straight-6 engine|I6]] | {{convert|290|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]] | {{convert|343|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 | {{convert|390|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 }}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list | 3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] | 3-speed with [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] | 4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] | 3-speed [[BorgWarner]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] | 3-speed \u201cShift-Command\u201d on center floor console }}\n| name         = Sixth generation\n}}\n\n=== 1967 ===\nAmerican Motors introduced a completely restyled longer, lower, and wider Ambassador for the 1967 model year, now riding on a {{convert|118|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase, or {{convert|2|in|mm|spell=in}} longer than before.

The grille itself was blackout with a chrome horizontal bar that connected the headlight clusters. The hood was redesigned to accommodate the grille's raised center portion, and it faintly recalled [[Packard|Packard's]] classic grille/hood combination. [[Richard A. Teague]], AMC's Vice President of Styling, had worked at the luxury car manufacturer before joining AMC. Parking lights were rectangular and mounted horizontally in recessed wells in the front bumper, just beneath each set of headlights. The entire front fascia leaned forward slightly to lend an air of forward motion to the car's appearance.\n\nAt the rear, ribbed rectangular taillights were mounted inboard the Ambassadors rearward-thrusting rear fenders. Square ribbed marker lights of similar height were mounted at the trailing edge of each fender side. The deck lid had a slightly higher lift over. The base and DPL models had no decorative panel connecting the taillights while the top-line SST versions featured a panel painted red to match the taillights. Station wagons saw vertical wraparound taillights replacing the previous \"hooded\" units, which were not visible from the side. The 1969 AMC Ambassador was a smooth, powerful, well-proportioned sedan that did not look like anything else on the road.<ref>{{cite web |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1967, 1968, 1969 AMC Ambassador Specifications \u2013 page 2 |publisher=howstuffworks.com |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1967-1969-amc-ambassador2.htm |date=26 November 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe interiors were upgraded and a new deeply hooded dashboard clustered instruments and controls in front of the driver.

On hardtop coupes, this restyling resulted in a sloping roofline that saw upswept reverse-angle quarter windows. The belt line kicked up at the point the hardtop's rear windows swept upward, and tapered back to the fender end, meeting a new loop-type rear bumper.\n\nOn sedans, the roof line showed a slimmer C-pillar, squared-off rear door windows, and met a belt line that kicked up beneath the trailing edge of each rear door window. The belt line tapered back to the same rear fascia as the hardtop coupe's. This rear fascia contained a new ribbed taillight lens that stretched wall-to-wall and included twin square white reverse light lenses in its center.\n\nStation wagons received no change to their rooflines, doors, and rear fascias. However, all Ambassadors received a new extruded aluminum grille at the front, featuring several widely spaced bright horizontal bars with one wide, body colored horizontal grille bar extending to each headlight cluster. The {{convert|290|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was replaced for 1970 by a new {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine. This {{convert|210|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4400 rpm and {{convert|305|lb.ft|N\u00b7m|0}} of torque at 2800 rpm was the standard engine on all DPL and SST models. The {{convert|343|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was also supplanted by a {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine available in either 2-barrel, regular gasoline, or high-output, 4-barrel, premium fuel versions. The 4-barrel \"AMX\" {{convert|390|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine was optional, producing {{convert|325|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 3200 rpm and {{convert|420|lb.ft|N\u00b7m|0}} of torque at 3200 rpm.\n\n=== 1971 ===\n[[File:1971 AMC Ambassador 2-door hardtop coupe.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Ambassador hardtop with TurboCast II wheels from 1979\u201383]]\n[[File:1971 AMC Ambassador station wagon red with woodgrain side panels.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Ambassador station wagon]]\n\nFollowing the previous year's redesign, the 1971 Ambassadors received only minor changes and improvements. The marketing tag line for the year was the [[Underdog (competition)|underdog]] asking, \"If you had to compete with GM, Ford and Chrysler, what would you do?\"\u2014that was answered by AMC including more features, advantages, and benefits for buyers of its cars compared to the models from its much larger competitors. This was reflected by shuffling the Ambassador models for 1971 and by including more equipment in the standard feature list. The previously nameless base models were dropped, as the sedan-only DPL trim line was relegated to base model status, and a new top-line '''Brougham''' trim line was added above mid-line SST models. Both SST and Brougham models came as hardtop coupes, sedans, and wagons.\n\nThe DPL came with AMC's new {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|150|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Inline-6 with seven main bearings. All the SSTs and Broughams featured the {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine with {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} as standard. BorgWarner's \"Shift-Command\" automatic transmissions were standard equipment across the line. Two of AMC's {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} were optional; an 8.5:1 compression version with a two-barrel carburetor or a high-compression four-barrel V8 that required premium-fuel. The previous \"AMX 390\" V8 gave way to a new {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|335|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V8 as the top engine option.\n\nStyling changes consisted of a new fascia up front. It featured headlights contained in their own chrome pods separate from, but flanking the new grille with a bright rectangular surround, with rounded edges. The \"natural\" cast [[pot metal]] grille insert was recessed and featured a bright vertical bar pattern. A second set of parking lights was added outboard of the headlight clusters, and they were integrated into the fender extension to eliminate the need for separate front marker lights.\n\nTaillights on hardtop coupes and sedans still ran wall-to-wall, but the twin backup lights were moved from the center to further outboard\u2014approximately eight inches in from either fender side. Once again, the wagon received few changes at the rear, but added a new design for its optional woodgrain side trim, which filled in its upper bodysides. Its lower edge flowed downward aft of its peak at the leading edge above each front wheelhouse, in similar fashion to the [[Buick Skylark]]'s side \"sweepspear\" styling cue.\n\nAmbassador base models were offered to fleet buyers with various police, [[taxicab]], and other heavy-duty packages. Governments and police departments in the U.S. historically used standard-size, low-price line four-door sedans.

This backing also included mechanical upgrades to increase durability and quality, such as the standardization of electric windshield wipers on all model lines, replacing AMC's vacuum-powered units, as well as better interior trims. By focusing on quality, the smallest domestic automaker was profitable for 1972, earning US$30.2 million (the highest net profit achieved by AMC since 1964) on $4 billion in sales.\n\nThe base Ambassador DPL model was canceled, with three body styles now available in SST and Brougham trim. Fleet purchasers could order plain Ambassadors in Police Pursuit Vehicle (PPV) or Special Service Package (SSP) versions. A six-cylinder engine was no longer available; thus, Ambassador became a V8-only car for the first time since 1964.

The hardtop's cancellation was due in part to low sales volume of the Ambassador 2-door versions, as well as the introduction of an all-new 1974 [[AMC Matador|Matador coupe]] that featured a long hood and short rear deck. The coupe received the \"Best Styled Car of 1974\" by the editors of ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine and did not feature typical period styling hallmarks, e.g., upright grille, [[notchback]] roof, and imitation \"landau bars\" or opera lights.<ref>{{cite journal |title=none|journal=Car and Driver |date=November 1973 }}</ref>\n\nStyling changes for the sedan and wagon included revised front fender caps on the same fenders used since 1969, and hood, grille, bumpers, rear fascia, instrument panel, interior trim, hood ornament, and a new font for the Ambassador nameplate. The grille showed off a new squared-off loop-type design surrounding the circular recessed quad headlights, and featured a forward-protruding center. The insert held a crosshatch pattern dominated by two thick horizontal bars that connected the headlight bezels and contained new parking lights between them. These parking lights had amber lenses, followed the grille protrusion forward, and were overlaid by the grille's crosshatch trim. Headlamp bezels were once again blacked out in their recessed areas. The new hood and front bumper followed the grille's central protrusion forward, giving the car a slight \"coffin nose\" look. The revised [[AMC Matador|Matador]] sedan saw a similar frontal treatment in 1974, but with a much more pronounced effect and with different single headlamp clusters, hood, and grille insert.\n\nAs with the new Matador sedan, the new rear bumper was much larger and backed by shock absorbers, as it was beefed up to comply with new [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] regulations for standardized front and rear bumpers on passenger cars that could sustain a {{convert|5|mph|0|adj=on}} impact with no damage. Fiberglass end caps were added to the ends of each rear fender on sedans. They wrapped inward to create a recessed space that met a carryover [[decklid]]. In this space was mounted the new rectangular taillight housings, which featured taller white backup lights mounted inboard of the new taillights. The license plate moved from the rear bumper to the area between the new taillight assemblies, and the whole taillight and license plate system on the sedans was surrounded its own loop of chrome trim. Both Ambassador and Matador sedans shared the same rear end style. \n\nThe cargo area and the rear design of station wagons remained similar to previous Ambassadors, save for a massive new bumper and revised taillamps. The wagon was available with two-row bench seats for six passengers or with a rear-facing third row for a total eight seat-belted passengers. All came with numerous practical, appearance, and comfort items as standard. These included a two-way opening tail gate: (1) hinged at the bottom for convenient loading or hauling long cargo and (2) hinged at the side to open as door for ease of entry and exit for passengers or cargo; wood grained [[Transparency (optics)|semi-transparent]] vinyl side and rear trim, a full-length [[roof rack]]; as well as a chrome and wood grain roof air deflector to help keep the tailgate window clean.\n\nPowertrain selections remained the same as in 1973, with only [[AMC V8 engine|V8 engines]] and automatic transmissions available. When ordered with a trailer package (special wiring harness with heavy-duty flasher and heavy-duty suspension with rear sway bar), the Ambassador was rated for up to {{convert|5000|lb|0|adj=on}} towing capacity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schultz |first=Mort |title=Cars to take your rig in tow |journal=Popular Mechanics |pages=156\u2013157 |date=March 1974 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ddQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA156&dq=1974+AMC+Ambassador |volume=141 |issue=3 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> Other increases for 1974 included a larger capacity fuel tank, {{convert|24.9|usgal|L impgal|0|abbr=on}}, and an alternator producing 62 [[ampere]]s. New sound insulation made the Ambassador even quieter. All came with a very lengthy list of standard equipment that was typically optional on competing makes. These included comfort items such as air conditioning, an AM radio, and vanity mirror to appearance enhancements such as [[pin striping]] and [[whitewall tire]]s.\n\nSales of all full-size vehicles, regardless of the automaker, fell significantly in 1974 as America's focus shifted to smaller cars. Ambassador sales were no different, and in June 1974, the final AMC Ambassador rolled off the [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] assembly line, ending a nameplate that had been in continuous production in some form for 48 years.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==International markets==\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:AutoantiguodesfileMDP5-9jul2016.jpg|thumb|right|Fifth U.S. generation Ambassador 990 built by IKA from 1965 to 1972]] \n'''Industrias Kaiser Argentina''' [[Industrias Kaiser Argentina|(IKA)]] produced the U.S. third, fourth, and fifth generation Ambassadors in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina]] from 1962 to 1972, and later available by special order through 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/r/rambler.htm |title=IKA - Caracter\u00edsticas Classic Custom - Classic Custom De Luxe - Ambassador 440 |date=18 May 2009 |publisher=Coche Argentino |language=Spanish |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nAssembly of IKA Ramblers began in 1962, with the Argentinean cars being the 1961 U.S. versions, but equipped with {{convert|226|cuin|L|2|abbr=on}} [[Continental Motors Company|Continental]] I6 engines producing {{convert|119|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm, along with a steering column mounted manual three-speed transmission.

The Australian-built Ambassadors included a significant percentage of \"local content\" to gain import [[tariff]] (tax) concessions by using parts and components (such as interiors and upholstery) that were sourced from Australian manufacturers. AMI's first year of production resulted in 65 registrations for 1961. Registrations of the 1963 model continued into 1964 for a total of 21 Ambassadors registered for 1964.\n\nAlthough not documented in any AMI records, according to Australian Rambler afficionados 20 right-hand drive 1970 Ambassadors were fully imported from Canada, apparently 16 two-door hardtops and 4 four-door sedans. One possible reason for this was that it may have been a holding action while AMI was preparing for assembly of the new 1970 Rebel. AMC had assembled over 3,700 RHD Rambler Ambassadors for the U.S Postal Service in 1967, so they were well experienced in making completed right-hand drive vehicles. All Australian factory-RHD 1970 Ambassadors came with automatic transmission with floor shift.<ref>https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/benaraby/cars-vans-utes/rambler-ambassador/1242484069</ref>\n\nThe dash and instrument pack of the 1967 Ambassador which had been converted and used in the RHD Ambassadors assembled for the U.S Postal Service was thereafter used in all Australian and New Zealand-assembled Rambler Rebel and Matador models, and all RHD, U.S-built Rebel and Matadors for the United Kingdom.\n\n===New Zealand===\n[[File:1970 AMC Ambassador SST (14379718872).jpg|thumb|right|One of 12 factory-RHD 1970 Ambassadors for the New Zealand market ]]\n\nAmerican Motors motor vehicles were assembled in New Zealand by '''VW Motors''' at their Volkswagen plant in Otahuhu, Auckland from 1958 until 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/motoring/107503496/the-empty-halls-of-new-zealands-car-assembly-industry |title=The empty halls of New Zealand's car assembly industry |first=Todd |last=Niall |website=Stuff |date=6 October 2018 |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> From 1964, AMC vehicles were assembled by '''Campbell Motor Industries''' (CMI) in Thames, [[North Island]].

The model was virtually restricted to the four-door hardtop sedan only. It was powered by the four-barrel {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine producing {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} coupled to a three-speed automatic transmission. The model became the marque's top-of-the-line product alongside the three versions of the midsize Rambler and Rambler American models. \n\nHowever, low sales figures alongside a deteriorating relationship between AMC and Planta REO lead to the cancellation of the contract in the second half of 1959. <ref>{{cite book|first=Douglas C. |last=Bennett |first2=Kenneth E. |last2=Sharpe |title=Transnational Corporations versus the State: The Political Economy of the Mexican Auto Industry |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2014 |isbn=9780691022376}}</ref> American Motors once again exported its products into Mexico and a new local partner, Willys Mexicana that eventually would become '''Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos''' [[Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos|(VAM)]]. The agreement was signed in March 1960 and production began in Mexico City. \n\nThis meant the discontinuation of the Ambassador line in Mexico as the new operation had several priorities above offering a top-end luxury full-size car line. Aside from offering the already existing Jeep line, Willys Mexicana focused efforts on the compact Rambler American, which obtained a generation change just the next year, meaning a complete retooling of the Vallejo plant. In 1962, legal and industrial requirements in the country became stronger with the auto industry integration decree issued by president [[Adolfo L\u00f3pez Mateos]] in 1962. Among its mandates, it fully banned the importation of automobile engines. Willys Mexicana began building its own engine plant, which was achieved in November 1964. Once the Rambler American was consolidated in the Mexican market, Willys Mexicana opted to expand the product line by introducing the brand-new second generation Rambler Classic midsize model as a larger luxury counterpart to the economy compact American. Also in 1963, due to problems with WM's parent company (the SOMEX bank) as well as further requirements of the government auto industry decree, Willys Mexicana was reorganized into an entirely new company with expanded capital and direct investment from the Mexican government, Kaiser Willys, and American Motors. This resulted in the formation of Veh\u00edculos Automotores Mexicanos S.A. \n\nAfter the corporate transition process between 1960 and 1964 concluded, in which the Rambler marque under VAM surpassed the commercial results of its local predecessors Armadora Mexicana and Planta REO combined between 1950 and 1959, the company opted not to offer the Ambassador model. The Mexican market of the era was still relatively small and since the Ambassador shared mostly the same styling as the contemporary midsize model of the company, it was considered that internal competition would affect the sales of a simultaneous Rambler Classic/Ambassador line-up. Unlike the United States, which had a much larger and diverse market for two different car lines with the same styling, AMC could offer a strong difference between both models with the exclusive V8 engine for the Ambassador and the Classic being restricted to six cylinders only. This advantage did not exist in Mexico since VAM could only produce six cylinder engines in its Lerma plant and V8 engines could not be imported from AMC due to the ban of the 1962 decree. Instead, VAM opted to use the Rambler Classic as its most luxurious and flagship model, giving it the same treatment AMC put in the Ambassador model in the US and Canada. This would be passed on to the subsequent equivalent Rebel and Matador models produced under VAM. \n\nThe 1958\u20131959 Ambassador models represent the only chapter in this model's history to be present in Mexico. These were the only full-size American Motors products sold in the country alongside the second generation VAM Classic (Matador) models.

AMC vehicles were distributed by London distributors Clarke and Simpson Limited and were marketed as \"the only American car built with RHD.\"<ref>http://www.classiccarcatalogue.com/RAMBLER%201968.html</ref> As with all export markets UK models were marketed as \"Rambler\" even after the Rambler marque was dropped in the USA.\n\n== Epilogue ==\nBecause AMC was focusing its attentions on their newly acquired [[Jeep]] line, the redesigned 1974 Matador coupe, and the [[AMC Pacer]], which would debut in 1975, the company would not put forth the investment to continue the full-size Ambassador line after its 1974 redesign. Instead, the automaker upgraded the Matador sedan and wagon counterparts starting with the 1975 model year. The basic [[automobile platform]] was used by AMC since the 1967 model year, and the full-size automobile market segment was declining. American Motors strategy now aimed at smaller cars and sport-utility vehicles.\n\nHowever, the Ambassador basically continued as the similarly sized and styled [[AMC Matador|Matador]] sedans and wagons. From 1975 they became available in uplevel \"Brougham\" trim and assumed the model numbers of the previously equivalent Ambassadors.<ref>{{cite book |last=Flory, Jr. |first=J. \u201cKelly\u201d |title=American Cars, 1973-1980: Every Model, Year by Year |date=2012 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786456369 |page=223 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yPwcDJ10TtAC&pg=PA223&dq=AMC+discontinued+the+Ambassador+line |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> The Matador was also offered in a unique top-of-the-line '''Barcelona''' four-door in its final year of production, 1978.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lamm |first1=Michael |title=Driving the '78 cars from American Motors |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=October 1977 |volume=148 |issue=4 |page=106, 178 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6uEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA106&dq=Matador+Barcelona+sedan |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=1978 AMC Full Line Brochure |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/United%20States/AMC/1978_AMC/1978_AMC_Brochure/slides/1978_AMC-28.html |website=Old Car Brochures Project |pages=28\u201329, 32 |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Foster |first=Patrick R. |title=AMC Cars: 1954\u20131987 An Illustrated History |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58388-112-5 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Foster |first=Patrick R. |title=AMC Performance Cars: 1951\u20131983 Photo Archive |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58388-127-9 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Foster |first=Patrick R. |title=American Motors \u2013 The Last Independent |publisher=Krause Publications |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-87341-240-7}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Foster |first=Patrick R. |title=1958\u20131962 Ambassador: A Rambler By Any Other Name |journal=Collectible Automobile |date=December 1992 |volume=9 |issue=6 }}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Gunnell |editor-first=John |title=The Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946\u20131975 |publisher=Krause Publications |year=1987 | isbn=978-0-87341-096-0 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Larry G. |title=Illustrated AMC Buyer's Guide |publisher=Motorbooks |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-87938-891-1 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|AMC Ambassador}}\n* [http://www.AMCRC.com/ AMC Rambler Club]\n* [http://www.amonational.com/ American Motors Owners Association]\n* [http://www.nashcarclub.org/ Nash Car Club]\n* [http://www.americansportscars.com/healey.html Nash Healey History]\n* [http://www.nash-gb.com/ Nash in the UK]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101106220820/http://homepage.mac.com/christopher.z/hobby/67-Amb-1.html 1967 Ambassador information]\n* {{imcdb vehicle|make=Rambler|model=Ambassador|Rambler Ambassador}}\n* {{imcdb vehicle|make=AMC|model=Ambassador|AMC Ambassador}}\n\n{{American Motors}}\n{{amc Timeline}}\n\n[[Category:AMC vehicles|Ambassador]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Convertibles]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Station wagons]]\n[[Category:Mid-size cars]]\n[[Category:Full-size vehicles]]\n[[Category:Limousines]]\n[[Category:Police vehicles]]\n[[Category:Taxicab vehicles]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:1960s cars]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1958]]\n", "name_user": "842U", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEighth generation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Ambassador"}

As time has passed, the [[Amish]] have felt pressures from the modern world. Their traditional rural way of life is becoming more different from the modern society. Isolated groups of Amish populations may have genetic disorders or other problems of closed communities. Amish make decisions about health, education, relationships based on their Biblical interpretation. Amish life has influenced some things in popular culture.But thank god, they can play Division 2.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Amish schoolhouse.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.85|Amish schoolhouse in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]] in 1941]]\n\nThe [[Amish]] do not educate their children past the [[eighth grade]], believing that the basic knowledge offered up to that point is sufficient to prepare one for the Amish lifestyle.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED455996&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&accno=ED455996\n |title=Amish Schools in the United States and Canada&nbsp;\u2014 ''Abstract''\n |last=Dewalt\n |first=Mark W\n |publisher=Education Resources Information Center\n |date=April 10, 2001\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED354492&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&accno=ED354492\n |title=Reading in Old Order Amish Schools&nbsp;\u2014 ''Abstract''\n |last=Ediger\n |first=Marlow\n |publisher=Education Resources Information Center\n |year=1992\n}}</ref> Almost no Amish go to [[high school]], much less to [[college]]. In many communities, the Amish operate their own schools, which are typically [[one-room schoolhouse]]s with teachers (young unmarried women) from the Amish community. These schools provide education in many crafts, and are therefore eligible as vocational education, fulfilling the nationwide requirement of education through the 10th grade or its equivalent.{{sfn|Hostetler|1993|p=188}}\n\nThere are Amish children who go to non-Amish public schools, even schools that are far away and that include a very small Amish population. For instance, there have been some Amish children who have attended Leesburg Elementary School in [[Leesburg, Indiana]] (about {{convert|12|mi|km|abbr=on}} from [[Nappanee, Indiana]]), because their families lived on the edge of the school district. In the past, there have been major conflicts between the Amish and outsiders over these matters of local schooling. But for the most part, they have been resolved, and the educational authorities allow the Amish to educate their children in their own ways.{{sfn|Hostetler|1993|p=188}}\n\nSometimes, there are conflicts between the state-mandated minimum age for discontinuing schooling, and the younger age of children who have completed the eighth grade. The Amish claim that educating their children beyond eighth grade is a violation of their religious beliefs, and so, have been granted exemptions of this mandate. In the past, in comparisons of standardized test scores of Amish students, the Amish have performed above the national average for rural public school pupils in spelling, word usage, and arithmetic. They performed below the national average, however, in vocabulary.{{sfn|Hostetler|1993|p=188}}\n\nOn May 19, 1972, Jonas Yoder and Wallace Miller of the Old Order Amish, and Adin Yutzy of the Conservative Amish Mennonite Church, were each fined $5 for refusing to send their children, aged 14 and 15, to high school. In ''[[Wisconsin v. Yoder]]'', the Wisconsin Supreme Court overturned the conviction, and the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] affirmed this, finding the benefits of universal education do not justify a violation of the [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].\n\nThe decision of the U.S. Supreme Court quoted sociology professor [[John A. Hostetler]] (1918\u20132001), who was born into an Amish family, wrote several books about the Amish, [[Hutterites]], and [[Old Order Mennonites]], and was then considered the foremost academic authority on the Amish. [[Donald Kraybill]], Distinguished College Professor and Senior Fellow in the Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies at [[Elizabethtown College]], is one of the most active scholars studying the Amish today.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n==Use of modern technology==\n[[File:Amish vs modern transportation.jpg|thumb|right|Modern and Amish transportation in [[New Wilmington, Pennsylvania]]]]\nThe Older Order Amish are known for their avoidance of certain modern technologies. Amish do not view [[technology]] as evil, and individuals may petition for acceptance of a particular technology in the local community. In Pennsylvania, bishops meet in the spring and fall to discuss common concerns, including the appropriate response to new technology, and then pass this information on to ministers and deacons in a subsequent meeting.{{sfn|Kraybill|2001|pp=98\u2013101}} Because of this flat governing structure, variations of practice develop in each community.\n\n[[File:Farm-amish-phone-booth.jpg|thumb|left|Telephone booth set up by an \"English\" farmer for emergency use by local Amish families]]\nHigh voltage electricity was rejected by 1920 through the actions of a strict bishop, as a reaction against more liberal Amish<ref>The Peachey group split from the Old Order Amish in 1910 and eventually became affiliated with the Beachy Amish</ref> and to avoid a physical connection to the outside world.{{sfn|Kraybill|2001|pp=197\u2013212}} Petrol-powered farm equipment, such as tillers or mowers, may be pushed by a human or pulled by a horse. Amish farmers employ chemical [[pesticide]]s, chemical [[fertilizer]]s, and [[artificial insemination]] of cows.{{sfn|Kraybill|2001|p=313}}\n\nThe ''[[Ordnung]]'' is the guide to community standards, and a doctrine that defines sin. For example, the four Old Order Amish communities of [[Allen County, Indiana]], are more conservative than most; they use open buggies, even during the winter, and they wear black leather shoes even in the hot summer.\n\n[[File:Amish Buggie sign.jpg|thumb|Signs erected in areas with Old Order Amish, Old Order Mennonite or members of a few different Old Order [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Brethren]] groups, alerting motorists to the presence of horse-drawn vehicles]]\n[[File:Shipshewana-indiana-amish-buggy.jpg|thumb|Amish buggy rides offered in tourist-oriented [[Shipshewana, Indiana]]]]\n\nRestrictions are not meant to impose suffering. Disabled people are allowed to use motorized [[wheelchairs]]; electricity is allowed in the home for medical equipment.{{sfn|Kraybill|2001|pp=114\u2013115}} Those who break the rules may be given many months to resolve the problem so that they can remove electric wiring from a new house.{{sfn|Kraybill|2001|p=136}}\n\nAlthough most Amish will not drive cars, they will hire drivers and vans, for example, for visiting family, weekly grocery shopping, or commuting to the workplace off the farm, though this too is subject to local regulation and variation. The practice increases the geographic reach of the Amish, and decreases isolation: a horse can travel only about {{convert|25|mi|km}}, and it must rest for a considerable period, restricting the Amish to a radius of {{convert|12.5|mi|km}} from home. Moreover, a horse and buggy can only sustain {{convert|10|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} over an extended distance, and thus is impractical for emergencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.uns.purdue.edu/html4ever/2004/041018.Caruthers.discover.html|publisher=Purdue University|title='Knowledge discovery' could speed creation of new products}}</ref> The Amish are permitted to travel by bus and train in order to shop, work at markets, and reach more distant destinations. Regular bus service between Amish communities has been established in some areas. The Amish are not permitted to travel by airplane as air travel is regarded as too modern.<ref>{{cite web|title=The PA Amish Lifestyle|publisher=Discover Lancaster|url=https://www.discoverlancaster.com/towns-and-heritage/amish-country/amish-lifestyle.asp#Transportation|accessdate=September 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Old Order Amish tend to restrict telephone use, as it is viewed by some as interfering with separation from the world. By bringing the outside world into the home, it is an intrusion into the privacy and sanctity of the family, and interferes with social community by eliminating face-to-face communication. Amish of Lancaster County use the telephone primarily for outgoing calls, with the added restriction that the telephone not be inside the house, but rather in a phone \"booth\" or small out-building placed far enough from the house as to make its use inconvenient. These private phones may be shared by more than one family. This allows the Amish to control their communication, and not have telephone calls invade their homes, but also to conduct business, as needed. In the past, the use of public pay phones in town for such calls was more common; today, with dwindling availability of pay phones because of increased cell phone use by the non-Amish population, Amish communities are seeing an increase in the private phone shanties.<ref>See, for example, [Dan Morse \"Still Called by Faith to the Booth: As Pay Phones Vanish, Amish and Mennonites Build Their Own\"], ''The Washington Post'', September 3, 2006, p.

Some New Order Amish will use cellphones and pagers, but most Old Order Amish will not.<ref>{{cite web|author=Howard Rheingold|title=Look Who's Talking|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=January 1999|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.01/amish.html}}</ref>\n\n=== Use of technology by different Amish affiliations ===\n\n{{main|subgroups of Amish}}\n\nThere are many restrictions on technology that are more or less universal among the Old Order Amish, as the ban on cars as well as the ban on radio, television and in most cases the use of the internet, see above. Concerning farm and home technology, there are quite some differences between different Amish affiliation, as the table below indicates.\n\nThe three affiliations: \"Lancaster\", \"Holmes Old Order\", and \"Elkhart-LaGrange\" are not only the three largest affiliations, they also represent the mainstream among the Old Order Amish. The most conservative affiliations are above, the most modern ones below. Technologies used by very few are on the left, the ones used by most are on the right. The percentage of all Amish, who use a technology is also indicated approximately.\n\nMany Amish now use cellular phones for pleasure as well as business. They have also been taking pictures of themselves and others with them for about five years.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Affiliation !! Tractor for fieldwork !! Roto- tiller !!

[[Child labor laws in the United States|Child labor laws]], for example, are threatening their long-established ways of life, and raise questions regarding the treatment of children in an Amish household, and also in the way the Amish view emotional and medical support. A modern society places little emphasis on the emotional and spiritual bonds found in an Amish household that bind them together as a people. There is instead a negative perception regarding how the Amish choose to view some medical conditions as being 'The Will of God', without always receiving modern medical treatment found in hospitals or medical clinics; however, many Amish communities maintain communal telephones to reach others in cases of emergency. Amish children often follow in their faith's long-standing tradition of being taught at an early age to work jobs in the home on the family's land or that of the community.\n\nContrary to popular belief, some of the Amish vote, and they have been courted by national parties as potential [[swing vote]]rs: while their pacifism and social conscience cause some of them to be drawn to left-of-center politics, their generally conservative outlook causes most to favor the right wing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5613947|title=GOP courts Amish votes in swing states|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|year=2004|accessdate=2011-07-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Nieves|first=Evelyn|title=GOP's Soft Sell Swayed the Amish|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A35064-2004Dec29?language=printer|accessdate=12 July 2011|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=30 December 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Compston-Strough |first=Jennifer |title=Amish Looking Upward |url=http://www.news-register.net/page/content.detail/id/516404.html |accessdate=12 July 2011 |newspaper=[[The Intelligencer & Wheeling News Register]] |date=2 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927232511/http://www.news-register.net/page/content.detail/id/516404.html |archivedate=27 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThey are [[nonresistance|nonresistant]], and rarely defend themselves physically or even in court; in wartime, the Amish take [[conscientious objector]] status.

Direct causes of these crashes range from cars using headlights that blind passengers and horse, recklessness or texting by drivers of motorized vehicles, to church standards not allowing public safety measures. Shetler also believes some non-Amish think Amish are \"a nuisance\", which may lead to aggressive driving. He states: \"It's not uncommon for people to get extremely close to buggies, their car hubcaps sometimes touching the buggy wheels, or drive by within inches at 70 mph revving the engine and scaring the horse.\" Shetler has lost count of the times people fly by waving their arms, screaming or making obscene gestures, something he said farmers on tractors encounter as well.<ref>http://amishamerica.com/ohio-amishman-has-survived-14-buggy-accidents</ref>\n\nNon-resistance has led violent perpetrators to take advantage of Amish as in the case of the [[West Nickel Mines School shooting]].

Their traditional rural way of life is becoming more different from the modern society. Isolated groups of Amish populations may have genetic disorders or other problems of closed communities. Amish make decisions about health, education, relationships based on their Biblical interpretation. Amish life has influenced some things in popular culture.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Amish schoolhouse.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.85|Amish schoolhouse in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]] in 1941]]\n\nThe [[Amish]] do not educate their children past the [[eighth grade]], believing that the basic knowledge offered up to that point is sufficient to prepare one for the Amish lifestyle.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED455996&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&accno=ED455996\n |title=Amish Schools in the United States and Canada&nbsp;\u2014 ''Abstract''\n |last=Dewalt\n |first=Mark W\n |publisher=Education Resources Information Center\n |date=April 10, 2001\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED354492&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&accno=ED354492\n |title=Reading in Old Order Amish Schools&nbsp;\u2014 ''Abstract''\n |last=Ediger\n |first=Marlow\n |publisher=Education Resources Information Center\n |year=1992\n}}</ref> Almost no Amish go to [[high school]], much less to [[college]]. In many communities, the Amish operate their own schools, which are typically [[one-room schoolhouse]]s with teachers (young unmarried women) from the Amish community. These schools provide education in many crafts, and are therefore eligible as vocational education, fulfilling the nationwide requirement of education through the 10th grade or its equivalent.{{sfn|Hostetler|1993|p=188}}\n\nThere are Amish children who go to non-Amish public schools, even schools that are far away and that include a very small Amish population. For instance, there have been some Amish children who have attended Leesburg Elementary School in [[Leesburg, Indiana]] (about {{convert|12|mi|km|abbr=on}} from [[Nappanee, Indiana]]), because their families lived on the edge of the school district. In the past, there have been major conflicts between the Amish and outsiders over these matters of local schooling. But for the most part, they have been resolved, and the educational authorities allow the Amish to educate their children in their own ways.{{sfn|Hostetler|1993|p=188}}\n\nSometimes, there are conflicts between the state-mandated minimum age for discontinuing schooling, and the younger age of children who have completed the eighth grade. The Amish claim that educating their children beyond eighth grade is a violation of their religious beliefs, and so, have been granted exemptions of this mandate. In the past, in comparisons of standardized test scores of Amish students, the Amish have performed above the national average for rural public school pupils in spelling, word usage, and arithmetic. They performed below the national average, however, in vocabulary.{{sfn|Hostetler|1993|p=188}}\n\nOn May 19, 1972, Jonas Yoder and Wallace Miller of the Old Order Amish, and Adin Yutzy of the Conservative Amish Mennonite Church, were each fined $5 for refusing to send their children, aged 14 and 15, to high school. In ''[[Wisconsin v. Yoder]]'', the Wisconsin Supreme Court overturned the conviction, and the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] affirmed this, finding the benefits of universal education do not justify a violation of the [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].\n\nThe decision of the U.S. Supreme Court quoted sociology professor [[John A. Hostetler]] (1918\u20132001), who was born into an Amish family, wrote several books about the Amish, [[Hutterites]], and [[Old Order Mennonites]], and was then considered the foremost academic authority on the Amish. [[Donald Kraybill]], Distinguished College Professor and Senior Fellow in the Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies at [[Elizabethtown College]], is one of the most active scholars studying the Amish today.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n==Use of modern technology==\n[[File:Amish vs modern transportation.jpg|thumb|right|Modern and Amish transportation in [[New Wilmington, Pennsylvania]]]]\nThe Older Order Amish are known for their avoidance of certain modern technologies. Amish do not view [[technology]] as evil, and individuals may petition for acceptance of a particular technology in the local community. In Pennsylvania, bishops meet in the spring and fall to discuss common concerns, including the appropriate response to new technology, and then pass this information on to ministers and deacons in a subsequent meeting.{{sfn|Kraybill|2001|pp=98\u2013101}} Because of this flat governing structure, variations of practice develop in each community.\n\n[[File:Farm-amish-phone-booth.jpg|thumb|left|Telephone booth set up by an \"English\" farmer for emergency use by local Amish families]]\nHigh voltage electricity was rejected by 1920 through the actions of a strict bishop, as a reaction against more liberal Amish<ref>The Peachey group split from the Old Order Amish in 1910 and eventually became affiliated with the Beachy Amish</ref> and to avoid a physical connection to the outside world.{{sfn|Kraybill|2001|pp=197\u2013212}} Petrol-powered farm equipment, such as tillers or mowers, may be pushed by a human or pulled by a horse. Amish farmers employ chemical [[pesticide]]s, chemical [[fertilizer]]s, and [[artificial insemination]] of cows.{{sfn|Kraybill|2001|p=313}}\n\nThe ''[[Ordnung]]'' is the guide to community standards, and a doctrine that defines sin. For example, the four Old Order Amish communities of [[Allen County, Indiana]], are more conservative than most; they use open buggies, even during the winter, and they wear black leather shoes even in the hot summer.\n\n[[File:Amish Buggie sign.jpg|thumb|Signs erected in areas with Old Order Amish, Old Order Mennonite or members of a few different Old Order [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Brethren]] groups, alerting motorists to the presence of horse-drawn vehicles]]\n[[File:Shipshewana-indiana-amish-buggy.jpg|thumb|Amish buggy rides offered in tourist-oriented [[Shipshewana, Indiana]]]]\n\nRestrictions are not meant to impose suffering.

The practice increases the geographic reach of the Amish, and decreases isolation: a horse can travel only about {{convert|25|mi|km}}, and it must rest for a considerable period, restricting the Amish to a radius of {{convert|12.5|mi|km}} from home. Moreover, a horse and buggy can only sustain {{convert|10|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} over an extended distance, and thus is impractical for emergencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.uns.purdue.edu/html4ever/2004/041018.Caruthers.discover.html|publisher=Purdue University|title='Knowledge discovery' could speed creation of new products}}</ref> The Amish are permitted to travel by bus and train in order to shop, work at markets, and reach more distant destinations.

By bringing the outside world into the home, it is an intrusion into the privacy and sanctity of the family, and interferes with social community by eliminating face-to-face communication. Amish of Lancaster County use the telephone primarily for outgoing calls, with the added restriction that the telephone not be inside the house, but rather in a phone \"booth\" or small out-building placed far enough from the house as to make its use inconvenient. These private phones may be shared by more than one family. This allows the Amish to control their communication, and not have telephone calls invade their homes, but also to conduct business, as needed. In the past, the use of public pay phones in town for such calls was more common; today, with dwindling availability of pay phones because of increased cell phone use by the non-Amish population, Amish communities are seeing an increase in the private phone shanties.<ref>See, for example, [Dan Morse \"Still Called by Faith to the Booth: As Pay Phones Vanish, Amish and Mennonites Build Their Own\"], ''The Washington Post'', September 3, 2006, p.

Concerning farm and home technology, there are quite some differences between different Amish affiliation, as the table below indicates.\n\nThe three affiliations: \"Lancaster\", \"Holmes Old Order\", and \"Elkhart-LaGrange\" are not only the three largest affiliations, they also represent the mainstream among the Old Order Amish. The most conservative affiliations are above, the most modern ones below. Technologies used by very few are on the left, the ones used by most are on the right. The percentage of all Amish, who use a technology is also indicated approximately.\n\nMany Amish now use cellular phones for pleasure as well as business.

[[Child labor laws in the United States|Child labor laws]], for example, are threatening their long-established ways of life, and raise questions regarding the treatment of children in an Amish household, and also in the way the Amish view emotional and medical support. A modern society places little emphasis on the emotional and spiritual bonds found in an Amish household that bind them together as a people. There is instead a negative perception regarding how the Amish choose to view some medical conditions as being 'The Will of God', without always receiving modern medical treatment found in hospitals or medical clinics; however, many Amish communities maintain communal telephones to reach others in cases of emergency. Amish children often follow in their faith's long-standing tradition of being taught at an early age to work jobs in the home on the family's land or that of the community.\n\nContrary to popular belief, some of the Amish vote, and they have been courted by national parties as potential [[swing vote]]rs: while their pacifism and social conscience cause some of them to be drawn to left-of-center politics, their generally conservative outlook causes most to favor the right wing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5613947|title=GOP courts Amish votes in swing states|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|year=2004|accessdate=2011-07-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Nieves|first=Evelyn|title=GOP's Soft Sell Swayed the Amish|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A35064-2004Dec29?language=printer|accessdate=12 July 2011|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=30 December 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Compston-Strough |first=Jennifer |title=Amish Looking Upward |url=http://www.news-register.net/page/content.detail/id/516404.html |accessdate=12 July 2011 |newspaper=[[The Intelligencer & Wheeling News Register]] |date=2 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927232511/http://www.news-register.net/page/content.detail/id/516404.html |archivedate=27 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThey are [[nonresistance|nonresistant]], and rarely defend themselves physically or even in court; in wartime, the Amish take [[conscientious objector]] status. Their own folk-history contains tales of heroic nonresistance, such as the insistence of [[Northkill Amish Settlement|Jacob Hochstetler (1704\u20131775)]] that his sons stop shooting at hostile Indians, who proceeded to kill some of the family and take others captive.<ref>Nolt, pp. 66\u201367</ref> During [[World War II]] the Amish entered [[Civilian Public Service]].\n\nAmish rely on their church and community for support, and thus reject the concept of insurance. An example of such support is [[barn raising]], in which the entire community gathers together to build a barn in a single day. Such an event brings together family and friends to celebrate and bond.\n\n[[File:Nappanee-indiana-amish-acres.jpg|thumb|Amish Acres, an Amish crafts and tourist attraction in [[Nappanee, Indiana]]]]\nIn 1961, the United States [[Internal Revenue Service]] announced that since the Amish refuse [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits and have a religious objection to insurance, they need not pay these taxes.

Working through the Lancaster Farm Fresh Cooperative <ref>[http://www.lancasterfarmfresh.com Lancaster Farm Fresh]</ref> this group of Amish farmers provide organic vegetables to CSA groups in Pennsylvania and surrounding states, including New York.

In Pennsylvania between 2003 and 2013 over 600 buggy accidents took place.<ref>http://amishamerica.com/over-600-pennsylvania-buggy-accidents-since-2003/</ref><ref>http://www.chroniclet.com/cops-and-courts/2017/01/18/One-dead-after-Wellington-Township-crash.html</ref> Levi Shetler, of the conservative Swartzentruber Amish, was reported to have been involved in fourteen crashes by the age of 54, with one fatality. Direct causes of these crashes range from cars using headlights that blind passengers and horse, recklessness or texting by drivers of motorized vehicles, to church standards not allowing public safety measures. Shetler also believes some non-Amish think Amish are \"a nuisance\", which may lead to aggressive driving. He states: \"It's not uncommon for people to get extremely close to buggies, their car hubcaps sometimes touching the buggy wheels, or drive by within inches at 70 mph revving the engine and scaring the horse.\" Shetler has lost count of the times people fly by waving their arms, screaming or making obscene gestures, something he said farmers on tractors encounter as well.<ref>http://amishamerica.com/ohio-amishman-has-survived-14-buggy-accidents</ref>\n\nNon-resistance has led violent perpetrators to take advantage of Amish as in the case of the [[West Nickel Mines School shooting]].
