Temperature increase becomes relevant for relatively small-cross-sections wires, where it may affect normal semiconductor behavior. Besides, since the generation of heat is proportional to the frequency of operation for switching circuits, fast computers have larger heat generation than slow ones, an undesired effect for chips manufacturers.

The goal is to find the temperature distribution on the top surface. The top surface is discretized into smaller squares with index i=1...N.

The most popular methods are: [[Finite-difference time-domain method|Finite difference time-domain (FDTD) method]], [[Finite element method]] (FEM) and method of moments (MoM).\n\nThe finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is a robust and popular technique that consists in solving differential equations numerically as well as certain boundary conditions defined by the problem. This is done by discretizing the space and time, and using finite differencing formulas, thus the partial differential equations that describe the physics of the problem can be solved numerically by computer programs.\n \nThe FEM is also a numerical scheme employed to solve engineering and mathematical problems described by differential equations as well as boundary conditions. It discretizes the space into smaller elements for which basis functions are assigned to their nodes or edges. Basis functions are linear or higher order polynomials. Applying the differential equation and the boundary conditions of the problem to the basis functions, a system of equations is formulated using either the [[Ritz method|Ritz]] or [[Galerkin method]]. Finally, a direct or iterative method is employed to solve the system of linear equations.<ref name=\"jin\">J.-M. Jin, The Finite Element Method in Electromagnetics. New York: Wiley, 2nd ed., 2002</ref> For the thermal case, FEM method is more suitable due to the nonlinearity nature of the thermal properties.\n\n====Example====\nThe previous example can be solved with a numerical method. For this case, the cube can by discretized into rectangular elements. Its basis functions can be chosen to be a first order approximation (linear):\n\n<math> N_{i}^{e}=\\frac{1}{2}\\xi\\left(1\\mp\\zeta\\right),\\qquad i=1,4 </math>\n\n<math> N_{i}^{e}=\\frac{1}{2}\\eta\\left(1\\mp\\zeta\\right),\\qquad i=2,5 </math>\n\n<math> N_{i}^{e}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\xi-\\eta\\right)\\left(1\\mp\\zeta\\right),\\qquad i=3,6 </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\zeta=2(z-z_{c})/h_{z} </math>. If <math>z_{c}=0</math>, then <math>\\zeta=2z/h_{z}</math>.\n\nUsing this basis functions and after applying Galerkin's method to the heat transfer equation, a matrix equation is obtained:\n\n<math> \\left[S\\right]\\left\\{ \\theta\\right\\} +\\left[R\\right]\\frac{d}{dt}\\left\\{ \\theta\\right\\} =\\left\\{ B\\right\\} </math>\n\nwhere,\n\n: <math> R_{ij}=\\int_{v}N_{j} N_{i}dV </math>\n\n: <math> S_{ij}=k\\int_{v}\\nabla N_{j}.\\nabla N_{i}dV </math>\n\n: <math> B_{i}=\\frac{k}{\\kappa_{s}}\\int_{\\Omega_{1}}N_{i}p(x,y)d\\Omega+\\frac{k}{\\kappa_{s}}\\int_{v}N_{i}gdV-kT_{o}\\sum_{j=0}^{N_{D}}\\int_{v}\\nabla N_{j}^{D}.\\nabla N_{i}dV</math>.\n\nThis expressions can be evaluated by using a simple FEM code. For more details, please see.<ref name=\"jin\"/> The figure below shows the temperature distribution for the numerical solution case. This solution shows very good agreement with the analytical case, its peak also reaches 390 K at the center. The apparent lack of smoothness of the distribution comes from the first order approximation of the basis functions and this can be solved by using higher order basis functions. Also, better results might be obtained by employing a denser mesh of the structure; however, for very dense meshes the computation time increases a lot, making the simulation non-practical.\n\nThe next figure shows a comparison of the peak temperature as a function of time for both methods. The system reaches steady state in approximately <math>1 ms</math>.\n\n<center>\n[[File:Analithic&FEM1.PNG|400px]]\n</center>\n\n===Model order reduction===\nThe numerical methods such as FEM or FDM derive a matrix equation as shown in the previous section. To solve this equation faster, a method called [[Model order reduction]] can be employed to find an approximation of lower order. This method is based on the fact that a high-dimensional state vector belongs to a low-dimensional subspace [http://modelreduction.com/ModelReduction/].\n\nFigure below shows the concept of the MOR approximation: finding matrix V, the dimension of the system can be reduced to solve a simplified system. \n<center>\n[[File:DiagramMOR2.png|400px]]\n</center>\n\nTherefore, the original system of equation:\n\n: <math>C\\left\\{ x\\right\\} '+K\\left\\{ x\\right\\} =F\\left\\{ u\\right\\}</math>\n\nbecomes:\n\n: <math>V^{T}CV\\left\\{ z\\right\\} '+V^{T}KV\\left\\{ z\\right\\} =V^{T}F\\left\\{ u\\right\\}</math>\n\nWhose order is much lower than the original making the computation much less expensive. Once the solution is obtained, the original vector is found by taking the product with V.\n\n==Conclusion==\nThe generation of heat is mainly produced by joule heating, this undesired effect has limited the performance of integrated circuits. In the preset article heat conduction was described and analytical and numerical methods to solve a heat transfer problem were presented. Using these methods, steady state temperature distribution was computed as well as the peak temperature as a function of time for a cubic die. For an input power of <math>0.3 W </math> (or <math> 3.333e8 W/m_{2} </math>) applied over a single surface source on the top of a cubic die a peak increment of temperature in the order of 100 K was computed. Such increase in temperature can affect the behavior of surrounding semiconductor devices. Important parameters like mobility change drastically. That is why the heat dissipation is a relevant issue and must be considered for circuit designing.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Heat generation in integrated circuits]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thermal Simulations For Integrated Circuits}}\n[[Category:Integrated circuits]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2013}}\nMiniaturizing components has always been a primary goal in the [[semiconductor]] industry because it cuts production cost and lets companies build smaller computers and other devices.

He is the former leader of the Oakland [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#Mayans|Mayans]], a [[Mexican-American]] outlaw motorcycle club.\n\n==Biography==\n\u00c1lvarez, who is of [[Mexican American|Mexican descent]], is the President of the [[Mayans Motorcycle Club's [[Oakland, California]] chapter and seems to be their national president. His son, [[List of characters from Sons of Anarchy#Esai \u00c1lvarez|Esai]], was also a member of the club but had a hit placed on him by Marcus in 2008 as punishment for failing his mission. Most of his, and his gang's, income is made through dealing [[heroin]] and [[methamphetamine]], and [[prostitution]]. For some time, he was a [[Incarceration|prisoner]] in [[California Institution for Men|Chino]], but was released some time before the beginning of Season One.\n\nOn his [[gang colors|colors]], he wears patches reading \"Los Asesinos de Dios\" ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for \"God's Assassins\") and \"Mayans Oakland\". However, his \"President\" patch is later changed to \"El Padrino\". He also has the [[Mayan Calendar]] tattooed on his chest.\n\n===Sons of Anarchy===\n====Season 1====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 1)}}\nAt the beginning of the first series, Marcus \u00c1lvarez and other members of the Mayans MC, broke into the Sons of Anarchy's weapons warehouse. The Mayans stole the guns; then they torched the warehouse. The Sons of Anarchy eventually got revenge, however, by stealing the guns back and destroying a Mayans narcotics storage facility.\n\n[[Ernest Darby]], leader of the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#Nordics|Nordics]] (after being supplied with a dossier containing all the details required to take over SAMCRO'S gun business, by a rogue ATF agent), calls a meeting with \u00c1lvarez. During their meeting, Darby proposes the Nords & Mayans further their present alliance. Darby's deal requires the Mayans first assassinate SAMCRO's President, followed by the rest of its members, with the spoils to be divided as follows: Darby's Nords get Charming (freeing them to expand their meth trade into the city). \u00c1lvarez and the Mayans (using the ATF dossier to be supplied by Darby, post-assassination) get to take over SAMCRO's lucrative gun business, utilize their newfound control of the gun trade to expand their heroin business & eliminate a longtime rival MC. \u00c1lvarez, recognizing an opportunity, reluctantly agrees in principle, but demurs on the Mayans eliminating SAMCRO requirement, instead suggesting a more joint effort, with the Mayans increasing their current security & support of the Nords power plays. Darby, sensing \u00c1lvarez knows the deal is too good to pass up, reiterates his initial demands, and exits the meeting - his \"take it or leave it\" ball placed squarely in \u00c1lvarez's court. With Darby now out of earshot, \u00c1lvarez immediately gives two orders: kill SAMCRO's President, and double-cross Darby by murdering him & taking the ATF dossier for themselves. \u00c1lvarez's son requests he & his crew be tasked with carrying out both orders - a request \u00c1lvarez grants.\n\nLater, the Mayans carry out simultaneous hits on both Darby & the SAMCRO President. However, both hits go sideways for the Mayans. The Mayans hit Darby at his home, killing 2 women & 1 Nord henchman, but missing Darby. Although they fail to kill Darby, they do manage to steal the ATF dossier. During the hit on SAMCRO President, Clay Morrow, the Mayans  find themselves outnumbered, as Clay & Tig are making a deal with the IRA at a bar - all of whom fight off & kill the Mayans, while suffering only one wounded in the process.\n\nThe failed hit generates two reactions. First, Clay orders the #1 & #2 members of every SOA charter between Charming to Tacoma to report to Charming ASAP. Second, Charming PD bring Clay in for questioning about the shootings. At his questioning, Clay asks his associate and corrupt Charming Police Chief [[Wayne Unser]] to allow him to have a \"little chat\" with Darby (who is already in Charming PD lockup) & to bring \u00c1lvarez in under similar pretenses, also holding him in Charming lockup, so they can hold a summit of sorts, to potentially curtail any further SOA-Mayan violence. Also during Clay's questioning a large group of SOA members (every charter's #1 & #2 from as far away as Tacoma) roars past Charming PD headquarters, in full view of both Clay & Unser. This show of gunboat diplomacy, sways Unser to acquiesce to Clay's summit request.\n\nGiven the green light by Unser, Clay first chats with Darby in his jail cell. Essentially imposing his will upon Darby via several powerful punches to the head, Clay forces Darby to submit.\n\nNext, \u00c1lvarez is brought in & locked up in a cell with Clay. Clay outlines an agreement where SAMCRO will sell weapons to the Mayans, in exchange for settling all SOA-Mayan disputes, across all charters, in favour of SOA, regardless of the cost to the Mayans - including the failed Mayan hit on Clay himself. \u00c1lvarez agrees to all terms, including recompense for the botched hit.\n\nClay then takes this tentative agreement to the club for a vote. All members vote unanimously to ratify the agreement charter-wide. MC members further decide justice for the hit on Clay should be carried out by Happy, as he is a member of a non-SAMCRO SOA charter.\n\nLater, during an idyllic looking, sunny California Sunday afternoon, \u00c1lvarez & his son Esai, share what briefly presents as a warm, sage-like, father-son moment in the park: Esai seeks reassurance for his shortcomings from his father. \u00c1lvarez cryptically reassures his son - and then leads him right over to the churro vendor (actually Happy in disguise), who expertly inserts a blade into the back of Esai's brain, killing him instantly, as \u00c1lvarez upholds his end of the bargain with a shocking demonstration of MC sobre sangre.\n\n \nWhen the Mayans eventually set up a deal with the Sons in Oakland, it was attacked by the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#One-Niners|One-Niners]]. A shoot-out ensued, and gang members from the One-Niners and Mayans were killed, but the Sons of Anarchy escaped. \u00c1lvarez was also shot in the leg and wounded. The deal was, in fact, a set-up organized by the Niners and SOA. The Niners were supposed to attack the Mayans after the Sons had left and would keep the weapons as payment. However, they tried to take out the SOA as well.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/The+Sleep+of+Babies/episode/1235305/recap.html?tag=content_wrap;episode_header The Sleep of Babies - Recap]</ref>\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 2)}}\nAt the beginning of Season 2, Clay had Opie murder a member of the Mayans, who Clay had framed as the guy who murdered Donna.  After Opie murdered the Mayan, he carved the Anarchy symbol in his chest as a message to the Mayans. [[Jax Teller]] dropped off the body in Mayan Territory in Oakland after shooting the gang member multiple times in the body to destroy the symbol.  He then arranged the Mayan's hands to hold up 9 fingers to implicate the One-Niners as the culprits.  Alvarez later found the body and gave Clay a call asking to buy weapons.  Clay turned Alvarez down on the weapons transaction, telling him that the club was still under suspicion of the ATF; Clay then told Tig to call Laroy of the One-Niners to arrange a meeting to supply Niners with weapons so that they could defend themselves when the Mayans attacked.  During the weapons transaction between SAMCRO and the Niners, the Mayans ambushed the deal and stole all the Niner's AKs, and Bobby Elvis was shot in the shoulder during the ambush.  After the ambush, Alvarez was seen making a phone call to Ethan Zobelle of LOAN telling him his intel was correct and that he owed him.  Zobelle responded, \"Yes, you do,\" and then told AJ Weston that it was his friend from church on the phone.  Clay blamed the whole ambush and Bobby getting shot in the shoulder on Jax, as Jax changed the plan and set the Niners up for the hit instead of leaving Anarchy symbol on the dead Mayan's chest.\n\nIn the episode \"Service\", Zobelle met with Marcus Alvarez offering the Mayans the exclusive business of having their heroin distributed to all the local prisons.  Alvarez is hesitant about the deal because Zobelle wants to keep 50% of the profits, but has no choice when Zobelle tells him that he won't supply the Mayans with any more weapons if they don't go along with the new arrangement.\n\nIn the second-season finale, Marcus and the Mayans provided protection to Ethan Zobelle and Zobelle's daughter who were attempting to flee Charming.  Marcus was eventually able to convince Zobelle to leave his cigar shop, but the Mayan convoy they attempted to escape in was ambushed by SAMCRO.  Marcus survived the attack uninjured and Clay spared his life.\n\n====Season 3====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 3)}}\nDuring the season Alvarez hired a low ranked MC, the Calaveras, to help guard his shipment of heroin, with the promise to patch them over, but after SAMCRO stole them he decided not to patch them over and then returned Juice's [[kutte]]. At the advice of Clay, Alvarez decided to drop the war between them and in return the Grim Bastards MC, a friendly club to SAMCRO, would protect Alvarez's drug shipments.  As a favor to the Mayans, Tig and Kozik killed the Calaveras member who was caught during the drive-by at Half-Sack's wake.\n\nWhen a member of the Grim Bastards MC is found murdered and evidence points to the Calaveras, SAMCRO and the Bastards' President T.O. Cross go to Marcus Alvarez for help.  The Mayans and SAMCRO confront the Calaveras members in a park restroom and give the president of the Calaveras, Hector Salazar, the option of telling them which of his lieutenants killed the Bastards member or to die himself.  He gives up his Sgt-At-Arms, who is then promptly shot in the head by the enraged T.O.  A disgusted Alvarez strips Salazar of his position and kutte and then kicks him out of the Calaveras. He then appoints Salazar's V.P as president and advises him to keep a tighter hold on his men then Salazar did.\n\nWhen Tara Knowles and Margaret Murphy are taken hostage by Hector Salazar, Salazar demands that SAMCRO kill Alvarez and retrieve $250,000 worth of Mayans MC money.  Tig, Kozik, and Piney are able to convince Alvarez to play dead for 24 hours so that they can come up with a plan to get the women back.  Marcus tells the Sons that the $250,000 does not exist.\n\n====Season 4====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 4)}}\nHe is seen at Opie's wedding talking with Clay and thanking him for protection during their sentence. He says he was just \"looking out for my investments.\" Unlike previous seasons \u00c1lvarez now has a President's patch on his cut. He is also seen throughout the season forming an alliance between SOA and the Mayans in light of the Galindo Cartel who has connections to the Mayans. Alvarez helped set up a deal between the SOA and Galindo to mule their cocaine while the Mayans distribute and sell. He is also shown giving Mayans to help guard the cocaine in the Son's warehouse. When one of the bricks is stolen, he assures Jax and Clay his man was not responsible. He is later injured in a shootout with rival cartel Lobos Sonoras. He is brought to the clubhouse and treated by Tara.\n\n====Season 5====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 5)}}\nAlvarez was last seen in a street meeting with Jax, Henry Lin, and the Oakland One-Niner's leader Tyler to discuss allowing the Galindo Cartel's cocaine to move through their territory. Alvarez agrees as long as they \"keep black (the Niners) in line\". It is later stated the Mayans will take over the [[mule (smuggling)|muling]] as well, as SAMCRO wants out of the de al ardilla preciosa\n\n====Season 6====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 6)}}\nAlvarez and the Mayans only appear at the end of the sixth season (\"You Are My Sunshine\" and \"A Mother's Work\"), expressing their unhappiness with SAMCRO's decision to hand over the IRA gun business to August Marks. He also informs Jax of the Mayans' intention of setting up a charter in Stockton. Alvarez is also shown to be a friend of Nero Padilla; having served time in Chino together. Alvarez tells Nero that soon it might end up being \"brown and yellow against black and white\". When he arrives at the gun deal with the Sons, Nero, and the Niners. Alvarez is disappointed that August Marks wasn't present during the transaction. When SAMCRO and Tyler departs, Alvarez and his men gun down the Niners and steal the guns.\n\n====Season 7====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 7)}}\nAt the beginning of the seventh season, the Mayans have set up their Stockton charter with Oscar El Oso Ramos as president. Alvarez and the Mayans seem to be on the same side as Henry Lin and the Lin Triad against SAMCRO and the Niners. However, Alvarez joins SAMCRO's side when they believe the Triads are to blame for Tara's death and they help both SAMCRO and the One-Niners deal with both the Triads and August Marks. Alvarez is shown to be fully on SAMCRO's side when Juice approaches him offering information on SAMCRO in exchange for passage to Mexico. Alvarez hands Juice over to SAMCRO, saying he would never make a deal with a rat. When it is revealed that it was Gemma who killed Tara and not the Triads, Alvarez sympathizes with Jax and helps him clean up the mess with the Chinese. Later, the Mayans, One-Niners, SAMCRO and the Byz Lats discuss territories and business. One of Jax's final acts as president of SAMCRO is to set the Mayans up with Connor Malone as their new gun source, finally giving Alvarez the gun business he wanted.\n\n===Mayans M.C.===\n====Season 1====\n{{see also|Mayans M.C. (season 1)}}\nAlvarez now wearing an \"El Padrino\" patch which in English translates to \"the Godfather\". Goes down to Santo Padre Charter with members of the Mayans Motorcycle Club's Oakland, California charter to help the Santo Padre charter deal with the Galindo Cartel. It is revealed that he and Jos\u00e9 Galindo; the founder of the Galindo Cartel, had a mutual respect for one another. Alvarez later suspects that a mule in the Santo Padre charter is working with Los Olividados (\"The Forgotten Ones\"). In the season Finale Alvarez steps down as Padrino to work with the Galindo Cartel directly as Miguel's newly appointed [[consigliere|advisor]].\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Mayans M.C.

His son, [[List of characters from Sons of Anarchy#Esai \u00c1lvarez|Esai]], was also a member of the club but had a hit placed on him by Marcus in 2008 as punishment for failing his mission. Most of his, and his gang's, income is made through dealing [[heroin]] and [[methamphetamine]], and [[prostitution]]. For some time, he was a [[Incarceration|prisoner]] in [[California Institution for Men|Chino]], but was released some time before the beginning of Season One.\n\nOn his [[gang colors|colors]], he wears patches reading \"Los Asesinos de Dios\" ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for \"God's Assassins\") and \"Mayans Oakland\". However, his \"President\" patch is later changed to \"El Padrino\". He also has the [[Mayan Calendar]] tattooed on his chest.\n\n===Sons of Anarchy===\n====Season 1====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 1)}}\nAt the beginning of the first series, Marcus \u00c1lvarez and other members of the Mayans MC, broke into the Sons of Anarchy's weapons warehouse. The Mayans stole the guns; then they torched the warehouse. The Sons of Anarchy eventually got revenge, however, by stealing the guns back and destroying a Mayans narcotics storage facility.\n\n[[Ernest Darby]], leader of the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#Nordics|Nordics]] (after being supplied with a dossier containing all the details required to take over SAMCRO'S gun business, by a rogue ATF agent), calls a meeting with \u00c1lvarez. During their meeting, Darby proposes the Nords & Mayans further their present alliance. Darby's deal requires the Mayans first assassinate SAMCRO's President, followed by the rest of its members, with the spoils to be divided as follows: Darby's Nords get Charming (freeing them to expand their meth trade into the city). \u00c1lvarez and the Mayans (using the ATF dossier to be supplied by Darby, post-assassination) get to take over SAMCRO's lucrative gun business, utilize their newfound control of the gun trade to expand their heroin business & eliminate a longtime rival MC. \u00c1lvarez, recognizing an opportunity, reluctantly agrees in principle, but demurs on the Mayans eliminating SAMCRO requirement, instead suggesting a more joint effort, with the Mayans increasing their current security & support of the Nords power plays. Darby, sensing \u00c1lvarez knows the deal is too good to pass up, reiterates his initial demands, and exits the meeting - his \"take it or leave it\" ball placed squarely in \u00c1lvarez's court. With Darby now out of earshot, \u00c1lvarez immediately gives two orders: kill SAMCRO's President, and double-cross Darby by murdering him & taking the ATF dossier for themselves. \u00c1lvarez's son requests he & his crew be tasked with carrying out both orders - a request \u00c1lvarez grants.\n\nLater, the Mayans carry out simultaneous hits on both Darby & the SAMCRO President. However, both hits go sideways for the Mayans. The Mayans hit Darby at his home, killing 2 women & 1 Nord henchman, but missing Darby. Although they fail to kill Darby, they do manage to steal the ATF dossier. During the hit on SAMCRO President, Clay Morrow, the Mayans  find themselves outnumbered, as Clay & Tig are making a deal with the IRA at a bar - all of whom fight off & kill the Mayans, while suffering only one wounded in the process.\n\nThe failed hit generates two reactions. First, Clay orders the #1 & #2 members of every SOA charter between Charming to Tacoma to report to Charming ASAP. Second, Charming PD bring Clay in for questioning about the shootings. At his questioning, Clay asks his associate and corrupt Charming Police Chief [[Wayne Unser]] to allow him to have a \"little chat\" with Darby (who is already in Charming PD lockup) & to bring \u00c1lvarez in under similar pretenses, also holding him in Charming lockup, so they can hold a summit of sorts, to potentially curtail any further SOA-Mayan violence. Also during Clay's questioning a large group of SOA members (every charter's #1 & #2 from as far away as Tacoma) roars past Charming PD headquarters, in full view of both Clay & Unser. This show of gunboat diplomacy, sways Unser to acquiesce to Clay's summit request.\n\nGiven the green light by Unser, Clay first chats with Darby in his jail cell. Essentially imposing his will upon Darby via several powerful punches to the head, Clay forces Darby to submit.\n\nNext, \u00c1lvarez is brought in & locked up in a cell with Clay. Clay outlines an agreement where SAMCRO will sell weapons to the Mayans, in exchange for settling all SOA-Mayan disputes, across all charters, in favour of SOA, regardless of the cost to the Mayans - including the failed Mayan hit on Clay himself. \u00c1lvarez agrees to all terms, including recompense for the botched hit.\n\nClay then takes this tentative agreement to the club for a vote. All members vote unanimously to ratify the agreement charter-wide. MC members further decide justice for the hit on Clay should be carried out by Happy, as he is a member of a non-SAMCRO SOA charter.\n\nLater, during an idyllic looking, sunny California Sunday afternoon, \u00c1lvarez & his son Esai, share what briefly presents as a warm, sage-like, father-son moment in the park: Esai seeks reassurance for his shortcomings from his father. \u00c1lvarez cryptically reassures his son - and then leads him right over to the churro vendor (actually Happy in disguise), who expertly inserts a blade into the back of Esai's brain, killing him instantly, as \u00c1lvarez upholds his end of the bargain with a shocking demonstration of MC sobre sangre.\n\n \nWhen the Mayans eventually set up a deal with the Sons in Oakland, it was attacked by the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#One-Niners|One-Niners]]. A shoot-out ensued, and gang members from the One-Niners and Mayans were killed, but the Sons of Anarchy escaped. \u00c1lvarez was also shot in the leg and wounded. The deal was, in fact, a set-up organized by the Niners and SOA. The Niners were supposed to attack the Mayans after the Sons had left and would keep the weapons as payment. However, they tried to take out the SOA as well.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/The+Sleep+of+Babies/episode/1235305/recap.html?tag=content_wrap;episode_header The Sleep of Babies - Recap]</ref>\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 2)}}\nAt the beginning of Season 2, Clay had Opie murder a member of the Mayans, who Clay had framed as the guy who murdered Donna.  After Opie murdered the Mayan, he carved the Anarchy symbol in his chest as a message to the Mayans. [[Jax Teller]] dropped off the body in Mayan Territory in Oakland after shooting the gang member multiple times in the body to destroy the symbol.  He then arranged the Mayan's hands to hold up 9 fingers to implicate the One-Niners as the culprits.  Alvarez later found the body and gave Clay a call asking to buy weapons.  Clay turned Alvarez down on the weapons transaction, telling him that the club was still under suspicion of the ATF; Clay then told Tig to call Laroy of the One-Niners to arrange a meeting to supply Niners with weapons so that they could defend themselves when the Mayans attacked.  During the weapons transaction between SAMCRO and the Niners, the Mayans ambushed the deal and stole all the Niner's AKs, and Bobby Elvis was shot in the shoulder during the ambush.  After the ambush, Alvarez was seen making a phone call to Ethan Zobelle of LOAN telling him his intel was correct and that he owed him.  Zobelle responded, \"Yes, you do,\" and then told AJ Weston that it was his friend from church on the phone.  Clay blamed the whole ambush and Bobby getting shot in the shoulder on Jax, as Jax changed the plan and set the Niners up for the hit instead of leaving Anarchy symbol on the dead Mayan's chest.\n\nIn the episode \"Service\", Zobelle met with Marcus Alvarez offering the Mayans the exclusive business of having their heroin distributed to all the local prisons.  Alvarez is hesitant about the deal because Zobelle wants to keep 50% of the profits, but has no choice when Zobelle tells him that he won't supply the Mayans with any more weapons if they don't go along with the new arrangement.\n\nIn the second-season finale, Marcus and the Mayans provided protection to Ethan Zobelle and Zobelle's daughter who were attempting to flee Charming.  Marcus was eventually able to convince Zobelle to leave his cigar shop, but the Mayan convoy they attempted to escape in was ambushed by SAMCRO.  Marcus survived the attack uninjured and Clay spared his life.\n\n====Season 3====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 3)}}\nDuring the season Alvarez hired a low ranked MC, the Calaveras, to help guard his shipment of heroin, with the promise to patch them over, but after SAMCRO stole them he decided not to patch them over and then returned Juice's [[kutte]]. At the advice of Clay, Alvarez decided to drop the war between them and in return the Grim Bastards MC, a friendly club to SAMCRO, would protect Alvarez's drug shipments.  As a favor to the Mayans, Tig and Kozik killed the Calaveras member who was caught during the drive-by at Half-Sack's wake.\n\nWhen a member of the Grim Bastards MC is found murdered and evidence points to the Calaveras, SAMCRO and the Bastards' President T.O. Cross go to Marcus Alvarez for help.  The Mayans and SAMCRO confront the Calaveras members in a park restroom and give the president of the Calaveras, Hector Salazar, the option of telling them which of his lieutenants killed the Bastards member or to die himself.  He gives up his Sgt-At-Arms, who is then promptly shot in the head by the enraged T.O.  A disgusted Alvarez strips Salazar of his position and kutte and then kicks him out of the Calaveras. He then appoints Salazar's V.P as president and advises him to keep a tighter hold on his men then Salazar did.\n\nWhen Tara Knowles and Margaret Murphy are taken hostage by Hector Salazar, Salazar demands that SAMCRO kill Alvarez and retrieve $250,000 worth of Mayans MC money.  Tig, Kozik, and Piney are able to convince Alvarez to play dead for 24 hours so that they can come up with a plan to get the women back.  Marcus tells the Sons that the $250,000 does not exist.\n\n====Season 4====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 4)}}\nHe is seen at Opie's wedding talking with Clay and thanking him for protection during their sentence. He says he was just \"looking out for my investments.\" Unlike previous seasons \u00c1lvarez now has a President's patch on his cut. He is also seen throughout the season forming an alliance between SOA and the Mayans in light of the Galindo Cartel who has connections to the Mayans. Alvarez helped set up a deal between the SOA and Galindo to mule their cocaine while the Mayans distribute and sell. He is also shown giving Mayans to help guard the cocaine in the Son's warehouse. When one of the bricks is stolen, he assures Jax and Clay his man was not responsible. He is later injured in a shootout with rival cartel Lobos Sonoras. He is brought to the clubhouse and treated by Tara.\n\n====Season 5====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 5)}}\nAlvarez was last seen in a street meeting with Jax, Henry Lin, and the Oakland One-Niner's leader Tyler to discuss allowing the Galindo Cartel's cocaine to move through their territory. Alvarez agrees as long as they \"keep black (the Niners) in line\". It is later stated the Mayans will take over the [[mule (smuggling)|muling]] as well, as SAMCRO wants out of the de al ardilla preciosa\n\n====Season 6====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 6)}}\nAlvarez and the Mayans only appear at the end of the sixth season (\"You Are My Sunshine\" and \"A Mother's Work\"), expressing their unhappiness with SAMCRO's decision to hand over the IRA gun business to August Marks. He also informs Jax of the Mayans' intention of setting up a charter in Stockton. Alvarez is also shown to be a friend of Nero Padilla; having served time in Chino together. Alvarez tells Nero that soon it might end up being \"brown and yellow against black and white\". When he arrives at the gun deal with the Sons, Nero, and the Niners. Alvarez is disappointed that August Marks wasn't present during the transaction. When SAMCRO and Tyler departs, Alvarez and his men gun down the Niners and steal the guns.\n\n====Season 7====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 7)}}\nAt the beginning of the seventh season, the Mayans have set up their Stockton charter with Oscar El Oso Ramos as president. Alvarez and the Mayans seem to be on the same side as Henry Lin and the Lin Triad against SAMCRO and the Niners. However, Alvarez joins SAMCRO's side when they believe the Triads are to blame for Tara's death and they help both SAMCRO and the One-Niners deal with both the Triads and August Marks. Alvarez is shown to be fully on SAMCRO's side when Juice approaches him offering information on SAMCRO in exchange for passage to Mexico. Alvarez hands Juice over to SAMCRO, saying he would never make a deal with a rat. When it is revealed that it was Gemma who killed Tara and not the Triads, Alvarez sympathizes with Jax and helps him clean up the mess with the Chinese. Later, the Mayans, One-Niners, SAMCRO and the Byz Lats discuss territories and business. One of Jax's final acts as president of SAMCRO is to set the Mayans up with Connor Malone as their new gun source, finally giving Alvarez the gun business he wanted.\n\n===Mayans M.C.===\n====Season 1====\n{{see also|Mayans M.C. (season 1)}}\nAlvarez now wearing an \"El Padrino\" patch which in English translates to \"the Godfather\". Goes down to Santo Padre Charter with members of the Mayans Motorcycle Club's Oakland, California charter to help the Santo Padre charter deal with the Galindo Cartel. It is revealed that he and Jos\u00e9 Galindo; the founder of the Galindo Cartel, had a mutual respect for one another. Alvarez later suspects that a mule in the Santo Padre charter is working with Los Olividados (\"The Forgotten Ones\"). In the season Finale Alvarez steps down as Padrino to work with the Galindo Cartel directly as Miguel's newly appointed [[consigliere|advisor]].\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Mayans M.C.

The SDLP currently has 12 [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (Northern Ireland)|MLAs]] in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and two [[Member of parliament|MPs]] in [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Westminster]]. \n\nThe SDLP [[party platform]] advocates [[United Ireland|Irish reunification]], and the further [[devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution of powers]] while Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom. During [[the Troubles]], the SDLP was the most popular Irish nationalist party in Northern Ireland, but since the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] ceasefire in 1994, it has lost ground to the [[Irish republicanism|republican]] party [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], which in 2001 became the more popular of the two parties for the first time. Established during the Troubles, a significant difference between the two parties was the SDLP's rejection of violence, in contrast to Sinn F\u00e9in's support for the Provisional IRA and [[physical force republicanism]]. Since February 2019, the SDLP have been in partnership with [[Fianna F\u00e1il]].<ref name=\"FFpart\">{{cite news |title=SDLP members back Fianna F\u00e1il partnership |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-47179888 |accessdate=11 February 2019 |publisher=BBC News |date=9 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190210020638/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-47179888 |archive-date=10 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Foundation and early history===\nThe party was founded in August 1970, when six [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]] MPs and one Senator, former members of the [[Republican Labour Party]] (a party with ties to the [[Irish Labour Party]]), the [[National Democratic Party (Northern Ireland)|National Democratic Party]] (NDP, a small nationalist party that dissolved itself after the foundation of the SDLP),<ref name=\"NeuheiserWolff2004\">{{cite book|author1=J\u00f6rg Neuheiser|author2=Stefan Wolff|title=Peace at Last?: The Impact of the Good Friday Agreement on Northern Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3dUdFjqNCO4C&pg=PA46|accessdate=26 September 2012|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-57181-658-0|page=46|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530035552/http://books.google.com/books?id=3dUdFjqNCO4C&pg=PA46|archive-date=30 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> individual nationalists, former members of the [[Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland)|Nationalist Party]] and members of the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]], joined to form a new party.\n\nThe SDLP initially rejected the [[Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland)|Nationalist Party]]'s policy of [[abstentionism]] and sought to fight for [[civil rights]] within the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]] system. However, the SDLP quickly came to the view that Stormont was unreformable, and withdrew from parliamentary involvement.\n\nFollowing the abolition of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, the SDLP emerged as the second-largest party, and the largest party representing the nationalist community, in [[1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election|elections]] to the new [[Northern Ireland Assembly (1973)|Northern Ireland Assembly]] established in 1973: the party won 19 out of 75 seats.  The SDLP was one of the parties involved in the negotiations that resulted in the [[Sunningdale Agreement]], which in turn resulted in the establishment of a [[Northern Ireland Executive (1974)|power-sharing executive]] in January 1974.  [[Gerry Fitt]], the SDLP party leader, took office as deputy chief executive, taking government alongside the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (led by [[Brian Faulkner]]) and the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]].  The Assembly and Executive were short-lived, however, collapsing after only four months due to sustained opposition from within the unionist community, and it was to be 25 years before the party sat in government again.\n\n===The Good Friday Agreement and return to government===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe SDLP was a key player in the talks throughout the 1990s that led to the signing of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Murray, Gerard.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1131510536|title=Sinn F\u00e9in and the SDLP : from alienation to participation|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=1-4039-6860-8|oclc=1131510536}}</ref> John Hume won a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] that year with [[Ulster Unionist Party]] leader [[David Trimble]] in recognition of their efforts.\n\nAs a result of the Agreement, [[1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election|elections]] to a new [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] were held in June 1998; the SDLP emerged as the second-largest party overall, and the largest nationalist party, with 24 out of 108 seats.  The party was then returned to government later in the year when a [[consociationalism|power-sharing]] [[Northern Ireland Executive|Executive]] was established for Northern Ireland.  The SDLP took office alongside the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP), the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP), and [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], and the SDLP's [[Seamus Mallon]] became [[First Minister and deputy First Minister|Deputy First Minister]] alongside the UUP's First Minister, [[David Trimble]].\n\nUpon Mallon's retirement in 2001, [[Mark Durkan]] succeeded him as Deputy First Minister.\n\n===Possible merger===\nThere had been a debate in the party on the prospects of amalgamation with [[Fianna F\u00e1il]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/northernirelandassembly/story/0,,2052641,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=SDLP could unite with Fianna F\u00e1il | first=Henry | last=McDonald | date=8 April 2007 | accessdate=23 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518060904/http://politics.guardian.co.uk/northernirelandassembly/story/0,,2052641,00.html | archive-date=18 May 2007 | url-status=live }}</ref> Little came of this speculation and former party leader, Margaret Ritchie, rejected the idea.

The SDLP saw this as a major opportunity to become the voice of Irish Nationalism in Westminster and to provide effective opposition to the much enlarged Democratic Unionist Party group. The SDLP was consequently paying more attention to the Westminster Parliament and working to strengthen its ties with the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]], whose [[whip (politics)|whip]] they informally accepted. The SDLP was a vocal opponent at Westminster of the proposal to extend detention without trial to 42 days and previously opposed measures to extend detention to 90 days and 28 days. SDLP MP and former leader [[Mark Durkan]] tabled an [[Early Day Motion]] on [[cluster munitions]] which gained cross-party support and was quickly followed by a decision by the UK government to support a ban.\n\nIn the [[2017 United Kingdom general election]], they lost all their seats in Westminster. The SDLP and [[Ulster Unionist Party|UUP]] with the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]] all have found it difficult to win certain seats to Westminster since the rise of the [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]] and [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]. However, in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election in Northern Ireland|2019 general election]] they regained two seats.\n\n===Proposed D\u00e1il participation===\nThe SDLP, along with Sinn F\u00e9in, have long sought speaking rights in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the [[lower house]] of the Republic's [[Oireachtas|parliament]]. In 2005, [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]] leader of [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] put forward a tentative proposal to allow MPs and MEPs from Northern Ireland to participate in debates on the region. However, it met with vociferous opposition from the Republic's main opposition parties [[Fine Gael]] and the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]], and the plan was subsequently shelved.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishecho.com/newspaper/story.cfm?id=17364|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060704151702/http://www.irishecho.com/newspaper/story.cfm?id=17364|url-status=dead|title=See ''Irish Echo'' article|archivedate=4 July 2006}}</ref> Unionists had also strongly opposed the proposal.\n\n===Remembrance Day 2010===\nOn [[Remembrance Day]] 2010 party leader Margaret Ritchie made history by becoming the first leader of a nationalist party to wear a poppy while attending a wreath-laying ceremony in [[Downpatrick]].

In 1998, it became the biggest party overall in terms of votes received, the first time this had been achieved by a nationalist party. In the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] and in the [[2003 Northern Ireland Assembly election|2003 Assembly election]], [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] won more seats and votes than the SDLP for the first time.\n\nThe retirement of [[John Hume]] was followed by a period when the party started slipping electorally. In the [[2004 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2004 European elections]], Hume stood down and the SDLP failed to retain the seat he had held since 1979, losing to [[Sinn F\u00e9in]].\n\nSome see the SDLP as first and foremost a party now representing [[Catholic]] middle-class interests, with voters concentrated in rural areas and the professional classes, rather than a vehicle for Irish nationalism. The SDLP reject this argument, pointing to their strong support in [[Derry]] and their victory in [[Belfast South (UK Parliament constituency)|South Belfast]] in the 2005 election. Furthermore, in the lead up to the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 Westminster election]], they published a document outlining their plans for a politically united Ireland. Their decline in Northern Ireland outside of two particular strongholds had led some to dub the party the \"South Down and Londonderry Party\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/irish_news/arts2007/mar29_deal_with_devil_small_price__NEmerson.php |title=Newton Emerson |publisher=Nuzhound.com |accessdate=4 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822083922/http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/irish_news/arts2007/mar29_deal_with_devil_small_price__NEmerson.php |archive-date=22 August 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Northern Ireland election seats 1997-2019.svg|800px]]\n\nThe party claims that the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 Westminster elections]] \u2014 when they lost [[Newry and Armagh (UK Parliament constituency)|Newry and Armagh]] to Sinn F\u00e9in but Durkan comfortably held Hume's seat of [[Foyle (UK Parliament constituency)|Foyle]] whilst they also gained [[South Belfast (UK Parliament constituency)|South Belfast]] with a slightly bigger share of the vote than in the 2003 assembly elections \u2013 shows that the decline caused by Sinn F\u00e9in's rejection of [[physical force republicanism]] has slowed and that their vote share demands they play a central role in any constitutional discussions. However the British Government remain focused on [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]], as the mechanisms of government outlined in the Agreement mean that it is only necessary that a majority of assembly members from each community (which these two parties currently have) agree a way forward.\n\nThe SDLP endorsed and actively supported the replacement of the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]], a force which many nationalists opposed, with the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]].\n\nIn the [[2009 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2009 European election]] the party fielded [[Alban Maginness]] as their candidate and failed to gain a seat with 78,489 first preference votes.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8089501.stm|title= Sinn F\u00e9in tops poll in Euro count-BBC News|date= 8 June 2009|accessdate= 27 March 2010|archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/5lhQDgRjs?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8089501.stm|archive-date= 1 December 2009|url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe party further declined in the 2011 Assembly elections. It lost two seats although it polled ahead of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) which won more seats.\nThe decline continued in the [[2016 Northern Ireland Assembly election|2016 Assembly election]], as a further two seats were lost and the total number of votes received dropped. In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 Westminster elections]], however, the SDLP lost all three seats, but they recaptured two of these (Belfast South and Foyle) in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 Westminster elections]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Party\n! valign=\"top\" | Leader\n! valign=\"top\" | Candidates\n! valign=\"top\" |

During [[the Troubles]], the SDLP was the most popular Irish nationalist party in Northern Ireland, but since the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] ceasefire in 1994, it has lost ground to the [[Irish republicanism|republican]] party [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], which in 2001 became the more popular of the two parties for the first time. Established during the Troubles, a significant difference between the two parties was the SDLP's rejection of violence, in contrast to Sinn F\u00e9in's support for the Provisional IRA and [[physical force republicanism]]. Since February 2019, the SDLP have been in partnership with [[Fianna F\u00e1il]].<ref name=\"FFpart\">{{cite news |title=SDLP members back Fianna F\u00e1il partnership |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-47179888 |accessdate=11 February 2019 |publisher=BBC News |date=9 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190210020638/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-47179888 |archive-date=10 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Foundation and early history===\nThe party was founded in August 1970, when six [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]] MPs and one Senator, former members of the [[Republican Labour Party]] (a party with ties to the [[Irish Labour Party]]), the [[National Democratic Party (Northern Ireland)|National Democratic Party]] (NDP, a small nationalist party that dissolved itself after the foundation of the SDLP),<ref name=\"NeuheiserWolff2004\">{{cite book|author1=J\u00f6rg Neuheiser|author2=Stefan Wolff|title=Peace at Last?: The Impact of the Good Friday Agreement on Northern Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3dUdFjqNCO4C&pg=PA46|accessdate=26 September 2012|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-57181-658-0|page=46|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530035552/http://books.google.com/books?id=3dUdFjqNCO4C&pg=PA46|archive-date=30 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> individual nationalists, former members of the [[Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland)|Nationalist Party]] and members of the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]], joined to form a new party.\n\nThe SDLP initially rejected the [[Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland)|Nationalist Party]]'s policy of [[abstentionism]] and sought to fight for [[civil rights]] within the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]] system. However, the SDLP quickly came to the view that Stormont was unreformable, and withdrew from parliamentary involvement.\n\nFollowing the abolition of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, the SDLP emerged as the second-largest party, and the largest party representing the nationalist community, in [[1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election|elections]] to the new [[Northern Ireland Assembly (1973)|Northern Ireland Assembly]] established in 1973: the party won 19 out of 75 seats.  The SDLP was one of the parties involved in the negotiations that resulted in the [[Sunningdale Agreement]], which in turn resulted in the establishment of a [[Northern Ireland Executive (1974)|power-sharing executive]] in January 1974.  [[Gerry Fitt]], the SDLP party leader, took office as deputy chief executive, taking government alongside the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (led by [[Brian Faulkner]]) and the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]].  The Assembly and Executive were short-lived, however, collapsing after only four months due to sustained opposition from within the unionist community, and it was to be 25 years before the party sat in government again.\n\n===The Good Friday Agreement and return to government===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe SDLP was a key player in the talks throughout the 1990s that led to the signing of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998. John Hume won a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] that year with [[Ulster Unionist Party]] leader [[David Trimble]] in recognition of their efforts.\n\nAs a result of the Agreement, [[1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election|elections]] to a new [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] were held in June 1998; the SDLP emerged as the second-largest party overall, and the largest nationalist party, with 24 out of 108 seats.  The party was then returned to government later in the year when a [[consociationalism|power-sharing]] [[Northern Ireland Executive|Executive]] was established for Northern Ireland.  The SDLP took office alongside the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP), the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP), and [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], and the SDLP's [[Seamus Mallon]] became [[First Minister and deputy First Minister|Deputy First Minister]] alongside the UUP's First Minister, [[David Trimble]].\n\nUpon Mallon's retirement in 2001, [[Mark Durkan]] succeeded him as Deputy First Minister.\n\n===Possible merger===\nThere had been a debate in the party on the prospects of amalgamation with [[Fianna F\u00e1il]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/northernirelandassembly/story/0,,2052641,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=SDLP could unite with Fianna F\u00e1il | first=Henry | last=McDonald | date=8 April 2007 | accessdate=23 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518060904/http://politics.guardian.co.uk/northernirelandassembly/story/0,,2052641,00.html | archive-date=18 May 2007 | url-status=live }}</ref> Little came of this speculation and former party leader, Margaret Ritchie, rejected the idea.

The SDLP saw this as a major opportunity to become the voice of Irish Nationalism in Westminster and to provide effective opposition to the much enlarged Democratic Unionist Party group. The SDLP was consequently paying more attention to the Westminster Parliament and working to strengthen its ties with the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]], whose [[whip (politics)|whip]] they informally accepted. The SDLP was a vocal opponent at Westminster of the proposal to extend detention without trial to 42 days and previously opposed measures to extend detention to 90 days and 28 days. SDLP MP and former leader [[Mark Durkan]] tabled an [[Early Day Motion]] on [[cluster munitions]] which gained cross-party support and was quickly followed by a decision by the UK government to support a ban.\n\nIn the [[2017 United Kingdom general election]], they lost all their seats in Westminster. The SDLP and [[Ulster Unionist Party|UUP]] with the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]] all have found it difficult to win certain seats to Westminster since the rise of the [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]] and [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]. However, in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election in Northern Ireland|2019 general election]] they regained two seats.\n\n===Proposed D\u00e1il participation===\nThe SDLP, along with Sinn F\u00e9in, have long sought speaking rights in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the [[lower house]] of the Republic's [[Oireachtas|parliament]]. In 2005, [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]] leader of [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] put forward a tentative proposal to allow MPs and MEPs from Northern Ireland to participate in debates on the region. However, it met with vociferous opposition from the Republic's main opposition parties [[Fine Gael]] and the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]], and the plan was subsequently shelved.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishecho.com/newspaper/story.cfm?id=17364|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060704151702/http://www.irishecho.com/newspaper/story.cfm?id=17364|url-status=dead|title=See ''Irish Echo'' article|archivedate=4 July 2006}}</ref> Unionists had also strongly opposed the proposal.\n\n===Remembrance Day 2010===\nOn [[Remembrance Day]] 2010 party leader Margaret Ritchie made history by becoming the first leader of a nationalist party to wear a poppy while attending a wreath-laying ceremony in [[Downpatrick]].

In 1998, it became the biggest party overall in terms of votes received, the first time this had been achieved by a nationalist party. In the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] and in the [[2003 Northern Ireland Assembly election|2003 Assembly election]], [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] won more seats and votes than the SDLP for the first time.\n\nThe retirement of [[John Hume]] was followed by a period when the party started slipping electorally. In the [[2004 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2004 European elections]], Hume stood down and the SDLP failed to retain the seat he had held since 1979, losing to [[Sinn F\u00e9in]].\n\nSome see the SDLP as first and foremost a party now representing [[Catholic]] middle-class interests, with voters concentrated in rural areas and the professional classes, rather than a vehicle for Irish nationalism. The SDLP reject this argument, pointing to their strong support in [[Derry]] and their victory in [[Belfast South (UK Parliament constituency)|South Belfast]] in the 2005 election. Furthermore, in the lead up to the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 Westminster election]], they published a document outlining their plans for a politically united Ireland. Their decline in Northern Ireland outside of two particular strongholds had led some to dub the party the \"South Down and Londonderry Party\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/irish_news/arts2007/mar29_deal_with_devil_small_price__NEmerson.php |title=Newton Emerson |publisher=Nuzhound.com |accessdate=4 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822083922/http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/irish_news/arts2007/mar29_deal_with_devil_small_price__NEmerson.php |archive-date=22 August 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Northern Ireland election seats 1997-2019.svg|800px]]\n\nThe party claims that the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 Westminster elections]] \u2014 when they lost [[Newry and Armagh (UK Parliament constituency)|Newry and Armagh]] to Sinn F\u00e9in but Durkan comfortably held Hume's seat of [[Foyle (UK Parliament constituency)|Foyle]] whilst they also gained [[South Belfast (UK Parliament constituency)|South Belfast]] with a slightly bigger share of the vote than in the 2003 assembly elections \u2013 shows that the decline caused by Sinn F\u00e9in's rejection of [[physical force republicanism]] has slowed and that their vote share demands they play a central role in any constitutional discussions. However the British Government remain focused on [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]], as the mechanisms of government outlined in the Agreement mean that it is only necessary that a majority of assembly members from each community (which these two parties currently have) agree a way forward.\n\nThe SDLP endorsed and actively supported the replacement of the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]], a force which many nationalists opposed, with the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]].\n\nIn the [[2009 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2009 European election]] the party fielded [[Alban Maginness]] as their candidate and failed to gain a seat with 78,489 first preference votes.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8089501.stm|title= Sinn F\u00e9in tops poll in Euro count-BBC News|date= 8 June 2009|accessdate= 27 March 2010|archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/5lhQDgRjs?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8089501.stm|archive-date= 1 December 2009|url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe party further declined in the 2011 Assembly elections. It lost two seats although it polled ahead of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) which won more seats.\nThe decline continued in the [[2016 Northern Ireland Assembly election|2016 Assembly election]], as a further two seats were lost and the total number of votes received dropped. In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 Westminster elections]], however, the SDLP lost all three seats, but they recaptured two of these (Belfast South and Foyle) in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 Westminster elections]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Party\n! valign=\"top\" | Leader\n! valign=\"top\" | Candidates\n! valign=\"top\" |

Bridgmont came second but the then festival director, Mr Robin arranged for Peter to go to the [[Guildhall School of Music & Drama]] in London, which he did.\n\n== Career ==\nBridgmont starred alongside Baron [[Richard Attenborough]] ([[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]], 1923\u2013 2014) in the first [[West End theatre|West End]] production of [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[The Mousetrap]]'' opening in 1952 at the [[Ambassadors Theatre (London)|Ambassadors Theatre]], which went on to become the world's longest running [[Stage productions|stage production]]. Bridgmont met his wife Barbara Brown (Bridgmont) while they were both former company members at the [[Theatre Workshop]] whose long-serving director was [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]]s graduate [[Joan Littlewood]] (1914\u20132002) and fellow members included [[Richard Harris]] (1930\u20132002), [[Nigel Hawthorne]] ([[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]]; 1929\u20132001), [[George Sewell]] (1924\u20132007), [[David Scase]] (1919\u20132003), [[Victor Spinetti]] (1929\u20132012), [[John Thaw]] ([[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]], 1942\u20132002), [[Barbara Windsor]] ([[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire|DBE]], 1937\u2013), [[Yootha Joyce]] (1927\u20131980), [[Sheila Hancock]] ([[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]],1933\u2013), [[Dudley Foster]] (1924\u20131973), [[Marjie Lawrence]] (1932\u20132010), [[Stephen Lewis (actor)|Stephen Lewis]] (1926\u20132015), [[Ewan MacColl]] (1915\u20131989), [[Murray Melvin]] (1932\u2013), [[Frank Norman]] (1930\u20131980), [[John Junkin]] (1930\u20132006), [[Roy Kinnear]] (1934\u20131988), [[Diana Coupland]] (1928\u20132006), [[Shelagh Delaney]] (1938\u20132011), [[Glynn Edwards]] (1931\u20132018) and [[Howard Goorney]] (1921\u20132007). Many [[Theatre Workshop]] productions were transferred to theatres in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and some like as ''[[Oh, What a Lovely War!]]'' and ''[[A Taste of Honey]]'', were made into films.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Theatre Royal: 100 Years of Stratford East|last=Coren|first=Michael|publisher=Quartet Books|year=1984|isbn=978-0-7043-2474-9|location=London|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/theatreroyal100y00core}}</ref> Peter was introduced to and worked with one of the pioneers of [[modern dance]] in Europe, [[Rudolf von Laban]] ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Rezs\u0151 L\u00e1b\u00e1n de V\u00e1raljas''; 1879-1958) through his [[Laban Movement Analysis]], [[Labanotation]] (''Kinetography'') and [[Laban Movement Studies|Laban Movement Study]]. The couple relocated to [[Vence]] ([[Occitan language|Occitan]]: ''Ven\u00e7a'') in the hills of the [[Alpes Maritimes]] [[Departments of France|department]] in the French [[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]] [[Regions of France|region]] between [[Nice]] and [[Antibes]], formed their own [[Mime artist|Mime]] Company and collaborated with [[Modernism|modernist]] [[theatre practitioner]], director and [[scenic designer]] [[Edward Gordon Craig]] ([[Companion of Honour|CH]] [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] 1872\u20131966), the son of actress Dame [[Ellen Terry]] ([[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire|GBE]], 1847\u20131928). After three years of [[Touring theatre|touring]] they came back to the United Kingdom.\n\n== Chrysalis Theatre Acting School ==\nThe couple studied the formation of the art of [[Voice acting|dramatic speech]] and [[gesture]] created by Austrian philosopher, [[social reformer]], [[Architecture|architect]] and [[Esotericism|esotericist]] [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861\u20131925). They started the '''Boundaries Theatre Company''' which became their own drama school in 1975, the Chrysalis Theatre Acting School in the same [[London]] building they had bought in [[Balham]]. The theatre' venue had been used by the [[Spiritualist Association of Great Britain]] until then. The students who came from all over the world such as Japan or certain [[African countries]] included [[Spanish citizenship|Spanish]] actress Luz Altamira or Sir [[Mark Rylance]]. The school lasted for thirty years. In the 1990s both of them gave training in [[Voice acting|voice]] and [[gesture]] to the professional company of the [[Shakespeare's Globe]]. Peter also gave courses in both the United States and throughout Europe during the same period.\n\n== La Cris\u00e1lida ==\nBridgmont supported the '''La Cris\u00e1lida Studio''', the first school focused on the 'Art of [[Speech]]' in [[Spain]], founded by his pupils speech artist '''Luz Altamira''' and [[Goya Awards]]-nominated thespian '''\u00c1lvaro Ramos''' as well as actress and author '''Pilar Altamira''' member of the '[[Anthroposophical Society]] of [[Spain]]'.

I use the word 'persona' carefully, as they taught me how to move with sound, through sound, persona. In our visual-material age, sound is the great undiscovered or forgotten land for actors and audiences. Reason and Emotion are all very well in speech, much needed, but with Peter and Barbara I learnt of the limbs of speech, the feet, the legs, the arms, the great will and beautiful spirit to move with speech. Just as a marvellous javelin thrower wills his spear down the pitch to the winning distance and harnesses every muscle necessary in perfect balance to achieve his aim, so, when appropriate, we speak in space and silence. It was a lucky day for me when I met them; they know some great secrets and forgotten pathways.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberationofacting.com/|title=FOREWORD by Mark

After three years of [[Touring theatre|touring]] they came back to the United Kingdom.\n\n== Chrysalis Theatre Acting School ==\nThe couple studied the formation of the art of [[Voice acting|dramatic speech]] and [[gesture]] created by Austrian philosopher, [[social reformer]], [[Architecture|architect]] and [[Esotericism|esotericist]] [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861\u20131925). They started the '''Boundaries Theatre Company''' which became their own drama school in 1975, the Chrysalis Theatre Acting School in the same [[London]] building they had bought in [[Balham]]. The theatre' venue had been used by the [[Spiritualist Association of Great Britain]] until then. The students who came from all over the world such as Japan or certain [[African countries]] included [[Spanish citizenship|Spanish]] actress Luz Altamira or Sir [[Mark Rylance]]. The school lasted for thirty years. In the 1990s both of them gave training in [[Voice acting|voice]] and [[gesture]] to the professional company of the [[Shakespeare's Globe]]. Peter also gave courses in both the United States and throughout Europe during the same period.\n\n== La Cris\u00e1lida ==\nBridgmont supported the '''La Cris\u00e1lida Studio''', the first school focused on the 'Art of [[Speech]]' in [[Spain]], founded by his pupils speech artist '''Luz Altamira''' and [[Goya Awards]]-nominated thespian '''\u00c1lvaro Ramos''' as well as actress and author '''Pilar Altamira''' member of the '[[Anthroposophical Society]] of [[Spain]]'.

I use the word 'persona' carefully, as they taught me how to move with sound, through sound, persona. In our visual-material age, sound is the great undiscovered or forgotten land for actors and audiences. Reason and Emotion are all very well in speech, much needed, but with Peter and Barbara I learnt of the limbs of speech, the feet, the legs, the arms, the great will and beautiful spirit to move with speech. Just as a marvellous javelin thrower wills his spear down the pitch to the winning distance and harnesses every muscle necessary in perfect balance to achieve his aim, so, when appropriate, we speak in space and silence. It was a lucky day for me when I met them; they know some great secrets and forgotten pathways.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberationofacting.com/|title=FOREWORD by Mark Rylance|last=Rylance|first=Mark|date=27 August 2015|website=Liberation of Acting|access-date=11 August 2018}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n* ''\"Readers who are interested in the Art of Drama may also wish to refer to The Liberation of The Actor (1992) by Peter Bridgmont\"''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rhythms of Learning: What Waldorf Education Offers Children, Parents & Teachers|last=Steiner|first=Rudolf|publisher=SteinerBooks|year=1998|isbn=9780880104517|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== British Film Institute Archives ==\nA r\u00e9pertoire of Bridgmont's voice work for the year 1966 is available at the [[British Film Institute]] archives as follows:\n* 1966: ''The Sword Must Be Kept Sharp'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]].\n* 1966: ''What Did Greece Matter?'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''It Will Proceed to the End'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''One Perplexity after Another'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''We Are on the Edge of a Precipice'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''Not a Penny off the Pay'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[David Bauer (actor)|David Bauer]].\n* 1966: ''It Has Advanced the Footlights'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''Your Death Knell Has Sounded'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''War Is Re-enthroned'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''We Neither Govern Not Misgovern'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[David Bauer (actor)|David Bauer]].\n* 1966: ''The Popular Masses Are Dull'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''Germany Is Reawakening'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''There Lies a Sleeping Giant'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''Who Can Conquer the Street...'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''On the Idle Hill of Summer'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''Make Room for Peace'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''There Is a Great Tide Turning'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''This Is Such a Time'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[David Bauer (actor)|David Bauer]].\n* 1966: ''Boys You Have Been Betrayed'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''Now I Can Die'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[David Bauer (actor)|David Bauer]].\n* 1966: ''Long Live the War'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''What Hand Would Not Wither'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]], Robert Ayres and [[David Bauer (actor)|David Bauer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc891e6a8|title=Voice work 1966 Bridgmont|date=1 January 2017|website=British Film Institute (BFI)|access-date=11 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Honours ==\n* The documentary on Peter and Barbara directed by [[Spanish citizenship|Spanish]] actor and director \u00c1lvaro Ramos which was eponymously titled '''The Chrysalis''' (2009) won the Best Documentary award at the High Desert International Film Festival in [[Nevada]], United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clandestinodeactores.com/alvaro-ramos|title=Alvaro's work|date=5 May 2015|website=Clandestino de Actores|access-date=17 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nPeter's son, Andrew Bridgmont, is also an accomplished actor himself who notably starred in [[Matthew Vaughn]]'s ''[[Kingsman: The Secret Service]]'' (2014), [[James Marsh (director)|James Marsh]]'s ''[[The Theory of Everything (2014 film)|The Theory of Everything]]'' (2014) or ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'' (2014\u20132016).\n\n== External links ==\n* Bridgmont's [http://www.liberationofacting.com/ official website].\n\n== Sources ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bridgmont, Peter}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:20th-century English male actors]]\n[[Category:English male dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:English male film actors]]\n[[Category:English male Shakespearean actors]]\n[[Category:English male stage actors]]\n[[Category:English male television actors]]\n[[Category:English theatre directors]]\n[[Category:Royal Shakespeare Company members]]\n[[Category:Guildhall School of Music and Drama]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n", "name_user": "\u62d3\u8dcb\u6c0f \u99ac", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bridgmont"}
