Her late father grew up in Takehara and this is her first time back in the town in five years. F\u016b enjoys photography and is often engrossed with taking pictures with her father's old [[Rollei 35 S]] film camera. A shy girl, F\u016b tries her best to make friends early on, spurred on by her childhood friend Kaoru Hanawa. She quickly becomes friends with two other girls, Maon Sakurada and Norie Okazaki. After a year has passed, F\u016b forms a photography club and meets fellow photographer Kanae Mitani.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|F\u016b Sawatari}}|\u6ca2\u6e21 \u6953|Sawatari F\u016b}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ayana Taketatsu]]}}\n:A high school girl with a love of photography.
