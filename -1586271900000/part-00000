Wang rose to fame in 1967 with his starring role in ''[[One-Armed Swordsman]]'', a martial arts film produced by the [[Shaw Brothers Studio]] and ''[[The Chinese Boxer]]'' (1970).\n\n==Career==\nWang was born as ''Wang Zhengquan'' in [[Shanghai]]. Before joining the Hong Kong-based [[Shaw Brothers Studio]] in 1963, he served in the [[National Revolutionary Army]] and was also a swimming champion in Hong Kong and a car racing enthusiast. In 1968, he acted with [[Cheng Pei-pei]] in the [[wuxia]] film ''[[Golden Swallow (1968 film)|Golden Swallow]]'', directed by [[Chang Cheh]].<ref name=NYT2>{{cite web|title=Golden Swallow|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/159347/The-Golden-Swallow/overview}}</ref> Following that, Wang starred in many other wuxia films, including ''Temple of the Red Lotus'' (1965), ''[[One Armed Boxer]]'' (1971), ''[[Master of the Flying Guillotine]]''<ref name=NYT/> (1976) and ''[[Return of the Chinese Boxer]]'' (1977).\n\nIf ''[[One-Armed Swordsman]]'' was the movie that launched Wang's acting career, ''[[The Chinese Boxer]]'' was the film that sealed his fame in [[Hong Kong cinema]]. The latter has been credited{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} as being the first Hong Kong martial arts film that kickstarted the unarmed combat genre, mainly [[kung fu]]. It also triggered a phenomenon that filled the ranks of many Chinese martial arts associations across [[Southeast Asia]]. Chinese youths, in their bid to emulate Wang, took to punching sandbags, and reading up on the history of [[Shaolin Kung Fu]].\n\nControversy dogged Wang after the fame that exploded with ''[[The Chinese Boxer]]''. He broke his contract with the [[Shaw Brothers Studio]], and was promptly slapped with a lawsuit. The legal tussle that ended in the studio's favour led to Wang being banned from making films in Hong Kong. Wang then looked to Taiwan for better career prospects, linking up with [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] and other independent film outfits. His subsequent works were mostly filmed in Taiwan.\n\nWith the success of ''[[The Chinese Boxer]]'', Wang stood unchallenged in Southeast Asia for a short time, as the Chinese actor with the most formidable fists and legs. But beginning in the 1970s, Wang's star began to be eclipsed with the entry of new actors, many with superior martial arts training such as [[Ti Lung]], [[David Chiang]], and especially [[Bruce Lee]], whose role in ''[[The Big Boss]]'' (1971) revolutionised the martial arts film genre.\n\nIn 1975, Wang starred in the [[Australian]] action film ''[[The Man from Hong Kong]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Man From Hong Kong|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/101159/The-Man-From-Hong-Kong/overview}}</ref> In 1976, Wang appeared alongside [[Jackie Chan]] in [[Lo Wei]]'s ''[[Killer Meteors]]''. In the late 1970s, Wang helped Chan when then the latter sought his help in settling a dispute with Lo Wei. Chan eventually repaid the favour with his roles in Wang's films, ''[[Fantasy Mission Force]]'' (1982) and ''[[Island of Fire]]'' (1990).\n\nIn 1986, [[Sammo Hung]] cast Wang as [[Wong Kei-ying]] (the father of Chinese folk hero [[Wong Fei Hung]]) in ''[[Millionaire's Express]]''. In the years that followed, Wang kept a low profile, making a rare public appearance in 2002 at the funeral of [[Chang Cheh]].\n\nWang acted in more than 70 films in a career that spanned more than two decades. He left an indelible mark on the history of martial arts film.  Wang was once the highest paid martial arts film actor in Hong Kong before Bruce Lee broke the record.\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1969, Wang married actress [[Jeanette Lin Chui]], who was nine years his senior. Before that, Wang had an affair with the wife of film director [[Chun Kim]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Chun Kim hanged himself before a divorce took place.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Jeanette Lin, who had a high profile in Hong Kong cinema in the 1950s and 1960s, left the industry almost immediately after her marriage. Matrimony turned out to be a tumultuous affair for both Wang and Lin. Amid allegations of wife-beating, the marriage crumbled in 1975. Wang and Lin had three daughters. Their eldest daughter [[Linda Wong (singer)|Linda Wong]] became a popular [[Cantopop]] singer in the 1990s. Lin migrated to the United States in 1977 and would died in 1995 after an asthma attack.\n\nWang later remarried in 1978, this time to air hostess Wang Kaizhen (\u738b\u51f1\u8c9e). This marriage, too, proved to be a stormy relationship and Wang Kaizhen filed for divorce. Maybe out of frustration, Wang Kaizhen started an affair with a young businessman Zhang Zhao (\u5f35\u662d). Having gotten wind of it, Wang, accompanied by reporters and the police, surprised the couple at their lodging and publicly exposed his wife.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} After public humiliation was heaped on the couple, Wang divorced his second wife in 1997.\n\nIn 1981, he faced a murder charge in Taiwan. However, the charge was eventually dropped before it could make it to court due to lack of evidence.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Wang's involvement in public brawls also made headlines from time to time.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 2011 Wang Yu suffered a stroke which caused him to lose much of his strength in the left side of his body.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} However, he worked vigorously at his physical therapy, even exceeding the doctor's recommended pace. Reportedly he would lift his arm 1000 times a day instead of 200, and he would walk three times the suggested distance. As a result of his efforts he can walk and talk almost normally,  and he can lift his left arm, though he can no longer use its full strength. Since then he has tried to live normally,  and has even returned to film work. He admitted to even driving to his physical therapy session with the use of only the one arm, but explained that his daughter put a stop to that when she found out and had hired him a driver.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Actor===\n{{Div col}}\n*''{{Interlanguage link multi|Temple of the Red Lotus|fr|Temple of the Red Lotus}}'' (1965) - Kuei Wu\n*''[[The Twin Swords]]'' (1965) - Kuei Wu\n*''Tiger Boy'' (1966) - 'Tiger Boy' Lei Hu\n*''{{Interlanguage link multi|The Magnificent Trio|fr|Le Trio magnifique}}'' (1966) - Fang Lu\n*''Kuai lo qing chun'' (1966)\n*''{{Interlanguage link multi|Asia-Pol|fr|Asia-Pol}}'' (1966) - Yang Ming-Hsuan\n*''{{Interlanguage link multi|Auntie Lan|fr|Auntie Lan}}'' (1967) - He You-Wen\n*''Trail of the Broken Blade'' (1967) - Li Yueh\n*''[[The Sword and the Lute]]'' (1967) - Kuei Wu\n*''[[One-Armed Swordsman]]'' (1967) - Fang Kang / One-armed Swordsman\n*''The Assassin'' (1967) - Nieh Cheng\n*''[[Golden Swallow (1968 film)|Golden Swallow]]'' (1968) - Silver Roc Hsiao Peng\n*''[[The Sword of Swords]]'' (1968) - Ling Tseng-hsiao\n*''Qing guan'' (1968)\n*''[[Return of the One-Armed Swordsman]]'' (1969) - Fang Gang / One-armed Swordsman\n*''My Son'' (1970) - Yang Kuo-Liang\n*''[[The Chinese Boxer]]'' (1970) - Lei Ming\n*''[[Zatoichi and the One-Armed Swordsman]]'' (1971) - Wang Kong / One-armed Swordsman\n*''The Desperate Chase'' (1971)\n*''Xia yi shuang xiong'' (1971)\n*''The Magnificent Chivalry'' (1971)\n*''Jian'' (1971) - Hsia Ho Wei\n*''Zhui ming qiang'' (1971) - Lung Ti / The White Dragon\n*''[[The Invincible Sword]]'' (1971) - Ling Yu Fong\n*''Wei zhen si fang'' (1971) - Tiger Wong\n*''[[The Professional Killer]]'' (1971)\n*''Morale and Evil'' (1971) - Iron palm Bai Si-Feng\n*''Shogun Saints'' (1972)\n*''[[Furious Slaughter]]'' (1972) - Ma Yung Shen\n*''Kuang feng sha'' (1972) - Ti Si-Guan\n*''Ma Su Zhen bao xiong chou'' (1972)\n*''The Adventure'' (1972) - Guan Dong-Shan\n*''[[Chow Ken]]'' (1972) - Shi Ling Shu\n*''[[One Armed Boxer]]'' (1972) - Yu Tien Lung\n*''Yi shen shi dan'' (1972) - The Gallant (parts 1, 2, 3)\n*''The Invincible'' (1972) - Li Mu-Bai\n*''The Last Duel'' (1972) - Yi Chun\n*''Ten Fingers of Steel'' (1972) - Wang Yu, King of Boxers\n*''Royal Fist'' (1972)\n*''Boxers of Loyalty and Righteousness'' (1972) - Li Yu / Yeh Tian-Hsin\n*''[[A Man Called Tiger]]'' (1973) - Chin Fu\n*''Knight Errant'' (1973) - Lin Hao-Shan\n*''Ai de tian di'' (1973) - Professor\n*''Seaman No. 7'' (1973) - Wang Hai-Lung\n*''Black Friday'' (1973) - Chen Ah Kwang\n*''[[Beach of the War Gods]]'' (1973) - Hsia Feng\n*''The Two Cavaliers'' (1973)\n*''King of Boxers'' (1973) - Hong Ching Pau / Red Lantern\n*''Kung Fu Mama'' (1973) - Ma Yung-Chen\n*''The Tattooed Dragon'' (1973) - Tattooed Dragon\n*''Flying Fists of Death'' (1973)\n*''Si da tian wang'' (1974) - Hsiao Pao\n*''My Father, My Husband, My Son'' (1974)\n*''The Iron Man'' (1974) - Chin\n*''The Hero'' (1974) - Kang\n*''Four Real Friends'' (1974)\n*''Rage of the Masters'' (1975)\n*''[[The Man from Hong Kong]]'' (1975) - Inspector Fang Sing Leng\n*''A Cookbook of Birth Control'' (1975)\n*''The New Spartans'' (1975) - Material arts movie star Wang Fu\n*''Great Hunter'' (1975)\n*''[[Master of the Flying Guillotine]]'' (1976) - Liu Ti Lung, The One-Armed Boxer\n*''[[Tiger & Crane Fists]]'' (1976) - Ching Sing Chen\n*''[[Killer Meteors]]'' (1976) - Mei Xing He\n*''[[A Queen's Ransom]]'' (1976) - Jimmy\n*''[[One Armed Swordsman Against Nine Killers]]'' (1976) - Liu Ching Wu / Liu Yi Su / One Armed Swordsman\n*''[[One Arm Chivalry Fights Against One Arm Chivalry]]'' (1976) - Fong Ping / One-armed Swordsman\n*''Point of the Finger of Death'' (1977) - Ziqiang Ji (AKA Ziqiang Chi)\n*''[[Return of the Chinese Boxer]]'' (1977) - Sau Pai-lung\n*''The Criminal'' (1977)\n*''Brotherly Love'' (1977)\n*''Revenge of Kung Fu Mao'' (1977) - The Mayor\n*''Deadly Silver Spear'' (1977) - Lung Fei Yung / Silver Spear\n*''Blood of the Dragon'' (1978)\n*''Big Leap Forward'' (1978)\n*''Ma Su Chen'' (1979)\n*''Prisoners of Mao'' (1979)\n*''The Battle of Ku-ning-tou'' (1979)\n*''[[Fantasy Mission Force]]'' (1983) - Don Wen\n*''Shanghai'' (1984) - Black Hat\n*''Chuang jiang'' (1985)\n*''[[Millionaire's Express]]'' (1986) - Master Wong Kei Ying\n*''Thundering Ninja'' (1987) - David Wong\n*''[[Island of Fire]]'' (1990) - Kui / Lucas\n*''[[Once Upon a Time in China]]'' (1991)\n*''[[The Beheaded 1000]]'' (1991) - Executioner Ren De Tie\n*''Shogun & Little Kitchen'' (1992) - Lam Chung Yuen\n*''Requital'' (1992) - Wai's hired assassin\n*''Kyokut\u00f4 kuroshakai'' (1993) - Hong - Yan-Sheng\n*''[[Kung Pow!

This marriage, too, proved to be a stormy relationship and Wang Kaizhen filed for divorce. Maybe out of frustration, Wang Kaizhen started an affair with a young businessman Zhang Zhao (\u5f35\u662d). Having gotten wind of it, Wang, accompanied by reporters and the police, surprised the couple at their lodging and publicly exposed his wife.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} After public humiliation was heaped on the couple, Wang divorced his second wife in 1997.\n\nIn 1981, he faced a murder charge in Taiwan. However, the charge was eventually dropped before it could make it to court due to lack of evidence.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Wang's involvement in public brawls also made headlines from time to time.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 2011 Wang Yu suffered a stroke which caused him to lose much of his strength in the left side of his body.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} However, he worked vigorously at his physical therapy, even exceeding the doctor's recommended pace. Reportedly he would lift his arm 1000 times a day instead of 200, and he would walk three times the suggested distance. As a result of his efforts he can walk and talk almost normally,  and he can lift his left arm, though he can no longer use its full strength. Since then he has tried to live normally,  and has even returned to film work. He admitted to even driving to his physical therapy session with the use of only the one arm, but explained that his daughter put a stop to that when she found out and had hired him a driver.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Actor===\n{{Div col}}\n*''{{Interlanguage link multi|Temple of the Red Lotus|fr|Temple of the Red Lotus}}'' (1965) - Kuei Wu\n*''[[The Twin Swords]]'' (1965) - Kuei Wu\n*''Tiger Boy'' (1966) - 'Tiger Boy' Lei Hu\n*''{{Interlanguage link multi|The Magnificent Trio|fr|Le Trio magnifique}}'' (1966) - Fang Lu\n*''Kuai lo qing chun'' (1966)\n*''{{Interlanguage link multi|Asia-Pol|fr|Asia-Pol}}'' (1966) - Yang Ming-Hsuan\n*''{{Interlanguage link multi|Auntie Lan|fr|Auntie Lan}}'' (1967) - He You-Wen\n*''Trail of the Broken Blade'' (1967) - Li Yueh\n*''[[The Sword and the Lute]]'' (1967) - Kuei Wu\n*''[[One-Armed Swordsman]]'' (1967) - Fang Kang / One-armed Swordsman\n*''The Assassin'' (1967) - Nieh Cheng\n*''[[Golden Swallow (1968 film)|Golden Swallow]]'' (1968) - Silver Roc Hsiao Peng\n*''[[The Sword of Swords]]'' (1968) - Ling Tseng-hsiao\n*''Qing guan'' (1968)\n*''[[Return of the One-Armed Swordsman]]'' (1969) - Fang Gang / One-armed Swordsman\n*''My Son'' (1970) - Yang Kuo-Liang\n*''[[The Chinese Boxer]]'' (1970) - Lei Ming\n*''[[Zatoichi and the One-Armed Swordsman]]'' (1971) - Wang Kong / One-armed Swordsman\n*''The Desperate Chase'' (1971)\n*''Xia yi shuang xiong'' (1971)\n*''The Magnificent Chivalry'' (1971)\n*''Jian'' (1971) - Hsia Ho Wei\n*''Zhui ming qiang'' (1971) - Lung Ti / The White Dragon\n*''[[The Invincible Sword]]'' (1971) - Ling Yu Fong\n*''Wei zhen si fang'' (1971) - Tiger Wong\n*''[[The Professional Killer]]'' (1971)\n*''Morale and Evil'' (1971) - Iron palm Bai Si-Feng\n*''Shogun Saints'' (1972)\n*''[[Furious Slaughter]]'' (1972) - Ma Yung Shen\n*''Kuang feng sha'' (1972) - Ti Si-Guan\n*''Ma Su Zhen bao xiong chou'' (1972)\n*''The Adventure'' (1972) - Guan Dong-Shan\n*''[[Chow Ken]]'' (1972) - Shi Ling Shu\n*''[[One Armed Boxer]]'' (1972) - Yu Tien Lung\n*''Yi shen shi dan'' (1972) - The Gallant (parts 1, 2, 3)\n*''The Invincible'' (1972) - Li Mu-Bai\n*''The Last Duel'' (1972) - Yi Chun\n*''Ten Fingers of Steel'' (1972) - Wang Yu, King of Boxers\n*''Royal Fist'' (1972)\n*''Boxers of Loyalty and Righteousness'' (1972) - Li Yu / Yeh Tian-Hsin\n*''[[A Man Called Tiger]]'' (1973) - Chin Fu\n*''Knight Errant'' (1973) - Lin Hao-Shan\n*''Ai de tian di'' (1973) - Professor\n*''Seaman No. 7'' (1973) - Wang Hai-Lung\n*''Black Friday'' (1973) - Chen Ah Kwang\n*''[[Beach of the War Gods]]'' (1973) - Hsia Feng\n*''The Two Cavaliers'' (1973)\n*''King of Boxers'' (1973) - Hong Ching Pau / Red Lantern\n*''Kung Fu Mama'' (1973) - Ma Yung-Chen\n*''The Tattooed Dragon'' (1973) - Tattooed Dragon\n*''Flying Fists of Death'' (1973)\n*''Si da tian wang'' (1974) - Hsiao Pao\n*''My Father, My Husband, My Son'' (1974)\n*''The Iron Man'' (1974) - Chin\n*''The Hero'' (1974) - Kang\n*''Four Real Friends'' (1974)\n*''Rage of the Masters'' (1975)\n*''[[The Man from Hong Kong]]'' (1975) - Inspector Fang Sing Leng\n*''A Cookbook of Birth Control'' (1975)\n*''The New Spartans'' (1975) - Material arts movie star Wang Fu\n*''Great Hunter'' (1975)\n*''[[Master of the Flying Guillotine]]'' (1976) - Liu Ti Lung, The One-Armed Boxer\n*''[[Tiger & Crane Fists]]'' (1976) - Ching Sing Chen\n*''[[Killer Meteors]]'' (1976) - Mei Xing He\n*''[[A Queen's Ransom]]'' (1976) - Jimmy\n*''[[One Armed Swordsman Against Nine Killers]]'' (1976) - Liu Ching Wu / Liu Yi Su / One Armed Swordsman\n*''[[One Arm Chivalry Fights Against One Arm Chivalry]]'' (1976) - Fong Ping / One-armed Swordsman\n*''Point of the Finger of Death'' (1977) - Ziqiang Ji (AKA Ziqiang Chi)\n*''[[Return of the Chinese Boxer]]'' (1977) - Sau Pai-lung\n*''The Criminal'' (1977)\n*''Brotherly Love'' (1977)\n*''Revenge of Kung Fu Mao'' (1977) - The Mayor\n*''Deadly Silver Spear'' (1977) - Lung Fei Yung / Silver Spear\n*''Blood of the Dragon'' (1978)\n*''Big Leap Forward'' (1978)\n*''Ma Su Chen'' (1979)\n*''Prisoners of Mao'' (1979)\n*''The Battle of Ku-ning-tou'' (1979)\n*''[[Fantasy Mission Force]]'' (1983) - Don Wen\n*''Shanghai'' (1984) - Black Hat\n*''Chuang jiang'' (1985)\n*''[[Millionaire's Express]]'' (1986) - Master Wong Kei Ying\n*''Thundering Ninja'' (1987) - David Wong\n*''[[Island of Fire]]'' (1990) - Kui / Lucas\n*''[[Once Upon a Time in China]]'' (1991)\n*''[[The Beheaded 1000]]'' (1991) - Executioner Ren De Tie\n*''Shogun & Little Kitchen'' (1992) - Lam Chung Yuen\n*''Requital'' (1992) - Wai's hired assassin\n*''Kyokut\u00f4 kuroshakai'' (1993) - Hong - Yan-Sheng\n*''[[Kung Pow!

Structuralism posits the concept of [[binary opposition]], in which frequently used pairs of opposite but related words (concepts) are often arranged in a hierarchy, for example: Enlightenment/Romantic, male/female, speech/writing, rational/emotional, signified/signifier, symbolic/imaginary.\n\nPost-structuralism rejects the structuralist notion that the dominant word in a pair is dependent on its [[:wikt: subservient|subservient]] counterpart and instead argues that founding knowledge either on pure experience ([[Phenomenology_(philosophy)|phenomenology]]) or systematic structures (Structuralism) is impossible because history and culture condition the study of underlying structures and these are subject to biases and misinterpretations. This impossibility was not meant as a failure or loss, but rather as a cause for \"celebration and liberation\".<ref name=\"Colebrook\">{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDi6guWdpfIC&pg=PA2 |title = Gilles Deleuze|isbn = 9781134578023|last1 = Colebrook|first1 = Claire|date = 2002|publisher=Routledge|p=2|series=Routledge Critical Thinkers}}</ref> A post-structuralist approach argues that to understand an object (e.g., a text), it is necessary to study both the object itself and the systems of knowledge that produced the object.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.3817/0383055195|title=Structuralism and Post-Structuralism: An Interview with Michel Foucault|journal=Telos|volume=1983|issue=55|pages=195\u2013211|year=1983|last1=Raulet|first1=Gerard}}</ref> The uncertain distance between structuralism and post-structuralism is further blurred by the fact that scholars rarely label themselves as post-structuralists.

American philosopher [[John Searle]]<ref>Searle, John. (1990). \"[http://www.ditext.com/searle/searle1.html The Storm Over the University],\" in The [[New York Times Review of Books]], 6 December 1990.</ref> argued in 1990 that \"The spread of 'poststructuralist' literary theory is perhaps the best-known example of a silly but non-catastrophic phenomenon.\" Similarly, physicist [[Alan Sokal]]<ref>Sokal, Alan. (1997) \"[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/le_monde_english.html Professor Latour's Philosophical Mystifications],\" originally published in French in ''[[Le Monde]]'', 31 January 1997; translated by the author.</ref> in 1997 criticized \"the postmodernist/poststructuralist gibberish that is now [[hegemonic]] in some sectors of the American academy.\" Literature scholar [[Norman Holland]] argued that post-structuralism was flawed due to reliance on Saussure's linguistic model, which was seriously challenged by the 1950s and was soon abandoned by linguists: \"Saussure's views are not held, so far as I know, by modern linguists, only by literary critics and the occasional philosopher. [Strict adherence to Saussure] has elicited wrong film and literary theory on a grand scale. One can find dozens of books of literary theory bogged down in signifiers and signifieds, but only a handful that refers to [[Chomsky]].\"<ref>Holland, Norman N. (1992) The Critical I, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-07650-9}}, p. 140.</ref>\n\n[[David Foster Wallace]] wrote:\n{{quote|The deconstructionists (\"deconstructionist\" and \"poststructuralist\" mean the same thing, by the way: \"poststructuralist\" is what you call a deconstructionist who doesn't want to be called a deconstructionist)&nbsp;... see the debate over the ownership of meaning as a skirmish in a larger war in Western philosophy over the idea that presence and unity are ontologically prior to expression. There\u2019s been this longstanding deluded presumption, they think, that if there is an utterance then there must exist a unified, efficacious presence that causes and owns that utterance. The poststructuralists attack what they see as a post-Platonic prejudice in favour of presence over absence and speech over writing. We tend to trust speech over writing because of the immediacy of the speaker: he's right there, and we can grab him by the lapels and look into his face and figure out just exactly what one single thing he means. But the reason why poststructuralists are in the literary theory business at all is that they see writing, not speech, as more faithful to the metaphysics of true expression. For Barthes, Derrida, and Foucault, writing is a better animal than speech because it is iterable; it is iterable because it is abstract; and it is abstract because it is a function not of presence but of absence: the reader\u2019s absent when the writer\u2019s writing and the writer's absent when the reader's reading.\n\nFor a deconstructionist, then, a writer's circumstances and intentions are indeed a part of the \"context\" of a text, but context imposes no real cinctures on the text's meaning because meaning in language requires cultivation of absence rather than presence, involves not the imposition but the erasure of consciousness. This is so because these guys\u2013Derrida following Heidegger and Barthes Mallarme and Foucault God knows who\u2013see literary language as not a tool but an environment. A writer does not wield language; he is subsumed in it. Language speaks us; writing writes; etc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://biblioklept.org/2010/12/22/david-foster-wallace-defines-poststructuralism/|title=David Foster Wallace Describes Poststructuralism|last=Biblioklept|date=2010-12-22|website=Biblioklept|access-date=2017-05-25}}</ref>}}\n\n== History ==\nPost-structuralism emerged in [[France]] during the 1960s as a movement critiquing [[structuralism]]. According to [[Jos\u00e9 Guilherme Merquior|J.&nbsp;G. Merquior]]<ref name=\"Merquior1987\"/> a [[love\u2013hate relationship]] with structuralism developed among many leading French thinkers in the 1960s.\n\nIn a 1966 lecture \"[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences]]\", Jacques Derrida presented a thesis on an apparent rupture in intellectual life. Derrida interpreted this event as a \"decentering\" of the former intellectual cosmos. Instead of progress or divergence from an identified centre, Derrida described this \"event\" as a kind of \"play.\"\n\nIn 1967, Barthes published [[Death of the author|\"The Death of the Author\"]] in which he announced a metaphorical event: the \"death\" of the author as an authentic source of meaning for a given text. Barthes argued that any literary text has multiple meanings and that the author was not the prime source of the work's semantic content.  The \"Death of the Author,\" Barthes maintained, was the \"Birth of the Reader,\" as the source of the proliferation of meanings of the text.\n \nThe period was marked by the rebellion of students and workers against the state in [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]].\n\n== Major works ==\n\n===Barthes and the need for metalanguage===\nBarthes in his work, ''Elements of Semiology'' (1967), advanced the concept of the \"[[metalanguage]]\". A metalanguage is a systematized way of talking about concepts like meaning and grammar beyond the constraints of a traditional (first-order) language; in a metalanguage, symbols replace words and phrases. Insofar as one metalanguage is required for one explanation of the first-order language, another may be required, so metalanguages may actually replace first-order languages.  Barthes exposes how this structuralist system is regressive; orders of language rely upon a metalanguage by which it is explained, and therefore [[deconstruction]] itself is in danger of becoming a metalanguage, thus exposing all languages and discourse to scrutiny. Barthes' other works contributed deconstructive theories about texts.\n\n=== Derrida's lecture at Johns Hopkins ===\nThe occasional designation of Post-structuralism as a movement can be tied to the fact that mounting criticism of Structuralism became evident at approximately the same time that Structuralism became a topic of interest in universities in the United States. This interest led to a colloquium at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1966 titled \"The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man\", to which such French philosophers as Derrida, Barthes, and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] were invited to speak.\n\nDerrida's lecture at that conference, \"[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences|Structure, Sign, and Play in the Human Sciences]]\", was one of the earliest to propose some theoretical limitations to Structuralism, and to attempt to theorize on terms that were clearly no longer structuralist.\n\nThe element of \"play\" in the title of Derrida's essay is often erroneously interpreted in a linguistic sense, based on a general tendency towards puns and humour, while [[social constructionism]] as developed in the later work of Michel Foucault is said to create play in the sense of strategic agency by laying bare the levers of historical change<!--what are the \"levers of historical change\" specifically?-->.

Structuralism posits the concept of [[binary opposition]], in which frequently used pairs of opposite but related words (concepts) are often arranged in a hierarchy, for example: Enlightenment/Romantic, male/female, speech/writing, rational/emotional, signified/signifier, symbolic/imaginary.\n\nPost-structuralism rejects the structuralist notion that the dominant word in a pair is dependent on its [[:wikt: subservient|subservient]] counterpart and instead argues that founding knowledge either on pure experience ([[Phenomenology_(philosophy)|phenomenology]]) or systematic structures (Structuralism) is impossible because history and culture condition the study of underlying structures and these are subject to biases and misinterpretations.

American philosopher [[John Searle]]<ref>Searle, John. (1990). \"[http://www.ditext.com/searle/searle1.html The Storm Over the University],\" in The [[New York Times Review of Books]], 6 December 1990.</ref> argued in 1990 that \"The spread of 'poststructuralist' literary theory is perhaps the best-known example of a silly but non-catastrophic phenomenon.\" Similarly, physicist [[Alan Sokal]]<ref>Sokal, Alan. (1997) \"[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/le_monde_english.html Professor Latour's Philosophical Mystifications],\" originally published in French in ''[[Le Monde]]'', 31 January 1997; translated by the author.</ref> in 1997 criticized \"the postmodernist/poststructuralist gibberish that is now [[hegemonic]] in some sectors of the American academy.\" Literature scholar [[Norman Holland]] argued that post-structuralism was flawed due to reliance on Saussure's linguistic model, which was seriously challenged by the 1950s and was soon abandoned by linguists: \"Saussure's views are not held, so far as I know, by modern linguists, only by literary critics and the occasional philosopher. [Strict adherence to Saussure] has elicited wrong film and literary theory on a grand scale. One can find dozens of books of literary theory bogged down in signifiers and signifieds, but only a handful that refers to [[Chomsky]].\"<ref>Holland, Norman N. (1992) The Critical I, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-07650-9}}, p. 140.</ref>\n\n[[David Foster Wallace]] wrote:\n{{quote|The deconstructionists (\"deconstructionist\" and \"poststructuralist\" mean the same thing, by the way: \"poststructuralist\" is what you call a deconstructionist who doesn't want to be called a deconstructionist)&nbsp;... see the debate over the ownership of meaning as a skirmish in a larger war in Western philosophy over the idea that presence and unity are ontologically prior to expression. There\u2019s been this longstanding deluded presumption, they think, that if there is an utterance then there must exist a unified, efficacious presence that causes and owns that utterance. The poststructuralists attack what they see as a post-Platonic prejudice in favour of presence over absence and speech over writing. We tend to trust speech over writing because of the immediacy of the speaker: he's right there, and we can grab him by the lapels and look into his face and figure out just exactly what one single thing he means. But the reason why poststructuralists are in the literary theory business at all is that they see writing, not speech, as more faithful to the metaphysics of true expression. For Barthes, Derrida, and Foucault, writing is a better animal than speech because it is iterable; it is iterable because it is abstract; and it is abstract because it is a function not of presence but of absence: the reader\u2019s absent when the writer\u2019s writing and the writer's absent when the reader's reading.\n\nFor a deconstructionist, then, a writer's circumstances and intentions are indeed a part of the \"context\" of a text, but context imposes no real cinctures on the text's meaning because meaning in language requires cultivation of absence rather than presence, involves not the imposition but the erasure of consciousness. This is so because these guys\u2013Derrida following Heidegger and Barthes Mallarme and Foucault God knows who\u2013see literary language as not a tool but an environment. A writer does not wield language; he is subsumed in it. Language speaks us; writing writes; etc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://biblioklept.org/2010/12/22/david-foster-wallace-defines-poststructuralism/|title=David Foster Wallace Describes Poststructuralism|last=Biblioklept|date=2010-12-22|website=Biblioklept|access-date=2017-05-25}}</ref>}}\n\n== History ==\nPost-structuralism emerged in [[France]] during the 1960s as a movement critiquing [[structuralism]]. According to [[Jos\u00e9 Guilherme Merquior|J.&nbsp;G. Merquior]]<ref name=\"Merquior1987\"/> a [[love\u2013hate relationship]] with structuralism developed among many leading French thinkers in the 1960s.\n\nIn a 1966 lecture \"[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences]]\", Jacques Derrida presented a thesis on an apparent rupture in intellectual life. Derrida interpreted this event as a \"decentering\" of the former intellectual cosmos. Instead of progress or divergence from an identified centre, Derrida described this \"event\" as a kind of \"play.\"\n\nIn 1967, Barthes published [[Death of the author|\"The Death of the Author\"]] in which he announced a metaphorical event: the \"death\" of the author as an authentic source of meaning for a given text. Barthes argued that any literary text has multiple meanings and that the author was not the prime source of the work's semantic content.  The \"Death of the Author,\" Barthes maintained, was the \"Birth of the Reader,\" as the source of the proliferation of meanings of the text.\n \nThe period was marked by the rebellion of students and workers against the state in [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]].\n\n== Major works ==\n\n===Barthes and the need for metalanguage===\nBarthes in his work, ''Elements of Semiology'' (1967), advanced the concept of the \"[[metalanguage]]\". A metalanguage is a systematized way of talking about concepts like meaning and grammar beyond the constraints of a traditional (first-order) language; in a metalanguage, symbols replace words and phrases. Insofar as one metalanguage is required for one explanation of the first-order language, another may be required, so metalanguages may actually replace first-order languages.  Barthes exposes how this structuralist system is regressive; orders of language rely upon a metalanguage by which it is explained, and therefore [[deconstruction]] itself is in danger of becoming a metalanguage, thus exposing all languages and discourse to scrutiny. Barthes' other works contributed deconstructive theories about texts.\n\n=== Derrida's lecture at Johns Hopkins ===\nThe occasional designation of Post-structuralism as a movement can be tied to the fact that mounting criticism of Structuralism became evident at approximately the same time that Structuralism became a topic of interest in universities in the United States. This interest led to a colloquium at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1966 titled \"The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man\", to which such French philosophers as Derrida, Barthes, and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] were invited to speak.\n\nDerrida's lecture at that conference, \"[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences|Structure, Sign, and Play in the Human Sciences]]\", was one of the earliest to propose some theoretical limitations to Structuralism, and to attempt to theorize on terms that were clearly no longer structuralist.\n\nThe element of \"play\" in the title of Derrida's essay is often erroneously interpreted in a linguistic sense, based on a general tendency towards puns and humour, while [[social constructionism]] as developed in the later work of Michel Foucault is said to create play in the sense of strategic agency by laying bare the levers of historical change<!--what are the \"levers of historical change\" specifically?-->. Many see the importance of Foucault's work to be in its synthesis of this social/historical account of the operation of power (see [[governmentality]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Development criticism]]\n* [[Narrative therapy]]\n* [[Post-postmodernism]]\n* [[Post-structuralist subject]]\n* [[Reader-response criticism]]\n* [[Semiotics]]\n* [[Social criticism]]\n* [[Social theory]]\n}}\n\n===Authors===\nThe following are often said to be post-structuralists, or to have had a post-structuralist period:\n{{div col|colwidth=12em}}\n* [[Kathy Acker]]\n* [[Jean Baudrillard]]\n* [[Roland Barthes]]\n* [[Wendy Brown (political theorist)|Wendy Brown]] \n* [[Judith Butler]]\n* [[Rey Chow]]\n* [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous]]\n* [[Gilles Deleuze]]\n* [[Jacques Derrida]]\n* [[Umberto Eco]]\n* [[John Fiske (media studies)|John Fiske]]\n* [[Michel Foucault]]\n* [[Ren\u00e9 Girard]]\n* [[F\u00e9lix Guattari]]\n* [[Luce Irigaray]]\n* [[Julia Kristeva]]\n* [[Teresa de Lauretis]]\n* [[Sarah Kofman]]\n* [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]]\n* [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]]\n* [[Chantal Mouffe]]\n* [[Jean-Luc Nancy]]\n* [[Avital Ronell]]\n* [[Bernard Stiegler]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* [[Johannes Angermuller|Angermuller, J.]] (2015): ''Why There Is No Poststructuralism in France.

The three ships\u2014{{HMS|Furious|47|2}}, {{HMS|Courageous|50|2}} and {{HMS|Glorious||2}}\u2014were originally laid down as [[Courageous-class battlecruiser]]s as part of the [[Baltic Project]] during the [[Naval warfare of World War I|First World War]]. While very fast, their minimal armour and few guns limited their long-term utility in the post-war Royal Navy, and they were [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|laid up]] after the war. They were considered [[capital ship]]s by the terms of the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and were included in the total amount of tonnage allowed to the Royal Navy. Rather than [[ship breaking|scrap]] them, the Navy decided to convert them to aircraft carriers as permitted under the Treaty.\n\n''Furious'', already partially converted during the war, began her reconstruction in 1921, before the Treaty came into effect. In an attempt to minimise air turbulence, she was given no [[superstructure]] or [[Glossary of nautical terms#I|island]]. This was not entirely satisfactory, and a small island was added in 1939. Another problem was that she lacked a standard [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]; instead, her [[boiler]] uptakes ran along the sides of the ship and exhausted out of gratings on the rear of the [[flight deck]], or at the sides of the ship if landing operations were in progress. The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity, and the exhaust gases were as much of a problem for landing aircraft as the turbulence would have been. Her [[sister ship|half-sisters]], ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'', began their conversions to aircraft carriers as ''Furious'' neared completion. They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since ''Furious'' had been designed and incorporated an island with a funnel, increasing their aircraft capacity by one-third and making it safer to land.\n\nAs the first large carrier completed by the Royal Navy, ''Furious'' was extensively used to evaluate aircraft handling and landing procedures, including the first-ever carrier night landing in 1926. ''Courageous'' became the first warship lost by the Royal Navy in the Second World War when she was [[torpedo]]ed in September 1939 by a German [[U-boat|submarine]]. ''Glorious'' participated in the [[Norwegian campaign]] in 1940, but she was sunk by two German [[battleship]]s in June as she sailed home with a minimal escort. ''Furious'' participated in many major operations during the war, including the Norwegian campaign in 1940, the [[Malta Convoys]] and ''[[Operation Torch]]'' in 1942, and airstrikes on the {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz}} and other targets in Norway in 1944. The ship was worn out by 1944 and was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] status in September 1944 before being [[Ship commissioning#Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in 1945 and sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1948.\n\n== Careers as battlecruisers ==\n{{Main|Courageous-class battlecruiser}}\n\n[[File:HMS Glorious (1917) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|''Glorious'' as a battlecruiser]]\nThe first two ships of the class, ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'', spent the First World War on [[North Sea]] patrols, climaxing in the [[Second Battle of Heligoland Bight]] in November 1917. Their half-sister ''Furious'' was designed with a pair of {{convert|18|in|0|adj=on}} guns\u2014as opposed to four {{convert|15|in|0|adj=on}}\u2014but was modified while being built to hold a flying-off deck and [[hangar]] in lieu of her forward [[gun turret|turret]] and [[barbette]]. She made some patrols in the North Sea before her rear turret was removed and another flight deck added. Her aircraft attacked [[Zeppelin]] sheds during the [[Tondern raid]] in July 1918.<ref>Roberts, p. 123</ref>\n\nAll three ships were reduced to reserve after the war. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited the signatory nations to a set amount of capital ship tonnage; all ships in excess of this figure had to be scrapped. Up to {{convert|66000|LT|t|lk=on}} of existing ships could be converted into aircraft carriers, and the Royal Navy decided to use the ''Courageous''-class ships due to their high speed. Each ship was reconstructed with a flight deck during the 1920s.<ref>Friedman, p. 97</ref>\n\n== Conversions ==\n[[File:HMS Furious-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Furious'' as she was during the First World War with separate take-off and landing decks and superstructure in between]]\n[[File:Dunning Landing-on Furious In Pup.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Sopwith Pup]] unsuccessfully attempting to land on ''Furious''{{'}}s forward flight deck, 7 August 1917]]\n{{HMS|Furious|47|2}} had been fitted during the First World War with a flying-off and landing deck, but the latter proved largely unusable because of the strong air currents around the superstructure and exhaust gases from the funnel. She was laid up after the war, but was converted to an aircraft carrier between June 1921 and September 1925. Her design was based on the very limited experience gained with the first two British carriers: {{HMS|Argus|I49|2}}, less than three years old, and {{HMS|Eagle|1918|2}}, which had carried out only 143 deck landings during preliminary [[sea trial]]s in 1920.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 263\u2013267</ref><ref>Burt 2012, p. 252</ref><ref>Brown, p. 252</ref>\n\n''Furious''{{'}}s superstructure, masts, funnel and landing deck were removed and she was given a {{convert|576|by|92|ft|m|1|adj=on}} flight deck that extended over three-quarters of her length. This flight deck was not level; it sloped upwards about three-quarters of the way from the stern to help slow down landing aircraft, which had no brakes at the time it was designed. That era's fore-and-aft [[arresting gear]], initially {{convert|320|ft|1}} long on ''Furious'', was not intended to stop landing aircraft\u2014the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind\u2014but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and potentially falling off the flight deck. Various designs for the flight deck were tested in a wind tunnel by the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] which showed that the distinctive elliptical shape and rounded edges minimised turbulence. To minimise any turbulence over the flight deck, ''Furious'' was flush-decked and lacked an island, like ''Argus''; instead she was provided with a retractable [[Glossary of nautical terms#C|charthouse]] at the forward end of the flight deck.<ref>Friedman, pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nA two-[[storey]] hangar was built under the flight deck, each level being {{convert|15|ft|1|abbr=on}} high. The lower hangar was {{convert|550|ft|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|35|-|50|ft|1|abbr=on}} wide and the upper was {{convert|520|by|50|ft|1|abbr=on}}. Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers. Her boilers were ducted down the side of the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck, or, when landing operations were in progress, out of the side of the lower hangar at the rear of the ship. This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space, made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree. Her original flying-off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] so that the ship could simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck and could speedily launch her aircraft from both decks. Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 264\u2013265</ref> Two {{convert|47|by|46|ft|m|adj=on|1}} lifts (elevators) were installed to transfer aircraft between the flight deck and hangars. Two {{convert|600|impgal|l USgal|adj=on}} ready-use [[petrol]] tanks were provided for aircraft and the ship's boats on the upper deck. An additional {{convert|20000|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol were in bulk storage. The longitudinal arresting gear proved unpopular in service and it was ordered removed in 1927 after tests aboard ''Furious'' in 1926 had shown that deck-edge palisades were effective in reducing cross-deck gusts that could blow aircraft over the side.<ref>Friedman, pp. 94\u201395</ref> ''Furious''{{'}}s long exhaust ducting hampered landing operations, and restricted the size of the hangars and thus the number of aircraft that she could carry.<ref name=\"Friedmanpp\">Friedman, pp. 103, 105\u2013106</ref>\n\n''Glorious'' and ''Courageous'' were converted to aircraft carriers after ''Furious'' began her reconstruction, ''Courageous'' at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] starting on 29 June 1924, and ''Glorious'' at [[Rosyth]] on 14 February 1924. The latter was moved to Devonport to complete the conversion after ''Furious'' was finished. Their design was based on ''Furious'' with a few improvements based on experience gained since she was designed. All superstructure, guns, and fittings down to the main deck were removed. A two-storey hangar, each level {{convert|16|ft|1|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|550|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} long, was built on top of the remaining hull; the upper hangar level opened onto a short flying-off deck, below and forward of the main flight deck. Two slightly larger {{convert|46|by|48|ft|m|adj=on|1}} lifts were installed fore and aft in the flight deck. An island was added on the starboard side with the bridge, flying control station, and funnel, as an island did not create as much turbulence as had been earlier feared. By 1939 both ships could carry {{convert|34500|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol.<ref name=\"Friedmanpp\" />\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:HMS Glorious underway 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of ''Glorious'', 1936]]\nThe ''Courageous''-class ships had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|786|ft|9|in|m|1|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|90|ft|6|in|m|1|abbr=on}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|28|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} at [[deep load]].

The guns fired a {{convert|31|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[Explosive material#High explosives|high explosive]] (HE) shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2387|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of 10 to 15 rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|31000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective range of much less.<ref>Campbell, p. 58</ref> The four guns on the flying-off deck were removed during trials of the lower flight deck in 1926\u20131927, but only two were replaced when the trials were concluded.<ref name=f9>Friedman, p. 109</ref>\n\nFour single [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder ''pom-poms'']] were installed by 1927.<ref name=f9 /> During ''Furious''{{'}}s September 1930 \u2013 February 1932 refit, her anti-aircraft outfit was changed by the substitution of two 8-barrel 2-pounder ''pom-pom'' mounts for the forward 4-inch guns on the flying-off deck removed earlier.<ref name=b69>Burt 2012, p. 276</ref> The Mark V mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 80\u00b0. The Mark VIII 2-pounder gun fired a {{convert|40|mm|adj=on|order=flip}} {{convert|0.91|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1920|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to a distance of {{convert|3800|yd|m}}. The gun's rate of fire was approximately 96\u201398 rounds per minute.<ref>Campbell, pp. 71\u201374</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|5.5|in|adj=on}} and {{convert|4|in|adj=on|0}} guns were replaced during ''Furious''{{'}}s refit in early 1939 by a dozen [[QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun|QF 4-inch Mk XVI guns]] in twin [[dual purpose gun|dual-purpose]] Mark XIX mounts. One mount each was on the former flying-off deck and the quarterdeck while the other four were mounted two per side.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 268\u201369, 276</ref> The Mark XIX mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 80\u00b0. The Mark XVI gun fired  fifteen to twenty {{convert|35|lb|kg|adj=on}} HE shells per minute at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2660|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Against surface targets it had a range of {{convert|19850|yd|m|abbr=on}} and a maximum ceiling of {{convert|31000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective anti-aircraft range of much less.<ref>Campbell, p. 56</ref> Two more Mark V 2-pounder mounts were added fore and aft of the newly added island at the same time.<ref name=b69 />\n\nDuring the Second World War, ''Furious'', the only surviving ship of the three, received an eventual total of 22 manually operated automatic [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20&nbsp;mm Oerlikon]] light anti-aircraft (AA) guns, which replaced the single quadruple Vickers 0.50-calibre machine gun mount.<ref name=f9 /> The Oerlikon fired a {{convert|0.272|lb|adj=on}} HE shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2750|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. The maximum ceiling was 10,000 ft and the maximum range was {{convert|4800|yd|abbr=on}} although the effective range was under {{convert|1000|yd|abbr=on}}. The cyclic rate of fire was 450 rounds per minute, but the practical rate was between 250 and 320 rounds per minute owing to the need to reload [[magazine (firearms)|magazines]].<ref>Campbell, pp. 75\u201376</ref>\n\nA mix of single-purpose anti-surface and anti-aircraft guns in various sizes was considered for ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' by the [[Admiralty]], but was ultimately rejected for a dual-purpose armament of sixteen [[QF 4.7 inch Mk VIII naval gun|QF 4.7-inch Mark VIII]] guns in single high-angle mounts. One mount was on each side of the lower flight deck and a pair were on the quarterdeck. The remaining twelve mounts were distributed along the sides of each ship.<ref name=b83 /> These mounts could depress to \u22125\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 90\u00b0. The Mark VIII guns fired a {{convert|50|lb|kg|adj=on}} HE shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2457|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of 8\u201312 rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|32000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective range of much less. They had a maximum range of {{convert|16160|yd|m|abbr=on}} against surface targets.<ref>Campbell, p. 51</ref>\n\nDuring refits in the mid-1930s, both ships received multiple 2-pounder ''pom-pom'' mounts. ''Courageous'' received three quadruple Mark VII mounts, one on each side of the flying-off deck, forward of the 4.7-inch guns, and one behind the island on the flight deck (two of these were transferred from the battleship {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|05|2}}). ''Glorious'' received three octuple Mark VI mounts in the same locations. Both ships received four water-cooled [[Vickers .50 machine gun|0.50-calibre Mark III]] [[machine gun]]s in a single quadruple mounting.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 157, 286</ref> This mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 70\u00b0. The machine guns fired a {{convert|1.326|oz|adj=on}} bullet at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2520|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. This gave the gun a maximum range of about {{convert|5000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, although its effective range was only {{convert|800|yd|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Campbell, p. 78</ref> Neither ship had any further guns added before they were sunk early in the war,<ref name=f9 /> in 1939 and 1940, respectively.\n\n=== Fire control and radar ===\nTo assist its weapon systems in hitting their target, ''Furious'' was completed with one [[fire-control system]] for each side, with separate [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|directors]] for low-angle and high-angle guns. The 5.5-inch guns were centrally controlled by a [[Frederic Charles Dreyer#Dreyer Fire Control Table|Dreyer Fire-Control Table]] on the lower deck while the 4-inch guns had their mechanical computers next to their directors.<ref name=f5 /> The existing fire-control directors were removed when ''Furious'' received her new dual-purpose 4-inch mountings in 1939. New high-angle directors, including two for the ''pom-poms'', were mounted on top of the new island and on the former lower flight deck. Over the course of the war [[Type 285 radar|Type 285]] gunnery [[radar]]s were mounted on top of the high-angle directors. She also received a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 290|Type 290]] air-search radar.<ref name=f9 />\n\n''Courageous'' was initially fitted only with low-angle directors for her guns, but these were replaced by dual-purpose directors when she was refitted in 1930. (''Glorious'', completed later, had hers from the beginning.) Neither ship was fitted with radar before its early loss.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u201386</ref>\n\n=== Protection ===\nLittle armour other than that of the [[barbette]]s was removed during their conversion to aircraft carriers. The transverse bulkheads were carried through the locations of the former barbettes. The flight deck was {{convert|0.625|in|mm}} in thickness.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 273, 282</ref>\n\nUnlike other British battlecruisers, the bulk of the armour of the ''Courageous''-class ships was made from [[Ultimate tensile strength|high-tensile]] steel (HTS), a type of steel used structurally in other ships. Their waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] consisted of {{convert|2|in|0}} of HTS covered by a {{convert|1|in|0|adj=on}} thick mild steel skin. It protected roughly the middle two-thirds of the ship with a one-inch extension forward to the two-inch forward transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] well short of the bow. The belt had a height of {{convert|23|ft|m|0}}, of which {{convert|18|in|m|1}} was below the designed waterline. From the former forward barbette, a 3-inch bulkhead extended out to the ship's side between the upper and lower decks and a comparable bulkhead was in place at the former location of the rear barbette as well. Four decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from {{convert|0.75|\u2013|3|in}}, thickest over the magazines and the steering gear. After the [[Battle of Jutland]], {{convert|110|LT|t}} of extra protection was added to the deck around the magazines.<ref>Burt 1986, pp. 308, 313</ref>\n\nThe [[torpedo bulkhead]]s were increased during building from 0.75\u2013{{convert|1.5|in|abbr=on}} in thickness.<ref>Roberts, pp. 54, 106, 113</ref> All three ships were fitted with a shallow [[anti-torpedo bulge]] integral to the hull, which was intended to detonate the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and deflect the underwater explosion to the surface, away from the ship. Later testing proved that it was not deep enough to accomplish its task and that it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force of the explosion.<ref>Roberts, p. 111</ref>\n\n=== Air groups ===\n[[File:HMS Furious-15.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Furious'' in the mid-1930s with a flight of [[Blackburn Baffin]] torpedo bombers overhead]]\nNormally, ''Furious'' could carry only about 36 aircraft. In the 1920s this commonly meant one flight (squadrons after 1932) of fighters ([[Fairey Flycatcher]]), two of spotters ([[Blackburn Blackburn]] or [[Avro Bison]]), one spotter reconnaissance ([[Fairey III]]D) and two flights of torpedo bombers ([[Blackburn Dart]]). In 1935 there was one squadron of fighters with [[Hawker Nimrod]]s and [[Hawker Osprey]]s, one squadron of [[Blackburn Baffin]] torpedo bombers and one squadron of Fairey IIIF spotters. During the Second World War, the carrier typically carried a single fighter squadron and two of strike aircraft of various types, although the mix was often adjusted for specific missions.<ref name=b69 />\n\n''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' were generally similar except that they carried a total of 48 aircraft. They commonly flew the same types of aircraft as ''Furious'', although they are also known to have flown the [[Fairey Seal]], the [[Blackburn Shark]], and the [[Blackburn Ripon]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 284</ref>\n\n== Pre-war service ==\n''Furious'' was assigned to the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] after commissioning in 1925, although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA) inventory. These included landing and flying-off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher [[floatplane]]s, with and without wheels, to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats. The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty. A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily.<ref name=f9 /><ref>Burt 2012, pp. 270\u2013272</ref> The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards. Deck-edge [[palisade]]s ([[windbreak]]s) were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side in rough weather.<ref name=f5 /><ref>Jenkins, p. 271</ref> The first carrier night-landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard ''Furious''.<ref>Jenkins, p. 274</ref>\n\nThe ship was reduced to reserve status on 1 July 1930 in preparation for a lengthy overhaul at Devonport from September 1930 to February 1932, focused on refitting her machinery and re-tubing her boilers.<ref name=b0>Burt 2012, p. 270</ref> In addition her quarterdeck was raised by one deck, the AA armament was revised and water spraying facilities were fitted in the hangars.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 275\u2013276</ref> Upon completion she ran a full-power trial on 16 February 1932 where her maximum speed was {{convert|28.8|kn|abbr=on}} from a total of {{convert|89754|shp|abbr=on}}.<ref name=b0 />\n\n''Furious'' was recommissioned in May 1932 as part of the Home Fleet with a reduced crew before being brought up to full complement in November.<ref name=j6>Jenkins, p. 276</ref> Transverse arresting gear was fitted sometime during the mid-1930s. She was detached to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] from May to October 1934. ''Furious'' was present at the Coronation [[Fleet Review]] at [[Spithead]] on 20 May 1937 for King [[George VI]]. She became a deck-landing training carrier in 1937, although she was refitted between December 1937 and May 1938 in Devonport, where the forward end of her lower flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward. During the [[Munich Crisis]] in September 1938, she embarked Nos. [[801 Naval Air Squadron|801]], [[821 Naval Air Squadron|821]] and [[822 Naval Air Squadron|822 Squadrons]] and joined the fleet at [[Scapa Flow]], before resuming her training duties after the peaceful conclusion of the affair.<ref name=\"b69\" /><ref name=j6 />\n\nShe was given a more extensive refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5.5-inch guns and palisades, mounted AA guns on her flying-off deck, plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar, and gave her a small island on the starboard side. ''Furious'' resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 277\u2013278</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Courageous (50).jpg|thumb|left|''Courageous'' at anchor ({{circa|1935}})]]\n''Courageous'' was recommissioned on 21 February 1928 and assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet from May 1928 to June 1930. She was relieved by ''Glorious'' and refitted from June to August 1930. The ship was assigned to the Atlantic and Home Fleets from 12 August 1930 to December 1938 aside from a temporary attachment to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1936. In the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed and she received two hydraulic [[aircraft catapult|catapults]] on the upper flight deck before March 1934. ''Courageous'' was refitted again between October 1935 and June 1936 and received her ''pom-pom'' mounts. She was also present at the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review. She became a training carrier in December 1938 when {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} joined the Home Fleet and continued on that duty until the start of the Second World War.<ref name=b15>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u2013286, 290</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Glorious anchored.jpg|thumb|right|''Glorious'' at anchor (circa 1934)]]\n''Glorious'' was recommissioned on 24 February 1930 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet, but was attached to the Home Fleet from March to June 1930. She relieved ''Courageous'' in the Mediterranean Fleet in June 1930 and remained there until October 1939. In a fog on 1 April 1931 ''Glorious'' rammed SS ''Florida'' amidships while steaming at {{convert|16|knots|abbr=on}}. The impact crumpled {{convert|60|ft|1|abbr=on}} of the flying-off deck and forced ''Glorious'' to put into [[Gibdock|Gibraltar]] for temporary repairs. She had to sail to [[Malta Dockyard|Malta]] for permanent repairs which lasted until September 1931. Sometime in the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed. She was refitted at Devonport from July 1934 to July 1935 where she received two catapults, her flight deck was extended to the rear, her quarterdeck was raised one deck and she received her multiple ''pom-pom'' mounts. ''Glorious'' also participated in the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review before returning to the Mediterranean.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u2013288</ref>\n\n== Second World War ==\n=== ''Courageous'' ===\n[[File:HMS Courageous sinking.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Courageous'' sinking]]\nIn the early days of the war, [[Hunter-killer Group|hunter-killer groups]] were formed around the fleet aircraft carriers to find and destroy U-boats. On 17 September 1939, two torpedoes from {{GS|U-29|1936|2}} turned the tables, and ''Courageous'' became the first British warship sunk in the Second World War. As ''Ark Royal'' had been surprised by a near-miss seven days earlier, the fleet carriers were withdrawn from this duty.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 1\u20133</ref>\n\n=== ''Glorious'' ===\nForce J, including ''Glorious'', was organised to hunt for the {{ship|German pocket battleship|Admiral Graf Spee}} in the Indian Ocean. They were not successful, and ''Glorious'' remained in the Indian Ocean until December when she was transferred to the Mediterranean.\n\n''Glorious'' was recalled to the Home Fleet in April 1940 to provide air cover for British forces landing in [[Norwegian Campaign|Norway]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 285</ref> [[Gloster Gladiators]] of [[No. 263 Squadron RAF]] were flown aboard to be transferred to Norwegian airbases. ''Glorious'' and ''Ark Royal'' arrived off central Norway on 24 April where 263 Squadron was flown off and their organic aircraft attacked targets in the [[Trondheim]] area before ''Glorious'' had to return to Scapa Flow on 27 April to refuel and embark new aircraft. She returned on 1 May, after failing to load new aircraft because of poor weather. The task force was under heavy air attack by the [[Luftwaffe]] all day and was withdrawn that evening.<ref>Haarr, pp. 143\u2013154</ref>\n\n''Glorious'' returned on 18 May with six [[Supermarine Walrus]] [[Amphibious aircraft|amphibious]] [[flying boat]]s of [[701 Naval Air Squadron|701 Squadron]] and 18 [[Hawker Hurricane]]s of [[No. 46 Squadron RAF]]. The Walruses were flown off to [[Harstad]], but the airfield at [[Sk\u00e5nland]] was not yet ready for the Hurricanes and they were still aboard when ''Glorious'' returned to Scapa on 21 May. ''Glorious'' came back to the [[Narvik]] area on 26 May and the Hurricanes were flown off.<ref>Haarr, pp. 261\u2013262</ref>\n\nBritish forces were ordered withdrawn a few days later. The evacuation (''[[Operation Alphabet]]'') began in the north on the night of 3/4 June, and ''Glorious'' arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support. She carried only nine Sea Gladiators of [[802 Naval Air Squadron|802 Squadron]] and six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of [[823 Naval Air Squadron|823 Squadron]] for self-defence, as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if possible. Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems in the early evening despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes.<ref>Haarr, pp. 308\u2013310</ref> This was the first time that high performance monoplanes without [[tailhook]]s had been landed on an aircraft carrier.<ref name=h61>Howland, p. 61</ref>\n\nCaptain [[Guy D'Oyly-Hughes]] requested and was granted permission to proceed independently to Scapa Flow in the early hours of 8 June. On the way back across the [[North Sea]], ''Glorious'' and her two escorting destroyers, {{HMS|Acasta|H09|2}} and {{HMS|Ardent|H41|2}}, were found by the two German battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}.<ref>Haarr, pp. 329\u2013330</ref> No [[combat air patrol]] was being flown, no aircraft were spotted on the deck for quick take off and there was no lookout in the [[crow's nest]].<ref>Howland, p. 52</ref> The German heavy ships sank all three British vessels with most of their crews, although ''Acasta'' managed to torpedo ''Scharnhorst'' before she was sunk. Only 43 men from ''Glorious'' survived.<ref>Rohwer, p. 26</ref>\n\n=== ''Furious'' ===\nUntil 2 October 1939, ''Furious'' remained on training duties, combined with anti-submarine sweeps off the east coast of Scotland.<ref>Jenkins, p. 277</ref> She was then assigned to the Home Fleet to replace the sunken ''Courageous'' and sortied on 8 October with the fleet to hunt unsuccessfully for the ''Gneisenau'' and escorting ships which had been spotted off southern Norway. ''Furious'' departed her berth adjacent to the battleship {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}} in Scapa Flow for more futile searches for German ships on 13 October, the day before ''Royal Oak'' was sunk by {{GS|U-47|1938|2}} in Scapa Flow. ''Furious'' served as the flagship for the convoy bringing most of the [[1st Canadian Infantry Division]] to Britain in mid-December 1939.<ref>Jenkins, p. 279</ref>\n\n''Furious'' joined the Home Fleet off the coast of Norway on 10 April 1940 and her Swordfish made several attacks on German ships in Narvik on the following days. She refuelled at [[Troms\u00f8]] on the 14th and remained behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April, her aircraft flying reconnaissance missions until ordered home on 25 April. Her port inner turbine had been damaged by the shock wave from a near miss on 18 April, and the damage was more serious than initially thought. After quick repairs, ''Furious'' returned on 18 May carrying the Gladiators of a reformed 263 Squadron; they were flown off on 21 May once their base at [[Bardufoss Air Station|Bardufoss]] was ready. She sailed to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off.<ref>Haarr, pp. 139\u2013141, 261</ref>\n\nOn 14 June, carrying only half of [[816 Naval Air Squadron|816 Squadron]] for her own protection, ''Furious'' sailed unescorted for [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] carrying \u00a318,000,000 in gold [[bullion]]. On 1 July she escorted a convoy of Canadian troops bound for [[Iceland]] from Halifax and ferried over almost 50 aircraft, spare parts and munitions. On his own initiative, Captain [[Thomas Hope Troubridge|Troubridge]] ordered all available space should be used for sugar bound for Britain. She reembarked her aircraft upon her arrival and made a number of air strikes on shipping in Norwegian waters and on the seaplane base at Troms\u00f8 through October 1940.<ref>Jenkins, p. 283</ref> ''Furious'' loaded 55 aircraft in [[Liverpool]] on 7 November and sailed for [[Takoradi]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], on 15 November where the aircraft were flown off on 27 November to reinforce fighter units defending [[Desert Air Force|Egypt]]. By 15 December, ''Furious'' was back in Liverpool, where she embarked 40 Hurricanes for Takoradi. She sailed on 21 December and joined up with [[Convoy WS 5A]] which encountered the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2|up=y}} on 25 December. The German ship was driven off by the escorts, and ''Furious'' reached Takoradi on 10 January 1941. She arrived in Britain on 5 February where she was given a brief refit. She made another ferry trip to Takoradi between 4 and 22 March.<ref>Nailer, pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nNow with a new destination for her ferry trips, ''Furious'' transported two dozen Hurricanes to Gibraltar on 25 April where they were transferred to ''Ark Royal'' to be flown off for [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Malta]]. She returned for another load of Hurricanes and arrived back in Gibraltar on 18 May. Some of these fighters were moved to ''Ark Royal'' via planks between the flight decks of the carriers berthed stern to stern. This time she accompanied ''Ark Royal'' and the two carriers flew off their fighters from a position south of Sardinia. She would repeat this ferry mission three more times from June to September 1941.<ref>Nailer, p. 165</ref> In July and August, ''Furious'' and {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}} attacked German installations in the Arctic areas of Norway and Finland with limited success and heavy losses. Following her last ferry mission she was sent to [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, to refit.<ref>Jenkins, p. 284</ref>\n\n[[File:A Supermarine Seafire being brought up onto the flight deck of HMS FURIOUS, August 1944. A25076.jpg|thumb|A [[Supermarine Seafire]] being brought up onto the flight deck of ''Furious'', August 1944]]\n\n''Furious'' arrived back in the UK in April 1942 and spent the next three months [[Glossary of nautical terms#W|working up]]. In August she was detailed to accompany the convoy bound for Malta in [[Operation Pedestal]], but she was to sail with them only far enough to allow her 38 [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s to reach Malta. This she did, just as ''Eagle'' was torpedoed, but ''Furious'' turned around after flying off her fighters and reached Gibraltar successfully. She loaded another batch of 32 Spitfires on 16 August and they were flown off the following day south-east of the [[Balearic Islands]]. After this mission ''Furious'' was sent back to Home Fleet for training. One last mission was necessary to reinforce the defences of Malta before [[Operation Torch]], and she arrived on 27 October. She loaded 32 Spitfires and launched them on the 29th before returning to Gibraltar to participate in Torch.<ref>Nailer, pp. 164\u2013165</ref>\n\nProviding cover for the Central Task Force, ''Furious''{{'}}s aircraft neutralised the airfields at [[Es S\u00e9nia|La Senia]] and [[Tafraoui]], both near [[Oran]], Algeria. She remained with Force H until February 1943 before transferring to Home Fleet where she remained for the rest of the war. In July the Home Fleet demonstrated off the coast of Norway in strength to distract attention from the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]; ''Furious''{{'}}s role was to allow a German reconnaissance aircraft to spot the British ships and make a report then shoot it down.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 284\u2013285</ref> She was refitted in August and spent the rest of the year training.<ref name=b2>Burt 2012, p. 277</ref>\n\nOn 3 April 1944, [[Fairey Barracuda]]s from ''Furious'' and ''Victorious'' attacked the German battleship ''Tirpitz'' in [[Altafjord]], Norway, as part of [[Operation Tungsten]]. ''Tirpitz'' was hit 14 times and needed three months to complete her repairs, although four aircraft were lost in the attack. The Home Fleet tried another attack on ''Tirpitz'' later in the month, but bad weather prevented any attack from being made. Instead the aircraft attempted to attack installations at [[Bod\u00f8]], but found a German convoy instead and sank three ships. Three operations against targets in northern Norway, including two against ''Tirpitz'', had to be abandoned or diverted to other targets in May, but three German ships were sunk and two more were set afire. ''Furious'' and other carriers made another attempt to sink the ''Tirpitz'' on 17 July, but were unsuccessful against the fully alerted German defences. Four more attacks on ''Tirpitz'' were made in August, but only the attack on the 24th was even partially successful as two minor hits were made.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 314, 320, 322, 343, 350\u2013351</ref>\n\nAs the war progressed, the ship's age and limitations became increasingly apparent, and ''Furious'' was placed in reserve on 15 September 1944. She was [[paid off]] in April 1945 and used to evaluate the effects of aircraft explosives on the ship's structure.

The three ships\u2014{{HMS|Furious|47|2}}, {{HMS|Courageous|50|2}} and {{HMS|Glorious||2}}\u2014were originally laid down as [[Courageous-class battlecruiser]]s as part of the [[Baltic Project]] during the [[Naval warfare of World War I|First World War]]. While very fast, their minimal armour and few guns limited their long-term utility in the post-war Royal Navy, and they were [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|laid up]] after the war. They were considered [[capital ship]]s by the terms of the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and were included in the total amount of tonnage allowed to the Royal Navy. Rather than [[ship breaking|scrap]] them, the Navy decided to convert them to aircraft carriers as permitted under the Treaty.\n\n''Furious'', already partially converted during the war, began her reconstruction in 1921, before the Treaty came into effect. In an attempt to minimise air turbulence, she was given no [[superstructure]] or [[Glossary of nautical terms#I|island]]. This was not entirely satisfactory, and a small island was added in 1939. Another problem was that she lacked a standard [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]; instead, her [[boiler]] uptakes ran along the sides of the ship and exhausted out of gratings on the rear of the [[flight deck]], or at the sides of the ship if landing operations were in progress. The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity, and the exhaust gases were as much of a problem for landing aircraft as the turbulence would have been. Her [[sister ship|half-sisters]], ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'', began their conversions to aircraft carriers as ''Furious'' neared completion. They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since ''Furious'' had been designed and incorporated an island with a funnel, increasing their aircraft capacity by one-third and making it safer to land.\n\nAs the first large carrier completed by the Royal Navy, ''Furious'' was extensively used to evaluate aircraft handling and landing procedures, including the first-ever carrier night landing in 1926. ''Courageous'' became the first warship lost by the Royal Navy in the Second World War when she was [[torpedo]]ed in September 1939 by a German [[U-boat|submarine]]. ''Glorious'' participated in the [[Norwegian campaign]] in 1940, but she was sunk by two German [[battleship]]s in June as she sailed home with a minimal escort. ''Furious'' participated in many major operations during the war, including the Norwegian campaign in 1940, the [[Malta Convoys]] and ''[[Operation Torch]]'' in 1942, and airstrikes on the {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz}} and other targets in Norway in 1944. The ship was worn out by 1944 and was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] status in September 1944 before being [[Ship commissioning#Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in 1945 and sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1948.\n\n== Careers as battlecruisers ==\n{{Main|Courageous-class battlecruiser}}\n\n[[File:HMS Glorious (1917) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|''Glorious'' as a battlecruiser]]\nThe first two ships of the class, ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'', spent the First World War on [[North Sea]] patrols, climaxing in the [[Second Battle of Heligoland Bight]] in November 1917. Their half-sister ''Furious'' was designed with a pair of {{convert|18|in|0|adj=on}} guns\u2014as opposed to four {{convert|15|in|0|adj=on}}\u2014but was modified while being built to hold a flying-off deck and [[hangar]] in lieu of her forward [[gun turret|turret]] and [[barbette]]. She made some patrols in the North Sea before her rear turret was removed and another flight deck added. Her aircraft attacked [[Zeppelin]] sheds during the [[Tondern raid]] in July 1918.<ref>Roberts, p. 123</ref>\n\nAll three ships were reduced to reserve after the war. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited the signatory nations to a set amount of capital ship tonnage; all ships in excess of this figure had to be scrapped. Up to {{convert|66000|LT|t|lk=on}} of existing ships could be converted into aircraft carriers, and the Royal Navy decided to use the ''Courageous''-class ships due to their high speed. Each ship was reconstructed with a flight deck during the 1920s.<ref>Friedman, p. 97</ref>\n\n== Conversions ==\n[[File:HMS Furious-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Furious'' as she was during the First World War with separate take-off and landing decks and superstructure in between]]\n[[File:Dunning Landing-on Furious In Pup.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Sopwith Pup]] unsuccessfully attempting to land on ''Furious''{{'}}s forward flight deck, 7 August 1917]]\n{{HMS|Furious|47|2}} had been fitted during the First World War with a flying-off and landing deck, but the latter proved largely unusable because of the strong air currents around the superstructure and exhaust gases from the funnel. She was laid up after the war, but was converted to an aircraft carrier between June 1921 and September 1925. Her design was based on the very limited experience gained with the first two British carriers: {{HMS|Argus|I49|2}}, less than three years old, and {{HMS|Eagle|1918|2}}, which had carried out only 143 deck landings during preliminary [[sea trial]]s in 1920.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 263\u2013267</ref><ref>Burt 2012, p. 252</ref><ref>Brown, p. 252</ref>\n\n''Furious''{{'}}s superstructure, masts, funnel and landing deck were removed and she was given a {{convert|576|by|92|ft|m|1|adj=on}} flight deck that extended over three-quarters of her length. This flight deck was not level; it sloped upwards about three-quarters of the way from the stern to help slow down landing aircraft, which had no brakes at the time it was designed. That era's fore-and-aft [[arresting gear]], initially {{convert|320|ft|1}} long on ''Furious'', was not intended to stop landing aircraft\u2014the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind\u2014but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and potentially falling off the flight deck. Various designs for the flight deck were tested in a wind tunnel by the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] which showed that the distinctive elliptical shape and rounded edges minimised turbulence. To minimise any turbulence over the flight deck, ''Furious'' was flush-decked and lacked an island, like ''Argus''; instead she was provided with a retractable [[Glossary of nautical terms#C|charthouse]] at the forward end of the flight deck.<ref>Friedman, pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nA two-[[storey]] hangar was built under the flight deck, each level being {{convert|15|ft|1|abbr=on}} high. The lower hangar was {{convert|550|ft|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|35|-|50|ft|1|abbr=on}} wide and the upper was {{convert|520|by|50|ft|1|abbr=on}}. Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers. Her boilers were ducted down the side of the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck, or, when landing operations were in progress, out of the side of the lower hangar at the rear of the ship. This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space, made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree. Her original flying-off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] so that the ship could simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck and could speedily launch her aircraft from both decks. Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 264\u2013265</ref> Two {{convert|47|by|46|ft|m|adj=on|1}} lifts (elevators) were installed to transfer aircraft between the flight deck and hangars. Two {{convert|600|impgal|l USgal|adj=on}} ready-use [[petrol]] tanks were provided for aircraft and the ship's boats on the upper deck. An additional {{convert|20000|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol were in bulk storage. The longitudinal arresting gear proved unpopular in service and it was ordered removed in 1927 after tests aboard ''Furious'' in 1926 had shown that deck-edge palisades were effective in reducing cross-deck gusts that could blow aircraft over the side.<ref>Friedman, pp. 94\u201395</ref> ''Furious''{{'}}s long exhaust ducting hampered landing operations, and restricted the size of the hangars and thus the number of aircraft that she could carry.<ref name=\"Friedmanpp\">Friedman, pp. 103, 105\u2013106</ref>\n\n''Glorious'' and ''Courageous'' were converted to aircraft carriers after ''Furious'' began her reconstruction, ''Courageous'' at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] starting on 29 June 1924, and ''Glorious'' at [[Rosyth]] on 14 February 1924. The latter was moved to Devonport to complete the conversion after ''Furious'' was finished. Their design was based on ''Furious'' with a few improvements based on experience gained since she was designed. All superstructure, guns, and fittings down to the main deck were removed. A two-storey hangar, each level {{convert|16|ft|1|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|550|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} long, was built on top of the remaining hull; the upper hangar level opened onto a short flying-off deck, below and forward of the main flight deck. Two slightly larger {{convert|46|by|48|ft|m|adj=on|1}} lifts were installed fore and aft in the flight deck. An island was added on the starboard side with the bridge, flying control station, and funnel, as an island did not create as much turbulence as had been earlier feared. By 1939 both ships could carry {{convert|34500|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol.<ref name=\"Friedmanpp\" />\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:HMS Glorious underway 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of ''Glorious'', 1936]]\nThe ''Courageous''-class ships had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|786|ft|9|in|m|1|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|90|ft|6|in|m|1|abbr=on}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|28|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} at [[deep load]]. These were increases of {{convert|9|ft|6|in|m|1|abbr=on}} in beam and over {{convert|2|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} in draught compared to their earlier incarnations as battlecruisers. They displaced {{convert|24210|LT|t|lk=on}} at normal load and {{convert|26990|LT|t|abbr=on}} at deep load, increases of over {{convert|3000|LT|t}}. Their [[metacentric height]] declined from {{convert|6|ft|1|abbr=on}} at deep load to {{convert|4.4|ft|1|abbr=on}} and the ships had a complete [[double bottom]].<ref name=r65>Roberts, pp. 64\u201365</ref> In 1939, ''Courageous'' had a complement of 807 officers and [[naval rating|ratings]], plus 403 men in her air group.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 283, 285</ref>\n\nTheir half-sister ''Furious'' was the same length, but had a beam of {{convert|89|ft|0.75|in|m|1|abbr=on}},<ref>Jenkins, front [[endpaper]]</ref> and an average draught of {{convert|27|ft|3|in|m|1|abbr=on}} at deep load, two feet deeper than before the conversion. She displaced {{convert|22500|LT|t}} at normal load and {{convert|26500|LT|t|abbr=on}} at deep load, over 3,000 long tons more than her previous displacement of {{convert|19513|LT|t}} at load and {{convert|22890|LT|t}} at deep load. ''Furious''{{'}}s metacentric height was {{convert|3.6|ft|1|abbr=on}} at deep load, a reduction of {{convert|1.48|ft|1|abbr=on}} after her conversion.<ref name=r65 /> In 1932, ''Furious'' had a complement of 738 officers and ratings, plus 468 men in her air group.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 266, 273</ref>\n\n=== Propulsion ===\nThe ''Courageous''-class ships were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared [[steam turbine]]s. Arranged in two engine rooms, each of the turbines drove one of the four [[propeller shaft]]s. ''Furious''{{'}}s propellers were {{convert|11|ft|6|in|m|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. The turbines were powered by 18 [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] small-tube boilers equally divided among three boiler rooms.

One mount each was on the former flying-off deck and the quarterdeck while the other four were mounted two per side.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 268\u201369, 276</ref> The Mark XIX mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 80\u00b0. The Mark XVI gun fired  fifteen to twenty {{convert|35|lb|kg|adj=on}} HE shells per minute at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2660|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Against surface targets it had a range of {{convert|19850|yd|m|abbr=on}} and a maximum ceiling of {{convert|31000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective anti-aircraft range of much less.<ref>Campbell, p. 56</ref> Two more Mark V 2-pounder mounts were added fore and aft of the newly added island at the same time.<ref name=b69 />\n\nDuring the Second World War, ''Furious'', the only surviving ship of the three, received an eventual total of 22 manually operated automatic [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20&nbsp;mm Oerlikon]] light anti-aircraft (AA) guns, which replaced the single quadruple Vickers 0.50-calibre machine gun mount.<ref name=f9 /> The Oerlikon fired a {{convert|0.272|lb|adj=on}} HE shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2750|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. The maximum ceiling was 10,000 ft and the maximum range was {{convert|4800|yd|abbr=on}} although the effective range was under {{convert|1000|yd|abbr=on}}. The cyclic rate of fire was 450 rounds per minute, but the practical rate was between 250 and 320 rounds per minute owing to the need to reload [[magazine (firearms)|magazines]].<ref>Campbell, pp. 75\u201376</ref>\n\nA mix of single-purpose anti-surface and anti-aircraft guns in various sizes was considered for ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' by the [[Admiralty]], but was ultimately rejected for a dual-purpose armament of sixteen [[QF 4.7 inch Mk VIII naval gun|QF 4.7-inch Mark VIII]] guns in single high-angle mounts. One mount was on each side of the lower flight deck and a pair were on the quarterdeck. The remaining twelve mounts were distributed along the sides of each ship.<ref name=b83 /> These mounts could depress to \u22125\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 90\u00b0. The Mark VIII guns fired a {{convert|50|lb|kg|adj=on}} HE shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2457|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of 8\u201312 rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|32000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective range of much less. They had a maximum range of {{convert|16160|yd|m|abbr=on}} against surface targets.<ref>Campbell, p. 51</ref>\n\nDuring refits in the mid-1930s, both ships received multiple 2-pounder ''pom-pom'' mounts. ''Courageous'' received three quadruple Mark VII mounts, one on each side of the flying-off deck, forward of the 4.7-inch guns, and one behind the island on the flight deck (two of these were transferred from the battleship {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|05|2}}). ''Glorious'' received three octuple Mark VI mounts in the same locations. Both ships received four water-cooled [[Vickers .50 machine gun|0.50-calibre Mark III]] [[machine gun]]s in a single quadruple mounting.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 157, 286</ref> This mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 70\u00b0. The machine guns fired a {{convert|1.326|oz|adj=on}} bullet at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2520|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. This gave the gun a maximum range of about {{convert|5000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, although its effective range was only {{convert|800|yd|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Campbell, p. 78</ref> Neither ship had any further guns added before they were sunk early in the war,<ref name=f9 /> in 1939 and 1940, respectively.\n\n=== Fire control and radar ===\nTo assist its weapon systems in hitting their target, ''Furious'' was completed with one [[fire-control system]] for each side, with separate [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|directors]] for low-angle and high-angle guns. The 5.5-inch guns were centrally controlled by a [[Frederic Charles Dreyer#Dreyer Fire Control Table|Dreyer Fire-Control Table]] on the lower deck while the 4-inch guns had their mechanical computers next to their directors.<ref name=f5 /> The existing fire-control directors were removed when ''Furious'' received her new dual-purpose 4-inch mountings in 1939. New high-angle directors, including two for the ''pom-poms'', were mounted on top of the new island and on the former lower flight deck. Over the course of the war [[Type 285 radar|Type 285]] gunnery [[radar]]s were mounted on top of the high-angle directors. She also received a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 290|Type 290]] air-search radar.<ref name=f9 />\n\n''Courageous'' was initially fitted only with low-angle directors for her guns, but these were replaced by dual-purpose directors when she was refitted in 1930. (''Glorious'', completed later, had hers from the beginning.) Neither ship was fitted with radar before its early loss.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u201386</ref>\n\n=== Protection ===\nLittle armour other than that of the [[barbette]]s was removed during their conversion to aircraft carriers. The transverse bulkheads were carried through the locations of the former barbettes. The flight deck was {{convert|0.625|in|mm}} in thickness.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 273, 282</ref>\n\nUnlike other British battlecruisers, the bulk of the armour of the ''Courageous''-class ships was made from [[Ultimate tensile strength|high-tensile]] steel (HTS), a type of steel used structurally in other ships. Their waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] consisted of {{convert|2|in|0}} of HTS covered by a {{convert|1|in|0|adj=on}} thick mild steel skin. It protected roughly the middle two-thirds of the ship with a one-inch extension forward to the two-inch forward transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] well short of the bow. The belt had a height of {{convert|23|ft|m|0}}, of which {{convert|18|in|m|1}} was below the designed waterline. From the former forward barbette, a 3-inch bulkhead extended out to the ship's side between the upper and lower decks and a comparable bulkhead was in place at the former location of the rear barbette as well. Four decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from {{convert|0.75|\u2013|3|in}}, thickest over the magazines and the steering gear. After the [[Battle of Jutland]], {{convert|110|LT|t}} of extra protection was added to the deck around the magazines.<ref>Burt 1986, pp. 308, 313</ref>\n\nThe [[torpedo bulkhead]]s were increased during building from 0.75\u2013{{convert|1.5|in|abbr=on}} in thickness.<ref>Roberts, pp. 54, 106, 113</ref> All three ships were fitted with a shallow [[anti-torpedo bulge]] integral to the hull, which was intended to detonate the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and deflect the underwater explosion to the surface, away from the ship. Later testing proved that it was not deep enough to accomplish its task and that it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force of the explosion.<ref>Roberts, p. 111</ref>\n\n=== Air groups ===\n[[File:HMS Furious-15.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Furious'' in the mid-1930s with a flight of [[Blackburn Baffin]] torpedo bombers overhead]]\nNormally, ''Furious'' could carry only about 36 aircraft. In the 1920s this commonly meant one flight (squadrons after 1932) of fighters ([[Fairey Flycatcher]]), two of spotters ([[Blackburn Blackburn]] or [[Avro Bison]]), one spotter reconnaissance ([[Fairey III]]D) and two flights of torpedo bombers ([[Blackburn Dart]]). In 1935 there was one squadron of fighters with [[Hawker Nimrod]]s and [[Hawker Osprey]]s, one squadron of [[Blackburn Baffin]] torpedo bombers and one squadron of Fairey IIIF spotters. During the Second World War, the carrier typically carried a single fighter squadron and two of strike aircraft of various types, although the mix was often adjusted for specific missions.<ref name=b69 />\n\n''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' were generally similar except that they carried a total of 48 aircraft. They commonly flew the same types of aircraft as ''Furious'', although they are also known to have flown the [[Fairey Seal]], the [[Blackburn Shark]], and the [[Blackburn Ripon]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 284</ref>\n\n== Pre-war service ==\n''Furious'' was assigned to the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] after commissioning in 1925, although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA) inventory. These included landing and flying-off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher [[floatplane]]s, with and without wheels, to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats. The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty. A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily.<ref name=f9 /><ref>Burt 2012, pp. 270\u2013272</ref> The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards. Deck-edge [[palisade]]s ([[windbreak]]s) were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side in rough weather.<ref name=f5 /><ref>Jenkins, p. 271</ref> The first carrier night-landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard ''Furious''.<ref>Jenkins, p. 274</ref>\n\nThe ship was reduced to reserve status on 1 July 1930 in preparation for a lengthy overhaul at Devonport from September 1930 to February 1932, focused on refitting her machinery and re-tubing her boilers.<ref name=b0>Burt 2012, p. 270</ref> In addition her quarterdeck was raised by one deck, the AA armament was revised and water spraying facilities were fitted in the hangars.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 275\u2013276</ref> Upon completion she ran a full-power trial on 16 February 1932 where her maximum speed was {{convert|28.8|kn|abbr=on}} from a total of {{convert|89754|shp|abbr=on}}.<ref name=b0 />\n\n''Furious'' was recommissioned in May 1932 as part of the Home Fleet with a reduced crew before being brought up to full complement in November.<ref name=j6>Jenkins, p. 276</ref> Transverse arresting gear was fitted sometime during the mid-1930s. She was detached to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] from May to October 1934. ''Furious'' was present at the Coronation [[Fleet Review]] at [[Spithead]] on 20 May 1937 for King [[George VI]]. She became a deck-landing training carrier in 1937, although she was refitted between December 1937 and May 1938 in Devonport, where the forward end of her lower flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward. During the [[Munich Crisis]] in September 1938, she embarked Nos. [[801 Naval Air Squadron|801]], [[821 Naval Air Squadron|821]] and [[822 Naval Air Squadron|822 Squadrons]] and joined the fleet at [[Scapa Flow]], before resuming her training duties after the peaceful conclusion of the affair.<ref name=\"b69\" /><ref name=j6 />\n\nShe was given a more extensive refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5.5-inch guns and palisades, mounted AA guns on her flying-off deck, plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar, and gave her a small island on the starboard side. ''Furious'' resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 277\u2013278</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Courageous (50).jpg|thumb|left|''Courageous'' at anchor ({{circa|1935}})]]\n''Courageous'' was recommissioned on 21 February 1928 and assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet from May 1928 to June 1930. She was relieved by ''Glorious'' and refitted from June to August 1930. The ship was assigned to the Atlantic and Home Fleets from 12 August 1930 to December 1938 aside from a temporary attachment to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1936. In the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed and she received two hydraulic [[aircraft catapult|catapults]] on the upper flight deck before March 1934. ''Courageous'' was refitted again between October 1935 and June 1936 and received her ''pom-pom'' mounts. She was also present at the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review. She became a training carrier in December 1938 when {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} joined the Home Fleet and continued on that duty until the start of the Second World War.<ref name=b15>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u2013286, 290</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Glorious anchored.jpg|thumb|right|''Glorious'' at anchor (circa 1934)]]\n''Glorious'' was recommissioned on 24 February 1930 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet, but was attached to the Home Fleet from March to June 1930. She relieved ''Courageous'' in the Mediterranean Fleet in June 1930 and remained there until October 1939. In a fog on 1 April 1931 ''Glorious'' rammed SS ''Florida'' amidships while steaming at {{convert|16|knots|abbr=on}}. The impact crumpled {{convert|60|ft|1|abbr=on}} of the flying-off deck and forced ''Glorious'' to put into [[Gibdock|Gibraltar]] for temporary repairs. She had to sail to [[Malta Dockyard|Malta]] for permanent repairs which lasted until September 1931. Sometime in the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed. She was refitted at Devonport from July 1934 to July 1935 where she received two catapults, her flight deck was extended to the rear, her quarterdeck was raised one deck and she received her multiple ''pom-pom'' mounts. ''Glorious'' also participated in the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review before returning to the Mediterranean.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u2013288</ref>\n\n== Second World War ==\n=== ''Courageous'' ===\n[[File:HMS Courageous sinking.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Courageous'' sinking]]\nIn the early days of the war, [[Hunter-killer Group|hunter-killer groups]] were formed around the fleet aircraft carriers to find and destroy U-boats. On 17 September 1939, two torpedoes from {{GS|U-29|1936|2}} turned the tables, and ''Courageous'' became the first British warship sunk in the Second World War. As ''Ark Royal'' had been surprised by a near miss seven days earlier, the fleet carriers were withdrawn from this duty.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 1\u20133</ref>\n\n=== ''Glorious'' ===\nForce J, including ''Glorious'', was organised to hunt for the {{ship|German pocket battleship|Admiral Graf Spee}} in the Indian Ocean. They were not successful, and ''Glorious'' remained in the Indian Ocean until December when she was transferred to the Mediterranean.\n\n''Glorious'' was recalled to the Home Fleet in April 1940 to provide air cover for British forces landing in [[Norwegian Campaign|Norway]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 285</ref> [[Gloster Gladiators]] of [[No. 263 Squadron RAF]] were flown aboard to be transferred to Norwegian airbases. ''Glorious'' and ''Ark Royal'' arrived off central Norway on 24 April where 263 Squadron was flown off and their organic aircraft attacked targets in the [[Trondheim]] area before ''Glorious'' had to return to Scapa Flow on 27 April to refuel and embark new aircraft. She returned on 1 May, after failing to load new aircraft because of poor weather. The task force was under heavy air attack by the [[Luftwaffe]] all day and was withdrawn that evening.<ref>Haarr, pp. 143\u201354</ref>\n\n''Glorious'' returned on 18 May with six [[Supermarine Walrus]] [[Amphibious aircraft|amphibious]] [[flying boat]]s of [[701 Naval Air Squadron|701 Squadron]] and 18 [[Hawker Hurricane]]s of [[No. 46 Squadron RAF]]. The Walruses were flown off to [[Harstad]], but the airfield at [[Sk\u00e5nland]] was not yet ready for the Hurricanes and they were still aboard when ''Glorious'' returned to Scapa on 21 May. ''Glorious'' came back to the [[Narvik]] area on 26 May and the Hurricanes were flown off.<ref>Haarr, pp. 261\u201362</ref>\n\nBritish forces were ordered withdrawn a few days later. The evacuation (''[[Operation Alphabet]]'') began in the north on the night of 3/4 June, and ''Glorious'' arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support. She carried only nine Sea Gladiators of [[802 Naval Air Squadron|802 Squadron]] and six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of [[823 Naval Air Squadron|823 Squadron]] for self-defence, as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if possible. Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems in the early evening despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes.<ref>Haarr, pp. 308\u201310</ref> This was the first time that high performance monoplanes without [[tailhook]]s had been landed on an aircraft carrier.<ref name=h61>Howland, p. 61</ref>\n\nCaptain [[Guy D'Oyly-Hughes]] requested and was granted permission to proceed independently to Scapa Flow in the early hours of 8 June. On the way back across the [[North Sea]], ''Glorious'' and her two escorting destroyers, {{HMS|Acasta|H09|2}} and {{HMS|Ardent|H41|2}}, were found by the two German battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}.<ref>Haarr, pp. 329\u201330</ref> No [[combat air patrol]] was being flown, no aircraft were spotted on the deck for quick take off and there was no lookout in the [[crow's nest]].<ref>Howland, p. 52</ref> The German heavy ships sank all three British vessels with most of their crews, although ''Acasta'' managed to torpedo ''Scharnhorst'' before she was sunk. Only 43 men from ''Glorious'' survived.<ref>Rohwer, p. 26</ref>\n\n=== ''Furious'' ===\nUntil 2 October 1939, ''Furious'' remained on training duties, combined with anti-submarine sweeps off the east coast of Scotland.<ref>Jenkins, p. 277</ref> She was then assigned to the Home Fleet to replace the sunken ''Courageous'' and sortied on 8 October with the fleet to hunt unsuccessfully for the ''Gneisenau'' and escorting ships which had been spotted off southern Norway. ''Furious'' departed her berth adjacent to the battleship {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}} in Scapa Flow for more futile searches for German ships on 13 October, the day before ''Royal Oak'' was sunk by {{GS|U-47|1938|2}} in Scapa Flow. ''Furious'' served as the flagship for the convoy bringing most of the [[1st Canadian Infantry Division]] to Britain in mid-December 1939.<ref>Jenkins, p. 279</ref>\n\n''Furious'' joined the Home Fleet off the coast of Norway on 10 April 1940 and her Swordfish made several attacks on German ships in Narvik on the following days. She refuelled at [[Troms\u00f8]] on the 14th and remained behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April, her aircraft flying reconnaissance missions until ordered home on 25 April. Her port inner turbine had been damaged by the shock wave from a near miss on 18 April, and the damage was more serious than initially thought. After quick repairs, ''Furious'' returned on 18 May carrying the Gladiators of a reformed 263 Squadron; they were flown off on 21 May once their base at [[Bardufoss Air Station|Bardufoss]] was ready. She sailed to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off.<ref>Haarr, pp. 139\u201341, 261</ref>\n\nOn 14 June, carrying only half of [[816 Naval Air Squadron|816 Squadron]] for her own protection, ''Furious'' sailed unescorted for [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] carrying \u00a318,000,000 in gold [[bullion]]. On 1 July she escorted a convoy of Canadian troops bound for [[Iceland]] from Halifax and ferried over almost 50 aircraft, spare parts and munitions. On his own initiative, Captain [[Thomas Hope Troubridge|Troubridge]] ordered all available space should be used for sugar bound for Britain. She reembarked her aircraft upon her arrival and made a number of air strikes on shipping in Norwegian waters and on the seaplane base at Troms\u00f8 through October 1940.<ref>Jenkins, p. 283</ref> ''Furious'' loaded 55 aircraft in [[Liverpool]] on 7 November and sailed for [[Takoradi]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], on 15 November where the aircraft were flown off on 27 November to reinforce fighter units defending [[Desert Air Force|Egypt]]. By 15 December, ''Furious'' was back in Liverpool, where she embarked 40 Hurricanes for Takoradi. She sailed on 21 December and joined up with [[Convoy WS 5A]] which encountered the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2|up=y}} on 25 December. The German ship was driven off by the escorts, and ''Furious'' reached Takoradi on 10 January 1941. She arrived in Britain on 5 February where she was given a brief refit. She made another ferry trip to Takoradi between 4 and 22 March.<ref>Nailer, pp. 154\u201355</ref>\n\nNow with a new destination for her ferry trips, ''Furious'' transported two dozen Hurricanes to Gibraltar on 25 April where they were transferred to ''Ark Royal'' to be flown off for [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Malta]]. She returned for another load of Hurricanes and arrived back in Gibraltar on 18 May. Some of these fighters were moved to ''Ark Royal'' via planks between the flight decks of the carriers berthed stern to stern. This time she accompanied ''Ark Royal'' and the two carriers flew off their fighters from a position south of Sardinia. She would repeat this ferry mission three more times from June to September 1941.<ref>Nailer, p. 165</ref> In July and August, ''Furious'' and {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}} attacked German installations in the Arctic areas of Norway and Finland with limited success and heavy losses. Following her last ferry mission she was sent to [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, to refit.<ref>Jenkins, p. 284</ref>\n\n[[File:A Supermarine Seafire being brought up onto the flight deck of HMS FURIOUS, August 1944. A25076.jpg|thumb|A [[Supermarine Seafire]] being brought up onto the flight deck of ''Furious'', August 1944]]\n\n''Furious'' arrived back in the UK in April 1942 and spent the next three months [[Glossary of nautical terms#W|working up]]. In August she was detailed to accompany the convoy bound for Malta in [[Operation Pedestal]], but she was to sail with them only far enough to allow her 38 [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s to reach Malta. This she did, just as ''Eagle'' was torpedoed, but ''Furious'' turned around after flying off her fighters and reached Gibraltar successfully. She loaded another batch of 32 Spitfires on 16 August and they were flown off the following day south-east of the [[Balearic Islands]]. After this mission ''Furious'' was sent back to Home Fleet for training. One last mission was necessary to reinforce the defences of Malta before [[Operation Torch]], and she arrived on 27 October. She loaded 32 Spitfires and launched them on the 29th before returning to Gibraltar to participate in Torch.<ref>Nailer, pp. 164\u201365</ref>\n\nProviding cover for the Central Task Force, ''Furious''{{'}}s aircraft neutralised the airfields at [[Es S\u00e9nia|La Senia]] and [[Tafraoui]], both near [[Oran]], Algeria. She remained with Force H until February 1943 before transferring to Home Fleet where she remained for the rest of the war. In July the Home Fleet demonstrated off the coast of Norway in strength to distract attention from the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]; ''Furious''{{'}}s role was to allow a German reconnaissance aircraft to spot the British ships and make a report then shoot it down.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 284\u201385</ref> She was refitted in August and spent the rest of the year training.<ref name=b2>Burt 2012, p. 277</ref>\n\nOn 3 April 1944, [[Fairey Barracuda]]s from ''Furious'' and ''Victorious'' attacked the German battleship ''Tirpitz'' in [[Altafjord]], Norway, as part of [[Operation Tungsten]]. ''Tirpitz'' was hit 14 times and needed three months to complete her repairs, although four aircraft were lost in the attack. The Home Fleet tried another attack on ''Tirpitz'' later in the month, but bad weather prevented any attack from being made. Instead the aircraft attempted to attack installations at [[Bod\u00f8]], but found a German convoy instead and sank three ships. Three operations against targets in northern Norway, including two against ''Tirpitz'', had to be abandoned or diverted to other targets in May, but three German ships were sunk and two more were set afire. ''Furious'' and other carriers made another attempt to sink the ''Tirpitz'' on 17 July, but were unsuccessful against the fully alerted German defences. Four more attacks on ''Tirpitz'' were made in August, but only the attack on the 24th was even partially successful as two minor hits were made.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 314, 320, 322, 343, 350\u2013351</ref>\n\nAs the war progressed, the ship's age and limitations became increasingly apparent, and ''Furious'' was placed in reserve on 15 September 1944. She was [[paid off]] in April 1945 and used to evaluate the effects of aircraft explosives on the ship's structure. She was sold in 1948 for scrap, which was completed in 1954 at [[Troon]].<ref name=b2 />\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book|last=Brown|first=David|title=HMS Eagle|series=Warship Profile|volume=35|year=1973|publisher=Profile Publications|location=Windsor, Berkshire, UK|oclc=33084560}}\n* {{cite book|last=Burt|first=R.

Snakes have been thought of as the only squamates with replacement teeth that develop in a horizontal posteriorly inclined position.  Snakes deviate from the usual varanoid pattern of tooth replacement, in that their replacement teeth develop in a horizontal inclined position and rotate, however snakes differ from Mosasaurs because they do not possess the resorption pits found in Mosasaurs.<ref name=\"Oliver\" />\n\nMosasaurs, including ''Clidastes'', and snakes both share the traits of thecodont tooth implantation, and a recumbent position of replacement teeth. However mosasaurs develop replacement teeth by rotating within the resorption pits that are at the base of functional teeth. This is different from snakes because snakes have recumbent replacement teeth that lay horizontal and rotate into functional position when needed. In mosasaurs like ''Clidastes'', once the functional tooth is lost, a new tooth pedicel develops for the replacement tooth. In the case of mosasaurs though, they differ from the thecodont dentition pattern of archosaur and mammals because mosasaurs show true ankylosis and not a fibrous tooth attachment via periodontal ligament that's usually found in mammals and archosaurs.<ref>Luan, X., Walker, C., Dangaria, S., Ito, Y., Druzinsky, R., Jarosius, K., Lesot, H Rieppel, O.

On the dorsal surface of the dentary there is an interdental ridge that separates successive teeth labially. These interdental ridges serve to separate succeeding teeth that grow upward between existing teeth.<ref name=\"Oliver\" />\n\n==Occurrences==\n''Clidastes'' is currently found in marine deposits in the US.

D. Cope]] discovered the first specimens of ''Clidastes propython'' in 1869 from the Mooreville Chalk in [[Lowndes County, Alabama]]. The remains unearthed were that of a juvenile but are one of the best preserved and most complete mosasaurs collected from the state and is regarded as the generic holotype of ''Clidastes''.<ref name=\"Cope, E.D 1868\" /> In 1918, Charles H. Sternberg and his son found additional remains of ''Clidastes'' in Kansas. They were surprised to see that it had [[Humerus|humeri]] and [[Femur|femora]] with round heads, similar to that of mammals. Due to good preservation of the caudals, Sternberg noted that the [[Chevron (anatomy)|chevrons]] along the vertebrae were ankylosed to the center, which is not observed in other mosasaurs. This synapamorphy was believed to aid in fitting the proximal heads snugly into the basins that hew out from the vertebrae almost locking them in place.\n\n==Classification and species==\nThe dental and vertebral morphology of ''Clidastes is'' closer to that of ''[[Mosasaurus]]'' than to any other mosasaur, firmly placing it within the subfamily [[Mosasaurinae]]. Besides being different in size, the teeth of Campanian species of ''Mosasaurus'' (namely ''[[Mosasaurus missouriensis|M. missouriensis]]'' and ''[[Mosasaurus conodon|M. conodon]]'') differ from those of ''Clidastes'' in having a large number of facets that are also more distinct than those in ''Clidastes''. The cervical vertebrae of ''Clidastes'' are also different from those in ''Mosasaurus'' by being more elongated.<ref name=\"lindgren\" />\n\n''Clidastes'' is most frequently recovered as one of the most basal mosasaurines, and the most basal hydropedal mosasaurine genus, being more derived than the plesiopedal ''[[Dallasaurus]]'' but less derived than later genera like ''[[Prognathodon]]'' or ''[[Globidens]]''.

Fourteen to eighteen teeth in maxilla. Prefrontal forms small portion of posterolateral border of external nares, broad triangular ala projects laterally from supraorbital wing. Prefrontal and postorbitofrontal widely separated above orbits. Lateral margins of frontal nearly straight and converge anteriorly, median dorsal ridge weak. Ventral process of postorbitofrontal to jugal confluent with broadly exposed dorsal surface of postorbitofrontal. No ventroposterior process on jugal.

(December 01, 2005). Tooth Replacement in the Late Cretaceous Mosasaur Clidastes. Journal of Herpetology, 39, 4.)</ref> The enamel surface is smooth and the crown is subdivided into a lingual and labial surface while the outer surface of the crown is made of enamel and the inner layer is made of dentine.<ref name=\"Oliver\" /> Fossil specimens show evidence of upright vertically positioned developing replacement teeth. Snakes have been thought of as the only squamates with replacement teeth that develop in a horizontal posteriorly inclined position.  Snakes deviate from the usual varanoid pattern of tooth replacement, in that their replacement teeth develop in a horizontal inclined position and rotate, however snakes differ from Mosasaurs because they do not possess the resorption pits found in Mosasaurs.<ref name=\"Oliver\" />\n\nMosasaurs, including ''Clidastes'', and snakes both share the traits of thecodont tooth implantation, and a recumbent position of replacement teeth. However mosasaurs develop replacement teeth by rotating within the resorption pits that are at the base of functional teeth. This is different from snakes because snakes have recumbent replacement teeth that lay horizontal and rotate into functional position when needed. In mosasaurs like ''Clidastes'', once the functional tooth is lost, a new tooth pedicel develops for the replacement tooth. In the case of mosasaurs though, they differ from the thecodont dentition pattern of archosaur and mammals because mosasaurs show true ankylosis and not a fibrous tooth attachment via periodontal ligament that's usually found in mammals and archosaurs.<ref>Luan, X., Walker, C., Dangaria, S., Ito, Y., Druzinsky, R., Jarosius, K., Lesot, H Rieppel, O. (January 01, 2009). The mosasaur tooth attachment apparatus as paradigm for the evolution of the gnathostome periodontium. Evolution & Development, 11, 3.)</ref>\n\nThe marginal tooth rows in mosasauroids like ''Clidastes'' are found on the premaxilla, maxilla and the dentary. On the dorsal surface of the dentary there is an interdental ridge that separates successive teeth labially. These interdental ridges serve to separate succeeding teeth that grow upward between existing teeth.<ref name=\"Oliver\" />\n\n==Occurrences==\n''Clidastes'' is currently found in marine deposits in the US. In past, however, specimens were referred to this genus from [[Sweden]],<ref name=\"lindgren\">Lindgren, J., & Siverson, M. (January 01, 2004).

D. Cope]] discovered the first specimens of ''Clidastes propython'' in 1869 from the Mooreville Chalk in [[Lowndes County, Alabama]]. The remains unearthed were that of a juvenile but are one of the best preserved and most complete mosasaurs collected from the state and is regarded as the generic holotype of ''Clidastes''.<ref name=\"Cope, E.D 1868\" /> In 1918, Charles H. Sternberg and his son found additional remains of ''Clidastes'' in Kansas. They were surprised to see that it had [[Humerus|humeri]] and [[Femur|femora]] with round heads, similar to that of mammals. Due to good preservation of the caudals, Sternberg noted that the [[Chevron (anatomy)|chevrons]] along the vertebrae were ankylosed to the center, which is not observed in other mosasaurs. This synapamorphy was believed to aid in fitting the proximal heads snugly into the basins that hew out from the vertebrae almost locking them in place.\n\n==Classification and species==\nThe dental and vertebral morphology of ''Clidastes is'' closer to that of ''[[Mosasaurus]]'' than to any other mosasaur, firmly placing it within the subfamily [[Mosasaurinae]]. Besides being different in size, the teeth of Campanian species of ''Mosasaurus'' (namely ''[[Mosasaurus missouriensis|M. missouriensis]]'' and ''[[Mosasaurus conodon|M. conodon]]'') differ from those of ''Clidastes'' in having a large number of facets that are also more distinct than those in ''Clidastes''. The cervical vertebrae of ''Clidastes'' are also different from those in ''Mosasaurus'' by being more elongated.<ref name=\"lindgren\" />\n\n''Clidastes'' is most frequently recovered as one of the most basal mosasaurines, and the most basal hydropedal mosasaurine genus, being more derived than the plesiopedal ''[[Dallasaurus]]'' but less derived than later genera like ''[[Prognathodon]]'' or ''[[Globidens]]''.

The type specimen consists of a single vertebra from the anterior thoracic region, YPM 1601, collected in a marl pit near [[Swedesboro, New Jersey|Swedesboro]], [[New Jersey]]. The vertebra is similar to that of the other species in its general proportions and the strong zygosphene-zygantrum articulation. ''C. iguanavus'' can be differentiated in its central articulations, which are kidney-shaped in outline, with a stronger emargination dorsally for the spinal cord, and in the relatively stout proportions of the centrum.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n* Callison, G.

This came right after Trump attended a discussion where his senior health official [[Anthony Fauci]] told him it would actually take \"a year to a year and a half\" (at a minimum, Fauci later said). During that discussion, Trump repeatedly quizzed the leaders of pharmaceutical companies on the time needed to produce vaccines, stating: \"I like the sound of a couple of months better\".

The policy in question had never been modified by the Obama administration, despite plans to do so. The policy's [[Project Bioshield Act|overall legal roots date to 2004]], before the Obama administration.

Janaro reports that as a child Hardon was \"willful and self-possessed; he was determined that no one was going to tell him what to do\"; but he was soon affected by his mother's devoted example.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" /> Hardon would often recall that his mother told him that she \"taught him to kneel before he could walk\" and the very purpose of knees \"are for kneeling to pray before God\".<ref name=\"Pew\" /> When he was four, Anna took him to his first all night vigil at Our Lady of Consolation parish in Carey, Ohio.<ref name=\"Pew\" /> She made a bed for him on the first pew, and prayed throughout the night on her knees as he slept.<ref name=\"Pew\" /> At the age of six he was instructed by a Sister Benedicta who told her students \"Whatever you ask Our Lord on your First Communion day, you will receive.\"<ref name=\"hardonsj\" /> That same year as he received First Holy Communion Hardon made a request to Jesus, \"Make me a priest.\"<ref name=\"hardonsj\" /> Thereafter the young Hardon attended daily Mass with his mother.<ref name=\"hardonsj\" /> At the age of eight he received the sacrament of Confirmation calling on the Holy Spirit to give him \"the grace of martyrdom.\"<ref name=\"hardonsj\" />\n\nFor added income Hardon's mother took in two young [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] girls as boarders<ref name=\"Pew\" /> named Judith and Susan.<ref name=Real>{{cite web|title=Retreat on the Credo, Faith in the Holy Catholic Church and the Communion of Saints|author=Fr.

Through this Hardon became impressed with the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] order.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" />\n\nHis mother did not have the funds to send him to a Jesuit High School, so he attended the diocesan high school of Cathedral Latin 15 miles from his home where he was taught by the [[Marist Brothers|Brothers of Mary]].<ref name=\"hardonsj\">{{cite web|title=Rev.

At University, he came even more strongly under the influence of the Jesuits. Janaro writes:\n\n{{quote|The Jesuit presence had a profound impact on him. There was a certain strength about the Jesuits, a \"manliness\" that John had never experienced at home because he never knew his father. Also their mental discipline impressed him; it motivated him to major in philosophy and it began to shape his approach to spirituality through the direction of Father LeMay, a brilliant and discerning man who saw in John great potential.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" />}}\n\nElizabeth Mitchell writes that \"under the guidance of his priestly adviser, Hardon began, in his third year of studies, to discern more clearly his own call to the priesthood\".<ref name=\"Father Hardon S.J.\" />  It was LeMay who guided Hardon to change \"his course of studies to include Latin, philosophy, and college theology.\"<ref name=\"hardonsj\" /> Hardon continued his studies until he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from John Carrol University in 1936.<ref name=\"Father Hardon S.J.\" />\n\n=== Entering the Jesuits ===\nIt did not appear that he would be able to join the Jesuits due to his mother's worsening health, whom he felt duty bound to look after. Seeking both to fulfill his duty to his mother and to serve others, he had applied and been accepted to Ohio State Medical School.<ref name=\"EWTN\" />  While he felt that he did not have a vocation to the priesthood, Fr. LeMay, his Jesuit spiritual adviser, \"did not agree with John's assessment of his situation\" and held that \"John did indeed have a priestly vocation\".<ref name=\"EWTN\" /> His mother, aware that his concern for her health was influencing his decision, told him that \"the very same God who was calling him would guard every hair on his mother's head.\"<ref name=\"EWTN\" /> She also told him \"if the reason he was going to marry was so that she would not be alone without anyone to care for her, he was not to be concerned.\"<ref name=\"Pew\" /> Considering his dream of matrimony \"the thought of marriage and family was overwhelmed by a realization of the spiritual family that springs up around a priest who brings the life of Christ to so many people.\"<ref name=\"EWTN\" />\n\nHardon announced his decision to pursue the priesthood to a girl named Jo who had been his friend since grade school when they sat next to each other.<ref name=\"Pew\" /> They had been dating seriously and discussed marriage on several occasions<ref name=\"EWTN\" /> and Hardon had \"weighed the possibility of becoming engaged.\"<ref name=\"hardonsj\" /> He broke the news to her at a restaurant in downtown Cleveland.<ref name=\"EWTN\" /> Jo did not take the news well, breaking down in tears and crying throughout the meal.<ref name=\"EWTN\" /> Hardon entered the Jesuit novitiate on September 1, 1936, \"breaking the heart of a girl he loved, and loved him in return.\"<ref name=\"Wanderer\"/>\n\nHardon's health difficulties continued he later recalled \"When I entered the Novitiate, in one month they put me in the hospital I thought they were gonna throw me out of the order.\"<ref name=Sacrifice>{{cite web|title=What is Sacrifice?|author=John Hardon|url=http://www.therealpresence.org/archives/Mass/Mass_010.htm|date=August 3, 1982}}</ref> Hardon recovered and continued his studies.\n\nTwo months into his novitiate Hardon confessed to Fr. LeMay that he felt he had abandoned his mother when she needed him most. LeMay told him \"John, you belong in the Society of Jesus. What you are experiencing is a temptation. Put it out of your\nmind.\"<ref name=\"EWTN\" /> To avoid further temptations Hardon continued regularly to correspond with his mother but scrupulously avoided visiting her for seven years until ordered to do so by his superior.<ref name=\"EWTN\" /> Hardon was deeply affected by the accidental drowning of a fellow seminarian when a group of them were on a summer lakeshore vacation.<ref name=\"EWTN\" /> As a result of this he refused to take vacations for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"EWTN\" />\n\n== Priesthood ==\nHaving [[Jesuit formation|entered the Society of Jesus as a novice]] on September 1, 1936 Hardon took a special interest in theology and teaching while studying at West Baden College in [[West Baden Springs, Indiana]]. During these studies he produced his first published article in 1941 concerning the study of Latin. Worrying that his love of theology might lead him to pursue it out of his own willfulness at the cost of obedience he \"determined not to request further theological study; he would leave the determination of his future completely in the hands of the Holy Spirit.\"<ref name=\"EWTN\" /> Hardon continued to study and obtained a master's degree in philosophy at [[Loyola University Chicago]] in 1941.<ref name=\"hardonsj\" />\n\nOn June 18, 1947 (his 33rd birthday) he was ordained to the priesthood with his mother in attendance.<ref name=\"EWTN\" /> The two Lutheran boarders of Hardon's childhood had remained close to the family and attended his ordination<ref name=Real/> and first Mass.<ref name=\"hardonsj\" /> Within a year of seeing her son enter the priesthood Hardon's mother died.<ref name=\"EWTN\" />\n\nHardon took it as a sign of divine favor when his superiors, with no prompting from him, ordered him to attend the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in [[Rome]] to continue his study of theology (from 1949 to 1951).<ref name=\"Wanderer\" /><ref name=\"EWTN\" />\n\nWhile studying at Rome, he was appointed director of the graduate library. At one point his superior ordered him to retrieve all of the volumes held on loan by other graduate students that were [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|declared heretical]] by the Catholic Church. Hardon later recalled:\n\n{{quote|Before I had retrieved one-half of the heretical books, I had become the agent of orthodoxy and therefore the sworn enemy of the modernists, who were updating the Catholic faith to its [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|modernist]] theology. I had doors slammed in my face. I lost friends whom I had considered believers....[this experience] taught me that the faith I had so casually learned could be preserved only by the price of a living martyrdom. This faith, I was to find out, is a precious treasure that cannot be preserved except at a heavy price. The price is nothing less than to confess what so many others either openly or covertly denied.\"<ref name=\"Father Hardon S.J.\" />}}\n\nHe received his [[Doctor of Sacred Theology]] degree from the Gregorian University after finishing his doctoral dissertation on St. [[Robert Bellarmine]] entitled ''A Comparative Study of Bellarmine's Doctrine on the Relation of Sincere Non-Catholics to the Catholic Church''. Later in his life, he stated, \u201cI could not have chosen a better subject in preparation for a lifetime of teaching Catholic doctrine.\u201d<ref name=\"Father Hardon S.J.\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hardonsj.org/biography |title=Biography &#124; Father John A.

Hardon was denied his request to be a missionary to post-War Japan (at the newly opened Jesuit University in Tokyo) due to his health.<ref name=\"EWTN\" /> Determined to be of some service for this endeavor, Hardon began to study [[comparative religion]].<ref name=\"EWTN\" /> During his studies of oriental religions he believed there were \"not only areas that were compatible with Christianity but also sections of thought that were clearly influenced in a direct manner by contact with the Christian message.\"<ref name=\"EWTN\" /> Hardon began using his extensive knowledge of Asian customs and religions to train missionaries for that region.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" />\n\nDuring this time Hardon pronounced his final vows on February 2, 1953 including the special [[Fourth vow|Jesuit vow of unwavering fidelity]] to the pope.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" />\n\nIn an effort to understand Protestantism he worked on a book released in 1956 entitled ''Protestant Churches in America'', which was met with critical acclaim even among Protestant circles. While still teaching full-time at West Baden, Hardon became a visiting professor invited to teach Catholic theology at several Protestant seminaries and colleges including Bethany School of Theology, Lutheran School of Theology, and Seabury-Western Divinity School.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" /> Janaro writes:\n\n{{quote|In this work he saw an opportunity to share the fullness of the faith with those baptized in Christ who, because of the circumstances of history, time and place, or culture, had yet to receive a complete understanding and appreciation of the Christian faith and of the Church that extends the power and presence of Jesus Christ.\"<ref name=\"Wanderer\" />}}\n\nThe novelty of the situation was not lost on his Protestant colleagues either, and upon his acceptance of a position at Seabury-Western Divinity school, the Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury sent a personal representative to mark the event - \"the first time in history an Anglican/Episcopalian seminary had appointed a teacher who was a member of the once hated and feared Society of Jesus.\"<ref name=\"Wanderer\" /> Hardon also served as an advisor to the Second Vatican Council on discussions about liturgy.<ref name=\"Pew\" />\n\nBetween 1962 and 1967 Fr. Hardon taught Roman Catholicism and Comparative Religion at Western Michigan University. He released his book ''Religions of the World'' in 1963. By 1967 he returned to teaching Jesuit scholastics at two Jesuit theological schools in Illinois while working as a visiting professor at St. Paul University in Ottawa, where he taught furloughed missionaries classes in [[missiology]]. At this time he also began work for the Congregations for Religious and the Clergy in Rome to implement the renewal laid out in the documents of [[Vatican II]].<ref name=\"Wanderer\" />\n\nIn 1969 Hardon assisted in the founding of a union of religious called the Consortium Perfectae Caritatis. In 1971 he helped found the Institute on Religious Life. That same year Hardon and nine other notable American Catholics were summoned by [[Camaldolese]] abbot [[Ugo Modotti]] acting on behalf of [[Pope Paul VI]]. The group was tasked to create a Catholic media organization and met three times a year for periods of two to three days. Hardon told an interviewer this was because \"the Holy Father's mission was very clear: American Catholics must get some control of the media of social communication; otherwise, the pope feared for the survival of the Church in our country.\"<ref name=\"Inter\" /> A year later Modotti informed Hardon that the Pope had accepted his recommendation to replace him with Hardon should any thing befall the Abbot. Two weeks later Modotti was found dead in his bed and Hardon took over the mission.<ref name=\"Inter\" />\n\nIn 1972, Hardon furthered his media apostolate by founding Mark Communications in Canada. Through his work with the papacy he was later asked by Paul VI to start Pontifical Catechetical Institutes in the United States to ensure the correct catechetical formation of religious educators. Hardon assisted and supported those establishing these organizations, especially Msgr. Eugene Kevane.<ref name=\"EWTN\" />\n\nIn 1974 Hardon became a professor at St. John's University in New York City at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Catholic Doctrine. At this time he worked with the Sisters of Notre Dame of Chardon, Ohio to make ''Christ Our Life'', a series of religious textbooks for elementary students.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" />\n\nHardon continued to have health problems throughout his life. In 1981 he had a quadruple bypass at a hospital in Chicago, which would be his seventeenth hospitalization since joining the Jesuits.<ref name=Sacrifice/>\n\n== Controversy ==\nWhile teaching at St. John's, Hardon reacted to a woman's question about his thoughts on the [[Enneagram of Personality]]. He responded with an article listing his objections to the concept, viewing it as a New Age process dangerous to the Catholic faith. Soon after he was summoned to appear before his Jesuit superior to speak on the matter, at the conclusion of the meeting he was informed he would be forbidden to teach at any Jesuit institution.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" /> At the time of his death Hardon had not been allowed to teach at a Jesuit school for sixteen years. He viewed this as persecution for teaching the faith and saw it as \"[[Christian martyrs#Degrees of martyrdom|white martyrdom]]\" and when recalling it would advise his listeners that they should be willing to suffer for the true doctrines of Catholicism.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" /> Hardon was also rebuffed by the chancery of the Archdiocese of Detroit who refused to use any of his books in their catechetical materials and he was never invited to their conferences and seminars - though he was in high demand across the rest of the nation.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" /> The conservative Catholic newspaper ''[[The Wanderer (newspaper)|The Wanderer]]'' reported that Fr. Patrick Halfpenny, vice-rector of Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, had a standing order at ''The Michigan Catholic'' (the diocesan newspaper of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit|Archdiocese of Detroit]]) that Hardon's picture was not to be printed and also that if his name was to be mentioned at all it would be in the smallest font possible, due to Halfpenny's belief that \"He's divisive.\"<ref name=\"Wanderer\" /> ''The Wanderer'' also pointed out that at the Mass celebrating the 50th anniversary of his ordination at Assumption Grotto in Detroit, though attended by many friends, not a single Jesuit other than Hardon was there.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" />\n\n== Work ==\nFather Hardon was a very prominent member of the [[Jesuit]] community, which is known for its academic rigor, and wrote over forty books<ref name=\"Wanderer\">{{cite news|title=Fr.

In addition to his own works Hardon contributed to six encyclopedias.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" />\n\nHardon had a close working relationship with [[Pope Paul VI]], engaging in several initiatives at the Pope's request, including his authoring of ''The Catholic Catechism''. Paul VI apparently displeased with the controversial [[Dutch Catechism]] and in line with his letter ''Solemni Hac Liturgia'' (Credo of the people of God) requested that Hardon produce a volume to synthesize what Catholics must believe and present it in the English language.<ref name=\"McDermott\" />\n\nFather Hardon's work ''The Catholic Catechism'' was a significant post\u2013[[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] work in the sense that it essentially brought modern Catholic teaching and faith into one book, unlike any other before. At the time of his death it had sold over 150,000 in hardback, and as a 623-page paperback had reached its 26th printing selling over one million copies.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" />  It served as the normative standard until the publishing of 1992's ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', which is the official codified teaching of the Catholic Church, promulgated by [[Pope John Paul II]]. Hardon served as a consultant for the drafting of that document.\n\nHardon kept to a demanding work schedule, especially during the creation of the 1992 ''Catechism''. At that time, once daily demands for his advice as a local spiritual director lessened (around five or six pm), he would write and organize material and continue to work into the night (where upon it would be morning in Rome). He often received phone calls at this time from [[Pope Benedict XVI|Cardinal Ratzinger]] who sought his advice and input to fine tune the ''Catechism''.<ref name=\"McDermott\">{{cite video|title = Servant of God - Fr.

The course later was adapted and used to create two catechetical home study courses for lay Catholics.

Cardinal [[Raymond Leo Burke|Raymond Burke]], when he was serving as the Archbishop of St. Louis and was the national director of the Marian Catechist Apostolate (began by Hardon), initiated Father Hardon's cause for canonization in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://te-deum.blogspot.com/2006/09/national-catholic-register-st-john.html|title=St. John Hardon?|publisher=National Catholic Register|date=August 13, 2006|author=Joseph Pronechen}}</ref> Father Robert McDermott, a former student of Hardon's, was the postulator for the cause until moving to [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]], where he serves as associate pastor at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://olmckenosha.org/staff|title=OLMC Staff|publisher=Archdiocese of Milwaukee|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}</ref> An effort is underway to establish a Father Hardon library and study center at the [[Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe]] in [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]].\n\nA concern for Hardon's cause for canonization arose in early 2012 when documents concerning fellow Jesuit Donald McGuire surfaced and were featured in a story by Peter Jamison in the San Francisco Weekly. McGuire was arrested on charges of sex-abuse in 2005 and found guilty of sexually molesting boys in federal and state courts. An article in SF Weekly reported that during a visit to Saint John Vianney, Hardon had a frank conversation with McGuire in which the latter admitted to taking showers with his alleged victim, asking the boy to massage his body, and allowing him to possess pornography in the room they shared while traveling. McGuire denied additional allegations that he had touched the boy's genitals and watched him masturbate. Hardon was apparently satisfied with what he heard. As he wrote to Schaeffer, \"Regarding showering, Fr. Don said that it was true, but the picture is not one of a lingering sensual experience. It was rather the picture of two firemen, responding to an emergency, one of whom was seriously handicapped and in need of support and care from the other.\" On the body rubs: \"Regarding the massages, Fr. Don said they were done with attention to modesty and were necessary to relieve spasm at the 4th-5th lumbar disc and the right leg, involving the sciatic nerve.\" (The fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae are at the bottom of the spine, just above the buttocks.) And the dirty magazines: \"Regarding pornography Fr. Don said that there were Playboy and Penthouse magazines, which he neither got nor threw away.\" Hardon concluded in the letter, \"I do not believe there was any conscious and deliberate sexual perversity.\" He added, \"I do believe Fr. McGuire was acting on principles which, though objectively defensible, were highly imprudent.\" He told McGuire's bosses that he 'should be prudently allowed to engage in priestly ministry.'\u2026The situation is aggravated since McGuire went on to abuse more children after suggestions to return him to ministry were heeded.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2012-01-11/news/mother-teresa-catholic-church-john-hardon-donald-mcguire-child-abuse-jesuits/2/|title=Tainted Saint: Mother Teresa Defended Pedophile Priest|author=Peter Jamison|date=January 11, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* ''All My Liberty''\n* ''The Treasury of Catholic Wisdom''\n* ''A Prophet for the Priesthood''\n* ''With Us Today: On the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist''\n* ''The History of Eucharistic Adoration''\n* ''Modern Catholic Dictionary''\n* ''Theology of Prayer''\n* ''Spiritual Life in the Modern World''\n* ''Salvation and Sanctification''\n* ''Holiness in the Church''\n* ''The Faith''\n* ''History and Theology of Grace: The Catholic Teaching on Divine Grace''\n* ''The Question and Answer Catholic Catechism'', [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 1981. {{ISBN|978-0-385-13664-8}}\n* ''The Catholic Catechism: A Contemporary Catechism of the Teachings of the Catholic Church'', Doubleday, 1975. {{ISBN|978-0-385-50819-3}}\n* ''Retreat with the Lord: A Popular Guide to the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola''\n* ''The Pocket Catechism'', [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 1989. {{ISBN|978-0-385-24293-6}}\n* ''The Pocket Catholic Dictionary: Abridged Edition of a Modern Catholic Dictionary'', [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 1985. {{ISBN|978-0-385-23238-8}}\n* ''The Catholic Lifetime Reading Plan''\n* ''Catholic Prayer book''\n* ''Marian Catechist Manual''\n* ''Christianity in the Twentieth Century'', St. Paul Editions, 1977.\n* ''Religions of the World''\n\n== References ==\n;Specific references\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n;Other sources\n* [http://www.therealpresence.org/ Tribute page]\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.therealpresence.org/archives/archives.htm#nav List of on-line articles]\n* Archbishop Raymond L.

During these studies he produced his first published article in 1941 concerning the study of Latin.

Hardon later recalled:\n\n{{quote|Before I had retrieved one-half of the heretical books, I had become the agent of orthodoxy and therefore the sworn enemy of the modernists, who were updating the Catholic faith to its [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|modernist]] theology. I had doors slammed in my face.

Hardon was denied his request to be a missionary to post-War Japan (at the newly opened Jesuit University in Tokyo) due to his health.<ref name=\"EWTN\" /> Determined to be of some service for this endeavor, Hardon began to study [[comparative religion]].<ref name=\"EWTN\" /> During his studies of oriental religions he believed there were \"not only areas that were compatible with Christianity but also sections of thought that were clearly influenced in a direct manner by contact with the Christian message.\"<ref name=\"EWTN\" /> Hardon began using his extensive knowledge of Asian customs and religions to train missionaries for that region.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" />\n\nDuring this time Hardon pronounced his final vows on February 2, 1953 including the special [[Fourth vow|Jesuit vow of unwavering fidelity]] to the pope.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" />\n\nIn an effort to understand Protestantism he worked on a book released in 1956 entitled ''Protestant Churches in America'', which was met with critical acclaim even among Protestant circles. While still teaching full-time at West Baden, Hardon became a visiting professor invited to teach Catholic theology at several Protestant seminaries and colleges including Bethany School of Theology, Lutheran School of Theology, and Seabury-Western Divinity School.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" /> Janaro writes:\n\n{{quote|In this work he saw an opportunity to share the fullness of the faith with those baptized in Christ who, because of the circumstances of history, time and place, or culture, had yet to receive a complete understanding and appreciation of the Christian faith and of the Church that extends the power and presence of Jesus Christ.\"<ref name=\"Wanderer\" />}}\n\nThe novelty of the situation was not lost on his Protestant colleagues either, and upon his acceptance of a position at Seabury-Western Divinity school, the Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury sent a personal representative to mark the event - \"the first time in history an Anglican/Episcopalian seminary had appointed a teacher who was a member of the once hated and feared Society of Jesus.\"<ref name=\"Wanderer\" /> Hardon also served as an advisor to the Second Vatican Council on discussions about liturgy.<ref name=\"Pew\" />\n\nBetween 1962 and 1967 Fr. Hardon taught Roman Catholicism and Comparative Religion at Western Michigan University. He released his book ''Religions of the World'' in 1963. By 1967 he returned to teaching Jesuit scholastics at two Jesuit theological schools in Illinois while working as a visiting professor at St. Paul University in Ottawa, where he taught furloughed missionaries classes in [[missiology]]. At this time he also began work for the Congregations for Religious and the Clergy in Rome to implement the renewal laid out in the documents of [[Vatican II]].<ref name=\"Wanderer\" />\n\nIn 1969 Hardon assisted in the founding of a union of religious called the Consortium Perfectae Caritatis. In 1971 he helped found the Institute on Religious Life. That same year Hardon and nine other notable American Catholics were summoned by [[Camaldolese]] abbot [[Ugo Modotti]] acting on behalf of [[Pope Paul VI]]. The group was tasked to create a Catholic media organization and met three times a year for periods of two to three days. Hardon told an interviewer this was because \"the Holy Father's mission was very clear: American Catholics must get some control of the media of social communication; otherwise, the pope feared for the survival of the Church in our country.\"<ref name=\"Inter\" /> A year later Modotti informed Hardon that the Pope had accepted his recommendation to replace him with Hardon should any thing befall the Abbot. Two weeks later Modotti was found dead in his bed and Hardon took over the mission.<ref name=\"Inter\" />\n\nIn 1972, Hardon furthered his media apostolate by founding Mark Communications in Canada. Through his work with the papacy he was later asked by Paul VI to start Pontifical Catechetical Institutes in the United States to ensure the correct catechetical formation of religious educators. Hardon assisted and supported those establishing these organizations, especially Msgr. Eugene Kevane.<ref name=\"EWTN\" />\n\nIn 1974 Hardon became a professor at St. John's University in New York City at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Catholic Doctrine. At this time he worked with the Sisters of Notre Dame of Chardon, Ohio to make ''Christ Our Life'', a series of religious textbooks for elementary students.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" />\n\nHardon continued to have health problems throughout his life. In 1981 he had a quadruple bypass at a hospital in Chicago, which would be his seventeenth hospitalization since joining the Jesuits.<ref name=Sacrifice/>\n\n== Controversy ==\nWhile teaching at St. John's, Hardon reacted to a woman's question about his thoughts on the [[Enneagram of Personality]]. He responded with an article listing his objections to the concept, viewing it as a New Age process dangerous to the Catholic faith. Soon after he was summoned to appear before his Jesuit superior to speak on the matter, at the conclusion of the meeting he was informed he would be forbidden to teach at any Jesuit institution.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" /> At the time of his death Hardon had not been allowed to teach at a Jesuit school for sixteen years. He viewed this as persecution for teaching the faith and saw it as \"[[Christian martyrs#Degrees of martyrdom|white martyrdom]]\" and when recalling it would advise his listeners that they should be willing to suffer for the true doctrines of Catholicism.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" /> Hardon was also rebuffed by the chancery of the Archdiocese of Detroit who refused to use any of his books in their catechetical materials and he was never invited to their conferences and seminars - though he was in high demand across the rest of the nation.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" /> The conservative Catholic newspaper ''[[The Wanderer (newspaper)|The Wanderer]]'' reported that Fr. Patrick Halfpenny, vice-rector of Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, had a standing order at ''The Michigan Catholic'' (the diocesan newspaper of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit|Archdiocese of Detroit]]) that Hardon's picture was not to be printed and also that if his name was to be mentioned at all it would be in the smallest font possible, due to Halfpenny's belief that \"He's divisive.\"<ref name=\"Wanderer\" /> ''The Wanderer'' also pointed out that at the Mass celebrating the 50th anniversary of his ordination at Assumption Grotto in Detroit, though attended by many friends, not a single Jesuit other than Hardon was there.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" />\n\n== Work ==\nFather Hardon was a very prominent member of the [[Jesuit]] community, which is known for its academic rigor, and wrote over forty books<ref name=\"Wanderer\">{{cite news|title=Fr.

In addition to his own works Hardon contributed to six encyclopedias.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" />\n\nHardon had a close working relationship with [[Pope Paul VI]], engaging in several initiatives at the Pope's request, including his authoring of ''The Catholic Catechism''. Paul VI apparently displeased with the controversial [[Dutch Catechism]] and in line with his letter ''Solemni Hac Liturgia'' (Credo of the people of God) requested that Hardon produce a volume to synthesize what Catholics must believe and present it in the English language.<ref name=\"McDermott\" />\n\nFather Hardon's work ''The Catholic Catechism'' was a significant post\u2013[[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] work in the sense that it essentially brought modern Catholic teaching and faith into one book, unlike any other before. At the time of his death it had sold over 150,000 in hardback, and as a 623-page paperback had reached its 26th printing selling over one million copies.<ref name=\"Wanderer\" />  It served as the normative standard until the publishing of 1992's ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', which is the official codified teaching of the Catholic Church, promulgated by [[Pope John Paul II]]. Hardon served as a consultant for the drafting of that document.\n\nHardon kept to a demanding work schedule, especially during the creation of the 1992 ''Catechism''. At that time, once daily demands for his advice as a local spiritual director lessened (around five or six pm), he would write and organize material and continue to work into the night (where upon it would be morning in Rome). He often received phone calls at this time from [[Pope Benedict XVI|Cardinal Ratzinger]] who sought his advice and input to fine tune the ''Catechism''.<ref name=\"McDermott\">{{cite video|title = Servant of God - Fr.

The course later was adapted and used to create two catechetical home study courses for lay Catholics.

Cardinal [[Raymond Leo Burke|Raymond Burke]], when he was serving as the Archbishop of St. Louis and was the national director of the Marian Catechist Apostolate (began by Hardon), initiated Father Hardon's cause for canonization in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://te-deum.blogspot.com/2006/09/national-catholic-register-st-john.html|title=St. John Hardon?|publisher=National Catholic Register|date=August 13, 2006|author=Joseph Pronechen}}</ref> Father Robert McDermott, a former student of Hardon's, was the postulator for the cause until moving to [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]], where he serves as associate pastor at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://olmckenosha.org/staff|title=OLMC Staff|publisher=Archdiocese of Milwaukee|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}</ref> An effort is underway to establish a Father Hardon library and study center at the [[Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe]] in [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]].\n\nA concern for Hardon's cause for canonization arose in early 2012 when documents concerning fellow Jesuit Donald McGuire surfaced and were featured in a story by Peter Jamison in the San Francisco Weekly. McGuire was arrested on charges of sex-abuse in 2005 and found guilty of sexually molesting boys in federal and state courts. An article in SF Weekly reported that during a visit to Saint John Vianney, Hardon had a frank conversation with McGuire in which the latter admitted to taking showers with his alleged victim, asking the boy to massage his body, and allowing him to possess pornography in the room they shared while traveling. McGuire denied additional allegations that he had touched the boy's genitals and watched him masturbate. Hardon was apparently satisfied with what he heard. As he wrote to Schaeffer, \"Regarding showering, Fr. Don said that it was true, but the picture is not one of a lingering sensual experience. It was rather the picture of two firemen, responding to an emergency, one of whom was seriously handicapped and in need of support and care from the other.\" On the body rubs: \"Regarding the massages, Fr. Don said they were done with attention to modesty and were necessary to relieve spasm at the 4th-5th lumbar disc and the right leg, involving the sciatic nerve.\" (The fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae are at the bottom of the spine, just above the buttocks.) And the dirty magazines: \"Regarding pornography Fr. Don said that there were Playboy and Penthouse magazines, which he neither got nor threw away.\" Hardon concluded in the letter, \"I do not believe there was any conscious and deliberate sexual perversity.\" He added, \"I do believe Fr. McGuire was acting on principles which, though objectively defensible, were highly imprudent.\" He told McGuire's bosses that he 'should be prudently allowed to engage in priestly ministry.'\u2026The situation is aggravated since McGuire went on to abuse more children after suggestions to return him to ministry were heeded.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2012-01-11/news/mother-teresa-catholic-church-john-hardon-donald-mcguire-child-abuse-jesuits/2/|title=Tainted Saint: Mother Teresa Defended Pedophile Priest|author=Peter Jamison|date=January 11, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* ''All My Liberty''\n* ''The Treasury of Catholic Wisdom''\n* ''A Prophet for the Priesthood''\n* ''With Us Today: On the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist''\n* ''The History of Eucharistic Adoration''\n* ''Modern Catholic Dictionary''\n* ''Theology of Prayer''\n* ''Spiritual Life in the Modern World''\n* ''Salvation and Sanctification''\n* ''Holiness in the Church''\n* ''The Faith''\n* ''History and Theology of Grace: The Catholic Teaching on Divine Grace''\n* ''The Question and Answer Catholic Catechism'', [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 1981. {{ISBN|978-0-385-13664-8}}\n* ''The Catholic Catechism: A Contemporary Catechism of the Teachings of the Catholic Church'', Doubleday, 1975. {{ISBN|978-0-385-50819-3}}\n* ''Retreat with the Lord: A Popular Guide to the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola''\n* ''The Pocket Catechism'', [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 1989. {{ISBN|978-0-385-24293-6}}\n* ''The Pocket Catholic Dictionary: Abridged Edition of a Modern Catholic Dictionary'', [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 1985. {{ISBN|978-0-385-23238-8}}\n* ''The Catholic Lifetime Reading Plan''\n* ''Catholic Prayer book''\n* ''Marian Catechist Manual''\n* ''Christianity in the Twentieth Century'', St. Paul Editions, 1977.\n* ''Religions of the World''\n\n== References ==\n;Specific references\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n;Other sources\n* [http://www.therealpresence.org/ Tribute page]\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.therealpresence.org/archives/archives.htm#nav List of on-line articles]\n* Archbishop Raymond L.

[[Oliver Cromwell]] thereupon surrounded several colleges with soldiers, and took away by force the masters of Queens', [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]], and [[St. John's College, Cambridge|St. John's College]], and hurrying them to London, incarcerated them in the [[Tower of London]] by order of parliament. Martin was afterwards removed to [[William Petre, 4th Baron Petre|Lord Petre]]'s house in [[Aldersgate Street]], where he drew up the mock petition, entitled his ''Submission to the Covenant.''

In the meanwhile he was ejected from the presidency of Queens' College, and lost all his other preferments.\n\nAbout August 1648 he effected his escape, and went to [[Thorington]], [[Suffolk]], where he resided with Henry Cooke, who had been a member of his college. He assumed the name of Matthews, but was discovered by some soldiers from [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]], was brought to London, and on 23 May 1650 was committed to the [[Gatehouse Prison]] by [[John Bradshaw (judge)|John Bradshaw]], president of the council of state.

In 1638 he was instituted to the rectory of [[Houghton Conquest]], [[Bedfordshire]], and soon afterwards to that of [[Doddington, Cambridgeshire|Doddington]], Cambridgeshire.\n\nIn August 1642 he sent the college plate to the king. [[Oliver Cromwell]] thereupon surrounded several colleges with soldiers, and took away by force the masters of Queens', [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]], and [[St. John's College, Cambridge|St. John's College]], and hurrying them to London, incarcerated them in the [[Tower of London]] by order of parliament. Martin was afterwards removed to [[William Petre, 4th Baron Petre|Lord Petre]]'s house in [[Aldersgate Street]], where he drew up the mock petition, entitled his ''Submission to the Covenant.'' Subsequently he was remanded to [[Ely Place|Ely House]] and other places of confinement for more than five years. In the meanwhile he was ejected from the presidency of Queens' College, and lost all his other preferments.\n\nAbout August 1648 he effected his escape, and went to [[Thorington]], [[Suffolk]], where he resided with Henry Cooke, who had been a member of his college. He assumed the name of Matthews, but was discovered by some soldiers from [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]], was brought to London, and on 23 May 1650 was committed to the [[Gatehouse Prison]] by [[John Bradshaw (judge)|John Bradshaw]], president of the council of state. Ultimately, by some interest with Colonel Wanton, he obtained his release and a pardon for breaking prison. He then returned to Suffolk and resumed his own name; but subsequently he went abroad for seven or eight years, during most of which time he lived at Paris with [[Christopher Hatton, 1st Baron Hatton]]. In 1656 he was resident at [[Utrecht University|Utrecht]] with many other royalists.\n\nReturning to England at the Restoration, he was formally restored to the presidency of Queens' College, on 2 August 1660. He was one of the managers of the [[Savoy Conference]]. In February. 1662 he was nominated to the deanery of Ely, and was installed by proxy, 25 April 1662. He died three days afterwards on 28 April 1662, and was buried in the college chapel.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n;Attribution\n{{DNB|wstitle=Martin, Edward}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-aca}}\n{{succession box\n  | title  = [[Queens' College, Cambridge|President of Queens' College, Cambridge]]\n  | years  = 1631&ndash;1644\n  | before = [[John Mansell (Cambridge)|John Mansell]]\n  | after  = [[Herbert Palmer (Puritan)|Herbert Palmer]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n  | title  = [[Queens' College, Cambridge|President of Queens' College, Cambridge]]\n  | years  = 1660&ndash;1662\n  | before = [[Thomas Horton (Gresham College)|Thomas Horton]]\n  | after  = [[Anthony Sparrow]]\n}}\n{{end}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n{{Deans of Ely}}\n{{Presidents of Queens' College, Cambridge}}\n{{Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Martin, Edward}}\n[[Category:16th-century births]]\n[[Category:1662 deaths]]\n[[Category:17th-century English Anglican priests]]\n[[Category:Presidents of Queens' College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Participants in the Savoy Conference]]\n[[Category:16th-century English clergy]]\n[[Category:People of the Tudor period]]\n[[Category:Deans of Ely]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLife:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: Subsequently \u2192 Subsequently,, 1608-9 \u2192 1608\u20139", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Martin_(Queens%27)"}
