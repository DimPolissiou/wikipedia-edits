Her first action was during [[World War II]], immediately following the 7 December 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. ''Fanning'' continued to serve in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theatre]] throughout the war, and was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] 14 December 1945. She was one of the last ''Mahan''-class destroyers. ''Fanning'' and [[USS Dunlap (DD-384)|USS ''Dunlap'']] were built from the same basic ''Mahan'' design but slightly modified. Some sources refer to them as the ''Dunlap''-class destroyers.\n\n==History==\n''Fanning'' was launched 18 September 1936 by [[United Shipyards, Inc.]], [[New York City]]; sponsored by Miss Cora A. Marsh, great-great granddaughter of [[Lieutenant (U.S. Navy)|Lieutenant]] Fanning; and commissioned 8 October 1937, [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] [[E. H. Geiselman]], in command.\n\nTrials, fitting out, shakedown, and minor repairs occupied ''Fanning'' until 22 April 1938 when she joined [[USS Philadelphia (CL-41)|''Philadelphia'' (CL-41)]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], to escort the [[cruiser]] as she carried [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[President of the United States]] on a [[Caribbean]] cruise. After returning to New York on 11 May, she underwent overhaul, escorted MS ''Kungsholm'' with [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]], the Crown Prince of [[Sweden]], embarked, then sailed for the west coast to join the [[Battle Force]] in September. Based in [[San Diego, California]] the destroyer conducted antiaircraft gunnery, antisubmarine, and tactical exercises. In the next 3 years, ''Fanning''&#39;s schedule took her back to the Atlantic once and to [[Hawaii]] several times, all the while enhancing her battle readiness.\n\n===1941===\nThe [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941 found ''Fanning'' at sea with TF 8 returning to Pearl Harbor from [[Wake Island]] where [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|''Enterprise'' (CV-6)]] had delivered the squadron of [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] fighter planes which became Wake's only airborne defense. The force made a search, refueled at Pearl Harbor on 8 December, and the following day sortied to hunt submarines. They made several contacts. Aircraft from ''Enterprise'' sank [[Japanese submarine I-170]] on 10 December in {{coord|23|45|N|155|35|W|}}. ''Fanning'' sailed from Pearl Harbor with TF 8 on 19 December to relieve [[Wake Island]], however, the island fell before help could arrive, and the reinforcements were delivered to [[Midway Atoll|Midway]].\n\n===1942===\nIn mid-January 1942 while underway for [[Tutuila]], she encountered a blinding rainstorm during which she collided with [[USS Gridley (DD-380)|''Gridley'' (DD-380)]], badly damaging both ships. After emergency repairs at [[Pago Pago]], she returned to Pearl Harbor where her bow was restored.\n\n[[File:USS Fanning (DD-385) underway near USS Enterprise (CV-6) on 18 April 1942 (80-G-324232).jpg|thumb|USS ''Fanning'' and {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} in May 1942]]\nShe was part of TF&nbsp;16 which sailed on 8 April 1942 to rendezvous with TF&nbsp;18. This combined force, commanded by [[Vice Admiral]] [[William F. Halsey, Jr.]], and carrying the [[Doolittle Raid|Doolittle raiders]], was charged with launching the first American offensive against the Japanese homeland. Returning safely to Pearl Harbor on 25 April after the successful mission, she escorted an [[United States Army|Army]] tug to [[Canton Island]] and returned to [[San Francisco]] for needed repairs.\n\nThe destroyer made two voyages along the west coast and escorted three convoys to Pearl Harbor before 12 November when she joined TF&nbsp;11 for duty in the [[Solomon Islands]]. The rest of the year was spent in convoy and patrol among the islands.\n\n===1943===\nIn January 1943 she deployed with TF&nbsp;11 against the Japanese on [[Guadalcanal]]. From 20 to 25 February she assisted TF&nbsp;64 in supporting an occupation force on the [[Russell Islands]], participated in exercises and patrol, and steamed with TG&nbsp;36.3 to afford protection to troops occupying [[Munda Island]].\n\nIn September she escorted a transport convoy from [[Noumea]] to Guadalcanal. Late in the month she got underway with [[USS Case (DD-370)|''Case'' (DD-370)]], [[USS McCall (DD-400)|''McCall'' (DD-400)]], and [[USS Craven (DD-382)|''Craven'' (DD-382)]] for San Francisco and a period of overhaul. She completed the year in patrol and in training and exercise operations off the [[Aleutian Islands]].\n\n===1944===\nOn 19 January 1944 ''Fanning'' sailed with TG-58.4 for operations in the Marshalls where planes from [[USS Saratoga (CV-3)|''Saratoga'' (CV-3)]] struck at [[Wotje]], [[Taroa]], [[Utirik]], and [[Rongelap]] with a 4-day uninterrupted bombardment of [[Eniwetok]] which precursed a later all-out attack. For the remainder of the month ''Fanning'' and other units of the escort group shuttled between [[Kwajalein]] and Eniwetok, making 25 strikes in 19 days, and providing support for the amphibious landings on the latter island.\n\nIn March 1944 ''Fanning'', ''Saratoga'', [[USS Dunlap (DD-384)|''Dunlap'' (DD-384)]], and [[USS Cummings (DD-365)|''Cummings'' (DD-365)]] were ordered to report to the British [[Eastern Fleet]], primarily [[United Kingdom|British]] units reinforced with [[Australia]]n, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[France|French]] warships. The planned joint operations were intended to transfer operational expertise to the [[Fleet Air Arm]] aircrews, divert Japanese attention from American activities elsewhere and cripple Japanese mobility in the south east Asia region. {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}} and ''Saratoga'' launched air strikes against [[Sabang, Indonesia|Sabang]], [[Sumatra]], (19 April) to destroy refineries, storage and transportation facilities. On 17 May this powerful force hit [[Soerabaja]], [[Java (island)|Java]], where harbor facilities and refineries presented the chief targets.\n\nDetached from the Eastern Fleet late in May, ''Fanning'' set course for San Francisco with calls at [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] and [[Sydney]], Australia, and [[Noumea]] in passage. On 17 July she stood out for San Diego with [[USS Baltimore (CA-68)|''Baltimore'' (CA-68)]] and on the 21st escorted President Roosevelt, embarked in the cruiser, north to [[Adak Island|Adak]] and [[Kodiak, Alaska]]. On 7 August the President shifted to ''Cummings'' who got underway for Bremerton in company with ''Fanning'' and ''Dunlap''.\n\nThe destroyer engaged in shore bombardment and other exercises until 17 September when she again steamed for the forward areas. After escorting SS ''Antigua'' to Eniwetok, she patrolled with TG&nbsp;57.7 off [[Tinian]] and performed escort duty with TG&nbsp;30.2 for a diversionary strike against [[Marcus Island]] on 9 October.\n\n[[Image:USS Fanning 385-4.jpg|thumb|right|USS ''Fanning'' at Mare Island]]\n\n''Fanning'' sortied with TG&nbsp;38.1 on 16 October to screen a carrier group which launched two strikes against [[Luzon]] before moving in to support the [[Leyte Island|Leyte]] landings. 22 October found the group underway for refueling and replenishment at Ulithi but word of an advancing Japanese fleet caused them to reverse course and the destroyer sped to participate in the action at San Bernardino Strait.\n\nAfter logistics were completed at Ulithi, ''Fanning'' moved to [[Saipan]] to rejoin TG&nbsp;30.2 for a series of assaults on [[Iwo Jima]], the first of these on 11\u201312 November. An assignment as radar picket occupied her until 4 December when she returned to bombard Iwo on the 8th. During the third attack (24 and 27 December) she set a patrol vessel on fire.\n\n===1945===\nIn the strike on 5 January 1945 ''Fanning'' made contact with a small freighter who tried to ram her and raked her decks before taking a torpedo which sent her to the bottom.\n\n''Fanning'' rejoined the group for the bombardment of [[Chichi Jima]], but was soon detached to escort [[USS David W. Taylor (DD-551)|''David W. Taylor'' (DD-551)]] damaged by a mine, to Ulithi. She returned to the tenacious force once again off Iwo Jima on 24 January and teamed with ''Dunlap'' to sink a three ship convoy consisting of transport ''Yoneyama Maru''; and auxiliary minesweepers ''[[Japanese auxiliary minesweeper Showa Maru No. 7|Showa Maru No. 7]]'' and ''[[Japanese auxiliary minesweeper Keinan Maru|Keinan Maru]]''. She then assumed station as radar picket and air rescue ship, operating also in local escort duty and in training exercises with a submarine wolfpack through 22 March.\n\nThe remainder of the war was occupied with patrol and escort activities among the islands of Eniwetok, Iwo Jima, and [[Guam]]. On 19 September 1945 ''Fanning'' set course for the United States, arriving at [[Galveston, Texas]], on 23 October 1945.\n\n''Fanning'' was decommissioned under the command of [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] Earnest \"Bud\" Conant at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], on 14 December 1945 and later sold.\n\n''Fanning'' received four [[battle star]]s for World War II service.\n\n==References==\n*{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/f/fanning-ii.html}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|USS Fanning (DD-385)}}\n*[http://www.navsource.org/archives/05/385.htm navsource.org: USS ''Fanning'' (DD-385)]\n\n{{Mahan class destroyer}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fanning (Dd-385)}}\n[[Category:Mahan-class destroyers]]\n[[Category:World War II destroyers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Staten Island]]\n[[Category:United States Navy Connecticut-related ships]]\n[[Category:1936 ships]]\n", "text_old": "{{other ships|USS Fanning}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n\n{|{{Infobox ship begin}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image=[[Image:USS Fanning 385.jpg|300px|USS Fanning (DD-385)]]\n|Ship caption=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Hide header=\n|Ship country=United States\n|Ship flag={{USN flag|1945}}\n|Ship name=\n|Ship namesake=[[Nathaniel Fanning]]\n|Ship ordered=\n|Ship builder=[[United Shipyards, Inc.]], [[Staten Island]], [[New York City]]\n|Ship laid down=10 April 1935\n|Ship launched=18 September 1936 \n|Ship acquired=\n|Ship commissioned=8 October 1937\n|Ship decommissioned=14 December 1945\n|Ship in service=\n|Ship out of service=\n|Ship struck=28 January 1947\n|Ship reinstated=\n|Ship honours=\n|Ship fate=Sold 6 January 1948, broken up for scrap.\n|Ship status=\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n|Hide header=\n|Header caption=\n|Ship class=[[Mahan class destroyer|''Mahan''-class]] [[destroyer]]\n|Ship displacement=1,500&nbsp;tons\n|Ship length=341&nbsp;ft 4&nbsp;in (104&nbsp;m)\n|Ship beam=35&nbsp;ft (10.7&nbsp;m)\n|Ship draught=\n|Ship draft=9&nbsp;ft 10&nbsp;in (2.8&nbsp;m)\n|Ship propulsion=\n|Ship speed=37&nbsp;knots (69&nbsp;km/h)\n|Ship range=\n|Ship complement=158 officers and crew\n|Ship sensors=\n|Ship EW=\n|Ship armament=*5 \u00d7 [[5\"/38 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}}]] guns,\n*12 \u00d7 [[American 21 inch torpedo|21 inch (533 mm)]] [[torpedo tube]]s\n|Ship armour=\n|Ship armor=\n|Ship aircraft=\n|Ship aircraft facilities=\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n|}\n\n'''USS ''Fanning'' (DD-385)''' was a [[Mahan class destroyer|''Mahan''-class]] [[destroyer]], in the [[United States Navy]] named for [[Nathaniel Fanning]].

The narrations generally state that in March 632, Muhammad, while returning from his [[Farewell Pilgrimage]] alongside a large number of followers and companions, stopped at the oasis of Ghadir Khumm. There, he took Ali's hand and addressed the gathering. The point of contention between different sects is when Muhammad, whilst giving his speech, gave the proclamation \"Anyone who has me as his ''[[mawla]]'', has Ali as his ''mawla.''\" Some versions add the additional sentence \"O God, befriend the friend of Ali and be the enemy of his enemy.\"<ref name=Amir-Moezzi>{{cite journal |title=\"Ghad\u012br Khumm\" in: Encyclopaedia of Islam THREE|last1=Amir-Moezzi |first1=Mohammad Ali |editor1=Kate Fleet|editor2=Gundrun Kr\u00e4mer|editor-link2=Gudrun Kr\u00e4mer|editor3=Denis Matringe|editor4=John Nawas|editor5=Everett Rowson|authorlink1=Mohammad Ali Amir-Moezzi |date=2014 |ref=harv|doi = 10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_27419}}</ref>\n\n''Mawla'' has a number of meanings in [[Arabic]], with interpretations of Muhammad's use here being split along sectarian lines between the Sunni and Shia. Among the former group, the word is translated as \"friend\" or \"one who is loyal/close\" and that Muhammad was advocating that Ali was deserving of friendship and respect. Conversely, Shi'ites tend to view the meaning as being \"master\" or \"ruler\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.islamawareness.net/Deviant/Shia/ghadir.html |title=The Event of Ghadir Khumm in the Qur'an, Hadith, History |website=islamawareness.net |access-date=2005-09-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107160547/http://www.islamawareness.net/Deviant/Shia/ghadir.html |archive-date=2006-01-07 |url-status=live |ref=harv}}</ref> and that the statement was a clear designation of Ali being Muhammad's appointed successor.

While they were preparing his body, [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], and [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al Jarrah]] met with the leaders of Medina and elected Abu Bakr as caliph. Ali did not accept the caliphate of [[Abu Bakr]] and refused to pledge allegiance to him. This is indicated in both [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] ''sahih'' and authentic Hadith.\n\n[[File:Al-Kadhimiya Mosque, Kadhmain Shrine.jpg|300px|thumb|Left|[[Al-Kadhimiya Mosque]]]]\n[[Ibn Qutaybah]], a 9th-century [[Sunni]] Islamic scholar narrates of [[Ali]]:<blockquote>I am the servant of God and the brother of the Messenger of God. I am thus more worthy of this office than you. I shall not give allegiance to you [Abu Bakr & Umar] when it is more proper for you to give bay\u02bcah to me. You have seized this office from the Ansar using your tribal relationship to the Prophet as an argument against them. Would you then seize this office from us, the ahl al-bayt by force? Did you not claim before the Ansar that you were more worthy than they of the caliphate because Muhammad came from among you (but Muhammad was never from AbuBakr family) \u2013 and thus they gave you leadership and surrendered command? I now contend against you with the same argument\u2026It is we who are more worthy of the Messenger of God, living or dead. Give us our due right if you truly have faith in God, or else bear the charge of wilfully doing wrong... Umar, I will not yield to your commands: I shall not pledge loyalty to him.' Ultimately Abu Bakr said, \"O 'Ali! If you do not desire to give your bay'ah, I am not going to force you for the same.</blockquote>[[Ali]]'s wife, and daughter of [[Muhammad]], [[Fatimah]], refused to pledge allegiance to [[Abu Bakr]] and remained angry with him until she died due to the issues of [[Fadak]] and her inheritance from her father and the situation of [[Umar at Fatimah's house]]. This is stated in sahih Sunni Hadith, [[Sahih Bukhari]] and Sahih Muslim. [[Fatimah]] did not at all pledge allegiance or acknowledge or accept the caliphate of [[Abu Bakr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/search/?q=After+the+death+of+Allah+%27s+Apostle+Fatima+the+daughter+of+Allah%27s+Apostle+asked+Abu+Bakr+As-Siddiq+to+give+her,+her+share+of+inheritance+from+what+Allah%27s+Apostle+had+|title=After the death of Allah 's Apostle Fatima the daughter of Allah's Apostle asked Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to give her, her share of inheritance from what Allah's Apostle had (p. 1) \u2013 Sunnah.com \u2013 Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (\u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u0633\u0644\u0645)|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010055547/https://sunnah.com/search/?q=After+the+death+of+Allah+%27s+Apostle+Fatima+the+daughter+of+Allah%27s+Apostle+asked+Abu+Bakr+As-Siddiq+to+give+her%2C+her+share+of+inheritance+from+what+Allah%27s+Apostle+had+|archivedate=10 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Almost all of [[Banu Hashim]], [[Muhammad]]'s clan and many of the ''sahaba'', had supported [[Ali]]'s cause after the demise of the prophet whilst others supported [[Abu Bakr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/history-shiism-advent-islam-end-minor-occultation-muharrami/lesson-8-shiah-among-companions-sahabah|title=Lesson 8: The Shi\u02bbah among the Companions {sahabah}|website=Al-Islam.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729024723/https://www.al-islam.org/history-shiism-advent-islam-end-minor-occultation-muharrami/lesson-8-shiah-among-companions-sahabah|archivedate=29 July 2017|df=dmy-all|date=February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/house-sorrows-life-sayyidah-fatimah-al-zahra-and-her-grief-shaykh-abbas-qummi/chapter-3-state|title=Chapter 3: State of Affairs in Saqifah after the Death of the Prophet|website=Al-Islam.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729151253/https://www.al-islam.org/house-sorrows-life-sayyidah-fatimah-al-zahra-and-her-grief-shaykh-abbas-qummi/chapter-3-state|archivedate=29 July 2017|df=dmy-all|date=21 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicinsights.com/religion/clergy-corner/did-imam-ali-give-allegiance-to-abu-bakr.html|title=Did Imam Ali Give Allegiance to Abu Bakr?|publisher= Islamic Insights|date=8 December 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628084915/http://www.islamicinsights.com/religion/clergy-corner/did-imam-ali-give-allegiance-to-abu-bakr.html|archivedate=28 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Riz\u0324v\u012b, Sayyid Sa'eed Ak\u0332h\u0332tar.

In 680 CE, Muawiyah died and passed the caliphate to his son [[Yazid I|Yazid]], and breaking the treaty with Hasan ibn Ali. Yazid asked Husayn to swear allegiance (''[[bay'ah]]'') to him. Ali's faction, having expected the caliphate to return to Ali's line upon Muawiyah's death, saw this as a betrayal of the peace treaty and so Husayn rejected this request for allegiance. There was a groundswell of support in Kufa for Husayn to return there and take his position as caliph and imam, so Husayn collected his family and followers in Medina and set off for Kufa. En route to Kufa, he was blocked by an army of Yazid's men (which included people from Kufa) near Karbala (modern Iraq), and Husayn and approximately 72 of his family and followers were killed in the [[Battle of Karbala]].\n\nThe Shia regard Husayn as a martyr (''[[shahid]]''), and count him as an Imam from the Ahl al-Bayt.

For instance, the collection of hadith venerated by Shia Muslims is centered on narrations by members of the Ahl al-Bayt and their supporters, while some hadith by narrators not belonging to or supporting the Ahl al-Bayt are not included. Those of [[Abu Hurairah]], for example, Ibn Asakir in his Ta'rikh Kabir and Muttaqi in his Kanzu'l-Umma report that Caliph Umar lashed him, rebuked him and forbade him to narrate hadith from Muhammad. Umar said: \"Because you narrate hadith in large numbers from the Holy Prophet, you are fit only for attributing lies to him. (That is, one expects a wicked man like you to utter only lies about the Holy Prophet.) So you must stop narrating hadith from the Prophet; otherwise, I will send you to the land of Dus.\" (A clan in Yemen, to which Abu Huraira belonged.) According to Sunnis, Ali was the fourth successor to Abu Bakr, while the Shia maintain that Ali was the first divinely sanctioned \"Imam\", or successor of Muhammad.

The term ''Twelver'' is derived from the doctrine of believing in twelve divinely ordained leaders, known as [[The Twelve Imams]]. Twelver Shia are also known as ''Imami'' or ''Ja'fari'', originated from the name of the 6th Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq, who elaborated the Twelver jurisprudence.<ref>{{harvnb|Cornell|2007|p=237}}</ref>\n\nTwelvers constitute the majority of the population in [[Iran]] (90%),<ref>\"Esposito, John. \"What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam\" Oxford University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-515713-0}}. p. 45.</ref> Azerbaijan (85%),<ref name=\"Britannica738\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/atr_din.pdf|title=Administrative Department of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan \u2013 Presidential Library \u2013 Religion|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123084541/http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/atr_din.pdf|archivedate=23 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Bahrain (70%), Iraq (65%), Lebanon (65% of Muslims).<ref name=\"esp45\">Esposito, John. \"What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam\" Oxford University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-515713-0}}. p. 45</ref><ref name=\"glob\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/gulf/bahrain-religion.htm|title=Bahrain \u2013 Religion|author=John Pike|work=globalsecurity.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118214401/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/gulf/bahrain-religion.htm|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=review>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/25032011-challenges-for-saudi-arabia-amidst-protests-in-the-gulf-analysis/|title=Challenges For Saudi Arabia Amidst Protests In The Gulf \u2013 Analysis|work=Eurasia Review|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401034318/http://www.eurasiareview.com/25032011-challenges-for-saudi-arabia-amidst-protests-in-the-gulf-analysis/|archivedate=1 April 2012|df=dmy-all|date=25 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Doctrine====\n[[File:Names of imameen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Names of all 12 Imams (descendants of Imam Ali) written in the form of [[Language|Arabic]] name '''\u0639\u0644\u0649 ''' 'Ali']]\nTwelver doctrine is based on [[Theology of Twelvers|five principles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shiite-doctrine|title=Shi\u02bfite Doctrine|work=iranicaonline.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517022711/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shiite-doctrine|archivedate=17 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> These five principles known as ''Usul ad-Din'' are as follow:<ref>Joanne Richter, (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=X9fxXEdeIP8C&pg=PA7 ''Iran the Culture''], p. 7</ref><ref>Mulla Bashir Rahim, ''[http://www.al-islam.org/begin/intro/rahim.html An Introduction to Islam] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014001501/http://www.al-islam.org/begin/intro/rahim.html |date=14 October 2009 }}'', by [[Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project]]</ref>\n# '''[[Tawhid|Monotheism]]''', God is one and unique.\n# '''[[Adl|Justice]]''', the concept of moral rightness based on ethics, fairness, and equity, along with the punishment of the breach of these ethics.\n# '''[[Nubuwwah|Prophethood]]''', the institution by which God sends emissaries, or prophets, to guide mankind.\n# '''[[Imamate|Leadership]]''', a divine institution which succeeded the institution of Prophethood. Its appointees (imams) are divinely appointed.\n# '''Last Judgment''', God's final assessment of humanity.\n\nMore specifically, these principles are known as Usul al-Madhhab (principles of the Shia sect) according to Twelver Shias which differ from Daruriyat al-Din (Necessities of Religion) which are principles in order for one to be a Muslim. The Necessities of Religion do not include Leadership (Imamah) as it is not a requirement in order for one to be recognized as a Muslim. However, this category, according to Twelver scholars like Ayatollah al-Khoei, does include belief in God, Prophethood, the Day of Resurrection and other \"necessities\" (like belief in angels). In this regard, Twelver Shias draw a distinction in terms of believing in the main principles of Islam on the one hand, and specifically Shia doctrines like Imamah on the other.\n\n====Books====\nBesides the Quran which is common to all Muslims, the Shia derive guidance from books of traditions (\"\u1e25ad\u012bth\") attributed to Muhammad and the Twelve Imams. Below is a list of some of the most prominent of these books:\n* [[Nahj al-Balagha]] by [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] \u2013 the most famous collection of sermons, letters & narration by the first Imam regarded by Shias\n* [[al-Kafi]] by [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Islamic Texts Institute|title=Al-Kafi Book I: Intellect and Foolishness|year=2012|publisher=Taqwa Media|isbn=978-1-939420-00-8}}</ref>\n* Wasa'il al-Shi\u02bbah by al-Hurr al-Amili\n\n====The Twelve Imams====\n{{see also|The Twelve Imams|Hadith of the Twelve Successors|l2=Sunni reports about there being 12 successors to the Prophet}}\nThe ''Twelve Imams'' are the spiritual and political successors to Muhammad for the Twelvers.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} According to the theology of Twelvers, the successor of Muhammad is an [[Ismah|infallible]] human individual who not only rules over the community with justice but also is able to keep and interpret the divine law and its esoteric meaning. The words and deeds of Muhammad and the imams are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin, and Imams must be chosen by divine decree, or ''nass'', through Muhammad.<ref name=\"Nasr_a\" /><ref name=\"Momen 1985, p. 174\"/> Each imam was the son of the previous imam, with the exception of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein ibn Ali]], who was the brother of Hasan ibn Ali.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The twelfth and final imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive and in occultation.<ref name=\"Imamat\"/>\n\n====Jurisprudence====\n{{main|Ja'fari jurisprudence}}\n{{see also|Shia clergy}}\nThe Twelver jurisprudence is called ''Ja'fari jurisprudence''. In this [[jurisprudence]] ''Sunnah'' is considered to be the oral traditions of Muhammad and their implementation and interpretation by the twelve Imams. There are three schools of Ja'fari jurisprudence: Usuli, Akhbari, and [[Shaykhism|Shaykhi]]. The Usuli school is by far the largest of the three. Twelver groups that do not follow Ja'fari jurisprudence include [[Alevi]], [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi]], and [[Qizilbash]].\n\nThe five primary pillars of Islam to the Ja'fari jurisprudence, known as ''Usul' ad-Din''. They are at variance with the standard Sunni \"five pillars of religion.\"  The Shia's primary \"pillars\" are:\n\n# ''[[Tawhid]]'' or oneness of God.\n# ''[[Nabuwa]]'' prophethood of Muhammad.\n# ''[[Mu'ad]]'' resurrection.\n# ''[[Adl]]''  justice (of God)\n# ''[[Imama]]''  the rightful place of the Shia Imams\n\nIn Ja'fari jurisprudence, there are eight secondary pillars, known as ''Furu' ad-Din'', which are as follows:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=X9fxXEdeIP8C&pg=PA7 ''Iran the Culture''] Joanne Richter (2007), p. 7</ref>\n# ''[[salat|Prayer]]''\n# ''[[Sawm|Fasting]]''\n# ''[[Hajj|Pilgrimage]]'' to [[Mecca]]\n# ''[[Zak\u0101t|Alms giving]]''\n# ''[[Jihad|Struggle]]'' for the righteous cause\n# ''[[Ma'ruf|Directing others towards good]]''\n# ''[[Forbidding what is evil|Directing others away from evil]]''\n# ''[[Khums]])'' (20% tax on savings yearly, {after deduction of commercial expenses.})\n\nAccording to Twelvers, defining and interpretation of Islamic jurisprudence is the responsibility of Muhammad and the twelve Imams. As the 12th Imam is in occultation, it is the duty of clerics to refer to the Islamic literature such as the Quran and hadith and identify legal decisions within the confines of Islamic law to provide means to deal with current issues from an Islamic perspective. In other words, Twelver clerics provide Guardianship of the Islamic Jurisprudence, which was defined by Muhammad and his twelve successors. This process is known as ''Ijtihad'' and the clerics are known as ''[[Marja'|Marja]]''', meaning reference. The labels ''[[Allamah]]'' and ''[[Ayatollah]]'' are in use for Twelver clerics.\n\n===Zaidi (''Fiver'')===\n{{main|Zaidiyyah}}\n'''Zaidiyya''', '''Zaidism''' or '''Zaydi''' is a Shia school named after [[Zayd ibn Ali]]. Followers of the Zaidi [[fiqh]] are called Zaidis (or occasionally '''Fivers'''). However, there is also a group called ''Zaidi Was\u012bt\u012bs'' who are Twelvers (see below). Zaidis constitute roughly 42\u201347% of the population of Yemen.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Yemen|url=http://www.yemenincanada.ca/map.php|website=Yemeni in Canada|publisher=Embassy of the Republic of Yemen in Canada|accessdate=9 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127175930/http://www.yemenincanada.ca/map.php|archivedate=27 January 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Yemen [Yamaniyyah]: general data of the country|url=http://www.populstat.info/Asia/yemeng.htm|website=Population Statistics|accessdate=9 April 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041925/http://www.populstat.info/Asia/yemeng.htm|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Doctrine====\nThe Zaydis, Twelvers, and Ismailis all recognize the same first four Imams; however, the Zaidis consider Zayd ibn Ali as the fifth.

Zaidis also do not believe that the Imamate must pass from father to son but believe it can be held by any [[Sayyid]] descended from either Hasan ibn Ali or Hussein ibn Ali (as was the case after the death of Hasan ibn Ali). Historically, Zaidis held that Zayd was the rightful successor of the 4th imam since he led a rebellion against the Umayyads in protest of their tyranny and corruption. Muhammad al-Baqir did not engage in political action, and the followers of Zayd believed that a true imam must fight against corrupt rulers.\n\n====Jurisprudence====\nIn matters of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], the Zaydis follow Zayd ibn Ali's teachings which are documented in his book ''Majmu'l Fiqh'' (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{big|\u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0650\u0642\u0647}}).

Born in 386 AH (985), he ascended as ruler at the age of eleven. The typical religiously tolerant Fatimid Empire saw much persecution under his reign. When in 411 AH (1021) his mule returned without him, soaked in blood, a religious group that was forming in his lifetime broke off from mainstream Ismailism and did not acknowledge his successor.

Upon his passing away, his sons, [[Nizar (Fatimid Imam)|Nizar]] the older, and [[Al-Musta'li]], the younger, fought for political and spiritual control of the dynasty.

The Imam of the Age defines the jurisprudence, and his guidance may differ with Imams previous to him because of different times and circumstances. For Nizari Ismailis, the Imam is Karim al-Husayni [[Aga Khan IV]]. The Nizari line of Imams has continued to this day as an unending line.\n\nDivine leadership has continued in the Bohra branch through the institution of the \"Unrestricted Missionary\" [[List of Dai of Dawoodi Bohra|Dai]]. According to Bohra tradition, before the last Imam, At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim, went into seclusion, his father, the 20th Al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah, had instructed [[Al-Hurra Al-Malika]] the [[Malik]]a ([[Queen consort]]) in Yemen to appoint a vicegerent after the seclusion\u2014the ''Unrestricted Missionary'', who as the Imam's vicegerent has full authority to govern the community in all matters both spiritual and temporal while the lineage of Mustaali-Tayyibi Imams remains in seclusion (Dawr-e-Satr). The three branches of the Mustaali, the [[Alavi Bohra]], [[Sulaymani|Sulaimani Bohra]] and [[Dawoodi Bohra]], differ on who the current Unrestricted Missionary is.\n\n==Other doctrines==\n\n===Doctrine about necessity of acquiring knowledge===\nAccording to Allameh [[Muhammad Rida al-Muzaffar|Muzaffar]] God gives humans the faculty of reason and argument. Also, God orders humans to spend time thinking carefully on creation while he refers to all creations as his signs of power and glory. These signs encompass all of the universe. Furthermore, there is a similarity between humans as the little world and the universe as the large world. God does not accept the faith of those who follow him without thinking and only with imitation, but also God blames them for such actions.\nIn other words, humans have to think about the universe with reason and intellect, a faculty bestowed on us by God.  Since there is more insistence on the faculty of intellect among Shia, even evaluating the claims of someone who claims prophecy is on the basis of intellect.<ref>{{cite book|author=Allamah Muhammad Rida Al Muzaffar|title=The faith of Shia Islam|year=1989|page=1|publisher=Ansariyan Qum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.introducingislam.org/info/muzaffar/chapter1.php|title=The Beliefs of Shia Islam \u2013 Chapter 1|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025175646/http://www.introducingislam.org/info/muzaffar/chapter1.php|archivedate=25 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Doctrine concerning Du'a===\n\nPraying or Du\u02bca in Shia has an important place as Muhammad described it as a weapon of the believer. In fact, Du\u02bca considered as something that is a feature of Shia community in a sense. Performing Du\u02bca in Shia has a special ritual. Because of this, there are many books written on the conditions of praying among Shia.

Some sources, such as the ''[[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal]]'', do not record Muhammad's reaction to this, though Ibn Ishaq continues that he then declared Ali to be his brother, heir and successor.<ref>{{harvtxt|Rubin|1995|p=137}}</ref> In another narration, when Muhammad accepted Ali's offer, he \"threw up his arms around the generous youth, and pressed him to his bosom\" and said, \"Behold my brother, my vizir, my vicegerent&nbsp;... let all listen to his words, and obey him.\"<ref>{{citation|last=Irving|first=Washington|authorlink=Washington Irving|title=Mahomet and His Successors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlMLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA71|volume=I|year=1868|publisher=G.

The narrations generally state that in March 632, Muhammad, while returning from his [[Farewell Pilgrimage]] alongside a large number of followers and companions, stopped at the oasis of Ghadir Khumm. There, he took Ali's hand and addressed the gathering. The point of contention between different sects is when Muhammad, whilst giving his speech, gave the proclamation \"Anyone who has me as his ''[[mawla]]'', has Ali as his ''mawla.''\" Some versions add the additional sentence \"O God, befriend the friend of Ali and be the enemy of his enemy.\"<ref name=Amir-Moezzi>{{cite journal |title=\"Ghad\u012br Khumm\" in: Encyclopaedia of Islam THREE|last1=Amir-Moezzi |first1=Mohammad Ali |editor1=Kate Fleet|editor2=Gundrun Kr\u00e4mer|editor-link2=Gudrun Kr\u00e4mer|editor3=Denis Matringe|editor4=John Nawas|editor5=Everett Rowson|authorlink1=Mohammad Ali Amir-Moezzi |date=2014 |ref=harv|doi = 10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_27419}}</ref>\n\n''Mawla'' has a number of meanings in [[Arabic]], with interpretations of Muhammad's use here being split along sectarian lines between the Sunni and Shia. Among the former group, the word is translated as \"friend\" or \"one who is loyal/close\" and that Muhammad was advocating that Ali was deserving of friendship and respect.

While they were preparing his body, [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], and [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al Jarrah]] met with the leaders of Medina and elected Abu Bakr as caliph. Ali did not accept the caliphate of [[Abu Bakr]] and refused to pledge allegiance to him. This is indicated in both [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] ''sahih'' and authentic Hadith.\n\n[[File:Al-Kadhimiya Mosque, Kadhmain Shrine.jpg|300px|thumb|Left|[[Al-Kadhimiya Mosque]]]]\n[[Ibn Qutaybah]], a 9th-century [[Sunni]] Islamic scholar narrates of [[Ali]]:<blockquote>I am the servant of God and the brother of the Messenger of God. I am thus more worthy of this office than you. I shall not give allegiance to you [Abu Bakr & Umar] when it is more proper for you to give bay\u02bcah to me. You have seized this office from the Ansar using your tribal relationship to the Prophet as an argument against them. Would you then seize this office from us, the ahl al-bayt by force? Did you not claim before the Ansar that you were more worthy than they of the caliphate because Muhammad came from among you (but Muhammad was never from AbuBakr family) \u2013 and thus they gave you leadership and surrendered command? I now contend against you with the same argument\u2026It is we who are more worthy of the Messenger of God, living or dead. Give us our due right if you truly have faith in God, or else bear the charge of wilfully doing wrong... Umar, I will not yield to your commands: I shall not pledge loyalty to him.' Ultimately Abu Bakr said, \"O 'Ali! If you do not desire to give your bay'ah, I am not going to force you for the same.</blockquote>[[Ali]]'s wife, and daughter of [[Muhammad]], [[Fatimah]], refused to pledge allegiance to [[Abu Bakr]] and remained angry with him until she died due to the issues of [[Fadak]] and her inheritance from her father and the situation of [[Umar at Fatimah's house]]. This is stated in sahih Sunni Hadith, [[Sahih Bukhari]] and Sahih Muslim. [[Fatimah]] did not at all pledge allegiance or acknowledge or accept the caliphate of [[Abu Bakr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/search/?q=After+the+death+of+Allah+%27s+Apostle+Fatima+the+daughter+of+Allah%27s+Apostle+asked+Abu+Bakr+As-Siddiq+to+give+her,+her+share+of+inheritance+from+what+Allah%27s+Apostle+had+|title=After the death of Allah 's Apostle Fatima the daughter of Allah's Apostle asked Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to give her, her share of inheritance from what Allah's Apostle had (p. 1) \u2013 Sunnah.com \u2013 Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (\u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u0633\u0644\u0645)|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010055547/https://sunnah.com/search/?q=After+the+death+of+Allah+%27s+Apostle+Fatima+the+daughter+of+Allah%27s+Apostle+asked+Abu+Bakr+As-Siddiq+to+give+her%2C+her+share+of+inheritance+from+what+Allah%27s+Apostle+had+|archivedate=10 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Almost all of [[Banu Hashim]], [[Muhammad]]'s clan and many of the ''sahaba'', had supported [[Ali]]'s cause after the demise of the prophet whilst others supported [[Abu Bakr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/history-shiism-advent-islam-end-minor-occultation-muharrami/lesson-8-shiah-among-companions-sahabah|title=Lesson 8: The Shi\u02bbah among the Companions {sahabah}|website=Al-Islam.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729024723/https://www.al-islam.org/history-shiism-advent-islam-end-minor-occultation-muharrami/lesson-8-shiah-among-companions-sahabah|archivedate=29 July 2017|df=dmy-all|date=February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/house-sorrows-life-sayyidah-fatimah-al-zahra-and-her-grief-shaykh-abbas-qummi/chapter-3-state|title=Chapter 3: State of Affairs in Saqifah after the Death of the Prophet|website=Al-Islam.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729151253/https://www.al-islam.org/house-sorrows-life-sayyidah-fatimah-al-zahra-and-her-grief-shaykh-abbas-qummi/chapter-3-state|archivedate=29 July 2017|df=dmy-all|date=21 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicinsights.com/religion/clergy-corner/did-imam-ali-give-allegiance-to-abu-bakr.html|title=Did Imam Ali Give Allegiance to Abu Bakr?|publisher= Islamic Insights|date=8 December 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628084915/http://www.islamicinsights.com/religion/clergy-corner/did-imam-ali-give-allegiance-to-abu-bakr.html|archivedate=28 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Riz\u0324v\u012b, Sayyid Sa'eed Ak\u0332h\u0332tar.

In 680 CE, Muawiyah died and passed the caliphate to his son [[Yazid I|Yazid]], and breaking the treaty with Hasan ibn Ali. Yazid asked Husayn to swear allegiance (''[[bay'ah]]'') to him. Ali's faction, having expected the caliphate to return to Ali's line upon Muawiyah's death, saw this as a betrayal of the peace treaty and so Husayn rejected this request for allegiance. There was a groundswell of support in Kufa for Husayn to return there and take his position as caliph and imam, so Husayn collected his family and followers in Medina and set off for Kufa. En route to Kufa, he was blocked by an army of Yazid's men (which included people from Kufa) near Karbala (modern Iraq), and Husayn and approximately 72 of his family and followers were killed in the [[Battle of Karbala]].\n\nThe Shia regard Husayn as a martyr (''[[shahid]]''), and count him as an Imam from the Ahl al-Bayt. They view Husayn as the defender of Islam from annihilation at the hands of [[Yazid I]].

For instance, the collection of hadith venerated by Shia Muslims is centered on narrations by members of the Ahl al-Bayt and their supporters, while some hadith by narrators not belonging to or supporting the Ahl al-Bayt are not included. Those of [[Abu Hurairah]], for example, Ibn Asakir in his Ta'rikh Kabir and Muttaqi in his Kanzu'l-Umma report that Caliph Umar lashed him, rebuked him and forbade him to narrate hadith from Muhammad. Umar said: \"Because you narrate hadith in large numbers from the Holy Prophet, you are fit only for attributing lies to him. (That is, one expects a wicked man like you to utter only lies about the Holy Prophet.) So you must stop narrating hadith from the Prophet; otherwise, I will send you to the land of Dus.\" (A clan in Yemen, to which Abu Huraira belonged.) According to Sunnis, Ali was the fourth successor to Abu Bakr, while the Shia maintain that Ali was the first divinely sanctioned \"Imam\", or successor of Muhammad. The seminal event in Shia history is the martyrdom in 680 CE at the [[Battle of Karbala]] of Ali's son [[Hussein ibn Ali]], who led a non-allegiance movement against the defiant caliph (71 of Hussein's followers were killed as well).\nIt is believed in Twelver and Ismaili Shia Islam that [['aql]], divine wisdom, was the source of the souls of the prophets and imams and gave them esoteric knowledge called ''\u1e25ikmah'' and that their sufferings were a means of divine grace to their devotees.<ref>Corbin 1993, pp. 45\u201351</ref><ref>Nasr (1979), p. 15</ref> Although the imam was not the recipient of a [[wahy|divine revelation]], he had a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the imam, in turn, guides the people.

This caused a number of changes in the Muslim world:\n* The ending of the relative mutual tolerance between Sunnis and Shias that existed from the time of the [[Mongol conquests]] onwards and the resurgence of antagonism between the two groups.\n* Initial dependence of Shiite clerics on the state followed by the emergence of an independent body of ''[[ulama]]'' capable of taking a political stand different from official policies.<ref>Francis Robinson, ''Atlas of the Muslim World'', p. 49.</ref>\n* The growth in importance of Iranian centers of religious learning and change from Twelver Shiism being a predominantly [[Arab people|Arab]] phenomenon.<ref>{{harvnb|Momen|1985|p=123}}</ref>\n* The growth of the [[Akhbari]] School which preached that only the [[Qur'an and Sunnah|Quran, hadith]] are to be bases for verdicts, rejecting the use of reasoning.\n\nWith the fall of the Safavids, the state in Persia\u2014including the state system of courts with government-appointed judges ([[qadi]]s)\u2014became much weaker. This gave the Sharia courts of ''[[mujtahid]]s'' an opportunity to fill the legal vacuum and enabled the ulama to assert their judicial authority.

The Sunni Shahada states ''There is no god except God, Muhammad is the messenger of God'', but to this the Shia append ''Ali is the [[Wali]] (custodian) of God'', {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0644\u064a \u0648\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647}}. This phrase embodies the Shia emphasis on the inheritance of authority through Muhammad's lineage. The three clauses of the Shia Shahada thus address ''[[tawhid]]'' (the unity of [[God]]), ''[[nubuwwah]]'' (the prophethood of Muhammad), and ''[[imamah]]'' (imamate, the leadership of the faith).\n\nThe basis of Ali as the \"wali\" is taken from a specific verse of the quran\n.<ref>quran 5:55</ref>  A more detailed discussion of this verse is available.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verse_of_Wilayah | title=Verse of Wilayah}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Infallibility==\n[[File:Al\u012b.png|thumb|[[Ali]] is credited as the first male to convert to [[Islam]].]]\n{{main|Ismah}}\n''Ismah'' is the concept of [[infallibility]] or \"divinely bestowed freedom from error and sin\" in Islam.<ref>Dabashi, ''Theology of Discontent'', p. 463</ref> Muslims believe that Muhammad and other prophets in Islam possessed ''ismah''. Twelver and Ismaili Shia Muslims also attribute the quality to [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imams]] as well as to [[Fatimah]], daughter of Muhammad, in contrast to the Zaidi, who do not attribute 'ismah to the Imams.<ref>Francis Robinson, ''Atlas of the Muslim World'', p. 47.</ref> Though initially beginning as a political movement, infallibility and sinlessness of the imams later evolved as a distinct belief of (non-Zaidi) Shiism.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Shii | title=Sh\u012b\u02bfite | work=Britannica | accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Shia theologians, infallibility is considered a rational necessary precondition for spiritual and religious guidance. They argue that since God has commanded absolute obedience from these figures they must only order that which is right. The state of infallibility is based on the Shia interpretation of [[the verse of purification]].<ref>{{Cite quran|33|33|s=ns}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Momen|1985|p=155}}</ref> Thus, they are the most pure ones, the only immaculate ones preserved from, and immune to, all uncleanness.<ref>Corbin (1993), pp. 48 and 49</ref> It does not mean that supernatural powers prevent them from committing a sin, but due to the fact that they have absolute belief in God, they refrain from doing anything that is a sin.<ref name=\"Dabashi\">Dabashi (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=sTFdNNQP4ewC&pg=PA463 p. 463]</ref>\n\nThey also have a complete knowledge of God's will.

They thus act without fault in religious matters.<ref>Corbin (1993), p. 48</ref> Shias regard Ali as the successor of Muhammad not only ruling over [[Ummah|the community]] in justice, but also interpreting Islamic practices and its esoteric meaning.

The groups which do believe in it differ as to which lineage of the Imamate is valid, and therefore which individual has gone into occultation. They believe there are many signs that will indicate the time of his return.\n\nTwelver Shia Muslims believe that the Mahdi (the [[Twelve Imams|twelfth imam]], [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]]) is already on Earth, is in occultation and will return at the end of time.

The term ''Twelver'' is derived from the doctrine of believing in twelve divinely ordained leaders, known as [[The Twelve Imams]]. Twelver Shia are also known as ''Imami'' or ''Ja'fari'', originated from the name of the 6th Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq, who elaborated the Twelver jurisprudence.<ref>{{harvnb|Cornell|2007|p=237}}</ref>\n\nTwelvers constitute the majority of the population in [[Iran]] (90%),<ref>\"Esposito, John. \"What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam\" Oxford University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-515713-0}}. p. 45.</ref> Azerbaijan (85%),<ref name=\"Britannica738\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/atr_din.pdf|title=Administrative Department of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan \u2013 Presidential Library \u2013 Religion|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123084541/http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/atr_din.pdf|archivedate=23 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Bahrain (70%), Iraq (65%), Lebanon (65% of Muslims).<ref name=\"esp45\">Esposito, John. \"What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam\" Oxford University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-515713-0}}. p. 45</ref><ref name=\"glob\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/gulf/bahrain-religion.htm|title=Bahrain \u2013 Religion|author=John Pike|work=globalsecurity.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118214401/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/gulf/bahrain-religion.htm|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=review>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/25032011-challenges-for-saudi-arabia-amidst-protests-in-the-gulf-analysis/|title=Challenges For Saudi Arabia Amidst Protests In The Gulf \u2013 Analysis|work=Eurasia Review|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401034318/http://www.eurasiareview.com/25032011-challenges-for-saudi-arabia-amidst-protests-in-the-gulf-analysis/|archivedate=1 April 2012|df=dmy-all|date=25 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Doctrine====\n[[File:Names of imameen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Names of all 12 Imams (descendants of Imam Ali) written in the form of [[Language|Arabic]] name '''\u0639\u0644\u0649 ''' 'Ali']]\nTwelver doctrine is based on [[Theology of Twelvers|five principles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shiite-doctrine|title=Shi\u02bfite Doctrine|work=iranicaonline.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517022711/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shiite-doctrine|archivedate=17 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> These five principles known as ''Usul ad-Din'' are as follow:<ref>Joanne Richter, (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=X9fxXEdeIP8C&pg=PA7 ''Iran the Culture''], p. 7</ref><ref>Mulla Bashir Rahim, ''[http://www.al-islam.org/begin/intro/rahim.html An Introduction to Islam] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014001501/http://www.al-islam.org/begin/intro/rahim.html |date=14 October 2009 }}'', by [[Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project]]</ref>\n# '''[[Tawhid|Monotheism]]''', God is one and unique.\n# '''[[Adl|Justice]]''', the concept of moral rightness based on ethics, fairness, and equity, along with the punishment of the breach of these ethics.\n# '''[[Nubuwwah|Prophethood]]''', the institution by which God sends emissaries, or prophets, to guide mankind.\n# '''[[Imamate|Leadership]]''', a divine institution which succeeded the institution of Prophethood. Its appointees (imams) are divinely appointed.\n# '''Last Judgment''', God's final assessment of humanity.\n\nMore specifically, these principles are known as Usul al-Madhhab (principles of the Shia sect) according to Twelver Shias which differ from Daruriyat al-Din (Necessities of Religion) which are principles in order for one to be a Muslim. The Necessities of Religion do not include Leadership (Imamah) as it is not a requirement in order for one to be recognized as a Muslim. However, this category, according to Twelver scholars like Ayatollah al-Khoei, does include belief in God, Prophethood, the Day of Resurrection and other \"necessities\" (like belief in angels). In this regard, Twelver Shias draw a distinction in terms of believing in the main principles of Islam on the one hand, and specifically Shia doctrines like Imamah on the other.\n\n====Books====\nBesides the Quran which is common to all Muslims, the Shia derive guidance from books of traditions (\"\u1e25ad\u012bth\") attributed to Muhammad and the Twelve Imams. Below is a list of some of the most prominent of these books:\n* [[Nahj al-Balagha]] by [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] \u2013 the most famous collection of sermons, letters & narration by the first Imam regarded by Shias\n* [[al-Kafi]] by [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Islamic Texts Institute|title=Al-Kafi Book I: Intellect and Foolishness|year=2012|publisher=Taqwa Media|isbn=978-1-939420-00-8}}</ref>\n* Wasa'il al-Shi\u02bbah by al-Hurr al-Amili\n\n====The Twelve Imams====\n{{see also|The Twelve Imams|Hadith of the Twelve Successors|l2=Sunni reports about there being 12 successors to the Prophet}}\nThe ''Twelve Imams'' are the spiritual and political successors to Muhammad for the Twelvers.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} According to the theology of Twelvers, the successor of Muhammad is an [[Ismah|infallible]] human individual who not only rules over the community with justice but also is able to keep and interpret the divine law and its esoteric meaning. The words and deeds of Muhammad and the imams are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin, and Imams must be chosen by divine decree, or ''nass'', through Muhammad.<ref name=\"Nasr_a\" /><ref name=\"Momen 1985, p. 174\"/> Each imam was the son of the previous imam, with the exception of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein ibn Ali]], who was the brother of Hasan ibn Ali.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The twelfth and final imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive and in occultation.<ref name=\"Imamat\"/>\n\n====Jurisprudence====\n{{main|Ja'fari jurisprudence}}\n{{see also|Shia clergy}}\nThe Twelver jurisprudence is called ''Ja'fari jurisprudence''. In this [[jurisprudence]] ''Sunnah'' is considered to be the oral traditions of Muhammad and their implementation and interpretation by the twelve Imams. There are three schools of Ja'fari jurisprudence: Usuli, Akhbari, and [[Shaykhism|Shaykhi]]. The Usuli school is by far the largest of the three. Twelver groups that do not follow Ja'fari jurisprudence include [[Alevi]], [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi]], and [[Qizilbash]].\n\nThe five primary pillars of Islam to the Ja'fari jurisprudence, known as ''Usul' ad-Din''. They are at variance with the standard Sunni \"five pillars of religion.\"  The Shia's primary \"pillars\" are:\n\n# ''[[Tawhid]]'' or oneness of God.\n# ''[[Nabuwa]]'' prophethood of Muhammad.\n# ''[[Mu'ad]]'' resurrection.\n# ''[[Adl]]''  justice (of God)\n# ''[[Imama]]''  the rightful place of the Shia Imams\n\nIn Ja'fari jurisprudence, there are eight secondary pillars, known as ''Furu' ad-Din'', which are as follows:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=X9fxXEdeIP8C&pg=PA7 ''Iran the Culture''] Joanne Richter (2007), p. 7</ref>\n# ''[[salat|Prayer]]''\n# ''[[Sawm|Fasting]]''\n# ''[[Hajj|Pilgrimage]]'' to [[Mecca]]\n# ''[[Zak\u0101t|Alms giving]]''\n# ''[[Jihad|Struggle]]'' for the righteous cause\n# ''[[Ma'ruf|Directing others towards good]]''\n# ''[[Forbidding what is evil|Directing others away from evil]]''\n# ''[[Khums]])'' (20% tax on savings yearly, {after deduction of commercial expenses.})\n\nAccording to Twelvers, defining and interpretation of Islamic jurisprudence is the responsibility of Muhammad and the twelve Imams. As the 12th Imam is in occultation, it is the duty of clerics to refer to the Islamic literature such as the Quran and hadith and identify legal decisions within the confines of Islamic law to provide means to deal with current issues from an Islamic perspective. In other words, Twelver clerics provide Guardianship of the Islamic Jurisprudence, which was defined by Muhammad and his twelve successors. This process is known as ''Ijtihad'' and the clerics are known as ''[[Marja'|Marja]]''', meaning reference.

Followers of the Zaidi [[fiqh]] are called Zaidis (or occasionally '''Fivers'''). However, there is also a group called ''Zaidi Was\u012bt\u012bs'' who are Twelvers (see below).

Zaidis also do not believe that the Imamate must pass from father to son but believe it can be held by any [[Sayyid]] descended from either Hasan ibn Ali or Hussein ibn Ali (as was the case after the death of Hasan ibn Ali). Historically, Zaidis held that Zayd was the rightful successor of the 4th imam since he led a rebellion against the Umayyads in protest of their tyranny and corruption. Muhammad al-Baqir did not engage in political action, and the followers of Zayd believed that a true imam must fight against corrupt rulers.\n\n====Jurisprudence====\nIn matters of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], the Zaydis follow Zayd ibn Ali's teachings which are documented in his book ''Majmu'l Fiqh'' (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{big|\u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0650\u0642\u0647}}).

With the eventual development of Twelverism into the more literalistic ''([[Zahir (Islam)|zahir]])'' oriented Akhbari and later Usuli schools of thought, Shi'ism developed in two separate directions: the metaphorical Ismailli group focusing on the [[mysticism|mystical]] path and nature of God and the divine manifestation in the personage of the \"Imam of the Time\" as the \"Face of God\", with the more literalistic Twelver group focusing on divine law (''shar\u012b'ah'') and the deeds and sayings (''sunnah'') of Muhammad and his successors (the ''Ahlu l-Bayt''), who as A'immah were guides and a light to God.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/ahsai1.htm | title = Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsa'i | accessdate = 25 April 2007 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070218072512/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/ahsai1.htm | archivedate = 18 February 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThough there are several sub-groupings within the Ismailis, the term in today's vernacular generally refers to the Shia Imami Ismaili Muslim ([[Nizari]] community), generally known as the Ismailis, who are followers of the [[Aga Khan]] and the largest group among the Ismailiyyah.

During this period, three lineages of imams formed. The first branch, known today as the [[Druze]], began with [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]]. Born in 386 AH (985), he ascended as ruler at the age of eleven. The typical religiously tolerant Fatimid Empire saw much persecution under his reign. When in 411 AH (1021) his mule returned without him, soaked in blood, a religious group that was forming in his lifetime broke off from mainstream Ismailism and did not acknowledge his successor.

Upon his passing away, his sons, [[Nizar (Fatimid Imam)|Nizar]] the older, and [[Al-Musta'li]], the younger, fought for political and spiritual control of the dynasty.

The Imam of the Age defines the jurisprudence, and his guidance may differ with Imams previous to him because of different times and circumstances. For Nizari Ismailis, the Imam is Karim al-Husayni [[Aga Khan IV]]. The Nizari line of Imams has continued to this day as an unending line.\n\nDivine leadership has continued in the Bohra branch through the institution of the \"Unrestricted Missionary\" [[List of Dai of Dawoodi Bohra|Dai]]. According to Bohra tradition, before the last Imam, At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim, went into seclusion, his father, the 20th Al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah, had instructed [[Al-Hurra Al-Malika]] the [[Malik]]a ([[Queen consort]]) in Yemen to appoint a vicegerent after the seclusion\u2014the ''Unrestricted Missionary'', who as the Imam's vicegerent has full authority to govern the community in all matters both spiritual and temporal while the lineage of Mustaali-Tayyibi Imams remains in seclusion (Dawr-e-Satr). The three branches of the Mustaali, the [[Alavi Bohra]], [[Sulaymani|Sulaimani Bohra]] and [[Dawoodi Bohra]], differ on who the current Unrestricted Missionary is.\n\n==Other doctrines==\n\n===Doctrine about necessity of acquiring knowledge===\nAccording to Allameh [[Muhammad Rida al-Muzaffar|Muzaffar]] God gives humans the faculty of reason and argument. Also, God orders humans to spend time thinking carefully on creation while he refers to all creations as his signs of power and glory. These signs encompass all of the universe. Furthermore, there is a similarity between humans as the little world and the universe as the large world. God does not accept the faith of those who follow him without thinking and only with imitation, but also God blames them for such actions.\nIn other words, humans have to think about the universe with reason and intellect, a faculty bestowed on us by God.  Since there is more insistence on the faculty of intellect among Shia, even evaluating the claims of someone who claims prophecy is on the basis of intellect.<ref>{{cite book|author=Allamah Muhammad Rida Al Muzaffar|title=The faith of Shia Islam|year=1989|page=1|publisher=Ansariyan Qum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.introducingislam.org/info/muzaffar/chapter1.php|title=The Beliefs of Shia Islam \u2013 Chapter 1|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025175646/http://www.introducingislam.org/info/muzaffar/chapter1.php|archivedate=25 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Doctrine concerning Du'a===\n\nPraying or Du\u02bca in Shia has an important place as Muhammad described it as a weapon of the believer. In fact, Du\u02bca considered as something that is a feature of Shia community in a sense. Performing Du\u02bca in Shia has a special ritual. Because of this, there are many books written on the conditions of praying among Shia.

{"title_page": "2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}\n[[File:Pedro Alvares Cabral.jpg|thumb|Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]]\nThe '''Second [[Portuguese India Armadas|Portuguese India Armada]]''' was assembled in 1500 on the order of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and placed under the command of [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]].  Cabral's armada famously discovered [[Brazil]] for the Portuguese crown along the way. By and large, the 2nd Armada's diplomatic mission to [[India]] failed, and provoked the opening of hostilities between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the feudal city-state of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], ruled by [[Zamorin]]s.  Nonetheless, it managed to establish a factory in the nearby [[Kingdom of Cochin]], the first Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Asia.\n\n== Fleet ==\n\nThe [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first India Armada]], commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]], arrived in Portugal in the summer of 1499, in rather sorry shape. Half of his ships and men had been lost thanks to battles, disease, and storms. Although da Gama came back with a hefty cargo of spices that would be sold at enormous profit, he had failed in the principal objective of his mission: to negotiate a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], the spice entrep\u00f4t on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India. Da Gama managed, however, to open the [[Portuguese India Armadas|sea route to India]] via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and secured good relations with the African city-state of [[Malindi]], a critical staging post along the way.\n\nOn the orders of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], arrangements were immediately made to begin the assembly of a second armada in [[Cascais]].  Determined not to repeat da Gama's mistakes, this one was to be a large and well-armed fleet of 13 ships and 1500 men, laden with valuable gifts and diplomatic letters to win over the potentates of the east.\n\nMany details of the composition of the fleet are missing. Only three ship names are known, and there is some conflict among the sources on the captains.  The following list of ships should not be regarded as authoritative, but as a tentative list compiled from various conflicting accounts.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=5\n|style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Ship Name''' ||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Captain'''||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Notes'''\n|- valign = top\n| 1. uncertain || D.

I, Lib. V c.1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA384#v=onepage&q&f=false p.384]); Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is (1563, Pt. 1, ch.53, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0vTmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q&f=false p.67]); Diogo do Couto ''Decada decima'' (c.1600, ch. 16, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yqM2AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA117#v=onepage&q&f=false p.117]), Faria e Sousa (1666: v.1, ch.5, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WHo25-BfGO0C&pg=PA44#v=onepage&q&f=false p.44]) Both Barros and Gois mistakenly list Diogo Dias (Bartolomeu's brother) as \"P\u00earo Dias\", an error also found in the marginal gloss of the ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' (Maldonado, 1985: [https://books.google.com/books?id=7pTrH3zmhj8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA10#v=onepage&q&f=false p.10]) and subsequently repeated in Couto and Faria e Sousa. Oddly, Couto inserts [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in the place of Sim\u00e3o de Pina, but subsequently corrects himself.  All the chroniclers in this note (Castanheda, Barros, etc.) give Gaspar de Lemos instead of Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves. Chronicler [[Jer\u00f3nimo Os\u00f3rio]] (''De rebus Emmanuelis'', 1571) does not list captain names.</ref> The main conflict is with [[Gaspar Correia]]'s ''Lendas da \u00cdndia'', who omits P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde and Aires Gomes da Silva, listing instead Braz Matoso and Pedro de Figueir\u00f3, and introduces Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves in addition to Lemos. Correia also identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as vice-admiral and captain of Cabral's own flagship.<ref>Gaspar Correia ''Lendas da India'' (c.1550, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA148#v=onepage&q&f=false p.148]).  This list conforms very closely with the original ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'',  but not with its corrected marginal gloss (Maldonado, 1985: [https://books.google.com/books?id=7pTrH3zmhj8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA10#v=onepage&q&f=false p.10]).  The other great deviant is the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which introduces four new names: Diogo de Figueir\u00f3, Jo\u00e3o Fernandes, Ruy de Miranda, and Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves, who replace P. d'Ataide, A. Gomes da Silva, S. da Pina, and G. de Lemos.</ref>  Neither of the two eyewitnesses\u2014an anonymous Portuguese pilot and [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\u2014give a list of captains in their sources. \n\n[[File:Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral - steel engraving by American Bank Note Company.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral.]]\n\nThe Second Armada was to be headed by the Portuguese nobleman [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]], a master of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]]. Cabral had no notable naval or military experience; his appointment as ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' (captain-major) of the armada was largely a political one.  The exiled [[Crown of Castile|Castillian]] nobleman [[Sancho de Tovar]] was designated vice-admiral (''soto-capit\u00e3o'') and Cabral's successor should anything happen to him.<ref>According to Castanheda and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is.  However, Gaspar Correia identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as the predesignated successor.</ref>\n\nVeteran pilot [[Pedro Escobar]] was given the overall technical command of the expedition.  Other veterans of the [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first (1497) armada]] include captain [[Nicolau Coelho]], pilot [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]] and clerks Afonso Lopes and [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]].  Going as captains were the famed navigator [[Bartolomeu Dias]] (first to double the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]] back in 1488) and his brother [[Diogo Dias]] (who had served as clerk on Gama's ship in the first expedition).\n\nMost of the ships were either [[carracks]] (''naus'') or [[caravels]] and at least one was a small supply ship, although details on names and tonnage are missing.<ref>Castanheda (1551) claims there were ten carracks and three caravels. The Anonymous Pilot refers to only twelve ships, plus a supply ship.</ref>  At least two ships, Cabral's flagship and Tovar's ''El Rei'', were said to be around 240t, that is, about twice the size of the largest ship in the 1st (1497) Armada of [[Vasco da Gama]].\n\nTen ships were destined for [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (Malabar, India), while two ships (the Dias brothers, Bartolomeu and Diogo) were destined for [[Sofala]] (East Africa) and one (the supply ship captained by either [[Gaspar de Lemos]] or  [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]], uncertain exactly whom) was destined to be scuttled and burnt along the way.<ref>The Sofala destination of the Dias brothers is found in Castanheda (1551).  It is confirmed in the Anonymous Pilot.</ref>\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro das Armadas).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\nAt least two ships were privately owned and outfitted.  The ship of Lu\u00eds Pires was owned by Diogo da Silva e Meneses, [[Count of Portalegre]], while the  ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha was owned by the king's cousin D. [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], and financed by an Italian consortium composed of the Florentine bankers [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] and [[Girolamo Sernigi]] and the Genoese Antonio Salvago. The remainder belonged to the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese crown]].\n\nAccompanying the expedition as translator was [[Gaspar da Gama]] (baptismal name of the Jew captured in Angediva by Vasco da Gama) as well as four [[Hindu]] hostages from Zamorin's kingdom taken by da Gama in 1498 during negotiations. Also aboard is the ambassador of the Sultan of [[Malindi]], who had come with Gama, and was now set to return.\n\nOther passengers on the expedition included Aires Correia (archaically, Corr\u00eaa), designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut, his secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], Sofala factor Afonso Furtado and clerk Martinho Neto.  Accompanying the trip was the royal physician and amateur astronomer, Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], who brought along the latest [[astrolabe]] and new Arab astronomical staves for navigational experiment.  One chronicler suggests that the knight [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] was also aboard.<ref>[[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]] is the chronicler responsible for this claim.  This is not substantiated elsewhere.  Greenlee (1938: p.li) and Diffie and Winius (1977: p.188fn) dismiss the possibility.</ref>\n\nThe fleet carried some twenty Portuguese ''[[degredado]]s'' (criminal convicts), who could fulfill their sentences by being abandoned along the shores of various places and exploring inland on the crown's behalf.  Among the degredados we know four names: Afonso Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Machado, Luiz de Moura, Antonio Fernandes  (also a ship carpenter)\n\nFinally, the fleet carried the first Portuguese Christian missionaries to India\u2014eight [[Franciscan]] friars and eight chaplains, under the supervision of the head chaplain, Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra\n\nThere are three surviving eyewitness accounts of this expedition: (1) an extended letter written by [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] (possibly dictated by Aires Correia), written from Brazil on May 1, 1500, to King Manuel I; (2) the brief letter by Mestre [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]] to the king, also from Brazil; (3) the account of an anonymous Portuguese pilot, first published in Italian in 1507 (commonly referred to as the ''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Piloto An\u00f4nimo'', sometimes believed to be the clerk [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]]).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nCabral's instructions were several-fold. The priority was to secure a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal commercial entrep\u00f4t of the [[Kerala]] spice trade and dominant feudal city-state on the [[Malabar coast]] of [[India]]. Calicut had been visited by [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first armada in 1498, but failed to impress the elderly ruling [[Zamorin|Manivikraman Raja Zamorin]] ('Samoothiri Raja') of Calicut, and no agreements had been signed. Cabral's instructions were precisely to succeed where Gama had failed, and to this end was entrusted with magnificent gifts to present to the Zamorin. Cabral was under orders to establish a ''feitoria'' ([[Factory (trading post)|factory]]) in Calicut, to be placed under Aires Correia, the designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut.\n\nThe second priority, assigned to the brothers [[Bartolomeu Dias]] and [[Diogo Dias]], was to search out the [[East Africa]]n port of [[Sofala]], near the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] river.<ref>Anonymous Pilot, p.107</ref>  Sofala had been secretly visited and described by the explorer [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] during his overland expedition a decade earlier (c. 1487), and he identified it as the end-point of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade.  The Portuguese crown was eager to tap into that gold source, but Gama's armada had failed to find it.  The Dias brothers were instructed to find and establish a factory at Sofala under designated factor Afonso Furtado.  To this end, instructions were probably also given to secure the consent of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city-state of the East African coast and putative overlord of Sofala (see [[Kilwa Sultanate]]).  Like Sofala, Kilwa had been visited by Covilh\u00e3, but overlooked by Gama.\n\nA minor objective included the delivery of a group of [[Franciscan]] missionaries to India. It is said that Vasco da Gama had misinterpreted the [[Hinduism]] he saw practiced in India as a form of 'primitive' Christianity.  He believed its peculiar characteristics were a result of centuries of separation from the mainstream church in Europe. Gama recommended that missionaries be sent to India to help bring the practices of the 'Hindu church' up to date with Roman Catholic orthodoxy.  To this end, a group of [[Franciscan]] friars, led by Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra, joined the expedition.\n\nFinally, the Second Armada was also a commercial spice run. The crown and private merchants who had outfitted the ships expected full cargoes of spices to return to Lisbon.\n\n=== Suspected Brazilian mission ===\n\nThere has been some controversial debate over whether [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] also had secret instructions from King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] to lay claim to the landmass of [[Brazil]]\u2014or more precisely, to swing as far west as possible to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]], and claim whatever lands or islands might be discovered there for the Portuguese crown, before the Spanish did.<ref>e.g. Peres (1948). Among the pieces of 'evidence', is an indication of an island in the area in a 1448 map of [[Andrea Bianco]], apparently alluded to in the letter of Master Jo\u00e3o Faras; there is also the suggestion by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]], in his ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' (c. 1505, Cap. 2), that he had been sent on an expedition to a western landmass in 1498.  That's about the full extent of the evidence of 'intentionality'.  See Greenlee (1938: pp.l-lv) for a critical assessment.</ref>    This claim is largely speculative.  There is no evidence of any such instructions, and various reasons to presume them unlikely.\n\nSpanish explorers had certainly been tending south lately. [[Christopher Columbus]] had touched the coast of the [[South America]]n mainland (around [[Guyana]]) in 1498, on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third trip]]. In late 1499, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] had discovered much of the [[Venezuela]]n coast, with one of his squadrons, under [[Amerigo Vespucci]] exploring parts of what is now northern Brazil.  In early 1500, [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] and [[Diego de Lepe]], via generous southerly swings from the [[Canary islands]], had reached at least what is now modern [[Cear\u00e1]], perhaps as far east as [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape of Santo Agostinho]] (in [[Pernambuco]]), and explored much of the northern Brazilian coast west of it.  It is possible that the southerly Spanish tendencies were deliberate, aimed at securing more land for the Spanish crown.<ref>Although the person the Spanish crown was trying to claim land away from was not the king of Portugal (that was already mediated by Tordesillas anyway), but from  Christopher Columbus, their own vice-roy of the Indies!  Ojeda, Pinz\u00f3n and Lepe were all dispatched on separate royal capitulations by [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], an enemy of Columbus, with the deliberate intent of finding and claiming lands ''outside'' (i.e. to the south) of the Columbus-owned West Indian islands, thereby circumscribing Columbus's viceroyalty, limiting him to the islands he already had.  This would figure in later lawsuits by the Columbus family.</ref>\n\nHowever, these Spanish expeditions were much too recent for their results to have been known in Lisbon before Cabral's departure in March 1500 (indeed, they were unknown in Spain itself\u2014at that moment, Ojeda was still in [[Hispaniola]], and Pinz\u00f3n and Lepe were still out at sea).  It is very doubtful that the Portuguese were aware of them.  And, even if they were, it would not seem sensible to deviate Cabral's large and heavy Second Armada, on an important mission to India, to pursue some open-ended exploratory work in unknown waters, that could have been far more efficiently accomplished by a couple of little caravels.\n\n== Outward journey ==\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu).jpg|thumb|350px|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nMarch 9, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's expedition, the 2nd India Armada of 13 ships, sets out from the Tagus.\n\nMarch 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada reaches [[Cape Verde]] island of [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]] in the middle of a storm.  The privately outfitted ship of Lu\u00eds Pires is too damaged by the tempest to continue, and returns to Lisbon<ref>According to Barros (1552, II.5.2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q&f=false p.386]); also Castanheda (1551), G\u00f3is (1566).</ref> (Note: Caminha's letter (see below) makes no mention of Pires and instead reports that it was the crown ship of Vasco de Ataide was lost around Cape Verde.)\n\nFrom Cape Verde, Cabral strikes southwest.  The reasons for this unusual direction have been speculated upon endlessly. The most probable hypothesis is that Cabral was simply following the wide arc in the South Atlantic to catch a favorable wind to carry them to the Cape of Good Hope.\n\n[Navigationally, the arc is perfectly sensible: from Cape Verde, the ship cuts across the [[doldrums]] below the equator, catches the southwest-bound [[South Equatorial Current|equatorial drift]], turns into the southbound [[Brazil Current]] that will carry them down to the [[horse latitudes]] (30\u00b0S), where the prevailing [[westerlies]] begin.  The westerlies will then carry them quickly straight across the South Atlantic around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. In almost all of this trajectory, the sailing ship is going with the current and usually upwind.  If instead of his arc, a ship attempts to strike southeast from Cape Verde, it will go into the [[Gulf of Guinea]], and from there to the Cape of Good Hope is a struggle\u2014it means sailing against the southeasterly [[trade wind]]s, and fighting against the [[Benguela Current]] to go south\u2014a much slower and more painful route, especially for square-rigged heavy ships which cannot [[tacking (sailing)|tack]] easily.]\n\nHow did Cabral know about this arc?  The most probable answer is that this was precisely the route followed by [[Vasco da Gama]] on his first trip in 1497. The veterans of the first fleet\u2014notably the pilots [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]] and [[Pedro Escobar]]\u2014would very likely have charted the same route for Cabral again.<ref>That this arc was sailed by Gama in 1497 is uncertain, but most modern historians have come to accept that he did.  How did Gama know about the arc when no one had yet sailed it before?  Some have speculated that the Portuguese crown might have dispatched secret exploratory expeditions to those waters in advance.  But, in the more widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by admiral [[Gago Coutinho]], it is more straightforward: since [[Bartolomeu Dias]]'s 1488 expedition discovered the [[westerlies]], the South Atlantic arc became 'navigationally obvious' to any sensible pilot, especially pilots as experienced as Alenquer and Escobar. See Gago Coutinho (1951\u201352) ''A Nautica dos Descobrimentos: os descobrimentos maritimos visitos por um navegador'', 2 vols., Lisbon: Agencia Geral do Ultramar.</ref>  Indeed, in the Lisbon archives, there is a draft of a document based on Gama and intended for Cabral that gives the essential instruction: to strike in a southwesterly direction when he reaches the doldrums.<ref>After Cape Verde, where the wind is weak ('vento escasso') the ships should strike in the open ocean arc ('ir na volta do mar'), until the Cape of Good Hope, as this is the shorter route ('a navega\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 mais breve').  See Fonseca (1908: p.211; see also p.224) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false copy of letter]; see also Greenlee (1938: p.167)</ref>  The difference is that this time the arc was a little wider, Cabral went further west than Gama had, and as a result hit upon the hitherto unknown landmass of [[Brazil]].\n\nAlternative hypotheses forwarded for Cabral striking southwest have been (1.) that Cabral was trying to reach the [[Azores]] to repair his storm-battered fleet; (2.) that he was searching for and rounding up missing tempest-tossed ships; (3.) the hypothesis, already considered above, that it was an intentional attempt to discover if there was any land by the Tordesillas line.\n\n=== Discovery of Brazil ===\n{{Cleanup-tense|date=July 2012}}\nApril 21, 1500 \u2013 After nearly 30 days of sailing (44 since departure), on April 21 (a Tuesday in the [[octave of Easter]]),<ref>Fonseca (1908: p.225)</ref> Cabral's fleet finds the first indications of nearby land.\n\nApril 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada sights the Brazilian coast, seeing the outlines of a hill they name [[Monte Pascoal]] (some 60&nbsp;km south of modern [[Porto Seguro]], [[Bahia]]).\n\nApril 23, 1500 \u2013 The armada anchors at the mouth of the [[Do Frade River|Frade river]] and a group of local [[Tupiniquim]] Indians assembles on the beach. Cabral dispatches a small party, headed by [[Nicolau Coelho]], in a longboat ashore to make first contact.  Coelho tosses his hat in exchange for a feathered headdress, but the surf is too strong for a proper landing and opening of communication, and so they return to the ships.<ref>Fonseca (1908: p.241-42)</ref>\n\nApril 23\u201324, 1500 \u2013 Strong overnight winds on prompt the armada to lift anchor and sail some 10 leagues (45&nbsp;km) north, finding harbor behind the reef at Cabr\u00e1lia Bay, just north of [[Porto Seguro]].  The pilot Afonso Lopes goes [[Sounding line|sounding]] in a rowboat. He spies a native canoe, captures the two Indians on board, and brings them back to ship.  The language barrier prevents questioning, but they are fed and given cloth and beads. The cultural differences were staggering, fed with honey and cake, they spit them out and were deeply surprised with the sight of a chicken.<ref>Guia politicamente incorreto da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil, Leandro Narloch</ref>\n\nApril 25, 1500 \u2013 The next day a party led by [[Nicolau Coelho]] and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] goes ashore, accompanied by the two natives.  Armed Tupiniquim warily approach the beach, but on a signal from the two natives, lay down their bows, and allow the Portuguese to land and collect water.\n\n[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The First Mass in Brazil'' by [[Victor Meirelles]] (1861).]]\nApril 26, 1500 \u2013 (Octave of Easter Sunday) Franciscan friar Henrique Soares of Coimbra goes ashore to celebrate mass, curiously watched by some 200 Tupiniquim Indians.  It is the first known Christian mass on the American mainland.\n\nFor much of the week, interaction between the Portuguese and the Tupiniquim gradually increases.  There is a brisk trade in European iron nails, cloth, beads and crucifixes in return for American amulets, spears, parrots and monkeys. There is only the slightest hint that precious metals might be found in the hinterlands. Portuguese ''[[degredado]]s'' are assigned to spend the night in Tupiniquim villages, while the remainder of the crews sleep aboard ships.\n\n[[File:Carta-caminha.png|thumb|150px|Facsimile of the letter of [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] to  King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], reporting the discovery of the 'Island of the True Cross\" (Brazil)]]\nMay 1, 1500 \u2013 Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral makes preparations to resume the journey to India. The Portuguese pilots, assisted by the physician-astronomer Master Jo\u00e3o Faras and his astronomical instruments, determine that the land lies east of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]], prompting Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to formally claim Brazil for the Portuguese crown, bestowing upon it the name of ''Ilha de Vera Cruz'' (\"Island  of the True Cross\"\u2014later renamed ''Terra de Santa Cruz'', \"Land of the Holy Cross\", upon the realization that it is not an island).<ref>Gaspar Correia ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN05022145&as_brr=1&pg=PA152#v=onepage&q&f=false p.152]) and Jo\u00e3o de Barros ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA391#v=onepage&q&f=false p.391]) say it was named \"Santa Cruz\" from the start, with Correia noting it was named so because May 3 (the departure date) was the [[Feast of the Cross]] on the liturgical calendar.  But the letters of Caminha and Mestre Jo\u00e3o are both signed as written from \"Vera Cruz\" on May 1.</ref>\n\nOn May 2, 1500, Cabral dispatches the supply ship (captained either by [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]] or [[Gaspar de Lemos]]\u2014chronicles conflict on this<ref>Jo\u00e3o de Barros (1552: p.390) and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is (1566: p.69) say Gaspar de Lemos; Gaspar Correia (c.1550: p.152) says Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves.  The Anonymous Pilot says the supply ship captain was sent back\u2014but does not identify him by name.  The principal ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' is similarly obscure, although its marginal gloss identifies him as Lemos.</ref>) back to [[Lisbon]], with the Brazilian items and a letter to King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] composed by the secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] to announce the discovery.  It also carries a separate private letter to the king from Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], in which he identifies the main guiding constellation in the southern hemisphere, the [[Southern Cross]] (''Cruzeiro'').<ref>Some sources claim that the ''Cruzeiro'' constellation had already been identified by [[Alvise Cadamosto]] in the 1450s</ref>  The supply ship will arrive in Lisbon in June.\n\nMay 3, 1500 \u2013 Leaving behind a couple of Portuguese ''degredados'' with the Tupiniquim of Porto Seguro,<ref>Anonymous Pilot [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false p.110]</ref> Cabral orders the eleven remaining ships to set sail and continue on their route to India.\n\n=== Crossing to India ===\n\nLate May, 1500 \u2013 After crossing the Atlantic Ocean, Cabral's armada reaches the [[Cape of Good Hope]].  The fleet faces headlong winds for six straight days. Four ships are lost at sea in the process\u2014most tragically, the Sofala-destined ship of [[Bartolomeu Dias]].  The famous navigator, the first to round the Cape back in 1488, fatally fails to round it this time. The three others are the crown-owned ships of Aires Gomes da Silva, Sim\u00e3o de Pina and Vasco de Ata\u00edde <ref>Castanheda (1551), Barros (1552) and G\u00f3is (1566) all identify the same four (B. Dias, A. Gomes da Silva, S. da Pina, V. d' Ata\u00edde) as lost at the Cape.  The ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' mistakenly substitutes Sim\u00e3o de Miranda for Sim\u00e3o da Pina in the losses, although this is corrected in the marginal gloss. Gaspar Correia (1550) almost concurs\u2014but as he does not have Aires Gomes da Silva on his original captain list, he identifies the fourth ship lost as Gaspar de Lemos.   Analogously, the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which doesn't have Pina nor Gomes da Silva on its list, say it was Diogo de Figueir\u00f3 and Luis Pires who were lost (in addition to Vasco d'Ata\u00edde and Bartolomeu Dias).  Diogo do Couto (c.1600) mistakenly adds P\u00earo d'Ataide to the list, bringing the losses to five.</ref> (if Ata\u00edde had not been lost earlier at Cape Verde, he is certainly lost now; some scholars contend Pires was lost now, and Ata\u00edde was lost earlier).  In any case, the fleet is reduced to seven ships.  Facing strong winds, the seven split into smaller groups, to meet again on the other side.  Cabral holds two ships together with his own.\n\nJune 16, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's battered three-ship squadron reaches the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] (several leagues north of Sofala).  Two local merchant ships, catching sight of Cabral, take flight.  Cabral gives pursuit\u2014one of them runs aground and the other is captured.  Questioning quickly determines that these ships are owned by a cousin of the sultan Fateima of [[Malindi]] (who had received Vasco da Gama so graciously back in 1498), so they are released without harm.\n\nJune 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's three-ship squadron hobble on to [[Mozambique Island]].  Despite the earlier quarrel with Gama, Cabral is given an unexpectedly warm reception by the Sultan of Mozambique, and allowed to collect water and supplies.  Shortly after, three more ships of the 2nd Armada sail into Mozambique island and make junction with Cabral.  Only the ship of [[Diogo Dias]] (Bartolomeu's brother) remains missing.  As Dias's mission was for Sofala anyway, Cabral decides not to wait for it but rather to press on with his current fleet of six ships.\n\n[[File:Map of Cabral route, 1500.gif|thumb|340px|Approximate route of outward journey of Cabral's 2nd Armada (also route of stray ship of Diogo Dias)]]\nJuly 26, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada reaches the city-state of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city of the East African coast (which Gama had never visited).  Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala back in Lisbon and mercifully escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), goes ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim  [Note: There is no current ruling [[Kilwa Sultanate|Sultan of Kilwa]]\u2014the last one, al-Fudail, was deposed in a coup (c. 1495) by his minister, Emir Ibrahim, who had since ruled Kilwa with a vacant throne.]\n\nA meeting is arranged between Cabral and Emir Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in Kilwa harbor.  Cabral presents a letter from King Manuel I proposing a treaty, but Emir Ibrahim is suspicious and, for all the formal pleasantries, resistant to the overtures.  Cabral, feeling there's nothing to be achieved here and worried about missing the [[monsoon]] winds to India, decides to break off the negotiations and sail on.\n\nAugust 2, 1500, Pressing north, the Cabral fleet avoid hostile [[Mombassa]] (''Momba\u00e7a'') and finally reach friendly [[Malindi]] (''Melinde'').  There he drops off the Malindi ambassador that Gama had taken the previous year.  The Sultan of Malindi gives Cabral an excellent reception. Leaving behind  two ''degredados'' (Lu\u00eds de Moura and Jo\u00e3o Machado) and picking up two Gujarati pilots, Cabral's six-ship armada finally begins its Indian Ocean crossing on August 7.\n\n== Cabral in India ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\nAugust 22, 1500 \u2013 After an uneventful ocean crossing, Cabral's six ships land in [[Anjediva Island]] (''Angediva'', Anjadip), where they rest and recuperate, repair and repaint the ships.\n\nSeptember 13, 1500 \u2013 Sailing down the Indian coast, Cabral's expedition finally reaches at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode, the capital of the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] kingdom of same name ruled by Zamorins, or Nediyuiruppu Swarupam). Gaily decorated native boats come out to greet them, but remembering Gama's experience, Cabral refuses to go ashore until hostages are exchanged.  He dispatches Afonso Furtado and the four Calicut hostages taken by da Gama the previous year, to negotiate the details of the landing. This eventually done, Cabral finally goes ashore himself and meets new [[Zamorin]] of Calicut (the wary old Zamorin that da Gama had met, had recently died). The Portuguese are better-prepared this time\u2014Cabral presents the young Zamorin with much finer and more luxurious gifts than Gama had brought, and more respectful and personalized letters of address from King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].\n\nA commercial treaty is successfully negotiated, and the Zamorin gives Cabral a security-of-trade certificate etched on a silver plate. The Portuguese are allowed to establish a ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitoria]]'' in Calicut and Aires Correia, the designated factor for Calicut, goes ashore with some 70 men. Once the factory is set up, Cabral releases the ship hostages as a sign of trust. Correia immediately sets about buying spices in Calicut's markets for the ships to take home.\n\nOctober (?), 1500 \u2013 Not long after, the Zamorin of Calicut dispatches a service request to Cabral's idling fleet. Arab merchants allied with rival city-state of [[Cochin kingdom]] are returning from [[Ceylon]] with a cargo of [[war elephants]] destined for the Sultan of [[Cambay]] (Khambhat, Gujarat).  Claiming it to be illegal contraband (and the Zamorin could probably use the elephants himself), Cabral is asked if he can intercept them.  Cabral sends one of his caravels, brimming with cannon, under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]] (nicknamed 'Inferno'), to capture it.  Hoping for a spectacle, the Zamorin himself comes down to the beachfront to witness the engagement, but leaves in disgust when the Arab ship deftly slips past Ataide.  But Ata\u00edde gives chase and eventually catches up with it near [[Kannur|Cannanore]] and successfully seizes the vessel.  Cabral presents the captured ship, with its nearly intact elephant cargo (one pachyderm was killed in the engagement), to the Zamorin as a gift.\n\n=== Calicut Massacre ===\n\nDecember 1500 \u2013 After two months of operation, factor Aires Correia has only been able to buy enough spices to load two of the ships. He complains to Cabral his suspicions that the [[guild]] of Arab merchants in Calicut have been [[collusion|colluding]] to shut out Portuguese purchasing agents from the city's spice markets which is not unlikely. Arab traders had reportedly used similar collusive tactics to drive out Chinese merchants earlier in the 15th century from various ports on the [[Malabar Coast]]. It would make sense if they tried doing so again\u2014particularly as the Portuguese had arrived trumpeting their hatred of 'the Moors' and demanding trading privileges and preferences, a clear danger to their own trade.\n\nHistorians cite murkier elements to this, in particular, that the Portuguese traders might have been unwitting counters in on-going quarrels between competing older and newer Arab merchant guilds in Calicut and or used as pawns in the personal power struggles among the Zamorin's leading advisors, etc. There were certainly more dimensions to this affair, the full details of which will likely never be clearly known.\n\nCabral presents the complaint to the Zamorin, and requests that he crack down on the Arab merchant guild or enforce Portuguese priority in the spice markets.  But the Zamorin refuses to intervene in the matter\u2014or rather makes only some vague promises, but disdains to get actively involved in the matter, as Cabral demands.\n\nDecember 17, 1500 \u2013 Frustrated by the Zamorin's inaction, Cabral decides to take matters into his own hands.  On the advice of Aires Correia, Cabral orders the seizure of an Arab merchant ship from [[Jeddah]], then loading up with spices in Calicut harbor, claiming that as the Zamorin had promised the Portuguese priority in the spice markets, the cargo is rightfully theirs.  Incensed, the Arab merchants around the quay immediately raise a riot in Calicut and direct mobs to attack the Portuguese factory.  The Portuguese ships, anchored out in the harbor and unable to approach the docks, helplessly watch the unfolding massacre.  After three hours of fighting, some 53 (some say 70) Portuguese are slaughtered by the mobs\u2014including the factor Aires Correia, the secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], and three (some say five) of the Franciscan friars.  Around twenty Portuguese then in the city manage to escape the riot by jumping into the harbor waters and swimming to the ships.  The survivors report to Cabral that the Zamorin's own [[Hindu]] guards were seen either standing aside or actively helping the rioters.\n\nAt least one Portuguese, a man called Gon\u00e7alo Peixoto, survived the massacre, sheltered from the mob by a local merchant (whom the chronicles call \"Coja Bequij\").  In the aftermath, the wares in the Portuguese factory are impounded by the Calicut authorities.\n\n=== War with Calicut ===\n\nDecember 18\u201322, 1500 \u2013 Incensed at the attack on the factory, Cabral waits one day for redress by the Zamorin.  When this is not forthcoming, Cabral takes his revenge. The Portuguese seize around ten Arab merchant ships then in harbor, confiscating their cargoes, killing their crews, and burning their ships.  Then, accusing the Zamorin of sanctioning the riot, Cabral orders a full day [[shore bombardment]] of Calicut, doing immense damage to the unfortified city (estimates of Calicut casualties reach up to 600). Cabral proceeds to also bomb the nearby Zamorin-owned port of Pandarane (Pantalayani Kollam, near present-day [[Koyilandy]]) as well.<ref>The port of ''Pandarane'' has since vanished.  Its location is usually identified as 'Pantalyini Kollam', a port that has since been annexed by the growing city of [[Koyilandy]]; it is also sometimes identified with modern [[Kappad]]. (Dames, 1918: p.85)</ref>\n\nThus opened the war between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Zamorin of Calicut.  The war will drag on for the next decade.  Future [[Portuguese India Armadas]] have to contend with this conflict, it will dictate Portuguese strategy in the Indian Ocean and draw in other participants.  The conflict will also overturn the political order on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India, and shape a different future for [[Kerala]].\n\n=== Alliance with Cochin kingdom ===\n\n[[File:Kerala cities at time of Cabral (1500).gif|thumb|250px|India [[Malabar Coast]] c. 1500]]\nDecember 24, 1500 \u2013 Cabral leaves smoldering Calicut, unsure of what to do next. At the suggestion of [[Gaspar da Gama]] (the Goese Jew who had been accompanying the expedition), Cabral sets sail south along the coast towards [[Cochin kingdom]] (''Cochim'', Kochi or Perumpadappu Swarupam), a small [[Hindu]] [[Nair]] city-state at the outlet of the [[brackish]] [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad]] lagoon in the Kerala backwaters. Half-in-vassalage and half-at-war with Zamorin's Calicut, Cochin kingdom had long chafed at the dominance of its larger neighbor and was looking for an opportunity to break away.\n\nArriving in Cochin, a Portuguese emissary, accompanied by a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christian]] picked up in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], are set ashore to make contact with the Trimumpara Raja (Unni Goda Varma), the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] prince of [[Cochin kingdom]].<ref>The exact status of the 'Trimumpara Raja', the ruling prince of Cochin, is a bit unclear.  It seems the formal ruler of Cochin was the king of [[Edapalli]], across the lagoon on the mainland, that the Cochinese peninsula (with capital at [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]]) had at some point been detached as an appanage for a son, who, in turn, had detached the northern tip, Cochin proper, for another son.  Moreover, it seems these appanages were not supposed to be permanent fiefs, but rather to serve as temporary 'training' grounds for princely heirs before they moved up in succession order.  In other words, the ruler of Cochin was the second heir of Edapalli.  Upon the death of the ruler of Edapalli, the first heir was supposed to leave the peninsula and take up his duties in Edapalli, and the second heir move from Cochin to Perumpadappu, and assign Cochin to his own successor (the new second heir). It seems the Portuguese arrived at a time when the princely heirs were somewhat at odds with each other\u2014possibly because of some violation in the rules of succession, or simply because the ruler of Cochin was tired of waiting for his turn. It is only  under Portuguese protection that the rulers of Cochin finally became proper kings in their own right.  Thus, the Raja Trimumpara's search for a Portuguese alliance have more to do with his own family quarrels than with the exactions of the Zamorin of Calicut.  See Dames (1918: p.86n).</ref> The Portuguese are greeted warmly\u2014the bombardment of hated Zamorin's Calicut outweighing the earlier matter of the war elephants.  All the cordialities and hostage-swapping quickly fulfilled, Cabral himself goes ashore and negotiates a treaty of alliance between Portugal and Cochin kingdom, directed against Zamorin's Calicut. Cabral promises to make the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin the ruler of kingdom of Calicut, upon the city's capture.\n\nA Portuguese factory is set up in Cochin, with Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa as chief factor (the pre-designated Aires Correia having perished in the Calicut Massacre). A smaller, poorer city, the spice markets of Cochin are not nearly as well supplied as Calicut, but the trade is good enough to begin loading ships.  The stay in Cochin is not without incident\u2014the factory is set ablaze one evening (probably at the instigation of Arab traders in the city), but the Trimumpara Raja will not countenance a repeat of the events of Calicut.  He cracks down on the arsonists, takes the Portuguese under his protection (the factors stay in his palace), and assigns his personal [[Nair]] guards to escort the Portuguese factors in the city's markets and protect the factory against any further incidents.\n\nEarly January 1501 \u2013 While in Cochin, Cabral receives missives from the rulers of [[Kannur|Cannanore]] (''Canonor'', Kannur or Kolathunad, further north, another of Calicut's reluctant rivals) and [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam or Venad Swarupam, further south, once a great Syrian Christian merchant city-state, entrepot for cinnamon, ginger and dyewood).  They commend Cabral's actions against Zamorin's Calicut, and invite the Portuguese to trade in their cities instead. Not wishing to offend his gracious Cochinese host, Cabral politely declines the invitations, promising only to visit those cities at some future date.\n\nWhile still at Cochin, Cabral receives yet another invitation, this one from nearby [[Kodungallur Kovilakam|Cranganore kingdom]] (''Cranganor'', Kodungallur). Once a great city on the northern end of the Vembanad lagoon, capital of the [[Chera dynasty]] of [[Sangam period]], Cranganore had since fallen on hard times.  Mother nature delivered Cranganore two severe blows\u2014silting up the channels that connected Cranganore to the waterways, and breaking open a competing sea outlet by Cochin in the 14th century.<ref>Cochin was originally just a village along a long embankment.  Violent overflows of the [[Periyar River]] in 1341 forced the opening of the outlet between the Vembanad lagoon and the Arabian Sea at the juncture where Cochin now sits, separating the long Cochinese peninsula from what is now [[Vypin]] island. See Hunter's ''Imperial Gazetteer'' (1908: p.360).</ref> Cochin's rise had been principally due to the re-routing of commercial traffic away from Cranganore. Nonetheless, the remaining merchants of the dwindling city still maintained their old connections to the Kerala pepper plantations in the interior. Finding the supply in Cochin running low, Cabral takes up the offer to top up their cargo at Cranganore.\n\nThe visit to Cranganore turns out to be an eye-opener for the Portuguese, for among the city's remaining inhabitants are substantial established communities of [[Cochin Jews|Malabari Jews]] and [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christians]].  The encounter with a clearly recognizable Christian community in Kerala confirms to Cabral what the Franciscan friars had already suspected back in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]\u2014namely, that Vasco da Gama's earlier hypothesis about a 'Hindu Church' was mistaken. If real Christians have existed alongside Hindus in India for centuries, then clearly [[Hinduism]] must be a distinct and separate religion, 'heathen idolaters', as the Portuguese friars characterized them, rather than a 'primitive' form of Christianity.  Two Syrian Christian priests from Cranganore apply to Cabral for passage to Europe (one of them, known as Jos\u00e9 de Cranganore or Joseph the Indian (''Josephus Indus''), will provide instrumental intelligence about India to the Portuguese.<ref>Upon arrival in Lisbon, Joseph the Indian spent a couple of years being intensely interviewed by the Portuguese court and the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], relating to them his detailed knowledge of the history and geography of India and points east, expanding Portuguese intelligence dramatically.  It is likely that the detailed depiction of the east Indian coast and the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 is owed in large part to Joseph's information.  Around 1503, Joseph proceeded to Rome to meet [[Pope Alexander VI]] and report on the condition of the Malabari [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christian]] church.  It was on this trip that Joseph dictated his famous narrative on India to an Italian scribe, which was eventually published in 1507 (in Italian) as part of a collection, ''Paesi Novamente Retrovati'', edited by Fracanzio da Montalboddo.  The narrative includes Joseph's own account of Cabral's expedition.  See Vallavanthara (2001).</ref>\n\nJanuary 16, 1501 \u2013 News arrives that the Zamorin of Calicut had assembled and dispatched a fleet of around 80 boats against the Portuguese in Cochin.  Despite the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin's offer of military assistance against the Calicut fleet, Cabral decides to precipitously lift anchor and slip away rather than risk a confrontation.  Cabral's armada leave behind the factor Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa and six assistants in Cochin.  In their hasty departure, the Portuguese inadvertently take along two of the Trimumpara's officers (Idikkela Menon and Parangoda Mennon), who had been serving as noble hostages aboard the vessels.\n\nHeading north, Cabral's armada takes a wide sweep to avoid Calicut, and pays a quick visit to [[Kannur|Cannanore]].  Cabral is warmly received by the [[Kolathiri]] Raja of Cannanore who, eager for a Portuguese alliance, offers to sell the Portuguese spices on credit. Cabral accepts the cargo but pays him nonetheless (not a splendid cargo\u2014only low-quality ginger, as it turns out, but Cabral is appreciative of the gesture.)\n\nHis ships now filled with spices, Cabral decides not to visit [[Quilon]], as he had earlier promised, but to make way back home to Portugal.\n\n== Diogo Dias' misadventures ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nWhile Cabral's main fleet was in India, [[Diogo Dias]], captain of the missing seventh ship of the armada, was going through his own set of adventures.\n\n[[File:Detail of Diogo Dias's ship (Cabral Armada).jpg|thumb|180px|Ship of [[Diogo Dias]], detail from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\nShortly after being separated from the main fleet at the Cape in June 1500, Dias had struck out too far east into the Indian Ocean and sighted the western coast of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Although the island was not unknown (its Arab name, \"island of the Moon\", was already reported by [[Pero de Covilha|Covilh\u00e3]]), Diogo Dias was the first Portuguese captain to have sighted it and is often credited with renaming it the island of ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'', on account of it being found on [[St. Lawrence]]'s day (August 10, 1500).  However, a proper landing on Madagascar would not be undertaken until 1506 and it would only be extensively explored in 1508.\n\nProbably thinking he was on a South African island, Diogo Dias tried to find the African coast by sailing straight north from Madagascar, hoping to reconnect with Cabral's armada there, or at least to make it to [[Sofala]] (Dias's formal destination).  But to no avail.  He had struck too far east, and was heading along north in open ocean.  Dias sighted the African coast only around [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''). By this time, Cabral had already crossed the Indian Ocean, and the change in the monsoon winds prevented Dias from undertaking his own crossing. Dias pushed up the coast, unexpectedly going past [[Cape Guardafui]] into the [[Gulf of Aden]], waters as yet unsailed by Portuguese ships.  Dias spent the next few months in the area\u2014trapped by contrary winds, battered by tempests, attacked by Arab pirates, and forced aground on the [[Eritrea]]n coast, in a desperate search for water and food.\n\nDias eventually (in late 1500 and early 1501) managed to procure supplies, repair his ship and catch a favorable wind to take him out of that harrowing trap.  With his remaining six crewmen, Dias set sail back to Portugal, hoping to catch Cabral's armada on the return journey.\n\n== Return journey ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nLate January, 1501 \u2013 Cabral takes aboard an ambassador from Cannanore, and starts his ocean crossing back to East Africa.  On the way, the Portuguese capture a  Gujarati ship, replete with a magnificent cargo.  They steal the cargo, but spare the crew, once they realize they are not Arabs.\n\nFebruary, 1501 \u2013 As Cabral's expedition approaches [[Malindi]], vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]], sailing at the front, runs his spice-laden ship, the ''El Rei'', aground on the Malindi coast.  Irreparable, the great ship is burnt (to recover the iron fittings) and the crews and the cargo reallocated.  Cabral's armada is now reduced to five ships. Cabral authorizes the king of Malindi to recover the cannons from the ''El Rei'' wreck and keep them for himself.\n\nSpring, 1501 \u2013 Cabral's fleet reaches [[Mozambique Island]].  As there is no sign or news from [[Diogo Dias]] awaiting him, Cabral realizes he must take responsibility for the Sofala mission himself.  Cabral orders the private ship ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha, the fastest in the fleet, to be placed under the command of veteran hand [[Nicolau Coelho]], and dispatched ahead of the rest of the fleet and deliver the results of the voyage to Portugal.  Vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]] (who had lost the ''El-Rei'') is given the chance to make amends by taking command of the caravel ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (hitherto commanded by [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]) and seek out Sofala and to proceed home alone from there.  Ata\u00edde is transferred to the command of Coelho's old nau.\n\nIn the meantime, Cabral lands a ''[[degredado]]'' Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes on the African coast, with letters of instruction for Diogo Dias and any passing Portuguese expeditions, informing them of the dramatic turn of events in India, and warning them to avoid Calicut.\n\n[It is uncertain exactly where Cabral left Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes or where he was ordered to go.  According to Ata\u00edde, Fernandes was ordered to go to Mombassa (odd, as Mombassa was then on hostile terms with the Portuguese); others suggest he was supposed to go to Kilwa (which is where the 3rd Armada of [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]] will find him). Others have speculated that Fernandes was left in Kilwa on the outward leg, and that Cabral's letters were dispatched to him by a local messenger from Mozambique on the return.  Another possibility is that Fernandes was instructed to make his way to Sofala overland, meet Tovar's ship there, and then proceed to explore inland from there to locate [[Monomatapa]] (but then why give him the letters?).  Finally, some conjecture Fernandes is being confused with another degredado, Jo\u00e3o Machado, who had been left in Malindi on the first leg, that he was picked up on the return, and now sent back once again with the letters.]\n\nMarch\u2013April, 1501 \u2013 Matters settled, Cabral takes the remaining three ships\u2014his own flagship, the large nau of Sim\u00e3o de Miranda and Coelho's ship (now under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]])\u2014and sets sail out of Mozambique island.\n\nAta\u00edde gets separated from the other two in the [[Mozambique Channel]] soon after departure. He hurries to S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s ([[Mossel Bay]], South Africa), hoping to find Cabral there waiting for him.  But he is out of luck\u2014Cabral and Miranda had decided to proceed on together towards Lisbon without him.  Not finding any trace of the others, Ata\u00edde decides to make his way home on his own, leaving behind a letter in a boot by a local watering hole giving an account of the expedition (Ataide's note will be found later that year by [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd Armada]]).\n\nIn the meantime, Sancho de Tovar, aboard the ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', finally sights [[Sofala]], the entrepot of Monomatapa gold.  He doesn't go ashore, and instead contents himself with scouting the city from his ship, and then sets sail back home alone.\n\n=== Conference at Bezeguiche ===\n\nJune 2, 1501 \u2013 Following up on the discovery of Brazil the previous year, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] had assembled a small exploratory expedition of three caravels under an unnamed Portuguese captain, and carrying the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] aboard, to explore and map the coast of Brazil.  The exact identity of the captain is uncertain - some speculate it to be [[Gaspar de Lemos]] or [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]], whichever of the two had commanded the supply vessel that had delivered the news in June 1500; others conjecture Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves went merely as passengers, and that the expedition itself was commanded by [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]].<ref>[[Amerigo Vespucci]] wrote two detailed accounts of this Brazilian mapping expedition - in ''Mundus Novus'' (pub. 1502/03) and as the \"third voyage\" in ''Lettera a Soderini'' (pub.1504/05) - but does not identify the Portuguese captain by name in either.  Chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]], writing a half-century later, identifies the mapping captain as the same captain who steered the returning supply ship - ergo the Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves identification.  Greenlee (1945) suggests the captain was [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]], although this has been dismissed by others (e.g. Roukema, 1963).  More recently, historians have drawn attention to a nautical chart by [[Vesconte de Maggiolo]], which identifies the Brazilian landmass with the label ''Tera de Gonsalvo Coigo Vocatur Santa Cruz'' (translated as \"Land of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] called Santa Cruz\").  [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] is known to have led a later expedition to Brazil (which set out in 1503), but it is commonly estimated that Coelho was still out at sea when Maggiolo composed his chart (c. 1504-05), thereby suggesting Coelho might have also captained the previous 1501 mapping expedition as well. (Morison, 1974, vol. 2, p.281)</ref> Setting out from Lisbon in May 1501, the little Brazilian mapping expedition made a watering stop in early June at ''Bezeguiche'' (as the bay of [[Dakar]] (Senegal) was known to the Portuguese sailors of the time) and stumbles upon  [[Diogo Dias]] cooling his heels there. Dias relates to the Portuguese captain and Vespucci the tales of his misadventures\u2014how he had been separated from Cabral at the Cape, how he had ventured up to the Gulf of Aden, and, finding no trace of Cabral on his return, decided to wait for him in Bezeguiche. Just two days later, the lead ship of the returning India fleet\u2014the ''Anunciada'' under [[Nicolau Coelho]]\u2014sails into Bezeguiche, surprised to find both Dias and the Brazilian mapping expedition there (apparently  Bezeguiche must have been a pre-arranged point of encounter for the Second Armada).\n\nFor the next two weeks, the captains and crews of the different ships exchange tales of their travels and adventures.  It has been since speculated that it was during this time that Amerigo Vespucci came up with his \"[[New World]]\" hypothesis.  After all, Vespucci was quite familiar with the Americas, having participated in [[Alonso de Ojeda|Ojeda]]'s 1499 expedition to the coasts of South America, and it is said he had intense discussions at Bezeguiche with [[Gaspar da Gama]], the Goese Jew aboard Coelho's ship, undoubtedly the person most familiar with the East Indies. Comparing notes, it probably dawned on Vespucci that it was simply impossible to square what he knew of the Americas with what the men of the 2nd Armada knew of Asia.  While still at Bezeguiche, Vespucci wrote a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], relating his encounter, which he sends back with some Florentine passengers on the ''Anunciada''.<ref>Vespucci's 1501 letter is reproduced in Varnhagen (1865).   An English translation can be found in W.H.Greenlee (1938: p.152ff).</ref>  This was a prelude to an even more famous letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo in 1503, shortly after his return, where he finally asserts that the Brazilian landmass was in fact a continent, that the lands discovered to the west were definitely not part of Asia, but must be an entirely different continent, a \"[[New World]]\".<ref>Vespucci (1503). After leaving Bezeguiche, the mapping expedition would make landfall at [[Cape S\u00e3o Roque]] in August 1501, and proceeded to sail south along the Brazilian coast, possibly as far as the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] coast. They returned to Lisbon before September 1502, perhaps as early as June. A second mapping expedition, this time more certainly under [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], also accompanied by Vespucci (his \"fourth voyage\"), set out for Brazil in April, 1503.</ref>\n\nMid-June, 1501 \u2013 Lemos & Vespucci leave Bezeguiche for Brazil. Shortly after, the pair [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda themselves reach Bezeguiche, where they find Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho awaiting them. Cabral sends Coelho's swift ''Anunciada'' ahead to Lisbon to announce their return, while the remainder rest and wait in Bezeguiche for the remaining two ships.  [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]'s ship (making his way alone from Mossel Bay) and [[Sancho de Tovar]]'s ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (returning from Sofala) arrive in Bezeguiche by the end of June.\n\nJune 23, 1501 \u2013 The ''Anunciada'', commanded by [[Nicolau Coelho]], arrives in Lisbon and anchors in [[Bel\u00e9m]].  (Just as in case of Vasco da Gama's expedition, it turns out Nicolau Coelho is once again the first to deliver the news!)  The merchants of the consortium led by [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] (who own the ''Anunciada'') are delighted.  Letters are immediately fired off throughout Europe announcing the results.\n\nThe news arrives too late for [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd India Armada]], which departed for India in April.  But Nova will collect the necessary information along the way\u2014from the note in Ata\u00edde's shoe in Mossel Bay, and from Cabral's letters in the possession of Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes in Kilwa.\n\nJuly 21, 1501 \u2013 One month after Coelho's arrival, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda, the two larger ships, finally arrive in Lisbon. The other three ships arrive a few days later: Sancho de Tovar and P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde on July 25 and the hapless Diogo Dias, with his empty caravel, on July 27.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bernardelli - Monumento a Cabral.jpg|thumb|180px|Monument to [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Lisbon, copy of a Brazilian monument by Rodolpho Bernardelli]]\nOn the surface, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's 2nd Armada had been a failure and the reaction was conspicuously muted.\n\nShip losses were very heavy. Of the thirteen ships sent out, only five returned with cargo (four crown, one private), five were lost at sea, three returned without cargo (Gaspar de Lemos, Lu\u00eds Pires and Diogo Dias).\n\nHuman losses were even more disheartening.  This included all the crews and captains of the four ships lost at the Cape (notably, the celebrated discoverer Bartolomeu Dias).  Another fifty-something Portuguese (including the factor Aires Correia) had been killed in the Calicut massacre.\n\nThen there were the mission failures.  Relative to the instructions given to him in Lisbon, Cabral had failed on nearly every count:\n*1. failed to establish a treaty with the Zamorin of Calicut\u2014indeed, Calicut was now more hostile than ever.\n*2. failed to establish a factory at Calicut (massacred);\n*3. failed to bring the 'Hindu Church' in line (the friars that survived reported the Hindus weren't Christians after all, just 'idolaters');\n*4. failed to make a treaty with Kilwa;\n*5. failed to establish a factory at Sofala (seen from afar by Tovar, but that is all).\n\nOn the other hand, in his defense, Cabral could point to some positive achievements.\n\n*1. opening of friendly relations with Cochin, Canannore and Quilon;\n*2. a factory in Cochin, poorer than Calicut perhaps, but workable;\n*3. discovery of true Christian communities in Cranganore, etc.;\n*4. Sofala was at least discovered and scouted;\n*5. discovery of Brazil, which might serve as a useful staging post for future India runs;\n*6. Diogo Dias's discovery of Madagascar and exploration of the African coast up to Cape Guardafui and the Gulf of Aden was useful information.\n*7. Finally, Cabral did bring back tons of spices, which were off-loaded into the Lisbon warehouses and sold at no small profit for the crown treasury.\n\nHowever, it was the ship and human losses that weighed heavily against Cabral being honored or rewarded. Allegations of 'incompetence' flew easily in the circles that mattered. Although Cabral was initially offered the command of the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]], scheduled for 1502, it seemed more like a ''pro forma'' gesture than a sincere offer.<ref>Subrahmanyam (1997: p.191)</ref> The crown made it clear that Cabral's command would be limited and supervised \u2013 conditions humiliating enough to force Cabral to withdraw his name.  The 4th Armada would be placed under the command of [[Vasco da Gama]].\n\nAlthough the reaction of Portuguese court opinion in 1501, on Cabral's return, was generally low, it ascended retrospectively.  Cabral's discovery of Brazil, initially received as a minor discovery of little interest, turned out to be much more momentous.  The follow-up Brazilian mapping expeditions of 1501-02 and 1503-04, under the captaincy of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], carrying the Florentine cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], revealed a massive continent - which Vespucci famously labelled a \"[[New World]]\" (''Mundus Novus'').  The plentitude of [[brazilwood]] (''pau-brasil'') discovered by the mapping expeditions on its shores lured the interest of European cloth industry, and led to the 1505 contract granted to [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]] for the commercial exploitation of Brazil. The lucrative brazilwood trade eventually drew competition from French and Spanish interlopers, forcing the Portuguese government to take a more active interest in Cabral's \"[[Name of Brazil|Land of Vera Cruz]]\", finally leading to the establishment of the first Portuguese colonies in [[Colonial Brazil]] in 1532.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\n* [[Portuguese India Armadas]]\n* [[Portuguese India]]\n* [[Alternative theory of the European discovery of Brazil]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n'''Eyewitness Accounts'''\n\n* [Anonymous Pilot] \"Navigationi del Capitano Pedro Alvares Cabral Scrita per un Piloto Portoghese et Tradotta di Lingua Portoghese in Italiana\", first published in Francanzano Montalbado, 1507, editor, ''Paesi novamente retrovati et Novo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato'', Vicenza.

Cabral's armada famously discovered [[Brazil]] for the Portuguese crown along the way. By and large, the 2nd Armada's diplomatic mission to [[India]] failed, and provoked the opening of hostilities between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the feudal city-state of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], ruled by [[Zamorin]]s.  Nonetheless, it managed to establish a factory in the nearby [[Kingdom of Cochin]], the first Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Asia.\n\n== Fleet ==\n\nThe [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first India Armada]], commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]], arrived in Portugal in the summer of 1499, in rather sorry shape. Half of his ships and men had been lost thanks to battles, disease, and storms. Although da Gama came back with a hefty cargo of spices that would be sold at enormous profit, he had failed in the principal objective of his mission: to negotiate a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], the spice entrep\u00f4t on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India. Da Gama managed, however, to open the [[Portuguese India Armadas|sea route to India]] via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and secured good relations with the African city-state of [[Malindi]], a critical staging post along the way.\n\nOn the orders of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], arrangements were immediately made to begin the assembly of a second armada in [[Cascais]].  Determined not to repeat da Gama's mistakes, this one was to be a large and well-armed fleet of 13 ships and 1500 men, laden with valuable gifts and diplomatic letters to win over the potentates of the east.\n\nMany details of the composition of the fleet are missing. Only three ship names are known, and there is some conflict among the sources on the captains.  The following list of ships should not be regarded as authoritative, but as a tentative list compiled from various conflicting accounts.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=5\n|style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Ship Name''' ||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Captain'''||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Notes'''\n|- valign = top\n| 1. uncertain || D.

Oddly, Couto inserts [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in the place of Sim\u00e3o de Pina, but subsequently corrects himself.  All the chroniclers in this note (Castanheda, Barros, etc.) give Gaspar de Lemos instead of Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves. Chronicler [[Jer\u00f3nimo Os\u00f3rio]] (''De rebus Emmanuelis'', 1571) does not list captain names.</ref> The main conflict is with [[Gaspar Correia]]'s ''Lendas da \u00cdndia'', who omits P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde and Aires Gomes da Silva, listing instead Braz Matoso and Pedro de Figueir\u00f3, and introduces Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves in addition to Lemos. Correia also identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as vice-admiral and captain of Cabral's own flagship.<ref>Gaspar Correia ''Lendas da India'' (c.1550, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA148#v=onepage&q&f=false p.148]).  This list conforms very closely with the original ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'',  but not with its corrected marginal gloss (Maldonado, 1985: [https://books.google.com/books?id=7pTrH3zmhj8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA10#v=onepage&q&f=false p.10]).  The other great deviant is the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which introduces four new names: Diogo de Figueir\u00f3, Jo\u00e3o Fernandes, Ruy de Miranda, and Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves, who replace P. d'Ataide, A. Gomes da Silva, S. da Pina, and G. de Lemos.</ref>  Neither of the two eyewitnesses\u2014an anonymous Portuguese pilot and [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\u2014give a list of captains in their sources. \n\n[[File:Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral - steel engraving by American Bank Note Company.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral.]]\n\nThe Second Armada was to be headed by the Portuguese nobleman [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]], a master of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]]. Cabral had no notable naval or military experience; his appointment as ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' (captain-major) of the armada was largely a political one.  The exiled [[Crown of Castile|Castillian]] nobleman [[Sancho de Tovar]] was designated vice-admiral (''soto-capit\u00e3o'') and Cabral's successor should anything happen to him.<ref>According to Castanheda and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is.  However, Gaspar Correia identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as the predesignated successor.</ref>\n\nVeteran pilot [[Pedro Escobar]] was given the overall technical command of the expedition.  Other veterans of the [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first (1497) armada]] include captain [[Nicolau Coelho]], pilot [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]] and clerks Afonso Lopes and [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]].  Going as captains were the famed navigator [[Bartolomeu Dias]] (first to double the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]] back in 1488) and his brother [[Diogo Dias]] (who had served as clerk on Gama's ship in the first expedition).\n\nMost of the ships were either [[carracks]] (''naus'') or [[caravels]] and at least one was a small supply ship, although details on names and tonnage are missing.<ref>Castanheda (1551) claims there were ten carracks and three caravels. The Anonymous Pilot refers to only twelve ships, plus a supply ship.</ref>  At least two ships, Cabral's flagship and Tovar's ''El Rei'', were said to be around 240t, that is, about twice the size of the largest ship in the 1st (1497) Armada of [[Vasco da Gama]].\n\nTen ships were destined for [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (Malabar, India), while two ships (the Dias brothers, Bartolomeu and Diogo) were destined for [[Sofala]] (East Africa) and one (the supply ship captained by either [[Gaspar de Lemos]] or  [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]], uncertain exactly whom) was destined to be scuttled and burnt along the way.<ref>The Sofala destination of the Dias brothers is found in Castanheda (1551).  It is confirmed in the Anonymous Pilot.</ref>\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro das Armadas).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\nAt least two ships were privately owned and outfitted.  The ship of Lu\u00eds Pires was owned by Diogo da Silva e Meneses, [[Count of Portalegre]], while the  ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha was owned by the king's cousin D. [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], and financed by an Italian consortium composed of the Florentine bankers [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] and [[Girolamo Sernigi]] and the Genoese Antonio Salvago. The remainder belonged to the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese crown]].\n\nAccompanying the expedition as translator was [[Gaspar da Gama]] (baptismal name of the Jew captured in Angediva by Vasco da Gama) as well as four [[Hindu]] hostages from Zamorin's kingdom taken by da Gama in 1498 during negotiations. Also aboard is the ambassador of the Sultan of [[Malindi]], who had come with Gama, and was now set to return.\n\nOther passengers on the expedition included Aires Correia (archaically, Corr\u00eaa), designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut, his secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], Sofala factor Afonso Furtado and clerk Martinho Neto.  Accompanying the trip was the royal physician and amateur astronomer, Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], who brought along the latest [[astrolabe]] and new Arab astronomical staves for navigational experiment.  One chronicler suggests that the knight [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] was also aboard.<ref>[[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]] is the chronicler responsible for this claim.  This is not substantiated elsewhere.  Greenlee (1938: p.li) and Diffie and Winius (1977: p.188fn) dismiss the possibility.</ref>\n\nThe fleet carried some twenty Portuguese ''[[degredado]]s'' (criminal convicts), who could fulfill their sentences by being abandoned along the shores of various places and exploring inland on the crown's behalf.  Among the degredados we know four names: Afonso Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Machado, Luiz de Moura, Antonio Fernandes  (also a ship carpenter)\n\nFinally, the fleet carried the first Portuguese Christian missionaries to India\u2014eight [[Franciscan]] friars and eight chaplains, under the supervision of the head chaplain, Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra\n\nThere are three surviving eyewitness accounts of this expedition: (1) an extended letter written by [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] (possibly dictated by Aires Correia), written from Brazil on May 1, 1500, to King Manuel I; (2) the brief letter by Mestre [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]] to the king, also from Brazil; (3) the account of an anonymous Portuguese pilot, first published in Italian in 1507 (commonly referred to as the ''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Piloto An\u00f4nimo'', sometimes believed to be the clerk [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]]).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nCabral's instructions were several-fold. The priority was to secure a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal commercial entrep\u00f4t of the [[Kerala]] spice trade and dominant feudal city-state on the [[Malabar coast]] of [[India]]. Calicut had been visited by [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first armada in 1498, but failed to impress the elderly ruling [[Zamorin|Manivikraman Raja Zamorin]] ('Samoothiri Raja') of Calicut, and no agreements had been signed. Cabral's instructions were precisely to succeed where Gama had failed, and to this end was entrusted with magnificent gifts to present to the Zamorin. Cabral was under orders to establish a ''feitoria'' ([[Factory (trading post)|factory]]) in Calicut, to be placed under Aires Correia, the designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut.\n\nThe second priority, assigned to the brothers [[Bartolomeu Dias]] and [[Diogo Dias]], was to search out the [[East Africa]]n port of [[Sofala]], near the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] river.<ref>Anonymous Pilot, p.107</ref>  Sofala had been secretly visited and described by the explorer [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] during his overland expedition a decade earlier (c. 1487), and he identified it as the end-point of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade.  The Portuguese crown was eager to tap into that gold source, but Gama's armada had failed to find it.  The Dias brothers were instructed to find and establish a factory at Sofala under designated factor Afonso Furtado.  To this end, instructions were probably also given to secure the consent of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city-state of the East African coast and putative overlord of Sofala (see [[Kilwa Sultanate]]).  Like Sofala, Kilwa had been visited by Covilh\u00e3, but overlooked by Gama.\n\nA minor objective included the delivery of a group of [[Franciscan]] missionaries to India. It is said that Vasco da Gama had misinterpreted the [[Hinduism]] he saw practiced in India as a form of 'primitive' Christianity.  He believed its peculiar characteristics were a result of centuries of separation from the mainstream church in Europe. Gama recommended that missionaries be sent to India to help bring the practices of the 'Hindu church' up to date with Roman Catholic orthodoxy.  To this end, a group of [[Franciscan]] friars, led by Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra, joined the expedition.\n\nFinally, the Second Armada was also a commercial spice run. The crown and private merchants who had outfitted the ships expected full cargoes of spices to return to Lisbon.\n\n=== Suspected Brazilian mission ===\n\nThere has been some controversial debate over whether [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] also had secret instructions from King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] to lay claim to the landmass of [[Brazil]]\u2014or more precisely, to swing as far west as possible to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]], and claim whatever lands or islands might be discovered there for the Portuguese crown, before the Spanish did.<ref>e.g. Peres (1948). Among the pieces of 'evidence', is an indication of an island in the area in a 1448 map of [[Andrea Bianco]], apparently alluded to in the letter of Master Jo\u00e3o Faras; there is also the suggestion by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]], in his ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' (c. 1505, Cap. 2), that he had been sent on an expedition to a western landmass in 1498.  That's about the full extent of the evidence of 'intentionality'.  See Greenlee (1938: pp.l-lv) for a critical assessment.</ref>    This claim is largely speculative.  There is no evidence of any such instructions, and various reasons to presume them unlikely.\n\nSpanish explorers had certainly been tending south lately. [[Christopher Columbus]] had touched the coast of the [[South America]]n mainland (around [[Guyana]]) in 1498, on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third trip]]. In late 1499, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] had discovered much of the [[Venezuela]]n coast, with one of his squadrons, under [[Amerigo Vespucci]] exploring parts of what is now northern Brazil.  In early 1500, [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] and [[Diego de Lepe]], via generous southerly swings from the [[Canary islands]], had reached at least what is now modern [[Cear\u00e1]], perhaps as far east as [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape of Santo Agostinho]] (in [[Pernambuco]]), and explored much of the northern Brazilian coast west of it.  It is possible that the southerly Spanish tendencies were deliberate, aimed at securing more land for the Spanish crown.<ref>Although the person the Spanish crown was trying to claim land away from was not the king of Portugal (that was already mediated by Tordesillas anyway), but from  Christopher Columbus, their own vice-roy of the Indies!  Ojeda, Pinz\u00f3n and Lepe were all dispatched on separate royal capitulations by [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], an enemy of Columbus, with the deliberate intent of finding and claiming lands ''outside'' (i.e. to the south) of the Columbus-owned West Indian islands, thereby circumscribing Columbus's viceroyalty, limiting him to the islands he already had.  This would figure in later lawsuits by the Columbus family.</ref>\n\nHowever, these Spanish expeditions were much too recent for their results to have been known in Lisbon before Cabral's departure in March 1500 (indeed, they were unknown in Spain itself\u2014at that moment, Ojeda was still in [[Hispaniola]], and Pinz\u00f3n and Lepe were still out at sea).  It is very doubtful that the Portuguese were aware of them.  And, even if they were, it would not seem sensible to deviate Cabral's large and heavy Second Armada, on an important mission to India, to pursue some open-ended exploratory work in unknown waters, that could have been far more efficiently accomplished by a couple of little caravels.\n\n== Outward journey ==\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu).jpg|thumb|350px|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nMarch 9, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's expedition, the 2nd India Armada of 13 ships, sets out from the Tagus.\n\nMarch 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada reaches [[Cape Verde]] island of [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]] in the middle of a storm.  The privately outfitted ship of Lu\u00eds Pires is too damaged by the tempest to continue, and returns to Lisbon<ref>According to Barros (1552, II.5.2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q&f=false p.386]); also Castanheda (1551), G\u00f3is (1566).</ref> (Note: Caminha's letter (see below) makes no mention of Pires and instead reports that it was the crown ship of Vasco de Ataide was lost around Cape Verde.)\n\nFrom Cape Verde, Cabral strikes southwest.  The reasons for this unusual direction have been speculated upon endlessly. The most probable hypothesis is that Cabral was simply following the wide arc in the South Atlantic to catch a favorable wind to carry them to the Cape of Good Hope.\n\n[Navigationally, the arc is perfectly sensible: from Cape Verde, the ship cuts across the [[doldrums]] below the equator, catches the southwest-bound [[South Equatorial Current|equatorial drift]], turns into the southbound [[Brazil Current]] that will carry them down to the [[horse latitudes]] (30\u00b0S), where the prevailing [[westerlies]] begin.  The westerlies will then carry them quickly straight across the South Atlantic around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. In almost all of this trajectory, the sailing ship is going with the current and usually upwind.  If instead of his arc, a ship attempts to strike southeast from Cape Verde, it will go into the [[Gulf of Guinea]], and from there to the Cape of Good Hope is a struggle\u2014it means sailing against the southeasterly [[trade wind]]s, and fighting against the [[Benguela Current]] to go south\u2014a much slower and more painful route, especially for square-rigged heavy ships which cannot [[tacking (sailing)|tack]] easily.]\n\nHow did Cabral know about this arc?  The most probable answer is that this was precisely the route followed by [[Vasco da Gama]] on his first trip in 1497. The veterans of the first fleet\u2014notably the pilots [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]] and [[Pedro Escobar]]\u2014would very likely have charted the same route for Cabral again.<ref>That this arc was sailed by Gama in 1497 is uncertain, but most modern historians have come to accept that he did.  How did Gama know about the arc when no one had yet sailed it before?  Some have speculated that the Portuguese crown might have dispatched secret exploratory expeditions to those waters in advance.  But, in the more widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by admiral [[Gago Coutinho]], it is more straightforward: since [[Bartolomeu Dias]]'s 1488 expedition discovered the [[westerlies]], the South Atlantic arc became 'navigationally obvious' to any sensible pilot, especially pilots as experienced as Alenquer and Escobar. See Gago Coutinho (1951\u201352) ''A Nautica dos Descobrimentos: os descobrimentos maritimos visitos por um navegador'', 2 vols., Lisbon: Agencia Geral do Ultramar.</ref>  Indeed, in the Lisbon archives, there is a draft of a document based on Gama and intended for Cabral that gives the essential instruction: to strike in a southwesterly direction when he reaches the doldrums.<ref>After Cape Verde, where the wind is weak ('vento escasso') the ships should strike in the open ocean arc ('ir na volta do mar'), until the Cape of Good Hope, as this is the shorter route ('a navega\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 mais breve').  See Fonseca (1908: p.211; see also p.224) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false copy of letter]; see also Greenlee (1938: p.167)</ref>  The difference is that this time the arc was a little wider, Cabral went further west than Gama had, and as a result hit upon the hitherto unknown landmass of [[Brazil]].\n\nAlternative hypotheses forwarded for Cabral striking southwest have been (1.) that Cabral was trying to reach the [[Azores]] to repair his storm-battered fleet; (2.) that he was searching for and rounding up missing tempest-tossed ships; (3.) the hypothesis, already considered above, that it was an intentional attempt to discover if there was any land by the Tordesillas line.\n\n=== Discovery of Brazil ===\n{{Cleanup-tense|date=July 2012}}\nApril 21, 1500 \u2013 After nearly 30 days of sailing (44 since departure), on April 21 (a Tuesday in the [[octave of Easter]]),<ref>Fonseca (1908: p.225)</ref> Cabral's fleet finds the first indications of nearby land.\n\nApril 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada sights the Brazilian coast, seeing the outlines of a hill they name [[Monte Pascoal]] (some 60&nbsp;km south of modern [[Porto Seguro]], [[Bahia]]).\n\nApril 23, 1500 \u2013 The armada anchors at the mouth of the [[Do Frade River|Frade river]] and a group of local [[Tupiniquim]] Indians assembles on the beach. Cabral dispatches a small party, headed by [[Nicolau Coelho]], in a longboat ashore to make first contact.  Coelho tosses his hat in exchange for a feathered headdress, but the surf is too strong for a proper landing and opening of communication, and so they return to the ships.<ref>Fonseca (1908: p.241-42)</ref>\n\nApril 23\u201324, 1500 \u2013 Strong overnight winds on prompt the armada to lift anchor and sail some 10 leagues (45&nbsp;km) north, finding harbor behind the reef at Cabr\u00e1lia Bay, just north of [[Porto Seguro]].  The pilot Afonso Lopes goes [[Sounding line|sounding]] in a rowboat. He spies a native canoe, captures the two Indians on board, and brings them back to ship.  The language barrier prevents questioning, but they are fed and given cloth and beads. The cultural differences were staggering, fed with honey and cake, they spit them out and were deeply surprised with the sight of a chicken.<ref>Guia politicamente incorreto da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil, Leandro Narloch</ref>\n\nApril 25, 1500 \u2013 The next day a party led by [[Nicolau Coelho]] and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] goes ashore, accompanied by the two natives.  Armed Tupiniquim warily approach the beach, but on a signal from the two natives, lay down their bows, and allow the Portuguese to land and collect water.\n\n[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The First Mass in Brazil'' by [[Victor Meirelles]] (1861).]]\nApril 26, 1500 \u2013 (Octave of Easter Sunday) Franciscan friar Henrique Soares of Coimbra goes ashore to celebrate mass, curiously watched by some 200 Tupiniquim Indians.  It is the first known Christian mass on the American mainland.\n\nFor much of the week, interaction between the Portuguese and the Tupiniquim gradually increases.  There is a brisk trade in European iron nails, cloth, beads and crucifixes in return for American amulets, spears, parrots and monkeys. There is only the slightest hint that precious metals might be found in the hinterlands. Portuguese ''[[degredado]]s'' are assigned to spend the night in Tupiniquim villages, while the remainder of the crews sleep aboard ships.\n\n[[File:Carta-caminha.png|thumb|150px|Facsimile of the letter of [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] to  King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], reporting the discovery of the 'Island of the True Cross\" (Brazil)]]\nMay 1, 1500 \u2013 Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral makes preparations to resume the journey to India. The Portuguese pilots, assisted by the physician-astronomer Master Jo\u00e3o Faras and his astronomical instruments, determine that the land lies east of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]], prompting Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to formally claim Brazil for the Portuguese crown, bestowing upon it the name of ''Ilha de Vera Cruz'' (\"Island  of the True Cross\"\u2014later renamed ''Terra de Santa Cruz'', \"Land of the Holy Cross\", upon the realization that it is not an island).<ref>Gaspar Correia ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN05022145&as_brr=1&pg=PA152#v=onepage&q&f=false p.152]) and Jo\u00e3o de Barros ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA391#v=onepage&q&f=false p.391]) say it was named \"Santa Cruz\" from the start, with Correia noting it was named so because May 3 (the departure date) was the [[Feast of the Cross]] on the liturgical calendar.  But the letters of Caminha and Mestre Jo\u00e3o are both signed as written from \"Vera Cruz\" on May 1.</ref>\n\nOn May 2, 1500, Cabral dispatches the supply ship (captained either by [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]] or [[Gaspar de Lemos]]\u2014chronicles conflict on this<ref>Jo\u00e3o de Barros (1552: p.390) and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is (1566: p.69) say Gaspar de Lemos; Gaspar Correia (c.1550: p.152) says Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves.

It also carries a separate private letter to the king from Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], in which he identifies the main guiding constellation in the southern hemisphere, the [[Southern Cross]] (''Cruzeiro'').<ref>Some sources claim that the ''Cruzeiro'' constellation had already been identified by [[Alvise Cadamosto]] in the 1450s</ref>  The supply ship will arrive in Lisbon in June.\n\nMay 3, 1500 \u2013 Leaving behind a couple of Portuguese ''degredados'' with the Tupiniquim of Porto Seguro,<ref>Anonymous Pilot [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false p.110]</ref> Cabral orders the eleven remaining ships to set sail and continue on their route to India.\n\n=== Crossing to India ===\n\nLate May, 1500 \u2013 After crossing the Atlantic Ocean, Cabral's armada reaches the [[Cape of Good Hope]].  The fleet faces headlong winds for six straight days. Four ships are lost at sea in the process\u2014most tragically, the Sofala-destined ship of [[Bartolomeu Dias]].  The famous navigator, the first to round the Cape back in 1488, fatally fails to round it this time. The three others are the crown-owned ships of Aires Gomes da Silva, Sim\u00e3o de Pina and Vasco de Ata\u00edde <ref>Castanheda (1551), Barros (1552) and G\u00f3is (1566) all identify the same four (B. Dias, A. Gomes da Silva, S. da Pina, V. d' Ata\u00edde) as lost at the Cape.  The ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' mistakenly substitutes Sim\u00e3o de Miranda for Sim\u00e3o da Pina in the losses, although this is corrected in the marginal gloss. Gaspar Correia (1550) almost concurs\u2014but as he does not have Aires Gomes da Silva on his original captain list, he identifies the fourth ship lost as Gaspar de Lemos.   Analogously, the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which doesn't have Pina nor Gomes da Silva on its list, say it was Diogo de Figueir\u00f3 and Luis Pires who were lost (in addition to Vasco d'Ata\u00edde and Bartolomeu Dias).  Diogo do Couto (c.1600) mistakenly adds P\u00earo d'Ataide to the list, bringing the losses to five.</ref> (if Ata\u00edde had not been lost earlier at Cape Verde, he is certainly lost now; some scholars contend Pires was lost now, and Ata\u00edde was lost earlier).  In any case, the fleet is reduced to seven ships.  Facing strong winds, the seven split into smaller groups, to meet again on the other side.  Cabral holds two ships together with his own.\n\nJune 16, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's battered three-ship squadron reaches the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] (several leagues north of Sofala).  Two local merchant ships, catching sight of Cabral, take flight.  Cabral gives pursuit\u2014one of them runs aground and the other is captured.  Questioning quickly determines that these ships are owned by a cousin of the sultan Fateima of [[Malindi]] (who had received Vasco da Gama so graciously back in 1498), so they are released without harm.\n\nJune 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's three-ship squadron hobble on to [[Mozambique Island]].  Despite the earlier quarrel with Gama, Cabral is given an unexpectedly warm reception by the Sultan of Mozambique, and allowed to collect water and supplies.  Shortly after, three more ships of the 2nd Armada sail into Mozambique island and make junction with Cabral.  Only the ship of [[Diogo Dias]] (Bartolomeu's brother) remains missing.  As Dias's mission was for Sofala anyway, Cabral decides not to wait for it but rather to press on with his current fleet of six ships.\n\n[[File:Map of Cabral route, 1500.gif|thumb|340px|Approximate route of outward journey of Cabral's 2nd Armada (also route of stray ship of Diogo Dias)]]\nJuly 26, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada reaches the city-state of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city of the East African coast (which Gama had never visited).  Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala back in Lisbon and mercifully escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), goes ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim  [Note: There is no current ruling [[Kilwa Sultanate|Sultan of Kilwa]]\u2014the last one, al-Fudail, was deposed in a coup (c. 1495) by his minister, Emir Ibrahim, who had since ruled Kilwa with a vacant throne.]\n\nA meeting is arranged between Cabral and Emir Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in Kilwa harbor.  Cabral presents a letter from King Manuel I proposing a treaty, but Emir Ibrahim is suspicious and, for all the formal pleasantries, resistant to the overtures.  Cabral, feeling there's nothing to be achieved here and worried about missing the [[monsoon]] winds to India, decides to break off the negotiations and sail on.\n\nAugust 2, 1500, Pressing north, the Cabral fleet avoid hostile [[Mombassa]] (''Momba\u00e7a'') and finally reach friendly [[Malindi]] (''Melinde'').  There he drops off the Malindi ambassador that Gama had taken the previous year.  The Sultan of Malindi gives Cabral an excellent reception. Leaving behind  two ''degredados'' (Lu\u00eds de Moura and Jo\u00e3o Machado) and picking up two Gujarati pilots, Cabral's six-ship armada finally begins its Indian Ocean crossing on August 7.\n\n== Cabral in India ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\nAugust 22, 1500 \u2013 After an uneventful ocean crossing, Cabral's six ships land in [[Anjediva Island]] (''Angediva'', Anjadip), where they rest and recuperate, repair and repaint the ships.\n\nSeptember 13, 1500 \u2013 Sailing down the Indian coast, Cabral's expedition finally reaches at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode, the capital of the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] kingdom of same name ruled by Zamorins, or Nediyuiruppu Swarupam). Gaily decorated native boats come out to greet them, but remembering Gama's experience, Cabral refuses to go ashore until hostages are exchanged.  He dispatches Afonso Furtado and the four Calicut hostages taken by da Gama the previous year, to negotiate the details of the landing. This eventually done, Cabral finally goes ashore himself and meets new [[Zamorin]] of Calicut (the wary old Zamorin that da Gama had met, had recently died). The Portuguese are better-prepared this time\u2014Cabral presents the young Zamorin with much finer and more luxurious gifts than Gama had brought, and more respectful and personalized letters of address from King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].\n\nA commercial treaty is successfully negotiated, and the Zamorin gives Cabral a security-of-trade certificate etched on a silver plate. The Portuguese are allowed to establish a ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitoria]]'' in Calicut and Aires Correia, the designated factor for Calicut, goes ashore with some 70 men. Once the factory is set up, Cabral releases the ship hostages as a sign of trust. Correia immediately sets about buying spices in Calicut's markets for the ships to take home.\n\nOctober (?), 1500 \u2013 Not long after, the Zamorin of Calicut dispatches a service request to Cabral's idling fleet. Arab merchants allied with rival city-state of [[Cochin kingdom]] are returning from [[Ceylon]] with a cargo of [[war elephants]] destined for the Sultan of [[Cambay]] (Khambhat, Gujarat).  Claiming it to be illegal contraband (and the Zamorin could probably use the elephants himself), Cabral is asked if he can intercept them.  Cabral sends one of his caravels, brimming with cannon, under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]] (nicknamed 'Inferno'), to capture it.  Hoping for a spectacle, the Zamorin himself comes down to the beachfront to witness the engagement, but leaves in disgust when the Arab ship deftly slips past Ataide.  But Ata\u00edde gives chase and eventually catches up with it near [[Kannur|Cannanore]] and successfully seizes the vessel.  Cabral presents the captured ship, with its nearly intact elephant cargo (one pachyderm was killed in the engagement), to the Zamorin as a gift.\n\n=== Calicut Massacre ===\n\nDecember 1500 \u2013 After two months of operation, factor Aires Correia has only been able to buy enough spices to load two of the ships. He complains to Cabral his suspicions that the [[guild]] of Arab merchants in Calicut have been [[collusion|colluding]] to shut out Portuguese purchasing agents from the city's spice markets which is not unlikely. Arab traders had reportedly used similar collusive tactics to drive out Chinese merchants earlier in the 15th century from various ports on the [[Malabar Coast]]. It would make sense if they tried doing so again\u2014particularly as the Portuguese had arrived trumpeting their hatred of 'the Moors' and demanding trading privileges and preferences, a clear danger to their own trade.\n\nHistorians cite murkier elements to this, in particular, that the Portuguese traders might have been unwitting counters in on-going quarrels between competing older and newer Arab merchant guilds in Calicut and or used as pawns in the personal power struggles among the Zamorin's leading advisors, etc. There were certainly more dimensions to this affair, the full details of which will likely never be clearly known.\n\nCabral presents the complaint to the Zamorin, and requests that he crack down on the Arab merchant guild or enforce Portuguese priority in the spice markets.  But the Zamorin refuses to intervene in the matter\u2014or rather makes only some vague promises, but disdains to get actively involved in the matter, as Cabral demands.\n\nDecember 17, 1500 \u2013 Frustrated by the Zamorin's inaction, Cabral decides to take matters into his own hands.  On the advice of Aires Correia, Cabral orders the seizure of an Arab merchant ship from [[Jeddah]], then loading up with spices in Calicut harbor, claiming that as the Zamorin had promised the Portuguese priority in the spice markets, the cargo is rightfully theirs.  Incensed, the Arab merchants around the quay immediately raise a riot in Calicut and direct mobs to attack the Portuguese factory.  The Portuguese ships, anchored out in the harbor and unable to approach the docks, helplessly watch the unfolding massacre.  After three hours of fighting, some 53 (some say 70) Portuguese are slaughtered by the mobs\u2014including the factor Aires Correia, the secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], and three (some say five) of the Franciscan friars.  Around twenty Portuguese then in the city manage to escape the riot by jumping into the harbor waters and swimming to the ships.  The survivors report to Cabral that the Zamorin's own [[Hindu]] guards were seen either standing aside or actively helping the rioters.\n\nAt least one Portuguese, a man called Gon\u00e7alo Peixoto, survived the massacre, sheltered from the mob by a local merchant (whom the chronicles call \"Coja Bequij\").  In the aftermath, the wares in the Portuguese factory are impounded by the Calicut authorities.\n\n=== War with Calicut ===\n\nDecember 18\u201322, 1500 \u2013 Incensed at the attack on the factory, Cabral waits one day for redress by the Zamorin.  When this is not forthcoming, Cabral takes his revenge. The Portuguese seize around ten Arab merchant ships then in harbor, confiscating their cargoes, killing their crews, and burning their ships.  Then, accusing the Zamorin of sanctioning the riot, Cabral orders a full day [[shore bombardment]] of Calicut, doing immense damage to the unfortified city (estimates of Calicut casualties reach up to 600). Cabral proceeds to also bomb the nearby Zamorin-owned port of Pandarane (Pantalayani Kollam, near present-day [[Koyilandy]]) as well.<ref>The port of ''Pandarane'' has since vanished.  Its location is usually identified as 'Pantalyini Kollam', a port that has since been annexed by the growing city of [[Koyilandy]]; it is also sometimes identified with modern [[Kappad]]. (Dames, 1918: p.85)</ref>\n\nThus opened the war between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Zamorin of Calicut.  The war will drag on for the next decade.  Future [[Portuguese India Armadas]] have to contend with this conflict, it will dictate Portuguese strategy in the Indian Ocean and draw in other participants.  The conflict will also overturn the political order on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India, and shape a different future for [[Kerala]].\n\n=== Alliance with Cochin kingdom ===\n\n[[File:Kerala cities at time of Cabral (1500).gif|thumb|250px|India [[Malabar Coast]] c. 1500]]\nDecember 24, 1500 \u2013 Cabral leaves smoldering Calicut, unsure of what to do next. At the suggestion of [[Gaspar da Gama]] (the Goese Jew who had been accompanying the expedition), Cabral sets sail south along the coast towards [[Cochin kingdom]] (''Cochim'', Kochi or Perumpadappu Swarupam), a small [[Hindu]] [[Nair]] city-state at the outlet of the [[brackish]] [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad]] lagoon in the Kerala backwaters. Half-in-vassalage and half-at-war with Zamorin's Calicut, Cochin kingdom had long chafed at the dominance of its larger neighbor and was looking for an opportunity to break away.\n\nArriving in Cochin, a Portuguese emissary, accompanied by a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christian]] picked up in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], are set ashore to make contact with the Trimumpara Raja (Unni Goda Varma), the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] prince of [[Cochin kingdom]].<ref>The exact status of the 'Trimumpara Raja', the ruling prince of Cochin, is a bit unclear.  It seems the formal ruler of Cochin was the king of [[Edapalli]], across the lagoon on the mainland, that the Cochinese peninsula (with capital at [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]]) had at some point been detached as an appanage for a son, who, in turn, had detached the northern tip, Cochin proper, for another son.  Moreover, it seems these appanages were not supposed to be permanent fiefs, but rather to serve as temporary 'training' grounds for princely heirs before they moved up in succession order.  In other words, the ruler of Cochin was the second heir of Edapalli.  Upon the death of the ruler of Edapalli, the first heir was supposed to leave the peninsula and take up his duties in Edapalli, and the second heir move from Cochin to Perumpadappu, and assign Cochin to his own successor (the new second heir). It seems the Portuguese arrived at a time when the princely heirs were somewhat at odds with each other\u2014possibly because of some violation in the rules of succession, or simply because the ruler of Cochin was tired of waiting for his turn. It is only  under Portuguese protection that the rulers of Cochin finally became proper kings in their own right.  Thus, the Raja Trimumpara's search for a Portuguese alliance have more to do with his own family quarrels than with the exactions of the Zamorin of Calicut.  See Dames (1918: p.86n).</ref> The Portuguese are greeted warmly\u2014the bombardment of hated Zamorin's Calicut outweighing the earlier matter of the war elephants.  All the cordialities and hostage-swapping quickly fulfilled, Cabral himself goes ashore and negotiates a treaty of alliance between Portugal and Cochin kingdom, directed against Zamorin's Calicut. Cabral promises to make the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin the ruler of kingdom of Calicut, upon the city's capture.\n\nA Portuguese factory is set up in Cochin, with Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa as chief factor (the pre-designated Aires Correia having perished in the Calicut Massacre). A smaller, poorer city, the spice markets of Cochin are not nearly as well supplied as Calicut, but the trade is good enough to begin loading ships.  The stay in Cochin is not without incident\u2014the factory is set ablaze one evening (probably at the instigation of Arab traders in the city), but the Trimumpara Raja will not countenance a repeat of the events of Calicut.  He cracks down on the arsonists, takes the Portuguese under his protection (the factors stay in his palace), and assigns his personal [[Nair]] guards to escort the Portuguese factors in the city's markets and protect the factory against any further incidents.\n\nEarly January 1501 \u2013 While in Cochin, Cabral receives missives from the rulers of [[Kannur|Cannanore]] (''Canonor'', Kannur or Kolathunad, further north, another of Calicut's reluctant rivals) and [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam or Venad Swarupam, further south, once a great Syrian Christian merchant city-state, entrepot for cinnamon, ginger and dyewood).  They commend Cabral's actions against Zamorin's Calicut, and invite the Portuguese to trade in their cities instead. Not wishing to offend his gracious Cochinese host, Cabral politely declines the invitations, promising only to visit those cities at some future date.\n\nWhile still at Cochin, Cabral receives yet another invitation, this one from nearby [[Kodungallur Kovilakam|Cranganore kingdom]] (''Cranganor'', Kodungallur). Once a great city on the northern end of the Vembanad lagoon, capital of the [[Chera dynasty]] of [[Sangam period]], Cranganore had since fallen on hard times.  Mother nature delivered Cranganore two severe blows\u2014silting up the channels that connected Cranganore to the waterways, and breaking open a competing sea outlet by Cochin in the 14th century.<ref>Cochin was originally just a village along a long embankment.  Violent overflows of the [[Periyar River]] in 1341 forced the opening of the outlet between the Vembanad lagoon and the Arabian Sea at the juncture where Cochin now sits, separating the long Cochinese peninsula from what is now [[Vypin]] island. See Hunter's ''Imperial Gazetteer'' (1908: p.360).</ref> Cochin's rise had been principally due to the re-routing of commercial traffic away from Cranganore. Nonetheless, the remaining merchants of the dwindling city still maintained their old connections to the Kerala pepper plantations in the interior. Finding the supply in Cochin running low, Cabral takes up the offer to top up their cargo at Cranganore.\n\nThe visit to Cranganore turns out to be an eye-opener for the Portuguese, for among the city's remaining inhabitants are substantial established communities of [[Cochin Jews|Malabari Jews]] and [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christians]].  The encounter with a clearly recognizable Christian community in Kerala confirms to Cabral what the Franciscan friars had already suspected back in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]\u2014namely, that Vasco da Gama's earlier hypothesis about a 'Hindu Church' was mistaken. If real Christians have existed alongside Hindus in India for centuries, then clearly [[Hinduism]] must be a distinct and separate religion, 'heathen idolaters', as the Portuguese friars characterized them, rather than a 'primitive' form of Christianity.  Two Syrian Christian priests from Cranganore apply to Cabral for passage to Europe (one of them, known as Jos\u00e9 de Cranganore or Joseph the Indian (''Josephus Indus''), will provide instrumental intelligence about India to the Portuguese.<ref>Upon arrival in Lisbon, Joseph the Indian spent a couple of years being intensely interviewed by the Portuguese court and the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], relating to them his detailed knowledge of the history and geography of India and points east, expanding Portuguese intelligence dramatically.  It is likely that the detailed depiction of the east Indian coast and the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 is owed in large part to Joseph's information.  Around 1503, Joseph proceeded to Rome to meet [[Pope Alexander VI]] and report on the condition of the Malabari [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christian]] church.  It was on this trip that Joseph dictated his famous narrative on India to an Italian scribe, which was eventually published in 1507 (in Italian) as part of a collection, ''Paesi Novamente Retrovati'', edited by Fracanzio da Montalboddo.  The narrative includes Joseph's own account of Cabral's expedition.  See Vallavanthara (2001).</ref>\n\nJanuary 16, 1501 \u2013 News arrives that the Zamorin of Calicut had assembled and dispatched a fleet of around 80 boats against the Portuguese in Cochin.  Despite the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin's offer of military assistance against the Calicut fleet, Cabral decides to precipitously lift anchor and slip away rather than risk a confrontation.  Cabral's armada leave behind the factor Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa and six assistants in Cochin.  In their hasty departure, the Portuguese inadvertently take along two of the Trimumpara's officers (Idikkela Menon and Parangoda Mennon), who had been serving as noble hostages aboard the vessels.\n\nHeading north, Cabral's armada takes a wide sweep to avoid Calicut, and pays a quick visit to [[Kannur|Cannanore]].  Cabral is warmly received by the [[Kolathiri]] Raja of Cannanore who, eager for a Portuguese alliance, offers to sell the Portuguese spices on credit. Cabral accepts the cargo but pays him nonetheless (not a splendid cargo\u2014only low-quality ginger, as it turns out, but Cabral is appreciative of the gesture.)\n\nHis ships now filled with spices, Cabral decides not to visit [[Quilon]], as he had earlier promised, but to make way back home to Portugal.\n\n== Diogo Dias' misadventures ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nWhile Cabral's main fleet was in India, [[Diogo Dias]], captain of the missing seventh ship of the armada, was going through his own set of adventures.\n\n[[File:Detail of Diogo Dias's ship (Cabral Armada).jpg|thumb|180px|Ship of [[Diogo Dias]], detail from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\nShortly after being separated from the main fleet at the Cape in June 1500, Dias had struck out too far east into the Indian Ocean and sighted the western coast of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Although the island was not unknown (its Arab name, \"island of the Moon\", was already reported by [[Pero de Covilha|Covilh\u00e3]]), Diogo Dias was the first Portuguese captain to have sighted it and is often credited with renaming it the island of ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'', on account of it being found on [[St. Lawrence]]'s day (August 10, 1500).  However, a proper landing on Madagascar would not be undertaken until 1506 and it would only be extensively explored in 1508.\n\nProbably thinking he was on a South African island, Diogo Dias tried to find the African coast by sailing straight north from Madagascar, hoping to reconnect with Cabral's armada there, or at least to make it to [[Sofala]] (Dias's formal destination).  But to no avail.  He had struck too far east, and was heading along north in open ocean.  Dias sighted the African coast only around [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''). By this time, Cabral had already crossed the Indian Ocean, and the change in the monsoon winds prevented Dias from undertaking his own crossing. Dias pushed up the coast, unexpectedly going past [[Cape Guardafui]] into the [[Gulf of Aden]], waters as yet unsailed by Portuguese ships.  Dias spent the next few months in the area\u2014trapped by contrary winds, battered by tempests, attacked by Arab pirates, and forced aground on the [[Eritrea]]n coast, in a desperate search for water and food.\n\nDias eventually (in late 1500 and early 1501) managed to procure supplies, repair his ship and catch a favorable wind to take him out of that harrowing trap.  With his remaining six crewmen, Dias set sail back to Portugal, hoping to catch Cabral's armada on the return journey.\n\n== Return journey ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nLate January, 1501 \u2013 Cabral takes aboard an ambassador from Cannanore, and starts his ocean crossing back to East Africa.  On the way, the Portuguese capture a  Gujarati ship, replete with a magnificent cargo.  They steal the cargo, but spare the crew, once they realize they are not Arabs.\n\nFebruary, 1501 \u2013 As Cabral's expedition approaches [[Malindi]], vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]], sailing at the front, runs his spice-laden ship, the ''El Rei'', aground on the Malindi coast.  Irreparable, the great ship is burnt (to recover the iron fittings) and the crews and the cargo reallocated.  Cabral's armada is now reduced to five ships. Cabral authorizes the king of Malindi to recover the cannons from the ''El Rei'' wreck and keep them for himself.\n\nSpring, 1501 \u2013 Cabral's fleet reaches [[Mozambique Island]].  As there is no sign or news from [[Diogo Dias]] awaiting him, Cabral realizes he must take responsibility for the Sofala mission himself.  Cabral orders the private ship ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha, the fastest in the fleet, to be placed under the command of veteran hand [[Nicolau Coelho]], and dispatched ahead of the rest of the fleet and deliver the results of the voyage to Portugal.  Vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]] (who had lost the ''El-Rei'') is given the chance to make amends by taking command of the caravel ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (hitherto commanded by [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]) and seek out Sofala and to proceed home alone from there.  Ata\u00edde is transferred to the command of Coelho's old nau.\n\nIn the meantime, Cabral lands a ''[[degredado]]'' Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes on the African coast, with letters of instruction for Diogo Dias and any passing Portuguese expeditions, informing them of the dramatic turn of events in India, and warning them to avoid Calicut.\n\n[It is uncertain exactly where Cabral left Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes or where he was ordered to go.  According to Ata\u00edde, Fernandes was ordered to go to Mombassa (odd, as Mombassa was then on hostile terms with the Portuguese); others suggest he was supposed to go to Kilwa (which is where the 3rd Armada of [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]] will find him). Others have speculated that Fernandes was left in Kilwa on the outward leg, and that Cabral's letters were dispatched to him by a local messenger from Mozambique on the return.  Another possibility is that Fernandes was instructed to make his way to Sofala overland, meet Tovar's ship there, and then proceed to explore inland from there to locate [[Monomatapa]] (but then why give him the letters?).  Finally, some conjecture Fernandes is being confused with another degredado, Jo\u00e3o Machado, who had been left in Malindi on the first leg, that he was picked up on the return, and now sent back once again with the letters.]\n\nMarch\u2013April, 1501 \u2013 Matters settled, Cabral takes the remaining three ships\u2014his own flagship, the large nau of Sim\u00e3o de Miranda and Coelho's ship (now under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]])\u2014and sets sail out of Mozambique island.\n\nAta\u00edde gets separated from the other two in the [[Mozambique Channel]] soon after departure. He hurries to S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s ([[Mossel Bay]], South Africa), hoping to find Cabral there waiting for him.  But he is out of luck\u2014Cabral and Miranda had decided to proceed on together towards Lisbon without him.  Not finding any trace of the others, Ata\u00edde decides to make his way home on his own, leaving behind a letter in a boot by a local watering hole giving an account of the expedition (Ataide's note will be found later that year by [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd Armada]]).\n\nIn the meantime, Sancho de Tovar, aboard the ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', finally sights [[Sofala]], the entrepot of Monomatapa gold.  He doesn't go ashore, and instead contents himself with scouting the city from his ship, and then sets sail back home alone.\n\n=== Conference at Bezeguiche ===\n\nJune 2, 1501 \u2013 Following up on the discovery of Brazil the previous year, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] had assembled a small exploratory expedition of three caravels under an unnamed Portuguese captain, and carrying the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] aboard, to explore and map the coast of Brazil.  The exact identity of the captain is uncertain - some speculate it to be [[Gaspar de Lemos]] or [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]], whichever of the two had commanded the supply vessel that had delivered the news in June 1500; others conjecture Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves went merely as passengers, and that the expedition itself was commanded by [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]].<ref>[[Amerigo Vespucci]] wrote two detailed accounts of this Brazilian mapping expedition - in ''Mundus Novus'' (pub. 1502/03) and as the \"third voyage\" in ''Lettera a Soderini'' (pub.1504/05) - but does not identify the Portuguese captain by name in either.  Chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]], writing a half-century later, identifies the mapping captain as the same captain who steered the returning supply ship - ergo the Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves identification.  Greenlee (1945) suggests the captain was [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]], although this has been dismissed by others (e.g. Roukema, 1963).  More recently, historians have drawn attention to a nautical chart by [[Vesconte de Maggiolo]], which identifies the Brazilian landmass with the label ''Tera de Gonsalvo Coigo Vocatur Santa Cruz'' (translated as \"Land of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] called Santa Cruz\").  [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] is known to have led a later expedition to Brazil (which set out in 1503), but it is commonly estimated that Coelho was still out at sea when Maggiolo composed his chart (c. 1504-05), thereby suggesting Coelho might have also captained the previous 1501 mapping expedition as well. (Morison, 1974, vol. 2, p.281)</ref> Setting out from Lisbon in May 1501, the little Brazilian mapping expedition made a watering stop in early June at ''Bezeguiche'' (as the bay of [[Dakar]] (Senegal) was known to the Portuguese sailors of the time) and stumbles upon  [[Diogo Dias]] cooling his heels there. Dias relates to the Portuguese captain and Vespucci the tales of his misadventures\u2014how he had been separated from Cabral at the Cape, how he had ventured up to the Gulf of Aden, and, finding no trace of Cabral on his return, decided to wait for him in Bezeguiche. Just two days later, the lead ship of the returning India fleet\u2014the ''Anunciada'' under [[Nicolau Coelho]]\u2014sails into Bezeguiche, surprised to find both Dias and the Brazilian mapping expedition there (apparently  Bezeguiche must have been a pre-arranged point of encounter for the Second Armada).\n\nFor the next two weeks, the captains and crews of the different ships exchange tales of their travels and adventures.  It has been since speculated that it was during this time that Amerigo Vespucci came up with his \"[[New World]]\" hypothesis.  After all, Vespucci was quite familiar with the Americas, having participated in [[Alonso de Ojeda|Ojeda]]'s 1499 expedition to the coasts of South America, and it is said he had intense discussions at Bezeguiche with [[Gaspar da Gama]], the Goese Jew aboard Coelho's ship, undoubtedly the person most familiar with the East Indies. Comparing notes, it probably dawned on Vespucci that it was simply impossible to square what he knew of the Americas with what the men of the 2nd Armada knew of Asia.  While still at Bezeguiche, Vespucci wrote a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], relating his encounter, which he sends back with some Florentine passengers on the ''Anunciada''.<ref>Vespucci's 1501 letter is reproduced in Varnhagen (1865).   An English translation can be found in W.H.Greenlee (1938: p.152ff).</ref>  This was a prelude to an even more famous letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo in 1503, shortly after his return, where he finally asserts that the Brazilian landmass was in fact a continent, that the lands discovered to the west were definitely not part of Asia, but must be an entirely different continent, a \"[[New World]]\".<ref>Vespucci (1503). After leaving Bezeguiche, the mapping expedition would make landfall at [[Cape S\u00e3o Roque]] in August 1501, and proceeded to sail south along the Brazilian coast, possibly as far as the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] coast. They returned to Lisbon before September 1502, perhaps as early as June. A second mapping expedition, this time more certainly under [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], also accompanied by Vespucci (his \"fourth voyage\"), set out for Brazil in April, 1503.</ref>\n\nMid-June, 1501 \u2013 Lemos & Vespucci leave Bezeguiche for Brazil. Shortly after, the pair [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda themselves reach Bezeguiche, where they find Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho awaiting them. Cabral sends Coelho's swift ''Anunciada'' ahead to Lisbon to announce their return, while the remainder rest and wait in Bezeguiche for the remaining two ships.  [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]'s ship (making his way alone from Mossel Bay) and [[Sancho de Tovar]]'s ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (returning from Sofala) arrive in Bezeguiche by the end of June.\n\nJune 23, 1501 \u2013 The ''Anunciada'', commanded by [[Nicolau Coelho]], arrives in Lisbon and anchors in [[Bel\u00e9m]].  (Just as in case of Vasco da Gama's expedition, it turns out Nicolau Coelho is once again the first to deliver the news!)  The merchants of the consortium led by [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] (who own the ''Anunciada'') are delighted.  Letters are immediately fired off throughout Europe announcing the results.\n\nThe news arrives too late for [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd India Armada]], which departed for India in April.  But Nova will collect the necessary information along the way\u2014from the note in Ata\u00edde's shoe in Mossel Bay, and from Cabral's letters in the possession of Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes in Kilwa.\n\nJuly 21, 1501 \u2013 One month after Coelho's arrival, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda, the two larger ships, finally arrive in Lisbon. The other three ships arrive a few days later: Sancho de Tovar and P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde on July 25 and the hapless Diogo Dias, with his empty caravel, on July 27.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bernardelli - Monumento a Cabral.jpg|thumb|180px|Monument to [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Lisbon, copy of a Brazilian monument by Rodolpho Bernardelli]]\nOn the surface, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's 2nd Armada had been a failure and the reaction was conspicuously muted.\n\nShip losses were very heavy. Of the thirteen ships sent out, only five returned with cargo (four crown, one private), five were lost at sea, three returned without cargo (Gaspar de Lemos, Lu\u00eds Pires and Diogo Dias).\n\nHuman losses were even more disheartening.  This included all the crews and captains of the four ships lost at the Cape (notably, the celebrated discoverer Bartolomeu Dias).  Another fifty-something Portuguese (including the factor Aires Correia) had been killed in the Calicut massacre.\n\nThen there were the mission failures.  Relative to the instructions given to him in Lisbon, Cabral had failed on nearly every count:\n*1. failed to establish a treaty with the Zamorin of Calicut\u2014indeed, Calicut was now more hostile than ever.\n*2. failed to establish a factory at Calicut (massacred);\n*3. failed to bring the 'Hindu Church' in line (the friars that survived reported the Hindus weren't Christians after all, just 'idolaters');\n*4. failed to make a treaty with Kilwa;\n*5. failed to establish a factory at Sofala (seen from afar by Tovar, but that is all).\n\nOn the other hand, in his defense, Cabral could point to some positive achievements.\n\n*1. opening of friendly relations with Cochin, Canannore and Quilon;\n*2. a factory in Cochin, poorer than Calicut perhaps, but workable;\n*3. discovery of true Christian communities in Cranganore, etc.;\n*4. Sofala was at least discovered and scouted;\n*5. discovery of Brazil, which might serve as a useful staging post for future India runs;\n*6. Diogo Dias's discovery of Madagascar and exploration of the African coast up to Cape Guardafui and the Gulf of Aden was useful information.\n*7. Finally, Cabral did bring back tons of spices, which were off-loaded into the Lisbon warehouses and sold at no small profit for the crown treasury.\n\nHowever, it was the ship and human losses that weighed heavily against Cabral being honored or rewarded. Allegations of 'incompetence' flew easily in the circles that mattered. Although Cabral was initially offered the command of the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]], scheduled for 1502, it seemed more like a ''pro forma'' gesture than a sincere offer.<ref>Subrahmanyam (1997: p.191)</ref> The crown made it clear that Cabral's command would be limited and supervised \u2013 conditions humiliating enough to force Cabral to withdraw his name.  The 4th Armada would be placed under the command of [[Vasco da Gama]].\n\nAlthough the reaction of Portuguese court opinion in 1501, on Cabral's return, was generally low, it ascended retrospectively.  Cabral's discovery of Brazil, initially received as a minor discovery of little interest, turned out to be much more momentous.  The follow-up Brazilian mapping expeditions of 1501-02 and 1503-04, under the captaincy of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], carrying the Florentine cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], revealed a massive continent - which Vespucci famously labelled a \"[[New World]]\" (''Mundus Novus'').  The plentitude of [[brazilwood]] (''pau-brasil'') discovered by the mapping expeditions on its shores lured the interest of European cloth industry, and led to the 1505 contract granted to [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]] for the commercial exploitation of Brazil. The lucrative brazilwood trade eventually drew competition from French and Spanish interlopers, forcing the Portuguese government to take a more active interest in Cabral's \"[[Name of Brazil|Land of Vera Cruz]]\", finally leading to the establishment of the first Portuguese colonies in [[Colonial Brazil]] in 1532.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\n* [[Portuguese India Armadas]]\n* [[Portuguese India]]\n* [[Alternative theory of the European discovery of Brazil]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n'''Eyewitness Accounts'''\n\n* [Anonymous Pilot] \"Navigationi del Capitano Pedro Alvares Cabral Scrita per un Piloto Portoghese et Tradotta di Lingua Portoghese in Italiana\", first published in Francanzano Montalbado, 1507, editor, ''Paesi novamente retrovati et Novo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato'', Vicenza.

In the horse, it is most commonly caused by pain, but can be due to neurologic or mechanical dysfunction. Lameness is a common veterinary problem in [[racehorse]]s, [[sport horse]]s, and pleasure horses. It is one of the most costly health problems for the equine industry, both monetarily for the cost of diagnosis and treatment, and for the cost of time off resulting in loss-of-use.<ref>Seitzinger AH, Traub-Dargatz JL, Kane AJ, Kopral CA, Morley PS, Garber LP, Losinger WC, & Hill GW. \"Comparison of the Economic Costs of Equine Lameness, Colic, and Equine Protozoal Myeloencephalitis (EPM)\".

Horses are predisposed to orthopedic lameness by conformational flaws, poor hoof balance, working on poor footing, repetitive movements, poor conditioning for a given activity, and competing at a very high athletic level.<ref name=\"MVM Online\"/>\n\n'''Metabolic''' causes of lameness include [[hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (equine)|hyperkalemic periodic paralysis]] (HYPP) and [[Equine polysaccharide storage myopathy|polysaccharide storage myopathy]], which directly affect muscular function.\n\n'''Circulatory''' causes of lameness occur when blood flow to an area is compromised.  This may be due to abnormal blood clotting, as in the case of aortic-iliac [[thrombosis]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Maxie | first1 = MG | last2 = Physick-Sheard | first2 = PW | year = 1985 | title = Aortic-Iliac Thrombosis in Horses | url = | journal = Vet.

These include problems such as [[cellulitis]], hoof abscesses, and [[septic arthritis]].\n\n===Mechanical lameness===\nMechanical lameness is caused by a physical abnormality, such as scar tissue, that prevents normal motion of a limb. Mechanical lameness does not cause pain. Classic examples of mechanical lameness include upward fixation of the patella and fibrotic myopathy, but any type of adhesion (often secondary to scarring during healing post-injury) or fibrosis can cause mechanical lameness.\n* Upward fixation of the patella occurs when the normal locking mechanism of the stifle, which allows the horse to \"lock\" its hind legs into a fixed position so it may stand with minimal effort, engages at inappropriate times such as when the horse is walking. It results in an inability to flex the stifle, so the horse must walk with an extended hind leg. It is associated with straight hind limb [[equine conformation|conformation]] (post leg), poor muscling of the hind limb, stifle trauma, and genetics.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tnibar | first1 = M.

Neurologic causes of lameness include:\n\n* Cervical vertebral stenotic myopathy ([[Wobbler disease#Wobbler disease in horses|Wobbler disease]]): compression of the spinal cord in the cervical (neck) region results in lameness, ataxia, and change in gait, especially in the hind legs, and neck stiffness or pain.\n* [[Stringhalt]]: caused by damage to the long digital extensor muscle, or from eating the weed [[Hypochaeris radicata]]; it produces a gait characterized by rapid, spasmodic hyperflexion of the hind limbs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Huntington | first1 = P.

Radial nerve paralysis will cause a dropped elbow and make it difficult to extend the affected limb. Suprascapular nerve damage will lead to atrophy of the main muscles of the shoulder (sweeny). Femoral nerve paralysis causes hyperflexion of the stifles, hocks, and fetlocks and the horse usually walks on the toe of the hind foot.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dyson | first1 = S. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = P. | last3 = Whitwell | first3 = K. | year = 1988 | title = Femoral nerve paralysis after general anaesthesia | url = | journal = Equine Veterinary Journal | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 376\u2013380 | doi = 10.1111/j.2042-3306.1988.tb01550 }}</ref>\n* Infectious causes affecting the nervous system may be bacterial, viral, protozoal, or rickettsial. Those that commonly alter gait include [[tetanus]], [[botulism]], [[Lyme disease]], [[equine protozoal myeloencephalitis]] (EPM), [[rabies]], [[West Nile virus]], [[eastern equine encephalitis virus|equine encephalitis virus]], and [[equine herpesvirus 1]].\n* [[Neoplasia|Neoplasic]] (cancerous) changes in the brain or around the spinal cord may also cause alterations in gait.\n\n==Signs of lameness==\nManifestations of lameness include any alteration in gait from what is normal for the horse. In general, it is harder to detect hind limb lameness when compared to lameness in a front limb when using visual cues.\n\n===Identifying a front limb lameness===\nThe classic sign of lameness in a front leg is a prominent \"head bob.\" Viewed from the side, the horse raises its head and neck when the lame leg hits the ground, which helps to unload the lame leg. This is sometimes remembered by the adage \"down on sound.\" A head bob is usually easy to see when one leg is lame, but can be subtle in very mild unilateral lameness, or in the case of bilateral front limb lameness.<ref name=MEL/> A horse may also try to reduce impact on a lame front leg by tensing of the muscles of the shoulder. In this case, it will stiffen the limb just before it hits the ground, a sign that may be noticed by an astute observer.<ref name=MEL/>\n\n===Identifying a hind limb lameness===\nEvaluation of hind limb lameness can be difficult. Generally, the viewer watches the hip, sacrum, gluteal muscles, or hemi-pelvis (pelvis of one side of the body) when examining lameness in the hind end. Examination should be performed both watching the horse from behind while trotting away from the examiner, and from the side as the horse passes.\n\nWhen watching from behind, the viewer often looks for a \"hip hike\" or \"pelvic hike.\" This occurs when the horse raises the pelvis on the lame side as it is bearing weight, trying to shift weight off of the painful leg in a manner similar to raising of the head in front limb lameness. This is a sudden, short upward motion of the hemi-pelvis or gluteal muscles. The hip of the lame leg does not always rise above the level of the hip of the sound leg, which can be confusing to those looking for a \"hip hike.\" Instead, it is an exaggerated upward movement that is watched for during weight bearing. Additionally, horses with a hind limb lameness will tend to reduce the degree of leg use. To do so, some horses will reduce the contraction time of the gluteals on the side of the lame leg, leading to a \"hip roll\" or \"hip dip\" and appearance that the hip drops a greater degree on the side of the lame leg.<ref name=MEL/>\n\nThese apparently contradictory statements (\"hip hike\" vs \"hip drop\" on the lame leg) can be explained by when the horse perceives pain during the stride. If the pain is perceived during the early stance phase of the stride, the horse will try to unweight the leg and produce a \"hip hike.\" If the pain is perceived during the pushoff phase of the stride, the horse does not push with as much force, subsequently reducing the height the pelvis is raised, and leading to a \"dipping\" motion during the swing phase of the stride as the horse brings the limb forward. In some cases, both a hip hike and a hip drop can be seen in the same horse.<ref name=Keegan>Keegan KG. Head Nods and Hip Hikes. Western Veterinary Conference 2013. {{cite web |url=http://www.wvc.org/images/session_notes_2013/2013_EQ21.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229010842/http://www.wvc.org/images/session_notes_2013/2013_EQ21.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-29 }}</ref> Some practitioners simply look for the side with the greater overall deviation, which occurs in the lame leg<ref name=\"MVM Online\"/><ref name=MEL/>\n\nAnother method to detecting hind limb lameness requires watching the pelvis from the side. The entire pelvis is evaluated, and its relative position vertically (relative to the ground) is compared at various points in the stride. The pelvis normally rises and falls with each step. Horses with pain during the early stance phase of the trot will not allow the pelvis to drop as much when the lame leg is weighted, trying to avoid extra weight on the painful leg. Subsequently, the pelvis will not fall as much downward when the lame leg is bearing weight as when the sound leg is bearing weight. When viewed from behind, this is seen as a \"hip hike.\" If the horse is more painful as it is pushing off a limb, it will not push off with as much force, and the pelvis will rise less on the lame side relative to the same point of the stride when the sound leg is on the ground. This is seen as the \"hip roll\" when viewed from behind.<ref name=Keegan/>\n\nOther signs that indicate hind limb lameness include \"plaiting\" with the hind feet, which can be seen in cases of sacro-iliac pain,<ref name=\"SI lesions\"/> carrying the hindquarters to one side or drifting in one direction,<ref name=MEL/><ref name=\"Dyson Stifle\">Dyson SJ. \"Lameness Associated with the Stifle and Pelvic Regions.

One method is to look at the relative time a leg spends in the cranial (forward) phase of the stride. For a front leg, this is when the lower leg is in front of the horse, i.e. angled forward, while the caudal phase is when the leg is underneath the horse, i.e. angled backward. For a hind leg, the cranial phase occurs when the lower leg is under the body of the horse, and the caudal phase is when the limb is out behind the body of the horse.\n\nA normal horse with have a cranial phase and a caudal phase of equal length: the horse will bring the leg as far forward as it does backward. In a lame horse, the cranial phase will be shorter when compared to the caudal phase, so it appears to spend more time with the leg backward than it does forward. A shortened cranial phase is most commonly seen in cases of bilateral lameness, lameness of the upper limb (such as shoulder or hip pain), and osteoarthritis of the hocks.<ref name=MEL/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dyson | first1 = S | year = 1986 | title = Shoulder lameness in horses: An analysis of 58 suspected cases | url = | journal = Equine Veterinary Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = 29\u201336 | doi = 10.1111/j.2042-3306.1986.tb03531.x }}</ref><ref>Wright, I.M.

It is the first step to evaluate decreased performance in an equine athlete, even if the horse does not appear overtly lame, to rule out any pain-associated cause.\n\nLameness exams are also a key component of the [[equine prepurchase exam|pre-purchase examination]]. These examinations evaluate the horse to give the potential buyer information regarding present soundness of the horse. Veterinarians may comment on aspects that could inhibit the use of the horse for the buyer's intended activity, such as subclinical osteoarthritis or conformational defects. However, the veterinarian is not there to \"pass\" or \"fail\" a horse, but only to give their impression of the horse on that day.<ref name=MEL>{{cite book|last1=Baxter|first1=Gary|title=Manual of Equine Lameness|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-8138-1546-6}}</ref> Therefore, pre-purchase examinations make no guarantees of the future health or soundness of the horse. The pre-purchase exam may range in scope depending on the desire of the buyer, from a simple examination with hoof and flexion tests, to multiple radiographs, ultrasound, and advanced imaging techniques including MRI.\n\n===History===\nA detailed history is the first step of a lameness exam.  \n#Age: Foals are more likely to have infectious causes of lameness ([[septic arthritis]]). Horses just starting training may be lame due to a developmental orthopedic disease, such as osteochondrosis. Older animals are more likely to experience [[osteoarthritis]].<ref name=MEL/>  \n#Breed: Breed-specific diseases, such as [[hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (equine)|hyperkalemic periodic paralysis]] (HYPP), can be ruled out. Additionally, some breeds or types are more prone to certain types of lameness.\n#Discipline: Certain lamenesses are associated with certain uses. For example, racehorses are more likely to have fatigue-related injuries such as stress fractures and injury to the flexor tendons, while western show horses are more likely to suffer from navicular syndrome and English sport horses are more likely to have osteoarthritis or injury to the suspensory ligament.<ref name=MEL/>\n#Past history of lameness: An old injury may be re-injured. In the case of progressive disease, such as osteoarthritis, a horse will often experience recurrent lameness that must be managed. Shifting lameness may suggest a bilateral injury or infectious cause of lameness.\n#Duration and progression the lameness: Acute injury is more common with soft tissue injury. Chronic, progressive disease is more common in cases such as osteoarthritis and navicular disease. \n#Recent changes in management: such as turn-out, exercise level, diet, or shoeing.\n#Effect of exercise on degree of lameness.<ref name=MEL/>\n#Any treatment implemented, including rest.<ref name=MEL/>\n\n===Physical examination and palpation===\n[[Image:Zippo 09.JPG|thumb|upright|100px|Splints can be palpated on physical examination.]]\nOne of the first steps of the lameness examination is to evaluate the horse at rest. A good evaluation of [[equine conformation|conformation]], including overall body type, can help the practitioner determine the potential cause of lameness. Certain conformational defects can predispose a horse to injury, and knowledge of correct conformation can help narrow down possible causes of injury, especially when combined with the horse's history. The horse's stance is also evaluated. Frequently resting a particular leg, \"pointing\" a foot (holding a leg out in front of the body), or standing in an abnormal position can indicate compensation for an injury. Shifting of weight is normal in the hind legs, but frequent shifting of weight in the front legs, or placing both front feet in front of the body, can indicate bilateral forelimb lameness.<ref name=MEL/> Stifle pain sometimes causes a horse to stand with the stifles rotated out.<ref name=\"Dyson Stifle\"/> Hip and pelvic pain can produce a toe-out, stifle out, hock-in stance and that remains present at the walk.<ref name=MEL/>\n\nAsymmetry of the muscular structure, due to muscle atrophy, usually occurs on the side of the lame limb. Hind limb lameness or pelvic fracture can cause unilateral atrophy of the middle gluteal or gracilis muscles.<ref name=MEL/> Damage to the suprascapular nerve can lead to atrophy of the muscles of the shoulder (supraspinatus and infraspinatus). Neck muscle atrophy can be seen with cervical vertebral malformation (Wobbler's disease), articular facet osteoarthritis, and neurologic causes of lameness.<ref name=MEL/> Asymmetry in a limb can also occur due to swelling of a joint or soft tissue. For this reason, each leg should be compared to its partner.\n\nAfter a visual exam, the practitioner [[palpate]]s the horse, feeling for heat, swelling, and sensitivity to pressure indicating pain. Palpation is usually most thoroughly performed in the lower limb, but a comprehensive exam will include palpation of the back, pelvis, and neck. Joints should be palpated for pain, effusion of joint pouches, thickening of the joint capsule, and checked for range of motion. Major ligaments and tendons, such as the superficial and deep digital flexor tendons, inferior check ligament, suspensory ligament, and distal sesamoidean ligaments, should also be palpated along their entire length. Individual bones may be palpated if injury is suspected, such as a fracture, bucked shins in racehorses (cannon bones), or splints (splint bones).<ref name=MEL/>\n\nSpecialized manipulative tests can be used to help identify specific areas of pain:\n* The Churchill test: pressure is applied to the plantar surface of the head of the medial splint bone. A painful horse will flex and abduct the limb, indicating hock pain.<ref name=MEL/>\n* Peroneus tertius rupture: The hock is pulled into extension while the stifle is flexed. A positive test (the ability to extend the hock) indicates a ruptured peroneus tertius muscle.<ref name=MEL/>\n* Patella displacement: the patella is pushed laterally and proximally, to test for upward fixation of the patella.<ref name=MEL/>\n* Cruciate test: the examiner moves the tibia sharply caudally, to feel for movement away from the femur or [[crepitus]]. Excessive movement can indicate cruciate rupture.<ref name=MEL/>\n* Test for stifle collateral ligament damage: the stifle is held still, while the distal limb is abducted (to test for damage to the medial collateral ligament) or adducted (to test for lateral collateral ligament damage). Excessive movement by the distal limb relative to the stifle suggests rupture of the collateral ligament. Sprain of these ligaments can be evaluated by repeating this test multiple times, before trotting the horse off an looking for lameness.<ref name=MEL/>\n\n===Evaluation of the hoof===\nThe majority of lameness originates in the hoof. For this reason, the hoof is closely scrutinized in shape, balance, shoeing, wear pattern, and for the presence of cracks, and contracted or sheared heels.\n\n[[Image:Halfarabianwithhighheel.jpg|thumb|right|Chronic lameness often causes an upright hoof capsule.]]\nChronic lameness will change the shape of the hoof capsule, since the lame limb is not weighted as much as its partner, making the capsule more upright, narrow, with a higher heel on the lame limb and more flattened on the sound one.<ref name=MEL/> Hoof or horseshoe wear can indicate breakover and if the horse is dragging its toes. Change in shape of the hoof wall is also common in horses suffering from laminitis. \"Founder rings,\" or thickened concentric rings in the hoof wall, indicate a past episode of laminitis. Concavity of the dorsal (front) surface of the hoof can indicate chronic laminitis. The sole may become convex if the coffin bone begins to push through the bottom of the hoof.<ref>Lucas, Don (1963) \"Laminitis,\" Iowa State University Veterinarian: Vol. 26: Iss. 3, Article 7. \nAvailable at: http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/iowastate_veterinarian/vol26/iss3/7</ref>\n\nCorrect hoof balance allows for even distribution of forces through the leg and hoof. Poor hoof balance, due to conformational flaws or poor trimming, can cause lameness from musculoskeletal injury,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = A. M. | last2 = Seelig | first2 = T.

Long toes force the horse to pivot (break over) further forward over the toe. The toe acts as a lever arm, and its increased length makes it harder for the heels to rotate off the ground. This increases strain on the deep digital flexor tendon and the ligaments of the navicular bone.<ref name=MEL/>\n\n[[Image:Absces.JPG|thumb|right|An abscess has ruptured out of the coronary band of this horse.]]\nThe bottom of the hoof should also be examined. The shape of the sole, size of the frog, and shape of the bars can indicate overall health of the hoof. Holes in heel bulb usually indicate a hoof abscess that has ruptured.<ref name=MEL/> The horse's shoeing can also provide clues to the examiner. The application of corrective shoes or pads may indicate past problems requiring special shoeing. This can be especially helpful during the pre-purchase exam, when the lameness history of the horse may not be readily available.\n\nDigital pulse evaluation is important when addressing the hoof. An increased digital pulse often indicates that the lesion is in the foot, and are usually most significantly increased in horses with [[laminitis]]. The coronary band may also be palpated. Cool swelling can indicate coffin joint effusion, swelling with an increase in temperature can indicate laminitis, firm swelling can occur with [[ringbone]], and a localized swelling with pain can indicate an abscess.<ref name=MEL/>\n\nExaminers will also \"hoof test\" each foot by applying a metal instrument that squeezes the foot to test for deep pain. Diffuse sensitivity occurs with fracture or infection of the coffin bone, and laminitis. More localized sensitivity can be found with sole bruises, puncture wounds, hoof abscesses, and hot nails. Sensitivity over the middle third of the frog is consistent with navicular syndrome, but can also occur with sheared heels. To distinguish these two, the hoof testers may be applied over the heels, which will be sensitive in the case of any heel-related pain, such as sheared, contracted, or bruised heels.<ref name=MEL/> The hoof wall may also be percussed (struck with a hammer), which will produce a positive response in cases of hoof cracks that are causing the horse pain, laminitis, or a gravel (hoof abscess travelling up the hoof wall towards the coronary band).<ref name=MEL/>\n\n===Evaluation in motion===\n[[File:80 tarkastuksessa.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Horses are usually trotted on a straight line to evaluate lameness.]]\nThe horse is evaluated in motion, usually at the walk and trot, but occasionally also in the canter. The walk is often the best gait to evaluate foot placement.<ref name=MEL/> The trot is generally the best gait to localize the lameness to a particular leg, because it is a symmetrical gait where the front half of the horse and the back half move in unison.<ref name=Keegan/> The canter may also be used for lameness evaluation. Resistance to picking up the canter or to engage the hind end can suggest pain in the sacro-iliac joint, pelvis, or hind leg.\n\nLameness may be accentuated under certain conditions. Therefore, the moving examination is often performed both in a straight line and on a circle, and may be repeated on different footings. Hard footing tends to make joint and bone injury more apparent, while soft, deep footings tend to accentuate soft tissue injury. Circles may accentuate a lameness when the lame leg is on the inside or outside of the circle.<ref name=\"Dyson Stifle\"/><ref>Starke, Sandra D., et al. \"Vertical head and trunk movement adaptations of sound horses trotting in a circle on a hard surface.\" ''The Veterinary Journal'' 2012; 193(1): 73\u2013-80.</ref>\n\nAt times, it may be helpful to evaluate the horse under saddle, since the weight of the rider can accentuate lameness.<ref name=\"Dyson Stifle\"/> In cases of decreased performance, it can be useful to watch a horse performing certain discipline-specific movements, which may be the only time the rider notices a change in the horse's abilities.\n\nGait is evaluated for symmetry. This includes the overall fluidity of the horse's motion, length of stride, loading of a leg, how the hoof lands on the ground (flat, toe, or heel-first), range of motion of the joints, deviations in body position, and position of the head and neck.\n\nThe first evaluation of the horse is used to determine the severity of lameness and to help pinpoint which part of the body may be affected. The process of watching a horse move is repeated after each additional flexion test or nerve block to determine its effect on the animal.\n\n===Grading lameness===\nLameness is graded on a scale. This allows the practitioner to help quantify a lameness in order to determine relative severity, assess the degree of change after flexion tests or nerve blocks, and to determine the improvement of lameness over time once treatment has been implemented. The most commonly used scale in the United States is a 1\u2013-5 scale of the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP). Other scales are more commonly used outside of the United States, including a 1\u201310 scale in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dyson | first1 = S | year = 2011 | title = Can lameness be graded reliably? | url = | journal = Equine Veterinary Journal | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 379\u2013382 | doi = 10.1111/j.2042-3306.2011.00391 }}</ref>\n\n'''AAEP Lameness Grading Scale'''\n{{Unbulleted list|Grade 0: lameness is not perceptible under any circumstances|Grade 1: lameness is difficult to observe and not consistently apparent under any circumstances|Grade 2: the lameness is consistently apparent under certain circumstances (specific surfaces, on an incline, circling, under saddle, etc), but difficult to observe at a walk or trot on a straight line|Grade 3: the lameness is consistently apparent at the trot under all circumstances|Grade 4: the lameness is apparent at the walk|Grade 5: the horse is minimally or non-weight bearing on the limb, or unable to move}}\n\nNon-weight bearing lameness (grade 5) is most commonly the result of a hoof abscess. While very painful, most hoof abscesses are quite treatable and do not cause long-term lameness. However, fractures and septic synovial structures (such as an infected joint pouch or tendon sheath) can also cause non-weight bearing lameness, and require emergency evaluation and treatment by a veterinarian. Therefore, non-weight bearing lameness should be assessed by an equine professional in a timely manner, especially if it is associated with trauma, laceration, or recent joint injection.\n\n===Flexion tests===\n{{Main|Flexion test}}\n\nFlexion tests are a diagnostic tool involving the application of sustained pressure on a particular set of joints. The limb is forcibly flexed for between 30 seconds and 3 minutes,<ref name=\"Ramey AAEP\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ramey | first1 = DW | year = 1997 | title = Prospective Evaluation of Forelimb Flexion Tests in Practice: Clinical Response, Radiographic Correlations, and Predictive Value for Future Lameness | url = | journal = Proc. AAEP | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 116\u2013119 }}</ref> depending on the joint and practitioner preference, and the horse is immediately trotted off.  An increase in lameness following a flexion test suggests that those joints or surrounding soft tissue structures may be a source of pain for the horse. Flexion tests help narrow down the source of lameness to a certain part of the leg, but they are non-specific because they almost always affect more than one joint and because they also affect the soft tissue structures around the joint, not just the joint itself.<ref name=MEL/> Additionally, they must be interpreted carefully due to the risk of false negatives and false positives.\n\n===Regional limb anesthesia (nerve blocks)===\nNerve blocks involve injecting a small amount of local anesthetic around a nerve or into a [[synovial membrane|synovial structure]] (such as a joint or tendon sheath) in order to block the perception of pain in a specific area. After the substance is injected, it is given a few minutes to take effect. The block is then tested by pushing a blunt object, such as a ballpoint pen, into the area that is supposed to be desensitized. If the horse does not react to this pressure, the area is desensitized, and the horse is trotted to see if the lameness has improved. Improvement indicates that the cause of lameness was from a structure desensitized by the nerve block.\n\nNerve blocks are performed in a step-wise fashion, beginning at the most [[distal]] (lower) part of the limb and moving upward. This is due to the fact that blocking a nerve higher up will desensitize everything it innervates distal to the blocking location. For example, blocking the leg at the level of the fetlock will also block the entire foot, since the nerve fibers that innervate the foot are inhibited when they travel through the fetlock area. A positive result from this block will not be able to differentiate foot pain from pain in the pastern or fetlock region. More information may be gained from blocking the foot first, then the fetlock, since it allows for greater specificity in determining the cause of lameness.\n\nThe duration of the anesthetic varies depending on the substance used. Lidocaine is especially short acting, and is therefore usually not used for lameness evaluations. The longer-acting anesthetic [[mepivacaine]] is most-commonly used for nerve blocks,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bidwell | first1 = L. A. | last2 = Brown | first2 = K.

If the anesthetic migrates to the structure that is causing the horse pain, the horse will have a positive block, and the examiner will conclude that the lameness originates in an area that is not actually causing the horse discomfort. False results can also be secondary to practitioner error if the anesthetic is accidentally administered into a location that was unintended, such as a synovial structure rather than around a nerve. Additionally, individual horses have variation in their neural anatomy, and if atypical patterns are present, a given block may block an area unintended by the examiner, leading to false positives.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sack | first1 = WO | year = 1975 | title = Nerve distribution in the metacarpus and front digit of the horse | url = | journal = JAVMA | volume = 167 | issue = | pages = 298\u2013335 }}</ref> Joints present additional problems.

These modalities are best applied if the general location of lameness is known from flexion tests and nerve blocks. These methods are both non-invasive and relatively cheap.\n\nRadiographs (\"x-rays\") are made by photons, produced by a generator, that have hit a piece of x-ray film. This film is then exposed to produce an image. The photons that hit the film are actually those that have been reflected, rather than absorbed, by the animal's body. Different tissue types absorb photons to varying degrees, leading to differing levels of darkness ([[radiodensity]]) on the x-ray film. An anatomical structure is delineated by comparing its radiodensity those tissues surrounding it. Interpretation of a radiograph therefore requires the surrounding structures to have enough of a difference in radiodensity to allow it to stand out. While this is obvious in tissue such as bone, soft tissues of the leg do not stand out well on radiographs. Therefore, radiographs are best used to evaluate boney changes rather than soft tissue damage. One exception of this rule is the use of contrast, injected into synovial structures, which allows these structures to stand out on radiographs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lamb | first1 = CR | year = 1991 | title = Contrast radiography of equine joints, tendon sheaths, and draining tracts.

Different tissues absorb or reflect ultrasonic waves to different degrees, which may be picked up by the machine and turned into an image. Because ultrasound does not easily cross bone or air, it is best used for the evaluation of soft-tissue structures. It is therefore a complementary imaging modality to radiographs, and is most commonly used to look for injury to ligaments and tendons, and the navicular bursa, although muscle damage and arterial blood flow have also been evaluated with ultrasound in cases of lameness.<ref>Genovese RL, Rantanen NW, Hauser ML, Simpson BS. The Veterinary Clinics of North America. Equine Practice [1986, 2(1):145-226]</ref>  Ultrasound is especially useful for determining the size and shape of lesions within structures, allowing quantification of an injury.

The bone scan is often useful for lameness that can't be easily localized to one area, that affects multiple limbs, or lameness that is thought to originate in areas not easily imaged by other means, such as the vertebral column. Although it provides localization for lameness, it does not give a definitive diagnosis.<ref>Winter MD, Berry CR, Reese DJ. Nuclear scintigraphy in horses. Compend Contin Educ Vet. 2010 Dec; 32 (12):E5.</ref> The availability of this modality is more limited relative to radiographs and ultrasound, and usually requires referral to a secondary care facility. Additionally, the horse must stay for a short period of time until it is no longer radioactive.  It is relatively non-invasive, requiring an initial injection of the radioisotope, and sedation throughout the procedure.\n\nThe bone scan offers several advantages over traditional radiographs. In some cases, it may be more sensitive due to the fact that some lesions are only apparent on radiographs after they have become chronic. The bone scan allows imaging of the pelvis, vertebral column, and upper limbs, which are areas that are usually poorly imaged by radiographs on the adult horse, due to their size. It also allows some evaluation of soft tissue, which is generally not imaged well by radiographs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Steckel | first1 = RR | year = 1991 | title = The role of scintigraphy in the lameness evaluation.

A series of plain radiographs are taken in a spiral around the site of interest, and the individual 2-D radiographs are converted into a 3-D image by a computer. The image may be manipulated to view in different planes, such as cross-section, making it possible to see an injury from multiple perspectives and improving diagnostic capabilities when compared to plain radiographs. Like plain radiographs, CT is not as useful for soft tissue lesions when compared to boney lesions. However, CT requires general anesthesia, and is more costly and less available than plain radiographs, limiting its use in general practice.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Desbrosse | first1 = F.

Available magnet size restricts imaging to the level of the stifle or elbow, or below. MRI takes a significant amount of time acquire an image, which translates to long anesthesia times and therefore reduces the size of the area that may be imaged in a single session. The area thought to be associated with lameness must be placed in the MRI. MRI is therefore inappropriate for any lameness that can not be localized to a specific region of the limb. Additionally, MRI has limited availability and high cost compared to the other imaging modalities.\n\nHorses may undergo standing MRI, where the horse is sedated and imaged with a low-field magnet (0.27 Tesla), or it may be placed in a high-field magnet (1.5 or 3 Tesla) while under general anesthesia. Low-field magnets produce less resolution<ref>Mitchell RD, Edwards RB, Makkreel LD, Oliveira TD. \"Standing MRI Lesions Identified in Jumping and Dressage Horses With Lameness Isolated to the Foot.

AAEP'' 2006; Vol. 52; 422-426.</ref> and the subtle swaying of the standing horse leads to motion artifact (blurring of the image), especially in the case of the knee or hock, leading to reduced image quality. However, standing MRI tends to be cheaper, and it eliminates the risks of general anesthesia, such as further damage to the injured area or additional injury that may occur during anesthetic recovery.\n\n===Thermography ===\nThermography, or thermal imaging, measures the heat gradient of skin by detection of infrared radiation.

Mechanical lameness does not cause pain. Classic examples of mechanical lameness include upward fixation of the patella and fibrotic myopathy, but any type of adhesion (often secondary to scarring during healing post-injury) or fibrosis can cause mechanical lameness.\n* Upward fixation of the patella occurs when the normal locking mechanism of the stifle, which allows the horse to \"lock\" its hind legs into a fixed position so it may stand with minimal effort, engages at inappropriate times such as when the horse is walking. It results in an inability to flex the stifle, so the horse must walk with an extended hind leg.

Radial nerve paralysis will cause a dropped elbow and make it difficult to extend the affected limb. Suprascapular nerve damage will lead to atrophy of the main muscles of the shoulder (sweeny).

In general, it is harder to detect hind limb lameness when compared to lameness in a front limb when using visual cues.\n\n===Identifying a front limb lameness===\nThe classic sign of lameness in a front leg is a prominent \"head bob.\" Viewed from the side, the horse raises its head and neck when the lame leg hits the ground, which helps to unload the lame leg. This is sometimes remembered by the adage \"down on sound.\" A head bob is usually easy to see when one leg is lame, but can be subtle in very mild unilateral lameness, or in the case of bilateral front limb lameness.<ref name=MEL/> A horse may also try to reduce impact on a lame front leg by tensing of the muscles of the shoulder. In this case, it will stiffen the limb just before it hits the ground, a sign that may be noticed by an astute observer.<ref name=MEL/>\n\n===Identifying a hind limb lameness===\nEvaluation of hind limb lameness can be difficult. Generally, the viewer watches the hip, sacrum, gluteal muscles, or hemi-pelvis (pelvis of one side of the body) when examining lameness in the hind end. Examination should be performed both watching the horse from behind while trotting away from the examiner, and from the side as the horse passes.\n\nWhen watching from behind, the viewer often looks for a \"hip hike\" or \"pelvic hike.\" This occurs when the horse raises the pelvis on the lame side as it is bearing weight, trying to shift weight off of the painful leg in a manner similar to raising of the head in front limb lameness. This is a sudden, short upward motion of the hemi-pelvis or gluteal muscles. The hip of the lame leg does not always rise above the level of the hip of the sound leg, which can be confusing to those looking for a \"hip hike.\" Instead, it is an exaggerated upward movement that is watched for during weight bearing. Additionally, horses with a hind limb lameness will tend to reduce the degree of leg use. To do so, some horses will reduce the contraction time of the gluteals on the side of the lame leg, leading to a \"hip roll\" or \"hip dip\" and appearance that the hip drops a greater degree on the side of the lame leg.<ref name=MEL/>\n\nThese apparently contradictory statements (\"hip hike\" vs \"hip drop\" on the lame leg) can be explained by when the horse perceives pain during the stride. If the pain is perceived during the early stance phase of the stride, the horse will try to unweight the leg and produce a \"hip hike.\" If the pain is perceived during the pushoff phase of the stride, the horse does not push with as much force, subsequently reducing the height the pelvis is raised, and leading to a \"dipping\" motion during the swing phase of the stride as the horse brings the limb forward. In some cases, both a hip hike and a hip drop can be seen in the same horse.<ref name=Keegan>Keegan KG. Head Nods and Hip Hikes. Western Veterinary Conference 2013. {{cite web |url=http://www.wvc.org/images/session_notes_2013/2013_EQ21.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229010842/http://www.wvc.org/images/session_notes_2013/2013_EQ21.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-29 }}</ref> Some practitioners simply look for the side with the greater overall deviation, which occurs in the lame leg<ref name=\"MVM Online\"/><ref name=MEL/>\n\nAnother method to detecting hind limb lameness requires watching the pelvis from the side. The entire pelvis is evaluated, and its relative position vertically (relative to the ground) is compared at various points in the stride. The pelvis normally rises and falls with each step. Horses with pain during the early stance phase of the trot will not allow the pelvis to drop as much when the lame leg is weighted, trying to avoid extra weight on the painful leg. Subsequently, the pelvis will not fall as much downward when the lame leg is bearing weight as when the sound leg is bearing weight. When viewed from behind, this is seen as a \"hip hike.\" If the horse is more painful as it is pushing off a limb, it will not push off with as much force, and the pelvis will rise less on the lame side relative to the same point of the stride when the sound leg is on the ground. This is seen as the \"hip roll\" when viewed from behind.<ref name=Keegan/>\n\nOther signs that indicate hind limb lameness include \"plaiting\" with the hind feet, which can be seen in cases of sacro-iliac pain,<ref name=\"SI lesions\"/> carrying the hindquarters to one side or drifting in one direction,<ref name=MEL/><ref name=\"Dyson Stifle\">Dyson SJ.

One method is to look at the relative time a leg spends in the cranial (forward) phase of the stride. For a front leg, this is when the lower leg is in front of the horse, i.e. angled forward, while the caudal phase is when the leg is underneath the horse, i.e. angled backward. For a hind leg, the cranial phase occurs when the lower leg is under the body of the horse, and the caudal phase is when the limb is out behind the body of the horse.\n\nA normal horse with have a cranial phase and a caudal phase of equal length: the horse will bring the leg as far forward as it does backward. In a lame horse, the cranial phase will be shorter when compared to the caudal phase, so it appears to spend more time with the leg backward than it does forward. A shortened cranial phase is most commonly seen in cases of bilateral lameness, lameness of the upper limb (such as shoulder or hip pain), and osteoarthritis of the hocks.<ref name=MEL/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dyson | first1 = S | year = 1986 | title = Shoulder lameness in horses: An analysis of 58 suspected cases | url = | journal = Equine Veterinary Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = 29\u201336 | doi = 10.1111/j.2042-3306.1986.tb03531.x }}</ref><ref>Wright, I.M.

It is the first step to evaluate decreased performance in an equine athlete, even if the horse does not appear overtly lame, to rule out any pain-associated cause.\n\nLameness exams are also a key component of the [[equine prepurchase exam|pre-purchase examination]]. These examinations evaluate the horse to give the potential buyer information regarding present soundness of the horse. Veterinarians may comment on aspects that could inhibit the use of the horse for the buyer's intended activity, such as subclinical osteoarthritis or conformational defects. However, the veterinarian is not there to \"pass\" or \"fail\" a horse, but only to give their impression of the horse on that day.<ref name=MEL>{{cite book|last1=Baxter|first1=Gary|title=Manual of Equine Lameness|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-8138-1546-6}}</ref> Therefore, pre-purchase examinations make no guarantees of the future health or soundness of the horse. The pre-purchase exam may range in scope depending on the desire of the buyer, from a simple examination with hoof and flexion tests, to multiple radiographs, ultrasound, and advanced imaging techniques including MRI.\n\n===History===\nA detailed history is the first step of a lameness exam.  \n#Age: Foals are more likely to have infectious causes of lameness ([[septic arthritis]]). Horses just starting training may be lame due to a developmental orthopedic disease, such as osteochondrosis. Older animals are more likely to experience [[osteoarthritis]].<ref name=MEL/>  \n#Breed: Breed-specific diseases, such as [[hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (equine)|hyperkalemic periodic paralysis]] (HYPP), can be ruled out. Additionally, some breeds or types are more prone to certain types of lameness.\n#Discipline: Certain lamenesses are associated with certain uses. For example, racehorses are more likely to have fatigue-related injuries such as stress fractures and injury to the flexor tendons, while western show horses are more likely to suffer from navicular syndrome and English sport horses are more likely to have osteoarthritis or injury to the suspensory ligament.<ref name=MEL/>\n#Past history of lameness: An old injury may be re-injured. In the case of progressive disease, such as osteoarthritis, a horse will often experience recurrent lameness that must be managed. Shifting lameness may suggest a bilateral injury or infectious cause of lameness.\n#Duration and progression the lameness: Acute injury is more common with soft tissue injury. Chronic, progressive disease is more common in cases such as osteoarthritis and navicular disease. \n#Recent changes in management: such as turn-out, exercise level, diet, or shoeing.\n#Effect of exercise on degree of lameness.<ref name=MEL/>\n#Any treatment implemented, including rest.<ref name=MEL/>\n\n===Physical examination and palpation===\n[[Image:Zippo 09.JPG|thumb|upright|100px|Splints can be palpated on physical examination.]]\nOne of the first steps of the lameness examination is to evaluate the horse at rest. A good evaluation of [[equine conformation|conformation]], including overall body type, can help the practitioner determine the potential cause of lameness. Certain conformational defects can predispose a horse to injury, and knowledge of correct conformation can help narrow down possible causes of injury, especially when combined with the horse's history. The horse's stance is also evaluated. Frequently resting a particular leg, \"pointing\" a foot (holding a leg out in front of the body), or standing in an abnormal position can indicate compensation for an injury. Shifting of weight is normal in the hind legs, but frequent shifting of weight in the front legs, or placing both front feet in front of the body, can indicate bilateral forelimb lameness.<ref name=MEL/> Stifle pain sometimes causes a horse to stand with the stifles rotated out.<ref name=\"Dyson Stifle\"/> Hip and pelvic pain can produce a toe-out, stifle out, hock-in stance and that remains present at the walk.<ref name=MEL/>\n\nAsymmetry of the muscular structure, due to muscle atrophy, usually occurs on the side of the lame limb. Hind limb lameness or pelvic fracture can cause unilateral atrophy of the middle gluteal or gracilis muscles.<ref name=MEL/> Damage to the suprascapular nerve can lead to atrophy of the muscles of the shoulder (supraspinatus and infraspinatus). Neck muscle atrophy can be seen with cervical vertebral malformation (Wobbler's disease), articular facet osteoarthritis, and neurologic causes of lameness.<ref name=MEL/> Asymmetry in a limb can also occur due to swelling of a joint or soft tissue. For this reason, each leg should be compared to its partner.\n\nAfter a visual exam, the practitioner [[palpate]]s the horse, feeling for heat, swelling, and sensitivity to pressure indicating pain. Palpation is usually most thoroughly performed in the lower limb, but a comprehensive exam will include palpation of the back, pelvis, and neck. Joints should be palpated for pain, effusion of joint pouches, thickening of the joint capsule, and checked for range of motion. Major ligaments and tendons, such as the superficial and deep digital flexor tendons, inferior check ligament, suspensory ligament, and distal sesamoidean ligaments, should also be palpated along their entire length. Individual bones may be palpated if injury is suspected, such as a fracture, bucked shins in racehorses (cannon bones), or splints (splint bones).<ref name=MEL/>\n\nSpecialized manipulative tests can be used to help identify specific areas of pain:\n* The Churchill test: pressure is applied to the plantar surface of the head of the medial splint bone. A painful horse will flex and abduct the limb, indicating hock pain.<ref name=MEL/>\n* Peroneus tertius rupture: The hock is pulled into extension while the stifle is flexed. A positive test (the ability to extend the hock) indicates a ruptured peroneus tertius muscle.<ref name=MEL/>\n* Patella displacement: the patella is pushed laterally and proximally, to test for upward fixation of the patella.<ref name=MEL/>\n* Cruciate test: the examiner moves the tibia sharply caudally, to feel for movement away from the femur or [[crepitus]]. Excessive movement can indicate cruciate rupture.<ref name=MEL/>\n* Test for stifle collateral ligament damage: the stifle is held still, while the distal limb is abducted (to test for damage to the medial collateral ligament) or adducted (to test for lateral collateral ligament damage). Excessive movement by the distal limb relative to the stifle suggests rupture of the collateral ligament. Sprain of these ligaments can be evaluated by repeating this test multiple times, before trotting the horse off an looking for lameness.<ref name=MEL/>\n\n===Evaluation of the hoof===\nThe majority of lameness originates in the hoof. For this reason, the hoof is closely scrutinized in shape, balance, shoeing, wear pattern, and for the presence of cracks, and contracted or sheared heels.\n\n[[Image:Halfarabianwithhighheel.jpg|thumb|right|Chronic lameness often causes an upright hoof capsule.]]\nChronic lameness will change the shape of the hoof capsule, since the lame limb is not weighted as much as its partner, making the capsule more upright, narrow, with a higher heel on the lame limb and more flattened on the sound one.<ref name=MEL/> Hoof or horseshoe wear can indicate breakover and if the horse is dragging its toes. Change in shape of the hoof wall is also common in horses suffering from laminitis. \"Founder rings,\" or thickened concentric rings in the hoof wall, indicate a past episode of laminitis. Concavity of the dorsal (front) surface of the hoof can indicate chronic laminitis. The sole may become convex if the coffin bone begins to push through the bottom of the hoof.<ref>Lucas, Don (1963) \"Laminitis,\" Iowa State University Veterinarian: Vol. 26: Iss. 3, Article 7. \nAvailable at: http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/iowastate_veterinarian/vol26/iss3/7</ref>\n\nCorrect hoof balance allows for even distribution of forces through the leg and hoof. Poor hoof balance, due to conformational flaws or poor trimming, can cause lameness from musculoskeletal injury,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = A. M. | last2 = Seelig | first2 = T.

Long toes force the horse to pivot (break over) further forward over the toe. The toe acts as a lever arm, and its increased length makes it harder for the heels to rotate off the ground. This increases strain on the deep digital flexor tendon and the ligaments of the navicular bone.<ref name=MEL/>\n\n[[Image:Absces.JPG|thumb|right|An abscess has ruptured out of the coronary band of this horse.]]\nThe bottom of the hoof should also be examined. The shape of the sole, size of the frog, and shape of the bars can indicate overall health of the hoof. Holes in heel bulb usually indicate a hoof abscess that has ruptured.<ref name=MEL/> The horse's shoeing can also provide clues to the examiner. The application of corrective shoes or pads may indicate past problems requiring special shoeing. This can be especially helpful during the pre-purchase exam, when the lameness history of the horse may not be readily available.\n\nDigital pulse evaluation is important when addressing the hoof. An increased digital pulse often indicates that the lesion is in the foot, and are usually most significantly increased in horses with [[laminitis]]. The coronary band may also be palpated. Cool swelling can indicate coffin joint effusion, swelling with an increase in temperature can indicate laminitis, firm swelling can occur with [[ringbone]], and a localized swelling with pain can indicate an abscess.<ref name=MEL/>\n\nExaminers will also \"hoof test\" each foot by applying a metal instrument that squeezes the foot to test for deep pain. Diffuse sensitivity occurs with fracture or infection of the coffin bone, and laminitis. More localized sensitivity can be found with sole bruises, puncture wounds, hoof abscesses, and hot nails. Sensitivity over the middle third of the frog is consistent with navicular syndrome, but can also occur with sheared heels. To distinguish these two, the hoof testers may be applied over the heels, which will be sensitive in the case of any heel-related pain, such as sheared, contracted, or bruised heels.<ref name=MEL/> The hoof wall may also be percussed (struck with a hammer), which will produce a positive response in cases of hoof cracks that are causing the horse pain, laminitis, or a gravel (hoof abscess travelling up the hoof wall towards the coronary band).<ref name=MEL/>\n\n===Evaluation in motion===\n[[File:80 tarkastuksessa.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Horses are usually trotted on a straight line to evaluate lameness.]]\nThe horse is evaluated in motion, usually at the walk and trot, but occasionally also in the canter. The walk is often the best gait to evaluate foot placement.<ref name=MEL/> The trot is generally the best gait to localize the lameness to a particular leg, because it is a symmetrical gait where the front half of the horse and the back half move in unison.<ref name=Keegan/> The canter may also be used for lameness evaluation. Resistance to picking up the canter or to engage the hind end can suggest pain in the sacro-iliac joint, pelvis, or hind leg.\n\nLameness may be accentuated under certain conditions. Therefore, the moving examination is often performed both in a straight line and on a circle, and may be repeated on different footings. Hard footing tends to make joint and bone injury more apparent, while soft, deep footings tend to accentuate soft tissue injury. Circles may accentuate a lameness when the lame leg is on the inside or outside of the circle.<ref name=\"Dyson Stifle\"/><ref>Starke, Sandra D., et al. \"Vertical head and trunk movement adaptations of sound horses trotting in a circle on a hard surface.\" ''The Veterinary Journal'' 2012; 193(1): 73\u2013-80.</ref>\n\nAt times, it may be helpful to evaluate the horse under saddle, since the weight of the rider can accentuate lameness.<ref name=\"Dyson Stifle\"/> In cases of decreased performance, it can be useful to watch a horse performing certain discipline-specific movements, which may be the only time the rider notices a change in the horse's abilities.\n\nGait is evaluated for symmetry. This includes the overall fluidity of the horse's motion, length of stride, loading of a leg, how the hoof lands on the ground (flat, toe, or heel-first), range of motion of the joints, deviations in body position, and position of the head and neck.\n\nThe first evaluation of the horse is used to determine the severity of lameness and to help pinpoint which part of the body may be affected. The process of watching a horse move is repeated after each additional flexion test or nerve block to determine its effect on the animal.\n\n===Grading lameness===\nLameness is graded on a scale. This allows the practitioner to help quantify a lameness in order to determine relative severity, assess the degree of change after flexion tests or nerve blocks, and to determine the improvement of lameness over time once treatment has been implemented. The most commonly used scale in the United States is a 1\u2013-5 scale of the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP). Other scales are more commonly used outside of the United States, including a 1\u201310 scale in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dyson | first1 = S | year = 2011 | title = Can lameness be graded reliably? | url = | journal = Equine Veterinary Journal | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 379\u2013382 | doi = 10.1111/j.2042-3306.2011.00391 }}</ref>\n\n'''AAEP Lameness Grading Scale'''\n{{Unbulleted list|Grade 0: lameness is not perceptible under any circumstances|Grade 1: lameness is difficult to observe and not consistently apparent under any circumstances|Grade 2: the lameness is consistently apparent under certain circumstances (specific surfaces, on an incline, circling, under saddle, etc), but difficult to observe at a walk or trot on a straight line|Grade 3: the lameness is consistently apparent at the trot under all circumstances|Grade 4: the lameness is apparent at the walk|Grade 5: the horse is minimally or non-weight bearing on the limb, or unable to move}}\n\nNon-weight bearing lameness (grade 5) is most commonly the result of a hoof abscess. While very painful, most hoof abscesses are quite treatable and do not cause long-term lameness. However, fractures and septic synovial structures (such as an infected joint pouch or tendon sheath) can also cause non-weight bearing lameness, and require emergency evaluation and treatment by a veterinarian. Therefore, non-weight bearing lameness should be assessed by an equine professional in a timely manner, especially if it is associated with trauma, laceration, or recent joint injection.\n\n===Flexion tests===\n{{Main|Flexion test}}\n\nFlexion tests are a diagnostic tool involving the application of sustained pressure on a particular set of joints. The limb is forcibly flexed for between 30 seconds and 3 minutes,<ref name=\"Ramey AAEP\">Ramey, DW. \"Prospective Evaluation of Forelimb Flexion Tests in Practice: Clinical Response, Radiographic Correlations, and Predictive Value\nfor Future Lameness\".'' Proc. AAEP'', 1997; 43, 116-119.</ref> depending on the joint and practitioner preference, and the horse is immediately trotted off.  An increase in lameness following a flexion test suggests that those joints or surrounding soft tissue structures may be a source of pain for the horse. Flexion tests help narrow down the source of lameness to a certain part of the leg, but they are non-specific because they almost always affect more than one joint and because they also affect the soft tissue structures around the joint, not just the joint itself.<ref name=MEL/> Additionally, they must be interpreted carefully due to the risk of false negatives and false positives.\n\n===Regional limb anesthesia (nerve blocks)===\nNerve blocks involve injecting a small amount of local anesthetic around a nerve or into a [[synovial membrane|synovial structure]] (such as a joint or tendon sheath) in order to block the perception of pain in a specific area. After the substance is injected, it is given a few minutes to take effect. The block is then tested by pushing a blunt object, such as a ballpoint pen, into the area that is supposed to be desensitized. If the horse does not react to this pressure, the area is desensitized, and the horse is trotted to see if the lameness has improved. Improvement indicates that the cause of lameness was from a structure desensitized by the nerve block.\n\nNerve blocks are performed in a step-wise fashion, beginning at the most [[distal]] (lower) part of the limb and moving upward. This is due to the fact that blocking a nerve higher up will desensitize everything it innervates distal to the blocking location. For example, blocking the leg at the level of the fetlock will also block the entire foot, since the nerve fibers that innervate the foot are inhibited when they travel through the fetlock area. A positive result from this block will not be able to differentiate foot pain from pain in the pastern or fetlock region. More information may be gained from blocking the foot first, then the fetlock, since it allows for greater specificity in determining the cause of lameness.\n\nThe duration of the anesthetic varies depending on the substance used. Lidocaine is especially short acting, and is therefore usually not used for lameness evaluations. The longer-acting anesthetic [[mepivacaine]] is most-commonly used for nerve blocks,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bidwell | first1 = L. A. | last2 = Brown | first2 = K.

If the anesthetic migrates to the structure that is causing the horse pain, the horse will have a positive block, and the examiner will conclude that the lameness originates in an area that is not actually causing the horse discomfort. False results can also be secondary to practitioner error if the anesthetic is accidentally administered into a location that was unintended, such as a synovial structure rather than around a nerve. Additionally, individual horses have variation in their neural anatomy, and if atypical patterns are present, a given block may block an area unintended by the examiner, leading to false positives.<ref>Sack, WO. \"Nerve distribution in the metacarpus and front digit of the horse\".

Several systems are in use and under development for this purpose, both in research and clinical practice. Among these are the Lameness Locator system based on uniaxial accelerometers, the Equigate system based on six degrees of freedom inertial measurement units,<ref>Starke, S.D., Willems, E., May, S.

These modalities are best applied if the general location of lameness is known from flexion tests and nerve blocks. These methods are both non-invasive and relatively cheap.\n\nRadiographs (\"x-rays\") are made by photons, produced by a generator, that have hit a piece of x-ray film. This film is then exposed to produce an image. The photons that hit the film are actually those that have been reflected, rather than absorbed, by the animal's body. Different tissue types absorb photons to varying degrees, leading to differing levels of darkness ([[radiodensity]]) on the x-ray film. An anatomical structure is delineated by comparing its radiodensity those tissues surrounding it. Interpretation of a radiograph therefore requires the surrounding structures to have enough of a difference in radiodensity to allow it to stand out. While this is obvious in tissue such as bone, soft tissues of the leg do not stand out well on radiographs. Therefore, radiographs are best used to evaluate boney changes rather than soft tissue damage. One exception of this rule is the use of contrast, injected into synovial structures, which allows these structures to stand out on radiographs.<ref>Lamb CR. \"Contrast radiography of equine joints, tendon sheaths, and draining tracts.

Different tissues absorb or reflect ultrasonic waves to different degrees, which may be picked up by the machine and turned into an image. Because ultrasound does not easily cross bone or air, it is best used for the evaluation of soft-tissue structures. It is therefore a complementary imaging modality to radiographs, and is most commonly used to look for injury to ligaments and tendons, and the navicular bursa, although muscle damage and arterial blood flow have also been evaluated with ultrasound in cases of lameness.<ref>Genovese RL, Rantanen NW, Hauser ML, Simpson BS.

The bone scan is often useful for lameness that can't be easily localized to one area, that affects multiple limbs, or lameness that is thought to originate in areas not easily imaged by other means, such as the vertebral column. Although it provides localization for lameness, it does not give a definitive diagnosis.<ref>Winter MD, Berry CR, Reese DJ. Nuclear scintigraphy in horses. Compend Contin Educ Vet. 2010 Dec; 32 (12):E5.</ref> The availability of this modality is more limited relative to radiographs and ultrasound, and usually requires referral to a secondary care facility. Additionally, the horse must stay for a short period of time until it is no longer radioactive.  It is relatively non-invasive, requiring an initial injection of the radioisotope, and sedation throughout the procedure.\n\nThe bone scan offers several advantages over traditional radiographs. In some cases, it may be more sensitive due to the fact that some lesions are only apparent on radiographs after they have become chronic. The bone scan allows imaging of the pelvis, vertebral column, and upper limbs, which are areas that are usually poorly imaged by radiographs on the adult horse, due to their size. It also allows some evaluation of soft tissue, which is generally not imaged well by radiographs.<ref>Steckel RR. \"The role of scintigraphy in the lameness evaluation.

A series of plain radiographs are taken in a spiral around the site of interest, and the individual 2-D radiographs are converted into a 3-D image by a computer. The image may be manipulated to view in different planes, such as cross-section, making it possible to see an injury from multiple perspectives and improving diagnostic capabilities when compared to plain radiographs. Like plain radiographs, CT is not as useful for soft tissue lesions when compared to boney lesions. However, CT requires general anesthesia, and is more costly and less available than plain radiographs, limiting its use in general practice.<ref>Desbrosse, F. G., Vandeweerd, J.-M. E. F., Perrin, R.

Available magnet size restricts imaging to the level of the stifle or elbow, or below. MRI takes a significant amount of time acquire an image, which translates to long anesthesia times and therefore reduces the size of the area that may be imaged in a single session. The area thought to be associated with lameness must be placed in the MRI. MRI is therefore inappropriate for any lameness that can not be localized to a specific region of the limb. Additionally, MRI has limited availability and high cost compared to the other imaging modalities.\n\nHorses may undergo standing MRI, where the horse is sedated and imaged with a low-field magnet (0.27 Tesla), or it may be placed in a high-field magnet (1.5 or 3 Tesla) while under general anesthesia. Low-field magnets produce less resolution<ref>Mitchell RD, Edwards RB, Makkreel LD, Oliveira TD. \"Standing MRI Lesions Identified in Jumping and Dressage Horses With Lameness Isolated to the Foot. ''Proc. AAEP'' 2006; Vol. 52; 422-426.</ref> and the subtle swaying of the standing horse leads to motion artifact (blurring of the image), especially in the case of the knee or hock, leading to reduced image quality. However, standing MRI tends to be cheaper, and it eliminates the risks of general anesthesia, such as further damage to the injured area or additional injury that may occur during anesthetic recovery.\n\n===Thermography ===\nThermography, or thermal imaging, measures the heat gradient of skin by detection of infrared radiation. Because heat is a cardinal sign of inflammation, thermal imaging can be used to detect inflammation that may be the cause of lameness, and at times discover a subclinical injury.<ref>Eddy AL, Van Hoogmoed LM, Snyder JR. \"The Role of Thermography in the Management of Equine Lameness\". ''The Veterinary Journal''. 162(3): 172-181.</ref> When used, horses must be placed in an area free of sunlight exposure, drafts, or other sources of outside heat, and hair length should be uniform in the area imaged. Benefits include non-invasiveness and the potential for early identification<ref>{{Cite book|title=Equine thermography in practice|last=Soroko|first=Maria|last2=Davies Morel|first2=Mina C.G.|publisher=CABI|year=2016|isbn=9781780647876|location=Wallingford - Boston|pages=|lccn=2016935227|quote=|via=}}</ref> of injury, and detection of early contralateral limb injury in the case of orthopedic patients.<ref>Turner TA. \"Diagnostic thermography.

Both [[cytology]] and [[bacterial culture]] can be used to help identify the cause of infection. In adult horses, septic arthritis or tenosynovitis are most commonly seen secondary to joint injection, penetrating injury, or following surgery, and are often from [[Staphylococcus]] infection.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schneider | first1 = R.

(1996), Equine neonatal septicaemia: 24 cases. Australian Veterinary Journal, 73: 137\u2013140.</ref>\n\n===Arthroscopy===\nArthroscopy involves placing a small camera through a hole into a joint or other synovial structure. It requires general anesthesia, but allows thorough visualization of the synovial membrane and articular cartilage. Treatment may often be performed at the same time. Arthroscopy is most commonly used for chip fractures of the knee and fetlock joints, osteochondritis dessecans lesions, and proliferative synovitis.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McILWRAITH | first1 = C.

Asymmetry of motion can be measured using ISS attached to the horse's body. A computer application then quantifies lameness by measuring the asymmetry of movement between left and right sides of the body.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Baxter|first1=Gary|title=Adams & Stashak's Lameness in Horses|date=2011|publisher=Blackwell Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-8138-1549-7|pages=155\u2013156|edition=6th}}</ref> Some more sophisticated computer applications are able to determine the limb or limbs involved and the point in the stride cycle that the horse is differentially unloading the limb.\n\n==Treatment==\n{{Main|Treatment of equine lameness}}\n\nAppropriate treatment for lameness depends on the condition diagnosed, but at a minimum it usually includes rest or decreased activity and anti-inflammatory medications. Other treatment options, such as corrective shoeing, joint injections, and regenerative therapies, are pursued based on the cause of lameness and the financial limits of the owner. Consultation with a [[veterinarian]] is generally recommended, even for mild cases, as some types of lameness may worsen if not properly diagnosed and treated.\n\n==Horseman\u2019s terms for lameness or blemishes==\nVarious horseman's terms have evolved over the years to describe common lamenesses or blemishes (defects that do not cause lameness) in horses.\n\n*[[Bog spavin]]: excessive synovial fluid in the tarsocrural joint, which leads to a large, soft, cool distention on the dorsal surface of the hock.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = O'Meara | first1 = B | year = 2012 | title = Bog spavin: recognizing the problem is the first step toward recovery | url = | journal = Veterinary Record | volume = 170 | issue = | pages = 284\u2013285 }}</ref>\n*[[Bone spavin]]: osteoarthritis of the distal hock joints, which produces lameness and is sometimes seen as a visible, hard swelling on the inside of the hock joint.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gough | first1 = M.

Considered a lameness when acute, and a blemish once healed, although the tendon is at greater risk for re-injury.\n*Bucked shins: pain, heat, and swelling over the dorsal surface of the cannon bone most commonly seen in racehorses. This complex disease process, called \"dorsal metacarpal disease,\" involves inflammation of the [[periosteum]], subperiosteal hematoma, and microfractures to the cortex of the underlying bone.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Plevin | first1 = S. | last2 = McLellan | first2 = J. | year = 2014 | title = Does periosteal scraping of the third metacarpal bone reduce the incidence of 'bucked shins' in young Thoroughbred racehorses? | url = | journal = Equine Veterinary Journal | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 560\u2013566 }}</ref> \n[[Image:Piephacke.jpg|thumb|right|Capped hocks.]]\n*Capped joint: Inflammation leading to the development of a \"false\" or acquired bursa over the point of the elbow (capped elbow, also known as a \"shoe boil\"), point of the hock (capped hock), or knee (capped knee, or carpal hygroma) which causes an obvious swelling in the area.<ref name=MEL/> These are generally considered blemishes. \n*[[Curb (horse)|Curb]]: a thickening or bowing on the caudal surface of the calcaneous. Classically associated with damage to the long plantar tarsal ligament of the hock,<ref name=MEL/> it is actually most commonly due to injury to the superficial digital flexor tendon, but may also involve the deep digital flexor tendon, or the surrounding soft tissue structures.<ref>Ross M, Genovese R, Reef V. Curb: A Collection of Plantar Tarsal Soft Tissue Injuries. Proc. ''AAEP, 2002, Vol. 48; 337-342.</ref> \n*Founder ([[laminitis]]): a very painful condition resulting from the inflammation of the laminae within the hoof, leading to rotation of the coffin bone.\n*[[Navicular disease]] or navicular syndrome: a catch-all phrase used to describe pain in the palmar hoof which was originally attributed to damage to the navicular bone. MRI has since shown that navicular syndrome may be caused by damage to any of the structures within the hoof, including the navicular bone, the navicular bursa, the coffin joint, the deep digital flexor tendon, and various ligamentous supportive structures.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dyson | first1 = S. | last2 = Murray | first2 = R. | last3 = Schramme | first3 = M. | last4 = Blunden | first4 = T. | year = 2011 | title = Current concepts of navicular disease | url = | journal = Equine Veterinary Education | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 27\u201339 }}</ref> \n*[[Osselet]]s: swelling on the front surface of the fetlock joints of the front legs, caused by traumatic arthritis of the fetlock joints.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Briggs|first1=Karen|title=Osselets (Traumatic Arthritis of the Fetlock)|url=http://www.thehorse.com/articles/10119/osselets-traumatic-arthritis-of-the-fetlock|website=TheHorse.com|accessdate=2017-12-29|language=en|date=1 September 2000}}</ref>\n*[[Ringbone]]: boney proliferation around the pastern. May be articular (osteoarthritis) or non-articular. The articular forms can affect the pastern or coffin joints, and can cause lameness.\n*Shoe boil: see \"capped joint\"\n*[[Sidebone]]: ossification of the collateral cartilages of the hoof secondary to chronic concussion, may be palpated on just above the coronary band on either side of the hoof. Rarely causes lameness, therefore considered a blemish.<ref name=MEL/>\n*[[Splints]]: bony enlargements in the area of the splint bone, most commonly on the inside of the front leg, but sometimes on the outside of the front leg or on a hind leg. They are caused by trauma to the split bone itself or the ligament between the splint bone and cannon bone. Acutely, there may be no visible swelling but the horse will be painful on palpation, and lame. Once healed, the boney swelling is cool to the touch and considered a blemish.<ref name=MEL/>\n*[[Stocking up]]: Edema (fluid) retained in the lower legs due to reduced lymphatic drainage, often because the horse is sedentary for long periods (such as when stalled) but occasionally due to pathology. It is cool to the touch, and usually decreases or resolves with exercise. It is considered a blemish.\n*Sweeney (shoulder sweeny): a loss of muscle of the shoulder. It is due to atrophy of the supraspinatous and infraspinatus muscles, secondary to damage to the suprascapular nerve, which innervates these muscles.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Carmona | first1 = J | last2 = Lopez | first2 = C | year = | title = Autologous Platelet Concentrates as a Treatment for Shoulder Injury in a Horse | url = | journal = J.

It is proximal to the tarsocrural joint, which helps distinguish it from bog spavin.<ref name=MEL/>\n*[[Windpuffs]] (wind galls): cool, soft effusions in the area of the fetlock joint. May be \"articular windgalls,\" which are the result of excessive synovial fluid in the fetlock joint capsule and located on the inside and outside of the fetlock, just behind the bones of the joint. Swelling towards the back of the joint are \"tendonous windgalls,\" and are the result of effusion in the deep digital flexor tendon sheath. Windgalls are considered blemishes.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Equine conformation]]\n* [[Skeletal system of the horse]]\n* [[Equine anatomy]]\n* [[Horse hoof]]\n* [[Horse care]]\n* [[Flexion test]]\n* [[Equine prepurchase exam]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://recoveryeq.com/vet/laminitis-and-founder-in-horses Laminitis information]\n* [http://horsemanshop.com/legailments.html Various leg ailments]\n\n[[Category:Horse management]]\n[[Category:Horse anatomy]]\n[[Category:Horse diseases]]\n[[Category:Equine injury and lameness]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:, templated 10 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lameness_(equine)"}
