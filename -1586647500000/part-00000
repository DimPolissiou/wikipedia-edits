Jahangir soon after had to fend off his own son, Prince [[Khusrau Mirza]], when the latter attempted to claim the throne based on Akbar's will to become his next heirs. Khusrau Mirza was defeated in 1606 and confined in the fort of [[Agra]].

Jahangir named her Shah Begum and she gave birth to Khusrau Mirza. Thereafter, Salim married, in quick succession, a number of accomplished girls from the aristocratic Mughal and Rajput families. One of his early favourite wives was a Rajput Princess, Jagat Gosain Begum. Jahangir named her [[Taj Bibi Bilqis Makani]] and she gave birth to Prince Khurram, the future Shah Jahan, who was Jahangir's successor to the throne.\n\nOn 7 July, 1586 he married a daughter of Raja Rai Singh, Maharaja of [[Bikaner]]. In July 1586, he married Malika Shikar Begum, daughter of Sultan Abu Said Khan Jagatai, Sultan of Kashghar. In 1586, he married [[Sahib-i-Jamal Begum]], daughter of Khwaja Hassan of Herat, a cousin of Zain Khan Koka. In 1587, he married Malika Jahan Begum, daughter of Bhim Singh, Maharaja of Jaisalmer. He also married the daughter of Raja Darya Malbhas. In October 1590, he married Zohra Begum, daughter of Mirza Sanjar Hazara. In 1591, he married Karamnasi Begum, daughter of Raja Kesho Das Rathore of Mertia. On 11 January 1592, he married Kanwal Rani, daughter of Ali Sher Khan, by his wife, Gul Khatun. In October 1592, he married a daughter of Husain Chak of Kashmir. In January/March 1593, he married Nur un-nisa Begum, daughter of Ibrahim Husain Mirza, by his wife, Gulrukh Begum, daughter of [[Kamran Mirza]]. In September 1593, he married a daughter of Ali Khan Faruqi, Raja of Khandesh. He also married a daughter of Abdullah Khan Baluch. On 28 June 1596, he married Khas Mahal Begum, daughter of Zain Khan Koka, Subadar of Kabul and Lahore. In 1608, he married Saliha Banu Begum, daughter of Qasim Khan, a senior member of the Imperial Household. On 17 June 1608, he married Koka Kumari Begum, eldest daughter of Jagat Singh, Yuvraj of Amber.\n\nJahangir married the extremely beautiful and intelligent Mehr-un-Nisaa (better known by her subsequent title of [[Nur Jahan]]) on 25 May 1611. She was the widow of [[Sher Afgan]]. Mehr-un-Nisaa became his indisputable chief consort and favourite wife immediately after their marriage. She was witty, intelligent and beautiful, which was what attracted Jahangir to her. Before being awarded the title of Nur Jahan ('Light of the World'), she was called Nur Mahal ('Light of the Palace'). Her abilities are said to range from fashion designing to hunting. There is also a myth that she had once killed four tigers with six bullets.\n\n=== Nur Jahan ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n[[File:Noorjahan & Jahangir.jpg|thumb|[[Nur Jahan]] and Jahangir]]\n\nMehr-Un-Nisa, or [[Nur Jahan]], occupies an important place in the history of Jahangir. She was the widow of a rebel officer, Sher Afgan, whose actual name was Ali Quli Beg Ist'ajlu. He had earned the title \"Sher Afgan\" (Tiger tosser) from Emperor Akbar after throwing off a tiger that had leaped to attack Akbar on the top of an elephant in a royal hunt at Bengal and then stabbing the fallen tiger to death. Akbar was greatly affected by the bravery of the young Turkish bodyguard accompanying him and awarded him the captaincy of the Imperial Guard at [[Burdwan]], [[Bengal]]. Sher Afgan had killed in rebellion (after having learned of Jahangir's orders to have him slain to possess his beautiful wife Mehr Un Nisaa as Jahangir yearned for her much earlier than her wedding to Sher Afgan), the governor of [[Bengal]] [[Qutubuddin Koka]] who was instructed secretly by Jahangir in his quest and who also was the emperor's foster brother and Sheikh [[Salim Chishti]]'s grandson and consequently had been slain by the guards of the Governor. The widowed Mehr-Un-Nisaa was brought to Agra along with her nine-year-old daughter and placed in\u2014or refused to be placed in\u2014the Royal harem in 1607. Jahangir married her in 1611 and gave her the title of Nur Jahan or \"Light of the World\". It was rumoured that Jahangir had a hand in the death of her first husband Sher Afghan, albeit there is no recorded evidence to prove that he was guilty of that crime; in fact most travellers' reports say that he met her after Sher Afgan's death. (See Ellison Banks Findly's scholarly biography for a full discussion.)\n\n[[File:Silver rupee coin of Jahangir, Ahmedabad mint.jpg|thumb|left|Heavy rupee of Jahangir]]\n\nThe loss of Kandahar was due to Prince Khurram's refusal to obey her orders. When the Persians besieged Kandahar, Nur Jahan was at the helm of affairs. She ordered Prince Khurram to march for Kandahar, but the latter refused to do so. There is no doubt that the refusal of the prince was due to her behaviour towards him, as she was favouring her son-in-law, Shahryar, at the expense of Khurram. Khurram suspected that in his absence, Shahryar might be given promotion and that he might die on the battlefield. This fear forced Khurram to rebel against his father rather than fight against the [[Safavid dynasty|Persians]], and thereby Kandahar was lost to the Persians. Nur Jahan struck coins in her own name during the last years of Jahangir's reign when he was taken ill.\n\nUnder Jahangir, the empire continued to be a war state attuned to conquest and expansion. Jahangir's most irksome foe was the Rana of Mewar, Amar Singh, who finally surrendered in 1613 to Khurram's forces. In the northeast, the Mughals clashed with the Ahoms of Assam, whose guerilla tactics gave the Mughals a hard time. In Northern India, Jahangir's forces under Khurram defeated their other principal adversary, the Raja of Kangra, in 1615; in the Deccan, his victories further consolidated the empire. But in 1620, Jahangir fell sick, and so ensued the familiar quest for power. Nur Jahan married her daughter to Shahryar, Jahangir's youngest son from his other queen, in the hope of having a living male heir to the throne when Jahangir died.\n\n== Conquests ==\n\nIn the year 1594, Jahangir was dispatched by his father, the Emperor [[Akbar]], alongside [[Abu'l-Hasan Asaf Khan]], also known as Mirza Jafar Beg son of [[Mirza Ghiyas Beg|Mirza Ghiyas Beg Isfahani]] and brother of [[Nur Jahan]], and [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]], to defeat the renegade [[Vir Singh Deo]] of [[Bundela]] and capture the city of [[Orchha]], which was considered the centre of the revolt. Jahangir arrived with a force of 12,000 after many ferocious encounters and finally subdued the Bundela and ordered Vir Singh Deo to surrender. After tremendous casualties and the start of negotiations between the two, Vir Singh Deo handed over 5000 Bundela infantry and 1000 cavalry, but he feared Mughal retaliation and remained a fugitive until his death. The victorious Jahangir, at 26 years of age, ordered the completion of the [[Jahangir Mahal]] a famous Mughal citadel in Orchha to commemorate and honour his victory.\n\n[[File:Jahangir hunting with a falcon..jpg|thumb|left|Jahangir with falcon on horseback]]\n\nJahangir then gathered his forces under the command of Ali Kuli Khan and fought Lakshmi Narayan of [[Koch Bihar]]. Lakshmi Narayan then accepted the Mughals as his suzerains and was given the title ''Nazir'', later establishing a garrison at Atharokotha.\n\nIn 1613,<ref>{{cite book |author=Sekhara Bandyopadhyaya |year=2004 |title=From Plassey to Partition: A History of Modern India |publisher=Orient Blackswan |page=37 |isbn=978-81-250-2596-2}}</ref> the Portuguese seized the Mughal ship ''Rahimi'', which had set out from [[Surat]] on its way with a large cargo of 100,000 rupees and Pilgrims, who were on their way to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] in order to attend the annual [[Hajj]]. The ''Rahimi'' was owned by [[Mariam-uz-Zamani]], mother of Jahangir and Akbar's Rajput wife. She was referred to as Queen mother of [[Hindustan]] during his reign. ''Rahimi'' was the largest Indian ship sailing in the [[Red Sea]] and was known to the Europeans as the \"great pilgrimage ship\". When the Portuguese officially refused to return the ship and the passengers, the outcry at the Mughal court was unusually severe. The outrage was compounded by the fact that the owner and the patron of the ship was none other than the revered mother of the current emperor. Jahangir himself was outraged and ordered the seizure of the Portuguese town Daman. He ordered the apprehension of all Portuguese within the Mughal Empire; he further confiscated churches that belonged to the [[Jesuit]]s. This episode is considered to be an example of the struggle for wealth that would later ensue and lead to colonisation of the Indian sub-continent.\n\nJahangir was responsible for ending a century long struggle with the state of [[Mewar]]. The campaign against the [[Rajput]]s was pushed so extensively that they were made to submit with great loss of life and property.\n\nJahangir posted [[Islam Khan I]] to subdue [[Musa Khan (Bengal Ruler)|Musa Khan]], an Afghan rebel in Bengal, in 1608. Jahangir also thought of capturing [[Kangra Fort]], which Akbar had failed to do in 1615. Consequently, a siege was laid and the fort was taken in 1620, which \"resulted in the submission of the Raja of Chamba who was the greatest of all the rajas in the region.\" The district of Kistwar, in the state of Kashmir, was also conquered.\n\n== Death ==\n[[File:Jehangir Tomb3.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Tomb of Jahangir]] in Shahdara, [[Lahore]]]]\n\nJahangir was trying to restore his health by visiting Kashmir and Kabul.

The body was then conveyed by palanquin to [[Lahore]] and was buried in [[Shahdara Bagh]], a suburb of that city. The [[Tomb of Jahangir|elegant mausoleum]] is today a popular tourist attraction site.\n\nJahangir was succeeded by his third son, Prince Khurram, who took the regnal name [[Shah Jahan]].\n\n== Religion ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n\nSir [[Thomas Roe]] was England's first ambassador to the Mughal court. Relations with England turned tense in 1617 when Roe warned Jahangir that if the young and charismatic Prince Shah Jahan, newly instated as the [[Subedar]] of [[Gujarat]], turned the English out of the province, ''\"then he must expect we would do our justice upon the seas\"''. Shah Jahan chose to seal an official [[Firman]] allowing the English to trade in Gujarat in the year 1618.\n\n[[File:Portrait of Emperor Jahangir Praying.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Mughal Emperor Jahangir's invocation of a [[Dua]] prayer]]\n\nMany contemporary chroniclers were not sure how to describe Jahangir's personal belief structure. Roe labelled him an [[atheist]], and although most others shied away from that term, they did not feel as though they could call him an orthodox [[Sunni]]. Roe believed Jahangir's religion to be of his own making, \"for he envies [the Prophet] Mohammed, and wisely sees no reason why he should not bee as great a prophet as he and therefore professed himself so... he hath found many disciples that flatter or follow him.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} At this time, one of those disciples happened to be the current English ambassador, though his initiation into Jahangir's inner circle was devoid of religious significance for Roe, as he did not understand the full extent of what he was doing. Jahangir hung \"a picture of him self set in gold hanging at a wire gold chain\" round Roe's neck. Roe thought it \"an especial favour, for that all the great men that wear the King's image (which none may do but to whom it is given) receive no other than a medal of gold as big as six pence.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nHad Roe intentionally converted, it would have caused quite a scandal in London. But since there was no intent, there was no resultant problem. Such disciples were an elite group of imperial servants, with one of them being promoted to Chief Justice. However, it is not clear that any of those who became disciples renounced their previous religion, so it is probable to see this as a way in which the emperor strengthened the bond between himself and his nobles. Despite Roe's somewhat casual use of the term 'atheist', he could not quite put his finger on Jahangir's real beliefs. Roe lamented that the emperor was either \"the most impossible man in the world to be converted, or the most easy; for he loves to hear, and hath so little religion yet, that he can well abide to have any derided.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[File:QUR'AN 2981b.jpg|thumb|left|A well-decorated manuscript of the [[Quran]], made during the reign of the [[Mughal Emperor]] Jahangir]]\n\nThis should not imply that the multi-confessional state appealed to all, or that all [[Muslims]] were happy with the situation in India. In a book written on statecraft for Jahangir, the author advised him to direct \"all his energies to understanding the counsel of the sages and to comprehending the intimations of the 'ulama.\" At the start of his regime many staunch Sunnis were hopeful, because he seemed less tolerant of other faiths than his father had been. At the time of his accession and the elimination of Abu'l Fazl, his father's chief minister and the architect of his eclectic religious stance, a powerful group of orthodox noblemen had gained increased power in the Mughal court. Jahangir did not always regard Hindu customs and rituals benevolently. On visiting a Hindu temple, he found a statue of a man with a pig's head (more than likely a boar's head, a representation of [[Varaha]]), one of the idols in the Hindu religion and he \"ordered them to break that hideous form and throw it in the tank.\" If the [[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri|Tuzuk]] is reliable on this subject (and there is no reason to suspect that it is not), then this was an isolated case.\n\nJ.F. Richards argues that \"Jahangir seems to have been persistently hostile to popularly venerated religious figures\", which is debatable. A Muslim saint, Mujadid Alif Sani Imam e Rabbani Sheikh Ahmed Sirhindi Al-Farooqi, who had gained a large number of followers through his spiritual preaching, was imprisoned in Gwalior Fort.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[File:Jahangir & Abbas I.jpg|thumb|A manuscript depicting the [[Mughal Emperor]] Jahangir and the [[Safavid]] [[Shah]] [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]], and the qualities of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]-[[Safavid]] relations.]]\n\nMost notorious was [[Guru Arjan Dev#Martyrdom|the execution]] of the Sikh [[Guru Arjan Dev]], whom Jahangir had had killed in prison.

One of his court historians states, \u201cOne day at Ahmadabad it was reported that many of the infidel and superstitious sect of the Seoras [Jains] of Gujarat had made several very great and splendid temples, and having placed in them their false gods, had managed to secure a large degree of respect for themselves and that the women who went for worship in those temples were polluted by them and other people. The Emperor Jahangir ordered them banished from the country, and their temples to be demolished.\u201d<ref>Shourie et al., Hindu Temples, 272.</ref>\n\nIn another story narrated by Jahangir himself in his memoir, Jahangir visited Pushkar and was shocked to find a temple of a boar like deity. He was quite taken-aback. \"The worthless religion of the Hindus is this,\" he claimed and ordered his men to destroy the idol. He also heard about a jogi doing mysterious things and he ordered his men to evict him and have the place destroyed.<ref>Shourie et al., Hindu Temples, 266.</ref><ref>Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri, translated into English by Alexander Rogers, first published 1909-1914, New Delhi Reprint, 1978, Vol. I, pp. 254-55</ref>\n\nMuqarrab Khan sent to Jahangir \"a European curtain (tapestry) the like of which in beauty no other work of the Frank [European] painters has ever been seen.\" One of his audience halls was \"adorned with European screens.\" Christian themes attracted Jahangir, and even merited a mention in the Tuzuk. One of his slaves gave him a piece of ivory into which had been carved four scenes. In the last scene \"there is a tree, below which the figure of the revered (hazrat) Jesus is shown. One person has placed his head at Jesus' feet, and an old man is conversing with Jesus and four others are standing by.\" Though Jahangir believed it to be the work of the slave who presented it to him, Sayyid Ahmad and Henry Beveridge suggest that it was of European origin and possibly showed the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]]. Wherever it came from, and whatever it represented, it was clear that a European style had come to influence Mughal art, otherwise the slave would not have claimed it as his own design, nor would he have been believed by Jahangir.\n\n== Art ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n\nJahangir was fascinated with art and architecture. In his autobiography, the [[Jahangir-nama|Jahangirnama]], Jahangir recorded events that occurred during his reign, descriptions of flora and fauna that he encountered, and other aspects of daily life, and commissioned court painters such as [[Ustad Mansur]] to paint detailed pieces that would accompany his vivid prose.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cleveland Beach|first=Milo|title=Mughal and Rajput Painting|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=90}}</ref> For example, in 1619, he put pen to paper in awe of a royal falcon delivered to his court from the ruler of Iran: \u201cWhat can I write of the beauty of this bird\u2019s color? It had black markings, and every feather on its wings, back, and sides was extremely beautiful,\u201d and then recorded his command that Ustad Mansur paint a portrait of it after it perished.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jahangir|first=|title=The Jahangirnama: Memoirs of Jahangir, Emperor of India|publisher=Freer Gallery of Art, Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Association with Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=314|translator-last=Thackston|translator-first=W.M.}}</ref> Jahangir bound and displayed much of the art that he commissioned in elaborate albums of hundreds of images, sometimes organized around a theme such as zoology.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cleveland Beach|first=Milo|title=Mughal and Rajput Painting|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=82}}</ref>  \n\nJahangir himself was far from modest in his autobiography when he stated his prowess at being able to determine the artist of any portrait by simply looking at a painting. As he said: {{quote|text=...my liking for painting and my practice in judging it have arrived at such point when any work is brought before me, either of deceased artists or of those of the present day, without the names being told me, I say on the spur of the moment that is the work of such and such a man. And if there be a picture containing many portraits and each face is the work of a different master, I can discover which face is the work of each of them. If any other person has put in the eye and eyebrow of a face, I can perceive whose work the original face is and who has painted the eye and eyebrow.}}\n\n[[File:Jahangirs huqqa close national museum india.JPG|thumb|Jahangir's Jade ''[[hookah]]'', [[National Museum, New Delhi]]]]\n\nJahangir took his connoisseurship of art very seriously. He also preserved paintings from Emperor Akbar's period. An excellent example of this is the painting done by [[Ustad Mansur]] of Musician [[Naubat Khan]], son in law of legendary [[Tansen]]. In addition to their aesthetic qualities, paintings created under his reign were closely catalogued, dated and even signed, providing scholars with fairly accurate ideas as to when and in what context many of the pieces were created. \n\nIn the foreword to [[Wheeler Thackston|W. M. Thackston]]\u2019s translation of the Jahangirnama, [[Milo C. Beach|Milo Cleveland Beach]] explains that Jahangir ruled during a time of considerably stable political control, and had the opportunity to order artists to create art to accompany his memoirs that were \u201cin response to the emperor\u2019s current enthusiasms\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jahangir|first=|title=The Jahangirnama: Memoirs of Jahangir, Emperor of India|publisher=Freer Gallery of Art, Arthur M.

At times, he would have artists travel with him for this purpose; when Jahangir was in Rahimabad, he had his painters on hand to capture the appearance of a specific tiger that he shot and killed, because he found it to be particularly beautiful.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Verma|first=Som Prakash|title=Mughal Painter of Flora and Fauna: Ust\u0101d Man\u1e63\u016br|publisher=Abhinav Publications|year=1999|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=25}}</ref>\n\nThe Jesuits had brought with them various books, engravings, and paintings and, when they saw the delight Akbar held for them, sent for more and more of the same to be given to the Mughals. They felt the Mughals were on the \"verge of conversion\", a notion which proved to be very false. Instead, both Akbar and Jahangir studied this artwork very closely and replicated and adapted it, adopting much of the early iconographic features and later the pictorial realism for which [[Renaissance]] art was known. Jahangir was notable for his pride in the ability of his court painters. A classic example of this is described in [[Sir Thomas Roe]]'s diaries, in which the Emperor had his painters copy a European miniature several times creating a total of five miniatures. Jahangir then challenged Roe to pick out the original from the copies, a feat Sir Thomas Roe could not do, to the delight of Jahangir.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nJahangir was also revolutionary in his adaptation of European styles. A collection at the [[British Museum]] in London contains seventy-four drawings of Indian portraits dating from the time of Jahangir, including a portrait of the emperor himself. These portraits are a unique example of art during Jahangir's reign because faces were not drawn in full, including the shoulders as well as the head as these drawings are.\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nJahangir is widely considered to have been a weak and incapable ruler.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lach |first1=Donald F. |last2=Kley |first2=Edwin J.

Jahangir soon after had to fend off his own son, Prince [[Khusrau Mirza]], when the latter attempted to claim the throne based on Akbar's will to become his next heirs. Khusrau Mirza was defeated in 1606 and confined in the fort of [[Agra]].

Jahangir named her Shah Begum and she gave birth to Khusrau Mirza. Thereafter, Salim married, in quick succession, a number of accomplished girls from the aristocratic Mughal and Rajput families. One of his early favourite wives was a Rajput Princess, Jagat Gosain Begum. Jahangir named her [[Taj Bibi Bilqis Makani]] and she gave birth to Prince Khurram, the future Shah Jahan, who was Jahangir's successor to the throne.\n\nOn 7 July, 1586 he married a daughter of Raja Rai Singh, Maharaja of [[Bikaner]]. In July 1586, he married Malika Shikar Begum, daughter of Sultan Abu Said Khan Jagatai, Sultan of Kashghar. In 1586, he married [[Sahib-i-Jamal Begum]], daughter of Khwaja Hassan of Herat, a cousin of Zain Khan Koka. In 1587, he married Malika Jahan Begum, daughter of Bhim Singh, Maharaja of Jaisalmer. He also married the daughter of Raja Darya Malbhas. In October 1590, he married Zohra Begum, daughter of Mirza Sanjar Hazara. In 1591, he married Karamnasi Begum, daughter of Raja Kesho Das Rathore of Mertia. On 11 January 1592, he married Kanwal Rani, daughter of Ali Sher Khan, by his wife, Gul Khatun. In October 1592, he married a daughter of Husain Chak of Kashmir. In January/March 1593, he married Nur un-nisa Begum, daughter of Ibrahim Husain Mirza, by his wife, Gulrukh Begum, daughter of [[Kamran Mirza]]. In September 1593, he married a daughter of Ali Khan Faruqi, Raja of Khandesh. He also married a daughter of Abdullah Khan Baluch. On 28 June 1596, he married Khas Mahal Begum, daughter of Zain Khan Koka, Subadar of Kabul and Lahore. In 1608, he married Saliha Banu Begum, daughter of Qasim Khan, a senior member of the Imperial Household. On 17 June 1608, he married Koka Kumari Begum, eldest daughter of Jagat Singh, Yuvraj of Amber.\n\nJahangir married the extremely beautiful and intelligent Mehr-un-Nisaa (better known by her subsequent title of [[Nur Jahan]]) on 25 May 1611. She was the widow of [[Sher Afgan]]. Mehr-un-Nisaa became his indisputable chief consort and favourite wife immediately after their marriage. She was witty, intelligent and beautiful, which was what attracted Jahangir to her. Before being awarded the title of Nur Jahan ('Light of the World'), she was called Nur Mahal ('Light of the Palace'). Her abilities are said to range from fashion designing to hunting. There is also a myth that she had once killed four tigers with six bullets.\n\n=== Nur Jahan ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n[[File:Noorjahan & Jahangir.jpg|thumb|[[Nur Jahan]] and Jahangir]]\n\nMehr-Un-Nisa, or [[Nur Jahan]], occupies an important place in the history of Jahangir. She was the widow of a rebel officer, Sher Afgan, whose actual name was Ali Quli Beg Ist'ajlu. He had earned the title \"Sher Afgan\" (Tiger tosser) from Emperor Akbar after throwing off a tiger that had leaped to attack Akbar on the top of an elephant in a royal hunt at Bengal and then stabbing the fallen tiger to death. Akbar was greatly affected by the bravery of the young Turkish bodyguard accompanying him and awarded him the captaincy of the Imperial Guard at [[Burdwan]], [[Bengal]]. Sher Afgan had killed in rebellion (after having learned of Jahangir's orders to have him slain to possess his beautiful wife Mehr Un Nisaa as Jahangir yearned for her much earlier than her wedding to Sher Afgan), the governor of [[Bengal]] [[Qutubuddin Koka]] who was instructed secretly by Jahangir in his quest and who also was the emperor's foster brother and Sheikh [[Salim Chishti]]'s grandson and consequently had been slain by the guards of the Governor. The widowed Mehr-Un-Nisaa was brought to Agra along with her nine-year-old daughter and placed in\u2014or refused to be placed in\u2014the Royal harem in 1607. Jahangir married her in 1611 and gave her the title of Nur Jahan or \"Light of the World\". It was rumoured that Jahangir had a hand in the death of her first husband Sher Afghan, albeit there is no recorded evidence to prove that he was guilty of that crime; in fact most travellers' reports say that he met her after Sher Afgan's death. (See Ellison Banks Findly's scholarly biography for a full discussion.)\n\n[[File:Silver rupee coin of Jahangir, Ahmedabad mint.jpg|thumb|left|Heavy rupee of Jahangir]]\n\nThe loss of Kandahar was due to Prince Khurram's refusal to obey her orders. When the Persians besieged Kandahar, Nur Jahan was at the helm of affairs. She ordered Prince Khurram to march for Kandahar, but the latter refused to do so. There is no doubt that the refusal of the prince was due to her behaviour towards him, as she was favouring her son-in-law, Shahryar, at the expense of Khurram. Khurram suspected that in his absence, Shahryar might be given promotion and that he might die on the battlefield. This fear forced Khurram to rebel against his father rather than fight against the [[Safavid dynasty|Persians]], and thereby Kandahar was lost to the Persians. Nur Jahan struck coins in her own name during the last years of Jahangir's reign when he was taken ill.\n\nUnder Jahangir, the empire continued to be a war state attuned to conquest and expansion. Jahangir's most irksome foe was the Rana of Mewar, Amar Singh, who finally surrendered in 1613 to Khurram's forces. In the northeast, the Mughals clashed with the Ahoms of Assam, whose guerilla tactics gave the Mughals a hard time. In Northern India, Jahangir's forces under Khurram defeated their other principal adversary, the Raja of Kangra, in 1615; in the Deccan, his victories further consolidated the empire. But in 1620, Jahangir fell sick, and so ensued the familiar quest for power. Nur Jahan married her daughter to Shahryar, Jahangir's youngest son from his other queen, in the hope of having a living male heir to the throne when Jahangir died.\n\n== Conquests ==\n\nIn the year 1594, Jahangir was dispatched by his father, the Emperor [[Akbar]], alongside [[Abu'l-Hasan Asaf Khan]], also known as Mirza Jafar Beg son of [[Mirza Ghiyas Beg|Mirza Ghiyas Beg Isfahani]] and brother of [[Nur Jahan]], and [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]], to defeat the renegade [[Vir Singh Deo]] of [[Bundela]] and capture the city of [[Orchha]], which was considered the centre of the revolt. Jahangir arrived with a force of 12,000 after many ferocious encounters and finally subdued the Bundela and ordered Vir Singh Deo to surrender. After tremendous casualties and the start of negotiations between the two, Vir Singh Deo handed over 5000 Bundela infantry and 1000 cavalry, but he feared Mughal retaliation and remained a fugitive until his death. The victorious Jahangir, at 26 years of age, ordered the completion of the [[Jahangir Mahal]] a famous Mughal citadel in Orchha to commemorate and honour his victory.\n\n[[File:Jahangir hunting with a falcon..jpg|thumb|left|Jahangir with falcon on horseback]]\n\nJahangir then gathered his forces under the command of Ali Kuli Khan and fought Lakshmi Narayan of [[Koch Bihar]]. Lakshmi Narayan then accepted the Mughals as his suzerains and was given the title ''Nazir'', later establishing a garrison at Atharokotha.\n\nIn 1613,<ref>{{cite book |author=Sekhara Bandyopadhyaya |year=2004 |title=From Plassey to Partition: A History of Modern India |publisher=Orient Blackswan |page=37 |isbn=978-81-250-2596-2}}</ref> the Portuguese seized the Mughal ship ''Rahimi'', which had set out from [[Surat]] on its way with a large cargo of 100,000 rupees and Pilgrims, who were on their way to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] in order to attend the annual [[Hajj]]. The ''Rahimi'' was owned by [[Mariam-uz-Zamani]], mother of Jahangir and Akbar's Rajput wife. She was referred to as Queen mother of [[Hindustan]] during his reign. ''Rahimi'' was the largest Indian ship sailing in the [[Red Sea]] and was known to the Europeans as the \"great pilgrimage ship\". When the Portuguese officially refused to return the ship and the passengers, the outcry at the Mughal court was unusually severe. The outrage was compounded by the fact that the owner and the patron of the ship was none other than the revered mother of the current emperor. Jahangir himself was outraged and ordered the seizure of the Portuguese town Daman. He ordered the apprehension of all Portuguese within the Mughal Empire; he further confiscated churches that belonged to the [[Jesuit]]s. This episode is considered to be an example of the struggle for wealth that would later ensue and lead to colonisation of the Indian sub-continent.\n\nJahangir was responsible for ending a century long struggle with the state of [[Mewar]]. The campaign against the [[Rajput]]s was pushed so extensively that they were made to submit with great loss of life and property.\n\nJahangir posted [[Islam Khan I]] to subdue [[Musa Khan (Bengal Ruler)|Musa Khan]], an Afghan rebel in Bengal, in 1608. Jahangir also thought of capturing [[Kangra Fort]], which Akbar had failed to do in 1615. Consequently, a siege was laid and the fort was taken in 1620, which \"resulted in the submission of the Raja of Chamba who was the greatest of all the rajas in the region.\" The district of Kistwar, in the state of Kashmir, was also conquered.\n\n== Death ==\n[[File:Jehangir Tomb3.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Tomb of Jahangir]] in Shahdara, [[Lahore]]]]\n\nJahangir was trying to restore his health by visiting Kashmir and Kabul.

The body was then conveyed by palanquin to [[Lahore]] and was buried in [[Shahdara Bagh]], a suburb of that city. The [[Tomb of Jahangir|elegant mausoleum]] is today a popular tourist attraction site.\n\nJahangir was succeeded by his third son, Prince Khurram, who took the regnal name [[Shah Jahan]].\n\n== Religion ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n\nSir [[Thomas Roe]] was England's first ambassador to the Mughal court. Relations with England turned tense in 1617 when Roe warned Jahangir that if the young and charismatic Prince Shah Jahan, newly instated as the [[Subedar]] of [[Gujarat]], turned the English out of the province, ''\"then he must expect we would do our justice upon the seas\"''. Shah Jahan chose to seal an official [[Firman]] allowing the English to trade in Gujarat in the year 1618.\n\n[[File:Portrait of Emperor Jahangir Praying.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Mughal Emperor Jahangir's invocation of a [[Dua]] prayer]]\n\nMany contemporary chroniclers were not sure how to describe Jahangir's personal belief structure. Roe labelled him an [[atheist]], and although most others shied away from that term, they did not feel as though they could call him an orthodox [[Sunni]]. Roe believed Jahangir's religion to be of his own making, \"for he envies [the Prophet] Mohammed, and wisely sees no reason why he should not bee as great a prophet as he and therefore professed himself so... he hath found many disciples that flatter or follow him.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} At this time, one of those disciples happened to be the current English ambassador, though his initiation into Jahangir's inner circle was devoid of religious significance for Roe, as he did not understand the full extent of what he was doing. Jahangir hung \"a picture of him self set in gold hanging at a wire gold chain\" round Roe's neck. Roe thought it \"an especial favour, for that all the great men that wear the King's image (which none may do but to whom it is given) receive no other than a medal of gold as big as six pence.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nHad Roe intentionally converted, it would have caused quite a scandal in London. But since there was no intent, there was no resultant problem. Such disciples were an elite group of imperial servants, with one of them being promoted to Chief Justice. However, it is not clear that any of those who became disciples renounced their previous religion, so it is probable to see this as a way in which the emperor strengthened the bond between himself and his nobles. Despite Roe's somewhat casual use of the term 'atheist', he could not quite put his finger on Jahangir's real beliefs. Roe lamented that the emperor was either \"the most impossible man in the world to be converted, or the most easy; for he loves to hear, and hath so little religion yet, that he can well abide to have any derided.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[File:QUR'AN 2981b.jpg|thumb|left|A well-decorated manuscript of the [[Quran]], made during the reign of the [[Mughal Emperor]] Jahangir]]\n\nThis should not imply that the multi-confessional state appealed to all, or that all [[Muslims]] were happy with the situation in India. In a book written on statecraft for Jahangir, the author advised him to direct \"all his energies to understanding the counsel of the sages and to comprehending the intimations of the 'ulama.\" At the start of his regime many staunch Sunnis were hopeful, because he seemed less tolerant of other faiths than his father had been. At the time of his accession and the elimination of Abu'l Fazl, his father's chief minister and the architect of his eclectic religious stance, a powerful group of orthodox noblemen had gained increased power in the Mughal court. Jahangir did not always regard Hindu customs and rituals benevolently. On visiting a Hindu temple, he found a statue of a man with a pig's head (more than likely a boar's head, a representation of [[Varaha]]), one of the idols in the Hindu religion and he \"ordered them to break that hideous form and throw it in the tank.\" If the [[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri|Tuzuk]] is reliable on this subject (and there is no reason to suspect that it is not), then this was an isolated case.\n\nJ.F. Richards argues that \"Jahangir seems to have been persistently hostile to popularly venerated religious figures\", which is debatable. A Muslim saint, Mujadid Alif Sani Imam e Rabbani Sheikh Ahmed Sirhindi Al-Farooqi, who had gained a large number of followers through his spiritual preaching, was imprisoned in Gwalior Fort.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[File:Jahangir & Abbas I.jpg|thumb|A manuscript depicting the [[Mughal Emperor]] Jahangir and the [[Safavid]] [[Shah]] [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]], and the qualities of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]-[[Safavid]] relations.]]\n\nMost notorious was [[Guru Arjan Dev#Martyrdom|the execution]] of the Sikh [[Guru Arjan Dev]], whom Jahangir had had killed in prison. His lands were confiscated and his sons imprisoned as Jahangir suspected him of helping Khusrau's rebellion.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wynbrandt |first=James |date=2009 |title=A Brief History of Pakistan |url={{Google books|xQGwgJnCPZgC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |publisher=Infobase Publishing |pages=83\u201384 |isbn=978-0-8160-6184-6}}</ref> It is unclear whether Jahangir even understood what a Sikh was, referring to Guru Arjan as a Hindu, who had \"captured many of the simple-hearted of the Hindus and even of the ignorant and foolish followers of Islam, by his ways and manners... for three or four generations (of spiritual successors) they had kept this shop warm.\" The trigger for Guru Arjan's execution was his support for Jahangir's rebel son Khusrau Mirza, yet it is clear from Jahangir's own memoirs that he disliked Guru Arjan before then: \"many times it occurred to me to put a stop to this vain affair or bring him into the assembly of the people of Islam.\"<ref>Goel, The Story of Islamic Imperialism in India, 59.</ref>\n\nJahangir also moved swiftly to persecute Jains. One of his court historians states, \u201cOne day at Ahmadabad it was reported that many of the infidel and superstitious sect of the Seoras [Jains] of Gujarat had made several very great and splendid temples, and having placed in them their false gods, had managed to secure a large degree of respect for themselves and that the women who went for worship in those temples were polluted by them and other people. The Emperor Jahangir ordered them banished from the country, and their temples to be demolished.\u201d<ref>Shourie et al., Hindu Temples, 272.</ref>\n\nIn another story narrated by Jahangir himself in his memoir, Jahangir visited Pushkar and was shocked to find a temple of a boar like deity. He was quite taken-aback. \"The worthless religion of the Hindus is this,\" he claimed and ordered his men to destroy the idol. He also heard about a jogi doing mysterious things and he ordered his men to evict him and have the place destroyed.<ref>Shourie et al., Hindu Temples, 266.</ref><ref>Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri, translated into English by Alexander Rogers, first published 1909-1914, New Delhi Reprint, 1978, Vol. I, pp. 254-55</ref>\n\nMuqarrab Khan sent to Jahangir \"a European curtain (tapestry) the like of which in beauty no other work of the Frank [European] painters has ever been seen.\" One of his audience halls was \"adorned with European screens.\" Christian themes attracted Jahangir, and even merited a mention in the Tuzuk. One of his slaves gave him a piece of ivory into which had been carved four scenes. In the last scene \"there is a tree, below which the figure of the revered (hazrat) Jesus is shown. One person has placed his head at Jesus' feet, and an old man is conversing with Jesus and four others are standing by.\" Though Jahangir believed it to be the work of the slave who presented it to him, Sayyid Ahmad and Henry Beveridge suggest that it was of European origin and possibly showed the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]]. Wherever it came from, and whatever it represented, it was clear that a European style had come to influence Mughal art, otherwise the slave would not have claimed it as his own design, nor would he have been believed by Jahangir.\n\n== Art ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n\nJahangir was fascinated with art and architecture. In his autobiography, the [[Jahangir-nama|Jahangirnama]], Jahangir recorded events that occurred during his reign, descriptions of flora and fauna that he encountered, and other aspects of daily life, and commissioned court painters such as [[Ustad Mansur]] to paint detailed pieces that would accompany his vivid prose.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cleveland Beach|first=Milo|title=Mughal and Rajput Painting|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=90}}</ref> For example, in 1619, he put pen to paper in awe of a royal falcon delivered to his court from the ruler of Iran: \u201cWhat can I write of the beauty of this bird\u2019s color? It had black markings, and every feather on its wings, back, and sides was extremely beautiful,\u201d and then recorded his command that Ustad Mansur paint a portrait of it after it perished.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jahangir|first=|title=The Jahangirnama: Memoirs of Jahangir, Emperor of India|publisher=Freer Gallery of Art, Arthur M.

As he said: {{quote|text=...my liking for painting and my practice in judging it have arrived at such point when any work is brought before me, either of deceased artists or of those of the present day, without the names being told me, I say on the spur of the moment that is the work of such and such a man. And if there be a picture containing many portraits and each face is the work of a different master, I can discover which face is the work of each of them. If any other person has put in the eye and eyebrow of a face, I can perceive whose work the original face is and who has painted the eye and eyebrow.}}\n\n[[File:Jahangirs huqqa close national museum india.JPG|thumb|Jahangir's Jade ''[[hookah]]'', [[National Museum, New Delhi]]]]\n\nJahangir took his connoisseurship of art very seriously. He also preserved paintings from Emperor Akbar's period. An excellent example of this is the painting done by [[Ustad Mansur]] of Musician [[Naubat Khan]], son in law of legendary [[Tansen]]. In addition to their aesthetic qualities, paintings created under his reign were closely catalogued, dated and even signed, providing scholars with fairly accurate ideas as to when and in what context many of the pieces were created. \n\nIn the foreword to W. M. Thackston\u2019s translation of the Jahangirnama, [[Milo C. Beach|Milo Cleveland Beach]] explains that Jahangir ruled during a time of considerably stable political control, and had the opportunity to order artists to create art to accompany his memoirs that were \u201cin response to the emperor\u2019s current enthusiasms\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jahangir|first=|title=The Jahangirnama: Memoirs of Jahangir, Emperor of India|publisher=Freer Gallery of Art, Arthur M.

At times, he would have artists travel with him for this purpose; when Jahangir was in Rahimabad, he had his painters on hand to capture the appearance of a specific tiger that he shot and killed, because he found it to be particularly beautiful.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Verma|first=Som Prakash|title=Mughal Painter of Flora and Fauna: Ust\u0101d Man\u1e63\u016br|publisher=Abhinav Publications|year=1999|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=25}}</ref>\n\nThe Jesuits had brought with them various books, engravings, and paintings and, when they saw the delight Akbar held for them, sent for more and more of the same to be given to the Mughals. They felt the Mughals were on the \"verge of conversion\", a notion which proved to be very false. Instead, both Akbar and Jahangir studied this artwork very closely and replicated and adapted it, adopting much of the early iconographic features and later the pictorial realism for which [[Renaissance]] art was known. Jahangir was notable for his pride in the ability of his court painters. A classic example of this is described in [[Sir Thomas Roe]]'s diaries, in which the Emperor had his painters copy a European miniature several times creating a total of five miniatures. Jahangir then challenged Roe to pick out the original from the copies, a feat Sir Thomas Roe could not do, to the delight of Jahangir.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nJahangir was also revolutionary in his adaptation of European styles. A collection at the [[British Museum]] in London contains seventy-four drawings of Indian portraits dating from the time of Jahangir, including a portrait of the emperor himself. These portraits are a unique example of art during Jahangir's reign because faces were not drawn in full, including the shoulders as well as the head as these drawings are.\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nJahangir is widely considered to have been a weak and incapable ruler.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lach |first1=Donald F. |last2=Kley |first2=Edwin J.

The distinction between a weak and a strong version of this hypothesis is also a later invention; Sapir and Whorf never set up such a dichotomy, although often their writings and their views of this relativity principle are phrased in stronger or weaker terms.{{sfn|Hill| Mannheim |1992}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Kennison |first=Shelia |year=2013 |title=Introduction to language development |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Sage }}</ref>\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe idea was first clearly expressed by 19th-century thinkers, such as [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], who saw language as the expression of the spirit of a nation. Members of the early 20th-century school of American anthropology headed by [[Franz Boas]] and Edward Sapir also embraced forms of the idea to a certain extent, including in a 1928 meeting of the Linguistic Society of America,{{sfn|Koerner|1992|page=180}} but Sapir in particular, wrote more often against than in favor of anything like [[linguistic determinism]]. Sapir's student, Benjamin Lee Whorf, came to be seen as the primary proponent as a result of his published observations of how he perceived linguistic differences to have consequences in human cognition and behavior. [[Harry Hoijer]], another of Sapir's students, introduced the term \"Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis\",<ref>\"The Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis\", in {{harvnb|Hoijer|1954|pp=92\u2013105}}.</ref> even though the two scholars never formally advanced any such hypothesis.<ref>This usage is now generally seen as a misnomer. As Jane Hill and Bruce Mannheim write: Yet, just as the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire the \"Sapir\u2013Whorf Hypothesis\" is neither consistent with the writings of Sapir and Whorf, nor a hypothesis {{harv|Hill| Mannheim |1992| p=386}}</ref> A strong version of relativist theory was developed from the late 1920s by the German linguist [[Leo Weisgerber]]. Whorf's principle of linguistic relativity was reformulated as a testable hypothesis by [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] and [[Eric Lenneberg]] who conducted experiments designed to find out whether [[color perception]] varies between speakers of languages that classified colors differently. As the study of the universal nature of human language and cognition came into focus in the 1960s the idea of linguistic relativity fell out of favor among linguists. A 1969 study by [[Brent Berlin]] and [[Paul Kay]] demonstrated the existence of universal semantic constraints in the field of color terminology which were widely seen to discredit the existence of linguistic relativity in this domain, although this conclusion has been disputed by relativist researchers.\n\n=== Renewed examination ===\nFrom the late 1980s, a new school of linguistic relativity scholars has examined the effects of differences in linguistic categorization on cognition, finding broad support for non-deterministic versions of the hypothesis in experimental contexts.<ref name=\"Koerner\">Koerner, E.F.K. \"Towards a full pedigree of the Sapir\u2013Whorf Hypothesis: from Locke to Lucy\", chapter in {{harvnb|P\u00fctz|Verspoor|2000|p=17}}.</ref>{{sfn|Wolff|Holmes|2011}} Some effects of linguistic relativity have been shown in several semantic domains, although they are generally weak. Currently, a balanced view of linguistic relativity is espoused by most linguists holding that language influences certain kinds of cognitive processes in non-trivial ways, but that other processes are better seen as arising from [[Connectionism|connectionist]] factors. Research is focused on exploring the ways and extent to which language influences thought.<ref name=\"Koerner\" /> The principle of linguistic relativity and the relation between language and thought has also received attention in varying academic fields from [[philosophy]] to [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]], and it has also inspired and coloured works of fiction and the invention of [[constructed language]]s.\n\n== Forms ==\n\n=== Linguistic determinism ===\n{{Main|Linguistic determinism}}\n\nThe strongest form of the theory is linguistic determinism, which holds that language entirely determines the range of cognitive processes. The hypothesis of linguistic determinism is now generally agreed to be false.{{sfn|Ahearn|2011|page=69}}\n\n=== Linguistic influence ===\n\nThis is the weaker form, proposing that language provides constraints in some areas of cognition, but that it is by no means determinative. Research on weaker forms has produced positive [[empirical evidence]] for a relationship.{{sfn|Ahearn|2011|page=69}}\n\n== History ==\n\nThe idea that language and thought are intertwined is ancient. [[Plato]] argued against [[sophist]] thinkers such as [[Gorgias of Leontini]], who held that the physical world cannot be experienced except through language; this made the question of truth dependent on aesthetic preferences or functional consequences. Plato held instead that the world consisted of eternal ideas and that language should reflect these ideas as accurately as possible.<ref name=\"McComiskey2002\">{{cite book|first=Bruce |last=McComiskey|title=Gorgias and the New Sophistic Rhetoric|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=s3T6LYkGOqUC}}|year=2002|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=978-0-8093-2397-5}}</ref> Following Plato, [[St. Augustine]], for example, held the view that language was merely labels applied to already existing concepts. This view remained prevalent throughout the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Gumperz|Levinson|1996|p=2}} [[Roger Bacon]] held the opinion that language was but a veil covering up eternal truths, hiding them from human experience. For [[Immanuel Kant]], language was but one of several tools used by humans to experience the world.\n\n=== German Romantic philosophers ===\n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the idea of the existence of different national characters, or ''Volksgeister'', of different ethnic groups was the moving force behind the German romantics school and the beginning ideologies of ethnic nationalism.\n\nAlthough himself a Swede, [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] inspired several of the German Romantics. As early as 1749, he alludes to something along the lines of linguistic relativity in commenting on a passage in the table of nations in the book of Genesis: {{quote|\"Everyone according to his language, according to their families, as to their nations.\"[Genesis 10:5] This signifies that these were according to the genius of each;  \"according to their language,\" according to the opinion of each.... \"Language,\" in its inner meaning, signifies opinion, thus principles and persuasions. This is because there is a correspondence of the language with the intellectual part of man, or with his thought, like that of an effect with its cause.<ref>''Arcana Coelestia'' section 1059. http://smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ac&section=1059.</ref>}} In 1771 he spelled this out more explicitly: {{quote|There is a common genius prevailing among those who are subject to one king, and who consequently are under one constitutional law. Germany is divided into more governments than the neighboring kingdoms.... However, a common genius prevails everywhere among people speaking the same language.<ref>''True Christian Religion'' section 813. http://smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=tcr&section=813.</ref>}}\n[[File:WilhelmvonHumboldt.jpg|thumb|[[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]]]\n[[Johann Georg Hamann]] is often suggested to be the first among the actual German Romantics to speak of the concept of \"the genius of a language.\"<ref>Robert L. Miller ''The Linguistic Relativity Principle and Humboldtian Ethnolinguistics'' p. 18.</ref>{{sfn|McAfee|2004}} In his \"Essay Concerning an Academic Question,\" Hamann suggests that a people's language affects their worldview:\n{{quote|The lineaments of their language will thus correspond to the direction of their mentality.<ref>Quoted in Bernard D. Den Ouden, ''Language and Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Essay in Chomskyan Humanism,'' p. 25.</ref>}}\nIn 1820, [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] connected the study of language to the national romanticist program by proposing the view that language is the fabric of thought. Thoughts are produced as a kind of internal dialog using the same grammar as the thinker's native language.<ref name=\"Trabant\">Trabant, J\u00fcrgen. \"How relativistic are Humboldts \"Weltansichten\"?\", in {{harvnb|P\u00fctz|Verspoor|2000|p=}}.</ref> This view was part of a larger picture in which the world view of an ethnic nation, their \"[[world view|Weltanschauung]]\", was seen as being faithfully reflected in the grammar of their language. Von Humboldt argued that languages with an [[inflection]]al [[Morphological typology|morphological type]], such as German, English and the other [[Indo-European languages]], were the most perfect languages and that accordingly this explained the dominance of their speakers over the speakers of less perfect languages. Wilhelm von Humboldt declared in 1820:\n\n{{quote|The diversity of languages is not a diversity of signs and sounds but a diversity of views of the world.<ref name=\"Trabant\" />}}\n\n=== Boas and Sapir ===\n\n[[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|[[Franz Boas]]]]\n\n[[File:Edward Sapir.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Sapir]]]]\n\nThe idea that some languages are superior to others and that lesser languages maintained their speakers in intellectual poverty was widespread in the early 20th century{{sfn|Migge|L\u00e9glise|2007}}. American linguist [[William Dwight Whitney]], for example, actively strove to eradicate [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]], arguing that their speakers were savages and would be better off learning English and adopting a \"civilized\" way of life.{{sfn|Seuren|1998|p=180}} The first anthropologist and linguist to challenge this view was [[Franz Boas]].{{sfn|Seuren|1998|p=181}} While undertaking geographical research in northern Canada he became fascinated with the [[Inuit]] people and decided to become an [[Ethnography|ethnographer]]. Boas stressed the equal worth of all cultures and languages, that there was no such thing as a primitive language and that all languages were capable of expressing the same content, albeit by widely differing means. Boas saw language as an inseparable part of culture and he was among the first to require of ethnographers to learn the native language of the culture under study and to document verbal culture such as [[myth]]s and legends in the original language.\n\nBoas:\n\n{{quote|It does not seem likely [...] that there is any direct relation between the culture of a tribe and the language they speak, except in so far as the form of the language will be moulded by the state of the culture, but not in so far as a certain state of the culture is conditioned by the morphological traits of the language.\"<ref name=\"BOAS1911\">{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=EnZC68mmRhQC}}|last=Boas |first=Franz|year=1911|title=Handbook of American Indian languages|volume=1|publisher=Bureau of American Ethnology, Bulletin 40. Washington: Government Print Office (Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology).}}</ref>}}\n\nBoas' student Edward Sapir reached back to the Humboldtian idea that languages contained the key to understanding the world views of peoples. He espoused the viewpoint that because of the differences in the grammatical systems of languages no two languages were similar enough to allow for perfect cross-translation. Sapir also thought because language represented reality differently, it followed that the speakers of different languages would perceive reality differently.\n\nSapir:\n\n{{quote|No two languages are ever sufficiently similar to be considered as representing the same social reality. The worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same world with different labels attached.<ref>{{citation|last=Sapir |first=Edward|year=1929|title= The status of linguistics as a science|journal=Language|volume=5|doi=10.2307/409588|issue=4|pages=207\u2013214|jstor=409588|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-002C-4321-4}}</ref>}}\n\nOn the other hand, Sapir explicitly rejected strong [[linguistic determinism]] by stating, \"It would be na\u00efve to imagine that any analysis of experience is dependent on pattern expressed in language.\"<ref name=\"SapirSwadesh1946\">{{cite book|first1=Edward |last1=Sapir|first2=Morris |last2=Swadesh |authorlink1=Morris Swadesh|title=American Indian Grammatical Categories|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=wSYJMgEACAAJ|page=100}}|year=1946 |pp=100\u2013107}}</ref>\n\nSapir was explicit that the connections between language and culture were neither thoroughgoing nor particularly deep, if they existed at all:\n\n{{quote|It is easy to show that language and culture are not intrinsically associated. Totally unrelated languages share in one culture; closely related languages\u2014even a single language\u2014belong to distinct culture spheres. There are many excellent examples in Aboriginal America. The Athabaskan languages form as clearly unified, as structurally specialized, a group as any that I know of. The speakers of these languages belong to four distinct culture areas... The cultural adaptability of the Athabaskan-speaking peoples is in the strangest contrast to the inaccessibility to foreign influences of the languages themselves.{{sfn|Sapir|1921|p=213\u20134}}}}\n\nSapir offered similar observations about speakers of so-called \"world\" or [[modern language|\"modern\" languages]], noting, \"possession of a common language is still and will continue to be a smoother of the way to a mutual understanding between England and America, but it is very clear that other factors, some of them rapidly cumulative, are working powerfully to counteract this leveling influence. A common language cannot indefinitely set the seal on a common culture when the geographical, physical, and economics determinants of the culture are no longer the same throughout the area.\"{{sfn|Sapir|1921|p=215}}\n\nWhile Sapir never made a point of studying directly how languages affected thought, some notion of (probably \"weak\") linguistic relativity underlay his basic understanding of language, and would be taken up by Whorf.\n\nDrawing on influences such as Humboldt and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], some European thinkers developed ideas similar to those of Sapir and Whorf, generally working in isolation from each other. Prominent in Germany from the late 1920s through into the 1960s were the strongly relativist theories of [[Leo Weisgerber]] and his key concept of a 'linguistic inter-world', mediating between external reality and the forms of a given language, in ways peculiar to that language.<ref>For a critique of Weisgerber, see, for example: Beat Lehmann (1998), ''ROT ist nicht \u2033rot\u2033 ist nicht [rot].

His 1934 work \"''Thought and Language''\"<ref>Vygotsky, L. (1934/1986). Thought and language. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.</ref> has been compared to Whorf's and taken as mutually supportive evidence of language's influence on cognition.{{sfn|Lucy|Wertsch|1987}} Drawing on Nietzsche's ideas of perspectivism [[Alfred Korzybski]] developed the theory of [[general semantics]] that has been compared to Whorf's notions of linguistic relativity.{{sfn|Pula|1992}} Though influential in their own right, this work has not been influential in the debate on linguistic relativity, which has tended to center on the American paradigm exemplified by Sapir and Whorf.\n\n=== Benjamin Lee Whorf ===\n{{Main|Benjamin Lee Whorf}}\n\nMore than any linguist, Benjamin Lee Whorf has become associated with what he called the \"linguistic relativity principle\".{{sfn|Whorf|1956|p=214}} Studying [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] languages, he attempted to account for the ways in which grammatical systems and language use differences affected perception. Whorf also examined how a scientific account of the world differed from a religious account, which led him to study the original languages of religious scripture and to write several anti-[[evolution]]ist pamphlets.{{sfn|Whorf|1956}} Whorf's opinions regarding the nature of the relation between language and thought remain under contention. Critics such as Lenneberg, [[Max Black|Black]] and [[Steven Pinker|Pinker]] attribute to Whorf a strong linguistic determinism, while [[John A. Lucy|Lucy]], [[Michael Silverstein|Silverstein]] and [[Stephen C. Levinson|Levinson]] point to Whorf's explicit rejections of determinism, and where he contends that translation and commensuration is possible.\n\nAlthough Whorf lacked an advanced degree in linguistics, his reputation reflects his acquired competence. His peers at [[Yale University]] considered the 'amateur' Whorf to be the best man available to take over Sapir's graduate seminar in Native American linguistics while Sapir was on sabbatical in 1937\u201338.{{sfn|Darnell|1990|p=380-81}} He was highly regarded by authorities such as Boas, Sapir, [[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfield]] and [[Alfred M. Tozzer|Tozzer]]. Indeed, [[John A. Lucy|Lucy]] wrote, \"despite his 'amateur' status, Whorf's work in linguistics was and still is recognized as being of superb professional quality by linguists\".{{sfn|Lucy|1992b|p=25}}\n\nDetractors such as Lenneberg, [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] and [[Steven Pinker|Pinker]] criticized him for insufficient clarity in his description of how language influences thought, and for not proving his conjectures. Most of his arguments were in the form of anecdotes and speculations that served as attempts to show how 'exotic' grammatical traits were connected to what were apparently equally exotic worlds of thought. In Whorf's words:\n\n{{quote|We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native language. The categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not find there because they stare every observer in the face; on the contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscope flux of impressions which has to be organized by our minds\u2014and this means largely by the linguistic systems of our minds. We cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this way\u2014an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our language [...] all observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the universe, unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar, or can in some way be calibrated.{{sfn|Whorf|1956|p=212\u2013214}}}}\n\n[[File:Whorf Shawnee Example.png|400px|thumb|Whorf's illustration of the difference between the English and Shawnee gestalt construction of cleaning a gun with a ramrod. From the article \"Science and Linguistics\", originally published in the ''MIT Technology Review'', 1940.]]\n\nAmong Whorf's best-known examples of linguistic relativity are instances where an indigenous language has several terms for a concept that is only described with one word in European languages (Whorf used the acronym SAE \"[[Standard Average European]]\" to allude to the rather similar grammatical structures of the well-studied European languages in contrast to the greater diversity of less-studied languages).\n\nOne of Whorf's examples was the supposedly large number of words for [[Eskimo words for snow|'snow' in the Inuit language]], an example which later was contested as a misrepresentation.{{sfn|Pullum|1991}}\n\nAnother is the [[Hopi language]]'s words for water, one indicating drinking water in a container and another indicating a natural body of water. These examples of [[polysemy]] served the double purpose of showing that indigenous languages sometimes made more fine grained semantic distinctions than European languages and that direct translation between two languages, even of seemingly basic concepts such as snow or water, is not always possible.\n\nAnother example is from Whorf's experience as a chemical engineer working for an insurance company as a fire inspector.{{sfn|Pullum|1991}} While inspecting a chemical plant he observed that the plant had two storage rooms for gasoline barrels, one for the full barrels and one for the empty ones. He further noticed that while no employees smoked cigarettes in the room for full barrels, no-one minded smoking in the room with empty barrels, although this was potentially much more dangerous because of the highly flammable vapors still in the barrels. He concluded that the use of the word ''empty'' in connection to the barrels had led the workers to unconsciously regard them as harmless, although consciously they were probably aware of the risk of explosion. This example was later criticized by Lenneberg{{sfn|Lenneberg|1953}} as not actually demonstrating causality between the use of the word ''empty'' and the action of smoking, but instead was an example of [[circular reasoning]]. Pinker in ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' ridiculed this example, claiming that this was a failing of human insight rather than language.\n\nWhorf's most elaborate argument for linguistic relativity regarded what he believed to be a fundamental difference in the understanding of [[Hopi time controversy|time as a conceptual category among the Hopi]].{{sfn|Whorf|1956}} He argued that in contrast to English and other [[Standard Average European|SAE languages]], Hopi does not treat the flow of time as a sequence of distinct, countable instances, like \"three days\" or \"five years,\" but rather as a single process and that consequently it has no nouns referring to units of time as SAE speakers understand them. He proposed that this view of time was fundamental to [[Hopi]] culture and explained certain Hopi behavioral patterns. Malotki later claimed that he had found no evidence of Whorf's claims in 1980's era speakers, nor in historical documents dating back to the arrival of Europeans. Malotki used evidence from archaeological data, calendars, historical documents, modern speech and concluded that there was no evidence that Hopi conceptualize time in the way Whorf suggested. Universalist scholars such as Pinker often see Malotki's study as a final refutation of Whorf's claim about Hopi, whereas relativist scholars such as [[John A Lucy|Lucy]] and Penny Lee criticized Malotki's study for mischaracterizing Whorf's claims and for forcing Hopi grammar into a model of analysis that doesn't fit the data.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|1996}}, {{harvnb|Leavitt|2011|pp=179\u2013187}}, {{harvnb|Lucy|1992b|p=286}}, {{harvnb|Lucy|1996|p=43}}, {{harvnb|Dinwoodie|2006}}.</ref>\n\nWhorf died in 1941 at age 44, leaving multiple unpublished papers. His line of thought was continued by linguists and anthropologists such as Hoijer and [[Dorothy D. Lee|Lee]] who both continued investigations into the effect of language on habitual thought, and [[George L. Trager|Trager]], who prepared a number of Whorf's papers for posthumous publishing. The most important event for the dissemination of Whorf's ideas to a larger public was the publication in 1956 of his major writings on the topic of linguistic relativity in a single volume titled ''Language, Thought and Reality''.\n\n=== Eric Lenneberg ===\n\nIn 1953, [[Eric Lenneberg]] criticised Whorf's examples from an objectivist view of language holding that languages are principally meant to represent events in the real world and that even though languages express these ideas in various ways, the meanings of such expressions and therefore the thoughts of the speaker are equivalent. He argued that Whorf's English descriptions of a Hopi speaker's view of time were in fact translations of the Hopi concept into English, therefore disproving linguistic relativity. However Whorf was concerned with how the habitual ''use'' of language influences habitual behavior, rather than translatability. Whorf's point was that while English speakers may be able to ''understand'' how a Hopi speaker thinks, they do not ''think'' in that way.{{sfn|Lakoff|1987|p=}}\n\nLenneberg's main criticism of Whorf's works was that he never showed the connection between a linguistic phenomenon and a mental phenomenon. With Brown, Lenneberg proposed that proving such a connection required directly matching linguistic phenomena with behavior. They assessed linguistic relativity experimentally and published their findings in 1954.\n\nSince neither Sapir nor Whorf had ever stated a formal hypothesis, Brown and Lenneberg formulated their own. Their two tenets were (i) \"the world is differently experienced and conceived in different linguistic communities\" and (ii) \"language causes a particular cognitive structure\".{{sfn|Brown|Lenneberg|1954|p=455,457}} Brown later developed them into the so-called \"weak\" and \"strong\" formulation:\n\n<blockquote>\n* Structural differences between language systems will, in general, be paralleled by nonlinguistic cognitive differences, of an unspecified sort, in the native speakers of the language.\n* The structure of anyone's native language strongly influences or fully determines the worldview he will acquire as he learns the language.{{sfn|Brown|1976|p=128}}</blockquote>\n\nBrown's formulations became widely known and were retrospectively attributed to Whorf and Sapir although the second formulation, verging on linguistic determinism, was never advanced by either of them.\n\nSince Brown and Lenneberg believed that the objective reality denoted by language was the same for speakers of all languages, they decided to test how different languages codified the same message differently and whether differences in codification could be proven to affect behavior.\n\nThey designed experiments involving the codification of colors. In their first experiment, they investigated whether it was easier for speakers of English to remember color shades for which they had a specific name than to remember colors that were not as easily definable by words. This allowed them to compare the linguistic categorization directly to a non-linguistic task. In a later experiment, speakers of two languages that categorize colors differently ([[English language|English]] and [[Zuni language|Zuni]]) were asked to recognize colors. In this way, it could be determined whether the differing color categories of the two speakers would determine their ability to recognize nuances within color categories. Brown and Lenneberg found that Zu\u00f1i speakers who [[Distinguishing blue from green in language|classify green and blue together]] as a single color did have trouble recognizing and remembering nuances within the green/blue category.{{sfn|D'Andrade|1995|p= 185}} Brown and Lenneberg's study began a tradition of investigation of linguistic relativity through color terminology.\n\n=== Universalist period ===\n{{Main|Universalism |Universalism and relativism of color terminology}}\n\nLenneberg was also one of the first cognitive scientists to begin development of the Universalist theory of language that was formulated by Chomsky in the form of [[Universal Grammar]], effectively arguing that all languages share the same underlying structure. The Chomskyan school also holds the belief that linguistic structures are largely innate and that what are perceived as differences between specific languages are surface phenomena that do not affect the brain's universal cognitive processes. This theory became the dominant paradigm in American linguistics from the 1960s through the 1980s, while linguistic relativity became the object of ridicule.{{sfn|Gumperz|Levinson|1996|p=3, 6}}\n\nExamples of universalist influence in the 1960s are the studies by [[Brent Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Paul Kay|Kay]] who continued Lenneberg's color research. They studied color terminology formation and showed clear universal trends in color naming. For example, they found that even though languages have different color terminologies, they generally recognize certain hues as more focal than others. They showed that in languages with few color terms, it is predictable from the number of terms which hues are chosen as focal colors, for example, languages with only three color terms always have the focal colors black, white and red.{{sfn|Berlin|Kay|1969}} The fact that what had been believed to be random differences between color naming in different languages could be shown to follow universal patterns was seen as a powerful argument against linguistic relativity.{{sfn|Gumperz|Levinson|1996|p=6}} Berlin and Kay's research has since been criticized by relativists such as Lucy, who argued that Berlin and Kay's conclusions were skewed by their insistence that color terms encode only color information.{{sfn|Lucy|1992a}} This, Lucy argues, made them blind to the instances in which color terms provided other information that might be considered examples of linguistic relativity.\n\nOther universalist researchers dedicated themselves to dispelling other aspects of linguistic relativity, often attacking Whorf's specific points and examples. For example, Malotki's monumental study of time expressions in Hopi presented many examples that challenged Whorf's \"timeless\" interpretation of Hopi language and culture,{{sfn|Malotki|1983}} but seemingly failed to address linguistic relativist argument actually posed by Whorf (i.e. that the understanding of time by native Hopi speakers differed from that of speakers of European languages due to the differences in the organization and construction of their respective languages; Whorf never claimed that Hopi speakers lacked any concept of time).{{sfn|Lucy|1996}} Malotki himself acknowledges that the conceptualizations are different, but because he ignores Whorf's use of scare quotes around the word \"time\" and the qualifier \"what we call,\" takes Whorf to be arguing that the Hopi have no concept of time at all.{{sfn|Lucy|1992b|p=286}}{{sfn|Leavitt|2011|p=180}}{{sfn|Levinson|2012|p=xii}}\n\nToday many followers of the universalist school of thought still oppose linguistic relativity. For example, Pinker argues in ''The Language Instinct'' that thought is independent of language, that language is itself meaningless in any fundamental way to human thought, and that human beings do not even think in \"natural\" language, i.e. any language that we actually communicate in; rather, we think in a meta-language, preceding any natural language, called \"mentalese.\" Pinker attacks what he calls \"Whorf's radical position,\" declaring, \"the more you examine Whorf's arguments, the less sense they make.\"{{sfn|Pinker|1994|p=60}}\n\nPinker and other universalists have been accused by relativists of misrepresenting Whorf's views and arguing against [[Strawman fallacy|strawmen]].{{sfn|Casasanto|2008|p=}}{{sfn|Lucy|1992a|p=}}{{sfn|Lakoff|1987|p=}}\n\n=== Joshua Fishman's \"Whorfianism of the third kind\" ===\n\n[[Joshua Aaron Fishman|Joshua Fishman]] argued that Whorf's true position was largely overlooked. In 1978, he suggested that Whorf was a \"neo-[[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herderian]] champion\"{{sfn|Fishman|1978}} and in 1982, he proposed \"Whorfianism of the third kind\" in an attempt to refocus linguists' attention on what he claimed was Whorf's real interest, namely the intrinsic value of \"little peoples\" and \"little languages\".{{sfn|Fishman|1982|p=5}} Whorf had criticized [[Charles Kay Ogden|Ogden]]'s [[Basic English]] thus:\n\n{{quote|But to restrict thinking to the patterns merely of English [\u2026] is to lose a power of thought which, once lost, can never be regained. It is the 'plainest' English which contains the greatest number of unconscious assumptions about nature. [\u2026] We handle even our plain English with much greater effect if we direct it from the vantage point of a multilingual awareness.{{sfn|Whorf|1956|p=244}}}}\n\nWhere Brown's weak version of the linguistic relativity hypothesis proposes that language ''influences'' thought and the strong version that language ''determines'' thought, Fishman's 'Whorfianism of the third kind' proposes that language ''is a key to culture''.\n\n=== Cognitive linguistics ===\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, advances in [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive linguistics]] renewed interest in the Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis.{{sfn|Seidner|1982}} One of those who adopted a more Whorfian approach was [[George Lakoff]]. He argued that language is often used metaphorically and that languages use different [[conceptual metaphor|cultural metaphors]] that reveal something about how speakers of that language think. For example, English employs conceptual metaphors likening time with money, so that time can be saved and spent and invested, whereas other languages do not talk about time in that way. Other such metaphors are common to many languages because they are based on general human experience, for example, metaphors likening ''up'' with ''good'' and ''bad'' with ''down''. Lakoff also argued that metaphor plays an important part in political debates such as the \"right to life\" or the \"right to choose\"; or \"illegal aliens\" or \"undocumented workers\".\n\n==== Parameters ====\nIn his book ''Women, Fire and Dangerous things: What categories reveal about the mind,''{{sfn|Lakoff|1987}} Lakoff reappraised linguistic relativity and especially Whorf's views about how linguistic categorization reflects and/or influences mental categories. He concluded that the debate had been confused. He described four parameters on which researchers differed in their opinions about what constitutes linguistic relativity:\n* The degree and depth of linguistic relativity. Perhaps a few examples of superficial differences in language and associated behavior are enough to demonstrate the existence of linguistic relativity. Alternatively, perhaps only deep differences that permeate the linguistic and cultural system suffice.\n* Whether conceptual systems are absolute or whether they can evolve\n* Whether the similarity criterion is translatability or the use of linguistic expressions\n* Whether the focus of linguistic relativity is in language or in the brain\nLakoff concluded that many of Whorf's critics had criticized him using novel definitions of linguistic relativity, rendering their criticisms moot.\n\n==== ''Rethinking Linguistic Relativity'' ====\nThe publication of the 1996 anthology ''Rethinking Linguistic Relativity'' edited by [[John J. Gumperz|Gumperz]] and [[Stephen C. Levinson|Levinson]] began a new period of linguistic relativity studies that focused on cognitive and social aspects. The book included studies on the linguistic relativity and universalist traditions. Levinson documented significant linguistic relativity effects in the linguistic conceptualization of spatial categories between languages. For example, men speaking the [[Guugu Yimithirr language]] in [[Queensland]] gave accurate navigation instructions using a compass-like system of north, south, east and west, along with a hand gesture pointing to the starting direction.{{sfn|Levinson|1998|p=13}}\n\nSeparate studies by [[Melissa Bowerman|Bowerman]] and [[Dan Slobin|Slobin]] treated the role of language in cognitive processes. Bowerman showed that certain cognitive processes did not use language to any significant extent and therefore could not be subject to linguistic relativity. Slobin described another kind of cognitive process that he named \"thinking for speaking\" \u2013 the kind of process in which perceptional data and other kinds of prelinguistic cognition are translated into linguistic terms for communication. These, Slobin argues, are the kinds of cognitive process that are at the root of linguistic relativity.\n\n=== Refinements ===\n\nResearchers such as [[Lera Boroditsky|Boroditsky]], Lucy and Levinson believe that language influences thought in more limited ways than the broadest early claims. Researchers examine the interface between thought (or cognition), language and culture and describe the relevant influences. They use experimental data to back up their conclusions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gentner|first1=Dedre|last2=Boroditsky|first2=Lera|editor=Melissa Bowerman and Stephen Levinson|title=Language Acquisition and Conceptual Development|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-59659-6|pages=215\u2013256|chapter=Individuation, relativity, and early word development}}</ref><ref name=\"Levinson2001\">{{cite book|last=Levinson|first=Stephen|editor=Melissa Bowerman and Stephen Levinson|title=Language Acquisition and Conceptual Development|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-59659-6|pages=566\u2013588|chapter=Covariation between spatial language and cognition, and its implications for language learning}}</ref> Kay ultimately concluded that \"[the] Whorf hypothesis is supported in the right visual field but not the left\".<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Gilbert\n| first = Aubrey L.\n| last2 = Regier\n| first2 = Terry\n| last3 = Kay\n| first3 = Paul\n| last4 = Ivry\n| first4 = Richard B.\n| date = 10 January 2006\n| title = Whorf hypothesis is supported in the right visual field but not the left\n| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America\n| language = en\n| volume = 103\n| issue = 2\n| pages = 489\u2013494\n| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0509868103\n| issn = 0027-8424\n| pmc = 1326182\n| pmid = 16387848\n| bibcode = 2006PNAS..103..489G\n}}</ref> His findings show that accounting for [[brain lateralization]] offers another perspective.\n\n[[psycholinguistics|Psycholinguistic]] studies explored motion perception, emotion perception, object representation and memory.<ref name=\"HickmannRobert2006\">{{cite book|first1=Maya |last1=Hickmann|first2=St\u00e9phane |last2=Robert|title=Space in Languages: Linguistic Systems and Cognitive Categories|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=naZ_bZHEs4IC|page=281}}|date=16 May 2006|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=978-90-272-9355-8|pages=281\u2013308|chapter=The relativity of motion in first language acquisition}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Perlovsky|first1=Leonid|title=Language and emotions: Emotional Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis|journal=Neural Networks|volume=22|issue=5\u20136|year=2009|pages=518\u2013526|issn=0893-6080|doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2009.06.034|pmid=19616406}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Linguistic Relativity in Japanese and English: Is Language the Primary Determinant in Object Classification?|last1=Mazuka|first1=Reiko |last2=Friedman|first2=Ronald S.|journal=Journal of East Asian Linguistics|volume=9|issue=4|year=2000|pages=353\u2013377|issn=0925-8558|doi=10.1023/A:1008356620617}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pavlenko|first1=A.|title=Eyewitness memory in late bilinguals: Evidence for discursive relativity|journal=International Journal of Bilingualism|volume=7|issue=3|year=2003|pages=257\u2013281|issn=1367-0069|doi=10.1177/13670069030070030301|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5f54cd91169f01b02d59ee44cdfdd0f2d3ebd992}}</ref> The gold standard of psycholinguistic studies on linguistic relativity is now finding non-linguistic cognitive differences in speakers of different languages (thus rendering inapplicable Pinker's criticism that linguistic relativity is \"circular\").\n\nRecent work with [[bilingual]] speakers attempts to distinguish the effects of language from those of culture on bilingual cognition including perceptions of time, space, motion, colors and emotion.<ref>{{harvnb|Pavlenko|1999}}, {{harvnb|Cook|Bassetti|2010}}, {{harvnb|Athanasopoulos|2009}}, {{harvnb|Phillips|Boroditsky|2003}}.</ref> Researchers described differences between bilinguals and [[monolingual]]s in perception of color,{{sfn|Andrews|1994}} representations of time{{sfn|Boroditsky|Ham|Ramscar|2002}} and other elements of cognition.\n\n== Empirical research ==\n\nLucy identified three main strands of research into linguistic relativity.{{sfn|Lucy|1997}}\n\n=== Structure-centered ===\nThe \"structure-centered\" approach starts with a language's structural peculiarity and examines its possible ramifications for thought and behavior. The defining example is Whorf's observation of discrepancies between the grammar of time expressions in Hopi and English. More recent research in this vein is Lucy's research describing how usage of the categories of grammatical number and of numeral classifiers in the [[Mayan languages|Mayan language]] [[Yucatec Maya|Yucatec]] result in Mayan speakers classifying objects according to material rather than to shape as preferred by English speakers.{{sfn|Lucy|1992b|p=}}\n\n=== Domain-centered ===\nThe \"domain-centered\" approach selects a semantic domain and compares it across linguistic and cultural groups. It centered on color terminology, although this domain is acknowledged to be sub-optimal, because color perception, unlike other semantic domains, is hardwired into the neural system and as such is subject to more universal restrictions than other semantic domains.\n\nSpace is another semantic domain that has proven fruitful for linguistic relativity studies.{{sfn|Lucy|1997|p=301}} Spatial categories vary greatly across languages. Speakers rely on the linguistic conceptualization of space in performing many ordinary tasks. Levinson and others reported three basic spatial categorizations. While many languages use combinations of them, some languages exhibit only one type and related behaviors. For example, [[Guugu Yimithirr language|Yimithirr]] only uses absolute directions when describing spatial relations&nbsp;\u2014 the position of everything is described by using the cardinal directions. Speakers define a location as \"north of the house\", while an English speaker may use relative positions, saying \"in front of the house\" or \"to the left of the house\".{{sfn|Levinson|1996}}\n\n=== Behavior-centered ===\nThe \"behavior centered\" approach starts by comparing behavior across linguistic groups and then searches for causes for that behavior in the linguistic system. Whorf attributed the occurrence of fires at a chemical plant to the workers' use of the word 'empty' to describe the barrels containing only explosive vapors. Bloom noticed that speakers of Chinese had unexpected difficulties answering counter-factual questions posed to them in a questionnaire. He concluded that this was related to the way in which counter-factuality is marked grammatically in Chinese. Other researchers attributed this result to Bloom's flawed translations.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(84)90012-X|title = Counterfactuals: In reply to Alfred Bloom|journal = Cognition|volume = 17|issue = 3|pages = 289\u2013302|year = 1984|last1 = Au|first1 = T.}}</ref> Str\u00f8mnes examined why Finnish factories had a higher occurrence of work related accidents than similar Swedish ones.

The study focused on three groups, those who spoke only Swedish, those who spoke only Spanish and bilingual speakers who spoke both of those languages. Swedish speakers describe time using distance terms like \"long\" or \"short\" while Spanish speakers do it using volume related terms like \"big\" or \"small\". The researchers asked the participants to estimate how much time had passed while watching a line growing across a screen, or a container being filled, or both. The researchers stated that \"When reproducing duration, Swedish speakers were misled by stimulus length, and Spanish speakers were misled by stimulus size/quantity.\" When the bilinguals were prompted with the word \"duraci\u00f3n\" (the Spanish word for duration) they based their time estimates of how full the containers were, ignoring the growing lines.

The studies showed a correlation between color term numbers and ease of recall in both Zuni and English speakers. Researchers attributed this to focal colors having higher codability than less focal colors, and not with linguistic relativity effects. Berlin/Kay found universal typological color principles that are determined by biological rather than linguistic factors.{{sfn|Berlin|Kay|1969}} This study sparked studies into typological universals of color terminology.

The innate view holds that humans share the same set of basic faculties, and that variability due to cultural differences is less important and that the human mind is a mostly biological construction, so that all humans sharing the same neurological configuration can be expected to have similar cognitive patterns.\n\nMultiple alternatives have advocates. The contrary [[Social constructivism|constructivist]] position holds that human faculties and concepts are largely influenced by socially constructed and learned categories, without many biological restrictions. Another variant is [[idealist]], which holds that human mental capacities are generally unrestricted by biological-material strictures. Another is [[essentialism|essentialist]], which holds that essential differences{{clarify|reason=what essential differences|date=May 2017}} may influence the ways individuals or groups experience and conceptualize the world. Yet another is [[relativist]] ([[Cultural relativism]]), which sees different cultural groups as employing different conceptual schemes that are not necessarily compatible or commensurable, nor more or less in accord with external reality.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011}}\n\nAnother debate considers whether thought is a form of internal speech or is independent of and prior to language.<ref>{{cite book |last=Raykowski |first=Wes |date=2014|title=Conceptual Understructure of Human Experience: Volume 1 (Thesis)}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[philosophy of language]] the question addresses the relations between language, knowledge and the external world, and the concept of [[truth]]. Philosophers such as [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]], [[Jerry Fodor|Fodor]], Davidson, and [[Daniel Dennett|Dennett]] see language as representing directly entities from the objective world and that categorization reflect that world. Other philosophers (e.g. [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], Searle, [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]) argue that categorization and conceptualization is subjective and arbitrary.\n\nAnother question is whether language is a tool for representing and referring to objects in the world, or whether it is a system used to construct mental representations that can be communicated.{{clarify|reason=what is the relevance of this in the local context? Is this a true dichotomy?|date=May 2017}}\n\n=== Therapy and self-development ===\n{{Main|General semantics|Neurolinguistic Programming}}\n\nSapir/Whorf contemporary [[Alfred Korzybski]] was independently developing his theory of [[general semantics]], which was aimed at using language's influence on thinking to maximize human cognitive abilities.

[[S. I. Hayakawa]] was a follower and popularizer of Korzybski's work, writing ''[[Language in Thought and Action]]''.

In Rand's [[Anthem (novella)|''Anthem'']], a fictive [[communist]] society removed the possibility of individualism by removing the word \"I\" from the language.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In Orwell's ''[[1984 (book)|1984]]'' the authoritarian state created the language [[Newspeak]] to make it impossible for people to think critically about the government, or even to contemplate that they might be impoverished or oppressed, by reducing the number of words to reduce the thought of the locutor.{{sfn|Pinker|1994|loc=chap. 3}}\n\nOthers have been fascinated by the possibilities of creating new languages that could enable new, and perhaps better, ways of thinking. Examples of such languages designed to explore the human mind include [[Loglan]], explicitly designed by [[James Cooke Brown]] to test the linguistic relativity hypothesis, by experimenting whether it would make its speakers think more logically.

Iverson]] believed that the Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis applied to computer languages (without actually mentioning it by name). His [[Turing award]] lecture, \"Notation as a tool of thought\", was devoted to this theme, arguing that more powerful notations aided thinking about computer algorithms.{{Non-primary source needed|date=July 2019}}<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://elliscave.com/APL_J/tool.pdf |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |volume=23 |issue=8 |pages=444\u2013465 |date=August 1980 |doi=10.1145/358896.358899 |title=Notation as a tool of thought |last1=Iverson |first1=Kenneth E. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710183418/http://elliscave.com/APL_J/tool.pdf |archivedate=10 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe essays of [[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]] explore similar themes, such as a conceptual hierarchy of computer languages, with more expressive and succinct languages at the top. Thus, the so-called [[Blub paradox|''blub'' paradox]] (after a hypothetical programming language of average complexity called ''Blub'') says that anyone preferentially using some particular programming language will ''know'' that it is more powerful than some, but not that it is less powerful than others. The reason is that ''writing'' in some language means ''thinking'' in that language. Hence the paradox, because typically programmers are \"satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because it dictates the way they think about programs\".{{sfn|Graham|2004}}\n\nIn a 2003 presentation at an [[Open-source software|open source]] convention, [[Yukihiro Matsumoto]], creator of the [[programming language]] [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], said that one of his inspirations for developing the language was the science fiction novel ''[[Babel-17]]'', based on the Sapir\u2013Whorf Hypothesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030811071449/http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/slides/oscon2003/mgp00001.html|title=The Power and Philosophy of Ruby (or, how to create Babel-17)}}</ref>\n\n=== In popular culture ===\n\n[[Ted Chiang]]'s short story ''[[Story of Your Life]]'' developed the concept of the Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis as applied to an alien species which visits Earth.

The distinction between a weak and a strong version of this hypothesis is also a later invention; Sapir and Whorf never set up such a dichotomy, although often their writings and their views of this relativity principle are phrased in stronger or weaker terms.{{sfn|Hill| Mannheim |1992}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Kennison |first=Shelia |year=2013 |title=Introduction to language development |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Sage }}</ref>\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe idea was first clearly expressed by 19th-century thinkers, such as [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], who saw language as the expression of the spirit of a nation. Members of the early 20th-century school of American anthropology headed by [[Franz Boas]] and Edward Sapir also embraced forms of the idea to a certain extent, including in a 1928 meeting of the Linguistic Society of America,{{sfn|Koerner|1992|page=180}} but Sapir in particular, wrote more often against than in favor of anything like [[linguistic determinism]]. Sapir's student, Benjamin Lee Whorf, came to be seen as the primary proponent as a result of his published observations of how he perceived linguistic differences to have consequences in human cognition and behavior. [[Harry Hoijer]], another of Sapir's students, introduced the term \"Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis\",<ref>\"The Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis\", in {{harvnb|Hoijer|1954|pp=92\u2013105}}.</ref> even though the two scholars never formally advanced any such hypothesis.<ref>This usage is now generally seen as a misnomer. As Jane Hill and Bruce Mannheim write: Yet, just as the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire the \"Sapir\u2013Whorf Hypothesis\" is neither consistent with the writings of Sapir and Whorf, nor a hypothesis {{harv|Hill| Mannheim |1992| p=386}}</ref> A strong version of relativist theory was developed from the late 1920s by the German linguist [[Leo Weisgerber]]. Whorf's principle of linguistic relativity was reformulated as a testable hypothesis by [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] and [[Eric Lenneberg]] who conducted experiments designed to find out whether [[color perception]] varies between speakers of languages that classified colors differently. As the study of the universal nature of human language and cognition came into focus in the 1960s the idea of linguistic relativity fell out of favor among linguists. A 1969 study by [[Brent Berlin]] and [[Paul Kay]] demonstrated the existence of universal semantic constraints in the field of colour terminology which were widely seen to discredit the existence of linguistic relativity in this domain, although this conclusion has been disputed by relativist researchers.\n\n=== Renewed examination ===\nFrom the late 1980s, a new school of linguistic relativity scholars has examined the effects of differences in linguistic categorization on cognition, finding broad support for non-deterministic versions of the hypothesis in experimental contexts.<ref name=\"Koerner\">Koerner, E.F.K. \"Towards a full pedigree of the Sapir\u2013Whorf Hypothesis: from Locke to Lucy\", chapter in {{harvnb|P\u00fctz|Verspoor|2000|p=17}}.</ref>{{sfn|Wolff|Holmes|2011}} Some effects of linguistic relativity have been shown in several semantic domains, although they are generally weak. Currently, a balanced view of linguistic relativity is espoused by most linguists holding that language influences certain kinds of cognitive processes in non-trivial ways, but that other processes are better seen as arising from [[Connectionism|connectionist]] factors. Research is focused on exploring the ways and extent to which language influences thought.<ref name=\"Koerner\" /> The principle of linguistic relativity and the relation between language and thought has also received attention in varying academic fields from [[philosophy]] to [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]], and it has also inspired and coloured works of fiction and the invention of [[constructed language]]s.\n\n== Forms ==\n\n=== Linguistic determinism ===\n{{Main|Linguistic determinism}}\n\nThe strongest form of the theory is linguistic determinism, which holds that language entirely determines the range of cognitive processes. The hypothesis of linguistic determinism is now generally agreed to be false.{{sfn|Ahearn|2011|page=69}}\n\n=== Linguistic influence ===\n\nThis is the weaker form, proposing that language provides constraints in some areas of cognition, but that it is by no means determinative. Research on weaker forms has produced positive [[empirical evidence]] for a relationship.{{sfn|Ahearn|2011|page=69}}\n\n== History ==\n\nThe idea that language and thought are intertwined is ancient. [[Plato]] argued against [[sophist]] thinkers such as [[Gorgias of Leontini]], who held that the physical world cannot be experienced except through language; this made the question of truth dependent on aesthetic preferences or functional consequences. Plato held instead that the world consisted of eternal ideas and that language should reflect these ideas as accurately as possible.<ref name=\"McComiskey2002\">{{cite book|first=Bruce |last=McComiskey|title=Gorgias and the New Sophistic Rhetoric|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=s3T6LYkGOqUC}}|year=2002|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=978-0-8093-2397-5}}</ref> Following Plato, [[St. Augustine]], for example, held the view that language was merely labels applied to already existing concepts. This view remained prevalent throughout the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Gumperz|Levinson|1996|p=2}} [[Roger Bacon]] held the opinion that language was but a veil covering up eternal truths, hiding them from human experience. For [[Immanuel Kant]], language was but one of several tools used by humans to experience the world.\n\n=== German Romantic philosophers ===\n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the idea of the existence of different national characters, or ''Volksgeister'', of different ethnic groups was the moving force behind the German romantics school and the beginning ideologies of ethnic nationalism.\n\nAlthough himself a Swede, [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] inspired several of the German Romantics. As early as 1749, he alludes to something along the lines of linguistic relativity in commenting on a passage in the table of nations in the book of Genesis: {{quote|\"Everyone according to his language, according to their families, as to their nations.\"[Genesis 10:5] This signifies that these were according to the genius of each;  \"according to their language,\" according to the opinion of each.... \"Language,\" in its inner meaning, signifies opinion, thus principles and persuasions. This is because there is a correspondence of the language with the intellectual part of man, or with his thought, like that of an effect with its cause.<ref>''Arcana Coelestia'' section 1059. http://smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ac&section=1059.</ref>}} In 1771 he spelled this out more explicitly: {{quote|There is a common genius prevailing among those who are subject to one king, and who consequently are under one constitutional law. Germany is divided into more governments than the neighboring kingdoms.... However, a common genius prevails everywhere among people speaking the same language.<ref>''True Christian Religion'' section 813. http://smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=tcr&section=813.</ref>}}\n[[File:WilhelmvonHumboldt.jpg|thumb|[[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]]]\n[[Johann Georg Hamann]] is often suggested to be the first among the actual German Romantics to speak of the concept of \"the genius of a language.\"<ref>Robert L. Miller ''The Linguistic Relativity Principle and Humboldtian Ethnolinguistics'' p. 18.</ref>{{sfn|McAfee|2004}} In his \"Essay Concerning an Academic Question,\" Hamann suggests that a people's language affects their worldview:\n{{quote|The lineaments of their language will thus correspond to the direction of their mentality.<ref>Quoted in Bernard D. Den Ouden, ''Language and Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Essay in Chomskyan Humanism,'' p. 25.</ref>}}\nIn 1820, [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] connected the study of language to the national romanticist program by proposing the view that language is the fabric of thought. Thoughts are produced as a kind of internal dialog using the same grammar as the thinker's native language.<ref name=\"Trabant\">Trabant, J\u00fcrgen. \"How relativistic are Humboldts \"Weltansichten\"?\", in {{harvnb|P\u00fctz|Verspoor|2000|p=}}.</ref> This view was part of a larger picture in which the world view of an ethnic nation, their \"[[world view|Weltanschauung]]\", was seen as being faithfully reflected in the grammar of their language. Von Humboldt argued that languages with an [[inflection]]al [[Morphological typology|morphological type]], such as German, English and the other [[Indo-European languages]], were the most perfect languages and that accordingly this explained the dominance of their speakers over the speakers of less perfect languages. Wilhelm von Humboldt declared in 1820:\n\n{{quote|The diversity of languages is not a diversity of signs and sounds but a diversity of views of the world.<ref name=\"Trabant\" />}}\n\n=== Boas and Sapir ===\n\n[[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|[[Franz Boas]]]]\n\n[[File:Edward Sapir.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Sapir]]]]\n\nThe idea that some languages are superior to others and that lesser languages maintained their speakers in intellectual poverty was widespread in the early 20th century{{sfn|Migge|L\u00e9glise|2007}}. American linguist [[William Dwight Whitney]], for example, actively strove to eradicate [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]], arguing that their speakers were savages and would be better off learning English and adopting a \"civilized\" way of life.{{sfn|Seuren|1998|p=180}} The first anthropologist and linguist to challenge this view was [[Franz Boas]].{{sfn|Seuren|1998|p=181}} While undertaking geographical research in northern Canada he became fascinated with the [[Inuit]] people and decided to become an [[Ethnography|ethnographer]]. Boas stressed the equal worth of all cultures and languages, that there was no such thing as a primitive language and that all languages were capable of expressing the same content, albeit by widely differing means. Boas saw language as an inseparable part of culture and he was among the first to require of ethnographers to learn the native language of the culture under study and to document verbal culture such as [[myth]]s and legends in the original language.\n\nBoas:\n\n{{quote|It does not seem likely [...] that there is any direct relation between the culture of a tribe and the language they speak, except in so far as the form of the language will be moulded by the state of the culture, but not in so far as a certain state of the culture is conditioned by the morphological traits of the language.\"<ref name=\"BOAS1911\">{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=EnZC68mmRhQC}}|last=Boas |first=Franz|year=1911|title=Handbook of American Indian languages|volume=1|publisher=Bureau of American Ethnology, Bulletin 40. Washington: Government Print Office (Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology).}}</ref>}}\n\nBoas' student Edward Sapir reached back to the Humboldtian idea that languages contained the key to understanding the world views of peoples. He espoused the viewpoint that because of the differences in the grammatical systems of languages no two languages were similar enough to allow for perfect cross-translation. Sapir also thought because language represented reality differently, it followed that the speakers of different languages would perceive reality differently.\n\nSapir:\n\n{{quote|No two languages are ever sufficiently similar to be considered as representing the same social reality. The worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same world with different labels attached.<ref>{{citation|last=Sapir |first=Edward|year=1929|title= The status of linguistics as a science|journal=Language|volume=5|doi=10.2307/409588|issue=4|pages=207\u2013214|jstor=409588|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-002C-4321-4}}</ref>}}\n\nOn the other hand, Sapir explicitly rejected strong [[linguistic determinism]] by stating, \"It would be na\u00efve to imagine that any analysis of experience is dependent on pattern expressed in language.\"<ref name=\"SapirSwadesh1946\">{{cite book|first1=Edward |last1=Sapir|first2=Morris |last2=Swadesh |authorlink1=Morris Swadesh|title=American Indian Grammatical Categories|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=wSYJMgEACAAJ|page=100}}|year=1946 |pp=100\u2013107}}</ref>\n\nSapir was explicit that the connections between language and culture were neither thoroughgoing nor particularly deep, if they existed at all:\n\n{{quote|It is easy to show that language and culture are not intrinsically associated. Totally unrelated languages share in one culture; closely related languages\u2014even a single language\u2014belong to distinct culture spheres. There are many excellent examples in Aboriginal America. The Athabaskan languages form as clearly unified, as structurally specialized, a group as any that I know of. The speakers of these languages belong to four distinct culture areas... The cultural adaptability of the Athabaskan-speaking peoples is in the strangest contrast to the inaccessibility to foreign influences of the languages themselves.{{sfn|Sapir|1921|p=213\u20134}}}}\n\nSapir offered similar observations about speakers of so-called \"world\" or [[modern language|\"modern\" languages]], noting, \"possession of a common language is still and will continue to be a smoother of the way to a mutual understanding between England and America, but it is very clear that other factors, some of them rapidly cumulative, are working powerfully to counteract this leveling influence. A common language cannot indefinitely set the seal on a common culture when the geographical, physical, and economics determinants of the culture are no longer the same throughout the area.\"{{sfn|Sapir|1921|p=215}}\n\nWhile Sapir never made a point of studying directly how languages affected thought, some notion of (probably \"weak\") linguistic relativity underlay his basic understanding of language, and would be taken up by Whorf.\n\nDrawing on influences such as Humboldt and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], some European thinkers developed ideas similar to those of Sapir and Whorf, generally working in isolation from each other. Prominent in Germany from the late 1920s through into the 1960s were the strongly relativist theories of [[Leo Weisgerber]] and his key concept of a 'linguistic inter-world', mediating between external reality and the forms of a given language, in ways peculiar to that language.<ref>For a critique of Weisgerber, see, for example: Beat Lehmann (1998), ''ROT ist nicht \u2033rot\u2033 ist nicht [rot].

His 1934 work \"''Thought and Language''\"<ref>Vygotsky, L. (1934/1986). Thought and language. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.</ref> has been compared to Whorf's and taken as mutually supportive evidence of language's influence on cognition.{{sfn|Lucy|Wertsch|1987}} Drawing on Nietzsche's ideas of perspectivism [[Alfred Korzybski]] developed the theory of [[general semantics]] that has been compared to Whorf's notions of linguistic relativity.{{sfn|Pula|1992}} Though influential in their own right, this work has not been influential in the debate on linguistic relativity, which has tended to center on the American paradigm exemplified by Sapir and Whorf.\n\n=== Benjamin Lee Whorf ===\n{{Main|Benjamin Lee Whorf}}\n\nMore than any linguist, Benjamin Lee Whorf has become associated with what he called the \"linguistic relativity principle\".{{sfn|Whorf|1956|p=214}} Studying [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] languages, he attempted to account for the ways in which grammatical systems and language use differences affected perception. Whorf also examined how a scientific account of the world differed from a religious account, which led him to study the original languages of religious scripture and to write several anti-[[evolution]]ist pamphlets.{{sfn|Whorf|1956}} Whorf's opinions regarding the nature of the relation between language and thought remain under contention. Critics such as Lenneberg, [[Max Black|Black]] and [[Steven Pinker|Pinker]] attribute to Whorf a strong linguistic determinism, while [[John A. Lucy|Lucy]], [[Michael Silverstein|Silverstein]] and [[Stephen C. Levinson|Levinson]] point to Whorf's explicit rejections of determinism, and where he contends that translation and commensuration is possible.\n\nAlthough Whorf lacked an advanced degree in linguistics, his reputation reflects his acquired competence. His peers at [[Yale University]] considered the 'amateur' Whorf to be the best man available to take over Sapir's graduate seminar in Native American linguistics while Sapir was on sabbatical in 1937\u201338.{{sfn|Darnell|1990|p=380-81}} He was highly regarded by authorities such as Boas, Sapir, [[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfield]] and [[Alfred M. Tozzer|Tozzer]]. Indeed, [[John A. Lucy|Lucy]] wrote, \"despite his 'amateur' status, Whorf's work in linguistics was and still is recognized as being of superb professional quality by linguists\".{{sfn|Lucy|1992b|p=25}}\n\nDetractors such as Lenneberg, [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] and [[Steven Pinker|Pinker]] criticized him for insufficient clarity in his description of how language influences thought, and for not proving his conjectures. Most of his arguments were in the form of anecdotes and speculations that served as attempts to show how 'exotic' grammatical traits were connected to what were apparently equally exotic worlds of thought. In Whorf's words:\n\n{{quote|We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native language. The categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not find there because they stare every observer in the face; on the contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscope flux of impressions which has to be organized by our minds\u2014and this means largely by the linguistic systems of our minds. We cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this way\u2014an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our language [...] all observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the universe, unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar, or can in some way be calibrated.{{sfn|Whorf|1956|p=212\u2013214}}}}\n\n[[File:Whorf Shawnee Example.png|400px|thumb|Whorf's illustration of the difference between the English and Shawnee gestalt construction of cleaning a gun with a ramrod. From the article \"Science and Linguistics\", originally published in the ''MIT Technology Review'', 1940.]]\n\nAmong Whorf's best-known examples of linguistic relativity are instances where an indigenous language has several terms for a concept that is only described with one word in European languages (Whorf used the acronym SAE \"[[Standard Average European]]\" to allude to the rather similar grammatical structures of the well-studied European languages in contrast to the greater diversity of less-studied languages).\n\nOne of Whorf's examples was the supposedly large number of words for [[Eskimo words for snow|'snow' in the Inuit language]], an example which later was contested as a misrepresentation.{{sfn|Pullum|1991}}\n\nAnother is the [[Hopi language]]'s words for water, one indicating drinking water in a container and another indicating a natural body of water. These examples of [[polysemy]] served the double purpose of showing that indigenous languages sometimes made more fine grained semantic distinctions than European languages and that direct translation between two languages, even of seemingly basic concepts such as snow or water, is not always possible.\n\nAnother example is from Whorf's experience as a chemical engineer working for an insurance company as a fire inspector.{{sfn|Pullum|1991}} While inspecting a chemical plant he observed that the plant had two storage rooms for gasoline barrels, one for the full barrels and one for the empty ones. He further noticed that while no employees smoked cigarettes in the room for full barrels, no-one minded smoking in the room with empty barrels, although this was potentially much more dangerous because of the highly flammable vapors still in the barrels. He concluded that the use of the word ''empty'' in connection to the barrels had led the workers to unconsciously regard them as harmless, although consciously they were probably aware of the risk of explosion. This example was later criticized by Lenneberg{{sfn|Lenneberg|1953}} as not actually demonstrating causality between the use of the word ''empty'' and the action of smoking, but instead was an example of [[circular reasoning]]. Pinker in ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' ridiculed this example, claiming that this was a failing of human insight rather than language.\n\nWhorf's most elaborate argument for linguistic relativity regarded what he believed to be a fundamental difference in the understanding of [[Hopi time controversy|time as a conceptual category among the Hopi]].{{sfn|Whorf|1956}} He argued that in contrast to English and other [[Standard Average European|SAE languages]], Hopi does not treat the flow of time as a sequence of distinct, countable instances, like \"three days\" or \"five years,\" but rather as a single process and that consequently it has no nouns referring to units of time as SAE speakers understand them. He proposed that this view of time was fundamental to [[Hopi]] culture and explained certain Hopi behavioral patterns. Malotki later claimed that he had found no evidence of Whorf's claims in 1980's era speakers, nor in historical documents dating back to the arrival of Europeans. Malotki used evidence from archaeological data, calendars, historical documents, modern speech and concluded that there was no evidence that Hopi conceptualize time in the way Whorf suggested. Universalist scholars such as Pinker often see Malotki's study as a final refutation of Whorf's claim about Hopi, whereas relativist scholars such as [[John A Lucy|Lucy]] and Penny Lee criticized Malotki's study for mischaracterizing Whorf's claims and for forcing Hopi grammar into a model of analysis that doesn't fit the data.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|1996}}, {{harvnb|Leavitt|2011|pp=179\u2013187}}, {{harvnb|Lucy|1992b|p=286}}, {{harvnb|Lucy|1996|p=43}}, {{harvnb|Dinwoodie|2006}}.</ref>\n\nWhorf died in 1941 at age 44, leaving multiple unpublished papers. His line of thought was continued by linguists and anthropologists such as Hoijer and [[Dorothy D. Lee|Lee]] who both continued investigations into the effect of language on habitual thought, and [[George L. Trager|Trager]], who prepared a number of Whorf's papers for posthumous publishing. The most important event for the dissemination of Whorf's ideas to a larger public was the publication in 1956 of his major writings on the topic of linguistic relativity in a single volume titled ''Language, Thought and Reality''.\n\n=== Eric Lenneberg ===\n\nIn 1953, [[Eric Lenneberg]] criticised Whorf's examples from an objectivist view of language holding that languages are principally meant to represent events in the real world and that even though languages express these ideas in various ways, the meanings of such expressions and therefore the thoughts of the speaker are equivalent. He argued that Whorf's English descriptions of a Hopi speaker's view of time were in fact translations of the Hopi concept into English, therefore disproving linguistic relativity. However Whorf was concerned with how the habitual ''use'' of language influences habitual behavior, rather than translatability. Whorf's point was that while English speakers may be able to ''understand'' how a Hopi speaker thinks, they do not ''think'' in that way.{{sfn|Lakoff|1987|p=}}\n\nLenneberg's main criticism of Whorf's works was that he never showed the connection between a linguistic phenomenon and a mental phenomenon. With Brown, Lenneberg proposed that proving such a connection required directly matching linguistic phenomena with behavior. They assessed linguistic relativity experimentally and published their findings in 1954.\n\nSince neither Sapir nor Whorf had ever stated a formal hypothesis, Brown and Lenneberg formulated their own. Their two tenets were (i) \"the world is differently experienced and conceived in different linguistic communities\" and (ii) \"language causes a particular cognitive structure\".{{sfn|Brown|Lenneberg|1954|p=455,457}} Brown later developed them into the so-called \"weak\" and \"strong\" formulation:\n\n<blockquote>\n* Structural differences between language systems will, in general, be paralleled by nonlinguistic cognitive differences, of an unspecified sort, in the native speakers of the language.\n* The structure of anyone's native language strongly influences or fully determines the worldview he will acquire as he learns the language.{{sfn|Brown|1976|p=128}}</blockquote>\n\nBrown's formulations became widely known and were retrospectively attributed to Whorf and Sapir although the second formulation, verging on linguistic determinism, was never advanced by either of them.\n\nSince Brown and Lenneberg believed that the objective reality denoted by language was the same for speakers of all languages, they decided to test how different languages codified the same message differently and whether differences in codification could be proven to affect behavior.\n\nThey designed experiments involving the codification of colors. In their first experiment, they investigated whether it was easier for speakers of English to remember color shades for which they had a specific name than to remember colors that were not as easily definable by words. This allowed them to compare the linguistic categorization directly to a non-linguistic task. In a later experiment, speakers of two languages that categorize colors differently ([[English language|English]] and [[Zuni language|Zuni]]) were asked to recognize colors. In this way, it could be determined whether the differing color categories of the two speakers would determine their ability to recognize nuances within color categories. Brown and Lenneberg found that Zu\u00f1i speakers who [[Distinguishing blue from green in language|classify green and blue together]] as a single color did have trouble recognizing and remembering nuances within the green/blue category.{{sfn|D'Andrade|1995|p= 185}} Brown and Lenneberg's study began a tradition of investigation of linguistic relativity through color terminology.\n\n=== Universalist period ===\n{{Main|Universalism |Universalism and relativism of color terminology}}\n\nLenneberg was also one of the first cognitive scientists to begin development of the Universalist theory of language that was formulated by Chomsky in the form of [[Universal Grammar]], effectively arguing that all languages share the same underlying structure. The Chomskyan school also holds the belief that linguistic structures are largely innate and that what are perceived as differences between specific languages are surface phenomena that do not affect the brain's universal cognitive processes. This theory became the dominant paradigm in American linguistics from the 1960s through the 1980s, while linguistic relativity became the object of ridicule.{{sfn|Gumperz|Levinson|1996|p=3, 6}}\n\nExamples of universalist influence in the 1960s are the studies by [[Brent Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Paul Kay|Kay]] who continued Lenneberg's color research. They studied color terminology formation and showed clear universal trends in color naming. For example, they found that even though languages have different color terminologies, they generally recognize certain hues as more focal than others. They showed that in languages with few color terms, it is predictable from the number of terms which hues are chosen as focal colors, for example, languages with only three color terms always have the focal colors black, white and red.{{sfn|Berlin|Kay|1969}} The fact that what had been believed to be random differences between color naming in different languages could be shown to follow universal patterns was seen as a powerful argument against linguistic relativity.{{sfn|Gumperz|Levinson|1996|p=6}} Berlin and Kay's research has since been criticized by relativists such as Lucy, who argued that Berlin and Kay's conclusions were skewed by their insistence that color terms encode only color information.{{sfn|Lucy|1992a}} This, Lucy argues, made them blind to the instances in which color terms provided other information that might be considered examples of linguistic relativity.\n\nOther universalist researchers dedicated themselves to dispelling other aspects of linguistic relativity, often attacking Whorf's specific points and examples. For example, Malotki's monumental study of time expressions in Hopi presented many examples that challenged Whorf's \"timeless\" interpretation of Hopi language and culture,{{sfn|Malotki|1983}} but seemingly failed to address linguistic relativist argument actually posed by Whorf (i.e. that the understanding of time by native Hopi speakers differed from that of speakers of European languages due to the differences in the organization and construction of their respective languages; Whorf never claimed that Hopi speakers lacked any concept of time).{{sfn|Lucy|1996}} Malotki himself acknowledges that the conceptualizations are different, but because he ignores Whorf's use of scare quotes around the word \"time\" and the qualifier \"what we call,\" takes Whorf to be arguing that the Hopi have no concept of time at all.{{sfn|Lucy|1992b|p=286}}{{sfn|Leavitt|2011|p=180}}{{sfn|Levinson|2012|p=xii}}\n\nToday many followers of the universalist school of thought still oppose linguistic relativity. For example, Pinker argues in ''The Language Instinct'' that thought is independent of language, that language is itself meaningless in any fundamental way to human thought, and that human beings do not even think in \"natural\" language, i.e. any language that we actually communicate in; rather, we think in a meta-language, preceding any natural language, called \"mentalese.\" Pinker attacks what he calls \"Whorf's radical position,\" declaring, \"the more you examine Whorf's arguments, the less sense they make.\"{{sfn|Pinker|1994|p=60}}\n\nPinker and other universalists have been accused by relativists of misrepresenting Whorf's views and arguing against [[Strawman fallacy|strawmen]].{{sfn|Casasanto|2008|p=}}{{sfn|Lucy|1992a|p=}}{{sfn|Lakoff|1987|p=}}\n\n=== Joshua Fishman's \"Whorfianism of the third kind\" ===\n\n[[Joshua Aaron Fishman|Joshua Fishman]] argued that Whorf's true position was largely overlooked. In 1978, he suggested that Whorf was a \"neo-[[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herderian]] champion\"{{sfn|Fishman|1978}} and in 1982, he proposed \"Whorfianism of the third kind\" in an attempt to refocus linguists' attention on what he claimed was Whorf's real interest, namely the intrinsic value of \"little peoples\" and \"little languages\".{{sfn|Fishman|1982|p=5}} Whorf had criticized [[Charles Kay Ogden|Ogden]]'s [[Basic English]] thus:\n\n{{quote|But to restrict thinking to the patterns merely of English [\u2026] is to lose a power of thought which, once lost, can never be regained. It is the 'plainest' English which contains the greatest number of unconscious assumptions about nature. [\u2026] We handle even our plain English with much greater effect if we direct it from the vantage point of a multilingual awareness.{{sfn|Whorf|1956|p=244}}}}\n\nWhere Brown's weak version of the linguistic relativity hypothesis proposes that language ''influences'' thought and the strong version that language ''determines'' thought, Fishman's 'Whorfianism of the third kind' proposes that language ''is a key to culture''.\n\n=== Cognitive linguistics ===\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, advances in [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive linguistics]] renewed interest in the Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis.{{sfn|Seidner|1982}} One of those who adopted a more Whorfian approach was [[George Lakoff]]. He argued that language is often used metaphorically and that languages use different [[conceptual metaphor|cultural metaphors]] that reveal something about how speakers of that language think. For example, English employs conceptual metaphors likening time with money, so that time can be saved and spent and invested, whereas other languages do not talk about time in that way. Other such metaphors are common to many languages because they are based on general human experience, for example, metaphors likening ''up'' with ''good'' and ''bad'' with ''down''. Lakoff also argued that metaphor plays an important part in political debates such as the \"right to life\" or the \"right to choose\"; or \"illegal aliens\" or \"undocumented workers\".\n\n==== Parameters ====\nIn his book ''Women, Fire and Dangerous things: What categories reveal about the mind,''{{sfn|Lakoff|1987}} Lakoff reappraised linguistic relativity and especially Whorf's views about how linguistic categorization reflects and/or influences mental categories. He concluded that the debate had been confused. He described four parameters on which researchers differed in their opinions about what constitutes linguistic relativity:\n* The degree and depth of linguistic relativity. Perhaps a few examples of superficial differences in language and associated behavior are enough to demonstrate the existence of linguistic relativity. Alternatively, perhaps only deep differences that permeate the linguistic and cultural system suffice.\n* Whether conceptual systems are absolute or whether they can evolve\n* Whether the similarity criterion is translatability or the use of linguistic expressions\n* Whether the focus of linguistic relativity is in language or in the brain\nLakoff concluded that many of Whorf's critics had criticized him using novel definitions of linguistic relativity, rendering their criticisms moot.\n\n==== ''Rethinking Linguistic Relativity'' ====\nThe publication of the 1996 anthology ''Rethinking Linguistic Relativity'' edited by [[John J. Gumperz|Gumperz]] and [[Stephen C. Levinson|Levinson]] began a new period of linguistic relativity studies that focused on cognitive and social aspects. The book included studies on the linguistic relativity and universalist traditions. Levinson documented significant linguistic relativity effects in the linguistic conceptualization of spatial categories between languages. For example, men speaking the [[Guugu Yimithirr language]] in [[Queensland]] gave accurate navigation instructions using a compass-like system of north, south, east and west, along with a hand gesture pointing to the starting direction.{{sfn|Levinson|1998|p=13}}\n\nSeparate studies by [[Melissa Bowerman|Bowerman]] and [[Dan Slobin|Slobin]] treated the role of language in cognitive processes. Bowerman showed that certain cognitive processes did not use language to any significant extent and therefore could not be subject to linguistic relativity. Slobin described another kind of cognitive process that he named \"thinking for speaking\" \u2013 the kind of process in which perceptional data and other kinds of prelinguistic cognition are translated into linguistic terms for communication. These, Slobin argues, are the kinds of cognitive process that are at the root of linguistic relativity.\n\n=== Refinements ===\n\nResearchers such as [[Lera Boroditsky|Boroditsky]], Lucy and Levinson believe that language influences thought in more limited ways than the broadest early claims. Researchers examine the interface between thought (or cognition), language and culture and describe the relevant influences. They use experimental data to back up their conclusions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gentner|first1=Dedre|last2=Boroditsky|first2=Lera|editor=Melissa Bowerman and Stephen Levinson|title=Language Acquisition and Conceptual Development|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-59659-6|pages=215\u2013256|chapter=Individuation, relativity, and early word development}}</ref><ref name=\"Levinson2001\">{{cite book|last=Levinson|first=Stephen|editor=Melissa Bowerman and Stephen Levinson|title=Language Acquisition and Conceptual Development|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-59659-6|pages=566\u2013588|chapter=Covariation between spatial language and cognition, and its implications for language learning}}</ref> Kay ultimately concluded that \"[the] Whorf hypothesis is supported in the right visual field but not the left\".<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Gilbert\n| first = Aubrey L.\n| last2 = Regier\n| first2 = Terry\n| last3 = Kay\n| first3 = Paul\n| last4 = Ivry\n| first4 = Richard B.\n| date = 10 January 2006\n| title = Whorf hypothesis is supported in the right visual field but not the left\n| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America\n| language = en\n| volume = 103\n| issue = 2\n| pages = 489\u2013494\n| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0509868103\n| issn = 0027-8424\n| pmc = 1326182\n| pmid = 16387848\n| bibcode = 2006PNAS..103..489G\n}}</ref> His findings show that accounting for [[brain lateralization]] offers another perspective.\n\n[[psycholinguistics|Psycholinguistic]] studies explored motion perception, emotion perception, object representation and memory.<ref name=\"HickmannRobert2006\">{{cite book|first1=Maya |last1=Hickmann|first2=St\u00e9phane |last2=Robert|title=Space in Languages: Linguistic Systems and Cognitive Categories|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=naZ_bZHEs4IC|page=281}}|date=16 May 2006|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=978-90-272-9355-8|pages=281\u2013308|chapter=The relativity of motion in first language acquisition}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Perlovsky|first1=Leonid|title=Language and emotions: Emotional Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis|journal=Neural Networks|volume=22|issue=5\u20136|year=2009|pages=518\u2013526|issn=0893-6080|doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2009.06.034|pmid=19616406}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Linguistic Relativity in Japanese and English: Is Language the Primary Determinant in Object Classification?|last1=Mazuka|first1=Reiko |last2=Friedman|first2=Ronald S.|journal=Journal of East Asian Linguistics|volume=9|issue=4|year=2000|pages=353\u2013377|issn=0925-8558|doi=10.1023/A:1008356620617}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pavlenko|first1=A.|title=Eyewitness memory in late bilinguals: Evidence for discursive relativity|journal=International Journal of Bilingualism|volume=7|issue=3|year=2003|pages=257\u2013281|issn=1367-0069|doi=10.1177/13670069030070030301|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5f54cd91169f01b02d59ee44cdfdd0f2d3ebd992}}</ref> The gold standard of psycholinguistic studies on linguistic relativity is now finding non-linguistic cognitive differences in speakers of different languages (thus rendering inapplicable Pinker's criticism that linguistic relativity is \"circular\").\n\nRecent work with [[bilingual]] speakers attempts to distinguish the effects of language from those of culture on bilingual cognition including perceptions of time, space, motion, colors and emotion.<ref>{{harvnb|Pavlenko|1999}}, {{harvnb|Cook|Bassetti|2010}}, {{harvnb|Athanasopoulos|2009}}, {{harvnb|Phillips|Boroditsky|2003}}.</ref> Researchers described differences between bilinguals and [[monolingual]]s in perception of color,{{sfn|Andrews|1994}} representations of time{{sfn|Boroditsky|Ham|Ramscar|2002}} and other elements of cognition.\n\n== Empirical research ==\n\nLucy identified three main strands of research into linguistic relativity.{{sfn|Lucy|1997}}\n\n=== Structure-centered ===\nThe \"structure-centered\" approach starts with a language's structural peculiarity and examines its possible ramifications for thought and behavior. The defining example is Whorf's observation of discrepancies between the grammar of time expressions in Hopi and English. More recent research in this vein is Lucy's research describing how usage of the categories of grammatical number and of numeral classifiers in the [[Mayan languages|Mayan language]] [[Yucatec Maya|Yucatec]] result in Mayan speakers classifying objects according to material rather than to shape as preferred by English speakers.{{sfn|Lucy|1992b|p=}}\n\n=== Domain-centered ===\nThe \"domain-centered\" approach selects a semantic domain and compares it across linguistic and cultural groups. It centered on color terminology, although this domain is acknowledged to be sub-optimal, because color perception, unlike other semantic domains, is hardwired into the neural system and as such is subject to more universal restrictions than other semantic domains.\n\nSpace is another semantic domain that has proven fruitful for linguistic relativity studies.{{sfn|Lucy|1997|p=301}} Spatial categories vary greatly across languages. Speakers rely on the linguistic conceptualization of space in performing many ordinary tasks. Levinson and others reported three basic spatial categorizations. While many languages use combinations of them, some languages exhibit only one type and related behaviors. For example, [[Guugu Yimithirr language|Yimithirr]] only uses absolute directions when describing spatial relations&nbsp;\u2014 the position of everything is described by using the cardinal directions. Speakers define a location as \"north of the house\", while an English speaker may use relative positions, saying \"in front of the house\" or \"to the left of the house\".{{sfn|Levinson|1996}}\n\n=== Behavior-centered ===\nThe \"behavior centered\" approach starts by comparing behavior across linguistic groups and then searches for causes for that behavior in the linguistic system. Whorf attributed the occurrence of fires at a chemical plant to the workers' use of the word 'empty' to describe the barrels containing only explosive vapors. Bloom noticed that speakers of Chinese had unexpected difficulties answering counter-factual questions posed to them in a questionnaire. He concluded that this was related to the way in which counter-factuality is marked grammatically in Chinese. Other researchers attributed this result to Bloom's flawed translations.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(84)90012-X|title = Counterfactuals: In reply to Alfred Bloom|journal = Cognition|volume = 17|issue = 3|pages = 289\u2013302|year = 1984|last1 = Au|first1 = T.}}</ref> Str\u00f8mnes examined why Finnish factories had a higher occurrence of work related accidents than similar Swedish ones.

The study focused on three groups, those who spoke only Swedish, those who spoke only Spanish and bilingual speakers who spoke both of those languages. Swedish speakers describe time using distance terms like \"long\" or \"short\" while Spanish speakers do it using volume related terms like \"big\" or \"small\". The researchers asked the participants to estimate how much time had passed while watching a line growing across a screen, or a container being filled, or both. The researchers stated that \"When reproducing duration, Swedish speakers were misled by stimulus length, and Spanish speakers were misled by stimulus size/quantity.\" When the bilinguals were prompted with the word \"duraci\u00f3n\" (the Spanish word for duration) they based their time estimates of how full the containers were, ignoring the growing lines.

The studies showed a correlation between color term numbers and ease of recall in both Zuni and English speakers. Researchers attributed this to focal colors having higher codability than less focal colors, and not with linguistic relativity effects. Berlin/Kay found universal typological color principles that are determined by biological rather than linguistic factors.{{sfn|Berlin|Kay|1969}} This study sparked studies into typological universals of color terminology.

The innate view holds that humans share the same set of basic faculties, and that variability due to cultural differences is less important and that the human mind is a mostly biological construction, so that all humans sharing the same neurological configuration can be expected to have similar cognitive patterns.\n\nMultiple alternatives have advocates. The contrary [[Social constructivism|constructivist]] position holds that human faculties and concepts are largely influenced by socially constructed and learned categories, without many biological restrictions. Another variant is [[idealist]], which holds that human mental capacities are generally unrestricted by biological-material strictures. Another is [[essentialism|essentialist]], which holds that essential differences{{clarify|reason=what essential differences|date=May 2017}} may influence the ways individuals or groups experience and conceptualize the world. Yet another is [[relativist]] ([[Cultural relativism]]), which sees different cultural groups as employing different conceptual schemes that are not necessarily compatible or commensurable, nor more or less in accord with external reality.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011}}\n\nAnother debate considers whether thought is a form of internal speech or is independent of and prior to language.<ref>{{cite book |last=Raykowski |first=Wes |date=2014|title=Conceptual Understructure of Human Experience: Volume 1 (Thesis)}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[philosophy of language]] the question addresses the relations between language, knowledge and the external world, and the concept of [[truth]]. Philosophers such as [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]], [[Jerry Fodor|Fodor]], Davidson, and [[Daniel Dennett|Dennett]] see language as representing directly entities from the objective world and that categorization reflect that world. Other philosophers (e.g. [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], Searle, [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]) argue that categorization and conceptualization is subjective and arbitrary.\n\nAnother question is whether language is a tool for representing and referring to objects in the world, or whether it is a system used to construct mental representations that can be communicated.{{clarify|reason=what is the relevance of this in the local context? Is this a true dichotomy?|date=May 2017}}\n\n=== Therapy and self-development ===\n{{Main|General semantics|Neurolinguistic Programming}}\n\nSapir/Whorf contemporary [[Alfred Korzybski]] was independently developing his theory of [[general semantics]], which was aimed at using language's influence on thinking to maximize human cognitive abilities. Korzybski's thinking was influenced by logical philosophy such as [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead's]] ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' and Wittgenstein's ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''.<ref name=\"Korzybski1949\">{{cite book|first=Alfred |last=Korzybski|title=Time-binding: The General Theory : Two Papers 1924\u20131926|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=3BvXAAAAMAAJ|page=5}}|year=1949|publisher=Institute of General Semantics|pages=(5), 54}}</ref> Although Korzybski was not aware of Sapir and Whorf's writings, the movement was followed by Whorf-admirer Stuart Chase, who fused Whorf's interest in cultural-linguistic variation with Korzybski's programme in his popular work \"''The Tyranny of Words''\". [[S. I. Hayakawa]] was a follower and popularizer of Korzybski's work, writing ''[[Language in Thought and Action]]''.

In Rand's [[Anthem (novella)|''Anthem'']], a fictive [[communist]] society removed the possibility of individualism by removing the word \"I\" from the language.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In Orwell's ''[[1984 (book)|1984]]'' the authoritarian state created the language [[Newspeak]] to make it impossible for people to think critically about the government, or even to contemplate that they might be impoverished or oppressed, by reducing the number of words to reduce the thought of the locutor.{{sfn|Pinker|1994|loc=chap. 3}}\n\nOthers have been fascinated by the possibilities of creating new languages that could enable new, and perhaps better, ways of thinking. Examples of such languages designed to explore the human mind include [[Loglan]], explicitly designed by [[James Cooke Brown]] to test the linguistic relativity hypothesis, by experimenting whether it would make its speakers think more logically. Speakers of [[Lojban]], an evolution of Loglan, report that they feel speaking the language enhances their ability for logical thinking{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}.

Iverson]] believed that the Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis applied to computer languages (without actually mentioning it by name). His [[Turing award]] lecture, \"Notation as a tool of thought\", was devoted to this theme, arguing that more powerful notations aided thinking about computer algorithms.{{Non-primary source needed|date=July 2019}}<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://elliscave.com/APL_J/tool.pdf |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |volume=23 |issue=8 |pages=444\u2013465 |date=August 1980 |doi=10.1145/358896.358899 |title=Notation as a tool of thought |last1=Iverson |first1=Kenneth E. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710183418/http://elliscave.com/APL_J/tool.pdf |archivedate=10 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe essays of [[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]] explore similar themes, such as a conceptual hierarchy of computer languages, with more expressive and succinct languages at the top. Thus, the so-called [[Blub paradox|''blub'' paradox]] (after a hypothetical programming language of average complexity called ''Blub'') says that anyone preferentially using some particular programming language will ''know'' that it is more powerful than some, but not that it is less powerful than others. The reason is that ''writing'' in some language means ''thinking'' in that language. Hence the paradox, because typically programmers are \"satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because it dictates the way they think about programs\".{{sfn|Graham|2004}}\n\nIn a 2003 presentation at an [[Open-source software|open source]] convention, [[Yukihiro Matsumoto]], creator of the [[programming language]] [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], said that one of his inspirations for developing the language was the science fiction novel ''[[Babel-17]]'', based on the Sapir\u2013Whorf Hypothesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030811071449/http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/slides/oscon2003/mgp00001.html|title=The Power and Philosophy of Ruby (or, how to create Babel-17)}}</ref>\n\n=== In popular culture ===\n\n[[Ted Chiang]]'s short story ''[[Story of Your Life]]'' developed the concept of the Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis as applied to an alien species which visits Earth.

{"title_page": "Johann Caspar von Orelli", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=August 2008}}\n\n[[Image:Johann Caspar von Orelli.jpg|thumb|Portrait by Ludwig Wegner]]\n'''Johann Caspar von Orelli''' (13 February 1787&ndash;6 January 1849), was a  [[Switzerland|Swiss]] classical scholar.\n\nHe was born at [[Z\u00fcrich]] of a distinguished Italian family which had taken refuge in Switzerland at the time of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. His cousin, Johann Conrad Orelli (1770\u20131826), was the author of several works in the department of later [[Greek literature]].\n\nFrom 1807 to 1814 Orelli worked as preacher in the reformed community of [[Bergamo]], where he acquired the taste for [[Italian literature]] which led to the publication of ''Contributions to the History of Italian Poetry'' (1810) and a biography (1812) of [[Vittorino da Feltre]], his ideal of a teacher.\n\nIn 1814 he became teacher of modern languages and history at the cantonal school at [[Chur]]; in 1819, professor of eloquence and [[hermeneutics]] at the [[Carolinum, Z\u00fcrich]], and in 1833 professor at the new [[University of Z\u00fcrich]], the foundation of which was largely due to his efforts. His attention during this period was mainly devoted to classical literature and antiquities. He had already published (1814) an edition, with critical notes and commentary, of the ''[[Antidosis]]'' of [[Isocrates]], the complete text of which, based upon the manuscripts in the Ambrosian and Laurentian libraries, had been made known by [[Andreas Mustoxydis]] of [[Corfu]].\n\nThe three works upon which his reputation rests are the following:\n#A complete edition of [[Cicero]] in seven volumes (1826\u20131838). The first four volumes contained the text (new ed., 1845\u20131863), the fifth the old Scholiasts, the remaining three (called ''Onomasticon Tullianum'') a life of Cicero, a bibliography of previous editions, indexes of geographical and historical names, of laws and legal formulae, of Greek words, and the consular annals. After his death, the revised edition of the text was completed by [[Johann Georg Baiter|J.G. Baiter]] and [[Karl Felix Halm|K. Halm]], and contained numerous emendations by [[Theodor Mommsen]] and [[Johan Nicolai Madvig|J.N. Madvig]].\n#''The works of [[Horace]]'' (1837\u20131838). The exegetical commentary, although confessedly only a compilation from the works of earlier commentators, shows great taste and extensive learning, although hardly up to the exacting standard of modern criticism.\n#''Inscriptionum Latinarum Selectarum Collectio'' (1828; revised edition by [[Wilhelm Henzen]], 1856), extremely helpful for the study of Roman public and private life and religion. His editions of [[Plato]] (1839\u20131841, including the old ''scholia'', in collaboration with [[A. W.

His cousin, Johann Conrad Orelli (1770\u20131826), was the author of several works in the department of later [[Greek literature]].\n\nFrom 1807 to 1814 Orelli worked as preacher in the reformed community of [[Bergamo]], where he acquired the taste for [[Italian literature]] which led to the publication of ''Contributions to the History of Italian Poetry'' (1810) and a biography (1812) of [[Vittorino da Feltre]], his ideal of a teacher.\n\nIn 1814 he became teacher of modern languages and history at the cantonal school at [[Chur]]; in 1819, professor of eloquence and [[hermeneutics]] at the [[Carolinum, Z\u00fcrich]], and in 1833 professor at the new [[University of Z\u00fcrich]], the foundation of which was largely due to his efforts. His attention during this period was mainly devoted to classical literature and antiquities. He had already published (1814) an edition, with critical notes and commentary, of the ''[[Antidosis]]'' of [[Isocrates]], the complete text of which, based upon the manuscripts in the Ambrosian and Laurentian libraries, had been made known by [[Andreas Mustoxydis]] of [[Corfu]].\n\nThe three works upon which his reputation rests are the following:\n#A complete edition of [[Cicero]] in seven volumes (1826\u20131838). The first four volumes contained the text (new ed., 1845\u20131863), the fifth the old Scholiasts, the remaining three (called ''Onomasticon Tullianum'') a life of Cicero, a bibliography of previous editions, indexes of geographical and historical names, of laws and legal formulae, of Greek words, and the consular annals. After his death, the revised edition of the text was completed by [[Johann Georg Baiter|JG Baiter]] and [[Karl Felix Halm|K Halm]], and contained numerous emendations by [[Theodor Mommsen]] and [[Johan Nicolai Madvig|JN Madvig]].\n#''The works of [[Horace]]'' (1837\u20131838). The exegetical commentary, although confessedly only a compilation from the works of earlier commentators, shows great taste and extensive learning, although hardly up to the exacting standard of modern criticism.\n#''Inscriptionum Latinarum Selectarum Collectio'' (1828; revised edition by [[Wilhelm Henzen]], 1856), extremely helpful for the study of Roman public and private life and religion. His editions of [[Plato]] (1839\u20131841, including the old ''scholia'', in collaboration with [[A. W. Winckelmann]]) and [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] (1846\u20131848) also deserve mention.\n\nHe was a most liberal-minded man, both in politics and religion, an enthusiastic supporter of popular education and a most inspiring teacher. He took great interest in the struggle of the Greeks for independence, and strongly favoured the appointment of the notorious [[David Strauss]] to the chair of [[dogmatic theology]] at Z\u00fcrich, which led to the disturbance of September 6, 1839 and the fall of the liberal government.\n\n==References==\n* ''Life'' by his younger brother Conrad in ''Neujahrsblatt der Stadtbibliothek Z\u00fcrich'' (1851)\n*[[Jacques Adert]], ''Essai sur la Vie el les Travaux de J.C.O.''

However, after losing a [[2019 Israeli Labor Party leadership election|Labor leadership election]] to [[Amir Peretz]] in June 2019, she left the party and resigned from the Knesset and became head of the Green Movement.

His aggressive and insubordinate attitude exacerbated the [[Soviet\u2013Japanese border conflicts]], and helped incite to the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]] in 1939.<ref name=\"Coox\">[[Alvin Coox|Coox, Alvin D.]] ''Nomonhan: Japan Against Russia, 1939'', {{ISBN|0-8047-1835-0}}</ref>\n\nAfter the defeat at Khalkhin Gol, Tsuji opposed any further conflicts with the USSR. After their attack on the USSR in 1941, the Germans urged the Japanese to join the invasion, and many in the Japanese military wanted to avenge the defeat at Khalkhin Gol. Yet Tsuji was an influential advocate of the attack on the United States. General [[Ry\u016bkichi Tanaka|Ryukichi Tanaka]] testified after the war that, \"the most determined single protagonist in favor of war with the United States was Tsuji Masanobu.\" Tsuji later wrote that his experience of Soviet fire-power at Khalkhin Gol convinced him not to attack the Soviet Union in 1941.<ref name=\"thediplomat.com\">{{cite news|first=Stuart|last=Goldman|url=http://thediplomat.com/2012/08/the-forgotten-soviet-japanese-war-of-1939/?allpages=yes|title=The Forgotten Soviet-Japanese War of 1939|work=[[The Diplomat]]|date=August 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nHis protectors in the Army got him safely transferred to [[Taiwan]], where he helped organize the Army's jungle warfare school. He was then assigned to the Operations Section of the General staff, where he became a strong advocate of war with the United States and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. It has been alleged that in late 1941, he planned the assassination of [[Fumimaro Konoe|Prime Minister Konoye]], if Konoye achieved peace with the U.S.<ref name=\"KGB\"/>\n\nTsuji planned the Japanese overland attack in [[New Guinea]], via the [[Kokoda Trail]]. In this as in other operations, he ordered bold offensive moves regardless of difficulties or the costs to the troops involved.\n\nIn late 1942, Tsuji went to Guadalcanal, where he planned and led the last major Japanese attack on October 23\u201324. After these attacks were defeated, Tsuji went to Tokyo in person to urge additional reinforcements. But he then accepted the Navy's conclusion that nothing could get through, and recommended the evacuation of the remaining troops. He impressed the Emperor with his frankness.\n\nBut the Guadalcanal fiasco had discredited him. He was sent to the Japanese HQ in [[Nanking]], which was largely inactive, for the next year. While there, he made contacts with various Chinese, including both collaborators and agents of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s government.<ref name=\"DF\"/>\n\nIn mid-1944, Tsuji was sent to Burma, where Japanese forces [[Battle of Imphal|had been repulsed at Imphal]]. Tsuji was assigned to the 33rd Army, which faced the Chinese in northeastern Burma. He was an energetic and efficient planner, if notoriously arrogant, and once helped quell panic in the ranks by ostentiously having a bath under fire in the front lines.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nWhen the Japanese position in Burma collapsed in 1945, Tsuji escaped, first to Thailand, and then to China, where he renewed the contacts made in Nanking. He also visited [[Vietnam]], then in disorder with the [[Viet Minh]] resisting the re-establishment of French rule. In China, Tsuji was both a prisoner and an employee of Chinese intelligence.<ref name=\"DF\"/>\n\nIn 1948, he was allowed to resign from Chinese service and returned to Japan. He began publishing books and articles about his war experiences, including an account of the Japanese victory in Malaya. He also wrote of his years in hiding in ''Senk\u014d Sanzenri'' (\u6f5c\u884c\u4e09\u5343\u91cc;) \"3,000 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' (Chinese miles) in hiding\", which became a best seller. He was elected to the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] in 1952, and re-elected twice.<ref name=\"DF\"/>\n\n==Disappearance==\nIn April 1961, he traveled to [[Laos]] and was never heard from again. He may have been killed in the [[Laotian Civil War]], but there were also rumors that he became an adviser to the [[North Vietnam]]ese government. He was declared dead on July 20, 1968.<ref>http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20000726b1.html</ref>\n\nHe held strong \"pan-Asian\" views and thought that the people of other Asian countries should support Japan against Western powers. \nHis ultra-nationalist and militarist views and his war record won him the support of many like-minded Japanese nationalists, to the end of which his supporters erected a statue of him in [[Kaga, Ishikawa|Kaga]] City, Japan.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of people who disappeared mysteriously: pre-1970|List of people who disappeared]]\n\n==Honors==\n* [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]], 3rd Class<ref name=\"t108\">Tsuji, Masanobu.

His aggressive and insubordinate attitude exacerbated the [[Soviet\u2013Japanese border conflicts]], and helped incite to the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]] in 1939.<ref name=\"Coox\">[[Alvin Coox|Coox, Alvin D.]] ''Nomonhan: Japan Against Russia, 1939'', {{ISBN|0-8047-1835-0}}</ref>\n\nAfter the defeat at Khalkhin Gol, Tsuji opposed any further conflicts with the USSR. After their attack on the USSR in 1941, the Germans urged the Japanese to join the invasion, and many in the Japanese military wanted to avenge the defeat at Khalkhin Gol. Yet Tsuji was an influential advocate of the attack on the United States. General [[Ry\u016bkichi Tanaka|Ryukichi Tanaka]] testified after the war that, \"the most determined single protagonist in favor of war with the United States was Tsuji Masanobu.\" Tsuji later wrote that his experience of Soviet fire-power at Khalkhin Gol convinced him not to attack the Soviet Union in 1941.<ref name=\"thediplomat.com\">{{cite news|first=Stuart|last=Goldman|url=http://thediplomat.com/2012/08/the-forgotten-soviet-japanese-war-of-1939/?allpages=yes|title=The Forgotten Soviet-Japanese War of 1939|work=[[The Diplomat]]|date=August 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nHis protectors in the Army got him safely transferred to [[Taiwan]], where he helped organize the Army's jungle warfare school. He was then assigned to the Operations Section of the General staff, where he became a strong advocate of war with the United States and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. It has been alleged that in late 1941, he planned the assassination of [[Fumimaro Konoe|Prime Minister Konoye]], if Konoye achieved peace with the U.S.<ref name=\"KGB\"/>\n\nTsuji planned the Japanese overland attack in [[New Guinea]], via the [[Kokoda Trail]]. In this as in other operations, he ordered bold offensive moves regardless of difficulties or the costs to the troops involved.\n\nIn late 1942, Tsuji went to Guadalcanal, where he planned and led the last major Japanese attack on October 23\u201324. After these attacks were defeated, Tsuji went to Tokyo in person to urge additional reinforcements. But he then accepted the Navy's conclusion that nothing could get through, and recommended the evacuation of the remaining troops. He impressed the Emperor with his frankness.\n\nBut the Guadalcanal fiasco had discredited him. He was sent to the Japanese HQ in [[Nanking]], which was largely inactive, for the next year. While there, he made contacts with various Chinese, including both collaborators and agents of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s government.<ref name=\"DF\"/>\n\nIn mid-1944, Tsuji was sent to Burma, where Japanese forces [[Battle of Imphal|had been repulsed at Imphal]]. Tsuji was assigned to the 33rd Army, which faced the Chinese in northeastern Burma. He was an energetic and efficient planner, if notoriously arrogant, and once helped quell panic in the ranks by ostentiously having a bath under fire in the front lines.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nWhen the Japanese position in Burma collapsed in 1945, Tsuji escaped, first to Thailand, and then to China, where he renewed the contacts made in Nanking. He also visited [[Vietnam]], then in disorder with the [[Viet Minh]] resisting the re-establishment of French rule. In China, Tsuji was both a prisoner and an employee of Chinese intelligence.<ref name=\"DF\"/>\n\nIn 1948, he was allowed to resign from Chinese service and returned to Japan. He began publishing books and articles about his war experiences, including an account of the Japanese victory in Malaya. He also wrote of his years in hiding in ''Senk\u014d Sanzenri'' (\u6f5c\u884c\u4e09\u5343\u91cc;) \"3,000 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' (Chinese miles) in hiding\", which became a best seller. He was elected to the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] in 1952, and re-elected twice.<ref name=\"DF\"/>\n\n==Disappearance==\nIn April 1961, he traveled to [[Laos]] and was never heard from again. He may have been killed in the [[Laotian Civil War]], but there were also rumors that he became an adviser to the [[North Vietnam]]ese government. He was declared dead on July 20, 1968.<ref>http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20000726b1.html</ref>\n\nHe held strong \"pan-Asian\" views and thought that the people of other Asian countries should support Japan against Western powers. \nHis ultra-nationalist and militarist views and his war record won him the support of many like-minded Japanese nationalists, to the end of which his supporters erected a statue of him in [[Kaga, Ishikawa|Kaga]] City, Japan.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of people who disappeared mysteriously: pre-1970|List of people who disappeared]]\n\n==Honors==\n* [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]], 3rd Class<ref name=\"t108\">Tsuji, Masanobu.

Meanwhile, Ben and Jack mollify a group of homeless foster and biological siblings so they can help save a life and this triggers memories from Jack\u2019s past. The new Fire Chief is already creating trouble. Michael Dixon was never a firefighter, he was a former cop and that puts him on a totally different tangent.

Pruitt and Andy mend their relationship when he offers an apology for his outburst. Sullivan and Ben stay behind from the trip to prepare an aid car for Ben's Physician Response Team.

The conquest of Peru led to spin-off campaigns throughout the viceroyalty as well as expeditions towards the Amazon Basin as in the case of Spanish efforts to quell Amerindian resistance. The last Inca resistance was suppressed when the Spaniards annihilated the [[Neo-Inca State]] in [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]] in 1572.\n\nThe indigenous population dramatically collapsed overwhelmingly due to epidemic diseases introduced by the Spanish as well as exploitation and socioeconomic change.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1992.tb01968.x|jstor=2563354|author=Lovell, W.

[[Alto Peru]] (Bolivia) remained as a Spanish stronghold until the army of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] liberated it three years later. Jos\u00e9 de San Martin was declared Protector of Peru. Peruvian national identity was forged during this period, as Bolivarian projects for a [[Congress of Panama|Latin American Confederation]] floundered and a [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation|union with Bolivia]] proved ephemeral.<ref>Gootenberg (1991) p. 12.</ref>\n\n[[File:La Independencia del Per\u00fa.jpg|thumb|San Mart\u00edn proclaiming the independence of Peru.

In July 1822 Bolivar and San Martin gathered in the [[Guayaquil Conference]]. Bolivar was left in charge of fully liberating Peru while San Martin retired from politics after the first parliament was assembled. The newly founded [[Congress of the Republic of Peru|Peruvian Congress]] named Bolivar dictator of Peru giving him the power to organize the military.\n\nWith the help of [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] they defeated the larger Spanish army in the [[Battle of Jun\u00edn]] on 6 August 1824 and the decisive [[Battle of Ayacucho]] on 9 December of the same year, consolidating the independence of Peru and Alto Peru. Alto Peru was later established as [[Bolivia]]. During the early years of the Republic, endemic struggles for power between military leaders caused political instability.<ref>Discover Peru (Peru cultural society).

Bolivia invoked its alliance with Peru against Chile. The [[Peruvian Government]] tried to mediate the dispute by sending a diplomatic team to negotiate with the Chilean government, but the committee concluded that war was inevitable. Chile declared war on 5 April 1879. Almost five years of war ended with the loss of the [[Tarapac\u00e1 Department (Peru)|department of Tarapac\u00e1]] and the provinces of [[Tacna Province|Tacna]] and [[Arica Province (Peru)|Arica]], in the Atacama region. Two outstanding military leaders throughout the war were [[Francisco Bolognesi]] and [[Miguel Grau Seminario|Miguel Grau]]. Originally Chile committed to a referendum for the cities of Arica and Tacna to be held years later, in order to self determine their national affiliation. However, Chile refused to apply the Treaty, and neither of the countries could determine the statutory framework. After the War of the Pacific, an extraordinary effort of rebuilding began. The government started to initiate a number of social and economic reforms in order to recover from the damage of the war. Political stability was achieved only in the early 1900s.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[File:Protocolo de R\u00edo.jpg|thumb|The signing of the [[Rio Protocol]] in January 1942]]\nInternal struggles after the war were followed by a period of stability under the [[Civilista Party]], which lasted until the onset of the authoritarian regime of [[Augusto B. Legu\u00eda]]. The [[Great Depression]] caused the downfall of Legu\u00eda, renewed political turmoil, and the emergence of the [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] (APRA).<ref>Klar\u00e9n, Peter (2000). ''Peru: society and nationhood in the Andes''. New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 262\u2013276, {{ISBN|0195069285}}.</ref> The rivalry between this organization and a coalition of the elite and the military defined Peruvian politics for the following three decades. A final peace treaty in 1929, signed between Peru and Chile called the [[Treaty of Lima]], returned [[Tacna]] to Peru. Between 1932 and 1933, Peru was engulfed in a [[Leticia Incident|year-long war with Colombia]] over a territorial dispute involving the [[Amazonas department]] and its capital [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]].\n\nLater, in 1941, Peru and [[Ecuador]] fought the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]], after which the [[Rio Protocol]] sought to formalize the boundary between those two countries. In a military coup on 29 October 1948, General [[Manuel A. Odr\u00eda]] became president. Odr\u00eda's presidency was known as the ''Ochenio''. Momentarily pleasing the oligarchy and all others on the right, but followed a [[Populism|populist]] course that won him great favor with the poor and lower classes. A thriving economy allowed him to indulge in expensive but crowd-pleasing social policies. At the same time, however, [[civil rights]] were severely restricted and [[political corruption|corruption]] was rampant throughout his regime. Odr\u00eda was succeeded by [[Manuel Prado Ugarteche]]. However, widespread allegations of fraud prompted the Peruvian military to depose Prado and install a military junta, led by [[Ricardo P\u00e9rez Godoy]]. Godoy ran a short transitional government and held new elections in 1963, which were won by [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]] who assumed presidency until 1968. Bela\u00fande was recognized for his commitment to the [[democracy|democratic]] process. In 1968, the Armed Forces, led by General [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]], staged a coup against Bela\u00fande. Alvarado's regime undertook radical reforms aimed at fostering development, but failed to gain widespread support. In 1975, General [[Francisco Morales-Berm\u00fadez]] forcefully replaced Velasco, paralyzed reforms, and oversaw the reestablishment of democracy.\n\n[[File:Zonas donde se ha registrado actividad de Sendero Luminoso.png|thumb|left|Areas where the [[Shining Path]] was active in Peru]]\n\nPeru engaged in a brief successful conflict with Ecuador in the [[Paquisha War]] as a result of territorial dispute between the two countries. After the country experienced [[chronic inflation]], the Peruvian currency, the [[Peruvian sol (1863\u20131985)|sol]], was replaced by the ''[[Inti (currency)|Inti]]'' in mid-1985, which itself was replaced by the [[Peruvian nuevo sol|nuevo sol]] in July 1991, at which time the new sol had a cumulative value of one billion old soles. The per capita annual income of Peruvians fell to $720 (below the level of 1960) and Peru's [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] dropped 20% at which national reserves were a negative $900 million. The economic turbulence of the time acerbated social tensions in Peru and partly contributed to the rise of violent rebel rural insurgent movements, like [[Shining Path|Sendero Luminoso]] (Shining Path) and [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]], which caused [[Internal conflict in Peru|great havoc]] throughout the country. Concerned about the economy, the increasing terrorist threat from Sendero Luminoso and MRTA, and allegations of official corruption, [[Alberto Fujimori]] assumed presidency in 1990. Fujimori implemented drastic measures that caused inflation to drop from 7,650% in 1990 to 139% in 1991.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nFaced with opposition to his reform efforts, Fujimori dissolved Congress in the ''[[auto-golpe]]'' (\"self-coup\") of 5 April 1992. He then revised the constitution; called new congressional elections; and implemented substantial economic reform, including privatization of numerous state-owned companies, creation of an investment-friendly climate, and sound management of the economy. Fujimori's administration was dogged by [[Insurgency|insurgent]] groups, most notably the Sendero Luminoso, who carried out terrorist campaigns across the country throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Fujimori cracked down on the insurgents and was successful in largely quelling them by the late 1990s, but the fight was marred by atrocities committed by both the Peruvian security forces and the insurgents: the [[Barrios Altos massacre]] and [[La Cantuta massacre]] by Government paramilitary groups, and the bombings of [[Tarata bombing|Tarata]] and [[Frecuencia Latina bombing|Frecuencia Latina]] by Sendero Luminoso. Those incidents subsequently came to symbolize the [[Human rights in Peru|human rights]] violations committed in the last years of violence.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nDuring early 1995, once again Peru and Ecuador clashed in the [[Cenepa War]], but in 1998 the governments of both nations signed a peace treaty that clearly demarcated the international boundary between them. In November 2000, Fujimori resigned from office and went into a self-imposed [[exile]], avoiding prosecution for human rights violations and corruption charges by the new Peruvian authorities.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 21st century, Odebrecht Scandal, and political issues===\n{{Main|Operation Car Wash|2017-20 Peruvian political crisis|2019 Peruvian constitutional crisis}}\nSince the end of the Fujimori regime, Peru has tried to fight corruption while sustaining economic growth.<ref name=\":0\">''The Economist'' (17 October 2007), ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20080410185845/http://www.economist.com/research/backgrounders/displaybackgrounder.cfm?bg=709221 Peru].''</ref> In spite of human rights progress since the time of insurgency, many problems are still visible and show the continued marginalization of those who suffered through the violence of the Peruvian conflict.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=White |first=Gavin David |date=2009 |title=Displacement, decentralisation and reparation in post-conflict Peru |url=http://www.fmreview.org/protracted/white.html|journal=Forced Migration Review}}</ref> A caretaker government presided over by [[Valent\u00edn Paniagua]] took on the responsibility of conducting new presidential and congressional elections.

The indigenous populations east of the Andes speak various languages and dialects. Some of these groups still adhere to traditional indigenous languages, while others have been almost completely assimilated into the Spanish language. There has been an increasing and organized effort to teach Quechua in public schools in the areas where Quechua is spoken.

These [[Peruvian Ancient Cultures|civilizations]] rose in the territory of modern Peru before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|arrival of the Spanish]]. Peruvian art incorporated European elements after the Spanish conquest and continued to evolve throughout the centuries up on to the modern day.\n\n==== Pre-Columbian art ====\n\n[[File:A detail of the Raimondi Stela.png|thumb|left|A detail of the [[Raimondi Stela]]. This stela was found out of its original placement at the ceremonial complex, Chav\u00edn de Huantar]]\n\n[[File:Nariguera Moche2.JPG|thumb|Moche ''Nariguera'' depicting the Decapitator, gold with turquoise and [[chrysocolla]] inlays. Museo Oro del Peru, Lima]]\n\nPeru's earliest artwork came from the [[Cupisnique]] culture, which was concentrated on the Pacific coast, and the Chav\u00edn culture, which was largely north of [[Lima]] between the Andean mountain ranges of the [[Cordillera Negra]] and the [[Cordillera Blanca]]. Decorative work from this era, approximately the 9th century BCE, was symbolic and religious in nature. The artists worked with gold, silver and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] to create a variety of sculpture and relief carvings. These civilizations were also known for their [[architecture]] and wood sculpture.\n\nBetween the 9th century BC and the 2nd century CE, the [[Paracas culture|Paracas]] Cavernas and Paracas [[Necropolis]] cultures developed on the south coast of Peru. Paracas Cavernas produced complex polychrome and monochrome ceramics with religious representations. Burials from the Paracas Necropolis also yielded [https://web.archive.org/web/20080120151305/http://exchanges.state.gov/culprop/1peru/sect1.htm complex textiles], many produced with sophisticated geometric patterns.\n\nThe 3rd century BCE saw the flowering of the urban culture, [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], in the [[Lambayeque (Department of Peru)|Lambayeque]] region. The Mochica culture produced impressive architectural works, such as the [[Huaca del Sol|Huacas del Sol y de la Luna]] and the [[Huaca Rajada]] of [[Sip\u00e1n]]. They were experts at [[Terrace (agriculture)|cultivation in terraces]] and [[hydraulic engineering]] and produced original ceramics, textiles, pictorial and sculptural works.\n\nAnother urban culture, the [[Huari Culture|Wari civilization]], flourished between the 8th and 12th centuries in [[Ayacucho (Department of Peru)|Ayacucho]]. Their centralized town planning was extended to other areas, such as [[Pachacamac]], [[Cajamarquilla]] and [[Wari Willka]].\n\n[[File:Inca Quipu.jpg|thumb|left|250px|'Quipus' were recording devices fashioned from [[String (structure)|strings]] historically used by a number of cultures in the region of [[Andes|Andean]] [[South America]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Neuman |first=William |title=Untangling an Accounting Tool and an Ancient Inca Mystery|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/world/americas/untangling-an-accounting-tool-and-an-ancient-incan-mystery.html |date=2 January 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=8 January 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nBetween the 9th and 13th centuries CE, the military urban [[Tiwanaku]] empire rose by the borders of [[Lake Titicaca]]. Centered around a city of the same name in modern-day Bolivia, the Tiwanaku introduced stone architecture and sculpture of a monumental type. These works of [[architecture]] and art were made possible by the Tiwanaku's developing [[bronze]], which enabled them to make the necessary tools.\n\nUrban architecture reached a new height between the 14th and 15th centuries in the [[Chim\u00fa Culture]]. The Chim\u00fa built the city of [[Chan Chan]] in the valley of the [[Moche River]], in [[La Libertad (Department of Peru)|La Libertad]]. The Chim\u00fa were skilled [[goldsmith]]s and created remarkable works of [[hydraulic engineering]].\n\nThe [[Inca Empire|Inca Civilization]], which united Peru under its hegemony in the centuries immediately preceding the Spanish conquest, incorporated into their own works a great part of the cultural legacy of the civilizations which preceded it. Important relics of their artwork and architecture can be seen in cities like [[Cusco (Department of Peru)|Cusco]], architectural remains like [[Sacsayhuam\u00e1n|Sacsahuam\u00e1n]] and [[Machu Picchu]] and stone pavements that united Cusco with the rest of the Inca Empire.\n\n==== Colonial art ====\n{{Main|Peruvian colonial architecture|Cusco School}}\n[[File:Anonymous, Cuzco School, Peru - The Virgin of the Pilgrims and Child - Google Art Project.jpg|upright|thumb|''The Virgin of the [[Christian pilgrimage|Pilgrims]] and Child'', Anonymous [[Cusco School|Colonial Cusco School]] painting, 18th century]]\nPeruvian [[sculpture]] and [[painting]] began to define themselves from the [[Studio|ateliers]] founded by [[monk]]s, who were strongly influenced by the Sevillian Baroque School. In this context, the stalls of the [[Lima Cathedral|Cathedral]] choir, the fountain of the Main Square of [[Lima District|Lima]] both by [[Pedro de Noguera]], and a great part of the colonial production were registered. The first center of art established by the Spanish was the [[Cuzco School]] that taught [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] artists European painting styles.

Modern Peruvian literature is recognized thanks to authors such as [[List of Nobel laureates in Literature|Nobel laureate]] [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], a leading member of the [[Latin American Boom]].<ref>Martin, \"Narrative since c. 1920\", pp. 186\u2013188.</ref>[[File:Ceviche de caballa.JPG|alt=|thumb|''[[Ceviche]]'' is a popular lime marinated seafood dish which originated in Peru.]]\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Peruvian cuisine}}\nDue to the Spanish expedition and discovery of the Americas, the explorers started the [[Columbian exchange|Columbian Exchange]] which included food unheard of in the Old World, such as [[potato]], [[tomato]], and [[maize]]. Modern indigenous Peruvian food mainly consists of corn, potatoes, and [[Chili pepper|chilies]]. There are now more than 3,000 kinds of potatoes grown on Peruvian terrain, according to Peru's Instituto Peruano de la Papa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://guide.michelin.com/sg/features/7-things-you-need-to-know-about-peruvian-cuisine/news|title=7 Things You Need to Know about Peruvian Cuisine|website=MICHELIN Guide}}</ref>\nModern [[Peruvian cuisine]] blends [[Native American cuisine#Native American cuisine of South America|Amerindian]] and [[Spanish food]] with strong influences from Chinese, African, Arab, Italian, and Japanese cooking.<ref>Custer, pp. 17\u201322.</ref> Common dishes include ''[[anticuchos]]'', ''[[ceviche]]'', and ''[[pachamanca]]''. Peru's varied climate allows the growth of diverse plants and animals good for cooking.<ref>Custer, pp. 25\u201338.</ref> Peru's diversity of ingredients and cooking techniques is receiving worldwide acclaim.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120118164339/http://www.peruvianembassy.us/do.php?p=507 Embassy of Peru in the United States, ''The Peruvian Gastronomy''].peruvianembassy.us.</ref>\n\nPeruvian cuisine reflects local practices and ingredients\u2014including influences from the indigenous population including the [[Quechua people|Inca]] and cuisines brought in with colonizers and immigrants. Without the familiar ingredients from their home countries, immigrants modified their traditional cuisines by using ingredients available in Peru. The four traditional staples of Peruvian cuisine are [[Maize|corn]], [[potato]]es and other [[tuber]]s, [[Amaranthaceae]]s ([[quinoa]], [[ka\u00f1iwa]] and [[kiwicha]]) and [[legume]]s ([[beans]] and [[lupins]]). Staples brought by the Spanish include [[rice]], [[wheat]] and meats (beef, pork and chicken). Many traditional foods\u2014such as [[quinoa]], [[kiwicha]], [[chili pepper]]s, and several roots and [[tuber]]s have increased in popularity in recent decades, reflecting a revival of interest in native Peruvian foods and culinary techniques. Chef [[Gaston Acurio]] has become well known for raising awareness of local ingredients.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{main|Peruvian music}}\n[[File:Marinera Norte\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|[[Marinera]] Norte\u00f1a]]\nPeruvian music has [[Andean music|Andean]], [[Music of Spain|Spanish]], and [[African Music|African]] roots.<ref>Romero, Ra\u00fal (1999). \"Andean Peru\". In: John Schechter (ed.), ''Music in Latin American culture: regional tradition''. New York: Schirmer Books, pp.&nbsp;385\u2013386.</ref> In pre-Hispanic times, musical expressions varied widely in each region; the ''[[quena]]'' and the ''[[tinya]]'' were two common instruments.<ref name=\"Olsen\" /> Spaniards introduced new instruments, such as the guitar and the harp, which led to the development of crossbred instruments like the ''[[charango]]''.<ref name=\"Turino\" /> African contributions to Peruvian music include its rhythms and the ''[[Cajon|caj\u00f3n]]'', a percussion instrument. [[Peruvian folk dances]] include [[marinera]], [[tondero]], [[zamacueca]], [[diablada]] and [[huayno]].<ref>Romero, Ra\u00fal (1985). \"La m\u00fasica tradicional y popular\". In: Patronato Popular y Porvenir, ''La m\u00fasica en el Per\u00fa''. Lima: Industrial Gr\u00e1fica, pp.&nbsp;pp. 243\u2013245, 261\u2013265.</ref>\n\nPeruvian music is dominated by the national [[Musical instrument|instrument]], the [[charango]]. The charango is member of the [[lute]] family of instruments and was invented during [[Viceroyalty of Peru|colonial times]] by musicians imitating the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[vihuela]]. In the Canas and [[Titicaca]] regions, the charango is used in courtship rituals, symbolically invoking [[mermaid]]s with the instrument to lure the woman to the male performers. Until the 1960s, the charango was denigrated as an instrument of the rural poor. After the revolution in 1959, which built upon the [[Indigenismo]] movement (1910\u20131940), the charango was popularized among other performers. Variants include the [[walaycho]], [[chillador]], [[chinlili]], and the larger and lower-tuned [[charangon]].\n\nWhile the Spanish [[guitar]] is widely played, so too is the Spanish-in-origin [[bandurria]]. Unlike the guitar, it has been transformed by Peruvian players over the years, changing from a 12-string, 6-course instrument to one having 12 to 16 strings in a mere four courses. [[Violins]] and [[harps]], also of European origin, are also played.\n\n=== Cinema ===\nWhile the Peruvian film industry has not been nearly as prolific as that of some other Latin American countries, some Peruvian movies produced enjoyed regional success. Historically, the cinema of Peru [[Cinema of Iquitos|began in Iquitos]] in 1932 by Antonio Wong Rengifo (with a momentous, initial [[Movie theater|film billboard]] from 1900) because the [[rubber boom]] and the intense arrival of foreigners with technology to the city, and thus continued an extensive, unique filmography, with a different style than the films made in the capital, Lima.\n\nPeru also produced the first animated 3-D film in [[Latin America]], ''[[Piratas en el Callao]]''. This film is set in the historical port city of [[Callao]], which during colonial times had to defend itself against attacks by Dutch and British privateers seeking to undercut Spain's trade with its colonies. The film was produced by the [[Peruvians|Peruvian]] company Alpamayo Entertainment, which made a second 3-D film one year later: ''Dragones: Destino de Fuego''.\n\nIn February 2006, the film ''[[Madeinusa]]'', produced as a joint venture between Peru and Spain and directed by [[Claudia Llosa]], was set in an imaginary Andean village and describes the stagnating life of Madeinusa performed by [[Magaly Solier]] and the traumas of post-civil war Peru.\n\nLlosa, who shared elements of [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]]'s [[magic realism]], won an award at the [[Rotterdam Film Festival]]. Llosa's second feature, [[The Milk of Sorrow]] (\"La Teta Asustada\"), was nominated for the [[82nd Academy Awards]] for Best Foreign Language Picture, the first Peruvian film in the Academy's history to be nominated. [[The Milk of Sorrow]] (\"La Teta Asustada\"), won the Golden Bear award at the 2009 Berlinale.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Peru}}\n*[[Outline of Peru]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n;Notes\n{{notelist}}\n;Citations\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Altroy\">D'Altroy, Terence (2002).

Ranging from the [[Norte Chico civilization]] starting in 3500 BC, the oldest civilization in the Americas and one of the five [[cradles of civilization]], to the [[Inca Empire]], the largest state in [[pre-Columbian]] America, the territory now including Peru has one of the longest histories of civilization of any country, tracing its heritage back to the 4th millennia BCE.\n\nThe [[Spanish Empire]] conquered the region in the 16th century and [[Viceroyalty of Peru|established a viceroyalty]] that encompassed most of its South American territories, with its capital in [[Lima]]. Peru formally proclaimed independence in 1821, and following the foreign military campaigns of [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], and the decisive [[battle of Ayacucho]], Peru [[Peruvian War of Independence|completed its independence in 1824]]. In the ensuing years, the country enjoyed relative [[Guano Era|economic and political stability]], which ended shortly before the [[War of the Pacific]] with Chile. Throughout the 20th century, Peru endured armed territorial disputes, coups, social unrest, and [[Internal conflict in Peru|internal conflicts]], as well as periods of stability and economic upswing. [[Alberto Fujimori]] was elected to the presidency in 1990; his government was credited with economically stabilizing Peru and successfully ending the [[Shining Path]] insurgency, though he was widely accused of [[human rights violations]] and suppression of political dissent. Fujimori left the presidency in 2000 and was charged with human rights violations and imprisoned until his pardon by President [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]] in 2017. Even after the president's regime, Fujimori's followers, called ''[[Fujimorism|Fujimoristas]]'', have caused political turmoil for any opposing faction in power, even causing Pedro Pablo Kuczynski to resign in March 2018.\n\nThe [[sovereign state]] of Peru is a [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic divided into [[Administrative divisions of Peru|25 regions]].

The Chimu were the great city builders of pre-Inca civilization; as loose confederation of cities scattered along the coast of northern Peru, the Chimu flourished from about 1140 to 1450.

Inca expansion was slow until about the middle of the fifteenth century, when the pace of conquest began to accelerate, particularly under the rule of the emperor [[Pachacuti]]. Under his rule and that of his son, [[Topa Inca Yupanqui]], the Incas came to control most of the Andean region, with a population of 9 to 16 million inhabitants under their rule. Pachacuti also promulgated a comprehensive code of laws to govern his far-flung empire, while consolidating his absolute temporal and spiritual authority as the God of the Sun who ruled from a magnificently rebuilt Cusco.<ref>Peru [http://countrystudies.us/peru/3.htm The Incas] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103012145/http://countrystudies.us/peru/3.htm |date=3 November 2016}}</ref> From 1438 to 1533, the Incas used a variety of methods, from conquest to peaceful assimilation, to incorporate a large portion of western South America, centered on the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain ranges, from southern [[Colombia]] to northern [[Chile]], between the Pacific Ocean in the west and the Amazon rainforest in the east. The official language of the empire was [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], although hundreds of local languages and dialects were spoken. The Inca referred to their empire as ''Tawantinsuyu'' which can be translated as \"The Four Regions\" or \"The Four United Provinces.\" Many local forms of worship persisted in the empire, most of them concerning local sacred ''[[Huaca]]s'', but the Inca leadership encouraged the worship of [[Inti]], the sun god and imposed its sovereignty above other cults such as that of [[Pachamama]].<ref>[http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=inca The Inca \u2013 All Empires] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120164828/http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=inca |date=20 January 2012}}</ref> The Incas considered their King, the [[Sapa Inca]], to be the \"[[Sun worship|child of the sun]].\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091110041802/http://www.nflc.org/Reach/7ca/enCAInca.htm \"The Inca\"] at the [[Wayback Machine]] (archived 10 November 2009) ''The National Foreign Language Center at the University of Maryland.'' 29 May 2007.

In December 1532, a party of ''[[conquistador]]s'' (supported by the [[Chanka people|Chankas]], [[Huanca people|Huancas]], [[Ca\u00f1ari]]s and [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]] as [[Indian auxiliaries]]) led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] defeated and captured the Inca Emperor Atahualpa in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]]. The Spanish conquest of Peru was one of the most important campaigns in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. After years of preliminary exploration and military conflicts, it was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting but ended in Spanish victory and colonization of the region known as the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] with its capital at [[Lima]], which was then known as \"La Ciudad de los Reyes\" (The City of Kings). The conquest of Peru led to spin-off campaigns throughout the viceroyalty as well as expeditions towards the Amazon Basin as in the case of Spanish efforts to quell Amerindian resistance. The last Inca resistance was suppressed when the Spaniards annihilated the [[Neo-Inca State]] in [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]] in 1572.\n\nThe indigenous population dramatically collapsed overwhelmingly due to epidemic diseases introduced by the Spanish as well as exploitation and socioeconomic change.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1992.tb01968.x|jstor=2563354|author=Lovell, W.

The expansion of a colonial administrative apparatus and bureaucracy paralleled the economic reorganization. With the conquest started the spread of [[Christianity]] in South America; most people were forcefully converted to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], taking only a generation to convert the population. They built churches in every city and replaced some of the Inca temples with churches, such as the [[Coricancha]] in the city of Cusco. The church employed the [[Inquisition]], making use of torture to ensure that newly converted Catholics did not stray to other religions or beliefs.

The [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] was rendered meaningless between 1580 and 1640 while [[Iberian Union|Spain controlled Portugal]]. The need to ease communication and trade with Spain led to the split of the viceroyalty and the creation of new viceroyalties of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] and [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Rio de la Plata]] at the expense of the territories that formed the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]; this reduced the power, prominence and importance of Lima as the viceroyal capital and shifted the lucrative [[Andean]] trade to [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Bogot\u00e1]], while the fall of the mining and textile production accelerated the progressive decay of the Viceroyalty of Peru.\n\n[[File:Bas\u00edlica Catedral Metropolitana de Lima.jpg|thumb|Main fa\u00e7ade of the [[Cathedral of Lima]] and the [[Archbishop's Palace of Lima|Archbishop's palace]].|alt=]]\nEventually, the viceroyalty would dissolve, as with much of the Spanish empire, when challenged by national independence movements at the beginning of the nineteenth century.

As the elite vacillated between emancipation and loyalty to the Spanish Monarchy, [[independence of Peru|independence]] was achieved only after the occupation by military campaigns of [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]].\n\nThe economic crises, the loss of power of Spain in Europe, the [[American Revolutionary War|war of independence in North America]] and native uprisings all contributed to a favorable climate to the development of emancipating ideas among the [[Criollo people|C''riollo'']] population in South America. However, the Criollo oligarchy in Peru enjoyed privileges and remained loyal to the Spanish Crown. The liberation movement started in [[Argentina]] where autonomous juntas were created as a result of the loss of authority of the Spanish government over its colonies.\n\nAfter fighting for the independence of the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata, [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] created the [[Army of the Andes]] and [[Crossing of the Andes|crossed the Andes in 21 days]]. Once in Chile he joined forces with Chilean army General [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] and liberated the country in the battles of [[Battle of Chacabuco|Chacabuco]] and [[Battle of Maip\u00fa|Maip\u00fa]] in 1818.<ref>Scheina, 2003, ''Latin America's Wars: The Age of the Caudillo, 1791\u20131899'', p. 58.</ref> On 7 September 1820, a fleet of eight warships arrived in the port of [[Paracas (municipality)|Paracas]] under the command of general Jos\u00e9 de San Martin and [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Thomas Cochrane]], who was serving in the Chilean Navy. Immediately on 26 October they took control of the town of [[Pisco, Peru|Pisco]]. San Martin settled in [[Huacho]] on 12 November, where he established his headquarters while Cochrane sailed north blockading the port of [[Callao]] in [[Lima]]. At the same time in the north, [[Guayaquil]] was occupied by rebel forces under the command of Gregorio Escobedo. Because Peru was the stronghold of the Spanish government in South America, San Martin's strategy to liberate Peru was to use diplomacy. He sent representatives to Lima urging the [[Viceroy]] that Peru be granted independence, however all negotiations proved unsuccessful.\n\n[[File:Congreso 1822.jpg|thumb|left|[[Constituent Congress of Peru, 1822|First Constituent Congress of Peru]] in the chapel of the [[National University of San Marcos]] on 22 September 1822]]\n\nThe Viceroy of Peru, [[Joaqu\u00edn de la Pezuela, 1st Marquess of Viluma|Joaqu\u00edn de la Pazuela]] named [[Jos\u00e9 de la Serna e Hinojosa|Jos\u00e9 de la Serna]] commander-in-chief of the loyalist army to protect Lima from the threatened invasion of San Martin. On 29 January, de la Serna organized a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] against de la Pazuela which was recognized by Spain and he was named Viceroy of Peru. This internal power struggle contributed to the success of the liberating army. In order to avoid a military confrontation San Martin met the newly appointed viceroy, Jos\u00e9 de la Serna, and proposed to create a [[constitutional monarchy]], a proposal that was turned down. De la Serna abandoned the city and on 12 July 1821 San Martin occupied Lima and declared Peruvian independence on 28 July 1821. He created the first Peruvian flag. [[Alto Peru]] (Bolivia) remained as a Spanish stronghold until the army of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] liberated it three years later. Jos\u00e9 de San Martin was declared Protector of Peru. Peruvian national identity was forged during this period, as Bolivarian projects for a [[Congress of Panama|Latin American Confederation]] floundered and a [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation|union with Bolivia]] proved ephemeral.<ref>Gootenberg (1991) p. 12.</ref>\n\n[[File:La Independencia del Per\u00fa.jpg|thumb|San Mart\u00edn proclaiming the independence of Peru.

Bolivia invoked its alliance with Peru against Chile. The [[Peruvian Government]] tried to mediate the dispute by sending a diplomatic team to negotiate with the Chilean government, but the committee concluded that war was inevitable. Chile declared war on 5 April 1879. Almost five years of war ended with the loss of the [[Tarapac\u00e1 Department (Peru)|department of Tarapac\u00e1]] and the provinces of [[Tacna Province|Tacna]] and [[Arica Province (Peru)|Arica]], in the Atacama region. Two outstanding military leaders throughout the war were [[Francisco Bolognesi]] and [[Miguel Grau Seminario|Miguel Grau]]. Originally Chile committed to a referendum for the cities of Arica and Tacna to be held years later, in order to self determine their national affiliation. However, Chile refused to apply the Treaty, and neither of the countries could determine the statutory framework. After the War of the Pacific, an extraordinary effort of rebuilding began. The government started to initiate a number of social and economic reforms in order to recover from the damage of the war. Political stability was achieved only in the early 1900s.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[File:Protocolo de R\u00edo.jpg|thumb|The signing of the [[Rio Protocol]] in January 1942]]\nInternal struggles after the war were followed by a period of stability under the [[Civilista Party]], which lasted until the onset of the authoritarian regime of [[Augusto B.

A final peace treaty in 1929, signed between Peru and Chile called the [[Treaty of Lima]], returned [[Tacna]] to Peru. Between 1932 and 1933, Peru was engulfed in a [[Leticia Incident|year-long war with Colombia]] over a territorial dispute involving the [[Amazonas department]] and its capital [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]].\n\nLater, in 1941, Peru and [[Ecuador]] fought the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]], after which the [[Rio Protocol]] sought to formalize the boundary between those two countries. In a military coup on 29 October 1948, General [[Manuel A. Odr\u00eda]] became president. Odr\u00eda's presidency was known as the ''Ochenio''. Momentarily pleasing the oligarchy and all others on the right, but followed a [[Populism|populist]] course that won him great favor with the poor and lower classes. A thriving economy allowed him to indulge in expensive but crowd-pleasing social policies. At the same time, however, [[civil rights]] were severely restricted and [[political corruption|corruption]] was rampant throughout his regime. Odr\u00eda was succeeded by [[Manuel Prado Ugarteche]]. However, widespread allegations of fraud prompted the Peruvian military to depose Prado and install a military junta, led by [[Ricardo P\u00e9rez Godoy]]. Godoy ran a short transitional government and held new elections in 1963, which were won by [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]] who assumed presidency until 1968. Bela\u00fande was recognized for his commitment to the [[democracy|democratic]] process. In 1968, the Armed Forces, led by General [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]], staged a coup against Bela\u00fande. Alvarado's regime undertook radical reforms aimed at fostering development, but failed to gain widespread support. In 1975, General [[Francisco Morales-Berm\u00fadez]] forcefully replaced Velasco, paralyzed reforms, and oversaw the reestablishment of democracy.\n\n[[File:Zonas donde se ha registrado actividad de Sendero Luminoso.png|thumb|left|Areas where the [[Shining Path]] was active in Peru]]\n\nPeru engaged in a brief successful conflict with Ecuador in the [[Paquisha War]] as a result of territorial dispute between the two countries. After the country experienced [[chronic inflation]], the Peruvian currency, the [[Peruvian sol (1863\u20131985)|sol]], was replaced by the ''[[Inti (currency)|Inti]]'' in mid-1985, which itself was replaced by the [[Peruvian nuevo sol|nuevo sol]] in July 1991, at which time the new sol had a cumulative value of one billion old soles. The per capita annual income of Peruvians fell to $720 (below the level of 1960) and Peru's [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] dropped 20% at which national reserves were a negative $900 million. The economic turbulence of the time acerbated social tensions in Peru and partly contributed to the rise of violent rebel rural insurgent movements, like [[Shining Path|Sendero Luminoso]] (Shining Path) and [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]], which caused [[Internal conflict in Peru|great havoc]] throughout the country. Concerned about the economy, the increasing terrorist threat from Sendero Luminoso and MRTA, and allegations of official corruption, [[Alberto Fujimori]] assumed presidency in 1990. Fujimori implemented drastic measures that caused inflation to drop from 7,650% in 1990 to 139% in 1991.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nFaced with opposition to his reform efforts, Fujimori dissolved Congress in the ''[[auto-golpe]]'' (\"self-coup\") of 5 April 1992. He then revised the constitution; called new congressional elections; and implemented substantial economic reform, including privatization of numerous state-owned companies, creation of an investment-friendly climate, and sound management of the economy. Fujimori's administration was dogged by [[Insurgency|insurgent]] groups, most notably the Sendero Luminoso, who carried out terrorist campaigns across the country throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Fujimori cracked down on the insurgents and was successful in largely quelling them by the late 1990s, but the fight was marred by atrocities committed by both the Peruvian security forces and the insurgents: the [[Barrios Altos massacre]] and [[La Cantuta massacre]] by Government paramilitary groups, and the bombings of [[Tarata bombing|Tarata]] and [[Frecuencia Latina bombing|Frecuencia Latina]] by Sendero Luminoso.

[[Peruvian arts|Peruvian artistic traditions]] date back to the elaborate pottery, textiles, jewelry, and sculpture of [[Pre-Inca cultures]]. The Incas maintained these crafts and made [[Architecture of Peru|architectural]] achievements including the construction of [[Machu Picchu]]. [[Baroque]] dominated colonial art, though modified by native traditions.<ref>Bailey, pp. 72\u201374.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, most art focused on religious subjects; the numerous churches of the era and the paintings of the [[Cusco School]] are representative.<ref>Bailey, p. 263.</ref> Arts stagnated after independence until the emergence of ''[[Indigenismo]]'' in the early 20th century.<ref name=\"Lucie\" /> Since the 1950s, Peruvian art has been [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] and shaped by both foreign and local art currents.\n\n===Visual Arts===\n{{Main|Peruvian art}}\nPeruvian art has its origin in the [[Peruvian Ancient Cultures|Andean civilizations]]. These [[Peruvian Ancient Cultures|civilizations]] rose in the territory of modern Peru before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|arrival of the Spanish]]. Peruvian art incorporated European elements after the Spanish conquest and continued to evolve throughout the centuries up on to the modern day.\n\n==== Pre-Columbian art ====\n\n[[File:A detail of the Raimondi Stela.png|thumb|left|A detail of the [[Raimondi Stela]]. This stela was found out of its original placement at the ceremonial complex, Chav\u00edn de Huantar]]\n\n[[File:Nariguera Moche2.JPG|thumb|Moche ''Nariguera'' depicting the Decapitator, gold with turquoise and [[chrysocolla]] inlays. Museo Oro del Peru, Lima]]\n\nPeru's earliest artwork came from the [[Cupisnique]] culture, which was concentrated on the Pacific coast, and the Chav\u00edn culture, which was largely north of [[Lima]] between the Andean mountain ranges of the [[Cordillera Negra]] and the [[Cordillera Blanca]]. Decorative work from this era, approximately the 9th century BCE, was symbolic and religious in nature. The artists worked with gold, silver and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] to create a variety of sculpture and relief carvings. These civilizations were also known for their [[architecture]] and wood sculpture.\n\nBetween the 9th century BC and the 2nd century CE, the [[Paracas culture|Paracas]] Cavernas and Paracas [[Necropolis]] cultures developed on the south coast of Peru. Paracas Cavernas produced complex polychrome and monochrome ceramics with religious representations. Burials from the Paracas Necropolis also yielded [https://web.archive.org/web/20080120151305/http://exchanges.state.gov/culprop/1peru/sect1.htm complex textiles], many produced with sophisticated geometric patterns.\n\nThe 3rd century BCE saw the flowering of the urban culture, [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], in the [[Lambayeque (Department of Peru)|Lambayeque]] region. The Mochica culture produced impressive architectural works, such as the [[Huaca del Sol|Huacas del Sol y de la Luna]] and the [[Huaca Rajada]] of [[Sip\u00e1n]]. They were experts at [[Terrace (agriculture)|cultivation in terraces]] and [[hydraulic engineering]] and produced original ceramics, textiles, pictorial and sculptural works.\n\nAnother urban culture, the [[Huari Culture|Wari civilization]], flourished between the 8th and 12th centuries in [[Ayacucho (Department of Peru)|Ayacucho]]. Their centralized town planning was extended to other areas, such as [[Pachacamac]], [[Cajamarquilla]] and [[Wari Willka]].\n\n[[File:Inca Quipu.jpg|thumb|left|250px|'Quipus' were recording devices fashioned from [[String (structure)|strings]] historically used by a number of cultures in the region of [[Andes|Andean]] [[South America]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Neuman |first=William |title=Untangling an Accounting Tool and an Ancient Inca Mystery|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/world/americas/untangling-an-accounting-tool-and-an-ancient-incan-mystery.html |date=2 January 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=8 January 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nBetween the 9th and 13th centuries CE, the military urban [[Tiwanaku]] empire rose by the borders of [[Lake Titicaca]]. Centered around a city of the same name in modern-day Bolivia, the Tiwanaku introduced stone architecture and sculpture of a monumental type. These works of [[architecture]] and art were made possible by the Tiwanaku's developing [[bronze]], which enabled them to make the necessary tools.\n\nUrban architecture reached a new height between the 14th and 15th centuries in the [[Chim\u00fa Culture]]. The Chim\u00fa built the city of [[Chan Chan]] in the valley of the [[Moche River]], in [[La Libertad (Department of Peru)|La Libertad]]. The Chim\u00fa were skilled [[goldsmith]]s and created remarkable works of [[hydraulic engineering]].\n\nThe [[Inca Empire|Inca Civilization]], which united Peru under its hegemony in the centuries immediately preceding the Spanish conquest, incorporated into their own works a great part of the cultural legacy of the civilizations which preceded it. Important relics of their artwork and architecture can be seen in cities like [[Cusco (Department of Peru)|Cusco]], architectural remains like [[Sacsayhuam\u00e1n|Sacsahuam\u00e1n]] and [[Machu Picchu]] and stone pavements that united Cusco with the rest of the Inca Empire.\n\n==== Colonial art ====\n{{Main|Peruvian colonial architecture|Cusco School}}\n[[File:Anonymous, Cuzco School, Peru - The Virgin of the Pilgrims and Child - Google Art Project.jpg|upright|thumb|''The Virgin of the [[Christian pilgrimage|Pilgrims]] and Child'', Anonymous [[Cusco School|Colonial Cusco School]] painting, 18th century]]\nPeruvian [[sculpture]] and [[painting]] began to define themselves from the [[Studio|ateliers]] founded by [[monk]]s, who were strongly influenced by the Sevillian Baroque School. In this context, the stalls of the [[Lima Cathedral|Cathedral]] choir, the fountain of the Main Square of [[Lima District|Lima]] both by [[Pedro de Noguera]], and a great part of the colonial production were registered. The first center of art established by the Spanish was the [[Cuzco School]] that taught [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] artists European painting styles. [[Diego Quispe Tito]] (1611\u20131681) was one of the first members of the Cuzco school and [[Marcos Zapata]] (1710\u20131773) was one of the last.<ref name=\"Bayon\" />\n\nPainting of this time reflected a synthesis of European and indigenous influences, as is evident in the portrait of prisoner Atahualpa, by D. de Mora or in the canvases of the Italians [[Mateo P\u00e9rez de Alesio]] and Angelino Medoro, the Spaniards Francisco Bejarano and J. de Illescas and the Creole J.

Spaniards introduced writing in the 16th century; colonial literary expression included [[chronicle]]s and [[Christian literature|religious literature]]. After independence, [[Costumbrism]] and [[Romanticism]] became the most common literary genres, as exemplified in the works of [[Ricardo Palma]].<ref>Martin, \"Literature, music and the visual arts, c. 1820\u20131870\", pp. 37\u201339.</ref> The early 20th century's ''Indigenismo'' movement was led by such writers as [[Ciro Alegr\u00eda]]<ref>Martin, \"Narrative since c. 1920\", pp. 151\u2013152.</ref> and [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arguedas]].<ref>Martin, \"Narrative since c. 1920\", pp. 178\u2013179.</ref> [[C\u00e9sar Vallejo]] wrote modernist and often politically engaged verse.

Without the familiar ingredients from their home countries, immigrants modified their traditional cuisines by using ingredients available in Peru. The four traditional staples of Peruvian cuisine are [[Maize|corn]], [[potato]]es and other [[tuber]]s, [[Amaranthaceae]]s ([[quinoa]], [[ka\u00f1iwa]] and [[kiwicha]]) and [[legume]]s ([[beans]] and [[lupins]]). Staples brought by the Spanish include [[rice]], [[wheat]] and meats (beef, pork and chicken). Many traditional foods\u2014such as [[quinoa]], [[kiwicha]], [[chili pepper]]s, and several roots and [[tuber]]s have increased in popularity in recent decades, reflecting a revival of interest in native Peruvian foods and culinary techniques. Chef [[Gaston Acurio]] has become well known for raising awareness of local ingredients.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{main|Peruvian music}}\n[[File:Marinera Norte\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|[[Marinera]] Norte\u00f1a]]\nPeruvian music has [[Andean music|Andean]], [[Music of Spain|Spanish]], and [[African Music|African]] roots.<ref>Romero, Ra\u00fal (1999). \"Andean Peru\".

The charango is member of the [[lute]] family of instruments and was invented during [[Viceroyalty of Peru|colonial times]] by musicians imitating the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[vihuela]]. In the Canas and [[Titicaca]] regions, the charango is used in courtship rituals, symbolically invoking [[mermaid]]s with the instrument to lure the woman to the male performers. Until the 1960s, the charango was denigrated as an instrument of the rural poor. After the revolution in 1959, which built upon the [[Indigenismo]] movement (1910\u20131940), the charango was popularized among other performers. Variants include the [[walaycho]], [[chillador]], [[chinlili]], and the larger and lower-tuned [[charangon]].\n\nWhile the Spanish [[guitar]] is widely played, so too is the Spanish-in-origin [[bandurria]]. Unlike the guitar, it has been transformed by Peruvian players over the years, changing from a 12-string, 6-course instrument to one having 12 to 16 strings in a mere four courses. [[Violins]] and [[harps]], also of European origin, are also played.\n\n=== Cinema ===\nWhile the Peruvian film industry has not been nearly as prolific as that of some other Latin American countries, some Peruvian movies produced enjoyed regional success. Historically, the cinema of Peru [[Cinema of Iquitos|began in Iquitos]] in 1932 by Antonio Wong Rengifo (with a momentous, initial [[Movie theater|film billboard]] from 1900) because the [[rubber boom]] and the intense arrival of foreigners with technology to the city, and thus continued an extensive, unique filmography, with a different style than the films made in the capital, Lima.\n\nPeru also produced the first animated 3-D film in [[Latin America]], ''[[Piratas en el Callao]]''. This film is set in the historical port city of [[Callao]], which during colonial times had to defend itself against attacks by Dutch and British privateers seeking to undercut Spain's trade with its colonies. The film was produced by the [[Peruvians|Peruvian]] company Alpamayo Entertainment, which made a second 3-D film one year later: ''Dragones: Destino de Fuego''.\n\nIn February 2006, the film ''[[Madeinusa]]'', produced as a joint venture between Peru and Spain and directed by [[Claudia Llosa]], was set in an imaginary Andean village and describes the stagnating life of Madeinusa performed by [[Magaly Solier]] and the traumas of post-civil war Peru.\n\nLlosa, who shared elements of [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]]'s [[magic realism]], won an award at the [[Rotterdam Film Festival]]. Llosa's second feature, [[The Milk of Sorrow]] (\"La Teta Asustada\"), was nominated for the [[82nd Academy Awards]] for Best Foreign Language Picture, the first Peruvian film in the Academy's history to be nominated. [[The Milk of Sorrow]] (\"La Teta Asustada\"), won the Golden Bear award at the 2009 Berlinale.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Peru}}\n*[[Outline of Peru]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n;Notes\n{{notelist}}\n;Citations\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Altroy\">D'Altroy, Terence (2002).

the daughter of a nobleman whose family loses everything when her father is framed for treason. To make ends meet, Yang-sun begins [[cross-dressing]] as a male bookseller and meets the handsome and mysterious scholar Kim Sung-yeol ([[Lee Joon-gi]]), who works at the [[Hongmungwan]]. Kim Sung-yeol has spent 120 years as a Guardian Vampire who is responsible for getting rid of any vampire who disobeys the rules. As a Guardian Vampire, he is able to go out in sunlight as long as he wears his special black robe. Sung-yeol continues to be haunted by the long-ago death of his first love, Lee Myung-hee ([[Kim So-eun]]), who sacrificed herself for him 120 years ago. Sung-yeol decides to pay Yang-sun a high price if she is able to find the memorandum of his best friend, the late Crown Prince Jonghyun, which contains the secret to killing Gwi ([[Lee Soo-hyuk]]) and avenge the death of his family and lover. After the second meeting with Yang-sun, Sung-yeol finds out that Yang-sun is a girl. However, he decides to keep it as a secret to avoid awkwardness with Yang-sun. Yang-sun tries very hard to find the memorandum as she promised since she also needs money to cure her sister's leg.\n \nOn a trip to find the old book seller from Yuan with Yang-sun, Sung-yeol meets Choi Hye-ryung, Myung-hee's present-day [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] who is an aloof nobleman's daughter. Hye-ryung's father is a Right Minister of the king. He has the highest authority in the king's court compared to other ministers. He has also been loyally serving Gwi for a long time. In order to prove his loyalty, he even sacrificed Hye-ryung when she was 10 years old to become Gwi's food toy. However, due to her loyalty and gentle treatment towards Gwi, he has unconsciously fallen in love with Hye-ryung and secretly plans to change her into a vampire, even though he already has 100% control of the royal court. Gwi resides in the underground royal palace and uses his powers and political machinations to prevent Crown Prince Lee Yoon ([[Shim Chang-min]]) from ascending to the throne, as he knows that Crown Prince Lee Yoon is secretly planning to get rid of him like his late ancestor, Crown Prince Jonghyun.\n\nGwi is also aware of Sung-yeol's plan to kill him. He becomes furious when he learns that Sung-yeol has gotten close to finding the secret to killing him. Gwi tries to harm Yang-sun several times, but Sung-yeol was able to save Yang-sun since Sung-yeol also has the ability to sense Gwi's presence. Gwi becomes anxious after he smells Yang-sun's blood and decides to get rid of Yang-sun as a precaution. After a while, Sung-yeol secretly falls in love with Yang-sun after he discovers that Hye-ryung is one of Gwi's followers.\n\nJo Seung, Yang-sun's adopted father, is the secret keeper of the Crown Prince Jonghyun's memorandum. Jo Seung is a former servant of Yang-sun's biological father who served the late Crown Prince Lee Yoon's father as his Right Minister. Jo Seung was changed into vampire by Gwi as a punishment and tries to harm Yang-sun. Unbeknownst to Sung-yeol, Yang-sun was saved by him 10 years ago and Sung-yeol killed Yang-sun's father in order to save her. Although she has been bitten by her father, Yang-sun/Seo-jin did not change into a vampire because she has the blood of Gwi. Yang-sun's biological mother is the direct descendant of Gwi from her mother's side. Her biological mother had raised her as a boy in order to protect her because she knows that her daughter needs to be sacrificed as a weapon to kill Gwi.\n \nWhat is the secret plan in the Crown Prince Jonghyun's memorandum?

the daughter of a nobleman whose family loses everything when her father is framed for treason. To make ends meet, Yang-sun begins [[cross-dressing]] as a male bookseller and meets the handsome and mysterious scholar Kim Sung-yeol ([[Lee Joon-gi]]), who works at the [[Hongmungwan]]. Kim Sung-yeol has spent 120 years as a Guardian Vampire who is responsible for getting rid of any vampire who disobeys the rules. As a Guardian Vampire, he is able to go out in sunlight as long as he wears his special black robe. Sung-yeol continues to be haunted by the long-ago death of his first love, Lee Myung-hee ([[Kim So-eun]]), who sacrificed herself for him 120 years ago. Sung-yeol decides to pay Yang-sun a high price if she is able to find the memorandum of his best friend, the late Crown Prince Jonghyun, which contains the secret to killing Gwi ([[Lee Soo-hyuk]]) and avenge the death of his family and lover. After the second meeting with Yang-sun, Sung-yeol finds out that Yang-sun is a girl. However, he decides to keep it as a secret to avoid awkwardness with Yang-sun. Yang-sun tries very hard to find the memorandum as she promised since she also needs money to cure her sister's leg.\n \nOn a trip to find the old book seller from Yuan with Yang-sun, Sung-yeol meets Choi Hye-ryung, Myung-hee's present-day [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] who is an aloof nobleman's daughter. Hye-ryung's father is a Right Minister of the king. He has the highest authority in the king's court compared to other ministers. He has also been loyally serving Gwi for a long time. In order to prove his loyalty, he even sacrificed Hye-ryung when she was 10 years old to become Gwi's food toy. However, due to her loyalty and gentle treatment towards Gwi, he has unconsciously fallen in love with Hye-ryung and secretly plans to change her into a vampire, even though he already has 100% control of the royal court. Gwi resides in the underground royal palace and uses his powers and political machinations to prevent Crown Prince Lee Yoon ([[Shim Chang-min]]) from ascending to the throne, as he knows that Crown Prince Lee Yoon is secretly planning to get rid of him like his late ancestor, Crown Prince Jonghyun.\n\nGwi is also aware of Sung-yeol's plan to kill him. He becomes furious when he learns that Sung-yeol has gotten close to finding the secret to killing him. Gwi tries to harm Yang-sun several times, but Sung-yeol was able to save Yang-sun since Sung-yeol also has the ability to sense Gwi's presence. Gwi becomes anxious after he smells Yang-sun's blood and decides to get rid of Yang-sun as a precaution. After a while, Sung-yeol secretly falls in love with Yang-sun after he discovers that Hye-ryung is one of Gwi's followers.\n\nJo Seung, Yang-sun's adopted father, is the secret keeper of the Crown Prince Jonghyun's memorandum. Jo Seung is a former servant of Yang-sun's biological father who served the late Crown Prince Lee Yoon's father as his Right Minister. Jo Seung was changed into vampire by Gwi as a punishment and tries to harm Yang-sun. Unbeknownst to Sung-yeol, Yang-sun was saved by him 10 years ago and Sung-yeol killed Yang-sun's father in order to save her. Although she has been bitten by her father, Yang-sun/Seo-jin did not change into a vampire because she has the blood of Gwi. Yang-sun's biological mother is the direct descendant of Gwi from her mother's side. Her biological mother had raised her as a boy in order to protect her because she knows that her daughter needs to be sacrificed as a weapon to kill Gwi.\n \nWhat is the secret plan in the Crown Prince Jonghyun's memorandum? How can Sung-yeol save Yang-sun from being sacrificed? Will Lee Yoon become a puppet king controlled by Gwi like his ancestor? Will Sang-yeol and Yang-sun be able to live happily ever after?\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- LIMIT TO PRIMARY CAST PER [[WP:FILMCAST]] AND [[WP:INDISCRIMINATE]] -->\n\n===Main===\nMain lead Charracter--\n\n*[[Lee Joon-gi]] as Kim Sung-yeol (\"Night Scholar\")\n:A loyal and courageous scholar who is a close friend of Crown Prince Junghyun.
