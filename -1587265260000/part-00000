For this reason, synthetic shuttlecocks have been developed that replace the feathers with a plastic skirt. Players often refer to synthetic shuttlecocks as ''plastics'' and feathered shuttlecocks as ''feathers''.\n\nFeather shuttles need to be properly humidified for at least 4 hours prior to play in order to fly the correct distance at the proper speed and to last longer.  Properly humidified feathers flex during play, enhancing the shuttle's speed change and durability.  Dry feathers are brittle and break easily, causing the shuttle to wobble. Saturated feathers are 'mushy', making the feather cone narrow too much when strongly hit, which causes the shuttle to fly overly far and fast. Typically a humidification box is used, or a small moist sponge is inserted in the feather end of the closed shuttle tube container, avoiding any water contact with the cork of the shuttle. Shuttles are tested prior to play to make sure they fly true and at the proper speed, and cover the proper distance.  Different weights of shuttles are used to compensate for local atmospheric conditions.  Both humidity and height above sea level affect shuttle flight.  World Badminton Federation Rules say the shuttle should reach the far doubles service line plus or minus half the width of the tram. According to manufacturers proper shuttle will generally travel from the back line of the court to just short of the long doubles service line on the opposite side of the net, with a full underhand hit from an average player.<ref>Adapted from various Shuttlecock Manufacturer's recommendations - RSL, Yonex, Carleton, among others by J.

Shuttles are easily damaged and should be replaced every three or four games, and sooner if they are damaged and do not fly straight. This interferes with the game, as the impairment on the flight of the shuttle may misdirect the direction of the shuttlecock.\n\nMost experienced and skillful players greatly prefer feathers, and serious tournaments or leagues are always played using feather shuttlecocks of the highest quality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bwfbadminton.org/page.aspx?id=14913 |title=BWF's tournament sanctioned shuttlecocks |publisher=Badminton World Federation site |date= |accessdate=2011-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428235727/http://bwfbadminton.org/page.aspx?id=14913 |archive-date=2013-04-28 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe playing characteristics of plastics and feathers are substantially different.

Kennedy]]. The report was published by the Navy in 1854 as ''Exploration of the Valley of the Amazon''. The Navy ordered  \"10,000 additional copies be printed for the use of the Senate.\" It was circulated extensively, and cited in works on ethnology and natural history.<ref name=\"appletons\" />\n\n===SS ''Central America''===\n[[File:SSCentralAmerica.jpg|thumb|right|upright|SS ''Central America'']]\nAfter two years of active service on [[USS Potomac (1822)|''Potomac'']] and [[USS San Jacinto (1850)|''San Jacinto'']], Herndon was assigned in 1855 as commander of the Atlantic Mail Steamship Company [[steamship|steamer]] [[SS Central America|SS ''Central America'']], on the New York to Aspinwall, Panama, run. Navy captains were assigned to command the mail steamers on the Atlantic and Pacific runs; the ships were operated and maintained by companies under contract to the federal government. At the time, such mail steamers transported large quantities of gold from the California gold fields to cities on the East Coast and the [[US Mint]] in Philadelphia. (''Central America'' had recently been renamed from ''George Law''. Aspinwall was an English name for [[Col\u00f3n, Panama]].)\n\nHerndon was carrying perhaps 15 tons of gold (then worth $2,000,000) and 474 passengers, many of whom were from California and were returning to the East Coast, as well as 101 crew members. A few days after leaving Cuba on 7 September 1857, the ship encountered a three-day hurricane off [[Cape Hatteras]]. The hurricane steadily increased in force. By the 12th, the ''Central America'' was shipping water through several leaks due to the ship's lack of water-tight bulkheads and general unseaworthiness. Water in her hold put out her boiler fires, eliminating  steam for propulsion pumps.<ref name=\"appletons\" />\n\nHerndon recognized that his ship was doomed; he flew its flag upside down as a distress signal in hopes another ship would see them. At 2 p.m., the [[West Indian]] brig ''Marine'' arrived to help take passengers from the stricken steamer. It did not have room to take on all of the passengers and crew. Commander Herndon supervised the difficult loading of women and children into lifeboats to transfer to the ''Marine''. He gave one of the women passengers his watch to send to his wife, saying that he could not leave the ship while there was a soul on board. Most of the women and children reached safety on the ''Marine''. Herndon's concern for his passengers and crew helped save 152 of the 575 people on board.<ref name=\"reeves20\" />\n\nMen on the ''Central America'' tried to break up wooden parts to use as floats, in hopes of surviving the sinking.  Some were rescued later by passing vessels, but most of the 423 persons on board died in what was the largest loss of life for a commercial ship in United States history.<ref name=\"appletons\" /> Survivors of the disaster reported last seeing Commander Herndon in full uniform, standing by the wheelhouse with his hand on the rail, hat off and in his hand, with his head bowed in prayer as the ship gave a lurch and went down.\n\nThe ship disaster and loss of so much gold, which banks still depended on, contributed to the financial [[Panic of 1857]] in the United States.\n\nThe wreckage of the ship was discovered in a 1987 treasure recovery expedition.\n\n==Legacy==\nHerndon's memory has been honored in various ways:\n\n*His brother officers erected [[Herndon Monument]] in his honor at the U.S. Naval Academy.<ref name=\"appletons\"/>\n*The Navy has named two ships [[USS Herndon|USS ''Herndon'']] in his honor.\n*The towns of [[Herndon, Virginia]], and [[Herndon, Pennsylvania]], are also named for him.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{DANFS}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|William Lewis Herndon}}\n* Kinder, Gary, ''Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea,'' Boston: Atlantic Monthly, Inc. 1998. \n* [http://www.shipofgold.com/ Ship of Gold web site]\n* [http://www.pacificwestcom.com/klare/ Normand Klare, ''Final Voyage of the 'SS Central America' '']\n* {{Cite journal\n   |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=7K0P-ZCELsoC&dq=herndon+amazon&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0\n   |title=Exploration of the Valley of the Amazon\n   |first1=William Lewis\n   |last1=Herndon\n   |first2=Lardner\n   |last2=Gibbon\n   |publisher=Department of the Navy\n   |year=1854\n   |postscript=<!--None-->\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/h5/herndon-ii.htm USS ''Herndon''], ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'' Website\n* {{Gutenberg author|id=49581}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Herndon, William}}\n[[Category:1813 births]]\n[[Category:1857 deaths]]\n[[Category:American non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:American explorers]]\n[[Category:Military personnel from Fredericksburg, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Deaths due to shipwreck]]\n[[Category:United States Navy officers]]\n[[Category:Deaths in tropical cyclones]]\n[[Category:Explorers of Amazonia]]\n[[Category:Captains who went down with the ship]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:CMDR-Wm Lewis Herndon.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Commander William Lewis Herndon.

The Navy ordered  \"10,000 additional copies be printed for the use of the Senate.\" It was circulated extensively, and cited in works on ethnology and natural history.<ref name=\"appletons\" />\n\n===SS ''Central America''===\n[[File:SSCentralAmerica.jpg|thumb|right|upright|SS ''Central America'']]\nAfter two years of active service on [[USS Potomac (1822)|''Potomac'']] and [[USS San Jacinto (1850)|''San Jacinto'']], Herndon was assigned in 1855 as commander of the Atlantic Mail Steamship Company [[steamship|steamer]] [[SS Central America|SS ''Central America'']], on the New York to Aspinwall, Panama, run. Navy captains were assigned to command the mail steamers on the Atlantic and Pacific runs; the ships were operated and maintained by companies under contract to the federal government. At the time, such mail steamers transported large quantities of gold from the California gold fields to cities on the East Coast and the [[US Mint]] in Philadelphia. (''Central America'' had recently been renamed from ''George Law''. Aspinwall was an English name for [[Col\u00f3n, Panama]].)\n\nHerndon was carrying perhaps 15 tons of gold (then worth $2,000,000) and 474 passengers, many of whom were from California and were returning to the East Coast, as well as 101 crew members. A few days after leaving Cuba on 7 September 1857, the ship encountered a three-day hurricane off [[Cape Hatteras]]. The hurricane steadily increased in force. By the 12th, the ''Central America'' was shipping water through several leaks due to the ship's lack of water-tight bulkheads and general unseaworthiness. Water in her hold put out her boiler fires, eliminating  steam for propulsion pumps.<ref name=\"appletons\" />\n\nHerndon recognized that his ship was doomed; he flew its flag upside down as a distress signal in hopes another ship would see them. At 2 p.m., the [[West Indian]] brig ''Marine'' arrived to help take passengers from the stricken steamer. It did not have room to take on all of the passengers and crew. Commander Herndon supervised the difficult loading of women and children into lifeboats to transfer to the ''Marine''. He gave one of the women passengers his watch to send to his wife, saying that he could not leave the ship while there was a soul on board. Most of the women and children reached safety on the ''Marine''. Herndon's concern for his passengers and crew helped save 152 of the 575 people on board.<ref name=\"reeves20\" />\n\nMen on the ''Central America'' tried to break up wooden parts to use as floats, in hopes of surviving the sinking.  Some were rescued later by passing vessels, but most of the 423 persons on board died in what was the largest loss of life for a commercial ship in United States history.<ref name=\"appletons\" /> Survivors of the disaster reported last seeing Commander Herndon in full uniform, standing by the wheelhouse with his hand on the rail, hat off and in his hand, with his head bowed in prayer as the ship gave a lurch and went down.\n\nThe ship disaster and loss of so much gold, which banks still depended on, contributed to the financial [[Panic of 1857]] in the United States.\n\nThe wreckage of the ship was discovered in a 1987 treasure recovery expedition.\n\n==Legacy==\nHerndon's memory has been honored in various ways:\n\n*His brother officers erected [[Herndon Monument]] in his honor at the U.S. Naval Academy.<ref name=\"appletons\"/>\n*The Navy has named two ships [[USS Herndon|USS ''Herndon'']] in his honor.\n*The towns of [[Herndon, Virginia]], and [[Herndon, Pennsylvania]], are also named for him.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{DANFS}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|William Lewis Herndon}}\n* Kinder, Gary, ''Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea,'' Boston: Atlantic Monthly, Inc. 1998. \n* [http://www.shipofgold.com/ Ship of Gold web site]\n* [http://www.pacificwestcom.com/klare/ Normand Klare, ''Final Voyage of the 'SS Central America' '']\n* {{Cite journal\n   |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=7K0P-ZCELsoC&dq=herndon+amazon&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0\n   |title=Exploration of the Valley of the Amazon\n   |first1=William Lewis\n   |last1=Herndon\n   |first2=Lardner\n   |last2=Gibbon\n   |publisher=Department of the Navy\n   |year=1854\n   |postscript=<!--None-->\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/h5/herndon-ii.htm USS ''Herndon''], ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'' Website\n* {{Gutenberg author|id=49581}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Herndon, William}}\n[[Category:1813 births]]\n[[Category:1857 deaths]]\n[[Category:American non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:American explorers]]\n[[Category:Military personnel from Fredericksburg, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Deaths due to shipwreck]]\n[[Category:United States Navy officers]]\n[[Category:Deaths in tropical cyclones]]\n[[Category:Explorers of Amazonia]]\n[[Category:Captains who went down with the ship]]\n", "name_user": "Amkgp", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up,typo(s) fixed: President \u2192 president", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lewis_Herndon"}

Based on the [[Honda Civic]] platform, the del Sol was the successor to the popular [[Honda CR-X]]. It debuted in 1992 in Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nThe [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name ''del Sol'' translates to ''of the sun'', and refers to the car's opening roof. It featured a removable [[hardtop]] that stowed in the trunk and a retractable rear window. Manual and automatic \u201cTranstop\u201d roofs were available.\n\nThe Civic Del Sol SiR received acclaim in Japan as one of the first mass production cars to output more than 100 HP per litre and the first with an electronic targa roof. (Transtop model) During its debut on Japanese car show \u2018Best Motoring\u2019 reviewer [[Keiichi Tsuchiya]] declared the Del Sol SiR to be the most important Japanese sports car for a decade. Performance specifications for the JDM SiR give the 2-seater a 0-100 km/h (62 mph) time of 7 seconds and a standing quarter mile time of 14.7 as reviewed by \u201c[[Option (car magazine)|''Option'']]\u201d magazine in 1992.\n\nProduction and sales ended with the 1997 model in the U.S. and 1998 elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motor1.com/news/129479/worst-sports-cars-honda-delsol/|title=Worst Sports Cars: Honda Del Sol|last=Honda|website=Motor1.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-07}}</ref>\n\n==Specification==\nThe del Sol was first introduced to Japan, Europe, and North America in 1992 for the 1993 model year. Trim levels in the US were initially limited to the S and Si models powered by SOHC Honda D-series engines while the Japanese market received the SiR powered by the iconic {{convert|170|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} [[Honda_B_engine#JDM_B16A_SiR-II_(Second_Generation)|B16 SiR-II DOHC VTEC]] and featuring optional LSD. \n\nThe base \"S\" model (called the VXi in Japan from 1992\u20131994, but after 1995 called the VGi) came with a [[Honda D engine#D15B7|1.5 liter SOHC 16-valve four cylinder engine]] and rode on 13\" steel wheels, available only at ''[[Honda#Japan|Honda Verno]]'' Japanese dealerships. The Japanese VXi/VGi versions came with a Honda D15B-VTEC engine. This was an entry level VTEC engine that produced {{convert|128|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, matching the power of the 1.6 Si version. Despite the body resemblance to a mid-engined car design, the del Sol shared a front-engined design with the contemporary [[Honda Civic]].\n[[File:1997 Honda Civic CR-X ESi 1.6 Rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear]]\nThe \"Si\" (called the \"ESi\" in Europe) model came standard with a [[Honda D engine#D16Z6|1.6 liter SOHC 16-valve]] [[Inline-four engine|four cylinder engine]] . The Si also came with 14\" alloy wheels which were offered in an optional body color-matched paint scheme on Samba Green models, power side mirrors, [[cruise control]], rear [[disc brakes]], wider tires, and additional front & rear [[anti-sway bar]]s.\n\nDepending on model and market, the options included a rear [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]], custom floor mats, an [[automatic transmission]], power steering, heated mirrors, front fog lights (1993\u20131995 models only), traction control system (JDM only), limited slip differential (JDM only), and [[air conditioning]].\n\n==Colors==\nThe 1993-1994 USDM Del Sol came in 5 colors: Captiva Blue Pearl (color code B62P), Frost White (code NH538), Granada Black Pearl (code NH503P), Milano Red (code R81), and Samba Green Pearl (code GY15P). For 1995, Honda replaced Captiva Blue Pearl and Samba Green Pearl with Isle Green Pearl (code G71P) and Paradise Blue-Green Pearl (code BG33P). For 1996-1997, Honda removed the Paradise Blue-Green Pearl color, replaced Isle Green Pearl with Cypress Green Pearl (code G82P), and added Vogue Silver Metallic (NH583M).<ref>http://www.hondareference.com/delsol</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align:center\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n!\t\t!!colspan=2 |\t1993\t\t\t\t\t!!colspan=3 |\t1994\t\t\t\t\t!!colspan=3 |\t1995\t\t\t\t\t!!colspan=3 |\t1996\t\t\t\t\t!!colspan=3|1997\t\t\t\t\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n!\tColor name\t!!\tS\t!!\tSi\t!!\tS\t!!\tSi\t!!\tVTEC\t!!\tS\t!!\tSi\t!!\tVTEC\t!!\tS\t!!\tSi\t!!\tVTEC\t!!\tS   !!

It featured a removable [[hardtop]] that stowed in the trunk and a retractable rear window. Manual and automatic \u201cTranstop\u201d roofs were available.\n\nThe Civic Del Sol SiR received acclaim in Japan as one of the first mass production cars to output more than 100 HP per litre and the first with an electronic targa roof. (Transtop model) During its debut on Japanese car show \u2018Best Motoring\u2019 reviewer [[Keiichi Tsuchiya]] declared the Del Sol SiR to be the most important Japanese sports car for a decade. Performance specifications for the JDM SiR give the 2-seater a 0-100 km/h (62 mph) time of 7 seconds and a standing quarter mile time of 14.7 as reviewed by \u201c[[Option (car magazine)|''Option'']]\u201d magazine in 1992.\n\nProduction and sales ended with the 1997 model in the U.S. and 1998 elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motor1.com/news/129479/worst-sports-cars-honda-delsol/|title=Worst Sports Cars: Honda Del Sol|last=Honda|website=Motor1.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-07}}</ref>\n\n==Specification==\nThe del Sol was first introduced to Japan, Europe, and North America in 1992 for the 1993 model year. Trim levels in the US were initially limited to the S and Si models powered by SOHC Honda D-series engines while the Japanese market received the SiR powered by the iconic {{convert|170|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} [[Honda_B_engine#JDM_B16A_SiR-II_(Second_Generation)|B16 SiR-II DOHC VTEC]] and featuring optional LSD. \n\nThe base \"S\" model (called the VXi in Japan from 1992\u20131994, but after 1995 called the VGi) came with a [[Honda D engine#D15B7|1.5 liter SOHC 16-valve four cylinder engine]] and rode on 13\" steel wheels, available only at ''[[Honda#Japan|Honda Verno]]'' Japanese dealerships. The Japanese VXi/VGi versions came with a Honda D15B-VTEC engine. This was an entry level VTEC engine that produced {{convert|128|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, matching the power of the 1.6 Si version. Despite the body resemblance to a mid-engined car design, the del Sol shared a front-engined design with the contemporary [[Honda Civic]].\n[[File:1997 Honda Civic CR-X ESi 1.6 Rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear]]\nThe \"Si\" (called the \"ESi\" in Europe) model came standard with a [[Honda D engine#D16Z6|1.6 liter SOHC 16-valve]] [[Inline-four engine|four cylinder engine]] . The Si also came with 14\" alloy wheels which were offered in an optional body color-matched paint scheme on Samba Green models, power side mirrors, [[cruise control]], rear [[disc brakes]], wider tires, and additional front & rear [[anti-sway bar]]s.\n\nDepending on model and market, the options included a rear [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]], custom floor mats, an [[automatic transmission]], power steering, heated mirrors, front fog lights (1993\u20131995 models only), traction control system (JDM only), limited slip differential (JDM only), and [[air conditioning]].\n\n==Colors==\nThe 1993-1994 USDM Del Sol came in 5 colors: Captiva Blue Pearl (color code B62P), Frost White (code NH538), Granada Black Pearl (code NH503P), Milano Red (code R81), and Samba Green Pearl (code GY15P). For 1995, Honda replaced Captiva Blue Pearl and Samba Green Pearl with Isle Green Pearl (code G71P) and Paradise Blue-Green Pearl (code BG33P). For 1996-1997, Honda removed the Paradise Blue-Green Pearl color, replaced Isle Green Pearl with Cypress Green Pearl (code G82P), and added Vogue Silver Metallic (NH583M).<ref>http://www.hondareference.com/delsol</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align:center\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n!\t\t!!colspan=2 |\t1993\t\t\t\t\t!!colspan=3 |\t1994\t\t\t\t\t!!colspan=3 |\t1995\t\t\t\t\t!!colspan=3 |\t1996\t\t\t\t\t!!colspan=3|1997\t\t\t\t\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n!\tColor name\t!!\tS\t!!\tSi\t!!\tS\t!!\tSi\t!!\tVTEC\t!!\tS\t!!\tSi\t!!\tVTEC\t!!\tS\t!!\tSi\t!!\tVTEC\t!!\tS   !!

The roof is operated by flicking two catches above the windows, then holding down a button. The trunk lid raises vertically and two arms extend into the targa top. After locking the lid to the arms, the arms pull the targa into the trunk lid, which lowers back down with the roof inside. The open process is reversed for the closure and return of the targa top.<ref>{{YouTube|id=PDFEKHwXnxA|title=Honda CR-X del Sol TransTop demonstration }}</ref>\n\n== Model updates ==\nAutumn 1992 ('93 model year):\n*CR-X del Sol launched in Japan with two trim levels - VXi and  SiR (170 PS VTEC w/ optional limited slip differential) (JDM)\n\n*Civic del Sol launched in USA with two trim levels - S  and Si  (US)\n\n*CR-X del Sol launched in Europe with two trim levels- ESi and VTi (EDM)\n\nUSDM Changes for 1994:\n*Added VTEC trim level, with [[Honda_B_engine#B16A3|B16A3]] engine (DOHC VTEC) {{convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|118|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} (US),  9000 rpm tachometer, and improved suspension (US)\n*S trim level receives front sway bar\n*Dual SRS airbags standard (US)\n\nChanges for 1995:\n*Civic tag dropped from US del Sol name.

It includes the Basque provinces of [[\u00c1lava]], [[Biscay]], and [[Gipuzkoa]].\n\nThe Basque Country or Basque Autonomous Community was granted the status of ''[[Nationalities and regions of Spain|nationality]]'' within Spain, attributed by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]]. The autonomous community is based on the [[Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country]], a foundational legal document providing the framework for the development of the [[Basque people]] on [[Southern Basque Country|Spanish soil]].\n\nCurrently there is no official capital in the autonomous community, but the city of [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]], in the province of \u00c1lava, is the de facto capital as the location of the [[Basque Parliament]], the headquarters of the [[Basque Government]], and the residence of the President of the Basque Autonomous Community (the [[Ajuria Enea|Palace of Ajuria Enea]]). The [[High Courts of Justice of Spain|High Court of Justice of the Basque Country]] has its headquarters in the city of [[Bilbao]]. Whilst Vitoria-Gasteiz is the largest municipality in area, with 277&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (107 sq mi), Bilbao is the largest in population, with 353,187 people, located in the province of Biscay within a conurbation of 875,552 people.\n\nThe term ''Basque Country'' may also refer to the [[Basque Country (greater region)|larger cultural region]] (Basque: ''Euskal Herria''), the home of the Basque people, which includes the autonomous community.\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Physical geography of Euskal Herria}}\nThe following [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]] make up the autonomous community:\n\n* [[\u00c1lava]] (Basque ''Araba''), capital [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]]\n* [[Biscay]] (Spanish ''Vizcaya'', Basque ''Bizkaia''), capital [[Bilbao]]-Bilbo\n* [[Gipuzkoa]] (Spanish ''Guip\u00fazcoa''), capital [[Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n]]\n\n===Features===\n[[Image:Txindoki mountain from Lazkaomendi.jpg|thumb|220px|Txindoki mountain from Lazkaomendi]]\n[[Image:Mundaka.JPG|thumb|Basque coast near [[Mundaka]]]]\n[[Image:Rioja vineyards.JPG|thumb|Rioja vineyards near the Ebro]]\nThe Basque Country borders [[Cantabria]] and the [[Burgos province]] to the west, the [[Bay of Biscay]] to the north, [[France]] ([[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]]) and [[Navarre]] to the east and [[La Rioja, Spain|La Rioja]] (the [[Ebro River]]) to the south. The territory has three distinct areas, which are defined by the two parallel ranges of the [[Basque Mountains]]. The main range of mountains forms the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] between the Atlantic and Mediterranean basins. The highest point of the range is in the [[Aizkorri]] massif (1551 m). The three areas are:\n\n====Atlantic Basin====\nFormed by many valleys with short rivers that flow from the mountains to the [[Bay of Biscay]], like the [[Nervi\u00f3n]], [[Urola]] or [[Oria (river)|Oria]].\nThe coast is rough, with high cliffs and small inlets. The main features of the coast are the [[Bilbao Abra]] Bay and the [[Estuary of Bilbao]], the [[Urdaibai]] estuary and the [[Bidasoa-Txingudi]] Bay that forms the border with France.\n\n====Middle section====\nBetween the two mountain ranges, the area is occupied mainly by a high plateau called ''Llanada Alavesa'' (the [[\u00c1lava]] Plains), where the capital Vitoria-Gasteiz is located. The rivers flow south from the mountains to the Ebro River. The main rivers are the [[Zadorra River]] and [[Bayas River]].\n\n====Ebro Valley====\nFrom the southern mountains to the Ebro is the so-called ''Rioja Alavesa'', which shares the Mediterranean characteristics of other Ebro Valley zones. Some of Spain's production of [[Rioja wine]] takes place here.\n\n===Climate===\nThe Basque mountains form the watershed and also mark the distinct climatic areas of the Basque Country:\nThe northern valleys, in Biscay and Gipuzkoa and also the valley of Ayala in \u00c1lava, are part of [[Green Spain]], where the [[oceanic climate]] is predominant, with its wet weather all year round and moderate temperatures. Precipitation average is about 1200&nbsp;mm.\n\nThe middle section is influenced more by the [[continental climate]], but with a varying degree of the northern oceanic climate.

After the advent of the [[Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country]] in 1982 following Franco's death, this reductive trend was gradually reversed thanks to the Basque language schools and the new education system.

To this, the \"NO\" vote in this referendum was also higher in the Basque Country than in the rest of the state. All in all, many Basques believe that they are not bound to a constitution that they never endorsed.\n\nThe Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country is an organic law but powers have been devolved gradually during decades according to re-negotiations between the Spanish and the consecutive Basque regional governments to reach an effective implementation, while the transfer of many powers are still due and has always been a matter of heated political discussion. Basque nationalists often put down this limitation in the devolution of powers to concessions made to appease the military involved in the [[23-F]] coup d'\u00e9tat attempt (1981).\n\nIn 2003, the governing [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) proposed to alter this statute through the [[Ibarretxe Plan]]. The Ibarretxe bill was approved by absolute majority in the Basque Parliament after much discussion, as it was subject to lengthy legal objections&mdash;on the grounds that it contradicts the Spanish Constitution&mdash;that were ultimately overcome. Despite its mandate of the majority of the autonomous Parliament, the main two parties in Spain (PSOE, PP) imposed a blockade on a discussion of the Plan in the Spanish Parliament ([[Madrid]] [[Cortes Generales]]), resulting in its rejection for debate by a large majority of that Parliament in January 2005.\n\nSince the first autonomic cabinet, the Basque Nationalist Party has held office in the Basque Autonomous Community except for a 2009-2012 term, led by Patxi L\u00f3pez (PSE-PSOE).

The new king upheld their institutional system issued from the [[Custom (law)|consuetudinary law]] prevalent in Basque and Pyrenean territories. This limited self-government, similar to the one for [[Navarre]], was partially suppressed in 1839 and totally in 1876 in exchange for an agreement on tax-collection and a number of administrative prerogatives.

Basque officials have strongly advocated for participation, along with Navarre, in the [[Ecofin]], with a full membership, in order to defend Basque interests in line with Basque reality and fiscal status, and not as a Spanish subsidiary.\n\n===Transport===\n[[Image:Puente Txonta.jpg|thumb|AP-8 in [[Eibar]]]]\nThe strategic geographical location of the Basque Country as a link between the northwest and centre of Spain and the rest of Europe makes this territory heavily transited.\n\n====Road====\nThe main backbones of road transport are the [[Autopista AP-8|AP-8 motorway]] which links Bilbao, San Sebasti\u00e1n and the French border and the [[Autov\u00eda A-1|A-1 motorway]] which links San Sebasti\u00e1n and Vitoria-Gasteiz with central Spain. Other important routes include the [[Autopista AP-68|AP-68 motorway]] which links Bilbao with the Mediterranean.\n\n====Rail====\n[[Eusko Trenbide Sarea]] (''Basque Railway Network'') is the Basque Government-owned company that maintains and creates the railway infrastructure in the autonomous region. [[EuskoTren]] (''Basque Train'') is the Basque Government-owned [[narrow gauge]] rail company that operates commuter services in Bilbao and San Sebasti\u00e1n, intercity Bilbao-San Sebasti\u00e1n service, and [[EuskoTran]] tram services in Bilbao and Vitoria-Gasteiz.\n\n[[Metro Bilbao]] operates two [[rapid transit|metro]] lines that serve the Greater Bilbao area while EuskoTren operates a third which opened in 2017. EuskoTren operates a metro service in the San Sebasti\u00e1n area, known as [[Metro Donostialdea]].\n\nThe Spanish government owns two main [[RENFE]] [[Iberian-gauge railways|broad gauge]] lines that link Vitoria-Gasteiz with San Sebasti\u00e1n and Bilbao with central Spain. It also operates [[Cercan\u00edas]] commuter lines in both Bilbao and San Sebasti\u00e1n.\n[[Image:Euskal Y.PNG|thumb|The Basque Y]]\nThe [[FEVE]] narrow gauge rail company operates a commuter line between Bilbao and [[Balmaseda]] and links Bilbao with the rest of northern Spain.\n\nA new [[high-speed rail|high-speed]] network (called [[Basque Y]]) currently under construction will link the three capitals in 'Y' formation. Because of the rough geography of the territory, most of the network will run through tunnels, with a total estimated cost of up to \u20ac10 billion.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe estimated ecological impact of the project has encouraged the formation of a group campaigning against it called ''AHTrik Ez Elkarlana''. The group uses social disobedience to oppose the project and promotes referendums against it in the towns it most affects. In spite of the vocal opposition to the project by this and other community groups (as well as [[EH Bildu]]), work continues, not without uncertainty. In early 2015, an estimate suggested that the average Basque intercity fare would rise to a non-competitive 25 \u20ac, while the Spanish central government's funding has been subject to continuous delays, spurring the irritation of the Basque government in Vitoria-Gasteiz.\n\n====Airports====\n[[Image:Aeropuerto Bilbao Loiu 01.jpg|thumb|Bilbao Airport]]\nThe three capitals have airports:\n*[[Bilbao Airport]] (BIO) International\n*[[Vitoria Airport]] (VIT)\n*[[San Sebasti\u00e1n Airport]] (EAS)\nOf the three, the most important hub and entry point to the Basque Country is Bilbao Airport, offering many international connections.

The first Spanish restaurant to be awarded 3 stars in the Michelin Guide was, in fact, ''Zalaca\u00edn'', a Basque restaurant, although located in Madrid. Today, the Basque Country, alongside Catalonia, is the Spanish region with a higher density of stars in the Michelin Guide, and it has become a preferred destination of many gastronomic tourists, both domestic and international. Four restaurants boast 3 stars, the highest possible award: Juan Mar\u00eda Arzak (''Arzak'' restaurant), [[Mart\u00edn Berasategui]] (''Berasategui'' restaurant), Pedro Subijana (chef of ''Akelarre'') and [[Eneko Atxa]] (''Azurmendi'' restaurant). In the new generation of chefs, [[Andoni Luis Aduriz]], ''Mugaritz'' restaurant, is outstanding.\n\nThe coastal city of [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] is home to the [[Basque Culinary Center]], an academic research institution focused on higher education and research in the areas of gastronomy and nutrition.\n\nBasque food is one of the reasons for [[tourism in the Basque Country|tourism to the Basque Country]], especially the ''pintxos''. A popular way to socialise is \"''ir de pintxos''\" or ''txikiteo'', a Basque version of a [[pub crawl]], albeit generally more civilised.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Sara JaI Alai Lapurdi.JPG|thumb|[[Basque pelota|Pelota]] ([[jai alai]]) court in Sara, Lapurdi ]]\n[[Basque rural sports]], known as ''Herri Kirolak'' in [[Basque language|Basque]], are a number of sports competitions rooted in the traditional lifestyles of the [[Basque people]], for example [[Basque pelota]], the Basque version of the European game family that includes [[real tennis]] and [[squash (sport)|squash]]. Basque players, playing for either the Spanish or the French teams, dominate international competitions.\n\nThe Basque country is also home to former national football [[List of Spanish football champions|champions]] [[Athletic Bilbao|Athletic Club]] from Bilbao. It has a strict ''[[Cantera]]'' policy of [[Athletic Bilbao signing policy|employing only players born or trained]] in the [[Basque Country (greater region)]]. Athletic's policy does not apply to head coaches, with famous names as [[Howard Kendall]] and [[Jupp Heynckes]] coaching the team at various points. In spite of this, the club shares with worldwide heavyweights [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[FC Barcelona]] the distinction of never being relegated from the top flight.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/athletic-bilbao-how-a-proud-basque-team-is-resisting-globalization-a-546860.html|title=Athletic Bilbao: How a proud Basque team is resisting globalization|first=Walter|last=Mayr|publisher=Der Spiegel|date=11 April 2008|accessdate=19 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nAnother major Basque Country club is [[Real Sociedad]] from San Sebasti\u00e1n, who contest the [[Basque derby]] with Athletic. Real Sociedad used to practise the same policy, until they signed Irish [[Striker (football)|striker]] [[John Aldridge]] in the late 1980s. Since then, Real Sociedad have had many foreign players. [[Xabi Alonso]] became the only Basque player to win both the World Cup and the club [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] and he played in the [[Real Sociedad]].  The region is also home to other [[La Liga]] clubs [[SD Eibar]] and [[Deportivo Alav\u00e9s]].\n\nThe most renowned Basque footballer of all time is possibly [[Andoni Zubizarreta]] who holds the record for appearances in [[La Liga]] with 622 games and has won six league titles and the [[European Cup]]. Nowadays, the best known Basque football player is Xabi Alonso, winner of two UEFA European Championships and one [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], who played for Real Sociedad, Liverpool, Real Madrid and [[Bayern Munich]], but retired in 2017. Other notable Basque players include [[Mikel Arteta]], [[Asier Illarramendi]], [[Andoni Iraola]], [[Aritz Aduriz]], [[Xabi Prieto]] and [[Ander Herrera]]. Both Athletic and Real Sociedad have won the Spanish league, including dominating the competition in the early 1980s, with the last title won by a Basque club being Athletic's [[1983\u201384 La Liga|1984 title]].\n\nAt international level, Basque players were especially prominent in [[Spain national football team|Spanish selections]] prior to the Civil War, with all of those at the [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team squads#Spain|1928 Olympics]], and the majority of the [[Football at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team squads#Spain|1920 Olympics]] and [[1934 FIFA World Cup squads#Spain|1934 World Cup]] squads, born in the region. There is an [[Basque Country national football team|unofficial 'national' team]] which plays occasional friendlies, however its squads pick players from the wider territory including Navarre and the French Basque Country.\n \nCycling as a sport is popular in the Basque Country. [[Abraham Olano]] has won the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] and the [[UCI Road World Championships|World Championship]]. The [[UCI World Tour]] {{ct|MOV}} hails from the Basque Country.<ref>{{cite news|title=2009 Riders and teams Database - Cyclingnews.com |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/teams/2009/caisse-depargne|accessdate=14 August 2009}}</ref> The Caisse d'\u00c9pargne cycling team traces its history back to the '''Banesto''' team that included [[Miguel Indur\u00e1in]]. The region is home to the [[Tour of the Basque Country]] stage race and the [[Clasica de San Sebastian]] one day race. The {{ct|EUS}} team was also part of the World Tour until its disbandment in 2014. It was an unofficial Basque national team and was partly funded by the Basque Government. Its riders were either Basque, or at least grown up in the Basque cycling culture, and former members of the team have been strong contenders in the [[Tour de France]] held annually in July and [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] held in September. Team leaders have included riders such as [[Iban Mayo]], [[Haimar Zubeldia]], [[Samuel S\u00e1nchez]], [[David Etxebarria]], [[Igor Ant\u00f3n]], [[Mikel Landa]] and [[Mikel Nieve]].\n\n==Notable people==\nSome notable Basque people from this administrative jurisdiction include [[Francisco de Vitoria]], philosopher who set the theories of just war, international law and freedom of commerce; [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano]], completed first circumnavigation of the Earth; [[Ignatius of Loyola]], founder of the Jesuits; [[Don Juan de O\u00f1ate]], explorer of the great plains and Colorado river; [[Blas de Lezo]], naval strategist, best remembered for his defensive tactics at the [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias]]; [[Jorge Oteiza]] sculptor; [[Paco Rabanne]], fashion designer; [[Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga]], fashion designer; [[Xabi Alonso]] and [[Mikel Arteta]], footballers; [[Edurne Pasaban]], first woman to climb all of the fourteen eight-thousander peaks in the World; [[Elena Arzak]], best female chef in the world (2012); [[Jon Kortajarena]] male model; [[Jose-Maria Cundin]], artist; [[Fernando Savater]] philosopher; [[Miguel de Unamuno]], essayist, novelist, poet, playwright, philosopher.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Basque|Spain}}\n* [[Basque Country (greater region)]]\n* [[Basque mythology]]\n* [[Basque breeds and cultivars]]\n* [[Livestock in the Basque Country]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n* Pierson, Peter (1999).

It includes the Basque provinces of [[\u00c1lava]], [[Biscay]], and [[Gipuzkoa]].\n\nThe Basque Country or Basque Autonomous Community was granted the status of ''[[Nationalities and regions of Spain|nationality]]'' within Spain, attributed by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]]. The autonomous community is based on the [[Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country]], a foundational legal document providing the framework for the development of the [[Basque people]] on [[Southern Basque Country|Spanish soil]]. Navarre, which had narrowly rejected a joint statute of autonomy with Gipuzkoa, \u00c1lava and Biscay in 1932,<ref>Blinhorn, Martin ''The Basque Ulster': Navarre and the Basque Autonomy Question under the Spanish Second Republic'' The Historical Journal Vol. 17, No. 3 (Sep., 1974), pp. 595-613</ref> was granted a separate statute in 1982.\n\nCurrently there is no official capital in the autonomous community, but the city of [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]], in the province of \u00c1lava, is the de facto capital as the location of the [[Basque Parliament]], the headquarters of the [[Basque Government]], and the residence of the President of the Basque Autonomous Community (the [[Ajuria Enea|Palace of Ajuria Enea]]). The [[High Courts of Justice of Spain|High Court of Justice of the Basque Country]] has its headquarters in the city of [[Bilbao]]. Whilst Vitoria-Gasteiz is the largest municipality in area, with 277&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (107 sq mi), Bilbao is the largest in population, with 353,187 people, located in the province of Biscay within a conurbation of 875,552 people.\n\nThe term ''Basque Country'' may also refer to the [[Basque Country (greater region)|larger cultural region]] (Basque: ''Euskal Herria''), the home of the Basque people, which includes the autonomous community.\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Physical geography of Euskal Herria}}\nThe following [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]] make up the autonomous community:\n\n* [[\u00c1lava]] (Basque ''Araba''), capital [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]]\n* [[Biscay]] (Spanish ''Vizcaya'', Basque ''Bizkaia''), capital [[Bilbao]]-Bilbo\n* [[Gipuzkoa]] (Spanish ''Guip\u00fazcoa''), capital [[Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n]]\n\n===Features===\n[[Image:Txindoki mountain from Lazkaomendi.jpg|thumb|220px|Txindoki mountain from Lazkaomendi]]\n[[Image:Mundaka.JPG|thumb|Basque coast near [[Mundaka]]]]\n[[Image:Rioja vineyards.JPG|thumb|Rioja vineyards near the Ebro]]\nThe Basque Country borders [[Cantabria]] and the [[Burgos province]] to the west, the [[Bay of Biscay]] to the north, [[France]] ([[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]]) and [[Navarre]] to the east and [[La Rioja, Spain|La Rioja]] (the [[Ebro River]]) to the south.

The main range of mountains forms the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] between the Atlantic and Mediterranean basins. The highest point of the range is in the [[Aizkorri]] massif (1551 m). The three areas are:\n\n====Atlantic Basin====\nFormed by many valleys with short rivers that flow from the mountains to the [[Bay of Biscay]], like the [[Nervi\u00f3n]], [[Urola]] or [[Oria (river)|Oria]].\nThe coast is rough, with high cliffs and small inlets. The main features of the coast are the [[Bilbao Abra]] Bay and the [[Estuary of Bilbao]], the [[Urdaibai]] estuary and the [[Bidasoa-Txingudi]] Bay that forms the border with France.\n\n====Middle section====\nBetween the two mountain ranges, the area is occupied mainly by a high plateau called ''Llanada Alavesa'' (the [[\u00c1lava]] Plains), where the capital Vitoria-Gasteiz is located. The rivers flow south from the mountains to the Ebro River. The main rivers are the [[Zadorra River]] and [[Bayas River]].\n\n====Ebro Valley====\nFrom the southern mountains to the Ebro is the so-called ''Rioja Alavesa'', which shares the Mediterranean characteristics of other Ebro Valley zones. Some of Spain's production of [[Rioja wine]] takes place here.\n\n===Climate===\nThe [[Basque Mountains]] form the watershed and also mark the distinct climatic areas of the Basque Country:\nThe northern valleys, in Biscay and Gipuzkoa and also the valley of Ayala in \u00c1lava, are part of [[Green Spain]], where the [[oceanic climate]] is predominant, with its wet weather all year round and moderate temperatures. Precipitation average is about 1200&nbsp;mm.\n\nThe middle section is influenced more by the [[continental climate]], but with a varying degree of the northern oceanic climate. This gives warm, dry summers and cold, snowy winters.\n\nThe Ebro valley has a pure continental climate: winters are cold and dry and summers very warm and dry, with precipitation peaking in spring and autumn. Precipitation is scarce and irregular, as low as 300&nbsp;mm.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|Immigration to Spain}}\n\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote = Source: [[Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (Spain)|INE]]\n|1900| 603596\n|1910| 673788\n|1920| 766775\n|1930| 891710\n|1940| 955764\n|1950| 1061240\n|1960| 1371654\n|1970| 1878636\n|1981| 2141969\n|1991| 2104041\n|2001| 2082587\n|2011| 2185393\n|2017| 2167707\n}}\n\nAlmost half of the 2,155,546 inhabitants of the Basque Autonomous Community live in [[Greater Bilbao]], Bilbao's metropolitan area.

The Basque-speaking areas in the modern-day autonomous community are set against the wider context of the Basque language, spoken to the east in Navarre and the French Basque Country. The whole Basque speaking territory has experienced both decline and expansion in its history.

Basque has always had a strong presence in most of [[Gipuzkoa]], central and eastern [[Biscay]] and the northern edge of [[\u00c1lava]], while most Basque speakers in western Biscay and the rest of \u00c1lava are second-language speakers.\n\nThe 2006 sociolinguistic survey<ref>''IV. Inkesta Soziolinguistikoa'' Gobierno Vasco, Servicio Central de Publicaciones del Gobierno Vasco 2008, {{ISBN|978-84-457-2775-1}}</ref> of all Basque provinces showed that in 2006 of all people aged 16 and above in the Basque Autonomous Community, 30.1% were fluent Basque speakers, 18.3% passive speakers and 51.5% did not speak Basque. The percentage of Basque speakers was highest in Gipuzkoa (49.1% speakers) and lowest in \u00c1lava (14.2%). These results represent an increase on previous years (29.5% in 2001, 27.7% in 1996 and 24.1% in 1991). The highest percentage of speakers was now be found in the 16-24 age range (57.5%), while only 25.0% of those 65 and older reported speaking Basque.\n\nTen years later, the sociolinguistic survey showed that in 2016 of all people aged 16 and above in the Basque Autonomous Community, 33.9% were fluent Basque speakers, 19.1% passive speakers and 47% did not speak Basque. The proportion of Basque speakers was again highest in Gipuzkoa (50.6%) and lowest in \u00c1lava (19.2%).\n\n==History==\n:''This section is about the history of the Autonomous Community since 1978.

To this, the \"NO\" vote in this referendum was also higher in the Basque Country than in the rest of the state. All in all, many Basques believe that they are not bound to a constitution that they never endorsed.\n\nThe Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country is an organic law but powers have been devolved gradually during decades according to re-negotiations between the Spanish and the consecutive Basque regional governments to reach an effective implementation, while the transfer of many powers are still due and has always been a matter of heated political discussion. Basque nationalists often put down this limitation in the devolution of powers to concessions made to appease the military involved in the [[23-F]] coup d'\u00e9tat attempt (1981).\n\nIn 2003, the governing [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) proposed to alter this statute through the [[Ibarretxe Plan]]. The Ibarretxe bill was approved by absolute majority in the Basque Parliament after much discussion, as it was subject to lengthy legal objections&mdash;on the grounds that it contradicts the Spanish Constitution&mdash;that were ultimately overcome. Despite its mandate of the majority of the autonomous Parliament, the main two parties in Spain (PSOE, PP) imposed a blockade on a discussion of the Plan in the Spanish Parliament ([[Madrid]] [[Cortes Generales]]), resulting in its rejection for debate by a large majority of that Parliament in January 2005.\n\nSince the first autonomic cabinet, the Basque Nationalist Party has held office in the Basque Autonomous Community except for a 2009\u20132012 term, led by Patxi L\u00f3pez (PSE-PSOE). The current Basque prime minister is [[I\u00f1igo Urkullu]], also a member of the [[Basque Nationalist Party]]. Despite [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]'s ceasefire in 2011, this autonomous community shows the highest rate of police per 100 inhabitants in Western Europe by 2018. As agreed with the Spanish premier [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero|Zapatero]] in 2004, Urkullu intends to increase the figure of [[Ertzaintza|ertzainas]], while the Spanish [[People's Party (Spain)|PP]]'s Ministry of Interior rejects a pullback of Spanish police bodies, as demanded by the large majority of the political forces in the autonomous parliament, even pointing to an increase of the Guardia Civil in the future.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.publico.es/espana/euskadi-lugar-vigilado-europa-occidental.html|title=El lugar m\u00e1s vigilado de Europa Occidental quiere m\u00e1s polic\u00edas|access-date=2018-01-19|language=es-ES}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.publico.es/espana/bildu-pide-menor-presencia-policial.html|title=Bildu pide menor presencia policial en Euskadi|access-date=2018-01-19|language=es-ES}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Governmental institutions===\n[[Image:Parlamento vasco 1.jpg|thumb|200px|Basque parliament building in Vitoria-Gasteiz]]\nThe current laws configure the autonomous community as a federation of its present-day three constituent provinces. These western Basque districts kept governing themselves by their own laws and institutions even after the Castilian conquest in 1200. The new king upheld their institutional system issued from the [[Custom (law)|consuetudinary law]] prevalent in Basque and Pyrenean territories. This limited self-government, similar to the one for [[Navarre]], was partially suppressed in 1839 and totally in 1876 in exchange for an agreement on tax-collection and a number of administrative prerogatives.

A negotiation between [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|UCD]]'s Su\u00e1rez in office and PNV led to the establishment of the Basque statute, with its first article stating that the [[Basque people]] (''Euskal Herria'') takes on an institutional personality in the form of the Basque Autonomous Community; the 2nd article goes on to establish that it may be constituted by \u00c1lava, Biscay, Gipuzkoa, as well as [[Navarre]] .<ref>{{cite news|title=El pueblo vasco se constituye en comunidad aut\u00f3noma|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1979/07/18/espana/301096804_850215.html|accessdate=2016-12-19|newspaper=El Pa\u00eds|date=1979-07-18}}</ref> Provincial councils provided with actual relevant attributions (taxation, etc.) were restored to these provinces (called therefore ''diputaci\u00f3n foral''), but Navarre [[History of the Basque people#The present|detached from the Basque political process]].

However, the leading party PNV renewed its traditional alliance with the [[Socialist Party of the Basque Country\u2013Basque Country Left|PSE]] to form government.\n\nDuring the [[2017 Catalan independence referendum|2017 Catalan referendum]] crisis, the parliament showed its sympathy and support to the Catalan independence referendum and lashed out at the Spanish government's stance on the issue, denouncing any measures it may take against the vote or 'democracy' altogether.<ref>{{cite news|title=El Parlamento Vasco muestra su apoyo al refer\u00e9ndum catal\u00e1n|url=http://www.eitb.eus/es/noticias/politica/detalle/5109235/el-parlamento-vasco-muestra-su-apoyo-al-referendum-catalan/|accessdate=2017-10-01|newspaper=EITB|date=2017-09-28}}</ref> Besides supporting the vote, Basques of this community showed a preference for further self-government (43,5%), with independence and present-day ''status quo'' ranking as second and third options (22,6% and 18,9%).<ref>{{cite news|title=La sociedad vasca empatiza con Catalu\u00f1a, pero no aplicar\u00eda su modelo|url=http://www.eitb.eus/es/tag/eitb-focus/|accessdate=10 October 2017|newspaper=EITB|date=9 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the parliament of the autonomous community passed a Police Abuses Act spanning the period between 1978 and 1999; it was shortly after challenged by the public prosecutor and appealed also by virtually all police and Civil Guard unions.

The Basque Government used the \"[[Laurak Bat]]\", which included the arms of Navarre, as its symbol for many years. The Navarrese Government protested, and tribunals ruled in their favour. The Basque Government replaced it with an empty red field.\n\nNavarre is one of the historical Basque territories and even claimed by the [[Basque nationalism|Basque nationalists]] as the core of the Basque nation. There are also two [[enclave]]s surrounded by Basque territory\u2014[[Enclave of Trevi\u00f1o|Trevi\u00f1o]] (Basque: ''Trebi\u00f1u'') and [[Valle de Villaverde]] (Basque: ''Villaverde-Turtzioz'')\u2014which belong to the fellow neighbouring communities of [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]] and [[Cantabria]] respectively, for which a legal connection to the Basque Country has become an on-off matter of political discussion.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Bilbao - Torre Iberdrola 07.JPG|thumb|[[Iberdrola Tower]], headquarters of [[Iberdrola]], in [[Bilbao]].]]\nIndustrial activities were historically centred on steel and shipbuilding, mainly due to the rich [[iron ore]] resources found during the 19th century around Bilbao. The Estuary of Bilbao was the centre of Euskadi's [[industrial revolution]] during the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. These activities decayed during the [[economic crisis]] of the 1970s and 1980s, giving ground for the development of the [[Tertiary sector|services sector]] and new technologies. Today, the strongest industrial sectors of the Basque Country's economy are [[machine tool]], present in the valleys of Biscay and Gipuzkoa; [[aeronautics]] in Vitoria-Gasteiz; and [[energy]], in Bilbao.\n\n[[File:Edinburgh tram, 5 August 2014 (1).jpg|thumb|[[Edinburgh]] tram car assembled in [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]] [[Beasain]] (Gipuzkoa)]]\n\nThe main companies in the Basque Country are: [[BBVA]] bank, [[Iberdrola]] energy company (both of them have their headquarters in Bilbao), [[Mondrag\u00f3n Cooperative Corporation]]&mdash;MCC, the largest cooperative in the world&mdash;[[Gamesa Corporaci\u00f3n Tecnol\u00f3gica|Gamesa]] [[wind turbine]] producer and [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]] [[rolling stock]] producer. MCC's business leadership in the Basque Country hangs in the balance after [[Fagor]], its flagship cooperative of household appliances and goods manufacturing, declared bankruptcy in 2014.

Basque officials have strongly advocated for participation, along with Navarre, in the [[Ecofin]], with a full membership, in order to defend Basque interests in line with Basque reality and fiscal status, and not as a Spanish subsidiary.\n\n===Transport===\n[[Image:Puente Txonta.jpg|thumb|AP-8 in [[Eibar]]]]\nThe strategic geographical location of the Basque Country as a link between the northwest and centre of Spain and the rest of Europe makes this territory heavily transited.\n\n====Road====\nThe main backbones of road transport are the [[Autopista AP-8|AP-8 motorway]] which links Bilbao, San Sebasti\u00e1n and the French border and the [[Autov\u00eda A-1|A-1 motorway]] which links San Sebasti\u00e1n and Vitoria-Gasteiz with central Spain. Other important routes include the [[Autopista AP-68|AP-68 motorway]] which links Bilbao with the Mediterranean.\n\n====Rail====\n[[Eusko Trenbide Sarea]] (''Basque Railway Network'') is the Basque Government-owned company that maintains and creates the railway infrastructure in the autonomous region. [[EuskoTren]] (''Basque Train'') is the Basque Government-owned [[narrow gauge]] rail company that operates commuter services in Bilbao and San Sebasti\u00e1n, intercity Bilbao-San Sebasti\u00e1n service, and [[EuskoTran]] tram services in Bilbao and Vitoria-Gasteiz.\n\n[[Metro Bilbao]] operates two [[rapid transit|metro]] lines that serve the Greater Bilbao area while EuskoTren operates a third which opened in 2017. EuskoTren operates a metro service in the San Sebasti\u00e1n area, known as [[Metro Donostialdea]].\n\nThe Spanish government owns two main [[RENFE]] [[Iberian-gauge railways|broad gauge]] lines that link Vitoria-Gasteiz with San Sebasti\u00e1n and Bilbao with central Spain. It also operates [[Cercan\u00edas]] commuter lines in both Bilbao and San Sebasti\u00e1n.\n[[Image:Euskal Y.PNG|thumb|The Basque Y]]\nThe [[FEVE]] narrow gauge rail company operates a commuter line between Bilbao and [[Balmaseda]] and links Bilbao with the rest of northern Spain.\n\nA new [[high-speed rail|high-speed]] network (called [[Basque Y]]) currently under construction will link the three capitals in 'Y' formation. Because of the rough geography of the territory, most of the network will run through tunnels, with a total estimated cost of up to \u20ac10 billion.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe estimated ecological impact of the project has encouraged the formation of a group campaigning against it called ''AHTrik Ez Elkarlana''. The group uses social disobedience to oppose the project and promotes referendums against it in the towns it most affects. In spite of the vocal opposition to the project by this and other community groups (as well as [[EH Bildu]]), work continues, not without uncertainty. In early 2015, an estimate suggested that the average Basque intercity fare would rise to a non-competitive 25 \u20ac, while the Spanish central government's funding has been subject to continuous delays, spurring the irritation of the Basque government in Vitoria-Gasteiz.\n\n====Airports====\n[[Image:Aeropuerto Bilbao Loiu 01.jpg|thumb|Bilbao Airport]]\nThe three capitals have airports:\n*[[Bilbao Airport]] (BIO) International\n*[[Vitoria Airport]] (VIT)\n*[[San Sebasti\u00e1n Airport]] (EAS)\nOf the three, the most important hub and entry point to the Basque Country is Bilbao Airport, offering many international connections.

The first Spanish restaurant to be awarded 3 stars in the Michelin Guide was, in fact, ''Zalaca\u00edn'', a Basque restaurant, although located in Madrid. Today, the Basque Country, alongside Catalonia, is the Spanish region with a higher density of stars in the Michelin Guide, and it has become a preferred destination of many gastronomic tourists, both domestic and international. Four restaurants boast 3 stars, the highest possible award: Juan Mar\u00eda Arzak (''Arzak'' restaurant), [[Mart\u00edn Berasategui]] (''Berasategui'' restaurant), Pedro Subijana (chef of ''Akelarre'') and [[Eneko Atxa]] (''Azurmendi'' restaurant). In the new generation of chefs, [[Andoni Luis Aduriz]], ''Mugaritz'' restaurant, is outstanding.\n\nThe coastal city of [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] is home to the [[Basque Culinary Center]], an academic research institution focused on higher education and research in the areas of gastronomy and nutrition.\n\nBasque food is one of the reasons for [[tourism in the Basque Country|tourism to the Basque Country]], especially the ''pintxos''. A popular way to socialise is \"''ir de pintxos''\" or ''txikiteo'', a Basque version of a [[pub crawl]], albeit generally more civilised.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Sara JaI Alai Lapurdi.JPG|thumb|[[Basque pelota|Pelota]] ([[jai alai]]) court in Sara, Lapurdi ]]\n[[Basque rural sports]], known as ''Herri Kirolak'' in [[Basque language|Basque]], are a number of sports competitions rooted in the traditional lifestyles of the [[Basque people]], for example [[Basque pelota]], the Basque version of the European game family that includes [[real tennis]] and [[squash (sport)|squash]]. Basque players, playing for either the Spanish or the French teams, dominate international competitions.\n\nThe Basque country is also home to former national football [[List of Spanish football champions|champions]] [[Athletic Bilbao|Athletic Club]] from Bilbao. It has a strict ''[[Cantera]]'' policy of [[Athletic Bilbao signing policy|employing only players born or trained]] in the [[Basque Country (greater region)]]. Athletic's policy does not apply to head coaches, with famous names as [[Howard Kendall]] and [[Jupp Heynckes]] coaching the team at various points. In spite of this, the club shares with worldwide heavyweights [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[FC Barcelona]] the distinction of never being relegated from the top flight.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/athletic-bilbao-how-a-proud-basque-team-is-resisting-globalization-a-546860.html|title=Athletic Bilbao: How a proud Basque team is resisting globalization|first=Walter|last=Mayr|publisher=Der Spiegel|date=11 April 2008|accessdate=19 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nAnother major Basque Country club is [[Real Sociedad]] from San Sebasti\u00e1n, who contest the [[Basque derby]] with Athletic. Real Sociedad used to practise the same policy, until they signed Irish [[Striker (football)|striker]] [[John Aldridge]] in the late 1980s. Since then, Real Sociedad have had many foreign players. [[Xabi Alonso]] became the only Basque player to win both the World Cup and the club [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] and he played in the [[Real Sociedad]].  The region is also home to other [[La Liga]] clubs [[SD Eibar]] and [[Deportivo Alav\u00e9s]].\n\nThe most renowned Basque footballer of all time is possibly [[Andoni Zubizarreta]] who holds the record for appearances in [[La Liga]] with 622 games and has won six league titles and the [[European Cup]]. Nowadays, the best known Basque football player is Xabi Alonso, winner of two UEFA European Championships and one [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], who played for Real Sociedad, Liverpool, Real Madrid and [[Bayern Munich]], but retired in 2017. Other notable Basque players include [[Mikel Arteta]], [[Asier Illarramendi]], [[Andoni Iraola]], [[Aritz Aduriz]], [[Xabi Prieto]] and [[Ander Herrera]]. Both Athletic and Real Sociedad have won the Spanish league, including dominating the competition in the early 1980s, with the last title won by a Basque club being Athletic's [[1983\u201384 La Liga|1984 title]].\n\nAt international level, Basque players were especially prominent in [[Spain national football team|Spanish selections]] prior to the Civil War, with all of those at the [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team squads#Spain|1928 Olympics]], and the majority of the [[Football at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team squads#Spain|1920 Olympics]] and [[1934 FIFA World Cup squads#Spain|1934 World Cup]] squads, born in the region. There is an [[Basque Country national football team|unofficial 'national' team]] which plays occasional friendlies, however its squads pick players from the wider territory including Navarre and the French Basque Country.\n \nCycling as a sport is popular in the Basque Country. [[Abraham Olano]] has won the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] and the [[UCI Road World Championships|World Championship]]. The [[UCI World Tour]] {{ct|MOV}} hails from the Basque Country.<ref>{{cite news|title=2009 Riders and teams Database - Cyclingnews.com |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/teams/2009/caisse-depargne|accessdate=14 August 2009}}</ref> The Caisse d'\u00c9pargne cycling team traces its history back to the '''Banesto''' team that included [[Miguel Indur\u00e1in]].

The {{ct|EUS}} team was also part of the World Tour until its disbandment in 2014. It was an unofficial Basque national team and was partly funded by the Basque Government. Its riders were either Basque, or at least grown up in the Basque cycling culture, and former members of the team have been strong contenders in the [[Tour de France]] held annually in July and [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] held in September. Team leaders have included riders such as [[Iban Mayo]], [[Haimar Zubeldia]], [[Samuel S\u00e1nchez]], [[David Etxebarria]], [[Igor Ant\u00f3n]], [[Mikel Landa]] and [[Mikel Nieve]].\n\n==Notable people==\nSome notable Basque people from this administrative jurisdiction include [[Francisco de Vitoria]], philosopher who set the theories of just war, international law and freedom of commerce; [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano]], completed first circumnavigation of the Earth; [[Ignatius of Loyola]], founder of the Jesuits; [[Don Juan de O\u00f1ate]], explorer of the great plains and Colorado river; [[Blas de Lezo]], naval strategist, best remembered for his defensive tactics at the [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias]]; [[Jorge Oteiza]] sculptor; [[Paco Rabanne]], fashion designer; [[Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga]], fashion designer; [[Xabi Alonso]] and [[Mikel Arteta]], footballers; [[Edurne Pasaban]], first woman to climb all of the fourteen eight-thousand-metre peaks in the world; [[Elena Arzak]], best female chef in the world (2012); [[Jon Kortajarena]] male model; [[Jose-Maria Cundin]], artist; [[Fernando Savater]] philosopher; [[Miguel de Unamuno]], essayist, novelist, poet, playwright, philosopher.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spain}}\n* [[Basque Country (greater region)]]\n* [[Basque mythology]]\n* [[Basque breeds and cultivars]]\n* [[Livestock in the Basque Country]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n* Pierson, Peter (1999).

The OWP referred to the violence as a \"revolution\" against the Polish state, which it saw as a protector of Jews. It was banned in 1934 for anti-state and racist activities.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=9}}\n\n[[File:Jewish children and their teacher, Jedwabne, 1938.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Jewish children with their schoolteachers, [[Jedwabne]], 1938]]\n\nAccording to [[Anna Bikont]], Poland's government at this time was hostile to the Polish nationalist movement, because of the latter's attacks on Jews as well as its opposition to the Polish state; the government felt responsible for Jews and tried to protect them.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=31}} Prewar Polish-Jewish relations in the town were relatively good. At their most tense, when a Jewish woman was killed in Jedwabne and a Polish peasant in another town was killed a few days later, a rumor began that the Jedwabne Jews had taken revenge.

Karolak established a local police force, whose members included Eugeniusz Kalinowsk and Jerzy Laudanski. According to the ''[[Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933\u20131945]]'', the town council included Eugeniusz Sliwecki, J\u00f3zef Sobutka, and J\u00f3zef Wasilewski. Karol Bardon, a translator for the Germans, may also have been a member.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=900}}\n\nThere is general agreement that German police were seen in Jedwabne on the morning of 10 July 1941, or the day before, and met with the town council.{{sfn|Persak|2011|pp=412\u2013413}} Szmuel Wasersztajn's witness statement in 1945 said that eight Gestapo men arrived on 10 July and met with the town authorities.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=18}} Another witness said four or five Gestapo men arrived and \"they began to talk in the town hall\". \"Gestapo man\" was used to refer to any German in a black uniform, Persak writes. The witnesses said they believed the meeting had been held to discuss murdering the town's Jews.{{efn|Krzysztof Persak (2011): \"The direct perpetrators of those crimes was a sizeable group of residents of Jedwabne and neighboring villages. Those involved in the pogrom took different roles: some killed the victims with their own hands, others supervised the Jews assembled in the market square and escorted them to the execution site in the barn, while some robbed Jewish homes or simply formed a hostile crowd of onlookers. The witnesses were fairly unanimous in assigning the role of pogrom organizers to members of the temporary municipal authorities, with Mayor Karolak at the head. Probably a significant part of the massacre was performed by members of the order service subordinated to them, of which, however, we know very little.{{pb}}\"Far less clear is the role played in Jedwabne by representatives of the German occupation authorities. Undoubtedly, they fully approved and possibly inspired the murder. According to testimony of the then-messenger at the gendarmerie post, Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski, before the pogrom 'four or five Gestapo men had arrived in a cab, and they began to talk in the town hall.' In colloquial Polish, a 'cab' (''taks\u00f3wka'') denoted a motor car, and 'Gestapo man' referred to any German in a black uniform. This reference, no doubt, relates to the meeting of the temporary municipal authorities with\u2014probably\u2014functionaries of the German Security Police or Security Service (''Sicherheitspolizei'' or ''Sicherheitsdienst''), mentioned by other witnesses as well. Although accounts regarding that issue are all secondhand, their common denominator is that during that 'conference' the decision to murder the Jedwabne Jews was taken.\"{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=412}}}}\n\nThe IPN found that some Jews had been alerted by non-Jewish acquaintances the evening before that \"a collective action was being prepared against the Jews\".{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} Gross writes that a leading role in the pogrom was carried out by four men, including Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski and Karol Bardo\u0144, who had earlier collaborated with the Soviet [[NKVD]] and were now trying to recast themselves as zealous collaborators with the Germans.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=75}} He also writes that no \"sustained organized activity\" could have taken place in the town without the Germans' consent.{{sfn|Gross|2001|pp=46\u201347}} Several witnesses reported seeing German photographers take pictures of the massacre. There was also speculation that the pogrom was filmed.{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} Polish historian Krzysztof Persak writes that the area around [[\u0141om\u017ca]] and western [[Bia\u0142ystok]] was one of the few Polish majority areas that had just undergone the cruelty of Soviet occupation since 1939. They therefore saw Germans as liberators when they arrived in 1941; paired with historical antisemitism, the conditions were right for German incitement.{{sfn|Persak|2011}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<!--primary sources: Several Jewish eyewitnesses reported that the Germans were directly involved in rounding up and abusing Jews in the town square, and that they shot at Jews who tried to escape from the burning barn.

The OWP referred to the violence as a \"revolution\" against the Polish state, which it saw as a protector of Jews. It was banned in 1934 for anti-state and racist activities.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=9}}\n\n[[File:Jewish children and their teacher, Jedwabne, 1938.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Jewish children with their schoolteachers, [[Jedwabne]], 1938]]\n\nAccording to [[Anna Bikont]], Poland's government at this time was hostile to the Polish nationalist movement, because of the latter's attacks on Jews as well as its opposition to the Polish state; the government felt responsible for Jews and tried to protect them.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=31}} Prewar Polish-Jewish relations in the town were relatively good. At their most tense, when a Jewish woman was killed in Jedwabne and a Polish peasant in another town was killed a few days later, a rumor began that the Jedwabne Jews had taken revenge.

Karolak established a local police force, whose members included Eugeniusz Kalinowsk and Jerzy Laudanski. According to the ''[[Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933\u20131945]]'', the town council included Eugeniusz Sliwecki, J\u00f3zef Sobutka, and J\u00f3zef Wasilewski. Karol Bardon, a translator for the Germans, may also have been a member.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=900}}\n\nThere is general agreement that German police were seen in Jedwabne on the morning of 10 July 1941, or the day before, and met with the town council.{{sfn|Persak|2011|pp=412\u2013413}} Szmuel Wasersztajn's witness statement in 1945 said that eight Gestapo men arrived on 10 July and met with the town authorities.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=18}} Another witness said four or five Gestapo men arrived and \"they began to talk in the town hall\". \"Gestapo man\" was used to refer to any German in a black uniform, Persak writes. The witnesses said they believed the meeting had been held to discuss murdering the town's Jews.{{efn|Krzysztof Persak (2011): \"The direct perpetrators of those crimes was a sizeable group of residents of Jedwabne and neighboring villages. Those involved in the pogrom took different roles: some killed the victims with their own hands, others supervised the Jews assembled in the market square and escorted them to the execution site in the barn, while some robbed Jewish homes or simply formed a hostile crowd of onlookers. The witnesses were fairly unanimous in assigning the role of pogrom organizers to members of the temporary municipal authorities, with Mayor Karolak at the head. Probably a significant part of the massacre was performed by members of the order service subordinated to them, of which, however, we know very little.{{pb}}\"Far less clear is the role played in Jedwabne by representatives of the German occupation authorities. Undoubtedly, they fully approved and possibly inspired the murder. According to testimony of the then-messenger at the gendarmerie post, Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski, before the pogrom 'four or five Gestapo men had arrived in a cab, and they began to talk in the town hall.' In colloquial Polish, a 'cab' (''taks\u00f3wka'') denoted a motor car, and 'Gestapo man' referred to any German in a black uniform. This reference, no doubt, relates to the meeting of the temporary municipal authorities with\u2014probably\u2014functionaries of the German Security Police or Security Service (''Sicherheitspolizei'' or ''Sicherheitsdienst''), mentioned by other witnesses as well. Although accounts regarding that issue are all secondhand, their common denominator is that during that 'conference' the decision to murder the Jedwabne Jews was taken.\"{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=412}}}}\n\nThe IPN found that some Jews had been alerted by non-Jewish acquaintances the evening before that \"a collective action was being prepared against the Jews\".{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} Gross writes that a leading role in the pogrom was carried out by four men, including Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski and Karol Bardo\u0144, who had earlier collaborated with the Soviet [[NKVD]] and were now trying to recast themselves as zealous collaborators with the Germans.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=75}} He also writes that no \"sustained organized activity\" could have taken place in the town without the Germans' consent.{{sfn|Gross|2001|pp=46\u201347}} Several witnesses reported seeing German photographers take pictures of the massacre. There was also speculation that the pogrom was filmed.{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} Polish historian Krzysztof Persak writes that the area around [[\u0141om\u017ca]] and western [[Bia\u0142ystok]] was one of the few Polish majority areas that had just undergone the cruelty of Soviet occupation since 1939. They therefore saw Germans as liberators when they arrived in 1941; paired with historical antisemitism, the conditions were right for German incitement.{{sfn|Persak|2011}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<!--primary sources: Several Jewish eyewitnesses reported that the Germans were directly involved in rounding up and abusing Jews in the town square, and that they shot at Jews who tried to escape from the burning barn.

The first totalisators were introduced about this time. They faced opposition from a curious alliance of bookmakers and anti-gambling factions but were approved by the Clubs and licensed by the Colonial Secretary. The first trotting race on a racecourse in Canterbury, in 1875, before the totalisator was introduced, the stake was only about a \"tenner\" (\u00a310), but the match created a lot of interest. About 1880, Lower Heathcote Racing Club was founded, supporting gallops, but added trotting events to its programme, giving smaller stakes. Some years later the club discontinued gallops and became the Lower Heathcote Trotting Club, which gave stakes ranging from \u00a315 to \u00a335.<ref name=\"addington\" />\n\nThe New South Wales bred, [[Lawn Derby]], racing un-hoppled, was the first pacer to break the two-minute barrier in Australia or New Zealand when he recorded 1:59.4 at the Addington track in New Zealand in 1938.<ref>[http://www.brisbaneracing.com.au/article.php?current_article=2571 Brisbane racing: Did you know these harness racing facts?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015060102/http://brisbaneracing.com.au/article.php?current_article=2571 |date=2009-10-15 }} Retrieved 2010-7-18</ref> \n\nFrom these early stages, the sport has developed with top races and top horses from then right up to the present day.\n\n==Prominent people==\n\n* James Bryce\n* [[Anthony Butt]]\n* [[Cecil Devine]]\n* [[Tony Herlihy]]\n* [[Free Holmes | Freeman Holmes]]\n* [[Maurice Holmes (harness racer) | Maurice Holmes]]\n* [[Charlie Hunter (trainer) | Charlie Hunter]]\n* [[John Langdon (driver) | John Langdon]]\n* Maurice McKendry \n* [[Roy McKenzie | Sir Roy McKenzie]]\n* Ricky May\n* Reon Murtha - long-standing race caller\n* [[Denis Nyhan]]\n* [[Mark Purdon]]\n* Roy Purdon\n* Natalie Rasmussen \n* [[Steven Reid (harness racer)| Steven Reid]]\n* Jack Smolenski\n* [[Doody Townley]]\n* [[Peter Wolfenden]]\n\n==Prominent New Zealand horses==\n\n* [[Auckland Reactor]]\n* [[Caduceus (horse) |Caduceus]]\n* [[Captain Sandy]]\n* [[Cardigan Bay]]\n* [[Chokin]]\n* [[Christian Cullen (horse) |Christian Cullen]]\n* Courage Under Fire\n* [[Delightful Lady]]\n* [[Easton Light]]\n* [[Elsu]]\n* [[False Step]]\n* [[Flashing Red]]\n* [[Harold Logan]]\n* [[Highland Fling (horse) | Highland Fling]]\n* [[Il Vicolo]]\n* [[Im Themightyquinn]]\n* [[Indianapolis (horse)| Indianapolis]]\n* [[Johnny Globe ]]\n* Lazarus\n* [[Lord Module]]\n* [[Lordship (horse) | Lordship]]\n* [[Lyell Creek]]\n* [[Monkey King (horse) | Monkey King]]\n* Noodlum\n* [[Ordeal (horse) | Ordeal]]\n* [[Our Sir Vancelot]]\n* [[Robalan ]]\n* Robin Dundee\n* Roydon Glen\n* [[Smoken Up]]\n* [[Take A Moment]]\n* [[Terror to Love]]\n* [[Young Quinn]]\n\n== Major New Zealand harness races ==\n[[Image:Uncle Petrika (harness racing-trotter).jpg|thumb|200px|right|NZ trotter Uncle Petrika]]\nIn [[New Zealand]] the richest and most important race is the [[New Zealand Trotting Cup]], run for older pacers in November at Addington.

differs from [[North America]]n racing in that [[Metric system|metric]] distances are used. Races are at distances between 1600m and 3200m. \n\nAnother large difference is that in [[New Zealand]] racing the leader does not have to hand up the lead to any horse that challenges, often leaving a horse parked outside the leader in the \"death seat\", \"the death\", or \"facing the breeze\", as this horse covers more ground than the leader.\n\nNew Zealand races may have a field of up to 16 horses, although as numbers of horses have reduced some races will have less than 10 starters.  This generally means that with the smaller tracks a \"three wide train\" starts as the field gets the bell at signal their final lap.\n\nThere is a system of an 'open lane' or 'passing lane' ('sprint lane' in Australia). These lanes do not operate on all tracks and have been a point of argument between many industry participants. \n\nNew Zealand horses are able to easily \"cross the [[Tasman Sea|Tasman]]\" to Australia, as the rules are similar.\n\n== United States and Canada ==\nThe association with trotting in New Zealand and the United States has always been strong, with much of the breeding stock coming from America. Particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, New Zealand horses competed in both Canada and the United States. The first New Zealand horse to be raced in America by a New Zealander was the trotter Vodka, the winner of the 1953 [[Dominion Handicap]]. He was taken there in 1956 by his owner, J. S. Shaw, won 11 races and was later leased to American interests.\n\nIn 1960 [[Caduceus (horse)|Caduceus]] was the first New Zealand pacer to compete in the [[Yonkers Raceway|Yonkers International Series]] with his trainer-driver, J. D. Litten. Despite his nine years, Caduceus showed he was the equal of the top American horses, winning the last race of the series, only to be disqualified. He also was leased to American interests and at 10 years of age was still winning races.\n\n[[False Step]] was driven in the Yonkers International series during the 1960\u201361 season by his trainer [[C C Devine]]. False Step's performances showed he was one of the greatest pacers in the world. He beat the acknowledged American champion, [[Adios Butler]], in a 1\u00bd mile race. He was sold in America for 115,000 dollars, the fifth highest price paid for a pacer in the United States. \n\nArania also entered the series with False Step. She did not do well, but after being leased won several races and proved she was able to race with the best in America, and in fact created a record of 1 min 57 sec for 1 mile in the Lexington Red Mile.<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/R/RacingTrotting/NewZealandHorsesInAmerica/en New Zealand Horses in America]</ref>\n\nIn 1964, [[Cardigan Bay (horse)|Cardigan Bay]] was to travel to America with reinsman [[Stanley Dancer]], who paid 100,000 dollars for the horse. Cardigan Bay was already an established racehorse in New Zealand, having won the 1963 [[New Zealand Trotting Cup]] and other top races in Australia and New Zealand. He went on to win over a million dollars in the United States, the first harness horse ever to do so.\n\n\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Harness racing]]\n*[[Harness racing in Australia]]\n*[[Horse racing]]\n*[[Glossary of Australian and New Zealand punting]]\n*[[Thoroughbred racing in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons cat|Harness racing in New Zealand}}\n*[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/racing-trotting/1 ''Racing, Trotting'', from An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]\n\n{{Oceania topic|Harness racing in}}\n{{Sport in New Zealand}}\n\n[[Category:Harness racing in New Zealand|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|equestrian sport}}\n'''Harness racing in New Zealand''' is more often called '''trotting''' in the \"old school\"  rather than the more fashionable name of \"harness racing\".<ref>[http://www.addington.co.nz/Timeline.asp?Case=6&ItemId=6&AlphaId=4&CategoryId=3 Trotting in New Zealand with reinsman C C Devine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018073231/http://www.addington.co.nz/Timeline.asp?Case=6&ItemId=6&AlphaId=4&CategoryId=3 |date=2008-10-18 }}</ref> The sport is long standing with events being held as early as 1864.

The first totalisators were introduced about this time. They faced opposition from a curious alliance of bookmakers and anti-gambling factions but were approved by the Clubs and licensed by the Colonial Secretary. The first trotting race on a racecourse in Canterbury, in 1875, before the totalisator was introduced, the stake was only about a \"tenner\" (\u00a310), but the match created a lot of interest. About 1880, Lower Heathcote Racing Club was founded, supporting gallops, but added trotting events to its programme, giving smaller stakes. Some years later the club discontinued gallops and became the Lower Heathcote Trotting Club, which gave stakes ranging from \u00a315 to \u00a335.<ref name=\"addington\" />\n\nThe New South Wales bred, [[Lawn Derby]], racing un-hoppled, was the first pacer to break the two-minute barrier in Australia or New Zealand when he recorded 1:59.4 at the Addington track in New Zealand in 1938.<ref>[http://www.brisbaneracing.com.au/article.php?current_article=2571 Brisbane racing: Did you know these harness racing facts?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015060102/http://brisbaneracing.com.au/article.php?current_article=2571 |date=2009-10-15 }} Retrieved 2010-7-18</ref> \n\nFrom these early stages, the sport has developed with top races and top horses from then right up to the present day.\n\n==Prominent people==\n\n* James Bryce\n* [[Anthony Butt]]\n* [[Cecil Devine]]\n* [[Tony Herlihy]]\n* [[Free Holmes | Freeman Holmes]]\n* [[Maurice Holmes (harness racer) | Maurice Holmes]]\n* [[Charlie Hunter (trainer) | Charlie Hunter]]\n* [[John Langdon (driver) | John Langdon]]\n* Maurice McKendry \n* [[Roy McKenzie]]\n* Ricky May\n* Reon Murtha - long-standing race caller\n* [[Denis Nyhan]]\n* [[Mark Purdon]]\n* Roy Purdon\n* Natalie Rasmussen \n* [[Steven Reid (harness racer)| Steven Reid]]\n* Jack Smolenski\n* [[Doody Townley]]\n* [[Peter Wolfenden]]\n\n==Prominent New Zealand horses==\n\n* [[Auckland Reactor]]\n* [[Caduceus (horse) |Caduceus]]\n* [[Captain Sandy]]\n* [[Cardigan Bay]]\n* [[Chokin]]\n* [[Christian Cullen (horse) |Christian Cullen]]\n* Courage Under Fire\n* [[Delightful Lady]]\n* [[Easton Light]]\n* [[Elsu]]\n* [[False Step]]\n* [[Flashing Red]]\n* [[Harold Logan]]\n* [[Highland Fling (horse) | Highland Fling]]\n* [[Il Vicolo]]\n* [[Im Themightyquinn]]\n* [[Indianapolis (horse)| Indianapolis]]\n* [[Johnny Globe ]]\n* Lazarus\n* [[Lord Module]]\n* [[Lordship (horse) | Lordship]]\n* [[Lyell Creek]]\n* [[Monkey King (horse) | Monkey King]]\n* Noodlum\n* [[Ordeal (horse) | Ordeal]]\n* [[Our Sir Vancelot]]\n* [[Robalan ]]\n* Robin Dundee\n* Roydon Glen\n* [[Smoken Up]]\n* [[Take A Moment]]\n* [[Terror to Love]]\n* [[Young Quinn]]\n\n== Major New Zealand harness races ==\n[[Image:Uncle Petrika (harness racing-trotter).jpg|thumb|200px|right|NZ trotter Uncle Petrika]]\nIn [[New Zealand]] the richest and most important race is the [[New Zealand Trotting Cup]], run for older pacers in November at Addington.

There are also the [[New Zealand Derby (harness)|New Zealand Derby]] and the [[Great Northern Derby (harness)|Great Northern Derby]] for three-year-olds, and the [[Dominion Handicap]] and [[Rowe Cup]] for trotters.

differs from [[North America]]n racing in that [[Metric system|metric]] distances are used. Races are at distances between 1600m and 3200m. \n\nAnother large difference is that in [[New Zealand]] racing the leader does not have to hand up the lead to any horse that challenges, often leaving a horse parked outside the leader in the \"death seat\", \"the death\", or \"facing the breeze\", as this horse covers more ground than the leader.\n\nNew Zealand races may have a field of up to 16 horses, although as numbers of horses have reduced some races will have less than 10 starters.  This generally means that with the smaller tracks a \"three wide train\" starts as the field gets the bell at signal their final lap.\n\nThere is a system of an 'open lane' or 'passing lane' ('sprint lane' in Australia). These lanes do not operate on all tracks and have been a point of argument between many industry participants. \n\nNew Zealand horses are able to easily \"cross the [[Tasman Sea|Tasman]]\" to Australia, as the rules are similar.\n\n== United States and Canada ==\nThe association with trotting in New Zealand and the United States has always been strong, with much of the breeding stock coming from America. Particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, New Zealand horses competed in both Canada and the United States. The first New Zealand horse to be raced in America by a New Zealander was the trotter Vodka, the winner of the 1953 [[Dominion Handicap]]. He was taken there in 1956 by his owner, J. S. Shaw, won 11 races and was later leased to American interests.\n\nIn 1960 [[Caduceus (horse)|Caduceus]] was the first New Zealand pacer to compete in the [[Yonkers Raceway|Yonkers International Series]] with his trainer-driver, J. D. Litten. Despite his nine years, Caduceus showed he was the equal of the top American horses, winning the last race of the series, only to be disqualified. He also was leased to American interests and at 10 years of age was still winning races.\n\n[[False Step]] was driven in the Yonkers International series during the 1960\u201361 season by his trainer [[C C Devine]]. False Step's performances showed he was one of the greatest pacers in the world. He beat the acknowledged American champion, [[Adios Butler]], in a 1\u00bd mile race. He was sold in America for 115,000 dollars, the fifth highest price paid for a pacer in the United States. \n\nArania also entered the series with False Step. She did not do well, but after being leased won several races and proved she was able to race with the best in America, and in fact created a record of 1 min 57 sec for 1 mile in the Lexington Red Mile.<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/R/RacingTrotting/NewZealandHorsesInAmerica/en New Zealand Horses in America]</ref>\n\nIn 1964, [[Cardigan Bay (horse)|Cardigan Bay]] was to travel to America with reinsman [[Stanley Dancer]], who paid 100,000 dollars for the horse. Cardigan Bay was already an established racehorse in New Zealand, having won the 1963 [[New Zealand Trotting Cup]] and other top races in Australia and New Zealand. He went on to win over a million dollars in the United States, the first harness horse ever to do so.\n\n\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Harness racing]]\n*[[Harness racing in Australia]]\n*[[Horse racing]]\n*[[Glossary of Australian and New Zealand punting]]\n*[[Thoroughbred racing in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons cat|Harness racing in New Zealand}}\n*[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/racing-trotting/1 ''Racing, Trotting'', from An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]\n\n{{Oceania topic|Harness racing in}}\n{{Sport in New Zealand}}\n\n[[Category:Harness racing in New Zealand|*]]\n", "name_user": "ToddyOC", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eProminent people", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harness_racing_in_New_Zealand"}

Among his roles in this vein was ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1946).\n\nFans of ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' remember him well, as he appeared in eight episodes, always as a different character and yet really the ''same'' character, in a way. His best-known ''Superman'' episode might be \"Flight to the North\", in which he tries (and fails) to outwit a country-bumpkin type (played by [[Chuck Connors]]). In 1966, he acted in episodes 47 and 48 of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' featuring [[Vincent Price]] as Special Guest Villain \"Egghead\".  He also played a supporting role in the Three Stooges short, \"Three Dark Horses.\" (1952)\n\nHe appeared in six episodes of ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'' (\"Two Gold Lockets\", 1951, \"Delayed Action\", 1952,  \"Right to Vote\", 1953, \"Stage to Tishomingo\", 1954, \"Trouble at Tylerville\", 1956, & \"Outlaws in Greasepaint\", 1957). In his later years, Welden owned a confection company called Nutcorn, which supplemented his acting income.\n\n==Death==\nWelden died at age 96 on October 17, 1997, at the [[Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital]] in Woodland Hills, California.<ref name=lat/> He was survived by a sister.<ref name=\"v\">{{cite news|title=Ben Welden|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/people-news/ben-welden-111660779/|accessdate=August 27,  2017|work=Variety|date=November 4, 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827194148/http://variety.com/1997/scene/people-news/ben-welden-111660779/|archivedate=August 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{{div col}}\n* ''The Man from Chicago'' (1930) - Ted (film debut)\n* ''[[Big Business (1930 film)|Big Business]]'' (1930) - Fenchurch\n* ''[[77 Park Lane]]'' (1931) - Sinclair\n* ''[[The Missing Rembrandt]]'' (1932) - Pinkerton Agent (uncredited)\n* ''[[The Innocents of Chicago]]'' (1932) - Spike Guinan\n* ''[[Tin Gods (1932 film)|Tin Gods]]'' (1932) - Cyrus P.

Among his roles in this vein was ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1946).\n\nFans of ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' remember him well, as he appeared in eight episodes, always as a different character and yet really the ''same'' character, in a way. His best-known ''Superman'' episode might be \"Flight to the North\", in which he tries (and fails) to outwit a country-bumpkin type (played by [[Chuck Connors]]). In 1966, he acted in episodes 47 and 48 of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' featuring [[Vincent Price]] as Special Guest Villain \"Egghead\".  He also played a supporting role in the Three Stooges short, \"Three Dark Horses.\" (1952)\n\nHe appeared in six episodes of ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'' (\"Two Gold Lockets\", 1951, \"Delayed Action\", 1952,  \"Right to Vote\", 1953, \"Stage to Tishomingo\", 1954, \"Trouble at Tylerville\", 1956, & \"Outlaws in Greasepaint\", 1957). In his later years, Welden owned a confection company called Nutcorn, which supplemented his acting income.\n\n==Death==\nWelden died at age 96 on October 17, 1997, at the [[Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital]] in Woodland Hills, California.<ref name=lat/> He was survived by a sister.<ref name=\"v\">{{cite news|title=Ben Welden|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/people-news/ben-welden-111660779/|accessdate=August 27,  2017|work=Variety|date=November 4, 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827194148/http://variety.com/1997/scene/people-news/ben-welden-111660779/|archivedate=August 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{{div col}}\n* ''The Man from Chicago'' (1930) - Ted (film debut)\n* ''[[Big Business (1930 film)|Big Business]]'' (1930) - Fenchurch\n* ''[[77 Park Lane]]'' (1931) - Sinclair\n* ''[[The Missing Rembrandt]]'' (1932) - Pinkerton Agent (uncredited)\n* ''[[The Innocents of Chicago]]'' (1932) - Spike Guinan\n* ''[[Tin Gods (1932 film)|Tin Gods]]'' (1932) - Cyrus P.

The decision to declare war was made by [[Adolf Hitler]], apparently offhand, almost without consultation. Publicly, the formal declaration was made to American ''Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires'' [[Leland B. Morris]] by German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] in the latter's office. Later that day, the [[United States declaration of war upon Germany (1941)|U.S. declared war on Germany]].\n\nWidely considered a major error in the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[dictatorship]]'s strategic actions during the war, the Nazi hierarchy held low regard for the military resolve of the U.S. under [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Through the eyes of the [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[ideology]] practiced by Hitler and other senior Nazis, the U.S. constituted a [[Corruption|corrupt]], [[Decadence|decadent]], and fundamentally weak nation given factors such as the large population of [[African-Americans]], [[immigrants]] and [[Jewish-Americans]] as well as the free-for-all nature of U.S. [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] [[democracy]].\n\n== Background ==\n{{see also|Consequences of the attack on Pearl Harbor}}\nThe course of relations between Germany and the United States had deteriorated since the beginning of World War II, inevitably so given the increasing cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom. The [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], [[Lend-Lease]], the [[Atlantic Charter]], the [[Occupation of Iceland#United States occupation|hand-over of military control of Iceland from the United Kingdom to the United States]], the extension of the [[Pan-American Security Zone]], and many other results of the [[Special Relationship|special relationship]] which had developed between the two countries had put a strain on relations between the US, still technically a neutral country, and [[Nazi Germany]]. US destroyers escorting American supply vessels bound for the UK were already engaged in a ''de facto'' war with German [[U-Boats]].<ref name=bullock>[[Alan Bullock|Bullock, Alan]] (1992) ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]''.  New York: Knopf. pp.766-67 {{ISBN|0-394-58601-8}}</ref> Roosevelt's desire to help the UK, despite the objections of the influential US [[isolationism|isolationist]] lobby, and [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|legal impediments]] imposed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] which prevented direct involvement in the war, brought the US to push hard against the traditional boundaries of [[Neutral country|neutrality]].\n\nOn 7 December 1941, the Empire of Japan launched an [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on the US naval and army base on Pearl Harbor]] in [[Hawaii]], beginning a war between Japan and the United States. Japan had not informed its ally, Germany, in advance of the attack, although the Japanese ambassador had informed the German Foreign Minister, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], at the beginning of December that relations between the US and the Japanese Empire were at a breaking point, and that war was imminent.  He was instructed to ask Germany for commitment to declare war under the terms of the [[Tripartite Pact]] should that occur.  Hitler and Ribbentrop had been urging Japan to attack and take over [[Singapore]] from the British, on the theory that doing so would not only hurt the UK, but would also serve to help keep the US out of the war.<ref name=bullock661>[[Alan Bullock|Bullock, Alan]] (1962) ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]'' London: Penguin. pp.661-64. {{ISBN|0-14-013564-2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B06275A, Berlin, Reichstagssitzung, Rede Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|right|235px|Closeup of Hitler as war is declared upon the United States, 11 December 1941]]\nAccording to the terms of their agreements, Germany was obliged to come to the aid of Japan if a third country attacked Japan, but not if Japan attacked a third country. Ribbentrop reminded Hitler of this, and pointed out that to declare war against the US would add to the number of enemies Germany was fighting, but Hitler dismissed this concern as not being important,<ref name=bullock661 /> and, almost entirely without consultation, chose to declare war against the US, wanting to do so before, he thought, Roosevelt would declare war on Germany.<ref>Kershaw (2007), pp.444-446</ref><ref name=fest655 /><ref name=burleigh731 />\n\nIn fact, Hitler's declaration of war came as a great relief to British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], who feared the possibility of two parallel but disconnected wars &ndash; the UK and Soviet Union versus Germany in Europe, and the US and the British Empire versus Japan in the Far East and the Pacific. With Nazi Germany's declaration against the United States in effect, American assistance for Britain in both theaters of war as a full ally was assured.  It also simplified matters for the American government, as [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] recalled:\n\n<blockquote>When Pearl Harbor happened, we [Roosevelt's advisors] were desperate. ... We were all in agony.  The mood of the American people was obvious &ndash; they were determined that the Japanese had to be punished.  We could have been forced to concentrate all our efforts on the Pacific, unable from then on to give more than purely peripheral help to Britain. It was truly astounding when Hitler declared war on us three days later. I cannot tell you our feelings of triumph.  It was a totally irrational thing for him to do, and I think it saved Europe.\"<ref>[[John Kenneth Galbraith|Galbraith, John Kenneth]], interviewed by [[Gitta Sereny]] (1995) ''Albert Speer: His Battle with the Truth'' New York, Knopf. p.267-8. {{ISBN|0-394-52915-4}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHitler's reasons for declaring war against the US when he was not obligated to were numerous. One was an emotional response: the Japanese tactic of using a surprise attack without making a declaration of war appealed to him &ndash; he had done the same thing when he attacked the [[Soviet Union]] with [[Operation Barbarossa]] in June 1941; indeed, he told the Japanese ambassador \"[O]ne should strike &ndash; as hard as possible &ndash; and not waste time declaring war.\"<ref name=bullock661 />  Also, the prospect of a worldwide war fed Hitler's tendency towards grandiose thinking, and reinforced his feeling that he was a world-historical figure of destiny.  As he said in his declaration speech to the Reichstag:\n\n<blockquote>I can only be grateful to Providence that it entrusted me with the leadership in this historic struggle which, for the next five hundred or a thousand years, will be described as decisive, not only for the history of Germany, but for the whole of Europe and indeed the whole world.<ref name=bullock661 /></blockquote>\n\nHitler's lack of knowledge about the US and its industrial and demographic capacity for mounting a war on two fronts also entered into his decision.<ref name=bullock661 /> As early as mid-March 1941 &ndash; nine months before the Japanese attack &ndash; President Roosevelt was acutely aware of Hitler's hostility towards the United States, and [[New Order (Nazism)#Hitler's plans for North America|the destructive potential it presented]]. Due to this attitude within the [[White House]], and the rapidly progressing efforts of the Americans' industrial capacity before and through 1941 to start providing its armed forces with the ordnance, combat aircraft and ships that would be required to defeat the Axis as a whole, the US was already well on its way towards the full-scale wartime economy which would make it the [[Arsenal of Democracy|\"arsenal of democracy\"]] for itself and its allies.\n\nFinally, Hitler's deeply-held racial prejudices made him see the US as a decadent bourgeois democracy filled with people of mixed race, a population heavily under the influence of Jews and \"Negroes\", with no history of authoritarian discipline to control and direct them, interested only in luxury and living the \"good life\" while dancing, drinking and enjoying \"negrofied\" music.  Such a country, in Hitler's mind, would never be willing to make the economic and human sacrifices necessary to threaten National Socialist Germany<ref name=bullock661 /> \u2014 and thus set the stage for a dangerously inaccurate view of the very nation that Hitler had stated in his unpublished ''[[Zweites Buch]]'' (''Second Book'', 1928) would be the Third Reich's most serious challenge beyond his intended defeat of the Soviet Union.<ref>Hillgruber (1981), pp.50-51</ref>\n\nThe economic potential and racial composition of America had implications for Hitler's own ideological construct, indeed, how he saw Germany's current problems and future hopes. His central ideas of [[Lebensraum|'living space']] and race held the key to his image of the United States. To Hitler the United States was a country with a white 'Nordic' racial core, to which he attributed its economic success and standard of living, and in which he saw a model for his vision of German 'living space' in Europe.<ref>As late as 24 February 1945, Hitler spoke of the 'vast territory' of the United States in America, 'ample to absorb the energies of all their people', as the model which he hoped to emulate for Germany in Europe, 'to ensure for her complete economic independence inside a territory of a size compatible with her population', adding that 'a great people has need of broad acres' Genoud, Francois (ed.)

Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s signing of the declaration of war against Germany, the response of the United States to Hitler's declaration]]\n\nThe one advantage which the declaration of war against the US provided for Hitler was as a propaganda diversion for the German public, to distract them from the state of the war against the Soviet Union, in which Germany had suffered severe setbacks and an unexpectedly prolonged engagement.  Hitler had assured the German people that the Soviet Union would be crushed well before the onset of winter, but that, in fact, did not happen, and there was little in the way of good news. The timing of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor enabled Hitler to angle his planned speech to the Reichstag in a more positive fashion, squeezing as much propaganda value out of it as possible.  Hitler, in fact, put off the speech &ndash; and the declaration of war &ndash; for several days, trying to arrive at the proper psychological moment to make the announcement.<ref>Kershaw (2000), pp.444-45</ref>  Still, the propaganda motive was hardly sufficient to justify declaring war on the US, especially considering that doing so would create an otherwise \"unnatural alliance\" between two disparate and heretofore antagonistic polities, the United States and the Soviet Union.  [[Joachim C. Fest]], one of Hitler's biographers, has argued that Hitler's decision was \"really no longer an act of his own volition, but a gesture governed by a sudden awareness of his own impotence. That gesture was Hitler's last strategic initiative of any importance.\"<ref name=fest655 />\n\nRegardless of Hitler's reasons for the declaration, the decision is generally seen as an enormous strategic blunder on his part, as it allowed the United States to enter the European war in support of the United Kingdom and the Allies without much public opposition, while still facing the Japanese threat in the Pacific. Hitler had, in fact, committed Germany to fight the US while in the midst of a war of extermination against Russia, and without having first defeated the UK, instead of taking the option of putting off a conflict with the US for as long as possible, forcing it to concentrate on the war in the Pacific against Japan, and making it much more difficult for it to become involved in the European war.  At least to some extent he had held in his hands the power to control the timing of the intervention of the US, and instead, by declaring war against America, he freed Roosevelt and Churchill to act as they saw fit.<ref name=bullock /><ref name=fest655>[[Joachim C.

Quote: \"Hitler's declaration of war on the United States ... was not an objective foreign policy move. ... Rather, it was a gesture designed to conceal the fact that he could no longer control the direction of the war... His admission...on January 3, 1942, that he did 'not yet' know 'how America could be defeated' speaks for itself.\"</ref>\n\nFrom the point of view of Hitler and much of the German political and military elite, declaring war against the U.S. in response to the Pearl Harbor attack was a calculated risk in fighting the U.S. before they were prepared to effectively defend themselves.  By that time, the German leadership believed that the United States was effectively acting as a belligerent in the conflict, given actions such as Lend-Lease of supplies to Britain to sustain their war effort, President Roosevelt's public statements, the deployment of American soldiers and Marines to Iceland, and U.S. Navy escorts of convoys across the Atlantic, which sometimes came into contact with U-boats; these acts, as well as America's previous intervention in [[World War I]], led to the assumption that war between them was inevitable.  As such, the decision was made to use the attack as a rationale for an official declaration of war in order to drive Britain out of the conflict by widening submarine operations and directly attacking U.S. commercial shipping.  While Hitler's declaration of war against the United States eventually led to his downfall, initially it seemed successful in its objective of more effectively cutting Britain's supply lines, as the U.S. military's lack of tactics, equipment, and procedures for fighting U-boats caused 1942 to be the most devastating year of the war for shipping losses;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/what-if-hitler-never-declared-war-the-us-during-world-war-ii-17573 |title=What If Hitler Never Declared War on the U.S. During World War II?|last1=Farley |first1=Robert |date=2 September 2016 |website=National Interest.org |publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref> the war declaration enabled the [[Second Happy Time]] for U-boats.<ref>Duncan Redford and Grove, Philip D. (2014) ''The Royal Navy: A History Since 1900'', Tauris. p.182</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitler's Naval Adjutant, Admiral von Puttkamer, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor actually buoyed Hitler's assurance in winning the war, and improved morale among the high leadership of the armed forces. Peter Padfield writes:\n\n<blockquote>The news [of Pearl Harbor] came as a surprise to Hitler although he knew of their intention to attack somewhere at some time and had made up his mind to support them if they attacked the United States.  Now frivolously disregarding the huge financial and productive power of America and, according to ... von Puttkamer, blind to the realization that this power could be projected across the Atlantic, he gained renewed confidence in a victorious outcome to the war.  His generals suffered from the same land-locked hallucination: his entire headquarters staff gave themselves up to 'an ecstasy of rejoicing'; the few who saw further 'became even lonelier'. Naval officers saw no more clearly than the generals.<ref>Padfield, Peter (1984) ''D\u00f6nitz: The Last Fuhrer: Portrait of a Nazi War Leader'' London: Victor Gollancz. {{ISBN|0-575-03186-7}}. p.235; quoting Warlimont, W. (1964) ''Inside Hitler's Headquarters'' Weidenfeld, p.208</ref></blockquote>\n\n== German declaration ==\nHitler arrived in Berlin on Tuesday 9 December and met with Goebbels at midday, when he disclosed his intention to declare war in a speech to the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]], postponing the declaration for 24 hours to give himself time to prepare.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 221</ref> A further meeting with Goebbels on 10 December finalised the planning, although Hitler had yet to work on his speech. The time selected was 3:00 pm, as it was a convenient time for German radio listeners and the broadcast could be received in Tokyo at 10 pm and in Washington DC at 8:00 am. Ribbentrop telephoned the German ambassador in Rome, asking him to contact Mussolini and ensure that Italy's declaration of war be coordinated with Germany's. Meanwhile, there was considerable diplomatic activity to ensure that the amendments to the Tripartite Pact requested by the Japanese government be concluded; the Germans requested that the Japanese ambassador, [[Hiroshi \u014cshima]], should be empowered to sign the [[Tripartite Pact#\"No separate peace\" agreement|\"No separate peace\" agreement]] on Tokyo's behalf to save time.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 236</ref>\n\nBritain and the United States were already aware of German intentions through [[Magic (cryptography)|Magic]] signals intelligence and on 9 December, Roosevelt gave one of his \"[[fireside chats|fireside chat]]\" national broadcasts in which he said that American people should \"Remember always that Germany and Italy, regardless of any formal declaration of war, consider themselves at war with the United States at this moment just as much as they consider themselves at war with Britain or Russia\".<ref>Mawdsley 2011, pp. 223-225</ref> Churchill spoke in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on the morning of 11 December, saying that; \"Not only the British Empire now but the United States are fighting for life; Russia is fighting for life, and China is fighting for life. Behind these four great combatant communities are ranged all the free spirit and hopes of all the conquered countries in Europe...  It would indeed bring shame upon our generation if we did not teach them a lesson which will not be forgotten in the records of a thousand years\".<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 247</ref>\n\nOn Thursday 11 December 1941, American ''Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires'' [[Leland B.

In his speech of October 27, 1941, he once more expressly affirmed that this order was in force. Acting under this order, vessels of the American Navy, since early September 1941, have systematically attacked German naval forces. Thus, American [[destroyers]], as for instance the [[USS Greer (DD-145)|Greer]], the [[USS Kearny (DD-432)|Kearney]] and the [[USS Reuben James (DD-245)|Reuben James]], have opened fire on German submarines according to plan. The [[Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the American Navy]], Mr. [[Frank Knox|Knox]], himself confirmed that-American destroyers attacked German [[submarines]].\n\nFurthermore, the naval forces of the United States, under order of their Government and contrary to international law have treated and seized German [[Merchant ship|merchant vessels]] on the high seas as enemy ships.\n\nThe German Government therefore establishes the following facts:\n\nAlthough Germany on her part has strictly adhered to the rules of international law in her relations with the United States during every period of the [[World War II|present war]], the Government of the United States from initial violations of neutrality has finally proceeded to open acts of war against Germany. The Government of the United States has thereby virtually created a [[Declaration of war|state of war]].\n\nThe German Government, consequently, discontinues [[diplomatic relations]] with the United States of America and declares that under these circumstances brought about by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] Germany too, as from today, considers herself as being in a state of war with the United States of America.\n\nAccept, Mr. Charge d'Affaires, the expression of my high consideration.\n\nDecember 11, 1941.\n\nRIBBENTROP.<ref>{{cite web|title=German Declaration of War with the United States : December 11, 1941|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/gerdec41.asp|work=The Avalon Project|publisher=Lillian Goldman Law Library|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe same text had been sent to [[Hans Thomsen]], the German ''charg\u00e9 d'affaires'' in Washington, with instructions to present it to [[Cordell Hull]], the [[United States Secretary of State]] at 3:30 pm, German [[summer time]], 8:30 am [[Eastern Standard Time]].<ref>Smyth & Lambert 1964, p. 999</ref> On their arrival however, Hull refused to see the German delegation and it was not until 9:30 that they were able pass their note to [[Ray Atherton]], the head of the Division of European Affairs.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 253</ref> In Berlin, there was consternation that Mussolini had decided to preempt Hitler and declare war in a speech from the balcony at the [[Palazzo Venezia]] at 2:45 pm; an estimated crowd of 100,000 gathered to hear his speech which lasted only four minutes.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, pp. 248-249</ref>\n\nAt 3:00 pm, Hitler addressed the 855 deputies of the Reichstag gathered in the [[Kroll Opera House]], with a speech lasting for 88 minutes in which he listed German successes to date but failed to mention the stalled offensive in Russia.

The [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], [[Lend-Lease]], the [[Atlantic Charter]], the [[Occupation of Iceland#United States occupation|hand-over of military control of Iceland from the United Kingdom to the United States]], the extension of the [[Pan-American Security Zone]], and many other results of the [[Special Relationship|special relationship]] which had developed between the two countries had put a strain on relations between the US, still technically a neutral country, and [[Nazi Germany]]. US destroyers escorting American supply vessels bound for the UK were already engaged in a ''de facto'' war with German [[U-Boats]].<ref name=bullock>[[Alan Bullock|Bullock, Alan]] (1992) ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]''.  New York: Knopf. pp.766-67 {{ISBN|0-394-58601-8}}</ref> Roosevelt's desire to help the UK, despite the objections of the influential US [[isolationism|isolationist]] lobby, and [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|legal impediments]] imposed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] which prevented direct involvement in the war, brought the US to push hard against the traditional boundaries of [[Neutral country|neutrality]].\n\nOn 7 December 1941, the Empire of Japan launched an [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on the US naval and army base on Pearl Harbor]] in [[Hawaii]], beginning a war between Japan and the United States. Japan had not informed its ally, Germany, in advance of the attack, although the Japanese ambassador had informed the German Foreign Minister, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], at the beginning of December that relations between the US and the Japanese Empire were at a breaking point, and that war was imminent.  He was instructed to ask Germany for commitment to declare war under the terms of the [[Tripartite Pact]] should that occur.  Hitler and Ribbentrop had been urging Japan to attack and take over [[Singapore]] from the British, on the theory that doing so would not only hurt the UK, but would also serve to help keep the US out of the war.<ref name=bullock661>[[Alan Bullock|Bullock, Alan]] (1962) ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]'' London: Penguin. pp.661-64. {{ISBN|0-14-013564-2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B06275A, Berlin, Reichstagssitzung, Rede Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|right|235px|Closeup of Hitler as war is declared upon the United States, 11 December 1941]]\nAccording to the terms of their agreements, Germany was obliged to come to the aid of Japan if a third country attacked Japan, but not if Japan attacked a third country. Ribbentrop reminded Hitler of this, and pointed out that to declare war against the US would add to the number of enemies Germany was fighting, but Hitler dismissed this concern as not being important,<ref name=bullock661 /> and, almost entirely without consultation, chose to declare war against the US, wanting to do so before, he thought, Roosevelt would declare war on Germany.<ref>Kershaw (2007), pp.444-446</ref><ref name=fest655 /><ref name=burleigh731 />\n\nIn fact, Hitler's declaration of war came as a great relief to British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], who feared the possibility of two parallel but disconnected wars &ndash; the UK and Soviet Union versus Germany in Europe, and the US and the British Empire versus Japan in the Far East and the Pacific. With Nazi Germany's declaration against the United States in effect, American assistance for Britain in both theaters of war as a full ally was assured.  It also simplified matters for the American government, as [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] recalled:\n\n<blockquote>When Pearl Harbor happened, we [Roosevelt's advisors] were desperate. ... We were all in agony.  The mood of the American people was obvious &ndash; they were determined that the Japanese had to be punished.  We could have been forced to concentrate all our efforts on the Pacific, unable from then on to give more than purely peripheral help to Britain. It was truly astounding when Hitler declared war on us three days later. I cannot tell you our feelings of triumph.  It was a totally irrational thing for him to do, and I think it saved Europe.\"<ref>[[John Kenneth Galbraith|Galbraith, John Kenneth]], interviewed by [[Gitta Sereny]] (1995) ''Albert Speer: His Battle with the Truth'' New York, Knopf. p.267-8. {{ISBN|0-394-52915-4}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHitler's reasons for declaring war against the US when he was not obligated to were numerous. One was an emotional response: the Japanese tactic of using a surprise attack without making a declaration of war appealed to him &ndash; he had done the same thing when he attacked the [[Soviet Union]] with [[Operation Barbarossa]] in June 1941; indeed, he told the Japanese ambassador \"[O]ne should strike &ndash; as hard as possible &ndash; and not waste time declaring war.\"<ref name=bullock661 />  Also, the prospect of a worldwide war fed Hitler's tendency towards grandiose thinking, and reinforced his feeling that he was a world-historical figure of destiny.  As he said in his declaration speech to the Reichstag:\n\n<blockquote>I can only be grateful to Providence that it entrusted me with the leadership in this historic struggle which, for the next five hundred or a thousand years, will be described as decisive, not only for the history of Germany, but for the whole of Europe and indeed the whole world.<ref name=bullock661 /></blockquote>\n\nHitler's lack of knowledge about the US and its industrial and demographic capacity for mounting a war on two fronts also entered into his decision.<ref name=bullock661 /> As early as mid-March 1941 &ndash; nine months before the Japanese attack &ndash; President Roosevelt was acutely aware of Hitler's hostility towards the United States, and [[New Order (Nazism)#Hitler's plans for North America|the destructive potential it presented]]. Due to this attitude within the [[White House]], and the rapidly progressing efforts of the Americans' industrial capacity before and through 1941 to start providing its armed forces with the ordnance, combat aircraft and ships that would be required to defeat the Axis as a whole, the US was already well on its way towards the full-scale wartime economy which would make it the [[Arsenal of Democracy|\"arsenal of democracy\"]] for itself and its allies.\n\nFinally, Hitler's deeply-held racial prejudices made him see the US as a decadent bourgeois democracy filled with people of mixed race, a population heavily under the influence of Jews and \"Negroes\", with no history of authoritarian discipline to control and direct them, interested only in luxury and living the \"good life\" while dancing, drinking and enjoying \"negrofied\" music.  Such a country, in Hitler's mind, would never be willing to make the economic and human sacrifices necessary to threaten National Socialist Germany<ref name=bullock661 /> \u2014 and thus set the stage for a dangerously inaccurate view of the very nation that Hitler had stated in his unpublished ''[[Zweites Buch]]'' (''Second Book'', 1928) would be the Third Reich's most serious challenge beyond his intended defeat of the Soviet Union.<ref>Hillgruber (1981), pp.50-51</ref>\n\nThe economic potential and racial composition of America had implications for Hitler's own ideological construct, indeed, how he saw Germany's current problems and future hopes. His central ideas of [[Lebensraum|'living space']] and race held the key to his image of the United States. To Hitler the United States was a country with a white 'Nordic' racial core, to which he attributed its economic success and standard of living, and in which he saw a model for his vision of German 'living space' in Europe.<ref>As late as 24 February 1945, Hitler spoke of the 'vast territory' of the United States in America, 'ample to absorb the energies of all their people', as the model which he hoped to emulate for Germany in Europe, 'to ensure for her complete economic independence inside a territory of a size compatible with her population', adding that 'a great people has need of broad acres' Genoud, Francois (ed.)

Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s signing of the declaration of war against Germany, the response of the United States to Hitler's declaration]]\n\nThe one advantage which the declaration of war against the US provided for Hitler was as a propaganda diversion for the German public, to distract them from the state of the war against the Soviet Union, in which Germany had suffered severe setbacks and an unexpectedly prolonged engagement.  Hitler had assured the German people that the Soviet Union would be crushed well before the onset of winter, but that, in fact, did not happen, and there was little in the way of good news. The timing of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor enabled Hitler to angle his planned speech to the Reichstag in a more positive fashion, squeezing as much propaganda value out of it as possible.  Hitler, in fact, put off the speech &ndash; and the declaration of war &ndash; for several days, trying to arrive at the proper psychological moment to make the announcement.<ref>Kershaw (2000), pp.444-45</ref>  Still, the propaganda motive was hardly sufficient to justify declaring war on the US, especially considering that doing so would create an otherwise \"unnatural alliance\" between two disparate and heretofore antagonistic polities, the United States and the Soviet Union.  [[Joachim C. Fest]], one of Hitler's biographers, has argued that Hitler's decision was \"really no longer an act of his own volition, but a gesture governed by a sudden awareness of his own impotence. That gesture was Hitler's last strategic initiative of any importance.\"<ref name=fest655 />\n\nRegardless of Hitler's reasons for the declaration, the decision is generally seen as an enormous strategic blunder on his part, as it allowed the United States to enter the European war in support of the United Kingdom and the Allies without much public opposition, while still facing the Japanese threat in the Pacific. Hitler had, in fact, committed Germany to fight the US while in the midst of a war of extermination against Russia, and without having first defeated the UK, instead of taking the option of putting off a conflict with the US for as long as possible, forcing it to concentrate on the war in the Pacific against Japan, and making it much more difficult for it to become involved in the European war.  At least to some extent he had held in his hands the power to control the timing of the intervention of the US, and instead, by declaring war against America, he freed Roosevelt and Churchill to act as they saw fit.<ref name=bullock /><ref name=fest655>[[Joachim C.

Quote: \"Hitler's declaration of war on the United States ... was not an objective foreign policy move. ... Rather, it was a gesture designed to conceal the fact that he could no longer control the direction of the war... His admission...on January 3, 1942, that he did 'not yet' know 'how America could be defeated' speaks for itself.\"</ref>\n\nFrom the point of view of Hitler and much of the German political and military elite, declaring war against the U.S. in response to the Pearl Harbor attack was a calculated risk in fighting the U.S. before they were prepared to effectively defend themselves.  By that time, the German leadership believed that the United States was effectively acting as a belligerent in the conflict, given actions such as Lend-Lease of supplies to Britain to sustain their war effort, President Roosevelt's public statements, the deployment of American soldiers and Marines to Iceland, and U.S. Navy escorts of convoys across the Atlantic, which sometimes came into contact with U-boats; these acts, as well as America's previous intervention in [[World War I]], led to the assumption that war between them was inevitable.  As such, the decision was made to use the attack as a rationale for an official declaration of war in order to drive Britain out of the conflict by widening submarine operations and directly attacking U.S. commercial shipping.  While Hitler's declaration of war against the United States eventually led to his downfall, initially it seemed successful in its objective of more effectively cutting Britain's supply lines, as the U.S. military's lack of tactics, equipment, and procedures for fighting U-boats caused 1942 to be the most devastating year of the war for shipping losses;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/what-if-hitler-never-declared-war-the-us-during-world-war-ii-17573 |title=What If Hitler Never Declared War on the U.S. During World War II?|last1=Farley |first1=Robert |date=2 September 2016 |website=National Interest.org |publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref> the war declaration enabled the [[Second Happy Time]] for U-boats.<ref>Duncan Redford and Grove, Philip D. (2014) ''The Royal Navy: A History Since 1900'', Tauris. p.182</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitler's Naval Adjutant, Admiral von Puttkamer, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor actually buoyed Hitler's assurance in winning the war, and improved morale among the high leadership of the armed forces. Peter Padfield writes:\n\n<blockquote>The news [of Pearl Harbor] came as a surprise to Hitler although he knew of their intention to attack somewhere at some time and had made up his mind to support them if they attacked the United States.  Now frivolously disregarding the huge financial and productive power of America and, according to ... von Puttkamer, blind to the realization that this power could be projected across the Atlantic, he gained renewed confidence in a victorious outcome to the war.  His generals suffered from the same land-locked hallucination: his entire headquarters staff gave themselves up to 'an ecstasy of rejoicing'; the few who saw further 'became even lonelier'. Naval officers saw no more clearly than the generals.<ref>Padfield, Peter (1984) ''D\u00f6nitz: The Last Fuhrer: Portrait of a Nazi War Leader'' London: Victor Gollancz. {{ISBN|0-575-03186-7}}. p.235; quoting Warlimont, W. (1964) ''Inside Hitler's Headquarters'' Weidenfeld, p.208</ref></blockquote>\n\n== German declaration ==\nHitler arrived in Berlin on Tuesday 9 December and met with Goebbels at midday, when he disclosed his intention to declare war in a speech to the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]], postponing the declaration for 24 hours to give himself time to prepare.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 221</ref> A further meeting with Goebbels on 10 December finalised the planning, although Hitler had yet to work on his speech. The time selected was 3:00 pm, as it was a convenient time for German radio listeners and the broadcast could be received in Tokyo at 10 pm and in Washington DC at 8:00 am. Ribbentrop telephoned the German ambassador in Rome, asking him to contact Mussolini and ensure that Italy's declaration of war be coordinated with Germany's. Meanwhile, there was considerable diplomatic activity to ensure that the amendments to the Tripartite Pact requested by the Japanese government be concluded; the Germans requested that the Japanese ambassador, [[Hiroshi \u014cshima]], should be empowered to sign the [[Tripartite Pact#\"No separate peace\" agreement|\"No separate peace\" agreement]] on Tokyo's behalf to save time.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 236</ref>\n\nBritain and the United States were already aware of German intentions through [[Magic (cryptography)|Magic]] signals intelligence and on 9 December, Roosevelt gave one of his \"[[fireside chats|fireside chat]]\" national broadcasts in which he said that American people should \"Remember always that Germany and Italy, regardless of any formal declaration of war, consider themselves at war with the United States at this moment just as much as they consider themselves at war with Britain or Russia\".<ref>Mawdsley 2011, pp. 223-225</ref> Churchill spoke in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on the morning of 11 December, saying that; \"Not only the British Empire now but the United States are fighting for life; Russia is fighting for life, and China is fighting for life. Behind these four great combatant communities are ranged all the free spirit and hopes of all the conquered countries in Europe...  It would indeed bring shame upon our generation if we did not teach them a lesson which will not be forgotten in the records of a thousand years\".<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 247</ref>\n\nOn Thursday 11 December 1941, American ''Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires'' [[Leland B.

CHARGE D'AFFAIRES:\n\nThe Government of the United States having violated in the most flagrant manner and in ever increasing measure all rules of [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] in favor of the adversaries of Germany and having continually been guilty of the most severe provocations toward Germany ever since the outbreak of the European war, provoked by the [[Neville Chamberlain#Declaration of war|British declaration of war against Germany]] on September 3, 1939, has finally resorted to open military acts of aggression.\n\nOn September 11, 1941, the [[President of the United States]] publicly declared that he had ordered the American Navy and Air Force to shoot on sight at any German war vessel. In his speech of October 27, 1941, he once more expressly affirmed that this order was in force. Acting under this order, vessels of the American Navy, since early September 1941, have systematically attacked German naval forces. Thus, American [[destroyers]], as for instance the [[USS Greer (DD-145)|Greer]], the [[USS Kearny (DD-432)|Kearney]] and the [[USS Reuben James (DD-245)|Reuben James]], have opened fire on German submarines according to plan. The [[Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the American Navy]], Mr. [[Frank Knox|Knox]], himself confirmed that-American destroyers attacked German [[submarines]].\n\nFurthermore, the naval forces of the United States, under order of their Government and contrary to international law have treated and seized German [[Merchant ship|merchant vessels]] on the high seas as enemy ships.\n\nThe German Government therefore establishes the following facts:\n\nAlthough Germany on her part has strictly adhered to the rules of international law in her relations with the United States during every period of the [[World War II|present war]], the Government of the United States from initial violations of neutrality has finally proceeded to open acts of war against Germany. The Government of the United States has thereby virtually created a [[Declaration of war|state of war]].\n\nThe German Government, consequently, discontinues [[diplomatic relations]] with the United States of America and declares that under these circumstances brought about by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] Germany too, as from today, considers herself as being in a state of war with the United States of America.\n\nAccept, Mr. Charge d'Affaires, the expression of my high consideration.\n\nDecember 11, 1941.\n\nRIBBENTROP.<ref>{{cite web|title=German Declaration of War with the United States : December 11, 1941|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/gerdec41.asp|work=The Avalon Project|publisher=Lillian Goldman Law Library|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe same text had been sent to [[Hans Thomsen]], the German ''charg\u00e9 d'affaires'' in Washington, with instructions to present it to [[Cordell Hull]], the [[United States Secretary of State]] at 3:30 pm, German [[summer time]], 8:30 am [[Eastern Standard Time]].<ref>Smyth & Lambert 1964, p. 999</ref> On their arrival however, Hull refused to see the German delegation and it was not until 9:30 that they were able pass their note to [[Ray Atherton]], the head of the Division of European Affairs.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 253</ref> In Berlin, there was consternation that Mussolini had decided to preempt Hitler and declare war in a speech from the balcony at the [[Palazzo Venezia]] at 2:45 pm; an estimated crowd of 100,000 gathered to hear his speech which lasted only four minutes.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, pp. 248-249</ref>\n\nAt 3:00 pm, Hitler addressed the 855 deputies of the Reichstag gathered in the [[Kroll Opera House]], with a speech lasting for 88 minutes in which he listed German successes to date but failed to mention the stalled offensive in Russia. The second part of the speech was devoted to an attack on Roosevelt and the \"the Anglo-Saxon Jewish-capitalist world\", concluding that \"In the 2,000 years of German history known to us, our ''Volk'' has never been more unified and united than it is today\".<ref>Mawdsley 2011, pp. 250-253</ref> On the same day, German ambassadors in the capitals of the other Tripartite Pact signatories; [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovakia]], were instructed to obtain their declarations of war against the United States.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 253</ref>\n\nRoosevelt had written a brief note to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on the morning of 11 December asking them to declare war on Germany and Italy; meeting at noon, the motion passed through both houses without dissent, although there were some abstentions.

Alonzo gets a tip off on a possible sighting of a COPE location, and goes to investigate. He informs Harris, who uses satellite footage which confirms that Jillian and Zoe are there, but Bass has gone. The FBI are then sent and both Harris and Grace follow. Alonzo, believing that a mass suicide is about to happen, goes up to the house. Indicating that he is looking for Jillian and Zoe he enters, but is shot by Nora. Alycia starts getting help from RE/SYST. But when TV news about the COPE location appears on the internet, she is doxxed by RE/SYST who say she is a traitor for working with the US government. Grace enters the house, and with Jillian's help she manages to get Zoe and Alonzo out. Harris and the FBI then assault the house, but Nora escapes with Jillian. Darius realises that the rail gun is the target of attack. He orders Dr. Rosetta Stendahl to shut down the rail gun, and evacuate the site. Nate manages to get into the control room, infecting the computer with a virus which causes the rail gun to be destroyed killing Dr. Rosetta Stendahl and Nate.\n\n |LineColor       = 800285\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 25\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 12\n |Title           = Hail Marry\n |DirectedBy      = Joe Gallagher\n |WrittenBy       = [[Jeffrey Lieber]] and K.D.
