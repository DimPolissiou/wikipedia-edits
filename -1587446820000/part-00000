The following year, they broke their own record becoming the first artists ever to perform for eight consecutive days at Tokyo Dome during their ''Break The Records: By You & For You 2009'' tour.

They also became part of other variety programs like ''Minna no Terebi'' and ''KAT-TUNx3''. KAT-TUN even became special supporters for the ''FIVB World Grand Champions Cup'' in 2005, wherein their song \"Gloria\" served as its theme song.\n\nFrom 2005 to January 2007, KAT-TUN was a regular participant in the variety show ''[[Utawara Hot Hit 10]]'' with [[Jun Matsumoto]]. From October 8, 2006, members Tanaka Koki & Nakamaru Yuichi hosted the show [[YouTachi! YOU\u305f\u3061!]] together, until the show ended on September 30, 2007.\n\nFrom April 4, 2007, KAT-TUN then began hosting their own talk show ''[[Cartoon KAT-TUN]]'' every Wednesday until March 24, 2010, comprising a total of 152 episodes. This was their last regular show as a 6-member group.\n\nAfter becoming a 5-member group, their next TV show titled ''KAT-TUN no Zettai Manetaku Naru TV'' began on October 18, 2011 on [[Nippon TV|NTV]] and lasted only for a total of 10 episodes, with the show's finale on December 20, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=KAT-TUN\u306e\u7d76\u5bfe\u30de\u30cd\u305f\u304f\u306a\u308bTV|url=http://www.ntv.co.jp/kzm/index.html|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=Japanese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407193359/http://www.ntv.co.jp/kzm/index.html|archivedate=7 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nKAT-TUN then also had a one-off TV special titled ''KAT-TUN no Sekaiichi Dame Yoru Ni'' which was aired on the night of January 1, 2012 on [[TBS Television|TBS]]. It was soon followed by another special episode on April 3, 2012. Following the success of the two special episodes of the show, it became KAT-TUN's third regular TV show. The show was then renamed as ''KAT-TUN Sekaiichi Dame na Yoru!'' and began airing from August 24, 2012 until December 28, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=KAT-TUN\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u4e00\u30c0\u30e1\u306a\u591c\uff01|url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/kat-tun_dameyoru/|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nOn January 11, 2014, after becoming a four-man group, KAT-TUN became guests for a special program titled ''KAT-TUN Sekaiichi Tame ni Naru Tabi'' where they traveled to Okinawa (for two episodes), Aomori, Hokkaido and Kumamoto.

The pair collaborated once again as the leads for the 2011 shows alongside fellow KAT-TUN member Yuichi Nakamaru. The 2012 shows for the musical began in September, and once again Kamenashi reprised his role as the lead for the musical.\n\n===Concerts===\nSince their first concert in 2002, granted after overwhelming numbers of fan requests to Johnny's, KAT-TUN regularly holds concerts during almost every season of the year in Japan. This has helped them gain more popularity with their fans. It was considered remarkable for a Johnny's group which had not yet officially debuted to be able to hold its own concerts.\n\nKAT-TUN was the first Japanese artist to perform for four days in a row at Tokyo Dome during their ''Queen of Pirates'' tour. The following year, they broke their own record becoming the first artists ever to perform for eight consecutive days at Tokyo Dome during their ''Break The Records: By You & For You 2009'' tour. Now, Johnny & Associates submitted this new record to [[Guinness Book of World Records]] for KAT-TUN to be recognized as the Japanese boy band who broke the records in Tokyo Dome performances.<ref name=\"guinness\">{{cite web|title=KAT-TUN concerts may qualify for Guinness|url=http://www.tokyograph.com/news/id-4850}}</ref>\n\nThe group (excluding Jin Akanishi) held their biggest ever concert tour in 2010 titled ''KAT-TUN -NO MORE PAI\u0418- WORLD TOUR 2010'' which consisted of concerts in many major cities across Japan. The tour also included concerts held in Taiwan and Korea; the first time the group has ever toured outside Japan for their official concerts. \nAlthough during their pre-debut years, KAT-TUN had on several occasions toured overseas with their senior groups, while they were still Johnny Jrs.\n\nTheir nationwide tour for 2012 titled ''KAT-TUN LIVE TOUR 2012 CHAIN'' began in Nagiita on Feb 11, they toured 12 cities across Japan including Sendai; which was one of the worst affected areas by the Tohoku earthquake & tsunami disaster back in March 2011.\n\n===Commercials===\nKAT-TUN regularly appeared in TV commercials to endorse for [[NTT docomo]], [[SKY PerfecTV!]], [[Rohto Pharmaceutical Co.|Rohto]] and [[Lotte (conglomerate)|Lotte]] from 2005 to 2009.\n\nSince 2010, member Kazuya Kamenashi endorses [[Panasonic Corporation|Panasonic]]'s Lamdash shaver and DOLTZ electric toothbrush, and [http://www.aoki-style.com/ AOKI] 3D slim suits. Kamenashi also endorses [http://www.beverage.co.jp/gogo/ KIRIN]'s 'Gogo no Kocha' tea since March 2012, and is endorsing [http://sours.jp/ SOURS Gummies] since early 2013.\n\nSince early 2011, the group together has endorsed [[Suzuki]]'s 'SOLIO' car, and has sung commercial theme songs for [http://www.sofina.co.jp/ Sofina] and Wing products.

After playing [[college basketball]] for [[Duke University]], Hill played for four teams in his professional career in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA): The [[Detroit Pistons]], the [[Orlando Magic]], the [[Phoenix Suns]], and the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. For most of his career, he played the small forward position. Hill also co-hosts ''[[NBA Inside Stuff]]'' on [[NBA TV]].\n\nHill played basketball at [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke University]] for four years. He was the 1994 [[Atlantic Coast Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year|ACC Player of the Year]], a two-time [[NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|NCAA All-American]], and a two-time [[List of NCAA Men's Division I Basketball champions|NCAA champion]]. Hill was touted as one of the best players in Duke history and as one of the greatest collegiate basketball players of his era.\n\nAfter graduating from Duke in 1994, Hill was selected by the [[Detroit Pistons]] with the third overall pick in the [[1994 NBA draft|NBA draft]]. He was the co-winner of the 1995 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Early in his NBA career, Hill was widely considered to be one of the best all-around players in the game, often leading his team in points, [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] and [[assist (basketball)|assists]]. In his first six seasons in the NBA, Hill averaged 21.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game and made the Eastern Conference All-Star Team five times. However, the trajectory of his career was altered by a 2000 ankle injury. The injury continued to plague him for several years, led to a March 2003 surgery that was followed by life-threatening complications, and forced him to miss the entire 2003\u201304 season. In 2005, Hill made the Eastern Conference All-Star Team as a member of the Magic. He played in the Western Conference Finals in 2010 during his tenure with the Phoenix Suns. In the 12 seasons following his ankle injury, Hill averaged 13.1 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game. On June 1, 2013, Hill announced his retirement from the NBA. He is a seven-time [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]], a five-time [[All-NBA]] selection, and a three-time winner of the [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]]. In 2018, he was inducted into the [[Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\nAn ownership group including Hill and [[Tony Ressler]] purchased the [[Atlanta Hawks]] on June 24, 2015.\n\n==College basketball career==\n{{BLP sources section|date=November 2019}}\nWhen the time came to choose a college, Hill's mother told the [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] documentary ''[[Beyond the Glory]]'', that she wanted him to attend [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]], while his father preferred the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|University of North Carolina]]. Hill decided to attend [[Duke University]], playing four years with the [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Blue Devils]] and winning national titles in [[1991 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1991]] and [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1992]]. Duke became the first Division I program to win consecutive titles since [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] in [[1973 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1973]]. Despite losing two of the biggest contributors on the Blue Devils, [[Christian Laettner]] (in 1992) and [[Bobby Hurley]] (each of whom went on to play in the NBA), Hill led Duke to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|championship game]] once again in [[1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1994]], but lost to [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]] [[1993\u201394 Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball team|Razorbacks]]. Hill won the [[Henry Iba Corinthian Award]] as the nation's top defensive player in 1993, and in 1994 he was the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Player of the Year. During his collegiate career, Hill became the first player in ACC history to collect more than 1,900 points, 700 rebounds, 400 assists, 200 steals and 100 blocked shots. As a result of his successful college career, he became the eighth player in Duke history to have his jersey number (33) retired. After his freshman season at Duke, Hill played on the bronze medal-winning U.S. team at the [[1991 Pan American Games]], held in [[Havana]], Cuba.\n\nHill also is widely known for his role in a desperation play in an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] regional final against [[1991\u201392 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] in 1992, which is considered by many to be [[The Shot (Duke\u2013Kentucky)|one of the greatest college basketball games of all time]]. With Duke down 103\u2013102 in [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] and 2.1 seconds remaining after Kentucky's [[Sean Woods]] hit a floater, an unguarded Hill heaved the in-bounds pass 75 feet across the court into the hands of Laettner, who dribbled once and spun before pulling up to make the game-winning jumper from just outside the free-throw line as time expired.\n\nTouted as one of the best players in Duke history, many went as far as to say that Hill was one of the greatest collegiate basketball players of his era.<ref>Brodess, Doug (October 24, 2011).

Hill ended up sharing [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]] honors with [[Jason Kidd]] of the [[Dallas Mavericks]], becoming the first Piston since [[Dave Bing]] in [[1966\u201367 NBA season|1966\u201367]] to win the award. Hill also won the ''[[Sporting News]]'' Rookie of the Year Award. He was named to the all-NBA First Team in 1997, and all-NBA Second Teams in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000. Hill also regularly played in the [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|NBA All-Star Game]], where he made history by being the first rookie to lead an NBA All-Star fan balloting in ([[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395]]) with 1,289,585 votes,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6325252_ITM | work=Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service | title=Hill's record 1,289,585 votes will go down in all-star history.

In addition, he became the first rookie in any of the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|four major professional sports leagues]] to lead all-star fan voting.\n\nIn his second season ([[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396]]), he once again led the All-Star fan balloting, this time edging [[Michael Jordan]] (Jordan's first All-Star game after returning since retiring in 1993). During the 1995\u201396 season, Hill showcased his all-round abilities by leading the NBA in [[triple-double]]s (10). He also won a [[gold medal]] at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]] as a member of the [[United States men's national basketball team#1996 U.S. Olympic Basketball Team|U.S. men's basketball team]], where he had the team's fifth highest scoring average (9.7) and led the team in steals (18). In [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]], Hill averaged 21.4 points, 9.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game. He became the first player since [[Larry Bird]] in [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390]] to average 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists in a season, an accomplishment that had not been duplicated until [[Russell Westbrook]] averaged a triple-double in the [[2016-17 NBA season]]. Once again, Hill led the league in triple-doubles, where his 13 triple-doubles represented 35 percent of the league's triple-double total that season. He was the league's Player of the Month for January and was also awarded NBA's [[IBM Award]], given to the player with the biggest statistical contributions to his team. He finished third in [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] voting, behind [[Karl Malone]] and Michael Jordan.\n\nMuch like [[Scottie Pippen]] with the [[Chicago Bulls|Bulls]], Hill assumed the role of a \"[[point forward]]\" in Detroit, running the Pistons' offense. As a result, between the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396]] and [[1998\u201399 NBA season]]s, Hill was the league leader in assists per game among non-guards all four seasons. In the [[1998\u201399 NBA season|lockout-shortened 1999 season]], as he led his team in points, rebounds and assists for the third time, Hill joined [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and [[Elgin Baylor]] as the only players in NBA history to lead their teams in scoring, rebounding and assists more than once. Hill and Chamberlain are the only two players in league history to lead their teams in points, rebounds and assists per game three times. Hill was selected to play in the [[1998 FIBA World Championship]], but in the end no NBA players played in this tournament due to the [[lockout (industry)|lockout]].\n\nIn [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]], Hill averaged 25.8 points while shooting 49% from the field, the season's third highest scoring average, behind MVP [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Allen Iverson]]. He averaged 6.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game. However, despite Hill's individual accomplishments in Detroit, the Pistons never made it far in the playoffs, either losing in the first round ([[1996 NBA Playoffs|1996]], [[1997 NBA Playoffs|1997]] and [[1999 NBA Playoffs|1999]]), or missing the playoffs entirely in the 1994\u201395 and [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 seasons]]. The [[2000 NBA Playoffs|2000 playoffs]] would be no different. On April 15, 2000, 7 days before the start of the playoffs, Hill sprained his left ankle in a game against the [[1999\u20132000 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]]. He continued to play until the first round playoff series against the [[1999\u20132000 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]], in which his injured ankle got worse and Hill was forced to leave halfway through game 2. Eventually, the Heat swept the Pistons 3\u20130. Hill was initially selected for the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympics]] U.S. team, but could not play due to the ankle injury. That ankle injury would prove to be a major liability for many years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/03/17/grant-hill-on-wfan-ankle-nightmare-would-have-been-avoided-with-knicks/|title=Grant Hill: Ankle Nightmare Would Have Been Avoided With Knicks|date=March 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter the first six seasons of his career, before ankle injury, Hill had amassed a total of 9,393 points, 3,417 rebounds and 2,720 assists. [[Oscar Robertson]], Bird, and [[LeBron James]] are the only three players in league history to eclipse these numbers after their first six seasons.\n\n===Orlando Magic (2000\u20132007)===\nAs an unrestricted free agent, Hill had planned to sign with the [[2000\u201301 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]]. On August 3, 2000, however, a sign-and-trade deal allowed Hill to receive a slightly more lucrative contract while Detroit received at least some compensation for losing him. The Pistons signed Hill to a seven-year, $92.8 million contract and traded him to Orlando for [[Chucky Atkins]] and [[Ben Wallace]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Magic's Strength No Illusion|date = August 3, 2000|url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/magics-strength-no-illusion/|work = CBS News|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}</ref> The Magic hoped he would team up with budding superstar [[Tracy McGrady]], who had been signed away from the [[Toronto Raptors]] at that time, to return Orlando among the NBA elite. But Hill was hampered by ankle injuries, playing in only four games in his [[2000\u201301 NBA season|first]] season with the Magic, 14 games in his [[2001\u201302 NBA season|second]] and 29 in his [[2002\u201303 NBA season|third]]. He was forced to sit out his ''entire'' fourth year with Orlando ([[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304]]). Meanwhile, the Pistons, who had defeated the Magic in the [[2003 NBA Playoffs|2003 Playoffs]], but ended up losing to the New Jersey Nets in the Eastern Conference Finals, won the championship the following year in [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2004]].\n\nGrant was a Yes Man.

Grant cursed aids.\n\nIn March 2003, Hill underwent a major surgical procedure in which doctors re-fractured his ankle and realigned it with his leg bone. Five days after the surgery was performed, Hill developed a 104.5&nbsp;\u00b0F (40.3&nbsp;\u00b0C) [[fever]] and [[convulsion]]s, and was rushed to a hospital. Doctors removed the splint around his ankle and discovered that Hill had contracted a potentially fatal [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) infection. He was hospitalized for a week and had to take [[intravenous]] [[antibiotics]] for six months.\n\nIn the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]] Hill, though hampered by a bruised left shin that caused him to miss several games, started and played 67 games for the Magic. He was named the Eastern Conference player of the week for the week between November 15\u201321, 2004. Over the season, Hill averaged 19.7 points per game on a .509 field goal percentage. Fans voted him an All-Star starter again, and he led the Eastern Conference All-Star Team to a victory over the West. In addition, at the conclusion of the season, Hill was awarded the [[Joe Dumars Trophy]] presented to the [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]] Winner.\n\nDuring the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]] Hill was once again injured frequently as nagging groin injuries kept him sidelined for much of the first half of the season, limiting him to 21 games. He got a sports [[hernia]] that was caused by an uneven pressure on Hill's feet while he was running, due to concerns that he could re-aggravate the injury on his left ankle if it got too much pressure. Hill underwent surgery for the hernia and stated that he would consider retirement if he had to get another surgery.\n\nIn the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]] Hill returned from injuries despite numerous rumors surrounding his retirement. Hill received ankle rotation therapy from specialists in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] during the off-season and stated that he had regained much motion in his left ankle. Hill returned to the Magic lineup, starting at the [[shooting guard]] position. Despite having problems with injuries to his left knee and a [[tendon]] in his left ankle, Hill managed to play 65 games, two short of the highest number of games he played over a single season as a member of the Magic. He finished the season with averages of 14.4 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game. This season would see Hill return to the playoffs for the first time since 2000, his first playoff appearance with the Magic. The 8th seed Magic would meet Hill's old team, the [[2006\u201307 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]], in the first round. The Pistons' vast playoff experience would prevail over the inexperienced Magic, who had not seen significant post-season action for some years, and despite having some close games, the series would end with a 4\u20130 Pistons sweep, leaving Hill undecided on whether to return for the [[2007\u201308 NBA season|2007\u201308 season]] with the Magic, sign with another team, or retire.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2007/news/story?id=2852728 Beset by injuries in career, Hill considers retirement], updated April 28, 2007</ref>\n\n===Phoenix Suns (2007\u20132012)===\n[[File:Grant Hill Phoenix.jpg|thumb|right|Hill with the Phoenix Suns in 2009]]\nHill became an [[unrestricted free agent]] on July 1, 2007.

Hill adapted well to the Suns' up-tempo style, averaging double figures in points as a key role player for Phoenix in the early months of the 2007\u201308 season. He played in the team's first 34 games before an emergency appendectomy on January 9, 2008, sidelined him for two weeks.

After playing [[college basketball]] for [[Duke University]], Hill played for four teams in his professional career in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA): The [[Detroit Pistons]], the [[Orlando Magic]], the [[Phoenix Suns]], and the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. For most of his career, he played the small forward position. Hill also co-hosts ''[[NBA Inside Stuff]]'' on [[NBA TV]].\n\nHill played basketball at [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke University]] for four years. He was the 1994 [[Atlantic Coast Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year|ACC Player of the Year]], a two-time [[NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|NCAA All-American]], and a two-time [[List of NCAA Men's Division I Basketball champions|NCAA champion]]. Hill was touted as one of the best players in Duke history and as one of the greatest collegiate basketball players of his era.\n\nAfter graduating from Duke in 1994, Hill was selected by the [[Detroit Pistons]] with the third overall pick in the [[1994 NBA draft|NBA draft]]. He was the co-winner of the 1995 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Early in his NBA career, Hill was widely considered to be one of the best all-around players in the game, often leading his team in points, [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] and [[assist (basketball)|assists]]. In his first six seasons in the NBA, Hill averaged 21.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game and made the Eastern Conference All-Star Team five times. However, the trajectory of his career was altered by a 2000 ankle injury. The injury continued to plague him for several years, led to a March 2003 surgery that was followed by life-threatening complications, and forced him to miss the entire 2003\u201304 season. In 2005, Hill made the Eastern Conference All-Star Team as a member of the Magic. He played in the Western Conference Finals in 2010 during his tenure with the Phoenix Suns. In the 12 seasons following his ankle injury, Hill averaged 13.1 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game. On June 1, 2013, Hill announced his retirement from the NBA. He is a seven-time [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]], a five-time [[All-NBA]] selection, and a three-time winner of the [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]]. In 2018, he was inducted into the [[Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\nAn ownership group including Hill and [[Tony Ressler]] purchased the [[Atlanta Hawks]] on June 24, 2015.\n\n==College basketball career==\n{{BLP sources section|date=November 2019}}\nWhen the time came to choose a college, Hill's mother told the [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] documentary ''[[Beyond the Glory]]'', that she wanted him to attend [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]], while his father preferred the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|University of North Carolina]]. Hill decided to attend [[Duke University]], playing four years with the [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Blue Devils]] and winning national titles in [[1991 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1991]] and [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1992]]. Duke became the first Division I program to win consecutive titles since [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] in [[1973 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1973]]. Despite losing two of the biggest contributors on the Blue Devils, [[Christian Laettner]] (in 1992) and [[Bobby Hurley]] (each of whom went on to play in the NBA), Hill led Duke to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|championship game]] once again in [[1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1994]], but lost to [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]] [[1993\u201394 Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball team|Razorbacks]]. Hill won the [[Henry Iba Corinthian Award]] as the nation's top defensive player in 1993, and in 1994 he was the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Player of the Year. During his collegiate career, Hill became the first player in ACC history to collect more than 1,900 points, 700 rebounds, 400 assists, 200 steals and 100 blocked shots. As a result of his successful college career, he became the eighth player in Duke history to have his jersey number (33) retired. After his freshman season at Duke, Hill played on the bronze medal-winning U.S. team at the [[1991 Pan American Games]], held in [[Havana]], Cuba.\n\nHill also is widely known for his role in a desperation play in an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] regional final against [[1991\u201392 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] in 1992, which is considered by many to be [[The Shot (Duke\u2013Kentucky)|one of the greatest college basketball games of all time]]. With Duke down 103\u2013102 in [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] and 2.1 seconds remaining after Kentucky's [[Sean Woods]] hit a floater, an unguarded Hill heaved the in-bounds pass 75 feet across the court into the hands of Laettner, who dribbled once and spun before pulling up to make the game-winning jumper from just outside the free-throw line as time expired.\n\nTouted as one of the best players in Duke history, many went as far as to say that Hill was one of the greatest collegiate basketball players of his era.<ref>Brodess, Doug (October 24, 2011).

He generally played the small forward position during his NBA career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/sports/2013/08/versatile-nba-players-history/grant-hill|title=The 25 Most Versatile Players in NBA History|last=Sibor|first=Doug|work=Complex.com|date=August 14, 2013|access-date=November 25, 2019}}</ref> In his first season, he averaged 19.9 points, 6.4 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.77 steals per game, and became the first Pistons rookie since [[Isiah Thomas]] in [[1981\u201382 NBA season|1981\u201382]] to score 1000 points. Hill ended up sharing [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]] honors with [[Jason Kidd]] of the [[Dallas Mavericks]], becoming the first Piston since [[Dave Bing]] in [[1966\u201367 NBA season|1966\u201367]] to win the award. Hill also won the ''[[Sporting News]]'' Rookie of the Year Award. He was named to the all-NBA First Team in 1997, and all-NBA Second Teams in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000. Hill also regularly played in the [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|NBA All-Star Game]], where he made history by being the first rookie to lead an NBA All-Star fan balloting in ([[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395]]) with 1,289,585 votes,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6325252_ITM | work=Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service | title=Hill's record 1,289,585 votes will go down in all-star history.

In addition, he became the first rookie in any of the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|four major professional sports leagues]] to lead all-star fan voting.\n\nIn his second season ([[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396]]), he once again led the All-Star fan balloting, this time edging [[Michael Jordan]] (Jordan's first All-Star game after returning since retiring in 1993). During the 1995\u201396 season, Hill showcased his all-round abilities by leading the NBA in [[triple-double]]s (10). He also won a [[gold medal]] at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]] as a member of the [[United States men's national basketball team#1996 U.S. Olympic Basketball Team|U.S. men's basketball team]], where he had the team's fifth highest scoring average (9.7) and led the team in steals (18). In [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]], Hill averaged 21.4 points, 9.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game. He became the first player since [[Larry Bird]] in [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390]] to average 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists in a season, an accomplishment that had not been duplicated until [[Russell Westbrook]] averaged a triple-double in the [[2016-17 NBA season]]. Once again, Hill led the league in triple-doubles, where his 13 triple-doubles represented 35 percent of the league's triple-double total that season. He was the league's Player of the Month for January and was also awarded NBA's [[IBM Award]], given to the player with the biggest statistical contributions to his team. He finished third in [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] voting, behind [[Karl Malone]] and Michael Jordan.\n\nMuch like [[Scottie Pippen]] with the [[Chicago Bulls|Bulls]], Hill assumed the role of a \"[[point forward]]\" in Detroit, running the Pistons' offense. As a result, between the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396]] and [[1998\u201399 NBA season]]s, Hill was the league leader in assists per game among non-guards all four seasons. In the [[1998\u201399 NBA season|lockout-shortened 1999 season]], as he led his team in points, rebounds and assists for the third time, Hill joined [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and [[Elgin Baylor]] as the only players in NBA history to lead their teams in scoring, rebounding and assists more than once. Hill and Chamberlain are the only two players in league history to lead their teams in points, rebounds and assists per game three times. Hill was selected to play in the [[1998 FIBA World Championship]], but in the end no NBA players played in this tournament due to the [[lockout (industry)|lockout]].\n\nIn [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]], Hill averaged 25.8 points while shooting 49% from the field, the season's third highest scoring average, behind MVP [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Allen Iverson]]. He averaged 6.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game. However, despite Hill's individual accomplishments in Detroit, the Pistons never made it far in the playoffs, either losing in the first round ([[1996 NBA Playoffs|1996]], [[1997 NBA Playoffs|1997]] and [[1999 NBA Playoffs|1999]]), or missing the playoffs entirely in the 1994\u201395 and [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 seasons]]. The [[2000 NBA Playoffs|2000 playoffs]] would be no different. On April 15, 2000, 7 days before the start of the playoffs, Hill sprained his left ankle in a game against the [[1999\u20132000 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]]. He continued to play until the first round playoff series against the [[1999\u20132000 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]], in which his injured ankle got worse and Hill was forced to leave halfway through game 2. Eventually, the Heat swept the Pistons 3\u20130. Hill was initially selected for the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympics]] U.S. team, but could not play due to the ankle injury. That ankle injury would prove to be a major liability for many years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/03/17/grant-hill-on-wfan-ankle-nightmare-would-have-been-avoided-with-knicks/|title=Grant Hill: Ankle Nightmare Would Have Been Avoided With Knicks|date=March 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter the first six seasons of his career, before ankle injury, Hill had amassed a total of 9,393 points, 3,417 rebounds and 2,720 assists. [[Oscar Robertson]], Bird, and [[LeBron James]] are the only three players in league history to eclipse these numbers after their first six seasons.\n\n===Orlando Magic (2000\u20132007)===\nAs an unrestricted free agent, Hill had planned to sign with the [[2000\u201301 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]]. On August 3, 2000, however, a sign-and-trade deal allowed Hill to receive a slightly more lucrative contract while Detroit received at least some compensation for losing him. The Pistons signed Hill to a seven-year, $92.8 million contract and traded him to Orlando for [[Chucky Atkins]] and [[Ben Wallace]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Magic's Strength No Illusion|date = August 3, 2000|url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/magics-strength-no-illusion/|work = CBS News|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}</ref> The Magic hoped he would team up with budding superstar [[Tracy McGrady]], who had been signed away from the [[Toronto Raptors]] at that time, to return Orlando among the NBA elite. But Hill was hampered by ankle injuries, playing in only four games in his [[2000\u201301 NBA season|first]] season with the Magic, 14 games in his [[2001\u201302 NBA season|second]] and 29 in his [[2002\u201303 NBA season|third]]. He was forced to sit out his ''entire'' fourth year with Orlando ([[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304]]). Meanwhile, the Pistons, who had defeated the Magic in the [[2003 NBA Playoffs|2003 Playoffs]], but ended up losing to the New Jersey Nets in the Eastern Conference Finals, won the championship the following year in [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2004]].\n\nIn March 2003, Hill underwent a major surgical procedure in which doctors re-fractured his ankle and realigned it with his leg bone. Five days after the surgery was performed, Hill developed a 104.5&nbsp;\u00b0F (40.3&nbsp;\u00b0C) [[fever]] and [[convulsion]]s, and was rushed to a hospital. Doctors removed the splint around his ankle and discovered that Hill had contracted a potentially fatal [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) infection. He was hospitalized for a week and had to take [[intravenous]] [[antibiotics]] for six months.\n\nIn the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]] Hill, though hampered by a bruised left shin that caused him to miss several games, started and played 67 games for the Magic. He was named the Eastern Conference player of the week for the week between November 15\u201321, 2004. Over the season, Hill averaged 19.7 points per game on a .509 field goal percentage. Fans voted him an All-Star starter again, and he led the Eastern Conference All-Star Team to a victory over the West. In addition, at the conclusion of the season, Hill was awarded the [[Joe Dumars Trophy]] presented to the [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]] Winner.\n\nDuring the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]] Hill was once again injured frequently as nagging groin injuries kept him sidelined for much of the first half of the season, limiting him to 21 games. He got a sports [[hernia]] that was caused by an uneven pressure on Hill's feet while he was running, due to concerns that he could re-aggravate the injury on his left ankle if it got too much pressure. Hill underwent surgery for the hernia and stated that he would consider retirement if he had to get another surgery.\n\nIn the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]] Hill returned from injuries despite numerous rumors surrounding his retirement. Hill received ankle rotation therapy from specialists in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] during the off-season and stated that he had regained much motion in his left ankle. Hill returned to the Magic lineup, starting at the [[shooting guard]] position. Despite having problems with injuries to his left knee and a [[tendon]] in his left ankle, Hill managed to play 65 games, two short of the highest number of games he played over a single season as a member of the Magic. He finished the season with averages of 14.4 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game. This season would see Hill return to the playoffs for the first time since 2000, his first playoff appearance with the Magic. The 8th seed Magic would meet Hill's old team, the [[2006\u201307 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]], in the first round. The Pistons' vast playoff experience would prevail over the inexperienced Magic, who had not seen significant post-season action for some years, and despite having some close games, the series would end with a 4\u20130 Pistons sweep, leaving Hill undecided on whether to return for the [[2007\u201308 NBA season|2007\u201308 season]] with the Magic, sign with another team, or retire.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2007/news/story?id=2852728 Beset by injuries in career, Hill considers retirement], updated April 28, 2007</ref>\n\n===Phoenix Suns (2007\u20132012)===\n[[File:Grant Hill Phoenix.jpg|thumb|right|Hill with the Phoenix Suns in 2009]]\nHill became an [[unrestricted free agent]] on July 1, 2007.

Hill was named captain along with [[Steve Nash]]. Hill was given permission by [[Phoenix Suns Ring of Honor|Suns Ring of Honor]] member, [[Alvan Adams]], to wear his familiar No. 33 with the Suns. Hill adapted well to the Suns' up-tempo style, averaging double figures in points as a key role player for Phoenix in the early months of the 2007\u201308 season. He played in the team's first 34 games before an emergency appendectomy on January 9, 2008, sidelined him for two weeks. Despite being bothered by multiple injuries throughout the season, Hill had his first 70-game season since leaving Detroit, averaging 13.1 ppg, 5.0 rpg and 2.9 apg in the process.\n\nPlaying for the Phoenix Suns in the 2008\u20132009 season, Hill appeared in all 82 games for the first time in his career and averaged 12.0 ppg, 4.90 rpg, and 2.3 apg, scoring 27 points and 10 rebounds in the Suns' season finale.\n\nOn July 10, 2009, the [[Associated Press]] reported that Hill decided to re-sign with the Phoenix Suns for a 2-year deal, despite an offer from the [[2009\u201310 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] for the full mid-level exception and the [[2009\u201310 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] offering Hill the bi-annual exception.<ref>Aldridge, David.

Khrushchev got into a public and now-famous argument with [[Ernst Neizvestny]], sculptor (1925-2016), regarding the function of art in society. However, this altercation had the unintended effect of fomenting unofficial art as a movement. Artists could no longer hold delusions that the state would recognize their art, yet the climate had become friendly and open enough that a coherent organization had formed. Additionally, punishments for unofficial artists became less severe; they were denied admittance to the union instead of being executed.\n\nAs a \"movement\" nonconformist art was stylistically diverse. However, in the post-thaw era its function and role in society became clear. As the Russian curator, author and museum director Joseph Bakstein wrote, <blockquote> The duality of life in which the official perception of everyday reality is independent of the reality of the imagination leads to a situation where art plays a special role in society. In any culture, art is a special reality, but in the Soviet Union, art was doubly real precisely because it had no relation to reality. It was a higher reality.... The goal of nonconformism in art was to challenge the status of official artistic reality, to question it, to treat it with irony. Yet that was the one unacceptable thing. All of Soviet society rested on orthodoxy, and nonconformism was its enemy. That is why even the conditional and partial legalization of nonconformism in the mid-1970s was the beginning of the end of the Soviet regime.<ref name=\"Bakshtein, Joseph 1995, p. 332\">Bakshtein, Joseph. \"A View from Moscow,\" ''Nonconformist Art: The Soviet Experience 1956-1986'', eds.

They can be difficult to classify because often they were not related due to stylistic objectives, but geographical proximity. Furthermore, participation in these groups was fluid as the community of nonconformist artists in Moscow was relatively small and close-knit.\n\n===Lianozovo Group===\n\nThe  Lianozovo Group formed in 1958 was  named after the small village [[Lianozovo District|Lianozovo]] outside Moscow, where most of the artists lived and worked.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://artathhar.wordpress.com/2012/12/16/under-the-iron-curtain-modern-art-from-the-soviet-bloc/ |title=Under the Iron Curtain: Modern Art from the Soviet Bloc |last=artathhar |date=2012-12-16 |website=Derfner Judaica Museum + The Art Collection Exhibition Catalogues |language=en |access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> The members of this group were: Evgenii Kropivnitsky {{Interlanguage link multi| |ru|3=\u041a\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, the artist and poet, Olga Potapova {{Interlanguage link multi| |ru|3=\u041f\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u0410\u043d\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430}}, [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]], [[Lidiya Masterkova|Lidia Masterkova]], [[Vladimir Nemukhin]], Nikolai Vechtomov  and the poets Vsevolod Nekrasov {{Interlanguage link multi| |ru|3=\u041d\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432, \u0412\u0441\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, [[Genrikh Sapgir]], and [[Igor Kholin]].

Artists began experimenting with abstraction, as it was the antithesis of Socialist Realism. However, the fallout from the [[Manezh]] exhibition, in 1962, caused restrictions to be enforced once again. The new restrictions could not however, curtail what the young artists had learned during the five-year interlude. Additionally, [[Victor Tupitsyn]] points out that the 1960s mark an era of \"decommunalization\" in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev worked to improve housing conditions, and a consequence of this was that artists began to get studios of their own, or shared spaces with like-minded colleagues.<ref name=\"Tupitsyn\"/> \n\nOfficially, those in the Lianozovo group were members of the Moscow Union of Graphic Artists, working in the applied and graphic arts. As such, they were not permitted to hold painting exhibitions, as that fell under the domain of the Artists' Union. Consequently, apartment exhibitions and literary salons began at this time as a means of publicly exhibiting. However, the Lianozovo group in particular was often harassed by Soviet officials as they were vigilant in pursuing public exhibitions of their work. In an attempt to circumvent the law, the Lianozovo group proposed an open-air exhibition in 1974, inviting dozens of other nonconformist artists also to exhibit. The result was the demolition of the exhibition by bulldozers and water cannons, for which reason the exhibition is still known as the [[Bulldozer Exhibition]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/nov/30/russian-painters-traitors-exhibit-london |title=Russian painters denounced as Soviet traitors exhibit in London |last=Alberge |first=Dalya |date=2010-11-30 |website=The Guardian |access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n===Sretensky Boulevard Group===\n[[File:Pered_rasvetom.jpg|thumb|210px|''[[Oleg Vassiliev (painter)|Oleg Vasiliev]], Before the Sunrise, 1964'']]\nA group of artists that had studios on and around [[Sretensky Boulevard]], Moscow, became a loosely associated like-minded community in the late 1960s.

The artists' studios were also used as venues to show and exchange ideas about unofficial art. Like their colleagues in the Lianozovo group, the majority of visual artists who were part of the Sretensky Boulevard Group were admitted to the Moscow Union of Graphic Artists. This allowed the artists to work officially as book illustrators and graphic designers, which provided them with studio space, materials, and time to work on their own projects. Although they shared the same type of official career, the Sretensky group is not stylistically homogeneous. The name merely denotes the community that they formed as a result of working in close proximity to each other.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/viktor_pivovarov_breaking_the_ice.htm |title=Viktor Pivovarov - Artist's Profile - The Saatchi Gallery |website=www.saatchigallery.com |access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>\n\n===Moscow Conceptualists===\n\nMany of the artists on Sretensky Boulevard were part of the [[Moscow Conceptualists|Moscow Conceptualist]] school. This movement arose in the 1970s to describe the identity of the contemporary Russian artist in opposition to the government. As Joseph Bakstein explained, \"The creation of this nonconformist tradition was impelled by the fact that an outsider in the Soviet empire stood alone against a tremendous state machine, a great Leviathan that threatened to engulf him. To preserve one's identity in this situation, one had to create a separate value system, including a system of aesthetic values.\"<ref name=\"Bakshtein, Joseph 1995, p. 332\"/>\n\nErik Bulatov explains that conceptualist art is, \"a rebellion of man against the everyday reality of life... a picture interests me as some kind of system... opening into the space of my everyday existence.\"<ref>Roberts, Norma, ed.

Khrushchev got into a public and now-famous argument with [[Ernst Neizvestny]], sculptor (1925-2016), regarding the function of art in society. However, this altercation had the unintended effect of fomenting unofficial art as a movement. Artists could no longer hold delusions that the state would recognize their art, yet the climate had become friendly and open enough that a coherent organization had formed. Additionally, punishments for unofficial artists became less severe; they were denied admittance to the union instead of being executed.\n\nAs a \"movement\" nonconformist art was stylistically diverse. However, in the post-thaw era its function and role in society became clear. As the Russian curator, author and museum director Joseph Bakstein wrote, <blockquote> The duality of life in which the official perception of everyday reality is independent of the reality of the imagination leads to a situation where art plays a special role in society. In any culture, art is a special reality, but in the Soviet Union, art was doubly real precisely because it had no relation to reality. It was a higher reality.... The goal of nonconformism in art was to challenge the status of official artistic reality, to question it, to treat it with irony. Yet that was the one unacceptable thing. All of Soviet society rested on orthodoxy, and nonconformism was its enemy. That is why even the conditional and partial legalization of nonconformism in the mid-1970s was the beginning of the end of the Soviet regime.<ref name=\"Bakshtein, Joseph 1995, p. 332\">Bakshtein, Joseph. \"A View from Moscow,\" ''Nonconformist Art: The Soviet Experience 1956-1986'', eds.

Artists began experimenting with abstraction, as it was the antithesis of Socialist Realism. However, the fallout from the [[Manezh]] exhibition, in 1962, caused restrictions to be enforced once again. The new restrictions could not however, curtail what the young artists had learned during the five-year interlude. Additionally, [[Victor Tupitsyn]] points out that the 1960s mark an era of \"decommunalization\" in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev worked to improve housing conditions, and a consequence of this was that artists began to get studios of their own, or shared spaces with like-minded colleagues.<ref name=\"Tupitsyn\"/> \n\nOfficially, those in the Lianozovo group were members of the Moscow Union of Graphic Artists, working in the applied and graphic arts. As such, they were not permitted to hold painting exhibitions, as that fell under the domain of the Artists' Union. Consequently, apartment exhibitions and literary salons began at this time as a means of publicly exhibiting. However, the Lianozovo group in particular was often harassed by Soviet officials as they were vigilant in pursuing public exhibitions of their work. In an attempt to circumvent the law, the Lianozovo group proposed an open-air exhibition in 1974, inviting dozens of other nonconformist artists also to exhibit. The result was the demolition of the exhibition by bulldozers and water cannons, for which reason the exhibition is still known as the [[Bulldozer Exhibition]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/nov/30/russian-painters-traitors-exhibit-london |title=Russian painters denounced as Soviet traitors exhibit in London |last=Alberge |first=Dalya |date=2010-11-30 |website=The Guardian |access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n===Sretensky Boulevard Group===\n[[File:Pered_rasvetom.jpg|thumb|210px|''[[Oleg Vassiliev (painter)|Oleg Vasiliev]], Before the Sunrise, 1964'']]\nA group of artists that had studios on and around [[Sretensky Boulevard]], Moscow, became a loosely associated like-minded community in the late 1960s.

This allowed the artists to work officially as book illustrators and graphic designers, which provided them with studio space, materials, and time to work on their own projects. Although they shared the same type of official career, the Sretensky group is not stylistically homogeneous. The name merely denotes the community that they formed as a result of working in close proximity to each other.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/viktor_pivovarov_breaking_the_ice.htm |title=Viktor Pivovarov - Artist's Profile - The Saatchi Gallery |website=www.saatchigallery.com |access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>\n\n===Moscow Conceptualists===\n\nMany of the artists on Sretensky Boulevard were part of the [[Moscow Conceptualists|Moscow Conceptualist]] school. This movement arose in the 1970s to describe the identity of the contemporary Russian artist in opposition to the government. As Joseph Bakstein explained, \"The creation of this nonconformist tradition was impelled by the fact that an outsider in the Soviet empire stood alone against a tremendous state machine, a great Leviathan that threatened to engulf him. To preserve one's identity in this situation, one had to create a separate value system, including a system of aesthetic values.\"<ref name=\"Bakshtein, Joseph 1995, p. 332\"/>\n\nErik Bulatov explains that conceptualist art is, \"a rebellion of man against the everyday reality of life... a picture interests me as some kind of system... opening into the space of my everyday existence.\"<ref>Roberts, Norma, ed.

Starring [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], it follows a woman who goes to [[Jakarta]] to find work after her husband is blinded in an accident. SPFC's first production, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' took two to three months to film and cost almost 130,000 [[Netherlands Indies gulden|gulden]].\n\nThe first [[list of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestically produced]] feature film to be released in five years, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' received favourable reviews, although financially it was outperformed by [[Roestam Sutan Palindih]]'s ''[[Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum]]'' (released soon after). The film's cast remained active in the Indonesian film industry, some for another thirty years, and SPFC produced six more works before closing in 1949. A copy of the film is stored at [[Sinematek Indonesia]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Ratna Asmara, Ali Yugo, and Iscandar Sukarno in Djaoeh di Mata, Peran Pemuda dalam Kebangkitan Film Indonesia, p50.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Ratna Asmara, Ali Joego, and Iscandar Sukarno in a scene from the film]]\nA poor villager, Asrad ([[Ali Joego]]), is blinded following a traffic accident and thus unable to work. As a result, his wife Soelastri ([[Ratna Asmara]]) travels to the capital, [[Jakarta]], to find a job. As Asrad does not trust his wife and fears she may be unfaithful, he writes her a letter telling her to not come back. Soelastri becomes a singer, and&nbsp;\u2013 unknown to Asrad&nbsp;\u2013 soon achieves wide acclaim. Her most popular song, \"Djaoeh Dimata\", receives heavy airplay on the radio and soon becomes one of Asrad's favourites. Ultimately Soelastri is brought home by Soekarto (Iskandar Sucarno), who attempts to pass her off as a maid for Asrad. When Asrad recognises his wife's voice, they are reconciled.<ref>{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djaoeh Dimata}}; {{harvnb|''Het Dagblad'' 1949, 'Djaoeh di Mata'}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe first two years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the [[Dutch East Indies]], with over forty [[List of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestic productions]] released.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=385\u2013387}} Following the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rd Ariffien]]'s ''[[Berdjoang]]'' (''Struggle''; 1943)&nbsp;\u2013 six short films, and several [[newsreel]]s. All were [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|pro-Japanese propaganda]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=339\u2013343}}\n\nAfter the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in August 1945, a number of [[native Indonesian]] employees of Nippon Eigasha formed [[Berita Film Indonesia]], which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly [[proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed]] Indonesian government.{{sfn|Danujaya|Tjasmadi|1992|p=50}} During the ensuing [[Indonesian National Revolution|revolution]], allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of [[newsreels]] at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce [[fictional film]]s. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised in part by the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]], a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=359}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], stars of the film\n\n| image1    = Ratna Asmara p298.JPG\n| alt1      = Ratna Asmara, pictured in 1940\n| width1    = 182\n\n| image2    = Ali Yugo in Djaoeh di Mata.jpg\n| alt2      = Ali Yugo, pictured in 1948\n| width2= 200\n}}\nSPFC hired [[Andjar Asmara]], a former journalist and stagewriter who had been active with [[The Teng Chun]]'s Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct ''Djaoeh Dimata'';{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}} he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|p=247}} However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar was more of an acting and [[dialogue coach]]; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A.

Starring [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], it follows a woman who goes to [[Jakarta]] to find work after her husband is blinded in an accident. SPFC's first production, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' took two to three months to film and cost almost 130,000 [[Netherlands Indies gulden|gulden]].\n\nThe first [[list of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestically produced]] feature film to be released in five years, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' received favourable reviews, although financially it was outperformed by [[Roestam Sutan Palindih]]'s ''[[Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum]]'' (released soon after).

As a result, his wife Soelastri ([[Ratna Asmara]]) travels to the capital, [[Jakarta]], to find a job. As Asrad does not trust his wife and fears she may be unfaithful, he writes her a letter telling her not to return. Soelastri becomes a singer, and&nbsp;\u2013 unknown to Asrad&nbsp;\u2013 soon achieves wide acclaim. Her most popular song, \"Djaoeh Dimata\", receives heavy airplay on the radio and soon becomes one of Asrad's favourites. Ultimately Soelastri is brought home by Soekarto (Iskandar Sucarno), who attempts to pass her off as a maid for Asrad. When Asrad recognises his wife's voice, they are reconciled.<ref>{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djaoeh Dimata}}; {{harvnb|''Het Dagblad'' 1949, 'Djaoeh di Mata'}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe first two years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the [[Dutch East Indies]], with over forty [[List of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestic productions]] released.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=385\u2013387}} Following the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rd Ariffien]]'s ''[[Berdjoang]]'' (''Struggle''; 1943)&nbsp;\u2013 six short films, and several [[newsreel]]s. All were [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|pro-Japanese propaganda]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=339\u2013343}}\n\nAfter the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in August 1945, a number of [[native Indonesian]] employees of Nippon Eigasha formed [[Berita Film Indonesia]], which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly [[proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed]] Indonesian government.{{sfn|Danujaya|Tjasmadi|1992|p=50}} During the ensuing [[Indonesian National Revolution|revolution]], allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of [[newsreels]] at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce [[fictional film]]s. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised in part by the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]], a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=359}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], stars of the film\n\n| image1    = Ratna Asmara p298.JPG\n| alt1      = Ratna Asmara, pictured in 1940\n| width1    = 182\n\n| image2    = Ali Yugo in Djaoeh di Mata.jpg\n| alt2      = Ali Yugo, pictured in 1948\n| width2= 200\n}}\nSPFC hired [[Andjar Asmara]], a former journalist and stagewriter who had been active with [[The Teng Chun]]'s Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct ''Djaoeh Dimata'';{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}} he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|p=247}} However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar was more of an acting and [[dialogue coach]]; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A.

The Borg are [[Cyborg|cybernetic organisms]], linked in a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]] called \"the Collective\". The Borg co-opt the technology and knowledge of [[List of Star Trek races|other alien species]] to the Collective through the process of \"[[#Assimilation|assimilation]]\": forcibly transforming individual beings into \"drones\" by injecting [[nanomachine|nanoprobes]] into their bodies and surgically augmenting them with cybernetic components. The Borg's ultimate goal is \"achieving perfection\".<ref name=\"auto\">Star Trek: First Contact</ref><ref>https://screenrant.com/star-trek-borg-biggest-plot-holes-make-no-sense/</ref> Aside from being recurring antagonists in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Next Generation]]'' television series, they are depicted as the main threat in the film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''. In addition, they played major roles in the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager|Voyager]]'' series and serve as the way home to the [[Alpha Quadrant]] for the isolated Federation [[starship]] [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']].\n\nThe Borg have become a symbol in [[popular culture]] for any [[juggernaut]] against which \"resistance is futile\". Steve will do\n\n==Depiction==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=March 2020}}\nThe Borg are [[cyborgs]], having outward appearances showing both mechanical and biological body parts. Individual Borg are referred to as drones and move in a robotic, purposeful style ignoring most of their environment, including beings they do not consider an immediate threat. Borg commonly have one eye replaced with a sophisticated ocular implant. Borg usually have one arm replaced with a prosthesis, bearing one of a variety of multipurpose tools in place of a humanoid hand. Since different drones have different roles, the arm may be specialized for myriad purposes such as medical devices, scanners, and weapons. Borg have flat, white skin, giving them an almost [[zombie]]-like appearance.\n\nSome Borg have been shown to be far stronger than humans, able to easily overpower most humans and similar species. Typical Borg have never been seen to run, instead moving in a deliberate fashion, never retreating.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Borg are highly resistant to energy-based weapons, having personal shielding that quickly adapts to them. In various episodes, phasers and other [[directed energy weapon]]s tend to quickly become ineffective as the Borg are able to adapt to the specific frequencies on which these weapons are projected once a ship or an individual drone is struck down by them. Later attempts to [[modulation|modulate]] phaser and other weapon frequencies have had limited success. Borg shields have, however, proven to be ineffective protection against projectile or melee weapons, but this could prove problematic, given that in space travel, puncturing the hull with an errant shot could have catastrophic consequences.\n\nBorg possess a \"cortical node\" that controls other implanted cybernetic devices within a Borg's body; it is most often implanted in the forehead above the organic eye. If the cortical node fails, the Borg eventually dies. Successful replacement of the node can be carried out on a Borg vessel.\n\n===Borg Collective===\n[[File:Borg dockingstation.jpg|thumb|An occupied Borg \"alcove\" prop on display at the Hollywood Entertainment Museum]]\nBorg civilization is based on a hive or [[Group mind (science fiction)|group mind]] known as the Collective. Each Borg drone is linked to the collective by a sophisticated [[Subspace (Star Trek)#Subspace|subspace]] network that ensures each member is given constant supervision and guidance. The mental energy of the group consciousness can help an injured or damaged drone heal or regenerate damaged body parts or technology. The collective consciousness not only gives them the ability to \"share the same thoughts\", but also to adapt with great speed to tactics used against them.<ref>\"The Best of Both Worlds, Parts I and II\" (''Stara Trek: The Next Generation'')</ref> Drones in the Collective are never seen speaking, but a collective \"voice\" is sometimes transmitted to ships.\n\n===\"Resistance is futile\"===\nIndividual Borg rarely speak, though they do send a collective audio message to their targets, stating that \"resistance is futile\", generally followed by a declaration that the target in question will be [[#Assimilation|assimilated]] and its \"biological and technological distinctiveness\" will be added to their own. The exact phrasing varies and evolves over the various series episodes and film.\n\nThe complete phrase used in ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' is: {{cquote|We are the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.<ref>[http://www.moviesoundclips.net/sound.php?id=148 ''Star Trek - First Contact'' (1996)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929181255/http://www.moviesoundclips.net/sound.php?id=148 |date=September 29, 2013 }} Moviesoundclips.net. Rikeromega3 Productions 1999-2013. Retrieved September 26, 2013.</ref>}}\n\n===Nanoprobes===\nNanoprobes are [[Nanorobotics|microscopic machines]] that inhabit a Borg's body, bloodstream, and many cybernetic implants. The probes maintain the Borg cybernetic systems and repair damage to the organic parts of a Borg. They generate new technology inside a Borg when needed and protect them from many forms of disease. Borg nanoprobes, each about the size of a human [[red blood cell]], travel through the victim's bloodstream and attach to individual [[cell (biology)|cells]]. The nanoprobes rewrite the cellular [[DNA]], altering the victim's biochemistry, and eventually form larger, more complicated structures and networks within the body, like electrical pathways, processing and data-storage nodes, and ultimately prosthetic devices that spring forth from the skin. In \"[[Mortal Coil (Star Trek: Voyager)|Mortal Coil]]\", Seven of Nine states that the Borg assimilated the nanoprobe technology from \"Species 149\". In addition, the nanoprobes maintain and repair their host's mechanical and biological components on a microscopic level, imparting regenerative capabilities.\n\nThough used by the Borg to exert control over another being, reprogrammed nanoprobes were used by the crew of the starship ''Voyager'' in many instances as medical aids.\n\nThe capability of nanoprobes to absorb improved technologies they find into the Borg collective is shown in the ''Voyager'' episode \"[[Drone (Star Trek: Voyager)|Drone]]\", where [[Seven of Nine]]'s nanoprobes are fused with the Doctor's mobile emitter that uses technology from the 29th century, creating a 29th-century drone existing outside the Collective, with capabilities far surpassing that of the 24th-century drones.\n\nThe Borg do not try to immediately assimilate any being with which they come into contact; Borg drones tend to completely ignore individuals that are identified as too weak to be an imminent threat or too inferior to be worth assimilating. Captain Picard and his team walk safely past a group of Borg drones in a scene from the film ''Star Trek: First Contact'' while the drones fulfill a programmed mission. In the ''Star Trek: Voyager'' episode \"[[Mortal Coil (Star Trek: Voyager)|Mortal Coil]]\",  Seven of Nine told Neelix that the Kazon were \"unworthy\" of assimilation and would serve only to detract from the Borg's quest for perceived perfection.\n\n===Travel===\nThe Borg are a [[spacefaring]] race, and their primary interstellar transport is known as a \"'''Borg Cube'''\"<!-- bolded per [[WP:MOSBOLD]] as a redirect target --> due to its shape. A cube was first seen in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Next Generation]]'' episode \"[[Q Who? (TNG episode)|Q Who?]]\" set in 2365. Common capabilities of cubes include high speed [[Warp drive|warp]] and [[Warp drive#transwarp|transwarp]] [[Spacecraft propulsion|drives]], self-regeneration and multiple-redundant systems, [[adaptation|adaptability]] in combat, and various [[directed-energy weapon|energy]] weapons as well as [[tractor beam]]s and cutting beams. Additionally, different types and size of Cubes have been observed as well as Borg Spheres and some smaller craft.<ref>http://www.startrek.com/database_article/borg-cube</ref>\n\nAs with most other ''Star Trek'' races, the Borg also have [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] capability.\n\n===Assimilation===\n'''Assimilation''' is the process by which the Borg integrate beings, cultures, and technology into the Collective. \"You will be assimilated\" is one of the few on-screen phrases employed by the Borg when communicating with other species. The Borg are portrayed as having found and assimilated thousands of species and billions to trillions of individual life-forms throughout the [[galaxy]]. The Borg designate each species with a number assigned to them upon [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]], humanity being 'Species 5618'.\n\nWhen first introduced, the Borg are said to be more interested in assimilating technology than people, roaming the universe as single-minded marauders that have assimilated starships, planets, and entire societies to collect new technology. They are discriminating in this area, finding certain races, for example the [[Kazon]], to be technologically inferior and unworthy of assimilation. A Borg infant found aboard a Borg Cube in \"Q Who?\" shows that the Borg will assimilate even children. The Borg then place the assimilated children into maturation chambers to quickly and fully grow them into mature drones.\n\n[[File:Picard as Locutus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Patrick Stewart]] as Locutus of Borg, the assimilated [[Jean-Luc Picard]]]]\nIn their second appearance, \"[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]\", they capture and assimilate Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] into the Collective, creating Locutus of Borg (meaning \"he who has spoken\", in Latin).\n\nThe method of assimilating individual life-forms into the Collective has been represented differently over time. When we see the Borg in ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', assimilation is through abduction and then surgical procedure. In ''Star Trek: First Contact'' and ''Star Trek: Voyager'', assimilation is through injection of [[Nanorobotics|nanoprobes]] into an individual's [[Circulatory system|bloodstream]] via a pair of tubules that spring forth from a drone's hand. Assimilation by tubules is depicted on-screen as being a fast-acting process, with the victim's skin pigmentation turning gray and mottled with visible dark tracks forming within moments of contact. After assimilation, a drone's race and gender become \"irrelevant\". After initial assimilation through injection, Borg are surgically fitted with cybernetic devices. In ''Star Trek: First Contact'' an assimilated crew member is shown to have a forearm and an eye physically removed and replaced with cybernetic implants.\n\nThe Borg also assimilate, interface, and reconfigure technology using these tubules and nanoprobes. However, in ''Q Who?'' we see a Borg apparently trying to assimilate, probe, or reconfigure a control panel in engineering using an energy interface instead of nanoprobes.\n\nSome species, for various stated reasons, are able to resist assimilation by nanoprobes. [[Species 8472]] is the only race shown to be capable of completely rejecting assimilation attempts. Other species, such as the [[Hirogen]], have demonstrated resistance to assimilation as well as [[Phlox (Star Trek)|Dr Phlox]], who was able to partially resist the assimilation process in the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode \"[[Regeneration (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Regeneration]]\".<ref>''Star Trek: Voyager'', season 3 episode 26 and Season 4 Episode 1 (Scorpion Parts 1 & 2)</ref>\n\n==Concept==\nThe Borg represented a new antagonist and regular enemy that was lacking during the first season of ''TNG''; the [[Klingon]]s were allies and the [[Romulan]]s mostly absent. The [[Ferengi]] were originally intended as the new enemy for the United Federation of Planets, but their comical appearance and devotion to [[Capitalism|capitalist]] accumulation by [[free enterprise]] failed to portray them as a convincing threat. The Borg, however, with their frightening appearance, their immense power, and their sinister motive, became the signature villains for the ''TNG'' and ''Voyager'' eras of ''Star Trek''. In ''Voyager'' episode \"[[Q2 (Star Trek: Voyager)|Q2]]\", even Q tells his son, \"Don't provoke the Borg.\"\n\n''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' (''TNG'') writers began to develop the idea of the Borg as early as the Season 1 episode, \"[[Conspiracy (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Conspiracy]]\", which introduced a coercive, [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] life form that took over key Federation personnel. Plans to feature the Borg as an increasingly menacing threat were subsequently scrapped in favor of a more subtle introduction, beginning with the mystery of missing colonies on both sides of the Neutral Zone in \"[[The Neutral Zone (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Neutral Zone]]\" and culminating in the encounter between Borg and the ''Enterprise'' crew in \"[[Q Who?]]\".<ref>text commentary by Michael Okuda in the collector's edition of Star Trek: First Contact</ref>\n\n==Borg Queen==<!-- This section is linked from [[Data (Star Trek)]] -->\n[[File:Borg Queen 2372.jpg|thumb|[[Alice Krige]] as the Borg Queen in ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''.]]\nBefore the film ''Star Trek: First Contact'' (1996), the Borg exhibited no hierarchical command structure. ''First Contact'' introduced the Borg Queen, who is not named as such in the film (referring to herself with \"I am the Borg. I am the Collective.\") but is named Borg Queen in the closing credits. The Queen is played by [[Alice Krige]] in this film and in the 2001 finale of ''Star Trek: Voyager'', \"[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]\". The character also appeared in Voyager's two-part episodes \"[[Dark Frontier (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dark Frontier]]\" (1999) and \"[[Unimatrix Zero (Star Trek: Voyager)|Unimatrix Zero]]\" (2000), but was portrayed by [[Susanna Thompson]].<ref>https://www.trektoday.com/news/150500_03.shtml</ref> Whether or not these appearances represent the same queen is never confirmed. The queen was killed in both ''First Contact'' and \"Dark Frontier\", so there may be a total of three queens throughout the series. In ''First Contact'', the Borg Queen is heard during a flashback of Picard's former assimilation, implying that she was present during the events of \"Best of Both Worlds\".\n\nThe Borg Queen is the focal point within the Borg collective consciousness and a unique drone within the Collective, who brings \"order to chaos\", referring to herself as \"we\" and \"I\" interchangeably. In ''First Contact'', the Queen's dialogue suggests she is an expression of the Borg Collective's overall intelligence, not a controller but the avatar of the entire Collective as an individual. This sentiment is contradicted by ''Star Trek: Voyager'', where she is seen explicitly directing, commanding, and in one instance even overriding the Collective. The introduction of the Queen radically changed the canonical understanding of the Borg function, with the authors of ''The Computers of Star Trek'' noting \"It was a lot easier for viewers to focus on a villain rather than a hive-mind that made decisions based on the input of all its members.\"<ref>Lois H. Gresh & Robert Weinberg, ''The Computers of Star Trek''. New York: Basic Books (1999): 147. \"It was a lot easier for viewers to focus on a villain rather than a hive-mind that made decisions based on the input of all its members.\"</ref>  ''First Contact'' writers [[Brannon Braga]] and [[Ronald D. Moore]] have defended the introduction of the Queen as a dramatic necessity, noting on the film's DVD audio commentary that they had initially written the film with drones, but then found that it was essential for the main characters to have someone to interact with beyond mindless drones.\n\n==Borg appearances==\nThe Borg were introduced on syndicated television on May 8, 1989, in the ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' episode \"Q Who?\", and rose to further prominence in the famous two part [[cliffhanger]] \"Best of Both Worlds, Part I\",<ref>[https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/star-trek-tng/32076/revisiting-star-trek-tng-best-of-both-worlds]</ref> which aired on June 18, 1990, with the sequel airing on September 24, 1990. In the ''Star Trek'' in-universe timeline, the earliest the Borg have been displayed is in 1996's ''Star Trek: First Contact''.\n\nOverall Borg aliens appear in a total of about 100 episodes of various incarnations of ''Star Trek''. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/star-trek-picard-essential-borg-episodes|title=The Best of Borg worlds: The 7 essential Borg episodes to watch before Star Trek: Picard|last=Britt|first=Ryan|date=2020-01-20|website=SYFY WIRE|language=en|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref> However, this is only by counting all the episodes which include the ex-borg character Seven of Nine.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Borg appear in just six episodes of ''Star Trek The Next Generation'' and 23 major appearances in ''Star Trek: Voyager''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===''The Next Generation''===\nThe Borg first appear in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' second-season episode \"[[Q Who?]]\", when the omnipotent life-form [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] hurls the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise''-D]] across the galaxy to challenge [[Jean-Luc Picard]]'s assertion that his crew is ready to face the galaxy's dangers and mysteries. The ''Enterprise'' crew is overwhelmed by the Borg, and Picard begs for and receives Q's help in returning the ship to its previous coordinates.\n\nThe Borg next appear in ''The Next Generation''{{'}}s third-season finale and fourth-season premiere, \"[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]\". Picard is abducted and assimilated by the Borg and transformed into [[Jean-Luc Picard|Locutus]], the Latin for \"he who speaks\". Picard's knowledge of Starfleet's strengths and strategies is gained by the Collective, and the single cube destroys the entire Starfleet armada at [[Battle of Wolf 359|Wolf 359]]. The ''Enterprise'' crew manages to capture Locutus, gain information through him that allows them to destroy the cube, and then reverse the assimilation process.\n\nIn the fifth-season episode \"[[I, Borg]]\", the ''Enterprise'' crew rescues an adolescent Borg they name \"[[List of Star Trek characters (G\u2013M)#H|Hugh]]\". The crew faces the moral decision of whether or not to use Hugh (who begins to develop a sense of independence as a result of a severed link to the Collective) as a means of delivering a devastating computer virus to the Borg, or return to the Borg with his individuality intact.<ref name=\"TNGcompanion\">{{cite book|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|author=Nemeck, Larry|isbn=0-7434-5798-6}}</ref> They decide to return him without the virus, but in the sixth-season episode \"[[Descent (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Descent]]\", a group of rogue Borg who had \"assimilated\" individuality through Hugh fall under the control of the android [[Lore (Star Trek)|Lore]], the \"older brother\" of Data. Lore also corrupts Data through the use of an \"emotion chip\", simultaneously deactivating Data's ethical subroutines and only projecting negative emotions to it. Under this programming, Data participates in the capture of Picard, La Forge and Troi, but they are able to reactivate Data's ethical subroutines, allowing him to recognize that his current actions are wrong and leading to him deactivating Lore. Data recovers the emotion chip and the surviving Borg fall under the leadership of Hugh.\n\nIn 2017, SYFY listed \"I, Borg\" among the 25 best science fiction episodes of the last 25 years.<ref>[https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/the-25-greatest-stand-alone-episodes-of-sci-fi-tv-of-the-past-25-years]</ref>\n\n===''First Contact''===\nThe Borg return as the antagonists in the ''Next Generation'' film, ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''. After again failing to assimilate Earth by a direct assault in the year 2373, the Borg travel back in time to the year 2063 to try to stop [[Zefram Cochrane]]'s first contact with the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]], change the timeline, and erase Starfleet from existence. The [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|''Enterprise''-E]] crew follows the Borg back in time and restores the original timeline. ''First Contact'' introduces the [[#Borg Queen|Borg Queen]] as played by  Alice Krige, who later reprised the role on United Paramount Network for the finale of ''Star Trek: Voyager''.\n\n===''Deep Space Nine''===\nThere is only one episode with Borg in ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' in the premiere episode ''[[Emissary (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Emissary]]''<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Benjamin Sisko]] ([[Avery Brooks]]) was an officer on the USS ''Saratoga'', one of the ships in the Starfleet armada dispatched to confront the Borg at Wolf 359. The ''Saratoga'' is destroyed by the Borg, killing Sisko's wife, Jennifer. During that episode, Sisko's meeting with Picard is tense as he blames Picard for the actions of Locutus. Throughout the remainder of the series, references to the Borg are made occasionally, including the design of their ship, [[USS Defiant|USS ''Defiant'']], and the battle from ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' being used as a plot point in Season 5 when Starfleet is spread too thin to deal with a Dominion incursion.\n\n===''Voyager''===\nThe Borg make frequent appearances in ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', which takes place in the Delta Quadrant. The Borg are first seen by ''Voyager'' in the third-season episode \"[[Unity (Star Trek: Voyager)|Unity]]\" in which [[Chakotay]] discovers the body of what the local humanoids refer to as \"the Invaders\"; which turns out to be the Borg. In \"[[Scorpion (Star Trek: Voyager)|Scorpion]]\", the Borg are engaged in a war of attrition against [[Species 8472]], whose biological defences are a match for the Borg's nanoprobes. In one of the few instances of the Borg negotiating, in exchange for safe passage through Borg space, the ''Voyager'' crew devises a way to destroy the otherwise invulnerable Species 8472. A Borg drone, [[Seven of Nine]], is dispatched to ''Voyager'' to facilitate this arrangement. After successfully driving Species 8472 back into their fluidic space, Seven of Nine is severed from the Collective and becomes a member of ''Voyager''{{'}}s crew. Seven of Nine's rediscovery of her individuality becomes a recurring theme throughout the series.\n\n''The Hollywood Reporter'' ranked \"Scorpion\" as the 4th best episode of ''Voyager'' in 2016,<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/star-trek-voyager-episodes-best-930900/item/worst-case-scenario-star-trek-925117 'Star Trek: Voyager' \u2014 The 15 Greatest Episodes].

The Borg play a peripheral role in \"[[Infinite Regress (Star Trek: Voyager)|Infinite Regress]]\", when Seven of Nine is exposed to a weapon against the Borg that essentially causes her to suffer from [[Dissociative identity disorder|MPD]], reverting to the personas of various people she assimilated while in the Collective. In \"[[Dark Frontier (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dark Frontier]]\", ''Voyager'' steals and uses a transwarp coil to both rescue Seven of Nine from the Borg Queen and then knock another fifteen years off their journey home before the coil burns out.\n\nIn the sixth season episode, \"[[Collective (Star Trek: Voyager)|Collective]]\", the crew of ''Voyager'' encounter a damaged cube that is holding Tom Paris, Neelix, Harry Kim and Chakotay hostage. With all the adult drones dead, the ship is run by five Borg children who are saved by ''Voyager'' and deassimilated. The later episode \"Child's Play\" reveals that the cube was infected by a pathogen that Icheb, one of the children, had been engineered to act as a host for by his parents, but the crew rescue Icheb before he can be sent back to the Borg. The crew encounter the Borg again in \"[[Unimatrix Zero]]\", a two-part cliffhanger between seasons six and seven.\n\nIn the seventh season we see the Borg in \"[[Q2 (Star Trek: Voyager)|Q2]]\", where Q's son brings Borg onto ''Voyager'', in \"[[Shattered (Star Trek: Voyager)|Shattered]]\", where the events depicted in \"Scorpion\" are revisited and in the series finale, \"[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]\", in which [[Admiral Janeway]] from the future tries to bring ''Voyager'' back to Earth using a Borg transwarp hub. During this episode, Janeway infects the Borg with a [[Cordotomy|neurolytic]] pathogen that infects the collective and kills the Queen.\n\nThere are 26 major episodes featuring the Borg in Voyager, however there are about 100 if counting those with Seven of Nine.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===''Enterprise''===\nIn the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode \"[[Regeneration (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Regeneration]]\", the remnants of the destroyed sphere from ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' are discovered in the [[Arctic]] along with two frozen drones. The Borg steal a research ship and send a transmission toward the Delta Quadrant before they are destroyed, creating a perpetual time loop/predestination paradox.\n\n===''Discovery''===\nThough the Borg do not appear, in the ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' episode \"Perpetual Infinity\", Captain Leland of Section 31 is infected with nanites by the time-traveling rogue artificial intelligence known as Control. Leland displays characteristics similar to Borg drones, including black veins and a heightened ability to adapt in combat, leading some fans to speculate that Control is connected to the origin of the Borg or reverse engineered from recovered Borg tech. In addition, the Borg are known for their possession of [[Warp drive#Transwarp|transwarp]] technology, which allows them to travel to any section of the galaxy in an instant. Some fans suggest the technology may have been derived from ''Discovery''{{'}}s spore drive though there is no evidence to support this as of yet.\n\nThese theories are not confirmed as a Borg origin story in any episodes to date.<ref>https://screenrant.com/star-trek-discovery-control-borg-origin-theory/</ref><ref>https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/star-trek-discovery-the-borg-origin-story-retcon.html</ref>\n\n=== ''Picard'' ===\nThis series' first season includes four recovering ex-Borg characters: Picard, Seven of Nine, Hugh, (featured in \"I, Borg\" and \"Descent\")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etonline.com/star-trek-picard-what-you-need-to-know-before-diving-into-the-cbs-all-access-series-140094|title='Star Trek: Picard': The Complete Guide to the CBS All Access Series|website=Entertainment Tonight|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> and Icheb.\n\n==Origin==\nThe origin of the Borg is never made clear, though they are portrayed as having existed for hundreds of thousands of years (as attested by [[Guinan (Star Trek)|Guinan]] and the Borg Queen). In ''Star Trek: First Contact'', the Borg Queen merely states that the Borg were once much like humanity, \"flawed and weak\", but gradually developed into a partially synthetic species in an ongoing attempt to evolve and perfect themselves.\n\nIn ''TNG''{{'}}s \"Q Who?\", Guinan mentions that the Borg are \"made up of organic and artificial life [...] which has been developing for [...] thousands of centuries.\" In the later episode of ''Star Trek: Voyager'', \"[[Dragon's Teeth (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dragon's Teeth]]\", Gedrin, of the race the Vaadwaur, says that before he and his people were put into suspended animation 892 years earlier (1482 A.D.), the Borg had assimilated only a few colonies in the Delta Quadrant and were considered essentially a minor nuisance. Now awake in the 24th century, he is amazed to see that the Borg control a vast area of the Delta Quadrant. [[Seven of Nine]] comments that the Borg's collective memories of that time period are fragmentary, though it is never established why that is.\n\n===Non-canon origin stories===\n''[[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]'' speculates that a connection could exist between the Borg and ''[[V'ger]]'', the vessel encountered in ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. This idea of a connection is advanced in [[William Shatner]]'s novel ''The Return''. The connection was also suggested in a letter included in ''[[Starlog]]'' no. 160 (November 1990). The letter writer, Christopher Haviland, also speculated that the original Borg drones were members of a race called \"the Preservers\", which [[Spock]] had suggested in the [[Star Trek Original Series|original series]] episode \"[[The Paradise Syndrome]]\" might be responsible for why so many humanoids populate the galaxy. It was confirmed in the ''TNG'' episode \"[[The Chase (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Chase]]\" that an ancient species seeded hundreds, if not thousands of planets with their DNA, creating the Humans, Vulcans, (and Romulans as they are a  Vulcan offshoot race) Cardassians and others.\n\nThe extra section of the game ''[[Star Trek: Legacy]]'' contains the supposed \"Origin of the Borg\", which tells the story of ''V'ger'' being sucked into a [[black hole]]. ''V'ger'' was found by a race of living machines that gave it a form suitable to fulfilling its simplistic programming. Unable to determine who its creator could be, the probe declared all [[carbon-based life]] an infestation of the creator's universe, leading to assimilation. From this, the Borg were created, as extensions of ''V'ger''{{'}}s purpose. Drones were made from those assimilated and merged into a collective [[consciousness]]. The Borg Queen was created out of the necessity for a single unifying voice. With thoughts and desires of her own, she was no longer bound to serve ''V'ger''.\n\nIn the graphic novel ''Star Trek: The Manga'', the Borg resulted from an experiment in medical nanotechnology gone wrong. An alien species under threat of extinction by an incurable disease created a repository [[satellite]] containing test subjects infused with body parts, organs, and [[DNA]] of multiple species along with cybernetic enhancements put in place by advanced medical technology. The satellite was maintained by nanomachines, which also maintained the medical equipment on board. The medical facility is parked in orbit by a black hole, and along with the [[Theory of Relativity|relativistic]] state of time around the black hole, allows long-term research to continue at an accelerated time scale rather than in real-time speed. As the medical facility deteriorates, so does the programming of the nanomachines. The nanomachines began infusing themselves into the patients, interpreting them as part of the satellite in need of repair. Among the patients is the daughter of the head medical researcher of the satellite. The satellite eventually falls apart in an encounter with an away team from the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' under the command of [[James T. Kirk]]. In the final moments of the satellite's destruction and the escape of the crew members of the ''Enterprise'' with the patients, the subjects display qualities inherently resembling the Borg: injection of nanomachines in a fashion similar to assimilation, rapid adaptation to weaponry, and a hive mind consciousness, as all the subjects begin following the whim of the daughter. As succumbing to the disease was inevitable, and the corrupt nanomachine programming infused itself into the bodies, the final image of the page of the [[manga]] Borg origin is left with the daughter turned Borg Queen, stating, \"Resistance is futile.\"\n\nIn the novel ''Lost Souls'' (the third book in the ''[[Star Trek: Destiny]]'' trilogy), the Borg are revealed to be the survivors of the Caeliar city Mantilis. Thrown across the galaxy in the [[Galactic quadrant#Delta Quadrant|Delta Quadrant]] and back in time to about 4500 BC by the destruction of Erigol at the climax of ''Gods of Night'', the first book in the trilogy, a group of human survivors from the starship ''Columbia'' [[Home (Star Trek: Enterprise)|(NX-02)]] and Caeliar scientists try to survive in a harsh arctic climate. Most of the human survivors die of exposure, while several Caeliar are absorbed into their race's gestalt to give life to the others in their group mind. The Caeliar offer the remaining humans a merging of human and Caeliar, to allow both groups to survive. The human survivors are resistant and as time goes on, the Caeliar called Sedin becomes the sole survivor of her group, her mental processes and her form both degrading as time goes on. When the humans return to Sedin for help, she forces them to merge with her, unwilling to allow herself to die when a union can save her life. The forced merging of the humans and the mostly decayed Caeliar results in the creation of the first Borg. The gestalt group mind is perverted to become the collective, driven by Sedin's desperate hunger and need to add the strength, technology, and life-force of others to her own. Ironically, while the Caeliar were\u2013albeit accidentally\u2013involved in the creation of the Borg, they also provide the means to end it; in the 24th century, the Caeliar absorb the entire Borg collective back into themselves, ending the cyborgs' centuries-long reign of terror.\n\n==Other non-canon media appearances==\nIn the ''Star Trek'' novel ''Probe'', which takes place following the events of ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'', the Borg are mentioned obliquely in communication with the whale-probe as spacefaring \"mites\" (the whale-probe's term for humanoid races) who traveled in cubical and spherical spacefaring vessels; the Borg apparently attacked the whale-probe and damaged its memory in some fashion before the events of the film.\n\nIn the ''Star Trek'' game ''[[Star Trek: Legacy]]'', the Borg are featured prominently throughout the ''Enterprise'' and ''TOS'' era's before becoming a major threat in the ''TNG'' era. In unlockable motion-comics that are unlocked after completing each era, it is revealed that the Vulcan T'Uerell experimented on Borg corpses left behind from the ''Enterprise'' episode \"Regeneration\", and became assimilated. It was not until the end of the ''TOS'' era that she made contact with the main Borg force and became a queen before she was finally killed in a fleet of Starfleet, Romulan, and Klingon ships led by Picard.\n\nThe [[Peter David]] novel ''Vendetta'' reveals that the planet killer weapon from the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Original Series]]'' episode \"[[The Doomsday Machine (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Doomsday Machine]]\" is a prototype for a weapon against the Borg. David revisited this concept in a 2007 sequel novel, ''Before Dishonor'', which features the ''Enterprise''-E working with Spock and Seven of Nine to reactivate the original planet killer to stop the Borg.\n\nIn [[William Shatner]]'s novel ''[[The Return (Shatner novel)|The Return]]'', [[Spock]] is nearly assimilated by the Borg, but is saved because he mind-melded with [[V'ger]], an earlier form of the Borg, and they assume that he is already a Borg. Using the information he subconsciously acquired in the meld, Spock is able to lead a crew of ''Enterprise'' officers (consisting of the ''Enterprise''-D crew, himself, Admiral McCoy, and the resurrected Kirk) in a ''Defiant''-class ship to destroy the Borg central node, severing all branches of the Collective from each other and limiting their future threat.\n\nIn David Mack's novel trilogy ''[[Star Trek: Destiny]]'', set over a year after ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'', the Borg stage a massive invasion of local space. Due to Kathryn Janeway crippling their infrastructure in \"[[Endgame (Star Trek)|Endgame]]\", the Borg fear for their survival and attempt to exterminate the Federation and its neighbors. They destroy the populations of numerous Federation worlds. The crews of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|''Enterprise''-E]], the ''[[Star Trek: Titan|Titan]]'', and the ''Aventine'' make contact with the Caeliar, the advanced species that created the Borg, and enlist their aid to end the Borg threat once and for all.\n\nIn the ''[[Doctor Who]]''/''Star Trek'' crossover comic, [[Star Trek: The Next Generation/Doctor Who: Assimilation2|''Assimilation2'']], the Borg join forces with the [[Cybermen]]. When the Cybermen subvert the Collective, the ''Enterprise''-D crew work with the [[Eleventh Doctor|Eleventh]] [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]] and the Borg, restoring the Borg to full strength and erasing the Borg/Cyberman alliance from existence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.whoviannet.co.uk/2012/02/doctor-who-star-trek-crossover-comic-revealed/|title=Doctor Who, Star Trek crossover comic revealed \u2022 Doctor Who News \u2022 WhovianNet|work=whoviannet.co.uk|access-date=March 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408180000/http://news.whoviannet.co.uk/2012/02/doctor-who-star-trek-crossover-comic-revealed/|archive-date=April 8, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nWriters [[Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens]] developed an unproduced idea for an episode that would have featured [[Alice Krige]] as a [[Starfleet]] medical technician who encounters the Borg and is assimilated \u2013 thereby becoming the Borg Queen.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://trekmovie.com/2007/09/22/interview-gar-judy-reeves-stevens-talk-mars-and-enterprise/ | title=Interview: Reeves-Stevenses Talk Mars and Enterprise | work=Trekmovie.com | date=September 22, 2007 | accessdate=21 August 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113121646/http://trekmovie.com/2007/09/22/interview-gar-judy-reeves-stevens-talk-mars-and-enterprise/ | archive-date=January 13, 2010 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the video game ''[[Star Trek: Armada]]'', the Borg invades a [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] cloning facility to create a clone of [[Jean-Luc Picard]] to create a new [[Locutus of Borg|Locutus]].\n\n===In video games===\nThe Borg appear as antagonists to the player in the following ''Star Trek'' video game titles:\n* ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation: Birth of the Federation]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: A Final Unity]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Armada]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Armada II]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Away Team]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Borg]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Voyager \u2013 Elite Force]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Elite Force II]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Command III]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Encounters]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Invasion]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Legacy]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Conquest]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek Online]]''\n* ''Star Trek: Borg Contact''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Bridge Crew]]''\n\nIn March of 2001, Activision announced a game called ''[[Star Trek: Borg Assimilator]]'', in which the player would play a Borg.

The Borg's ultimate goal is \"achieving perfection\".<ref name=\"auto\">Star Trek: First Contact</ref><ref>https://screenrant.com/star-trek-borg-biggest-plot-holes-make-no-sense/</ref> Aside from being recurring antagonists in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Next Generation]]'' television series, they are depicted as the main threat in the film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''. In addition, they played major roles in the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager|Voyager]]'' series and serve as the way home to the [[Alpha Quadrant]] for the isolated Federation [[starship]] [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']].\n\nThe Borg have become a symbol in [[popular culture]] for any [[juggernaut]] against which \"resistance is futile\".\n\n==Depiction==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=March 2020}}\nThe Borg are [[cyborgs]], having outward appearances showing both mechanical and biological body parts. Individual Borg are referred to as drones and move in a robotic, purposeful style ignoring most of their environment, including beings they do not consider an immediate threat. Borg commonly have one eye replaced with a sophisticated ocular implant. Borg usually have one arm replaced with a prosthesis, bearing one of a variety of multipurpose tools in place of a humanoid hand. Since different drones have different roles, the arm may be specialized for myriad purposes such as medical devices, scanners, and weapons. Borg have flat, white skin, giving them an almost [[zombie]]-like appearance.\n\nSome Borg have been shown to be far stronger than humans, able to easily overpower most humans and similar species. Typical Borg have never been seen to run, instead moving in a deliberate fashion, never retreating.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Borg are highly resistant to energy-based weapons, having personal shielding that quickly adapts to them. In various episodes, phasers and other [[directed energy weapon]]s tend to quickly become ineffective as the Borg are able to adapt to the specific frequencies on which these weapons are projected once a ship or an individual drone is struck down by them. Later attempts to [[modulation|modulate]] phaser and other weapon frequencies have had limited success. Borg shields have, however, proven to be ineffective protection against projectile or melee weapons, but this could prove problematic, given that in space travel, puncturing the hull with an errant shot could have catastrophic consequences.\n\nBorg possess a \"cortical node\" that controls other implanted cybernetic devices within a Borg's body; it is most often implanted in the forehead above the organic eye. If the cortical node fails, the Borg eventually dies. Successful replacement of the node can be carried out on a Borg vessel.\n\n===Borg Collective===\n[[File:Borg dockingstation.jpg|thumb|An occupied Borg \"alcove\" prop on display at the Hollywood Entertainment Museum]]\nBorg civilization is based on a hive or [[Group mind (science fiction)|group mind]] known as the Collective. Each Borg drone is linked to the collective by a sophisticated [[Subspace (Star Trek)#Subspace|subspace]] network that ensures each member is given constant supervision and guidance. The mental energy of the group consciousness can help an injured or damaged drone heal or regenerate damaged body parts or technology. The collective consciousness not only gives them the ability to \"share the same thoughts\", but also to adapt with great speed to tactics used against them.<ref>\"The Best of Both Worlds, Parts I and II\" (''Stara Trek: The Next Generation'')</ref> Drones in the Collective are never seen speaking, but a collective \"voice\" is sometimes transmitted to ships.\n\n===\"Resistance is futile\"===\nIndividual Borg rarely speak, though they do send a collective audio message to their targets, stating that \"resistance is futile\", generally followed by a declaration that the target in question will be [[#Assimilation|assimilated]] and its \"biological and technological distinctiveness\" will be added to their own. The exact phrasing varies and evolves over the various series episodes and film.\n\nThe complete phrase used in ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' is: {{cquote|We are the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.<ref>[http://www.moviesoundclips.net/sound.php?id=148 ''Star Trek - First Contact'' (1996)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929181255/http://www.moviesoundclips.net/sound.php?id=148 |date=September 29, 2013 }} Moviesoundclips.net. Rikeromega3 Productions 1999-2013. Retrieved September 26, 2013.</ref>}}\n\n===Nanoprobes===\nNanoprobes are [[Nanorobotics|microscopic machines]] that inhabit a Borg's body, bloodstream, and many cybernetic implants. The probes maintain the Borg cybernetic systems and repair damage to the organic parts of a Borg. They generate new technology inside a Borg when needed and protect them from many forms of disease. Borg nanoprobes, each about the size of a human [[red blood cell]], travel through the victim's bloodstream and attach to individual [[cell (biology)|cells]]. The nanoprobes rewrite the cellular [[DNA]], altering the victim's biochemistry, and eventually form larger, more complicated structures and networks within the body, like electrical pathways, processing and data-storage nodes, and ultimately prosthetic devices that spring forth from the skin. In \"[[Mortal Coil (Star Trek: Voyager)|Mortal Coil]]\", Seven of Nine states that the Borg assimilated the nanoprobe technology from \"Species 149\". In addition, the nanoprobes maintain and repair their host's mechanical and biological components on a microscopic level, imparting regenerative capabilities.\n\nThough used by the Borg to exert control over another being, reprogrammed nanoprobes were used by the crew of the starship ''Voyager'' in many instances as medical aids.\n\nThe capability of nanoprobes to absorb improved technologies they find into the Borg collective is shown in the ''Voyager'' episode \"[[Drone (Star Trek: Voyager)|Drone]]\", where [[Seven of Nine]]'s nanoprobes are fused with the Doctor's mobile emitter that uses technology from the 29th century, creating a 29th-century drone existing outside the Collective, with capabilities far surpassing that of the 24th-century drones.\n\nThe Borg do not try to immediately assimilate any being with which they come into contact; Borg drones tend to completely ignore individuals that are identified as too weak to be an imminent threat or too inferior to be worth assimilating. Captain Picard and his team walk safely past a group of Borg drones in a scene from the film ''Star Trek: First Contact'' while the drones fulfill a programmed mission. In the ''Star Trek: Voyager'' episode \"[[Mortal Coil (Star Trek: Voyager)|Mortal Coil]]\",  Seven of Nine told Neelix that the Kazon were \"unworthy\" of assimilation and would serve only to detract from the Borg's quest for perceived perfection.\n\n===Travel===\nThe Borg are a [[spacefaring]] race, and their primary interstellar transport is known as a \"'''Borg Cube'''\"<!-- bolded per [[WP:MOSBOLD]] as a redirect target --> due to its shape. A cube was first seen in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Next Generation]]'' episode \"[[Q Who? (TNG episode)|Q Who?]]\" set in 2365. Common capabilities of cubes include high speed [[Warp drive|warp]] and [[Warp drive#transwarp|transwarp]] [[Spacecraft propulsion|drives]], self-regeneration and multiple-redundant systems, [[adaptation|adaptability]] in combat, and various [[directed-energy weapon|energy]] weapons as well as [[tractor beam]]s and cutting beams. Additionally, different types and size of Cubes have been observed as well as Borg Spheres and some smaller craft.<ref>http://www.startrek.com/database_article/borg-cube</ref>\n\nAs with most other ''Star Trek'' races, the Borg also have [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] capability.\n\n===Assimilation===\n'''Assimilation''' is the process by which the Borg integrate beings, cultures, and technology into the Collective. \"You will be assimilated\" is one of the few on-screen phrases employed by the Borg when communicating with other species. The Borg are portrayed as having found and assimilated thousands of species and billions to trillions of individual life-forms throughout the [[galaxy]]. The Borg designate each species with a number assigned to them upon [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]], humanity being 'Species 5618'.\n\nWhen first introduced, the Borg are said to be more interested in assimilating technology than people, roaming the universe as single-minded marauders that have assimilated starships, planets, and entire societies to collect new technology. They are discriminating in this area, finding certain races, for example the [[Kazon]], to be technologically inferior and unworthy of assimilation. A Borg infant found aboard a Borg Cube in \"Q Who?\" shows that the Borg will assimilate even children. The Borg then place the assimilated children into maturation chambers to quickly and fully grow them into mature drones.\n\n[[File:Picard as Locutus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Patrick Stewart]] as Locutus of Borg, the assimilated [[Jean-Luc Picard]]]]\nIn their second appearance, \"[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]\", they capture and assimilate Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] into the Collective, creating Locutus of Borg (meaning \"he who has spoken\", in Latin).\n\nThe method of assimilating individual life-forms into the Collective has been represented differently over time. When we see the Borg in ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', assimilation is through abduction and then surgical procedure. In ''Star Trek: First Contact'' and ''Star Trek: Voyager'', assimilation is through injection of [[Nanorobotics|nanoprobes]] into an individual's [[Circulatory system|bloodstream]] via a pair of tubules that spring forth from a drone's hand. Assimilation by tubules is depicted on-screen as being a fast-acting process, with the victim's skin pigmentation turning gray and mottled with visible dark tracks forming within moments of contact. After assimilation, a drone's race and gender become \"irrelevant\". After initial assimilation through injection, Borg are surgically fitted with cybernetic devices. In ''Star Trek: First Contact'' an assimilated crew member is shown to have a forearm and an eye physically removed and replaced with cybernetic implants.\n\nThe Borg also assimilate, interface, and reconfigure technology using these tubules and nanoprobes. However, in ''Q Who?'' we see a Borg apparently trying to assimilate, probe, or reconfigure a control panel in engineering using an energy interface instead of nanoprobes.\n\nSome species, for various stated reasons, are able to resist assimilation by nanoprobes. [[Species 8472]] is the only race shown to be capable of completely rejecting assimilation attempts. Other species, such as the [[Hirogen]], have demonstrated resistance to assimilation as well as [[Phlox (Star Trek)|Dr Phlox]], who was able to partially resist the assimilation process in the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode \"[[Regeneration (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Regeneration]]\".<ref>''Star Trek: Voyager'', season 3 episode 26 and Season 4 Episode 1 (Scorpion Parts 1 & 2)</ref>\n\n==Concept==\nThe Borg represented a new antagonist and regular enemy that was lacking during the first season of ''TNG''; the [[Klingon]]s were allies and the [[Romulan]]s mostly absent. The [[Ferengi]] were originally intended as the new enemy for the United Federation of Planets, but their comical appearance and devotion to [[Capitalism|capitalist]] accumulation by [[free enterprise]] failed to portray them as a convincing threat. The Borg, however, with their frightening appearance, their immense power, and their sinister motive, became the signature villains for the ''TNG'' and ''Voyager'' eras of ''Star Trek''. In ''Voyager'' episode \"[[Q2 (Star Trek: Voyager)|Q2]]\", even Q tells his son, \"Don't provoke the Borg.\"\n\n''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' (''TNG'') writers began to develop the idea of the Borg as early as the Season 1 episode, \"[[Conspiracy (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Conspiracy]]\", which introduced a coercive, [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] life form that took over key Federation personnel. Plans to feature the Borg as an increasingly menacing threat were subsequently scrapped in favor of a more subtle introduction, beginning with the mystery of missing colonies on both sides of the Neutral Zone in \"[[The Neutral Zone (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Neutral Zone]]\" and culminating in the encounter between Borg and the ''Enterprise'' crew in \"[[Q Who?]]\".<ref>text commentary by Michael Okuda in the collector's edition of Star Trek: First Contact</ref>\n\n==Borg Queen==<!-- This section is linked from [[Data (Star Trek)]] -->\n[[File:Borg Queen 2372.jpg|thumb|[[Alice Krige]] as the Borg Queen in ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''.]]\nBefore the film ''Star Trek: First Contact'' (1996), the Borg exhibited no hierarchical command structure. ''First Contact'' introduced the Borg Queen, who is not named as such in the film (referring to herself with \"I am the Borg. I am the Collective.\") but is named Borg Queen in the closing credits. The Queen is played by [[Alice Krige]] in this film and in the 2001 finale of ''Star Trek: Voyager'', \"[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]\". The character also appeared in Voyager's two-part episodes \"[[Dark Frontier (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dark Frontier]]\" (1999) and \"[[Unimatrix Zero (Star Trek: Voyager)|Unimatrix Zero]]\" (2000), but was portrayed by [[Susanna Thompson]].<ref>https://www.trektoday.com/news/150500_03.shtml</ref> Whether or not these appearances represent the same queen is never confirmed. The queen was killed in both ''First Contact'' and \"Dark Frontier\", so there may be a total of three queens throughout the series. In ''First Contact'', the Borg Queen is heard during a flashback of Picard's former assimilation, implying that she was present during the events of \"Best of Both Worlds\".\n\nThe Borg Queen is the focal point within the Borg collective consciousness and a unique drone within the Collective, who brings \"order to chaos\", referring to herself as \"we\" and \"I\" interchangeably. In ''First Contact'', the Queen's dialogue suggests she is an expression of the Borg Collective's overall intelligence, not a controller but the avatar of the entire Collective as an individual. This sentiment is contradicted by ''Star Trek: Voyager'', where she is seen explicitly directing, commanding, and in one instance even overriding the Collective. The introduction of the Queen radically changed the canonical understanding of the Borg function, with the authors of ''The Computers of Star Trek'' noting \"It was a lot easier for viewers to focus on a villain rather than a hive-mind that made decisions based on the input of all its members.\"<ref>Lois H. Gresh & Robert Weinberg, ''The Computers of Star Trek''. New York: Basic Books (1999): 147. \"It was a lot easier for viewers to focus on a villain rather than a hive-mind that made decisions based on the input of all its members.\"</ref>  ''First Contact'' writers [[Brannon Braga]] and [[Ronald D. Moore]] have defended the introduction of the Queen as a dramatic necessity, noting on the film's DVD audio commentary that they had initially written the film with drones, but then found that it was essential for the main characters to have someone to interact with beyond mindless drones.\n\n==Borg appearances==\nThe Borg were introduced on syndicated television on May 8, 1989, in the ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' episode \"Q Who?\", and rose to further prominence in the famous two part [[cliffhanger]] \"Best of Both Worlds, Part I\",<ref>[https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/star-trek-tng/32076/revisiting-star-trek-tng-best-of-both-worlds]</ref> which aired on June 18, 1990, with the sequel airing on September 24, 1990. In the ''Star Trek'' in-universe timeline, the earliest the Borg have been displayed is in 1996's ''Star Trek: First Contact''.\n\nOverall Borg aliens appear in a total of about 100 episodes of various incarnations of ''Star Trek''. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/star-trek-picard-essential-borg-episodes|title=The Best of Borg worlds: The 7 essential Borg episodes to watch before Star Trek: Picard|last=Britt|first=Ryan|date=2020-01-20|website=SYFY WIRE|language=en|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref> However, this is only by counting all the episodes which include the ex-borg character Seven of Nine.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Borg appear in just six episodes of ''Star Trek The Next Generation'' and 23 major appearances in ''Star Trek: Voyager''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===''The Next Generation''===\nThe Borg first appear in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' second-season episode \"[[Q Who?]]\", when the omnipotent life-form [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] hurls the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise''-D]] across the galaxy to challenge [[Jean-Luc Picard]]'s assertion that his crew is ready to face the galaxy's dangers and mysteries. The ''Enterprise'' crew is overwhelmed by the Borg, and Picard begs for and receives Q's help in returning the ship to its previous coordinates.\n\nThe Borg next appear in ''The Next Generation''{{'}}s third-season finale and fourth-season premiere, \"[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]\". Picard is abducted and assimilated by the Borg and transformed into [[Jean-Luc Picard|Locutus]], the Latin for \"he who speaks\". Picard's knowledge of Starfleet's strengths and strategies is gained by the Collective, and the single cube destroys the entire Starfleet armada at [[Battle of Wolf 359|Wolf 359]]. The ''Enterprise'' crew manages to capture Locutus, gain information through him that allows them to destroy the cube, and then reverse the assimilation process.\n\nIn the fifth-season episode \"[[I, Borg]]\", the ''Enterprise'' crew rescues an adolescent Borg they name \"[[List of Star Trek characters (G\u2013M)#H|Hugh]]\". The crew faces the moral decision of whether or not to use Hugh (who begins to develop a sense of independence as a result of a severed link to the Collective) as a means of delivering a devastating computer virus to the Borg, or return to the Borg with his individuality intact.<ref name=\"TNGcompanion\">{{cite book|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|author=Nemeck, Larry|isbn=0-7434-5798-6}}</ref> They decide to return him without the virus, but in the sixth-season episode \"[[Descent (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Descent]]\", a group of rogue Borg who had \"assimilated\" individuality through Hugh fall under the control of the android [[Lore (Star Trek)|Lore]], the \"older brother\" of Data. Lore also corrupts Data through the use of an \"emotion chip\", simultaneously deactivating Data's ethical subroutines and only projecting negative emotions to it. Under this programming, Data participates in the capture of Picard, La Forge and Troi, but they are able to reactivate Data's ethical subroutines, allowing him to recognize that his current actions are wrong and leading to him deactivating Lore. Data recovers the emotion chip and the surviving Borg fall under the leadership of Hugh.\n\nIn 2017, SYFY listed \"I, Borg\" among the 25 best science fiction episodes of the last 25 years.<ref>[https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/the-25-greatest-stand-alone-episodes-of-sci-fi-tv-of-the-past-25-years]</ref>\n\n===''First Contact''===\nThe Borg return as the antagonists in the ''Next Generation'' film, ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''. After again failing to assimilate Earth by a direct assault in the year 2373, the Borg travel back in time to the year 2063 to try to stop [[Zefram Cochrane]]'s first contact with the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]], change the timeline, and erase Starfleet from existence. The [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|''Enterprise''-E]] crew follows the Borg back in time and restores the original timeline. ''First Contact'' introduces the [[#Borg Queen|Borg Queen]] as played by  Alice Krige, who later reprised the role on United Paramount Network for the finale of ''Star Trek: Voyager''.\n\n===''Deep Space Nine''===\nThere is only one episode with Borg in ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' in the premiere episode ''[[Emissary (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Emissary]]''<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Benjamin Sisko]] ([[Avery Brooks]]) was an officer on the USS ''Saratoga'', one of the ships in the Starfleet armada dispatched to confront the Borg at Wolf 359. The ''Saratoga'' is destroyed by the Borg, killing Sisko's wife, Jennifer. During that episode, Sisko's meeting with Picard is tense as he blames Picard for the actions of Locutus. Throughout the remainder of the series, references to the Borg are made occasionally, including the design of their ship, [[USS Defiant|USS ''Defiant'']], and the battle from ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' being used as a plot point in Season 5 when Starfleet is spread too thin to deal with a Dominion incursion.\n\n===''Voyager''===\nThe Borg make frequent appearances in ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', which takes place in the Delta Quadrant. The Borg are first seen by ''Voyager'' in the third-season episode \"[[Unity (Star Trek: Voyager)|Unity]]\" in which [[Chakotay]] discovers the body of what the local humanoids refer to as \"the Invaders\"; which turns out to be the Borg. In \"[[Scorpion (Star Trek: Voyager)|Scorpion]]\", the Borg are engaged in a war of attrition against [[Species 8472]], whose biological defences are a match for the Borg's nanoprobes. In one of the few instances of the Borg negotiating, in exchange for safe passage through Borg space, the ''Voyager'' crew devises a way to destroy the otherwise invulnerable Species 8472. A Borg drone, [[Seven of Nine]], is dispatched to ''Voyager'' to facilitate this arrangement. After successfully driving Species 8472 back into their fluidic space, Seven of Nine is severed from the Collective and becomes a member of ''Voyager''{{'}}s crew. Seven of Nine's rediscovery of her individuality becomes a recurring theme throughout the series.\n\n''The Hollywood Reporter'' ranked \"Scorpion\" as the 4th best episode of ''Voyager'' in 2016,<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/star-trek-voyager-episodes-best-930900/item/worst-case-scenario-star-trek-925117 'Star Trek: Voyager' \u2014 The 15 Greatest Episodes].

The Borg play a peripheral role in \"[[Infinite Regress (Star Trek: Voyager)|Infinite Regress]]\", when Seven of Nine is exposed to a weapon against the Borg that essentially causes her to suffer from [[Dissociative identity disorder|MPD]], reverting to the personas of various people she assimilated while in the Collective. In \"[[Dark Frontier (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dark Frontier]]\", ''Voyager'' steals and uses a transwarp coil to both rescue Seven of Nine from the Borg Queen and then knock another fifteen years off their journey home before the coil burns out.\n\nIn the sixth season episode, \"[[Collective (Star Trek: Voyager)|Collective]]\", the crew of ''Voyager'' encounter a damaged cube that is holding Tom Paris, Neelix, Harry Kim and Chakotay hostage. With all the adult drones dead, the ship is run by five Borg children who are saved by ''Voyager'' and deassimilated. The later episode \"Child's Play\" reveals that the cube was infected by a pathogen that Icheb, one of the children, had been engineered to act as a host for by his parents, but the crew rescue Icheb before he can be sent back to the Borg. The crew encounter the Borg again in \"[[Unimatrix Zero]]\", a two-part cliffhanger between seasons six and seven.\n\nIn the seventh season we see the Borg in \"[[Q2 (Star Trek: Voyager)|Q2]]\", where Q's son brings Borg onto ''Voyager'', in \"[[Shattered (Star Trek: Voyager)|Shattered]]\", where the events depicted in \"Scorpion\" are revisited and in the series finale, \"[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]\", in which [[Admiral Janeway]] from the future tries to bring ''Voyager'' back to Earth using a Borg transwarp hub. During this episode, Janeway infects the Borg with a [[Cordotomy|neurolytic]] pathogen that infects the collective and kills the Queen.\n\nThere are 26 major episodes featuring the Borg in Voyager, however there are about 100 if counting those with Seven of Nine.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===''Enterprise''===\nIn the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode \"[[Regeneration (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Regeneration]]\", the remnants of the destroyed sphere from ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' are discovered in the [[Arctic]] along with two frozen drones. The Borg steal a research ship and send a transmission toward the Delta Quadrant before they are destroyed, creating a perpetual time loop/predestination paradox.\n\n===''Discovery''===\nThough the Borg do not appear, in the ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' episode \"Perpetual Infinity\", Captain Leland of Section 31 is infected with nanites by the time-traveling rogue artificial intelligence known as Control. Leland displays characteristics similar to Borg drones, including black veins and a heightened ability to adapt in combat, leading some fans to speculate that Control is connected to the origin of the Borg or reverse engineered from recovered Borg tech. In addition, the Borg are known for their possession of [[Warp drive#Transwarp|transwarp]] technology, which allows them to travel to any section of the galaxy in an instant. Some fans suggest the technology may have been derived from ''Discovery''{{'}}s spore drive though there is no evidence to support this as of yet.\n\nThese theories are not confirmed as a Borg origin story in any episodes to date.<ref>https://screenrant.com/star-trek-discovery-control-borg-origin-theory/</ref><ref>https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/star-trek-discovery-the-borg-origin-story-retcon.html</ref>\n\n=== ''Picard'' ===\nThis series' first season includes four recovering ex-Borg characters: Picard, Seven of Nine, Hugh, (featured in \"I, Borg\" and \"Descent\")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etonline.com/star-trek-picard-what-you-need-to-know-before-diving-into-the-cbs-all-access-series-140094|title='Star Trek: Picard': The Complete Guide to the CBS All Access Series|website=Entertainment Tonight|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> and Icheb.\n\n==Origin==\nThe origin of the Borg is never made clear, though they are portrayed as having existed for hundreds of thousands of years (as attested by [[Guinan (Star Trek)|Guinan]] and the Borg Queen). In ''Star Trek: First Contact'', the Borg Queen merely states that the Borg were once much like humanity, \"flawed and weak\", but gradually developed into a partially synthetic species in an ongoing attempt to evolve and perfect themselves.\n\nIn ''TNG''{{'}}s \"Q Who?\", Guinan mentions that the Borg are \"made up of organic and artificial life [...] which has been developing for [...] thousands of centuries.\" In the later episode of ''Star Trek: Voyager'', \"[[Dragon's Teeth (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dragon's Teeth]]\", Gedrin, of the race the Vaadwaur, says that before he and his people were put into suspended animation 892 years earlier (1482 A.D.), the Borg had assimilated only a few colonies in the Delta Quadrant and were considered essentially a minor nuisance. Now awake in the 24th century, he is amazed to see that the Borg control a vast area of the Delta Quadrant. [[Seven of Nine]] comments that the Borg's collective memories of that time period are fragmentary, though it is never established why that is.\n\n===Non-canon origin stories===\n''[[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]'' speculates that a connection could exist between the Borg and ''[[V'ger]]'', the vessel encountered in ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. This idea of a connection is advanced in [[William Shatner]]'s novel ''The Return''. The connection was also suggested in a letter included in ''[[Starlog]]'' no. 160 (November 1990). The letter writer, Christopher Haviland, also speculated that the original Borg drones were members of a race called \"the Preservers\", which [[Spock]] had suggested in the [[Star Trek Original Series|original series]] episode \"[[The Paradise Syndrome]]\" might be responsible for why so many humanoids populate the galaxy. It was confirmed in the ''TNG'' episode \"[[The Chase (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Chase]]\" that an ancient species seeded hundreds, if not thousands of planets with their DNA, creating the Humans, Vulcans, (and Romulans as they are a  Vulcan offshoot race) Cardassians and others.\n\nThe extra section of the game ''[[Star Trek: Legacy]]'' contains the supposed \"Origin of the Borg\", which tells the story of ''V'ger'' being sucked into a [[black hole]]. ''V'ger'' was found by a race of living machines that gave it a form suitable to fulfilling its simplistic programming. Unable to determine who its creator could be, the probe declared all [[carbon-based life]] an infestation of the creator's universe, leading to assimilation. From this, the Borg were created, as extensions of ''V'ger''{{'}}s purpose. Drones were made from those assimilated and merged into a collective [[consciousness]]. The Borg Queen was created out of the necessity for a single unifying voice. With thoughts and desires of her own, she was no longer bound to serve ''V'ger''.\n\nIn the graphic novel ''Star Trek: The Manga'', the Borg resulted from an experiment in medical nanotechnology gone wrong. An alien species under threat of extinction by an incurable disease created a repository [[satellite]] containing test subjects infused with body parts, organs, and [[DNA]] of multiple species along with cybernetic enhancements put in place by advanced medical technology. The satellite was maintained by nanomachines, which also maintained the medical equipment on board. The medical facility is parked in orbit by a black hole, and along with the [[Theory of Relativity|relativistic]] state of time around the black hole, allows long-term research to continue at an accelerated time scale rather than in real-time speed. As the medical facility deteriorates, so does the programming of the nanomachines. The nanomachines began infusing themselves into the patients, interpreting them as part of the satellite in need of repair. Among the patients is the daughter of the head medical researcher of the satellite. The satellite eventually falls apart in an encounter with an away team from the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' under the command of [[James T. Kirk]]. In the final moments of the satellite's destruction and the escape of the crew members of the ''Enterprise'' with the patients, the subjects display qualities inherently resembling the Borg: injection of nanomachines in a fashion similar to assimilation, rapid adaptation to weaponry, and a hive mind consciousness, as all the subjects begin following the whim of the daughter. As succumbing to the disease was inevitable, and the corrupt nanomachine programming infused itself into the bodies, the final image of the page of the [[manga]] Borg origin is left with the daughter turned Borg Queen, stating, \"Resistance is futile.\"\n\nIn the novel ''Lost Souls'' (the third book in the ''[[Star Trek: Destiny]]'' trilogy), the Borg are revealed to be the survivors of the Caeliar city Mantilis. Thrown across the galaxy in the [[Galactic quadrant#Delta Quadrant|Delta Quadrant]] and back in time to about 4500 BC by the destruction of Erigol at the climax of ''Gods of Night'', the first book in the trilogy, a group of human survivors from the starship ''Columbia'' [[Home (Star Trek: Enterprise)|(NX-02)]] and Caeliar scientists try to survive in a harsh arctic climate. Most of the human survivors die of exposure, while several Caeliar are absorbed into their race's gestalt to give life to the others in their group mind. The Caeliar offer the remaining humans a merging of human and Caeliar, to allow both groups to survive. The human survivors are resistant and as time goes on, the Caeliar called Sedin becomes the sole survivor of her group, her mental processes and her form both degrading as time goes on. When the humans return to Sedin for help, she forces them to merge with her, unwilling to allow herself to die when a union can save her life. The forced merging of the humans and the mostly decayed Caeliar results in the creation of the first Borg. The gestalt group mind is perverted to become the collective, driven by Sedin's desperate hunger and need to add the strength, technology, and life-force of others to her own. Ironically, while the Caeliar were\u2013albeit accidentally\u2013involved in the creation of the Borg, they also provide the means to end it; in the 24th century, the Caeliar absorb the entire Borg collective back into themselves, ending the cyborgs' centuries-long reign of terror.\n\n==Other non-canon media appearances==\nIn the ''Star Trek'' novel ''Probe'', which takes place following the events of ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'', the Borg are mentioned obliquely in communication with the whale-probe as spacefaring \"mites\" (the whale-probe's term for humanoid races) who traveled in cubical and spherical spacefaring vessels; the Borg apparently attacked the whale-probe and damaged its memory in some fashion before the events of the film.\n\nIn the ''Star Trek'' game ''[[Star Trek: Legacy]]'', the Borg are featured prominently throughout the ''Enterprise'' and ''TOS'' era's before becoming a major threat in the ''TNG'' era. In unlockable motion-comics that are unlocked after completing each era, it is revealed that the Vulcan T'Uerell experimented on Borg corpses left behind from the ''Enterprise'' episode \"Regeneration\", and became assimilated. It was not until the end of the ''TOS'' era that she made contact with the main Borg force and became a queen before she was finally killed in a fleet of Starfleet, Romulan, and Klingon ships led by Picard.\n\nThe [[Peter David]] novel ''Vendetta'' reveals that the planet killer weapon from the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Original Series]]'' episode \"[[The Doomsday Machine (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Doomsday Machine]]\" is a prototype for a weapon against the Borg. David revisited this concept in a 2007 sequel novel, ''Before Dishonor'', which features the ''Enterprise''-E working with Spock and Seven of Nine to reactivate the original planet killer to stop the Borg.\n\nIn [[William Shatner]]'s novel ''[[The Return (Shatner novel)|The Return]]'', [[Spock]] is nearly assimilated by the Borg, but is saved because he mind-melded with [[V'ger]], an earlier form of the Borg, and they assume that he is already a Borg. Using the information he subconsciously acquired in the meld, Spock is able to lead a crew of ''Enterprise'' officers (consisting of the ''Enterprise''-D crew, himself, Admiral McCoy, and the resurrected Kirk) in a ''Defiant''-class ship to destroy the Borg central node, severing all branches of the Collective from each other and limiting their future threat.\n\nIn David Mack's novel trilogy ''[[Star Trek: Destiny]]'', set over a year after ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'', the Borg stage a massive invasion of local space. Due to Kathryn Janeway crippling their infrastructure in \"[[Endgame (Star Trek)|Endgame]]\", the Borg fear for their survival and attempt to exterminate the Federation and its neighbors.

The town incorporated to subsidize the [[Housatonic Railroad]] and rapidly industrialized following the rail line's connection to the [[New York and New Haven Railroad|New York and New Haven]] railroad. The namesake of the town was the need for bridges over the [[Pequonnock River]] that provided a navigable port at the mouth of the river. Manufacturing was the mainstay of the local economy until the 1970s.\n\n=== Colonial history ===\n[[File:Old Stratfield (Bridgeport) Map before 1886.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Colonial Stratfield, c. 1886 map]]\n\nThe first documented [[English people|English]] settlement within the present city limits of Bridgeport took place in 1644, centered at Black Rock Harbor and along North Avenue between Park and Briarwood Avenues.

With the ability to nominate and endorse Democratic candidates running for local office, they have the resources to outperform challenger slates that may compete with them.

These include WMCA, WFAN, WOR, WABC, WNYC, WCBS, WEPN, WQEW, WBLI, and WALK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/locate?select=city&city=bridgeport%2C+ct&sid=|title=Radio Stations in Bridgeport, Connecticut.|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{Bridgeport Radio}}\n\n=== Newspapers ===\n* Elsolnews.com, a community Spanish language weekly newspaper covering news and events.\n* ''Connecticut Post'' \u2013 Formerly the ''Bridgeport Post and Bridgeport Telegram'', which covers Bridgeport and the surrounding area. The newspaper is printed daily.\n\n=== Television ===\nBridgeport was [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC's]] pioneer [[Ultra high frequency|UHF TV]] test site from December 29, 1949 to August 23, 1952;<ref>{{cite news|title=1908 world ended at your town's border|first=Amanda |last=Cuda |date=December 31, 2007 |publisher=Connecticut Post (ctpost.com, Bridgeport, CT)}}</ref> the equipment from the [[KC2XAK|\"Operation Bridgeport\"]] tests was later deployed commercially at [[KPTV]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] (1952\u20131957). While Bridgeport is primarily served by [[New York City]] stations, some local UHF broadcasters operate today:\n* [[Connecticut Public Television|WEDW]] channel 49; one of the [[Connecticut Public Television]] stations, broadcasts from Bridgeport and can be seen in Hartford.\n* In 2011, [[WTNH-TV]] opened a satellite studio in the offices of the Connecticut Post Downtown on State Street.\n* [[WZME]] channel 43; a [[Sonlife Broadcasting Network]] affiliate, currently channel sharing with WEDW and licensed to Bridgeport.\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n=== Airports ===\n[[Sikorsky Memorial Airport]] in neighboring [[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]] was previously owned by the City of Bridgeport before closing a deal in 2016 that sold the land to Stratford. It once provided regional flights to major cities, but commercial operations at the airport were terminated in November 1999.\n\n=== Roads ===\n\n==== Surface thoroughfares ====\nThe main portion of the city is divided by major north\u2013south roads that approximately parallel each other:\n* '''Main Street''', the city's principal artery, extends from the Trumbull town line down through the North End, under Routes 8/25, and into Downtown, with its southern terminus at Seaside Park. The portion north of State Street was laid out as the \"Newtown Turnpike\" in 1795. Porter Street, Beechmont Avenue, and Kaechele Place are former curves in this highway that were lopped off as the road was straightened in the 19th century.\n* '''Park Avenue''' lies on the border with the town of Fairfield (north of its intersection with Brooklawn Avenue) and extends from the [[Trumbull, Connecticut]] border in the North End to the South End at Seaside Park. It was known as \"Division Street\" until 1867. It is the easternmost of the \"11 o'clock\" roadways laid out in 17th-century Fairfield (their north-northwesterly direction points them like a clock's hands at that hour, exactly perpendicular to the shoreline of Long Island Sound, which facilitated land distribution).\n* '''Clinton/Brooklawn Avenues''' are a central artery through the West End, extending north from Railroad Avenue to the Fairfield line at the Rooster River. The portion north of Fairfield Avenue was laid out in the 17th century at the center of the agricultural village of Stratfield. It was known as Stratfield Road until 1870.\n* '''Brewster Street''' extends from Black Rock Harbor north to the Fairfield line at Ash Creek, and is the major north\u2013south artery through the Black Rock neighborhood. This was the southernmost portion of the \"Black Rock Turnpike,\" a late-18th century toll road that extended as far north as Danbury.\n* '''Madison Avenue''' is between Main Street and Park Avenue and extends from the Trumbull town line in the North End through the West Side. It was formerly known as Chestnut Hill Road and follows the route of an Indian path.\n* '''Reservoir Avenue''' was part of a turnpike laid out in 1817 in an almost straight line from Bridgeport north to the Monroe Green (it followed Daniels Farm Road in Trumbull and Moose Hill Road in Monroe). The \"Reservoir\" was a stone structure at the intersection of Sylvan Avenue, to which water was pumped from nearby Bunnell's Pond, and from which water was supplied to the city by gravity. Until construction of the Route 25-8 Expressway, this street extended south to North Avenue.\n* '''Noble Avenue''' extends from the corner of Congress Street just south of Washington Park to the intersection of East Main Street and Huntington Turnpike. The portion below Boston Avenue was laid out in 1850 as Noble Street; the part to the north was added to connect with the entrance to the new Beardsley Park in 1878.\n* '''East Main Street''' is the major north\u2013south road through East Bridgeport, extending from the Trumbull/Stratford line though the East Side, ending at Bridgeport Harbor. The portion south of Boston Avenue/Old Mill Green was laid out in 1800.\n* '''Huntington Road/Huntington Turnpike''' is the major roadway through the Upper East Side, extending northeast from the Berkshire Bridge to the Trumbull town line (a small portion today is part of East Main Street). It was one of a number of turnpikes laid out in the immediate post-Revolutionary period to funnel rural commerce to the fledgling city's seaport, and formerly extended to the city center by way of North Washington Avenue.\n* '''Seaview Avenue''' runs the length of the East End neighborhood on the East shore of Pembroke Lake, Yellow Mill Pond, and Bridgeport Harbor. It extends northwest from Central to Stratford Avenues, then due north from Stratford to Boston Avenues. It was laid out at the time of the Civil War in three sections that were later connected: Sea View Avenue south of Stratford Avenue; West Avenue at Deacon's Point, from Sixth Street North to the railroad tracks; and Lake Avenue, from Barnum Avenue North to Boston Avenue.\n* '''Central/Palisade Avenues''' were laid out as farm highways through the western portions of what was the town of Stratford in the early 19th century. They form a north\u2013south axis through the center of today's East End. The portion of Central Avenue north of Barnum Avenue was known as Prospect Street from the 1860s through 1889 due to the vistas from its hillside location.\n\nThe major east\u2013west roads in the city include Barnum Avenue, Boston Avenue, Fairfield Avenue/Stratford Avenue, North Avenue, Capitol Avenue, State Street, and Railroad Avenue:\n* '''Barnum Avenue''' extends from the Stratford line, below Old Mill Hill, and ends at the Pequonnock River. The portion through the East Side was laid out as Barnum Street in 1850. From Pembroke Lake to Mill Hill Avenue was added in 1863. The road from Mill Hill Avenue to the Washington Bridge between Stratford and Milford was laid out as the Air Line Highway in 1870.\n* '''Boston Avenue''' breaks off from Barnum Avenue near the Bridgeport line in Stratford and travels east\u2013west over Old Mill Hill to the Upper East Side toward the North End. It follows the route of an Indian path, crossing Old Mill Brook and the Pequonnock River and the southernmost points where they were fordable, which became the Post Road in the 1670s.\n* '''Stratford Avenue''' starts in the South End of the town of Stratford and travels southwest through the East End. It then travels east through East Bridgeport directly into the center of downtown Bridgeport, where it turns into Fairfield Avenue at Water Street. It was laid out in 1795 as a more direct route for the Post Road, and the bridge built that year over the Pequonnock was the origin of the name \"Bridgeport.\" '''Connecticut Avenue,''' which parallels it one block north through the East End, is a one-way street heading west, while Stratford Avenue is one-way heading east.\n* '''Fairfield Avenue''' extends west and then southwest through the West End and into Black Rock, where it turns into the Boston Post Road, or simply the Post Road, at the [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]] line. Its route through the West End parallels what had been the northern edge of an extensive salt marsh, and existed in the 18th century. The portion through Black Rock was added in the 1870s.\n* '''North Avenue''' begins at Boston Avenue where the East Side abuts the Island Brook neighborhood at the Pequonnock River and extends southwest diagonally through the city as US 1. It then turns into '''Kings Highway''' in Fairfield. As with Boston Avenue, it follows an Indian trail, and was formalized as a part of the New York-to-Boston Post Road in the 1670s.\n* '''Capitol Avenue''' begins by breaking off from North Avenue at Island Brook Avenue Extension. It travels west across the Old North End and Brooklawn neighborhoods and ends at the Fairfield line.\n* '''State Street''' begins downtown and cuts across the West End, where it terminates (as State Street Extension) at the Fairfield line. The portion from Park Avenue to Bridgeport Harbor was in existence by the 1760s; the part west of Park Avenue was extended across what was then marshy terrain in 1867.\n* '''Atlantic Street''' bisects the South End neighborhood, historically separating the well-to-do residential district that adjoined the old portion of Seaside Park from the working-class blocks to the north. Today it forms the north border of the University of Bridgeport campus.\n* '''Railroad Avenue''' extends from Broad Street just below downtown Bridgeport and runs parallel with the Metro North/New Haven Railroad lines. The westbound side is north of the tracks, and the eastbound side south of them. It terminates at Fairfield Avenue in the West End.\n\n==== Highways ====\nBridgeport has several major roadways. [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|Interstate 95]] and the [[Route 8 (Connecticut)|Route 8]]/[[Route 25 (Connecticut)|Route 25]] Connector meet in Downtown Bridgeport. I-95 runs east\u2013west near the coast heading towards New York City to the southwest and [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] to the northeast. Routes 8 and 25 run north\u2013south across the city, with the two routes splitting just north of the city. Route 8 continues towards [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] and [[Torrington, Connecticut|Torrington]] and Route 25 continues towards the [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] area. Both Routes 8 and 25 connect to the [[Merritt Parkway]] in the adjacent town of [[Trumbull, Connecticut|Trumbull]].\n\nOther major surface arteries are [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|U.S. 1]] (the [[Boston Post Road]]), which runs east\u2013west north of Downtown, and Main Street, which runs north\u2013south towards Trumbull center. The city also has several secondary state highways, namely, [[Route 127 (Connecticut)|Route 127]] (East Main Street), [[Route 130 (Connecticut)|Route 130]] (Connecticut Avenue, Stratford Avenue, Fairfield Avenue and Water Street), and the [[Huntington Turnpike]].\n\n=== Railroad and ferries ===\n[[File:New Haven Line train approaches Bridgeport, CT station eastbound, December 2012.jpg|thumb|right|A [[New Haven Line]] train approaches the intermodal transit hub at [[Bridgeport (Metro-North station)|Bridgeport Station]]]]\n\nThe [[Bridgeport Traction Company]] provided streetcar service in the region until 1937. The Housatonic Railroad carried passengers North through the Pequonnock and Housatonic Valleys prior to 1933.\n\nThe city is connected to nearby New York City by both [[Amtrak]] and [[Metro-North Railroad|Metro-North]] commuter trains, which serve [[Bridgeport (Metro-North station)|Bridgeport's Metro-North station]]. Many residents commute to New York jobs on these trains, and the city to some extent is developing as an outpost of New York\u2013based workers seeking cheaper rents and larger living spaces. Connecting service is also available to [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] via Metro-North, and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] via Amtrak and Metro-North. [[Shoreline East]] service links [[Old Saybrook]] and [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] with New Haven, which extends to Bridgeport and Stamford during weekday rush hours only.\n\nThe [[Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry]] service runs from Bridgeport across [[Long Island Sound]] to [[Port Jefferson, New York|Port Jefferson]], New York; the three vessels ''Grand Republic'', ''P.T. Barnum'', and ''Park City'' transport both automobiles and passengers.\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe [[Greater Bridgeport Transit Authority]] (GBTA) provides bus service to Bridgeport and its immediate suburbs. Route 2 the Coastal Link goes west to Norwalk and east to Westfield's Connecticut Post Mall in Milford, from where [[Connecticut Transit]] can bring passengers to the New Haven Green. [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] and [[Peter Pan Bus Lines]] both offer intercity bus service to points throughout the Northeast and points beyond.\n\n== Historic sites ==\n\n=== Historic districts ===\nBridgeport has five local historic districts, where exterior changes to structures are under the control of two Historic District Commissions:\n* '''Black Rock Harbor Historic District''', 88 buildings along Ellsworth, Brewster, and Beacon Streets, includes the village center of a historic seaport, with buildings that date back to the 17th century, one of the original English settlements in Bridgeport.\n* '''Pembroke City Historic District''', 266 buildings in a general two-block radius of Washington Park, a planned residential development constructed 1850\u20131900 that contains the city's most important concentration of Victorian architecture.\n* '''Stratfield Historic District''', 300 buildings along Clinton, Brooklawn, and Laurel Avenues that made up an elite residential district of the Edwardian era and has the original 17th century town green, Clinton Park Militia Ground, and the city's oldest cemetery, Stratfield Burying Ground, also dating back to the 17th century. This area along North Avenue is the other original English settlement in what is now Bridgeport.\n* '''Barnum-Palliser Development Historic District''', 33 buildings on Austin, Gregory, and Atlantic Streets and Myrtle Avenue that was a planned working-class development of the 1880s designed by the architectural firm of Palliser, Palliser, and Company.\n* '''Marina Park Historic District''', 14 buildings along South Park Avenue and Marina Park, contains some of the city's most opulent late 19th-early 20th century mansions overlooking Seaside Park.\n* '''AMFAB Art Building''',4 story building housing artists studios on the second, third and fourth floors. First Floor Is Occupied By Tongue In Chique an Antique and Design Gallery featuring art, antiques and fine furnishings from the past to the present. 1069 Connecticut Avenue, Bridgeport, CT 06607\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Connecticut}}\n* [[History of Bridgeport, Connecticut]]\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Bridgeport, Connecticut]]\n* [[List of people from Bridgeport, Connecticut]]\n* [[St. Andrew Church (Bridgeport, Connecticut)]]\n* [[Seaside Village Historic District]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Reference works ===\n* {{citation |contribution=Bridgeport, Conn. |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGIMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA527 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CGIMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA527 527] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGIMAAAAYAAJ |title=Encyclopedia Americana, ''Vol. IV'' |date=1918 |publisher=Encyclopedia Americana Corp. |location=New York |accessdate=29 July 2010 |ref={{harvid|''EA''|1918}} }}.\n* {{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Bridgeport |volume=4  |ref={{harvid|''EB''|1878}} |page=284 }}\n* {{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Bridgeport |volume=3 |ref={{harvid|''EB''|1911}} |page=532 }}\n\n=== Secondary sources ===\n* {{citation |last=Bucki |first=Cecelia Bucki |title=Bridgeport's Socialist New Deal, 1915\u201336 |year=2001 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5sqULah9Jj0C&printsec=frontcover |isbn=978-0-252-02687-4 }}\n* {{Citation |last=Nolen |first=John |title=Better City Planning For Bridgeport |year=1916 |publisher=City Plan Commission |location=Bridgeport | url=https://books.google.com/?id=s9sAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover }}\n* {{Citation |last=Orcutt |first=Samuel |title=A History of the Old Town of Stratford and City of Bridgeport Connecticut<!--sic--> |volume=[https://archive.org/stream/historyofoldtown01orcu#page/n5/mode/2up Vol. I] & [https://archive.org/stream/ahistoryoldtown01conngoog#page/n5/mode/2up II] |date=1886 |publisher=Fairfield County Historical Society |location=Bridgeport }}\n* {{Citation |last=Waldo |first=George Curtis |title=History of Bridgeport and Vicinity |date=1917 |publisher=S.

The town incorporated to subsidize the [[Housatonic Railroad]] and rapidly industrialized following the rail line's connection to the [[New York and New Haven Railroad|New York and New Haven]] railroad. The namesake of the town was the need for bridges over the [[Pequonnock River]] that provided a navigable port at the mouth of the river.

These include WMCA, WFAN, WOR, WABC, WNYC, WCBS, WEPN, WQEW, WBLI, and WALK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/locate?select=city&city=bridgeport%2C+ct&sid=|title=Radio Stations in Bridgeport, Connecticut.|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{Bridgeport Radio}}\n\n=== Newspapers ===\n* Elsolnews.com, a community Spanish language weekly newspaper covering news and events.\n* ''Connecticut Post'' \u2013 Formerly the ''Bridgeport Post and Bridgeport Telegram'', which covers Bridgeport and the surrounding area. The newspaper is printed daily.\n\n=== Television ===\nBridgeport was [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC's]] pioneer [[Ultra high frequency|UHF TV]] test site from December 29, 1949 to August 23, 1952;<ref>{{cite news|title=1908 world ended at your town's border|first=Amanda |last=Cuda |date=December 31, 2007 |publisher=Connecticut Post (ctpost.com, Bridgeport, CT)}}</ref> the equipment from the [[KC2XAK|\"Operation Bridgeport\"]] tests was later deployed commercially at [[KPTV]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] (1952\u20131957). While Bridgeport is primarily served by [[New York City]] stations, some local UHF broadcasters operate today:\n* [[Connecticut Public Television|WEDW]] channel 49; one of the [[Connecticut Public Television]] stations, broadcasts from Bridgeport and can be seen in Hartford.\n* In 2011, [[WTNH-TV]] opened a satellite studio in the offices of the Connecticut Post Downtown on State Street.\n* [[WZME]] channel 43; a [[Sonlife Broadcasting Network]] affiliate, currently channel sharing with WEDW and licensed to Bridgeport.\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n=== Airports ===\n[[Sikorsky Memorial Airport]] in neighboring [[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]] was previously owned by the City of Bridgeport before closing a deal in 2016 that sold the land to Stratford. It once provided regional flights to major cities, but commercial operations at the airport were terminated in November 1999.\n\n=== Roads ===\n\n==== Surface thoroughfares ====\nThe main portion of the city is divided by major north\u2013south roads that approximately parallel each other:\n* '''Main Street''', the city's principal artery, extends from the Trumbull town line down through the North End, under Routes 8/25, and into Downtown, with its southern terminus at Seaside Park. The portion north of State Street was laid out as the \"Newtown Turnpike\" in 1795. Porter Street, Beechmont Avenue, and Kaechele Place are former curves in this highway that were lopped off as the road was straightened in the 19th century.\n* '''Park Avenue''' lies on the border with the town of Fairfield (north of its intersection with Brooklawn Avenue) and extends from the [[Trumbull, Connecticut]] border in the North End to the South End at Seaside Park. It was known as \"Division Street\" until 1867. It is the easternmost of the \"11 o'clock\" roadways laid out in 17th-century Fairfield (their north-northwesterly direction points them like a clock's hands at that hour, exactly perpendicular to the shoreline of Long Island Sound, which facilitated land distribution).\n* '''Clinton/Brooklawn Avenues''' are a central artery through the West End, extending north from Railroad Avenue to the Fairfield line at the Rooster River. The portion north of Fairfield Avenue was laid out in the 17th century at the center of the agricultural village of Stratfield. It was known as Stratfield Road until 1870.\n* '''Brewster Street''' extends from Black Rock Harbor north to the Fairfield line at Ash Creek, and is the major north\u2013south artery through the Black Rock neighborhood. This was the southernmost portion of the \"Black Rock Turnpike,\" a late-18th century toll road that extended as far north as Danbury.\n* '''Madison Avenue''' is between Main Street and Park Avenue and extends from the Trumbull town line in the North End through the West Side. It was formerly known as Chestnut Hill Road and follows the route of an Indian path.\n* '''Reservoir Avenue''' was part of a turnpike laid out in 1817 in an almost straight line from Bridgeport north to the Monroe Green (it followed Daniels Farm Road in Trumbull and Moose Hill Road in Monroe). The \"Reservoir\" was a stone structure at the intersection of Sylvan Avenue, to which water was pumped from nearby Bunnell's Pond, and from which water was supplied to the city by gravity. Until construction of the Route 25-8 Expressway, this street extended south to North Avenue.\n* '''Noble Avenue''' extends from the corner of Congress Street just south of Washington Park to the intersection of East Main Street and Huntington Turnpike. The portion below Boston Avenue was laid out in 1850 as Noble Street; the part to the north was added to connect with the entrance to the new Beardsley Park in 1878.\n* '''East Main Street''' is the major north\u2013south road through East Bridgeport, extending from the Trumbull/Stratford line though the East Side, ending at Bridgeport Harbor. The portion south of Boston Avenue/Old Mill Green was laid out in 1800.\n* '''Huntington Road/Huntington Turnpike''' is the major roadway through the Upper East Side, extending northeast from the Berkshire Bridge to the Trumbull town line (a small portion today is part of East Main Street). It was one of a number of turnpikes laid out in the immediate post-Revolutionary period to funnel rural commerce to the fledgling city's seaport, and formerly extended to the city center by way of North Washington Avenue.\n* '''Seaview Avenue''' runs the length of the East End neighborhood on the East shore of Pembroke Lake, Yellow Mill Pond, and Bridgeport Harbor. It extends northwest from Central to Stratford Avenues, then due north from Stratford to Boston Avenues. It was laid out at the time of the Civil War in three sections that were later connected: Sea View Avenue south of Stratford Avenue; West Avenue at Deacon's Point, from Sixth Street North to the railroad tracks; and Lake Avenue, from Barnum Avenue North to Boston Avenue.\n* '''Central/Palisade Avenues''' were laid out as farm highways through the western portions of what was the town of Stratford in the early 19th century. They form a north\u2013south axis through the center of today's East End. The portion of Central Avenue north of Barnum Avenue was known as Prospect Street from the 1860s through 1889 due to the vistas from its hillside location.\n\nThe major east\u2013west roads in the city include Barnum Avenue, Boston Avenue, Fairfield Avenue/Stratford Avenue, North Avenue, Capitol Avenue, State Street, and Railroad Avenue:\n* '''Barnum Avenue''' extends from the Stratford line, below Old Mill Hill, and ends at the Pequonnock River. The portion through the East Side was laid out as Barnum Street in 1850. From Pembroke Lake to Mill Hill Avenue was added in 1863. The road from Mill Hill Avenue to the Washington Bridge between Stratford and Milford was laid out as the Air Line Highway in 1870.\n* '''Boston Avenue''' breaks off from Barnum Avenue near the Bridgeport line in Stratford and travels east\u2013west over Old Mill Hill to the Upper East Side toward the North End. It follows the route of an Indian path, crossing Old Mill Brook and the Pequonnock River and the southernmost points where they were fordable, which became the Post Road in the 1670s.\n* '''Stratford Avenue''' starts in the South End of the town of Stratford and travels southwest through the East End. It then travels east through East Bridgeport directly into the center of downtown Bridgeport, where it turns into Fairfield Avenue at Water Street. It was laid out in 1795 as a more direct route for the Post Road, and the bridge built that year over the Pequonnock was the origin of the name \"Bridgeport.\" '''Connecticut Avenue,''' which parallels it one block north through the East End, is a one-way street heading west, while Stratford Avenue is one-way heading east.\n* '''Fairfield Avenue''' extends west and then southwest through the West End and into Black Rock, where it turns into the Boston Post Road, or simply the Post Road, at the [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]] line. Its route through the West End parallels what had been the northern edge of an extensive salt marsh, and existed in the 18th century. The portion through Black Rock was added in the 1870s.\n* '''North Avenue''' begins at Boston Avenue where the East Side abuts the Island Brook neighborhood at the Pequonnock River and extends southwest diagonally through the city as US 1. It then turns into '''Kings Highway''' in Fairfield. As with Boston Avenue, it follows an Indian trail, and was formalized as a part of the New York-to-Boston Post Road in the 1670s.\n* '''Capitol Avenue''' begins by breaking off from North Avenue at Island Brook Avenue Extension. It travels west across the Old North End and Brooklawn neighborhoods and ends at the Fairfield line.\n* '''State Street''' begins downtown and cuts across the West End, where it terminates (as State Street Extension) at the Fairfield line. The portion from Park Avenue to Bridgeport Harbor was in existence by the 1760s; the part west of Park Avenue was extended across what was then marshy terrain in 1867.\n* '''Atlantic Street''' bisects the South End neighborhood, historically separating the well-to-do residential district that adjoined the old portion of Seaside Park from the working-class blocks to the north. Today it forms the north border of the University of Bridgeport campus.\n* '''Railroad Avenue''' extends from Broad Street just below downtown Bridgeport and runs parallel with the Metro North/New Haven Railroad lines. The westbound side is north of the tracks, and the eastbound side south of them. It terminates at Fairfield Avenue in the West End.\n\n==== Highways ====\nBridgeport has several major roadways. [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|Interstate 95]] and the [[Route 8 (Connecticut)|Route 8]]/[[Route 25 (Connecticut)|Route 25]] Connector meet in Downtown Bridgeport. I-95 runs east\u2013west near the coast heading towards New York City to the southwest and [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] to the northeast. Routes 8 and 25 run north\u2013south across the city, with the two routes splitting just north of the city. Route 8 continues towards [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] and [[Torrington, Connecticut|Torrington]] and Route 25 continues towards the [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] area. Both Routes 8 and 25 connect to the [[Merritt Parkway]] in the adjacent town of [[Trumbull, Connecticut|Trumbull]].\n\nOther major surface arteries are [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|U.S. 1]] (the [[Boston Post Road]]), which runs east\u2013west north of Downtown, and Main Street, which runs north\u2013south towards Trumbull center. The city also has several secondary state highways, namely, [[Route 127 (Connecticut)|Route 127]] (East Main Street), [[Route 130 (Connecticut)|Route 130]] (Connecticut Avenue, Stratford Avenue, Fairfield Avenue and Water Street), and the [[Huntington Turnpike]].\n\n=== Railroad and ferries ===\n[[File:New Haven Line train approaches Bridgeport, CT station eastbound, December 2012.jpg|thumb|right|A [[New Haven Line]] train approaches the intermodal transit hub at [[Bridgeport (Metro-North station)|Bridgeport Station]]]]\n\nThe [[Bridgeport Traction Company]] provided streetcar service in the region until 1937. The Housatonic Railroad carried passengers North through the Pequonnock and Housatonic Valleys prior to 1933.\n\nThe city is connected to nearby New York City by both [[Amtrak]] and [[Metro-North Railroad|Metro-North]] commuter trains, which serve [[Bridgeport (Metro-North station)|Bridgeport's Metro-North station]]. Many residents commute to New York jobs on these trains, and the city to some extent is developing as an outpost of New York\u2013based workers seeking cheaper rents and larger living spaces. Connecting service is also available to [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] via Metro-North, and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] via Amtrak and Metro-North. [[Shoreline East]] service links [[Old Saybrook]] and [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] with New Haven, which extends to Bridgeport and Stamford during weekday rush hours only.\n\nThe [[Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry]] service runs from Bridgeport across [[Long Island Sound]] to [[Port Jefferson, New York|Port Jefferson]], New York; the three vessels ''Grand Republic'', ''P.T. Barnum'', and ''Park City'' transport both automobiles and passengers.\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe [[Greater Bridgeport Transit Authority]] (GBTA) provides bus service to Bridgeport and its immediate suburbs. Route 2 the Coastal Link goes west to Norwalk and east to Westfield's Connecticut Post Mall in Milford, from where [[Connecticut Transit]] can bring passengers to the New Haven Green. [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] and [[Peter Pan Bus Lines]] both offer intercity bus service to points throughout the Northeast and points beyond.\n\n== Historic sites ==\n\n=== Historic districts ===\nBridgeport has five local historic districts, where exterior changes to structures are under the control of two Historic District Commissions:\n* '''Black Rock Harbor Historic District''', 88 buildings along Ellsworth, Brewster, and Beacon Streets, includes the village center of a historic seaport, with buildings that date back to the 17th century, one of the original English settlements in Bridgeport.\n* '''Pembroke City Historic District''', 266 buildings in a general two-block radius of Washington Park, a planned residential development constructed 1850\u20131900 that contains the city's most important concentration of Victorian architecture.\n* '''Stratfield Historic District''', 300 buildings along Clinton, Brooklawn, and Laurel Avenues that made up an elite residential district of the Edwardian era and has the original 17th century town green, Clinton Park Militia Ground, and the city's oldest cemetery, Stratfield Burying Ground, also dating back to the 17th century. This area along North Avenue is the other original English settlement in what is now Bridgeport.\n* '''Barnum-Palliser Development Historic District''', 33 buildings on Austin, Gregory, and Atlantic Streets and Myrtle Avenue that was a planned working-class development of the 1880s designed by the architectural firm of Palliser, Palliser, and Company.\n* '''Marina Park Historic District''', 14 buildings along South Park Avenue and Marina Park, contains some of the city's most opulent late 19th-early 20th century mansions overlooking Seaside Park.\n* '''AMFAB Art Building''',4 story building housing artists studios on the second, third and fourth floors. First Floor Is Occupied By Tongue In Chique an Antique and Design Gallery featuring art, antiques and fine furnishings from the past to the present. 1069 Connecticut Avenue, Bridgeport, CT 06607\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Connecticut}}\n* [[History of Bridgeport, Connecticut]]\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Bridgeport, Connecticut]]\n* [[List of people from Bridgeport, Connecticut]]\n* [[St. Andrew Church (Bridgeport, Connecticut)]]\n* [[Seaside Village Historic District]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Reference works ===\n* {{citation |contribution=Bridgeport, Conn. |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGIMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA527 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CGIMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA527 527] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGIMAAAAYAAJ |title=Encyclopedia Americana, ''Vol. IV'' |date=1918 |publisher=Encyclopedia Americana Corp. |location=New York |accessdate=29 July 2010 |ref={{harvid|''EA''|1918}} }}.\n* {{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Bridgeport |volume=4  |ref={{harvid|''EB''|1878}} |page=284 }}\n* {{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Bridgeport |volume=3 |ref={{harvid|''EB''|1911}} |page=532 }}\n\n=== Secondary sources ===\n* {{citation |last=Bucki |first=Cecelia Bucki |title=Bridgeport's Socialist New Deal, 1915\u201336 |year=2001 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5sqULah9Jj0C&printsec=frontcover |isbn=978-0-252-02687-4 }}\n* {{Citation |last=Nolen |first=John |title=Better City Planning For Bridgeport |year=1916 |publisher=City Plan Commission |location=Bridgeport | url=https://books.google.com/?id=s9sAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover }}\n* {{Citation |last=Orcutt |first=Samuel |title=A History of the Old Town of Stratford and City of Bridgeport Connecticut<!--sic--> |volume=[https://archive.org/stream/historyofoldtown01orcu#page/n5/mode/2up Vol. I] & [https://archive.org/stream/ahistoryoldtown01conngoog#page/n5/mode/2up II] |date=1886 |publisher=Fairfield County Historical Society |location=Bridgeport }}\n* {{Citation |last=Waldo |first=George Curtis |title=History of Bridgeport and Vicinity |date=1917 |publisher=S.
