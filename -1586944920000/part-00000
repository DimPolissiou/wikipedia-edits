The model is a product of the Open Systems Interconnection project at the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO). The model groups similar communication functions into one of seven logical layers. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the communications path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that traverse that path.\n\nIn the OSI model, the definition of its [[application layer]] is narrower in scope than is often implemented. The OSI model defines the application layer as being the user interface. The OSI application layer is responsible for displaying data and images to the user in a human-recognizable format and to interface with the [[presentation layer]] below it. In an implementation, the application and presentation layers are frequently combined.\n\n====Method of attack====\nAn application layer DDoS attack is done mainly for specific targeted purposes, including disrupting transactions and access to databases. It requires fewer resources than network layer attacks but often accompanies them.<ref>{{cite news |last=Higgins |first=Kelly Jackson |coauthors= |title=DDoS Attack Used \u2018Headless\u2019 Browser In 150-Hour Siege |newspaper=Dark Reading |location= |pages= |language= |publisher=InformationWeek |date=17 October 2013 |url=http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/ddos-attack-used-headless-browsers-in-15/240162777 |accessdate=28 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122165039/http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/ddos-attack-used-headless-browsers-in-15/240162777 |archivedate=January 22, 2014 |df= }}</ref> An attack may be disguised to look like legitimate traffic, except it targets specific application packets or functions.

In this scenario, attackers with continuous access to several very powerful network resources are capable of sustaining a prolonged campaign generating enormous levels of un-amplified DDoS traffic.\n\nAPDoS attacks are characterised by:\n* advanced reconnaissance (pre-attack [[open-source intelligence|OSINT]] and extensive decoyed scanning crafted to evade detection over long periods)\n* tactical execution (attack with both primary and secondary victims but focus is on primary)\n* explicit motivation (a calculated end game/goal target)\n* large computing capacity (access to substantial computer power and network bandwidth)\n* simultaneous multi-threaded OSI layer attacks (sophisticated tools operating at layers 3 through 7)\n* persistence over extended periods (combining all the above into a concerted, well managed attack across a range of targets).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scmagazineuk.com/video-games-company-hit-by-38-day-ddos-attack/article/367329/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201181833/https://www.scmagazineuk.com/video-games-company-hit-by-38-day-ddos-attack/article/541275/|archive-date=2017-02-01|title=Video games company hit by 38-day DDoS attack|last=Gold|first=Steve|date=21 August 2014|work=SC Magazine UK|accessdate=4 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Denial-of-service as a service===\nSome vendors provide so-called \"booter\" or \"stresser\" services, which have simple web-based front ends, and accept payment over the web.

Bandwidth-saturating floods rely on the attacker's ability to generate the overwhelming flux of packets. A common way of achieving this today is via distributed denial-of-service, employing a [[botnet]]. \n\n===Attack tools===\nIn cases such as [[MyDoom]] and [[Slowloris (computer security)|Slowloris]] the tools are embedded in [[malware]] and launch their attacks without the knowledge of the system owner. [[Stacheldraht]] is a classic example of a DDoS tool. It uses a layered structure where the attacker uses a [[Client (computing)|client program]] to connect to handlers which are compromised systems that issue commands to the [[Zombie computer|zombie agents]] which in turn facilitate the DDoS attack. Agents are compromised via the handlers by the attacker using automated routines to exploit vulnerabilities in programs that accept remote connections running on the targeted remote hosts. Each handler can control up to a thousand agents.<ref name=\"Dittrich\" />\n\nIn other cases a machine may become part of a DDoS attack with the owner's consent, for example, in [[Operation Payback]] organized by the group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. The [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon]] has typically been used in this way. Along with [[High Orbit Ion Cannon]] a wide variety of DDoS tools are available today, including paid and free versions, with different features available. There is an underground market for these in hacker related forums and IRC channels.\n\n===Application-layer attacks===\nApplication-layer attacks employ DoS-causing [[exploit (computer security)|exploits]] and can cause server-running software to fill the disk space or consume all available memory or [[CPU time]]. Attacks may use specific packet types or connection requests to saturate finite resources by, for example, occupying the maximum number of open connections or filling the victim's disk space with logs. An attacker with shell-level access to a victim's computer may slow it until it is unusable or crash it by using a [[fork bomb]]. Another kind of application-level DoS attack is [[XDoS]] (or XML DoS) which can be controlled by modern web [[application firewall]]s (WAFs).\n\nAnother target of DDoS attacks may be to produce added costs for the application operator, when the latter uses resources based on [[cloud computing]]. In this case normally application-used resources are tied to a needed quality of service (QoS) level (e.g. responses should be less than 200&nbsp;ms) and this rule is usually linked to automated software (e.g. Amazon CloudWatch<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/|title=Amazon CloudWatch|work=Amazon Web Services, Inc.}}</ref>) to raise more virtual resources from the provider in order to meet the defined QoS levels for the increased requests. The main incentive behind such attacks may be to drive the application owner to raise the elasticity levels in order to handle the increased application traffic, in order to cause financial losses or force them to become less competitive. \n\nA ''banana attack'' is another particular type of DoS. It involves redirecting outgoing messages from the client back onto the client, preventing outside access, as well as flooding the client with the sent packets. A [[LAND]] attack is of this type.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n===Degradation-of-service attacks===\n\"Pulsing\" zombies are compromised computers that are directed to launch intermittent and short-lived floodings of victim websites with the intent of merely slowing it rather than crashing it. This type of attack, referred to as \"degradation-of-service\" rather than \"denial-of-service\", can be more difficult to detect than regular zombie invasions and can disrupt and hamper connection to websites for prolonged periods of time, potentially causing more disruption than concentrated floods.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia Of Information Technology |page=397 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Distributors |year=2007 |isbn=978-81-269-0752-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Internet and the Law |year=2006 |page=325 |first=Aaron |last=Schwabach |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-731-9}}</ref> Exposure of degradation-of-service attacks is complicated further by the matter of discerning whether the server is really being attacked or under normal traffic loads.<ref>{{cite book|title=Networking and Mobile Computing |first=Xicheng |last=Lu |author2=Wei Zhao |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user |year=2005 |isbn=978-3-540-28102-3 |page=424}}</ref>\n\n===Denial-of-service Level II===\nThe goal of DoS L2 (possibly DDoS) attack is to cause a launching of a defense mechanism which blocks the network segment from which the attack originated. In case of distributed attack or IP header modification (that depends on the kind of security behavior) it will fully block the attacked network from the Internet, but without system crash.<ref name=\":0\" />{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Distributed DoS attack===\nA distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers.<ref name=\"Taghavi Zargar 2046\u20132069\"/> Such an attack is often the result of multiple compromised systems (for example, a botnet) flooding the targeted system with traffic. A botnet is a network of zombie computers programmed to receive commands without the owners' knowledge.<ref>{{cite news|title=Has Your Website Been Bitten By a Zombie?|url=http://blog.cloudbric.com/2015/08/has-your-website-been-bitten-by-zombie.html|accessdate=15 September 2015|agency=Cloudbric|date=3 August 2015}}</ref> When a server is overloaded with connections, new connections can no longer be accepted. The major advantages to an attacker of using a distributed denial-of-service attack are that multiple machines can generate more attack traffic than one machine, multiple attack machines are harder to turn off than one attack machine, and that the behavior of each attack machine can be stealthier, making it harder to track and shut down. These attacker advantages cause challenges for defense mechanisms. For example, merely purchasing more incoming bandwidth than the current volume of the attack might not help, because the attacker might be able to simply add more attack machines. This, after all, will end up completely crashing a website for periods of time.\n\nMalware can carry DDoS attack mechanisms; one of the better-known examples of this was [[MyDoom]]. Its DoS mechanism was triggered on a specific date and time. This type of DDoS involved hardcoding the target IP address prior to release of the malware and no further interaction was necessary to launch the attack.\n\nA system may also be compromised with a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan]], allowing the attacker to download a [[Zombie computer|zombie agent]], or the trojan may contain one. Attackers can also break into systems using automated tools that exploit flaws in programs that listen for connections from remote hosts. This scenario primarily concerns systems acting as servers on the web. [[Stacheldraht]] is a classic example of a DDoS tool. It uses a layered structure where the attacker uses a [[Client (computing)|client program]] to connect to handlers, which are compromised systems that issue commands to the [[Zombie computer|zombie agents]], which in turn facilitate the DDoS attack. Agents are compromised via the handlers by the attacker, using automated routines to exploit vulnerabilities in programs that accept remote connections running on the targeted remote hosts. Each handler can control up to a thousand agents.<ref name=\"Dittrich\">{{cite web|url=http://staff.washington.edu/dittrich/misc/stacheldraht.analysis.txt |title=The \"stacheldraht\" distributed denial of service attack tool |first=David |last=Dittrich |publisher=University of Washington |date=December 31, 1999 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref> In some cases a machine may become part of a DDoS attack with the owner's consent, for example, in [[Operation Payback]], organized by the group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. These attacks can use different types of internet packets such as: TCP, UDP, ICMP etc.\n\nThese collections of systems compromisers are known as [[botnet]]s / [[rootserver]]s. DDoS tools like [[Stacheldraht]] still use classic DoS attack methods centered on [[IP spoofing]] and amplification like [[smurf attack]]s and [[fraggle attack]]s (these are also known as bandwidth consumption attacks). [[SYN flood]]s (also known as resource starvation attacks) may also be used. Newer tools can use DNS servers for DoS purposes. Unlike MyDoom's DDoS mechanism, botnets can be turned against any IP address. [[Script kiddie]]s use them to deny the availability of well known websites to legitimate users.<ref name=\"SANS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sans.org/resources/idfaq/trinoo.php|title=SANS Institute \u2013 Intrusion Detection FAQ: Distributed Denial of Service Attack Tools: n/a|accessdate=2008-05-02|publisher=SANS Institute|year=2000|first=Phillip|last=Boyle|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515025103/http://www.sans.org/resources/idfaq/trinoo.php|archive-date=2008-05-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> More sophisticated attackers use DDoS tools for the purposes of [[extortion]]{{spaced ndash}}even against their business rivals.<ref>{{cite web|last=Leyden |first=John |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/23/authorize_ddos_attack/ |title=US credit card firm fights DDoS attack |work=The Register |date=2004-09-23 |accessdate=2011-12-02}}</ref>\n\nSimple attacks such as SYN floods may appear with a wide range of source IP addresses, giving the appearance of a well distributed DoS. These flood attacks do not require completion of the TCP [[Three way handshake#Connection establishment|three way handshake]] and attempt to exhaust the destination SYN queue or the server bandwidth. Because the source IP addresses can be trivially spoofed, an attack could come from a limited set of sources, or may even originate from a single host. Stack enhancements such as [[syn cookies]] may be effective mitigation against SYN queue flooding, however complete bandwidth exhaustion may require involvement.{{elucidate|date=May 2011}}\n\nIf an attacker mounts an attack from a single host it would be classified as a DoS attack. In fact, any attack against availability would be classed as a denial-of-service attack. On the other hand, if an attacker uses many systems to simultaneously launch attacks against a remote host, this would be classified as a DDoS attack.\n\nIt has been reported that there are new attacks from [[internet of things]] (IoT) devices which have been involved in denial of service attacks.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehackernews.com/2015/10/cctv-camera-hacking.html|title=Hacking CCTV Cameras to Launch DDoS Attacks|author=Swati Khandelwal|date=23 October 2015|work=The Hacker News}}</ref>\nIn one noted attack that was made peaked at around 20,000 requests per second which came from around 900 CCTV cameras.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.incapsula.com/blog/cctv-ddos-botnet-back-yard.html|title=CCTV DDoS Botnet In Our Own Back Yard|first1=Igal|last1=Zeifman|first2=Ofer|last2=Gayer|first3=Or|last3=Wilder|website=incapsula.com|date=21 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nUK's [[GCHQ]] has tools built for DDoS, named PREDATORS FACE and ROLLING THUNDER.<ref name=\"firstlook.org\">{{cite web |date=2014-07-15 |author= Glenn Greenwald |url=https://theintercept.com/2014/07/14/manipulating-online-polls-ways-british-spies-seek-control-internet/ |title=HACKING ONLINE POLLS AND OTHER WAYS BRITISH SPIES SEEK TO CONTROL THE INTERNET |website=The Intercept_ |accessdate=2015-12-25}}</ref>\n\n===DDoS extortion===\nIn 2015, DDoS botnets such as DD4BC grew in prominence, taking aim at financial institutions.<ref>{{cite news|title=Who's Behind DDoS Attacks and How Can You Protect Your Website?|url=http://blog.cloudbric.com/2015/09/whos-behind-ddos-attacks-and-how-can.html|accessdate=15 September 2015|agency=Cloudbric|date=10 September 2015}}</ref> Cyber-extortionists typically begin with a low-level attack and a warning that a larger attack will be carried out if a ransom is not paid in [[Bitcoin]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=Cyber-Extortionists Targeting the Financial Sector Are Demanding Bitcoin Ransoms|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-09/bitcoin-ddos-ransom-demands-raise-dd4bc-profile?mod=djemRiskCompliance|accessdate=15 September 2015|agency=Bloomberg|date=9 September 2015}}</ref> Security experts recommend targeted websites to not pay the ransom.

However, the attacker then proceeds to send the actual message body at an extremely slow rate (e.g. 1 byte/110 seconds). Due to the entire message being correct and complete, the target server will attempt to obey the 'Content-Length' field in the header, and wait for the entire body of the message to be transmitted, which can take a very long time. The attacker establishes hundreds or even thousands of such connections, until all resources for incoming connections on the server (the victim) are used up, hence making any further (including legitimate) connections impossible until all data has been sent.

The process typically involves an attacker sending a DNS name look up request to a public DNS server, spoofing the source IP address of the targeted victim. The attacker tries to request as much information as possible, thus amplifying the DNS response that is sent to the targeted victim. Since the size of the request is significantly smaller than the response, the attacker is easily able to increase the amount of traffic directed at the target.<ref>{{cite web |year=2006|url=http://www.isotf.org/news/DNS-Amplification-Attacks.pdf |title=DNS Amplification Attacks |publisher=ISOTF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214074629/http://www.isotf.org/news/DNS-Amplification-Attacks.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-14|author1=Vaughn, Randal |author2=Evron, Gadi }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=July 8, 2013 |title=Alert (TA13-088A) DNS Amplification Attacks |publisher=US-CERT |url=http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A |accessdate=2013-07-17}}</ref> SNMP and [[Network Time Protocol|NTP]] can also be exploited as reflector in an amplification attack.\n\nAn example of an amplified DDoS attack through the [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP) is through a command called monlist, which sends the details of the last 600 hosts that have requested the time from the NTP server back to the requester. A small request to this time server can be sent using a spoofed source IP address of some victim, which results in a response 556.9 times the size of the request being sent to the victim. This becomes amplified when using botnets that all send requests with the same spoofed IP source, which will result a massive amount of data being sent back to the victim.\n\nIt is very difficult to defend against these types of attacks because the response data is coming from legitimate servers. These attack requests are also sent through UDP, which does not require a connection to the server. This means that the source IP is not verified when a request is received by the server. In order to bring awareness of these vulnerabilities, campaigns have been started that are dedicated to finding amplification vectors which has led to people fixing their resolvers or having the resolvers shut down completely.\n\n=== Mirai botnet ===\nThis attack works by using a worm to infect hundreds of thousands of IoT devices across the internet.

In the [[2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal]], [[telemarketing|telemarketers]] were used to flood political opponents with spurious calls to jam phone banks on election day. Widespread publication of a number can also flood it with enough calls to render it unusable, as happened by accident in 1981 with multiple +1-[[area code]]-867-5309 subscribers inundated by hundreds of misdialed calls daily in response to the song [[867-5309/Jenny]].\n\nTDoS differs from other [[telephone harassment]] (such as [[prank call]]s and [[obscene phone call]]s) by the number of calls originated; by occupying lines continuously with repeated automated calls, the victim is prevented from making or receiving both routine and emergency telephone calls.\n\nRelated exploits include [[SMS flooding]] attacks and [[black fax]] or fax loop transmission.\n\n=== TTL expiry attack ===\nIt takes more router resources to drop a packet with a TTL value of 1 or less than it does to forward a packet with higher TTL value. When a packet is dropped due to TTL expiry, the router CPU must generate and send an [[ICMP time exceeded]] response. Generating many of these responses can overload the router's CPU.<ref>{{cite web |title=TTL Expiry Attack Identification and Mitigation |url=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ttl-expiry-attack.html |publisher=[[Cisco Systems]] |access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>\n\n=== UPnP attack ===\nThis attack uses an existing vulnerability in [[Universal Plug and Play]] (UPnP) protocol to get around a considerable amount of the present defense methods and flood a target's network and servers. The attack is based on a DNS amplification technique, but the attack mechanism is a UPnP router which forwards requests from one outer source to another disregarding UPnP behavior rules. Using the UPnP router returns the data on an unexpected UDP port from a bogus IP address, making it harder to take simple action to shut down the traffic flood. According to the [[Imperva]] researchers, the most effective way to stop this attack is for companies to lock down UPnP routers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.darkreading.com/new-ddos-attack-method-leverages-upnp/d/d-id/1331799|title=New DDoS Attack Method Leverages UPnP|work=Dark Reading|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.imperva.com/blog/2018/05/new-ddos-attack-method-demands-a-fresh-approach-to-amplification-assault-mitigation/|title=New DDoS Attack Method Demands a Fresh Approach to Amplification Assault Mitigation \u2013 Blog {{!}} Imperva|date=2018-05-14|work=Blog {{!}} Imperva|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Defense techniques==\nDefensive responses to denial-of-service attacks typically involve the use of a combination of attack detection, traffic classification and response tools, aiming to block traffic that they identify as illegitimate and allow traffic that they identify as legitimate.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Loukas | first1 = G. | last2 = Oke | first2 = G. | doi = 10.1093/comjnl/bxp078 | title = Protection Against Denial of Service Attacks: A Survey | journal = [[The Computer Journal|Comput.

It can be used on networks in conjunction with routers and switches. Application front end hardware analyzes data packets as they enter the system, and then identifies them as priority, regular, or dangerous. There are more than 25 [[bandwidth management]] vendors.\n\n===Application level Key Completion Indicators===\n{{original research|section|date=March 2018|the analogy is complex enough that it should be sourced}}\nApproaches to DDoS attacks against cloud-based applications may be based on an application layer analysis, indicating whether incoming bulk traffic is legitimate and thus triggering elasticity decisions without the economical implications of a DDoS attack.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Alqahtani|first1=S.|last2=Gamble|first2=R. F.|title=DDoS Attacks in Service Clouds|journal=2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)|date=1 January 2015|pages=5331\u20135340|doi=10.1109/HICSS.2015.627|isbn=978-1-4799-7367-5}}</ref> These approaches mainly rely on an identified path of value inside the application and monitor the progress of requests on this path, through markers called Key Completion Indicators.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kousiouris|first=George|title=KEY COMPLETION INDICATORS:minimizing the effect of DoS attacks on elastic Cloud-based applications based on application-level markov chain checkpoints |newspaper=CLOSER Conference|date=2014|doi=10.5220/0004963006220628}}</ref>\n\nIn essence, these technique are statistical methods of assessing the behavior of incoming requests to detect if something unusual or abnormal is going on.\n\nAn analogy is to a bricks-and-mortar department store where customers spend, on average, a known percentage of their time on different activities such as picking up items and examining them, putting them back, filling a basket, waiting to pay, paying, and leaving. These high-level activities correspond to the Key Completion Indicators in a service or site, and once normal behavior is determined, abnormal behavior can be identified. If a mob of customers arrived in store and spent all their time picking up items and putting them back, but never made any purchases, this could be flagged as unusual behavior.\n\nThe department store can attempt to adjust to periods of high activity by bringing in a reserve of employees at short notice. But if it did this routinely, were a mob to start showing up but never buying anything, this could ruin the store with the extra employee costs. Soon the store would identify the mob activity and scale back the number of employees, recognising that the mob provides no profit and should not be served. While this may make it more difficult for legitimate customers to get served during the mob's presence, it saves the store from total ruin.\n\nIn the case of elastic cloud services where a huge and abnormal additional workload may incur significant charges from the cloud service provider, this technique can be used to scale back or even stop the expansion of server availability to protect from economic loss.\n\n===Blackholing and sinkholing===\nWith [[blackhole routing]], all the traffic to the attacked DNS or IP address is sent to a \"black hole\" (null interface or a non-existent server). To be more efficient and avoid affecting network connectivity, it can be managed by the ISP.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Patrikakis |first1=C. |last2=Masikos |first2=M. |last3=Zouraraki |first3=O. |title=Distributed Denial of Service Attacks |journal=The Internet Protocol Journal |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=13\u201335 |date=December 2004 |url=http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac123/ac147/archived_issues/ipj_7-4/dos_attacks.html}}</ref>\n\nA [[DNS sinkhole]] routes traffic to a valid IP address which analyzes traffic and rejects bad packets. Sinkholing is not efficient for most severe attacks.\n\n===IPS based prevention===\n[[Intrusion prevention system]]s (IPS) are effective if the attacks have signatures associated with them. However, the trend among the attacks is to have legitimate content but bad intent. Intrusion-prevention systems which work on content recognition cannot block behavior-based DoS attacks.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nAn [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] based IPS may detect and block denial-of-service attacks because they have the [[Bandwidth (computing)|processing power]] and the granularity to analyze the attacks and act like a [[circuit breaker]] in an automated way.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nA [[RateBasedIPS|rate-based IPS]] (RBIPS) must analyze traffic granularly and continuously monitor the traffic pattern and determine if there is traffic anomaly. It must let the legitimate traffic flow while blocking the DoS attack traffic.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abante|first=Carl|title=Relationship between Firewalls and Protection against DDoS|url=http://www.ecommercewisdom.com/relationship-firewalls-protection-ddos/|newspaper=Ecommerce Wisdom|date=March 2, 2013|accessdate=2013-05-24}}{{dubious|date=December 2013|reason=SPS non-expert unreliable blog}}</ref>\n\n===DDS based defense===\nMore focused on the problem than IPS, a DoS defense system (DDS) can block connection-based DoS attacks and those with legitimate content but bad intent. A DDS can also address both protocol attacks (such as teardrop and ping of death) and rate-based attacks (such as ICMP floods and SYN floods).\n\n===Firewalls===\nIn the case of a simple attack, a [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] could have a simple rule added to deny all incoming traffic from the attackers, based on protocols, ports or the originating IP addresses.\n\nMore complex attacks will however be hard to block with simple rules: for example, if there is an ongoing attack on port 80 (web service), it is not possible to drop all incoming traffic on this port because doing so will prevent the server from serving legitimate traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/94014/How_to_defend_against_DDoS_attacks|first=Paul |last=Froutan|title=How to defend against DDoS attacks|work=[[Computerworld]]|date=June 24, 2004|accessdate=May 15, 2010}}</ref> Additionally, firewalls may be too deep in the network hierarchy, with routers being adversely affected before the traffic gets to the firewall. Also, many security tools still do not support IPv6 or may not be configured properly, so the firewalls often might get bypassed during the attacks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252445613/Cyber-security-vulnerability-concerns-skyrocket|title=Cyber security vulnerability concerns skyrocket|work=ComputerWeekly.com|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n===Routers===\nSimilar to switches, routers have some rate-limiting and [[Access control list|ACL]] capability. They, too, are manually set. Most routers can be easily overwhelmed under a DoS attack. [[Cisco IOS]] has optional features that can reduce the impact of flooding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mehmet.suzen.googlepages.com/qos_ios_dos_suzen2005.pdf |title=Some IoS tips for Internet Service (Providers) |first=Mehmet |last=Suzen |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910202908/http://mehmet.suzen.googlepages.com/qos_ios_dos_suzen2005.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 }}</ref>\n\n===Switches===\nMost switches have some rate-limiting and [[Access control list|ACL]] capability. Some switches provide automatic and/or system-wide [[rate limiting]], [[traffic shaping]], [[delayed binding]] ([[TCP splicing]]), [[deep packet inspection]] and [[Bogon filtering]] (bogus IP filtering) to detect and remediate DoS attacks through automatic rate filtering and WAN Link failover and balancing.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nThese schemes will work as long as the DoS attacks can be prevented by using them. For example, SYN flood can be prevented using delayed binding or TCP splicing. Similarly content based DoS may be prevented using deep packet inspection. Attacks originating from [[Martian packet|dark addresses]] or going to dark addresses can be prevented using [[bogon filtering]]. Automatic rate filtering can work as long as set rate-thresholds have been set correctly. Wan-link failover will work as long as both links have DoS/DDoS prevention mechanism.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n===Upstream filtering===\nAll traffic is passed through a \"cleaning center\" or a \"scrubbing center\" via various methods such as proxies, tunnels, digital cross connects, or even direct circuits, which separates \"bad\" traffic (DDoS and also other common internet attacks) and only sends good traffic beyond to the server. The provider needs central connectivity to the Internet to manage this kind of service unless they happen to be located within the same facility as the \"cleaning center\" or \"scrubbing center\". DDoS attacks can overwhelm any type of hardware firewall, and passing malicious traffic through large and mature networks becomes more and more effective and economically sustainable against DDoS.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://research.sprintlabs.com/publications/uploads/RR04-ATL-013177.pdf |title=DDoS Mitigation via Regional Cleaning Centers (Jan 2004) |work=SprintLabs.com |publisher=Sprint ATL Research |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921012859/http://research.sprintlabs.com/publications/uploads/RR04-ATL-013177.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-21 |accessdate=2011-12-02}}<!-- use archive due to outage--></ref>\n\n==Unintentional denial-of-service==\nAn unintentional denial-of-service can occur when a system ends up denied, not due to a deliberate attack by a single individual or group of individuals, but simply due to a sudden enormous spike in popularity. This can happen when an extremely popular website posts a prominent link to a second, less well-prepared site, for example, as part of a news story. The result is that a significant proportion of the primary site's regular users{{spaced ndash}}potentially hundreds of thousands of people{{spaced ndash}}click that link in the space of a few hours, having the same effect on the target website as a DDoS attack. A VIPDoS is the same, but specifically when the link was posted by a celebrity.\n\nWhen [[Death of Michael Jackson|Michael Jackson died]] in 2009, websites such as Google and Twitter slowed down or even crashed.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8120324.stm | work=BBC News | first=Maggie | last=Shiels | title=Web slows after Jackson's death | date=2009-06-26}}</ref> Many sites' servers thought the requests were from a virus or spyware trying to cause a denial-of-service attack, warning users that their queries looked like \"automated requests from a [[computer virus]] or spyware application\".<ref>{{cite web |url=<!--last updated February 06, 2013-->http://productforums.google.com/forum/?#!category-topic/websearch/unexpected-search-results/uFcXXixhiBw |title=We're Sorry.

The canonical example is the [[Slashdot effect]] when receiving traffic from [[Slashdot]]. It is also known as \"the [[Reddit]] hug of death\" and \"the [[Digg]] effect\".\n\nRouters have also been known to create unintentional DoS attacks, as both [[D-Link]] and [[Netgear]] routers have overloaded NTP servers by flooding NTP servers without respecting the restrictions of client types or geographical limitations.\n\nSimilar unintentional denials-of-service can also occur via other media, e.g. when a URL is mentioned on television. If a server is being indexed by [[Google]] or another [[search engine]] during peak periods of activity, or does not have a lot of available bandwidth while being indexed, it can also experience the effects of a DoS attack.<ref name=\":0\" />{{citation needed|reason=I've never seen Google send more than one request per minute to my server, usually much less often than that.  Other crawlers may be more aggressive though.  Do we have a reliable source about this?|date=March 2013}}\n\nLegal action has been taken in at least one such case. In 2006, [[Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment|Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment Corporation]] sued [[YouTube]]: massive numbers of would-be YouTube.com users accidentally typed the tube company's URL, utube.com. As a result, the tube company ended up having to spend large amounts of money on upgrading their bandwidth.<ref>{{cite news |title=YouTube sued by sound-alike site |work=BBC News |date=2006-11-02 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6108502.stm }}</ref> The company appears to have taken advantage of the situation, with utube.com now containing ads for advertisement revenue.\n\nIn March 2014, after [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]] went missing, [[DigitalGlobe]] launched a [[crowdsourcing]] service on which users could help search for the missing jet in satellite images.

This might be a university website setting the grades to be available where it will result in many more login requests at that time than any other.\n\n==Side effects of attacks==\n\n===Backscatter===\n{{see also|Backscatter (email)|Internet background noise}}\nIn computer network security, backscatter is a side-effect of a spoofed denial-of-service attack. In this kind of attack, the attacker spoofs (or forges) the source address in [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] sent to the victim. In general, the victim machine cannot distinguish between the spoofed packets and legitimate packets, so the victim responds to the spoofed packets as it normally would. These response packets are known as backscatter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caida.org/publications/animations/ |work=Animations |title=Backscatter Analysis (2001) |type=video |publisher=[[Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis]] |accessdate=December 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIf the attacker is spoofing source addresses randomly, the backscatter response packets from the victim will be sent back to random destinations. This effect can be used by [[network telescope]]s as indirect evidence of such attacks.\n\nThe term \"backscatter analysis\" refers to observing backscatter packets arriving at a statistically significant portion of the [[IP address]] space to determine characteristics of DoS attacks and victims.\n\n==Legality==\n[[File:FBI DDoS domain seized.png|thumb|Numerous websites offering tools to conduct a DDoS attack were seized by the FBI under the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]].<ref>{{cite web|title=FBI Seizes 15 DDoS-For-Hire Websites|url=https://kotaku.com/fbi-seizes-15-ddos-for-hire-websites-1831239141|website=Kotaku|date=6 January 2019}}</ref>]]\n{{see also|Computer crime}}\nMany jurisdictions have laws under which denial-of-service attacks are illegal.\n\n* In the US, denial-of-service attacks may be considered a federal crime under the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]] with penalties that include years of imprisonment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title18/html/USCODE-2010-title18-partI-chap47-sec1030.htm |title=United States Code: Title 18,1030.

The model is a product of the Open Systems Interconnection project at the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO). The model groups similar communication functions into one of seven logical layers. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the communications path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that traverse that path.\n\nIn the OSI model, the definition of its [[application layer]] is narrower in scope than is often implemented. The OSI model defines the application layer as being the user interface. The OSI application layer is responsible for displaying data and images to the user in a human-recognizable format and to interface with the [[presentation layer]] below it. In an implementation, the application and presentation layers are frequently combined.\n\n====Method of attack====\nAn application layer DDoS attack is done mainly for specific targeted purposes, including disrupting transactions and access to databases. It requires fewer resources than network layer attacks but often accompanies them.<ref>{{cite news |last=Higgins |first=Kelly Jackson |coauthors= |title=DDoS Attack Used \u2018Headless\u2019 Browser In 150-Hour Siege |newspaper=Dark Reading |location= |pages= |language= |publisher=InformationWeek |date=17 October 2013 |url=http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/ddos-attack-used-headless-browsers-in-15/240162777 |accessdate=28 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122165039/http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/ddos-attack-used-headless-browsers-in-15/240162777 |archivedate=January 22, 2014 |df= }}</ref> An attack may be disguised to look like legitimate traffic, except it targets specific application packets or functions.

Bandwidth-saturating floods rely on the attacker's ability to generate the overwhelming flux of packets. A common way of achieving this today is via distributed denial-of-service, employing a [[botnet]]. \n\n===Attack tools===\nIn cases such as [[MyDoom]] and [[Slowloris (computer security)|Slowloris]] the tools are embedded in [[malware]] and launch their attacks without the knowledge of the system owner. [[Stacheldraht]] is a classic example of a DDoS tool. It uses a layered structure where the attacker uses a [[Client (computing)|client program]] to connect to handlers which are compromised systems that issue commands to the [[Zombie computer|zombie agents]] which in turn facilitate the DDoS attack. Agents are compromised via the handlers by the attacker using automated routines to exploit vulnerabilities in programs that accept remote connections running on the targeted remote hosts. Each handler can control up to a thousand agents.<ref name=\"Dittrich\" />\n\nIn other cases a machine may become part of a DDoS attack with the owner's consent, for example, in [[Operation Payback]] organized by the group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. The [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon]] has typically been used in this way. Along with [[High Orbit Ion Cannon]] a wide variety of DDoS tools are available today, including paid and free versions, with different features available. There is an underground market for these in hacker related forums and IRC channels.\n\n===Application-layer attacks===\nApplication-layer attacks employ DoS-causing [[exploit (computer security)|exploits]] and can cause server-running software to fill the disk space or consume all available memory or [[CPU time]]. Attacks may use specific packet types or connection requests to saturate finite resources by, for example, occupying the maximum number of open connections or filling the victim's disk space with logs. An attacker with shell-level access to a victim's computer may slow it until it is unusable or crash it by using a [[fork bomb]]. Another kind of application-level DoS attack is [[XDoS]] (or XML DoS) which can be controlled by modern web [[application firewall]]s (WAFs).\n\nAnother target of DDoS attacks may be to produce added costs for the application operator, when the latter uses resources based on [[cloud computing]]. In this case normally application-used resources are tied to a needed quality of service (QoS) level (e.g. responses should be less than 200&nbsp;ms) and this rule is usually linked to automated software (e.g. Amazon CloudWatch<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/|title=Amazon CloudWatch|work=Amazon Web Services, Inc.}}</ref>) to raise more virtual resources from the provider in order to meet the defined QoS levels for the increased requests. The main incentive behind such attacks may be to drive the application owner to raise the elasticity levels in order to handle the increased application traffic, in order to cause financial losses or force them to become less competitive. \n\nA ''banana attack'' is another particular type of DoS. It involves redirecting outgoing messages from the client back onto the client, preventing outside access, as well as flooding the client with the sent packets. A [[LAND]] attack is of this type.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n===Degradation-of-service attacks===\n\"Pulsing\" zombies are compromised computers that are directed to launch intermittent and short-lived floodings of victim websites with the intent of merely slowing it rather than crashing it. This type of attack, referred to as \"degradation-of-service\" rather than \"denial-of-service\", can be more difficult to detect than regular zombie invasions and can disrupt and hamper connection to websites for prolonged periods of time, potentially causing more disruption than concentrated floods.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia Of Information Technology |page=397 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Distributors |year=2007 |isbn=978-81-269-0752-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Internet and the Law |year=2006 |page=325 |first=Aaron |last=Schwabach |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-731-9}}</ref> Exposure of degradation-of-service attacks is complicated further by the matter of discerning whether the server is really being attacked or under normal traffic loads.<ref>{{cite book|title=Networking and Mobile Computing |first=Xicheng |last=Lu |author2=Wei Zhao |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user |year=2005 |isbn=978-3-540-28102-3 |page=424}}</ref>\n\n===Denial-of-service Level II===\nThe goal of DoS L2 (possibly DDoS) attack is to cause a launching of a defense mechanism which blocks the network segment from which the attack originated. In case of distributed attack or IP header modification (that depends on the kind of security behavior) it will fully block the attacked network from the Internet, but without system crash.<ref name=\":0\" />{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Distributed DoS attack===\nA distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers.<ref name=\"Taghavi Zargar 2046\u20132069\"/> Such an attack is often the result of multiple compromised systems (for example, a botnet) flooding the targeted system with traffic. A botnet is a network of zombie computers programmed to receive commands without the owners' knowledge.<ref>{{cite news|title=Has Your Website Been Bitten By a Zombie?|url=http://blog.cloudbric.com/2015/08/has-your-website-been-bitten-by-zombie.html|accessdate=15 September 2015|agency=Cloudbric|date=3 August 2015}}</ref> When a server is overloaded with connections, new connections can no longer be accepted. The major advantages to an attacker of using a distributed denial-of-service attack are that multiple machines can generate more attack traffic than one machine, multiple attack machines are harder to turn off than one attack machine, and that the behavior of each attack machine can be stealthier, making it harder to track and shut down. These attacker advantages cause challenges for defense mechanisms. For example, merely purchasing more incoming bandwidth than the current volume of the attack might not help, because the attacker might be able to simply add more attack machines. This, after all, will end up completely crashing a website for periods of time.\n\nMalware can carry DDoS attack mechanisms; one of the better-known examples of this was [[MyDoom]]. Its DoS mechanism was triggered on a specific date and time. This type of DDoS involved hardcoding the target IP address prior to release of the malware and no further interaction was necessary to launch the attack.\n\nA system may also be compromised with a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan]], allowing the attacker to download a [[Zombie computer|zombie agent]], or the trojan may contain one. Attackers can also break into systems using automated tools that exploit flaws in programs that listen for connections from remote hosts. This scenario primarily concerns systems acting as servers on the web. [[Stacheldraht]] is a classic example of a DDoS tool. It uses a layered structure where the attacker uses a [[Client (computing)|client program]] to connect to handlers, which are compromised systems that issue commands to the [[Zombie computer|zombie agents]], which in turn facilitate the DDoS attack. Agents are compromised via the handlers by the attacker, using automated routines to exploit vulnerabilities in programs that accept remote connections running on the targeted remote hosts. Each handler can control up to a thousand agents.<ref name=\"Dittrich\">{{cite web|url=http://staff.washington.edu/dittrich/misc/stacheldraht.analysis.txt |title=The \"stacheldraht\" distributed denial of service attack tool |first=David |last=Dittrich |publisher=University of Washington |date=December 31, 1999 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref> In some cases a machine may become part of a DDoS attack with the owner's consent, for example, in [[Operation Payback]], organized by the group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. These attacks can use different types of internet packets such as: TCP, UDP, ICMP etc.\n\nThese collections of systems compromisers are known as [[botnet]]s / [[rootserver]]s. DDoS tools like [[Stacheldraht]] still use classic DoS attack methods centered on [[IP spoofing]] and amplification like [[smurf attack]]s and [[fraggle attack]]s (these are also known as bandwidth consumption attacks). [[SYN flood]]s (also known as resource starvation attacks) may also be used. Newer tools can use DNS servers for DoS purposes. Unlike MyDoom's DDoS mechanism, botnets can be turned against any IP address.

These flood attacks do not require completion of the TCP [[Three way handshake#Connection establishment|three way handshake]] and attempt to exhaust the destination SYN queue or the server bandwidth. Because the source IP addresses can be trivially spoofed, an attack could come from a limited set of sources, or may even originate from a single host. Stack enhancements such as [[syn cookies]] may be effective mitigation against SYN queue flooding, however complete bandwidth exhaustion may require involvement.{{elucidate|date=May 2011}}\n\nIf an attacker mounts an attack from a single host it would be classified as a DoS attack. In fact, any attack against availability would be classed as a denial-of-service attack. On the other hand, if an attacker uses many systems to simultaneously launch attacks against a remote host, this would be classified as a DDoS attack.\n\nIt has been reported that there are new attacks from [[internet of things]] (IoT) devices which have been involved in denial of service attacks.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehackernews.com/2015/10/cctv-camera-hacking.html|title=Hacking CCTV Cameras to Launch DDoS Attacks|author=Swati Khandelwal|date=23 October 2015|work=The Hacker News}}</ref>\nIn one noted attack that was made peaked at around 20,000 requests per second which came from around 900 CCTV cameras.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.incapsula.com/blog/cctv-ddos-botnet-back-yard.html|title=CCTV DDoS Botnet In Our Own Back Yard|first1=Igal|last1=Zeifman|first2=Ofer|last2=Gayer|first3=Or|last3=Wilder|website=incapsula.com|date=21 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nUK's [[GCHQ]] has tools built for DDoS, named PREDATORS FACE and ROLLING THUNDER.<ref name=\"firstlook.org\">{{cite web |date=2014-07-15 |author= Glenn Greenwald |url=https://theintercept.com/2014/07/14/manipulating-online-polls-ways-british-spies-seek-control-internet/ |title=HACKING ONLINE POLLS AND OTHER WAYS BRITISH SPIES SEEK TO CONTROL THE INTERNET |website=The Intercept_ |accessdate=2015-12-25}}</ref>\n\n===DDoS extortion===\nIn 2015, DDoS botnets such as DD4BC grew in prominence, taking aim at financial institutions.<ref>{{cite news|title=Who's Behind DDoS Attacks and How Can You Protect Your Website?|url=http://blog.cloudbric.com/2015/09/whos-behind-ddos-attacks-and-how-can.html|accessdate=15 September 2015|agency=Cloudbric|date=10 September 2015}}</ref> Cyber-extortionists typically begin with a low-level attack and a warning that a larger attack will be carried out if a ransom is not paid in [[Bitcoin]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=Cyber-Extortionists Targeting the Financial Sector Are Demanding Bitcoin Ransoms|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-09/bitcoin-ddos-ransom-demands-raise-dd4bc-profile?mod=djemRiskCompliance|accessdate=15 September 2015|agency=Bloomberg|date=9 September 2015}}</ref> Security experts recommend targeted websites to not pay the ransom.

However, the attacker then proceeds to send the actual message body at an extremely slow rate (e.g. 1 byte/110 seconds). Due to the entire message being correct and complete, the target server will attempt to obey the 'Content-Length' field in the header, and wait for the entire body of the message to be transmitted, which can take a very long time. The attacker establishes hundreds or even thousands of such connections, until all resources for incoming connections on the server (the victim) are used up, hence making any further (including legitimate) connections impossible until all data has been sent. It is notable that unlike many other (D)DoS attacks, which try to subdue the server by overloading its network or CPU, a HTTP Slow POST attack targets the ''logical'' resources of the victim, which means the victim would still have enough network bandwidth and processing power to operate.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.owasp.org/images/4/43/Layer_7_DDOS.pdf|title=OWASP Plan - Strawman - Layer_7_DDOS.pdf|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=18 March 2014|website= Open Web Application Security Project|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref> Further combined with the fact that [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] will, by default, accept requests up to 2GB in size, this attack can be particularly powerful.

The process typically involves an attacker sending a DNS name look up request to a public DNS server, spoofing the source IP address of the targeted victim. The attacker tries to request as much information as possible, thus amplifying the DNS response that is sent to the targeted victim. Since the size of the request is significantly smaller than the response, the attacker is easily able to increase the amount of traffic directed at the target.<ref>{{cite web |year=2006|url=http://www.isotf.org/news/DNS-Amplification-Attacks.pdf |title=DNS Amplification Attacks |publisher=ISOTF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214074629/http://www.isotf.org/news/DNS-Amplification-Attacks.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-14|author1=Vaughn, Randal |author2=Evron, Gadi }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=July 8, 2013 |title=Alert (TA13-088A) DNS Amplification Attacks |publisher=US-CERT |url=http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A |accessdate=2013-07-17}}</ref> SNMP and [[Network Time Protocol|NTP]] can also be exploited as reflector in an amplification attack.\n\nAn example of an amplified DDoS attack through the [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP) is through a command called monlist, which sends the details of the last 600 hosts that have requested the time from the NTP server back to the requester. A small request to this time server can be sent using a spoofed source IP address of some victim, which results in a response 556.9 times the size of the request being sent to the victim. This becomes amplified when using botnets that all send requests with the same spoofed IP source, which will result a massive amount of data being sent back to the victim.\n\nIt is very difficult to defend against these types of attacks because the response data is coming from legitimate servers. These attack requests are also sent through UDP, which does not require a connection to the server. This means that the source IP is not verified when a request is received by the server. In order to bring awareness of these vulnerabilities, campaigns have been started that are dedicated to finding amplification vectors which has led to people fixing their resolvers or having the resolvers shut down completely.\n\n=== Mirai botnet ===\nThis attack works by using a worm to infect hundreds of thousands of IoT devices across the internet.

Each of these packets are handled like a connection request, causing the server to spawn a [[half-open connection]], by sending back a TCP/SYN-ACK packet (Acknowledge), and waiting for a packet in response from the sender address (response to the ACK Packet). However, because the sender address is forged, the response never comes. These half-open connections saturate the number of available connections the server can make, keeping it from responding to legitimate requests until after the attack ends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4987 |title=TCP SYN Flooding Attacks and Common Mitigations |website=Tools.ietf.org |date=August 2007 |accessdate=2011-12-02 |rfc=4987}}</ref>\n\n===Teardrop attacks===\nA teardrop attack involves sending [[Mangled packet|mangled]] [[Internet Protocol|IP]] fragments with overlapping, oversized payloads to the target machine. This can crash various operating systems because of a bug in their [[TCP/IP]] [[IPv4#Fragmentation and reassembly|fragmentation re-assembly]] code.<ref name=\"CERT-1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cert.org/historical/advisories/ca-1997-28.cfm|title=CERT Advisory CA-1997-28 IP Denial-of-Service Attacks|accessdate=July 18, 2014|publisher=CERT|year=1998}}</ref> [[Windows 3.1x]], [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows NT]] operating systems, as well as versions of [[Linux]] prior to versions 2.0.32 and 2.1.63 are vulnerable to this attack.\n\n(Although in September 2009, a vulnerability in [[Windows Vista]] was referred to as a \"teardrop attack\", this targeted [[Server Message Block|SMB2]] which is a higher layer than the TCP packets that teardrop used).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/windows-7-vista-exposed-to-teardrop-attack/4222 |title=Windows 7, Vista exposed to 'teardrop attack' |work=ZDNet |date=September 8, 2009 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/975497.mspx |title=Microsoft Security Advisory (975497): Vulnerabilities in SMB Could Allow Remote Code Execution |publisher=Microsoft.com |date=September 8, 2009 <!--last updated February 06, 2013-->|accessdate=2011-12-02}}</ref>\n\nOne of the fields in an IP header is the \u201cfragment offset\u201d field, indicating the starting position, or offset, of the data contained in a fragmented packet relative to the data in the original packet. If the sum of the offset and size of one fragmented packet differs from that of the next fragmented packet, the packets overlap. When this happens, a server vulnerable to teardrop attacks is unable to reassemble the packets - resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\n\n===Telephony denial-of-service (TDoS)===\n[[Voice over IP]] has made abusive origination of large numbers of [[telephone]] voice calls inexpensive and readily automated while permitting call origins to be misrepresented through [[caller ID spoofing]].\n\nAccording to the US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], telephony denial-of-service (TDoS) has appeared as part of various fraudulent schemes:\n* A scammer contacts the victim's banker or broker, impersonating the victim to request a funds transfer. The banker's attempt to contact the victim for verification of the transfer fails as the victim's telephone lines are being flooded with thousands of bogus calls, rendering the victim unreachable.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/newark/press-releases/2010/nk051110.htm |title=FBI \u2014 Phony Phone Calls Distract Consumers from Genuine Theft |publisher=FBI.gov |date=2010-05-11 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>\n* A scammer contacts consumers with a bogus claim to collect an outstanding [[payday loan]] for thousands of dollars. When the consumer objects, the scammer retaliates by flooding the victim's employer with thousands of automated calls. In some cases, displayed caller ID is spoofed to impersonate police or law enforcement agencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ic3.gov/media/2013/130107.aspx |title= Internet Crime Complaint Center's (IC3) Scam Alerts January 7, 2013 |work=IC3.gov |date=2013-01-07 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>\n* A scammer contacts consumers with a bogus debt collection demand and threatens to send police; when the victim balks, the scammer floods local police numbers with calls on which caller ID is spoofed to display the victim's number. Police soon arrive at the victim's residence attempting to find the origin of the calls.\n\nTelephony denial-of-service can exist even without [[Internet telephony]]. In the [[2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal]], [[telemarketing|telemarketers]] were used to flood political opponents with spurious calls to jam phone banks on election day. Widespread publication of a number can also flood it with enough calls to render it unusable, as happened by accident in 1981 with multiple +1-[[area code]]-867-5309 subscribers inundated by hundreds of misdialed calls daily in response to the song [[867-5309/Jenny]].\n\nTDoS differs from other [[telephone harassment]] (such as [[prank call]]s and [[obscene phone call]]s) by the number of calls originated; by occupying lines continuously with repeated automated calls, the victim is prevented from making or receiving both routine and emergency telephone calls.\n\nRelated exploits include [[SMS flooding]] attacks and [[black fax]] or fax loop transmission.\n\n=== TTL expiry attack ===\nIt takes more router resources to drop a packet with a TTL value of 1 or less than it does to forward a packet with higher TTL value. When a packet is dropped due to TTL expiry, the router CPU must generate and send an [[ICMP time exceeded]] response. Generating many of these responses can overload the router's CPU.<ref>{{cite web |title=TTL Expiry Attack Identification and Mitigation |url=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ttl-expiry-attack.html |publisher=[[Cisco Systems]] |access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>\n\n=== UPnP attack ===\nThis attack uses an existing vulnerability in [[Universal Plug and Play]] (UPnP) protocol to get around a considerable amount of the present defense methods and flood a target's network and servers. The attack is based on a DNS amplification technique, but the attack mechanism is a UPnP router which forwards requests from one outer source to another disregarding UPnP behavior rules. Using the UPnP router returns the data on an unexpected UDP port from a bogus IP address, making it harder to take simple action to shut down the traffic flood. According to the [[Imperva]] researchers, the most effective way to stop this attack is for companies to lock down UPnP routers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.darkreading.com/new-ddos-attack-method-leverages-upnp/d/d-id/1331799|title=New DDoS Attack Method Leverages UPnP|work=Dark Reading|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.imperva.com/blog/2018/05/new-ddos-attack-method-demands-a-fresh-approach-to-amplification-assault-mitigation/|title=New DDoS Attack Method Demands a Fresh Approach to Amplification Assault Mitigation \u2013 Blog {{!}} Imperva|date=2018-05-14|work=Blog {{!}} Imperva|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Defense techniques==\nDefensive responses to denial-of-service attacks typically involve the use of a combination of attack detection, traffic classification and response tools, aiming to block traffic that they identify as illegitimate and allow traffic that they identify as legitimate.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Loukas | first1 = G. | last2 = Oke | first2 = G. | doi = 10.1093/comjnl/bxp078 | title = Protection Against Denial of Service Attacks: A Survey | journal = [[The Computer Journal|Comput.

It can be used on networks in conjunction with routers and switches. Application front end hardware analyzes data packets as they enter the system, and then identifies them as priority, regular, or dangerous. There are more than 25 [[bandwidth management]] vendors.\n\n===Application level Key Completion Indicators===\n{{original research|section|date=March 2018|the analogy is complex enough that it should be sourced}}\nApproaches to DDoS attacks against cloud-based applications may be based on an application layer analysis, indicating whether incoming bulk traffic is legitimate and thus triggering elasticity decisions without the economical implications of a DDoS attack.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Alqahtani|first1=S.|last2=Gamble|first2=R. F.|title=DDoS Attacks in Service Clouds|journal=2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)|date=1 January 2015|pages=5331\u20135340|doi=10.1109/HICSS.2015.627|isbn=978-1-4799-7367-5}}</ref> These approaches mainly rely on an identified path of value inside the application and monitor the progress of requests on this path, through markers called Key Completion Indicators.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kousiouris|first=George|title=KEY COMPLETION INDICATORS:minimizing the effect of DoS attacks on elastic Cloud-based applications based on application-level markov chain checkpoints |newspaper=CLOSER Conference|date=2014|doi=10.5220/0004963006220628}}</ref>\n\nIn essence, these technique are statistical methods of assessing the behavior of incoming requests to detect if something unusual or abnormal is going on.\n\nAn analogy is to a bricks-and-mortar department store where customers spend, on average, a known percentage of their time on different activities such as picking up items and examining them, putting them back, filling a basket, waiting to pay, paying, and leaving. These high-level activities correspond to the Key Completion Indicators in a service or site, and once normal behavior is determined, abnormal behavior can be identified. If a mob of customers arrived in store and spent all their time picking up items and putting them back, but never made any purchases, this could be flagged as unusual behavior.\n\nThe department store can attempt to adjust to periods of high activity by bringing in a reserve of employees at short notice. But if it did this routinely, were a mob to start showing up but never buying anything, this could ruin the store with the extra employee costs. Soon the store would identify the mob activity and scale back the number of employees, recognising that the mob provides no profit and should not be served. While this may make it more difficult for legitimate customers to get served during the mob's presence, it saves the store from total ruin.\n\nIn the case of elastic cloud services where a huge and abnormal additional workload may incur significant charges from the cloud service provider, this technique can be used to scale back or even stop the expansion of server availability to protect from economic loss.\n\n===Blackholing and sinkholing===\nWith [[blackhole routing]], all the traffic to the attacked DNS or IP address is sent to a \"black hole\" (null interface or a non-existent server). To be more efficient and avoid affecting network connectivity, it can be managed by the ISP.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Patrikakis |first1=C. |last2=Masikos |first2=M. |last3=Zouraraki |first3=O. |title=Distributed Denial of Service Attacks |journal=The Internet Protocol Journal |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=13\u201335 |date=December 2004 |url=http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac123/ac147/archived_issues/ipj_7-4/dos_attacks.html}}</ref>\n\nA [[DNS sinkhole]] routes traffic to a valid IP address which analyzes traffic and rejects bad packets. Sinkholing is not efficient for most severe attacks.\n\n===IPS based prevention===\n[[Intrusion prevention system]]s (IPS) are effective if the attacks have signatures associated with them. However, the trend among the attacks is to have legitimate content but bad intent. Intrusion-prevention systems which work on content recognition cannot block behavior-based DoS attacks.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nAn [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] based IPS may detect and block denial-of-service attacks because they have the [[Bandwidth (computing)|processing power]] and the granularity to analyze the attacks and act like a [[circuit breaker]] in an automated way.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nA [[RateBasedIPS|rate-based IPS]] (RBIPS) must analyze traffic granularly and continuously monitor the traffic pattern and determine if there is traffic anomaly.

A DDS can also address both protocol attacks (such as teardrop and ping of death) and rate-based attacks (such as ICMP floods and SYN floods).\n\n===Firewalls===\nIn the case of a simple attack, a [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] could have a simple rule added to deny all incoming traffic from the attackers, based on protocols, ports or the originating IP addresses.\n\nMore complex attacks will however be hard to block with simple rules: for example, if there is an ongoing attack on port 80 (web service), it is not possible to drop all incoming traffic on this port because doing so will prevent the server from serving legitimate traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/94014/How_to_defend_against_DDoS_attacks|first=Paul |last=Froutan|title=How to defend against DDoS attacks|work=[[Computerworld]]|date=June 24, 2004|accessdate=May 15, 2010}}</ref> Additionally, firewalls may be too deep in the network hierarchy, with routers being adversely affected before the traffic gets to the firewall. Also, many security tools still do not support IPv6 or may not be configured properly, so the firewalls often might get bypassed during the attacks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252445613/Cyber-security-vulnerability-concerns-skyrocket|title=Cyber security vulnerability concerns skyrocket|work=ComputerWeekly.com|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n===Routers===\nSimilar to switches, routers have some rate-limiting and [[Access control list|ACL]] capability. They, too, are manually set. Most routers can be easily overwhelmed under a DoS attack. [[Cisco IOS]] has optional features that can reduce the impact of flooding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mehmet.suzen.googlepages.com/qos_ios_dos_suzen2005.pdf |title=Some IoS tips for Internet Service (Providers) |first=Mehmet |last=Suzen |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910202908/http://mehmet.suzen.googlepages.com/qos_ios_dos_suzen2005.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 }}</ref>\n\n===Switches===\nMost switches have some rate-limiting and [[Access control list|ACL]] capability. Some switches provide automatic and/or system-wide [[rate limiting]], [[traffic shaping]], [[delayed binding]] ([[TCP splicing]]), [[deep packet inspection]] and [[Bogon filtering]] (bogus IP filtering) to detect and remediate DoS attacks through automatic rate filtering and WAN Link failover and balancing.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nThese schemes will work as long as the DoS attacks can be prevented by using them. For example, SYN flood can be prevented using delayed binding or TCP splicing. Similarly content based DoS may be prevented using deep packet inspection. Attacks originating from [[Martian packet|dark addresses]] or going to dark addresses can be prevented using [[bogon filtering]]. Automatic rate filtering can work as long as set rate-thresholds have been set correctly. Wan-link failover will work as long as both links have DoS/DDoS prevention mechanism.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n===Upstream filtering===\nAll traffic is passed through a \"cleaning center\" or a \"scrubbing center\" via various methods such as proxies, tunnels, digital cross connects, or even direct circuits, which separates \"bad\" traffic (DDoS and also other common internet attacks) and only sends good traffic beyond to the server. The provider needs central connectivity to the Internet to manage this kind of service unless they happen to be located within the same facility as the \"cleaning center\" or \"scrubbing center\". DDoS attacks can overwhelm any type of hardware firewall, and passing malicious traffic through large and mature networks becomes more and more effective and economically sustainable against DDoS.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://research.sprintlabs.com/publications/uploads/RR04-ATL-013177.pdf |title=DDoS Mitigation via Regional Cleaning Centers (Jan 2004) |work=SprintLabs.com |publisher=Sprint ATL Research |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921012859/http://research.sprintlabs.com/publications/uploads/RR04-ATL-013177.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-21 |accessdate=2011-12-02}}<!-- use archive due to outage--></ref>\n\n==Unintentional denial-of-service==\nAn unintentional denial-of-service can occur when a system ends up denied, not due to a deliberate attack by a single individual or group of individuals, but simply due to a sudden enormous spike in popularity. This can happen when an extremely popular website posts a prominent link to a second, less well-prepared site, for example, as part of a news story. The result is that a significant proportion of the primary site's regular users{{spaced ndash}}potentially hundreds of thousands of people{{spaced ndash}}click that link in the space of a few hours, having the same effect on the target website as a DDoS attack. A VIPDoS is the same, but specifically when the link was posted by a celebrity.\n\nWhen [[Death of Michael Jackson|Michael Jackson died]] in 2009, websites such as Google and Twitter slowed down or even crashed.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8120324.stm | work=BBC News | first=Maggie | last=Shiels | title=Web slows after Jackson's death | date=2009-06-26}}</ref> Many sites' servers thought the requests were from a virus or spyware trying to cause a denial-of-service attack, warning users that their queries looked like \"automated requests from a [[computer virus]] or spyware application\".<ref>{{cite web |url=<!--last updated February 06, 2013-->http://productforums.google.com/forum/?#!category-topic/websearch/unexpected-search-results/uFcXXixhiBw |title=We're Sorry.

If a server is being indexed by [[Google]] or another [[search engine]] during peak periods of activity, or does not have a lot of available bandwidth while being indexed, it can also experience the effects of a DoS attack.<ref name=\":0\" />{{citation needed|reason=I've never seen Google send more than one request per minute to my server, usually much less often than that.

In this kind of attack, the attacker spoofs (or forges) the source address in [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] sent to the victim.

He remained there, improving the fortifications at his own expense, until his father's death in early 1544. He returned to England to assume the earldom, and was made a [[Knight of the Garter]]. War with France soon brought him back to the continent, where he spent much of 1544. He then returned to England, where the king appointed him [[Lord Chamberlain]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=707}}\n\n==Edward VI==\nAfter King Henry's death in 1547, the Earl was [[Lord High Constable of England|Lord High Constable]] at [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]'s coronation. He continued as Lord Chamberlain, and in addition, by the terms of Henry's will, was designated one of the council of 12 assistant executors. Under the new King's uncle, [[Lord Protector]] [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]], Arundel's influence diminished, and he soon became an advocate of Somerset's removal.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=707}}\n\n[[File:Henry FitzAlan, 12th Earl of Arundel) by Hans Eworth.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Henry Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel, dressed as a Roman Emperor, by [[Hans Eworth]], 1550.]]\n\nSomerset was deposed and sent to the [[Tower of London]] in October 1549, with Arundel, [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton]], and [[John Dudley, Earl of Warwick]] (later Duke of Northumberland) among the leaders of the new governing group.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} In early 1550 Warwick removed Arundel and Southampton, who were religious conservatives, from office. Arundel was placed under house arrest under dubious charges of [[peculation]]. He was also fined \u00a312,000, \u00a38,000 of which was later remitted. Within a few months he was cleared of the charges, but the experience pushed him into the camp of the Duke of Somerset, who had been released from the Tower and readmitted to the [[Privy Council]]. When Somerset was again arrested in 1551, Arundel was implicated in some of his plots, and was himself arrested and imprisoned for a year. He was eventually pardoned, again heavily fined, and returned to his place on the Council in May 1553.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=707}}\n\n==Intrigues under Mary==\nKing Edward's health was seriously declining, and on 21 June 1553 Arundel was among those who signed Edward's [[letters patent]] which conferred the succession on [[Lady Jane Grey]]. After the King's death, and after Northumberland had left London, however, together with the [[William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1501\u20131570)|Earl of Pembroke]], he worked for the proclamation of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] on 19 July 1553. Arundel tricked Northumberland into attacking Mary, then called an assembly of the leaders of the city, denounced Northumberland, and had Mary proclaimed queen. Taking the great seal and a letter of submission by the Council, he then rode off to [[Framlingham]], where Mary was staying. He then secured Northumberland in [[Cambridge]], and returned to London with Mary.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=707}}\n\nAt Mary's coronation, Arundel was for the second time High Constable, and was then appointed [[Lord Steward]] of the royal household. He served in various roles in her court, being, for example, one of the nobles who received her husband [[Philip II of Spain]] when he landed at Southampton. Later, he presided at the trial of the [[Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk|duke of Suffolk]], assisted in suppressing [[Wyatt's rebellion]] in 1554, was dispatched on foreign missions, and in September 1555 accompanied Philip to [[Brussels]]. The same year he and others received a charter under the name of [[Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands]], for the discovery of unknown lands, and was made high steward of the [[University of Oxford]], being chosen chancellor in 1559, but resigning his office in the same year. In 1557, on the prospect of the war with France, he was appointed lieutenant-general of the forces for the defence of the country, and in 1558 attended the conference for the negotiation of a peace. He returned to England on the death of Mary in November 1558.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=707}} \n\n==Positions under Elizabeth==\nAlthough [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] did not trust him, he was too powerful to be slighted or ignored, and so he was retained in his various offices when she ascended the throne. For the third time, he had a high place at a royal coronation. However, as a Roman Catholic, he opposed the arrest of his co-religionists and the war with Scotland. He incurred the queen's displeasure in 1562 by holding a meeting at his house during her illness to consider the question of the succession and promote the claims of Lady Catherine Grey. In 1564, being suspected of intrigues against the government, he was dismissed from the lord-stewardship and confined to his house, but was restored to favour in December.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=707}}\n\nIn March 1566 he went to [[Padua]], but being summoned back by the queen he returned to London on the 17th of April 1567. The following year he served on the commission of inquiry into the charges against [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. Subsequently, he furthered the marriage of his daughter Mary with [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|the Duke of Norfolk]], together with the restoration of the Roman Catholic religion and government, and deposition of Elizabeth, in collusion with Spain. He made use of an international incident in 1568 as a means of effecting [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil's]] overthrow, and urged upon the Spanish government the stoppage of trade.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=707}}\n\nIn January he alarmed Elizabeth by communicating to her a supposed Spanish project for aiding Mary and replacing her on her throne, and put before the queen in writing his own objections to the adoption of extreme measures against her. In September, on the discovery of Norfolk's plot, he was arrested, but not having committed himself sufficiently to incur the charge of treason in the rebellion he escaped punishment, was released in March 1570, and was recalled by [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] to the council with the aim of embarrassing Cecil. He again renewed his intrigues, which were at length to some extent exposed by the discovery of the [[Ridolfi plot]] in September 1571. He was once more arrested, and not liberated till December 1572 after Norfolk's execution.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=707}}\n\nHe died on the 24th of February 1580, and was buried in the chapel at [[Arundel Castle]], where a monument was erected to his memory.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=707}}\n \n[[Coach (carriage)|Coaches]] were introduced into England from France by Henry Fitzalan, who travelled widely on the Continent in the mid-1560s.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rvkxAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=%22matthias+corvinus%22+coach+-bus&source=bl&ots=k4wnJw7XNv&sig=o26ePQ-1-BXqNAUM1N5xFjoMeBc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VLqkT67eD8ntsgaD4YWcBQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22matthias%20corvinus%22%20coach%20-bus&f=false Matthias Corvinus]</ref>\n\n==Marriage and children==\n\nHenry Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel, was first married to Katherine Grey, daughter of [[Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset]], and [[Margaret Wotton]].

He remained there, improving the fortifications at his own expense, until his father's death in early 1544. He returned to England to assume the earldom, and was made a [[Knight of the Garter]]. War with France soon brought him back to the continent, where he spent much of 1544. He then returned to England, where the king appointed him [[Lord Chamberlain]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=707}}\n\n==Edward VI==\nAfter King Henry's death in 1547, the Earl was [[Lord High Constable of England|Lord High Constable]] at [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]'s coronation. He continued as Lord Chamberlain, and in addition, by the terms of Henry's will, was designated one of the council of 12 assistant executors. Under the new King's uncle, [[Lord Protector]] [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]], Arundel's influence diminished, and he soon became an advocate of Somerset's removal.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=707}}\n\n[[File:Henry FitzAlan, 12th Earl of Arundel) by Hans Eworth.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Henry Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel, dressed as a Roman Emperor, by [[Hans Eworth]], 1550.]]\n\nSomerset was deposed and sent to the [[Tower of London]] in October 1549, with Arundel, [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton]], and [[John Dudley, Earl of Warwick]] (later Duke of Northumberland) among the leaders of the new governing group.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} In early 1550 Warwick removed Arundel and Southampton, who were religious conservatives, from office. Arundel was placed under house arrest under dubious charges of [[peculation]]. He was also fined \u00a312,000, \u00a38,000 of which was later remitted. Within a few months he was cleared of the charges, but the experience pushed him into the camp of the Duke of Somerset, who had been released from the Tower and readmitted to the [[Privy Council]]. When Somerset was again arrested in 1551, Arundel was implicated in some of his plots, and was himself arrested and imprisoned for a year. He was eventually pardoned, again heavily fined, and returned to his place on the Council in May 1553.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=707}}\n\n==Intrigues under Mary==\nKing Edward's health was seriously declining, and on 21 June 1553 Arundel was among those who signed Edward's [[letters patent]] which conferred the succession on [[Lady Jane Grey]]. After the King's death, and after Northumberland had left London, however, together with the [[William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1501\u20131570)|Earl of Pembroke]], he worked for the proclamation of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] on 19 July 1553. Arundel tricked Northumberland into attacking Mary, then called an assembly of the leaders of the city, denounced Northumberland, and had Mary proclaimed queen. Taking the great seal and a letter of submission by the Council, he then rode off to [[Framlingham]], where Mary was staying. He then secured Northumberland in [[Cambridge]], and returned to London with Mary.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=707}}\n\nAt Mary's coronation, Arundel was for the second time High Constable, and was then appointed [[Lord Steward]] of the royal household. He served in various roles in her court, being, for example, one of the nobles who received her husband [[Philip II of Spain]] when he landed at Southampton. Later, he presided at the trial of the [[Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk|duke of Suffolk]], assisted in suppressing [[Wyatt's rebellion]] in 1554, was dispatched on foreign missions, and in September 1555 accompanied Philip to [[Brussels]]. The same year he and others received a charter under the name of [[Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands]], for the discovery of unknown lands, and was made high steward of the [[University of Oxford]], being chosen chancellor in 1559, but resigning his office in the same year. In 1557, on the prospect of the war with France, he was appointed lieutenant-general of the forces for the defence of the country, and in 1558 attended the conference for the negotiation of a peace. He returned to England on the death of Mary in November 1558.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=707}} \n\n==Positions under Elizabeth==\nAlthough [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] did not trust him, he was too powerful to be slighted or ignored, and so he was retained in his various offices when she ascended the throne. For the third time, he had a high place at a royal coronation. However, as a Roman Catholic, he opposed the arrest of his co-religionists and the war with Scotland. He incurred the queen's displeasure in 1562 by holding a meeting at his house during her illness to consider the question of the succession and promote the claims of Lady Catherine Grey. In 1564, being suspected of intrigues against the government, he was dismissed from the lord-stewardship and confined to his house, but was restored to favour in December.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=707}}\n\nIn March 1566 he went to [[Padua]], but being summoned back by the queen he returned to London on the 17th of April 1567. The following year he served on the commission of inquiry into the charges against [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. Subsequently, he furthered the marriage of his daughter Mary with [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|the Duke of Norfolk]], together with the restoration of the Roman Catholic religion and government, and deposition of Elizabeth, in collusion with Spain. He made use of an international incident in 1568 as a means of effecting [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil's]] overthrow, and urged upon the Spanish government the stoppage of trade.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=707}}\n\nIn January he alarmed Elizabeth by communicating to her a supposed Spanish project for aiding Mary and replacing her on her throne, and put before the queen in writing his own objections to the adoption of extreme measures against her. In September, on the discovery of Norfolk's plot, he was arrested, but not having committed himself sufficiently to incur the charge of treason in the rebellion he escaped punishment, was released in March 1570, and was recalled by [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] to the council with the aim of embarrassing Cecil. He again renewed his intrigues, which were at length to some extent exposed by the discovery of the [[Ridolfi plot]] in September 1571. He was once more arrested, and not liberated till December 1572 after Norfolk's execution.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=707}}\n\nHe died on the 24th of February 1580, and was buried in the chapel at [[Arundel Castle]], where a monument was erected to his memory.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=707}}\n \n[[Coach (carriage)|Coaches]] were introduced into England from France by Henry Fitzalan, who travelled widely on the Continent in the mid-1560s.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rvkxAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=%22matthias+corvinus%22+coach+-bus&source=bl&ots=k4wnJw7XNv&sig=o26ePQ-1-BXqNAUM1N5xFjoMeBc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VLqkT67eD8ntsgaD4YWcBQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22matthias%20corvinus%22%20coach%20-bus&f=false Matthias Corvinus]</ref>\n\n==Marriage and children==\n\nHenry Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel, was first married to Katherine Grey, daughter of [[Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset]], and [[Margaret Wotton]].

He is mostly known in the Indian subcontinent for the [[Fable|Folk Tales]] which focus on his [[wit]]. Birbal was appointed by Akbar as a Minister (Mantri) and used to be a Poet and Singer in around 1556\u20131562. He had a close association with Emperor [[Akbar]] and was one of his most important courtiers, part of a group called the ''[[navaratnas]]'' (nine jewels of Akbar). In 1586, Birbal led an army to crush an unrest in the north-west [[Indian subcontinent]] where he was killed along with many troops in an ambush by the rebel tribe. He was the only Hindu to adopt [[Din-i Ilahi]], the religion founded by Akbar.\n\nBy the end of Akbar's reign, local folk tales emerged involving his interactions with Akbar, portraying him as being extremely clever and witty. As the tales gained popularity in India, he became even more of a legendary figure across the Indian subcontinent. These tales involve him outsmarting rival courtiers and sometimes even Akbar, using only his intelligence and cunning, often with giving witty and humorous responses and impressing Akbar.\n\n==Early life==\nBirbal was born as Mahesh Das Brahmbhatt in 1528, to a [[Hindu]] [[Kayastha]] family<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gOkXAAAAIAAJ&q=Birbal+brahmin&dq=Birbal+brahmin&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiR0Pvii6ffAhVHiHAKHcqgCzwQ6AEIUjAI Gayatri Rahasya: Or, An Exposition of the Gayatri]</ref> in [[Kalpi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], India;<ref name=\"Khanna, Culture of Medieval India\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbKv3zyIFD8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Cultural History of Medieval India |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-81-87358-30-5 |editor-last=Meenakshi Khanna |pages=24\u201344 |chapter=Section 1: Kingship and Court Mixing the Classic with the Folk}}</ref>{{rp|29}} according to folklore, it was at Tikawanpur near the banks of river [[Yamuna River|Yamuna]].<ref name=\"SubramaniamFolktales\">{{Cite book |last=Neela Subramaniam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5zqiW0Bd1YC&pg=PP2 |title=Birbal Stories (32 pp) |publisher=Sura Books |isbn=978-81-7478-301-1 |page=2 |access-date=30 June 2013}}</ref> His father was Ganga Das and mother, Anabha Davito.

He occasionally challenges Birbal by giving him a line of poetry which Birbal has to complete. Some of the other stories are simple humorous anecdotes.

He is mostly known in the Indian subcontinent for the [[Fable|Folk Tales]] which focus on his [[wit]]. Birbal was appointed by Akbar as a Minister (Mantri) and used to be a Poet and Singer in around 1556\u20131562. He had a close association with Emperor [[Akbar]] and was one of his most important courtiers, part of a group called the ''[[navaratnas]]'' (nine jewels of Akbar). In 1586, Birbal led an army to crush an unrest in the north-west [[Indian subcontinent]] where he was killed along with many troops in an ambush by the rebel tribe. He was the only Hindu to adopt [[Din-i Ilahi]], the religion founded by Akbar.\n\nBy the end of Akbar's reign, local folk tales emerged involving his interactions with Akbar, portraying him as being extremely clever and witty. As the tales gained popularity in India, he became even more of a legendary figure across the Indian subcontinent. These tales involve him outsmarting rival courtiers and sometimes even Akbar, using only his intelligence and cunning, often with giving witty and humorous responses and impressing Akbar.\n\n==Early life==\nBirbal was born as Mahesh Das Brahmbhatt in 1528, to a [[Hindu]] [[Kayastha]] family<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gOkXAAAAIAAJ&q=Birbal+brahmin&dq=Birbal+brahmin&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiR0Pvii6ffAhVHiHAKHcqgCzwQ6AEIUjAI Gayatri Rahasya: Or, An Exposition of the Gayatri]</ref> in [[Kalpi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], India;<ref name=\"Khanna, Culture of Medieval India\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbKv3zyIFD8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Cultural History of Medieval India |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-81-87358-30-5 |editor-last=Meenakshi Khanna |pages=24\u201344 |chapter=Section 1: Kingship and Court Mixing the Classic with the Folk}}</ref>{{rp|29}} according to folklore, it was at Tikawanpur near the banks of river [[Yamuna River|Yamuna]].<ref name=\"SubramaniamFolktales\">{{Cite book |last=Neela Subramaniam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5zqiW0Bd1YC&pg=PP2 |title=Birbal Stories (32 pp) |publisher=Sura Books |isbn=978-81-7478-301-1 |page=2 |access-date=30 June 2013}}</ref> His father was Ganga Das and mother, Anabha Davito.
