{"title_page": "Kilnavert", "text_new": "'''Kilnavert''' ({{Irish derived place name|Cill na bhFeart|The Church of the Tumuli}}) is a [[townland]] in the [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] of [[Templeport]], [[County Cavan]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]]. The present local pronunciation is ''Killnavart'' but up to the 1870s the local pronunciation was ''Kilfertin''.[[File:St Patrick&#039;s church, Kildallon, Co. Cavan - geograph.org.uk - 1385727.jpg|thumb|St Patrick&#039;s church, Kildallon, Co. Cavan - geograph.org.uk - 1385727]]\n\n==Geography==\n\nKilnavert is bounded on the north by [[Lissanover]] and [[Killycluggin]] townlands, on the west by [[Gortnaleck]] and [[Camagh]] townlands, on the south by [[Derrycassan]] townland and on the east by [[Corran, County Cavan]] townland. Its chief geographical features are Camagh Lough, a gravel pit, a wood, streams, a spring well and dug wells. Kilnavert is traversed by the national secondary [[R205 road (Ireland)]], minor roads, rural lanes and the disused [[Cavan and Leitrim Railway]]. The townland covers 188 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe reason for the Irish name Cill na bhFeart meaning ''The Church of the Tumuli'', is that there is a Roman Catholic church and eight prehistoric monuments in the townland, including 3 barrows ([[Tumulus]]), 3 standing stones, 1 wedge tomb and 1 stone circle.<ref name=\"templeport1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.templeport.ie/magh-slecht-dara-fort/plain-of-blood.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Plain of Blood : A Study of the Ritual Landscape of Magh Slecht, Co. Cavan |author=Kevin White |website=Templeport.ie |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nKilnavert is intimately associated with [[Saint Patrick]] and his overthrow of the idol [[Crom Cruach]] in [[Magh Sl\u00e9cht]]. Kilnavert was originally named Fossa Sl\u00e9cht or Rath Sl\u00e9cht and was the first Christian church founded in [[County Cavan]] by [[Saint Patrick]]. [[T\u00edrech\u00e1n]]'s Memoir written c.680 A.D.<ref>[Bury, J.B. (1902) ''T\u00edrech\u00e1n's Memoir of St. Patrick'']</ref> states-\n\n''Patrick however, sending Methbrain, a foreign kinsman of Patrick's, to Fossam Sl\u00e9cht, who told wonders of God.''\n\nThe 9th century [[Vita tripartita Sancti Patricii]], p.&nbsp;93, states- ''Patrick founded a church in that stead, namely, Domnach Maighe Sleacht, and left therein Mabran [whose cognomen is] Barbarus Patricii, a relative of his and a prophet. And there is Patrick's well, wherein he baptized many. Then Patrick went into the province of Connaught by Snam da En over the Shannon''.\n \nMethbrain, also known as [[Banban the Wise]] was the first Christian priest of Templeport.\n\nKilnavert is mentioned several times in the 14th century Book of Magauran.<ref>{{Citation |author= L. McKenna |title=The Book of Magauran |year=1947 |ref=BM}}</ref>\n\nFor example-\n\nPoem 21, stanza 18, written c.1338 refers to Saint Patrick at Kilnavert-\n\n''One day when Patrick lay to rest at fair soft-grassed Chill Fhearta, this vision, so consoling to us, was given to his prophetic eye......''\n\nPoem 2, Stanza 36 written c.1291\n\n''Achadh Fearta, home of stout heroes, where the tombs of our forebears lie side by side. Its name comes from the tombs of the noble Gaoidhil being placed unceasingly on that stone-strewn plain.''\n\nSince the 5th century, Kilnavert has formed part of the church lands belonging to Kilnavert Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. In the 16th century these ecclesiastical lands in Templeport were seized in the course of the [[Reformation in Ireland]] and kept first by the English monarch and then in 1609 granted to the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]].\n\nOn 26 October 1579 [[Pope Gregory XIII]] asked [[Richard Brady]], the [[Bishop of Ardagh]] to settle a dispute where the parish priest of Templeport, Fergal Magauran, claimed the chapel of ''Cillfert'' was usurped by nobles.<ref>Vatican Archives, Dataria Apostolica, Minutae Brevium Lateranensium, n. 20099.</ref>\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 20 June 1588 valued the total vicarage of Templeport at \u00a310.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 19 September 1590 found ''the church lands of Kilfert to consist of two polls of land at a yearly value of 2 shillings''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GuNaAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA71&dq=Kilfert&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiOv8vT2LrdAhVLIMAKHUQjD_gQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&q=Kilfert&f=false|title=Monasticon Hibernicum: or, a history of the abbeys, priories, and other religious houses in Ireland; interspersed with memoirs of their several founders and benefactors, and of their abbots and other superiors, to the time of their final suppression: Likewise, an account of the manner in which the possessions belonging to those foundations were disposed of, and the present state of their ruins, collected from english, irish, and foreign historians, records, and other authentic documents, and from many curious and valuable manuscripts.

A bad time it was for priests and papists; yet, notwithstanding, Cormac and Charles rode on Sunday mornings to '''Killnavart''', to hear Mass, a distance of some ten or twelve miles; and, having come there, they attached their horses by their bridle-reins to the branches of trees near the chapel. Baron MacGauran was then Earl of Tullaghagh, and heard Mass at '''Killnavart'''. He observed the two strange young men at Mass, and their horses tied by their bridles to trees near the chapel; he enquired to whom the horses belonged, and where the owners were from. Having been informed on those points, the Baron invited the young men to dinner on the following Sunday; and soon afterwards proffered them a residence in the neighbourhood of Ballymagauran, and they willingly accepted the invitation. Almost immediately afterwards Cormac Dolan, the elder son, married a near relative of the Baron,\u2014the daughter of Terence MacGauran, who was better known as Trealach Caoch or \"Blind Terry,\" in consequence of his being squint-eyed. But the Baron's hospitality and Dolan's marriage became a great misfortune to both parties.''\n''In due time after the marriage a son was born to Cormac Dolan; about the same time another child was born for Baron MacGauran, who claimed that his relative Cormac Dolan's wife and daughter of Blind Terry should nurse his (the Baron's) child. Bryan Dolan took this demand as a great insult: he instructed his daughter-in-law to say that he had not come so low that she should become a \"hippin-washer\" to any man. This message enraged the Baron to madness; he at once rode to Dolan's house, called for the old man, whom he seized by the hair of the head and dragged him by the horse's side at full gallop, and threw him dead on the road. The sons Cormac and Charles seeing the Baron gallop furiously to their house, and immediately galloping back dragging something by his horse's side, one said to the other \"the Baron is dragging something after him;\" the other exclaimed with an oath \"it is my father,\" and, snapping up a gun that lay near, he rushed to the road and shot the Baron dead on the spot. Old Dolan and the Baron were just buried when the relatives and retainers of the Baron came at night, broke into Dolan's dwelling, and killed the brothers Cormac and Charles. Cormac's wife exclaimed, were there none of the friends of Blind Terry there? They spared her and her child, whose name was Rodger, and reared him up as one of themselves.''\n\nThe Baron MacGauran referred to was probably the chief of the McGovern Clan, [[Tomas \u00d3g M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in]], who lived in [[Ballymagauran]] and who received a pardon on 19 January 1586 from Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]], ''Thomas oge m'Brien m'Thomas Magawran, of Magawranstowne'', for fighting against the Queen's forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/reportofdeputyke1416irel/reportofdeputyke1416irel_djvu.txt |title=Full text of \"The ... report of the Deputy Keeper of the Public Records in Ireland / presented to both houses of the Parliament by command of Her Majesty\" |website=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Kilfart''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf |title=Map of Tullyhaw, County Cavan |format=PDF |website=Nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html |title=Templeport Development Association - 1609 Baronial-Map |website=Templeport.ie |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as ''Kilfart''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Kilfert''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 |title=Down Survey Maps &#124; The Down Survey Project |website=Downsurvey.tcd.ie |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Killfert''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan|title=Down Survey Maps &#124; The Down Survey Project|website=downsurvey.tcd.ie}}</ref>\n\nThe 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as ''Kilfart''.<ref>[http://www.cavanlibrary.ie/file/Local-Studies/Library-Scanned-Docs/The-Carvaghs-A-List-Of-The-Several-Baronies-And-Parishes-in-the-County-Of-Cavan.pdf]</ref>\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts the townland as ''Kilfort'' which map meant the land was still belonging to the Anglican Church of Ireland.

Kilnavert was originally named Fossa Sl\u00e9cht or Rath Sl\u00e9cht and was the first Christian church founded in [[County Cavan]] by [[Saint Patrick]].

(1902) ''T\u00edrech\u00e1n's Memoir of St. Patrick'']</ref> states-\n\n''Patrick however, sending Methbrain, a foreign kinsman of Patrick's, to Fossam Sl\u00e9cht, who told wonders of God.''\n\nThe 9th century [[Vita tripartita Sancti Patricii]], p.&nbsp;93, states- ''Patrick founded a church in that stead, namely, Domnach Maighe Sleacht, and left therein Mabran [whose cognomen is] Barbarus Patricii, a relative of his and a prophet. And there is Patrick's well, wherein he baptized many. Then Patrick went into the province of Connaught by Snam da En over the Shannon''.\n \nMethbrain, also known as [[Banban the Wise]] was the first Christian priest of Templeport.\n\nKilnavert is mentioned several times in the 14th century Book of Magauran.<ref>{{Citation |author= L.

Its name comes from the tombs of the noble Gaoidhil being placed unceasingly on that stone-strewn plain.''\n\nSince the 5th century, Kilnavert has formed part of the church lands belonging to Kilnavert Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. In the 16th century these ecclesiastical lands in Templeport were seized in the course of the [[Reformation in Ireland]] and kept first by the English monarch and then in 1609 granted to the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]].\n\nOn 26 October 1579 [[Pope Gregory XIII]] asked [[Richard Brady]], the [[Bishop of Ardagh]] to settle a dispute where the parish priest of Templeport, Fergal Magauran, claimed the chapel of ''Cillfert'' was usurped by nobles.<ref>Vatican Archives, Dataria Apostolica, Minutae Brevium Lateranensium, n. 20099.</ref>\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 20 June 1588 valued the total vicarage of Templeport at \u00a310.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 19 September 1590 found ''the church lands of Kilfert to consist of two polls of land at a yearly value of 2 shillings''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GuNaAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA71&dq=Kilfert&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiOv8vT2LrdAhVLIMAKHUQjD_gQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&q=Kilfert&f=false|title=Monasticon Hibernicum: or, a history of the abbeys, priories, and other religious houses in Ireland; interspersed with memoirs of their several founders and benefactors, and of their abbots and other superiors, to the time of their final suppression: Likewise, an account of the manner in which the possessions belonging to those foundations were disposed of, and the present state of their ruins, collected from english, irish, and foreign historians, records, and other authentic documents, and from many curious and valuable manuscripts.

A bad time it was for priests and papists; yet, notwithstanding, Cormac and Charles rode on Sunday mornings to '''Killnavart''', to hear Mass, a distance of some ten or twelve miles; and, having come there, they attached their horses by their bridle-reins to the branches of trees near the chapel. Baron MacGauran was then Earl of Tullaghagh, and heard Mass at '''Killnavart'''. He observed the two strange young men at Mass, and their horses tied by their bridles to trees near the chapel; he enquired to whom the horses belonged, and where the owners were from. Having been informed on those points, the Baron invited the young men to dinner on the following Sunday; and soon afterwards proffered them a residence in the neighbourhood of Ballymagauran, and they willingly accepted the invitation. Almost immediately afterwards Cormac Dolan, the elder son, married a near relative of the Baron,\u2014the daughter of Terence MacGauran, who was better known as Trealach Caoch or \"Blind Terry,\" in consequence of his being squint-eyed. But the Baron's hospitality and Dolan's marriage became a great misfortune to both parties.''\n''In due time after the marriage a son was born to Cormac Dolan; about the same time another child was born for Baron MacGauran, who claimed that his relative Cormac Dolan's wife and daughter of Blind Terry should nurse his (the Baron's) child. Bryan Dolan took this demand as a great insult: he instructed his daughter-in-law to say that he had not come so low that she should become a \"hippin-washer\" to any man. This message enraged the Baron to madness; he at once rode to Dolan's house, called for the old man, whom he seized by the hair of the head and dragged him by the horse's side at full gallop, and threw him dead on the road. The sons Cormac and Charles seeing the Baron gallop furiously to their house, and immediately galloping back dragging something by his horse's side, one said to the other \"the Baron is dragging something after him;\" the other exclaimed with an oath \"it is my father,\" and, snapping up a gun that lay near, he rushed to the road and shot the Baron dead on the spot. Old Dolan and the Baron were just buried when the relatives and retainers of the Baron came at night, broke into Dolan's dwelling, and killed the brothers Cormac and Charles. Cormac's wife exclaimed, were there none of the friends of Blind Terry there? They spared her and her child, whose name was Rodger, and reared him up as one of themselves.''\n\nThe Baron MacGauran referred to was probably the chief of the McGovern Clan, [[Tomas \u00d3g M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in]], who lived in [[Ballymagauran]] and who received a pardon on 19 January 1586 from Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]], ''Thomas oge m'Brien m'Thomas Magawran, of Magawranstowne'', for fighting against the Queen's forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/reportofdeputyke1416irel/reportofdeputyke1416irel_djvu.txt |title=Full text of \"The ... report of the Deputy Keeper of the Public Records in Ireland / presented to both houses of the Parliament by command of Her Majesty\" |website=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Kilfart''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf |title=Map of Tullyhaw, County Cavan |format=PDF |website=Nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html |title=Templeport Development Association - 1609 Baronial-Map |website=Templeport.ie |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as ''Kilfart''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Kilfert''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 |title=Down Survey Maps &#124; The Down Survey Project |website=Downsurvey.tcd.ie |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Killfert''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan|title=Down Survey Maps &#124; The Down Survey Project|website=downsurvey.tcd.ie}}</ref>\n\nThe 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as ''Kilfart''.<ref>[http://www.cavanlibrary.ie/file/Local-Studies/Library-Scanned-Docs/The-Carvaghs-A-List-Of-The-Several-Baronies-And-Parishes-in-the-County-Of-Cavan.pdf]</ref>\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts the townland as ''Kilfort'' which map meant the land was still belonging to the Anglican Church of Ireland.

After 480&nbsp;CE the area was dominated by the [[Hephthalites]] and ruled from Kapisa and Kabul. They were succeeded by the [[Kushano-Hephthalite]] dynasty from 565 to 670&nbsp;CE, then by the [[Shahi]] from 670 to the early 11th century, when the Shahi were destroyed by the [[Ghaznavids]].\n\nTradition believes that the city of [[Jammu]] was founded by a ruler called Jambu Lochan in remote antiquity. During one of his hunting campaigns, he is said to have reached the Tawi River where he saw a goat and a lion drinking water side by side. Having satisfied their thirst, the animals went their own ways. Amazed, the raja decided that this place was a place of peace and tranquility and established a [[Bahu Fort|palace]] and the new capital for his kingdom be established on that site.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Kashmir map.svg|thumb|Jammu region is adjacent to and southwest of the Kashmir valley in Indian Jammu and Kashmir. The region consists of the districts of Doda, Kathua, Jammu, Udhampur, Rajouri and Poonch.]]\n[[File: Lama dance at Jummoo,.jpg|thumb|Lama dance at Jummoo,]]\nThe hilly regions to the south and southwest of the [[Kashmir Valley]]  formed the '''Jammu Province''' of the [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|princely state of Jammu and Kashmir]]. During the declining years of the [[Mughal Empire]], the region comprised 22 hill states that emerged from the Mughal suzerainty. Hutchison and Vogel, who first studied these states, called them the ''Dugar group'' of states. (''Dugar'' <ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.38533|title=History Of The Panjab Hill States  Vol. 1|last=Vogel|first=J. Ph|date=1933|pp=45-46}}</ref>is a medieval term with ancient form ''Durgara'' and modern form [[Dogra]].) The state of Jammu is believed to have been the most prominent among the Dugar group, which they identified with the kingdom of ''Durgara''.\n\nThe term ''Durgara'' is witnessed in a copper plate inscription from [[Chamba State|Chamba]] in the 11th century. The inscription refers to an attack on Chamba by the \"Lord of Durgara\" allied with ''Saumatikas'' and the ''Kiras'' of Chamba. However, no kingdom by that name is mentioned in the [[Rajatarangini]]. ''Durgara'' could have been a reference to ''Vallapura'' (modern [[Billawar]]) or ''Babbapura'' (modern Babor). Some scholars believe it to have been a regional or ethnic name current in the region.{{sfn|H\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101, Textiles, Costumes, and Ornaments of the Western Himalaya|1998|p=178,&nbsp;180}}{{sfn|Hutchison & Vogel, History of Panjab Hill States, Volume 2|1933|pp=517\u2013518}}{{sfn|Bamzai, Culture and Political History of Kashmir|1994|p=184}}{{sfn|Stein, Kalhana's Rajatarangini|1989|p=432}}\n\nJammu is mentioned by name in the chronicles of [[Timur]], who invaded Delhi in 1398 and returned to Samarkand via Jammu. In the Mughal chronicles of [[Babur]] in the early 16th century, Jammu is mentioned as a powerful state in the Punjab hills. It is said to have been ruled by Manhas Rajputs. Emperor [[Akbar]] brought the hill kingdoms of the region under Mughal suzerainty, but the kings enjoyed considerable political autonomy. In addition to Jammu,  other kingdoms of the region such as [[Kishtwar]] and [[Rajauri]] were also prominently mentioned. It is evident that the Mughal empire treated these hill chiefs as allies and partners in the empire.<ref name=Jigar>* {{citation |last=Mohammad |first=Jigar |title=Raja Ranjit Dev's Inclusive Policies and Politico-economic developments in Jammu |newspaper=Epilogue |volume=4 |number=11 |date=November 2010 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TMxJzb7N_8wC&pg=PA40 |pp=40\u201342 |ref={{sfnref|Jigar Mohammad, Raja Ranjit Dev's Inclusive Policies|2010}}}}</ref>\n\nAfter the decline of the Mughal power in the 18th century, the Jammu state under Raja Dhruv Dev, of the ''Jamuwal'' (''[[Jamwal]]'') family, asserted its supremacy among the Dugar states. Its ascent reached its peak under his successor Raja Ranjit Dev (r.&nbsp;1728\u20131780), who was widely respected among the hill states.{{sfn|Jeratha, Dogra Legends of Art & Culture|1998|p=187}}{{sfn|Panikkar, Gulab Singh|1930|p=10}}\nTowards the end of Ranjit Dev's rule, the Sikh clans of Punjab (''[[misls]]'') gained ascendancy, and Jammu began to be contested by the [[Bhangi Misl|Bhangi]], [[Kanhaiya Misl|Kanhaiya]] and [[Sukerchakia Misl|Sukerchakia]] ''misls''. Around 1770, the Bhangi ''misl'' attacked Jammu and forced Ranjit Dev to become a tributary. Brij Lal Dev, his successor, was defeated by the Sukerchakia chief Mahan Singh, who sacked Jammu and plundered it. Thus Jammu lost its supremacy over the surrounding country.{{sfn|Panikkar, Gulab Singh|1930|p=10\u201312}}\n\nIn 1808, Jammu itself was annexed to the [[Sikh Empire]] by [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]], the son of Mahan Singh.{{sfn|Panikkar, Gulab Singh|1930|p=15\u201316}}\n\n=== Gulab Singh and the Dogra dynasty ===\n{{Main|Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)}}\n[[File:Gulabsingh1840.jpg|thumb|right|x250px|text|[[Gulab Singh of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja Gulab Singh]], the founder of princely state of Jammu and Kashmir]]\n\nGulab Singh, a descendant of Dhruv Dev via his third son, was 16 years old when the Sikh Empire conquered Jammu. After the loss of Jammu, Gulab Singh along with his two brothers went on to enrol in the Sikh troops. He soon distinguished himself in battles and was awarded a ''jagir'' near Jammu with an allowance to keep an independent force. After the conquest of [[Kishtwar]] (1821) and the subjugation of [[Rajouri district|Rajouri]], he was made a hereditary Raja of Jammu in 1822,  personally anointed by Ranjit Singh. His brother Dhyan Singh received [[Historical Poonch District|Poonch]] and [[Chibhal]], and Suchet Singh [[Ramnagar, Udhampur|Ramnagar]].{{sfn|Panikkar, Gulab Singh|1930|pp=14-34}}{{sfn|Huttenback, Gulab Singh and the Creation of the Dogra State|1961|p=478}}\n\nBy 1827, Gulab Singh brought under his control all the principalities lying between Kashmir and Jammu.{{sfn|Panikkar, Gulab Singh|1930|p=37}} Thus the entire Jammu province came under the control of the three Jamwal brothers under the umbrella of the Sikh Empire.\n\nAfter the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1839, the Sikh court fell into anarchy and palace intrigues took over. Gulab Singh's brothers Dhyan Singh and Suchet Singh, as well as his nephew Hira Singh, were murdered in the struggles. The relations between the Sikh court and Gulab Singh deteriorated.{{sfn|Panikkar, Gulab Singh| 1930|pp=65-72}}{{sfn|Satinder Singh, Raja Gulab Singh's Role|1971|p=37}} During the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] (1845\u20131846), Gulab Singh kept aloof. He was nevertheless invited to Lahore and installed as the Prime Minister of the Sikh Empire. His actions as the Prime Minister were duplicitous and contributed to a Sikh defeat.{{sfn|Satinder Singh, Raja Gulab Singh's Role|1971|pp=46-50}}\n\nThe British decided to weaken the power of the Sikhs and set up Gulab Singh as a counterweight. Accordingly, they demanded a war indemnity from the Sikhs which included all the hilly territory between the [[Ravi River|Ravi]] and [[Indus River|Indus]] rivers, and then transferred it to Gulab Singh, recognising him as an independent Maharaja. Gulab Singh paid 7.5 million Nanakshahee Rupees to the British for the transaction.{{sfn|Satinder Singh, Raja Gulab Singh's Role|1971|pp=52-53}} Thus the princely state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] came into being, ruled by Gulab Singh and his descendants, known as the [[Dogra dynasty]].\n\nDuring the Dogra rule, Jammu in the Jammu province and Srinagar in the Kashmir province were both used as capitals, six months to a year each. Poonch and Chibhal were granted as ''jagirs'' to Dhyan Singh's surviving sons, Jawahir Singh and Moti Singh. However, Jawahir Singh got involved in conspiracies and was exiled to Punjab. Chibhal ([[Bhimber]]) thus reverted to Gulab Singh, while Poonch remained under the control of Moti Singh and his descendants under the suzerainty of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n=== Partition and accession ===\n{{Main|Kashmir conflict}}\nDuring the partition of India, the ruler was [[Maharaja Hari Singh]]. He, along with all the other princes, was given the choice of acceding to either India or [[Pakistan]], taking into consideration the geographical and ethnic issues. The Maharaja chose not to accede to either dominion before the appointed date, citing the mixed religious composition of his state. This technical independence was short-lived as the Maharaja faced a [[1947 Poonch Rebellion|rebellion in the western districts]] and a Pakistan-inspired [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|Pashtun tribal invasion]]. Unable to withstand the assaults, the Maharaja [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|acceded to India]] on 26\u201327 October 1947. India airlifted troops to Kashmir to repel the raiders. However, major portions of the western districts of Muzaffarabad, Poonch, and Mirpur [[Azad Kashmir|remained under the control of Pakistan]]. The remainder of the state was incorporated into India with an autonomous status under [[Article 370]] of the Indian Constitution.The whole population of jammu province in 1941 census was 20,01,557. The population of Muslim's in the Jammu division was 60.5% (12,11,040 in undivided Jammu division; 39.6% in Jammu, 25.3% in Kathua, 42.7% in Udhampur, 68.1% in Reasi, 90% in Poonch Jagir and 80% in Mirpur. \n\n== Geography and climate ==\nJammu borders [[Kashmir]] to the north, [[Ladakh]] to the east, and [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]] to the south. In the west, the [[Line of Control]] separates Jammu from [[Pakistan]]i-administered Jammu and Kashmir (known as [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]] in Pakistan, and as Pakistani-''administered'' Jammu and Kashmir in India-''administered''). In between the [[Vale of Kashmir]] to the north and the Daman Koh Plains to the south, the [[Shivalik Range]] comprises most of the region of Jammu. The [[Pir Panjal Range]], the Trikuta Hills and the low-lying [[Tawi River]] basin add beauty and diversity to the terrain of Jammu. The Pir Panjal range separates Jammu from the Kashmir valley. Jammu region has geographically 8 sub regions Ravi-Tawi Kandi plains, Shiwaliks, Pir Panjal belt, Chenab Valley, Bhaderwah Valley, Gandoh Valley, Paddar Valley and Warwan-Marwah Valley.\n\nThe climate of the region varies with altitude. In and around Jammu city, the climate is similar to the nearby Punjab region with hot summers, rainy monsoon, and mildly cold and foggy winters. While Jammu City itself does not experience any snowfall, the higher hills and mountains are snow-capped during the winter. People from all over India come to the [[Patnitop]] mountain resort to enjoy the winter snows. The shrine of [[Vaishno Devi]] is covered with snow in the winter. The [[Banihal Pass]], which links the Jammu region to the Kashmir region, often experiences closure in the winter months due to extremely heavy snowfall.\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the 2011 census, the total population of Jammu Division is 5,350,811.<ref name=CEN2011>[http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/prov_data_products_J&K.html Census of India: Provisional Population Totals Paper 1 of 2011: Jammu & Kashmir]</ref> Ethnically, Jammu is largely [[Dogra]], a group which constitutes approximately 47% of the population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011Census/Language-2011/Statement-1.pdf}}</ref> Jammu's people are closely related to Punjabis.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Jammu-and-Kashmir|title=Jammu and Kashmir {{!}} Geography, History, & Points of Interest|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en}}</ref>\n[[File:Jammu Tawi.jpg|thumb|[[Tawi River]]]]\nThe Jammu Division overall has a Hindu majority population \u2013 66% practice Hinduism, 30% practice Islam and most of the remainder are Sikhs.<ref name=CEN2011 /> The Hindus form a majority in the Jammu, Kathua, Samba and Udhampur districts, and roughly half the population in the Reasi district.<ref name=CEN2011 /> Most of Jammu's Hindus are native Dogras, [[Kashmiri Pandit]]s, [[Hinduism in Punjab|Punjabi Hindus]] migrants and refugees from the [[Kotli]] and [[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]] areas which are currently administered by Pakistan.

After 480&nbsp;CE the area was dominated by the [[Hephthalites]] and ruled from Kapisa and Kabul. They were succeeded by the [[Kushano-Hephthalite]] dynasty from 565 to 670&nbsp;CE, then by the [[Shahi]] from 670 to the early 11th century, when the Shahi were destroyed by the [[Ghaznavids]].\n\nTradition believes that the city of [[Jammu]] was founded by a ruler called Jambu Lochan in remote antiquity. During one of his hunting campaigns, he is said to have reached the Tawi River where he saw a goat and a lion drinking water side by side. Having satisfied their thirst, the animals went their own ways. Amazed, the raja decided that this place was a place of peace and tranquility and established a [[Bahu Fort|palace]] and the new capital for his kingdom be established on that site.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Kashmir map.svg|thumb|Jammu region is adjacent to and southwest of the Kashmir valley in Indian Jammu and Kashmir. The region consists of the districts of Doda, Kathua, Jammu, Udhampur, Rajouri and Poonch.]]\n[[File: Lama dance at Jummoo,.jpg|thumb|Lama dance at Jummoo,]]\nThe hilly regions to the south and southwest of the [[Kashmir Valley]]  formed the '''Jammu Province''' of the [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|princely state of Jammu and Kashmir]]. During the declining years of the [[Mughal Empire]], the region comprised 22 hill states that emerged from the Mughal suzerainty. Hutchison and Vogel, who first studied these states, called them the ''Dugar group'' of states. (''Dugar'' <ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.38533|title=History Of The Panjab Hill States  Vol. 1|last=Vogel|first=J. Ph|date=1933|pp=45-46}}</ref>is a medieval term with ancient form ''Durgara'' and modern form [[Dogra]].) The state of Jammu is believed to have been the most prominent among the Dugar group, which they identified with the kingdom of ''Durgara''.\n\nThe term ''Durgara'' is witnessed in a copper plate inscription from [[Chamba State|Chamba]] in the 11th century. The inscription refers to an attack on Chamba by the \"Lord of Durgara\" allied with ''Saumatikas'' and the ''Kiras'' of Chamba. However, no kingdom by that name is mentioned in the [[Rajatarangini]]. ''Durgara'' could have been a reference to ''Vallapura'' (modern [[Billawar]]) or ''Babbapura'' (modern Babor). Some scholars believe it to have been a regional or ethnic name current in the region.{{sfn|H\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101, Textiles, Costumes, and Ornaments of the Western Himalaya|1998|p=178,&nbsp;180}}{{sfn|Hutchison & Vogel, History of Panjab Hill States, Volume 2|1933|pp=517\u2013518}}{{sfn|Bamzai, Culture and Political History of Kashmir|1994|p=184}}{{sfn|Stein, Kalhana's Rajatarangini|1989|p=432}}\n\nJammu is mentioned by name in the chronicles of [[Timur]], who invaded Delhi in 1398 and returned to Samarkand via Jammu. In the Mughal chronicles of [[Babur]] in the early 16th century, Jammu is mentioned as a powerful state in the Punjab hills. It is said to have been ruled by Manhas Rajputs. Emperor [[Akbar]] brought the hill kingdoms of the region under Mughal suzerainty, but the kings enjoyed considerable political autonomy. In addition to Jammu,  other kingdoms of the region such as [[Kishtwar]] and [[Rajauri]] were also prominently mentioned. It is evident that the Mughal empire treated these hill chiefs as allies and partners in the empire.<ref name=Jigar>* {{citation |last=Mohammad |first=Jigar |title=Raja Ranjit Dev's Inclusive Policies and Politico-economic developments in Jammu |newspaper=Epilogue |volume=4 |number=11 |date=November 2010 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TMxJzb7N_8wC&pg=PA40 |pp=40\u201342 |ref={{sfnref|Jigar Mohammad, Raja Ranjit Dev's Inclusive Policies|2010}}}}</ref>\n\nAfter the decline of the Mughal power in the 18th century, the Jammu state under Raja Dhruv Dev, of the ''Jamuwal'' (''[[Jamwal]]'') family, asserted its supremacy among the Dugar states. Its ascent reached its peak under his successor Raja Ranjit Dev (r.&nbsp;1728\u20131780), who was widely respected among the hill states.{{sfn|Jeratha, Dogra Legends of Art & Culture|1998|p=187}}{{sfn|Panikkar, Gulab Singh|1930|p=10}}\nTowards the end of Ranjit Dev's rule, the Sikh clans of Punjab (''[[misls]]'') gained ascendancy, and Jammu began to be contested by the [[Bhangi Misl|Bhangi]], [[Kanhaiya Misl|Kanhaiya]] and [[Sukerchakia Misl|Sukerchakia]] ''misls''. Around 1770, the Bhangi ''misl'' attacked Jammu and forced Ranjit Dev to become a tributary. Brij Lal Dev, his successor, was defeated by the Sukerchakia chief Mahan Singh, who sacked Jammu and plundered it. Thus Jammu lost its supremacy over the surrounding country.{{sfn|Panikkar, Gulab Singh|1930|p=10\u201312}}\n\nIn 1808, Jammu itself was annexed to the [[Sikh Empire]] by [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]], the son of Mahan Singh.{{sfn|Panikkar, Gulab Singh|1930|p=15\u201316}}\n\n=== Gulab Singh and the Dogra dynasty ===\n{{Main|Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)}}\n[[File:Gulabsingh1840.jpg|thumb|right|x250px|text|[[Gulab Singh of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja Gulab Singh]], the founder of princely state of Jammu and Kashmir]]\n\nGulab Singh, a descendant of Dhruv Dev via his third son, was 16 years old when the Sikh Empire conquered Jammu. After the loss of Jammu, Gulab Singh along with his two brothers went on to enrol in the Sikh troops. He soon distinguished himself in battles and was awarded a ''jagir'' near Jammu with an allowance to keep an independent force. After the conquest of [[Kishtwar]] (1821) and the subjugation of [[Rajouri district|Rajouri]], he was made a hereditary Raja of Jammu in 1822,  personally anointed by Ranjit Singh. His brother Dhyan Singh received [[Historical Poonch District|Poonch]] and [[Chibhal]], and Suchet Singh [[Ramnagar, Udhampur|Ramnagar]].{{sfn|Panikkar, Gulab Singh|1930|pp=14-34}}{{sfn|Huttenback, Gulab Singh and the Creation of the Dogra State|1961|p=478}}\n\nBy 1827, Gulab Singh brought under his control all the principalities lying between Kashmir and Jammu.{{sfn|Panikkar, Gulab Singh|1930|p=37}} Thus the entire Jammu province came under the control of the three Jamwal brothers under the umbrella of the Sikh Empire.\n\nAfter the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1839, the Sikh court fell into anarchy and palace intrigues took over. Gulab Singh's brothers Dhyan Singh and Suchet Singh, as well as his nephew Hira Singh, were murdered in the struggles. The relations between the Sikh court and Gulab Singh deteriorated.{{sfn|Panikkar, Gulab Singh| 1930|pp=65-72}}{{sfn|Satinder Singh, Raja Gulab Singh's Role|1971|p=37}} During the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] (1845\u20131846), Gulab Singh kept aloof. He was nevertheless invited to Lahore and installed as the Prime Minister of the Sikh Empire. His actions as the Prime Minister were duplicitous and contributed to a Sikh defeat.{{sfn|Satinder Singh, Raja Gulab Singh's Role|1971|pp=46-50}}\n\nThe British decided to weaken the power of the Sikhs and set up Gulab Singh as a counterweight. Accordingly, they demanded a war indemnity from the Sikhs which included all the hilly territory between the [[Ravi River|Ravi]] and [[Indus River|Indus]] rivers, and then transferred it to Gulab Singh, recognising him as an independent Maharaja. Gulab Singh paid 7.5 million Nanakshahee Rupees to the British for the transaction.{{sfn|Satinder Singh, Raja Gulab Singh's Role|1971|pp=52-53}} Thus the princely state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] came into being, ruled by Gulab Singh and his descendants, known as the [[Dogra dynasty]].\n\nDuring the Dogra rule, Jammu in the Jammu province and Srinagar in the Kashmir province were both used as capitals, six months to a year each. Poonch and Chibhal were granted as ''jagirs'' to Dhyan Singh's surviving sons, Jawahir Singh and Moti Singh. However, Jawahir Singh got involved in conspiracies and was exiled to Punjab. Chibhal ([[Bhimber]]) thus reverted to Gulab Singh, while Poonch remained under the control of Moti Singh and his descendants under the suzerainty of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n=== Partition and accession ===\n{{Main|Kashmir conflict}}\nDuring the partition of India, the ruler was [[Maharaja Hari Singh]]. He, along with all the other princes, was given the choice of acceding to either India or [[Pakistan]], taking into consideration the geographical and ethnic issues. The Maharaja chose not to accede to either dominion before the appointed date, citing the mixed religious composition of his state. This technical independence was short-lived as the Maharaja faced a [[1947 Poonch Rebellion|rebellion in the western districts]] and a Pakistan-inspired [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|Pashtun tribal invasion]]. Unable to withstand the assaults, the Maharaja [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|acceded to India]] on 26\u201327 October 1947. India airlifted troops to Kashmir to repel the raiders. However, major portions of the western districts of Muzaffarabad, Poonch, and Mirpur [[Azad Kashmir|remained under the control of Pakistan]]. The remainder of the state was incorporated into India with an autonomous status under [[Article 370]] of the Indian Constitution.The whole population of jammu province in 1941 census was 20,01,557. The population of Muslim's in the Jammu division was 60.5% (12,11,040 in undivided Jammu division; 39.6% in Jammu, 25.3% in Kathua, 42.7% in Udhampur, 68.1% in Reasi, 90% in Poonch Jagir and 80% in Mirpur. \n\n== Geography and climate ==\nJammu borders [[Kashmir]] to the north, [[Ladakh]] to the east, and [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]] to the south. In the west, the [[Line of Control]] separates Jammu from [[Pakistan]]i-administered Jammu and Kashmir (known as [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]] in Pakistan, and as Pakistani-''administered'' Jammu and Kashmir in India-''administered''). In between the [[Vale of Kashmir]] to the north and the Daman Koh Plains to the south, the [[Shivalik Range]] comprises most of the region of Jammu. The [[Pir Panjal Range]], the Trikuta Hills and the low-lying [[Tawi River]] basin add beauty and diversity to the terrain of Jammu. The Pir Panjal range separates Jammu from the Kashmir valley. Jammu region has geographically 8 sub regions Ravi-Tawi Kandi plains, Shiwaliks, Pir Panjal belt, Chenab Valley, Bhaderwah Valley, Gandoh Valley, Paddar Valley and Warwan-Marwah Valley.\n\nThe climate of the region varies with altitude. In and around Jammu city, the climate is similar to the nearby Punjab region with hot summers, rainy monsoon, and mildly cold and foggy winters. While Jammu City itself does not experience any snowfall, the higher hills and mountains are snow-capped during the winter. People from all over India come to the [[Patnitop]] mountain resort to enjoy the winter snows. The shrine of [[Vaishno Devi]] is covered with snow in the winter. The [[Banihal Pass]], which links the Jammu region to the Kashmir region, often experiences closure in the winter months due to extremely heavy snowfall.\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the 2011 census, the total population of Jammu Division is 5,350,811.<ref name=CEN2011>[http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/prov_data_products_J&K.html Census of India: Provisional Population Totals Paper 1 of 2011: Jammu & Kashmir]</ref> Ethnically, Jammu is largely [[Dogra]], a group which constitutes approximately 47% of the population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011Census/Language-2011/Statement-1.pdf}}</ref> Jammu's people are closely related to Punjabis.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Jammu-and-Kashmir|title=Jammu and Kashmir {{!}} Geography, History, & Points of Interest|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en}}</ref>\n[[File:Jammu Tawi.jpg|thumb|[[Tawi River]]]]\nThe Jammu Division overall has a Hindu majority population \u2013 66% practice Hinduism, 30% practice Islam and most of the remainder are Sikhs.<ref name=CEN2011 /> The Hindus form a majority in the Jammu, Kathua, Samba and Udhampur districts, and roughly half the population in the Reasi district.<ref name=CEN2011 /> Most of Jammu's Hindus are native Dogras, [[Kashmiri Pandit]]s, [[Hinduism in Punjab|Punjabi Hindus]] migrants and refugees from the [[Kotli]] and [[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]] areas which are currently administered by Pakistan.

The main sanctuary is dedicated to Lord [[Vishnu]]'s eighth incarnation and Dogras' patron deity, [[Rama]]. It also houses a [[Sanskrit]] Library containing rare [[Sanskrit]] manuscripts.\n\n=== Peer Kho Cave ===\n\nAlongside the same Tawi river are the '''Peer Kho Cave''' temple, the '''Panchbakhtar temple''' and the '''Ranbireshwar temple''' dedicated to Lord [[Shiva]] with their own legends and specific days of worship.

It is one of the most venerated cave shrines of Lord Shiva in the region. The holy cave is approximately {{convert|200|m}} long, one metre wide and two to three metres high and contains Svayambhu Lingum. According to mythology, this lingam is never-ending. The first entrance of the cave is so wide that 300 devotees can be accommodated at a time. Its cavern is spacious enough to accommodate a large number of people. The inner chamber of the cave is smaller. The cave has many natural impressions and images of various Hindu deities and full of divine feelings. That is why Shivkhori is known as \"the Home of Gods.\" The route from Jammu to Shiv Khori has many beautiful and picturesque mountains, waterfalls and lakes.\n\nA 3-day Shiv Khori mela takes places annually on Maha Shivratri and thousands of pilgrims from different parts of the state and elsewhere visit this cave shrine to seek the blessings of Lord Shiva. The Maha Shivratri festival is usually held in February or during the first week of March every year.
