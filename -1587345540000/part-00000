The [[population density]] was 3,918.8 people per square mile (1,511.4/km\u00b2). There were 5,186 housing units at an average density of 1,796.4 per square mile (692.8/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the borough was 95.89% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.70% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.06% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 1.81% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.03% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.88% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.63% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 1.51% of the population.\n\nThere were 4,985 households, out of which 26.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.9% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 9.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.7% were non-families. 31.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.26 and the average family size was 2.85.\n\nIn the borough, the population was spread out, with 21.2% under the age of 18, 6.6% from 18 to 24, 31.0% from 25 to 44, 22.1% from 45 to 64, and 19.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there are 91.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.8 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the borough was $55,139, whereas the estimated median household for the state of Pennsylvania is $52,007, and the median income for a family was $54,120. Males had a median income of $38,659 versus $25,331 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the borough was $23,245. About 2.2% of families and 3.5% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 1.2% of those under age 18 and 7.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Emmaus Theater 4th Street Lehigh Co PA.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Emmaus Theatre in Emmaus]]\n\n===Founding===\nEmmaus was settled in the 1740s and dates its founding to 1759. For approximately 100 years, until the mid-19th century, it was a closed community of the [[Moravian Church]]. The original land on which the town now lies was donated by Sebastian Heinrich Knauss and Jacob Ehrenhardt for use by the Moravian church. The founders and original residents of the town were members of the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] faiths, who joined the Moravian church when their own denominations were unable to provide ministers. Emmaus was one of the four leading Moravian communities in the northeast United States at the time of its founding; [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]], [[Lititz, Pennsylvania]] and [[Nazareth, Pennsylvania]] were the three others.\n\n===Origin and spelling of name===\nThe borough was named for the biblical village of [[Emmaus]]<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|publisher=Govt. Print. Off. | author=Gannett, Henry|year=1905|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ/page/n118 119]}}</ref> (now within modern [[Israel]]), where, according to the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus]] was seen by his disciples [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] and [[Cleopas]] following his crucifixion and [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|resurrection]].<ref>Luke 24:12-35</ref>\n\nFrom its founding in 1759 until 1830, the settlement's name was spelled ''Emmaus''.  From 1830 until 1938, however, the community used the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] spelling of the name, ''Emaus'', to reflect local language and the significant presence of Pennsylvania Dutch. In German into the early twentieth century, the name had been spelled with a line above the m, which indicated a doubling of the letter, which had also been the usage in English into the sixteenth century.  Since this tradition had died out in English, the line was often omitted in spellings of the name, which became confusing to the now more prevalent English speakers. In 1938, after petitions circulated by the local [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]], the borough formally changed the name's spelling to ''Emmaus'', reflecting the spelling in the [[Gospel of Luke]] in the English New Testament.\n\n===19th century===\n[[Iron ore]] was discovered nearby in the 19th century and served as a source of industrial growth for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1859, the East Pennsylvania Railroad (later part of the [[Reading Company|Philadelphia and Reading Railroad]]) brought trains to Emmaus. That same year, the town was incorporated as a [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]]. In 1869, the town's first [[blast furnace]] opened. The largest iron company was Donaldson Iron Company, which made [[cast iron]] pipes and other products until the company closed in 1943. During the 19th century, Emmaus was also a center of [[silk]] and [[cigar]] manufacturing.\n\n===Population trends===\nIn 1940, public census statistics showed that 6,731 people lived in Emmaus. The population of the borough has since nearly doubled to 11,313, as of the 2000 census. Housing construction has reached the borough line in all directions, so significant continued population growth in the borough is unlikely. Outside the borough line, however, the local population continues to grow, particularly in neighboring [[Lower Macungie Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lower Macungie Township]]. Consequently the growth is found within the Emmaus [[ZIP code]] but not its borough limits.\n\n===Historic sites===\nEmmaus is home to several residences and other properties that were constructed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and have been labeled historic sites by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Under historical preservation Commonwealth laws, the sites are protected from commercial and other development expansion in the borough.\n\n==Departments==\n===Emmaus Fire Department===\nUntil the 1980s, fire protection was provided through three fire companies. In 1980, the Borough completed the construction of the Central Fire Station on Sixth Street from which all personnel and equipment are currently dispatched. The staff consists of paid on-call volunteers who respond, on average, to 375-400 calls per year. Calls include fire protection, rescue/extrication, and [[Dangerous goods|HAZMAT]] response, and are dispatched via Lehigh County's 911 Communications Center. Its vehicles include two 1988 Central States 1250 GPM Pumpers, One 110' Simon LTI 1989 Aerial, Central States 2002 Heavy Rescue Unit, 1989 [[Chevrolet]] Fire Police Vehicle, 1985 Chevrolet and a 1983 [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] Special response units, 1969 Ford bucket utility truck, 2001 [[Chevrolet Tahoe|GMC Yukon]] (Fire Chief's vehicle), and a 2011 HME 109' aerial ladder truck.\n\n===Emmaus Police Department===\nDuring the late 1800s the Borough of Emmaus provided protection for the community by appointing \"High Constables.\" The Emmaus Police Department was established in 1909, and Wilson Kratzer was appointed as the borough's first Police Chief. Since then, the Emmaus Police Department has grown to be a Pennsylvania-accredited law enforcement agency.\n\n===Emmaus Ambulance Corps===\nEmmaus Ambulance Corps provides ambulance coverage for the borough of Emmaus, the eastern portion of [[Upper Milford Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Upper Milford Township]], and a portion of Western [[Salisbury, Pennsylvania|Salisbury Township]] in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. The Corps also provides mutual aid response to surrounding areas including: [[Macungie, Pennsylvania|Macungie]], [[Lower Macungie Township, Pennsylvania|Lower Macungie Township]], Upper Saucon Township, [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Upper Saucon Township]], and the city of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]]. As of April 1, 2004, the Corps began Advanced Life Support service, allowing the Corps to provide a higher level of patient care via state certified paramedics with advanced cardiac care and trauma care procedures. The number of emergency responses in 2004 was 1301. The 2005 call volume was 1607, and the 2006 call volume was 1604. The Emmaus Ambulance service currently consists of three [[Advanced life support|ALS]]-equipped ambulances and one wheelchair/ambulette transport van.\n\n==Industry and commerce==\n[[Buckeye Partners|Buckeye Pipe Line]], a [[United States]] [[petroleum]] distributor, is headquartered locally, between Emmaus and [[Macungie, Pennsylvania|Macungie]].\n\nThe largest major shopping mall in the Emmaus area is [[South Mall]], located on [[Lehigh Street]] on Emmaus' border with [[Salisbury Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Salisbury Township]] and Allentown.  South Mall is one of four major shopping malls in Allentown and its immediate suburbs.\n\nEmmaus is also home of Shangy's, one of the nation's largest [[beer]] distributors, featuring over 4,000 domestic and imported beer brands. Shangy's attracts thousands of beer enthusiasts from around the nation each year.\n\n[[Yocco's Hot Dogs]], the Lehigh Valley-based fast food establishment known for their regionally-famous [[hot dog]]s and [[cheesesteak]]s, maintains its corporate headquarters in Emmaus. One of its six Lehigh Valley restaurants is also located just west of Emmaus, on Chestnut Street near Buckeye Road in [[Upper Milford Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Upper Milford Township]]. Opened in the 1980s, the Emmaus Yocco's is known as Yocco's South. Traub's Doggies, formerly Traubs Market, also is based in Emmaus.\n\nThe Emmaus Arts Commission hosts art and film events in Emmaus, including \"Art in the Garden,\" \"Emmaus Art Walk,\" the \"Student Horror Film Festival,\" and others.  Each October, Emmaus also hosts an annual [[Halloween]] parade, one of the largest in eastern Pennsylvania, combined with a [[5000 metres|5K Race]],<ref>[http://www.emmaus5k.com/ Emmaus5K.com]</ref> held just before the parade's start and is a major fundraiser for the Parade Committee and the Parks and Recreation Commission.\n\nEmmaus was the former headquarters of [[Rodale, Inc.]], one of the world's largest publishers of [[health]]-related books and magazines, including ''[[Men's Health (magazine)|Men's Health]]'', ''[[Prevention (magazine)|Prevention]]'', ''[[Runner's World]]'' and ''[[Women's Health (magazine)|Women's Health]]'' magazines. Rodale was acquired by [[Hearst Communications|Hearst]] in 2018 and local offices were moved to [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]].<ref>{{Cite web| last = Kelly| first = Keith J.| title = Runner\u2019s World staff moving to a former bowling alley| work = New York Post| accessdate = 2018-12-30| date = 2018-09-20| url = https://nypost.com/2018/09/20/runners-world-staff-moving-to-a-former-bowling-alley/}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nEmmaus is served educationally by the [[East Penn School District]], a public school district that accommodates [[kindergarten]] through 12th grade.\n\nThe district has one high school, [[Emmaus High School]] (for grades nine through 12), two middle schools, Eyer Middle School and Lower Macungie Middle School (for grades six through eight), and six elementary schools (for kindergarten through fifth grade), Alburtis Elementary School, Jefferson Elementary School, Lincoln Elementary School, Macungie Elementary School, Shoemaker Elementary School, and Wescosville Elementary School.  A seventh elementary school, [[Seven Generations Charter School]], opened in 2009. A brick-and-mortar charter school, Seven Generations teaches approximately 300 students in the 2011-2012 academic year. The school district opened an eighth elementary school, Willow Lane Elementary School, in September 2010.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:Emmaus PA Borough Hall 4th Street.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Emmaus Borough Hall]]\nEmmaus is governed under a council/mayor system, with the Borough Council retaining the vast majority of governmental authority. After the 2011 municipal election, the borough government includes:\n\n'''Borough council'''\n\n* Brent A.

Citizens had been especially concerned that if the borough chose to follow the consultant's advice to \"monetize the system,\" that the system would be sold to a multinational corporation, as was an increasing trend throughout the region. Many Emmaus residents organized themselves under the group EFLOW (\"Emmaus for Locally Owned Water\"), and through a combination of letter-writing, petitioning and public comment at council meetings, in early September 2005 the council voted to take [[water privatization]] off the table of options. This controversy garnered regional and national attention, with anti-privatization non-profits such as [[Public Citizen]] noting the debate and outcome.<ref>\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20061208104808/http://www.citizen.org/cmep/Water/us/municipal/emmaus/ \"Victory in Emmaus,\" Public Citizen]</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\nEmmaus is accessible by two Lehigh County highways, [[Cedar Crest Boulevard]], located on the borough's west-side, and [[Lehigh Street]], which is located on the borough's east-side and connects Emmaus with [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] and [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]]. Both highways have junctions with [[Interstate 78 in Pennsylvania|I-78]], which spans from [[Lebanon County, Pennsylvania|Lebanon County]] in the west to [[New York City]] in the east. [[Pennsylvania Route 29|Route 29]] runs through the west side of the borough on Cedar Crest Boulevard and Chestnut Street.

The [[population density]] was 3,918.8 people per square mile (1,511.4/km\u00b2). There were 5,186 housing units at an average density of 1,796.4 per square mile (692.8/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the borough was 95.89% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.70% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.06% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 1.81% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.03% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.88% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.63% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 1.51% of the population.\n\nThere were 4,985 households, out of which 26.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.9% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 9.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.7% were non-families. 31.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.26 and the average family size was 2.85.\n\nIn the borough, the population was spread out, with 21.2% under the age of 18, 6.6% from 18 to 24, 31.0% from 25 to 44, 22.1% from 45 to 64, and 19.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there are 91.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.8 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the borough was $55,139, whereas the estimated median household for the state of Pennsylvania is $52,007, and the median income for a family was $54,120. Males had a median income of $38,659 versus $25,331 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the borough was $23,245. About 2.2% of families and 3.5% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 1.2% of those under age 18 and 7.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Emmaus Theater 4th Street Lehigh Co PA.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Emmaus Theatre in Emmaus]]\n\n===Founding===\nEmmaus was settled in the 1740s and dates its founding to 1759. For approximately 100 years, until the mid-19th century, it was a closed community of the [[Moravian Church]]. The original land on which the town now lies was donated by Sebastian Heinrich Knauss and Jacob Ehrenhardt for use by the Moravian church. The founders and original residents of the town were members of the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] faiths, who joined the Moravian church when their own denominations were unable to provide ministers. Emmaus was one of the four leading Moravian communities in the northeast United States at the time of its founding; [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]], [[Lititz, Pennsylvania]] and [[Nazareth, Pennsylvania]] were the three others.\n\n===Origin and spelling of name===\nThe borough was named for the biblical village of [[Emmaus]]<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|publisher=Govt. Print. Off. | author=Gannett, Henry|year=1905|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ/page/n118 119]}}</ref> (now within modern [[Israel]]), where, according to the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus]] was seen by his disciples [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] and [[Cleopas]] following his crucifixion and [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|resurrection]].<ref>Luke 24:12-35</ref>\n\nFrom its founding in 1759 until 1830, the settlement's name was spelled ''Emmaus''.  From 1830 until 1938, however, the community used the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] spelling of the name, ''Emaus'', to reflect local language and the significant presence of Pennsylvania Dutch. In German into the early twentieth century, the name had been spelled with a line above the m, which indicated a doubling of the letter, which had also been the usage in English into the sixteenth century.  Since this tradition had died out in English, the line was often omitted in spellings of the name, which became confusing to the now more prevalent English speakers. In 1938, after petitions circulated by the local [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]], the borough formally changed the name's spelling to ''Emmaus'', reflecting the spelling in the [[Gospel of Luke]] in the English New Testament.\n\n===19th century===\n[[Iron ore]] was discovered nearby in the 19th century and served as a source of industrial growth for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1859, the East Pennsylvania Railroad (later part of the [[Reading Company|Philadelphia and Reading Railroad]]) brought trains to Emmaus. That same year, the town was incorporated as a [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]]. In 1869, the town's first [[blast furnace]] opened. The largest iron company was Donaldson Iron Company, which made [[cast iron]] pipes and other products until the company closed in 1943. During the 19th century, Emmaus was also a center of [[silk]] and [[cigar]] manufacturing.\n\n===Population trends===\nIn 1940, public census statistics showed that 6,731 people lived in Emmaus. The population of the borough has since nearly doubled to 11,313, as of the 2000 census. Housing construction has reached the borough line in all directions, so significant continued population growth in the borough is unlikely. Outside the borough line, however, the local population continues to grow, particularly in neighboring [[Lower Macungie Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lower Macungie Township]]. Consequently the growth is found within the Emmaus [[ZIP code]] but not its borough limits.\n\n===Historic sites===\nEmmaus is home to several residences and other properties that were constructed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and have been labeled historic sites by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Under historical preservation Commonwealth laws, the sites are protected from commercial and other development expansion in the borough.\n\n==Departments==\n===Emmaus Fire Department===\nUntil the 1980s, fire protection was provided through three fire companies. In 1980, the Borough completed the construction of the Central Fire Station on Sixth Street from which all personnel and equipment are currently dispatched. The staff consists of paid on-call volunteers who respond, on average, to 375-400 calls per year. Calls include fire protection, rescue/extrication, and [[Dangerous goods|HAZMAT]] response, and are dispatched via Lehigh County's 911 Communications Center. Its vehicles include two 1988 Central States 1250 GPM Pumpers, One 110' Simon LTI 1989 Aerial, Central States 2002 Heavy Rescue Unit, 1989 [[Chevrolet]] Fire Police Vehicle, 1985 Chevrolet and a 1983 [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] Special response units, 1969 Ford bucket utility truck, 2001 [[Chevrolet Tahoe|GMC Yukon]] (Fire Chief's vehicle), and a 2011 HME 109' aerial ladder truck.\n\n===Emmaus Police Department===\nDuring the late 1800s the Borough of Emmaus provided protection for the community by appointing \"High Constables.\" The Emmaus Police Department was established in 1909, and Wilson Kratzer was appointed as the borough's first Police Chief. Since then, the Emmaus Police Department has grown to be a Pennsylvania-accredited law enforcement agency.\n\n===Emmaus Ambulance Corps===\nEmmaus Ambulance Corps provides ambulance coverage for the borough of Emmaus, the eastern portion of [[Upper Milford Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Upper Milford Township]], and a portion of Western [[Salisbury, Pennsylvania|Salisbury Township]] in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. The Corps also provides mutual aid response to surrounding areas including: [[Macungie, Pennsylvania|Macungie]], [[Lower Macungie Township, Pennsylvania|Lower Macungie Township]], Upper Saucon Township, [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Upper Saucon Township]], and the city of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]]. As of April 1, 2004, the Corps began Advanced Life Support service, allowing the Corps to provide a higher level of patient care via state certified paramedics with advanced cardiac care and trauma care procedures. The number of emergency responses in 2004 was 1301. The 2005 call volume was 1607, and the 2006 call volume was 1604. The Emmaus Ambulance service currently consists of three [[Advanced life support|ALS]]-equipped ambulances and one wheelchair/ambulette transport van.\n\n==Industry and commerce==\n[[Buckeye Partners|Buckeye Pipe Line]], a [[United States]] [[petroleum]] distributor, is headquartered locally, between Emmaus and [[Macungie, Pennsylvania|Macungie]].\n\nThe largest major shopping mall in the Emmaus area is [[South Mall]], located on [[Lehigh Street]] on Emmaus' border with [[Salisbury Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Salisbury Township]] and Allentown.  South Mall is one of four major shopping malls in Allentown and its immediate suburbs.\n\nEmmaus is also home of Shangy's, one of the nation's largest [[beer]] distributors, featuring over 4,000 domestic and imported beer brands. Shangy's attracts thousands of beer enthusiasts from around the nation each year.\n\n[[Yocco's Hot Dogs]], the Lehigh Valley-based fast food establishment known for their regionally-famous [[hot dog]]s and [[cheesesteak]]s, maintains its corporate headquarters in Emmaus. One of its six Lehigh Valley restaurants is also located just west of Emmaus, on Chestnut Street near Buckeye Road in [[Upper Milford Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Upper Milford Township]]. Opened in the 1980s, the Emmaus Yocco's is known as Yocco's South. Traub's Doggies, formerly Traubs Market, also is based in Emmaus.\n\nThe Emmaus Arts Commission hosts art and film events in Emmaus, including \"Art in the Garden,\" \"Emmaus Art Walk,\" the \"Student Horror Film Festival,\" and others.  Each October, Emmaus also hosts an annual [[Halloween]] parade, one of the largest in eastern Pennsylvania, combined with a [[5000 metres|5K Race]],<ref>[http://www.emmaus5k.com/ Emmaus5K.com]</ref> held just before the parade's start and is a major fundraiser for the Parade Committee and the Parks and Recreation Commission.\n\nEmmaus was the former headquarters of [[Rodale, Inc.]], one of the world's largest publishers of [[health]]-related books and magazines, including ''[[Men's Health (magazine)|Men's Health]]'', ''[[Prevention (magazine)|Prevention]]'', ''[[Runner's World]]'' and ''[[Women's Health (magazine)|Women's Health]]'' magazines. Rodale was acquired by [[Hearst Communications|Hearst]] in 2018 and local offices were moved to [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]].<ref>{{Cite web| last = Kelly| first = Keith J.| title = Runner\u2019s World staff moving to a former bowling alley| work = New York Post| accessdate = 2018-12-30| date = 2018-09-20| url = https://nypost.com/2018/09/20/runners-world-staff-moving-to-a-former-bowling-alley/}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nEmmaus is served educationally by the [[East Penn School District]], a public school district that accommodates [[kindergarten]] through 12th grade.\n\nThe district has one high school, [[Emmaus High School]] (for grades nine through 12), two middle schools, Eyer Middle School and Lower Macungie Middle School (for grades six through eight), and six elementary schools (for kindergarten through fifth grade), Alburtis Elementary School, Jefferson Elementary School, Lincoln Elementary School, Macungie Elementary School, Shoemaker Elementary School, and Wescosville Elementary School.  A seventh elementary school, [[Seven Generations Charter School]], opened in 2009. A brick-and-mortar charter school, Seven Generations teaches approximately 300 students in the 2011-2012 academic year. The school district opened an eighth elementary school, Willow Lane Elementary School, in September 2010.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:Emmaus PA Borough Hall 4th Street.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Emmaus Borough Hall]]\nEmmaus is governed under a council/mayor system, with the Borough Council retaining the vast majority of governmental authority. After the 2011 municipal election, the borough government includes:\n\n'''Borough council'''\n\n* Brent A.

Citizens had been especially concerned that if the borough chose to follow the consultant's advice to \"monetize the system,\" that the system would be sold to a multinational corporation, as was an increasing trend throughout the region. Many Emmaus residents organized themselves under the group EFLOW (\"Emmaus for Locally Owned Water\"), and through a combination of letter-writing, petitioning and public comment at council meetings, in early September 2005 the council voted to take [[water privatization]] off the table of options. This controversy garnered regional and national attention, with anti-privatization non-profits such as [[Public Citizen]] noting the debate and outcome.<ref>\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20061208104808/http://www.citizen.org/cmep/Water/us/municipal/emmaus/ \"Victory in Emmaus,\" Public Citizen]</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\nEmmaus is accessible by two Lehigh County highways, [[Cedar Crest Boulevard]], located on the borough's west-side, and [[Lehigh Street]], which is located on the borough's east-side and connects Emmaus with [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] and [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]]. Both highways have junctions with [[Interstate 78 in Pennsylvania|I-78]], which spans from [[Lebanon County, Pennsylvania|Lebanon County]] in the west to [[New York City]] in the east. [[Pennsylvania Route 29|Route 29]] runs through the west side of the borough on Cedar Crest Boulevard and Chestnut Street.

When only one nickname is listed, it is used for teams of both sexes. (Note that in recent years, many schools have chosen to use the same nickname for men's and women's teams even when the nickname is distinctly masculine.) When two nicknames are given, the first is used for men's teams and the other is used for women's teams. Different nicknames for a specific sport within a school are noted separately below the table.\n**Full name of school.\n**Location of school.\n**Conference of the school (if conference column is left blank, the school is either independent or the conference is unknown).\n*Apart from the ongoing conversions, the following notes apply:\n**Following the normal standard of U.S. sports media, the terms \"University\" and \"College\" are ignored in alphabetization, unless necessary to distinguish schools (such as Boston College and Boston University) or are actually used by the media in normally describing the school (formerly the case for the College of Charleston, but that school's sports program is now called simply \"Charleston\").\n**Schools are also alphabetized by the names they are most commonly referred to by sports media, with non-intuitive examples included in parentheses next to the school name. This means, for example, that campuses bearing the name \"University of North Carolina\" may variously be found at \"C\" (Charlotte), \"N\" (North Carolina, referring to the Chapel Hill campus), and \"U\" (the Asheville, Greensboro, Pembroke, and Wilmington campuses, all normally referred to as UNC-<nowiki/>{campus name}).\n**The prefix \"St.\", as in \"Saint\", is alphabetized as if it were spelled out.\n\n==[[NCAA]]==\n\n===[[NCAA Division I|Division I]]===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! rowspan=3|Team !! rowspan=3|School !! rowspan=3|City !! rowspan=3|Conference !! colspan=7|Sport sponsorship\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Foot-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Basketball !! rowspan=2|Base-<br/>ball !! rowspan=2|Soft-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Soccer\n|-\n!

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Canadian radio personality}}\n{{Use Canadian English|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox presenter\n|name        = Lowell Green\n|alias       = \n|image       = Lowell Green.jpg|<nowiki>Lowell Green]]</nowiki>\n|image_size  = \n|caption     = \n|birth_name  = \n|birth_date  = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1936|07|07}}\n|birth_place = [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], [[USA]]\n|death_date  = \n|death_place = \n|show        = ''The Lowell Green Show''\n|station     = [[CFRA (AM)|CFRA]] Ottawa\n|timeslot    = Weekdays 10 am to 12pm\n|show2       = \n|station2    = \n|timeslot2   = \n|style       = [[Talk radio]]\n|country     = Canada\n|prevshow    = Greenline\n|website     = \n|spouse      = Deborah Green\n|awards      = }}\n\n'''Lowell Green''' (born 7 July 1936) is a Canadian radio personality, journalist, and author, best known as the host of ''The Lowell Green Show'', a conservative morning [[talk show]] that aired on the [[Ottawa]] [[Ontario]] radio station [[CFRA]].

Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action.

Group marriage is considered a form of polyamory. The term does not refer to bigamy as no claim to being married in formal legal terms is made.\n\nThe concept reentered popular consciousness in 1974 with the publication of ''Group Marriage: a study of contemporary multilateral marriage'' by Larry Constantine and Joan Constantine.\n\n==Classification==\nDepending on the sexual orientations of the individuals involved, all adults in the group marriage may be sexual partners of all others with whom they are compatible. For instance, if all members are heterosexual, all the women may have sexual relationships with all the men. If members are bisexual or pansexual, they may have evolved sexual relationships with either sex.\n\nGroup marriage implies a strong commitment to be \"faithful\" by having sex only within the group and intending to remain together for an extended period. The group may be open to taking on new partners, but only if all members of the family agree to accept the new person as a partner. The new person then moves into the household and becomes an equal member of the family.\n\nThe most common form of group marriage appears to be a triad of two women and one man, or less often two men and one woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cat-and-dragon.com/stef/poly/Labriola/open.html |title=Models of Open Relationships by Kathy Labriola |website=Cat-and-dragon.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-22}}</ref> There are also polyfidelitous families formed by two heterosexual couples who become a foursome and live together as a family.\n\n==Legal aspects==\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2015}}\n{{see also|Legal status of polygamy}}\nIn most countries, it is not explicitly illegal for three or more people to form and share a sexual relationship (subject sometimes to laws against [[homosexuality]]), though such relational forms risk running afoul of state or local ordinances banning [[Cohabitation|unmarried cohabitation]]. No Western country permits statutory marriage between more than two people. Nor do they give strong and equal legal protection (e.g., of rights relating to children) to non-married partners \u2014 the legal regime is not comparable to that applied to married couples. Individuals involved in [[polyamorous]] relationships are considered by the law to be no different from people who live together or [[Dating|date]] under other circumstances.\n\n==Non-European cultures==\n*Among the [[Ancient Hawaii]]ans, the relationship of ''punalua'' involved \"the fact that two or more brothers with their wives, or two or more sisters with their husbands, were inclined to possess each other in common\".<ref>Westermarck 1922, Part III, p. 240</ref> [[Friedrich Ratzel]] in ''The History of Mankind'' reported in 1896 that in Hawaii a kind of incipient polyandry arose by the addition to the marriage establishment of a [[cicisbeo]], known as Punalua.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ratzel, Friedrich|title=The History of Mankind|page=277|location=London|publisher=MacMillan  Press|date=1896|url=http://www.inquirewithin.biz/history/american_pacific/oceania/position-women.htm|accessdate=11 April 2010}}</ref>\n*In some parts of [[Melanesia]], there are \"sexual relations between a group of men formed by the husband's brothers and a group of women formed by the wife's sisters\".<ref>Westermarck 1922, Part III, p. 241</ref>\n*Women of [[Nair]] community, a caste in [[Kerala]], [[India]], used to practice polyandry.<ref name=\"Mathew\">{{cite web |last=Mathew |first=Biju |title=Nair Polyandry |website=Kerala |url=http://www.kerala.cc/keralahistory/index14.htm |access-date=2018-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726011905/http://www.kerala.cc/keralahistory/index14.htm |archive-date=2018-07-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*[[Toda people]], who live on the isolated [[Nilgiri mountains|Nilgiri]] plateau of Southern [[India]] practiced [[Polyandry#Fraternal polyandry|adelphic polyandry]] for centuries, but no longer do so.

In the first case it is, taken in combination with the ''tippa-malku'' marriage, a case of bilateral dissimilar adelphic (M. and F.) polygamy. In the latter case it is dissimilar adelphic (tribal) polyandry\". The ''pirrauru'' \"relation arises through the exchange by brothers of their wives\".\n*Among the [[Kurnandaburi]] of Australia, \"a group of men who are own or tribal brothers are united \u2026 in group marriage\".\n*Among the Wakelbura of Australia, there is \"adelphic polyandry.\"\n*Among the Kurnai of Australia, \"unmarried men have access to their brothers' wives.\"\n\n== In modern U.S. practices ==\nGroup marriage occasionally occurred in [[commune (intentional community)|communal]] societies founded in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nA long-lived example was the [[Oneida Community]] founded by [[John Humphrey Noyes]] in 1848.  Noyes taught that he and his followers, having reached 200 in number, had thus undergone [[sanctification]]; that is, it was impossible for them to [[sin]], and that for the sanctified, marriage (along with private property) was abolished as an expression of jealousy and exclusiveness. The Oneida commune lived together as a single large group and shared parental responsibilities. Any given male-female combination in the group was free to have sex, usually upon the man's asking the woman, and this was the common practice for many years. The group began to falter about 1879\u20131881, eventually disbanding after Noyes fled arrest. Several dozen pairs of Oneidans quickly married in traditional fashion. \n\nThe [[Kerista|Kerista Commune]] practiced group marriage in San Francisco from 1971 to 1991, calling their version [[polyfidelity]].\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the number of people who actually practice group marriage in modern societies, as such a form of marriage is not officially recognized or permitted in any jurisdiction in the U.S., and ''[[de jure]]'' illegal in many. It is also not always visible when people sharing a residence consider themselves privately to be a group marriage.\n\n== Portrayal in literature ==\nGroup marriage has been a literary theme, particularly in science fiction, and especially in the later novels of [[Robert A. Heinlein]] such as ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'', ''[[Friday (novel)|Friday]]'', ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'', and ''[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]]''.  ''Stranger in a Strange Land'' describes a communal group much like the [[Oneida Society]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  In at least ''The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress'' and ''Friday'' it is called \"line marriage\".\n\nIn several of her [[Hainish Cycle]] stories, [[Ursula K. Le Guin|Ursula Le Guin]] describes a type of four-person marriage known as a sedoretu, practiced on the planet O.  In this arrangement, two men and two women are married to each other, but each member of the marriage has a sexual relationship only with one male and one female spouse.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Birthday of the World and Other Stories|last=Le Guin|first=Ursula|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn [[James Alan Gardner|James Alan Gardner's]] book [[Vigilant (novel)]] the protagonist is part of a group marriage with multiple men and women involved.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cohabitation in the United States]]\n* [[POSSLQ]]\n* ''[[Proposition 31]]'', a novel by [[Robert Rimmer]]\n* [[Samenlevingscontract]]\n* [[Types of marriages]]\n\n== References ==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book\n | author = Constantine, Larry and Joan\n | title = Group Marriage: A Study of Contemporary Multilateral Marriage\n | publisher = Collier Books\n | year = 1974\n | isbn = 978-0020759102\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Dillard\n | first = J.M. \n | authorlink = Jeanne Kalogridis\n | title = The Lost Years\n | url = https://archive.org/details/lostyears00dill\n | url-access = registration\n | publisher=Pocket Books\n | year = 1990\n | isbn = 978-0-6717-0795-8\n | pages = 440.\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n | author=Emens, Elizabeth F.\n | authorlink = Elizabeth F.

If members are [[bisexual]] or [[pansexual]], they may have evolved sexual relationships with either sex.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nGroup marriage implies a strong commitment to be \"[[Faithfulness|faithful]]\" by having sex only within the group and intending to remain together for an extended period. The group may be open to taking on new partners, but only if all members of the family agree to accept the new person as a partner. The new person then moves into the household and becomes an equal member of the family.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe most common form of group marriage appears to be a [[triad (sociology)|triad]] of two women and one man, or less often two men and one woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cat-and-dragon.com/stef/poly/Labriola/open.html |title=Models of Open Relationships by Kathy Labriola |website=Cat-and-dragon.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-22}}</ref>{{better source|date=February 2018}} There are also [[Polyfidelity|polyfidelitous]] families formed by two heterosexual couples who become a foursome and live together as a family.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Legal aspects==\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2015}}\n{{see also|Legal status of polygamy}}\nIn most countries, it is not explicitly illegal for three or more people to form and share a sexual relationship (subject sometimes to laws against [[homosexuality]]), though such relational forms risk running afoul of state or local ordinances banning [[Cohabitation|unmarried cohabitation]]. No Western country permits statutory marriage between more than two people. Nor do they give strong and equal legal protection (e.g., of rights relating to children) to non-married partners \u2014 the legal regime is not comparable to that applied to married couples. Individuals involved in [[polyamorous]] relationships are considered by the law to be no different from people who live together or [[Dating|date]] under other circumstances.\n\n==Non-European cultures==\n*Among the [[Ancient Hawaii]]ans, the relationship of ''punalua'' involved \"the fact that two or more brothers with their wives, or two or more sisters with their husbands, were inclined to possess each other in common\".<ref>Westermarck 1922, Part III, p. 240</ref> [[Friedrich Ratzel]] in ''The History of Mankind'' reported in 1896 that in Hawaii a kind of incipient polyandry arose by the addition to the marriage establishment of a [[cicisbeo]], known as Punalua.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ratzel, Friedrich|title=The History of Mankind|page=277|location=London|publisher=MacMillan  Press|date=1896|url=http://www.inquirewithin.biz/history/american_pacific/oceania/position-women.htm|accessdate=11 April 2010}}</ref>\n*In some parts of [[Melanesia]], there are \"sexual relations between a group of men formed by the husband's brothers and a group of women formed by the wife's sisters\".<ref>Westermarck 1922, Part III, p. 241</ref>\n*Women of [[Nair]] community, a caste in [[Kerala]], [[India]], used to practice polyandry.<ref name=\"Mathew\">{{cite web |last=Mathew |first=Biju |title=Nair Polyandry |website=Kerala |url=http://www.kerala.cc/keralahistory/index14.htm |access-date=2018-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726011905/http://www.kerala.cc/keralahistory/index14.htm |archive-date=2018-07-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*[[Toda people]], who live on the isolated [[Nilgiri mountains|Nilgiri]] plateau of Southern [[India]] practiced [[Polyandry#Fraternal polyandry|adelphic polyandry]] for centuries, but no longer do so.

In the first case it is, taken in combination with the ''tippa-malku'' marriage, a case of bilateral dissimilar adelphic (M. and F.) polygamy. In the latter case it is dissimilar adelphic (tribal) polyandry\". The ''pirrauru'' \"relation arises through the exchange by brothers of their wives\".\n*Among the [[Kurnandaburi]] of Australia, \"a group of men who are own or tribal brothers are united \u2026 in group marriage\".\n*Among the Wakelbura of Australia, there is \"adelphic polyandry.\"\n*Among the Kurnai of Australia, \"unmarried men have access to their brothers' wives.\"\n\n== In modern U.S. practices ==\nGroup marriage occasionally occurred in [[commune (intentional community)|communal]] societies founded in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nA long-lived example was the [[Oneida Community]] founded by [[John Humphrey Noyes]] in 1848.  Noyes taught that he and his followers, having reached 200 in number, had thus undergone [[sanctification]]; that is, it was impossible for them to [[sin]], and that for the sanctified, marriage (along with private property) was abolished as an expression of jealousy and exclusiveness. The Oneida commune lived together as a single large group and shared parental responsibilities. Any given male-female combination in the group was free to have sex, usually upon the man's asking the woman, and this was the common practice for many years. The group began to falter about 1879\u20131881, eventually disbanding after Noyes fled arrest. Several dozen pairs of Oneidans quickly married in traditional fashion. \n\nThe [[Kerista|Kerista Commune]] practiced group marriage in San Francisco from 1971 to 1991, calling their version [[polyfidelity]].\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the number of people who actually practice group marriage in modern societies, as such a form of marriage is not officially recognized or permitted in any jurisdiction in the U.S., and ''[[de jure]]'' illegal in many. It is also not always visible when people sharing a residence consider themselves privately to be a group marriage.\n\n== Portrayal in literature ==\nGroup marriage has been a literary theme, particularly in science fiction, and especially in the later novels of [[Robert A. Heinlein]] such as ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'', ''[[Friday (novel)|Friday]]'', ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'', and ''[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]]''.  ''Stranger in a Strange Land'' describes a communal group much like the [[Oneida Society]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  In at least ''The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress'' and ''Friday'' it is called \"line marriage\".\n\nIn several of her [[Hainish Cycle]] stories, [[Ursula K. Le Guin|Ursula Le Guin]] describes a type of four-person marriage known as a sedoretu, practiced on the planet O.  In this arrangement, two men and two women are married to each other, but each member of the marriage has a sexual relationship only with one male and one female spouse.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Birthday of the World and Other Stories|last=Le Guin|first=Ursula|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn [[James Alan Gardner|James Alan Gardner's]] book [[Vigilant (novel)]] the protagonist is part of a group marriage with multiple men and women involved.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cohabitation in the United States]]\n* [[POSSLQ]]\n* ''[[Proposition 31]]'', a novel by [[Robert Rimmer]]\n* [[Samenlevingscontract]]\n* [[Types of marriages]]\n\n== References ==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book\n | author = Constantine, Larry and Joan\n | title = Group Marriage: A Study of Contemporary Multilateral Marriage\n | publisher = Collier Books\n | year = 1974\n | isbn = 978-0020759102\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Dillard\n | first = J.M. \n | authorlink = Jeanne Kalogridis\n | title = The Lost Years\n | url = https://archive.org/details/lostyears00dill\n | url-access = registration\n | publisher=Pocket Books\n | year = 1990\n | isbn = 978-0-6717-0795-8\n | pages = 440.\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n | author=Emens, Elizabeth F.\n | authorlink = Elizabeth F.
