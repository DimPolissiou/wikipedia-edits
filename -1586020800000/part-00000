The Spanish [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]] of missionaries and soldiers passed through the area in 1769\u20131770. The site was within the [[Ranchos of California|Spanish land grant]] [[Rancho La Puente]]. [[Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel]] was the center of colonial activities in the area.\n\n===19th century===\nUsing the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]] route at the end of 1841, a group of travelers and settlers, now referred to as the [[John A.

The [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]] from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] was continued east via the [[Santa Fe Trail]] trade route, established in 1821 as a trail and wagon road connecting [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] in [[Missouri Territory]] to Santa Fe, still within M\u00e9xico.<ref name=\"villageprofile.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.villageprofile.com/california/elmonte/02/topic.html |title=El Monte CA &#124; History - Presented by Village Profile |publisher=Villageprofile.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1847, the Santa Fe Trail was also connected westward through the [[Southern Emigrant Trail]], passing by the El Monte area, to the Pueblo of Los Angeles.  Immigrant settlement began in 1849, El Monte was a stopping place for the American immigrants going to the gold fields during the [[California Gold Rush]]. The first permanent residents arrived in El Monte around 1849-1850 mostly from [[Texas]], [[Arkansas]] and [[Missouri]], during a time when thousands migrated to California in search of gold. The first settlers with families were Nicholas Schmidt, Ira W. Thompson, G. and F. Cuddeback, J. Corbin, and J. Sheldon.\n\nThese migrants ventured upon the bounty of fruitful, rich land along the [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]] and began to build homesteads there. The farmers were very pleased at the increasing success of El Monte's agricultural community, and it steadily grew over the years.<ref name=\"villageprofile.com\"/>\n\nIn the 1850s the settlement was briefly named Lexington by American settlers, but soon returned to being called El Monte or Monte. It was at the crossroad of routes between Los Angeles, [[San Bernardino]], and the natural harbor at [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]].  In the early days, it had a reputation as a rough town where men often settled disputes with knives and guns in its gambling saloons. Defense against Indian raids and the crimes of bandit gangs, such as that of [[Joaquin Murrieta]], led to the formation of a local militia company called the [[Monte Rangers]] in February 1854.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/MonteRangers.html |title=Monte Rangers |website=Militarymuseum.org |date=2016-02-08 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}</ref> After the Monte Rangers disbanded, justice for [[Los Angeles County]], in the form of volunteer [[wikt:posse|posse]]s, as in the 1857 hunt for the bandit gang of [[Juan Flores]] and [[Pancho Daniel]], or a [[lynching]], was often provided by the local vigilantes called the \"El Monte Boys\".\n\nIn 1858 the adobe '''Monte Station''' was established, a stagecoach stop on the [[Butterfield Overland Mail in California|Butterfield Overland Mail Section 2]] route.\n\nBy 1861 El Monte had become a sizeable settlement, and during the [[American Civil War]] was considered a Confederate stronghold sympathetic to the [[secession]] of Southern California from California to support the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref name=\"clendenen309\">{{cite journal|last1=Clendenen|first1=Clarence C.|authorlink=Clarence C.

Two European retired circus stars, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Gay, operated this tourist attraction, which has been called \"the Disneyland of the 1920s and 1930s\" by historian Jack Barton,<ref name=\"earthlink1\"/> and many others of that era. The Gays raised wild animals for use in the motion picture industry and housed over 200 African lions.  Many of the lions starred in films during the 1920s and 1930s, including the [[Tarzan]] films starring [[Elmo Lincoln]] and [[Johnny Weissmuller]]. The [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] lion logo was made with two lions from the farm, \"Slats\" (1924\u20131927), and his lookalike successor \"Jackie\" (1928-1956).  In 1925, El Monte Union High School adopted \"The Lions\" name for its teams, and the Gays provided a lion mascot for big games.

The Spanish [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]] of missionaries and soldiers passed through the area in 1769-1770. The site was within the [[Ranchos of California|Spanish land grant]] [[Rancho La Puente]]. [[Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel]] was the center of colonial activities in the area.\n\n===19th century===\nUsing the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]] route at the end of 1841, a group of travelers and settlers, now referred to as the [[John A.

Immigrant settlement began in 1849, El Monte was a stopping place for the American immigrants going to the gold fields during the [[California Gold Rush]]. The first permanent residents arrived in El Monte around 1849-1850 mostly from [[Texas]], [[Arkansas]] and [[Missouri]], during a time when thousands migrated to California in search of gold. The first settlers with families were Nicholas Schmidt, Ira W. Thompson, G. and F. Cuddeback, J. Corbin, and J. Sheldon.\n\nThese migrants ventured upon the bounty of fruitful, rich land along the [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]] and began to build homesteads there. The farmers were very pleased at the increasing success of El Monte's agricultural community, and it steadily grew over the years.<ref name=\"villageprofile.com\"/>\n\nIn the 1850s the settlement was briefly named Lexington by American settlers, but soon returned to being called El Monte or Monte. It was at the crossroad of routes between Los Angeles, [[San Bernardino]], and the natural harbor at [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]].  In the early days, it had a reputation as a rough town where men often settled disputes with knives and guns in its gambling saloons. Defense against Indian raids and the crimes of bandit gangs, such as that of [[Joaquin Murrieta]], led to the formation of a local militia company called the [[Monte Rangers]] in February 1854.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/MonteRangers.html |title=Monte Rangers |website=Militarymuseum.org |date=2016-02-08 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}</ref> After the Monte Rangers disbanded, justice for [[Los Angeles County]], in the form of volunteer [[wikt:posse|posse]]s, as in the 1857 hunt for the bandit gang of [[Juan Flores]] and [[Pancho Daniel]], or a [[lynching]], was often provided by the local vigilantes called the \"El Monte Boys\".\n\nIn 1858 the adobe '''Monte Station''' was established, a stagecoach stop on the [[Butterfield Overland Mail in California|Butterfield Overland Mail Section 2]] route.\n\nBy 1861 El Monte had become a sizeable settlement, and during the [[American Civil War]] was considered a Confederate stronghold sympathetic to the [[secession]] of Southern California from California to support the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref name=\"clendenen309\">{{cite journal|last1=Clendenen|first1=Clarence C.|authorlink=Clarence C.

Two European retired circus stars, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Gay, operated this tourist attraction, which has been called \"the Disneyland of the 1920s and 1930s\" by historian Jack Barton,<ref name=\"earthlink1\"/> and many others of that era. The Gays raised wild animals for use in the motion picture industry and housed over 200 African lions.  Many of the lions starred in films during the 1920s and 1930s, including the [[Tarzan]] films starring [[Elmo Lincoln]] and [[Johnny Weissmuller]]. The [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] lion logo was made with two lions from the farm, \"Slats\" (1924\u20131927), and his lookalike successor \"Jackie\" (1928-1956).  In 1925, El Monte Union High School adopted \"The Lions\" name for its teams, and the Gays provided a lion mascot for big games.

This temperature differential is most pronounced in the spring and summer months and can cause strong [[cold front]]s to form. These cold fronts can be responsible for varied forms of severe weather from [[gale]]s to [[thunderstorm]]s and [[hail]], large temperature drops and heavy rain. Winters, however, are usually very stable, but rather damp and often cloudy.\n\nPort Phillip is often warmer than the surrounding oceans and/or the land mass, particularly in spring and autumn; this can set up a \"bay effect\" similar to the \"[[lake-effect snow|lake effect]]\" seen in colder climates where showers are intensified leeward of the bay. Relatively narrow streams of heavy showers can often affect the same places (usually the eastern suburbs) for an extended period, while the rest of Melbourne and surrounds stays dry. Overall, Melbourne is, owing to the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Otway Ranges]], nonetheless drier than average for southern Victoria. Within the city and surrounds, rainfall varies widely, from around {{convert|425|mm|in|0}} at [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]] to {{convert|1250|mm|in|0}} on the eastern fringe at [[Gembrook, Victoria|Gembrook]]. Melbourne receives 48.6 clear days annually. Dewpoint temperatures in the summer range from {{convert|9.5|to|11.7|C|F}}.<ref name=\"Bureau\">{{BoM Aust stats|site_ref=cw_086071|site_name=Melbourne Regional Office|accessdate=30 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nMelbourne is also prone to isolated convective showers forming when a cold pool crosses the state, especially if there is considerable daytime heating. These showers are often heavy and can include hail, squalls, and significant drops in temperature, but they often pass through very quickly with a rapid clearing trend to sunny and relatively calm weather and the temperature rising back to what it was before the shower. This can occur in the space of minutes and can be repeated many times a day, giving Melbourne a reputation for having \"four seasons in one day\",<ref name=autogenerated1>{{BoM Aust stats|site_ref=cw_086071|site_name=Melbourne Regional Office|accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref> a phrase that is part of local [[popular culture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=269&pg=2325 |title=Welcome to Melbourne |publisher=City of Melbourne |accessdate=18 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719171215/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=269&pg=2325 |archivedate=19 July 2008 |df= }}</ref> The lowest temperature on record is {{convert|-2.8|C|F}}, on 21 July 1869.<ref name=\"snow\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/cdio/weatherData/av?p_nccObsCode=123&p_display_type=dailyDataFile&p_startYear=1869&p_c=-1481637067&p_stn_num=86071 |title=Bureau of Meteorology \u2013 Climate Data Online |accessdate=6 January 2015 }}</ref> The highest temperature recorded in Melbourne city was {{convert|46.4|C|F}}, on [[Black Saturday bushfires|7 February 2009]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_086071_All.shtml |title = Monthly climate statistics | publisher= Bureau of Meteorology | accessdate = 30 March 2012}}</ref> While snow is occasionally seen at higher elevations in the outskirts of the city, it has not been recorded in the Central Business District since 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp4.html|archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp4.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 March 2009|title=BOM -

Melbourne acquired its first public monument, the [[Burke and Wills expedition|Burke and Wills]] statue, in 1864.\n\nWith the gold rush largely over by 1860, Melbourne continued to grow on the back of continuing gold-mining, as the major port for exporting the agricultural products of Victoria (especially wool) and with a developing manufacturing sector protected by high tariffs. An extensive radial railway network spread into the countryside from the late 1850s. Construction started on further major public buildings in the 1860s and 1870s, such as the [[Supreme Court of Victoria|Supreme Court]], [[Government House, Melbourne|Government House]], and the [[Queen Victoria Market]]. The central city filled up with shops and offices, workshops, and warehouses. Large banks and hotels faced the main streets, with fine townhouses in the east end of Collins Street, contrasting with tiny cottages down laneways within the blocks. The Aboriginal population continued to decline, with an estimated 80% total decrease by 1863, due primarily to introduced diseases (particularly [[smallpox]]<ref name=\"rbg.vic.gov.au\"/>), frontier violence and dispossession of their lands.\n\n===Land boom and bust===\n[[File:Melbourne international exhibition 1880.jpg|thumb|Lithograph of the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]]-listed [[Royal Exhibition Building]], built to host the [[Melbourne International Exhibition (1880)|Melbourne International Exhibition]] of 1880]]\n\nThe decade of the 1880s saw extraordinary growth: consumer confidence, easy access to credit, and steep increases in land prices led to an enormous amount of construction.

This temperature differential is most pronounced in the spring and summer months and can cause strong [[cold front]]s to form. These cold fronts can be responsible for varied forms of severe weather from [[gale]]s to [[thunderstorm]]s and [[hail]], large temperature drops and heavy rain. Winters, however, are usually very stable, but rather damp and often cloudy.\n\nPort Phillip is often warmer than the surrounding oceans and/or the land mass, particularly in spring and autumn; this can set up a \"bay effect\" similar to the \"[[lake-effect snow|lake effect]]\" seen in colder climates where showers are intensified leeward of the bay. Relatively narrow streams of heavy showers can often affect the same places (usually the eastern suburbs) for an extended period, while the rest of Melbourne and surrounds stays dry. Overall, Melbourne is, owing to the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Otway Ranges]], nonetheless drier than average for southern Victoria. Within the city and surrounds, rainfall varies widely, from around {{convert|425|mm|in|0}} at [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]] to {{convert|1250|mm|in|0}} on the eastern fringe at [[Gembrook, Victoria|Gembrook]].

{"title_page": "First Doctor comic stories", "text_new": "\n\n'''First Doctor comic stories''' refers to the [[List of Doctor Who comic stories|comic strips]] devoted to the long-running British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', using the likeness of the [[First Doctor]] [[William Hartnell]]. The strip was launched in [[Polystyle Publications|Polystyle's]] ''[[TV Comic]]'' on 14 November 1964, less than a year after the television series began broadcasting and was the first original [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media from the show.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This strip began what has become known as the '[[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|Polystyle era]]': running from 1964 to 1979.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The First Doctor starred in this strip running parallel with his appearance on the television show, ending in December 1966, after which ''TV Comic'' began creating strips for the [[Second Doctor]]. The franchise to print a regular comic strip passed to ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (then ''Doctor Who Weekly'') in 1979, and was opened up to multiple franchises in the mid-2000s. During this time, the First Doctor has made various guest appearances as well as starring in some one-off comic strips. \n\n== Polystyle comic strips (1964-1966) ==\n\n=== History ===\n\n''TV Comic'', according to ''Doctor Who'' historian Jeremy Bentham, 'had grown up in the wake of commercial television. Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\n'''''Artists:''''' There were three artists during the ''TV Comic'' First Doctor period. '''Neville Main''' was the first to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor).<ref name=\"Scoones2012-23-61\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 23-61</ref> Main drew the first 9 stories (46 episodes) of the ''TVC'' strip, plus one single episode strip for the 1965 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and two single episode strips for the 1965 ''TVC Annual 1966''. '''Bill Mevin''' took over for the middle of the run, producing 7 stories (28 episodes) for ''TVC'' between October 1965 and April 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-62-75\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 62-75</ref> Although he produced no ''TVC Holiday Special'' or ''TVC Annual'' strips during this time, he returned later in 1966 to draw one of the two strips single episode strips for that year's ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-91\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 91</ref> After Mevin's relatively short tenure, the ''TVC'' strip was taken on by '''John Canning''' who produced 8 stories (36 episodes) plus two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and one of the two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-77-96\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 77-96</ref> Canning was thus the last of the three artists to draw the First Doctor for ''TVC'', and, furthermore, would go on to kick off the Second Doctor run which began late December 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-100\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 100</ref>\n\n'''''Writers:''''' The situation with the scripts is more complex. Writing in 1982, Jeremy Bentham, the first researcher of ''Doctor Who'' comic strips, believed these strips to have been written by the artists who drew them. Thus in 'those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> However, this view was later revised. John Ainsworth, another comic strip historian, said in an interview: 'There's quite a mystery surrounding around who actually wrote the scripts for the early Hartnell ''Doctor Who'' strips, or indeed, all the Hartnell ''Doctor Who'' strips. It was thought that the artists wrote them, but, after talking to [...] one of the artists, Bill Mevin [...] he doesn't know who wrote them but he knows he did actually work from scripts someone else provided'<ref name=\"Stripped for Action-00:07:01-00:07:24\">''Stripped for Action'' (2008), 00:07:01-00:07:24</ref> In the same documentary, Mevin confirmed this saying, ''TVC'' strips were 'a production line [...] a conveyor belt. I'd get a script and I'd draw it'.<ref name=\"Stripped for Action-00:07:24-00:08:27\">''Stripped for Action'' (2008), 00:07:24-00:08:27</ref> Later research by Paul Scoones in ''The Comic Strip Companion: The Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to Doctor Who in Comics: 1964-1979'' (2012) clarified some aspects of script production. In an overview, Scoones writes: 'Writers and artists were seldom named on the strips, which presents a challenge when trying to credit stories', and while all the artists have been identified, some of the writers 'unfortunately remain unknown'.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-14\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 14</ref> The first writer Scoones identifies is '''David Motton''' with the fifth story of the Neville Main tenure, and a couple more Main strips soon thereafter.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-43\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 43</ref> This information comes from Motton himself, as in a footnote Scoones includes says he corresponded with the writer between March and May 2012.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-44\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 44</ref> \n\n\n'''''Style:''''' Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref>\n\n=== List of comic strips ===\n\nThe list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in ''TV Comic'' (''TVC'') as well the yearly ''TV Comic Holiday Special'' (''TVCHS'') and ''TV Comic Annual'' (''TVCA'').

The strip was launched in [[Polystyle Publications|Polystyle's]] ''[[TV Comic]]'' on 14 November 1964, less than a year after the television series began broadcasting and was the first original [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media from the show.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This strip began what has become known as the '[[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|Polystyle era]]': running from 1964 to 1979.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The First Doctor starred in this strip running parallel with his appearance on the television show, ending in December 1966, after which ''TV Comic'' began creating strips for the [[Second Doctor]]. The franchise to print a regular comic strip passed to ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (then ''Doctor Who Weekly'') in 1979, and was opened up to multiple franchises in the mid-2000s. During this time, the First Doctor has made various guest appearances as well as starring in some one-off comic strips. \n\n== Polystyle comic strips (1964-1966) ==\n\n=== History ===\n\n''TV Comic'', according to ''Doctor Who'' historian Jeremy Bentham, 'had grown up in the wake of commercial television. Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\n'''''Artists:''''' There were three artists during the ''TV Comic'' First Doctor period. '''Neville Main''' was the first to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor).<ref name=\"Scoones2012-23-61\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 23-61</ref> Main drew the first 9 stories (46 episodes) of the ''TVC'' strip, plus one single episode strip for the 1965 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and two single episode strips for the 1965 ''TVC Annual 1966''. '''Bill Mevin''' took over for the middle of the run, producing 7 stories (28 episodes) for ''TVC'' between October 1965 and April 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-62-75\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 62-75</ref> Although he produced no ''TVC Holiday Special'' or ''TVC Annual'' strips during this time, he returned later in 1966 to draw one of the two strips single episode strips for that year's ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-91\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 91</ref> After Mevin's relatively short tenure, the ''TVC'' strip was taken on by '''John Canning''' who produced 8 stories (36 episodes) plus two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and one of the two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-77-96\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 77-96</ref> Canning was thus the last of the three artists to draw the First Doctor for ''TVC'', and, furthermore, would go on to kick off the Second Doctor run which began late December 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-100\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 100</ref>\n\n'''''Writers:''''' The situation with the scripts is more complex. Writing in 1982, Jeremy Bentham, the first researcher of ''Doctor Who'' comic strips, believed these strips to have been written by the artists who drew them. Thus in 'those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> However, this view was later revised. John Ainsworth, another comic strip historian, said in an interview: 'There's quite a mystery surrounding around who actually wrote the scripts for the early Hartnell ''Doctor Who'' strips, or indeed, all the Hartnell ''Doctor Who'' strips. It was thought that the artists wrote them, but, after talking to [...] one of the artists, Bill Mevin [...] he doesn't know who wrote them but he knows he did actually work from scripts someone else provided'<ref name=\"Stripped for Action-00:07:01-00:07:24\">''Stripped for Action'' (2008), 00:07:01-00:07:24</ref> In the same documentary, Mevin confirmed this saying, ''TVC'' strips were 'a production line [...] a conveyor belt. I'd get a script and I'd draw it'.<ref name=\"Stripped for Action-00:07:24-00:08:27\">''Stripped for Action'' (2008), 00:07:24-00:08:27</ref> Later research by Paul Scoones in ''The Comic Strip Companion: The Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to Doctor Who in Comics: 1964-1979'' (2012) clarified some aspects of script production. In an overview, Scoones writes: 'Writers and artists were seldom named on the strips, which presents a challenge when trying to credit stories', and while all the artists have been identified, some of the writers 'unfortunately remain unknown'.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-14\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 14</ref> The first writer Scoones identifies is '''David Mortton''' with the fifth story of the\tNeville Main tenure (from information on scripts submitted to the BBC ''Doctor Who'' production office for sign-off).<ref name=\"Scoones2012-43\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 43</ref> \n\n\n'''''Style:''''' Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref>\n\n=== List of comic strips ===\n\nThe list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in ''TV Comic'' (''TVC'') as well the yearly ''TV Comic Holiday Special'' (''TVCHS'') and ''TV Comic Annual'' (''TVCA'').
