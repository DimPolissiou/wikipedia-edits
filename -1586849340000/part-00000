Neither education nor work can be ensured without a form of law. In relation to tolerant and open societies, members of minority groups often use social integration to gain full access to the opportunities, rights and services available to the members of the [[mainstream]] of society with cultural institutions such as churches and civic organizations. Mass media content also performs a social integration function in mass societies.\n\n\nThe 2005 documentary \u201dUtan gr\u00e4nser \u2013 en film om idrott och integration\u201d (''Without Borders - A Film About Sports and Integration'') was a film described by Swedish newspaper [[Aftonbladet]] as \"a documentary on how to succeed with integration\" of migrants into Swedish society.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nilsson|first1=Christoffer|last2=Melin|first2=Eric|title=Swedish terror suspect was in movie about successful integration - Terrormisst\u00e4nkt svensk var med i film om lyckad integration|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article22616250.ab|accessdate=17 April 2016|work=Aftonbladet|date=15 April 2016|language=Swedish|quote=As an eleven-year-old Osama Krayem participated in a documentary on how to succeed with integration.}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"social integration\" first came into use in the work of French sociologist [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]]. He wanted to understand why rates of suicide were higher in some social classes than others. Durkheim believed that [[society]] exerted a powerful force on individuals. He concluded that a people's beliefs, values, and norms make up a collective consciousness, a shared way of understanding each other and the world.\n\n==Uses==\n\nA 2012 research review found that [[Working class|working-class]] students were less socially integrated than [[Middle Class|middle-class]] students at university.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = M | year = 2012 | title = Social class differences in social integration among students in higher education: A meta-analysis and recommendations for future research | url = | journal = Journal of Diversity in Higher Education | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 22\u201338 | doi=10.1037/a0026162}}</ref><ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/markrubinsocialpsychresearch/working-class-students-are-left-out-at-university Working-Class Students are Left Out at University] Mark Rubin's Social Psychology Research, retrieved 29 March 2013</ref>\n\nRecent research also shows that immigrants should be independent and proactive in order to achieve better social integration in their host countries.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = M. | last2 = Watt | first2 = S.
