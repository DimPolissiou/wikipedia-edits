{"title_page": "Deaths in 2020", "text_new": "{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{Short description|List of notable individuals who died in 2020}}\nThe following deaths of notable individuals occurred in 2020. Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence:\n\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent [[nationality]] (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n\n<!--\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence: Name, age, country of citizenship at birth or nationality if the subject is not eligible (for example, in the case of animals), subsequent nationality (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference. Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * *

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death.

Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of

The player takes on the role of a mercenary and is able to fight for the [[Delian League]], led by [[Classical Athens|Athens]], or the [[Peloponnesian League]], led by [[Sparta]].<ref name=\"Ryan 2018\" /> The game's main storyline has the player character attempting to restore their fractured family after they and their siblings were thrown off a cliff in their youth and left for dead by their father by the command of the Spartan oracle. Parallel quest lines deal with the extirpation of a malign cult spanning the Greek world, and the discovery of artifacts and monsters from [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] times.\n\nAs with previous games in the series, ''Odyssey'' features a narrative set in the modern-day and follows Layla Hassan, who was introduced in ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/new-assassins-creed-odyssey-details-1202840897/|title=New 'Assassin's Creed Odyssey' Details Drop|first=Stefanie|last=Fogel|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 11, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe game features a number of historical personages players can encounter and talk to, including [[Alcibiades|Alkibiades]], [[Archidamus II]], [[Aristophanes]], [[Aspasia]], [[Brasidas]], [[Euripides]], [[Cleon|Kleon]], [[Democritus]], [[Herodotus|Herodotos]], [[Hippocrates|Hippokrates]], [[Pausanias of Sparta|Pausanias]], [[Pericles|Perikles]], [[Phidias]], [[Plato]], [[Polykleitos]], [[Praxilla]], [[Pythagoras]], [[Socrates|Sokrates]], [[Sophocles|Sophokles]], [[Thespis]] and [[Xanthippe]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3311497/gaming/assassins-creed-odyssey-review.html |title=Assassin's Creed Odyssey review in progress: This ancient adventure breathes new life into the series |first=Hayden |last=Dingman |date=5 October 2018 |access-date=11 October 2018 |magazine=[[PC Gamer]] |publisher=[[IDG Communications, Inc.]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://mashable.com/2018/06/11/assassins-creed-odyssey-historical-figures/ |title=7 ancient Greeks who might be your friend in 'Assassin's Creed: Odyssey' |first=Alexis |last=Nedd |date=11 July 2018 |access-date=11 October 2018 |work=[[Mashable]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis, LLC]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Polygon 11 October 2018\">{{cite news |last1=Campbell |first1=Colin |title=Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey\u2019s best historical characters |url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/11/17964372/assassins-creed-odyssey-best-historical-characters-socrates-leonidas |accessdate=12 October 2018 |work=Polygon |date=11 October 2018}}</ref> It includes historical and mythical Greek locations such as the [[Agora of Athens]], [[Cephalonia|Kephallonia]], [[Ithaca]], the [[Odeon of Athens]], the [[Foloi oak forest]], the [[statue of Zeus at Olympia]], [[Naxos]], [[Lesbos]], [[ancient Athens]], [[ancient Argolis]], [[Pnyx]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/08/15/assassins-creed-odyssey-athens |title=Assassin's Creed Odyssey: (Re)Building Athens |date=16 August 2018 |access-date=10 November 2018 |first=Jon |last=Ryan |work=[[IGN Entertainment, Inc.]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref> [[Phokis]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Mesarea|Mesara]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3313058/gaming/assassins-creed-odyssey-historical-locations-ancient-greece.html |title=Assassin's Creed: Odyssey's hidden Historical Locations map is stuffed with Ancient Greek lore |first=Hayden |last=Dingman |date=11 October 2018 |access-date=4 November 2018 |magazine=[[PC World]] |publisher=[[IDG Communications, Inc.]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/2018/10/03/the-stories-behind-assassin-creed-odysseys-mythical-locations |title=The Stories Behind Assassin Creed Odyssey's Mythical Locations |first=Jill |last=Grodt |date=3 October 2018 |access-date=4 November 2018 |magazine=[[Game Informer]]}}</ref> as well as takes on famous creatures from the Greek myths such as [[Medusa]], the [[Cyclops]] and the [[Minotaur]].\n\n===Plot=== \nDuring the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], King [[Leonidas I|Leonidas]] leads the [[Spartan army]] against a [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] charge. The battle is won, but Leonidas is informed by a captured enemy soldier that the existence of the [[Ephialtes of Trachis|mountain path]] has been revealed to the [[Persian army]], which is moving to surround the Spartans by morning. Nevertheless, Leonidas resolves to hold off the Persian advance.\n\nIn the present, Layla Hassan recovers the Spear of Leonidas and together with Victoria Bibeau, extracts the DNA of two individuals from it, the siblings Kassandra and Alexios. With help from the Assassins, Layla picks one of the siblings (the \"Misthios\") and activates the Animus to find the location of the Staff of Hermes.\n\nThe Misthios started as a young Spartan child, raised by their parents Nikolaos and Myrrine, and inherited the Spear of Leonidas from Myrrine as one of Leonidas' descendants. However, one day, both the Misthios and their siblings are thrown off a mountain due to an oracle's prophecy, with the Misthios being dropped by Nikolaos himself. The misthios survived the fall and fled to the island of Kefalonia, where they grew up performing odd jobs until the Peloponnesian War begins.\n\nThe Misthios is approached by a wealthy man named Elpenor, who hires them to assassinate \"The Wolf of Sparta\". The Misthios later discovers that the Wolf is Nikolaos himself and confronts him. Nikolaos admits that he regrets what he had done, but did so for the good of Sparta. The Misthios has the choice of executing or sparing Nikolaos and finds out that Nikolaos is actually their stepfather and that Myrrine is in danger. The Misthios then returns to Elpenor and confronts him over the revelation. Elpenor reveals he knew Nikolaos was their stepfather, and wanted him dead in order to drag out the war. He offers another job to assassinate Myrrine, but the Misthios refuses and Elpenor flees. The Misthios then travels to [[Delphi]] to ask the [[Pythia]] the whereabouts of Myrrine, where they encounter [[Herodotus|Herodotos]], who recognizes the Spear of Leonidas the Misthios carries. Upon meeting the Pythia, the Misthios is warned about the Cult of Kosmos, who seek to kill them and their families. The Misthios further investigates the Cult by assassinating Elpenor and using his disguise to infiltrate a Cult meeting. They find that the Cult plans to take advantage of the war to seize control of all of Greece and that their enforcer Deimos is, in fact, the Misthios' sibling, now brainwashed to follow the Cult's orders.\n\nThe Misthios continues on their journey all over Greece, clearing out Cult corruption from both Sparta and Athens and befriending powerful Greek figures such as [[Pericles|Perikles]] and [[Aspasia]]. They are unable to stop Perikles' assassination at the hands of Deimos but are able to reunite with Myrrine and find their true father, [[Pythagoras]]. Myrrine and Pythagoras explain that they conceived Alexios and Kassandra to preserve Leonidas' bloodline, as he and his descendants have a special connection to Precursor artifacts, such as the Spear of Leonidas. Pythagoras tasks the Misthios to recover several Precursor artifacts needed to permanently seal the hidden Precursor city of Atlantis so that its knowledge cannot be misused by enemies like the Cult. Afterward, the Misthios manages to avenge Perikles' death by assassinating his political rival, [[Cleon|Kleon]]. Depending on the Misthios' actions, they can convince Deimos to abandon the Cult and rebuild their family with Nikolaos, Myrrine, their sibling, and their new stepbrother Stentor living happily together in their old family home.\n\nWith war averted and the Cult virtually eliminated, the Misthios heads for the Cult's secret meeting place under the Temple of Delphi to destroy the Precursor pyramid the Cult was using to influence Greek politics. Touching it, they receive visions of [[Assassin's Creed|future conflicts to come]] before destroying the pyramid. Aspasia then arrives and reveals that she was the original leader of the Cult but disagreed with its actions as its members became more corrupt, and she thanks the Misthios for destroying the Cult. The Misthios has the option of killing or sparing Aspasia, but cuts ties with her regardless. Finally, the Misthios after defeating various Olympos Projects based on monsters from Greek legend (the [[Minotaur]], [[cyclopes]], [[Medusa]] and the [[Sphinx]]) and collects all of the artifacts needed to seal Atlantis from their bodies, and activates a recording from the Precursor Aletheia who pleads with the Misthios and Layla that Precursor knowledge and technology is not meant for humans and must be destroyed in order for humans to reach their true potential. Pythagoras reluctantly passes the Staff of Hermes on to the Misthios, dying in the process. The Misthios then continues their adventures.\n\nIn the present, Layla uses the data from the Animus to find Atlantis and activate it. As the Assassins analyze the data within, Layla is shocked to find the Misthios, kept alive until modern times by the Staff of Hermes. The Misthios warns Layla that the world needs a balance between order and chaos, the Templar Order and Assassins respectively, and either side prevailing over the other will result in the world's doom. The Misthios also explains that Layla is the prophesied one who will bring balance to order and chaos and gives her the Staff of Hermes, sacrificing their life in the process. Layla, however, states that there is so much of the Misthios' life they have not seen, and re-enters the Animus.\n\n===Downloadable content===\nTwo chapters of three episodes each were released to continue the narrative of the main story: ''Legacy of the First Blade''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/04/assassins-creed-odyssey-dlc-a-legacy-of-the-first-blade-bloodline-review|title=Assassin's Creed Odyssey DLC - Legacy of the First Blade: Shadow Heritage Review|work=IGN|date=4 March 2019}}</ref> and ''The Fate of Atlantis''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-odysseys-fate-of-atlantis-trailer-/1100-6466324/|title=Assassin's Creed Odyssey's Fate Of Atlantis Trailer Shows Mythical Beasts And Gods|work=GameSpot|date=18 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n====''Legacy of the First Blade''====\nThis story arc is focused on how ''Odyssey'' is connected to other installments in the ''Assassin's Creed'' series. There are three episodes for the DLC: Hunted, Shadow Heritage and Bloodline.\n\nIn \"Hunted\", the Misthios heads to [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and comes across the Assassin Darius, born [[Artabanus of Persia|Artabanus]], and his child (whose gender depends on the player's choice of character). Macedonia has been overrun by the Order of the Ancients in their quest to kill Darius, his child and the Misthios whom they call the 'Tainted Ones' because they are considered people with the power to destroy the world. The Misthios works with Darius and his child to find and defeat the Huntsman, who is committing atrocities to draw out the Tainted Ones. Darius admits that he worked with the Order in Persia to assassinate [[Xerxes I of Persia]]. When Darius attempted to assassinate [[Artaxerxes I of Persia]], he was stopped by his brother-in-arms Amorges, who believed it was unnecessary to assassinate the new king. Darius' actions saw him branded a traitor and he fled with his only child. With the Huntsman dead, Darius and his child leave Macedonia after saying farewell to the Misthios.\n\nIn \"Shadow Heritage\", the Misthios heads to [[Achaea]] and encounters Darius once again. The Order, led by the Tempest, has set up a naval blockade around the region and is brutalising Macedonian refugess in a bid to prevent Darius and his child from escaping the Greek world. The Misthios is able to weaken the Order's power in Achaea by sabotaging the development of a ship-mounted flamethrower and sinking the Tempest's fleet. Kleia, the Tempest's mother and an ally of the Misthios, reveals that the Order consider the Tempest a Tainted One and that they have been using her. The Tempest dies and the Misthios secures safe passage for the refugees. In the aftermath, Darius and his child decide to settle down with the Misthios in Achaea. Some time later, the Misthios has a son, Elpidios, with Darius' child.\n\nIn \"Bloodline\", the Misthios retires from life as a mercenary to spend time with Darius, Elpidios and his child in Achaea. Amorges and the Order attack their village, killing Darius' child and abducting Elpidios. The Misthios and Darius make their way to [[Messenia]], the Order's stronghold in Greece. They lure Amorges out of hiding, but he refuses to return Elpidios as he believes the Misthios' violent life will ultimately harm him. Amorges claims that the Order is an idea and not a group of people, meaning that the Misthios and Elpidios will always be targeted. However, Darius states that knowledge can fight this and reconciles with Amorges who reveals Elpidios' location and dies. Knowing their son will never be safe, the Misthios entrusts Darius to look after Elpidios. Darius takes Elpidios to Egypt, when the both of them would become ancestors to Aya, wife to Bayek and founder of the Assassin Brotherhood.\n\n====''The Fate of Atlantis''====\n{{plot|date=March 2020}}  \nThis story arc focuses on [[Greek mythology]], and follows the Misthios' quest to learn and unlock the full power of the Staff of Hermes Trismegistus and unlock their hidden sixth sense. There are three episodes: \"Fields of Elysium\", \"Torment of Hades\" and \"Judgement of Atlantis.\"\n\nIn \"Fields of Elysium\", the Misthios explores the Greek afterlife in the paradise of [[Elysium]]. There the Misthios meets [[Persephone]], [[Adonis]], [[Hermes]], and [[Hecate]], members of the Isu race known to humans as gods. [[Hermes]] helps the Misthios acquire more knowledge about the Staff as a rebellion against Persephone's authoritarian rule begins to take shape under the leadership of Adonis. Meanwhile, Hecate plots an uprising of her own, intending to usurp Persephone and take power for herself. After learning the true nature of this Greek paradise, the Misthios and Hermes confront Hecate and Persephone. After a brief argument, Persephone leaves to deal with Adonis's rebellion, which has become an all-out revolt just outside her palace. The Misthios joins the battle, and once it is over accompanies Hermes to confront Persephone and request that she open the gateway between Elysium and Hades, where the Misthios is to continue learning about the Staff. Persephone throws Hermes off a cliff for his disobedience in helping the Misthios, and it is revealed that the key to Hades, itself an Atlantis artifact, has been concealed in the collar of Persephone's dog, Ros. Persephone opens the gateway to the Underworld and tosses the Misthios, Ros, and the Apple of Eden inside. When combined with the Apple of Eden, Ros is actually [[Cerberus]], guardian of the Underworld.\n\nIn \"Torment of Hades\", the Misthios must first battle Cerberus. Once the beast is defeated, the Misthios is approached by [[Hades]], who expresses his displeasure at the death of his guardian. Following the death of Cerberus, rifts between [[Tartarus|Tartaros]] and the Underworld begin opening, releasing souls normally confined to Tartaros back into the Underworld. The Misthios is then tasked with finding a new guardian for each of the four gateways to the Underworld. As the Misthios learns more about the Staff, they reunited with several people from the main story arc. After recruiting [[Perseus]], [[Achilles]], [[Agamemnon]] and [[Heracles]] as guardians for Hades and helping [[Charon]] mitigate the chaos caused by the Tartaros rifts, the Misthios confronts Hades and requests that in exchange for their help, Hades helps them learn more about the Staff of Hermes Trismegistus. Hades reveals that he had no intention of helping the Misthios in any way, and had actually intended them to be the guardian of a fifth gate to the Underworld, which he had hidden from them. The Misthios must then fight Hades, but before he can be fully defeated, [[Poseidon]] appears through a portal and escorts the Misthios to [[Atlantis]].\n\nIn \u201cThe Judgement of Atlantis\u201d, the Misthios enters Atlantis with [[Poseidon]], who is far more forthcoming about his willingness to help the Misthios unlock the full potential of the Staff. Poseidon explains that he is worried about the tense relationship between the Isu and the humans in Atlantis, and appoints the Misthios \"Dikastes\", his second-in-command, in the hopes that appointing a human-Isu hybrid to this position will help quell these tensions. As Dikastes of Atlantis, the Misthios is responsible for enforcing Poseidon's laws and keeping order in the city, while also passing judgement on Atlantis as a whole. Poseidon also encourages the Misthios to uncover more knowledge about the Staff of Hermes Trismegistus along the way. As the Misthios explores Atlantis, it gradually becomes clear that the Isu regularly disobey Poseidon's laws and commit terrible crimes against humanity, the most egregious of which being \"Project Olympos\"&mdash;a genetic engineering program led by the Isu [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and her husband [[Aita]]&mdash;which has been experimenting on abducted human subjects, combining them with Isu artifacts to create terrifying hybrid beasts including the [[Cyclopes]], the [[Minotaur]], the [[Sphinx]], [[Medusa]], and most recently, the [[Hecatoncheires|Hekatonchires]]. After discovering the Project Olympos headquarters, the Misthios returns to Poseidon to pass judgement on Atlantis, but their conversation is interrupted by the appearance of Juno and Aita, who reveal that their final creation, the Hekatonchires, is complete. The Misthios goes to confront the beast, and once it is defeated returns to Poseidon's palace and declares Atlantis beyond saving. Using the Atlantis artifacts the Misthios recovered from Ros and the Hekatonchires, along with the fully activated Staff of Hermes Trismegistus, Poseidon and the Misthios destroy Atlantis. The Misthios then wakes up back in the real world and is told by Aletheia that the memories experienced were simulations but no less real, as they were Aletheia's memories during her time as Dikastes, and of how miserably the Isu had failed to alter their fate.\n\nIn the modern day, Layla experiences all these trials as the Misthios by order of the Isu Aletheia, so she could become the Staff's Keeper. After the rebellion in Elysium, she was pulled out forcefully by her physician Victoria, who fears what this is doing to her. As the two argue, an Abstergo strike team arrives, and Layla kills all but one, telling him to tell their boss Otso Berg that he lost. After helping Hades, Layla is once again forced out by Victoria, who is taking the staff away to keep Layla from killing herself. Layla takes the staff back and accidentally kills Victoria, angering Aletheia, who fears she chose poorly. Layla is able to convince her to give her another chance. After Atlantis' destruction, Layla is warned of an approaching Interloper, who is Otso Berg himself. He wants the staff for the Templar Order to ensure they survive the coming End, but Layla refuses to give it up. They fight and she wins, crippling Otso Berg after telling him the Templars have lost the fight. Eventually, Layla restores communication with the Altair II and informs Alannah about the recent events.\n\n==Release==\nPrior to the game's appearance at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018|E3 2018]], ''Assassin's Creed Odyssey'' was leaked in May 2018 after the French site [[Jeuxvideo.com|Jeuxvideo]] received a keychain containing the name ''Assassin's Creed Odyssey'' on it.

The battle is won, but Leonidas is informed by a captured enemy soldier that the existence of the [[Ephialtes of Trachis|mountain path]] has been revealed to the [[Persian army]], which is moving to surround the Spartans by morning. Nevertheless, Leonidas resolves to hold off the Persian advance.\n\nIn the present, Layla Hassan recovers the Spear of Leonidas and together with Victoria Bibeau, extracts the DNA of two individuals from it, the siblings Kassandra and Alexios. With help from the Assassins, Layla picks one of the siblings (the \"Misthios\") and activates the Animus to find the location of the Staff of Hermes.\n\nThe Misthios started as a young Spartan child, raised by their parents Nikolaos and Myrrine, and inherited the Spear of Leonidas from Myrrine as one of Leonidas' descendants. However, one day, both the Misthios and their siblings are thrown off a mountain due to an oracle's prophecy, with the Misthios being dropped by Nikolaos himself. The misthios survived the fall and fled to the island of Kefalonia, where they grew up performing odd jobs until the Peloponnesian War begins.\n\nThe Misthios is approached by a wealthy man named Elpenor, who hires them to assassinate \"The Wolf of Sparta\". The Misthios later discovers that the Wolf is Nikolaos himself and confronts him. Nikolaos admits that he regrets what he had done, but did so for the good of Sparta. The Misthios has the choice of executing or sparing Nikolaos and finds out that Nikolaos is actually their stepfather and that Myrrine is in danger. The Misthios then returns to Elpenor and confronts him over the revelation. Elpenor reveals he knew Nikolaos was their stepfather, and wanted him dead in order to drag out the war. He offers another job to assassinate Myrrine, but the Misthios refuses and Elpenor flees. The Misthios then travels to [[Delphi]] to ask the [[Pythia]] the whereabouts of Myrrine, where they encounter [[Herodotus|Herodotos]], who recognizes the Spear of Leonidas the Misthios carries. Upon meeting the Pythia, the Misthios is warned about the Cult of Kosmos, who seek to kill them and their families. The Misthios further investigates the Cult by assassinating Elpenor and using his disguise to infiltrate a Cult meeting. They find that the Cult plans to take advantage of the war to seize control of all of Greece and that their enforcer Deimos is, in fact, the Misthios' sibling, now brainwashed to follow the Cult's orders.\n\nThe Misthios continues on their journey all over Greece, clearing out Cult corruption from both Sparta and Athens and befriending powerful Greek figures such as [[Pericles|Perikles]] and [[Aspasia]]. They are unable to stop Perikles' assassination at the hands of Deimos but are able to reunite with Myrrine and find their true father, [[Pythagoras]]. Myrrine and Pythagoras explain that they conceived Alexios and Kassandra to preserve Leonidas' bloodline, as he and his descendants have a special connection to Precursor artifacts, such as the Spear of Leonidas. Pythagoras tasks the Misthios to recover several Precursor artifacts needed to permanently seal the hidden Precursor city of Atlantis so that its knowledge cannot be misused by enemies like the Cult. Afterward, the Misthios manages to avenge Perikles' death by assassinating his political rival, [[Cleon|Kleon]]. Depending on the Misthios' actions, they can convince Deimos to abandon the Cult and rebuild their family with Nikolaos, Myrrine, their sibling, and their new stepbrother Stentor living happily together in their old family home.\n\nWith war averted and the Cult virtually eliminated, the Misthios heads for the Cult's secret meeting place under the Temple of Delphi to destroy the Precursor pyramid the Cult was using to influence Greek politics. Touching it, they receive visions of [[Assassin's Creed|future conflicts to come]] before destroying the pyramid. Aspasia then arrives and reveals that she was the original leader of the Cult but disagreed with its actions as its members became more corrupt, and she thanks the Misthios for destroying the Cult. The Misthios has the option of killing or sparing Aspasia, but cuts ties with her regardless. Finally, the Misthios after defeating various Olympos Projects based on monsters from Greek legend (the [[Minotaur]], [[cyclopes]], [[Medusa]] and the [[Sphinx]]) and collects all of the artifacts needed to seal Atlantis from their bodies, and activates a recording from the Precursor Aletheia who pleads with the Misthios and Layla that Precursor knowledge and technology is not meant for humans and must be destroyed in order for humans to reach their true potential. Pythagoras reluctantly passes the Staff of Hermes on to the Misthios, dying in the process. The Misthios then continues their adventures.\n\nIn the present, Layla uses the data from the Animus to find Atlantis and activate it. As the Assassins analyze the data within, Layla is shocked to find the Misthios, kept alive until modern times by the Staff of Hermes. The Misthios warns Layla that the world needs a balance between order and chaos, the Templar Order and Assassins respectively, and either side prevailing over the other will result in the world's doom. The Misthios also explains that Layla is the prophesied one who will bring balance to order and chaos and gives her the Staff of Hermes, sacrificing their life in the process. Layla, however, states that there is so much of the Misthios' life they have not seen, and re-enters the Animus.\n\n===Downloadable content===\nTwo chapters of three episodes each were released to continue the narrative of the main story: ''Legacy of the First Blade''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/04/assassins-creed-odyssey-dlc-a-legacy-of-the-first-blade-bloodline-review|title=Assassin's Creed Odyssey DLC - Legacy of the First Blade: Shadow Heritage Review|work=IGN|date=4 March 2019}}</ref> and ''The Fate of Atlantis''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-odysseys-fate-of-atlantis-trailer-/1100-6466324/|title=Assassin's Creed Odyssey's Fate Of Atlantis Trailer Shows Mythical Beasts And Gods|work=GameSpot|date=18 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n====''Legacy of the First Blade''====\nThis story arc is focused on how ''Odyssey'' is connected to other installments in the ''Assassin's Creed'' series. There are three episodes for the DLC: Hunted, Shadow Heritage and Bloodline.\n\nIn \"Hunted\", the Misthios heads to [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and comes across the Assassin Darius, born [[Artabanus of Persia|Artabanus]], and his child (whose gender depends on the player's choice of character). Macedonia has been overrun by the Order of the Ancients in their quest to kill Darius, his child and the Misthios whom they call the 'Tainted Ones' because they are considered people with the power to destroy the world. The Misthios works with Darius and his child to find and defeat the Huntsman, who is committing atrocities to draw out the Tainted Ones. Darius admits that he worked with the Order in Persia to assassinate [[Xerxes I of Persia]]. When Darius attempted to assassinate [[Artaxerxes I of Persia]], he was stopped by his brother-in-arms Amorges, who believed it was unnecessary to assassinate the new king. Darius' actions saw him branded a traitor and he fled with his only child. With the Huntsman dead, Darius and his child leave Macedonia after saying farewell to the Misthios.\n\nIn \"Shadow Heritage\", the Misthios heads to [[Achaea]] and encounters Darius once again. The Order, led by the Tempest, has set up a naval blockade around the region and is brutalising Macedonian refugess in a bid to prevent Darius and his child from escaping the Greek world. The Misthios is able to weaken the Order's power in Achaea by sabotaging the development of a ship-mounted flamethrower and sinking the Tempest's fleet. Kleia, the Tempest's mother and an ally of the Misthios, reveals that the Order consider the Tempest a Tainted One and that they have been using her. The Tempest dies and the Misthios secures safe passage for the refugees. In the aftermath, Darius and his child decide to settle down with the Misthios in Achaea. Some time later, the Misthios has a son, Elpidios, with Darius' child.\n\nIn \"Bloodline\", the Misthios retires from life as a mercenary to spend time with Darius, Elpidios and his child in Achaea. Amorges and the Order attack their village, killing Darius' child and abducting Elpidios. The Misthios and Darius make their way to [[Messenia]], the Order's stronghold in Greece. They lure Amorges out of hiding, but he refuses to return Elpidios as he believes the Misthios' violent life will ultimately harm him. Amorges claims that the Order is an idea and not a group of people, meaning that the Misthios and Elpidios will always be targeted. However, Darius states that knowledge can fight this and reconciles with Amorges who reveals Elpidios' location and dies. Knowing their son will never be safe, the Misthios entrusts Darius to look after Elpidios. Darius takes Elpidios to Egypt, when the both of them would become ancestors to Aya, wife to Bayek and founder of the Assassin Brotherhood.\n\n====''The Fate of Atlantis''====\n{{plot|date=March 2020}}  \nThis story arc focuses on [[Greek mythology]], and follows the Misthios' quest to learn and unlock the full power of the Staff of Hermes Trismegistus and unlock their hidden sixth sense. There are three episodes: \"Fields of Elysium\", \"Torment of Hades\" and \"Judgement of Atlantis.\"\n\nIn \"Fields of Elysium\", the Misthios explores the Greek afterlife in the paradise of [[Elysium]]. There the Misthios meets [[Persephone]], [[Adonis]], [[Hermes]], and [[Hecate]], members of the Isu race known to humans as gods. [[Hermes]] helps the Misthios acquire more knowledge about the Staff as a rebellion against Persephone's authoritarian rule begins to take shape under the leadership of Adonis. Meanwhile, Hecate plots an uprising of her own, intending to usurp Persephone and take power for herself. After learning the true nature of this Greek paradise, the Misthios and Hermes confront Hecate and Persephone. After a brief argument, Persephone leaves to deal with Adonis's rebellion, which has become an all-out revolt just outside her palace. The Misthios joins the battle, and once it is over accompanies Hermes to confront Persephone and request that she open the gateway between Elysium and Hades, where the Misthios is to continue learning about the Staff. Persephone throws Hermes off a cliff for his disobedience in helping the Misthios, and it is revealed that the key to Hades, itself an Atlantis artifact, has been concealed in the collar of Persephone's dog, Ros. Persephone opens the gateway to the Underworld and tosses the Misthios, Ros, and the Apple of Eden inside. When combined with the Apple of Eden, Ros is actually [[Cerberus]], guardian of the Underworld.\n\nIn \"Torment of Hades\", the Misthios must first battle Cerberus. Once the beast is defeated, the Misthios is approached by [[Hades]], who expresses his displeasure at the death of his guardian. Following the death of Cerberus, rifts between [[Tartarus|Tartaros]] and the Underworld begin opening, releasing souls normally confined to Tartaros back into the Underworld. The Misthios is then tasked with finding a new guardian for each of the four gateways to the Underworld. As the Misthios learns more about the Staff, they reunited with several people from the main story arc. After recruiting [[Perseus]], [[Achilles]], [[Agamemnon]] and [[Heracles]] as guardians for Hades and helping [[Charon]] mitigate the chaos caused by the Tartaros rifts, the Misthios confronts Hades and requests that in exchange for their help, Hades helps them learn more about the Staff of Hermes Trismegistus. Hades reveals that he had no intention of helping the Misthios in any way, and had actually intended them to be the guardian of a fifth gate to the Underworld, which he had hidden from them. The Misthios must then fight Hades, but before he can be fully defeated, [[Poseidon]] appears through a portal and escorts the Misthios to [[Atlantis]].\n\nIn \u201cThe Judgement of Atlantis\u201d, the Misthios enters Atlantis with [[Poseidon]], who is far more forthcoming about his willingness to help the Misthios unlock the full potential of the Staff. Poseidon explains that he is worried about the tense relationship between the Isu and the humans in Atlantis, and appoints the Misthios \"Dikastes\", his second-in-command, in the hopes that appointing a human-Isu hybrid to this position will help quell these tensions. As Dikastes of Atlantis, the Misthios is responsible for enforcing Poseidon's laws and keeping order in the city, while also passing judgement on Atlantis as a whole. Poseidon also encourages the Misthios to uncover more knowledge about the Staff of Hermes Trismegistus along the way. As the Misthios explores Atlantis, it gradually becomes clear that the Isu regularly disobey Poseidon's laws and commit terrible crimes against humanity, the most egregious of which being \"Project Olympos\"&mdash;a genetic engineering program led by the Isu [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and her husband [[Aita]]&mdash;which has been experimenting on abducted human subjects, combining them with Isu artifacts to create terrifying hybrid beasts including the [[Cyclopes]], the [[Minotaur]], the [[Sphinx]], [[Medusa]], and most recently, the [[Hecatoncheires|Hekatonchires]]. After discovering the Project Olympos headquarters, the Misthios returns to Poseidon to pass judgement on Atlantis, but their conversation is interrupted by the appearance of Juno and Aita, who reveal that their final creation, the Hekatonchires, is complete. The Misthios goes to confront the beast, and once it is defeated returns to Poseidon's palace and declares Atlantis beyond saving. Using the Atlantis artifacts the Misthios recovered from Ros and the Hekatonchires, along with the fully activated Staff of Hermes Trismegistus, Poseidon and the Misthios destroy Atlantis. The Misthios then wakes up back in the real world and is told by Aletheia that the memories experienced were simulations but no less real, as they were Aletheia's memories during her time as Dikastes, and of how miserably the Isu had failed to alter their fate.\n\nIn the modern day, Layla experiences all these trials as the Misthios by order of the Isu Aletheia, so she could become the Staff's Keeper. After the rebellion in Elysium, she was pulled out forcefully by her physician Victoria, who fears what this is doing to her. As the two argue, an Abstergo strike team arrives, and Layla kills all but one, telling him to tell their boss Otso Berg that he lost. After helping Hades, Layla is once again forced out by Victoria, who is taking the staff away to keep Layla from killing herself. Layla takes the staff back and accidentally kills Victoria, angering Aletheia, who fears she chose poorly. Layla is able to convince her to give her another chance. After Atlantis' destruction, Layla is warned of an approaching Interloper, who is Otso Berg himself. He wants the staff for the Templar Order to ensure they survive the coming End, but Layla refuses to give it up.
