The synthesis of cyclin D is initiated during G1 and drives the [[G1/S transition|G1/S phase transition]]. Cyclin D protein is anywhere from 155 (in [[zebra mussel]]) to 477 (in ''[[Drosophila]]'') [[amino acid]]s in length.<ref name=\"NCBI_protein_cyclin_D\"/>\n\nOnce cells reach a critical cell size (and if no mating partner is present in yeast) and if growth factors and mitogens (for multicellular organism) or nutrients (for unicellular organism) are present, cells enter the cell cycle. In general, all stages of the cell cycle are chronologically separated in humans and are triggered by cyclin-[[cyclin-dependent kinase|Cdk]] complexes which are periodically expressed and partially redundant in function. Cyclins are eukaryotic proteins that form holoenzymes with cyclin-dependent protein kinases (Cdk), which they activate. The abundance of cyclins is generally regulated by protein synthesis and degradation through an [[anaphase-promoting complex|APC/C]] dependent pathway.\n\nCyclin D is one of the major cyclins produced in terms of its functional importance. It interacts with four Cdks: [[cyclin-dependent kinase 2|Cdk2]], [[cyclin-dependent kinase 4|4]], [[cyclin-dependent kinase 5|5]], and [[cyclin-dependent kinase 6|6]]. In proliferating cells, cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complex accumulation is of great importance for cell cycle progression. Namely, cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complex partially phosphorylates retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein ([[retinoblastoma protein|Rb]]), whose inhibition can induce expression of some genes (for example: [[cyclin E]]) important for S phase progression.\n\n[[Drosophila]] and many other organisms only have one cyclin D protein. In mice and humans, two more cyclin D proteins have been identified. The three homologues, called [[cyclin D1]], [[cyclin D2]], and [[cyclin D3]] are expressed in most proliferating cells and the relative amounts expressed differ in various cell types.<ref name=\"curie\"/>\n\n== Homologues ==\nThe most studied homologues of cyclin D are found in [[yeast]] and [[virus]]es.\n\nThe yeast homologue of cyclin D, referred to as [[Cln3|CLN3]], interacts with [[Cdc28]] (cell division control protein) during G1.\n\nIn viruses, like Saimiriine herpesvirus 2 (''[[Herpesvirus saimiri]]'') and Human herpesvirus 8 ([[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus|HHV-8]]/[[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus]]) cyclin D homologues have acquired new functions in order to manipulate the host cell\u2019s [[metabolism]] to the viruses\u2019 benefit.<ref name=\"Hardwick_2000\"/> Viral cyclin D binds human [[Cyclin-dependent kinase 6|Cdk6]] and inhibits Rb by phosphorylating it, resulting in free transcription factors which result in protein transcription that promotes passage through G1 phase of the cell cycle. Other than Rb, viral cyclin D-Cdk6 complex also targets [[CDKN1B|p27]]<sup>Kip</sup>, a Cdk inhibitor of cyclin E and A. In addition, viral cyclin D-Cdk6 is resistant to Cdk inhibitors, such as [[p21]]<sup>[[CIP1]]/[[p21|WAF1]]</sup> and [[p16 (gene)|p16]]<sup>[[INK4a]]</sup> which in human cells inhibits Cdk4 by preventing it from forming an active complex with cyclin D.<ref name=\"Hardwick_2000\"/><ref name =\"Kufe_2003\"/>\n\n== Structure ==\n\nCyclin D possesses a tertiary structure similar to other cyclins called the cyclin fold. This contains a core of two compact domains with each having five alpha helices. The first five-helix bundle is a conserved cyclin box, a region of about 100 amino acid residues on all cyclins, which is needed for Cdk binding and activation. The second five-helix bundle is composed of the same arrangement of helices, but the primary sequence of the two subdomains is distinct.<ref name=\"Morgan_2007\"/> All three D-type cyclins (D1, D2, D3) have the same alpha 1 helix hydrophobic patch. However, it is composed of different amino acid residues as the same patch in cyclins E, A, and B.<ref name=\"Morgan_2007\"/>\n\n== Function ==\n \nGrowth factors stimulate the [[Ras (protein)|Ras]]/Raf/[[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK]] that induce cyclin D production.<ref name=\"Albanese_1995\" /> One of the members of the pathways, [[MAPK]] activates a transcription factor [[Myc]], which alters transcription of genes important in cell cycle, among which is cyclin D. In this way, cyclin D is synthesized as long as the growth factor is present.\n\nCyclin D levels in proliferating cells are sustained as long as the growth factors are present, a key player for G1/S transition is active cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complexes. Cyclin D has no effect on G1/S transition unless it forms a complex with Cdk 4 or 6.\n\n=== G1/S transition ===\n\nOne of the best known substrates of cyclin D/Cdk4 and -6 is the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein ([[Retinoblastoma protein|Rb]]). Rb is an important regulator of genes responsible for progression through the cell cycle, in particular through G1/S phase.\n\nOne model proposes that cyclin D quantities, and thus cyclin D- Cdk4 and -6 activity, gradually increases during G1 rather than oscillating in a set pattern as do S and M cyclins. This happens in response to sensors of external growth-regulatory signals and cell growth, and Rb is phosphorylated as a result. Rb reduces its binding to E2F and thereby allows E2F-mediated activation of the transcription of cyclin E and cyclin A, which bind to Cdk1 and Cdk2 respectively to create complexes that continue with Rb phosphorylation.<ref name=\"Merrick_2011\"/> <ref name=\"Resnitzky_1995\"/> Cyclin A and E dependent kinase complexes also function to inhibit the E3 ubiquitin ligase APC/C activating subunit Cdh1 through phosphorylation, which stabilizes substrates such as cyclin A.<ref name=\"Di Fiore_2015\"/> The coordinated activation of this sequence of interrelated positive feedback loops through cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases drives commitment to cell division to and past the G1/S checkpoint.\n\nAnother model proposes that cyclin D levels remain nearly constant through G1.<ref name=\"Hitomi_1999\"/> Rb is mono-phosphorylated during early to mid-G1by cyclin D-Cdk4,6, opposing the idea that its activity gradually increases. Cyclin D dependent monophosphorylated Rb still interacts with E2F transcription factors in a way that inhibits transcription of enzymes that drive the G1/S transition. Rather, E2F dependent transcription activity increases when that of Cdk2 increases and hyperphosphorylates Rb towards the end of G1.<ref name=\"Narasimha_2014\"/>\nRb may not be the only target for cyclin D to promote cell proliferation and progression through the cell cycle. The cyclin D-Cdk4,6, complex, through phosphorylation and inactivation of metabolic enzymes, also influences cell survival. Through close analysis of different Rb-docking helices, a consensus helix sequence motif was identified, which can be utilized to identify potential non-canonical substrates that cyclin D-Cdk4,6 could use to promote proliferation.<ref name=\"Topacio_2019\"/>\n\n=== Docking to Rb ===\n\nRxL- and LxCxE- based docking mutations broadly affect cyclin-Cdk complexes. Mutations of key Rb residues previously observed to be needed for Cdk complex docking interactions result in reduced overall kinase activity towards Rb. The LxCxE binding cleft in the Rb pocket domain, which is has been shown to interact with proteins such as cyclin D and viral oncoproteins, has only a marginal 1.7 fold reduction in phosphorylation by cyclin D-Cdk4,6 when removed. Similarly, when the RxL motif, shown to interact with the S phase cyclins E and A, is removed, cyclin D-Cdk4,6 activity has a 4.1 fold reduction. Thus, the RxL- and LxCxE based docking sites have interactions with cyclin D-Cdk4,6 like they do with other cyclins, and removal of them have modest a modest effect in G1 progression.<ref name=\"Topacio_2019\"/>\n\nCyclin D-Cdk 4,6 complexes target Rb for phosphorylation through docking a C-terminal helix. When the final 37 amino acid residues are truncated, it had previously been shown that Rb phosphorylation levels are reduced and G1 arrest is induced.<ref name=\"Gorges_2008\"/> Kinetic assays have shown that with the same truncation, the reduction of Rb phosphorylation by cyclin D1-Cdk4,6 is 20 fold and Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) is significantly increased. The phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin B-Cdk1, and cyclin E-Cdk2 are unaffected.<ref name=\"Topacio_2019\"/>\n\nThe C terminus has a stretch of 21 amino acids with alpha-helix propensity. Deletion of this helix or disruption of it via proline residue substitutions also show a significant reduction in Rb phosphorylation. The orientation of the residues, along with the acid-base properties and polarities are all critical for docking. Thus, the LxCxE, RxL, and helix docking sites all interact with different parts of cyclin D, but disruption of any two of the three mechanism can disrupt the phosphorylation of Rb in vitro.<ref name=\"Topacio_2019\"/> The helix binding, perhaps the most important, functions as a structural requirement. It makes evolving more difficult, leading the cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complex to have relatively small number of substrates relative to other cyclin-Cdk complexes.<ref name=\"Anders_2011\"/> Ultimately this contributes to the adequate phosphorylation of a key target in Rb. \n\nAll six cyclin D-Cdk4,6 complexes (cyclin D1/D2/D3 with Cdk4/6) target Rb for phosphorylation through helix-based docking. The shared \u03b1 1 helix hydrophobic patch that all cyclin D\u2019s have is not responsible for recognizing the C-terminal helix. Rather, it recognizes the RxL sequences that are linear, including those on Rb. Through experiments with purified cyclin D1-Cdk2, it was concluded that the helix docking site likely lies on cyclin D rather than the Cdk4,6. As a result, likely another region on cyclin D recognizes the Rb C-terminal helix. \n\nSince Rb\u2019s C \u2013 terminal helix exclusively binds cyclin D-Cdk4,6 and not other cell cycle dependent cyclin-Cdk complexes, through experiments mutating this helix in HMEC cells,<ref name=\"Sack_2018\"/> it has been conclusively shown that the cyclin D \u2013 Rb interaction is critical in the following roles (1) promoting the G1/S transition (2) allowing Rb dissociation from chromatin, and (3) E2F1 activation.\n\n== Regulation ==\n\n=== In vertebrates ===\n\nCyclin D is regulated by the downstream pathway of mitogen receptors via the Ras/MAP [[kinase]] and the [[\u03b2-catenin]]-Tcf/[[Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1|LEF]] pathways <ref name = \"Shtutman_1999\" /> and [[Phosphoinositide 3-kinase|PI3K]].<ref name = \"Albanese_2003\" /> The MAP kinase ERK activates the downstream [[transcription factor]]s Myc, [[AP-1 (transcription factor)|AP-1]] <ref name=\"Albanese_1995\"/> and Fos<ref name = \"Brown_1998\" /> which in turn activate the transcription of the [[Cdk4]], [[Cdk6]] and cyclin D genes, and increase [[ribosome]] biogenesis. [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho]] family [[GTPase]]s,<ref name = \"Joyce_1999\" /> integrin linked kinase<ref name = \"D'Amico_2000\" /> and focal adhesion kinase ([[PTK2|FAK]]) activate cyclin D gene in response to [[integrin]].<ref name=\"Assoian_2008\"/>\n\np27<sup>kip1</sup> and p21<sup>cip1</sup> are cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors ([[Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein|CKIs]]) which negatively regulate CDKs. However they are also promoters of the cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex. Without p27 and p21, cyclin D levels are reduced and the complex is not formed at detectable levels.<ref name=\"Cheng_1999\"/>\n\nIn eukaryotes, overexpression of translation initiation factor 4E ([[eIF4E]]) leads to an increased level of cyclin D protein and increased amount of cyclin D mRNA outside of the nucleus.<ref name =\"Rosenwald_1995\"/> This is because eIF4E promotes the export of cyclin D mRNAs out of the nucleus.<ref name =\"Culjkovic_2005\"/>\n\nInhibition of cyclin D via i.a. inactivation or degradation leads to cell cycle exit and differentiation. Inactivation of cyclin D is triggered by several cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein (CKIs) like the [[Ink4|INK4]] family (e.g. [[P14arf|p14]], [[CDKN2B|p15]], [[p16 (gene)|p16]], [[CDKN2C|p18]]). INK4 proteins are activated in response to hyperproliferative stress response that inhibits cell proliferation due to overexpression of e.g. Ras and Myc. Hence, INK4 binds to cyclin D- dependent CDKs and inactivates the whole complex.<ref name =\"curie\"/> Glycogen synthase kinase three beta, [[GSK3B|GSK3\u03b2]], causes Cyclin D degradation by inhibitory phosphorylation on [[threonine]] 286 of the Cyclin D protein.<ref name =\"Dieh_1998\"/> GSK3\u03b2 is negatively controlled by the PI3K pathway in form of phosphorylation, which is one of several ways in which growth factors regulate cyclin D. Amount of cyclin D in the cell can also be regulated by transcriptional induction, stabilization of the protein, its translocation to the nucleus and its assembly with Cdk4 and Cdk6.<ref name=\"Takahashi-Yanaga_2008\"/>\n\nIt has been shown that the inhibition of cyclin D (cyclin D1 and 2, in particular) could result from the induction of WAF1/[[p21|CIP1]]/p21 protein by PDT. By inhibiting cyclin D, this induction also inhibits Ckd2 and 6. All these processes combined lead to an arrest of the cell in G0/G1 stage.<ref name =\"Kufe_2003\"/>\n\nThere are two ways in which DNA damage affects Cdks. Following DNA damage, cyclin D (cyclin D1) is rapidly and transiently degraded by the [[proteasome]]. This degradation causes release of p21 from Cdk4 complexes, which inactivates Cdk2 in a p53-independent manner. Another way in which DNA damage targets Cdks is [[p53]]-dependent induction of p21, which inhibits cyclin E-Cdk2 complex. In healthy cells, wild-type p53 is quickly degraded by the proteasome. However, DNA damage causes it to accumulate by making it more stable.<ref name=\"curie\"/>\n\n=== In yeast ===\nA simplification in yeast is that all cyclins bind to the same Cdc subunit, the Cdc28. Cyclins in yeast are controlled by expression, inhibition via CKIs like Far1, and degradation by [[ubiquitin]]-mediated [[proteolysis]].<ref name=\"Bloom_2007\"/>\n\n== Role in cancer ==\n\nGiven that many human [[cancer]]s happen in response to errors in cell cycle regulation and in growth factor dependent intracellular pathways, involvement of cyclin D in cell cycle control and growth factor signaling makes it a possible [[oncogene]]. In normal cells overproduction of cyclin D shortens the duration of G1 phase only, and considering the importance of cyclin D in growth factor signaling, defects in its regulation could be responsible for absence of growth regulation in cancer cells. Uncontrolled production of cyclin D affects amounts of cyclin D-Cdk4 complex being formed, which can drive the cell through the G0/S checkpoint, even when the  growth factors are not present.\n\nEvidence that cyclin D1 is required for tumorigenesis includes the finding that inactivation of cyclin D1 by anti-sense<ref name=\"Lee_2000\" /> or gene deletion<ref name = \"Yu_2001\" /> reduced breast tumor and gastrointestinal tumor growth<ref name = \"Hulit_2004\" /> in vivo. Cyclin D1 overexpression is sufficient for the induction of mammary tumorigenesis,<ref name = \"Wang_1994\" /> attributed to the induction of cell proliferation, increased cell survival,<ref name = \"Albanese_1999\" /> induction of chromosomal instability,<ref name = \"Casimiro_2012\" /><ref name = \"Casimiro_2015\" />  restraint of autophagy<ref name = \"Casimiro_2017\" /><ref name = \"Brown_2012\" /> and potentially non-canonical functions.<ref name = \"Pestell_2013\" />\n\nOverexpression is induced as a result of gene amplification, growth factor or oncogene induced expression by Src,<ref name = \"Lee_1999\" /> Ras,<ref name=\"Albanese_1995\"/> ErbB2,<ref name=\"Lee_2000\"/> STAT3,<ref name = \"Bromberg_1999\" /> STAT5,<ref name = \"Matsumura_1999\" />  impaired protein degradation, or chromosomal translocation. Gene amplification is responsible for overproduction of cyclin D protein in [[bladder cancer]] and [[esophageal carcinoma]], among others.<ref name=\"Kufe_2003\"/>\n \nIn cases of [[sarcoma]]s, [[Colon (anatomy)|colorectal]] cancers and [[melanoma]]s, cyclin D overproduction is noted, however, without the amplification of the chromosomal region that encodes it ([[chromosome 11]]q13, putative oncogene [[PRAD1]], which has been identified as a translocation event in case of mantle cell lymphoma<ref name=\"Auto81-2\"/>).\nIn [[parathyroid adenoma]], cyclin D hyper-production is caused by chromosomal translocation, which would place expression of cyclin D (more specifically, cyclin D1) under an inappropriate [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]], leading to overexpression. In this case, cyclin D gene has been translocated to the [[Parathyroid gland|parathyroid]] [[hormone]] gene, and this event caused abnormal levels of cyclin D.<ref name =\"Kufe_2003\"/>\nThe same mechanisms of overexpression of cyclin D is observed in some tumors of the [[antibody]]-producing [[B cell]]s. Likewise, overexpression of cyclin D protein due to gene translocation is observed in human [[breast cancer]].<ref name =\"Kufe_2003\"/><ref name=\"Lodish_1999\"/>\n\nAdditionally, the development of cancer is also enhanced by the fact that retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb), one of the key substrates of cyclin D-Cdk 4/6 complex, is quite frequently mutated in human [[tumor]]s. In its active form, Rb prevents crossing of the G1 checkpoint by blocking transcription of genes responsible for advances in cell cycle. Cyclin D/Cdk4 complex phosphorylates Rb, which inactivates it and allows for the cell to go through the checkpoint. In the event of abnormal inactivation of Rb, in cancer cells, an important regulator of cell cycle progression is lost. When Rb is mutated, levels of cyclin D and p16INK4 are normal.<ref name =\"Kufe_2003\"/>\n\nAnother regulator of passage through G1 restriction point is Cdk inhibitor p16, which is encoded by INK4 gene. P16 functions in inactivating cyclin D/Cdk 4 complex. Thus, blocking transcription of INK4 gene would increase cyclin D/Cdk4 activity, which would in turn result in abnormal inactivation of Rb. On the other hand, in case of cyclin D in cancer cells (or loss of p16INK4) wild-type Rb is retained. Due to the importance of p16INK/cyclin D/Cdk4 or 6/Rb  pathway in growth factor signaling, mutations in any of the players involved can give rise to cancer.<ref name =\"Kufe_2003\" />\n\n== Mutant phenotype ==\nStudies with mutants suggest that cyclins are positive regulators of cell cycle entry. In yeast, expression of any of the three G1 cyclins triggers cell cycle entry. Since cell cycle progression is related to cell size, mutations in Cyclin D and its homologues show a delay in cell cycle entry and thus, cells with variants in cyclin D have bigger than normal cell size at cell division.<ref name=\"Sanes\"/><ref name=\"Geng_2001\"/>\n\np27<sup>\u2212</sup>/<sup>\u2212</sup> knockout phenotype show an overproduction of cells because cyclin D is not inhibited anymore, while p27<sup>\u2212</sup>/<sup>\u2212</sup> and cyclin D<sup>\u2212</sup>/<sup>\u2212</sup> knockouts develop normally.<ref name =\"Sanes\"/><ref name = \"Geng_2000\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cyclin-dependent kinase|CDK]]\n* [[Cyclin]]s\n* [[Cell cycle]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist | refs =\n\n<ref name = \"Albanese_1995\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Albanese C, Johnson J, Watanabe G, Eklund N, Vu D, Arnold A, Pestell RG | title = Transforming p21ras mutants and c-Ets-2 activate the cyclin D1 promoter through distinguishable regions | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 270 | issue = 40 | pages = 23589\u201397 | date = October 1995 | pmid = 7559524 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.270.40.23589 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n<ref name = \"Albanese_1999\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Albanese C, D'Amico M, Reutens AT, Fu M, Watanabe G, Lee RJ, Kitsis RN, Henglein B, Avantaggiati M, Somasundaram K, Thimmapaya B, Pestell RG | display-authors = 6 | title = Activation of the cyclin D1 gene by the E1A-associated protein p300 through AP-1 inhibits cellular apoptosis | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 274 | issue = 48 | pages = 34186\u201395 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10567390 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.274.48.34186 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n<ref name = \"Albanese_2003\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Albanese C, Wu K, D'Amico M, Jarrett C, Joyce D, Hughes J, Hulit J, Sakamaki T, Fu M, Ben-Ze'ev A, Bromberg JF, Lamberti C, Verma U, Gaynor RB, Byers SW, Pestell RG | display-authors = 6 | title = IKKalpha regulates mitogenic signaling through transcriptional induction of cyclin D1 via Tcf | journal = Molecular Biology of the Cell | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 585\u201399 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12589056 | pmc = 149994 | doi = 10.1091/mbc.02-06-0101 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name = \"Anders_2011\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Anders L, Ke N, Hydbring P, Choi YJ, Widlund HR, Chick JM, Zhai H, Vidal M, Gygi SP, Braun P, Sicinski P | display-authors = 6 | title = A systematic screen for CDK4/6 substrates links FOXM1 phosphorylation to senescence suppression in cancer cells | journal = Cancer Cell | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 620\u201334 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22094256 | doi = 10.1016/j.ccr.2011.10.001 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n<ref name = \"Assoian_2008\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Assoian RK, Klein EA | title = Growth control by intracellular tension and extracellular stiffness | journal = Trends in Cell Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 347\u201352 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18514521 | pmc = 2888483 | doi = 10.1016/j.tcb.2008.05.002 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name = \"Auto81-2\">{{cite web | url = http://www.scbt.com/datasheet-20044-cyclin-d1-dcs-6-antibody.html | title = Cyclin D1 Antibody (DCS-6) | work = Santa Cruz Biotech }}</ref>\n\n<ref name = \"Bloom_2007\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bloom J, Cross FR | title = Multiple levels of cyclin specificity in cell-cycle control | journal = Nature Reviews.

The synthesis of cyclin D is initiated during G1 and drives the [[G1/S transition|G1/S phase transition]]. Cyclin D protein is anywhere from 155 (in [[zebra mussel]]) to 477 (in ''[[Drosophila]]'') [[amino acid]]s in length.<ref name=\"NCBI_protein_cyclin_D\"/>\n\nOnce cells reach a critical cell size (and if no mating partner is present in yeast) and if growth factors and mitogens (for multicellular organism) or nutrients (for unicellular organism) are present, cells enter the cell cycle. In general, all stages of the cell cycle are chronologically separated in humans and are triggered by cyclin-[[cyclin-dependent kinase|Cdk]] complexes which are periodically expressed and partially redundant in function. Cyclins are eukaryotic proteins that form holoenzymes with cyclin-dependent protein kinases (Cdk), which they activate. The abundance of cyclins is generally regulated by protein synthesis and degradation through an [[anaphase-promoting complex|APC/C]] dependent pathway.\n\nCyclin D is one of the major cyclins produced in terms of its functional importance. It interacts with four Cdks: [[cyclin-dependent kinase 2|Cdk2]], [[cyclin-dependent kinase 4|4]], [[cyclin-dependent kinase 5|5]], and [[cyclin-dependent kinase 6|6]]. In proliferating cells, cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complex accumulation is of great importance for cell cycle progression. Namely, cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complex partially phosphorylates retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein ([[retinoblastoma protein|Rb]]), whose inhibition can induce expression of some genes (for example: [[cyclin E]]) important for S phase progression.\n\n[[Drosophila]] and many other organisms only have one cyclin D protein. In mice and humans, two more cyclin D proteins have been identified. The three homologues, called [[cyclin D1]], [[cyclin D2]], and [[cyclin D3]] are expressed in most proliferating cells and the relative amounts expressed differ in various cell types.<ref name=\"curie\"/>\n\n== Homologues ==\nThe most studied homologues of cyclin D are found in [[yeast]] and [[virus]]es.\n\nThe yeast homologue of cyclin D, referred to as [[Cln3|CLN3]], interacts with [[Cdc28]] (cell division control protein) during G1.\n\nIn viruses, like Saimiriine herpesvirus 2 (''[[Herpesvirus saimiri]]'') and Human herpesvirus 8 ([[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus|HHV-8]]/[[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus]]) cyclin D homologues have acquired new functions in order to manipulate the host cell\u2019s [[metabolism]] to the viruses\u2019 benefit.<ref name=\"Hardwick_2000\"/> Viral cyclin D binds human [[Cyclin-dependent kinase 6|Cdk6]] and inhibits Rb by phosphorylating it, resulting in free transcription factors which result in protein transcription that promotes passage through G1 phase of the cell cycle. Other than Rb, viral cyclin D-Cdk6 complex also targets [[CDKN1B|p27]]<sup>Kip</sup>, a Cdk inhibitor of cyclin E and A. In addition, viral cyclin D-Cdk6 is resistant to Cdk inhibitors, such as [[p21]]<sup>[[CIP1]]/[[p21|WAF1]]</sup> and [[p16 (gene)|p16]]<sup>[[INK4a]]</sup> which in human cells inhibits Cdk4 by preventing it from forming an active complex with cyclin D.<ref name=\"Hardwick_2000\"/><ref name =\"Kufe_2003\"/>\n\n== Structure ==\n\nCyclin D possesses a tertiary structure similar to other cyclins called the cyclin fold. This contains a core of two compact domains with each having five alpha helices. The first five-helix bundle is a conserved cyclin box, a region of about 100 amino acid residues on all cyclins, which is needed for Cdk binding and activation. The second five-helix bundle is composed of the same arrangement of helices, but the primary sequence of the two subdomains is distinct.<ref name=\"Morgan_2007\"/> All three D-type cyclins (D1, D2, D3) have the same alpha 1 helix hydrophobic patch. However, it is composed of different amino acid residues as the same patch in cyclins E, A, and B.<ref name=\"Morgan_2007\"/>\n\n== Function ==\n \nGrowth factors stimulate the [[Ras (protein)|Ras]]/Raf/[[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK]] that induce cyclin D production.<ref name=\"Albanese_1995\" /> One of the members of the pathways, [[MAPK]] activates a transcription factor [[Myc]], which alters transcription of genes important in cell cycle, among which is cyclin D. In this way, cyclin D is synthesized as long as the growth factor is present.\n\nCyclin D levels in proliferating cells are sustained as long as the growth factors are present, a key player for G1/S transition is active cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complexes. Cyclin D has no effect on G1/S transition unless it forms a complex with Cdk 4 or 6.\n\n=== G1/S transition ===\n\nOne of the best known substrates of cyclin D/Cdk4 and -6 is the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein ([[Retinoblastoma protein|Rb]]). Rb is an important regulator of genes responsible for progression through the cell cycle, in particular through G1/S phase.\n\nOne model proposes that cyclin D quantities, and thus cyclin D- Cdk4 and -6 activity, gradually increases during G1 rather than oscillating in a set pattern as do S and M cyclins. This happens in response to sensors of external growth-regulatory signals and cell growth, and Rb is phosphorylated as a result. Rb reduces its binding to E2F and thereby allows E2F-mediated activation of the transcription of cyclin E and cyclin A, which bind to Cdk1 and Cdk2 respectively to create complexes that continue with Rb phosphorylation.<ref name=\"Merrick_2011\"/> <ref name=\"Resnitzky_1995\"/> Cyclin A and E dependent kinase complexes also function to inhibit the E3 ubiquitin ligase APC/C activating subunit Cdh1 through phosphorylation, which stabilizes substrates such as cyclin A.<ref name=\"Di Fiore_2015\"/> The coordinated activation of this sequence of interrelated positive feedback loops through cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases drives commitment to cell division to and past the G1/S checkpoint.\n\nAnother model proposes that cyclin D levels remain nearly constant through G1.<ref name=\"Hitomi_1999\"/> Rb is mono-phosphorylated during early to mid-G1by cyclin D-Cdk4,6, opposing the idea that its activity gradually increases. Cyclin D dependent monophosphorylated Rb still interacts with E2F transcription factors in a way that inhibits transcription of enzymes that drive the G1/S transition. Rather, E2F dependent transcription activity increases when that of Cdk2 increases and hyperphosphorylates Rb towards the end of G1.<ref name=\"Narasimha_2014\"/>\nRb may not be the only target for cyclin D to promote cell proliferation and progression through the cell cycle. The cyclin D-Cdk4,6, complex, through phosphorylation and inactivation of metabolic enzymes, also influences cell survival. Through close analysis of different Rb-docking helices, a consensus helix sequence motif was identified, which can be utilized to identify potential non-canonical substrates that cyclin D-Cdk4,6 could use to promote proliferation.<ref name=\"Topacio_2019\"/>\n\n=== Docking to Rb ===\n\nRxL- and LxCxE- based docking mutations broadly affect cyclin-Cdk complexes. Mutations of key Rb residues previously observed to be needed for Cdk complex docking interactions result in reduced overall kinase activity towards Rb. The LxCxE binding cleft in the Rb pocket domain, which is has been shown to interact with proteins such as cyclin D and viral oncoproteins, has only a marginal 1.7 fold reduction in phosphorylation by cyclin D-Cdk4,6 when removed. Similarly, when the RxL motif, shown to interact with the S phase cyclins E and A, is removed, cyclin D-Cdk4,6 activity has a 4.1 fold reduction. Thus, the RxL- and LxCxE based docking sites have interactions with cyclin D-Cdk4,6 like they do with other cyclins, and removal of them have modest a modest effect in G1 progression.<ref name=\"Topacio_2019\"/>\n\nCyclin D-Cdk 4,6 complexes target Rb for phosphorylation through docking a C-terminal helix. When the final 37 amino acid residues are truncated, it had previously been shown that Rb phosphorylation levels are reduced and G1 arrest is induced.<ref name=\"Gorges_2008\"/> Kinetic assays have shown that with the same truncation, the reduction of Rb phosphorylation by cyclin D1-Cdk4,6 is 20 fold and Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) is significantly increased. The phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin B-Cdk1, and cyclin E-Cdk2 are unaffected.<ref name=\"Topacio_2019\"/>\n\nThe C terminus has a stretch of 21 amino acids with alpha-helix propensity. Deletion of this helix or disruption of it via proline residue substitutions also show a significant reduction in Rb phosphorylation. The orientation of the residues, along with the acid-base properties and polarities are all critical for docking. Thus, the LxCxE, RxL, and helix docking sites all interact with different parts of cyclin D, but disruption of any two of the three mechanism can disrupt the phosphorylation of Rb in vitro.<ref name=\"Topacio_2019\"/> The helix binding, perhaps the most important, functions as a structural requirement. It makes evolving more difficult, leading the cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complex to have relatively small number of substrates relative to other cyclin-Cdk complexes.<ref name=\"Anders_2011\"/> Ultimately this contributes to the adequate phosphorylation of a key target in Rb. \n\nAll six cyclin D-Cdk4,6 complexes (cyclin D1/D2/D3 with Cdk4/6) target Rb for phosphorylation through helix-based docking. The shared \u03b1 1 helix hydrophobic patch that all cyclin D\u2019s have is not responsible for recognizing the C-terminal helix. Rather, it recognizes the RxL sequences that are linear, including those on Rb. Through experiments with purified cyclin D1-Cdk2, it was concluded that the helix docking site likely lies on cyclin D rather than the Cdk4,6. As a result, likely another region on cyclin D recognizes the Rb C-terminal helix. \n\nSince Rb\u2019s C \u2013 terminal helix exclusively binds cyclin D-Cdk4,6 and not other cell cycle dependent cyclin-Cdk complexes, through experiments mutating this helix in HMEC cells,<ref name=\"Sack_2018\"/> it has been conclusively shown that the cyclin D \u2013 Rb interaction is critical in the following roles (1) promoting the G1/S transition (2) allowing Rb dissociation from chromatin, and (3) E2F1 activation.\n\n== Regulation ==\n\n=== In vertebrates ===\n\nCyclin D is regulated by the downstream pathway of mitogen receptors via the Ras/MAP [[kinase]] and the [[\u03b2-catenin]]-Tcf/[[Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1|LEF]] pathways <ref name = \"Shtutman_1999\" /> and [[Phosphoinositide 3-kinase|PI3K]].<ref name = \"Albanese_2003\" /> The MAP kinase ERK activates the downstream [[transcription factor]]s Myc, [[AP-1 (transcription factor)|AP-1]] <ref name=\"Albanese_1995\"/> and Fos<ref name = \"Brown_1998\" /> which in turn activate the transcription of the [[Cdk4]], [[Cdk6]] and cyclin D genes, and increase [[ribosome]] biogenesis. [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho]] family [[GTPase]]s,<ref name = \"Joyce_1999\" /> integrin linked kinase<ref name = \"D'Amico_2000\" /> and focal adhesion kinase ([[PTK2|FAK]]) activate cyclin D gene in response to [[integrin]].<ref name=\"Assoian_2008\"/>\n\np27<sup>kip1</sup> and p21<sup>cip1</sup> are cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors ([[Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein|CKIs]]) which negatively regulate CDKs. However they are also promoters of the cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex. Without p27 and p21, cyclin D levels are reduced and the complex is not formed at detectable levels.<ref name=\"Cheng_1999\"/>\n\nIn eukaryotes, overexpression of translation initiation factor 4E ([[eIF4E]]) leads to an increased level of cyclin D protein and increased amount of cyclin D mRNA outside of the nucleus.<ref name =\"Rosenwald_1995\"/> This is because eIF4E promotes the export of cyclin D mRNAs out of the nucleus.<ref name =\"Culjkovic_2005\"/>\n\nInhibition of cyclin D via i.a. inactivation or degradation leads to cell cycle exit and differentiation. Inactivation of cyclin D is triggered by several cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein (CKIs) like the [[Ink4|INK4]] family (e.g. [[P14arf|p14]], [[CDKN2B|p15]], [[p16 (gene)|p16]], [[CDKN2C|p18]]). INK4 proteins are activated in response to hyperproliferative stress response that inhibits cell proliferation due to overexpression of e.g. Ras and Myc. Hence, INK4 binds to cyclin D- dependent CDKs and inactivates the whole complex.<ref name =\"curie\"/> Glycogen synthase kinase three beta, [[GSK3B|GSK3\u03b2]], causes Cyclin D degradation by inhibitory phosphorylation on [[threonine]] 286 of the Cyclin D protein.<ref name =\"Dieh_1998\"/> GSK3\u03b2 is negatively controlled by the PI3K pathway in form of phosphorylation, which is one of several ways in which growth factors regulate cyclin D. Amount of cyclin D in the cell can also be regulated by transcriptional induction, stabilization of the protein, its translocation to the nucleus and its assembly with Cdk4 and Cdk6.<ref name=\"Takahashi-Yanaga_2008\"/>\n\nIt has been shown that the inhibition of cyclin D (cyclin D1 and 2, in particular) could result from the induction of WAF1/[[p21|CIP1]]/p21 protein by PDT. By inhibiting cyclin D, this induction also inhibits Ckd2 and 6. All these processes combined lead to an arrest of the cell in G0/G1 stage.<ref name =\"Kufe_2003\"/>\n\nThere are two ways in which DNA damage affects Cdks. Following DNA damage, cyclin D (cyclin D1) is rapidly and transiently degraded by the [[proteasome]]. This degradation causes release of p21 from Cdk4 complexes, which inactivates Cdk2 in a p53-independent manner. Another way in which DNA damage targets Cdks is [[p53]]-dependent induction of p21, which inhibits cyclin E-Cdk2 complex. In healthy cells, wild-type p53 is quickly degraded by the proteasome. However, DNA damage causes it to accumulate by making it more stable.<ref name=\"curie\"/>\n\n=== In yeast ===\nA simplification in yeast is that all cyclins bind to the same Cdc subunit, the Cdc28. Cyclins in yeast are controlled by expression, inhibition via CKIs like Far1, and degradation by [[ubiquitin]]-mediated [[proteolysis]].<ref name=\"Bloom_2007\"/>\n\n== Role in cancer ==\n\nGiven that many human [[cancer]]s happen in response to errors in cell cycle regulation and in growth factor dependent intracellular pathways, involvement of cyclin D in cell cycle control and growth factor signaling makes it a possible [[oncogene]]. In normal cells overproduction of cyclin D shortens the duration of G1 phase only, and considering the importance of cyclin D in growth factor signaling, defects in its regulation could be responsible for absence of growth regulation in cancer cells. Uncontrolled production of cyclin D affects amounts of cyclin D-Cdk4 complex being formed, which can drive the cell through the G0/S checkpoint, even when the  growth factors are not present.\n\nEvidence that cyclin D1 is required for tumorigenesis includes the finding that inactivation of cyclin D1 by anti-sense<ref name=\"Lee_2000\" /> or gene deletion<ref name = \"Yu_2001\" /> reduced breast tumor and gastrointestinal tumor growth<ref name = \"Hulit_2004\" /> in vivo. Cyclin D1 overexpression is sufficient for the induction of mammary tumorigenesis,<ref name = \"Wang_1994\" /> attributed to the induction of cell proliferation, increased cell survival,<ref name = \"Albanese_1999\" /> induction of chromosomal instability,<ref name = \"Casimiro_2012\" /><ref name = \"Casimiro_2015\" />  restraint of autophagy<ref name = \"Casimiro_2017\" /><ref name = \"Brown_2012\" /> and potentially non-canonical functions.<ref name = \"Pestell_2013\" />\n\nOverexpression is induced as a result of gene amplification, growth factor or oncogene induced expression by Src,<ref name = \"Lee_1999\" /> Ras,<ref name=\"Albanese_1995\"/> ErbB2,<ref name=\"Lee_2000\"/> STAT3,<ref name = \"Bromberg_1999\" /> STAT5,<ref name = \"Matsumura_1999\" />  impaired protein degradation, or chromosomal translocation. Gene amplification is responsible for overproduction of cyclin D protein in [[bladder cancer]] and [[esophageal carcinoma]], among others.<ref name=\"Kufe_2003\"/>\n \nIn cases of [[sarcoma]]s, [[Colon (anatomy)|colorectal]] cancers and [[melanoma]]s, cyclin D overproduction is noted, however, without the amplification of the chromosomal region that encodes it ([[chromosome 11]]q13, putative oncogene [[PRAD1]], which has been identified as a translocation event in case of mantle cell lymphoma<ref name=\"Auto81-2\"/>).\nIn [[parathyroid adenoma]], cyclin D hyper-production is caused by chromosomal translocation, which would place expression of cyclin D (more specifically, cyclin D1) under an inappropriate [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]], leading to overexpression. In this case, cyclin D gene has been translocated to the [[Parathyroid gland|parathyroid]] [[hormone]] gene, and this event caused abnormal levels of cyclin D.<ref name =\"Kufe_2003\"/>\nThe same mechanisms of overexpression of cyclin D is observed in some tumors of the [[antibody]]-producing [[B cell]]s. Likewise, overexpression of cyclin D protein due to gene translocation is observed in human [[breast cancer]].<ref name =\"Kufe_2003\"/><ref name=\"Lodish_1999\"/>\n\nAdditionally, the development of cancer is also enhanced by the fact that retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb), one of the key substrates of cyclin D-Cdk 4/6 complex, is quite frequently mutated in human [[tumor]]s. In its active form, Rb prevents crossing of the G1 checkpoint by blocking transcription of genes responsible for advances in cell cycle. Cyclin D/Cdk4 complex phosphorylates Rb, which inactivates it and allows for the cell to go through the checkpoint. In the event of abnormal inactivation of Rb, in cancer cells, an important regulator of cell cycle progression is lost. When Rb is mutated, levels of cyclin D and p16INK4 are normal.<ref name =\"Kufe_2003\"/>\n\nAnother regulator of passage through G1 restriction point is Cdk inhibitor p16, which is encoded by INK4 gene. P16 functions in inactivating cyclin D/Cdk 4 complex. Thus, blocking transcription of INK4 gene would increase cyclin D/Cdk4 activity, which would in turn result in abnormal inactivation of Rb. On the other hand, in case of cyclin D in cancer cells (or loss of p16INK4) wild-type Rb is retained. Due to the importance of p16INK/cyclin D/Cdk4 or 6/Rb  pathway in growth factor signaling, mutations in any of the players involved can give rise to cancer.<ref name =\"Kufe_2003\" />\n\n== Mutant phenotype ==\nStudies with mutants suggest that cyclins are positive regulators of cell cycle entry. In yeast, expression of any of the three G1 cyclins triggers cell cycle entry. Since cell cycle progression is related to cell size, mutations in Cyclin D and its homologues show a delay in cell cycle entry and thus, cells with variants in cyclin D have bigger than normal cell size at cell division.<ref name=\"Sanes\"/><ref name=\"Geng_2001\"/>\n\np27<sup>\u2212</sup>/<sup>\u2212</sup> knockout phenotype show an overproduction of cells because cyclin D is not inhibited anymore, while p27<sup>\u2212</sup>/<sup>\u2212</sup> and cyclin D<sup>\u2212</sup>/<sup>\u2212</sup> knockouts develop normally.<ref name =\"Sanes\"/><ref name = \"Geng_2000\">\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cyclin-dependent kinase|CDK]]\n* [[Cyclin]]s\n* [[Cell cycle]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist | refs =\n\n<ref name = \"Albanese_1995\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Albanese C, Johnson J, Watanabe G, Eklund N, Vu D, Arnold A, Pestell RG | title = Transforming p21ras mutants and c-Ets-2 activate the cyclin D1 promoter through distinguishable regions | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 270 | issue = 40 | pages = 23589\u201397 | date = October 1995 | pmid = 7559524 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.270.40.23589 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n<ref name = \"Albanese_1999\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Albanese C, D'Amico M, Reutens AT, Fu M, Watanabe G, Lee RJ, Kitsis RN, Henglein B, Avantaggiati M, Somasundaram K, Thimmapaya B, Pestell RG | display-authors = 6 | title = Activation of the cyclin D1 gene by the E1A-associated protein p300 through AP-1 inhibits cellular apoptosis | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 274 | issue = 48 | pages = 34186\u201395 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10567390 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.274.48.34186 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n<ref name = \"Albanese_2003\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Albanese C, Wu K, D'Amico M, Jarrett C, Joyce D, Hughes J, Hulit J, Sakamaki T, Fu M, Ben-Ze'ev A, Bromberg JF, Lamberti C, Verma U, Gaynor RB, Byers SW, Pestell RG | display-authors = 6 | title = IKKalpha regulates mitogenic signaling through transcriptional induction of cyclin D1 via Tcf | journal = Molecular Biology of the Cell | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 585\u201399 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12589056 | pmc = 149994 | doi = 10.1091/mbc.02-06-0101 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name = \"Anders_2011\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Anders L, Ke N, Hydbring P, Choi YJ, Widlund HR, Chick JM, Zhai H, Vidal M, Gygi SP, Braun P, Sicinski P | display-authors = 6 | title = A systematic screen for CDK4/6 substrates links FOXM1 phosphorylation to senescence suppression in cancer cells | journal = Cancer Cell | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 620\u201334 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22094256 | doi = 10.1016/j.ccr.2011.10.001 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n<ref name = \"Assoian_2008\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Assoian RK, Klein EA | title = Growth control by intracellular tension and extracellular stiffness | journal = Trends in Cell Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 347\u201352 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18514521 | pmc = 2888483 | doi = 10.1016/j.tcb.2008.05.002 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name = \"Auto81-2\">{{cite web | url = http://www.scbt.com/datasheet-20044-cyclin-d1-dcs-6-antibody.html | title = Cyclin D1 Antibody (DCS-6) | work = Santa Cruz Biotech }}</ref>\n\n<ref name = \"Bloom_2007\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bloom J, Cross FR | title = Multiple levels of cyclin specificity in cell-cycle control | journal = Nature Reviews.

It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on 5 June 2018, and for [[Nintendo Switch]] on 29 October 2019. But should have never been released at all. It is a pathetic attempt at making an RPG.\nWhile some [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] battles are mandatory, most combat can be avoided, and the player is under no obligation to kill innocents to finish the game. [[Dialogue options]] are used for conversation and hunting prey to feed on, which replenishes strength and [[Experience point#Level-based progression|levels up]] the lead character. Weapons and supernatural abilities are employed while combatting enemies. Set during the era of the [[Spanish flu]], [[London]] serves as a fictionalised semi-[[open world]] composed of four districts, amenable to destruction based on the player's actions. Their choices also determine which of the four endings they receive.\n\nTo gather an understanding of the background, the developers researched the setting by travelling to London and consulting history books and documentaries. The visuals were made with fictional and factual reference points in mind. [[Olivier Deriviere]] composed the original score and infused it with [[industrial music]]. The game was met with mixed reviews from critics, who praised the primary game mechanic, setting, character development, and voice acting, but criticised the combat, overall narrative, technical problems, aspects of the choice-based system, and animations. The game surpassed one million copies sold within ten months.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Vampyr'' is an [[action role-playing game]] played from a [[third-person view]].<ref name=\"third person\" /> The player controls Jonathan E. Reid,<ref name=\"E\" /> a doctor who was made into a [[vampire]], and whose thirst for blood compels him to kill innocent people. To do this successfully, he must gather information about his targets\u2014study and change their habits, collect clues, and maintain relationships by [[Dialogue tree|communicating]] with the sixty citizens under his care in [[London]],<ref name=\"information\" /><ref name=\"more\" /><ref name=\"Thirlwell-Feb2018\" /> which serves as a fictionalised semi-[[open world]] built around hubs of neighbourhoods tethered to other areas.<ref name=\"boss\" /><ref name=\"semi\" /><ref name=\"mesmerise\" /> A [[skill tree]] facilitates the improvement of abilities, which is fuelled by [[experience point]]s<ref name=\"skill tree\" /> gained from blood and, alternatively, investigation.<ref name=\"blood investigation\" /> Feeding on human blood provides nourishment in addition to unlocking new vampiric powers.<ref name=\"E\" /> Abilities can be manually activated and passively upgraded.

If killed, they impart their last thought to Reid.<ref name=\"impart\" /> The \"Mesmerise\" ability can control the behaviour of weaker targets, like coercing them into revealing information,<ref name=\"coercing\" /> or guiding them to less conspicuous areas so as to feed without resorting to combat.<ref name=\"mesmerise\" /> With crafted medicine, Reid can heal injured or sick victims, whom if eaten,<ref name=\"boss\" /><ref name=\"if eaten\" /> will yield more experience points in the process;<ref name=\"more\" /> the rate of their affliction can be viewed using vampire senses,<ref name=\"affliction\" /> which also detect blood.<ref name=\"w4yp01nt\" /> Each of the four districts has a score based on the average health of its citizens.<ref name=\"four\" /><ref name=\"districts\" /> Reid navigates London using a [[waypoint]],<ref name=\"w4yp01nt\" /> and collectible documents are scattered around the city.<ref name=\"Billcliffe-Jun2018\" />\n\n[[File:Vampyr gameplay.gif|right|thumb|250px|Reid engages in combat with his enemies, using supernatural abilities.]]\n\nReid can wield improvised [[melee weapon]]s, such as a saw, as well as [[ranged weapon]]s including the [[Webley Revolver]].<ref name=\"information\" /><ref name=\"webley\" /> Being able to use three-hit [[Combo (video gaming)|combos]], dodge rolls, and [[Parry (fencing)|parrying]],<ref name=\"Thirlwell-Feb2018\" /> he can fight against other vampires like him\u2014[[aristocrat]]s who go by the name of Ekon; sewer-dwelling vampires known as Skals; the Vulkod\u2014a stronger breed of vampire resembling [[werewolves]]; Nemrod\u2014vampires who hunt their own kind;<ref name=\"ekon\" /> and the Guard of Priwen\u2014a secret society of [[Vampire hunter|vampire slayers]].<ref name=\"turned to\" /> [[Boss (video gaming)|Boss]] fights are featured,<ref name=\"boss\" /> and in some cases mandatory.<ref name=\"Variety-May2018\" /> Reid is adaptable to other vampire features, like the claws of a Vulkod.<ref name=\"ekon\" /> Weapon improvement through crafting is made possible by looting items.

Overwhelmed with bloodlust, he causes the death of his sister Mary, who was searching for his body nearby. Reid takes shelter from vampire hunters in an abandoned house and starts hearing the disembodied voice of his maker, a typical feature in the progeny of vampires. Realising London is profuse with corpses, he follows a blood trail to a bar. The bartender points Reid to William Bishop, a suspicious patron. Bishop is caught feeding on a man named Sean Hampton and is killed by the vampire Lady Ashbury. Doctor Edgar Swansea rescues Hampton and hires Reid to practice medicine at Pembroke Hospital.\n\nAfter the room of patient Harriet Jones is found covered in blood and Hampton disappears, Reid tracks him down for questioning. Hampton insists he did not murder Jones and directs him to an underground haven for corrupted vampires known as Skals, where it is revealed that Jones faked her death. Reid later discovers a corpse in the street bearing his mother's [[brooch]]. He pursues the perpetrator towards the cemetery in [[Whitechapel]] and finds his sister Mary with their mother Emelyne, realising Mary was turned into a vampire the night he fed on her. Mary is intent on killing him to rid herself of his voice, but dies trying. Reid vows to uncover what is behind the Skal epidemic, which he learns has been mistaken for the [[Spanish flu]].\n\nLady Ashbury invites Reid to the [[West End of London|West End]] on behalf of the Ascalon Club, a secret society of highborn vampires. By the order of its leader Lord Redgrave, Reid roots out the source of Skals in the district. Swansea is later kidnapped and, once located, admits to attempting to heal Jones with Lady Ashbury's blood, thereby creating the Skal epidemic; once Ashbury finds out, she flees in shame. It is made known that the entity Myrddin, claimant to the role of Jonathan's maker, sired him to defeat his mother [[Morrigan]], also known as the \"Red Queen\", after she possessed Jones to wreak havoc upon London. Reid defeats Morrigan in battle, resolving then to travel after Lady Ashbury to her family castle, where she hid with her maker [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]].\n\n==Development==\nDevelopment began with a team of sixty people, later expanded to around eighty, many of whom worked on [[Dontnod Entertainment]]'s previous project ''[[Life Is Strange]]''.<ref name=\"more\" /><ref name=\"eighty\" /><ref name=\"MCV-Nov2017\" /> For a short time, the developer considered setting the game in [[United States in the 1950s|1950s America]],<ref name=\"America\" /> but after narrative director St\u00e9phane Beauverger joined the project,<ref name=\"MCV-Nov2017\" /> it was discarded to inspire a more [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] mood with focus on the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, set in London. The paintings of [[Phil Hale]] influenced the art style, also for the purpose of atmosphere.<ref name=\"tentative 17\" /> Dontnod researched the setting by visiting London and taking photographs,<ref name=\"more\" /> but since the city had been largely rebuilt, history books and documentaries concerning [[Whitechapel]], the [[London Docks]], and the [[Isle of Dogs]] were also consulted.<ref name=\"viable\" /> The literary sources ''Liquid History: The Thames Through Time'' and ''The Book of Facial Expressions: Babies to Teens'' provided [[Geography|geographical]] and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] insight, respectively,<ref name=\"3dg3\" /> while the television series ''[[Casualty 1900s]]'' and ''[[The Knick]]'' were turned to for medical information.<ref name=\"turned to\" /> [[Anthony Howell (actor)|Anthony Howell]] was hired to voice Jonathan Reid.<ref name=\"VampyrGame-Jun2018\" /> The characters and dialogue were scripted by two French writers and translated into English by two native speakers.

He also commended the \"enthralling\" characterisations, \"exquisite\" setting, and \"captivating\" voice acting.<ref name=\"GSpot\" /> ''[[GamesRadar+]]''{{'}}s Leon Hurley, like Schaefer, found the mechanic of testing Reid's morality compelling, calling the characters well-realised and integral. Also approved of was the \"atmospheric victorian London setting\".<ref name=\"GRadar\" /> Brandin Tyrrel, writing for ''[[IGN]]'', termed ''Vampyr'' \"a fresh and genuine take\" on vampire mythology. He was generally satisfied with how choices turned out and said the recreation of London as a \"gloomy, somber city\" was bolstered by authentic characters, whose writing and performances he also enjoyed. Tyrrel welcomed the story and enjoyed the citizen mechanics,<ref name=\"IGN\" /> something Andy Kelly at ''[[PC Gamer]]'' also appreciated, hoping that more video games would follow suit. He called the dialogue-driven storytelling \"compelling\" and the setting \"atmospheric\".<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /> Alice Bell of ''VideoGamer.com'' wrote, \"''Vampyr'' serves delicious ladles of angst and drama with a hearty slice of excellent, morally grey choice system that will genuinely surprise you, all wrapped up in a wonderfully gloomy London\".<ref name=\"VG\" />\n\nConversely, Mersereau scolded the overall narrative for its \"threadbare\" contribution. He called the combat \"a low-grade ''[[The Witcher (video game)|Witcher]]'' knockoff\", complaining about its lack of precision and \"sloppy\" mechanics. Lengthy [[loading screen]]s and constant [[Hang (computing)|hangings]] were also cited as a source of annoyance.<ref name=\"Destruct\" /> Schaefer lambasted the animations for being \"a little wonky\" and the unpolished nature of the game.<ref name=\"EGM\" /> To Utley, ''Vampyr'' failed to impress, in particular its character development and impact of choice. He also had technical problems (low resolution, \"choppy\" performance, and lengthy loading times).<ref name=\"GameRev\" /> Already frustrated with the combat, Clark said frame rate drops and frequent loading screens worsened the experience. He found that the narrative became weaker in the final chapters.<ref name=\"GSpot\" /> Hurley viewed the combat as \"functional at best\"; \"solid if uninventive\", and chastised how small decisions led to big mistakes, which he felt forfeited responsibility for one's actions.<ref name=\"GRadar\" /> Tyrrel cited lip syncing as a primary concern of the animation, criticised the lack of variety in combat, and experienced the same technical difficulties as Mersereau, Utley, and Clark, albeit noting that they amounted to minor annoyances.<ref name=\"IGN\" /> Kelly disliked the \"dull, repetitive\" combat sequences and, despite noting a variety of fighting styles, saw this ultimately as a \"tiresome\" distraction.<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /> Agreeing with many others on the combat, Bell described it as continuously turning \"sour\".<ref name=\"VG\" />\n\n===Sales and accolades===\nFocus Home Interactive stated that ''Vampyr'' would be considered successful if it sold one million copies, although half would turn a profit.<ref name=\"Dealessandri-Nov2017\" /> It debuted in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France as the best-selling video game across all formats,<ref name=\"Handrahan-Jun2018\" /><ref name=\"Vincent-Jul2018\" /> reaching second place on the Italian chart (behind ''[[FIFA 18]]'').<ref name=\"Pugliese-Jun2018\" /> ''Vampyr'' sold 450,000 copies after one month of release,<ref name=\"Jones-Jul2018\" /> contributing to an increase of over twenty percent of its publisher's revenue for the first quarter of 2018.<ref name=\"Vincent-Jul2018\" /> That October, the publisher cited ''Vampyr'' as a key factor in its second quarter's [[\u20ac]]44.3 million revenue.<ref name=\"Wise-Oct2018\" /> By April 2019, ''Vampyr'' had sold one million copies; these sales contributed to a 22.1% rise in revenue for Dontnod, equivalent to a {{\u20ac|10.5&nbsp;million|link=yes}} increase from the previous [[fiscal year]].<ref name=\"Actusnews-Apr2019-A\" /><ref name=\"Actusnews-Apr2019-B\" />\n\nAt [[E3 2017]], ''Vampyr'' received one of [[GamesRadar+]]'s Best of E3 awards<ref name=\"e32017\" /> and was nominated for [[GamesBeat]]'s Unreal Underdog award<ref name=\"bestofu\" /> and [[Game Critics Awards]]' Best RPG award.<ref name=\"bestofgca\" /><ref name=\"gc4w\" /> It was later nominated for the Best Console Game, Best Screenplay, and Best Soundtrack awards at the 2018 Ping Awards,<ref name=\"PingAwards-Nov2018\" /> and for \"Best Role-Playing Game\" at the [[Fun & Serious Game Festival|Titanium Awards]],<ref name=\"TitaniumAwards-Dec2018\" /> and won the \"Game, Original Role Playing\" award at the [[National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers|NAVGTR]] Awards, whereas its other nominations were for the \"Original Dramatic Score, New IP\" and \"Use of Sound, New IP\" awards.<ref name=\"NAVGTR-Feb2019\" /><ref name=\"NAVGTR-Mar2019\" />\n\n==Television adaptation==\nIn August 2018, it was announced that the television production company [[Fox 21 Television Studios]] had [[optioned]] ''Vampyr'' as a series, with [[Wonderland Sound and Vision]] and DJ2 Entertainment also attached to the project.

It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on 5 June 2018, and for [[Nintendo Switch]] on 29 October 2019. The plot relates to how Jonathan Reid, a doctor who has turned into a [[vampire]], comes to terms with his [[undead]] condition as he is torn between the [[Hippocratic Oath#\"First do no harm\"|Hippocratic Oath]] and his newfound bloodthirsty nature.\n\nWhile some [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] battles are mandatory, most combat can be avoided, and the player is under no obligation to kill innocents to finish the game. [[Dialogue options]] are used for conversation and hunting prey to feed on, which replenishes strength and [[Experience point#Level-based progression|levels up]] the lead character. Weapons and supernatural abilities are employed while combatting enemies. Set during the era of the [[Spanish flu]], [[London]] serves as a fictionalised semi-[[open world]] composed of four districts, amenable to destruction based on the player's actions. Their choices also determine which of the four endings they receive.\n\nTo gather an understanding of the background, the developers researched the setting by travelling to London and consulting history books and documentaries. The visuals were made with fictional and factual reference points in mind. [[Olivier Deriviere]] composed the original score and infused it with [[industrial music]]. The game was met with mixed reviews from critics, who praised the primary game mechanic, setting, character development, and voice acting, but criticised the combat, overall narrative, technical problems, aspects of the choice-based system, and animations. The game surpassed one million copies sold within ten months.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Vampyr'' is an [[action role-playing game]] played from a [[third-person view]].<ref name=\"third person\" /> The player controls Jonathan E. Reid,<ref name=\"E\" /> a doctor who was made into a [[vampire]], and whose thirst for blood compels him to kill innocent people. To do this successfully, he must gather information about his targets\u2014study and change their habits, collect clues, and maintain relationships by [[Dialogue tree|communicating]] with the sixty citizens under his care in [[London]],<ref name=\"information\" /><ref name=\"more\" /><ref name=\"Thirlwell-Feb2018\" /> which serves as a fictionalised semi-[[open world]] built around hubs of neighbourhoods tethered to other areas.<ref name=\"boss\" /><ref name=\"semi\" /><ref name=\"mesmerise\" /> A [[skill tree]] facilitates the improvement of abilities, which is fuelled by [[experience point]]s<ref name=\"skill tree\" /> gained from blood and, alternatively, investigation.<ref name=\"blood investigation\" /> Feeding on human blood provides nourishment in addition to unlocking new vampiric powers.<ref name=\"E\" /> Abilities can be manually activated and passively upgraded. Active skills afford defensive, aggressive, healing, and tactical measures; passive skills increase health, stamina, the blood gauge and absorption, bite damage and regeneration, and carry capacity.<ref name=\"Chandler-Jun2018\" />\n\nIf one so chooses, anyone can be targeted, bearing consequences for London.<ref name=\"information\" /><ref name=\"America\" /><ref name=\"londizens\" /> It is possible to finish the game without killing citizens,<ref name=\"third person\" /> which best preserves the character's cover as a doctor,<ref name=\"cover\" /> but leaves him nearly incapable of [[Experience point#Level-based progression|levelling up]].<ref name=\"writer\" /> Killing no one unlocks one of four different endings.<ref name=\"unlock\" /> Reid can turn people into vampires,<ref name=\"if eaten\" /> and is only able to enter a house with an invitation.<ref name=\"lore\" /> Locals each have their different backgrounds, relationships, and daily routines. If killed, they impart their last thought to Reid.<ref name=\"impart\" /> The \"Mesmerise\" ability can control the behaviour of weaker targets, like coercing them into revealing information,<ref name=\"coercing\" /> or guiding them to less conspicuous areas so as to feed without resorting to combat.<ref name=\"mesmerise\" /> With crafted medicine, Reid can heal injured or sick victims, whom if eaten,<ref name=\"boss\" /><ref name=\"if eaten\" /> will yield more experience points in the process;<ref name=\"more\" /> the rate of their affliction can be viewed using vampire senses,<ref name=\"affliction\" /> which also detect blood.<ref name=\"w4yp01nt\" /> Each of the four districts has a score based on the average health of its citizens.<ref name=\"four\" /><ref name=\"districts\" /> Reid navigates London using a [[waypoint]],<ref name=\"w4yp01nt\" /> and collectible documents are scattered around the city.<ref name=\"Billcliffe-Jun2018\" />\n\n[[File:Vampyr gameplay.gif|right|thumb|250px|Reid engages in combat with his enemies, using supernatural abilities.]]\n\nReid can wield improvised [[melee weapon]]s, such as a saw, as well as [[ranged weapon]]s including the [[Webley Revolver]].<ref name=\"information\" /><ref name=\"webley\" /> Being able to use three-hit [[Combo (video gaming)|combos]], dodge rolls, and [[Parry (fencing)|parrying]],<ref name=\"Thirlwell-Feb2018\" /> he can fight against other vampires like him\u2014[[aristocrat]]s who go by the name of Ekon; sewer-dwelling vampires known as Skals; the Vulkod\u2014a stronger breed of vampire resembling [[werewolves]]; Nemrod\u2014vampires who hunt their own kind;<ref name=\"ekon\" /> and the Guard of Priwen\u2014a secret society of [[Vampire hunter|vampire slayers]].<ref name=\"turned to\" /> [[Boss (video gaming)|Boss]] fights are featured,<ref name=\"boss\" /> and in some cases mandatory.<ref name=\"Variety-May2018\" /> Reid is adaptable to other vampire features, like the claws of a Vulkod.<ref name=\"ekon\" /> Weapon improvement through crafting is made possible by looting items. While using vampiric powers in combat, the character's blood bar drains. This forces him to feed so he can immediately replenish his strength.<ref name=\"E\" /><ref name=\"w4yp01nt\" /> With the vitality attained from killing a human being, he can boil the blood of his enemies, cast blood spears,<ref name=\"viable\" /> throw mist [[bomb]]s, and turn invisible.<ref name=\"Thirlwell-Feb2018\" /> He uses his control of shadows to hide himself and strike at his opponents.<ref name=\"ekon\" /> He can use \"Spring\" to scale locations otherwise out of reach and charge more rapidly across gaps,<ref name=\"third person\" /><ref name=\"mesmerise\" /> which is also useful for avoiding combat altogether.<ref name=\"altogether\" />\n\n==Plot==\nDoctor Jonathan Reid, returning to London from the [[Great War]] in 1918, awakes in a [[mass grave]] as a vampire. Overwhelmed with bloodlust, he causes the death of his sister Mary, who was searching for his body nearby. Reid takes shelter from vampire hunters in an abandoned house and starts hearing the disembodied voice of his maker, a typical feature in the progeny of vampires. Realising London is profuse with corpses, he follows a blood trail to a bar. The bartender points Reid to William Bishop, a suspicious patron. Bishop is caught feeding on a man named Sean Hampton and is killed by the vampire Lady Ashbury. Doctor Edgar Swansea rescues Hampton and hires Reid to practice medicine at Pembroke Hospital.\n\nAfter the room of patient Harriet Jones is found covered in blood and Hampton disappears, Reid tracks him down for questioning. Hampton insists he did not murder Jones and directs him to an underground haven for corrupted vampires known as Skals, where it is revealed that Jones faked her death. Reid later discovers a corpse in the street bearing his mother's [[brooch]]. He pursues the perpetrator towards the cemetery in [[Whitechapel]] and finds his sister Mary with their mother Emelyne, realising Mary was turned into a vampire the night he fed on her. Mary is intent on killing him to rid herself of his voice, but dies trying. Reid vows to uncover what is behind the Skal epidemic, which he learns has been mistaken for the [[Spanish flu]].\n\nLady Ashbury invites Reid to the [[West End of London|West End]] on behalf of the Ascalon Club, a secret society of highborn vampires. By the order of its leader Lord Redgrave, Reid roots out the source of Skals in the district. Swansea is later kidnapped and, once located, admits to attempting to heal Jones with Lady Ashbury's blood, thereby creating the Skal epidemic; once Ashbury finds out, she flees in shame. It is made known that the entity Myrddin, claimant to the role of Jonathan's maker, sired him to defeat his mother [[Morrigan]], also known as the \"Red Queen\", after she possessed Jones to wreak havoc upon London. Reid defeats Morrigan in battle, resolving then to travel after Lady Ashbury to her family castle, where she hid with her maker [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]].\n\n==Development==\nDevelopment began with a team of sixty people, later expanded to around eighty, many of whom worked on [[Dontnod Entertainment]]'s previous project ''[[Life Is Strange]]''.<ref name=\"more\" /><ref name=\"eighty\" /><ref name=\"MCV-Nov2017\" /> For a short time, the developer considered setting the game in [[United States in the 1950s|1950s America]],<ref name=\"America\" /> but after narrative director St\u00e9phane Beauverger joined the project,<ref name=\"MCV-Nov2017\" /> it was discarded to inspire a more [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] mood with focus on the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, set in London. The paintings of [[Phil Hale]] influenced the art style, also for the purpose of atmosphere.<ref name=\"tentative 17\" /> Dontnod researched the setting by visiting London and taking photographs,<ref name=\"more\" /> but since the city had been largely rebuilt, history books and documentaries concerning [[Whitechapel]], the [[London Docks]], and the [[Isle of Dogs]] were also consulted.<ref name=\"viable\" /> The literary sources ''Liquid History: The Thames Through Time'' and ''The Book of Facial Expressions: Babies to Teens'' provided [[Geography|geographical]] and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] insight, respectively,<ref name=\"3dg3\" /> while the television series ''[[Casualty 1900s]]'' and ''[[The Knick]]'' were turned to for medical information.<ref name=\"turned to\" /> [[Anthony Howell (actor)|Anthony Howell]] was hired to voice Jonathan Reid.<ref name=\"VampyrGame-Jun2018\" /> The characters and dialogue were scripted by two French writers and translated into English by two native speakers. Dontnod decided on the British accent, though the marketing department wanted more.<ref name=\"Dealessandri-Jun2018\" /> The period was studied using both factual and fictional reference points{{efn|As such, the game world has been described as a [[uchronia]].<ref name=\"turned to\" />}} to create the visuals, realised with [[Photorealism|photorealistic]] lighting,<ref name=\"photorealistic\" /> and [[Image editing|post-processes]] running on the [[Unreal Engine#Unreal Engine 4|Unreal Engine 4]].<ref name=\"information\" /><ref name=\"tentative 17\" /> [[Motion capture]] was used to track character movement.<ref name=\"O'Connor-Feb2018\" /> In August 2016, the major obstacles in developing the [[Xbox One]] version had been overcome with the assurance that there would be no downgrades despite its hardware disadvantages.<ref name=\"hardware\" /> The game has one [[Saved game|save slot]], a decision Dontnod made for in-game choices to have \"real, meaningful impact\"; to avoid corrupted saves, they implemented [[backup]] systems.<ref name=\"Ashaari-May2018\" />\n\nAdhering to either Reid's [[Hippocratic Oath#\"First do no harm\"|Hippocratic Oath]] or vampiric nature intends to explore the dualism of his survival as both a doctor and vampire.<ref name=\"tentative 17\" /><ref name=\"oath\" /> [[Olivier Deriviere]] served as the composer throughout development,<ref name=\"Banas-May2018\" /> infusing the score with [[industrial music]] to portray the solitude and inner struggle of the main character. Eric-Maria Couturier played the [[cello]], whose sounds were intended to go from \"emotional\" to \"bestial\".<ref name=\"Prell-Jan2018\" /> The [[bass flute]], [[piano]], [[double bass]], and [[cimbalom]] (chosen for how it reflected that period in London) were also employed, each characterising an aspect of the story. Deriviere saw the [[choir]] as representing an oppressive influence on the main character, and thought its combination with industrial music was effective given the amount of [[Audio editing software|post-processing]].<ref name=\"Stevens-May2018\" /> The soundtrack was released on 3 May 2018 on [[Bandcamp]], and launched on all digital platforms the day the game came out.<ref name=\"Frometa-May2018\" /> ''Vampyr'' was [[released to manufacturing]] in May 2018.<ref name=\"Hart-May2018\" />\n\n==Release==\nAfter a technical issue delayed it from its original November 2017 launch date, ''Vampyr'' was rescheduled for Q1/Q2 2018.<ref name=\"Romano-2017\" /> The final episode of a [[making-of]] video series revealed that it would be released on 5 June (for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and Xbox One).<ref name=\"O'Connor-Feb2018\" /><ref name=\"Wood-Jan2018\" /> Those who pre-ordered the game gained access to bonus [[downloadable content]] called \"The Hunters Heirlooms\", which contained exclusive in-game cosmetics.<ref name=\"hunters heirlooms\" /><ref name=\"Vampyr-Game\" /> If pre-ordered through select retailers in [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], a [[phonograph record]] of the soundtrack was included.<ref name=\"DONTNOD_Ent-Apr2018\" />\n\nIn May 2018, Dontnod confirmed that ''Vampyr'' would not be using [[Denuvo Anti-Tamper]], a technology criticised for damaging [[computer performance]].<ref name=\"Luces-May2018\" /> A launch trailer came out the following month, leading up to the release.<ref name=\"Patino-Jun2018\" /> Two new difficulties, Story and Hard mode, launched on 26 September 2018.<ref name=\"Rutledge-Sep2018\" /> ''Vampyr'' was added to [[Xbox Game Pass]], a subscription-based service for Xbox One games, on 28 March 2019.<ref name=\"Phillips-Mar2019\" /> A [[Nintendo Switch]] version developed by [[Saber Interactive]] was released on 29 October 2019.<ref name=\"Bukacek-Sep2019\" /><ref name=\"Gamekult-Sep2019\" />\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = (PC) 72/100<ref name=\"MCPC\" /><br />(PS4) 70/100<ref name=\"MCPS4\" /><br />(XONE) 70/100<ref name=\"MCXONE\" /><br />(NS) 69/100<ref name=\"MCNS\" />\n| Destruct = 6/10<ref name=\"Destruct\" />\n| EGM = 8/10<ref name=\"EGM\" />\n| GameRev = {{Rating|2.5|5}}<ref name=\"GameRev\" />\n| GSpot = 7/10<ref name=\"GSpot\" />\n| GRadar = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"GRadar\" />\n| IGN = 7/10<ref name=\"IGN\" />\n| PCGUS = 68/100<ref name=\"PCGUS\" />\n| VG = 7/10<ref name=\"VG\" />\n}}\n''Vampyr'' received \"mixed or average reviews\", according to review aggregator [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"MCPC\" /><ref name=\"MCPS4\" /><ref name=\"MCXONE\" /> ''[[Destructoid]]''{{'}}s Kevin Mersereau enjoyed the dialogue conversations, atmosphere, and character development.<ref name=\"Destruct\" /> Emma Schaefer of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]'' declared Reid's dualism between doctor and vampire the title's greatest strength, while also praising the character development for imbuing \"even the lowest beggar\" with some importance.<ref name=\"EGM\" /> Matt Utley at ''[[Game Revolution]]'' enjoyed the atmosphere, each district's distinct look, and aspects of the combat.<ref name=\"GameRev\" /> Writing for ''[[GameSpot]]'', Justin Clark was impressed with the effect of decisions and how this tied into the core gameplay, calling it \"empowering\". He also commended the \"enthralling\" characterisations, \"exquisite\" setting, and \"captivating\" voice acting.<ref name=\"GSpot\" /> ''[[GamesRadar+]]''{{'}}s Leon Hurley, like Schaefer, found the mechanic of testing Reid's morality compelling, calling the characters well-realised and integral. Also approved of was the \"atmospheric victorian London setting\".<ref name=\"GRadar\" /> Brandin Tyrrel, writing for ''[[IGN]]'', termed ''Vampyr'' \"a fresh and genuine take\" on vampire mythology. He was generally satisfied with how choices turned out and said the recreation of London as a \"gloomy, somber city\" was bolstered by authentic characters, whose writing and performances he also enjoyed. Tyrrel welcomed the story and enjoyed the citizen mechanics,<ref name=\"IGN\" /> something Andy Kelly at ''[[PC Gamer]]'' also appreciated, hoping that more video games would follow suit. He called the dialogue-driven storytelling \"compelling\" and the setting \"atmospheric\".<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /> Alice Bell of ''VideoGamer.com'' wrote, \"''Vampyr'' serves delicious ladles of angst and drama with a hearty slice of excellent, morally grey choice system that will genuinely surprise you, all wrapped up in a wonderfully gloomy London\".<ref name=\"VG\" />\n\nConversely, Mersereau scolded the overall narrative for its \"threadbare\" contribution. He called the combat \"a low-grade ''[[The Witcher (video game)|Witcher]]'' knockoff\", complaining about its lack of precision and \"sloppy\" mechanics. Lengthy [[loading screen]]s and constant [[Hang (computing)|hangings]] were also cited as a source of annoyance.<ref name=\"Destruct\" /> Schaefer lambasted the animations for being \"a little wonky\" and the unpolished nature of the game.<ref name=\"EGM\" /> To Utley, ''Vampyr'' failed to impress, in particular its character development and impact of choice. He also had technical problems (low resolution, \"choppy\" performance, and lengthy loading times).<ref name=\"GameRev\" /> Already frustrated with the combat, Clark said frame rate drops and frequent loading screens worsened the experience. He found that the narrative became weaker in the final chapters.<ref name=\"GSpot\" /> Hurley viewed the combat as \"functional at best\"; \"solid if uninventive\", and chastised how small decisions led to big mistakes, which he felt forfeited responsibility for one's actions.<ref name=\"GRadar\" /> Tyrrel cited lip syncing as a primary concern of the animation, criticised the lack of variety in combat, and experienced the same technical difficulties as Mersereau, Utley, and Clark, albeit noting that they amounted to minor annoyances.<ref name=\"IGN\" /> Kelly disliked the \"dull, repetitive\" combat sequences and, despite noting a variety of fighting styles, saw this ultimately as a \"tiresome\" distraction.<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /> Agreeing with many others on the combat, Bell described it as continuously turning \"sour\".<ref name=\"VG\" />\n\n===Sales and accolades===\nFocus Home Interactive stated that ''Vampyr'' would be considered successful if it sold one million copies, although half would turn a profit.<ref name=\"Dealessandri-Nov2017\" /> It debuted in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France as the best-selling video game across all formats,<ref name=\"Handrahan-Jun2018\" /><ref name=\"Vincent-Jul2018\" /> reaching second place on the Italian chart (behind ''[[FIFA 18]]'').<ref name=\"Pugliese-Jun2018\" /> ''Vampyr'' sold 450,000 copies after one month of release,<ref name=\"Jones-Jul2018\" /> contributing to an increase of over twenty percent of its publisher's revenue for the first quarter of 2018.<ref name=\"Vincent-Jul2018\" /> That October, the publisher cited ''Vampyr'' as a key factor in its second quarter's [[\u20ac]]44.3 million revenue.<ref name=\"Wise-Oct2018\" /> By April 2019, ''Vampyr'' had sold one million copies; these sales contributed to a 22.1% rise in revenue for Dontnod, equivalent to a {{\u20ac|10.5&nbsp;million|link=yes}} increase from the previous [[fiscal year]].<ref name=\"Actusnews-Apr2019-A\" /><ref name=\"Actusnews-Apr2019-B\" />\n\nAt [[E3 2017]], ''Vampyr'' received one of [[GamesRadar+]]'s Best of E3 awards<ref name=\"e32017\" /> and was nominated for [[GamesBeat]]'s Unreal Underdog award<ref name=\"bestofu\" /> and [[Game Critics Awards]]' Best RPG award.<ref name=\"bestofgca\" /><ref name=\"gc4w\" /> It was later nominated for the Best Console Game, Best Screenplay, and Best Soundtrack awards at the 2018 Ping Awards,<ref name=\"PingAwards-Nov2018\" /> and for \"Best Role-Playing Game\" at the [[Fun & Serious Game Festival|Titanium Awards]],<ref name=\"TitaniumAwards-Dec2018\" /> and won the \"Game, Original Role Playing\" award at the [[National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers|NAVGTR]] Awards, whereas its other nominations were for the \"Original Dramatic Score, New IP\" and \"Use of Sound, New IP\" awards.<ref name=\"NAVGTR-Feb2019\" /><ref name=\"NAVGTR-Mar2019\" />\n\n==Television adaptation==\nIn August 2018, it was announced that the television production company [[Fox 21 Television Studios]] had [[optioned]] ''Vampyr'' as a series, with [[Wonderland Sound and Vision]] and DJ2 Entertainment also attached to the project.

A Misl could be composed of a few hundred to tens of thousands soldiers. Any soldier was free to join whichever Misl he wished, and was free to cancel his membership of the Misl to whom he belonged. He could, if he wanted, cancel his membership of his old Misl and join another. The Barons would allow their armies to combine or coordinate their defences together against a hostile force if ordered by the Misldar Supreme Commander. These orders were only issued in military matters affecting the whole [[Sikh]] community. These orders would normally be related to defense against external threats, such as Afghan military attacks. The profits of a fighting action were divided by the misls to individuals based on the service rendered after the conflict using the [[#Administration|sardari system]].\n\nThe '''Sikh Confederacy''' is a description of the [[political]] structure, of how all the Barons' Kingdoms interacted with each other [[politically]] together in [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Although misls varied in strength, the use of primarily [[light cavalry]] with a smaller amount [[heavy cavalry]] was uniform throughout all of the Sikh misls. Cavalrymen in a misl were required to supply their own horses and equipment.<ref name=\"Singh 1963 page=23\">{{Harvnb|Singh|1963|page=23}}</ref> A standard cavalryman was armed with a [[spear]], [[matchlock]], and [[scimitar]].<ref name=\"Francklin1805\">{{cite book|last=Francklin|first=William|title=Military memoirs of Mr. George Thomas; who, by extraordinary talents and enterprise, rose from an obscure situation to the rank of a general, in the service of the native powers in the North-West of India|url=https://archive.org/details/militarymemoirs01frangoog|accessdate=30 June 2010|year=1805|publisher=Reprinted for John Stockdale|page=[https://archive.org/details/militarymemoirs01frangoog/page/n110 107]}}</ref> How the armies of the Sikh misls received payment varied with the leadership of each misl.

The misls adapted their tactics to their strength in cavalry and weakness in artillery and avoided pitched battles. Misls organized their armies around bodies of horsemen and their units fought battles in a series of skirmishes, a tactic which gave them an advantage over fighting pitched battles. Bodies of cavalry would attack a position, retreat, reload their muskets, and return to attack it again. The tactics used by misl field armies include [[Flanking maneuver#Maneuvering|flanking]] an enemy, obstructing river passages, cutting off a unit from its supplies, intercepting messengers, attacking isolated units like foraging parties, employing [[hit-and-run tactics]], overrunning camps, and attacking [[baggage train]]s. To fight large armies the misl would completely evacuate the areas in front of the enemy's marching route but follow in the rear of the opposition and reconquer areas the enemy had just captured, threaten agents of the enemy with retribution, and sweep over the countryside in the wake of the enemy's withdrawal.\n\nThe ''Running Skirmish'' was a tactic unique to the Sikh cavalrymen which was notable for its effectiveness and the high degree of skill required to execute it. [[George Thomas (soldier)|George Thomas]] and George Forster, contemporary writers who witnessed it described its use separately in their accounts of the military of the Sikhs. George Forster noted:\n\n\"A party from forty to fifty, advance in a quick pace to a distance of carbine shot from the enemy and then, that the fire may be given with the greatest certainty, the horses are drawn up and their pieces discharged, when speedily, retiring about a 100 paces, they load and repeat the same mode of annoying the enemy. Their horses have been so expertly trained to a performance of this operation that on receiving a stroke of hand, they stop from a full canter.\"\n\n==Administration==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:NJSA.jpg|thumb|[[Jassa Singh Ahluwalia]], leader of the [[Ahluwalia Misl]]]] -->\n\n{{Quote|quote  = The remainder was separated into Puttees or parcels for each Surkunda, and these were again subdivided and parcelled out to inferior leaders, according to the number of horse they brought into the field. Each took his portion as a co-sharer, and held it in absolute independence.|source = ''Origin of the Sikh power in the Punjab'' (1834) p.&nbsp;33 \u2013 [[Henry Thoby Prinsep]]}}\n\nThe Sikh Misls had four different classes of administrative divisions. The patadari, misaldari, tabadari, and jagirdari were the different systems of [[land tenure]] used by the misls, and land granted by the misl left the responsibility of establishing law and order to the owner of the land. The land under the direct administration of the chief of the misl was known as the ''sardari'' and the tabadari and jagirdari systems used land directly given by the chief from the sardari. The patadari and misaldari systems formed the basis of a misl, while tabadari and jagirdari lands would only be created after large acquisitions of land. The type of system that was used in an area depended on the importance of the chief [[sardar]] of the area to the rest of the misl.\n\nThe ''Patadari system'' affected newly annexed territories and was the original method used by the misls in administrating land.<ref>{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=33}}</ref> The patadari system relied on the cooperation of surkundas, the rank of a leader of a small party of [[cavalrymen]]. The chief of the misl would take his/her portion and divide the other parcels among his [[Sardar]]s proportional to the number of [[cavalrymen]] they had contributed to the misl.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=34\">{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=34}}</ref> The Sardars would then divide their parcels among their Surkundas, and then the Surkundas subdivided the land they received among their individual cavalrymen. The Surkundas receiving parcels of land with settlements were required to fortify them{{#tag:ref|The owners of larger villages were required to erect [[stockade]]s and [[Ditch (fortification)|ditches]] while the owners of towns erected either [[keep]]s or [[fort]]s<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=34\"/>|group=note}} and establish fines and laws for their [[zamindar]]s and [[ryot]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=34\u201335}}</ref> Parcels of land in the patadari system could not be sold, but could be given to relatives in an [[inheritance]].<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=35\">{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=35}}</ref> The soldiers who received parcels from the Patadari system held their land in complete freedom.<ref name=\"Kakshi 2007 page=73\"/>\n\nThe ''Misaldari system'' applied to sardars with a small number of cavalrymen as well as independent bodies of cavalrymen who voluntarily attached themselves to a misl.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=35\"/> They kept the lands they held before joining the misl as an allotment for their cooperation with the misl. The leaders of these groups, called misaldars, could transfer their allegiance and land to another misl without punishment.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=35\"/>\n\nThe ''Tabadari system'' referred to land under the control of a misl's tabadars. Tabadars served a similar function to retainers in Europe. They were required to serve as cavalrymen to the misl and were subservient to the misl's leader. Although tabadars received their land as a reward, their ownership was subject entirely on the misl's leader.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=36\">{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=36}}</ref> The tabadari grants were only hereditary on the choice of the chief of the misl.\n\nThe ''Jagirdari system'' used the grant of [[jagir]]s by the chief of the misl. [[Jagir]]s were given by the chief of the misl to relations, dependents, and people who \"deserved well\".<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=36\"/> The owners of jagirs were subservient to the chief of the misl as their ownership was subject to his/her needs.

A Misl could be composed of a few hundred to tens of thousands soldiers. Any soldier was free to join whichever Misl he wished, and was free to cancel his membership of the Misl to whom he belonged. He could, if he wanted, cancel his membership of his old Misl and join another. The Barons would allow their armies to combine or coordinate their defences together against a hostile force if ordered by the Misldar Supreme Commander. These orders were only issued in military matters affecting the whole [[Sikh]] community. These orders would normally be related to defense against external threats, such as Afghan military attacks. The profits of a fighting action were divided by the misls to individuals based on the service rendered after the conflict using the [[#Administration|sardari system]].\n\nThe '''Sikh Confederacy''' is a description of the [[political]] structure, of how all the Barons' Kingdoms interacted with each other [[politically]] together in [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Although misls varied in strength, the use of primarily [[light cavalry]] with a smaller amount [[heavy cavalry]] was uniform throughout all of the Sikh misls. Cavalrymen in a misl were required to supply their own horses and equipment.<ref name=\"Singh 1963 page=23\">{{Harvnb|Singh|1963|page=23}}</ref> A standard cavalryman was armed with a [[spear]], [[matchlock]], and [[scimitar]].<ref name=\"Francklin1805\">{{cite book|last=Francklin|first=William|title=Military memoirs of Mr. George Thomas; who, by extraordinary talents and enterprise, rose from an obscure situation to the rank of a general, in the service of the native powers in the North-West of India|url=https://archive.org/details/militarymemoirs01frangoog|accessdate=30 June 2010|year=1805|publisher=Reprinted for John Stockdale|page=[https://archive.org/details/militarymemoirs01frangoog/page/n110 107]}}</ref> How the armies of the Sikh misls received payment varied with the leadership of each misl.

The misls adapted their tactics to their strength in cavalry and weakness in artillery and avoided pitched battles. Misls organized their armies around bodies of horsemen and their units fought battles in a series of skirmishes, a tactic which gave them an advantage over fighting pitched battles. Bodies of cavalry would attack a position, retreat, reload their muskets, and return to attack it again. The tactics used by misl field armies include [[Flanking maneuver#Maneuvering|flanking]] an enemy, obstructing river passages, cutting off a unit from its supplies, intercepting messengers, attacking isolated units like foraging parties, employing [[hit-and-run tactics]], overrunning camps, and attacking [[baggage train]]s. To fight large armies the misl would completely evacuate the areas in front of the enemy's marching route but follow in the rear of the opposition and reconquer areas the enemy had just captured, threaten agents of the enemy with retribution, and sweep over the countryside in the wake of the enemy's withdrawal.\n\nThe ''Running Skirmish'' was a tactic unique to the Sikh cavalrymen which was notable for its effectiveness and the high degree of skill required to execute it. [[George Thomas (soldier)|George Thomas]] and George Forster, contemporary writers who witnessed it described its use separately in their accounts of the military of the Sikhs. George Forster noted:\n\n\"A party from forty to fifty, advance in a quick pace to a distance of carbine shot from the enemy and then, that the fire may be given with the greatest certainty, the horses are drawn up and their pieces discharged, when speedily, retiring about a 100 paces, they load and repeat the same mode of annoying the enemy. Their horses have been so expertly trained to a performance of this operation that on receiving a stroke of hand, they stop from a full canter.\"\n\n==Administration==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:NJSA.jpg|thumb|[[Jassa Singh Ahluwalia]], leader of the [[Ahluwalia Misl]]]] -->\n\n{{Quote|quote  = The remainder was separated into Puttees or parcels for each Surkunda, and these were again subdivided and parcelled out to inferior leaders, according to the number of horse they brought into the field.

The patadari, misaldari, tabadari, and jagirdari were the different systems of [[land tenure]] used by the misls, and land granted by the misl left the responsibility of establishing law and order to the owner of the land. The land under the direct administration of the chief of the misl was known as the ''sardari'' and the tabadari and jagirdari systems used land directly given by the chief from the sardari. The patadari and misaldari systems formed the basis of a misl, while tabadari and jagirdari lands would only be created after large acquisitions of land. The type of system that was used in an area depended on the importance of the chief [[sardar]] of the area to the rest of the misl.\n\nThe ''Patadari system'' affected newly annexed territories and was the original method used by the misls in administrating land.<ref>{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=33}}</ref> The patadari system relied on the cooperation of surkundas, the rank of a leader of a small party of [[cavalrymen]]. The chief of the misl would take his/her portion and divide the other parcels among his [[Sardar]]s proportional to the number of [[cavalrymen]] they had contributed to the misl.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=34\">{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=34}}</ref> The Sardars would then divide their parcels among their Surkundas, and then the Surkundas subdivided the land they received among their individual cavalrymen. The Surkundas receiving parcels of land with settlements were required to fortify them{{#tag:ref|The owners of larger villages were required to erect [[stockade]]s and [[Ditch (fortification)|ditches]] while the owners of towns erected either [[keep]]s or [[fort]]s<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=34\"/>|group=note}} and establish fines and laws for their [[zamindar]]s and [[ryot]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=34\u201335}}</ref> Parcels of land in the patadari system could not be sold, but could be given to relatives in an [[inheritance]].<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=35\">{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=35}}</ref> The soldiers who received parcels from the Patadari system held their land in complete freedom.<ref name=\"Kakshi 2007 page=73\"/>\n\nThe ''Misaldari system'' applied to sardars with a small number of cavalrymen as well as independent bodies of cavalrymen who voluntarily attached themselves to a misl.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=35\"/> They kept the lands they held before joining the misl as an allotment for their cooperation with the misl. The leaders of these groups, called misaldars, could transfer their allegiance and land to another misl without punishment.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=35\"/>\n\nThe ''Tabadari system'' referred to land under the control of a misl's tabadars. Tabadars served a similar function to retainers in Europe. They were required to serve as cavalrymen to the misl and were subservient to the misl's leader. Although tabadars received their land as a reward, their ownership was subject entirely on the misl's leader.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=36\">{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=36}}</ref> The tabadari grants were only hereditary on the choice of the chief of the misl.\n\nThe ''Jagirdari system'' used the grant of [[jagir]]s by the chief of the misl. [[Jagir]]s were given by the chief of the misl to relations, dependents, and people who \"deserved well\".<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=36\"/> The owners of jagirs were subservient to the chief of the misl as their ownership was subject to his/her needs. Like the Tabadars, jagirdars were subject to personal service when the chief of the misl requested.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=36\"/> However, because jagirs entailed more land and profit, they were required to use the money generated by their jagirs to equip and mount a quota of [[cavalrymen]] depending on the size of their jagir.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=36\"/> Jagirdari grants were hereditary in practice but a misl's chief could revoke the rights of the heir. Upon the death of the owner of a tabadari or jagadari grant, the land would revert to direct control of the chief (sardari).\n\n==Territory==\n[[File:PunjabDoabs.png|thumb|right|200px|A map of the [[Punjab region]] showing the different doabs]]\nThe two main divisions in territory between the misls were between those who were in the [[Malwa]] region and those who were in the [[Majha]] region.

Beacons operate in the lower part of the band, traditionally in the range 50.000&nbsp;MHz to 50.080&nbsp;MHz.\n\nThe IARU is encouraging individual beacons to move to 50.4&nbsp;MHz to 50.5&nbsp;MHz to assist with the establishment of the [[#Synchronized Beacon Project|Synchronized Beacon Project]].<ref name=\"IARU-R2-bandplan\"/><ref name=\"IARU-R1-bandplan\"/>  In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) only permits unattended 6-meter beacon stations to operate between 50.060&nbsp; and 50.080&nbsp;MHz.<ref name=\"T47CFR97.203d\">{{CodeFedReg|47|97|203|(d)}}</ref>\n\n==4-meter beacons==\nSeveral countries in [[International Telecommunication Union region|ITU Region 1]] have access to frequencies in the 70&nbsp;MHz region, called the [[4-meter band]].  The band shares many propagation characteristics with 6 meters.  The preferred location for beacons is 70.000\u201370.090&nbsp;MHz;<ref name=\"IARU-R1-bandplan\"/> however, in countries where this segment is not allocated to Amateur Radio, beacons may operate elsewhere in the band.\n\n==VHF/UHF beacons==\nBeacons on 144&nbsp;MHz and higher frequencies are mainly used to identify [[Radio propagation#Tropospheric modes|tropospheric radio propagation]] openings. It is not uncommon for VHF and UHF beacons to use directional antennas.  Frequencies set aside for beacons on VHF and UHF bands vary widely in different ITU regions and countries.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Band\n! colspan=\"3\" | Beacon Sub-band (MHz)\n|-\n!

Cabagan's top schools are Cabagan Science Elementary School; Saint Ferdinand College - Cabagan Campus; Isabela State University; and Delfin Albano High School (Main Campus). The Malasi Lake is a sanctuary for migratory birds located in barangay San Antonio and has been hailed by the DENR. The biggest gymnasium in Isabela and in the whole Region 2 is located in this town and the century-old well that was built by the Spaniards, located at St. Ferdinand College, Cabagan Campus. The carousel in Cabagan Square Park has been dubbed by the townspeople as the largest in the Philippines.\n\n==Barangays==\n\nCabagan is politically subdivided into 26 [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|area}}\n\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Aggub\n* Anao\n* Angancasilian\n* Balasig\n* Cansan\n* Casibarag Norte\n* Casibarag Sur\n* Catabayungan\n* Cubag\n* Garita\n* Luquilu\n* Mabangug\n* Magassi\n* Ngarag\n* Pilig Abajo\n* Pilig Alto\n* Centro ([[Poblacion]])\n* San Bernardo\n* San Juan\n* Saui\n* Tallag\n* Ugad\n* Union\n* Masipi East\n* Masipi West\n* San Antonio\n}}\n\n==History==\nEtymologically, the name Cabagan may have originated from the native word ''bag'' or ''bajaque'', not because \"G-strings\" were used here or made in Cabagan, but most probably because there were stores in the village, Cabagan could have also been derived from the word ''cabbagang'', meaning \"pilgrim\" or stranger. Based on the fact that Cabagan at the time, was in constant contact with members of the \"pagan tribes\" from Diffun, namely southern [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]] as well as with the \"Kalingas\", of the neighboring Cordillera mountains.\n\n===Various Cabagan===\nThe Cabagan of old, that existed from 1646 to 1877 was simply called, \"Cabagan\".\nIn 1877, the Spaniards decided to transfer present-day Cabagan to a new site, abandoning the old Cabagan.\nIn 1888, the Spaniards resurrected the abandoned Cabagan, into a new town.  With this development, there were now two Cabagans.\nThe Spaniards rectified the predicament by naming the first Cabagan as ''Cabagan Viejo'', and the second Cabagan as ''Cabagan Nuevo'' or the new Cabagan.\nApparently, the name was not to the liking of the new rulers, the Americans.  When the Americans came to rule the Philippines after the Spaniards, they renamed Cabagan Nuevo as simply \"Cabagan\", and the old namesake, as the town of San Pablo.\n\n===Foundation===\nThe old Cabagan, Cabagan Viejo which is now called \"San Pablo\", was the key town in the colonization of the Irrayas and to some extent [[Diffun, Quirino|Diffun]], i.e., southern Isabela. The Irraya rebelled and the only ones that the Spaniards could claim, were some three hundred families who agreed to establish the village of Maquilla, near [[Tuguegarao|Tuguegarao City]]. Cabagan became a charter town in November 30, 1646 and ecclesiastically in May 15, 1647 with [[Saint Paul the Apostle]] as the patron saint.\n\n===New Cabagan (Cabagan Nuevo)===\nThe new Cabagan came to exist, because the Spanish government decreed that in January 25, 1877, the old Cabagan or [[San Pablo, Isabela|San Pablo]] of today, be transferred from its old site, to the one that is now occupying.  The brainchild of the transfer of Cabagan, was parish priest Pedro Ricart, who then made representations with the Spanish government, for the transfer.  Father Jose Burgues ''History of Cagayan Valley'' gave the unhealthiness of the old site, the reason for the transfer.  Others had stated though, that Cabagan was transferred because progress appeared to be bypassing the old Cabagan, in favor of the villages to the south, near Cabagan's present site. The new site was the area between the villages of Ugad and Luquilu, villages that exists up to this day.  The site is not far from the old, with the church of the new Cabagan just some three kilometers or so, south from that of the old.\nThe transfer was not without friction though.  A number of Cabagan's inhabitants opposed the transfer.  But the missionary's will had prevailed.  In contempt, as it were of the natives' opposition, the missionary uprooted the Church of the old Cabagan and brought the images and other vestments, to the new Cabagan.\nWhen the Spaniards established a new town, they also endeavored to build a massive church and convent made of stone, brick and mortar.  From 1877, when the new Cabagan was established, and culminating with the [[Philippine Revolution]] that deposed the ruling Spaniards 19 years later (1896), the then governing Spaniards were still not able to complete all constructions needed, for the new Cabagan.\nCabagan is a known meeting place among revolutionaries during the Spanish occupation.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census |align=none\n| cols = 2\n| title = Population census of Cabagan\n| 1903 = 5289\n| 1918 = 13112\n| 1939 = 18795\n| 1948 = 21651\n| 1960 = 17924\n| 1970 = 23370\n| 1975 = 24987\n| 1980 = 28908\n| 1990 = 34999\n| 1995 = 35054\n| 2000 = 41536\n| 2007 = 43562\n| 2010 = 45732\n| 2015 = 50174\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Cabagan, Isabela, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n===Language===\n\nCabagan, as part of the Irraya region and its language, was Irraya.  The Spaniards however, made the [[Ibanag language|Ibanag]] \"The Official Language of the Valley\", and had exerted all efforts that everyone speak the dialect.  Since then, the Irraya tongue gradually disappeared from the Cabagan psyche.\n\nWhen some people utter Irraya before, they were discouraged or forbidden to speak, because that was the language of the \"pagans\" at that time, the [[Kalinga people|Kalingas]].  Whenever the townsfolk enter the poblacion, none would speak of Irraya, for they would be considered despicably as, a \"Kalinga\" or as \"ignorant persons\", living in the mountains.\n\nToday, no one speaks Irraya. There are however, a few barrios in Cabagan today, like San Bernardo and Tallag, wherein the Ibanag dialect gets interspersed with Irraya.  However, some older generation townsfolk, could also remember sentences in Irraya.\n\nIlocano is also spoken in parts of Cabagan because of migration of poor Ilocanos from other parts of Luzon to seek opportunities.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box|location = Cabagan, Isabela\n|width=auto\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan high C = 29\n| Feb high C = 30\n| Mar high C = 32\n| Apr high C = 35\n| May high C = 35\n| Jun high C = 35\n| Jul high C = 34\n| Aug high C = 33\n| Sep high C = 32\n| Oct high C = 31\n| Nov high C = 30\n| Dec high C = 28\n| Jan low C = 19\n| Feb low C = 20\n| Mar low C = 21\n| Apr low C = 23\n| May low C = 23\n| Jun low C = 24\n| Jul low C = 23\n| Aug low C = 23\n| Sep low C = 23\n| Oct low C = 22\n| Nov low C = 21\n| Dec low C = 20\n| Jan precipitation mm = 31.2 \n| Jan rain days = 10\n| Feb precipitation mm = 23 \n| Feb rain days = 6\n| Mar precipitation mm = 27.7 \n| Mar rain days = 5\n| Apr precipitation mm = 28.1 \n| Apr rain days = 5\n| May precipitation mm = 113.5\n| May rain days = 13\n| Jun precipitation mm = 141.4 \n| Jun rain days = 12\n| Jul precipitation mm = 176.4\n| Jul rain days = 15\n| Aug precipitation mm = 236.6 \n| Aug rain days = 15\n| Sep precipitation mm = 224.9 \n| Sep rain days = 15\n| Oct precipitation mm = 247.7 \n| Oct rain days = 17\n| Nov precipitation mm = 222.9 \n| Nov rain days = 16\n| Dec precipitation mm = 178 \n| Dec rain days = 15\n|source 1 = World Weather Online<ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = http://www.worldweatheronline.com/Cabagan-weather-averages/Isabela/PH.aspx\n| title = Cabagan, Isabela: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = World Weather Online\n| accessdate = 31 October 2015}}</ref>\n| date=October 2015}}\n\n==Attractions==\n* Cabagan is famous for its eponymously named 'Pansi Cabagan' a local dish which was introduced by a Chinese trader in 1887 and has gained popularity in different parts of Luzon.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pancit Cabagan: Recipe and Origin |url=https://www.atbp.ph/2016/05/17/pancit-cabagan-recipe-origin/|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref> There are several popular restaurants (locally called 'Panciterias') serving this dish along the main road/highway in Barangay Centro, Anao, Ugad and Cubag which include Felicitas Panciteria, Aling Kikay, Loling's Panciteria, Eddie's Restaurant, Josie's Panciteria, KJM, KCJM, Mariloi's Panciteria, Pin-tag Bistro Cafe and Zein's Panciteria.\n* Malasi Tree Park and Wildlife Sanctuary, a bird sanctuary located in Barangay San Antonio, declared by DENR as critical habitat for Philippine ducks and migratory and endemic species of birds are spotted regularly <ref>{{cite news|title=Birdwatch.pH: Malassi Lakes Trip Report |url=http://www.birdwatch.ph/html/visitingbirders/birders20040207.html|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Amazing Malasi Lakes |url=http://www.pbase.com/liquidstone/malasi012007|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref> \n* Cabagan Square Park in Barangay Centro, with its Carousel which is the largest in the Philippines <ref>{{cite news|title=Historical Landmarks, Places of Interest, and Things To Do in the Philippines|url=http://www.aroundphilippines.com/p/historical-landmarks-in-philippines.html|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref>\n* Tulap Falls, a recently discovered waterfalls in Barangay Masipi East <ref>{{cite news|title=Tulap Falls -

Based on the fact that Cabagan at the time, was in constant contact with members of the \"pagan tribes\" from Diffun, namely southern [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]] as well as with the \"Kalingas\", of the neighboring Cordillera mountains.\n\n===Various Cabagan===\nThe Cabagan of old, that existed from 1646 to 1877 was simply called, \"Cabagan\".\nIn 1877, the Spaniards decided to transfer present-day Cabagan to a new site, abandoning the old Cabagan.\nIn 1888, the Spaniards resurrected the abandoned Cabagan, into a new town.  With this development, there were now two Cabagans.\nThe Spaniards rectified the predicament by naming the first Cabagan as ''Cabagan Viejo'', and the second Cabagan as ''Cabagan Nuevo'' or the new Cabagan.\nApparently, the name was not to the liking of the new rulers, the Americans.  When the Americans came to rule the Philippines after the Spaniards, they renamed Cabagan Nuevo as simply \"Cabagan\", and the old namesake, as the town of San Pablo.\n\n===Foundation===\nThe old Cabagan, Cabagan Viejo which is now called \"San Pablo\", was the key town in the colonization of the Irrayas and to some extent [[Diffun, Quirino|Diffun]], i.e., southern Isabela. The Irraya rebelled and the only ones that the Spaniards could claim, were some three hundred families who agreed to establish the village of Maquilla, near [[Tuguegarao|Tuguegarao City]]. Cabagan became a charter town in November 30, 1646 and ecclesiastically in May 15, 1647 with [[Saint Paul the Apostle]] as the patron saint.\n\n===New Cabagan (Cabagan Nuevo)===\nThe new Cabagan came to exist, because the Spanish government decreed that in January 25, 1877, the old Cabagan or [[San Pablo, Isabela|San Pablo]] of today, be transferred from its old site, to the one that is now occupying.  The brainchild of the transfer of Cabagan, was parish priest Pedro Ricart, who then made representations with the Spanish government, for the transfer.  Father Jose Burgues ''History of Cagayan Valley'' gave the unhealthiness of the old site, the reason for the transfer.  Others had stated though, that Cabagan was transferred because progress appeared to be bypassing the old Cabagan, in favor of the villages to the south, near Cabagan's present site. The new site was the area between the villages of Ugad and Luquilu, villages that exists up to this day.  The site is not far from the old, with the church of the new Cabagan just some three kilometers or so, south from that of the old.\nThe transfer was not without friction though.  A number of Cabagan's inhabitants opposed the transfer.  But the missionary's will had prevailed.  In contempt, as it were of the natives' opposition, the missionary uprooted the Church of the old Cabagan and brought the images and other vestments, to the new Cabagan.\nWhen the Spaniards established a new town, they also endeavored to build a massive church and convent made of stone, brick and mortar.  From 1877, when the new Cabagan was established, and culminating with the [[Philippine Revolution]] that deposed the ruling Spaniards 19 years later (1896), the then governing Spaniards were still not able to complete all constructions needed, for the new Cabagan.\nCabagan is a known meeting place among revolutionaries during the Spanish occupation.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census |align=none\n| cols = 2\n| title = Population census of Cabagan\n| 1903 = 5289\n| 1918 = 13112\n| 1939 = 18795\n| 1948 = 21651\n| 1960 = 17924\n| 1970 = 23370\n| 1975 = 24987\n| 1980 = 28908\n| 1990 = 34999\n| 1995 = 35054\n| 2000 = 41536\n| 2007 = 43562\n| 2010 = 45732\n| 2015 = 50174\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Cabagan, Isabela, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n===Language===\n\nCabagan, as part of the Irraya region and its language, was Irraya.  The Spaniards however, made the [[Ibanag language|Ibanag]] \"The Official Language of the Valley\", and had exerted all efforts that everyone speak the dialect.  Since then, the Irraya tongue gradually disappeared from the Cabagan psyche.\n\nWhen some people utter Irraya before, they were discouraged or forbidden to speak, because that was the language of the \"pagans\" at that time, the [[Kalinga people|Kalingas]].  Whenever the townsfolk enter the poblacion, none would speak of Irraya, for they would be considered despicably as, a \"Kalinga\" or as \"ignorant persons\", living in the mountains.\n\nToday, no one speaks Irraya. There are however, a few barrios in Cabagan today, like San Bernardo and Tallag, wherein the Ibanag dialect gets interspersed with Irraya.  However, some older generation townsfolk, could also remember sentences in Irraya.\n\nIlocano is also spoken in parts of Cabagan because of migration of poor Ilocanos from other parts of Luzon to seek opportunities.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box|location = Cabagan, Isabela\n|width=auto\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan high C = 29\n| Feb high C = 30\n| Mar high C = 32\n| Apr high C = 35\n| May high C = 35\n| Jun high C = 35\n| Jul high C = 34\n| Aug high C = 33\n| Sep high C = 32\n| Oct high C = 31\n| Nov high C = 30\n| Dec high C = 28\n| Jan low C = 19\n| Feb low C = 20\n| Mar low C = 21\n| Apr low C = 23\n| May low C = 23\n| Jun low C = 24\n| Jul low C = 23\n| Aug low C = 23\n| Sep low C = 23\n| Oct low C = 22\n| Nov low C = 21\n| Dec low C = 20\n| Jan precipitation mm = 31.2 \n| Jan rain days = 10\n| Feb precipitation mm = 23 \n| Feb rain days = 6\n| Mar precipitation mm = 27.7 \n| Mar rain days = 5\n| Apr precipitation mm = 28.1 \n| Apr rain days = 5\n| May precipitation mm = 113.5\n| May rain days = 13\n| Jun precipitation mm = 141.4 \n| Jun rain days = 12\n| Jul precipitation mm = 176.4\n| Jul rain days = 15\n| Aug precipitation mm = 236.6 \n| Aug rain days = 15\n| Sep precipitation mm = 224.9 \n| Sep rain days = 15\n| Oct precipitation mm = 247.7 \n| Oct rain days = 17\n| Nov precipitation mm = 222.9 \n| Nov rain days = 16\n| Dec precipitation mm = 178 \n| Dec rain days = 15\n|source 1 = World Weather Online<ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = http://www.worldweatheronline.com/Cabagan-weather-averages/Isabela/PH.aspx\n| title = Cabagan, Isabela: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = World Weather Online\n| accessdate = 31 October 2015}}</ref>\n| date=October 2015}} \n\n==Attractions==\n* Cabagan is famous for its eponymously named 'Pansi Cabagan' a local dish which was introduced by a Chinese trader in 1887 and has gained popularity in different parts of Luzon.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pancit Cabagan: Recipe and Origin |url=https://www.atbp.ph/2016/05/17/pancit-cabagan-recipe-origin/|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref> There are several popular restaurants (locally called 'Panciterias') serving this dish along the main road/highway in Barangay Centro, Anao, Ugad and Cubag which include Felicitas Panciteria, Aling Kikay, Loling's Panciteria, Eddie's Restaurant, Josie's Panciteria, KJM, KCJM, Mariloi's Panciteria, Pin-tag Bistro Cafe and Zein's Panciteria.\n* Malasi Tree Park and Wildlife Sanctuary, a bird sanctuary located in Barangay San Antonio, declared by DENR as critical habitat for Philippine ducks and migratory and endemic species of birds are spotted regularly <ref>{{cite news|title=Birdwatch.pH: Malassi Lakes Trip Report |url=http://www.birdwatch.ph/html/visitingbirders/birders20040207.html|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Amazing Malasi Lakes |url=http://www.pbase.com/liquidstone/malasi012007|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref> \n* Cabagan Square Park in Barangay Centro, with its Carousel which is the largest in the Philippines <ref>{{cite news|title=Historical Landmarks, Places of Interest, and Things To Do in the Philippines|url=http://www.aroundphilippines.com/p/historical-landmarks-in-philippines.html|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref>\n* Tulap Falls, a recently discovered waterfalls in Barangay Masipi East <ref>{{cite news|title=Tulap Falls -
