In 2005, the school stated that 1,785 students were members of a fraternity, sorority, or [[coeducation]]al Greek house, comprising about 43 percent of all students, or about 60 percent of the eligible student body.<ref name=\"hughes\">Hughes, C.J. (2006) \"Bye Bye SLI.\" ''Dartmouth Alumni Magazine''.  Vol. 98, No. 4, March/April, 2006, p.18.</ref>  Greek organizations at Dartmouth provide both social and residential opportunities for students, and are the only single-sex residential option on [[campus]].  Greek organizations at Dartmouth do not provide dining options, as regular meals service has been banned in Greek houses since 1909.\n\nSocial fraternities at Dartmouth College grew out of a tradition of student [[College literary societies (American)|literary societies]] that began in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.  The first social fraternities were founded in 1842 and rapidly expanded to include the active participation of over half of the student body.  Fraternities at Dartmouth built dedicated [[Fraternity and sorority houses|residence and meeting halls]] in the early 1900s and in the 1920s, and then struggled to survive the lean years of the 1930s.  Dartmouth College was among the first institutions of higher education to [[Desegregation|desegregate]] fraternity houses in the 1950s, and was involved in the movement to create coeducational Greek houses in the 1970s.

The first such society at Dartmouth, the Social Friends, was formed in 1783.  A rival organization, called the United Fraternity, was founded in 1786.  A chapter of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] was established at Dartmouth in 1787, and counted among its members [[Daniel Webster]], class of 1801.<ref name=\"webster\">{{cite web | last = Kartalopoulos | first = William B. | year = 1997 | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dwebster/1801/pbk.html | title = Daniel Webster and the Phi Beta Kappa | publisher = Dartmouth College Archives | accessdate = 2008-01-27 }}</ref>  These organizations were, in large part, the only social life available to students at the college.  The organizations hosted debates on a variety of topics not encountered in the [[curriculum]] of the day, and amassed large [[library|libraries]] of titles not found in the official College library.  Both the Social Friends and the United Fraternity created libraries in Dartmouth Hall, and met in a room called Society Hall inside Dartmouth Hall.  In 1815, the college decided to intervene in the hotly contested [[recruitment]] battle between the Social Friends and the United Fraternity by restricting each society to recruit only from separate halves of the new student class.  In 1825, the college began simply assigning new students to one society or the other.  Interest in the literary societies declined in the 1830s and 1840s.  The College library and instructional curriculum had expanded to include much of what the literary societies had supported, and new Greek letter societies began to appear on campus.<ref name=\"meacham\">{{cite web | last = Meacham | first = Scott | year = 1999 | title = Halls, Tombs and Houses: Student Society Architecture at Dartmouth | url = http://www.dartmo.com/halls/ | publisher = Dartmo.: The Buildings of Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2008-01-27 }}</ref>\n[[File:Dartmouth College Greek organizations - Kappa Kappa Kappa, early 1900s.jpg|thumb|left|The second physical plant of Kappa Kappa Kappa, located at 22 North College Street and occupied by the fraternity from 1894 to 1924.

One of the new societies called itself Omega Phi and on May 10, 1842, obtained a charter as the Zeta chapter of [[#Psi Upsilon (\u03a8\u03a5)|Psi Upsilon]].  The other faction to split from the United Fraternity organized itself on July 13, 1842, as [[#Kappa Kappa Kappa (\u039a\u039a\u039a)|Kappa Kappa Kappa]], a local fraternity. More Greek organizations were founded, and by 1855, 64% of students, mostly upperclassmen, were members of the Greek letter societies on campus.<ref name=\"meacham\"/>  Initially, the original Greek letter societies would not extend invitations of membership to first year students.  Two separate Greek letter organizations were created exclusively for [[first year|freshmen]]: Kappa Sigma Epsilon and Delta Kappa.  These societies would dissolve in 1883, when the fraternities of the upper classes began to [[Fraternities and sororities#Joining|pledge]] freshmen.<ref name=\"trustees\">{{cite book | last = Hill | first = Ralph Nading, Ed. | year = 1964 | title = The College on the Hill: A Dartmouth Chronicle | publisher = Dartmouth Publications | location = Hanover, New Hampshire | page = 234 }}</ref> A chapter of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] survived at Dartmouth, but by the 1830s had established its role as a strictly literary society by dropping requirements of secrecy for membership and activities.<ref name=\"phibetakappa\">{{cite web|work=The Phi Beta Kappa Society |year=2007 |url=http://staging.pbk.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=History&Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&ContentID=2345 |title=A Brief History of Phi Beta Kappa |accessdate=2008-01-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016233721/http://staging.pbk.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=History&Template=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&ContentID=2345 |archivedate=October 16, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  The new, social Greek organizations distinguished themselves from Phi Beta Kappa and the previous literary societies in several ways.  The new fraternities were self-selective and exclusive.  Each organization developed its own [[Fraternities and sororities#Rituals and symbols|secret rituals]] and procedures.  Most of the societies began to invest in creating their own meeting halls, either upstairs rooms in buildings on Main Street, or free-standing structures near campus.  There were 11 active Greek organizations at Dartmouth College in 1900.{{ref|a|[a]}}\n\n=== Expansion of the fraternity system ===\n[[File:Beta Theta Pi Dartmouth.jpg|right|thumb|Dartmouth Beta House, circa 1920, would later become home to the Tucker Foundation.]]\nThe fortunes of the fraternity system at Dartmouth followed a boom and bust pattern in the early twentieth century. Several organizations purchased frame houses or built their own between 1898 and 1907, including [[#Beta Alpha Omega (\u0392\u0391\u03a9)|Beta Theta Pi]], [[#Kappa Kappa Kappa (\u039a\u039a\u039a)|Kappa Kappa Kappa]], [[#Phi Delta Alpha (\u03a6\u0394\u0391)|Phi Delta Alpha]], and [[#Psi Upsilon (\u03a8\u03a5)|Psi Upsilon]].  The economic expansion of the 1920s created a boom in the fortunes of the fraternities, allowing many to build new brick residences near campus, including [[#Zeta Psi (\u0396\u03a8)|Zeta Psi]], [[#Kappa Kappa Kappa (\u039a\u039a\u039a)|Kappa Kappa Kappa]], [[#Phi Tau (\u03a6\u03a4)|Phi Sigma Kappa]], [[#Sigma Nu (\u03a3\u039d)|Sigma Nu]], [[#Sigma Alpha Epsilon (\u03a3\u0391\u0395)|Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[#Chi Heorot (\u03a7H)|Chi Phi]], [[#Theta Delta Chi (\u0398\u0394\u03a7)|Theta Delta Chi]], [[#Phi Gamma Delta (\u03a6\u0393\u0394)|Phi Gamma Delta]], [[#The Tabard (\u03a3\u0395\u03a7)|Sigma Chi]], [[#Gamma Delta Chi (\u0393\u0394\u03a7)|Gamma Delta Chi]], and [[#Bones Gate (BG)|Delta Tau Delta]]. It was during this period that Webster Avenue developed as \"fraternity row\".<ref name=\"meacham\"/>  The new residences were built without significant dining facilities, as the Trustees of the college had banned fraternities from serving regular meals in their chapter houses and had limited the number of resident brothers by the fall semester of 1909.<ref name=\"levermore\">{{cite news | last = Levermore | first = Charles | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/09/04/101895763.pdf | title = Forms of Associations Among College Students; Class Room as a Formative Influence Less Potent Than the Fraternity or Club -- Why Educators Antagonize the College Secret Society | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1909-09-04 | accessdate = 2008-01-27 | format=PDF}}</ref>  College administrators also challenged the fraternities to become more engaged in College life and less focused on their fraternity life during this time.

The decade of the 1930s saw almost no building projects at all in the fraternity system, and many houses could no longer afford regular maintenance.  One of the great tragedies at Dartmouth College occurred on a winter night in 1934, when nine members of [[#Alpha Theta (\u0391\u0398)|Theta Chi]] died from [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning after a metal chimney on a dilapidated coal furnace in the basement of the chapter house broke in the night.<ref name=\"time1934\">{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747133,00.html | title = Dartmouth's Saddest | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] | date = 1934-03-04 | accessdate = 2008-01-27 }}</ref>  In 1935, Dartmouth historian and professor [[Leon Burr Richardson]] asserted in a survey that, in light of the national suffering, the fraternity chapters should ask themselves if they had \"any excuse for existence.\"<ref name=\"trustees\"/>  Four fraternities dissolved during the Great Depression ([[#Alpha Sigma Phi (\u0391\u03a3\u03a6)|Alpha Sigma Phi]], [[#Alpha Tau Omega (\u0391\u03a4\u03a9)|Alpha Tau Omega]], [[#Lambda Chi Alpha (\u039b\u03a7\u0391)|Lambda Chi Alpha]], and [[#Sigma Alpha Mu (\u03a3\u0391\u039c)|Sigma Alpha Mu]]), and two ([[#Gamma Delta Chi (\u0393\u0394\u03a7)|Phi Kappa Sigma]] and [[#Gamma Delta Chi (\u0393\u0394\u03a7)|Alpha Chi Rho]]) merged to pool scarce resources in order to survive.  All of the surviving fraternities closed for the duration of [[World War II]], as the campus was largely (although not exclusively) used to educate, train, and house [[United States Navy|Navy]] sailors and [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]].<ref name=\"bf\">{{cite news | author = B.F. | title = Fraternities in Wartime Eclipse | work = The New York Times | date = 1944-01-09 | pages = E9 }}</ref><ref name=\"unattributed_1946\">{{cite news | title = Fraternities To Resume; Twenty-two at Dartmouth Will Open Their Houses Today | work = The New York Times | date = 1946-03-01 | pages = 2 }}</ref>\n\nThe fraternities of Dartmouth College were directly involved in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s.  In 1952, the Dartmouth chapter of Theta Chi was derecognized by its national over a dispute regarding minority membership.  The Dartmouth chapter reorganized as a local fraternity named [[#Alpha Theta (\u0391\u0398)|Alpha Theta]].  A campus-wide referendum held in 1954 on the issue of desegregation of fraternities resulted in a majority in favor of requiring fraternities on campus to eliminate [[racial discrimination|racially discriminatory]] membership policies by the year 1960, and to secede from national groups that retained such policies in their charters.  This became a binding obligation imposed on the fraternities by the college administration, and several fraternities at Dartmouth dissociated from their national organizations, including the chapters of [[#Phi Tau (\u03a6\u03a4)|Phi Sigma Kappa]] (1956),<ref name=\"scobie\">{{cite book | last = Richard | year = 1956 | url = http://libcat.dartmouth.edu/search/ascobie/ascobie/13%2C18%2C32%2CB/frameset&FF=ascobie+richard&1%2C1%2C | title = A Fraternal Revolution: The Birth of Phi Tau Fraternity, As Told by One of the Principles: Richard Scobie | location = Hanover, New Hampshire }}</ref> [[#Bones Gate (BG)|Delta Tau Delta]] (1960), [[#Phi Delta Alpha (\u03a6\u0394\u0391)|Phi Delta Theta]] (1960), [[#The Tabard (\u03a3\u0395\u03a7)|Sigma Chi]] (1960), and [[#Sigma Nu (\u03a3\u039d)|Sigma Nu]] (1963).\n\nNational social changes also affected Greek societies at Dartmouth in the 1960s and 1970s.  Many began to question the value of belonging to a national fraternal organization.  The Dartmouth chapters of [[#Alpha Chi Alpha (\u0391\u03a7\u0391)|Alpha Chi Rho]], [[#Chi Heorot (\u03a7H)|Chi Phi]], [[#Delta Upsilon (\u0394\u03a5)|Delta Upsilon]], [[#Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI)|Phi Gamma Delta]], [[#Phi Sigma Psi (\u03a6\u03a3\u03a8)|Phi Kappa Psi]], and [[#Sigma Phi Epsilon (\u03a3\u03a6\u0395)|Sigma Phi Epsilon]] all disaffiliated from their national fraternities in the 1960s.  As political activism increased, fraternities were increasingly seen as anachronistic, and in 1967, the faculty voted 67-16 to adopt a proposal to abolish fraternities at Dartmouth.  The proposal was rejected by the [[Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College|Board of Trustees]].<ref name=\"dglc\"/>\n\n=== Coeducation to the present ===\n[[Coeducation]] would dramatically change all social life at Dartmouth College, including the fraternity system.  The college first began admitting [[woman|women]] as full-time students in 1972.  By the fall of 1973, five local fraternities ([[#Alpha Theta (\u0391\u0398)|Alpha Theta]], [[#Delta Upsilon (\u0394\u03a5)|Foley House]], [[#The Tabard (\u03a3\u0395\u03a7)|The Tabard]], [[#Phi Tau (\u03a6\u03a4)|Phi Tau]], and [[#Phi Sigma Psi (\u03a6\u03a3\u03a8)|Phi Sigma Psi]]) had all decided to adopt a coeducational membership policy and admit women as full members.  The first sorority on campus, [[#Sigma Delta (\u03a3\u0394)|Sigma Kappa]], was founded in 1977.  Many alumni expressed strong concerns that the need for housing for new sororities would inevitably lead to financial pressure and the possible dissolution of existing fraternities at the college.  In response, the Trustees imposed a moratorium limiting the campus to no more than six recognized sororities.<ref name=\"peric\">{{cite news | last = Peric | first = Sabrina | title = How does single-sex Greek system fit with coeducation? | work = The Dartmouth | date = 2002-11-06}} ''[Note: article incorrectly includes Gamma Delta Chi and incorrectly excludes Phi Sigma Psi in list of Greek organizations that decided to admit women in 1973.]</ref> Converting from an all-male to a coeducational membership policy was not enough to save at least one Greek organization on campus.  In 1981, the [[#Harold Parmington Foundation (HPF)|Harold Parmington Foundation]] reorganized itself as a new coeducational fraternity [[#Delta Psi Delta (\u0394\u03a8\u0394)|Delta Psi Delta]], but the organization never attracted many new members and was finally forced to dissolve in the spring of 1991.  In addition, Foley House disassociated from the Greek system in fall 1984, transitioning into an affinity house as part of the college's residential living programs.  It moved off Webster Avenue to a new location on West Street (where it is still in operation {{as of|2013|alt= as of the 2013-14 academic year}}).''\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, College administrators introduced new initiatives to hold the Greek organizations on campus more accountable for their actions and to offer more social alternatives to the predominantly single-sex Greek system.  In 1982, the administration announced that Greek organizations would have to comply with a set of \"minimum standards\", enforced through annual reviews, in order to remain in good standing with the college.  These standards included not only health and safety regulations regarding the conditions of the Greek houses, but requirements for Greek-sponsored activities deemed beneficial to the college community at large.<ref name=\"dglc\"/>  The College introduced [[Dartmouth College student groups#Undergraduate societies|Undergraduate Societies]] to campus in 1993, as a residential and social alternative to Greek organizations.  Similar to the Greek houses in many respects, Undergraduate Societies were required to have open, coeducational membership policies.  [[#Phi Sigma Psi (\u03a6\u03a3\u03a8)|Panarchy]] voted to change its status to an undergraduate society and was joined the following year by a newly formed society, called [[Dartmouth College student groups#Amarna|Amarna]].<ref name=\"undergrad_societies\">{{cite web | work = Trustees of Dartmouth College | year = 2006 | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~orl/greek-soc/societies/undergrad.html | title = Office of Residential Life: Undergraduate Societies | accessdate = 2008-01-27 }}</ref>  In the fall of 1993, [[Student Assembly]] President Andrew Beebe, class of 1993, argued in favor of the coeducation of the entire Greek system in his remarks at fall [[Convocation#University use|Convocation]].<ref name=\"rose\">{{cite news | last = Rose | first = Jacqueline | title = Four years at Dartmouth have brought triumph and tragedy to the Class of 1996 | work = The Dartmouth | date = 1996-06-09}}</ref>  During that same academic term, College President [[James O.

Speculation that all single-sex fraternities and sororities would be required to adopt coeducational membership policies led to intense campus debate.  In a survey conducted by ''[[The Dartmouth]]'' newspaper, 49% of the student body responded, and 83% of those respondents were in favor of retaining a single-sex Greek system at Dartmouth.<ref name=\"rubenstein\">{{cite news | last = Rubenstein | first = Sarah | title = Students overwhelmingly support single-sex fraternities and sororities | work = The Dartmouth | date = 1999-02-12}}</ref>  In a December 2006 interview, College President [[James Wright (historian)|Jim Wright]] admitted that it had been \"a serious mistake\" to announce the Student Life Initiative in the manner in which it was presented to the campus, but expressed that in his opinion, \"the Greek system at Dartmouth now is stronger than it's ever been.\"<ref name=\"tapper\">{{cite news | last = Tapper | first = Jake | title = A Conversation with Jim Wright | work = Dartmouth Alumni Magazine | date = May\u2013April 2007 | pages = 99 }}</ref>\n\n== Fraternities ==\nThe single-sex male-only fraternities at Dartmouth College are largely organized and represented to the college through the Interfraternity Council (IFC). The Interfraternity Council is a student-led governance organization that assists the member Greek organizations with finances, public relations, programming, judicial administration, recruitment, and academic achievement.  [[#Alpha Phi Alpha (\u0391\u03a6\u0391)|Alpha Phi Alpha]] is not a member of the IFC, but is a member of the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]].\n[[#Lambda Upsilon Lambda (\u039b\u03a5\u039b)|Lambda Upsilon Lambda]] is also not a member of the IFC, but is a member of the [[National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations]].<ref name=\"governance\">{{cite web | publisher = Dartmouth College Office of Residential Life | year = 2007 | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~orl/greek-soc/cfs/governance.html | title = CFS Organizations & Governing Councils | accessdate = 2008-01-27 }}</ref>\n\n=== Alpha Phi Alpha (\u0391\u03a6\u0391) ===\nThe Theta Zeta chapter of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] was founded as the first historically [[African-American]] fraternity at Dartmouth College in 1972.

The Dartmouth chapter was chartered as the 381st chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha on May 12, 1972.

The fraternity secured their own house in 1982, a duplex structure that, since renovated, today houses the [[#Delta Delta Delta (\u0394\u0394\u0394)|Delta Delta Delta]] sorority.  Facing smaller membership, the fraternity decided to relocate to a smaller house near the western end of Webster Avenue in the late 1980s, and in 1992, the fraternity again relocated to College-owned apartment housing.

While the national fraternity proved to be an early leader among its peers in the area of non-discrimination, mid-1950s ''Tau chapter'' leaders led the demand for such post-war era changes. The pace of change was contentious: Phi Sigma Kappa had previously had occasional foreign student members at many chapters. Unlike other fraternities, it had also welcomed Catholics and Jews at a time when most fraternity members were Protestant. But it did not yet welcome Blacks. In a reactionary response to a short-lived policy that limited pledging of Black students between 1952\u201356, and in a move that allowed it to avoid unpaid debts to the national, ''Tau'' broke with Phi Sigma Kappa and reformed itself as Phi Tau on March 7, 1956, naming the national fraternity as racist.<ref name=\"scobie\"/>  Yet ironically, the Dartmouth chapter won the debate over the issue: the same discriminatory policy that caused ''Tau'' to withdraw was itself rescinded by the national fraternity at its Summer Convention just two months later, leaving Phi Sigma Kappa chapters free to pledge Black members. There has been no reconciliation, even though both groups remain progressive.<ref name=\"ATPS\">{{Cite book\n  | last = Rand\n  | first = Frank Prentice\n  |author2=Ralph Watts |author3=James E.

The first such society at Dartmouth, the Social Friends, was formed in 1783.  A rival organization, called the United Fraternity, was founded in 1786.  A chapter of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] was established at Dartmouth in 1787, and counted among its members [[Daniel Webster]], class of 1801.<ref name=\"webster\">{{cite web | last = Kartalopoulos | first = William B. | year = 1997 | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dwebster/1801/pbk.html | title = Daniel Webster and the Phi Beta Kappa | publisher = Dartmouth College Archives | accessdate = 2008-01-27 }}</ref>  These organizations were, in large part, the only social life available to students at the college.  The organizations hosted debates on a variety of topics not encountered in the [[curriculum]] of the day, and amassed large [[library|libraries]] of titles not found in the official College library.  Both the Social Friends and the United Fraternity created libraries in Dartmouth Hall, and met in a room called Society Hall inside Dartmouth Hall.  In 1815, the college decided to intervene in the hotly contested [[recruitment]] battle between the Social Friends and the United Fraternity by restricting each society to recruit only from separate halves of the new student class.  In 1825, the college began simply assigning new students to one society or the other.  Interest in the literary societies declined in the 1830s and 1840s.  The College library and instructional curriculum had expanded to include much of what the literary societies had supported, and new Greek letter societies began to appear on campus.<ref name=\"meacham\">{{cite web | last = Meacham | first = Scott | year = 1999 | title = Halls, Tombs and Houses: Student Society Architecture at Dartmouth | url = http://www.dartmo.com/halls/ | publisher = Dartmo.: The Buildings of Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2008-01-27 }}</ref>\n[[File:Dartmouth College Greek organizations - Kappa Kappa Kappa, early 1900s.jpg|thumb|left|The second physical plant of Kappa Kappa Kappa, located at 22 North College Street and occupied by the fraternity from 1894 to 1924.

The other faction to split from the United Fraternity organized itself on July 13, 1842, as [[#Kappa Kappa Kappa (\u039a\u039a\u039a)|Kappa Kappa Kappa]], a local fraternity. More Greek organizations were founded, and by 1855, 64% of students, mostly upperclassmen, were members of the Greek letter societies on campus.<ref name=\"meacham\"/>  Initially, the original Greek letter societies would not extend invitations of membership to first year students.

The new fraternities were self-selective and exclusive.  Each organization developed its own [[Fraternities and sororities#Rituals and symbols|secret rituals]] and procedures.  Most of the societies began to invest in creating their own meeting halls, either upstairs rooms in buildings on Main Street, or free-standing structures near campus.

The economic expansion of the 1920s created a boom in the fortunes of the fraternities, allowing many to build new brick residences near campus, including [[#Zeta Psi (\u0396\u03a8)|Zeta Psi]], [[#Kappa Kappa Kappa (\u039a\u039a\u039a)|Kappa Kappa Kappa]], [[#Phi Tau (\u03a6\u03a4)|Phi Sigma Kappa]], [[#Sigma Nu (\u03a3\u039d)|Sigma Nu]], [[#Sigma Alpha Epsilon (\u03a3\u0391\u0395)|Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[#Chi Heorot (\u03a7H)|Chi Phi]], [[#Theta Delta Chi (\u0398\u0394\u03a7)|Theta Delta Chi]], [[#Phi Gamma Delta (\u03a6\u0393\u0394)|Phi Gamma Delta]], [[#The Tabard (\u03a3\u0395\u03a7)|Sigma Chi]], [[#Gamma Delta Chi (\u0393\u0394\u03a7)|Gamma Delta Chi]], and [[#Bones Gate (BG)|Delta Tau Delta]]. It was during this period that Webster Avenue developed as \"fraternity row\".<ref name=\"meacham\"/>  The new residences were built without significant dining facilities, as the Trustees of the college had banned fraternities from serving regular meals in their chapter houses and had limited the number of resident brothers by the fall semester of 1909.<ref name=\"levermore\">{{cite news | last = Levermore | first = Charles | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/09/04/101895763.pdf | title = Forms of Associations Among College Students; Class Room as a Formative Influence Less Potent Than the Fraternity or Club -- Why Educators Antagonize the College Secret Society | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1909-09-04 | accessdate = 2008-01-27 | format=PDF}}</ref>  College administrators also challenged the fraternities to become more engaged in College life and less focused on their fraternity life during this time.

The decade of the 1930s saw almost no building projects at all in the fraternity system, and many houses could no longer afford regular maintenance.  One of the great tragedies at Dartmouth College occurred on a winter night in 1934, when nine members of [[#Alpha Theta (\u0391\u0398)|Theta Chi]] died from [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning after a metal chimney on a dilapidated coal furnace in the basement of the chapter house broke in the night.<ref name=\"time1934\">{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747133,00.html | title = Dartmouth's Saddest | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] | date = 1934-03-04 | accessdate = 2008-01-27 }}</ref>  In 1935, Dartmouth historian and professor [[Leon Burr Richardson]] asserted in a survey that, in light of the national suffering, the fraternity chapters should ask themselves if they had \"any excuse for existence.\"<ref name=\"trustees\"/>  Four fraternities dissolved during the Great Depression ([[#Alpha Sigma Phi (\u0391\u03a3\u03a6)|Alpha Sigma Phi]], [[#Alpha Tau Omega (\u0391\u03a4\u03a9)|Alpha Tau Omega]], [[#Lambda Chi Alpha (\u039b\u03a7\u0391)|Lambda Chi Alpha]], and [[#Sigma Alpha Mu (\u03a3\u0391\u039c)|Sigma Alpha Mu]]), and two ([[#Gamma Delta Chi (\u0393\u0394\u03a7)|Phi Kappa Sigma]] and [[#Gamma Delta Chi (\u0393\u0394\u03a7)|Alpha Chi Rho]]) merged to pool scarce resources in order to survive.

In 1952, the Dartmouth chapter of Theta Chi was derecognized by its national over a dispute regarding minority membership.  The Dartmouth chapter reorganized as a local fraternity named [[#Alpha Theta (\u0391\u0398)|Alpha Theta]].  A campus-wide referendum held in 1954 on the issue of desegregation of fraternities resulted in a majority in favor of requiring fraternities on campus to eliminate [[racial discrimination|racially discriminatory]] membership policies by the year 1960, and to secede from national groups that retained such policies in their charters.

Many began to question the value of belonging to a national fraternal organization.  The Dartmouth chapters of [[#Alpha Chi Alpha (\u0391\u03a7\u0391)|Alpha Chi Rho]], [[#Chi Heorot (\u03a7H)|Chi Phi]], [[#Delta Upsilon (\u0394\u03a5)|Delta Upsilon]], [[#Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI)|Phi Gamma Delta]], [[#Phi Sigma Psi (\u03a6\u03a3\u03a8)|Phi Kappa Psi]], and [[#Sigma Phi Epsilon (\u03a3\u03a6\u0395)|Sigma Phi Epsilon]] all disaffiliated from their national fraternities in the 1960s.  As political activism increased, fraternities were increasingly seen as anachronistic, and in 1967, the faculty voted 67-16 to adopt a proposal to abolish fraternities at Dartmouth.  The proposal was rejected by the [[Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College|Board of Trustees]].<ref name=\"dglc\"/>\n\n=== Coeducation to the present ===\n[[Coeducation]] would dramatically change all social life at Dartmouth College, including the fraternity system.  The college first began admitting [[woman|women]] as full-time students in 1972.  By the fall of 1973, five local fraternities ([[#Alpha Theta (\u0391\u0398)|Alpha Theta]], [[#Delta Upsilon (\u0394\u03a5)|Foley House]], [[#The Tabard (\u03a3\u0395\u03a7)|The Tabard]], [[#Phi Tau (\u03a6\u03a4)|Phi Tau]], and [[#Phi Sigma Psi (\u03a6\u03a3\u03a8)|Phi Sigma Psi]]) had all decided to adopt a coeducational membership policy and admit women as full members.  The first sorority on campus, [[#Sigma Delta (\u03a3\u0394)|Sigma Kappa]], was founded in 1977.  Many alumni expressed strong concerns that the need for housing for new sororities would inevitably lead to financial pressure and the possible dissolution of existing fraternities at the college.  In response, the Trustees imposed a moratorium limiting the campus to no more than six recognized sororities.<ref name=\"peric\">{{cite news | last = Peric | first = Sabrina | title = How does single-sex Greek system fit with coeducation? | work = The Dartmouth | date = 2002-11-06}} ''[Note: article incorrectly includes Gamma Delta Chi and incorrectly excludes Phi Sigma Psi in list of Greek organizations that decided to admit women in 1973.]</ref> Converting from an all-male to a coeducational membership policy was not enough to save at least one Greek organization on campus.  In 1981, the [[#Harold Parmington Foundation (HPF)|Harold Parmington Foundation]] reorganized itself as a new coeducational fraternity [[#Delta Psi Delta (\u0394\u03a8\u0394)|Delta Psi Delta]], but the organization never attracted many new members and was finally forced to dissolve in the spring of 1991.  In addition, Foley House disassociated from the Greek system in fall 1984, transitioning into an affinity house as part of the college's residential living programs.  It moved off Webster Avenue to a new location on West Street (where it is still in operation {{as of|2013|alt= as of the 2013-14 academic year}}).''\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, College administrators introduced new initiatives to hold the Greek organizations on campus more accountable for their actions and to offer more social alternatives to the predominantly single-sex Greek system.  In 1982, the administration announced that Greek organizations would have to comply with a set of \"minimum standards\", enforced through annual reviews, in order to remain in good standing with the college.  These standards included not only health and safety regulations regarding the conditions of the Greek houses, but requirements for Greek-sponsored activities deemed beneficial to the college community at large.<ref name=\"dglc\"/>  The College introduced [[Dartmouth College student groups#Undergraduate societies|Undergraduate Societies]] to campus in 1993, as a residential and social alternative to Greek organizations.  Similar to the Greek houses in many respects, Undergraduate Societies were required to have open, coeducational membership policies.  [[#Phi Sigma Psi (\u03a6\u03a3\u03a8)|Panarchy]] voted to change its status to an undergraduate society and was joined the following year by a newly formed society, called [[Dartmouth College student groups#Amarna|Amarna]].<ref name=\"undergrad_societies\">{{cite web | work = Trustees of Dartmouth College | year = 2006 | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~orl/greek-soc/societies/undergrad.html | title = Office of Residential Life: Undergraduate Societies | accessdate = 2008-01-27 }}</ref>  In the fall of 1993, [[Student Assembly]] President Andrew Beebe, class of 1993, argued in favor of the coeducation of the entire Greek system in his remarks at fall [[Convocation#University use|Convocation]].<ref name=\"rose\">{{cite news | last = Rose | first = Jacqueline | title = Four years at Dartmouth have brought triumph and tragedy to the Class of 1996 | work = The Dartmouth | date = 1996-06-09}}</ref>  During that same academic term, College President [[James O.

Speculation that all single-sex fraternities and sororities would be required to adopt coeducational membership policies led to intense campus debate.  In a survey conducted by ''[[The Dartmouth]]'' newspaper, 49% of the student body responded, and 83% of those respondents were in favor of retaining a single-sex Greek system at Dartmouth.<ref name=\"rubenstein\">{{cite news | last = Rubenstein | first = Sarah | title = Students overwhelmingly support single-sex fraternities and sororities | work = The Dartmouth | date = 1999-02-12}}</ref>  In a December 2006 interview, College President [[James Wright (historian)|Jim Wright]] admitted that it had been \"a serious mistake\" to announce the Student Life Initiative in the manner in which it was presented to the campus, but expressed that in his opinion, \"the Greek system at Dartmouth now is stronger than it's ever been.\"<ref name=\"tapper\">{{cite news | last = Tapper | first = Jake | title = A Conversation with Jim Wright | work = Dartmouth Alumni Magazine | date = May\u2013April 2007 | pages = 99 }}</ref>\n\n== Fraternities ==\nThe single-sex male-only fraternities at Dartmouth College are largely organized and represented to the college through the Interfraternity Council (IFC). The Interfraternity Council is a student-led governance organization that assists the member Greek organizations with finances, public relations, programming, judicial administration, recruitment, and academic achievement.  [[#Alpha Phi Alpha (\u0391\u03a6\u0391)|Alpha Phi Alpha]] is not a member of the IFC, but is a member of the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]].\n[[#Lambda Upsilon Lambda (\u039b\u03a5\u039b)|Lambda Upsilon Lambda]] is also not a member of the IFC, but is a member of the [[National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations]].<ref name=\"governance\">{{cite web | publisher = Dartmouth College Office of Residential Life | year = 2007 | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~orl/greek-soc/cfs/governance.html | title = CFS Organizations & Governing Councils | accessdate = 2008-01-27 }}</ref>\n\n=== Alpha Phi Alpha (\u0391\u03a6\u0391) ===\nThe Theta Zeta chapter of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] was founded as the first historically [[African-American]] fraternity at Dartmouth College in 1972.  The first members of the fraternity traveled to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] on the weekends of the 1971 spring academic term to attend pledge events at the Sigma chapter.  The Dartmouth chapter was chartered as the 381st chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha on May 12, 1972.  Early chapter meetings on campus were held in both the [[List of Dartmouth College buildings#The Choate Cluster|Choates]] dormitories and [[List of Dartmouth College buildings#Affinity programs|Cutter-Shabazz Hall]].  The fraternity secured their own house in 1982, a duplex structure that, since renovated, today houses the [[#Delta Delta Delta (\u0394\u0394\u0394)|Delta Delta Delta]] sorority.  Facing smaller membership, the fraternity decided to relocate to a smaller house near the western end of Webster Avenue in the late 1980s, and in 1992, the fraternity again relocated to College-owned apartment housing.

The club's concept was based on the love for the [[Dartmouth College traditions|traditions of Dartmouth]], faithful friendship, and honorable dealings.  In 1907, the Pukwana Club joined the national fraternity system after it received a charter to become the Delta Beta chapter of Sigma Nu.  Sigma Nu's \"Way of Honor\" principle was very similar to the principles expressed in the Pukwana Club's original charter.  The first residence for Sigma Nu at Dartmouth was purchased and refurbished in 1911.  Known as the Green Castle, it served as chapter headquarters until the current house was built in 1925. In response to the national fraternity's segregationist membership policies, the fraternity went local in 1963, becoming Sigma Nu Delta. The national fraternity's bylaws were changed at the 1968 Grand Chapter,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sigmanucornell.org/public7.asp|title=Sigma Nu Cornell&nbsp;-&nbsp;Chapter History}}</ref> and in 1984 the fraternity reaffiliated with the national.<ref name=\"betts\">Betts, Sarah (2003). \"Dartmouth has complicated legacy of racial conflict\".

Improvements included an enclosed fire escape running from the first floor to the third floor, a redone kitchen and bathroom, new flooring, a new study room, and alterations to bedrooms.  Prominent alumni include acting Solicitor General of the United States [[Neal Katyal]] '91, associate commissioner for the New York State Office for Temporary and Disability Assistance [[Jorge Montalvo]], and ''Dungeons & Dragons'' designer and writer [[Mike Mearls]].\n\n=== Phi Delta Alpha (\u03a6\u0394\u0391) ===\n[[File:Phi Delta Alpha, Dartmouth.jpg|right|thumb|Phi Delta Alpha, 1986]]\nPhi Delta Alpha (''\"Phi Delt\" or \"The Zig\"'') was founded in 1884 as the New Hampshire Alpha chapter of [[Phi Delta Theta]], a national fraternity.  Early meetings of the fraternity were held in the Tontine Building on Main Street. The meeting location moved to the Currier Building in 1887 when the Tontine Building burned down.  Phi Delta Theta began construction on a new house in 1898, and the building was completed in 1902, designed by [[Charles A. Rich|Charles Alonzo Rich]] of [[Lamb & Rich]], modeled after the [[Hancock Manor]] in Boston, Massachusetts.  In January 1960, the Dartmouth chapter broke away from the national because the national would not allow minorities to pledge the house.  The new, local fraternity replaced the last letter in its name with Alpha.<ref name=\"Unattributed_1960\">Unattributed (1960). \"Unit Quits Fraternity; Dartmouth Phi Delta Theta Chapter Cites Bias Clause.\"  ''The New York Times''.

One of the primary reasons for the punishment was that four members of Phi Delta Alpha started a fire in the [[#Chi Gamma Epsilon (\u03a7\u0393\u0395)|Chi Gamma Epsilon]] basement next door.   Under the leadership of Gig Faux, class of 1984, Phi Delta Alpha applied to the college for rerecognition in fall 2002.

The Dartmouth chapter dissociated from the national fraternity in 1987.<ref name=\"dglc\"/>  The disputes with the national organization were primarily over funding for repairs to the house.  Initially, the new local fraternity adopted the name Kappa Sigma Gamma, but the national fraternity took offense to the likeness of the names.  After a period simply being known by its address, 7 Webster, the fraternity came upon the name by which it is now known, and adopted the house motto \"Come As You Are\".

In 1903, the fraternity moved to its present location, and in 1927 it sold off its eighteenth-century house and built the house that stands today.  In 1968, the house dissociated from the national fraternity, and adopted the name Chi Phi Heorot.<ref name=\"dglc\"/>  The \"Heorot\" in Chi Phi Heorot comes from the [[medieval]] [[poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'', in which [[Heorot]] is the great hall where [[warrior]]s converge to tell their stories.  After several suspensions by the college in the early 1980s, it re-joined the Chi Phi national in 1981.  This was short-lived; in 1987, because of damage done to the house that the college insisted upon having repaired for [[safety]] reasons but the Chi Phi national refused to help finance, the Dartmouth brotherhood again opted to become a local fraternity.  In exchange for financing renovations to the structure, the college assumed ownership of the property and house.  In its second incarnation as a local fraternity, the brotherhood chose the name Chi Heorot.<ref name=\"meacham2\">Meacham, Scott (1999).

In April 1981, Sigma Kappa moved into a residence formerly inhabited by the [[#Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI)|Phi Gamma Delta]] fraternity.

The Dartmouth chapter dissociated from the national organization in the fall of 1988, becoming Sigma Delta.  The classes of 1989, 1990, and 1991 that formed the new local sorority dedicated the new organization to principles of \"strength, friendship, and acceptance of difference\".

While the national fraternity proved to be an early leader among its peers in the area of non-discrimination, mid-1950s ''Tau chapter'' leaders led the demand for such post-war era changes. The pace of change was contentious: Phi Sigma Kappa had previously had occasional foreign student members at many chapters. Unlike other fraternities, it had also welcomed Catholics and Jews at a time when most fraternity members were Protestant. But it did not yet welcome Blacks. In a reactionary response to a short-lived policy that limited pledging of Black students between 1952\u201356, and in a move that allowed it to avoid unpaid debts to the national, ''Tau'' broke with Phi Sigma Kappa and reformed itself as Phi Tau on March 7, 1956, naming the national fraternity as racist.<ref name=\"scobie\"/>  Yet ironically, the Dartmouth chapter won the debate over the issue: the same discriminatory policy that caused ''Tau'' to withdraw was itself rescinded by the national fraternity at its Summer Convention just two months later, leaving Phi Sigma Kappa chapters free to pledge Black members.

The ruling came seven years after the school's refusal to sign a [[Title IX]] compliance form, which would have subjected the entire school to federal regulations, even ones not yet issued. The court ruled 6\u20133 that acceptance by students of federal educational grants fell under the regulatory requirements of Title IX, but it limited the application to the school's financial aid department.\n\nIn 1988, new legislation subjected every department of any educational institution that received federal funding to Title IX requirements.

By the end of this period, Grove City's administration was on the AAUP's list of censured administrations longer than any other college on the list. In its report, the AAUP Investigative Committee at Grove City concluded that \"the absence of due process [in the dismissal of professors at Grove City] raises... doubts regarding the academic security of any persons who may hold appointment at Grove City College under existing administrative practice. These doubts are of an order of magnitude which obliges us to report them to the academic profession at large.\"  In 2013 Grove City started working to remove itself from the censure list.  Two years later, the school admitted that they would have handled Dr. Gara's case rather differently under their current procedures.

Over the years, other sororities and one fraternity, Chi Delta Epsilon, have ceased to exist. The most recent sorority to become defunct was the short-lived Delta Chi Omega, which was founded in 1980 and lasted approximately one decade.  Sigma Sigma Sigma, founded in 1917, changed its name to Zeta Zeta Zeta in 1989 in response to threats of trademark infringement litigation from the national sorority [[Sigma Sigma Sigma]]. They then changed their name again in 2018 to The Independents. Other fraternities and sororities have died out (meaning all their active members graduated or left the college) but have been reinstituted via block classes that assumed the organization's name, traditions and practices.\n\nBoth fraternities and sororities are overseen by governing bodies. The fraternities each send delegates to weekly meetings of the Interfraternity Council. The sororities' counterpart organization, the Pan-Hellenic Council, also meets each week. In the spring, the two councils hold joint meetings to plan the annual Greek Games. The Greek Games, a multi-day event which involved such activities as water balloon tossing and egg dropping, have declined in notoriety at Grove City College along with the size of Greek organizations; until the 1990s they were well-known on campus, with the majority of the student body either participating or spectating.  The annual All Campus Sing, formerly called Greek Sing, includes fraternities, sororities, housing groups, and independent groups and remains a popular competition occurring during Parents Weekend on the campus every year.\n\n==Athletics==\n[[File:GroveCityWolverines.png|thumb|left|Official athletics logo.]]\nGrove City has been fielding athletics teams for over a century.  In 1906, they were one of the 39 charter members of the IAAUS, the forerunner of the NCAA.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Economics of Intercollegiate Sports: Second Edition\n|author=Randy R Grant, John C Leadley, Zenon X Zygmont |isbn=9814583391 |year=2015}}</ref>\n\nGrove City College, known athletically as the Wolverines, competes in the [[Presidents' Athletic Conference]] (PAC) of [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division III|Division III]]. On the varsity level, Grove City College has [[basketball]], [[cross country running|cross country]], [[golf]], [[soccer]], [[cheerleading]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[tennis]], and [[Track and field|track]] teams for both men and women. [[Lacrosse]], [[baseball]], [[rugby union]] and [[American football|football]] are varsity sports available to men only, while [[softball]], and [[water polo]] are varsity sports offered to women only.  In April 2016, men's lacrosse was announced as the 22nd varsity sport and will begin in the 2018 spring season as a member of the Ohio River Lacrosse Conference (joint venture between Presidents' Athletic Conference and Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference).\n\nGrove City also offers a number of club sports to men and women including but not limited to ultimate, and [[volleyball]] for men and [[field hockey]], [[lacrosse]], and [[rugby football|rugby]] for women. These teams have been very successful, most notably the men's club volleyball team, which has finished in the top 10 in the country each of the last two years, the men's lacrosse team, which finished in the top 10 in the country in 2015, and both the men's and women's rugby teams which have been ranked in the top 10 in the country by the National Small College Rugby Organization.\n\nIntramural sports for men are as follows: basketball, [[bowling]], dodgeball, football, soccer, softball, [[table tennis]], tennis, [[ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], and volleyball. Women have [[badminton]], basketball, bowling, [[flag football]], [[indoor soccer]], [[kickball]], [[racquetball]], ultimate, and volleyball.\n\nGrove City has several teams with remarkable PAC Championship records. Grove City's women's tennis team had won 25 consecutive PAC championships from 1987 through 2011 and the men's tennis team won 26 consecutive PAC championships between 1990 and 2016. In addition, the women's cross country team has won 27 consecutive PAC championships (1989\u20132015). The men's swim team also has 5 consecutive PAC championships, 2008\u20132012, while the women won 10 consecutive PAC championships from 2009\u20132018. Also notable is the overall swim team record of 61 consecutive winning seasons, from 1952\u20132012.\n\nIn 2018, the schools assistant sports information director was charged with nearly 100 counts for crimes ranging from privacy violations to possession of child pornography after it was discovered he had been secretly recording students who were showering in the colleges locker room.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/shocking-allegations-surround-former-grove-city-college-official/1236987639|title=Shocking allegations surround former Grove City College official|last=Ricciutti|first=Gerry|date=2018-06-13|work=WKBN|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wfmj.com/story/38320404/former-grove-city-college-employee-allegedly-records-students|title=Former Grove City College employee allegedly records students|last=Koziol|first=Brandon|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://butlerradio.com/wv-man-accused-of-recording-grove-city-college-students-in-locker-room/|title=WV Man Accused Of Recording Grove City College Students In Locker Room - ButlerRadio.com - Butler, PA|date=2018-06-01|work=ButlerRadio.com - Butler, PA|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[File:gcc rainbow bridge.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Rainbow Bridge, which stretches over Wolf Creek and connects upper and lower campus.]]\n\n==Traditions==\n===Coat of Arms===\nThe coat of arms of Grove City College was adopted on June 13, 1911.<ref name=home/> It is [[blazon]]ed:\n\n:''Gules,<br> an open book argent,<br> inscribed \"Lux mea\" in letters sable,<br> bound of the second,<br> between three wolves' heads erased also of the second.''\n\nThe coat of arms is utilized on official documents like diplomas and transcripts, while the more modern three notched crimson shield logo is utilized on all college publications, stationary and related merchandise and materials.<ref>{{cite web|title=Crimson shield introduced as new College logo in 2002|url=http://www.gcc.edu/news/campus/stories/shield.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020308044322/http://www.gcc.edu/news/campus/stories/shield.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2002-03-08}}</ref>\n\n===Alma Mater===\nThe Grove City alma mater, entitled \"Mid the Pines\" was written in 1912 by student Edward G. Seel. Seel's lyrics were consequently put to music composed by Grove City professor Hermann Poehlmann. The lyrics are as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Crimson Student Handbook, 2015-16|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55ccfca9e4b03e8de40aed7f/t/5608a0abe4b0e8ed89e266fc/1443405995342/Crimson_2015-16.pdf}}</ref>\n\n:''\u2018Mid the pines in columns growing,<br>By the stream so deeply flowing,<br>Dear to hearts with mem\u2019ries glowing,<br>Stand the halls, the halls we love.<br><br>Chorus:<br>Hail to thee our Alma Mater,<br>Praises from each son and daughter,<br>Pledges of love and honor Grove City still shall own,<br>Pledges of love and honor Grove City still shall own,<br>Pledges of love and honor Grove City still shall own.<br><br>Tho\u2019 the land and sea may part us,<br>Far remove thy towers and campus,<br>Staunch and true there dwells within us,<br>All the spirit of thy life,<br>Staunch and true there dwells within us,<br>All the spirit of thy life.<br><br>Chorus.\n\nIn addition to the alma mater, Professor Poehlmann composed many other pieces of music for the college. In Grove City's early years, many unique songs were composed for different groups and occasions. In 1913, the administration of President Alexander T. Ormand had many of the school's songs compiled into a songbook known as ''Songs of Grove City College.'' Over the years, the practice of writing and singing original compositions diminished at Grove City and the songbook was eventually retired.<ref>{{cite web|title=Songs of Grove City College|url=https://alumni.gcc.edu/s/1472/17/interior.aspx?sid=1472&gid=1&pgid=252&cid=2942&ecid=2942&ciid=7013&crid=0}}</ref>\n\n==People==\n===Notable alumni===\n* [[David M.

Starting March 1942, each month a new group of 100 Navy and Marine students arrived for three months of 14-hour days in concentrated electrical engineering study. ETP admission required passing the [[Eddy Test]], one of the most selective qualifying exams given during the war years.<ref>Test and Research Staff, Bureau of Naval Personnel; \"Psychological test construction and research in the Bureau of Naval Personnel.

By the fall of 1943, there were only 81 civilian men in the student body; thus, the presence of 300 or so servicemen contributed greatly in sustaining the College.

MacKenzie, the college was the plaintiff-appellee in the landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case in 1984, ''Grove City College v. Bell''. The ruling came seven years after the school's refusal to sign a [[Title IX]] compliance form, which would have subjected the entire school to federal regulations, even ones not yet issued. The court ruled 6\u20133 that acceptance by students of federal educational grants fell under the regulatory requirements of Title IX, but it limited the application to the school's financial aid department.\n\nIn 1988, new legislation subjected every department of any educational institution that received federal funding to Title IX requirements. In response, Grove City College withdrew from the [[Pell Grant]] program entirely beginning with the 1988\u201389 academic year, replacing such grants to students with its own program, the Student Freedom Fund.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Walter|title=Standing up to the Washington Leviathan|url=http://articles.philly.com/1996-11-13/news/25650722_1_grove-city-college-student-loan-programs-pell-grant-program|work=Daily News|publisher=Philly.com of the Philadelphia Inquirer|accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> In October 1996, the college withdrew from the [[Stafford Loan]] program, providing entering students with replacements through a program with [[PNC Bank]].<ref name=\"Observer-Reporter, Washington, PA\">{{cite web|title=Tired of intrusions, school cuts ties with government|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&dat=19961024&id=XLRdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yF0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=1379,3426486|work=Daily edition, 10/24/1996, page A9, AP-Pittsburgh|publisher=Observer-Reporter, Washington, PA|accessdate=2013-05-28}}</ref>\n\nGrove City is one of a handful of colleges (along with [[Hillsdale College]], which did likewise after the aforementioned 1984 case<ref name=\"Observer-Reporter, Washington, PA\"/>) that does not allow its students to accept federal financial aid of any kind, including grants, loans and scholarships.<ref>{{cite web|title=[GCC Financial Aid] FAQ|url=http://www.gcc.edu/Home/Admissions-Financial-Aid/Financial-Aid-Scholarships/Financial-Aid-Information/FAQ|accessdate=2019-08-19}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gcc quad.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Grove City's central quad in the spring]]\n\n===Recent history===\nFrom 1963 until 2016, the [[American Association of University Professors]] placed Grove City under censure for violations of [[tenure]] and [[academic freedom]] because of the dismissal of Professor of History and Political Science Dr. Larry Gara. By the end of this period, Grove City's administration was on the AAUP's list of censured administrations longer than any other college on the list. In its report, the AAUP Investigative Committee at Grove City concluded that \"the absence of due process [in the dismissal of professors at Grove City] raises... doubts regarding the academic security of any persons who may hold appointment at Grove City College under existing administrative practice. These doubts are of an order of magnitude which obliges us to report them to the academic profession at large.\"  In 2013 Grove City started working to remove itself from the censure list.  Two years later, the school admitted that they would have handled Dr. Gara's case rather differently under their current procedures.  This led the AAUP to lift their sanction on the school at its annual meeting in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/9BCCF01E-DD4A-4A1A-87D7-89B490EE788A/0/GroveCity.pdf |format=PDF |title=Academic Freedom and Tenure : Grove City College |publisher=Aaup.org |accessdate=2015-07-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/about/censuredadmins/|title=Censure List|work=aaup.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gcc.edu/Home/News-Archive/News-Article/gcc-action-prompts-removal-of-half-century-censure-by-american-association-of-university-professors |title=GCC action prompts removal of half-century censure by American Association of University Professors |date=June 20, 2016 |publisher=Grove City College |access-date=January 21, 2019}}</ref> Gara received an apology from the school in October 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/2015/10/28/breaking-news/53-years-after-his-firing-college-professor-gets-apology-2/|title=53 years after his firing, college professor gets apology|last=Stacy|first=Mitch|date=October 8, 2015|work=Honolulu Star Adviser|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Grove City founded its [[Center for Vision and Values]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visandvals.org/|title=The Center for Vision & Values at Grove City College - a conservative think tank promoting truth and liberty through a vision of faith and freedom.|work=Visandvals.org|accessdate=2015-07-03}}</ref> further advancing its programs in the humanities.

Legal age students are permitted to consume alcohol off campus, provided that they do not appear inebriated upon their return. Current student organizations must agree to a strong policy regarding alcohol use both on and off campus, their violation resulting in the loss of their charter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gcc.edu/studentlife/New-Student-Info/Documents/Crimson_2013-14.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Crimson Student Handbook : 2013-4 |publisher=Gcc.edu |accessdate=2015-07-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924021112/http://www.gcc.edu/studentlife/New-Student-Info/Documents/Crimson_2013-14.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, The Princeton Review listed Grove City College as the 2nd most LGBT-unfriendly school in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.princetonreview.com/schoollist.aspx?type=r&id=677 |title= Ranking Categories: Demographics |work= Princeton Review College Ranking |publisher= The Princeton Review |accessdate= 2012-04-09}}</ref> As of 2016, they are ranked 9th.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.princetonreview.com/schools/1022985/college/grove-city-college|title=Grove City College|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nBy refusing to accept federal funds and so-called Title IV financial aid (from the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]]), Grove City is not required to adhere to various federal guidelines that (i) prevent sex-based and many other forms of discrimination (e.g., [[Title IX]] of the [[Education Amendments of 1972]]), (ii) regulate investigations into accusations of sexual abuse, (iii) require the collecting and sharing of information about crimes on campus ([[Clery Act]]), and (iv) set standards for disciplinary proceedings ([https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/2016 Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act]).<ref>See Ibby Caputo and Jon Marcus, \"The Controversial Reason Some Religious Colleges Forgo Federal Funding,\" ''The Atlantic'', July 7, 2016, accessed online at https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/07/the-controversial-reason-some-religious-colleges-forgo-federal-funding/490253/</ref>\n\n===Tuition===\nTuition for the 2017-18 academic year was $17,254, and room and board was $9,400.<ref name=\"GCCFS\"/>\n\n==Groups and organizations==\nGCC hosts approximately 150 Student Organizations and Activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gcc.edu/Campus_Organizations.php |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120731064304/http://www.gcc.edu/Campus_Organizations.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 31, 2012 |title=CAMPUS ORGANIZATIONS |publisher=Grove City College |accessdate=May 8, 2009 }}</ref> Among them are:\n* Orientation Board (OB) \u2013 welcomes the incoming students beginning on move-in day and throughout the year.

The call-letters were predated by experimental stations at the college dating back to 1914. In 1968, WSAJ-FM was put on the air and currently broadcasts at 91.1&nbsp;MHz, functioning as a learning tool for all students, but especially those in the communication and engineering majors. The 100-watt AM station, operating from a longwire antenna on 1340&nbsp;kHz, was one of the few remaining stations in the US to share time. It surrendered its broadcast license in 2006. The 1,600-watt FM signal covers a 30&nbsp;mi radius in Western Pennsylvania. The station broadcasts fine arts programming, college football and basketball games. It also airs community events and high school sports. Students host weekly music shows during the evening hours when school is in session.\n\n===Fraternities, sororities, and housing groups===\n[[Fraternities and sororities]] live on campus, in pre-selected upperclassman halls. Grove City's fraternities and sororities are local and are not affiliated with any of the national [[List of Greek umbrella organizations|Greek umbrella organizations]].<ref name=\"gcc.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gcc.edu/studentlife/campus-organizations/Pages/Social-Groups.aspx|title=Social Groups|work=gcc.edu|accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref>  Many of the social fraternities and sororities were established in the early 1900s and are among the country's oldest local fraternities and sororities. Over the years, other sororities and one fraternity, Chi Delta Epsilon, have ceased to exist. The most recent sorority to become defunct was the short-lived Delta Chi Omega, which was founded in 1980 and lasted approximately one decade.  Sigma Sigma Sigma, founded in 1917, changed its name to Zeta Zeta Zeta in 1989 in response to threats of trademark infringement litigation from the national sorority [[Sigma Sigma Sigma]]. They then changed their name again in 2018 to The Independents. Other fraternities and sororities have died out (meaning all their active members graduated or left the college) but have been reinstituted via block classes that assumed the organization's name, traditions and practices.\n\nBoth fraternities and sororities are overseen by governing bodies. The fraternities each send delegates to weekly meetings of the Interfraternity Council. The sororities' counterpart organization, the Pan-Hellenic Council, also meets each week. In the spring, the two councils hold joint meetings to plan the annual Greek Games. The Greek Games, a multi-day event which involved such activities as water balloon tossing and egg dropping, have declined in notoriety at Grove City College along with the size of Greek organizations; until the 1990s they were well-known on campus, with the majority of the student body either participating or spectating.  The annual All Campus Sing, formerly called Greek Sing, includes fraternities, sororities, housing groups, and independent groups and remains a popular competition occurring during Parents Weekend on the campus every year.\n\n==Athletics==\n[[File:GroveCityWolverines.png|thumb|left|Official athletics logo.]]\nGrove City has been fielding athletics teams for over a century.  In 1906, they were one of the 39 charter members of the IAAUS, the forerunner of the NCAA.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Economics of Intercollegiate Sports: Second Edition\n|author=Randy R Grant, John C Leadley, Zenon X Zygmont |isbn=9814583391 |year=2015}}</ref>\n\nGrove City College, known athletically as the Wolverines, competes in the [[Presidents' Athletic Conference]] (PAC) of [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division III|Division III]]. On the varsity level, Grove City College has [[basketball]], [[cross country running|cross country]], [[golf]], [[soccer]], [[cheerleading]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[tennis]], and [[Track and field|track]] teams for both men and women. [[Lacrosse]], [[baseball]], [[rugby union]] and [[American football|football]] are varsity sports available to men only, while [[softball]], and [[water polo]] are varsity sports offered to women only.  In April 2016, men's lacrosse was announced as the 22nd varsity sport and will begin in the 2018 spring season as a member of the Ohio River Lacrosse Conference (joint venture between Presidents' Athletic Conference and Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference).\n\nGrove City also offers a number of club sports to men and women including but not limited to ultimate, and [[volleyball]] for men and [[field hockey]], [[lacrosse]], and [[rugby football|rugby]] for women. These teams have been very successful, most notably the men's club volleyball team, which has finished in the top 10 in the country each of the last two years, the men's lacrosse team, which finished in the top 10 in the country in 2015, and both the men's and women's rugby teams which have been ranked in the top 10 in the country by the National Small College Rugby Organization.\n\nIntramural sports for men are as follows: basketball, [[bowling]], dodgeball, football, soccer, softball, [[table tennis]], tennis, [[ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], and volleyball. Women have [[badminton]], basketball, bowling, [[flag football]], [[indoor soccer]], [[kickball]], [[racquetball]], ultimate, and volleyball.\n\nGrove City has several teams with remarkable PAC Championship records. Grove City's women's tennis team had won 25 consecutive PAC championships from 1987 through 2011 and the men's tennis team won 26 consecutive PAC championships between 1990 and 2016. In addition, the women's cross country team has won 27 consecutive PAC championships (1989\u20132015). The men's swim team also has 5 consecutive PAC championships, 2008\u20132012, while the women won 10 consecutive PAC championships from 2009\u20132018. Also notable is the overall swim team record of 61 consecutive winning seasons, from 1952\u20132012.\n\nIn 2018, the schools assistant sports information director was charged with nearly 100 counts for crimes ranging from privacy violations to possession of child pornography after it was discovered he had been secretly recording students who were showering in the colleges locker room.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/shocking-allegations-surround-former-grove-city-college-official/1236987639|title=Shocking allegations surround former Grove City College official|last=Ricciutti|first=Gerry|date=2018-06-13|work=WKBN|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wfmj.com/story/38320404/former-grove-city-college-employee-allegedly-records-students|title=Former Grove City College employee allegedly records students|last=Koziol|first=Brandon|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://butlerradio.com/wv-man-accused-of-recording-grove-city-college-students-in-locker-room/|title=WV Man Accused Of Recording Grove City College Students In Locker Room - ButlerRadio.com - Butler, PA|date=2018-06-01|work=ButlerRadio.com - Butler, PA|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[File:gcc rainbow bridge.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Rainbow Bridge, which stretches over Wolf Creek and connects upper and lower campus.]]\n\n==Traditions==\n===Coat of Arms===\nThe coat of arms of Grove City College was adopted on June 13, 1911.<ref name=home/> It is [[blazon]]ed:\n\n:''Gules,<br> an open book argent,<br> inscribed \"Lux mea\" in letters sable,<br> bound of the second,<br> between three wolves' heads erased also of the second.''\n\nThe coat of arms is utilized on official documents like diplomas and transcripts, while the more modern three notched crimson shield logo is utilized on all college publications, stationary and related merchandise and materials.<ref>{{cite web|title=Crimson shield introduced as new College logo in 2002|url=http://www.gcc.edu/news/campus/stories/shield.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020308044322/http://www.gcc.edu/news/campus/stories/shield.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2002-03-08}}</ref>\n\n===Alma Mater===\nThe Grove City alma mater, entitled \"Mid the Pines\" was written in 1912 by student Edward G. Seel. Seel's lyrics were consequently put to music composed by Grove City professor Hermann Poehlmann. The lyrics are as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Crimson Student Handbook, 2015-16|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55ccfca9e4b03e8de40aed7f/t/5608a0abe4b0e8ed89e266fc/1443405995342/Crimson_2015-16.pdf}}</ref>\n\n:''\u2018Mid the pines in columns growing,<br>By the stream so deeply flowing,<br>Dear to hearts with mem\u2019ries glowing,<br>Stand the halls, the halls we love.<br><br>Chorus:<br>Hail to thee our Alma Mater,<br>Praises from each son and daughter,<br>Pledges of love and honor Grove City still shall own,<br>Pledges of love and honor Grove City still shall own,<br>Pledges of love and honor Grove City still shall own.<br><br>Tho\u2019 the land and sea may part us,<br>Far remove thy towers and campus,<br>Staunch and true there dwells within us,<br>All the spirit of thy life,<br>Staunch and true there dwells within us,<br>All the spirit of thy life.<br><br>Chorus.\n\nIn addition to the alma mater, Professor Poehlmann composed many other pieces of music for the college. In Grove City's early years, many unique songs were composed for different groups and occasions. In 1913, the administration of President Alexander T. Ormand had many of the school's songs compiled into a songbook known as ''Songs of Grove City College.'' Over the years, the practice of writing and singing original compositions diminished at Grove City and the songbook was eventually retired.<ref>{{cite web|title=Songs of Grove City College|url=https://alumni.gcc.edu/s/1472/17/interior.aspx?sid=1472&gid=1&pgid=252&cid=2942&ecid=2942&ciid=7013&crid=0}}</ref>\n\n==People==\n===Notable alumni===\n* [[David M.
