Jun-seok proposed one last heist to his best friends Jang-ho and Ki-hoon, in order for the trio to escape their miserable situations.\n\nTheir target is an illegal gambling house, which stores hefty stacks of US dollars. The trio recruits Sang-soo, who currently works in the gambling house. After getting firearms from Bong-sik, a friend Jun-seok knew in prison, the quartet proceeds with the heist, which finished messy but successful. They took a large sum of cash and the gambling house's surveillance hard drives, which contain footage of shady dealings between the gambling house's owners and various criminals. After the heist, Sang-soo requests to stay in the city a little longer to continue working at the gambling house, in order to avoid raising suspicion of his involvement in the heist. The trio left to go to Ki-hoon's parents' home.\n\nThe loss of the surveillance hard drives made the gambling house's owners unhappy, and recruits killer Han to track the quartet and retrieve the hard drives. Han visits Bong-sik and forced him to call Jun-seok to know the trio's current location, before killing him. Han then tracked down Sang-soo, and kills him off-screen, taking his phone. Jun-seok woke up from a nightmare and went to a bar. He received a call from Sang-soo's phone, but realising that it was not Sang-soo who called him, he got out of the bar and asked Jang-ho and Ki-hoon to pack up and run away, knowing that someone is out to hunt them down.\n\nTrying to get away from the lodge, Han shot Jang-ho and the car crashed. Han gave the trio a 5 minute advantage before continuing the hunt, and they drove away to the hospital to treat Jang-ho's injury. At the hospital, as they were resting, Jun-seok saw Han arriving at the hospital and the trio managed to escape, taking the car Han drove. They later realised the car is a police cruiser that has access to the city's surveillance cameras, assuming that Han is a cop. Han was taken away by the police, but was then released on the road under the order of the police chief.\n\nThe trio arrived at the harbor, where they have to stay until dawn. Realising that his parents are in trouble, Ki-hoon returns to his parents' home, saying goodbye to Jun-seok, who is outside. Jun-seok returns at night and saw an unknown car near the entrance, immediately realising that Han has arrived. Jun-seok and Jang-ho escaped from Han and runs to a nearby car, but Han shoots at them before the car can start up. Jun-seok suggested to fight against Han for their only chance to escape.\n\nIn the shootout, Han shot Jang-ho multiple times and the latter eventually succumbed to his injuries, leaving Jun-seok alone to fight against Han. As Jun-seok is about to be shot dead by Han, a group of masked men led by a black market arms dealer, who happens to be Bong-sik's twin brother and is seeking revenge for his death, arrives to kill Han. The masked men shot Han numerous times and is knocked off the edges of the docks, into the sea.\n\nAt dawn, Jun-seok takes the boat to Taiwan and then stayed on for some time, but still cannot forget about the loss of his friends. Jun-seok received information that Han has survived from the previous shooting. Jun-seok, now better at firing guns, knew that he will never escape from Han and decided to return to South Korea to face Han once again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lee Je-hoon]] as Jun-seok\n* [[Ahn Jae-hong

{"title_page": "Semantic query", "text_new": "'''Semantic queries''' allow for queries and analytics of associative and [[Contextualization (computer science)|contextual]] nature. Semantic queries enable the retrieval of both explicitly and implicitly derived information based on syntactic, semantic and structural information contained in data. They are designed to deliver precise results (possibly the distinctive selection of one single piece of information) or to answer more fuzzy and wide open questions through [[pattern matching]] and [[Reasoning system|digital reasoning]].\n\nSemantic queries work on [[named graphs]], [[Linked Data|linked data]] or [[Semantic triple|triples]]. This enables the query to process the actual relationships between information and ''infer'' the answers from the ''network of data''. This is in contrast to [[semantic search]], which uses [[semantics]] (the science of meaning) in [[Unstructured data|unstructured text]] to produce a better search result. (See [[natural language processing]].)\n\nFrom a technical point of view, semantic queries are precise relational-type operations much like a [[SQL|database query]]. They work on structured data and therefore have the possibility to utilize comprehensive features like operators (e.g. >, < and =), namespaces, [[pattern matching]], [[Type inheritance|subclassing]], [[transitive relation]]s, [[Semantic Web Rule Language|semantic rules]] and contextual [[Full-text index|full text search]]. The [[semantic web]] technology stack of the [[W3C]] is offering [[SPARQL]]<ref name=\"XML.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/11/16/introducing-sparql-querying-semantic-web-tutorial.html |title=Introducing SPARQL: Querying the Semantic Web |publisher=XML.com|date=2005}}</ref><ref name=\"W3C\">{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query |title=SPARQL Query Language for RDF |publisher=W3C|date=2008}}</ref> to formulate semantic queries in a syntax similar to [[SQL]]. Semantic queries are used in [[triplestore]]s, [[graph databases]], [[semantic wiki]]s, natural language and artificial intelligence systems.\n\n== Background ==\n\n[[Relational database]]s represent all relationships between data in an ''implicit'' manner only.<ref name=\"ACM-DL\">{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1646157 |title=Semantic queries in databases: problems and challenges |publisher=ACM Digital Library|date=2009}}</ref><ref name=\"ESWC\">{{cite web|url=http://2012.eswc-conferences.org/sites/default/files/eswc2012_submission_357.pdf |title=Karma: A System for Mapping Structured Sources into the Semantic Web |publisher=eswc-conferences.org|date=2012}}</ref> For example, the relationships between customers and products (stored in two content-tables and connected with an additional link-table) only come into existence in a query statement ([[SQL]] in the case of relational databases) written by a developer. Writing the query demands exact knowledge of the [[database schema]].<ref name=\"IEEE\">{{cite web|url=http://www-scf.usc.edu/~taheriya/papers/taheriyan14-icsc-paper.pdf |title=A Scalable Approach to Learn Semantic Models of Structured Sources |publisher=8th IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing|date=2014}}</ref><ref name=\"AAAI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.isi.edu/integration/papers/knoblock13-sbd.pdf |title=Semantics for Big Data Integration and Analysis |publisher=AAAI Fall Symposium on Semantics for Big Data|date=2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Linked Data|Linked-Data]] represent all relationships between data in an ''explicit'' manner. In the above example, no query code needs to be written. The correct product for each customer can be fetched automatically. Whereas this simple example is trivial, the real power of linked-data comes into play when a ''network of information'' is created (customers with their geo-spatial information like city, state and country; products with their categories within sub- and super-categories). Now the system can automatically answer more complex queries and analytics that look for the connection of a particular location with a product category. The development effort for this query is omitted. Executing a semantic query is conducted by ''walking'' the network of information and finding matches (also called ''Data Graph Traversal'').\n\nAnother important aspect of semantic queries is that the type of the relationship can be used to incorporate intelligence into the system. The relationship between a customer and a product has a fundamentally different nature than the relationship between a neighbourhood and its city. The latter enables the semantic query engine to ''infer'' that a customer ''living in Manhattan is also living in New York City'' whereas other relationships might have more complicated patterns and \"contextual analytics\". This process is called inference or reasoning and is the ability of the software to derive new information based on given facts.\n\n== Articles ==\n\n* {{Cite web\n| last =  Velez\n| first = Golda\n| year = 2008\n| url = http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/data-management/semantics-help-wall-street-cope-with-data-overload/d/d-id/1259662.html\n| title = Semantics Help Wall Street Cope With Data Overload\n| publisher = wallstreetandtech.com\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n| last =  Zhifeng\n| first = Xiao\n| year = 2009\n| url = https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/7492/1/Spatial-information-semantic-query-based-on-SPARQL/10.1117/12.838556.short?SSO=1\n| bibcode = 2009SPIE.7492E..60X\n| title = Spatial information semantic query based on SPARQL\n| publisher = International Symposium on Spatial Analysis\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n| last = Aquin\n| first = Mathieu\n| year = 2010\n| url = http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj96_1.pdf\n| title = Watson, more than a Semantic Web search engine\n| publisher = Semantic Web Journal\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n| last = Dworetzky\n| first = Tom\n| year = 2011\n| url = http://www.ibtimes.com/how-siri-works-iphones-brain-comes-natural-language-processing-stanford-professors-teach-free-online\n| title = How Siri Works: iPhone's 'Brain' Comes from Natural Language Processing\n| publisher = International Business Times\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n| last =  Horwitt\n| first = Elisabeth\n| year = 2011\n| url = http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9209118/The_semantic_Web_gets_down_to_businessarticleID=208700210&pgno=2\n| title = The semantic Web gets down to business\n| publisher = computerworld.com\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n| last = Rodriguez\n| first = Marko\n| year = 2011\n| url = http://markorodriguez.com/2011/06/15/graph-pattern-matching-with-gremlin-1-1/\n| title = Graph Pattern Matching with Gremlin\n| publisher = markorodriguez.com on Graph Computing\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n| last = Sequeda\n| first = Juan\n| year = 2011\n| url = http://www.cambridgesemantics.com/semantic-university/sparql-nuts-and-bolts\n| title = SPARQL Nuts & Bolts\n| publisher = Cambridge Semantics\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n| last = Freitas\n| first = Andre\n| year = 2012\n| url = https://www.deri.ie/sites/default/files/publications/freitas_ic_12.pdf\n| title = Querying Heterogeneous Datasets on the Linked Data Web\n| publisher = IEEE Internet Computing\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n| last = Kauppinen\n| first = Tomi\n| year = 2012\n| url = http://linkedscience.org/tools/sparql-package-for-r/tutorial-on-sparql-package-for-r/\n| title = Using the SPARQL Package in R to handle Spatial Linked Data\n| publisher = linkedscience.org\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n| last = Lorentz\n| first = Alissa\n| year = 2013\n| url = https://www.wired.com/2013/04/with-big-data-context-is-a-big-issue/\n| title = With Big Data, Context is a Big Issue\n| publisher = Wired\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Attention]]\n* [[Dataspaces]]\n* [[Knowledge Representation]]\n* [[Linked Data]]\n* [[Ontology alignment]]\n* [[Philosophy]]\n* [[Semantic Integration]]\n* [[Semantic publishing]]\n* [[Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules]]\n* [[SPARQL]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/query W3C Semantic Web Standards - Query]\n\n[[Category:Data management]]\n[[Category:Query languages]]\n[[Category:Semantic Web]]\n", "text_old": "'''Semantic queries''' allow for queries and analytics of associative and [[Contextualization (computer science)|contextual]] nature.

This is in contrast to [[semantic search]], which uses [[semantics]] (the science of meaning) in [[Unstructured data|unstructured text]] to produce a better search result. (See [[natural language processing]].)\n\nFrom a technical point of view, semantic queries are precise relational-type operations much like a [[SQL|database query]]. They work on structured data and therefore have the possibility to utilize comprehensive features like operators (e.g. >, < and =), namespaces, [[pattern matching]], [[Type inheritance|subclassing]], [[transitive relation]]s, [[Semantic Web Rule Language|semantic rules]] and contextual [[Full-text index|full text search]]. The [[semantic web]] technology stack of the [[W3C]] is offering [[SPARQL]]<ref name=\"XML.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/11/16/introducing-sparql-querying-semantic-web-tutorial.html |title=Introducing SPARQL: Querying the Semantic Web |publisher=XML.com|date=2005}}</ref><ref name=\"W3C\">{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query |title=SPARQL Query Language for RDF |publisher=W3C|date=2008}}</ref> to formulate semantic queries in a syntax similar to [[SQL]]. Semantic queries are used in [[triplestore]]s, [[graph databases]], [[semantic wiki]]s, natural language and artificial intelligence systems.\n\n== Background ==\n\n[[Relational database]]s represent all relationships between data in an ''implicit'' manner only.<ref name=\"ACM-DL\">{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1646157 |title=Semantic queries in databases: problems and challenges |publisher=ACM Digital Library|date=2009}}</ref><ref name=\"ESWC\">{{cite web|url=http://2012.eswc-conferences.org/sites/default/files/eswc2012_submission_357.pdf |title=Karma: A System for Mapping Structured Sources into the Semantic Web |publisher=eswc-conferences.org|date=2012}}</ref> For example, the relationships between customers and products (stored in two content-tables and connected with an additional link-table) only come into existence in a query statement ([[SQL]] in the case of relational databases) written by a developer. Writing the query demands exact knowledge of the [[database schema]].<ref name=\"IEEE\">{{cite web|url=http://www-scf.usc.edu/~taheriya/papers/taheriyan14-icsc-paper.pdf |title=A Scalable Approach to Learn Semantic Models of Structured Sources |publisher=8th IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing|date=2014}}</ref><ref name=\"AAAI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.isi.edu/integration/papers/knoblock13-sbd.pdf |title=Semantics for Big Data Integration and Analysis |publisher=AAAI Fall Symposium on Semantics for Big Data|date=2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Linked Data|Linked-Data]] represent all relationships between data in an ''explicit'' manner. In the above example no query code needs to be written. The correct product for each customer can be fetched automatically. Whereas this simple example is trivial, the real power of linked-data comes into play when a ''network of information'' is created (customers with their geo-spatial information like city, state and country; products with their categories within sub- and super-categories). Now the system can automatically answer more complex queries and analytics that look for the connection of a particular location with a product category. The development effort for this query is omitted. Executing a semantic query is conducted by ''walking'' the network of information and finding matches (also called ''Data Graph Traversal'').\n\nAnother important aspect of semantic queries is that the type of the relationship can be used to incorporate intelligence into the system. The relationship between a customer and a product has a fundamentally different nature than the relationship between a neighbourhood and its city. The latter enables the semantic query engine to ''infer'' that a customer ''living in Manhattan is also living in New York City'' whereas other relationships might have more complicated patterns and \"contextual analytics\". This process is called inference or reasoning and is the ability of the software to derive new information based on given facts.\n\n== Articles ==\n\n* {{Cite web\n| last =  Velez\n| first = Golda\n| year = 2008\n| url = http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/data-management/semantics-help-wall-street-cope-with-data-overload/d/d-id/1259662.html\n| title = Semantics Help Wall Street Cope With Data Overload\n| publisher = wallstreetandtech.com\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n| last =  Zhifeng\n| first = Xiao\n| year = 2009\n| url = https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/7492/1/Spatial-information-semantic-query-based-on-SPARQL/10.1117/12.838556.short?SSO=1\n| bibcode = 2009SPIE.7492E..60X\n| title = Spatial information semantic query based on SPARQL\n| publisher = International Symposium on Spatial Analysis\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n| last = Aquin\n| first = Mathieu\n| year = 2010\n| url = http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj96_1.pdf\n| title = Watson, more than a Semantic Web search engine\n| publisher = Semantic Web Journal\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n| last = Dworetzky\n| first = Tom\n| year = 2011\n| url = http://www.ibtimes.com/how-siri-works-iphones-brain-comes-natural-language-processing-stanford-professors-teach-free-online\n| title = How Siri Works: iPhone's 'Brain' Comes from Natural Language Processing\n| publisher = International Business Times\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n| last =  Horwitt\n| first = Elisabeth\n| year = 2011\n| url = http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9209118/The_semantic_Web_gets_down_to_businessarticleID=208700210&pgno=2\n| title = The semantic Web gets down to business\n| publisher = computerworld.com\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n| last = Rodriguez\n| first = Marko\n| year = 2011\n| url = http://markorodriguez.com/2011/06/15/graph-pattern-matching-with-gremlin-1-1/\n| title = Graph Pattern Matching with Gremlin\n| publisher = markorodriguez.com on Graph Computing\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n| last = Sequeda\n| first = Juan\n| year = 2011\n| url = http://www.cambridgesemantics.com/semantic-university/sparql-nuts-and-bolts\n| title = SPARQL Nuts & Bolts\n| publisher = Cambridge Semantics\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n| last = Freitas\n| first = Andre\n| year = 2012\n| url = https://www.deri.ie/sites/default/files/publications/freitas_ic_12.pdf\n| title = Querying Heterogeneous Datasets on the Linked Data Web\n| publisher = IEEE Internet Computing\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n| last = Kauppinen\n| first = Tomi\n| year = 2012\n| url = http://linkedscience.org/tools/sparql-package-for-r/tutorial-on-sparql-package-for-r/\n| title = Using the SPARQL Package in R to handle Spatial Linked Data\n| publisher = linkedscience.org\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n| last = Lorentz\n| first = Alissa\n| year = 2013\n| url = https://www.wired.com/2013/04/with-big-data-context-is-a-big-issue/\n| title = With Big Data, Context is a Big Issue\n| publisher = Wired\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Attention]]\n* [[Dataspaces]]\n* [[Knowledge Representation]]\n* [[Linked Data]]\n* [[Ontology alignment]]\n* [[Philosophy]]\n* [[Semantic Integration]]\n* [[Semantic publishing]]\n* [[Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules]]\n* [[SPARQL]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/query W3C Semantic Web Standards - Query]\n\n[[Category:Data management]]\n[[Category:Query languages]]\n[[Category:Semantic Web]]\n", "name_user": "Hooman Mallahzadeh", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBackground", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_query"}

Users can purchase and download ebooks and [[audiobook]]s from [[Google Play]], which offers over five million titles, with Google claiming it to be the \"largest ebooks collection in the world\". Books can be read on a dedicated Books section on the Google Play website, through the use of a [[mobile app]] available for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]], through the use of select [[e-reader]]s that offer support for [[Adobe Digital Editions]], through a web browser and reading via [[Google Home]]. Users may also upload up to 1,000 ebooks in the [[PDF]] or [[EPUB]] file formats. Google Play Books is available in 75 countries.\n\nGoogle Play Books was launched in December 2010, with a reseller program letting independent booksellers sell Google ebooks on their websites for a cut of sales. It also launched an [[affiliate program]] in June 2011, allowing website owners to earn a commission by referring sales to the then-named Google eBookstore. However, the reseller program ended in April 2012, with Google stating that it had \"not gained the traction that we hoped it would\" and \"not met the needs of many readers or booksellers\". The affiliate program closed for new signups in February 2012, with Google announcing that it would scale down the initiative, making it private and invitation-only.\n\nThe mobile Android app has seen several significant updates since its introduction, including different reading modes with color contrasts, support for text highlighting and note-taking, a zoomed-out view with easy page sliding in an effort to improve reading experiences for books not read cover-to-cover, a vertical scrolling mode for [[comic book]]s, a \"Night Light\" feature that gradually filters blue light to reduce eye strain after sunset, using [[machine learning]] imaging technologies to expand [[speech bubble]]s in comics, and listening to audiobooks.\n\nThe Play Books store has been noted to hold a lot of pirated content, which led Google to discontinue new sign-ups to its publisher program in 2015. The program was reopened only in 2018 when it incorporated an automated process to decline books found to contain extensive text copied from other books already in the store.\n\n== History ==\nThe history may or may not be of Google Play Books can be traced to the Google eBooks service offered by Google before the Google Play brand came into existence.

Clancy also stressed that Google's ebooks would be readable on any device, indicating the open nature of the platform.

Despite that, Miller found it interesting that public domain titles had functionality to view them either as a \"scanned version - with the original type, page numbering and even library stamps and [[marginalia]], basically photographs of the printed pages\" and also as \"searchable \"flowing text,\" rendered by [[optical character recognition]]\". Miller also wrote that the eBookstore was not easy to search, \"an irony considering that the Google empire was built on search\". She criticized the [[user interface]] for being \"poor\" and seemingly \"devised by people who know next to nothing about the book trade\". She praised Google's decision to incorporate reader reviews from [[Goodreads]], writing that it \"helps, as these are often more thoughtful than the average [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] reader review\", though again criticizing the \"related books\" section for bad suggestions. She also praised that Google had formed partnerships with independent bookstores, writing that it is \"a great way to support neighborhood bookstores and it also allows Google eBookstore customers to partake of the expertise of people whose life's work is connecting readers with the right books.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=Laura |last=Miller |title=Is Google leading an e-book revolution? |url=http://www.salon.com/2010/12/08/google_ebookstore/ |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=December 8, 2010 |accessdate=February 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn a May 2014 review, Riley Dennis of ''MakeUseOf'' wrote that \"Google Play has been expanding its reach to all forms of media recently, and Play Books is one section that has noticeably improved and is now a genuine contender to the eReading competition\". Dennis praised the ability to upload personal ebooks in addition to buying them, writing that it makes Play Books \"a great universal eReader\". Furthermore, he complimented the mobile Android app, writing that \"Play Books is a delight to read on, from the refreshingly simple interface to the customizable and smooth reading experience\", and that the page-turning animation was \"delightful\", \"realistic\" and \"smooth\". While writing about different forms of customization options available, he noted that \"the margins can't be changed\", and also criticized the website interface for lacking several features that were present in the mobile app. Dennis concluded his review by writing: \"Play Books is a solid eReading app, but it still has room for growth.\"<ref name=\"MakeUseOf review\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Google Inc.}}\n{{Ebooks}}\n\n[[Category:Google software|Play Books]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:Google Chrome apps|Play Books]]\n[[Category:EPUB readers]]\n[[Category:2010 software]]\n[[Category:E-book sources]]\n[[Category:Google Play|Books]]\n[[Category:Textbook business]]\n[[Category:Book rental]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Digital distribution service for ebooks}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2018}}\n{{Use American English|date=February 2015}}\n{{Infobox software\n| name                   = Google Play Books \n| logo                   = Google Play Books icon (2016).svg\n| screenshot             = [[File:Play Books iOS.png|200px]]\n| caption                = Google Play Books on [[iOS]]\n| developer              = [[Google]]\n| released               = {{Start date and age|2010|12|06}} (as Google eBooks)\n| ver layout             = stacked\n| platform               = [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], [[Google Chrome Apps|Chrome]], [[Web application|web]]\n| genre                  = [[Digital distribution]]\n| website                = {{URL|https://play.google.com/books}}\n}}\n\n'''Google Play Books''', formerly '''Google eBooks''', is an [[ebook]] [[digital distribution]] service operated by [[Google]], part of its [[Google Play]] product line. Users can purchase and download ebooks and [[audiobook]]s from [[Google Play]], which offers over five million titles, with Google claiming it to be the \"largest ebooks collection in the world\". Books can be read on a dedicated Books section on the Google Play website, through the use of a [[mobile app]] available for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]], through the use of select [[e-reader]]s that offer support for [[Adobe Digital Editions]], through a web browser and reading via [[Google Home]]. Users may also upload up to 1,000 ebooks in the [[PDF]] or [[EPUB]] file formats. Google Play Books is available in 75 countries.\n\nGoogle Play Books was launched in December 2010, with a reseller program letting independent booksellers sell Google ebooks on their websites for a cut of sales. It also launched an [[affiliate program]] in June 2011, allowing website owners to earn a commission by referring sales to the then-named Google eBookstore. However, the reseller program ended in April 2012, with Google stating that it had \"not gained the traction that we hoped it would\" and \"not met the needs of many readers or booksellers\". The affiliate program closed for new signups in February 2012, with Google announcing that it would scale down the initiative, making it private and invitation-only.\n\nThe mobile Android app has seen several significant updates since its introduction, including different reading modes with color contrasts, support for text highlighting and note-taking, a zoomed-out view with easy page sliding in an effort to improve reading experiences for books not read cover-to-cover, a vertical scrolling mode for [[comic book]]s, a \"Night Light\" feature that gradually filters blue light to reduce eye strain after sunset, using [[machine learning]] imaging technologies to expand [[speech bubble]]s in comics, and listening to audiobooks.\n\nThe Play Books store has been noted to hold a lot of pirated content, which led Google to discontinue new sign-ups to its publisher program in 2015. The program was reopened only in 2018 when it incorporated an automated process to decline books found to contain extensive text copied from other books already in the store.\n\n== History ==\nThe history of Google Play Books can be traced to the Google eBooks service offered by Google before the Google Play brand came into existence.

Clancy also stressed that Google's ebooks would be readable on any device, indicating the open nature of the platform. It would also make ebooks available for bookstores to sell, giving \"the vast majority\" of revenues to the store.

Miller also wrote that the eBookstore was not easy to search, \"an irony considering that the Google empire was built on search\". She criticized the [[user interface]] for being \"poor\" and seemingly \"devised by people who know next to nothing about the book trade\". She praised Google's decision to incorporate reader reviews from [[Goodreads]], writing that it \"helps, as these are often more thoughtful than the average [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] reader review\", though again criticizing the \"related books\" section for bad suggestions.

While writing about different forms of customization options available, he noted that \"the margins can't be changed\", and also criticized the website interface for lacking several features that were present in the mobile app. Dennis concluded his review by writing: \"Play Books is a solid eReading app, but it still has room for growth.\"<ref name=\"MakeUseOf review\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Google Inc.}}\n{{Ebooks}}\n\n[[Category:Google software|Play Books]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:Google Chrome apps|Play Books]]\n[[Category:EPUB readers]]\n[[Category:2010 software]]\n[[Category:E-book sources]]\n[[Category:Google Play|Books]]\n[[Category:Textbook business]]\n[[Category:Book rental]]\n", "name_user": "103.219.205.245", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play_Books"}
