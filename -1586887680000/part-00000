Zanuck]]. The screenplay by [[Ernest Lehman]] is based on the [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] musical ''[[The King and I]]'', based in turn on the novel ''[[Anna and the King of Siam (novel)|Anna and the King of Siam]]'' by [[Margaret Landon]]. That novel in turn was based on memoirs written by [[Anna Leonowens]], who became school teacher to the children of King [[Mongkut]] of [[Thailand|Siam]] in the early 1860s. Leonowens' stories were autobiographical, although various elements of them have been called into question.<ref>Susan Morgan, ''Bombay Anna: The Real Story and Remarkable Adventures of the King and I Governess'' (University of California Press, 2008)</ref> The film stars [[Deborah Kerr]] and [[Yul Brynner]].\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success, and was nominated for 9 [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], winning 5, including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Brynner.\n\nAnother film adaptation of the same musical, the animated film ''[[The King and I (1999 film)|The King and I]]'', was released in 1999.\n\n==Plot==\n\nA widowed  schoolteacher, [[Anna Leonowens|Anna]], rrives in Bangkok with her young son Louis after being summoned to tutor the many children of King [[Mongkut]]. The two are introduced to the intimidating Kralahome, Siam's prime minister, who escorts them to the Royal Palace where they will live, although Anna had been promised her own house. The King ignores her objections and introduces her to his head wife, Lady Thiang. Anna also meets a recent [[concubine]], a young Burmese named Tuptim, as well as the fifteen children she will tutor, including his son and heir [[Chulalongkorn|Prince Chulalongkorn]]. In conversation with the other wives, Anna learns that Tuptim is in love with the man, Lun Tha, who brought her to Siam.\n\nAnna still wants her own house and teaches the children about the virtues of home life, to the irritation of the King, who disapproves of the influence of other cultures. She comes across Lun Tha and learns that he has been meeting Tuptim in secret. He asks her to arrange a rendezvous. The lovers meet under cover of darkness and Lun Tha promises he will one day return to Siam and they will escape together. \n\nKing Mongkut becomes troubled over rumors that the British regard him as a barbaric leader, and are sending a delegation, including Anna\u2019s old lover, Sir Edward, possibly in order to turn Siam into a protectorate. Anna persuades the King to receive them in European style by hosting a banquet with European food and music. In return, the King promises to give Anna her own house. Sir Edward reminisces with Anna in an attempt to bring her back to British society. The King presents Tuptim's version of Uncle Tom's Cabin as a traditional Siamese ballet. However, the King and the Kralahome are not impressed, as the play involves slavery and shows the slaveholding King drowning in the river. During the show, Tuptim has left the room to run away with Lun Tha.\n\nAfter the guests have departed, the king reveals that Tuptim is missing. Anna explains that Tuptim is unhappy because she is just another woman in his eyes. The King retorts that men are entitled to a plenitude of wives although women must remain faithful. Anna explains the reality of one man loving only one woman and recalls her first dance before teaching the King how to dance the polka, but the touching moment is shattered when the Kralahome bursts into the room with news that Tuptim has been captured. For her dishonor, the King prepares to whip her despite Anna's pleas. She implies that he is indeed a barbarian. The King then crumples, puts his hand over his heart and runs out of the room. The Kralahome blames Anna for ruining him. Tuptim meanwhile is led away in tears when she learns that Lun Tha is dead. This causes Anna to sever all ties as a governess and declare that she will leave on the next boat from Siam.\n\nOn the night of her departure, Anna learns that the King is dying. Lady Thiang gives Anna his unfinished letter, stating his deep gratitude and respect for her, despite their differences. Moments before the ship departs, he gives Anna his ring, as she has always spoken the truth to him, persuading her and Louis to stay in Bangkok. He passes his title to Prince Chulalongkorn, who then issues a proclamation that brings an end to slavery and states that all subjects will no longer bow down to him. The King dies, satisfied that he is leaving his kingdom in capable hands.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Deborah Kerr]] as [[Anna Leonowens]]\n*[[Yul Brynner]] as [[Mongkut|King Mongkut of Siam]]\n*[[Rita Moreno]] as  Tuptim\n*[[Terry Saunders]] as Lady Thiang\n*[[Martin Benson (actor)|Martin Benson]] as Kralahome\n*Rex Thompson  as [[Louis T.

However, she was diagnosed with cancer while playing the role on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and died during the run. [[Dinah Shore]], a singer as well as an actress, was considered for the role of Anna in the movie. [[Maureen O'Hara]], who had a pleasant [[soprano]] voice, was originally cast, but [[Richard Rodgers]] did not agree to the casting. It was [[Yul Brynner]] who pressed for [[Deborah Kerr]] to play the role. [[Marni Nixon]] provided Kerr's singing for the film.<ref name=\"rodgers\"/> Nixon and Kerr worked side-by-side in the recording studio for songs which combined speaking and singing. Nixon would also dub Kerr's singing the following year, for the film ''[[An Affair to Remember]]''.\n\nDonald Bogle's biography of [[Dorothy Dandridge]] claims that Dandridge was offered the role of Tuptim in partial fulfillment of her three-picture contract with [[20th Century-Fox]], but that Dandridge allowed [[Otto Preminger]] (her former director and then-lover) to talk her out of it because it was not the lead role. Rumors also circulated that Dandridge, as an [[African American]], did not want to play a slave. [[Rita Moreno]], who was under contract to Fox, was invited merely for a test, but impressed the producers enough to be selected for the part.<ref name=\"dvd50th\">Carlos Rivas (interview). ''The King and I: 50th Anniversary Edition'' DVD, disc 2 special features, 2006.</ref> Moreno later stated in an interview that [[France Nuyen]] was also up for the part, and Moreno believed Nuyen would get it, but since Nuyen was not a contract player with the studio, she was not cast.\n\nReprising their Broadway stage roles, Saunders played Thiang, Adiarte was Chulalongkorn and Benson was the Kralahome, and dancers Yuriko and de Lappe also reprised their stage roles. [[Alan Mowbray]] appeared in the new role of the British Ambassador, while Sir Edward Ramsey (demoted to the Ambassador's aide) was played by [[Geoffrey Toone]].<ref>Hischak, p. 151</ref><ref name=NYTimes56>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/27374/The-King-and-I/credits \"''The King and I'' (1956): Production credits\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104061802/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/27374/The-King-and-I/credits |date=2012-11-04 }}, ''[[The New York Times]]''.

In the film, the first half of the \"Song of the King\" was turned into ordinary spoken dialogue, with only some of the words sung, minus the king's opening lyrics, but it survives as it was actually written on the soundtrack album.\n\nA special 50th Anniversary edition was released in 2006, which promised to restore the lost numbers, but it included only the audio and some still photographs for \"Shall I Tell You?\"  This would seem to indicate that no footage exists of these numbers. An off-screen choral reprise of \"Something Wonderful\" was added to serve as the film's finale; the stage version ends with musical underscoring, but no singing. None of the other reprises of the songs were retained in the film version.\n\nThe film was one of the only two films shot in the then-new 55&nbsp;mm [[CinemaScope 55]] format, the other being ''[[Carousel (film)|Carousel]]'', which was released several months earlier. Although the promotion for the film made much of it being shot in CinemaScope 55, it was only released in the standard 35&nbsp;mm [[CinemaScope]] format, with 4-channel stereo instead of the 6-channel stereo originally promised. CinemaScope 55 was never used or promoted again after this production, and Fox would later invest in Todd-AO and adopt its 65/70mm process, after changing it to the more conventional 24 frames/second, and contracting with [[Mitchell Camera]] for all-new FC (\"Fox Camera\") and BFC (\"Blimped Fox Camera\") cameras, and with [[Bausch & Lomb]] for all-new \"Super Baltar\" lenses. Numerous features were made in the Fox-revised Todd-AO process.\n\nIn 1961, it was re-released for the first time in a [[70mm film|70&nbsp;mm]] format, under Fox's \"Grandeur 70\" trademark.<ref name=\"imdb.com\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049408/releaseinfo |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318135802/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049408/releaseinfo |archive-date=2017-03-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> For this release, the six-channel version of the stereo soundtrack was finally used.

It restored three songs recorded for the film but not included in the final release print: \"My Lord and Master\", \"I Have Dreamed\", and \"Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?\". Added to the original LP and CD releases of the film was a seven-minute overture not heard at the beginning of the film. The album was first issued only in mono in 1956, but, as with the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] films ''[[Oklahoma! (1955 film)|Oklahoma]]'' (1955) and ''[[Carousel (1956 film)|Carousel]]'' (1956), the sound on the film had been recorded in what was then [[state-of-the-art]] stereo, which made it possible, with the advent of stereo on records, for Capitol to release a stereo version of the soundtrack album in 1958. As with ''Oklahoma!'' and ''Carousel'', the recording lathes of that time made it necessary for part of the album to be omitted in the stereo version, so half of \"Getting To Know You\" was cut in that edition, which included the instrumental section, and the other half of the children singing the other half of the song in the different key of music.

Zanuck]]. The screenplay by [[Ernest Lehman]] is based on the [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] musical ''[[The King and I]]'', based in turn on the novel ''[[Anna and the King of Siam (novel)|Anna and the King of Siam]]'' by [[Margaret Landon]]. That novel in turn was based on memoirs written by [[Anna Leonowens]], who became school teacher to the children of King [[Mongkut]] of [[Thailand|Siam]] in the early 1860s. Leonowens' stories were autobiographical, although various elements of them have been called into question.<ref>Susan Morgan, ''Bombay Anna: The Real Story and Remarkable Adventures of the King and I Governess'' (University of California Press, 2008)</ref> The film stars [[Deborah Kerr]] and [[Yul Brynner]].\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success, and was nominated for 9 [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], winning 5, including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Brynner.\n\nAnother film adaptation of the same musical, the animated film ''[[The King and I (1999 film)|The King and I]]'', was released in 1999.\n\n==Plot==\n\nA widowed  schoolteacher, [[Anna Leonowens|Anna]], arrives in Bangkok with her young son Louis after being summoned to tutor the many children of King [[Mongkut]]. The two are introduced to the intimidating Kralahome, Siam's prime minister, who escorts them to the Royal Palace where they will live, although Anna had been promised her own house. The King ignores her objections and introduces her to his head wife, Lady Thiang. Anna also meets a recent [[concubine]], a young Burmese named Tuptim, as well as the fifteen children she will tutor, including his son and heir [[Chulalongkorn|Prince Chulalongkorn]]. In conversation with the other wives, Anna learns that Tuptim is in love with the man, Lun Tha, who brought her to Siam.\n\nAnna still wants her own house and teaches the children about the virtues of home life, to the irritation of the King, who disapproves of the influence of other cultures. She comes across Lun Tha and learns that he has been meeting Tuptim in secret. He asks her to arrange a rendezvous. The lovers meet under cover of darkness and Lun Tha promises he will one day return to Siam and they will escape together. \n\nKing Mongkut becomes troubled over rumors that the British regard him as a barbaric leader, and are sending a delegation, including Anna\u2019s old lover, Sir Edward, possibly in order to turn Siam into a protectorate. Anna persuades the King to receive them in European style by hosting a banquet with European food and music. In return, the King promises to give Anna her own house. Sir Edward reminisces with Anna in an attempt to bring her back to British society. The King presents Tuptim's version of Uncle Tom's Cabin as a traditional Siamese ballet. However, the King and the Kralahome are not impressed, as the play involves slavery and shows the slaveholding King drowning in the river. During the show, Tuptim has left the room to run away with Lun Tha.\n\nAfter the guests have departed, the king reveals that Tuptim is missing. Anna explains that Tuptim is unhappy because she is just another woman in his eyes. The King retorts that men are entitled to a plenitude of wives although women must remain faithful. Anna explains the reality of one man loving only one woman and recalls her first dance before teaching the King how to dance the polka, but the touching moment is shattered when the Kralahome bursts into the room with news that Tuptim has been captured. For her dishonor, the King prepares to whip her despite Anna's pleas. She implies that he is indeed a barbarian. The King then crumples, puts his hand over his heart and runs out of the room. The Kralahome blames Anna for ruining him. Tuptim meanwhile is led away in tears when she learns that Lun Tha is dead. This causes Anna to sever all ties as a governess and declare that she will leave on the next boat from Siam.\n\nOn the night of her departure, Anna learns that the King is dying. Lady Thiang gives Anna his unfinished letter, stating his deep gratitude and respect for her, despite their differences. Moments before the ship departs, he gives Anna his ring, as she has always spoken the truth to him, persuading her and Louis to stay in Bangkok. He passes his title to Prince Chulalongkorn, who then issues a proclamation that brings an end to slavery and states that all subjects will no longer bow down to him. The King dies, satisfied that he is leaving his kingdom in capable hands.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Deborah Kerr]] as [[Anna Leonowens]]\n*[[Yul Brynner]] as [[Mongkut|King Mongkut of Siam]]\n*[[Rita Moreno]] as  Tuptim\n*[[Terry Saunders]] as Lady Thiang\n*[[Martin Benson (actor)|Martin Benson]] as Kralahome\n*Rex Thompson  as [[Louis T.

However, she was diagnosed with cancer while playing the role on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and died during the run. [[Dinah Shore]], a singer as well as an actress, was considered for the role of Anna in the movie. [[Maureen O'Hara]], who had a pleasant [[soprano]] voice, was originally cast, but [[Richard Rodgers]] did not agree to the casting. It was [[Yul Brynner]] who pressed for [[Deborah Kerr]] to play the role. [[Marni Nixon]] provided Kerr's singing for the film.<ref name=\"rodgers\"/> Nixon and Kerr worked side-by-side in the recording studio for songs which combined speaking and singing. Nixon would also dub Kerr's singing the following year, for the film ''[[An Affair to Remember]]''.\n\nDonald Bogle's biography of [[Dorothy Dandridge]] claims that Dandridge was offered the role of Tuptim in partial fulfillment of her three-picture contract with [[20th Century-Fox]], but that Dandridge allowed [[Otto Preminger]] (her former director and then-lover) to talk her out of it because it was not the lead role. Rumors also circulated that Dandridge, as an [[African American]], did not want to play a slave. [[Rita Moreno]], who was under contract to Fox, was invited merely for a test, but impressed the producers enough to be selected for the part.<ref name=\"dvd50th\">Carlos Rivas (interview). ''The King and I: 50th Anniversary Edition'' DVD, disc 2 special features, 2006.</ref> Moreno later stated in an interview that [[France Nuyen]] was also up for the part, and Moreno believed Nuyen would get it, but since Nuyen was not a contract player with the studio, she was not cast.\n\nReprising their Broadway stage roles, Saunders played Thiang, Adiarte was Chulalongkorn and Benson was the Kralahome, and dancers Yuriko and de Lappe also reprised their stage roles. [[Alan Mowbray]] appeared in the new role of the British Ambassador, while Sir Edward Ramsey (demoted to the Ambassador's aide) was played by [[Geoffrey Toone]].<ref>Hischak, p. 151</ref><ref name=NYTimes56>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/27374/The-King-and-I/credits \"''The King and I'' (1956): Production credits\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104061802/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/27374/The-King-and-I/credits |date=2012-11-04 }}, ''[[The New York Times]]''.

In the film, the first half of the \"Song of the King\" was turned into ordinary spoken dialogue, with only some of the words sung, minus the king's opening lyrics, but it survives as it was actually written on the soundtrack album.\n\nA special 50th Anniversary edition was released in 2006, which promised to restore the lost numbers, but it included only the audio and some still photographs for \"Shall I Tell You?\"  This would seem to indicate that no footage exists of these numbers. An off-screen choral reprise of \"Something Wonderful\" was added to serve as the film's finale; the stage version ends with musical underscoring, but no singing. None of the other reprises of the songs were retained in the film version.\n\nThe film was one of the only two films shot in the then-new 55&nbsp;mm [[CinemaScope 55]] format, the other being ''[[Carousel (film)|Carousel]]'', which was released several months earlier. Although the promotion for the film made much of it being shot in CinemaScope 55, it was only released in the standard 35&nbsp;mm [[CinemaScope]] format, with 4-channel stereo instead of the 6-channel stereo originally promised. CinemaScope 55 was never used or promoted again after this production, and Fox would later invest in Todd-AO and adopt its 65/70mm process, after changing it to the more conventional 24 frames/second, and contracting with [[Mitchell Camera]] for all-new FC (\"Fox Camera\") and BFC (\"Blimped Fox Camera\") cameras, and with [[Bausch & Lomb]] for all-new \"Super Baltar\" lenses. Numerous features were made in the Fox-revised Todd-AO process.\n\nIn 1961, it was re-released for the first time in a [[70mm film|70&nbsp;mm]] format, under Fox's \"Grandeur 70\" trademark.<ref name=\"imdb.com\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049408/releaseinfo |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318135802/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049408/releaseinfo |archive-date=2017-03-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> For this release, the six-channel version of the stereo soundtrack was finally used.

It restored three songs recorded for the film but not included in the final release print: \"My Lord and Master\", \"I Have Dreamed\", and \"Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?\". Added to the original LP and CD releases of the film was a seven-minute overture not heard at the beginning of the film. The album was first issued only in mono in 1956, but, as with the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] films ''[[Oklahoma!

As with ''Oklahoma!'' and ''Carousel'', the recording lathes of that time made it necessary for part of the album to be omitted in the stereo version, so half of \"Getting To Know You\" was cut in that edition, which included the instrumental section, and the other half of the children singing the other half of the song in the different key of music. All of the songs were arranged by [[Gus Levene]].<ref name=\"Ornish2011\">{{cite book|last=Ornish|first=Natalie|title=Pioneer Jewish Texans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7kiMNQ-O5_IC&pg=PA232|date=1 September 2011|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|isbn=978-1-60344-433-0|page=232|access-date=16 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208055725/https://books.google.com/books?id=7kiMNQ-O5_IC&pg=PA232|archive-date=8 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe film soundtrack album of ''The King and I'' was issued on CD first by Capitol and then by [[Angel Records]].

Cyprian's biographer, [[Pontius of Carthage]], wrote of the plague at [[Carthage]]:\n<blockquote>\nAfterwards there broke out a dreadful plague, and excessive destruction of a hateful disease invaded every house in succession of the trembling populace, carrying off day by day with abrupt attack numberless people, every one from his own house. All were shuddering, fleeing, shunning the contagion, impiously exposing their own friends, as if with the exclusion of the person who was sure to die of the plague, one could exclude death itself also. There lay about the meanwhile, over the whole city, no longer bodies, but the carcasses of many, and, by the contemplation of a lot which in their turn would be theirs, demanded the pity of the passers-by for themselves. No one regarded anything besides his cruel gains. No one trembled at the remembrance of a similar event. No one did to another what he himself wished to experience.<ref>[[Pontius of Carthage]], ''Life of Cyprian''. Transl. Ernest Wallis, c. 1885. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf05.iv.iii.html Online at ''Christian Classics Ethereal Library''].</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn Carthage, the \"[[Decian Persecution]]\", unleashed at the onset of the plague, perhaps inadvertently led to the criminalization of Christians' refusal to take an oath. Fifty years later, a [[North African]] convert to [[Christianity]], [[Arnobius]], defended his new religion from pagan allegations:\n\n<blockquote>that a plague was brought upon the earth after the Christian religion came into the world, and after it revealed the mysteries of hidden truth? But pestilences, say my opponents, and droughts, wars, famines, locusts, mice, and hailstones, and other hurtful things, by which the property of men is assailed, the gods bring upon us, incensed as they are by your wrong-doings and by your transgressions.<ref>[[Arnobius]], ''Adversus Gentes'' 1.3. Translated by Hamilton Bryce and Hugh Campbell, c. 1885. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06.xii.iii.i.iii.html Online at ''Christian Classics Ethereal Library''].</ref></blockquote>\n\nCyprian drew moralizing analogies in his sermons to the Christian community and drew a word picture of the plague's symptoms in his essay ''De mortalitate'' (\"On the Plague\"):\n\n<blockquote>This trial, that now the bowels, relaxed into a constant flux, discharge the bodily strength; that a fire originated in the marrow ferments into wounds of the [[isthmus of the fauces|fauces]]; that the intestines are shaken with a continual vomiting; that the eyes are on fire with the injected blood; that in some cases the feet or some parts of the limbs are taken off by the contagion of diseased putrefaction; that from the weakness arising by the maiming and loss of the body, either the gait is enfeebled, or the hearing is obstructed, or the sight darkened;\u2014is profitable as a proof of faith. What a grandeur of spirit it is to struggle with all the powers of an unshaken mind against so many onsets of devastation and death! what sublimity, to stand erect amid the desolation of the human race, and not to lie prostrate with those who have no hope in [[God]]; but rather to rejoice, and to embrace the benefit of the occasion; that in thus bravely showing forth our faith, and by suffering endured, going forward to [[Christ]] by the narrow way that Christ trod, we may receive the reward of His life and faith according to His own judgment!<ref>Cyprian, ''De Mortalitate''. Transl. Ernest Wallis, c. 1885. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf05.iv.v.vii.html Online at ''Christian Classics Ethereal Library''].</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccounts of the plague date about from AD 249 to 262.<ref name=harperCh4/> There was a later incident in 270 that involved the death of [[Claudius II Gothicus]], but it is unknown if this was the same plague or a different outbreak.<ref name=harperCh4>{{cite book |title=The Fate of Rome: Climate, Disease, and the End of an Empire |publisher=Princeton University Press |author=Kyle Harper |year=2017 |page= |chapter=Chapter 4: The Old Age of the World |isbn=978-0691166834}}</ref> According to the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', \"in the consulship of [[Flavius Antiochianus|Antiochianus]] and [[Virius Orfitus|Orfitus]]<ref>AD 270.</ref> the favour of heaven furthered Claudius' success. For a great multitude, the survivors of the barbarian tribes, who had gathered in Haemimontum<ref>[[Mount Haemus]] in the Balkans.</ref> were so stricken with famine and pestilence that Claudius now scorned to conquer them further... during this same period the [[Goths|Scythians]] attempted to plunder in Crete and Cyprus as well, but everywhere their armies were likewise stricken with pestilence and so were defeated\".\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nThe severe devastation to the European population from the two plagues may indicate that the people had no previous exposure or [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to the plague's cause. The historian [[William Hardy McNeill]] asserts that both the earlier [[Antonine Plague]] (166\u2013180) and the Plague of Cyprian (251\u2013270) were the first transfers from animal hosts to humanity of two different diseases, one of [[smallpox]] and one of [[measles]], but not necessarily in that order.

Cyprian's biographer, [[Pontius of Carthage]], wrote of the plague at [[Carthage]]:\n<blockquote>\nAfterwards there broke out a dreadful plague, and excessive destruction of a hateful disease invaded every house in succession of the trembling populace, carrying off day by day with abrupt attack numberless people, every one from his own house. All were shuddering, fleeing, shunning the contagion, impiously exposing their own friends, as if with the exclusion of the person who was sure to die of the plague, one could exclude death itself also. There lay about the meanwhile, over the whole city, no longer bodies, but the carcasses of many, and, by the contemplation of a lot which in their turn would be theirs, demanded the pity of the passers-by for themselves. No one regarded anything besides his cruel gains. No one trembled at the remembrance of a similar event. No one did to another what he himself wished to experience.<ref>[[Pontius of Carthage]], ''Life of Cyprian''. Transl. Ernest Wallis, c. 1885. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf05.iv.iii.html Online at ''Christian Classics Ethereal Library''].</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn Carthage, the \"[[Decian Persecution]]\", unleashed at the onset of the plague, perhaps inadvertently led to the criminalization of Christians' refusal to take an oath. Fifty years later, a [[North African]] convert to [[Christianity]], [[Arnobius]], defended his new religion from pagan allegations:\n\n<blockquote>that a plague was brought upon the earth after the Christian religion came into the world, and after it revealed the mysteries of hidden truth? But pestilences, say my opponents, and droughts, wars, famines, locusts, mice, and hailstones, and other hurtful things, by which the property of men is assailed, the gods bring upon us, incensed as they are by your wrong-doings and by your transgressions.<ref>[[Arnobius]], ''Adversus Gentes'' 1.3.

[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06.xii.iii.i.iii.html Online at ''Christian Classics Ethereal Library''].</ref></blockquote>\n\nCyprian drew moralizing analogies in his sermons to the Christian community and drew a word picture of the plague's symptoms in his essay ''De mortalitate'' (\"On the Plague\"):\n\n<blockquote>This trial, that now the bowels, relaxed into a constant flux, discharge the bodily strength; that a fire originated in the marrow ferments into wounds of the [[isthmus of the fauces|fauces]]; that the intestines are shaken with a continual vomiting; that the eyes are on fire with the injected blood; that in some cases the feet or some parts of the limbs are taken off by the contagion of diseased putrefaction; that from the weakness arising by the maiming and loss of the body, either the gait is enfeebled, or the hearing is obstructed, or the sight darkened;\u2014is profitable as a proof of faith. What a grandeur of spirit it is to struggle with all the powers of an unshaken mind against so many onsets of devastation and death! what sublimity, to stand erect amid the desolation of the human race, and not to lie prostrate with those who have no hope in [[God]]; but rather to rejoice, and to embrace the benefit of the occasion; that in thus bravely showing forth our faith, and by suffering endured, going forward to [[Christ]] by the narrow way that Christ trod, we may receive the reward of His life and faith according to His own judgment!<ref>Cyprian, ''De Mortalitate''.

It was part of a Royalist campaign led by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to take control of the Severn Valley from the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]]. Following the costly [[storming of Bristol]] on 26 July, Charles invested Gloucester in the hope that a show of force would prompt it to surrender quickly and without bloodshed. When the city, under the governorship of Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused, the Royalists attempted to bombard it into submission. Massey adopted an aggressive defence, and the Royalist positions outside the city were regularly disrupted by Parliamentarian raids. The Royalist artillery proved inadequate for the task of siege work and, faced with a shortage of ammunition, the besiegers attempted to breach the city walls by mining. With Royalist miners about to reach the city's east gate and the defenders critically low on gunpowder, a Parliamentarian army led by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] arrived and forced Charles to lift the siege.\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:King Charles I after original by van Dyck.jpg|thumb|left|King Charles I|alt=Painting]]\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, [[Storming of Bristol|seized Bristol]]. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\n[[File:SoG 1.jpg|thumb|upright=2|City defences during the siege|alt=Map]]\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north gates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 pp. 242\u2013245</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\n[[File:Edward Massie.jpg|thumb|left|Edward Massey|alt=Painting]]\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey to consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve in the days immediately before the siege began. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, Royalist reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\n===First ten days===\n\n[[File:SoG 2.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Royalist dispositions during the siege|alt=Map]]\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref>\n\nMassey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned nearby to target the east wall.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref>\n\n===Shift of focus to mining===\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Earl of Essex on horseback (State 2).jpg|thumb|Earl of Essex|alt=Drawing]]\n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it become necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\n===Approach of the relief army===\n\n[[File:Essex relief of Gloucester 1643.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Route taken by Essex to Gloucester|alt=Map]]\nBy the end of 3 September Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Meanwhile Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester and, having rendezvoused with Wilmot, ended the day with some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref> The next day the two forces clashed. Although Rupert enjoyed superior numbers, he was dissuaded from pressing his advantage by the appearance of [[Edmund Harvey]] with a regiment of Parliamentarian cavalry and two of infantry. When Essex arrived with the rest of the Parliamentarian army, Rupert was forced into a steady retreat to the area of [[Andoversford]] and [[Compton Abdale]], while Essex's army ended the day around [[Naunton]]. Rupert had been surprised by the size of Essex's force and the skill with which it was handled, and had completely failed in his mission to delay it.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 144\u2013147, 148</ref>\n\nIn Gloucester the Parliamentarians could see the evacuation of some 400 sick or wounded Royalists and the dispatch of some artillery away from the siege, but also the arrival of 2,000 infantry and 500 mounted reinforcements from Bristol. The defender's countermine reached outside the east gate, where they discovered and began boring down on the deeper Royalist mine, while inside the gate an earthwork was completed across the road and the buildings either side were turned into [[blockhouse]]s. They were critically low on gunpowder, but buoyed by the sight of fires lit on nearby Wainlode Hill signalling the approach of Essex. The Royalists, meanwhile, were readying the heavy guns to move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 147\u2013148</ref>\n\nOn 5 September Essex took the quickest way off the open country of the Cotswold hills down into the relative safety of the Severn valley. This meant descending the steep escarpment at Prestbury Hill towards [[Cheltenham]], rather than heading directly to Gloucester. His lead elements began the difficult descent at dusk, but the baggage train and rearguard were forced to spend the night in worsening weather in the hills. Rupert, who appears to have expected a more direct march on Gloucester, was not in a position to harass the Parliamentarians, and returned to Gloucester. There he covered the Royalist army as it lifted the siege and withdrew to Matson, {{convert|2|mi|km}} south-east of the city. Charles had already departed his headquarters there and ridden ahead to [[Painswick]]. The defenders inside the city did not know how close Essex was and, not quite believing the siege was over, remained vigilant behind their defences rather than attempt to harass the retreating Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 148\u2013151</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Charles I (State 3).jpg|thumb|left|Charles leading his troops|alt=Drawing]]\nRoyalist casualties during the siege were claimed to be in the range of 1,000 to over 1,500, the Parliamentarian losses ranging from 30 to 50. Royalist sources concede 120 killed during the siege, with reports of sick and wounded giving numbers of 900, 400 and 300. [[Jon Day]] gives a conservative estimate of Royalist casualties as 1,200 killed, wounded and sick, with another 800 lost to desertion.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 155, 168</ref> The siege had come close to succeeding, and by the end of it the defenders were down to their last barrels of gunpowder. It is unlikely they would have been able to withstand an assault, but because of Charles's aversion to casualties, none was ever attempted. Massey's aggressive tactics were a critical factor in the successful defence of the city, and ensured that morale never dropped to the low levels witnessed before the siege began. The Royalists specifically identified his countermining as the reason for lifting the siege. The Royalist artillery proved inadequate to the task of siege work, and the 300\u2013400 large cannon balls and 20+ mortar bombs that were fired on the city failed to blow any major breach in the walls, start any significant fires or cause more than a handful of casualties.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nAlthough the failure at Gloucester adversely affected Royalist morale, the campaign presented Charles with an opportunity to inflict a decisive blow against his enemy. The Parliamentarian army and its trained band reserves had effectively been lured out of a strong position behind the London defences, into open country where they could be more easily defeated. Against a Parliamentarian army some 14,500 strong, the Royalist army of 9,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry was slightly inferior in the quantity of infantry but superior in cavalry by a factor of three to two. The arrival of additional guns ordered from Oxford during the siege gave the Royalists parity in artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 165, 167\u2013168</ref>\n\nEssex's objective after the siege was to evade the Royalist army and return his own intact to London. In a feint designed to draw Charles away from his intended route back to London, Essex marched north to [[Tewkesbury]], where he could better supply his army and threaten Royalist Worcester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 171\u2013172</ref> When Charles marched his army after him, Essex retraced his steps back to Cheltenham. With the Royalists concentrated around [[Evesham]] and [[Pershore]], Essex was able to march back up into the Cotswolds in the direction of Cirencester, where he defeated the 400-strong Royalist garrison on 16 September.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 175, 177\u2013178</ref>\n\nEssex believed he had etablished a commanding lead over Charles and, not wishing to drive his hungry army too hard, slowed his pace on the march to [[Swindon]].<ref>Day 2007 pp. 184\u2013185</ref> He was further slowed after Swindon when Rupert's cavalry caught up, and the resulting [[Battle of Aldbourne Chase]] on 18 September allowed the rest of the Royalist army to close the distance.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 186\u2013192</ref> Charles finally brought Essex to battle on 20 September in the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to defeat him, allowing the Parliamentarians to reach the safety of their London stronghold four days later.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 226, 269, 280</ref>\n\nGloucester resumed its role as a logistic base for local operations and remained a Parliamentarian centre for the rest of the war, though Massey was removed as governor in 1645 over suspicions about his loyalty. By 1649 the burden of maintaining the garrison was generating divisions within the city. In 1651 a Scottish army moved south in support of the Royalists, prompting the city to restore its fortifications and raise a new town regiment. The garrison was withdrawn two years later, but in 1659, the city became increasingly divided as support for Parliament dissipated. Pury raised 300 troops to defend Gloucester for Parliament, while Massey, now a Royalist, plotted its capture. As the war came to an end Massey returned to and was elected as the member of parliament for Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 156</ref><ref>Herbert 1988 pp. 92\u201395</ref> After the [[The

August and 5 September 1643 during the [[First English Civil War]]. It was part of a Royalist campaign led by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to take control of the Severn Valley from the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]]. Following the costly [[storming of Bristol]] on 26 July, Charles invested Gloucester in the hope that a show of force would prompt it to surrender quickly and without bloodshed. When the city, under the governorship of Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused, the Royalists attempted to bombard it into submission. Massey adopted an aggressive defence, and the Royalist positions outside the city were regularly disrupted by Parliamentarian raids. The Royalist artillery proved inadequate for the task of siege work and, faced with a shortage of ammunition, the besiegers attempted to breach the city walls by mining. With Royalist miners about to reach the city's east gate and the defenders critically low on gunpowder, a Parliamentarian army led by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] arrived and forced Charles to lift the siege.\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:King Charles I after original by van Dyck.jpg|thumb|left|King Charles I|alt=Painting]]\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, [[Storming of Bristol|seized Bristol]]. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\n[[File:SoG 1.jpg|thumb|upright=2|City defences during the siege|alt=Map]]\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north gates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 pp. 242\u2013245</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\n[[File:Edward Massie.jpg|thumb|left|Edward Massey|alt=Painting]]\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey to consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve in the days immediately before the siege began. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, Royalist reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\n===First ten days===\n\n[[File:SoG 2.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Royalist dispositions during the siege|alt=Map]]\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref>\n\nMassey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned nearby to target the east wall.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref>\n\n===Shift of focus to mining===\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Earl of Essex on horseback (State 2).jpg|thumb|Earl of Essex|alt=Drawing]]\n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it become necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\n===Approach of the relief army===\n\n[[File:Essex relief of Gloucester 1643.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Route taken by Essex to Gloucester|alt=Map]]\nBy the end of 3 September Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Meanwhile Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester and, having rendezvoused with Wilmot, ended the day with some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref> The next day the two forces clashed. Although Rupert enjoyed superior numbers, he was dissuaded from pressing his advantage by the appearance of [[Edmund Harvey]] with a regiment of Parliamentarian cavalry and two of infantry. When Essex arrived with the rest of the Parliamentarian army, Rupert was forced into a steady retreat to the area of [[Andoversford]] and [[Compton Abdale]], while Essex's army ended the day around [[Naunton]]. Rupert had been surprised by the size of Essex's force and the skill with which it was handled, and had completely failed in his mission to delay it.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 144\u2013147, 148</ref>\n\nIn Gloucester the Parliamentarians could see the evacuation of some 400 sick or wounded Royalists and the dispatch of some artillery away from the siege, but also the arrival of 2,000 infantry and 500 mounted reinforcements from Bristol. The defender's countermine reached outside the east gate, where they discovered and began boring down on the deeper Royalist mine, while inside the gate an earthwork was completed across the road and the buildings either side were turned into [[blockhouse]]s. They were critically low on gunpowder, but buoyed by the sight of fires lit on nearby Wainlode Hill signalling the approach of Essex. The Royalists, meanwhile, were readying the heavy guns to move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 147\u2013148</ref>\n\nOn 5 September Essex took the quickest way off the open country of the Cotswold hills down into the relative safety of the Severn valley. This meant descending the steep escarpment at Prestbury Hill towards [[Cheltenham]], rather than heading directly to Gloucester. His lead elements began the difficult descent at dusk, but the baggage train and rearguard were forced to spend the night in worsening weather in the hills. Rupert, who appears to have expected a more direct march on Gloucester, was not in a position to harass the Parliamentarians, and returned to Gloucester. There he covered the Royalist army as it lifted the siege and withdrew to Matson, {{convert|2|mi|km}} south-east of the city. Charles had already departed his headquarters there and ridden ahead to [[Painswick]]. The defenders inside the city did not know how close Essex was and, not quite believing the siege was over, remained vigilant behind their defences rather than attempt to harass the retreating Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 148\u2013151</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Charles I (State 3).jpg|thumb|left|Charles leading his troops|alt=Drawing]]\nRoyalist casualties during the siege were claimed to be in the range of 1,000 to over 1,500, the Parliamentarian losses ranging from 30 to 50. Royalist sources concede 120 killed during the siege, with reports of sick and wounded giving numbers of 900, 400 and 300. [[Jon Day]] gives a conservative estimate of Royalist casualties as 1,200 killed, wounded and sick, with another 800 lost to desertion.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 155, 168</ref> The siege had come close to succeeding, and by the end of it the defenders were down to their last barrels of gunpowder. It is unlikely they would have been able to withstand an assault, but because of Charles's aversion to casualties, none was ever attempted. Massey's aggressive tactics were a critical factor in the successful defence of the city, and ensured that morale never dropped to the low levels witnessed before the siege began. The Royalists specifically identified his countermining as the reason for lifting the siege. The Royalist artillery proved inadequate to the task of siege work, and the 300\u2013400 large cannon balls and 20+ mortar bombs that were fired on the city failed to blow any major breach in the walls, start any significant fires or cause more than a handful of casualties.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nAlthough the failure at Gloucester adversely affected Royalist morale, the campaign presented Charles with an opportunity to inflict a decisive blow against his enemy. The Parliamentarian army and its trained band reserves had effectively been lured out of a strong position behind the London defences, into open country where they could be more easily defeated. Against a Parliamentarian army some 14,500 strong, the Royalist army of 9,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry was slightly inferior in the quantity of infantry but superior in cavalry by a factor of three to two. The arrival of additional guns ordered from Oxford during the siege gave the Royalists parity in artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 165, 167\u2013168</ref>\n\nEssex's objective after the siege was to evade the Royalist army and return his own intact to London. In a feint designed to draw Charles away from his intended route back to London, Essex marched north to [[Tewkesbury]], where he could better supply his army and threaten Royalist Worcester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 171\u2013172</ref> When Charles marched his army after him, Essex retraced his steps back to Cheltenham. With the Royalists concentrated around [[Evesham]] and [[Pershore]], Essex was able to march back up into the Cotswolds in the direction of Cirencester, where he defeated the 400-strong Royalist garrison on 16 September.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 175, 177\u2013178</ref>\n\nEssex believed he had etablished a commanding lead over Charles and, not wishing to drive his hungry army too hard, slowed his pace on the march to [[Swindon]].<ref>Day 2007 pp. 184\u2013185</ref> He was further slowed after Swindon when Rupert's cavalry caught up, and the resulting [[Battle of Aldbourne Chase]] on 18 September allowed the rest of the Royalist army to close the distance.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 186\u2013192</ref> Charles finally brought Essex to battle on 20 September in the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to defeat him, allowing the Parliamentarians to reach the safety of their London stronghold four days later.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 226, 269, 280</ref>\n\nGloucester resumed its role as a logistic base for local operations and remained a Parliamentarian centre for the rest of the war, though Massey was removed as governor in 1645 over suspicions about his loyalty. By 1649 the burden of maintaining the garrison was generating divisions within the city. In 1651 a Scottish army moved south in support of the Royalists, prompting the city to restore its fortifications and raise a new town regiment. The garrison was withdrawn two years later, but in 1659, the city became increasingly divided as support for Parliament dissipated. Pury raised 300 troops to defend Gloucester for Parliament, while Massey, now a Royalist, plotted its capture.

Angiotensin II acts on the CNS to increase [[vasopressin]] production, and also acts on venous and arterial smooth muscle to cause vasoconstriction. Angiotensin II also increases [[aldosterone]] secretion; it therefore acts as an [[endocrine system|endocrine]], [[autocrine signalling|autocrine]]/[[paracrine signalling|paracrine]], and [[intracrine]] hormone.\n\nACE is a target of [[ACE inhibitor]] drugs, which decrease the rate of angiotensin II production. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by stimulating the Gq protein in vascular smooth muscle cells (which in turn activates an IP3-dependent mechanism leading to a rise in intracellular calcium levels and ultimately causing contraction). In addition, angiotensin II acts at the [[Na+/H+ exchanger|Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger]] in the [[proximal tubule]]s of the kidney to stimulate Na reabsorption and H<sup>+</sup> excretion which is coupled to bicarbonate reabsorption. This ultimately results in an increase in blood volume, pressure, and pH.<ref>{{cite book|last=Le|first=Tao | name-list-format = vanc |title=First Aid for the Basic Sciences. Organ Systems|year=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=625}}</ref> Hence, [[ACE inhibitor]]s are major anti-hypertensive drugs.\n\nOther cleavage products of ACE, seven or nine amino acids long, are also known; they have differential affinity for [[angiotensin receptors]], although their exact role is still unclear. The action of AII itself is targeted by [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]]s, which directly block [[Angiotensin receptor|angiotensin II AT<sub>1</sub> receptors]].\n\nAngiotensin II is degraded to angiotensin III by angiotensinases located in red blood cells and the vascular beds of most tissues. It has a half-life in circulation of around 30 seconds, whereas, in tissue, it may be as long as 15\u201330 minutes.\n\nAngiotensin II results in increased inotropy, chronotropy, catecholamine (norepinephrine) release, catecholamine sensitivity, aldosterone levels, vasopressin levels, and cardiac remodeling and vasoconstriction through AT1 receptors on peripheral vessels (conversely, AT2 receptors impair cardiac remodeling). This is why ACE inhibitors and ARBs help to prevent remodeling that occurs secondary to angiotensin II and are beneficial in CHF.<ref name=\"Schnermann_2013\" />\n\n=== Angiotensin III ===\n\n:Asp | Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe\n\nAngiotensin III has 40% of the [[Vasoconstrictor|pressor]] activity of angiotensin II, but 100% of the aldosterone-producing activity.\nIncreases [[mean arterial pressure]].

It has a complex and variable effect on [[glomerular filtration]] and [[renal blood flow]] depending on the setting. Increases in systemic blood pressure will maintain renal perfusion pressure; however, constriction of the afferent and efferent glomerular arterioles will tend to restrict renal blood flow. The effect on the efferent arteriolar resistance is, however, markedly greater, in part due to its smaller basal diameter; this tends to increase glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and maintain [[glomerular filtration rate]]. A number of other mechanisms can affect renal blood flow and GFR. High concentrations of Angiotensin II can constrict the glomerular mesangium, reducing the area for glomerular filtration. Angiotensin II is a sensitizer to [[tubuloglomerular feedback]], preventing an excessive rise in GFR. Angiotensin II causes the local release of prostaglandins, which, in turn, antagonize renal vasoconstriction. The net effect of these competing mechanisms on glomerular filtration will vary with the physiological and pharmacological environment.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Direct Renal effects of angiotensin II (not including [[aldosterone]] release)\n|-\n!Target\n!Action\n!Mechanism<ref name=\"isbn1-4160-2328-3\">{{cite book |vauthors=Boulpaep EL, Boron WF | title = Medical Physiology: a Cellular and Molecular Approach | edition = | publisher = Elsevier Saunders | location = St. Louis, Mo | year = 2005 | origyear = | pages = 771 | quote = | isbn = 978-1-4160-2328-9 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>\n|-\n![[renal artery]] & <BR> [[afferent arterioles]] \n| [[vasoconstriction]] (weaker) || [[Voltage-dependent calcium channel|VDCC]]s \u2192 [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] influx\n|-\n!

Angiotensin II acts on the CNS to increase [[vasopressin]] production, and also acts on venous and arterial smooth muscle to cause vasoconstriction. Angiotensin II also increases [[aldosterone]] secretion; it therefore acts as an [[endocrine system|endocrine]], [[autocrine signalling|autocrine]]/[[paracrine signalling|paracrine]], and [[intracrine]] hormone.\n\nACE is a target of [[ACE inhibitor]] drugs, which decrease the rate of angiotensin II production. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by stimulating the Gq protein in vascular smooth muscle cells (which in turn activates an IP3-dependent mechanism leading to a rise in intracellular calcium levels and ultimately causing contraction). In addition, angiotensin II acts at the [[Na+/H+ exchanger|Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger]] in the [[proximal tubule]]s of the kidney to stimulate Na reabsorption and H<sup>+</sup> excretion which is coupled to bicarbonate reabsorption. This ultimately results in an increase in blood volume, pressure, and pH.<ref>{{cite book|last=Le|first=Tao | name-list-format = vanc |title=First Aid for the Basic Sciences. Organ Systems|year=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=625}}</ref> Hence, [[ACE inhibitor]]s are major anti-hypertensive drugs.\n\nOther cleavage products of ACE, seven or 9 amino acids long, are also known; they have differential affinity for [[angiotensin receptors]], although their exact role is still unclear. The action of AII itself is targeted by [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]]s, which directly block [[Angiotensin receptor|angiotensin II AT<sub>1</sub> receptors]].\n\nAngiotensin II is degraded to angiotensin III by angiotensinases located in red blood cells and the vascular beds of most tissues. It has a half-life in circulation of around 30 seconds, whereas, in tissue, it may be as long as 15\u201330 minutes.\n\nAngiotensin II results in increased inotropy, chronotropy, catecholamine (norepinephrine) release, catecholamine sensitivity, aldosterone levels, vasopressin levels, and cardiac remodeling and vasoconstriction through AT1 receptors on peripheral vessels (conversely, AT2 receptors impair cardiac remodeling). This is why ACE inhibitors and ARBs help to prevent remodeling that occurs secondary to angiotensin II and are beneficial in CHF.<ref name=\"Schnermann_2013\" />\n\n=== Angiotensin III ===\n\n:Asp | Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe\n\nAngiotensin III has 40% of the [[Vasoconstrictor|pressor]] activity of angiotensin II, but 100% of the aldosterone-producing activity.\nIncreases [[mean arterial pressure]].

It has a complex and variable effect on [[glomerular filtration]] and [[renal blood flow]] depending on the setting. Increases in systemic blood pressure will maintain renal perfusion pressure; however, constriction of the afferent and efferent glomerular arterioles will tend to restrict renal blood flow. The effect on the efferent arteriolar resistance is, however, markedly greater, in part due to its smaller basal diameter; this tends to increase glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and maintain [[glomerular filtration rate]]. A number of other mechanisms can affect renal blood flow and GFR. High concentrations of Angiotensin II can constrict the glomerular mesangium, reducing the area for glomerular filtration. Angiotensin II is a sensitizer to [[tubuloglomerular feedback]], preventing an excessive rise in GFR. Angiotensin II causes the local release of prostaglandins, which, in turn, antagonize renal vasoconstriction. The net effect of these competing mechanisms on glomerular filtration will vary with the physiological and pharmacological environment.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Direct Renal effects of angiotensin II (not including [[aldosterone]] release)\n|-\n!Target\n!Action\n!Mechanism<ref name=\"isbn1-4160-2328-3\">{{cite book |vauthors=Boulpaep EL, Boron WF | title = Medical Physiology: a Cellular and Molecular Approach | edition = | publisher = Elsevier Saunders | location = St. Louis, Mo | year = 2005 | origyear = | pages = 771 | quote = | isbn = 978-1-4160-2328-9 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>\n|-\n![[renal artery]] & <BR> [[afferent arterioles]] \n| [[vasoconstriction]] (weaker) || [[Voltage-dependent calcium channel|VDCC]]s \u2192 [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] influx\n|-\n!

In 1997, the first demo was released, containing three songs.\n\n[[File:Ensiferum (logo).svg|180px|thumb|right|The highly stylized logo of Ensiferum has appeared on all of their releases.]]\n[[File:Ensiferum Rockharz 2016 25.jpg|thumb|Guitarist Markus Toivonen at Rockharz 2016]]\n[[File:Ensiferum Rockharz 2016 23.jpg|thumb|Accordeonista Netta Skog at Rockharz 2016]]\nIn 1998, Sauli and Kimmo left the band and were replaced by Jukka-Pekka Miettinen (Kimmo's little brother, then 14 years old) and Oliver Fokin. In January 1999, a second demo was recorded, which although it did not produce a recording deal, boosted the band's confidence. In November 1999 a third demo, \"Hero in a Dream\", was recorded, which was successful in obtaining a record deal with [[Spinefarm Records]]. The logo that appears on all the bands releases was designed for the third demo by Tuomas Tahvanainen, who also designed the logos for the earlier demos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ensiferum.com/e_html/e_history.htm|title=Story of Ensiferum|website=Ensiferum|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113121556/http://www.ensiferum.com/e_html/e_history.htm|archivedate=January 13, 2008|accessdate=January 25, 2008}}</ref> In 2000, the band went into the studio to work on their first album, ''[[Ensiferum (album)|Ensiferum]]'', which was released in August 2001. In the same year, Meiju Enho joined them as a [[Synthesizer|keyboard]]-player.\n\n===''Iron'', Line-up changes, ''Dragonheads'' and ''10th Anniversary Live'' (2003\u22122006)===\nIn 2004, after the work was completed on the second album, ''[[Iron (Ensiferum)|Iron]]'', Jari left the band due to conflicts between scheduled studio work on his side project [[Wintersun]] and touring with Ensiferum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tartareandesire.com/interviews/wintersun.html|title=Wintersun interview|website=Tartarean Desire Webzine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011072155/https://www.tartareandesire.com/interviews/wintersun.html|archive-date=October 11, 2017|access-date=November 30, 2019}}</ref> For the tour with [[Finntroll]], Petri Lindroos from [[Norther]] replaced Jari on guitar and as singer, and became a member of the band after the tour. In December 2004, Jukka-Pekka left the band and was replaced by Sami Hinkka ([[Rapture (band)|Rapture]]). Oliver also left in 2005 to be replaced by Janne Parviainen.\n\nThe new Ensiferum line-up entered the studio later that year to record an [[Extended play|EP]] to be called ''[[Dragonheads]]'', which was released in February 2006. As well as the title track, it also contained two reworked demo songs; an [[Amorphis]] cover and a short rendition of the [[Kalevala]] melody, as well as a medley of three traditional [[Finland|Finnish]] songs.\n\nIn June 2006, Ensiferum released their live [[DVD]], ''[[10th Anniversary Live]]'', which was recorded in [[Nosturi]], [[Helsinki]], on 31 December 2005.\n\n===''Victory Songs'' and Meiju's departure (2006\u22122009)===\nThe recording of the third studio album, called ''[[Victory Songs]]'', took place between November 2006 and early 2007, and was released on 20 April 2007. A single titled \"[[One More Magic Potion]]\" (after the track of the same name) was released on 7 February. Following the album's release, the band released through the producer's [[MySpace]] page, a music video for the song \"Ahti,\" which included all band members featured as extras. The video was released after the album release due to video filming problems.\n\nOn 10 September 2007, it was announced that keyboardist [[Meiju Enho]] would leave the band. This was posted in a bulletin on their MySpace page and later confirmed on their website. The band used [[Emmi Silvennoinen]] of [[Exsecratus]] as a touring fill-in.

In October 2010, Ensiferum embarked on their first ever South African tour. This tour consisted of four shows in two cities, and they were accompanied by numerous local metal bands including [[Riddare av Koden]], Empery and All Forlorn. The final show, at The Black Dahlia in Johannesburg, was filmed to potentially appear on their next live DVD. In early 2011 Ensiferum embarked on [[The Ugly World Tour 2011]] with labelmates [[Children of Bodom]], [[Amon Amarth]], [[Machinae Supremacy]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} supporting them for segments of their tour in the US and Canada.

In March of that year, Ensiferum announced on their Facebook page that keyboardist Emmi Silvennoinen would not be able to make the European and North American \"One Man Army Tour\" due to personal commitments at home. Former [[Turisas]] accordion player Netta Skog filled her role for the tour. Skog had performed clean vocals on the ''One Man Army'' songs ''Cry for the Earth Bounds'' and ''Neito Pohjolan''. [[Heri Joensen]] of [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]] makes an appearance on the track \"Heathen Horde\", quoting stanza 16 of ''H\u00e1vam\u00e1l'' in Old Icelandic.\n\nOn 31 March 2016 it was announced that Emmi Silvennoinen would take a leave of absence from the band because of personal issues. Netta Skog was confirmed as her permanent replacement. With Skog in the line-up, the band entered the studio to record their seventh studio album, ''[[Two Paths (album)|Two Paths]]''. Anssi Kippo, who had produced ''One Man Army'', was again chosen to produce the album. The band focused on a more \"organic\" sound for ''Two Paths'', using [[analog recording]] and neglecting to use a [[click track]] for certain songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ensiferum.com/band/|title=Band \u2013 Ensiferum|website=Ensiferum|access-date=January 1, 2018}}</ref> ''Two Paths'' was released on 15 September 2017.\n\nAccordionist Netta Skog left the band in December 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Ensiferum/posts/10155249567326309|title=NETTA SKOG TO LEAVE ENSIFERUM|date=December 21, 2017|website=[[Facebook]]|access-date=January 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Eighth Album ===\nOn January 7th, 2020, the band announced that they had begun recording a follow up record to ''Two Paths'', at Studio Petrax in [[Hollola]], Finland.

For the band's name, they took the [[Latin]]  adjective ''ensiferum'', which means \"sword-bearing\". In the next year, [[Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4]] was taken into the band as singer and second guitar-player. In 1997, the first demo was released, containing three songs.\n\n[[File:Ensiferum (logo).svg|180px|thumb|right|The highly stylized logo of Ensiferum has appeared on all of their releases.]]\n[[File:Ensiferum Rockharz 2016 25.jpg|thumb|Guitarist Markus Toivonen at Rockharz 2016]]\n[[File:Ensiferum Rockharz 2016 23.jpg|thumb|Accordeonista Netta Skog at Rockharz 2016]]\nIn 1998, Sauli and Kimmo left the band and were replaced by Jukka-Pekka Miettinen (Kimmo's little brother, then 14 years old) and Oliver Fokin. In January 1999, a second demo was recorded, which although it did not produce a recording deal, boosted the band's confidence. In November 1999 a third demo, \"Hero in a Dream\", was recorded, which was successful in obtaining a record deal with [[Spinefarm Records]]. The logo that appears on all the bands releases was designed for the third demo by Tuomas Tahvanainen, who also designed the logos for the earlier demos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ensiferum.com/e_html/e_history.htm|title=Story of Ensiferum|website=Ensiferum|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113121556/http://www.ensiferum.com/e_html/e_history.htm|archivedate=January 13, 2008|accessdate=January 25, 2008}}</ref> In 2000, the band went into the studio to work on their first album, ''[[Ensiferum (album)|Ensiferum]]'', which was released in August 2001.

In December 2004, Jukka-Pekka left the band and was replaced by Sami Hinkka ([[Rapture (band)|Rapture]]). Oliver also left in 2005 to be replaced by Janne Parviainen.\n\nThe new Ensiferum line-up entered the studio later that year to record an [[Extended play|EP]] to be called ''[[Dragonheads]]'', which was released in February 2006. As well as the title track, it also contained two reworked demo songs; an [[Amorphis]] cover and a short rendition of the [[Kalevala]] melody, as well as a medley of three traditional [[Finland|Finnish]] songs.\n\nIn June 2006, Ensiferum released their live [[DVD]], ''[[10th Anniversary Live]]'', which was recorded in [[Nosturi]], [[Helsinki]], on 31 December 2005.\n\n===''Victory Songs'' and Meiju's departure (2006\u22122009)===\nThe recording of the third studio album, called ''[[Victory Songs]]'', took place between November 2006 and early 2007, and was released on 20 April 2007. A single titled \"[[One More Magic Potion]]\" (after the track of the same name) was released on 7 February. Following the album's release, the band released through the producer's [[MySpace]] page, a music video for the song \"Ahti,\" which included all band members featured as extras. The video was released after the album release due to video filming problems.\n\nOn 10 September 2007, it was announced that keyboardist [[Meiju Enho]] would leave the band. This was posted in a bulletin on their MySpace page and later confirmed on their website. The band used [[Emmi Silvennoinen]] of [[Exsecratus]] as a touring fill-in.

This tour consisted of four shows in two cities, and they were accompanied by numerous local metal bands including [[Riddare av Koden]], Empery and All Forlorn. The final show, at The Black Dahlia in Johannesburg, was filmed to potentially appear on their next live DVD. In early 2011 Ensiferum embarked on [[The Ugly World Tour 2011]] with labelmates [[Children of Bodom]], [[Amon Amarth]], [[Machinae Supremacy]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} supporting them for segments of their tour in the US and Canada.

In March of that year, Ensiferum announced on their Facebook page that keyboardist Emmi Silvennoinen would not be able to make the European and North American \"One Man Army Tour\" due to personal commitments at home. Former [[Turisas]] accordion player Netta Skog filled her role for the tour. Skog had performed clean vocals on the ''One Man Army'' songs ''Cry for the Earth Bounds'' and ''Neito Pohjolan''. [[Heri Joensen]] of [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]] makes an appearance on the track \"Heathen Horde\", quoting stanza 16 of ''H\u00e1vam\u00e1l'' in Old Icelandic.\n\nOn 31 March 2016 it was announced that Emmi Silvennoinen would take a leave of absence from the band because of personal issues. Netta Skog was confirmed as her permanent replacement. With Skog in the line-up, the band entered the studio to record their seventh studio album, ''[[Two Paths (album)|Two Paths]]''. Anssi Kippo, who had produced ''One Man Army'', was again chosen to produce the album. The band focused on a more \"organic\" sound for ''Two Paths'', using [[analog recording]] and neglecting to use a [[click track]] for certain songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ensiferum.com/band/|title=Band \u2013 Ensiferum|website=Ensiferum|access-date=January 1, 2018}}</ref> ''Two Paths'' was released on 15 September 2017.\n\nAccordionist Netta Skog left the band in December 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Ensiferum/posts/10155249567326309|title=NETTA SKOG TO LEAVE ENSIFERUM|date=December 21, 2017|website=[[Facebook]]|access-date=January 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Eighth Album ===\nOn January 7th, 2020, the band announced that they had begun recording a follow up record to ''Two Paths'', at Studio Petrax in [[Hollola]], Finland.
