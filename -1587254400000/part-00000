''Alpine Conferences''. Retrieved August 3, 2012</ref> The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian [[tectonic plate]]s collided. Extreme shortening <!-- why shortening? --> caused by the event resulted in marine [[sedimentary rock]]s rising by [[thrust fault|thrusting]] and [[Fold (geology)|folding]] into high mountain peaks such as [[Mont Blanc]] and the [[Matterhorn]]. Mont Blanc spans the French\u2013Italian border, and at {{convert|4809|m|abbr=on|0}} is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than [[List of Alpine four-thousanders|{{convert|4000|m|ft}}]].\n\nThe altitude and size of the range affect the climate in Europe; in the mountains, precipitation levels vary greatly, and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones. Wildlife such as [[ibex]] live in the higher peaks to elevations of {{convert|3400|m|abbr=on|0}}, and plants such as [[Edelweiss]] grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations. Evidence of human habitation in the Alps goes back to the [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic]] era. A [[\u00d6tzi the Iceman|mummified man]], determined to be 5,000 years old, was discovered on a glacier at the Austrian\u2013Italian border in 1991.\n\nBy the 6th century BC, the Celtic [[La T\u00e8ne culture]] was well established. [[Hannibal]] famously crossed the Alps with a herd of elephants, and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had settlements in the region. In 1800, [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] crossed one of the mountain passes with an army of 40,000. The 18th and 19th centuries saw an influx of naturalists, writers, and artists, in particular, the [[Romanticism|Romantics]], followed by the [[golden age of alpinism]] as mountaineers began to ascend the peaks.\n\nThe Alpine region has a strong cultural identity. The traditional culture of farming, cheesemaking, and woodworking still exists in Alpine villages. However, the tourist industry began to grow early in the 20th century and expanded greatly after World War II to become the dominant industry by the end of the century.

Elevations around the world that have cold climates similar to those of the [[polar region]]s have been called [[Alpine climate|Alpine]]. A rise from sea level into the upper regions of the atmosphere causes the temperature to decrease (see [[adiabatic lapse rate]]). The effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of temperature, often accompanied by precipitation in the form of snow or rain.{{sfn|Knox|1911|p=737}} The height of the Alps is sufficient to divide the weather patterns in Europe into a wet north and dry south because moisture is sucked from the air as it flows over the high peaks.<ref>Fleming (2000), 3</ref>\n\n[[File:Aletschgletscher mit Pinus cembra1.jpg|thumb|The [[Aletsch Glacier]] with pine trees growing on the hillside (2007; the surface is {{convert|180|m|abbr=on}} lower than 150 years ago)]]\n\nThe severe weather in the Alps has been studied since the 18th century, particularly the weather patterns such as the seasonal [[foehn wind]]. Numerous weather stations were placed in the mountains early in the early 20th century, providing continuous data for climatologists.<ref name=\"Ceben 22\u201324\">Ceben (1998), 22\u201324</ref> Some of the valleys are quite arid such as the [[Aosta]] valley in Italy, the [[Maurienne]] in France, the [[Valais]] in Switzerland, and northern [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]].<ref name=\"Ceben 22\u201324\" />\n\nThe areas that are not arid and receive high precipitation experience periodic flooding from rapid snowmelt and runoff.<ref name=\"Ceben 1998, 31\"/> The mean precipitation in the Alps ranges from a low of {{convert|2600|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year to {{convert|3600|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year, with the higher levels occurring at high altitudes. At altitudes between {{convert|1000|and|3,000|m|abbr=on|}}, snowfall begins in November and accumulates through to April or May when the melt begins. [[Snow line]]s vary from {{convert|2400|to|3,000|m|abbr=on|}}, above which the snow is permanent, and the temperatures hover around the freezing point even during July and August. High-water levels in streams and rivers peak in June and July when the snow is still melting at the higher altitudes.<ref>Ceben (1998), 34\u201336</ref>\n\nThe Alps are split into five climatic zones, each with different vegetation. The climate, plant life, and animal life vary among the different sections or zones of the mountains. The lowest zone is the colline zone, which exists between {{convert|500|and|1000|m|abbr=on|}}, depending on the location. The [[montane]] zone extends from {{convert|800|to|1,700|m|abbr=on|}}, followed by the sub-Alpine zone from {{convert|1600|to|2,400|m|abbr=on|}}. The Alpine zone, extending from [[tree line]] to snow line, is followed by the glacial zone, which covers the glaciated areas of the mountain. Climatic conditions show variances within the same zones; for example, weather conditions at the head of a mountain valley, extending directly from the peaks, are colder and more severe than those at the mouth of a valley which tend to be less severe and receive less snowfall.<ref>Viazzo (1980), 17</ref>\n\nVarious models of [[climate change]] have been projected into the 22nd century for the Alps, with an expectation that a trend toward increased temperatures will have an effect on snowfall, snowpack, glaciation, and river runoff.<ref>Benniston (2011), 3\u20134</ref> Significant changes, of both natural and anthropogenic origins, have already been diagnosed from observations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huss|first=Matthias|last2=Hock|first2=Regine|last3=Bauder|first3=Andreas|last4=Funk|first4=Martin|date=May 1, 2010|title=100-year mass changes in the Swiss Alps linked to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=37|issue=10|pages=L10501|doi=10.1029/2010GL042616|issn=1944-8007|bibcode=2010GeoRL..3710501H|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/20213/files/hus_msc_sm.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zampieri|first=Matteo|last2=Scoccimarro|first2=Enrico|last3=Gualdi|first3=Silvio|date=January 1, 2013|title=Atlantic influence on spring snowfall over the Alps in the past 150 years|journal=Environmental Research Letters|language=en|volume=8|issue=3|pages=034026|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034026|issn=1748-9326|doi-access=free|bibcode=2013ERL.....8c4026Z}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zampieri|first=Matteo|last2=Scoccimarro|first2=Enrico|last3=Gualdi|first3=Silvio|last4=Navarra|first4=Antonio|date=January 15, 2015|title=Observed shift towards earlier spring discharge in the main Alpine rivers|journal=Science of the Total Environment|series=Towards a better understanding of the links between stressors, hazard assessment and ecosystem services under water scarcity|volume=503\u2013504|pages=222\u2013232|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.06.036|pmid=25005239|hdl=2122/9055|bibcode=2015ScTEn.503..222Z}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n=== Flora ===\n{{main|Flora of the Alps}}\n\n[[File:Gentiana clusii03.jpg|thumb|Stemless gentian (''[[Gentiana acaulis]]'')]]\n\nThirteen thousand species of plants have been identified in the Alpine regions.<ref name = \"Chatr\u00e98\"/> Alpine plants are grouped by habitat and soil type, which can be [[limestone]] or non-calcareous.

Grazing and pasture land are limited because of the steep and rocky topography of the Alps. In mid-June, cows are moved to the highest pastures close to the snowline, where they are watched by herdsmen who stay in the high altitudes often living in stone huts or wooden barns during the summers.<ref name = \"Shoumatoff123ff\"/> Villagers celebrate the day the cows are herded up to the pastures and again when they return in mid-September. The [[Almabtrieb|Almabtrieb, Alpabzug, Alpabfahrt, D\u00e9salpes]] (\"coming down from the alps\") is celebrated by decorating the cows with garlands and enormous [[cowbell]]s while the farmers dress in traditional costumes.<ref name = \"Shoumatoff123ff\"/>\n\n[[File:LeMonal-fontaine-chapelle-Savoie.JPG|thumb|left|In the summers, the cows are brought up to the high mountain meadows for grazing.

Owners of the cows traditionally receive from the cheesemakers a portion in relation to the proportion of the cows' milk from the summer months in the high alps. Haymaking is an important farming activity in mountain villages, which has become somewhat mechanized in recent years. However, the slopes are so steep that usually, scythes are necessary to cut the grass. Hay is normally brought in twice a year, often also on festival days.<ref name = \"Shoumatoff123ff\"/> Alpine festivals vary from country to country and often include the display of local costumes such as [[dirndl]] and [[tracht]]en, the playing of [[Alpenhorn]]s, wrestling matches, some pagan traditions such as [[Walpurgis Night]] and, in many areas, [[Carnival]] is celebrated before [[Lent]].<ref>Shoumataff (2001), 129, 135</ref>\n\nIn the high villages, people live in homes built according to medieval designs that withstand cold winters. The kitchen is separated from the living area (called the ''stube'', the area of the home heated by a stove), and second-floor bedrooms benefit from rising heat. The typical Swiss [[chalet]] originated in the Bernese Oberland. Chalets often face south or downhill and are built of solid wood, with a steeply gabled roof to allow accumulated snow to slide off easily. Stairs leading to upper levels are sometimes built on the outside, and balconies are sometimes enclosed.<ref name = \"Shoumatoff123ff\"/><ref>Shoumataff (2001), 134</ref>\n[[File:Schaufschod 2009 05.JPG|thumb|Herding sheep in Austria]]\n\nFood is passed from the kitchen to the stube, where the dining room table is placed. Some meals are communal, such as [[fondue]], where a pot is set in the middle of the table for each person to dip into. Other meals are still served traditionally on carved wooden plates. Furniture has been traditionally elaborately carved, and in many Alpine countries, carpentry skills are passed from generation to generation.\n[[File:Toit de Lauzes.jpg|thumb|left|Alpine chalet being built in Haute-Maurienne (Savoy), the use of thick pieces of [[orthogneiss]] (4\u20137&nbsp;cm) is per the strict architectural regulations in the region bordering the national parks of Vanoise-Grand Paradis.]]\nRoofs are traditionally constructed from Alpine rocks such as pieces of [[schist]], gneiss or [[slate]].<ref>Shoumataff (2001), 131, 134</ref> Such chalets are typically found in the higher parts of the valleys, as in the [[Maurienne]] valley in [[Savoy]], where the amount of snow during the cold months is essential.

Extreme shortening <!-- why shortening? --> caused by the event resulted in marine [[sedimentary rock]]s rising by [[thrust fault|thrusting]] and [[Fold (geology)|folding]] into high mountain peaks such as [[Mont Blanc]] and the [[Matterhorn]]. Mont Blanc spans the French\u2013Italian border, and at {{convert|4809|m|abbr=on|0}} is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than [[List of Alpine four-thousanders|{{convert|4000|m|ft}}]].\n\nThe altitude and size of the range affects the climate in Europe; in the mountains precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones. Wildlife such as [[ibex]] live in the higher peaks to elevations of {{convert|3400|m|abbr=on|0}}, and plants such as [[Edelweiss]] grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations. Evidence of human habitation in the Alps goes back to the [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic]] era. A [[\u00d6tzi the Iceman|mummified man]], determined to be 5,000 years old, was discovered on a glacier at the Austrian\u2013Italian border in 1991.\n\nBy the 6th century BC, the Celtic [[La T\u00e8ne culture]] was well established. [[Hannibal]] famously crossed the Alps with a herd of elephants, and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had settlements in the region. In 1800, [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] crossed one of the mountain passes with an army of 40,000. The 18th and 19th centuries saw an influx of naturalists, writers, and artists, in particular, the [[Romanticism|Romantics]], followed by the [[golden age of alpinism]] as mountaineers began to ascend the peaks.\n\nThe Alpine region has a strong cultural identity. The traditional culture of farming, cheesemaking, and woodworking still exists in Alpine villages, although the tourist industry began to grow early in the 20th century and expanded greatly after World War II to become the dominant industry by the end of the century. The [[Winter Olympic Games]] have been hosted in the Swiss, French, Italian, Austrian and German Alps.

Similarly, the river god [[Alpheus (deity)]] also derives from the greek 'alphos' and means whitish.\n\nIn his commentary on the ''Aeneid'' of [[Vergil]], the late fourth-century grammarian [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]] says that all high mountains are called ''Alpes'' by Celts.<ref>{{cite book |author=Maurus Servius Honoratus |title=Servii Grammatici qui feruntur in Vergilii carmina commentarii |chapter=Book 10, line 13 |chapter-url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053%3Abook%3D10%3Acommline%3D13 |language=Latin |editor=Georgius Thilo}}</ref> The term may be common to [[Italo-Celtic]], because the [[Celtic languages]] have terms for high mountains derived from ''alp''.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}. \n\nThis may be consistent with the theory that in Greek ''Alpes'' is a name of non-Indo-European origin (which is common for prominent mountains and mountain ranges in the Mediterranean region). According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the Latin ''Alpes'' might possibly derive from a [[Pre-Indo-European languages|pre-Indo-European]] word *''alb'' \"hill\"; \"Albania\" is a related derivation. Albania, a name not native to the region known as the country of [[Albania]], has been used as a name for a number of mountainous areas across Europe.

In the 8th to 6th centuries BC during the [[Hallstatt culture]], Celtic tribes mined copper; later the Romans mined gold for coins in the [[Bad Gastein]] area. [[Erzberg]] in [[Styria]] furnishes high-quality iron ore for the steel industry. Crystals are found throughout much of the Alpine region such as [[cinnabar]], [[amethyst]], and [[quartz]]. The cinnabar deposits in Slovenia are a notable source of cinnabar pigments.<ref>Shoumatoff (2001), 49\u201353</ref>\n\nAlpine crystals have been studied and collected for hundreds of years, and began to be classified in the 18th century. [[Leonhard Euler]] studied the shapes of crystals, and by the 19th century crystal hunting was common in Alpine regions. David Friedrich Wiser amassed a collection of 8000 crystals that he studied and documented. In the 20th century Robert Parker wrote a well-known work about the rock crystals of the Swiss Alps; at the same period a commission was established to control and standardize the naming of Alpine minerals.<ref>Roth, 10\u201317</ref>\n\n== Glaciers ==\n{{see also|List of glaciers in Switzerland}}\n[[File:Illustration_of_the_Glacier_System_of_the_Alps_by_Alexander_Keith_Johnston_1848.png|thumb|upright=1.8|right|This ''Illustration of the Glacier Systems of the Alps'' by [[Alexander Keith Johnston (1804\u20131871)|Alexander Keith Johnston]] was first published 1848 in ''The Physical Atlas''.]]\nIn the [[Miocene]] Epoch the mountains underwent severe erosion because of glaciation,<ref name=\"Gerrard16\" /> which was noted in the mid-19th century by naturalist [[Louis Agassiz]] who presented a paper proclaiming the Alps were covered in ice at various intervals\u2014a theory he formed when studying rocks near his [[Neuch\u00e2tel]] home which he believed originated to the west in the Bernese Oberland.

This causes erosion and the formation of valleys over time. The [[Inn (river)|Inn]] valley is an example of a valley carved by glaciers during the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice ages]] with a typical terraced structure caused by erosion. Eroded rocks from the most recent ice age lie at the bottom of the valley while the top of the valley consists of erosion from earlier ice ages.<ref name=\"Shoumatoff63ff\" /> Glacial valleys have characteristically steep walls (reliefs); valleys with lower reliefs and [[Scree|talus slopes]] are remnants of glacial troughs or previously infilled valleys.<ref name=\"Gerrard132\">Gerrard, (1990), 132</ref> [[Moraine]]s, piles of rock picked up during the movement of the glacier, accumulate at edges, centre and the terminus of glaciers.<ref name=\"Shoumatoff63ff\" />\n\n[[File:Jungfraujoch img 3699.jpg|thumb|Inside a glacier at the top of the train station at the [[Jungfraujoch]]]]\n\nAlpine glaciers can be straight rivers of ice, long sweeping rivers, spread in a fan-like shape (Piedmont glaciers), and curtains of ice that hang from vertical slopes of the mountain peaks. The stress of the movement causes the ice to break and crack loudly, perhaps explaining why the mountains were believed to be home to dragons in the medieval period. The cracking creates unpredictable and dangerous [[crevasse]]s, often invisible under new snowfall, which cause the greatest danger to mountaineers.<ref name=\"Shoumatoff71ff\"/>\n\nGlaciers end in ice caves (the [[Rh\u00f4ne Glacier]]), by trailing into a lake or river, or by shedding snowmelt on a meadow.

For example, each year more water is diverted from rivers for [[snowmaking]] in the ski resorts, the effect of which is yet unknown.

Elevations around the world that have cold climates similar to those of the [[polar region]]s have been called [[Alpine climate|Alpine]]. A rise from sea level into the upper regions of the atmosphere causes the temperature to decrease (see [[adiabatic lapse rate]]). The effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of temperature, often accompanied by precipitation in the form of snow or rain.{{sfn|Knox|1911|p=737}} The height of the Alps is sufficient to divide the weather patterns in Europe into a wet north and a dry south because moisture is sucked from the air as it flows over the high peaks.<ref>Fleming (2000), 3</ref>\n\n[[File:Aletschgletscher mit Pinus cembra1.jpg|thumb|The [[Aletsch Glacier]] with pine trees growing on the hillside (2007; the surface is {{convert|180|m|abbr=on}} lower than 150 years ago)]]\n\nThe severe weather in the Alps has been studied since the 18th century; particularly the weather patterns such as the seasonal [[foehn wind]]. Numerous weather stations were placed in the mountains early in the early 20th century, providing continuous data for climatologists.<ref name=\"Ceben 22\u201324\">Ceben (1998), 22\u201324</ref> Some of the valleys are quite arid such as the [[Aosta]] valley in Italy, the [[Maurienne]] in France, the [[Valais]] in Switzerland, and northern [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]].<ref name=\"Ceben 22\u201324\" />\n\nThe areas that are not arid and receive high precipitation experience periodic flooding from rapid snowmelt and runoff.<ref name=\"Ceben 1998, 31\"/> The mean precipitation in the Alps ranges from a low of {{convert|2600|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year to {{convert|3600|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year, with the higher levels occurring at high altitudes. At altitudes between {{convert|1000|and|3,000|m|abbr=on|}}, snowfall begins in November and accumulates through to April or May when the melt begins. [[Snow line]]s vary from {{convert|2400|to|3,000|m|abbr=on|}}, above which the snow is permanent and the temperatures hover around the freezing point even during July and August. High-water levels in streams and rivers peak in June and July when the snow is still melting at the higher altitudes.<ref>Ceben (1998), 34\u201336</ref>\n\nThe Alps are split into five climatic zones, each with different vegetation. The climate, plant life and animal life vary among the different sections or zones of the mountains. The lowest zone is the colline zone, which exists between {{convert|500|and|1000|m|abbr=on|}}, depending on the location.

(2010), 14</ref> Farming and forestry continue to be mainstays of Alpine culture, industries that provide for export to the cities and maintain the mountain ecology.<ref name=\"Chartes et. el. 2010, 5\">Chartes et. el. (2010), 5</ref>\n\n[[File:Hallstatt - Nordansicht.JPG|thumb|[[Hallstatt]] is known for its production of salt, dating back to prehistoric times.]]\nMuch of the Alpine culture is unchanged since the medieval period when skills that guaranteed survival in the mountain valleys and in the highest villages became mainstays, leading to strong traditions of carpentry, woodcarving, baking and pastry-making, and cheesemaking.<ref name = \"Shoumatoff123ff\">Shoumataff (2001), 123\u2013126</ref>\n\nFarming had been a traditional occupation for centuries, although it became less dominant in the 20th century with the advent of tourism. Grazing and pasture land are limited because of the steep and rocky topography of the Alps. In mid-June cows are moved to the highest pastures close to the snowline, where they are watched by herdsmen who stay in the high altitudes often living in stone huts or wooden barns during the summers.<ref name = \"Shoumatoff123ff\"/> Villagers celebrate the day the cows are herded up to the pastures and again when they return in mid-September. The [[Almabtrieb|Almabtrieb, Alpabzug, Alpabfahrt, D\u00e9salpes]] (\"coming down from the alps\") is celebrated by decorating the cows with garlands and enormous [[cowbell]]s while the farmers dress in traditional costumes.<ref name = \"Shoumatoff123ff\"/>\n\n[[File:LeMonal-fontaine-chapelle-Savoie.JPG|thumb|left|In the summers the cows are brought up to the high mountain meadows for grazing. Small summer villages such as this one shown in this photograph taken in [[Savoie]] are used.]]\n\nCheesemaking is an ancient tradition in most Alpine countries. A wheel of cheese from the [[Emmental]] in Switzerland can weigh up to {{convert|45|kg|abbr=on|-1}}, and the [[Beaufort cheese|Beaufort]] in [[Savoy]] can weigh up to {{convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on|-1}}. Owners of the cows traditionally receive from the cheesemakers a portion in relation to the proportion of the cows' milk from the summer months in the high alps. Haymaking is an important farming activity in mountain villages which has become somewhat mechanized in recent years, although the slopes are so steep that usually scythes are necessary to cut the grass. Hay is normally brought in twice a year, often also on festival days.<ref name = \"Shoumatoff123ff\"/> Alpine festivals vary from country to country and often include the display of local costumes such as [[dirndl]] and [[tracht]]en, the playing of [[Alpenhorn]]s, wrestling matches, some pagan traditions such as [[Walpurgis Night]] and, in many areas, [[Carnival]] is celebrated before [[Lent]].<ref>Shoumataff (2001), 129, 135</ref>\n\nIn the high villages people live in homes built according to medieval designs that withstand cold winters. The kitchen is separated from the living area (called the ''stube'', the area of the home heated by a stove), and second-floor bedrooms benefit from rising heat. The typical Swiss [[chalet]] originated in the Bernese Oberland. Chalets often face south or downhill, and are built of solid wood, with a steeply gabled roof to allow accumulated snow to slide off easily. Stairs leading to upper levels are sometimes built on the outside, and balconies are sometimes enclosed.<ref name = \"Shoumatoff123ff\"/><ref>Shoumataff (2001), 134</ref>\n[[File:Schaufschod 2009 05.JPG|thumb|Herding sheep in Austria]]\n\nFood is passed from the kitchen to the stube, where the dining room table is placed. Some meals are communal, such as [[fondue]], where a pot is set in the middle of the table for each person to dip into. Other meals are still served in a traditional manner on carved wooden plates. Furniture has been traditionally elaborately carved and in many Alpine countries carpentry skills are passed from generation to generation.\n[[File:Toit de Lauzes.jpg|thumb|left|Alpine chalet being built in Haute-Maurienne (Savoy), the use of thick pieces of [[orthogneiss]] (4\u20137&nbsp;cm) is in accordance with the strict architural regulations in the region bordering the national parks of Vanoise-Grand Paradis.]]\nRoofs are traditionally constructed from Alpine rocks such as pieces of [[schist]], gneiss or [[slate]].<ref>Shoumataff (2001), 131, 134</ref> Such chalets are typically found in the higher parts of the valleys, as in the [[Maurienne]] valley in [[Savoy]], where the amount of snow during the cold months is important. The inclination of the roof cannot exceed 40%, allowing the snow to stay on top, thereby functioning as insulation from the cold.<ref>[http://www.cauesavoie.org/wp-content/uploads/Fascicule-haute-maurienne.pdf Cahier d'architecture Haute Maurienne/Vanoise]</ref> In the lower areas where the forests are widespread, wooden tiles are traditionally used.

Dialects are common, and vary from valley to valley and region to region. In the Slavic Alps alone 19 dialects have been identified. Some of the French dialects spoken in the French, Swiss and Italian alps of [[Aosta Valley]] derive from [[Arpitan]], while the southern part of the western range is related to [[Occitan language|Old Proven\u00e7al]]; the German dialects derive from Germanic tribal languages.<ref name=\"Shoumataff 2001, 114\u2013166\">Shoumataff (2001), 114\u2013166</ref> [[Romansh language|Romansh]], spoken by two percent of the population in southeast Switzerland, is an ancient [[Rhaeto-Romance languages|Rhaeto-Romanic language]] derived from Latin, remnants of ancient Celtic languages and perhaps [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]].<ref name=\"Shoumataff 2001, 114\u2013166\"/>\n\n== Tourism ==\n{{further|Tourism in Austria|Tourism in France|Tourism in Italy|Tourism in Slovenia|Tourism in Switzerland|}}\n[[File:Speikboden gebiet.jpg|thumb|The ski resort in [[Speikboden (South Tyrol)|Speikboden]], South Tyrol, Italy]]\n\nThe Alps are one of the more popular tourist destinations in the world with many resorts such [[Oberstdorf]], in Bavaria, [[Saalbach-Hinterglemm|Saalbach]] in Austria, [[Davos]] in Switzerland, [[Chamonix]] in France, and [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]] in Italy recording more than a million annual visitors.

Originally published in 1986 as Allied Procedural Publication 6 (APP-6), '''NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems''', the standard has evolved over the years and is currently in its fourth version (APP-6C). The symbols are designed to enhance [[NATO]]'s [[joint interoperability]] by providing a standard set of common symbols. APP-6 constituted a single system of joint military symbology for land, air, space and sea-based formations and units, which can be displayed for either automated map display systems or for manual map marking. It covers all of the joint services and can be used by them.\n\n==History==\nThe first basic military map symbols began to be used by western armies in the decades following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During [[World War I]], there was a degree of harmonisation between the British and French systems, including the adoption of the colour red for enemy forces and blue for allies; the British had previously used red for friendly troops because of the traditional red coats of British soldiers. However, the system now in use is broadly based on that devised by the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] in 1917. The infantry symbol of a saltire in a rectangle was said to symbolise the crossed belts of an infantryman, while the single diagonal line for cavalry was said to represent the sabre belt. With the formation of NATO in 1949, the US Army system was standardized and adapted, with different shapes for friendly (blue rectangle), hostile (red diamond) and unknown (yellow [[quatrefoil]]) forces.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hershey|first=Andrew|date=2012|title=Not Just Lines on a Map: A History of Military Mapping|url=http://strategyandtacticsmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ST274-p22-27.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=Strategy & Tactics|volume=274|pages=22\u201327|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107184638/http://strategyandtacticsmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ST274-p22-27.pdf|archive-date=January 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAPP-6A was promulgated in December 1999. The NATO standardization agreement that covers APP-6A is ''[[STANAG]] 2019'' (edition 4), promulgated in December 2000. APP-6A replaced ''APP-6'' (last version<!-- change 2 -->, July 1986), which had been promulgated in November 1984 (edition 3<!-- Also Edition 3 Amendment 1 (1990) --> of STANAG 2019 covered APP-6<!--\nNote:\nAPP-6 (1986) mentions that it \"replaces STANAG 2019 (Edition 2) ''Military Symbols'', which was designed for manual map marking.\"  Odds are that STANAG 2019 editions 1 or 2 promulgated [[Q-STAG]] 509 ''Military Symbols'', which dates back to the mid-1970s\n-->), and was replaced in turn by ''Joint Symbology APP-6(B)'' ([[APP-6B]]) in 2008 (STANAG 2019 edition 5, June 2008) and ''NATO Joint Military Symbology APP-6(C)'' ([[APP-6C]]) in 2011 (STANAG 2019 edition 6, May 2011).\n\nThe U.S. is the current custodian of APP-6A, which is equivalent to [[NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems#MIL-STD-2525A|MIL-STD-2525A]].\n\n==Symbol sets==\nThe APP-6A standard provides common operational symbology along with details on their display and plotting to ensure the compatibility, and to the greatest extent possible, the interoperability of NATO land component ''command, control, communications, computer, and intelligence'' (C4I) systems, development, operations, and training. APP-6A addresses the efficient transmission of symbology information through the use of a standard methodology for symbol hierarchy, information taxonomy, and symbol identifiers.\n\nAPP-6A recognises five broad ''sets'' of symbols, each set using its own SIDC (Symbol identification coding) scheme:\n\n* Units, equipment, and installations\n* Military operations (tactical graphics)\n* METOC (meteorological and oceanographic)\n* Signals intelligence\n* MOOTW (military operations other than war)\n\n''Units, equipment, and installations'' consist of icons, generally framed, associated with a single point on the map. All sorts of graphical and textual modifiers may surround them, specifying categories, quantities, dates, direction of movement, etc.\n\n''Tactical graphics'' represent operational information that cannot be presented via icon-based symbols alone: unit boundaries, special area designations, and other unique markings related to battlespace geometry and necessary for battlefield planning and management. There are point, line and area symbols in this category.\n\n''Meteorological'' and ''oceanographic'' symbology is the only set not under the standard's control: rather, they are imported from the symbology established by the [[World Meteorological Organization]].\n\nThe ''signals intelligence'' and ''military operations other than war'' symbology sets stand apart from Units, Equipment, and Installations although they obey the same conventions (i.e., they consist of framed symbols associated to points on the map). They do not appear in APP-6A proper, having been introduced by MIL-STD-2525B.\n\n==Symbol composition==\nMost of the symbols designate specific points, and consist of a ''frame'' (a geometric border), a ''fill'', a constituent ''icon'', and optional symbol ''modifiers''. The latter are optional text fields or graphic indicators that provide additional information.\n\nThe frame provides a visual indication of the affiliation, battle dimension, and status of an operational object. The use of shape and colour is redundant, allowing the symbology to be used under less-than-ideal conditions such as a monochrome red display to preserve the operator's night vision. Nearly all symbols are highly stylised and can be drawn by persons almost entirely lacking in artistic skill; this allows one to draw a symbolic representation (a GRAPHREP, Graphical report) using tools as rudimentary as plain paper and pencil.\n\nThe frame serves as the base to which other symbol components and modifiers are added. In most cases a frame surrounds an icon. One major exception is equipment, which may be represented by icons alone (in which case the icons are coloured as the frame would be).\n\nThe fill is the area within a symbol. If the fill is assigned a colour, it provides an enhanced (redundant) presentation of information about the affiliation of the object. If colour is not used, the fill is transparent. A very few icons have fills of their own, which are not affected by affiliation.\n\nThe icons themselves, finally, can be understood as combinations of elementary glyphs that use simple composition rules, in a manner reminiscent of some ideographic writing systems such as [[Chinese (language)|Chinese]]. The standard, however, still attempts to provide an \"exhaustive\" listing of possible icons instead of laying out a dictionary of component glyphs. This causes operational problems when the need for an unforeseen symbol arises (particularly in MOOTW), a problem exacerbated by the administratively centralised maintenance of the symbology sets.\n\nWhen rendering symbols with the fill on, APP-6A calls for the frame and icon to be black or white (as appropriate for the display). When rendering symbols with the fill off, APP-6A calls for a monochrome frame and icon (usually black or in accordance with the affiliation colour). NATO symbols can also be rendered with fill off using a frame coloured according to affiliation and a black icon,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://army.ca/wiki/images/8/80/NATO_Map_Symbol_(Canadian)_Programmed_Instruction_Package_Jan_2000.pdf|title=NATO Map Symbol Programmed Instruction Package|date=Jan 2000|publisher=Canadian Forces School of Military Intelligence|page=6|access-date=Nov 14, 2018}}</ref> though this is not defined in any APP-6 standard.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry - Friendly - Fill On.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill on\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry - Friendly - Monochrome Colour.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill off and monochrome colour frame and icon\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry - Friendly - Monochrome B&W.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill off and monochrome frame and icon\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill off and bichrome frame and icon\n</gallery>\n\n==Affiliation==\n''Affiliation'' refers to the relationship of the tracker to the operational object being represented. The basic affiliation categories are ''unknown'', ''friend'', [[Neutral country|''neutral'']], and ''hostile''. In the ground unit domain, a yellow [[quatrefoil]] frame is used to denote unknown affiliation, a blue rectangle frame to denote friendly affiliation, a green square frame to denote neutral affiliation, and a red diamond frame to denote hostile affiliation.<ref name=\"APP1986\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/NATO_Symbols/APP-6.pdf|title=APP-6 Military Symbols For Land Based Symbols|last=Korkolis|first=M.|date=July 1986|website=alternatewars.com|access-date=Nov 14, 2018}}</ref>{{rp|11}} In the other domains (air and space, sea surface and subsurface, etc.), the same color scheme is used.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|-\n!

Instead, the original APP-6 described a series of \"colour representations\" with the purpose of distinguishing friendly and enemy elements.\n\n*Multi-colour representation: \n**Blue or black for friendly icons\n**Red for enemy icons\n**Green for man-made obstacles (friendly or enemy)\n**Yellow for chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear events\n**Other colours to be established in a map legend\n*tri-colour representation: \n**Blue or black for friendly icons\n**Red for enemy icons\n**Green or yellow for man-made obstacles (friendly or enemy) and for chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear events\n*two colour representation: \n**Blue, Green, or black for friendly icons\n**Red for enemy icons\n*One colour representation:\n**Single line border for friendly icons\n**double line border for enemy icons, and unbordered icons were labeled with \"EN\" to the lower right corner\n\n<gallery>\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Friendly Unit.svg|APP-6 friendly unit (colour)\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Hostile Unit (Old).svg|APP-6 enemy unit (colour)\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Friendly Unit - B&W.svg|APP-6 friendly unit (B&W)\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Hostile Unit - B&W (Old).svg|APP-6 enemy unit (B&W)\n</gallery>\n\n==Battle dimension==\n''Battle dimension'' defines the primary mission area for the operational object within the battlespace. An object can have a mission area above the Earth's surface (i.e., in the air or outer space), on it, or below it. If the mission area of an object is on the surface, it can be either on land or sea. The subsurface dimension concerns those objects whose mission area is below the sea surface (e.g., submarines and sea mines). Some cases require adjudication; for example, an Army or Marine helicopter unit is a manoeuvring unit (i.e., a unit whose ground support assets are included) and is thus represented in the land dimension. Likewise, a landing craft whose primary mission is ferrying personnel or equipment to and from shore is a maritime unit and is represented in the sea surface dimension. A landing craft whose primary mission is to fight on land, on the other hand, is a ground asset and is represented in the\nland dimension.\n\nClosed frames are used to denote the land and sea surface dimensions, frames open at the bottom denote the air/space dimension, and frames open at the top denote the subsurface dimension.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|-\n!

Special Forces may operate in any dimension.\n\nThe full set of battle dimensions is, in ascending order of distance from Earth center:\n* SOF (F)\n* Sea subsurface (U)\n* Sea surface (S)\n* Ground (G)\n* Air (A)\n* Space (P)\n* Other (X)\n* Unknown (Z)\nThe mnemonic for this ordering is \"Fuss-Gap\".\n\nThe letter in parentheses is used by the symbol identification coding (SIDC) scheme \u2014 strings of 15 characters used to transmit symbols.\n\nThe space and air battle dimensions share a single frame shape. In the ground battle dimension, two different frames are used for the friendly (and assumed friendly) affiliations in order to distinguish between units and equipment. The SOF (special operations forces) are assigned their own battle dimension because they typically can operate across several domains (air, ground, sea surface and subsurface) in the course of a single mission; the frames are the same as for the ground (unit) battle dimension.<ref name=\"APP2005\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapsymbs.com/APP-6ADRDCValcartierEdition121(Mod).pdf|title=Commented APP-6A - Military symbols for land based systems|last=Thibault|first=D.

This octagon is not actually shown when symbols are drawn or rendered but, with a few defined exceptions, all icons inside the frame would also fit inside these octagons. APP-6C modified some symbol frames from previous editions of the standard. From top to bottom, here is the symbol boundary shown inside the APP-6C frames of space elements, air elements, land units, land equipment and surface sea elements, and sub-surface sea elements.\n \n[[Image:NATO Map Symbol - Symbol Size boundary (APP-6C).svg|500px]]\n\n==Unit icons==\nThe icon is the innermost part of a symbol which, when displayed, provides an abstract pictorial or alphanumeric representation of an operational object. The icon portrays the role or mission performed by the object. APP-6A distinguishes between icons that must be framed or unframed and icons where framing is optional.<ref name=APP1986/>{{rp|39\u201343}}\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|-\n!Friendly unit symbol  || Hostile unit symbol  || Neutral unit symbol  || Unknown unit symbol  || Unit type\n|-\n|<div style=\"position:relative;

Neither the actual rank designated for a particular unit's commander, nor the rank held by the incumbent commander alters the appropriate symbol. For example, units are periodically commanded by an officer junior to the authorised commander grade, yet a company under the command of a Lieutenant (U.S.) or Captain (Commonwealth) is still indicated with two vertical ticks. Likewise, some peculiar types of companies and detachments are authorised a Major, Lieutenant Colonel (personnel services companies) or Colonel (some types of judge advocate detachments); the company or detachment is nevertheless indicated with, respectively, one vertical tick or three dots.\n\nWhile in Commonwealth armies, the regiment as a tactical formation does not normally exist, in some cases a regimental sized (i.e. larger than battalion and smaller than brigade) Task Force may exist where the operational requirement exists. These formations may be commanded by Colonels.\n\nNote that, for brigades and higher, the number of Xs corresponds to the number of stars in the United States military's insignia for the typical general officer grade commanding that size unit. For example, a division is capped with XX and is usually commanded by a major general the American insignia for which is two stars.\n\n==Status==\nThe ''status'' of a symbol refers to whether a warfighting object exists at the location identified (i.e., status is \"present\") or will in the future reside at that location (i.e., status is \"planned, anticipated, suspected,\" or \"on order\"). Regardless of affiliation, present status is indicated by a solid line and planned status by a dashed line. The frame is solid or dashed, unless the symbol icon is unframed, in which case the icon itself is drawn dashed. Planned status cannot be shown if the symbol is an unframed filled icon.\n\n==Symbol modifiers==\nAPP-6A stops with field AB. MIL-STD-2525B and 2525B Change 1 add a number of other modifiers.\n\n[[Image:APP-6A Field positions.svg|thumb|200px|Positions of the various graphic modifiers around the symbol (itself field A). MIL-STD-2525B Change 1 fails to specify where to place fields AD, AE, and AF.]]\n\n===Graphic modifiers===\n*''Echelon'' (field B) Identifies command level (see [[#Unit sizes|Unit sizes]], above).\n*''Task force'' (field D) Identifies a unit as a task force. It may be used alone or in combination with Echelon, like so: [[Image:Brigade Task Force.svg|19px]]<!--- scale is 1:66.666...px --->\n*''Frame shape modifier'' (field E) A short textual modifier that completes the affiliation, battle dimension, or exercise description of an object (\"U\", \"?\", \"X\", \"XU\", \"X?\", \"J\" or \"K\"). It is treated as a graphic modifier, however.\n*''Direction of movement'' (field Q) A fixed-length arrow that identifies the direction of movement or intended movement of an object. It emanates from the symbol's centre except in the ground domain, where it is hooked to a short offset, straight down from the symbol's base centre (see diagram).\n*''Mobility indicator'' (field R) Depicts the mobility of an object (see [[#Mobility and auxiliary equipment|Mobility]], below). It is used only with equipment.\n*''Headquarters staff'' or ''offset location'' (field S) Identifies a unit as a headquarters, or indicates the object's actual location on the map when it has been shifted away in order to declutter the display. It goes straight down from the symbol's centre left, then angles towards the actual location (see diagram).\n*''Feint/dummy'' (field AB) Identifies a unit intended to draw the enemy's attention away from the area of the main attack, or a decoy designed to fool enemy intelligence. It consists of a dashed chevron, placed above the frame, like the echelon graphic modifier (the standard is unclear as to how the two combine graphically). See [[#Feints/dummies and installations|Feints/Dummies]], below.\n*''Installation'' (field AC) Identifies a particular symbol as an installation. It sits atop the frame. See [[#Feints/dummies and installations|Installations]], below.\n*''Auxiliary equipment'' (field AG) Indicates the presence of a towed sonar array (used exclusively in the sea surface or subsurface battle dimensions). It sits below the frame, like field R (see [[#Mobility and auxiliary equipment|Auxiliary equipment]], below).\n*''Area of uncertainty'' (field AH) Indicates the area where an object is most likely to be, based on the object's last report and the reporting accuracy of the sensor that detected it. This can take various forms, such as an ellipse, a bounding box, or lines indicating probable bearing and distance.\n*''Dead reckoning trailer'' (field AI) Identifies where an object should be located at present, given its last reported course and speed. This can take the form of a dotted line (extending from the symbol to the dead-reckoned position) or a dotted circle (bounding the zone the object may have reached since, when the direction of movement is unknown or uncertain).\n*''Speed leader'' (field AJ) Depicts the speed and direction of movement of an object. It is identical to the Direction of Movement indicator except that its length is variable (and there is no arrow head).\n*''Pairing line'' (field AK) Connects two objects.\n\n====Feints/dummies and installations====\n'''Source:'''<ref name=APP2005/>{{rp|288}}\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"<!--- scale is 1:66.666...px --->\n|-\n!

MIL-STD 2525A was the American standard for military symbols. The custodian of APP-6 is the United States. APP-6(A) remained unchanged as work on harmonizing it with ADatP-3, ''NATO Message Text Formatting System'' was carried out. In 1999, APP-6 was moved from the Army Service Board to the Joint Service Board. With this move, APP-6 was placed under the Information Exchange Requirements Harmonization/Message Text Format Working Group. The IERH/MTFWG then formed the Joint Symbology Panel to provide configuration management of APP-6 with the US custodian as the chairman. With the ratification and promulgation of APP-6(B) in 2008, the named was changed to ''NATO Military Symbology'' to better reflect the nature of the publication. In 2011, with the introduction of APP-6(C), the named was changed to ''NATO Joint Military Symbology''. The US military required new symbols to support ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, so the pace of change between APP-6 and MIL-STD-2525 remained uneven until 2009. In 2009, a new chairman for DOD Symbology Standardization Management Committee was appointed, and the two configuration management organizations began to work together. The two organizations held joint meetings with full participation on both sides. The goal of both groups is to develop comprehensive joint military symbology that is common to both organizations to the greatest extent possible. APP-6(C) began the process of changing the format of the publications and introduced new symbol identification codes.

Originally published in 1986 as Allied Procedural Publication 6 (APP-6), '''NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems''', the standard has evolved over the years and is currently in its fourth version (APP-6C). The symbols are designed to enhance [[NATO]]'s [[joint interoperability]] by providing a standard set of common symbols. APP-6 constituted a single system of joint military symbology for land, air, space and sea-based formations and units, which can be displayed for either automated map display systems or for manual map marking. It covers all of the joint services and can be used by them.\n\n==History==\nThe first basic military map symbols began to be used by western armies in the decades following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During [[World War I]], there was a degree of harmonisation between the British and French systems, including the adoption of the colour red for enemy forces and blue for allies; the British had previously used red for friendly troops because of the traditional red coats of British soldiers. However, the system now in use is broadly based on that devised by the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] in 1917. The infantry symbol of a saltire in a rectangle was said to symbolise the crossed belts of an infantryman, while the single diagonal line for cavalry was said to represent the sabre belt. With the formation of NATO in 1949, the US Army system was standardized and adapted, with different shapes for friendly (blue rectangle), hostile (red diamond) and unknown (yellow [[quatrefoil]]) forces.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hershey|first=Andrew|date=2012|title=Not Just Lines on a Map: A History of Military Mapping|url=http://strategyandtacticsmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ST274-p22-27.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=Strategy & Tactics|volume=274|pages=22\u201327|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107184638/http://strategyandtacticsmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ST274-p22-27.pdf|archive-date=January 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAPP-6A was promulgated in December 1999. The NATO standardization agreement that covers APP-6A is ''[[STANAG]] 2019'' (edition 4), promulgated in December 2000. APP-6A replaced ''APP-6'' (last version<!-- change 2 -->, July 1986), which had been promulgated in November 1984 (edition 3<!-- Also Edition 3 Amendment 1 (1990) --> of STANAG 2019 covered APP-6<!--\nNote:\nAPP-6 (1986) mentions that it \"replaces STANAG 2019 (Edition 2) ''Military Symbols'', which was designed for manual map marking.\"  Odds are that STANAG 2019 editions 1 or 2 promulgated [[Q-STAG]] 509 ''Military Symbols'', which dates back to the mid-1970s\n-->), and was replaced in turn by ''Joint Symbology APP-6(B)'' ([[APP-6B]]) in 2008 (STANAG 2019 edition 5, June 2008) and ''NATO Joint Military Symbology APP-6(C)'' ([[APP-6C]]) in 2011 (STANAG 2019 edition 6, May 2011).\n\nThe U.S. is the current custodian of APP-6A, which is equivalent to [[NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems#MIL-STD-2525A|MIL-STD-2525A]].\n\n==Symbol sets==\nThe APP-6A standard provides common operational symbology along with details on their display and plotting to ensure the compatibility, and to the greatest extent possible, the interoperability of NATO land component ''command, control, communications, computer, and intelligence'' (C4I) systems, development, operations, and training. APP-6A addresses the efficient transmission of symbology information through the use of a standard methodology for symbol hierarchy, information taxonomy, and symbol identifiers.\n\nAPP-6A recognises five broad ''sets'' of symbols, each set using its own SIDC (Symbol identification coding) scheme:\n\n* Units, equipment, and installations\n* Military operations (tactical graphics)\n* METOC (meteorological and oceanographic)\n* Signals intelligence\n* MOOTW (military operations other than war)\n\n''Units, equipment, and installations'' consist of icons, generally framed, associated with a single point on the map. All sorts of graphical and textual modifiers may surround them, specifying categories, quantities, dates, direction of movement, etc.\n\n''Tactical graphics'' represent operational information that cannot be presented via icon-based symbols alone: unit boundaries, special area designations, and other unique markings related to battlespace geometry and necessary for battlefield planning and management. There are point, line and area symbols in this category.\n\n''Meteorological'' and ''oceanographic'' symbology is the only set not under the standard's control: rather, they are imported from the symbology established by the [[World Meteorological Organization]].\n\nThe ''signals intelligence'' and ''military operations other than war'' symbology sets stand apart from Units, Equipment, and Installations although they obey the same conventions (i.e., they consist of framed symbols associated to points on the map). They do not appear in APP-6A proper, having been introduced by MIL-STD-2525B.\n\n==Symbol composition==\nMost of the symbols designate specific points, and consist of a ''frame'' (a geometric border), a ''fill'', a constituent ''icon'', and optional symbol ''modifiers''. The latter are optional text fields or graphic indicators that provide additional information.\n\nThe frame provides a visual indication of the affiliation, battle dimension, and status of an operational object. The use of shape and colour is redundant, allowing the symbology to be used under less-than-ideal conditions such as a monochrome red display to preserve the operator's night vision. Nearly all symbols are highly stylised and can be drawn by persons almost entirely lacking in artistic skill; this allows one to draw a symbolic representation (a GRAPHREP, Graphical report) using tools as rudimentary as plain paper and pencil.\n\nThe frame serves as the base to which other symbol components and modifiers are added. In most cases a frame surrounds an icon. One major exception is equipment, which may be represented by icons alone (in which case the icons are coloured as the frame would be).\n\nThe fill is the area within a symbol. If the fill is assigned a colour, it provides an enhanced (redundant) presentation of information about the affiliation of the object. If colour is not used, the fill is transparent. A very few icons have fills of their own, which are not affected by affiliation.\n\nThe icons themselves, finally, can be understood as combinations of elementary glyphs that use simple composition rules, in a manner reminiscent of some ideographic writing systems such as [[Chinese (language)|Chinese]]. The standard, however, still attempts to provide an \"exhaustive\" listing of possible icons instead of laying out a dictionary of component glyphs. This causes operational problems when the need for an unforeseen symbol arises (particularly in MOOTW), a problem exacerbated by the administratively centralised maintenance of the symbology sets.\n\nWhen rendering symbols with the fill on, APP-6A calls for the frame and icon to be black or white (as appropriate for the display). When rendering symbols with the fill off, APP-6A calls for a monochrome frame and icon (usually black or in accordance with the affiliation colour). NATO symbols can also be rendered with fill off using a frame coloured according to affiliation and a black icon,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://army.ca/wiki/images/8/80/NATO_Map_Symbol_(Canadian)_Programmed_Instruction_Package_Jan_2000.pdf|title=NATO Map Symbol Programmed Instruction Package|date=Jan 2000|publisher=Canadian Forces School of Military Intelligence|page=6|access-date=Nov 14, 2018}}</ref> though this is not defined in any APP-6 standard.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry - Friendly - Fill On.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill on\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry - Friendly - Monochrome Colour.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill off and monochrome colour frame and icon\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry - Friendly - Monochrome B&W.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill off and monochrome frame and icon\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill off and bichrome frame and icon\n</gallery>\n\n==Affiliation==\n''Affiliation'' refers to the relationship of the tracker to the operational object being represented. The basic affiliation categories are ''unknown'', ''friend'', [[Neutral country|''neutral'']], and ''hostile''. In the ground unit domain, a yellow [[quatrefoil]] frame is used to denote unknown affiliation, a blue rectangle frame to denote friendly affiliation, a green square frame to denote neutral affiliation, and a red diamond frame to denote hostile affiliation.<ref name=\"APP1986\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/NATO_Symbols/APP-6.pdf|title=APP-6 Military Symbols For Land Based Symbols|last=Korkolis|first=M.|date=July 1986|website=alternatewars.com|access-date=Nov 14, 2018}}</ref>{{rp|11}} In the other domains (air and space, sea surface and subsurface, etc.), the same color scheme is used.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|-\n!

Instead, the original APP-6 described a series of \"colour representations\" with the purpose of distinguishing friendly and enemy elements.\n\n*Multi-colour representation: \n**Blue or black for friendly icons\n**Red for enemy icons\n**Green for man-made obstacles (friendly or enemy)\n**Yellow for chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear events\n**Other colours to be established in a map legend\n*tri-colour representation: \n**Blue or black for friendly icons\n**Red for enemy icons\n**Green or yellow for man-made obstacles (friendly or enemy) and for chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear events\n*two colour representation: \n**Blue, Green, or black for friendly icons\n**Red for enemy icons\n*One colour representation:\n**Single line border for friendly icons\n**double line border for enemy icons, and unbordered icons were labeled with \"EN\" to the lower right corner\n\n<gallery>\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Friendly Unit.svg|APP-6 friendly unit (colour)\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Hostile Unit (Old).svg|APP-6 enemy unit (colour)\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Friendly Unit - B&W.svg|APP-6 friendly unit (B&W)\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Hostile Unit - B&W (Old).svg|APP-6 enemy unit (B&W)\n</gallery>\n\n==Battle dimension==\n''Battle dimension'' defines the primary mission area for the operational object within the battlespace. An object can have a mission area above the Earth's surface (i.e., in the air or outer space), on it, or below it. If the mission area of an object is on the surface, it can be either on land or sea. The subsurface dimension concerns those objects whose mission area is below the sea surface (e.g., submarines and sea mines). Some cases require adjudication; for example, an Army or Marine helicopter unit is a manoeuvring unit (i.e., a unit whose ground support assets are included) and is thus represented in the land dimension. Likewise, a landing craft whose primary mission is ferrying personnel or equipment to and from shore is a maritime unit and is represented in the sea surface dimension. A landing craft whose primary mission is to fight on land, on the other hand, is a ground asset and is represented in the\nland dimension.\n\nClosed frames are used to denote the land and sea surface dimensions, frames open at the bottom denote the air/space dimension, and frames open at the top denote the subsurface dimension.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|-\n!

Special Forces may operate in any dimension.\n\nThe full set of battle dimensions is, in ascending order of distance from Earth center:\n* SOF (F)\n* Sea subsurface (U)\n* Sea surface (S)\n* Ground (G)\n* Air (A)\n* Space (P)\n* Other (X)\n* Unknown (Z)\nThe mnemonic for this ordering is \"Fuss-Gap\".\n\nThe letter in parentheses is used by the symbol identification coding (SIDC) scheme \u2014 strings of 15 characters used to transmit symbols.\n\nThe space and air battle dimensions share a single frame shape. In the ground battle dimension, two different frames are used for the friendly (and assumed friendly) affiliations in order to distinguish between units and equipment. The SOF (special operations forces) are assigned their own battle dimension because they typically can operate across several domains (air, ground, sea surface and subsurface) in the course of a single mission; the frames are the same as for the ground (unit) battle dimension.<ref name=\"APP2005\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapsymbs.com/APP-6ADRDCValcartierEdition121(Mod).pdf|title=Commented APP-6A - Military symbols for land based systems|last=Thibault|first=D.

This octagon is not actually shown when symbols are drawn or rendered but, with a few defined exceptions, all icons inside the frame would also fit inside these octagons. APP-6C modified some symbol frames from previous editions of the standard. From top to bottom, here is the symbol boundary shown inside the APP-6C frames of space elements, air elements, land units, land equipment and surface sea elements, and sub-surface sea elements.\n \n[[Image:NATO Map Symbol - Symbol Size boundary (APP-6C).svg|500px]]\n\n==Unit icons==\nThe icon is the innermost part of a symbol which, when displayed, provides an abstract pictorial or alphanumeric representation of an operational object. The icon portrays the role or mission performed by the object. APP-6A distinguishes between icons that must be framed or unframed and icons where framing is optional.<ref name=APP1986/>{{rp|39\u201343}}\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|-\n!Friendly unit symbol  || Hostile unit symbol  || Neutral unit symbol  || Unknown unit symbol  || Unit type\n|-\n|<div style=\"position:relative;

Neither the actual rank designated for a particular unit's commander, nor the rank held by the incumbent commander alters the appropriate symbol. For example, units are periodically commanded by an officer junior to the authorised commander grade, yet a company under the command of a Lieutenant (U.S.) or Captain (Commonwealth) is still indicated with two vertical ticks. Likewise, some peculiar types of companies and detachments are authorised a Major, Lieutenant Colonel (personnel services companies) or Colonel (some types of judge advocate detachments); the company or detachment is nevertheless indicated with, respectively, one vertical tick or three dots.\n\nWhile in Commonwealth armies, the regiment as a tactical formation does not normally exist, in some cases a regimental sized (i.e. larger than battalion and smaller than brigade) Task Force may exist where the operational requirement exists. These formations may be commanded by Colonels.\n\nNote that, for brigades and higher, the number of Xs corresponds to the number of stars in the United States military's insignia for the typical general officer grade commanding that size unit. For example, a division is capped with XX and is usually commanded by a major general the American insignia for which is two stars.\n\n==Status==\nThe ''status'' of a symbol refers to whether a warfighting object exists at the location identified (i.e., status is \"present\") or will in the future reside at that location (i.e., status is \"planned, anticipated, suspected,\" or \"on order\"). Regardless of affiliation, present status is indicated by a solid line and planned status by a dashed line. The frame is solid or dashed, unless the symbol icon is unframed, in which case the icon itself is drawn dashed. Planned status cannot be shown if the symbol is an unframed filled icon.\n\n==Symbol modifiers==\nAPP-6A stops with field AB. MIL-STD-2525B and 2525B Change 1 add a number of other modifiers.\n\n[[Image:APP-6A Field positions.svg|thumb|200px|Positions of the various graphic modifiers around the symbol (itself field A). MIL-STD-2525B Change 1 fails to specify where to place fields AD, AE, and AF.]]\n\n===Graphic modifiers===\n*''Echelon'' (field B) Identifies command level (see [[#Unit sizes|Unit sizes]], above).\n*''Task force'' (field D) Identifies a unit as a task force. It may be used alone or in combination with Echelon, like so: [[Image:Brigade Task Force.svg|19px]]<!--- scale is 1:66.666...px --->\n*''Frame shape modifier'' (field E) A short textual modifier that completes the affiliation, battle dimension, or exercise description of an object (\"U\", \"?\", \"X\", \"XU\", \"X?\", \"J\" or \"K\"). It is treated as a graphic modifier, however.\n*''Direction of movement'' (field Q) A fixed-length arrow that identifies the direction of movement or intended movement of an object. It emanates from the symbol's centre except in the ground domain, where it is hooked to a short offset, straight down from the symbol's base centre (see diagram).\n*''Mobility indicator'' (field R) Depicts the mobility of an object (see [[#Mobility and auxiliary equipment|Mobility]], below). It is used only with equipment.\n*''Headquarters staff'' or ''offset location'' (field S) Identifies a unit as a headquarters, or indicates the object's actual location on the map when it has been shifted away in order to declutter the display. It goes straight down from the symbol's centre left, then angles towards the actual location (see diagram).\n*''Feint/dummy'' (field AB) Identifies a unit intended to draw the enemy's attention away from the area of the main attack, or a decoy designed to fool enemy intelligence. It consists of a dashed chevron, placed above the frame, like the echelon graphic modifier (the standard is unclear as to how the two combine graphically). See [[#Feints/dummies and installations|Feints/Dummies]], below.\n*''Installation'' (field AC) Identifies a particular symbol as an installation. It sits atop the frame. See [[#Feints/dummies and installations|Installations]], below.\n*''Auxiliary equipment'' (field AG) Indicates the presence of a towed sonar array (used exclusively in the sea surface or subsurface battle dimensions). It sits below the frame, like field R (see [[#Mobility and auxiliary equipment|Auxiliary equipment]], below).\n*''Area of uncertainty'' (field AH) Indicates the area where an object is most likely to be, based on the object's last report and the reporting accuracy of the sensor that detected it. This can take various forms, such as an ellipse, a bounding box, or lines indicating probable bearing and distance.\n*''Dead reckoning trailer'' (field AI) Identifies where an object should be located at present, given its last reported course and speed. This can take the form of a dotted line (extending from the symbol to the dead-reckoned position) or a dotted circle (bounding the zone the object may have reached since, when the direction of movement is unknown or uncertain).\n*''Speed leader'' (field AJ) Depicts the speed and direction of movement of an object. It is identical to the Direction of Movement indicator except that its length is variable (and there is no arrow head).\n*''Pairing line'' (field AK) Connects two objects.\n\n====Feints/dummies and installations====\n'''Source:'''<ref name=APP2005/>{{rp|288}}\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"<!--- scale is 1:66.666...px --->\n|-\n!

MIL-STD 2525A was the American standard for military symbols. The custodian of APP-6 is the United States. APP-6(A) remained unchanged as work on harmonizing it with ADatP-3, ''NATO Message Text Formatting System'' was carried out. In 1999, APP-6 was moved from the Army Service Board to the Joint Service Board. With this move, APP-6 was placed under the Information Exchange Requirements Harmonization/Message Text Format Working Group. The IERH/MTFWG then formed the Joint Symbology Panel to provide configuration management of APP-6 with the US custodian as the chairman. With the ratification and promulgation of APP-6(B) in 2008, the named was changed to ''NATO Military Symbology'' to better reflect the nature of the publication. In 2011, with the introduction of APP-6(C), the named was changed to ''NATO Joint Military Symbology''. The US military required new symbols to support ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, so the pace of change between APP-6 and MIL-STD-2525 remained uneven until 2009. In 2009, a new chairman for DOD Symbology Standardization Management Committee was appointed, and the two configuration management organizations began to work together. The two organizations held joint meetings with full participation on both sides. The goal of both groups is to develop comprehensive joint military symbology that is common to both organizations to the greatest extent possible. APP-6(C) began the process of changing the format of the publications and introduced new symbol identification codes.

''Syrische Rechtsbiicher'', 3, Berlin: Georg Reimer, 1914.</ref>\n\n=== Islamic ===\nMuslim writers have cited this tradition. For example, [[Al-Tha'alibi]] writes that Zoroastrian legalized marriage between brothers and sisters and fathers and daughters because Adam had married his sons to his daughters. [[Al-Masudi]] cites Zoroastrian incest and reports that [[Ardashir I]] told his people to marry close relatives to strengthen family ties.\n\n=== Jewish ===\nJewish philosopher [[Philo]] has mentioned the marriage of high-ranking Iranians to their mothers and the high status of the children of these links.\n\n=== Christian ===\nThe most comprehensive reports come from Eastern Christians who lived under Persian rule, they wrote down that these were not just fictitious stories of far away people, but were indeed very real and widely practiced. Iso'bokht, the Nestorian patriarch of the Persis writes many books on this topic urging Christians and other peoples to not practice this custom.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== European ===\nMost of Pahlavi's texts are self-contained by [[Edward William West]]'s comments. Brief evaluations and references include Friedrich Spiegel and standard books on Zoroastrianism (such as Boyce).\n\n===Middle Persian===\nThe earliest use of the word Xwedodah in Middle Persian in the inscription Kordir on the [[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]] is in the role of [[Naqsh-e Rostam]].\n\nPerhaps a much more recent reference can be found in the Pahlavi-Chinese bilingual tomb inscriptions in Xi'an, in which the deceased woman, from the Surin family princes, is read in Chinese as \"wife\" but in Pahlavi's \"daughter\" but The interpretation of the inscription is unclear. [[Ferdowsi]] mentions incest only between Bahman and his sister Homa.<ref name=\"iranicaonline.org\">http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/marriage-next-of-kin</ref>\n\n===Classical sources===\nThe common feature of non-Iranian sources is that they rarely mention the Iranians themselves, even if they do occasionally mention the clerics.\n\nNumerous classical sources and later authors point to the incarnation of incest in the Achaemenid monarchies of the Parthian and Sassanian dynasties.\n\nSome of the earliest Greek references to non-royal incest are those by [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus]] in his book Magica, which [[Clement of Alexandria]] quoted as saying that [[Magi]] had sex with their mothers, daughters and sisters, and that [[Ctesias]] had mentioned a brother-sister marriage.

Unlike incest in Egypt, or Rome, or Medieval European royalty, this form of nuclear family incest was not relegated to just royalty but was widely popular among all facets of society from slaves, to free men, to the middle class, aristocrats and royalty. Nuclear family incest resulting in progeny was a far cry from an exclusively or even predominantly royal custom.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Non-Zoroastrian Sources==\nPersians who immigrate from their homeland in Persia and live across various nations practiced brother-sister incest marriages, and in historical sources are refereed to as Magians, or Majoosi as called by the Arab dialects.<ref name=\":0\" /> There are 60 outside sources referencing Zoroastrian Persian brother-sister incest marriages come from the Greeks, Romans, Armenians, Arabians, Indians, Tibetans, and Chinese, ranging from the 5th century B.C. into the 15th century A.D, roughly 2000 years.<ref name=\":0\" /> The most comprehensive reports come from Eastern Christians who lived under Persian rule, they wrote down that these were not just fictitious stories of far away people, but were indeed very real and widely practiced. Iso'bokht, the Nestorian patriarch of the Persis writes many books on this topic urging Christians and other peoples to not practice this custom. Due to the method of Islamic conquests, where newly conquered territory would be allowed to keep their customs and practices as long as they submitted and paid their taxes<ref>Choksy, J.K. ''Zoroastrians in Muslim lran: selected problems of coexistence and interaction during the early medieval period.'' Iranian Studies 20:17-30, 1987.</ref> This was to maintain stability over a multicultural empire, and thus Zoroastrian brother-sister incest continued to persist and exist well into the Middle Ages.<ref>Sachau, E. ''Syrische Rechtsbiicher'', 3, Berlin: Georg Reimer, 1914.</ref>\n\n=== Jewish ===\nJewish philosopher [[Philo]] has mentioned the marriage of high-ranking Iranians to their mothers and the high status of the children of these links.\n\n===Arabic===\nMuslim writers have cited this tradition. For example, [[Al-Tha'alibi]] writes that Zoroastrian legalized marriage between brothers and sisters and fathers and daughters because Adam had married his sons to his daughters. [[Al-Masudi]] cites Zoroastrian incest and reports that [[Ardashir I]] told his people to marry close relatives to strengthen family ties.\n\n=== European ===\nMost of Pahlavi's texts are self-contained by [[Edward William West]]'s comments. Brief evaluations and references include Friedrich Spiegel and standard books on Zoroastrianism (such as Boyce).\n\n===Middle Persian===\nThe earliest use of the word Xwedodah in Middle Persian in the inscription Kordir on the [[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]] is in the role of [[Naqsh-e Rostam]].\n\nPerhaps a much more recent reference can be found in the Pahlavi-Chinese bilingual tomb inscriptions in Xi'an, in which the deceased woman, from the Surin family princes, is read in Chinese as \"wife\" but in Pahlavi's \"daughter\" but The interpretation of the inscription is unclear. [[Ferdowsi]] mentions incest only between Bahman and his sister Homa.<ref name=\"iranicaonline.org\">http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/marriage-next-of-kin</ref>\n\n===Classical sources===\nThe common feature of non-Iranian sources is that they rarely mention the Iranians themselves, even if they do occasionally mention the clerics.\n\nNumerous classical sources and later authors point to the incarnation of incest in the Achaemenid monarchies of the Parthian and Sassanian dynasties.\n\nSome of the earliest Greek references to non-royal incest are those by [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus]] in his book Magica, which [[Clement of Alexandria]] quoted as saying that [[Magi]] had sex with their mothers, daughters and sisters, and that [[Ctesias]] had mentioned a brother-sister marriage. Herodotus mentions that Cambyses lived with his sister, though the Persians had never been with their sisters before.<ref name=\"iranicaonline.org\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Persian wedding]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Marriage, unions and partnerships in Iran]]\n[[Category:Incest]]\n[[Category:Zoroastrian behaviour and experience]]\n", "name_user": "Qayrawan", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xwedodah"}

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330. The crew asked to remain at FL 330 and the air traffic controller approved this request, moving the other flight to FL 350.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond. When MH17 did not respond to several calls, ''Dnipro Control'' contacted ''RND Control'' again to check if they could see the aircraft on their radar.

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330. The crew asked to remain at FL 330 and the air traffic controller approved this request, moving the other flight to FL 350.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond. When MH17 did not respond to several calls, ''Dnipro Control'' contacted ''RND Control'' again to check if they could see the aircraft on their radar.

If an engine describes a position as +2.50, the plus sign (+) indicates the position is favorable to White; a minus sign (\u2212) indicates the position is favorable to Black. The number can correspond to the approximate value of pieces, although engines use other factors besides material. The notation +2.50 indicates that White is ahead by two and one-half pawns. The notation +M4 indicates that White can force checkmate in four moves.<ref>David 2016, pp. 88\u201396</ref><ref>ChessMN16. \"How to Read Engine Evaluations\". Chess.com.

It is the second installment in the [[Krrish (franchise)|''Krrish'' franchise]], being the continuation to ''[[Koi... Mil Gaya]]'', and relates the story of Krishna, the son of the previous film's protagonists, who inherits his father's superhuman abilities. After falling in love with Priya, he follows her to Singapore, where he takes on the persona of \"Krrish\" to keep his identity secret while saving children from a burning circus. From that moment on he is regarded as a superhero, and must later thwart the plans of the evil Dr. Arya, who has a connection to Krishna's father, Rohit, the protagonist of the previous film.\n\n''Krrish '' was conceived to be a film of global significance and a trendsetter in Indian cinema, with visual effects on par with those from Hollywood. To that end, the effects team was aided by Hollywood's Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma, and the stunts were choreographed by Chinese martial arts film expert [[Ching Siu-Tung|Tony Ching]]. The music was composed by [[Rajesh Roshan]], with the background score by [[Salim-Sulaiman]]. Filming was done to a large extent in Singapore as well as India.\n\nThe film was released worldwide on 23 June 2006 at a budget of {{INR}}400 million<ref name=\"Budget\"/> and on 1000 prints, both near-record amounts for an Indian film at the time. ''Krrish'' received mixed reviews from critics in India, but got a record opening week at the box office. A [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], ''Krrish'' grossed a worldwide total of {{INR}}1.26 billion,<ref name=\"Kr\"/> becoming the [[List of Bollywood films of 2006|third highest earning Indian film of 2006]].\n\n''Krrish'' was nominated for eight [[Filmfare Awards]], including [[Filmfare Best Film Award|Best Film]], [[Filmfare Best Director Award|Best Director]], [[Filmfare Best Actor Award|Best Actor]] for Roshan, and [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award|Best Supporting Actress]] for Rekha, winning three, including [[Filmfare Best Special Effects Award|Best Special Effects]]. At the [[8th IIFA Awards|2007 IIFA Awards]], the film received nine nominations and won three, with one being [[IIFA Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Roshan. It also won the [[National Film Award for Best Special Effects]]. The third film in the series, ''[[Krrish 3]]'' was released in 2013.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Hatnote|The plot of the film connects with the predecessor. For more information on the predecessor's plot, see [[Koi... Mil Gaya#Plot|Koi... Mil Gaya]].}}\nFive-year-old Krishna Mehra, son of the late scientist Rohit Mehra, undergoes an [[intelligence quotient]] test by a professor, who suspects that he has superpowers, due to Krishna answering all the questions flawlessly. His grandmother Sonia takes the young Krishna to a remote mountain village to conceal his unique abilities. Years later, Krishna meets vacationing friends Priya and Honey when Krishna's friend Bahadur takes the girls' camping crew near his home to camp. Krishna saves Priya from a [[Hang gliding|hang glider]] accident and falls in love with her when spending time with her.\n\nAfter returning home to [[Singapore]], Priya and Honey are fired by their boss for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. To keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Sonia objects to this, saying that people will want to exploit his abilities. She then explains the events of [[Koi... Mil Gaya|the previous film]], and that Rohit was hired by scientist Siddhant Arya to design a computer that could see the future to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. Rohit later discovered that the purpose of the computer was not for good, so he destroyed it. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of trauma shortly thereafter. Krishna promises Sonia that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself; Honey and Priya are fired again.\n\nKrishna meets circus performer Kristian Li, who attempts to raise funds to pay for his young sister's leg surgery. He invites Krishna and Priya to his circus, where a fire breaks out during the performance. Several children remain trapped in the blaze. To save the children without revealing his abilities, Krishna dons a broken black mask and puts his jacket on inside-out, creating the persona of \"Krrish\". Later, when Kristian sees Krrish fighting some goons and removing his mask, he discovers his friend Krishna is Krrish. As Krrish is being offered a reward for his deeds, Krishna asks Kristian to assume the identity, so that he can pay for his sister's surgery.\n\nMeanwhile, Priya discovers that Krishna is Krrish upon seeing the footage from her video camera. She and Honey decide to release the footage on TV to make Krishna a star. Krishna arrives and overhears them talking about how Priya had lied to him, and how they will reveal his identity. Just before Priya confesses to Honey that she has genuinely fallen in love with Krishna, he leaves, dejected.\n\nAfter being confronted by Krishna at his apartment they talked what she said, Priya realises her mistake and stops her boss from revealing Krrish's identity. She then meets Vikram Sinha, who has been searching for Krishna for years. He tells them that Rohit is still alive; after completing the computer, he and Rohit tested it and saw Siddhant holding Rohit at gunpoint. Rohit understood that Siddhant was going to kill him and then use the computer for his own selfish needs. He was able to destroy it, before being taken prisoner by Siddhant.\n\nIn the present, Siddhant has rebuilt the computer after many years. He uses it to reveal his future and sees Krrish killing him. Siddhant then kills Kristian, thinking that he is Krrish. Krishna later follows Siddhant to his island lair. When Siddhant looks into the future again, he sees the same thing and is shocked to see Krrish still alive and on his island.\n\nWhen Krrish enters the compound, there is a vicious fight with Siddhant's thugs. Krrish eventually defeats them and saves Priya and Rohit. However, Vikram is shot dead by Siddhant. Krrish eventually wounds Siddhant fatally. Before Siddhant dies, Krrish reveals himself as Krishna. After revealing to Rohit that he is his son, Krishna takes Priya and his father back to India, reuniting him with Sonia. Rohit then uses his father's special computer to contact his alien friend Jadoo, whose spaceship is later seen from a distance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hrithik Roshan]] as Rohit Mehra and Krishna \"Krrish\" Mehra\n* [[Naseeruddin Shah]] as Dr. Siddhant Arya\n* [[Priyanka Chopra]] as Priya Mehra / Priya Kalyanan, Krishna's love interest\n* [[Rekha]] as Sonia Mehra, Rohit's mother and Krishna's grandmother\n* [[Manini Mishra (actress)|Manini Mishra]] as Honey Arora, Priya's best friend\n* [[Sharat Saxena]] as Vikram Sinha\n* [[Archana Puran Singh]] as Nayantara, Priya and Honey's boss\n* Bin Xia as Kristian Li\n* [[Hemant Pandey]] as Bahadur\n* [[Puneet Issar]] as Komal Singh\n\n===Cameo=== \n*[[Akash Khurana]] as Catholic school principal\n*[[Kiran Juneja]] as Amisha Kalyanan, Priya's mother\n*Yu Xuan as Kristian Li's little sister\n*[[Preity Zinta]] as Nisha Mehra ; Krishna's mother\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nIn November 2004, the Roshans confirmed he would produce a sequel to ''[[Koi...

It is the second installment in the [[Krrish (franchise)|''Krrish'' franchise]], being the continuation to ''[[Koi... Mil Gaya]]'', and relates the story of Krishna, the son of the previous film's protagonists, who inherits his father's superhuman abilities. After falling in love with Priya, he follows her to Singapore, where he takes on the persona of \"Krrish\" to keep his identity secret while saving children from a burning circus. From that moment on he is regarded as a superhero, and must later thwart the plans of the evil Dr. Arya, who has a connection to Krishna's father, Rohit, the protagonist of the previous film.\n\n''Krrish '' was conceived to be a film of global significance and a trendsetter in Indian cinema, with visual effects on par with those from Hollywood. To that end, the effects team was aided by Hollywood's Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma, and the stunts were choreographed by Chinese martial arts film expert [[Ching Siu-Tung|Tony Ching]]. The music was composed by [[Rajesh Roshan]], with the background score by [[Salim-Sulaiman]]. Filming was done to a large extent in Singapore as well as India.\n\nThe film was released worldwide on 23 June 2006 at a budget of {{INR}}400 million<ref name=\"Budget\"/> and on 1000 prints, both near-record amounts for an Indian film at the time. ''Krrish'' received mixed reviews from critics in India, but got a record opening week at the box office. A [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], ''Krrish'' grossed a worldwide total of {{INR}}1.26 billion,<ref name=\"Kr\"/> becoming the [[List of Bollywood films of 2006|third highest earning Indian film of 2006]].\n\n''Krrish'' was nominated for eight [[Filmfare Awards]], including [[Filmfare Best Film Award|Best Film]], [[Filmfare Best Director Award|Best Director]], [[Filmfare Best Actor Award|Best Actor]] for Roshan, and [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award|Best Supporting Actress]] for Rekha, winning three, including [[Filmfare Best Special Effects Award|Best Special Effects]]. At the [[8th IIFA Awards|2007 IIFA Awards]], the film received nine nominations and won three, with one being [[IIFA Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Roshan. It also won the [[National Film Award for Best Special Effects]]. The third film in the series, ''[[Krrish 3]]'' was released in 2013.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Hatnote|The plot of the film connects with the predecessor. For more information on the predecessor's plot, see [[Koi... Mil Gaya#Plot|Koi... Mil Gaya]].}}\nFive-year-old Krishna Mehra, son of the late scientist Rohit Mehra, undergoes an [[intelligence quotient]] test by a professor, who suspects that he has superpowers, due to Krishna answering all the questions flawlessly. His grandmother Sonia takes the young Krishna to a remote mountain village to conceal his unique abilities. Years later, Krishna meets vacationing friends Priya and Honey when Krishna's friend Bahadur takes the girls' camping crew near his home to camp. Krishna saves Priya from a [[Hang gliding|hang glider]] accident and falls in love with her when spending time with her.\n\nAfter returning home to [[Singapore]], Priya and Honey are fired by their boss for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. To keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Sonia objects to this, saying that people will want to exploit his abilities. She then explains the events of [[Koi... Mil Gaya|the previous film]], and that Rohit was hired by scientist Siddhant Arya to design a computer that could see the future to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. Rohit later discovered that the purpose of the computer was not for good, so he destroyed it. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of trauma shortly thereafter. Krishna promises Sonia that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself; Honey and Priya are fired again.\n\nKrishna meets circus performer Kristian Li, who attempts to raise funds to pay for his young sister's leg surgery. He invites Krishna and Priya to his circus, where a fire breaks out during the performance. Several children remain trapped in the blaze. To save the children without revealing his abilities, Krishna dons a broken black mask and puts his jacket on inside-out, creating the persona of \"Krrish\". Later, when Kristian sees Krrish fighting some goons and removing his mask, he discovers his friend Krishna is Krrish. As Krrish is being offered a reward for his deeds, Krishna asks Kristian to assume the identity, so that he can pay for his sister's surgery.\n\nMeanwhile, Priya discovers that Krishna is Krrish upon seeing the footage from her video camera. She and Honey decide to release the footage on TV to make Krishna a star. Krishna arrives and overhears them talking about how Priya had lied to him, and how they will reveal his identity. Just before Priya confesses to Honey that she has genuinely fallen in love with Krishna, he leaves, dejected.\n\nAfter being confronted by Krishna at his apartment they talked what she said, Priya realises her mistake and stops her boss from revealing Krrish's identity. She then meets Vikram Sinha, who has been searching for Krishna for years. He tells them that Rohit is still alive; after completing the computer, he and Rohit tested it and saw Siddhant holding Rohit at gunpoint. Rohit understood that Siddhant was going to kill him and then use the computer for his own selfish needs. He was able to destroy it, before being taken prisoner by Siddhant.\n\nIn the present, Siddhant has rebuilt the computer after many years. He uses it to reveal his future and sees Krrish killing him. Siddhant then kills Kristian, thinking that he is Krrish. Krishna later follows Siddhant to his island lair. When Siddhant looks into the future again, he sees the same thing and is shocked to see Krrish still alive and on his island.\n\nWhen Krrish enters the compound, there is a vicious fight with Siddhant's thugs. Krrish eventually defeats them and saves Priya and Rohit. However, Vikram is shot dead by Siddhant. Krrish eventually wounds Siddhant fatally. Before Siddhant dies, Krrish reveals himself as Krishna.

{"title_page": "Gaslighting", "text_new": "{{short description|Psychological manipulation via being made to question one's own judgment}}\n{{Other uses|Gaslight (disambiguation)}}\n'''Gaslighting''' is a form of [[psychological manipulation]] in which a person or a group covertly sows seeds of doubt in a targeted individual, making them question their own memory, perception, or judgment, often evoking in them [[cognitive dissonance]] and other changes such as low [[self-esteem]]. Using [[denial]], misdirection, contradiction, and [[misinformation]], gaslighting involves attempts to [[Destabilisation#Psychology|destabilize]] the victim and delegitimize the victim's beliefs. Instances can range from the denial by an [[abuse]]r that previous abusive incidents occurred to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim.\n\nThe term originated from the play ''[[Gas Light]]'' (1938, but originally performed as ''Angel Street'' in the United States) and its [[Gaslight (1940 film)|1940]] and [[Gaslight (1944 film)|1944]] film adaptations (both titled ''Gaslight'').

The play's title alludes to how the abusive husband slowly dims the [[Gas lighting|gas lights]] in their home, while pretending nothing has changed, in an effort to make his wife doubt her own perceptions. He further uses the lights in the sealed-off attic to secretly search for jewels belonging to a woman whom he has murdered. He makes loud noises as he searches, including talking to himself. The wife repeatedly asks her husband to confirm her perceptions about the dimming lights, noises and voices, but in defiance of reality, he keeps insisting that the lights are the same and instead it is she who is going insane.<ref name=\"Stern\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-khhWM72pC8C|title=The Gaslight Effect: How to Spot and Survive the Hidden Manipulation Others Use to Control Your Life|last=Stern|first=Robin|date=2007-05-01|location=New York|publisher=Morgan Road Books|isbn=9780767924450|oclc=85766223|accessdate=2014-01-06}}</ref>{{rp|8}} He intends on having her assessed and committed to a mental institution, after which he will be able to gain power of attorney over her and search more effectively.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe term \"gaslighting\" has been used colloquially since the 1960s<ref>{{Cite OED|gaslight}} ''1969 S.

After the 1990 census, however, his district was merged with the [[Illinois' 3rd congressional district|3rd district]], represented by a longtime friend, [[Marty Russo]].  Lipinski defeated Russo in the 1992 Democratic primary, mainly by running up his margins in the Chicago portion of the district\u2014which is virtually coextensive with the 23rd Ward. This all but assured him of a sixth term.  He was reelected five more times from this district, facing serious opposition only once, in 1994.\n\nWhile in the House, Lipinski served on the [[United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|Transportation Committee]]; his district included [[Midway Airport]] and also had more [[railroad crossing]]s than any other district.<ref name=Barone2002>{{cite book |last=Barone |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Barone (pundit) |author2=[[Richard E.
