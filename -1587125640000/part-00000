They are commonly served as a [[snack]], [[side dish]], or [[appetizer]]. The basic chips are cooked and [[Edible salt|salted]]; additional varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including [[herbs]], [[spice]]s, [[cheese]]s, other natural flavors, [[artificial flavors]], and [[Food additive|additives]]. \nPotato chips form a large part of the [[snack food]] and convenience food market in Western countries. The global potato chip market generated total revenue of US$16.49 billion in 2005.

In [[Brazil]], \"home-style\" potato chips are known as {{lang|pt|batatas portuguesas}} (\"Portuguese potatoes\") if their sides are relatively smooth and {{lang|pt|batatas prussianas}} (\"Prussian potatoes\") if their sides show a wafer biscuit-like pattern, whilst American-like industrial uniform potato chips made from a fried potato pur\u00e9e-based dough are known as \"batata chips\" (\"potato chips\"), or just {{lang|pt|\"chips\"}}.\n\n== Health concerns ==\nMost potato chips contain high levels of [[Sodium in biology|sodium]], from [[salt]]. This has been linked to health issues such as high [[blood pressure]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rmwp7X2FZ68C&pg=PA275&dq=Most+potato+chips+contain+high+levels+of+sodium,+from+salt.+This+has+been+linked+to+health+issues+such+as+high+blood+pressure#v=onepage&q=Most%20potato%20chips%20contain%20high%20levels%20of%20sodium,%20from%20salt.%20This%20has%20been%20linked%20to%20health%20issues%20such%20as%20high%20blood%20pressure&f=false|title=Public Health and the Risk Factor: A History of an Uneven Medical Revolution|last=Rothstein|first=William G.|date=2003|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|isbn=9781580461276|language=en}}</ref> However, researchers at [[Queen Mary University of London]] in 2004 have noted that a small \"bag of ready-salted crisps\" contains less salt than a serving of many breakfast cereals, including \"every brand of [[cornflakes]] on sale in the UK.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.actiononsalt.org.uk/news/surveys/2004/cereals/index.html |title=Health hazard hidden in breakfast bowls |website=Action on Salt |date=12 November 2004 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |publisher=[[Queen Mary University of London]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107011818/http://www.actiononsalt.org.uk/news/surveys/2004/cereals/index.html |archivedate=7 November 2012  }}</ref>\n\nSome potato chip companies have responded to the long-standing concerns by investing in research and development to modify existing recipes and create health-conscious products. [[PepsiCo]] research shows that about 80% of salt on chips is not sensed by the tongue before being swallowed. [[Frito-Lay]] spent $414 million in 2009 on product development, including development of salt crystals that would reduce the salt content of [[Lay's]] potato chips without adversely affecting flavor.<ref name=\"newsalt\">{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704534904575131602283791566 |title=PepsiCo Develops 'Designer Salt' to Chip Away at Sodium Intake |last=McKay |first=Betsy |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=22 March 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223092112/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704534904575131602283791566 |archivedate=23 December 2014  }}</ref>\n\nUnsalted chips are available, e.g. the longstanding British brand [[Salt 'n' Shake]], whose chips are not seasoned, but instead include a small salt [[sachet]] in the bag for seasoning to taste. Many other popular brands in the United States, such as [[Frito-Lay]], also offer such a product.\n\nAnother possible health concern related to potato chips is [[acrylamide]], which is produced when potatoes are fried or baked at high temperatures. Studies show that laboratory animals exposed to high levels of acrylamide develop cancer;<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/food/chemicals/acrylamide \"Acrylamide\"]</ref> however, it is currently unclear whether a similar risk exists in humans.  In August 2008, [[California Attorney General]] [[Jerry Brown]] announced a settlement with [[Frito-Lay]], [[Kettle Foods]], and [[Lance Inc.]] the makers of [[Cape Cod Potato Chips]] for violating the state's [[California Proposition 65 (1986)|Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act]]. The state had alleged in 2005 that potato chips from these companies failed to document that they contained high levels of acrylamide, which is listed by California since the 1990s as a [[carcinogen]]. These companies paid fines and agreed to SEX reduce acrylamide levels to be under 275 parts per billion.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://oag.ca.gov/news/press_release?id=1595 |title= Atty. Gen.

This makes chips that are uniform in size and shape, which allows them to be stacked and packaged in rigid cardboard or plastic canisters. Pringles are officially branded as \"potato crisps\" in the US. Pringles may be termed \"potato chips\" in Britain, to distinguish them from traditional \"crisps\". [[Munchos]], another brand that uses the term \"potato crisps\", has deep air pockets in its chips that give it a curved shape, though the chips themselves resemble regular bagged chips.\n\nAn additional variant of potato chips exists in the form of \"potato sticks\", also called \"shoestring potatoes\". These are made as extremely thin (2 to 3&nbsp;mm) versions of the popular French fry but are fried in the manner of regular salted potato chips. A [[hickory]]-smoke-flavored version is popular in Canada, going by the [[vending machine]] name \"Hickory Sticks\". Potato sticks are typically packaged in rigid containers, although some manufacturers use flexible pouches, similar to potato chip bags. Potato sticks were originally packed in hermetically sealed steel cans. In the 1960s, manufacturers switched to the less expensive composite canister (similar to the Pringles container). [[Reckitt Benckiser]] was a market leader in this category{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} under the Durkee Potato Stix and [[French's]] Potato Sticks names but exited the business in 2008. In 2014, French's reentered the market.\n\nA larger variant (about 1&nbsp;cm thick) made with dehydrated potatoes is marketed as [[Andy Capp]]'s [[Andy Capp's fries|Pub Fries]], using the theme of a long-running British [[comic strip]], which are baked and sold in a variety of flavors.\nWalkers make a similar product (using the Smiths brand) called \"Chipsticks\" which are sold in ready-salted and salt and vinegar flavors.\n\nSome companies have also marketed [[baking|baked]] potato chips as an alternative with lower fat content. Additionally, some varieties of fat-free chips have been made using artificial, and indigestible, fat substitutes. These became well known in the media when an ingredient many contained, [[Olestra]], was linked in some individuals to abdominal discomfort and loose stools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://win.niddk.nih.gov/notes/summer98/artcl9.html |title=New Fat-free Product on the Market |publisher=[[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]] |date=Summer 1998 |accessdate=26 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210050117/http://win.niddk.nih.gov/notes/summer98/artcl9.html |archivedate=10 February 2009 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->}}</ref>\n\nMany other products might be called \"crisps\" in Britain, but would not be classed as \"potato chips\" because they are not made with potato or are not chipped (for example, [[Wotsits]], [[Quavers]], [[Skips (snack)|Skips]], [[Hula Hoops]], and [[Monster Munch]]).\n\n[[Sweet potato]] chips are eaten in Korea, New Zealand, and Japan; parsnip, [[beetroot]], and carrot crisps are available in the United Kingdom.

They are commonly served as a [[snack]], [[side dish]], or [[appetizer]]. The basic chips are cooked and [[Edible salt|salted]]; additional varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including [[herbs]], [[spice]]s, [[cheese]]s, other natural flavors, [[artificial flavors]], and [[Food additive|additives]]. \nPotato chips form a large part of the [[snack food]] and convenience food market in Western countries. The global potato chip market generated total revenue of US$16.49 billion in 2005. This accounted for 35.5% of the total [[savoriness|savory]] snacks market in that year ($46.1 billion).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.potatopro.com/Pr/E-shot/Savory%20Snacks%20Global%20Industry%20Guide.aspx |title=PotatoPro/Datamonitor |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715110533/http://www.potatopro.com/Pr/E-shot/Savory%20Snacks%20Global%20Industry%20Guide.aspx |archivedate=15 July 2011 |publisher=Potatopro.com |date=<!--undated--> |accessdate=26 May 2009 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Origin ===\nThe earliest known recipe for something similar to today's potato chips is in [[William Kitchiner]]'s book ''[[William Kitchiner#The Cook's Oracle|The Cook's Oracle]]'' published in 1817, which was a bestseller in the United Kingdom and the United States.<ref name=\"Irish News\">{{cite news |title=Did Tayto really invent cheese and onion crisps? |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/food-and-drink/did-tayto-really-invent-cheese-and-onion-crisps-1.3915726 |accessdate=November 16, 2019 |work=The Irish News}}</ref> The 1822 edition's recipe for \"Potatoes fried in Slices or Shavings\" reads \"peel large potatoes\u2026 cut them in shavings round and round, as you would peel a lemon; dry them well in a clean cloth, and fry them in lard or dripping\".<ref>{{cite news |first1=Steve |last1=Berry |first2=Phil |last2=Norman |last-author-amp=yes |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/10965628/Crisps-buoyed-Britain-in-its-darkest-hour.html |title='Crisps buoyed Britain in its darkest hour' |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=14 July 2014 |accessdate=26 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003061408/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/10965628/Crisps-buoyed-Britain-in-its-darkest-hour.html |archivedate=3 October 2014  }}</ref><ref name=\"William Kitchiner\">{{cite book |first=William |last=Kitchiner |title=The Cook's Oracle: Containing Receipts for Plain Cookery on the Most ... |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gvcpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA208 |year=1822 |publisher=A.

In the north of New Zealand, they are known as \"chippies\", but are marketed as \"chips\" throughout the country. In Australia and New Zealand, sometimes the distinction is made between \"hot chips\" (fried potatoes) and \"chips\" or \"potato chips\". In [[Bangladesh]], they are generally known as \"chip\" or \"chips\", and much less frequently as \"crisps\" (pronounced \"kirisp\") and locally, ''alu bhaja'' (for their similarity to the fried potato dish, ''[[bhajji]]'').\n\nIn German-speaking countries (Austria, Germany: \"''Kartoffelchips''\"; Switzerland: \"''Pommes Chips''\") and in countries of the former [[SFR Yugoslavia]], fried thin potato slices are known as \"chips\" (locally pronounced very similar to the actual English pronunciation), with a clear distinction from french fries. In [[Brazil]], \"home-style\" potato chips are known as {{lang|pt|batatas portuguesas}} (\"Portuguese potatoes\") if their sides are relatively smooth and {{lang|pt|batatas prussianas}} (\"Prussian potatoes\") if their sides show a wafer biscuit-like pattern, whilst American-like industrial uniform potato chips made from a fried potato pur\u00e9e-based dough are known as \"batata chips\" (\"potato chips\"), or just {{lang|pt|\"chips\"}}.\n\n== Health concerns ==\nMost potato chips contain high levels of [[Sodium in biology|sodium]], from [[salt]].

[[PepsiCo]] research shows that about 80% of salt on chips is not sensed by the tongue before being swallowed. [[Frito-Lay]] spent $414 million in 2009 on product development, including development of salt crystals that would reduce the salt content of [[Lay's]] potato chips without adversely affecting flavor.<ref name=\"newsalt\">{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704534904575131602283791566 |title=PepsiCo Develops 'Designer Salt' to Chip Away at Sodium Intake |last=McKay |first=Betsy |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=22 March 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223092112/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704534904575131602283791566 |archivedate=23 December 2014  }}</ref>\n\nUnsalted chips are available, e.g. the longstanding British brand [[Salt 'n' Shake]], whose chips are not seasoned, but instead include a small salt [[sachet]] in the bag for seasoning to taste. Many other popular brands in the United States, such as [[Frito-Lay]], also offer such a product.\n\nAnother possible health concern related to potato chips is [[acrylamide]], which is produced when potatoes are fried or baked at high temperatures. Studies show that laboratory animals exposed to high levels of acrylamide develop cancer;<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/food/chemicals/acrylamide \"Acrylamide\"]</ref> however, it is currently unclear whether a similar risk exists in humans.  In August 2008, [[California Attorney General]] [[Jerry Brown]] announced a settlement with [[Frito-Lay]], [[Kettle Foods]], and [[Lance Inc.]] the makers of [[Cape Cod Potato Chips]] for violating the state's [[California Proposition 65 (1986)|Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act]]. The state had alleged in 2005 that potato chips from these companies failed to document that they contained high levels of acrylamide, which is listed by California since the 1990s as a [[carcinogen]]. These companies paid fines and agreed to reduce acrylamide levels to be under 275 parts per billion.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://oag.ca.gov/news/press_release?id=1595 |title= Atty. Gen.

Many of these companies are members of '''SNAC International''', the global snack industry association.\n\n== Similar foods ==\n[[File:Pringles chips.JPG|thumb|[[Pringles]] potato chips are uniform in size and shape, which allows them to be stacked.]]\n\nAnother type of potato chip, notably the [[Pringles]] and [[Lay's Stax]] brands, is made by [[Food extrusion|extruding]] or pressing a dough made from dehydrated potatoes into the desired shape before frying. This makes chips that are uniform in size and shape, which allows them to be stacked and packaged in rigid cardboard or plastic canisters. Pringles are officially branded as \"potato crisps\" in the US. Pringles may be termed \"potato chips\" in Britain, to distinguish them from traditional \"crisps\". [[Munchos]], another brand that uses the term \"potato crisps\", has deep air pockets in its chips that give it a curved shape, though the chips themselves resemble regular bagged chips.\n\nAn additional variant of potato chips exists in the form of \"potato sticks\", also called \"shoestring potatoes\". These are made as extremely thin (2 to 3&nbsp;mm) versions of the popular French fry but are fried in the manner of regular salted potato chips. A [[hickory]]-smoke-flavored version is popular in Canada, going by the [[vending machine]] name \"Hickory Sticks\". Potato sticks are typically packaged in rigid containers, although some manufacturers use flexible pouches, similar to potato chip bags. Potato sticks were originally packed in hermetically sealed steel cans. In the 1960s, manufacturers switched to the less expensive composite canister (similar to the Pringles container). [[Reckitt Benckiser]] was a market leader in this category{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} under the Durkee Potato Stix and [[French's]] Potato Sticks names but exited the business in 2008. In 2014, French's reentered the market.\n\nA larger variant (about 1&nbsp;cm thick) made with dehydrated potatoes is marketed as [[Andy Capp]]'s [[Andy Capp's fries|Pub Fries]], using the theme of a long-running British [[comic strip]], which are baked and sold in a variety of flavors.\nWalkers make a similar product (using the Smiths brand) called \"Chipsticks\" which are sold in ready-salted and salt and vinegar flavors.\n\nSome companies have also marketed [[baking|baked]] potato chips as an alternative with lower fat content. Additionally, some varieties of fat-free chips have been made using artificial, and indigestible, fat substitutes. These became well known in the media when an ingredient many contained, [[Olestra]], was linked in some individuals to abdominal discomfort and loose stools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://win.niddk.nih.gov/notes/summer98/artcl9.html |title=New Fat-free Product on the Market |publisher=[[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]] |date=Summer 1998 |accessdate=26 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210050117/http://win.niddk.nih.gov/notes/summer98/artcl9.html |archivedate=10 February 2009 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->}}</ref>\n\nMany other products might be called \"crisps\" in Britain, but would not be classed as \"potato chips\" because they are not made with potato or are not chipped (for example, [[Wotsits]], [[Quavers]], [[Skips (snack)|Skips]], [[Hula Hoops]], and [[Monster Munch]]).\n\n[[Sweet potato]] chips are eaten in Korea, New Zealand, and Japan; parsnip, [[beetroot]], and carrot crisps are available in the United Kingdom. India is famous{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} for a large number of localized 'chips shops', selling not only potato chips, but also other varieties such as plantain chips, tapioca chips, [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]] chips, and even carrot chips. Plantain chips, also known as [[Plantain (cooking)#Chifles|chifles]] or [[tostones]], are also sold in the Western Hemisphere from Canada to Chile. In the Philippines, banana chips can be found sold at local stores. In Kenya, chips are made from [[arrowroot]] and [[casava]]. In the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland, and Australia, a new variety of Pringles made from rice has been released and marketed as lower in fat than its potato counterparts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/business/media/02adco.html|title=Pringles Introduces a Multigrain Variety|last=Olson|first=Elizabeth|date=1 July 2010|work=The New York Times|access-date=24 January 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Production ==\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Process of making chips\" widths=\"200px\">\t\nFile:Production of homemade chips (1).JPG|Potato is sliced by rotating the blade\t\nFile:Production of homemade chips (2).JPG|Long and narrow slices are produced\t\nFile:Production of homemade chips (4).JPG|The potato slices are fried in hot oil\t\nFile:Production of homemade chips (7).JPG|Frying takes several minutes\t\nFile:Production of homemade chips (8).JPG|Finished product\t\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Food}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[George Crum]]\n* [[Chips and dip]]\n* [[List of deep fried foods]]\n* [[List of potato dishes]]\n* [[Papadum]]\n* [[Vegetable chips]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Banham, Rayner (1977) \"The Crisp at the Crossroads\", in P.

In response to pathogenic tissue damage, ILCs contribute to immunity via the secretion of [[Cytokine|signalling molecules]], and the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune cells.

our immune response to pathogens in all organs, in particular at mucosal surfaces. <ref name=\"Colonna2018\"/> They are key in the innate immune response due to their ability to rapidly secrete immunoregulatory cytokines, however, they also play a role in the shaping of the adaptive response by interacting with other immune cells. The microenvironment of the tissue they reside in determines and fine- tunes the expression of the diverse ILC profiles, facilitating their interaction in multiple effector functions. \n\nThe strategic positioning and deep rooting of ILCs within tissues allow them to maintain homeostasis, and therefore healthy tissue functioning. However, the ILCs also have detrimental roles in different mucosal sites.<ref name=\"KotasLocksley2018\">{{cite journal|last1=Kotas|first1=Maya E.|last2=Locksley|first2=Richard M.|title=Why Innate Lymphoid Cells?|journal=Immunity|volume=48|issue=6|year=2018|pages=1081\u20131090|issn=10747613|doi=10.1016/j.immuni.2018.06.002}}</ref>\n\nSince the function of ILCs is linked to their specific tissue localization, determination of the signals involved in their localization and migration patterns will be important in the identification of new avenues for treatment of diseases. <ref name=\"PantaziPowell2019\"/> \n\n=== Helminth infection and tissue repair ===\n\nA fundamental property of type 2 immunity, and therefore ILC2 cells, is to deal with oversized organisms, that cannot be digested, such as the [[Parasitic worm|helminths]].<ref name=\"L\u00f6serSmith2019\">{{cite journal|last1=L\u00f6ser|first1=Stephan|last2=Smith|first2=Katherine A.|last3=Maizels|first3=Rick M.|title=Innate Lymphoid Cells in Helminth Infections\u2014Obligatory or Accessory?|journal=Frontiers in Immunology|volume=10|year=2019|issn=1664-3224|doi=10.3389/fimmu.2019.00620}}</ref> In the intestine, in response to a helminth infection, epithelial cells secrete high levels of IL-25, activating ILC2 cells.

Disturbance of the epithelium lining the hepatic [[bile duct]]s is frequently observed in response to chronic liver inflammation, and increased proliferation of these ducts is associated with liver cancer.<ref name=\"OchelTiegs2019\"/> Evidence suggests that the enhanced proliferation is triggered by IL-13, which is produced by IL-33 induced production of ILC2 cells. ILC2s have also been shown to enhance the progression of liver fibrosis, in turn promoting the development of liver cancer.<ref name=\"OchelTiegs2019\"/> \n\nThe availability of specific dietary nutrients can affect ILC immune homeostasis by altering the energy stored in the adipose tissue. Adipose tissue maintains metabolism homeostasis and is now considered a fully immunocompetent organ. [[Malnutrition]] and [[gluttony]] can dysregulate ILC responses via changes in dietary nutrients, having direct effects on the energy stored in the adipose tissue.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> Obesity is associated with changes of gastrointestinal flora, increased afflux of free [[fatty acid metabolism|fatty acids]] from adipose tissue into the liver and increased gut permeability.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> The close anatomical proximity of the gastrointestinal tract and the liver means [[transportation]] of bacterial metabolites through the [[portal vein]] triggers inflammation, acting on innate immune cells, including ILC1s, therefore playing an important role in the activation of an inflammatory state in the liver. Therefore, inflammation associated with obesity can influence the progression of liver disease, due to the development of insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> ILC1s as a key regulatory of adipose tissue inflammation, is therefore a potential therapeutic target for treating people with liver disease or [[metabolic syndrome]]. \n\nILC2s have also been identified in human and mouse [[white adipose tissue]], contributing to the development of obesity. Decreased responses of ILC2s in the tissue are a characteristic of obesity, as this interrupts their crucial role in energy homeostasis, resulting in reduced energy expenditure and increased adiposity.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n=== Skin inflammation ===\n\nThe frequency of ILC2s is higher in the inflamed skin of patients with [[atopic dermatitis]] than in healthy patients.<ref name=\"EbboCrinier2017\"/> The ILC2s from the skin of the patients had upregulation of the IL-25, IL-33, TSLP and PGD2 receptors, suggesting their role in the activation of ILC2s.

He was seconded to [[British Java|Java]] in 1814, where Lieutenant-Governor [[Stamford Raffles]] appointed him to survey the island. He returned to Bengal in 1816, where he improved British knowledge of the [[Ganges]] and the [[Hooghly River|Hooghly]]. He later surveyed a [[semaphore]] line from [[Calcutta]] to [[Benares]], covering approximately {{convert|400|mi|km}}. Everest's work came to the attention of Colonel [[William Lambton]], the leader of the [[Great Trigonometrical Survey]] (GTS), who appoint him as his chief assistant. He joined Lambton at [[Hyderabad]] in 1818, where he was in the process of surveying a [[meridian arc]] northward from [[Cape Commorin]]. He was responsible for much of the fieldwork, and in 1820 contracted [[malaria]], necessitating a period of recovery spent at the [[Cape of Good Hope]].<ref name=odnb/>\n\nEverest returned to India in 1821. He succeeded as superintendent of the GTS upon Lambton's death in 1823, and over the following years extended his predecessor's efforts on the arc up to [[Sironj]], in present-day [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Everest suffered from poor health, however, and the effects of fever and rheumatism left him half paralysed. He left for England in 1825, where he spent the following five years recuperating. Everest was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in March 1827. Most of his free time was spent lobbying the East India Company for better equipment and studying the methods used by the [[Ordnance Survey]]; he frequently corresponded with [[Thomas Frederick Colby]].<ref name=odnb/>\n\n===Surveyor General of India=== \nIn June 1830, Everest returned to India to continue his work on the GTS, and was simultaneously appointed [[Surveyor General of India]]. The arc from Cape Commorin to the northern border of British India was finally completed in 1841, under the supervision of [[Andrew Scott Waugh]]. To his dismay, much of his time was spent on administrative concerns, as well as combating criticism from home. The East India Company had provisionally Thomas Jervis as Everest's successor, and Jervis subsequently delivered a series of lectures to the Royal Society on the perceived deficiencies of Everest's methods. In response, Everest penned a series of open letters to [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex]], the society's president, in which he lambasted the society \"for meddling in matters of which they know little\". Jervis withdrew from consideration, and Everest successfully secured the appointment of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Waugh as his successor. He resigned in November 1842 and his commission was formally revoked in December 1843, at which point he returned to England.<ref name=odnb/>\n\n===Later life===\nIn 1845 Everest was a passenger on the first voyage of the [[SS Great Britain]], <ref>https://globalstories.ssgreatbritain.org/_/traveller/9/</ref>, which was the first crossing of any ocean on the world by a screw propelled steamship. In 1847, Everest published ''An Account of the Measurement of Two Sections of the Meridional Arc of India'', for which he was awarded a medal by the [[Royal Astronomical Society]]. He was later elected to fellowship of the [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Asiatic Society]] and the [[Royal Geographical Society]]. Everest was promoted to [[colonel]] in 1854, made a [[Commander of the Order of the Bath]] in February 1861, and created a [[Knight Bachelor]] in March 1861. He died at his home in [[Hyde Park Gardens]] on 1 December 1866, and was buried in [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church, Hove]], near [[Brighton]].<ref name=odnb/>\n\n==Naming of Mount Everest==\nGeorge Everest had no direct connection with the mountain that bears his name, which he never saw. He was, however, responsible for hiring [[Andrew Scott Waugh]], who made the first formal observations of the mountain, and [[Radhanath Sikdar]], who calculated its height. Before its significance was realised, Mount Everest was originally known as Peak \"B\" and later as Peak XV. In March 1856, Waugh wrote to the [[Royal Geographical Society]] to announce that the mountain was believed to be the highest in the world, and proposed that it be named \"after my illustrious predecessor\", as it was \"without any local name that we can discover\" \u2013 the \"native appellation, if it has any, will not very likely be ascertained before we are allowed to penetrate into Nepal\". There were in fact several native names among the [[Nepal]]ese and [[Tibet]]ans, but those areas were closed off to the British at the time and people living further to the south of the Himalayas did not have a specific name for the peak. In the decade after 1856, Waugh's proposal was widely debated by the Royal Geographical Society and similar bodies. Other scholars of India put forward native names that they believed to be correct, such as [[Brian Houghton Hodgson]]'s \"Deva-dhunga\" and [[Hermann Schlagintweit]]'s \"Gaurisankar\". Everest himself objected to his name being used, as \"the native of India\" could not pronounce it and it could not be written in [[Hindi]]. Nonetheless, in 1865 the society officially settled on \"Mount Everest\" as the name.<ref>[http://www.everest1953.co.uk/naming-mount-everest Naming Mount Everest]</ref>\n\n==Family==\nSir George had several siblings, including two younger brothers.

He purchased it, sight unseen, from General Whish. Although now virtually derelict, it still has its roof, and there have been various plans to make it into a museum.\n\nBuilt in 1832, the house is known today as Sir George Everest's House and Laboratory, or Park House. The house is situated in Park Estate about {{convert|6|km|mi|0}} west of Gandhi Chowk / Library Bazaar, (the west end of Mall Road in Mussoorie). Its location has panoramic views of the [[Doon Valley]] on one side and the [[Aglar River]] valley and the [[Himalayan Range]] to the north.\n\n[[File:George everest house.jpg|left|thumb|Park House as seen through  weathered [[Tibetan Buddhist]] prayer flags, placed by Mussoorie's longtime Tibetan community, from a vantage point at an angle above.]]\nThe house is under the jurisdiction of the Tourism Department. These underground water cisterns (or perhaps pits for storing ice, although water is scarce in the area) are quite deep and lie uncovered in the front yard outside the house, filled with litter and posing danger of slipping.\n\nThe interior has been stripped but the fireplaces, roof, and the door and window frames still remain. The house is secured by steel grills and cannot be entered. Now that this property is better known and the access road has been improved, the walls are covered with graffiti and then periodically whitewashed clean.\n\nRecent new fencing, tree planting and the construction of a ticket booth (as of late 2015) indicate that at some point it will cost to enter the property. The inside has signs of renovation several years ago, such as ceramic floor tiles in the kitchen and electrical switch boxes. Conservation architects at [[INTACH|the Indian National Trust]] are vying for this project.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* John Keay. 2000.

He was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Bengal Artillery]], and sailed for India the same year.<ref name=odnb>\n{{cite ODNB|id=9003|title=Everest, Sir George|last=Baigent|first=Elizabeth}}</ref>\n\nEverest was a [[Freemason]], initiated (date unknown) in Neptune Lodge, Penang, under the authority of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]].

He was seconded to [[British Java|Java]] in 1814, where Lieutenant-Governor [[Stamford Raffles]] appointed him to survey the island. He returned to Bengal in 1816, where he improved British knowledge of the [[Ganges]] and the [[Hooghly River|Hooghly]]. He later surveyed a [[semaphore]] line from [[Calcutta]] to [[Benares]], covering approximately {{convert|400|mi|km}}. Everest's work came to the attention of Colonel [[William Lambton]], the leader of the [[Great Trigonometrical Survey]] (GTS), who appoint him as his chief assistant. He joined Lambton at [[Hyderabad]] in 1818, where he was in the process of surveying a [[meridian arc]] northward from [[Cape Commorin]]. He was responsible for much of the fieldwork, and in 1820 contracted [[malaria]], necessitating a period of recovery spent at the [[Cape of Good Hope]].<ref name=odnb/>\n\nEverest returned to India in 1821. He succeeded as superintendent of the GTS upon Lambton's death in 1823, and over the following years extended his predecessor's efforts on the arc up to [[Sironj]], in present-day [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Everest suffered from poor health, however, and the effects of fever and rheumatism left him half paralysed. He left for England in 1825, where he spent the following five years recuperating. Everest was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in March 1827. Most of his free time was spent lobbying the East India Company for better equipment and studying the methods used by the [[Ordnance Survey]]; he frequently corresponded with [[Thomas Frederick Colby]].<ref name=odnb/>\n\n===Surveyor General of India=== \nIn June 1830, Everest returned to India to continue his work on the GTS, and was simultaneously appointed [[Surveyor General of India]]. The arc from Cape Commorin to the northern border of British India was finally completed in 1841, under the supervision of [[Andrew Scott Waugh]]. To his dismay, much of his time was spent on administrative concerns, as well as combating criticism from home. The East India Company had provisionally Thomas Jervis as Everest's successor, and Jervis subsequently delivered a series of lectures to the Royal Society on the perceived deficiencies of Everest's methods. In response, Everest penned a series of open letters to [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex]], the society's president, in which he lambasted the society \"for meddling in matters of which they know little\". Jervis withdrew from consideration, and Everest successfully secured the appointment of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Waugh as his successor. He resigned in November 1842 and his commission was formally revoked in December 1843, at which point he returned to England.<ref name=odnb/>\n\n===Later life===\nIn 1845 Everest was a passenger on the first voyage of the [[SS Great Britain]], <ref>https://globalstories.ssgreatbritain.org/_/traveller/9/</ref>, which was the first crossing of any ocean on the world by a screw propelled steamship. In 1847, Everest published ''An Account of the Measurement of Two Sections of the Meridional Arc of India'', for which he was awarded a medal by the [[Royal Astronomical Society]]. He was later elected to fellowship of the [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Asiatic Society]] and the [[Royal Geographical Society]]. Everest was promoted to [[colonel]] in 1854, made a [[Commander of the Order of the Bath]] in February 1861, and created a [[Knight Bachelor]] in March 1861. He died at his home in [[Hyde Park Gardens]] on 1 December 1866, and was buried in [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church, Hove]], near [[Brighton]].<ref name=odnb/>\n\n==Naming of Mount Everest==\nGeorge Everest had no direct connection with the mountain that bears his name, which he never saw. He was, however, responsible for hiring [[Andrew Scott Waugh]], who made the first formal observations of the mountain, and [[Radhanath Sikdar]], who calculated its height. Before its significance was realised, Mount Everest was originally known as Peak \"B\" and later as Peak XV. In March 1856, Waugh wrote to the [[Royal Geographical Society]] to announce that the mountain was believed to be the highest in the world, and proposed that it be named \"after my illustrious predecessor\", as it was \"without any local name that we can discover\" \u2013 the \"native appellation, if it has any, will not very likely be ascertained before we are allowed to penetrate into Nepal\". There were in fact several native names among the [[Nepal]]ese and [[Tibet]]ans, but those areas were closed off to the British at the time and people living further to the south of the Himalayas did not have a specific name for the peak. In the decade after 1856, Waugh's proposal was widely debated by the Royal Geographical Society and similar bodies. Other scholars of India put forward native names that they believed to be correct, such as [[Brian Houghton Hodgson]]'s \"Deva-dhunga\" and [[Hermann Schlagintweit]]'s \"Gaurisankar\". Everest himself objected to his name being used, as \"the native of India\" could not pronounce it and it could not be written in [[Hindi]]. Nonetheless, in 1865 the society officially settled on \"Mount Everest\" as the name.<ref>[http://www.everest1953.co.uk/naming-mount-everest Naming Mount Everest]</ref>\n\n==Family==\nSir George had several siblings, including two younger brothers.

He purchased it, sight unseen, from General Whish. Although now virtually derelict, it still has its roof, and there have been various plans to make it into a museum.\n\nBuilt in 1832, the house is known today as Sir George Everest's House and Laboratory, or Park House. The house is situated in Park Estate about {{convert|6|km|mi|0}} west of Gandhi Chowk / Library Bazaar, (the west end of Mall Road in Mussoorie). Its location has panoramic views of the [[Doon Valley]] on one side and the [[Aglar River]] valley and the [[Himalayan Range]] to the north.\n\n[[File:George everest house.jpg|left|thumb|Park House as seen through  weathered [[Tibetan Buddhist]] prayer flags, placed by Mussoorie's longtime Tibetan community, from a vantage point at an angle above.]]\nThe house is under the jurisdiction of the Tourism Department. These underground water cisterns (or perhaps pits for storing ice, although water is scarce in the area) are quite deep and lie uncovered in the front yard outside the house, filled with litter and posing danger of slipping.\n\nThe interior has been stripped but the fireplaces, roof, and the door and window frames still remain. The house is secured by steel grills and cannot be entered. Now that this property is better known and the access road has been improved, the walls are covered with graffiti and then periodically whitewashed clean.\n\nRecent new fencing, tree planting and the construction of a ticket booth (as of late 2015) indicate that at some point it will cost to enter the property. The inside has signs of renovation several years ago, such as ceramic floor tiles in the kitchen and electrical switch boxes. Conservation architects at [[INTACH|the Indian National Trust]] are vying for this project.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* John Keay. 2000.

His suit was dismissed by the [[federal district court]], but on appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] reversed the ruling, concluding that Frederick's speech rights were violated.\n\n[[Chief Justice Roberts]], writing for the majority, concluded that the school officials did not violate the First Amendment. To do so, he made three legal determinations: first, that \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\" doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred \"at a school event\"; second, that the speech was \"reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use\"; and third, that a principal may legally restrict that speech\u2014based on the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools and a school's \"important, indeed, perhaps compelling interest\" in deterring drug use by students.\n\nOne scholar noted that \"by its plain language, ''Morse''{{'}}s holding is narrow in that it expressly applies only to student speech promoting illegal drug use.\"<ref name=\"Dickler\"/> She adds, however, that courts could nonetheless apply it to other student speech that, like speech encouraging illegal drug use, similarly undermines schools' educational missions or threatens students' safety. \"Further, ''Morse'' arguably permits viewpoint discrimination of purely political speech whenever that speech mentions illegal drugs\u2014a result seemingly at odds with the First Amendment.\"<ref name=\"Dickler\"/>\n\n==Background and procedural history{{anchor|Background}}==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bong Hits 4 Jesus banner.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The banner in question]] -->\n[[File:Bong Hits for Jesus.jpg|thumb|left|The original banner now hanging in the [[Newseum]] in [[Washington, DC.]]]]On January 24, 2002, students and staff at [[Juneau-Douglas High School]] in Alaska were permitted to leave classes{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit, which held in favor of Frederick, noted: {{quote|Frederick says that students were simply released from school so that they could watch the privately sponsored Olympic Torch being carried through a public street, and a student affidavit he submitted pointed out that the students did not have to obtain parental permission slips to be released, as is the routine for field trips and other supervised events off the school premises.

Coca-Cola handed out samples in plastic bottles, and students threw them at each other. Students threw snowballs. Some students got into fights. But Frederick and his group did not participate in these disorders, saving their [*1116] energy for what they hoped would be their nationally televised sign display. And, the disruption that took place occurred before the display of the banner, so it could not have been caused by it.</blockquote>\n\nIn subsequent days, there was some pro-drug graffiti in the high school that the principal thought was \"sparked\" by the banner, but the principal did not rip down the sign at the rally because she anticipated or was concerned about such possible consequences. When Principal Morse crossed the street from the school and confronted Frederick about the banner, he asked \"What about the Bill of Rights and freedom of speech?\" She told him to take the banner down because she \"felt that it violated the policy against displaying offensive material, including material that advertises or promotes use of illegal drugs\", and she grabbed it from him and crumpled it up.<ref>''Frederick v.

Fraser]]'', as opposed to ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'', governed Frederick's [[school speech]]. Under this premise, the Court ruled that, given the stipulated facts, Morse and the school board had not infringed Frederick's First Amendment rights, because Morse had reasonably interpreted the banner as contravening the school's policies on [[drug abuse]] prevention.<ref name=MvF4/><ref group=\"nb\">The Court also ruled that, if Frederick's constitutional rights had been violated, Appellees had [[qualified immunity]].</ref>\n\n===Ninth Circuit===\nThe [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] reversed the decision of the District Court. The unanimous panel decision was written by Judge [[Andrew Kleinfeld]].<ref>''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d 1114.</ref>\n\nFirst, the Court decided that the incident should be interpreted under [[school speech|school-speech doctrines]], even though Frederick was standing across the street, and not on school grounds.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit elaborated:\n\n{{quote|One amicus, Drug Policy Alliance, argues that we should analyze this not as a student speech case, but simply as speech on a public sidewalk. That would make the case analogous to a student having an after-school job at a video store that rents out Cheech and Chong tapes, or a student driving a car on public streets with a \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus\" bumper sticker. Were this factually such a case, the law would be easy indeed, but the facts established by the submissions on summary judgment make this a student speech case. Even though Frederick never got to school that morning, that was only because he got stuck in his driveway because of the snow. School had started and the students were released to watch the Olympic torch pass. And even though supervision of most students was minimal or nonexistent, the school could have supervised them more if it chose to, as it did with the gym class and perhaps the pep band and cheerleaders. Frederick was a student, and school was in session.\n\nThere is no genuine issue of fact material to the decision. Frederick's display was not in a class. Frederick and the other students who displayed the sign did not participate in any of the disorderly conduct of the students who threw snowballs or plastic Coca-Cola miniature sample bottles. The school principal and school board do not claim that the display disrupted or was expected to disrupt any classroom work. They concede that their objection to the display, and the reason why the principal ripped down the banner, was not concern that it would cause disruption but that its message would be understood as advocating or promoting illegal drug use. Frederick says that the words were just nonsense meant to attract television cameras because they were funny. We nevertheless proceed on the basis that the banner expressed a positive sentiment about marijuana use, however vague and nonsensical.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>}}|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nThus, for Judge Kleinfeld, \"the question comes down to whether a school may, in the absence of concern about disruption of educational activities, punish and censor non-disruptive, off-campus speech by students during school-authorized activities because the speech promotes a social message contrary to the one favored by the school. The answer under controlling, long-existing precedent is plainly 'No'.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d at 1118.</ref> To reach this determination, the Court inquired whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit explained:\n\n<blockquote>Because this is a section 1983 case in which the Appellees asserted qualified immunity, we are required to proceed in accord with ''Saucier v. Katz'' and determine first whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated. This is an \"as applied\" challenge, not a \"facial\" challenge. Frederick argues that his rights were violated as the regulations were applied to him. Under ''Tinker v.

Starr also cited the cases of ''[[Bethel School District v. Fraser]]'', {{Ussc|478|675|1986}} and ''[[Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]]'', {{Ussc|484|260|1988}}.\n\nStarr noted that in ''Tinker'' there was no written policy; it was an issue of \"standardless discretion\" being exercised.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 10, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> That case was said to be concerned with school disciplinary actions \"casting a pall of orthodoxy to prevent the discussion of ideas\".<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 11, ''Morse v.

Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> He cited the cases of ''[[Board of Education v. Earls]]'' and ''[[Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier|Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]]'' in his favor.\n\nDouglas K. Mertz, of [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]], Alaska, for the respondent opened, \"This is a case about free speech. It is not about drugs.\" [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] responded: \"It's a case about money. Your client wants money from the principal personally for her actions in this case.\" Mertz emphasized that the torch relay was not school-sponsored; that he had not stepped on school property at all before unfurling the banner; that \"BONG HiTS 4 JESUS\" was intended to be\u2014and was regarded as\u2014a purely humorous message; and that the unfurling of the banner did not cause any disruption. Based on these facts, he concludes, his case \"does not present the issue of school authority over student expressions on campus or in a school-sponsored activity\".\n\nStarr rebutted. He cited ''[[Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton]]'' and ''[[Board of Education v. Earls]]'' as cases demonstrative of the Court's strong past stances on matter related to combating the \"scourge of drugs\". In closing and in summary, he said:\n\n{{quote|To promote drugs is utterly inconsistent with the educational mission of the school. The court has spoken more broadly with respect to the need to defer to school officials in identifying the educational mission. We know that there are constitutional limits (to lawful political expression). Those limits are captured in ''Tinker''.

Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref>}}\n\n==Opinions{{anchor|Opinions}}==\n\n===Opinion of the Court===\nChief Justice Roberts, writing for a plurality of four justices, concluded that the school officials did not violate the First Amendment by confiscating the pro-drug banner and suspending the student responsible for it. After reciting the background in Part&nbsp;I of the opinion, in Part&nbsp;II he determined that \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\" doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred \"at a school event\"; Part&nbsp;III determined that the speech was \"reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use\"; and Part&nbsp;IV, inquired whether a principal may legally restrict that speech, concluding that she could\u2014under the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools, and a school's \"important\u2014indeed, perhaps compelling interest\" in deterring drug use by students.\n\n====Speech falls under school speech jurisprudence====\nFirst, Roberts determined that the Court should analyze Frederick's speech under the comparatively strict doctrine of \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\"\u2014rejecting \"at the outset\" Frederick's contention that the case should instead be considered under ordinary free-speech jurisprudence.<ref name=slip5-6>Morse, 551 U.S. at 400-01.</ref> While conceding that past precedent reflects \"some uncertainty at the outer boundaries as to when courts should apply school-speech precedents\",<ref>Here the court provided the following string citation:<br />''[[Porter v. Ascension Parish School Bd.]]'', 393 F. 3d 608, 615, n. 22 (CA5 2004)</ref> Roberts added: \"but not on these facts\".<ref name=slip5-6/> Roberts reiterated the circumstances, then explained: \"Under these circumstances, we agree with the superintendent that Frederick cannot 'stand in the midst of his fellow students, during school hours, at a school-sanctioned activity and claim he is not at school.'\"<ref name=slip5-6/>\n\n====Principal reasonably interpreted speech====\n\nNext, Roberts determined that the principal's conclusion that Frederick's banner \"advocated the use of illegal drugs\" was reasonable. Acknowledging that the banner's message was \"cryptic\", nevertheless it was undeniably a \"reference to illegal drugs\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 402.</ref> In reaching this conclusion, Roberts contrasted \"the paucity of alternative meanings the banner might bear\" against the fact that the two immediately available interpretations of the words support this conclusion:\n{{Quote|First, the phrase could be interpreted as an imperative: \"[Take] bong hits ...\"\u2014a message equivalent, as Morse explained in her declaration, to \"smoke marijuana\" or \"use an illegal drug\". Alternatively, the phrase could be viewed as celebrating drug use\u2014\"bong hits [are a good thing]\", or \"[we take] bong hits\".}}\nAnd even if that second interpretation does not support the principal's conclusions that the banner advocated the use of illegal drugs,\n{{Quote|we discern no meaningful distinction between celebrating illegal drug use in the midst of fellow students and outright advocacy or promotion. See ''[[Guiles v. Marineau]]'', 461 F.3d 320, 328 (CA2 2006) (discussing the present case and describing the sign as \"a clearly pro-drug banner\")}}\nWrapping up this discussion, Roberts rejected the two alternative accounts for Frederick's speech provided in the dissent: first, the dissent noted that Frederick \"just wanted to get on television\", which it characterized as a \"credible and uncontradicted explanation for the message\". Roberts rejoined: \"But that is a description of Frederick's motive for displaying the banner; it is not an interpretation of what the banner says.\" Second, the dissent emphasized the importance of political speech and the need to foster \"national debate about a serious issue\". Roberts rejoined that \"not even Frederick argues that the banner conveys any sort of political or religious message\"; \"this is plainly not a case about political debate over the criminalization of drug use or possession.\"\n\n====First Amendment permits schools to restrict such speech====\nFinally, Roberts inquired whether a principal may restrict such speech. He concluded that she can.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 403.</ref>\n\nHe began by reviewing the court's [[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]] jurisprudence:\n* First, Roberts recapitulated that student expression may be suppressed only if school officials reasonably conclude that it will \"materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school\"\u2014observing however that this doctrine came from a case (''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.]]'') in which the students were engaging in \"political speech\" in \"a silent, passive expression of opinion, unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance\" (wearing armbands, to express \"disapproval of the Vietnam hostilities and their advocacy of a truce, to make their views known, and, by their example, to influence others to adopt them\". Id., at 514), and in which \"[t]he only interest the Court discerned underlying the school's actions was the \"mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint\", or \"an urgent wish to avoid the controversy which might result from the expression\". Roberts commented on this opinion with a quote from ''[[Virginia v. Black]]''\u2014that political speech is \"at the core of what the First Amendment is designed to protect\". 538 U.S. 343, 365 (2003).\n* Second, Roberts cited ''[[Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser]]''. The jurisprudence of ''Fraser'' is controversial, but Roberts declined to apply or resolve the disputed holding of that case (\"We need not resolve this debate to decide this case\"); instead, he explained that \"[f]or present purposes, it is enough to distill from ''Fraser'' two basic principles\":\n::#that \"the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings\" (\"in light of the special characteristics of the school environment\").<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Cohen v. California|volume=403|page=15|pin=|year=1971}}.</ref>\n::#that the \"substantial disruption\" analysis prescribed by Tinker \"is not absolute\" (i.e., it is flexible/optional).<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier|link=Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier|volume=484|page=260}}, 271, n. 4 (1988) (disagreeing with the proposition that there is \"no difference between the First Amendment analysis applied in Tinker and that applied in Fraser\", and noting that the holding in Fraser was not based on any showing of substantial disruption).</ref>\n* Third, Roberts cited the most recent student speech case, ''[[Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier]]''. In that case, the Court permitted a school to \"exercise editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities\" (declining to publish articles in the school paper that \"the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school\") \"so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns\". Roberts found that this case, though factually distinct, was \"nevertheless instructive because it confirms both principles cited above\".\n\nRoberts then cited cases that cited Tinker in the course of interpreting the qualified status that other Constitutional rights acquire in schools\u2014''[[Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton]]'', ''[[New Jersey v. T.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;O.]]'', ''[[Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v. Earls]]''.<!-- this content isn\u2019t appropriate for this article; I am preserving it so I can move it to a new article on school speech.\n* \"while children assuredly do not 'shed their constitutional rights ... at the schoolhouse gate,' ... the nature of those rights is what is appropriate for children in school.\"<ref>Here, Roberts cited to:<br />''[[Vernonia School Dist. 47J v.

It further noted that part of a school's educational mission is \"to educate students about the dangers of illegal drugs and to discourage their use\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 398-99.</ref> The District Court also noted \"peer pressure is perhaps 'the single most important factor leading school children to take drugs.'\"<ref name=MvF14>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 408.</ref> The Court's interpretation of Frederick's banner deemed the banner as a type of peer pressure. Based on these concerns, the opinion concluded that the principal's actions were motivated by a \"serious and palpable\" danger of drug abuse quite different from the amorphous fears of anti-war sentiment at play in ''Tinker''.<ref name=MvF14/>\n\nIn ''Tinker'', the school principal had punished students for wearing black anti-war armbands based on his \"undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance\" or \"mere desire to avoid ... discomfort and unpleasantness\".<ref name=MvF14/> Here, however, the concern about student drug abuse \"extends well beyond an abstract desire to avoid controversy\".<ref name=MvF14/> Principal Morse's failure to act against the banner \"would send a powerful message to the students in her charge, including Frederick, about how serious the school was about the dangers of illegal drug use\".<ref name=MvF15>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 410.</ref> The First Amendment, concluded the opinion, \"does not require schools to tolerate at school events student expression that contributes to those dangers\".<ref name=MvF15/>\n\n===Concurrences===\nJustice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote a concurrence that argued that students in public schools do not have a right to free speech and that ''Tinker'' should be overturned. Thomas wrote, \"In my view, the history of public education suggests that the First Amendment, as originally understood, does not protect student speech in public schools.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 410-11 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> He praised [[Hugo Black]]'s dissenting opinion on ''Tinker'' and called it \"prophetic\". Thomas cited the doctrine of ''[[in loco parentis]]'', meaning \"in place of the parent\", in his opinion. He traced the history of public education in America back to its colonial roots. According to Thomas, because originally public schools were intended to substitute for private tutors, public schools could discipline students as they liked and had a far stronger hand in what happened in the classroom. \"In short\", he continues, \"in the earliest public schools, teachers taught, and students listened. Teachers commanded, and students obeyed.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 412 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> He opined that because parents entrusted the care of their children to teachers, teachers have a right to act in the place of parents during school hours. Therefore, teachers should be able to discipline students if necessary. Thomas lambasted ''Tinker'' for \"usurping [the local school district as a] traditional authority for the judiciary\".<ref name=Thomas421>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 421 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> Thomas believed that Frederick was neither speaking gibberish nor openly advocating drug use, but granting such an impertinence constitutional protection \"would ... be to 'surrender control of the American public school system to public school students.'\"<ref name=Thomas421/>\n\nJustice [[Samuel Alito]], joined by Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], wrote a concurrence indicating that he agreed with the majority opinion to the extent that:\n\n{{quote|(a) it goes no further than to hold that a public school may restrict speech that a reasonable observer would interpret as advocating illegal drug use and (b) it provides no support for any restriction of speech that can plausibly be interpreted as commenting on any political or social issue, including speech on issues such as \"the wisdom of the war on drugs or of legalizing marijuana for medicinal use\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 422 (Alito, J., concurring).</ref>}}\n\nAlito agreed that Morse did not violate Frederick's First Amendment rights and emphasized in his concurrence that the holding only applies to students who advocate illegal drug use. He opposed the \"educational mission\" and ''[[in loco parentis]]'' analysis in favor of a \"special characteristic\" of schools that he identifies to be ensuring the physical safety of the students. Alito concluded that an exception must be made to the First Amendment free speech guarantee to protect the students; since according to Alito, advocating illegal drugs possibly leads to violence. But Alito insisted that this small reduction of what is protected by the First Amendment is \"at the far reaches of what the First Amendment permits\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 426 (Alito, J., concurring).</ref>\n\n===Concurrence in part and dissent in part===\nJustice [[Stephen Breyer]] concurred in the judgment in part and dissented in part, arguing that the Court should not have directly answered the First Amendment question in the case, but rather decided it based on [[qualified immunity]]. Qualified immunity is an [[affirmative defense]] that requires courts to enter judgment in favor of a government employee accused of violating individual rights unless the employee's conduct violates \"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 429 (Breyer, J., concurring).</ref> Because it was not clear whether the school principal's actions in taking down the banner violated the First Amendment, Breyer would have simply issued a narrow decision indicating that she was shielded by qualified immunity and gone no further.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 425-26 (Breyer, J., concurring).</ref>\n\n===Dissent===\nJustice [[John Paul Stevens]], in a dissent joined by Justice [[David Souter|Souter]] and Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]], argued that \"the Court does serious violence to the First Amendment in upholding\u2014indeed, lauding\u2014a school's decision to punish Frederick for expressing a view with which it disagreed.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 435 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref> Stevens wrote:\n\n{{quote|... the school's interest in protecting its students from exposure to speech 'reasonably regarded as promoting illegal drug use' ... cannot justify disciplining Frederick for his attempt to make an ambiguous statement to a television audience simply because it contained an oblique reference to drugs. The First Amendment demands more, indeed, much more.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 434 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref>}}\n\nStevens criticized the majority decision as one that \"trivializes the two cardinal principles upon which ''Tinker'' rests\", because it \"upholds a punishment meted out on the basis of a listener's disagreement with her understanding (or, more likely, misunderstanding) of the speaker's viewpoint\".<ref name=SJ5>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 437 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref> Moreover, he noted, \"Encouraging drug use might well increase the likelihood that a listener will try an illegal drug, but that hardly justifies censorship\".<ref name=SJ5/> \"[C]arving out pro-drug speech for uniquely harsh treatment finds no support in our case law and is inimical to the values protected by the First Amendment.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 438-39 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref>\n\nStevens also took issue with the majority's interpretation of the banner as being a serious incitement to drug use:\n\n{{quote|Admittedly, some high school students (including those who use drugs) are dumb.

These tragic events led to a significant number of cases and articles on the subject of school violence. For example, in Wisniewski, a student was suspended after school officials learned of an instant messenger icon he had created that depicted the shooting of his English teacher. 494 F.3d at 35. In one of the few decisions citing to Morse, the Second Circuit declined to consider whether the true threat doctrine was relevant, and instead applied ''Tinker'''s substantial disruption test. Id. at 38\u201339. The court held that the school did not violate the student's First Amendment rights by suspending him because it was reasonably foreseeable that the icon would come to school officials' attention and cause a disruption at school. Id. at 39\u201340.\n\nFor a discussion of the true threat doctrine's application to student speech, see Andrew P. Stanner, Note, Toward an Improved True Threat Doctrine for Student Speakers, 81 ''NYU Law Review'', 385 (2006).

Frederick'': How Will ''Morse v. Frederick'' Be Applied?\" 12 ''Lewis & Clark Law Review'', 1</ref> noting that Chief Justice Roberts \"sought to keep the decision quite narrow\", limiting the case \"to the issue of public school administrators' ability to keep the educational process free from messages about illegal drugs\" and drawing from the Court's existing student speech jurisprudence that \"permitted school administrators broad discretion to keep out of the educational environment antisocial messages celebrating drug use\".<ref name=lewisclark />\n\n===Erwin Chemerinsky===\nLeading constitutional law scholar [[Erwin Chemerinsky]] participated in the same symposium, exploring how this decision would be understood and applied by school officials, school boards, and lower court judges. He suggested that the opinion was misguided and\u2014from a First Amendment perspective\u2014highly undesirable, arguing that the decision cannot be justified under existing First Amendment principles, that it could be seen as authorizing punishment of students for speech that is deemed distasteful or offensive, even just juvenile. However, he noted Justice Alito's concurring opinion, which suggests that the majority opinion might be exceedingly narrow and based on a very unusual factual context; Chemerinsky noted that if Justice Alito's opinion is seen as defining the scope of the holding, then the case establishes only the power of schools to punish speech encouraging illegal drug use rather than giving school officials great discretion to punish student speech. Thus, despite the fact that ''Morse v. Frederick'' is consistent with decisions from the Supreme Court and lower federal courts over the last two decades, his hope is that Chief Justice Roberts's majority opinion will be read through the prism of Justice Alito's concurring opinion, thereby having little effect on the already very limited First Amendment rights of students.<ref name=lewisclark />\n\n==Subsequent judicial interpretation==\nMelinda Cupps Dickler noted that \"The few courts that have discussed Morse have disagreed about the breadth of its holding,\"<ref name=\"Dickler\">Melinda Cupps Dickler (Visiting Assistant Professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, Illinois Institute of Technology), \"The Morse Quartet: Student Speech And The First Amendment\", 53 ''Loyola Law Review'', 355. {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.1009601 }}</ref> supporting this claim with the following citations:\n\n::Compare ''Lowery v.

Fulton County Sch. Dist.'', 494 F.3d 978, 9984 (11th Cir. 2007) (holding that Morse's holding is broad). The ''Layshock'' court stated that ''Morse'' did not change the basic framework established by the ''Tinker'' trilogy, which it described as a scheme in which ''Fraser'' and ''Kuhlmeier'' are exceptions to ''Tinker's'' general rule. ''Layshock'', 496 F. Supp. 2d at 596. Significantly, however, the court cited to both ''Morse'' and ''Tinker'' as requiring courts to defer to school officials' decisions about punishing student speech. ''Id''. at 597. On the other hand, the court also accepted Justice Alito's concurring argument in ''Morse'' when it held that ''Morse'' does not permit school officials to regulate student speech merely on the basis that it is incompatible with the schools' educational missions. ''Id''. at 599.\n\n::By contrast, the Eleventh Circuit extended ''Morse's'' rationale about illegal drugs to the context of student speech that is \"construed as a threat of school violence\". ''Boim'', 494 F.3d at 984 (upholding the suspension of a high school student for a story labeled as a \"dream\" in which she described shooting her math teacher). Moreover, the court concluded that Morse supports the idea that student speech can be regulated where \"[in] a school administrator's professional observation ... certain expressions [of student speech] have led to, and therefore could lead to, an unhealthy and potentially unsafe learning environment\". Id. at 983 (quoting ''Scott v. Sch. Bd.'', 324 F.3d 1246, 1247 (11th Cir. 2003)). Some commentators predict that courts will extend Morse to further restrict protection for student speech.

To do so, he made three legal determinations: first, that \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\" doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred \"at a school event\"; second, that the speech was \"reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use\"; and third, that a principal may legally restrict that speech\u2014based on the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools and a school's \"important, indeed, perhaps compelling interest\" in deterring drug use by students.\n\nOne scholar noted that \"by its plain language, ''Morse''{{'}}s holding is narrow in that it expressly applies only to student speech promoting illegal drug use.\"<ref name=\"Dickler\"/> She adds, however, that courts could nonetheless apply it to other student speech that, like speech encouraging illegal drug use, similarly undermines schools' educational missions or threatens students' safety. \"Further, ''Morse'' arguably permits viewpoint discrimination of purely political speech whenever that speech mentions illegal drugs\u2014a result seemingly at odds with the First Amendment.\"<ref name=\"Dickler\"/>\n\n==Background and procedural history{{anchor|Background}}==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bong Hits 4 Jesus banner.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The banner in question]] -->\n[[File:Bong Hits for Jesus.jpg|thumb|left|The original banner now hanging in the [[Newseum]] in [[Washington, DC.]]]]On January 24, 2002, students and staff at [[Juneau-Douglas High School]] in Alaska were permitted to leave classes{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit, which held in favor of Frederick, noted: {{quote|Frederick says that students were simply released from school so that they could watch the privately sponsored Olympic Torch being carried through a public street, and a student affidavit he submitted pointed out that the students did not have to obtain parental permission slips to be released, as is the routine for field trips and other supervised events off the school premises.

Frederick then appealed to the Juneau School Board, which upheld the suspension on March 19, 2002.\n\n===District court===\n{{Youth rights sidebar|Activities}}\nOn April&nbsp;25, 2002, Frederick filed a [[Civil Rights Act of 1871|civil rights]] lawsuit (under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983) against Morse and the school board, claiming they violated his federal and state constitutional rights to free speech.<ref name=Mears/> He sought a [[declaratory relief]] (for a declaratory judgment that his First Amendment rights had been violated), [[Injunction|injunctive]] relief (for an injunction to remove the reference to the ten-day suspension from his school records), and monetary awards ([[Compensatory damages#Compensatory damages|compensatory damages]], [[punitive damages]], and [[attorney's fee]]s).<ref name=MvF4>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 399.</ref>\n\nThe [[United States District Court for the District of Alaska]] dismissed Frederick's case on [[summary judgment]].<ref>''Frederick v.

Fraser]]'', as opposed to ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'', governed Frederick's [[school speech]]. Under this premise, the Court ruled that, given the stipulated facts, Morse and the school board had not infringed Frederick's First Amendment rights, because Morse had reasonably interpreted the banner as contravening the school's policies on [[drug abuse]] prevention.<ref name=MvF4/><ref group=\"nb\">The Court also ruled that, if Frederick's constitutional rights had been violated, Appellees had [[qualified immunity]].</ref>\n\n===Ninth Circuit===\nThe [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] reversed the decision of the District Court. The unanimous panel decision was written by Judge [[Andrew Kleinfeld]].<ref>''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d 1114.</ref>\n\nFirst, the Court decided that the incident should be interpreted under [[school speech|school-speech doctrines]], even though Frederick was standing across the street, and not on school grounds.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit elaborated:\n\n{{quote|One amicus, Drug Policy Alliance, argues that we should analyze this not as a student speech case, but simply as speech on a public sidewalk. That would make the case analogous to a student having an after-school job at a video store that rents out Cheech and Chong tapes, or a student driving a car on public streets with a \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus\" bumper sticker. Were this factually such a case, the law would be easy indeed, but the facts established by the submissions on summary judgment make this a student speech case. Even though Frederick never got to school that morning, that was only because he got stuck in his driveway because of the snow. School had started and the students were released to watch the Olympic torch pass. And even though supervision of most students was minimal or nonexistent, the school could have supervised them more if it chose to, as it did with the gym class and perhaps the pep band and cheerleaders. Frederick was a student, and school was in session.\n\nThere is no genuine issue of fact material to the decision. Frederick's display was not in a class. Frederick and the other students who displayed the sign did not participate in any of the disorderly conduct of the students who threw snowballs or plastic Coca-Cola miniature sample bottles. The school principal and school board do not claim that the display disrupted or was expected to disrupt any classroom work. They concede that their objection to the display, and the reason why the principal ripped down the banner, was not concern that it would cause disruption but that its message would be understood as advocating or promoting illegal drug use. Frederick says that the words were just nonsense meant to attract television cameras because they were funny. We nevertheless proceed on the basis that the banner expressed a positive sentiment about marijuana use, however vague and nonsensical.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>}}|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nThus, for Judge Kleinfeld, \"the question comes down to whether a school may, in the absence of concern about disruption of educational activities, punish and censor non-disruptive, off-campus speech by students during school-authorized activities because the speech promotes a social message contrary to the one favored by the school. The answer under controlling, long-existing precedent is plainly 'No'.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d at 1118.</ref> To reach this determination, the Court inquired whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit explained:\n\n<blockquote>Because this is a section 1983 case in which the Appellees asserted qualified immunity, we are required to proceed in accord with ''Saucier v. Katz'' and determine first whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated. This is an \"as applied\" challenge, not a \"facial\" challenge. Frederick argues that his rights were violated as the regulations were applied to him. Under ''Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District'', they plainly were.</blockquote> (See also: ''[[Saucier v. Katz]]''.) |group=\"nb\"}}.

Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> He defined the disruptiveness in general terms as behavior inimical to the educational mission of the school, and in specific terms as violation of the school's announced policy to enforce and support laws with respect to control of marijuana (and other laws in general). Starr also cited the cases of ''[[Bethel School District v. Fraser]]'', {{Ussc|478|675|1986}} and ''[[Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]]'', {{Ussc|484|260|1988}}.\n\nStarr noted that in ''Tinker'' there was no written policy; it was an issue of \"standardless discretion\" being exercised.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 10, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> That case was said to be concerned with school disciplinary actions \"casting a pall of orthodoxy to prevent the discussion of ideas\".<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 11, ''Morse v.

Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> He cited the cases of ''[[Board of Education v. Earls]]'' and ''[[Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier|Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]]'' in his favor.\n\nDouglas K. Mertz, of [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]], Alaska, for the respondent opened, \"This is a case about free speech. It is not about drugs.\" [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] responded: \"It's a case about money. Your client wants money from the principal personally for her actions in this case.\" Mertz emphasized that the torch relay was not school-sponsored; that he had not stepped on school property at all before unfurling the banner; that \"BONG HiTS 4 JESUS\" was intended to be\u2014and was regarded as\u2014purely a humorous message; and that the unfurling of the banner did not cause any disruption. Based on these facts, he concludes, his case \"does not present the issue of school authority over student expressions on campus or in a school-sponsored activity\".\n\nStarr rebutted. He cited ''[[Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton]]'' and ''[[Board of Education v. Earls]]'' as cases demonstrative of the Court's strong past stances on matter related to combating the \"scourge of drugs\". In closing and in summary, he said:\n\n{{quote|To promote drugs is utterly inconsistent with the educational mission of the school. The court has spoken more broadly with respect to the need to defer to school officials in identifying the educational mission. We know that there are constitutional limits (to lawful political expression). Those limits are captured in ''Tinker''.

Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref>}}\n\n==Opinions{{anchor|Opinions}}==\n\n===Opinion of the Court===\nChief Justice Roberts, writing for a plurality of four justices, concluded that the school officials did not violate the First Amendment by confiscating the pro-drug banner and suspending the student responsible for it. After reciting the background in Part&nbsp;I of the opinion, in Part&nbsp;II he determined that \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\" doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred \"at a school event\"; Part&nbsp;III determined that the speech was \"reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use\"; and Part&nbsp;IV, inquired whether a principal may legally restrict that speech, concluding that she could\u2014under the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools, and a school's \"important\u2014indeed, perhaps compelling interest\" in deterring drug use by students.\n\n====Speech falls under school speech jurisprudence====\nFirst, Roberts determined that the Court should analyze Frederick's speech under the comparatively strict doctrine of \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\"\u2014rejecting \"at the outset\" Frederick's contention that the case should instead be considered under ordinary free-speech jurisprudence.<ref name=slip5-6>Morse, 551 U.S. at 400-01.</ref> While conceding that past precedent reflects \"some uncertainty at the outer boundaries as to when courts should apply school-speech precedents\",<ref>Here the court provided the following string citation:<br />''[[Porter v. Ascension Parish School Bd.]]'', 393 F. 3d 608, 615, n. 22 (CA5 2004)</ref> Roberts added: \"but not on these facts\".<ref name=slip5-6/> Roberts reiterated the circumstances, then explained: \"Under these circumstances, we agree with the superintendent that Frederick cannot 'stand in the midst of his fellow students, during school hours, at a school-sanctioned activity and claim he is not at school.'\"<ref name=slip5-6/>\n\n====Principal reasonably interpreted speech====\n\nNext, Roberts determined that the principal's conclusion that Frederick's banner \"advocated the use of illegal drugs\" was reasonable. Acknowledging that the banner's message was \"cryptic\", nevertheless it was undeniably a \"reference to illegal drugs\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 402.</ref> In reaching this conclusion, Roberts contrasted \"the paucity of alternative meanings the banner might bear\" against the fact that the two immediately available interpretations of the words support this conclusion:\n{{Quote|First, the phrase could be interpreted as an imperative: \"[Take] bong hits ...\"\u2014a message equivalent, as Morse explained in her declaration, to \"smoke marijuana\" or \"use an illegal drug\". Alternatively, the phrase could be viewed as celebrating drug use\u2014\"bong hits [are a good thing]\", or \"[we take] bong hits\".}}\nAnd even if that second interpretation does not support the principal's conclusions that the banner advocated the use of illegal drugs,\n{{Quote|we discern no meaningful distinction between celebrating illegal drug use in the midst of fellow students and outright advocacy or promotion. See ''[[Guiles v. Marineau]]'', 461 F.3d 320, 328 (CA2 2006) (discussing the present case and describing the sign as \"a clearly pro-drug banner\")}}\nWrapping up this discussion, Roberts rejected the two alternative accounts for Frederick's speech provided in the dissent: first, the dissent noted that Frederick \"just wanted to get on television\", which it characterized as a \"credible and uncontradicted explanation for the message\". Roberts rejoined: \"But that is a description of Frederick's motive for displaying the banner; it is not an interpretation of what the banner says.\" Second, the dissent emphasized the importance of political speech and the need to foster \"national debate about a serious issue\". Roberts rejoined that \"not even Frederick argues that the banner conveys any sort of political or religious message\"; \"this is plainly not a case about political debate over the criminalization of drug use or possession.\"\n\n====First Amendment permits schools to restrict such speech====\nFinally, Roberts inquired whether a principal may restrict such speech. He concluded that she can.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 403.</ref>\n\nHe began by reviewing the court's [[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]] jurisprudence:\n* First, Roberts recapitulated that student expression may be suppressed only if school officials reasonably conclude that it will \"materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school\"\u2014observing however that this doctrine came from a case (''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.]]'') in which the students were engaging in \"political speech\" in \"a silent, passive expression of opinion, unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance\" (wearing armbands, to express \"disapproval of the Vietnam hostilities and their advocacy of a truce, to make their views known, and, by their example, to influence others to adopt them\". Id., at 514), and in which \"[t]he only interest the Court discerned underlying the school's actions was the \"mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint\", or \"an urgent wish to avoid the controversy which might result from the expression\". Roberts commented on this opinion with a quote from ''[[Virginia v. Black]]''\u2014that political speech is \"at the core of what the First Amendment is designed to protect\". 538 U.S. 343, 365 (2003).\n* Second, Roberts cited ''[[Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser]]''. The jurisprudence of ''Fraser'' is controversial, but Roberts declined to apply or resolve the disputed holding of that case (\"We need not resolve this debate to decide this case\"); instead, he explained that \"[f]or present purposes, it is enough to distill from ''Fraser'' two basic principles\":\n::#that \"the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings\" (\"in light of the special characteristics of the school environment\").<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Cohen v. California|volume=403|page=15|pin=|year=1971}}.</ref>\n::#that the \"substantial disruption\" analysis prescribed by Tinker \"is not absolute\" (i.e., it is flexible/optional).<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier|link=Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier|volume=484|page=260}}, 271, n. 4 (1988) (disagreeing with the proposition that there is \"no difference between the First Amendment analysis applied in Tinker and that applied in Fraser\", and noting that the holding in Fraser was not based on any showing of substantial disruption).</ref>\n* Third, Roberts cited the most recent student speech case, ''[[Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier]]''. In that case, the Court permitted a school to \"exercise editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities\" (declining to publish articles in the school paper that \"the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school\") \"so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns\". Roberts found that this case, though factually distinct, was \"nevertheless instructive because it confirms both principles cited above\".\n\nRoberts then cited cases that cited Tinker in the course of interpreting the qualified status that other Constitutional rights acquire in schools\u2014''[[Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton]]'', ''[[New Jersey v. T.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;O.]]'', ''[[Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v.

It further noted that part of a school's educational mission is \"to educate students about the dangers of illegal drugs and to discourage their use\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 398-99.</ref> The District Court also noted \"peer pressure is perhaps 'the single most important factor leading school children to take drugs.'\"<ref name=MvF14>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 408.</ref> The Court's interpretation of Frederick's banner deemed the banner as a type of peer pressure. Based on these concerns, the opinion concluded that the principal's actions were motivated by a \"serious and palpable\" danger of drug abuse quite different from the amorphous fears of anti-war sentiment at play in ''Tinker''.<ref name=MvF14/>\n\nIn ''Tinker'', the school principal had punished students for wearing black anti-war armbands based on his \"undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance\" or \"mere desire to avoid ... discomfort and unpleasantness\".<ref name=MvF14/> Here, however, the concern about student drug abuse \"extends well beyond an abstract desire to avoid controversy\".<ref name=MvF14/> Principal Morse's failure to act against the banner \"would send a powerful message to the students in her charge, including Frederick, about how serious the school was about the dangers of illegal drug use\".<ref name=MvF15>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 410.</ref> The First Amendment, concluded the opinion, \"does not require schools to tolerate at school events student expression that contributes to those dangers\".<ref name=MvF15/>\n\n===Concurrences===\nJustice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote a concurrence that argued that students in public schools do not have a right to free speech and that ''Tinker'' should be overturned. Thomas wrote, \"In my view, the history of public education suggests that the First Amendment, as originally understood, does not protect student speech in public schools.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 410-11 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> He praised [[Hugo Black]]'s dissenting opinion on ''Tinker'' and called it \"prophetic\". Thomas cited the doctrine of ''[[in loco parentis]]'', meaning \"in place of the parent\", in his opinion. He traced the history of public education in America back to its colonial roots. According to Thomas, because originally public schools were intended to substitute for private tutors, public schools could discipline students as they liked and had a far stronger hand in what happened in the classroom. \"In short\", he continues, \"in the earliest public schools, teachers taught, and students listened. Teachers commanded, and students obeyed.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 412 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> He opined that because parents entrusted the care of their children to teachers, teachers have a right to act in the place of parents during school hours. Therefore, teachers should be able to discipline students if necessary. Thomas lambasted ''Tinker'' for \"usurping [the local school district as a] traditional authority for the judiciary\".<ref name=Thomas421>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 421 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> Thomas believed that Frederick was neither speaking gibberish nor openly advocating drug use, but granting such an impertinence constitutional protection \"would ... be to 'surrender control of the American public school system to public school students.'\"<ref name=Thomas421/>\n\nJustice [[Samuel Alito]], joined by Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], wrote a concurrence indicating that he agreed with the majority opinion to the extent that:\n\n{{quote|(a) it goes no further than to hold that a public school may restrict speech that a reasonable observer would interpret as advocating illegal drug use and (b) it provides no support for any restriction of speech that can plausibly be interpreted as commenting on any political or social issue, including speech on issues such as \"the wisdom of the war on drugs or of legalizing marijuana for medicinal use\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 422 (Alito, J., concurring).</ref>}}\n\nAlito agreed that Morse did not violate Frederick's First Amendment rights and emphasized in his concurrence that the holding only applies to students who advocate illegal drug use. He opposed the \"educational mission\" and ''[[in loco parentis]]'' analysis in favor of a \"special characteristic\" of schools that he identifies to be ensuring the physical safety of the students. Alito concluded that an exception must be made to the First Amendment free speech guarantee to protect the students; since according to Alito, advocating illegal drugs possibly leads to violence. But Alito insisted that this small reduction of what is protected by the First Amendment is \"at the far reaches of what the First Amendment permits\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 426 (Alito, J., concurring).</ref>\n\n===Concurrence in part and dissent in part===\nJustice [[Stephen Breyer]] concurred in the judgment in part and dissented in part, arguing that the Court should not have directly answered the First Amendment question in the case, but rather decided it based on [[qualified immunity]].

The First Amendment demands more, indeed, much more.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 434 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref>}}\n\nStevens criticized the majority decision as one that \"trivializes the two cardinal principles upon which ''Tinker'' rests\", because it \"upholds a punishment meted out on the basis of a listener's disagreement with her understanding (or, more likely, misunderstanding) of the speaker's viewpoint\".<ref name=SJ5>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 437 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref> Moreover, he noted, \"Encouraging drug use might well increase the likelihood that a listener will try an illegal drug, but that hardly justifies censorship\".<ref name=SJ5/> \"[C]arving out pro-drug speech for uniquely harsh treatment finds no support in our case law and is inimical to the values protected by the First Amendment.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 438-39 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref>\n\nStevens also took issue with the majority's interpretation of the banner as being a serious incitement to drug use:\n\n{{quote|Admittedly, some high school students (including those who use drugs) are dumb. Most students, however, do not shed their brains at the schoolhouse gate, and most students know dumb advocacy when they see it.

These tragic events led to a significant number of cases and articles on the subject of school violence. For example, in Wisniewski, a student was suspended after school officials learned of an instant messenger icon he had created that depicted the shooting of his English teacher. 494 F.3d at 35. In one of the few decisions citing to Morse, the Second Circuit declined to consider whether the true threat doctrine was relevant, and instead applied ''Tinker'''s substantial disruption test. Id. at 38\u201339. The court held that the school did not violate the student's First Amendment rights by suspending him because it was reasonably foreseeable that the icon would come to school officials' attention and cause a disruption at school. Id. at 39\u201340.\n\nFor a discussion of the true threat doctrine's application to student speech, see Andrew P. Stanner, Note, Toward an Improved True Threat Doctrine for Student Speakers, 81 ''NYU Law Review'', 385 (2006).

Frederick'': How Will ''Morse v. Frederick'' Be Applied?\" 12 ''Lewis & Clark Law Review'', 1</ref> noting that Chief Justice Roberts \"sought to keep the decision quite narrow\", limiting the case \"to the issue of public school administrators' ability to keep the educational process free from messages about illegal drugs\" and drawing from the Court's existing student speech jurisprudence that \"permitted school administrators broad discretion to keep out of the educational environment antisocial messages celebrating drug use\".<ref name=lewisclark />\n\n===Erwin Chemerinsky===\nLeading constitutional law scholar [[Erwin Chemerinsky]] participated in the same symposium, exploring how this decision would be understood and applied by school officials, school boards, and lower court judges. He suggested that the opinion was misguided and\u2014from a First Amendment perspective\u2014highly undesirable, arguing that the decision cannot be justified under existing First Amendment principles, that it could be seen as authorizing punishment of students for speech that is deemed distasteful or offensive, even just juvenile. However, he noted Justice Alito's concurring opinion, which suggests that the majority opinion might be exceedingly narrow and based on a very unusual factual context; Chemerinsky noted that if Justice Alito's opinion is seen as defining the scope of the holding, then the case establishes only the power of schools to punish speech encouraging illegal drug use rather than giving school officials great discretion to punish student speech. Thus, despite the fact that ''Morse v. Frederick'' is consistent with decisions from the Supreme Court and lower federal courts over the last two decades, his hope is that Chief Justice Roberts's majority opinion will be read through the prism of Justice Alito's concurring opinion, thereby having little effect on the already very limited First Amendment rights of students.<ref name=lewisclark />\n\n==Subsequent judicial interpretation==\nMelinda Cupps Dickler noted that \"The few courts that have discussed Morse have disagreed about the breadth of its holding,\"<ref name=\"Dickler\">Melinda Cupps Dickler (Visiting Assistant Professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, Illinois Institute of Technology), \"The Morse Quartet: Student Speech And The First Amendment\", 53 ''Loyola Law Review'', 355. {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.1009601 }}</ref> supporting this claim with the following citations:\n\n::Compare ''Lowery v.

Fulton County Sch. Dist.'', 494 F.3d 978, 9984 (11th Cir. 2007) (holding that Morse's holding is broad). The ''Layshock'' court stated that ''Morse'' did not change the basic framework established by the ''Tinker'' trilogy, which it described as a scheme in which ''Fraser'' and ''Kuhlmeier'' are exceptions to ''Tinker's'' general rule. ''Layshock'', 496 F. Supp. 2d at 596. Significantly, however, the court cited to both ''Morse'' and ''Tinker'' as requiring courts to defer to school officials' decisions about punishing student speech. ''Id''. at 597. On the other hand, the court also accepted Justice Alito's concurring argument in ''Morse'' when it held that ''Morse'' does not permit school officials to regulate student speech merely on the basis that it is incompatible with the schools' educational missions. ''Id''. at 599.\n\n::By contrast, the Eleventh Circuit extended ''Morse's'' rationale about illegal drugs to the context of student speech that is \"construed as a threat of school violence\". ''Boim'', 494 F.3d at 984 (upholding the suspension of a high school student for a story labeled as a \"dream\" in which she described shooting her math teacher). Moreover, the court concluded that Morse supports the idea that student speech can be regulated where \"[in] a school administrator's professional observation ... certain expressions [of student speech] have led to, and therefore could lead to, an unhealthy and potentially unsafe learning environment\". Id. at 983 (quoting ''Scott v. Sch. Bd.'', 324 F.3d 1246, 1247 (11th Cir. 2003)). Some commentators predict that courts will extend Morse to further restrict protection for student speech.
