Craig and Karen Tracy published \"Grounded Practical Theory: The case of Intellectual Discussion\"!{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995}} This was an attempt by Craig and Tracy to create a methodological model using [[discourse analysis]] which will \"guide the development and assessment of [[normative]] theories.\"{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=250}} Craig and Tracy argue that the communication discipline has been dominated by scientific theory which is concerned with what ''is,'' while [[Normative|normative theories]] are centrally concerned with ''what ought to be.''{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=249}} This neglect of normative theories \"limits the practical usefulness of communication studies.\"{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=249}}\n\nGrounded practical theory (GPT) is a [[Metatheory|metatheoretical]] approach based on Craig's (1989) notion of communication as a practical, rather than [[Empirical|scientific]], discipline.{{sfn|Craig|1989}}{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=250-253}} The goal of communication as a practical discipline is to develop [[Normative|normative theories]] to guide practice.{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=250, 264-265}} Based on this argument, GPT was developed as a methodologically grounded means of theorizing communication practices.{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=250,253, 264}} GPT involves (1) reconstructing communicative practices, (2) redescribing those practices in less context-specific terms, and (3) identifying implicit principles which guide the practice. Generally a GPT study begins by looking for troubles or dilemmas endemic to situated interaction and observable in discourse. This constitutes the \u201cproblem level\u201d{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=253}} and the \u201cgrounded\u201d component of the GPT approach.{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=266}} Then, problems are reconstructed concretely and abstractly and matched with the techniques which participants employ for dealing with those problems. This constitutes the \u201ctechnical level\u201d{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=253}} and is an important part of the theorizing process. Finally, the ideals and standards shaping the practice and how to manage its problems and techniques constitute the \u201cphilosophical level.\u201d{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=253}} This situates the practice both locally and generally for the purpose of normative critique. A methodological approach which is explicitly guided by GPT is action implicative discourse analysis (AIDA).{{sfn|Tracy|2004}}{{sfn|Tracy|2007}}{{sfn|Tracy|Craig|2010}}\n\n==''Communication Theory as a Field''==\n{{main|Communication Theory as a Field}}\nIn 1999 Craig wrote a landmark article{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008|pp=6}} \"Communication Theory as a Field\"{{sfn|Craig|1999}} which expanded the conversation regarding disciplinary identity in the field of communication.{{sfn|Donsback|2006}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008|pp=6}}{{sfn|Penman|2000}}{{sfn|Anderson|Baym|2004}}{{sfn|Lindlof|Taylor|2002}}{{sfn|D'Angelo|2002}}{{sfn|Jimenez|Guillem|2009}} At that time, communication theory textbooks had little to no agreement on how to present the field or what theories to include in their textbooks.{{sfn|Anderson|1996|pp=200-201}}{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=120}}  This article has since become the foundational framework for four different textbooks to introduce the field of communication.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=125}}{{sfn|Craig|Muller|2007}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}}{{sfn|Griffin|2006}}{{sfn|Miller|2005}} In this article Craig \"proposes a vision for communication theory that takes a huge step toward unifying this rather disparate field and addressing its complexities.\"{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}} To move toward this unifying vision Craig focused on [[communication theory]] as a practical discipline and shows how \"various traditions of communication theory can be engaged in dialogue on the practice of communication.\"{{sfn|Craig|2006|pp=13}}{{sfn|Penman|2000|pp=6, 76}}  In this deliberative process theorists would engage in dialog about the \"practical implications of communication theories.\"{{sfn|Craig|2001}} In the end Craig proposes seven different traditions of Communication Theory and outlines how each one of them would engage the others in dialogue.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132-146}}\n\nCraig proposes that these seven suggested traditions of communication theory have emerged through research into communication, and each one has their own way of understanding communication.{{sfn|Anderson|Baym|2004|pp=440}}{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132-134}}  These seven traditions are:\n#[[Rhetoric]]al: views communication as the practical art of discourse.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=135-136}}\n#[[Semiotic]]: views communication as the mediation by signs.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=136-138}}\n#[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenological]]: communication is the experience of dialogue with others.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=138-140}}\n#[[cybernetics|Cybernetic]]: communication is the flow of information.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=141-142}}\n#[[Social psychology (sociology)|Socio-psychological]]: communication is the interaction of individuals.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=142-144}}\n#[[sociocultural|Socio-cultural]]: communication is the production and reproduction of the social order.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=144-146}}\n#[[Critical theory|Critical]]: communication is the process in which all assumptions can be challenged.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=146-149}}\n\nThese proposed seven traditions of communication theory are then placed into conversation with each other on a [https://web.archive.org/web/20110805152813/http://www.colorado.edu/communication/meta-discourses/Bibliography/Craig%20(1999)/tables.html a table]{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=133-134}} first to show how each tradition's different interpretation of communication defines the tradition's vocabulary, communication problems, and commonplaces,{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132,133}} and next to show what argumentation between the traditions would look like.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132,134}}\n\nCraig concluded this article with an open invitation to explore how the differences in these theories might shed light on key issues, show where new traditions could be created, and engaging communication theory with communication problems through metadiscourse. {{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=149}} Craig further proposes several future traditions that could possibly be fit into the metamodel.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=149,151}} A feminist tradition where communication is theorized as \"connectedness to others\", an aesthetic tradition theorizing communication as \"embodied performance\", an economic tradition theorizing communication as \"exchange\", and a spiritual tradition theorizing communication on a \"nonmaterial or mystical plane of existence.\" {{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=151}}\n\n==Publications==\n\n===Books and chapters===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!

Craig and Karen Tracy published \"Grounded Practical Theory: The case of Intellectual Discussion\"!{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995}} This was an attempt by Craig and Tracy to create a methodological model using [[discourse analysis]] which will \"guide the development and assessment of [[normative]] theories.\"{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=250}} Craig and Tracy argue that the communication discipline has been dominated by scientific theory which is concerned with what ''is,'' while [[Normative|normative theories]] are centrally concerned with ''what ought to be.''{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=249}} This neglect of normative theories \"limits the practical usefulness of communication studies.\"{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=249}}\n\nGrounded practical theory (GPT) is a [[Metatheory|metatheoretical]] approach based on Craig's (1989) notion of communication as a practical, rather than [[Empirical|scientific]], discipline.{{sfn|Craig|1989}}{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=250-253}} The goal of communication as a practical discipline is to develop [[Normative|normative theories]] to guide practice.{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=250, 264-265}} Based on this argument, GPT was developed as a methodologically grounded means of theorizing communication practices.{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=250,253, 264}} GPT involves (1) reconstructing communicative practices, (2) redescribing those practices in less context-specific terms, and (3) identifying implicit principles which guide the practice. Generally a GPT study begins by looking for troubles or dilemmas endemic to situated interaction and observable in discourse. This constitutes the \u201cproblem level\u201d{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=253}} and the \u201cgrounded\u201d component of the GPT approach.{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=266}} Then, problems are reconstructed concretely and abstractly and matched with the techniques which participants employ for dealing with those problems. This constitutes the \u201ctechnical level\u201d{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=253}} and is an important part of the theorizing process. Finally, the ideals and standards shaping the practice and how to manage its problems and techniques constitute the \u201cphilosophical level.\u201d{{sfn|Craig|Tracy|1995|p=253}} This situates the practice both locally and generally for the purpose of normative critique. A methodological approach which is explicitly guided by GPT is action implicative discourse analysis (AIDA).{{sfn|Tracy|2004}}{{sfn|Tracy|2007}}{{sfn|Tracy|Craig|2010}}\n\n==''Communication Theory as a Field''==\n{{main|Communication Theory as a Field}}\nIn 1999 Craig wrote a landmark article{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008|pp=6}} \"Communication Theory as a Field\"{{sfn|Craig|1999}} which expanded the conversation regarding disciplinary identity in the field of communication.{{sfn|Donsback|2006}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008|pp=6}}{{sfn|Penman|2000}}{{sfn|Anderson|Baym|2004}}{{sfn|Lindlof|Taylor|2002}}{{sfn|D'Angelo|2002}}{{sfn|Jimenez|Guillem|2009}} At that time, communication theory textbooks had little to no agreement on how to present the field or what theories to include in their textbooks.{{sfn|Anderson|1996|pp=200-201}}{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=120}}  This article has since become the foundational framework for four different textbooks to introduce the field of communication.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=125}}{{sfn|Craig|Muller|2007}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}}{{sfn|Griffin|2006}}{{sfn|Miller|2005}} In this article Craig \"proposes a vision for communication theory that takes a huge step toward unifying this rather disparate field and addressing its complexities.\"{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}} To move toward this unifying vision Craig focused on [[communication theory]] as a practical discipline and shows how \"various traditions of communication theory can be engaged in dialogue on the practice of communication.\"{{sfn|Craig|2006|pp=13}}{{sfn|Penman|2000|pp=6, 76}}  In this deliberative process theorists would engage in dialog about the \"practical implications of communication theories.\"{{sfn|Craig|2001}} In the end Craig proposes seven different traditions of Communication Theory and outlines how each one of them would engage the others in dialogue.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132-146}}\n\nCraig proposes that these seven suggested traditions of communication theory have emerged through research into communication, and each one has their own way of understanding communication.{{sfn|Anderson|Baym|2004|pp=440}}{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132-134}}  These seven traditions are:\n#[[Rhetoric]]al: views communication as the practical art of discourse.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=135-136}}\n#[[Semiotic]]: views communication as the mediation by signs.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=136-138}}\n#[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenological]]: communication is the experience of dialogue with others.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=138-140}}\n#[[cybernetics|Cybernetic]]: communication is the flow of information.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=141-142}}\n#[[Social psychology (sociology)|Socio-psychological]]: communication is the interaction of individuals.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=142-144}}\n#[[sociocultural|Socio-cultural]]: communication is the production and reproduction of the social order.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=144-146}}\n#[[Critical theory|Critical]]: communication is the process in which all assumptions can be challenged.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=146-149}}\n\nThese proposed seven traditions of communication theory are then placed into conversation with each other on a [https://web.archive.org/web/20110805152813/http://www.colorado.edu/communication/meta-discourses/Bibliography/Craig%20(1999)/tables.html a table]{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=133-134}} first to show how each tradition's different interpretation of communication defines the tradition's vocabulary, communication problems, and commonplaces,{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132,133}} and next to show what argumentation between the traditions would look like.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132,134}}\n\nCraig concluded this article with an open invitation to explore how the differences in these theories might shed light on key issues, show where new traditions could be created, and engaging communication theory with communication problems through metadiscourse. {{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=149}} Craig further proposes several future traditions that could possibly be fit into the metamodel.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=149,151}} A feminist tradition where communication is theorized as \"connectedness to others\", an aesthetic tradition theorizing communication as \"embodied performance\", an economic tradition theorizing communication as \"exchange\", and a spiritual tradition theorizing communication on a \"nonmaterial or mystical plane of existence.\" {{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=151}}\n\n==Publications==\n\n===Books and chapters===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!

Stern School of Business''' (commonly referred to as '''NYU Stern''' or '''Stern''') is the [[business schools|business school]] of [[New York University]]. Founded in 1900, Stern is one of the most prestigious and oldest business schools in the world. It is located at [[Gould Plaza]] next to the [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|Courant Institute of Mathematics]] and the [[economics]] department of the [[New York University College of Arts & Science|College of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://meet.nyu.edu/locations/gould-plaza/|title=Gould Plaza|website=MEET NYU|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>\n\nStern is a founding member of the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]]. Established as the '''School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance''' in 1900, the school changed its name in 1988 in honor of [[Leonard N. Stern]], an alumnus and benefactor of the school. [[U.S. News & World Report|''US News and World Report'']] ranks Stern as having the 5th best undergraduate business school in the nation, and having the 10th best graduate program. The school offers [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's degrees]] in business at the [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] level and [[Master of Business Administration]] degrees at the [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/tosv2.html?vid=&uuid=239bc430-8102-11ea-9fa6-bb58078fd9c0&url=L2J1c2luZXNzLXNjaG9vbHMvbnl1LXN0ZXJuLw==|title=Bloomberg - Are you a robot?|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>  \n\nIts alumni include some of the wealthiest in the world, as well as top business leaders and executives, including [[Henry Kaufman]], [[Robert Greifeld]], and [[Kenneth Langone]].

In 1913, Jeanette Hamill, J.D., M.A., joined the school's Economics department, becoming its first female faculty member. In 1936, women comprised 15 percent of the total enrollment.\n\n===Graduate School of Business Administration===\nThe '''Graduate School of Business Administration''' was launched in 1916, and was housed in the NYU's School of Commerce's Wall Street branch.<ref>\"In 1916, the School of Commerce's Wall Street branch became the home of New York University's Graduate School of Business Administration (GBA).\" {{cite book |title=Contemporary Challenges: American Business in a Global Economy\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=081471868X  |isbn=081471868X\n|author=Daniel E Diamond |date=1995}}</ref> Located in New York's downtown business district, the school's \"Wall Street Division\" served both full-time and currently employed students.

In the 1960s, international business courses were introduced and soon became an important focus of the school's curriculum. The New York University, Graduate School of Business Administration, C.J. Devine Institute of Finance (1959\u20131966) published many key Finance and Investment bulletins related to International finance. The school awarded its first Doctor of Commercial Sciences degree in 1970.\n<!--a series of publications followed... HIST/DIF can identify these -->\n\n===Commerce/College of Business and Public Administration===\nThe School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance was renamed the College of Business and Public Administration in 1972. In the same year, Tisch Hall, designed by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Richard Foster (architect)|Richard Foster]] (see also: [[Bobst Library]] and Meyer Building) opened at 40 West Fourth Street to house the undergraduate college.\n\n===Stern's donation===\nIn 1988, a $30 million gift from the school's alumnus Leonard N. Stern (B.S., 1957; M.B.A., 1959) allowed the school to consolidate its graduate and undergraduate facilities at NYU's Washington Square campus. The school was renamed Leonard N. Stern School of Business. In 1992, Stern's new $68 million state-of-the-art facility, now known as Kaufman Management Center, was inaugurated.\n\nIn 1998, a $10 million gift from [[Henry Kaufman]] (PhD 1958) supported a major expansion and upgrading of Stern's facilities. The new and renovated space is used almost exclusively to improve the quality of student life. Prominent investment banker and Home Depot investor [[Kenneth Langone]] (MBA 1960) donated $10 million to Stern in 1999. The Langone MBA for Working Professionals was renamed in his honor. Celebrating its 100th birthday in the year 2000, Stern launched a $100 million centennial campaign, the school's most ambitious fundraising effort to date.

In 1992, Stern's new $68 million state-of-the-art facility, now known as Kaufman Management Center, was inaugurated.\n\nIn 1998, a $10 million gift from [[Henry Kaufman]] (PhD 1958) supported a major expansion and upgrading of Stern's facilities. The new and renovated space is used almost exclusively to improve the quality of student life. Prominent investment banker and Home Depot investor [[Kenneth Langone]] (MBA 1960) donated $10 million to Stern in 1999. The Langone MBA for Working Professionals was renamed in his honor. Celebrating its 100th birthday in the year 2000, Stern launched a $100 million centennial campaign, the school's most ambitious fundraising effort to date. The campaign doubled the school's endowment, the number of named professorships, and the level of student financial aid.\n\n[[Peter Blair Henry]] became dean of the school in January 2010.<ref name=ft20100221>{{cite news|last=Murray|first=Sarah|title=The bigger picture|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/703f0e20-1d74-11df-a893-00144feab49a.html#axzz2E8r07iXd|accessdate=December 4, 2012|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=February 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the {{convert|84500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} renovation of the three Stern School of Business buildings, known as the Stern Concourse Project, was completed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Light, transparency and brand connect Stern students, faculty and New York City|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&upload_id=13465|publisher=World Architecture News.com|accessdate=December 24, 2012|date=February 24, 2010}}</ref>  This project was fully funded by donors, alumni and corporate partners.<ref>{{cite web|title=Concourse Project|url=http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/concourse/index.html|publisher=New York University|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nNYU Stern Westchester offers its Langone MBA for Working Professionals in [[Purchase, New York]], at [[State University of New York at Purchase|SUNY Purchase]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.nyu.edu/programs-admissions/part-time-mba-westchester/index.htm |title=NYU Stern &#124; Part-time MBA Westchester &#124; Home |publisher=Stern.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n{{Infobox business school rankings\n| QSglobal = 19\n| BI = 16\n| Economist = 19\n| FT = 19\n| BWg = 17\n| Forbes = 18\n| USNWRg = 10\n| Vault = 9\n| USNWRu = 5\n}}\n\nAs of 2009, 2,305 students are enrolled in Stern's undergraduate program and 2,969 are enrolled in its [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program.

The coordinated newsreel production was set up as a vital instrument for the mass distribution of [[Nazi propaganda]] at war. Today the preserved ''Wochenschau'' short films make up a significant part of the audiovisual records of the Nazi era.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Berlin, Mitte, Krausenstrasse, Krausenhof 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Former UFA head office, Berlin-[[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]]]]\nNewsreels had been regularly released since the early days of [[Cinema of Germany|German cinema]], especially during [[World War I]], when companies like [[Messter Film]] started producing short [[silent film]] documentaries. With the final changeover to [[sound film]]s in the early 1930s, the newsreel market concentrated on four dominating production companies: [[Universum Film AG]] (''Ufa-Tonwoche'' and ''[[Deulig|Deulig-Tonwoche]]''), [[20th Century Fox]] (''Fox T\u00f6nende Wochenschau''), [[Bavaria Film]] (''Emelka-Tonwoche''), and [[Tobis Film|Tobis]] (''Tobis-Wochenschau''). After the Nazi ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' in 1933, the production was supervised and [[Censorship in Germany|censored]] by the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] under [[Joseph Goebbels]], who had realized the enormous significance of newsreels for his propaganda purposes.\n\nUpon the German [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, marking the outbreak of the Second World War, the Nazi authorities consolidated the four separate newsreel production efforts into one, led by the Universum Film AG in [[Berlin]]. These newsreels were merged into a single wartime newsreel, but kept their respective opening titles until June 1940. After that, the merger was made public by use of a single new opening title: ''Die Deutsche Wochenschau''.<ref>Bucher, Peter, \"Goebbels und die Deutsche Wochenschau. Nationalsozialistische Filmpropaganda im Zweiten Weltkrieg 1939\u20131945\", ''Milit\u00e4rgeschichtliche Mitteilungen'', 15, 1986, 2, pp. 53\u201369.</ref> This was the sole series of German newsreels until production discontinued in March 1945, when most cinemas in Germany were closed and transport links had collapsed.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2007-1026-500, Deutsche Wochenschau, Mischraum.jpg|thumb|upright|Mixing room, 1941]]\n''Die Deutsche Wochenschau'' received film stock from special ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' war reporting units (''Propagandakompanien'') and notable cinematographers like [[Hans Ertl (cameraman)|Hans Ertl]] and [[Walter Frentz]]. The material was a source of footage for late Nazi [[propaganda film]]s such as ''[[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|The Eternal Jew]]'' and ''[[Feldzug in Polen|The Campaign in Poland]]'', as well as innumerable post-war documentaries. The former ''Tobis-Wochenschau'' speaker and voice-over artist [[Harry Giese]] was assigned as \"the voice\" of the combined German newsreel production. Despite his signature rat-a-tat narration that gives the proceedings a documentary-like tone, liberties were taken in retelling the facts in this Nazi propaganda tool.<ref>Vande Winkel, Roel, \"The Auxiliary Cruiser Thor's Death and Transfiguration: a case study in Nazi wartime newsreel propaganda\", ''Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television'', 23, 2003, 3, pp. 211\u2013229.</ref>  Comedic public service announcements were delivered by the ''[[Tran and Helle]]'' duo.<ref>Singer, Hans-J\u00fcrgen, \"Tran und Helle. Aspekte unterhaltender Aufkl\u00e4rung im Dritten Reich\", ''Publizistik'', 31, 1986, :3\u20134, pp. 347\u2013356.</ref>\n\nNewsreels typically preceded the main feature film, announced by an opening sequence derived from the ''[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]''; after the beginning of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian Campaign]] in 1941 it was accompanied by the fanfare motif from Liszt's ''[[Les Pr\u00e9ludes]]''. After the 1943 [[Battle of Stalingrad]], Minister Goebbels ordered an increase of efforts to manipulate the war reporting in order to keep up the perseverance of the German people. However, these plans ultimately foundered on countless eyewitness reports by ''Wehrmacht'' soldiers via [[military mail]] or while on furlough, the widespread listening to ''[[Feindsender]]'' radio stations, and also the effects of Allied [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing]] on German cities.\n\n''Die Deutsche Wochenschau'' was also exported to occupied territories that had been annexed to the Reich, like Austria and the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg. For other occupied regions, or for neutral nations (like Sweden), another newsreel was made: Ufa's ''[[Auslandstonwoche]]'' or 'Foreign Weekly Newsreel'.<ref>Vande Winkel, Roel, \"Nazi newsreels in Europe, 1939\u20131945: the many faces of Ufa's foreign weekly newsreel (Auslandstonwoche) versus the German weekly newsreel (Deutsche Wochenschau)\", ''Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television'', 24, 2004, 1, pp. 5\u201334</ref>\n\nAmong the many notable scenes preserved by the newsreel are the Nazi point of view during the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]], the footage of Hitler and Mussolini right after the [[20 July plot]], and the last footage (No. 755) of Hitler awarding the [[Iron Cross]] to [[Hitler Youth]] volunteers in the garden of the [[Reich Chancellery]] shortly before the [[Battle of Berlin]].

The coordinated newsreel production was set up as a vital instrument for the mass distribution of [[Nazi propaganda]] at war. Today the preserved ''Wochenschau'' short films make up a significant part of the audiovisual records of the Nazi era.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Berlin, Mitte, Krausenstrasse, Krausenhof 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Former UFA head office, Berlin-[[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]]]]\nNewsreels had been regularly released since the early days of [[Cinema of Germany|German cinema]], especially during [[World War I]], when companies like [[Messter Film]] started producing short [[silent film]] documentaries. With the final changeover to [[sound film]]s in the early 1930s, the newsreel market concentrated on four dominating production companies: [[Universum Film AG]] (''Ufa-Tonwoche'' and ''[[Deulig|Deulig-Tonwoche]]''), [[20th Century Fox]] (''Fox T\u00f6nende Wochenschau''), [[Bavaria Film]] (''Emelka-Tonwoche''), and [[Tobis Film|Tobis]] (''Tobis-Wochenschau''). After the Nazi ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' in 1933, the production was supervised and [[Censorship in Germany|censored]] by the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] under [[Joseph Goebbels]], who had realized the enormous significance of newsreels for his propaganda purposes.\n\nUpon the German [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, marking the outbreak of the Second World War, the Nazi authorities consolidated the four separate newsreel production efforts into one, led by the Universum Film AG in [[Berlin]]. These newsreels were merged into a single wartime newsreel, but kept their respective opening titles until June 1940. After that, the merger was made public by use of a single new opening title: ''Die Deutsche Wochenschau''.<ref>Bucher, Peter, \"Goebbels und die Deutsche Wochenschau. Nationalsozialistische Filmpropaganda im Zweiten Weltkrieg 1939\u20131945\", ''Milit\u00e4rgeschichtliche Mitteilungen'', 15, 1986, 2, pp. 53\u201369.</ref> This was the sole series of German newsreels until production discontinued in March 1945, when most cinemas in Germany were closed and transport links had collapsed.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2007-1026-500, Deutsche Wochenschau, Mischraum.jpg|thumb|upright|Mixing room, 1941]]\n''Die Deutsche Wochenschau'' received film stock from special ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' war reporting units (''Propagandakompanien'') and notable cinematographers like [[Hans Ertl (cameraman)|Hans Ertl]] and [[Walter Frentz]]. The material was a source of footage for late Nazi [[propaganda film]]s such as ''[[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|The Eternal Jew]]'' and ''[[Feldzug in Polen|The Campaign in Poland]]'', as well as innumerable post-war documentaries. The former ''Tobis-Wochenschau'' speaker and voice-over artist [[Harry Giese]] was assigned as \"the voice\" of the combined German newsreel production. Despite his signature rat-a-tat narration that gives the proceedings a documentary-like tone, liberties were taken in retelling the facts in this Nazi propaganda tool.<ref>Vande Winkel, Roel, \"The Auxiliary Cruiser Thor's Death and Transfiguration: a case study in Nazi wartime newsreel propaganda\", ''Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television'', 23, 2003, 3, pp. 211\u2013229.</ref>  Comedic public service announcements were delivered by the ''[[Tran and Helle]]'' duo.<ref>Singer, Hans-J\u00fcrgen, \"Tran und Helle. Aspekte unterhaltender Aufkl\u00e4rung im Dritten Reich\", ''Publizistik'', 31, 1986, :3\u20134, pp. 347\u2013356.</ref>\n\nNewsreels typically preceded the main feature film, announced by an opening sequence derived from the ''[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]''; after the beginning of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian Campaign]] in 1941 it was accompanied by the fanfare motif from Liszt's ''[[Les Pr\u00e9ludes]]''. After the 1943 [[Battle of Stalingrad]], Minister Goebbels ordered an increase of efforts to manipulate the war reporting in order to keep up the perseverance of the German people. However, these plans ultimately foundered on countless eyewitness reports by ''Wehrmacht'' soldiers via [[military mail]] or while on furlough, the widespread listening to ''[[Feindsender]]'' radio stations, and also the effects of Allied [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing]] on German cities.\n\n''Die Deutsche Wochenschau'' was also exported to occupied territories that had been annexed to the Reich, like Austria and the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg. For other occupied regions, or for neutral nations (like Sweden), another newsreel was made: Ufa's ''[[Auslandstonwoche]]'' or 'Foreign Weekly Newsreel'.<ref>Vande Winkel, Roel, \"Nazi newsreels in Europe, 1939\u20131945: the many faces of Ufa's foreign weekly newsreel (Auslandstonwoche) versus the German weekly newsreel (Deutsche Wochenschau)\", ''Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television'', 24, 2004, 1, pp. 5\u201334</ref>\n\nAmong the many notable scenes preserved by the newsreel are the Nazi point of view during the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]], the footage of Hitler and Mussolini right after the [[20 July plot]], and the last footage (No. 755) of Hitler awarding the [[Iron Cross]] to [[Hitler Youth]] volunteers in the garden of the [[Reich Chancellery]] shortly before the [[Battle of Berlin]].

The term \"visual technology\" refers any media designed for purposes of perception or with the potential to augment our visual capability.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mirzoeff|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Mirzoeff|title=What is Visual Culture?|url=https://archive.org/details/visualculturerea0000unse|work=The Visual Culture Reader (2nd ed.)|isbn=978-0-415-14134-5|accessdate=2 November 2011|year=1998|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the changing technological aspects of visual culture as well as a scientific method-derived desire to create taxonomies or articulate what the \"visual\" is, many aspects of Visual Culture overlap with the study of science and technology, including hybrid electronic media, cognitive science, neurology, and image and brain theory.  In an interview with the ''[[Journal of Visual Culture]]'', academic [[Martin Jay]] explicates the rise of this tie between the visual and the technological: \"Insofar as we live in a culture whose technological advances abet the production and dissemination of such images at a hitherto unimagined level, it is necessary to focus on how they work and what they do, rather than move past them too quickly to the ideas they represent or the reality they purport to depict.

As \"the turn from art history to visual culture studies parallels a turn from theater studies to performance studies\", it is clear that the perspectival shift that both emerging fields embody is comparable.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Shannon|title=Performing Show and Tell: Disciplines of Visual Culture and Performance Studies|url=http://vcu.sagepub.com/content/4/2/163.abstract|accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Image studies===\n\nWhile the image remains a focal point in visual culture studies, it is the relations between images and consumers that are evaluated for their cultural significance, not just the image in and of itself.<ref>[[Anna Schober|Schober, Anna]] (2003).

J. T. Mitchell]] explicitly distinguishes the two fields in his claim that visual culture studies \"helps us to see that even something as broad as the image does not exhaust the field of visuality; that visual studies is not the same thing as image studies, and that the study of the visual image is just one component of the larger field.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Visual Culture/Visual Studies: Inventory of Recent Definitions|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/visualarts/VisualCulture/VisualCultureStudies-definitions.html|accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===''Bildwissenschaft''===\nThough the development of ''[[Bildwissenschaft]]'' (\"image-science\") in the [[German-speaking world]] to an extent paralleled that of the field of visual culture in the United Kingdom and United States,<ref>{{cite book|first=Matthew|last=Rampley|chapter=Bildwissenschaft: Theories of the Image in German-Language Scholarship|title=Art History and Visual Studies in Europe: Transnational Discourses and National Frameworks|editor1-first=Matthew|editor1-last=Rampley|editor2-first=Thierry|editor2-last=Lenain|editor3-first=Hubert|editor3-last=Locher|editor4-first=Andrea|editor4-last=Pinotti|editor5-first=Charlotte|editor5-last=Schoell-Glass|editor6-first=Kitty|editor6-last=Zijlmans|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=2012|page=121}}</ref> ''Bildwissenschaft'' occupies a more central role in the [[liberal arts]] and [[humanities]] than that afforded to visual culture.<ref>{{cite journal|first=David|last=Craven|title=The New German Art History: From Ideological Critique and the Warburg Renaissance to the ''Bildwissenschaft'' of the Three Bs|journal=Art in Translation|volume=6|issue=2|year=2014|doi=10.2752/175613114X13998876655059|page=140}}</ref> Significant differences between ''Bildwissenschaft'' and Anglophone cultural and visual studies include the former's examination of images dating from the [[early modern period]], and its emphasis on continuities over breaks with the past.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Jason|last=Gaiger|title=The Idea of a Universal ''Bildwissenschaft''|journal=Estetika: The Central European Journal of Aesthetic|volume=LI|issue=2|year=2014|page=212|url=http://aesthetics.ff.cuni.cz/file_download/49|ref=harv}}</ref> Whereas Anglo-American visual studies can be seen as a continuation of [[critical theory]] in its attempt to reveal power relations, ''Bildwissenschaft'' is not explicitly political.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=213}}\n\n== History ==\nEarly work on visual culture has been done by [[John Berger]] (''[[Ways of Seeing]]'', 1972) and [[Laura Mulvey]] (''[[Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema]]'', 1975) that follows on from [[Jacques Lacan]]'s theorization of the unconscious [[gaze]]. Twentieth-century pioneers such as [[Gy\u00f6rgy Kepes]] and [[William Ivins, Jr.]] as well as iconic phenomenologists like [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] also played important roles in creating a foundation for the discipline. For the history of art, [[Svetlana Alpers]] published a pioneering study on ''The Art of Describing: Dutch Art in the Seventeenth Century'' (Chicago 1983) in which she took up an earlier implus of [[Michael Baxandall]] to study the visual culture of a whole region of early-modern Europe in all its facets: landscape painting and perception, optics and perspectival studies, geography and topographic measurements, united in a common ''mapping impulse''.\n\nMajor works on visual culture include those by [[W.

The term \"visual technology\" refers any media designed for purposes of perception or with the potential to augment our visual capability.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mirzoeff|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Mirzoeff|title=What is Visual Culture?|url=https://archive.org/details/visualculturerea0000unse|work=The Visual Culture Reader (2nd ed.)|isbn=978-0-415-14134-5|accessdate=2 November 2011|year=1998|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the changing technological aspects of visual culture as well as a scientific method-derived desire to create taxonomies or articulate what the \"visual\" is, many aspects of Visual Culture overlap with the study of science and technology, including hybrid electronic media, cognitive science, neurology, and image and brain theory.  In an interview with the ''[[Journal of Visual Culture]]'', academic [[Martin Jay]] explicates the rise of this tie between the visual and the technological: \"Insofar as we live in a culture whose technological advances abet the production and dissemination of such images at a hitherto unimagined level, it is necessary to focus on how they work and what they do, rather than move past them too quickly to the ideas they represent or the reality they purport to depict. In so doing, we necessarily have to ask questions about ... technological mediations and extensions of visual experience.\"<ref name=\"That Visual Turn\">{{cite web|title=That Visual Turn|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Jay-VisualTurn-JVC-2002.pdf|work=[[Journal of Visual Culture]]|accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n\"Visual Culture\" goes by a variety of names at different institutions, including Visual and Critical Studies, Visual and Cultural Studies, and Visual Studies.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Visualism==\nThe term \"Visualism\" was developed by the German anthropologist [[Johannes Fabian]] to criticise the dominating role of vision in scientific discourse, through such terms as [[observation]]. He points to an under theorised approach to the use of visual representation which leads to a corpuscular theory of knowledge and information which leads to their atomisation.<ref name=Rarey>{{cite book |last=Rarey |first=Matthew |editor1-first=James |editor1-last=Elkins |editor2-first=Kristi |editor2-last=McGuire |editor3-first=Maureen |editor3-last=Burns |editor4-first=Alicia |editor4-last=Chester |editor5-first=Joel  |editor5-last=Kuennen |title=Theorizing Visual Studies: Writing Through the Discipline |publisher=Routledge |date=2012 |pages= 278\u2013281|chapter=Visualism |isbn=9781136159169}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship with other areas of study==\n===Art history===\nAs visual culture studies, in the Unites States, have begun to address areas previously studied by [[art history]], there have been disputes between the two fields.<ref name=\"Pinotti2016p67\">Pinotti, Somaini (2016) ''Cultura visuale'', pp.67-8</ref> One of the reason for controversy was that the various approaches in art history, like [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], [[iconology]], [[social history of art]], or [[New Art History]], focused only on artistic images, assuming a distinction with non-artistic ones, while in visual culture studies there is typically no such distinction.<ref name=\"Pinotti2016p67\"/>\n\n===Performance studies===\nVisual culture studies may also overlap with another emerging field, that of [[performance studies]].  As \"the turn from art history to visual culture studies parallels a turn from theater studies to performance studies\", it is clear that the perspectival shift that both emerging fields embody is comparable.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Shannon|title=Performing Show and Tell: Disciplines of Visual Culture and Performance Studies|url=http://vcu.sagepub.com/content/4/2/163.abstract|accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Image studies===\n\nWhile the image remains a focal point in visual culture studies, it is the relations between images and consumers that are evaluated for their cultural significance, not just the image in and of itself.<ref>[[Anna Schober|Schober, Anna]] (2003). Blue Jeans.

J. T. Mitchell]] explicitly distinguishes the two fields in his claim that visual culture studies \"helps us to see that even something as broad as the image does not exhaust the field of visuality; that visual studies is not the same thing as image studies, and that the study of the visual image is just one component of the larger field.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Visual Culture/Visual Studies: Inventory of Recent Definitions|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/visualarts/VisualCulture/VisualCultureStudies-definitions.html|accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===''Bildwissenschaft''===\nThough the development of ''[[Bildwissenschaft]]'' (\"image-science\") in the [[German-speaking world]] to an extent paralleled that of the field of visual culture in the United Kingdom and United States,<ref>{{cite book|first=Matthew|last=Rampley|chapter=Bildwissenschaft: Theories of the Image in German-Language Scholarship|title=Art History and Visual Studies in Europe: Transnational Discourses and National Frameworks|editor1-first=Matthew|editor1-last=Rampley|editor2-first=Thierry|editor2-last=Lenain|editor3-first=Hubert|editor3-last=Locher|editor4-first=Andrea|editor4-last=Pinotti|editor5-first=Charlotte|editor5-last=Schoell-Glass|editor6-first=Kitty|editor6-last=Zijlmans|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=2012|page=121}}</ref> ''Bildwissenschaft'' occupies a more central role in the [[liberal arts]] and [[humanities]] than that afforded to visual culture.<ref>{{cite journal|first=David|last=Craven|title=The New German Art History: From Ideological Critique and the Warburg Renaissance to the ''Bildwissenschaft'' of the Three Bs|journal=Art in Translation|volume=6|issue=2|year=2014|doi=10.2752/175613114X13998876655059|page=140}}</ref> Significant differences between ''Bildwissenschaft'' and Anglophone cultural and visual studies include the former's examination of images dating from the [[early modern period]], and its emphasis on continuities over breaks with the past.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Jason|last=Gaiger|title=The Idea of a Universal ''Bildwissenschaft''|journal=Estetika: The Central European Journal of Aesthetic|volume=LI|issue=2|year=2014|page=212|url=http://aesthetics.ff.cuni.cz/file_download/49|ref=harv}}</ref> Whereas Anglo-American visual studies can be seen as a continuation of [[critical theory]] in its attempt to reveal power relations, ''Bildwissenschaft'' is not explicitly political.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=213}}\n\n== History ==\nEarly work on visual culture has been done by [[John Berger]] (''[[Ways of Seeing]]'', 1972) and [[Laura Mulvey]] (''[[Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema]]'', 1975) that follows on from [[Jacques Lacan]]'s theorization of the unconscious [[gaze]]. Twentieth-century pioneers such as [[Gy\u00f6rgy Kepes]] and [[William Ivins, Jr.]] as well as iconic phenomenologists like [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] also played important roles in creating a foundation for the discipline. For the history of art, [[Svetlana Alpers]] published a pioneering study on ''The Art of Describing: Dutch Art in the Seventeenth Century'' (Chicago 1983) in which she took up an earlier implus of [[Michael Baxandall]] to study the visual culture of a whole region of early-modern Europe in all its facets: landscape painting and perception, optics and perspectival studies, geography and topographic measurements, united in a common ''mapping impulse''.\n\nMajor works on visual culture include those by [[W. J. T. Mitchell]], [[Griselda Pollock]], [http://www.ves.fas.harvard.edu/bruno.html Giuliana Bruno], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], [[Paul Crowther (philosopher)|Paul Crowther]] and [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]].
