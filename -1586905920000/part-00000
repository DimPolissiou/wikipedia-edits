Bush]] as [[President of the United States|president]] and the [[2004 United States House of Representatives elections|United States House election]], as well as many state and local elections. Senators who were elected in [[1998 United States Senate elections|1998]], known as [[Classes of United States Senators|Senate Class 3]], were seeking re-election or retiring in 2004. This was the third consecutive election for Senate Class 3 where the Democrats either broke even or lost seats.  This also marked the first time since 1980 in which a presidential candidate from either party won with coattails in the Senate. As of 2018, these are the last elections held during a Presidential election year in which the Republicans made a net gain of seats.\n\n==Gains and losses==\nRepublicans won six seats but lost two themselves, giving them a net gain of four seats. Five of the six gains came from Southern states. Conservative Democrat [[Zell Miller]] of [[List of United States Senators from Georgia|Georgia]], who campaigned for President [[George W. Bush|Bush]], chose not to run for re-election and Republican [[Johnny Isakson]] won his seat; Democrat [[Fritz Hollings]] of [[List of United States Senators from South Carolina|South Carolina]] chose not to run for re-election and was succeeded by Republican [[Jim DeMint]]; Democratic vice presidential nominee [[John Edwards]] did not run for re-election and Republican [[Richard Burr]] won his [[List of United States Senators from North Carolina|North Carolina]] seat; Democrat [[Bob Graham]] of [[List of United States Senators from Florida|Florida]] chose not to run for re-election, and his seat went to Republican [[Mel Martinez]]; [[List of United States Senators from Louisiana|Louisiana]] Democrat [[John Breaux]] chose not to run for re-election and Republican [[David Vitter]] won his seat, and in [[List of United States Senators from South Dakota|South Dakota]], Republican [[John Thune]] defeated the incumbent Senate minority leader [[Tom Daschle]], the first time since [[United States Senate elections, 1952|1952]] that a sitting party leader lost re-election. Republican Senator [[Peter Fitzgerald (senator)|Peter Fitzgerald]] of [[List of United States Senators from Illinois|Illinois]] chose not to run for re-election and Democrat [[Barack Obama]] won in a landslide, becoming the Senate's only black member and only the third popularly elected since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Also, Republican Senator [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]] of [[List of United States Senators from Colorado|Colorado]] chose not to run for re-election and Democrat [[Ken Salazar]] won the open seat.\n\n==Results summary==\n\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ \u2193\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:44%;\" | '''44'''\n| style=\"background:{{Independent (United States)/meta/color}}; color:black; width:1%;\" | '''1'''\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:55%;\" | '''55'''\n|}\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:44%;\"| <span style=\"color:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}}\">'''Democratic'''</span>\n| '''Independent'''\n| style=\"width:55%;\"| <span style=\"color:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}\">'''Republican'''</span>\n|}\n\n{{United States Senate elections results, 2004}}\n\n== Change in composition ==\n\n=== Before the elections ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:800px\"\n\n|-\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|1}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|2}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|3}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|4}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|5}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|6}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|7}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|8}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|9}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|10}}\n\n|-\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|20}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|19}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|18}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|17}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|16}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|15}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|14}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|13}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|12}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|11}}\n\n|-\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|21}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|22}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|23}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|24}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|25}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|26}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|27}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|28}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|29}}\n!

(The independent, [[Jim Jeffords]] of [[Vermont]], was allied with the Democratic caucus and had voted with Democrats to give them the majority in the past.) The Democrats, therefore, needed to make a net gain of at least two seats from retiring or incumbent Republicans to gain control of the Senate (one seat if Kerry won the presidency). In the election, incumbent senators won reelection in all races but one ([[Senate Minority Leader|Democratic leader]] [[Tom Daschle]], in [[South Dakota]], lost to Republican [[John Thune]]). The seats of retiring senators were taken by the opposing party in [[Colorado]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Illinois]], [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and [[South Carolina]]. In fact, the only retiring senator whose seat was taken by a member of his party was Republican [[Don Nickles]] of [[Oklahoma]], who was succeeded by [[Tom Coburn]].\n\nRepublicans gained four seats in the 2004 elections, and entered the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]] with a 55\u201344\u20131 lead. While such a majority is formidable, it is still less than the 60 seats needed to override a [[filibuster (legislative tactic)|filibuster]] and completely control the body's agenda and procedures.\n\n===Major parties===\n\nOne Republican seat, that of retiring Senator Peter Fitzgerald in Illinois, was easily taken by Democrat [[Barack Obama]], who would be elected [[President of the United States]] four years later. In Colorado, retiring Senator [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]]'s seat was narrowly taken by Democrat [[Ken Salazar]]. In Alaska, Republican [[Lisa Murkowski]] won reelection in a tight race. In Oklahoma, [[Tom Coburn]] kept [[Don Nickles]]' seat in Republican hands, while in Kentucky, Republican [[Jim Bunning]] won a second term by a very narrow margin.\n\nThe Democrats' prospects were weakened by the fact that five of their six incumbent senators in Southern states were retiring (the sixth, [[Blanche Lincoln]] of [[Arkansas]], easily won reelection). Retiring Georgia Sen. [[Zell Miller]]'s seat, contested by [[Denise Majette]], was lost in a landslide, as was that of South Carolina Sen. [[Ernest Hollings]]. In North Carolina, Democrat [[Erskine Bowles]] lost [[John Edwards]]'s seat to Republican [[Richard Burr]]. Especially close races in Florida, Louisiana, and South Dakota all resulted in turnovers to the Republicans.\n\n===Third and minor parties===\nThe [[United States Libertarian Party|Libertarian]], [[United States Constitution Party|Constitution]], and [[United States Green Party|Green]] parties contested many of the seats. No candidate from any of these parties received sufficient support to achieve election, but some may have affected the outcome of the Alaska and Florida races by drawing votes away from the major party candidates. Of the 34 senate seats up for grabs, the Libertarians ran candidates in 20 of the races, the Constitutionalists ran 10 candidates, and the Greens ran 7 candidates.\n\n[[List of political parties in the United States|Minor parties]] in a number of states contested one or more Senate seats. Examples include the America First Party, the [[Labor Party (United States, 1996)|Labor Party]], the [[Peace and Freedom Party (United States)|Peace and Freedom Party]], and the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]]. None of these parties gained a seat in this election nor received a significant number of votes.\n\n== Race summary ==\n=== Special elections during the 108th Congress ===\nThere were no special elections during the 108th Congress.\n\n=== Elections leading to the next Congress ===\nIn these general elections, the winners were elected for the term beginning January 3, 2005; ordered by state.\n\nAll of the elections involved the Class 3 seats.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n\n|- valign=bottom\n! rowspan=2 | State<br/>{{small|(linked to<br/>summaries below)}}\n! colspan=3 | Incumbent\n! rowspan=2 | Results\n! rowspan=2 | Candidates\n\n|-\n!

In the spring, the campaign hired fundraising staff from the defunct presidential campaigns of [[Howard Dean]] and [[Bob Graham]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, and subsequently posted much higher fundraising numbers over the summer{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. Online grassroots techniques devised for the Dean campaign (Castor became a [[Dean Dozen]] candidate in August{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}) were one contributing factor{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}: another was the support of [[EMILY's List]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, which named Castor as its highest-rated candidate for the 2004 election cycle{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, even when her support for banning intact dilation and extraction (D&X) abortions was not in line with the EMILY's List support for woman's issues{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.

The complaint was dismissed by the Federal Election Commission in 2005{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.\n\nCastor's handling of [[Sami Al-Arian]] became another source of criticism during the campaign{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. In June, [[American Democracy Project (527 group in Florida)|The American Democracy Project]], a [[527 group]] founded by [[Bernie Friedman]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, began attacking Castor's handling of the incident, alleging that she had sufficient evidence to fire Al-Arian in the mid-1990s{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. Castor responded by stating that she never had sufficient evidence to fire Al-Arian, who was a [[tenure|tenured professor]] at the time{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. On June 29, Senator Graham, who had previously remained outside of the Al-Arian controversy, released a statement that \"Betty Castor acted appropriately as President of the University of South Florida to deal with Sami Al-Arian\"{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}: later, Graham and Senator [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]] brokered an agreement between the Democratic candidates to refrain from negative campaigning against each other{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, although this agreement appeared to break down in the final weeks of the race, when Deutsch launched attack ads on television{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.\n\nDespite these controversies, Castor won the Democratic nomination on August 31. She was defeated, however, by Republican candidate [[Mel Mart\u00ednez]] in a close race on November 2, 2004. The overwhelming support for Mart\u00ednez among Latinos effectively counterbalanced Castor's relatively high popularity among swing voters throughout the state.\n\nThere was some speculation that Castor would run for [[Governor of Florida]] in 2006 to replace [[Jeb Bush]], who was ineligible for re-election due to term limits, but she announced in 2005 that she would not be a candidate.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = United States Senate election in Florida, 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#9|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (United States)\n | candidate  = Melqu\u00edades Rafael Mart\u00ednez Ruiz\n | votes      = 3,672,864\n | percentage = 49.43\n | change     = +11.9%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n | candidate  = Elizabeth Castor\n | votes      = 3,590,201\n | percentage = 48.32\n | change     = \u221214.15%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Veterans Party of America\n | candidate  = Dennis F.

Democratic U.S. Representative [[Denise Majette]] became both the first African American and the first woman to be nominated for the U.S. Senate in Georgia. Republican U.S. Representative [[Johnny Isakson]] won the open seat.\n\nThe results were almost a complete reversal from the previous election in 2000.\n\nMajette's announcement that she would seek to replace Miller also caught Democrats by surprise, as she was not on anyone's call list when Democrats began seeking a candidate to replace Miller. Further skepticism among Democrats about the viability of her candidacy surfaced when she announced that \"God\" had told her to run for the Senate. She received important endorsements from U.S. Senators [[Mary Landrieu]] of Louisiana and [[Debbie Stabenow]] of Michigan, along with many others in Washington who campaigned and raised money for Majette. Her Senate campaign slogan was \"I'll be nobody's Senator, but yours.\"\n\nA number of factors led to Majette's loss. These include her late start, her valuable time and money spent in the runoff, larger conservative turnout from a proposed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages (which Majette opposed), the popularity of President [[George W. Bush]] in Georgia, and her lack of experience (being a one-term congresswoman).\n\n{{Election box begin no change\n | title      = Republican Primary Election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sos.georgia.gov/elections/election_results/2004_0720/0000120.htm |title=United States Senator |publisher=Sos.georgia.gov |accessdate=1 February 2019}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link no change\n | party      = Republican Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Johnny Isakson]]\n | votes      = 346,765\n | percentage = 53.2%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link no change\n | party      = Republican Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Herman Cain]]\n | votes      = 170,464\n | percentage = 26.2%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link no change\n | party      = Republican Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Mac Collins]]\n | votes      = 134,053\n | percentage = 20.6%\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = Georgia General Election<ref>{{cite web | url = http://sos.georgia.gov/elections/election_results/2004_1102/002.htm| title = United States Senator | publisher = Georgia of Secretary of State | date = December 21, 2005 | accessdate = December 3, 2008}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Johnny Isakson]]\n | votes      = 1,864,205\n | percentage = 57.88\n | change     = +19.97%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Denise Majette]]\n | votes      = 1,287,695\n | percentage = 39.98\n | change     = \u221218.22%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Libertarian Party (United States)\n | candidate  = Allen Buckley\n | votes      = 69,051\n | percentage = 2.14\n | change     = +2.14%\n}}\n{{Election box majority\n | votes      = 576,510\n | percentage = 17.90\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box turnout\n | votes      = 3,220,951\n | percentage = \n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Hawaii ==\n{{Infobox election\n| election_name     = Hawaii Election\n| country           = Hawaii\n| type              = presidential\n| ongoing           = no\n| previous_election = United States Senate election in Hawaii, 1998\n| previous_year     = 1998\n| next_election     = United States Senate election in Hawaii, 2010\n| next_year         = 2010\n| image_size        = 125x136px\n\n| image1            = Daniel Inouye, official Senate photo portrait, 2008.jpg\n| nominee1          = '''[[Daniel Inouye]]'''\n| party1            = Democratic Party (United States)\n| popular_vote1     = '''313,629'''\n| percentage1       = '''75.5%'''\n\n| image2            = Cam Cavasso.jpg\n| nominee2          = [[Campbell Cavasso|Cam Cavasso]]\n| party2            = Republican Party (United States)\n| popular_vote2     = 87,172\n| percentage2       = 21.0%\n\n| map_image         = Hawaii_Election_Results_by_County,_all_Democratic.svg\n| map_size          = 100px\n| map_caption       = County Results\n| title             = U.S. Senator\n| before_election   = [[Daniel Inouye]]\n| before_party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n| after_election    = [[Daniel Inouye]]\n| after_party       = Democratic Party (United States)\n}}\n{{Main|United States Senate election in Hawaii, 2004}}\n{{See also|List of United States Senators from Hawaii}}\nIncumbent Democrat U.S. Senator [[Daniel Inouye]] won re-election to an eighth term over Republican, [[Campbell Cavasso]], a former state representative.\n\nInouye won every single county with at least 70% of the vote.

Despite the state Republican Party's strong history of embracing a moderate philosophy, the influence of conservatism among rank-and-file members had been steadily growing for decades; because of his liberal social views, Specter was often considered to be a \"[[Republican in Name Only]]\" by the right.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1J_9q-lIWRkC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=1998+ridge+itkin&source=bl&ots=AK6b-Ut25d&sig=ln8QefiZodyBTkRiIzEYxTt21Ro&hl=en&ei=cPjETOLTOoOglAenj8EH&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCQQ6AEwBQ#v=snippet&q=klink&f=false|title=Pennsylvania Elections: Statewide Contests from 1950-2004|first=John J.|last=Kennedy|date=20 December 2017|publisher=University Press of America|accessdate=20 December 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref> Although Specter had a huge fundraising advantage, Toomey was aided by $2 million of advertising from the [[Club for Growth]], a conservative [[political action committee]] that focuses on fiscal issues and targets moderate Republican incumbents.  Toomey criticized Specter as a spendthrift on economic policy and as out of touch with his own party on social issues. Although Toomey had difficulty with name recognition early in the campaign, he built huge momentum over the final weeks preceding the primary, and Specter appeared to have transitioned from having a comfortable lead to being behind his challenger <ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nSpecter received a huge boost from the vocal support of President [[George W. Bush]]; most of the state's Republican establishment also closed ranks behind Specter. This included Pennsylvania's other U.S. Senator, [[Rick Santorum]], who was noted for his social conservative views.

Except for his large margin of victory in almost uniformly Democratic [[Philadelphia]], Hoeffel was crushed at the polls; his only other wins came by close margins in three metro [[Pittsburgh]] counties; although President Bush proved to be unpopular in the state, voters were not willing to abandon Specter over party affiliation.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2004/09/27/News/Hoeffel.Trails.Specter.By.Large.Margin.In.Senate.Race-2150770.shtml | title=Archived copy | accessdate=April 30, 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504141851/http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2004/09/27/News/Hoeffel.Trails.Specter.By.Large.Margin.In.Senate.Race-2150770.shtml | archivedate=May 4, 2009}}</ref>\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = Pennsylvania General Election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#38|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>\n}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Arlen Specter]]\n | votes      = 2,925,080\n | percentage = 52.62\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Joe Hoeffel]]\n | votes      = 2,334,126\n | percentage = 41.99\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Constitution Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Jim Clymer]]\n | votes      = 220,056\n | percentage = 3.96\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Libertarian Party (United States)\n | candidate  = Betsy Summers\n | votes      = 79,263\n | percentage = 1.43\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box total\n | votes      = 5,559,105\n | percentage = 100.00\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== South Carolina ==\n{{Infobox election\n| election_name     = South Carolina Election\n| country           = South Carolina\n| type              = presidential\n| ongoing           = no\n| previous_election = United States Senate election in South Carolina, 1998\n| previous_year     = 1998\n| next_election     = United States Senate election in South Carolina, 2010\n| next_year         = 2010\n| image_size        = 125x136px\n\n| image1            = Jim DeMint headshot.jpg\n| nominee1          = '''[[Jim DeMint]]'''\n| party1            = Republican Party (United States)\n| popular_vote1     = '''857,167'''\n| percentage1       = '''53.7%'''\n\n| image2            = Inez Tenenbaum.jpg\n| nominee2          = [[Inez Tenenbaum]]\n| party2            = Democratic Party (United States)\n| popular_vote2     = 704,384\n| percentage2       = 44.1%\n\n| map_image         = South Carolina 2004 Senate Election.png\n| map_size          = 180px\n| map_caption       = County results\n| title             = U.S. Senator\n| before_election   = [[Fritz Hollings]]\n| before_party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n| after_election    = [[Jim DeMint]]\n| after_party       = Republican Party (United States)\n}}\n{{Main|United States Senate election in South Carolina, 2004}}\n{{See also|List of United States Senators from South Carolina}}\nIncumbent Democrat [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] decided to retire.

The retirement of Democratic Senator [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] gave the Republicans an opportunity to pick up the seat and with no other interesting positions up for election in 2004, a crowded field developed in the Republican primary.  Furthermore, the Republicans were motivated by having President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] at the top of the ticket enabling them to ride his coattails to victory.\n\nFormer [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[David Beasley]], from the [[Pee Dee]], entered the race and quickly emerged as the frontrunner because of his support from the evangelical voters.  However, during his term as governor from 1994 to 1998 he had greatly angered the electorate by proposing to remove the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate Naval Jack]] from the dome of the statehouse and by being against the adoption of a [[South Carolina Education Lottery|state lottery]] to provide for college scholarships. Both positions led to the loss of his [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1998|re-election in 1998]] and the issues continued to trouble him in the Senate race.\n\nThe battle for second place in the primary was between [[The Upstate|Upstate]] congressman, [[Jim DeMint]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] developer [[Thomas Ravenel]].  DeMint was able to squeak out a second-place finish because [[Charlie Condon]], a former [[South Carolina Attorney General|Attorney General of South Carolina]], split the [[South Carolina Low Country|Lowcountry]] vote with Ravenel thus providing DeMint the margin he needed.  In addition, while many voters were attracted to the Ravenel campaign and felt that he had a future in politics, they believed that he should set his sights on a less high-profile office first before trying to become senator.  Resigned to defeat, Ravenel endorsed DeMint in the runoff election.\n\nIn the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on June 22, 2004, DeMint scored a surprising victory over Beasley.  Ravenel's endorsement of DeMint proved crucial as the Lowcountry counties heavily went for the Representative from the Upstate.  Also, Beasley had burnt too many bridges while governor and was unable to increase his share of the vote in the runoff.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n\n|- style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | Republican Primary Election\n\n|-\n!

He stressed to the voters that he would follow conservative principles and provide an important Republican vote in the closely divided Senate.  Democrats fared poorly in statewide elections in South Carolina, so Tenenbaum tried to make the race about issues rather than party identification.  She attacked DeMint's support of the [[FairTax]] proposal because it would increase the sales tax by 23%.  The election victory by DeMint merely cemented South Carolina's shift to the Republican column as the best candidate the Democrats could offer was soundly defeated by the typical 10 point margin.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = South Carolina U.S. Senate Election, 2004}}\n {{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Jim DeMint]]\n | votes      = 857,167\n | percentage = 53.6\n | change     = +7.9%\n}}\n {{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Inez Tenenbaum]]\n | votes      = 704,384\n | percentage = 44.1\n | change     = \u22128.6%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Constitution Party (United States)\n | candidate  = Patrick Tyndall\n | votes      = 13,464\n | percentage = 0.8\n | change     = +0.8%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Libertarian Party (United States)\n | candidate  = Rebekah E.

Thune prevailed by a narrow 50.6\u201349.4% margin, of 4,508 votes. Senate Majority Leader [[Bill Frist]] visited South Dakota to campaign for Thune, breaking an unwritten tradition that one party's leader in the Senate would not campaign directly for the other's defeat. Daschle's loss resulted in the first ousting of a majority or minority leader since 1952 when Arizona Senator [[Ernest McFarland]] lost his seat to [[Barry Goldwater]]. Daschle's Senate term expired on January 3, 2005.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Thune, along with Frist, President Bush, and Vice President Cheney, frequently accused Daschle of being the \"chief obstructionist\" of Bush's agenda and charged him with using [[filibuster]]s to block confirmation of several of Bush's nominees to the federal judiciary. Thune also used moral values such as issues surrounding [[same-sex marriage]] and [[abortion]] to convince South Dakota voters that Daschle's positions on such topics were out-of-sync with the state's residents. The Republican candidate also drove home his strong support for the President while blasting Daschle for his vehement opposition to Bush. He attempted to sway voters by remembering that Bush won South Dakota in a landslide in 2000 and had a very high job-approval rating among South Dakotans. His opponent, the Minority Leader, repeatedly argued that he was funneling money into South Dakota for vital federal highway and water pet projects.\n\nDaschle responded to Thune's claim that he was a partisan anti-Bush obstructionist by pointing to his action just nine days after the [[September 11 attacks]] when he hugged President Bush on the Senate floor following Bush's address to Congress and the nation. He also hit back by alleging that Thune wanted to \"rubber stamp what the administration is doing.\" Daschle's use of the video of his embrace of Bush forced the [[Republican National Committee]] to demand that the ad be pulled, claiming that it suggests that Bush endorses Daschle. Shortly following the airing of the ad, in a nationally televised debate on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]]'', Thune accused Daschle of \"emboldening the enemy\" in his skepticism of the [[Iraq War]].\n\nDaschle also noticeably relied very heavily on the power of incumbency to win a fourth term. Some also argued that [[Stephanie Herseth Sandlin|Stephanie Herseth]]'s election to the state's only House seat hurt Daschle, as voters may not have been comfortable sending an all-Democratic delegation to Congress for the first time in many decades. Accusations that Daschle was possibly considering no longer being an official resident of South Dakota was believed to have offended voters there. Others have analyzed that Daschle's lengthy consideration and eventual rejection of a potential run for the presidency in 2004 took a toll on South Dakotans, who felt betrayed and used by Daschle as a result.\n\nWhen the race began in early 2004, Daschle led by 7 points in January and February. By May, his lead minimized to just 2 points and into the summer polls showed a varying number of trends: either Daschle held a slim 1- to 2-point lead or Thune held a slim 1- to 2-point lead or the race was tied right down the middle. Throughout September, Daschle led Thune by margins of 2 to 5 percent while during the entire month of October into the November 2 election, most polls showed that Thune and Daschle were dead even, usually tied 49\u201349 among likely voters. Some polls showed either Thune or Daschle leading by extremely slim margins.\n\nThune was an aide to former Senator [[James Abdnor]], the man Daschle defeated in 1986 to gain his seat in the Senate.\n\nDaschle spent a great deal of time and energy campaigning for his fellow Democrat [[Tim Johnson (South Dakota)|Tim Johnson]] in 2002, who barely defeated Thune by 524 votes. He argued that by re-electing Johnson, [[South Dakota]] would be better off because Johnson would help to keep Daschle Majority Leader. However, in the end, while Johnson won, other states voted for enough Republicans that Daschle was no longer majority leader. Furthermore, Thune's whisker-close defeat in 2002 freed him up to run against Daschle in 2004. Had Daschle not put his considerable weight to re-electing Johnson, it seems very likely that Thune would have beaten Johnson, leaving Daschle without a strong challenger for the upcoming election and making his re-election a certainty.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = South Dakota General Election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#41|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[John Thune]]\n | votes      = 197,848\n | percentage = 50.58\n | change     = +14.17%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Tom Daschle]] (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 193,340\n | percentage = 49.42\n | change     = \u221212.72%\n}}\n{{Election box majority\n | votes      = 4,508\n | percentage = 1.15\n | change     = \u221224.58%\n}}\n{{Election box turnout\n | votes      = 391,188\n | percentage = \n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Utah ==\n{{Infobox election\n| election_name     = Utah Election\n| country           = Utah\n| type              = presidential\n| ongoing           = no\n| previous_election = United States Senate election in Utah, 1998\n| previous_year     = 1998\n| next_election     = United States Senate election in Utah, 2010\n| next_year         = 2010\n| flag_year         = 1913\n| image_size        = 125x136px\n\n| image1            = Bob Bennett official portrait, 2009.jpg\n| nominee1          = '''[[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]]'''\n| party1            = Republican Party (United States)\n| popular_vote1     = '''626,640'''\n| percentage1       = '''68.7%'''\n\n| image2            = No image.svg\n| nominee2          = Paul Van Dam\n| party2            = Democratic Party (United States)\n| popular_vote2     = 258,955\n| percentage2       = 28.4%\n\n| map_image         = Utah allred.png\n| map_size          = 200px\n| map_caption       = County results\n| title             = U.S. Senator\n| before_election   = [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]]\n| before_party      = Republican Party (United States)\n| after_election    = [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]]\n| after_party       = Republican Party (United States)\n}}\n{{Main|United States Senate election in Utah, 2004}}\n{{See also|List of United States Senators from Utah}}\nIncumbent Republican Bob Bennett won re-election to a third term easily beating Democrat Paul Van Dam, former [[Attorney General of Utah]] and former [[Salt Lake County]] District Attorney\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = Utah General Election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#44|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]] (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 626,640\n | percentage = 68.73\n | change     = +4.75%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n | candidate  = Paul Van Dam\n | votes      = 258,955\n | percentage = 28.40\n | change     = \u22124.57%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Constitution Party (United States)\n | candidate  = Gary R.

Nethercutt was also hampered by his lack of name recognition in the more densely populated western part of the state, home to two-thirds of the state's population. Washington has not elected a senator from east of the [[Cascade Mountains|Cascades]] since [[Miles Poindexter]] in 1916.

Nethercutt supported the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion]] of Iraq, while Murray opposed it. Nethercutt was a heavy underdog from the start, and his campaign never gained much traction.

Bush]] as [[President of the United States|president]] and the [[2004 United States House of Representatives elections|United States House election]], as well as many state and local elections. Senators who were elected in [[1998 United States Senate elections|1998]], known as [[Classes of United States Senators|Senate Class 3]], were seeking re-election or retiring in 2004. This was the third consecutive election for Senate Class 3 where the Democrats either broke even or lost seats.  This also marked the first time since 1980 in which a presidential candidate from either party won with coattails in the Senate. As of 2018, these are the last elections held during a Presidential election year in which the Republicans made a net gain of seats.\n\n==Gains and losses==\nRepublicans won six seats but lost two themselves, giving them a net gain of four seats. Five of the six gains came from Southern states. Conservative Democrat [[Zell Miller]] of [[List of United States Senators from Georgia|Georgia]], who campaigned for President [[George W. Bush|Bush]], chose not to run for re-election and Republican [[Johnny Isakson]] won his seat; Democrat [[Fritz Hollings]] of [[List of United States Senators from South Carolina|South Carolina]] chose not to run for re-election and was succeeded by Republican [[Jim DeMint]]; Democratic vice presidential nominee [[John Edwards]] did not run for re-election and Republican [[Richard Burr]] won his [[List of United States Senators from North Carolina|North Carolina]] seat; Democrat [[Bob Graham]] of [[List of United States Senators from Florida|Florida]] chose not to run for re-election, and his seat went to Republican [[Mel Martinez]]; [[List of United States Senators from Louisiana|Louisiana]] Democrat [[John Breaux]] chose not to run for re-election and Republican [[David Vitter]] won his seat, and in [[List of United States Senators from South Dakota|South Dakota]], Republican [[John Thune]] defeated the incumbent Senate minority leader [[Tom Daschle]], the first time since [[United States Senate elections, 1952|1952]] that a sitting party leader lost re-election. Republican Senator [[Peter Fitzgerald (senator)|Peter Fitzgerald]] of [[List of United States Senators from Illinois|Illinois]] chose not to run for re-election and Democrat [[Barack Obama]] won in a landslide, becoming the Senate's only black member and only the third popularly elected since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Also, Republican Senator [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]] of [[List of United States Senators from Colorado|Colorado]] chose not to run for re-election and Democrat [[Ken Salazar]] won the open seat.\n\n==Results summary==\n\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ \u2193\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:44%;\" | '''44'''\n| style=\"background:{{Independent (United States)/meta/color}}; color:black; width:1%;\" | '''1'''\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:55%;\" | '''55'''\n|}\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:44%;\"| <span style=\"color:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}}\">'''Democratic'''</span>\n| '''Independent'''\n| style=\"width:55%;\"| <span style=\"color:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}\">'''Republican'''</span>\n|}\n\n{{United States Senate elections results, 2004}}\n\n== Change in composition ==\n\n=== Before the elections ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:800px\"\n\n|-\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|1}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|2}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|3}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|4}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|5}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|6}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|7}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|8}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|9}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|10}}\n\n|-\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|20}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|19}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|18}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|17}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|16}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|15}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|14}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|13}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|12}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|11}}\n\n|-\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|21}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|22}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|23}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|24}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|25}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|26}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|27}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|28}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|29}}\n!

Key:\n|\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n| align=center width=35px {{Party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|#}}\n| [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n|-\n| align=center width=35px {{Party shading/Independent (United States)}} | I{{Sub|#}}\n| [[Independent (United States)|Independent]]\n|-\n| align=center width=35px {{Party shading/Republican}} | R{{Sub|#}}\n| [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n|}\n|}\n\n==Political parties==\n[[File:109th US Congress Senate3.PNG|thumb|375px|Senate composition following the 2004 elections.]]\nThe Senate, as of the pre-election [[108th United States Congress|108th Congress]], was composed of 51 [[United States Republican Party|Republican]]s, 48 [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]]s, and 1 independent. (The independent, [[Jim Jeffords]] of [[Vermont]], was allied with the Democratic caucus and had voted with Democrats to give them the majority in the past.) The Democrats, therefore, needed to make a net gain of at least two seats from retiring or incumbent Republicans to gain control of the Senate (one seat if Kerry won the presidency). In the election, incumbent senators won reelection in all races but one ([[Senate Minority Leader|Democratic leader]] [[Tom Daschle]], in [[South Dakota]], lost to Republican [[John Thune]]). The seats of retiring senators were taken by the opposing party in [[Colorado]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Illinois]], [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and [[South Carolina]]. In fact, the only retiring senator whose seat was taken by a member of his party was Republican [[Don Nickles]] of [[Oklahoma]], who was succeeded by [[Tom Coburn]].\n\nRepublicans gained four seats in the 2004 elections, and entered the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]] with a 55\u201344\u20131 lead. While such a majority is formidable, it is still less than the 60 seats needed to override a [[filibuster (legislative tactic)|filibuster]] and completely control the body's agenda and procedures.\n\n===Major parties===\n\nOne Republican seat, that of retiring Senator Peter Fitzgerald in Illinois, was easily taken by Democrat [[Barack Obama]], who would be elected [[President of the United States]] four years later. In Colorado, retiring Senator [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]]'s seat was narrowly taken by Democrat [[Ken Salazar]]. In Alaska, Republican [[Lisa Murkowski]] won reelection in a tight race. In Oklahoma, [[Tom Coburn]] kept [[Don Nickles]]' seat in Republican hands, while in Kentucky, Republican [[Jim Bunning]] won a second term by a very narrow margin.\n\nThe Democrats' prospects were weakened by the fact that five of their six incumbent senators in Southern states were retiring (the sixth, [[Blanche Lincoln]] of [[Arkansas]], easily won reelection). Retiring Georgia Sen. [[Zell Miller]]'s seat, contested by [[Denise Majette]], was lost in a landslide, as was that of South Carolina Sen. [[Ernest Hollings]]. In North Carolina, Democrat [[Erskine Bowles]] lost [[John Edwards]]'s seat to Republican [[Richard Burr]]. Especially close races in Florida, Louisiana, and South Dakota all resulted in turnovers to the Republicans.\n\n===Third and minor parties===\nThe [[United States Libertarian Party|Libertarian]], [[United States Constitution Party|Constitution]], and [[United States Green Party|Green]] parties contested many of the seats. No candidate from any of these parties received sufficient support to achieve election, but some may have affected the outcome of the Alaska and Florida races by drawing votes away from the major party candidates. Of the 34 senate seats up for grabs, the Libertarians ran candidates in 20 of the races, the Constitutionalists ran 10 candidates, and the Greens ran 7 candidates.\n\n[[List of political parties in the United States|Minor parties]] in a number of states contested one or more Senate seats. Examples include the America First Party, the [[Labor Party (United States, 1996)|Labor Party]], the [[Peace and Freedom Party (United States)|Peace and Freedom Party]], and the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]]. None of these parties gained a seat in this election nor received a significant number of votes.\n\n== Race summary ==\n=== Special elections during the 108th Congress ===\nThere were no special elections during the 108th Congress.\n\n=== Elections leading to the next Congress ===\nIn these general elections, the winners were elected for the term beginning January 3, 2005; ordered by state.\n\nAll of the elections involved the Class 3 seats.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n\n|- valign=bottom\n! rowspan=2 | State<br/>{{small|(linked to<br/>summaries below)}}\n! colspan=3 | Incumbent\n! rowspan=2 | Results\n! rowspan=2 | Candidates\n\n|-\n!

In the spring, the campaign hired fundraising staff from the defunct presidential campaigns of [[Howard Dean]] and [[Bob Graham]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, and subsequently posted much higher fundraising numbers over the summer{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. Online grassroots techniques devised for the Dean campaign (Castor became a [[Dean Dozen]] candidate in August{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}) were one contributing factor{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}: another was the support of [[EMILY's List]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, which named Castor as its highest-rated candidate for the 2004 election cycle{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, even when her support for banning intact dilation and extraction (D&X) abortions was not in line with the EMILY's List support for woman's issues{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.

The complaint was dismissed by the Federal Election Commission in 2005{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.\n\nCastor's handling of [[Sami Al-Arian]] became another source of criticism during the campaign{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. In June, [[American Democracy Project (527 group in Florida)|The American Democracy Project]], a [[527 group]] founded by [[Bernie Friedman]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, began attacking Castor's handling of the incident, alleging that she had sufficient evidence to fire Al-Arian in the mid-1990s{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. Castor responded by stating that she never had sufficient evidence to fire Al-Arian, who was a [[tenure|tenured professor]] at the time{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. On June 29, Senator Graham, who had previously remained outside of the Al-Arian controversy, released a statement that \"Betty Castor acted appropriately as President of the University of South Florida to deal with Sami Al-Arian\"{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}: later, Graham and Senator [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]] brokered an agreement between the Democratic candidates to refrain from negative campaigning against each other{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, although this agreement appeared to break down in the final weeks of the race, when Deutsch launched attack ads on television{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.\n\nDespite these controversies, Castor won the Democratic nomination on August 31. She was defeated, however, by Republican candidate [[Mel Mart\u00ednez]] in a close race on November 2, 2004. The overwhelming support for Mart\u00ednez among Latinos effectively counterbalanced Castor's relatively high popularity among swing voters throughout the state.\n\nThere was some speculation that Castor would run for [[Governor of Florida]] in 2006 to replace [[Jeb Bush]], who was ineligible for re-election due to term limits, but she announced in 2005 that she would not be a candidate.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = United States Senate election in Florida, 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#9|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (United States)\n | candidate  = Melqu\u00edades Rafael Mart\u00ednez Ruiz\n | votes      = 3,672,864\n | percentage = 49.43\n | change     = +11.9%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n | candidate  = Elizabeth Castor\n | votes      = 3,590,201\n | percentage = 48.32\n | change     = \u221214.15%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Veterans Party of America\n | candidate  = Dennis F.

Democratic U.S. Representative [[Denise Majette]] became both the first African American and the first woman to be nominated for the U.S. Senate in Georgia. Republican U.S. Representative [[Johnny Isakson]] won the open seat.\n\nThe results were almost a complete reversal from the previous election in 2000.\n\nMajette's announcement that she would seek to replace Miller also caught Democrats by surprise, as she was not on anyone's call list when Democrats began seeking a candidate to replace Miller. Further skepticism among Democrats about the viability of her candidacy surfaced when she announced that \"God\" had told her to run for the Senate. She received important endorsements from U.S. Senators [[Mary Landrieu]] of Louisiana and [[Debbie Stabenow]] of Michigan, along with many others in Washington who campaigned and raised money for Majette.

Despite the state Republican Party's strong history of embracing a moderate philosophy, the influence of conservatism among rank-and-file members had been steadily growing for decades; because of his liberal social views, Specter was often considered to be a \"[[Republican in Name Only]]\" by the right.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1J_9q-lIWRkC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=1998+ridge+itkin&source=bl&ots=AK6b-Ut25d&sig=ln8QefiZodyBTkRiIzEYxTt21Ro&hl=en&ei=cPjETOLTOoOglAenj8EH&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCQQ6AEwBQ#v=snippet&q=klink&f=false|title=Pennsylvania Elections: Statewide Contests from 1950-2004|first=John J.|last=Kennedy|date=20 December 2017|publisher=University Press of America|accessdate=20 December 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref> Although Specter had a huge fundraising advantage, Toomey was aided by $2 million of advertising from the [[Club for Growth]], a conservative [[political action committee]] that focuses on fiscal issues and targets moderate Republican incumbents.  Toomey criticized Specter as a spendthrift on economic policy and as out of touch with his own party on social issues. Although Toomey had difficulty with name recognition early in the campaign, he built huge momentum over the final weeks preceding the primary, and Specter appeared to have transitioned from having a comfortable lead to being behind his challenger <ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nSpecter received a huge boost from the vocal support of President [[George W. Bush]]; most of the state's Republican establishment also closed ranks behind Specter. This included Pennsylvania's other U.S. Senator, [[Rick Santorum]], who was noted for his social conservative views.

Except for his large margin of victory in almost uniformly Democratic [[Philadelphia]], Hoeffel was crushed at the polls; his only other wins came by close margins in three metro [[Pittsburgh]] counties; although President Bush proved to be unpopular in the state, voters were not willing to abandon Specter over party affiliation.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2004/09/27/News/Hoeffel.Trails.Specter.By.Large.Margin.In.Senate.Race-2150770.shtml | title=Archived copy | accessdate=April 30, 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504141851/http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2004/09/27/News/Hoeffel.Trails.Specter.By.Large.Margin.In.Senate.Race-2150770.shtml | archivedate=May 4, 2009}}</ref>\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = Pennsylvania General Election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#38|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>\n}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Arlen Specter]]\n | votes      = 2,925,080\n | percentage = 52.62\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Joe Hoeffel]]\n | votes      = 2,334,126\n | percentage = 41.99\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Constitution Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Jim Clymer]]\n | votes      = 220,056\n | percentage = 3.96\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Libertarian Party (United States)\n | candidate  = Betsy Summers\n | votes      = 79,263\n | percentage = 1.43\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box total\n | votes      = 5,559,105\n | percentage = 100.00\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== South Carolina ==\n{{Infobox election\n| election_name     = South Carolina Election\n| country           = South Carolina\n| type              = presidential\n| ongoing           = no\n| previous_election = United States Senate election in South Carolina, 1998\n| previous_year     = 1998\n| next_election     = United States Senate election in South Carolina, 2010\n| next_year         = 2010\n| image_size        = 125x136px\n\n| image1            = Jim DeMint headshot.jpg\n| nominee1          = '''[[Jim DeMint]]'''\n| party1            = Republican Party (United States)\n| popular_vote1     = '''857,167'''\n| percentage1       = '''53.7%'''\n\n| image2            = Inez Tenenbaum.jpg\n| nominee2          = [[Inez Tenenbaum]]\n| party2            = Democratic Party (United States)\n| popular_vote2     = 704,384\n| percentage2       = 44.1%\n\n| map_image         = South Carolina 2004 Senate Election.png\n| map_size          = 180px\n| map_caption       = County results\n| title             = U.S. Senator\n| before_election   = [[Fritz Hollings]]\n| before_party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n| after_election    = [[Jim DeMint]]\n| after_party       = Republican Party (United States)\n}}\n{{Main|United States Senate election in South Carolina, 2004}}\n{{See also|List of United States Senators from South Carolina}}\nIncumbent Democrat [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] decided to retire.

The retirement of Democratic Senator [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] gave the Republicans an opportunity to pick up the seat and with no other interesting positions up for election in 2004, a crowded field developed in the Republican primary.  Furthermore, the Republicans were motivated by having President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] at the top of the ticket enabling them to ride his coattails to victory.\n\nFormer [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[David Beasley]], from the [[Pee Dee]], entered the race and quickly emerged as the frontrunner because of his support from the evangelical voters.  However, during his term as governor from 1994 to 1998 he had greatly angered the electorate by proposing to remove the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate Naval Jack]] from the dome of the statehouse and by being against the adoption of a [[South Carolina Education Lottery|state lottery]] to provide for college scholarships. Both positions led to the loss of his [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1998|re-election in 1998]] and the issues continued to trouble him in the Senate race.\n\nThe battle for second place in the primary was between [[The Upstate|Upstate]] congressman, [[Jim DeMint]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] developer [[Thomas Ravenel]].  DeMint was able to squeak out a second-place finish because [[Charlie Condon]], a former [[South Carolina Attorney General|Attorney General of South Carolina]], split the [[South Carolina Low Country|Lowcountry]] vote with Ravenel thus providing DeMint the margin he needed.  In addition, while many voters were attracted to the Ravenel campaign and felt that he had a future in politics, they believed that he should set his sights on a less high-profile office first before trying to become senator.  Resigned to defeat, Ravenel endorsed DeMint in the runoff election.\n\nIn the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on June 22, 2004, DeMint scored a surprising victory over Beasley.  Ravenel's endorsement of DeMint proved crucial as the Lowcountry counties heavily went for the Representative from the Upstate.  Also, Beasley had burnt too many bridges while governor and was unable to increase his share of the vote in the runoff.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n\n|- style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | Republican Primary Election\n\n|-\n!

He stressed to the voters that he would follow conservative principles and provide an important Republican vote in the closely divided Senate.  Democrats fared poorly in statewide elections in South Carolina, so Tenenbaum tried to make the race about issues rather than party identification.  She attacked DeMint's support of the [[FairTax]] proposal because it would increase the sales tax by 23%.  The election victory by DeMint merely cemented South Carolina's shift to the Republican column as the best candidate the Democrats could offer was soundly defeated by the typical 10 point margin.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = South Carolina U.S. Senate Election, 2004}}\n {{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Jim DeMint]]\n | votes      = 857,167\n | percentage = 53.6\n | change     = +7.9%\n}}\n {{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Inez Tenenbaum]]\n | votes      = 704,384\n | percentage = 44.1\n | change     = \u22128.6%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Constitution Party (United States)\n | candidate  = Patrick Tyndall\n | votes      = 13,464\n | percentage = 0.8\n | change     = +0.8%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Libertarian Party (United States)\n | candidate  = Rebekah E.

Thune prevailed by a narrow 50.6\u201349.4% margin, of 4,508 votes. Senate Majority Leader [[Bill Frist]] visited South Dakota to campaign for Thune, breaking an unwritten tradition that one party's leader in the Senate would not campaign directly for the other's defeat. Daschle's loss resulted in the first ousting of a majority or minority leader since 1952 when Arizona Senator [[Ernest McFarland]] lost his seat to [[Barry Goldwater]]. Daschle's Senate term expired on January 3, 2005.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Thune, along with Frist, President Bush, and Vice President Cheney, frequently accused Daschle of being the \"chief obstructionist\" of Bush's agenda and charged him with using [[filibuster]]s to block confirmation of several of Bush's nominees to the federal judiciary. Thune also used moral values such as issues surrounding [[same-sex marriage]] and [[abortion]] to convince South Dakota voters that Daschle's positions on such topics were out-of-sync with the state's residents. The Republican candidate also drove home his strong support for the President while blasting Daschle for his vehement opposition to Bush. He attempted to sway voters by remembering that Bush won South Dakota in a landslide in 2000 and had a very high job-approval rating among South Dakotans. His opponent, the Minority Leader, repeatedly argued that he was funneling money into South Dakota for vital federal highway and water pet projects.\n\nDaschle responded to Thune's claim that he was a partisan anti-Bush obstructionist by pointing to his action just nine days after the [[September 11 attacks]] when he hugged President Bush on the Senate floor following Bush's address to Congress and the nation. He also hit back by alleging that Thune wanted to \"rubber stamp what the administration is doing.\" Daschle's use of the video of his embrace of Bush forced the [[Republican National Committee]] to demand that the ad be pulled, claiming that it suggests that Bush endorses Daschle. Shortly following the airing of the ad, in a nationally televised debate on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]]'', Thune accused Daschle of \"emboldening the enemy\" in his skepticism of the [[Iraq War]].\n\nDaschle also noticeably relied very heavily on the power of incumbency to win a fourth term. Some also argued that [[Stephanie Herseth Sandlin|Stephanie Herseth]]'s election to the state's only House seat hurt Daschle, as voters may not have been comfortable sending an all-Democratic delegation to Congress for the first time in many decades. Accusations that Daschle was possibly considering no longer being an official resident of South Dakota was believed to have offended voters there. Others have analyzed that Daschle's lengthy consideration and eventual rejection of a potential run for the presidency in 2004 took a toll on South Dakotans, who felt betrayed and used by Daschle as a result.\n\nWhen the race began in early 2004, Daschle led by 7 points in January and February. By May, his lead minimized to just 2 points and into the summer polls showed a varying number of trends: either Daschle held a slim 1- to 2-point lead or Thune held a slim 1- to 2-point lead or the race was tied right down the middle. Throughout September, Daschle led Thune by margins of 2 to 5 percent while during the entire month of October into the November 2 election, most polls showed that Thune and Daschle were dead even, usually tied 49\u201349 among likely voters. Some polls showed either Thune or Daschle leading by extremely slim margins.\n\nThune was an aide to former Senator [[James Abdnor]], the man Daschle defeated in 1986 to gain his seat in the Senate.\n\nDaschle spent a great deal of time and energy campaigning for his fellow Democrat [[Tim Johnson (South Dakota)|Tim Johnson]] in 2002, who barely defeated Thune by 524 votes. He argued that by re-electing Johnson, [[South Dakota]] would be better off because Johnson would help to keep Daschle Majority Leader. However, in the end, while Johnson won, other states voted for enough Republicans that Daschle was no longer majority leader. Furthermore, Thune's whisker-close defeat in 2002 freed him up to run against Daschle in 2004. Had Daschle not put his considerable weight to re-electing Johnson, it seems very likely that Thune would have beaten Johnson, leaving Daschle without a strong challenger for the upcoming election and making his re-election a certainty.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = South Dakota General Election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#41|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[John Thune]]\n | votes      = 197,848\n | percentage = 50.58\n | change     = +14.17%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Tom Daschle]] (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 193,340\n | percentage = 49.42\n | change     = \u221212.72%\n}}\n{{Election box majority\n | votes      = 4,508\n | percentage = 1.15\n | change     = \u221224.58%\n}}\n{{Election box turnout\n | votes      = 391,188\n | percentage = \n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Utah ==\n{{Infobox election\n| election_name     = Utah Election\n| country           = Utah\n| type              = presidential\n| ongoing           = no\n| previous_election = United States Senate election in Utah, 1998\n| previous_year     = 1998\n| next_election     = United States Senate election in Utah, 2010\n| next_year         = 2010\n| flag_year         = 1913\n| image_size        = 125x136px\n\n| image1            = Bob Bennett official portrait, 2009.jpg\n| nominee1          = '''[[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]]'''\n| party1            = Republican Party (United States)\n| popular_vote1     = '''626,640'''\n| percentage1       = '''68.7%'''\n\n| image2            = No image.svg\n| nominee2          = Paul Van Dam\n| party2            = Democratic Party (United States)\n| popular_vote2     = 258,955\n| percentage2       = 28.4%\n\n| map_image         = Utah allred.png\n| map_size          = 200px\n| map_caption       = County results\n| title             = U.S. Senator\n| before_election   = [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]]\n| before_party      = Republican Party (United States)\n| after_election    = [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]]\n| after_party       = Republican Party (United States)\n}}\n{{Main|United States Senate election in Utah, 2004}}\n{{See also|List of United States Senators from Utah}}\nIncumbent Republican Bob Bennett won re-election to a third term easily beating Democrat Paul Van Dam, former [[Attorney General of Utah]] and former [[Salt Lake County]] District Attorney\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = Utah General Election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#44|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]] (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 626,640\n | percentage = 68.73\n | change     = +4.75%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n | candidate  = Paul Van Dam\n | votes      = 258,955\n | percentage = 28.40\n | change     = \u22124.57%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Constitution Party (United States)\n | candidate  = Gary R.

Nethercutt was also hampered by his lack of name recognition in the more densely populated western part of the state, home to two-thirds of the state's population. Washington has not elected a senator from east of the [[Cascade Mountains|Cascades]] since [[Miles Poindexter]] in 1916.

Nethercutt supported the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion]] of Iraq, while Murray opposed it. Nethercutt was a heavy underdog from the start, and his campaign never gained much traction.
