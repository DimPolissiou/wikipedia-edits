For a more accessible and less technical introduction to this topic, see [[Introduction to entropy]].}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n{{Infobox physical quantity\n| name =Entropy\n| width =\n| background =\n| image =\n| caption =\n| unit =joules per kelvin (J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>)\n| otherunits =\n| symbols = ''S''\n| baseunits = kg\u22c5m<sup>2</sup>\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>\n| dimension =\n| extensive =\n| intensive =\n| conserved =\n| transformsas =\n| derivations =\n}}\n{{Thermodynamics|expanded=sysprop}}\n{{EntropySegments}}\n\nIn [[statistical mechanics]], '''entropy''' is an [[Intensive and extensive properties#Extensive properties|extensive property]] of a [[thermodynamic system]]. It is closely related to the number {{math|\u03a9}} of microscopic configurations (known as [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Entropy expresses the number {{math|\u03a9}} of different configurations that a system defined by macroscopic variables could assume.<ref>{{cite book|first=Roberto|last=Ligrone|date=2019|chapter=Glossary|department=Entropy|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=c86aDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA478|title=Biological Innovations that Built the World: A Four-billion-year Journey through Life & Earth History|page=478|isbn=978-3030160562|publisher=Springer|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy <math>S</math> is the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of microstates, multiplied by the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}}. Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),\n\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln \\Omega .</math>\n\nMacroscopic systems typically have a very large number {{math|\u03a9}} of possible microscopic configurations.  For example, the entropy of an [[ideal gas]] is proportional to the number of gas molecules {{math|''N''}}.  The number of molecules in 22.4 liters of gas at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] is roughly 6.022 \u00d7 10<sup>23</sup> (the [[Avogadro number]]).\n\nThe [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems, like [[organisms]], may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy either increases or remains constant. Therefore, the entropy in a specific system can decrease as long as the total entropy of the [[Universe]] does not. Entropy is a function of the [[state function|state of the system]], so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]], the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.\n\nBecause it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or [[randomness]] of a system, or of the lack of information about it.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Edward A.|last1=Rietman|first2=Jack A.|last2=Tuszynski|editor-first1=Yuzhuo|editor-last1=Wang|editor-first2=Francesco|editor-last2=Crea|date=2017|chapter=Thermodynamics & Cancer Dormancy: A Perspective|department=Introduction: Entropy & Information|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=g6UzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|title=Tumor Dormancy & Recurrence (Cancer Drug Discovery and Development)|page=63|isbn=978-3319592404|publisher=Humana Press|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> The concept of entropy plays a central role in [[information theory]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Clausius.jpg|thumb|upright|{{nowrap|[[Rudolf Clausius]]}} {{nowrap|(1822\u20131888),}} originator of the concept of entropy]]\n{{Main|History of entropy}}\n\nThe French mathematician [[Lazare Carnot]] proposed in his 1803 paper ''Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement'' that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of ''moment of activity''; in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful [[energy]].

Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the [[classical thermodynamics]] viewpoint, the microscopic details of a system are not considered. Instead, the behavior of a system is described in terms of a set of empirically defined thermodynamic variables, such as temperature, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity. The classical thermodynamics description assumes a state of equilibrium although more recent attempts have been made to develop useful definitions of entropy in [[Nonequilibrium thermodynamics|nonequilibrium]] systems as well.\n\nThe [[Statistical mechanics|statistical definition]] of entropy and other thermodynamic properties were developed later. In this viewpoint, thermodynamic properties are defined in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system \u2013 modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, [[phonons]], spins, etc.).\n\n=== Function of state ===\nThere are many  [[thermodynamic properties]] that are [[functions of state]]. This means that at a particular thermodynamic state (which should not be confused with the microscopic state of a system), these properties have a certain value. Often, if two properties of the system are determined, then the state is determined and the other properties' values can also be determined. For instance, a quantity of gas at a particular temperature and pressure has its state fixed by those values and thus has a specific  volume that is determined by those values.  As another instance, a system composed of a pure substance of a single [[Phase (matter)|phase]] at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined (and is thus a particular state) and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy.<ref>J.

In the Carnot cycle, the working fluid returns to the same state it had at the start of the cycle, hence the [[line integral]] of any state function, such as entropy, over this reversible cycle is zero.\n\n=== Reversible process ===\nEntropy is conserved for a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]]. A reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible.  In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost.  More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process.<ref>{{cite web|title=6.5 Irreversibility, Entropy Changes, and ''Lost Work''|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node48.html|website=web.mit.edu|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the ''total'' entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible.

The possibility that the Carnot function could be the temperature as measured from a zero temperature, was suggested by [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] in a letter to Kelvin.

Clausius called this state function ''entropy''. One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.\n\nClausius then asked what would happen if there should be less work produced by the system than that predicted by Carnot's principle. The right-hand side of the first equation would be the upper bound of the work output by the system, which would now be converted into an inequality\n\n: <math> W<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nWhen the second equation is used to express the work as a difference in heats, we get\n\n: <math> Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n: or\n: <math> Q_\\text{C}>\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nSo more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the Carnot cycle. If we denote the entropies by {{math|''S''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''Q''<sub>''i''</sub>/''T''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for the two states, then the above inequality can be written as a decrease in the entropy\n\n:<math>S_\\text{H}-S_\\text{C}<0</math>\n: or\n:<math>S_\\text{H}<S_\\text{C}</math>\n\nThe entropy that leaves the system is greater than the entropy that enters the system, implying that some irreversible process prevents the cycle from producing the maximum amount of work predicted by the Carnot equation.\n\nThe Carnot cycle and efficiency are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system.  Other cycles, such as the [[Otto cycle]], [[Diesel cycle]] and [[Brayton cycle]], can be analyzed from the standpoint of the Carnot cycle. Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells requires an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Classical thermodynamics ===\n{{Main|Entropy (classical thermodynamics)}}  {{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n\nThe thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an [[isolated system]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the [[Carnot cycle]]. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its [[absolute temperature]]). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a [[function of state]], specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.\n\nWhile Clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the [[second law of thermodynamics]], entropy of an isolated [[Thermodynamic system|system]] always increases for irreversible processes. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may ''not'' flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.\n\nAccording to the [[Clausius theorem|Clausius equality]], for a reversible cyclic process:\n<math>\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T} = 0.</math>\nThis means the line integral <math>\\int_L \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}</math> is [[State function|path-independent]].\n\nSo we can define a state function {{mvar|S}} called entropy, which satisfies\n<math>d S = \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}.</math>\n\nTo find the entropy difference between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Atkins|first=Peter|author2=Julio De Paula|title=Physical Chemistry, 8th ed.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=79|isbn=978-0-19-870072-2}}</ref> Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Engel|first=Thomas|author2=Philip Reid|title=Physical Chemistry|publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings|year=2006|page=86|isbn=978-0-8053-3842-3}}</ref> However, the entropy change of the surroundings is different.\n\nWe can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the [[third law of thermodynamics]], which states that ''S'' = 0 at [[absolute zero]] for perfect crystals.\n\nFrom a macroscopic perspective, in [[classical thermodynamics]] the entropy is interpreted as a [[state function]] of a [[thermodynamic system]]: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy \u0394''E'', and its entropy falls by \u0394''S'', a quantity at least ''T''<sub>R</sub> \u0394''S'' of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (''T''<sub>R</sub> is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\n=== Statistical mechanics ===\nThe statistical definition was developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor\u2014known as [[Boltzmann's constant]]. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\n\nThe [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics]] is the measure of uncertainty, or ''mixedupness'' in the phrase of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]], which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. In contrast to  the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder).<ref name=McH>{{cite book|last1=Licker|first1=Mark D.|title=McGraw-Hill concise encyclopedia of chemistry.|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-143953-4}}</ref><ref name=\"Sethna78\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=John O.E.|title=The essential dictionary of science|date=2004|publisher=Barnes & Noble|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}</ref> This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system ([[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that could cause the observed macroscopic state ([[macrostate]]) of the system.

This density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates. For most practical purposes, this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for ''S'' can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa.\n\nIn what has been called ''the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics'' or ''[[Fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics|the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics]]'', the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable (i.e. ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1/\u03a9, where \u03a9 is the number of microstates); this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schroeder|first1=Daniel V.|title=An introduction to thermal physics|date=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=978-0-201-38027-9|page=57|edition=}}</ref> Then the previous equation reduces to\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\log \\Omega.</math>\n\nIn thermodynamics, such a system is one in which the volume, number of molecules, and internal energy are fixed (the [[microcanonical ensemble]]).\n\nThe most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system.

For example, if observer A uses the variables ''U'', ''V'' and ''W'', and observer B uses ''U'', ''V'', ''W'', ''X'', then, by changing ''X'', observer B can cause an effect that looks like a violation of the second law of thermodynamics to observer A.

It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\n\nIn a [[thermodynamic system]], pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the [[equilibrium state]] has higher [[probability]] (more possible [[combination]]s of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) than any other state.\n\nAs an example, for a glass of [[ice]] water in air at [[room temperature]], the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the [[thermal energy]] from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\n\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an [[isolated system]] such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the [[thermodynamic system]] is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\n\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved [[state function]] that is of great importance in the sciences of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].<ref name=\"McH\" /><ref name=\"Wiley91\">{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley I.|title=Chemical, biochemical, and engineering thermodynamics|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-66174-0|page=91|edition=4th}}</ref> Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their [[T-symmetry|time reversals]] (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy.<ref name=\"McQuarrie817\">{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Donald A.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that a closed system has entropy that may increase or otherwise remain constant. Chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and entropy plays an important role in determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds.\n\nOne dictionary definition of entropy is that it is \"a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work\". For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine.  A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.\n\nA special case of entropy increase, the [[entropy of mixing]], occurs when two or more different substances are mixed. If the substances are at the same temperature and pressure, there is no net exchange of heat or work \u2013 the entropy change is entirely due to the mixing of the different substances.

Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. Secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing [[adiabatic cooling]], which performs [[adiabatic process|adiabatic work]]. As a result, there is no possibility of a [[perpetual motion]] system. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a [[chemical reaction]], means that it is energetically more efficient.\n\nIt follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. An [[air conditioner]], for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] places limits on a system's ability to do [[work (thermodynamics)|useful work]].<ref name=\"Daintith\">{{Cite book|last=Daintith| first=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of Physics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-280628-4}}</ref> The entropy change of a system at temperature ''T'' absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat ''\u03b4q''\nin a reversible way, is given by ''\u03b4q''/''T''.

In the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy ''U'' to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. This relation is known as the ''fundamental thermodynamic relation''. If external pressure ''p'' bears on the volume ''V'' as the only external parameter, this relation is:\n\n: <math>dU = T \\, dS - p \\, dV</math>\n\nSince both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature ''T'', implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the entropy, pressure and temperature may not exist).\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the [[Maxwell relations]] and the [[relations between heat capacities]].\n\n=== Entropy in chemical thermodynamics ===\nThermodynamic entropy is central in [[chemical thermodynamics]], enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that entropy in an [[isolated system]] \u2013 the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings \u2013 increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. The Clausius equation of \u03b4''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' = \u0394''S'' introduces the measurement of entropy change, \u0394''S''. Entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems \u2013 always from hotter to cooler spontaneously.\n\nThe thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit [[joule]] per [[kelvin]] (J/K) in the International System of Units (SI).\n\nThermodynamic entropy is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the [[kilogram]] (unit: J\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>). Alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of substance, in which case it is called the ''molar entropy'' with a unit of J\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThus, when one mole of substance at about {{val|0|u=K}} is warmed by its surroundings to {{val|298|u=K}}, the sum of the incremental values of ''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' constitute each element's or compound's standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at {{val|298|u=K}}.<ref name=\"ctms\">{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=J.

Thus, damage is interpreted as a fundamental property (and obligation) of moving and deformable systems.\n\nThe complex (\u03a3) of irreversible damage (\u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub>) is determined by the effective (absorbed in the system) energy (''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup>), caused by forces of any nature:\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(U_\\Sigma^\\mathit{eff}) = \\omega_\\Sigma \\left(U_n^\\mathit{eff}, U_\\tau^\\mathit{eff}, U_T^\\mathit{eff}, U_{ch}^\\mathit{eff}, \\ldots, U_0, U_0, t \\right) = \\omega_{\\Sigma U} \\ge 0</math>\n\nHere, the indices ''n'' and \u03c4 indicate normal and shear mechanical loads, ''T'' and ''Ch'' indicate thermal and electrochemical loads that generate the corresponding energy fluxes.\n\nThus, damage \u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub> is an energy thermomechanical function, since it takes into account both any force factors and temperature ''T''<sub>\u03a3</sub>. This means that tribo-fatigue entropy is a measure of the absorption of energy caused by all sources. Determination procedures of ''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup> have been developed (see, for example.<ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L. A 2005\"/><ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L. A 2007\"/><ref name=\"Sherbakov, S. S 2010\"/><ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L. \u0410 2010\"/><ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L. A. 2016\">Sosnovskiy, L. A., Sherbakov, S. S. Mechanothermodynamics. \u2013 Springer, 2016. \u2013 155 p.</ref>\n\nThe spatial condition of physical damage to objects has been established,<ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L. A 2007\"/> which states: the development of irreversible damage processes is possible and is realized with a certain probability ''\u0420''>0, when a finite region ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub> with a nonzero level of effective energy ''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup>>0 (internal entropy ''S''<sub>''i''</sub>>0) arises in the object \u2013 a dangerous volume\n\n<math>V_{P\\gamma} \\in V_{P\\gamma} \\left(Q_i, U_\\Sigma^\\mathit{eff}, S_i\\right) \\ge 0,</math>\n\nwhere ''Q''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2013 are internal force factors.\n\nIf ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>=0, then \u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub>=0 and, therefore, the evolution of an object by damage is impossi-ble (reversible system). In an irreversible system ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>\u2264''V'' there is an absolute value (measure) of its spatial damage (''V'' is its geometric volume). Calculation methods and classification of dangerous volumes (''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>) for typical material objects (deformable solids and systems) under various conditions have been developed (see, for example <ref name=\"Sherbakov, S. S 2010\"/>). The scale of system damage can be any.\n\nUsing the concept of tribo-fatigue entropy, one can give an entropic interpretation of damage: irreversible damage to an object is identical to a change in internal entropy in its dangerous volume\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(S_{TF}) \\equiv \\frac{(d_i S)_{TF}}{dV_{P\\gamma}} = \\omega_{\\Sigma S}.</math>\n\nAn open thermodynamic system in which damaged or solid objects are distributed (scattered) are called a mechanothermodynamic system (MTD). As shown in,<ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L. A. 2016\"/><ref>Sosnovskiy, L. A., Sherbakov, S. S. Mechanothermodynamical system and its behavior // Continuum Mechanics and Thermodynamics. \u2013 2012. \u2013 \u2116 24. \u2013 \u0420. 239\u2013256.</ref> the change in entropy in such a system is determined by the function of \u039b-interaction of the thermodynamic (''TD'' index) and tribo-fatigue (''TF'' index) entropies:\n\n<math>\\begin{align}\ndS_{MTD} &= \\left[(dS)_{TD} \\rightleftarrows (d_i S)_{TF}\\right] \\\\\n&= \\Lambda_{TD\\backslash TF} \\left[\\left(\\frac{dU + p\\,dV}{T} - \\frac{1}{T}\\sum_1^n{\\mu\\,dN_k}\\right)_{TD} + \\left(\\gamma_1^{(w)}\\frac{\\omega_\\Sigma}{T_\\Sigma}dV_{P\\gamma}\\right)_{TF} \\right]\n\\uparrow , \\Lambda \\lesseqgtr 1. \\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis equation allows the analysis of any (conceivable) state of the system. According to him, it is the growth of tribo-fatigue entropy, due to the thermomechanical state of the system, that can lead to both destruction and decomposition of moving and deformable objects and systems; in thermodynamic equations such states are out of the question. This equation is constructed taking into account various mechanisms of interaction (\u039b<sub>''ij''</sub>, \u039b<sub>''TD/TF''</sub>) between the components of entropy.\n\nWe also note that the \u039b-functions defined here at the macro level turn out to be quite similar to the non-additivity parameters in the q-calculus [91], on the basis of which, for example, the statistical theory of non-additive systems at the nanoscale has been developed [92]. This indicates the fundamental nature of modern concepts of non-additive systems. The mechanothermodynamic system can be considered, therefore, as one of them.\n\nThus, it follows from the foregoing that the evolution of the system in the general case is determined by the intensity of the processes of irreversible changes in entropy \u2013 thermodynamic and tribo-fatigue; the production of internal mechanothermodynamic entropy is as eternal as motion and damage.\n\n=== Thermodynamic and statistical mechanics concepts ===\n<!-- Note: renamed from \"definitions\" as these are not differing definitions of entropy \u2013 they are various concepts which are related to or use the concept of entropy; some may define a particular way of determining entropy in some specific circumstance -->\n* Entropy unit \u2013 a non-S.I. unit of thermodynamic entropy, usually denoted \"e.u.\" and equal to one [[calorie]] per kelvin per mole, or 4.184 [[joule]]s per kelvin per mole.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=E02151|title=Entropy unit}}</ref>\n* [[Gibbs entropy]] \u2013 the usual statistical mechanical entropy of a thermodynamic system.\n* [[Boltzmann entropy]] \u2013 a type of Gibbs entropy, which neglects internal statistical correlations in the overall particle distribution.\n* [[Tsallis entropy]] \u2013 a generalization of the standard Boltzmann\u2013Gibbs entropy.\n* [[Standard molar entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy content of one mole of substance, under conditions of standard temperature and pressure.\n* [[Residual entropy]] \u2013 the entropy present after a substance is cooled arbitrarily close to [[absolute zero]].\n* [[Entropy of mixing]] \u2013 the change in the entropy when two different [[chemical substance]]s or [[component (thermodynamics)|components]] are mixed.\n* [[Loop entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy lost upon bringing together two residues of a polymer within a prescribed distance.\n* [[Conformational entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy associated with the physical arrangement of a [[polymer]] chain that assumes a compact or [[globular protein|globular]] state in solution.\n* [[Entropic force]] \u2013 a microscopic force or reaction tendency related to system organization changes, molecular frictional considerations, and statistical variations.\n* [[Free entropy]] \u2013 an entropic thermodynamic potential analogous to the free energy.\n* [[Entropic explosion]] \u2013  an explosion in which the reactants undergo a large change in volume without releasing a large amount of heat.\n* Entropy change \u2013 a change in entropy ''dS'' between two [[equilibrium state]]s is given by the heat transferred ''dQ''<sub>rev</sub> divided by the [[absolute temperature]] ''T'' of the [[thermodynamic system|system]] in this interval.\n* [[Sackur\u2013Tetrode equation|Sackur\u2013Tetrode entropy]] \u2013 the entropy of a monatomic classical ideal gas determined via quantum considerations.\n\n=== The arrow of time ===\n{{Main|Entropy (arrow of time)}}\nEntropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an [[arrow of time]]. As time progresses, the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an [[isolated system]] never decreases in large systems over significant periods of time. Hence, from this perspective, entropy measurement is thought of as a clock in these conditions.\n\n===Entropy in DNA sequences===\n\nEntropy has been proven useful in the analysis of DNA sequences. Many entropy-based measures have been shown to distinguish between different structural regions of the genome, differentiate between coding and non-coding regions of DNA and can also be applied for the recreation of evolutionary trees by determining the evolutionary distance between different species.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thanos|first=Dimitrios|last2=Li|first2=Wentian|last3=Provata|first3=Astero|date=2018-03-01|title=Entropic fluctuations in DNA sequences|url= |journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications|volume=493|pages=444\u2013457|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2017.11.119|issn=0378-4371}}</ref>\n\n=== Cosmology ===\n{{Main|Heat death of the universe}}\n\nSince a finite universe is an isolated system, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that its total entropy is continually increasing. It has been speculated, since the 19th century, that the universe is fated to a [[heat death of the universe|heat death]] in which all the [[energy]] ends up as a homogeneous distribution of thermal energy so that no more work can be extracted from any source.\n\nIf the universe can be considered to have generally increasing entropy, then \u2013 as [[Roger Penrose]] has pointed out \u2013 [[gravity]] plays an important role in the increase because gravity causes dispersed matter to accumulate into stars, which collapse eventually into [[black hole]]s.

It is closely related to the number {{math|\u03a9}} of microscopic configurations (known as [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Entropy expresses the number {{math|\u03a9}} of different configurations that a system defined by macroscopic variables could assume.<ref>{{cite book|first=Roberto|last=Ligrone|date=2019|chapter=Glossary|department=Entropy|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=c86aDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA478|title=Biological Innovations that Built the World: A Four-billion-year Journey through Life & Earth History|page=478|isbn=978-3030160562|publisher=Springer|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy <math>S</math> is the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of microstates, multiplied by the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}}. Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),\n\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln \\Omega .</math>\n\nMacroscopic systems typically have a very large number {{math|\u03a9}} of possible microscopic configurations.  For example, the entropy of an [[ideal gas]] is proportional to the number of gas molecules {{math|''N''}}.  The number of molecules in 22.4 liters of gas at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] is roughly 6.022 \u00d7 10<sup>23</sup> (the [[Avogadro number]]).\n\nThe [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems, like [[organisms]], may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy either increases or remains constant. Therefore, the entropy in a specific system can decrease as long as the total entropy of the [[Universe]] does not. Entropy is a function of the [[state function|state of the system]], so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]], the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.\n\nBecause it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or [[randomness]] of a system, or of the lack of information about it.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Edward A.|last1=Rietman|first2=Jack A.|last2=Tuszynski|editor-first1=Yuzhuo|editor-last1=Wang|editor-first2=Francesco|editor-last2=Crea|date=2017|chapter=Thermodynamics & Cancer Dormancy: A Perspective|department=Introduction: Entropy & Information|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=g6UzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|title=Tumor Dormancy & Recurrence (Cancer Drug Discovery and Development)|page=63|isbn=978-3319592404|publisher=Humana Press|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> The concept of entropy plays a central role in [[information theory]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Clausius.jpg|thumb|upright|{{nowrap|[[Rudolf Clausius]]}} {{nowrap|(1822\u20131888),}} originator of the concept of entropy]]\n{{Main|History of entropy}}\n\nThe French mathematician [[Lazare Carnot]] proposed in his 1803 paper ''Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement'' that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of ''moment of activity''; in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful [[energy]]. Building on this work, in 1824 Lazare's son [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] published ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'', which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever \"[[caloric theory|caloric]]\" (what is now known as [[heat]]) falls through a temperature difference, work or [[Work (physics)|motive power]] can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He used an analogy with how water falls in a [[water wheel]].

In 1877 Boltzmann visualized a probabilistic way to measure the entropy of an ensemble of [[ideal gas]] particles, in which he defined entropy as proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of microstates such a gas could occupy.

Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the [[classical thermodynamics]] viewpoint, the microscopic details of a system are not considered. Instead, the behavior of a system is described in terms of a set of empirically defined thermodynamic variables, such as temperature, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity. The classical thermodynamics description assumes a state of equilibrium although more recent attempts have been made to develop useful definitions of entropy in [[Nonequilibrium thermodynamics|nonequilibrium]] systems as well.\n\nThe [[Statistical mechanics|statistical definition]] of entropy and other thermodynamic properties were developed later. In this viewpoint, thermodynamic properties are defined in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system \u2013 modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, [[phonons]], spins, etc.).\n\n=== Function of state ===\nThere are many  [[thermodynamic properties]] that are [[functions of state]]. This means that at a particular thermodynamic state (which should not be confused with the microscopic state of a system), these properties have a certain value. Often, if two properties of the system are determined, then the state is determined and the other properties' values can also be determined. For instance, a quantity of gas at a particular temperature and pressure has its state fixed by those values and thus has a specific  volume that is determined by those values.  As another instance, a system composed of a pure substance of a single [[Phase (matter)|phase]] at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined (and is thus a particular state) and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy.<ref>J.

In the Carnot cycle, the working fluid returns to the same state it had at the start of the cycle, hence the [[line integral]] of any state function, such as entropy, over this reversible cycle is zero.\n\n=== Reversible process ===\nEntropy is conserved for a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]]. A reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible.  In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost.  More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process.<ref>{{cite web|title=6.5 Irreversibility, Entropy Changes, and ''Lost Work''|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node48.html|website=web.mit.edu|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the ''total'' entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible.

According to Carnot's principle, [[work (physics)|work]] can only be produced by the system when there is a temperature difference, and the work should be some function of the difference in temperature and the heat absorbed ({{math|''Q''<sub>H</sub>}}).

The possibility that the Carnot function could be the temperature as measured from a zero temperature, was suggested by [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] in a letter to Kelvin. This allowed Kelvin to establish his absolute temperature scale.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clerk Maxwel|first1=James|editor1-last=Pesic|editor1-first=Peter|title=Theory of heat|date=2001|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-41735-6|pages=115\u2013158}}</ref> It is also known that the work produced by the system is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir and the heat given up to the cold reservoir:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>W=Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nSince the latter is valid over the entire cycle, this gave Clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle, work and heat would not be equal, but rather their difference would be a state function that would vanish upon completion of the cycle.

Clausius called this state function ''entropy''. One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.\n\nClausius then asked what would happen if there should be less work produced by the system than that predicted by Carnot's principle. The right-hand side of the first equation would be the upper bound of the work output by the system, which would now be converted into an inequality\n\n: <math> W<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nWhen the second equation is used to express the work as a difference in heats, we get\n\n: <math> Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n: or\n: <math> Q_\\text{C}>\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nSo more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the Carnot cycle. If we denote the entropies by {{math|''S''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''Q''<sub>''i''</sub>/''T''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for the two states, then the above inequality can be written as a decrease in the entropy\n\n:<math>S_\\text{H}-S_\\text{C}<0</math>\n: or\n:<math>S_\\text{H}<S_\\text{C}</math>\n\nThe entropy that leaves the system is greater than the entropy that enters the system, implying that some irreversible process prevents the cycle from producing the maximum amount of work predicted by the Carnot equation.\n\nThe Carnot cycle and efficiency are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system.  Other cycles, such as the [[Otto cycle]], [[Diesel cycle]] and [[Brayton cycle]], can be analyzed from the standpoint of the Carnot cycle. Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells requires an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Classical thermodynamics ===\n{{Main|Entropy (classical thermodynamics)}}  {{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n\nThe thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an [[isolated system]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the [[Carnot cycle]]. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its [[absolute temperature]]). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a [[function of state]], specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.\n\nWhile Clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the [[second law of thermodynamics]], entropy of an isolated [[Thermodynamic system|system]] always increases for irreversible processes. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may ''not'' flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.\n\nAccording to the [[Clausius theorem|Clausius equality]], for a reversible cyclic process:\n<math>\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T} = 0.</math>\nThis means the line integral <math>\\int_L \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}</math> is [[State function|path-independent]].\n\nSo we can define a state function {{mvar|S}} called entropy, which satisfies\n<math>d S = \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}.</math>\n\nTo find the entropy difference between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Atkins|first=Peter|author2=Julio De Paula|title=Physical Chemistry, 8th ed.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=79|isbn=978-0-19-870072-2}}</ref> Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Engel|first=Thomas|author2=Philip Reid|title=Physical Chemistry|publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings|year=2006|page=86|isbn=978-0-8053-3842-3}}</ref> However, the entropy change of the surroundings is different.\n\nWe can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the [[third law of thermodynamics]], which states that ''S'' = 0 at [[absolute zero]] for perfect crystals.\n\nFrom a macroscopic perspective, in [[classical thermodynamics]] the entropy is interpreted as a [[state function]] of a [[thermodynamic system]]: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy \u0394''E'', and its entropy falls by \u0394''S'', a quantity at least ''T''<sub>R</sub> \u0394''S'' of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (''T''<sub>R</sub> is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\n=== Statistical mechanics ===\nThe statistical definition was developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor\u2014known as [[Boltzmann's constant]]. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\n\nThe [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics]] is the measure of uncertainty, or ''mixedupness'' in the phrase of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]], which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. In contrast to  the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder).<ref name=McH>{{cite book|last1=Licker|first1=Mark D.|title=McGraw-Hill concise encyclopedia of chemistry.|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-143953-4}}</ref><ref name=\"Sethna78\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=John O.E.|title=The essential dictionary of science|date=2004|publisher=Barnes & Noble|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}</ref> This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system ([[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that could cause the observed macroscopic state ([[macrostate]]) of the system.

This density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates. For most practical purposes, this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for ''S'' can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa.\n\nIn what has been called ''the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics'' or ''[[Fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics|the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics]]'', the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable (i.e. ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1/\u03a9, where \u03a9 is the number of microstates); this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schroeder|first1=Daniel V.|title=An introduction to thermal physics|date=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=978-0-201-38027-9|page=57|edition=}}</ref> Then the previous equation reduces to\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\log \\Omega.</math>\n\nIn thermodynamics, such a system is one in which the volume, number of molecules, and internal energy are fixed (the [[microcanonical ensemble]]).\n\nThe most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system. The [[equilibrium state]] of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.cornell.edu/sethna/StatMech/EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf |title=EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf www.physics.cornell.edu |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.\n\nThe interpretative model has a central role in determining entropy. The qualifier \"for a given set of macroscopic variables\" above has deep implications: if two observers use different sets of macroscopic variables, they see different entropies. For example, if observer A uses the variables ''U'', ''V'' and ''W'', and observer B uses ''U'', ''V'', ''W'', ''X'', then, by changing ''X'', observer B can cause an effect that looks like a violation of the second law of thermodynamics to observer A.

It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\n\nIn a [[thermodynamic system]], pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the [[equilibrium state]] has higher [[probability]] (more possible [[combination]]s of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) than any other state.\n\nAs an example, for a glass of [[ice]] water in air at [[room temperature]], the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the [[thermal energy]] from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\n\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an [[isolated system]] such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the [[thermodynamic system]] is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\n\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved [[state function]] that is of great importance in the sciences of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].<ref name=\"McH\" /><ref name=\"Wiley91\">{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley I.|title=Chemical, biochemical, and engineering thermodynamics|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-66174-0|page=91|edition=4th}}</ref> Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their [[T-symmetry|time reversals]] (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy.<ref name=\"McQuarrie817\">{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Donald A.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that a closed system has entropy that may increase or otherwise remain constant. Chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and entropy plays an important role in determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds.\n\nOne dictionary definition of entropy is that it is \"a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work\". For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine.  A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.\n\nA special case of entropy increase, the [[entropy of mixing]], occurs when two or more different substances are mixed. If the substances are at the same temperature and pressure, there is no net exchange of heat or work \u2013 the entropy change is entirely due to the mixing of the different substances.

Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. Secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing [[adiabatic cooling]], which performs [[adiabatic process|adiabatic work]]. As a result, there is no possibility of a [[perpetual motion]] system. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a [[chemical reaction]], means that it is energetically more efficient.\n\nIt follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. An [[air conditioner]], for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] places limits on a system's ability to do [[work (thermodynamics)|useful work]].<ref name=\"Daintith\">{{Cite book|last=Daintith| first=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of Physics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-280628-4}}</ref> The entropy change of a system at temperature ''T'' absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat ''\u03b4q''\nin a reversible way, is given by ''\u03b4q''/''T''.

In the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy ''U'' to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. This relation is known as the ''fundamental thermodynamic relation''. If external pressure ''p'' bears on the volume ''V'' as the only external parameter, this relation is:\n\n: <math>dU = T \\, dS - p \\, dV</math>\n\nSince both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature ''T'', implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the entropy, pressure and temperature may not exist).\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the [[Maxwell relations]] and the [[relations between heat capacities]].\n\n=== Entropy in chemical thermodynamics ===\nThermodynamic entropy is central in [[chemical thermodynamics]], enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that entropy in an [[isolated system]] \u2013 the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings \u2013 increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. The Clausius equation of \u03b4''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' = \u0394''S'' introduces the measurement of entropy change, \u0394''S''. Entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems \u2013 always from hotter to cooler spontaneously.\n\nThe thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit [[joule]] per [[kelvin]] (J/K) in the International System of Units (SI).\n\nThermodynamic entropy is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the [[kilogram]] (unit: J\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>). Alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of substance, in which case it is called the ''molar entropy'' with a unit of J\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThus, when one mole of substance at about {{val|0|u=K}} is warmed by its surroundings to {{val|298|u=K}}, the sum of the incremental values of ''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' constitute each element's or compound's standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at {{val|298|u=K}}.<ref name=\"ctms\">{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=J.

Thus, damage is interpreted as a fundamental property (and obligation) of moving and deformable systems.\n\nThe complex (\u03a3) of irreversible damage (\u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub>) is determined by the effective (absorbed in the system) energy (''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup>), caused by forces of any nature:\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(U_\\Sigma^\\mathit{eff}) = \\omega_\\Sigma \\left(U_n^\\mathit{eff}, U_\\tau^\\mathit{eff}, U_T^\\mathit{eff}, U_{ch}^\\mathit{eff}, \\ldots, U_0, t \\right) = \\omega_{\\Sigma U} \\ge 0</math>\n\nHere, the indices ''n'' and \u03c4 indicate normal and shear mechanical loads, ''T'' and ''Ch'' indicate thermal and electrochemical loads that generate the corresponding energy fluxes.\n\nThus, damage \u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub> is an energy thermomechanical function, since it takes into account both any force factors and temperature ''T''<sub>\u03a3</sub>. This means that tribo-fatigue entropy is a measure of the absorption of energy caused by all sources. Determination procedures of ''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup> have been developed (see, for example.<ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L. A 2005\"/><ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L.

A 2007\"/> which states: the development of irreversible damage processes is possible and is realized with a certain probability ''\u0420''>0, when a finite region ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub> with a nonzero level of effective energy ''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup>>0 (internal entropy ''S''<sub>''i''</sub>>0) arises in the object \u2013 a dangerous volume\n\n<math>V_{P\\gamma} \\in V_{P\\gamma} \\left(Q_i, U_\\Sigma^\\mathit{eff}, S_i\\right) \\ge 0,</math>\n\nwhere ''Q''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2013 are internal force factors.\n\nIf ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>=0, then \u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub>=0 and, therefore, the evolution of an object by damage is impossi-ble (reversible system). In an irreversible system ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>\u2264''V'' there is an absolute value (measure) of its spatial damage (''V'' is its geometric volume). Calculation methods and classification of dangerous volumes (''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>) for typical material objects (deformable solids and systems) under various conditions have been developed (see, for example <ref name=\"Sherbakov, S. S 2010\"/>). The scale of system damage can be any.\n\nUsing the concept of tribo-fatigue entropy, one can give an entropic interpretation of damage: irreversible damage to an object is identical to a change in internal entropy in its dangerous volume\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(S_{TF}) \\equiv \\frac{(d_i S)_{TF}}{dV_{P\\gamma}} = \\omega_{\\Sigma S}.</math>\n\nAn open thermodynamic system in which damaged or solid objects are distributed (scattered) are called a mechanothermodynamic system (MTD).

According to him, it is the growth of tribo-fatigue entropy, due to the thermomechanical state of the system, that can lead to both destruction and decomposition of moving and deformable objects and systems; in thermodynamic equations such states are out of the question. This equation is constructed taking into account various mechanisms of interaction (\u039b<sub>''ij''</sub>, \u039b<sub>''TD/TF''</sub>) between the components of entropy.\n\nWe also note that the \u039b-functions defined here at the macro level turn out to be quite similar to the non-additivity parameters in the q-calculus [91], on the basis of which, for example, the statistical theory of non-additive systems at the nanoscale has been developed [92]. This indicates the fundamental nature of modern concepts of non-additive systems. The mechanothermodynamic system can be considered, therefore, as one of them.\n\nThus, it follows from the foregoing that the evolution of the system in the general case is determined by the intensity of the processes of irreversible changes in entropy \u2013 thermodynamic and tribo-fatigue; the production of internal mechanothermodynamic entropy is as eternal as motion and damage.\n\n=== Thermodynamic and statistical mechanics concepts ===\n<!-- Note: renamed from \"definitions\" as these are not differing definitions of entropy \u2013 they are various concepts which are related to or use the concept of entropy; some may define a particular way of determining entropy in some specific circumstance -->\n* Entropy unit \u2013 a non-S.I. unit of thermodynamic entropy, usually denoted \"e.u.\" and equal to one [[calorie]] per kelvin per mole, or 4.184 [[joule]]s per kelvin per mole.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=E02151|title=Entropy unit}}</ref>\n* [[Gibbs entropy]] \u2013 the usual statistical mechanical entropy of a thermodynamic system.\n* [[Boltzmann entropy]] \u2013 a type of Gibbs entropy, which neglects internal statistical correlations in the overall particle distribution.\n* [[Tsallis entropy]] \u2013 a generalization of the standard Boltzmann\u2013Gibbs entropy.\n* [[Standard molar entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy content of one mole of substance, under conditions of standard temperature and pressure.\n* [[Residual entropy]] \u2013 the entropy present after a substance is cooled arbitrarily close to [[absolute zero]].\n* [[Entropy of mixing]] \u2013 the change in the entropy when two different [[chemical substance]]s or [[component (thermodynamics)|components]] are mixed.\n* [[Loop entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy lost upon bringing together two residues of a polymer within a prescribed distance.\n* [[Conformational entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy associated with the physical arrangement of a [[polymer]] chain that assumes a compact or [[globular protein|globular]] state in solution.\n* [[Entropic force]] \u2013 a microscopic force or reaction tendency related to system organization changes, molecular frictional considerations, and statistical variations.\n* [[Free entropy]] \u2013 an entropic thermodynamic potential analogous to the free energy.\n* [[Entropic explosion]] \u2013  an explosion in which the reactants undergo a large change in volume without releasing a large amount of heat.\n* Entropy change \u2013 a change in entropy ''dS'' between two [[equilibrium state]]s is given by the heat transferred ''dQ''<sub>rev</sub> divided by the [[absolute temperature]] ''T'' of the [[thermodynamic system|system]] in this interval.\n* [[Sackur\u2013Tetrode equation|Sackur\u2013Tetrode entropy]] \u2013 the entropy of a monatomic classical ideal gas determined via quantum considerations.\n\n=== The arrow of time ===\n{{Main|Entropy (arrow of time)}}\nEntropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an [[arrow of time]]. As time progresses, the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an [[isolated system]] never decreases in large systems over significant periods of time. Hence, from this perspective, entropy measurement is thought of as a clock in these conditions.\n\n===Entropy in DNA sequences===\n\nEntropy has been proven useful in the analysis of DNA sequences.

It has been speculated, since the 19th century, that the universe is fated to a [[heat death of the universe|heat death]] in which all the [[energy]] ends up as a homogeneous distribution of thermal energy so that no more work can be extracted from any source.\n\nIf the universe can be considered to have generally increasing entropy, then \u2013 as [[Roger Penrose]] has pointed out \u2013 [[gravity]] plays an important role in the increase because gravity causes dispersed matter to accumulate into stars, which collapse eventually into [[black hole]]s.

James Walsh, the owner of Darwen FC and the associated mill decides to secretly pay two Scottish players, [[Fergus Suter|Fergus \"Fergie\" Suter]] and James \"Jimmy\" Love to join his team in a bid to secure the FA Cup (which at the time is exclusively for amateurs). At halftime the Old Etonians lead 5-1, however Darwen recover with a progressive adjustment (spreading out their formation and focusing on passing) to draw 5 all. The Old Etonians, who also happen to be FA Board members, decide that since [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]] was not previously agreed to then the Quarterfinal will be replayed instead. The mill has financial issues and townsfolk pitch in to help pay for the trip. The replay is handily won by Old Etonians who focus more on shutting down Suter and Love rather than playing their own game.

Stokes, a team member, goes to Kinnaird\u2019s bank to ask for a loan. Some Darwen mill workers talk about strike as a result of a prior 5 per cent wage cut. The Cotton Guild imposes another 10 per cent wage cut. Darwen workers walk out. The team refuses to train or play in matches while on strike. Suter fails to convince Walsh to go against the guild. Workers go to the guild to demand a 5 per cent wage cut and fewer hours to help fight the oversupply that has caused the price of goods to fall. The guild refuses. Workers riot. Kinnaird is saved from the riot by Stokes. Against Kinnaird\u2019s wishes, Stokes goes in his place to warn Colonel Jackson (the guild leader) that the mob is coming for him. Police show up and arrest Stokes and kill his dog. Stokes is put on trial and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Kinnaird testifies on behalf of Stokes and saves him from prison and gives him his loan. Walsh agrees to the 5 per cent wage cut and to work five days a week if the team plays their upcoming match. While waiting on the team at the match, Suter is approached by the manager of Blackburn FC and is offered \u00a3100 upfront and a \u00a36 weekly wage increase. Suter turns him down as the team arrive to play. \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Episode 3\n |DirectedBy      = Birgitte St\u00e6rmose\n |WrittenBy       = Julian Fellowes & Gabbie Asher\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Suter goes home to Glasgow to visit his poor family and drunken, abusive father who tries to shame Suter for being paid to play. Kinnaird and his wife continue to mourn the loss of her pregnancy six months earlier. Once back in Lancashire, Suter meets with Cartwright, the Blackburn FC manager and accepts his offer but needs a few days to make it right with Jimmy, Walsh and the Darwen team. After practice with the Etonians, teammates talk about the \u201cepidemic\u201d of working-class teams joining the Football Association. While the gentleman scoff at the conditions of the working poor, Kinnaird comes to their defence. The Darwen team are out celebrating Jimmy\u2019s [[stag party]]. Mr. Walsh tells Suter that he\u2019s proud of his decision to bring Suter on to the team. Suter thanks him but doesn\u2019t mention the deal with Blackburn. Clearly drunk, Suter gets in a fight with another Blackburn player recently hired from Partick when he compares Suter to his drunken father. The following day, at the match between Darwen and St Luke\u2019s, Suter arrives late and plays terribly. Darwen lose 3-0 and are out of the FA Cup. Suter storms off the pitch. At home, Suter tells Doris about the deal with Blackburn and says that he will tell Jimmy after the wedding. Jimmy practises his vows and Doris overhears. At the wedding, Jimmy tells all that he finally feels like he has a home in Darwen. As Suter begins his best man\u2019s speech, he is interrupted by a teammate who reads a Blackburn ad about Suter joining the team, shocking everyone. \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = Episode 4\n |DirectedBy      = [[Tim Fywell]]\n |WrittenBy       = Julian Fellowes & Sam Hoare\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = At the Darwen mill, Walsh shames Suter for his choice to leave. Suter tries to convince Jimmy to come with him. Jimmy refuses, saying that Darwen is his team and his family now. Cartwright shows Suter the new facilities and stands. He shows off new teammates, including Jack Hunter from Sheffield, and tells Suter he is assembling a team of the best players north of Eton. Cartwright asks Walsh for his discretion regarding Suter\u2019s professionalism and offers him \u00a3100 for Blackburn to play Darwen the next week in an exhibition match. After being seen talking familiarly with Mr Cartwright (with whom she previously had a child), Martha is fired from her job at the Cotton Master\u2019s club. Mr Cartwright offers her money to help but Martha refuses, saying she needs to find her own way. At the Blackburn v Druids match, Suter struggles to mesh with his new teammates. Hunter is hailed the hero. Suter talks with Jimmy, who calls him a Judas. Suter tells Jimmy that he is trying to get his family away from his father. Suter again asks Jimmy to join Blackburn. Later, Jimmy stands up for Suter against the Darwen team and tells them he is joining Blackburn. On the way to the match between the Old Etonians and Preston, the Etonians discuss how football is becoming a booming business and is no longer just a game. The FA President complains that if it continues, only the richest teams will win and is planning to watch the exhibition match between Darwen and Blackburn to find evidence to expel them from the FA cup. The match between Darwen and Blackburn is rough and Jimmy\u2019s leg is badly broken by a tackle and the blood loss threatens both his life and his leg. |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Episode 5\n |DirectedBy      = Tim Fywell\n |WrittenBy       = Julian Fellowes & Geoff Bussetil\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Jimmy is told he\u2019ll never play football again. Cartwright tells the Blackburn team that a portion of the match proceeds will go to help Jimmy\u2019s recovery. Cartwright asks Suter how Martha and her daughter are doing after her job loss. After  Cartwright tells his wife about the affair, she goes to Martha\u2019s house and offers to care for her daughter, Jenie. Martha refuses. Martha tells Suter about Cartwright and Jenie. Martha goes back to talk with Mrs Cartwright and apologises for the affair with her husband. Suter and Martha kiss. Tommy, the player who hurt Jimmy, visits and to apologise. Suter arrives and tells Jimmy the team will support him financially and they are struggling to replace him. Later, Suter pushes Jimmy in a cart to the pub to cheer him up. Darwen teammates start to reconcile with Suter. Stokes talks about his business success making football kits. Doris asks after a job for Jimmy. Kinnaird has a falling out with his friend over the true reason behind missing the quarter-final match. After some tense discussions with his father about his football career, Kinnaird uses his football contacts to help save a vital investment. Kinnaird debates the merits of paying players with the Etonians. The Lancashire teams band together to beat the elite teams. Mr. Walsh persuades Tommy to join Blackburn to replace Jimmy. Cartwright offers Suter the captainship (and a bonus) if they make it to the final. Mrs Cartwright offers Martha a job at Brockshall and says she can bring Jenie. Two days later the FA Board meets without Kinnaird and discuss expelling Darwen and Blackburn from the cup. \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = Episode 6\n |DirectedBy      = Tim Fywell\n |WrittenBy       = Julian Fellowes & Ben Vanstone\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = The FA Board votes to expel Blackburn. Kinnaird is furious. Later Kinnaird has it out with his friends about their betrayal.\nWalsh, now the head of the Lancashire FA holds a meeting to figure out how to fight the ban. Suter offers to talk to Kinnaird. Walsh gives Suter a new suit so that he will fit in with the elite. Suter discusses the merits of professional players. Suter argues that the elites banning of professionals is not fair because they are not working all day to put food on the table. They both agree they play for the love of the game. At the Board meeting. Suter argues in favour of letting Blackburn play. The Board stands by their decision to ban Blackburn from the cup. Walsh tells him the Lancashire FA and most other county FAs will withdraw from the FA cup and form a new association. Kinnaird would be the new president. Kinnaird argues that the working-class teams will overwhelm the elite teams unless they include the working class. Kinnaird convinces the Board to let Blackburn play. At the match, the 1883 FA Club Final, the Etonians are playing well but in a very physical way. The score is 0-0 at half-time. One of the Etonian players is injured but they agree to keep playing anyway. Suter scores with a header from Tommy\u2019s pass. In the last moments of the match, Kinnaird scores on a breakaway. The teams agree to extra time. Suter sits out a player to make the match fair and gives the players a rousing pep talk. Suter scores the winning goal. Suter lifts the cup to overwhelming cheers. In 1885, the FA officially allows professional players and an amateur team never wins the cup again.

Cartwright asks Walsh for his discretion regarding Suter\u2019s professionalism and offers him \u00a3100 for Blackburn to play Darwen the next week in an exhibition match. After being seen talking familiarly with Mr Cartwright (with whom she previously had a child), Martha is fired from her job at the Cotton Master\u2019s club.

Hunter is hailed the hero. Suter talks with Jimmy, who calls him a Judas. Suter tells Jimmy that he is trying to get his family away from his father. Suter again asks Jimmy to join Blackburn. Later, Jimmy stands up for Suter against the Darwen team and tells them he is joining Blackburn. On the way to the match between the Old Etonians and Preston, the Etonians discuss how football is becoming a booming business and is no longer just a game.

Martha goes back to talk with Mrs Cartwright and apologises for the affair with her husband. Suter and Martha kiss. Tommy, the player who hurt Jimmy, visits and to apologise.

Suter offers to talk to Kinnaird. Walsh gives Suter a new suit so that he will fit in with the elite. Suter discusses the merits of professional players. Suter argues that the elites banning of professionals is not fair because they are not working all day to put food on the table. They both agree they play for the love of the game. At the Board meeting. Suter argues in favour of letting Blackburn play. The Board stands by their decision to ban Blackburn from the cup. Walsh tells him the Lancashire FA and most other county FAs will withdraw from the FA cup and form a new association. Kinnaird would be the new president. Kinnaird argues that the working-class teams will overwhelm the elite teams unless they include the working class. Kinnaird convinces the Board to let Blackburn play. At the match, the 1883 FA Club Final, the Etonians are playing well but in a very physical way. The score is 0-0 at half-time. One of the Etonian players is injured but they agree to keep playing anyway. Suter scores with a header from Tommy\u2019s pass. In the last moments of the match, Kinnaird scores on a breakaway. The teams agree to extra time. Suter sits out a player to make the match fair and gives the players a rousing pep talk. Suter scores the winning goal. Suter lifts the cup to overwhelming cheers.

The company originally became known for its classic analog medium format cameras that used a waist level viewfinder. Perhaps the most famous use of the Hasselblad camera was during the [[Apollo program]] missions when the first humans [[Moon landing|landed on the Moon]]. Almost all of the still photographs taken during these missions used modified Hasselblad cameras. In 2016, Hasselblad introduced the world's first digital compact mirrorless medium format camera, the X1D-50c, changing the portability of medium format photography. Hasselblad only produces about 10,000 cameras a year out of a small three story building.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Savov|first1=Vlad|title=This is how the world's most covetable cameras get made|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16977522/hasselblad-camera-factory-tour|access-date=6 February 2018|work=[[The Verge]]|date=6 February 2018}}</ref>[[File:Hasselbladnew.jpg|thumb|Former Hasselblad headquarters built in 2003 (now occupied by [[Sveriges Television|Sveriges Television AB]])]]\n\n== Company history ==\n\nThe company was established in 1841 in Gothenburg, Sweden, by Fritz Wiktor Hasselblad, as a trading company, F. W. Hasselblad and Co. The founder's son, Arvid Viktor Hasselblad, was interested in photography and started the photographic division of the company. Hasselblad's corporate website quotes him as saying, \"I certainly don't think that we will earn much money on this, but at least it will allow us to take pictures for free.\"<ref name=\"Hasselblad history \u2013 Hasselblad\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hasselblad.com/inspiration/our-story/hasselblad-history|title=Hasselblad history \u2013 Hasselblad|website=www.hasselblad.com|access-date=2016-04-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1877, Arvid Hasselblad commissioned the construction of Hasselblad's long-time headquarters building, in use until 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.photo90.it/storia_della_hasselblad.htm|title=Storia della Hasselblad|author=|date=|website=www.photo90.it}}</ref> While on honeymoon, Arvid Hasselblad met [[George Eastman]], founder of [[Eastman Kodak]]. In 1888, Hasselblad became the sole Swedish distributor of Eastman's products. The business was so successful that in 1908, the photographic operations were spun off into their own corporation, Fotografiska AB. Operations included a nationwide network of shops and photo labs. Management of the company eventually passed to Karl Erik Hasselblad, Arvid's son (grandson of founder F. W.). Karl Erik wanted his son, [[Victor Hasselblad]], to have a wide understanding of the camera business, and sent him to [[Dresden]], Germany, then the world center of the optics industry, at age 18 (c. 1924).\n\nVictor spent the next several years studying and working in various photography related endeavors in Europe and the US, including [[Rochester, New York]], with George Eastman, before returning to work at the family business. Due to disputes within the family, particularly with his father, Victor left the business and in 1937 started his own photo store and lab in Gothenburg, Victor Foto.\n\n===World War II===\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the Swedish military captured a fully functioning German aerial surveillance camera from a downed German plane. This was probably a Handkammer HK 12.5&nbsp;cm/7x9, which bore the codename GXN and the military account number Fl.38510.\n\nThe Swedish government realised the strategic advantage of developing an aerial camera for their own use, and in the spring of 1940 approached Victor Hasselblad to help create one. In April 1940, Victor Hasselblad established a camera workshop in Gothenburg called Ross AB in a shed at an automobile shop, working in the evenings in cooperation with a mechanic from the shop and his brother, and began designing the HK7 camera.\n\nBy late 1941, the operation had over 20 employees and the Swedish Air Force asked for another camera, one which would have a larger negative and could be permanently mounted to an aircraft. This model was the SKa4. Between 1941 and 1945, Hasselblad delivered 342 cameras to the Swedish military.<ref name=\"Hasselblad history \u2013 Hasselblad\"/>\n\nIn 1942, Karl Erik Hasselblad died and Victor took control of the family business. During the war, in addition to the military cameras, Hasselblad produced watch and clock parts, over 95,000 by the war's end.\n\n===Post-war===\nAfter the war, watch and clock production continued, and other machine work was also carried out, including producing a [[slide projector]] and supplying parts for [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] automobiles.\n\nVictor Hasselblad's real ambition was to make high-quality civilian cameras. In 1945\u20131946, the first design drawings and wooden models were made for a camera to be called the Rossex. An internal design competition was held for elements of the camera; one of the winners was [[Sixten Sason]], the designer of the original [[Ursaab|Saab bodywork]].\n\nIn 1948, the camera later known as the 1600 F was released. The new design was complex, and many small improvements were needed to create a reliable product; the watchmaking background of many of the designers produced a design which was sophisticated, but more delicate than what was required for a camera. Only around 50 units were produced in 1949, and perhaps 220 in 1950, of what collectors have now designated the Series One camera. The Series Two versions of the 1600 F, perhaps as many as 3300 made from 1950 to 1953, were more reliable but still subject to frequent repairs, with many units having been cannibalized or modified by the factory. The biggest problem was its shutter, a focal-plane shutter that was hard to keep accurate. Using 120 size film it was formatted to a square 6&nbsp;cm \u00d7 6&nbsp;cm or {{frac|2|1|4}} \u00d7 {{frac|2|1|4}} inches, which meant there was no more need to turn the camera on its side.\n\nIn 1954, they mated the groundbreaking new 38mm Biogon lens designed by Dr. Bertele of Zeiss to a shallow non-reflex body to produce the SWA (Supreme Wide Angle, later changed to Super Wide Angle). Though a specialty product not intended to sell in large numbers, the SWA was an impressive achievement, and derivatives were sold for decades. Hasselblad took their two products to the [[photokina 1954|1954 photokina]] trade show in Germany, and word began to spread.\n\nIn 1953, a much-improved camera, the 1000 F was released. It too had a focal-plane shutter which led to its final replacement by the 500 C but nonetheless provided a big leg up in the medium format. It had a very fine 200mm f4 Sonnar sport lens that made it a great wildlife camera. Lenses ranged from a 60mm Distagon, standard 80mm Planar, and on up to the 200&nbsp;mm.\n\nIn December 1954, the 1000 F camera received a rave review from the influential American photography magazine, ''[[Modern Photography]]''. They put over 500 rolls of film through their test unit, and intentionally dropped it twice, and it continued to function. But the 1000 F also had shutter problems and finally gave way to the lens-mounted, tried-and-true Compur shutter, retaining its focal-plane shutter/curtain only to mask the film until the Compur shutter closed, then opened to expose the film. This was a far more dependable system, even though it meant having a shutter in each lens.\n\n=== The Hasselblad camera comes into its own ===\nThe real turning point for the company occurred in 1957. The 1000 F was replaced by the 500 C. The landmark 500 C design formed the basis for Hasselblad's product line for the next sixty years, with variants being produced until 2013. It was not until 1960, though, that Hasselblad's cameras became profitable; prior to this point, the company was still being entirely supported by sales of imported photographic supplies, including their distribution of Kodak products.\n\nIn 1962, [[NASA]] began to use Hasselblad cameras on space flights, and to request design modifications. The first motor-driven camera, the 500 EL, appeared in 1965<ref>Wildi 2000</ref> as a result of NASA requests. While Hasselblad had enjoyed a slowly but steadily growing reputation among professional photographers through the 1950s, the publicity created by NASA's use of Hasselblad products dramatically increased name recognition for the brand.\n\nIn 1966, with the increasing success of the camera division, Hasselblad exited the photographic supply and retailing industry, selling Hasselblad Fotografiska AB to Kodak.\n\n=== 1970s onward ===\nIn 1976, Victor Hasselblad sold Hasselblad AB to a Swedish investment company, S\u00e4fve\u00e5n AB. When he died in 1978, he left much of his fortune to the Hasselblad Foundation.\n\nIn 1977, the 2000 series of [[focal plane shutter]] equipped models was introduced. The 2000-series cameras had been intended to provide full exposure automation. The 2000 FC however was rushed and introduced without the automated features, partly because of a rethink about the way the automation should be accomplished (electronic vs. electro-mechanical). It was the last new camera produced during Victor Hasselblad's lifetime.\n\nIn 1984, Victor Hasselblad AB went public, with 42.5% of the company being sold on the Swedish stock exchange. The next year, Swedish corporation Incentive AB bought 58.1% of Hasselblad, and in 1991, they acquired the remainder of the shares, taking VHAB back to being a private corporation.\n\nIn 1985 Hasselblad established the subsidiary, Hasselblad Electronic Imaging AB, to focus on digital imaging and transmission systems.<ref>Hasselblad 2007</ref>\n\nIn 1991, the 200 series of automated [[focal plane shutter]] equipped models was introduced. This was the last major technical development in the course of the classic (now known as \"V-System\", after Victor) Hasselblad camera.\n\nIn 1996, Hasselblad was sold, with the new owners being [[UBS AG|UBS]], [[Cinven]], and the Hasselblad management.\n\n=== Fuji, Shriro, Imacon, and the digital age ===\nIn 1998, Hasselblad began selling the XPan, a camera designed and made in Japan by [[Fujifilm]].\n\nIn 2002, they introduced the H-System, retroactively renaming their original camera line the V-System. The H-System marked an essential transition for the company. It dropped the traditional Hasselblad square negative format, instead using 6\u00d74.5&nbsp;cm film and a new series of lenses. The then owners had no confidence in Hasselblad's already advanced digital project returning a profit, and, seeing the relative success in the market of the modern (i.e. fully automated) 645 cameras made by manufacturers like Pentax and Mamiya, closed down Hasselblad's digital department and directed all effort towards making this 645 film camera. The H-System is largely designed and manufactured by Hasselblad, with Fuji's involvement being limited to finalizing Hasselblad's lens designs and producing the glass for the lenses and viewfinders. Fuji was allowed under the agreement to sell the H1 under their name in Japan only.\n\nIn January 2003, the [[Shriro Group]] acquired a majority shareholding in Hasselblad. The group had been the distributors for Hasselblad in Japan, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan ROC, Singapore, and Malaysia for over 45 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shriro.com/hasselblad.html |title=Hasselblad |access-date=2007-10-12 |publisher=Shriro Group |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031091846/http://www.shriro.com/hasselblad.html |archive-date=2007-10-31 }}</ref>\n\nThe following year, in August 2004, Shriro Sweden, the holding company of Victor Hasselblad AB, and Swedish subsidiary of Shriro Group, announced the acquisition of high-end scanner and digital cameraback manufacturer, Imacon. The intent of the move was to correct the mistake the previous owners made when they thought there was no money to be made selling digital products and put a stop to Hasselblad's own advanced digital project, and to renew Hasselblad's ambitions in the professional digital photographic sector.<ref name='DPR 2004'>{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Hasselblad and Imacon merge | date=2004-08-17 | publisher=Digital Photography Review | url =http://www.dpreview.com/news/0408/04081701hasselbladimacon.asp | work =Digital Photography Review | pages = | access-date = 2007-10-09 | language = }}</ref>\n\nThe move was perceived as part of an industry-wide move to respond to the trend away from film to digital.

For example, development of a 70&nbsp;mm magazine was accelerated to meet the space program.\n\nThe first modified (in fact simplified) Hasselblad 500 C cameras were used on the last two [[Project Mercury]] missions in 1962 and 1963. They continued to be used throughout the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] spaceflights in 1965 and 1966.\n\n=== Apollo program ===\n\nA general program of reliability and safety was implemented following the [[Apollo 1]] fire in 1967, addressing such issues as reliability and safe operation of electrical equipment in a high-oxygen environment.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Photography Equipment and Techniques: A Survey of NASA Developments|journal=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|date=2001-02-01|first=Albert J|last=Derr|volume=NASA SP-5099|issue=|pages=|id= |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/apollo.photechnqs.htm|format=PDF|access-date=2007-10-06 }}</ref>\n\nEL electric cameras were used for the first time on [[Apollo 8]].

An even more extensively modified Hasselblad EL Data Camera (HDC), equipped with a special Zeiss 5.6/60&nbsp;mm Biogon lens and film magazines for 150\u2013200 exposures, was used on the Moon surface on the Apollo 11 mission. This command module camera, carried on Apollo 11, was a simplified version of the commercial Hasselblad 500 EL motorized film advance camera.

Born from the idea of Victor Hasselblad to create the \"ideal camera\", it was a 6\u00d76&nbsp;cm format focal-plane shutter SLR camera that was six inches long.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|last1=Gustavson|first1=Todd|title=Camera A history of photography from Daguerreotype to Digital|date=2009|publisher=Sterling Signature|isbn=978-1-4027-5656-6}}</ref> First simply known as the \"Hasselblad Camera\" it was later named \"1600F\" after its highest shutter speed of 1/1600 sec and \"F\" for \"focal plane\".<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The camera was revolutionary for the time with its modular design that allowed exchanging lenses, viewfinders and film magazines. The shutter was made of thin stainless steel which was light and durable enough to withstand the high acceleration forces of this fast shutter.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nThe 1600F cameras did show a couple of problems (especially the first series) so a number of changes were introduced during the production period that lasted from 1949\u20131953. The 1600F was initially released with the [[Kodak]] [[Ektar]] 2.8/80&nbsp;mm and the Ektar 3.5/135&nbsp;mm lenses. Only prototypes were made of the Ektar 6.3/55&nbsp;mm and the 5.6/254&nbsp;mm lenses.\n\nThe successor of the 1600F was the 1000F (1953\u20131957). The 1000F was named after its reduced shortest shutter speed of 1/1000 s. The 1000F has a different shutter mechanism and proved to be more reliable and robust than its predecessor. During production of the 1600F, Carl Zeiss in [[Oberkochen]] had become a supplier of lenses for the 1600F/1000F cameras. Zeiss supplied the lenses [[Distagon]] 5.6/60&nbsp;mm, [[Tessar]] 2.8/80&nbsp;mm, [[Sonnar]] 3.5/135, Sonnar 4.0/250 and Sonnar 5.6/250&nbsp;mm. Towards the end of the 1000 F production period a [[Thomas Rudolphus Dallmeyer|Dallmeyer]] 5.6/508&nbsp;mm lens made by [[Cook and Perkins]], England, was also available, but did not fully cover the full film format.\n\nHasselblad 1000F and especially 1600F cameras are very rare on the secondhand market and usually not in working condition because of age, neglect, and a lack of spare parts and qualified repairmen. Many cameras suffer from corrosion of the chrome rims. A lot of lenses suffer from scratches, fungus, discoloration and separation. Cameras in good condition can therefore fetch fairly high prices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collectiblend.com/Cameras/Hasselblad/|title=Hasselblad Price Guide|publisher=CollectiBlend}}</ref>\n\nThe 500C was produced to replace the F-series cameras. It changed the troublesome focal plane shutter for a leaf shutter in each C lens. The camera has continued for over 40 years with only minor improvements. A variation of the 500C was used by [[NASA]] for all their [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions. Most lenses were made by [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] in [[Germany]] but the very early 1600F lenses were made by [[Kodak]].\n* 1600F (1948/1949\u20131953, 1/1600 s shutter speed)\n* 1000F (1953\u20131957, 1/1000 s shutter speed)\n\n====V System====\n[[File:Hasselblad 503CW V96C.jpg|thumb|right|Hasselblad 503 CW with [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] Distagon 3,5/30 and Ixpress V96C]]\n[[File:Hasselblad 500 CM.jpg|thumb|right|Hasselblad 500 C/M with [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] lens]]\n'''The designation 'V System' was not used until the launch of the H System.''' The name \"V System\" was not created until the development of the \"H System\"; with a new system premiering, Hasselblad needed a designation to differentiate the older product line.\nThe Hasselblad V-System evolved out of Victor Hasselblad's desire to develop a small camera with fast lenses and shutters, that was as easily hand-holdable as a [[Leica Camera|Leica]], but with a larger film format. The [[Rolleiflex]]'s 6\u00d76 format was deemed ideal: large enough to provide high image quality, but small enough to fit inside a compact camera. The Rolleiflex's leaf shutter lacked the fast shutter speeds focal plane shutters could provide, and neither Leica rangefinder nor Rolleiflex TLR provided the(TTL) through the (taking) lens viewing that the slow to use, big Graflex SLR provided.\nThese considerations led to the 1600 F and a flexible camera system that includes interchangeable bodies, lenses, viewfinders, winders, film magazines and holders, and other accessories. Problems with the focal plane shutters in the 1600 F and 1000 F cameras and especially the increasing importance of electronic flash led to the development of the manual leaf shutter-based medium-format 6\u00d76 (6\u00d76&nbsp;cm or 2\u00bc\u00d72\u00bc inches) 500 C SLR camera in 1957 which offered flash synchronization at all shutter speeds. The 500 C was joined by the motor-driven 500 EL SLR camera in 1964. Apart from the housing that incorporates the motor drive and the NiCd batteries, this camera is similar in appearance and operation to the Hasselblad 500 C and uses the same magazines, lenses and viewfinders. These two cameras, together with the Superwide Camera (SWC) which was introduced in 1954 as a wide angle camera using the Carl Zeiss Biogon 38&nbsp;mm f/4.5 lens and built-in levels for exacting architecture photography, formed the core of the V-system and shared most accessories (with a few exceptions).\n\nThroughout the life of the V Series, Hasselblad incrementally updated the cameras. The 500C gave way to the 500C/M, the 503CX and 503CXi, the 501C and 501CM, and finally the 503CW as the basic manual. The SWC was replaced by the SWC/M, the 903 SWC, and finally by the 905 SWC. The 500 EL's replacements included the 500EL/M, 500ELX,553 ELX, and the 555ELD. First introduced in the 500ELX, TTL/OTF (through the lens/off the film) flash metering was also a feature of the 503CX, which was replaced by the 503CXi and finally the 503CW.\nAlongside these 500-series cameras, a series of focal plane shutter cameras was introduced. They marked the return to Victor Hasselblad's original desire to have a small camera with fast shutter speeds (1/2000 s) and fast lenses. This 2000-series started with the 2000 FC, and progressed to the 2000 FC/M, 2000 FCW and 2003 FCW. Though much of the 20 years between the discontinuation of the 1000F and the introduction of the 2000 FC was spent designing an improved focal plane shutter, the 2000-series again used corrugated metal foil as material for the shutter curtains, though now titanium replaced the original stainless steel. As before, the metal shutter curtains proved to be quite easily damaged by clumsy fingers, which is why all 2000-series cameras except the 2000FC have a safety feature that retracts the shutter curtains as soon as the magazine is taken off. The 2000-series cameras were replaced by the 200-series cameras (with rubberized cloth shutter curtains), which included the 201 F, 202 FA, 203 FE, and 205 TCC/205 FCC. While the 201 F was a manual control camera, the other three 200-series models added a level of metering and exposure automation to the V series.\n\nThere were also two series of medium format view cameras developed related to the V series: the FlexBody and the ArcBody.\n\nThe last V System camera, the 503CW, was officially discontinued on April 29, 2013.<ref name='503cw-discontinued'>{{cite web |url=http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/news/2264875/hasselblad-puts-an-end-to-its-v-line-of-cameras |title=Hasselblad puts an end to its V line of cameras |access-date=2013-05-05 |publisher=British Journal of Photography |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503221205/http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/news/2264875/hasselblad-puts-an-end-to-its-v-line-of-cameras |archive-date=2013-05-03 }}</ref>\n\n''500 Series''\n* 500C (1957\u20131970, Leaf Shutter)\n* 500C/M (1970\u20131994, Leaf Shutter)\n* 500 Classic (1990\u20131992, Leaf Shutter)\n* 501C (1994\u20131997, Leaf Shutter)\n* 501CM (1997\u20132005, Leaf Shutter)\n* 503CX (1988\u20131994, Leaf Shutter, TTL OTF flash system)\n* 503CXi (1994\u20131996, Leaf Shutter, TTL OTF flash system)\n* 503CW (1996\u20132005, Leaf Shutter, TTL OTF flash system)\n* 503CXD (2006, Leaf Shutter, TTL OTF flash system)\n\n''2000 Series Cameras with Titanium Focal Plane Shutter''\n* 2000 FC (1977\u20131982, Titanium Focal Plane Shutter)\n* 2000 FC/M (1982\u20131984, Titanium Focal Plane Shutter)\n* 2000 FCW (1984\u20131988, Titanium Focal Plane Shutter)\n* 2003 FCW (1988\u20131991, Titanium Focal Plane Shutter)\n\n''200 Series Cameras with Rubberized Cloth Focal Plane Shutter''\n* 205 TCC (1991\u20131994, Rubberized Cloth Focal Plane Shutter)\n* 201 F (1994\u20131998, Rubberized Cloth Focal Plane Shutter)\n* 203 FE (1994\u20132004, Rubberized Cloth Focal Plane Shutter)\n* 205 FCC (1995\u20132004, Rubberized Cloth Focal Plane Shutter)\n* 202 FA (1998\u20132002, Rubberized Cloth Focal Plane Shutter)\n\n''Super Wide-angle (SW) cameras with fixed lenses''\n* SWA & SW (1954\u20131958, Leaf Shutter, fixed Carl Zeiss Biogon f/4.5 38&nbsp;mm wide angle lens)\n* SWC (1959\u20131979, Leaf Shutter)\n* SWC/M (1980\u20131988, Leaf Shutter)\n* 903 SWC (1988\u20132001, Leaf Shutter)\n* 905 SWC (2001\u20132006, Leaf Shutter)\n\n''View Cameras''\n* FlexBody (1995\u20132003, Tilt and shift possible, Normal Hasselblad mount )\n* ArcBody (1997\u20132001, Tilt and shift possible, Special mount with only 3 Rodenstock lenses with wider image circle)\n\n''EL series''\n* 500EL (1964\u20131970)\n* 500EL/M (1971\u20131984, introduced user-interchangeable screen),\n* 500ELX (1984\u20131988, introduced TTL-flash sensor and larger non-vignetting mirror),\n* 553ELX (1988\u20131999, introduced new internal light-absorbing coating and use of AA-batteries), and\n* 555ELD (1998\u20132006, introduced new mirror mechanics and electronic contacts for communication with digital backs)\n500EL and its successors have been and still are used mainly as workhorses in photo studios. This camera type became also very famous when a heavily modified version of it was used in the U.S. Apollo lunar exploration program. In 1968 it was used by astronaut [[William Anders]] to take the image known as ''[[Earthrise]]''. As an outgrowth of the experience with NASA cameras, a photogrammetric version of the Hasselblad 500 EL/M, the Hasselblad MK 70, was constructed with specially calibrated components.<ref>Nordin 1997.</ref>\n\n====XPan====\nThe dual-format XPan and XPan II were Hasselblad's first cameras to use 35mm film. Built with a rubber-covered titanium and aluminium body, they were designed as a coupled rangefinder camera with interchangeable, compact lenses.\n\nThe XPan cameras are [[badge engineering|re-branded]] versions of the [[Fujifilm|Fuji]] TX-1 and TX-2. The XPan II has every feature of the original, but grants the user the ability to record thirty-minute exposures compared to the old limit of three minutes. Electronic exposure information in the viewfinder is another additional feature of the XPan II.\n\nThe XPan reverted to the focal plane shutter, offering 8\u20131/1000&nbsp;s, and flash sync from B (max. 270&nbsp;s) \u2013 1/125&nbsp;s.\n\nThe intent in releasing the XPan was to provide medium format image quality on 35mm film. The XPan utilised the entire area of the 35mm film for either panorama or 35mm format, providing a [[panoramic photography|panorama]] effect without [[Masking (art)|masking]] the film or reducing image quality. This technique produced a panorama negative almost three times larger than traditional masking and over five times larger than that of [[Advanced Photo System|APS]] cameras.<ref name='XPan 1998'>{{cite web |url=http://www.hasselblad.com/media/3c8f1f64-b0af-4a98-b35e-0db6a220cfdb-XPan_English.pdf |title=For a World Less Square \u2013 XPan Product Brochure |access-date=2007-10-09 |format=PDF |publisher=Victor Hasselblad AB |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127091123/http://www.hasselblad.com/media/3c8f1f64-b0af-4a98-b35e-0db6a220cfdb-XPan_English.pdf |archive-date=2007-11-27 }}</ref>\n\nThe XPan is now discontinued.\n* XPan (1998, focal plane shutter, 35mm, Panoramic capability)\n* XPan II (2003, focal plane shutter, 35mm, Panoramic capability)\n\n====H System====\n\nHasselblad launched the H System at [[photokina 2002|photokina]] in September 2002.\n\n=====H1=====\nThe H1 departed from previous Hasselblad cameras in several respects. Hasselblad moved away from the traditional 6\u00d76 format to 6\u00d74.5&nbsp;cm, and included autofocus lenses.\n\nThe camera used Fujinon manufactured lenses and prisms, thus departing from Hasselblad's long association with Carl Zeiss when it comes to lens manufacturing.\nThe shutter in the lenses was still manufactured by Hasselblad as well as the body. Hasselblad initially invited both PhaseOne and Kodak to develop digital backs for the H-System.\n\nThe H1 had a number of other innovations, including:\n* replacement of the removable dark slide with a fold-out lever\n* inserts and backs that could accept both 120 and 220 film\n* automatic film advance\n* digital back integration\n* electronic leaf shutters with timing from 1/800 seconds down to 18 hours<ref name='Reichmann 2002'>{{cite web |url=http://photo.net/equipment/hasselblad/h1/ |title=Hasselblad H1 Product Review |access-date=2007-10-13 |last=Reichmann |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Reichmann |date=2002-11-01 |publisher=photo.net |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184955/http://photo.net/equipment/hasselblad/h1/ |archive-date=2007-10-12 }}</ref>\n\nAs with the V-series, most H1- and H2-series components were compatible with one another.\n\n=====H1D=====\nIdentical to the H1, but sold bundled with a Hasselblad-branded Imacon 22Mp iXpress back which coupled with a 40GB Image Bank allowed shooting of up to 850 images in one session.\nThe camera could only be used with the included digital back. This was Hasselblad's first integrated DSLR.\n\n=====H2=====\nHasselblad has built into the H2 cross-platform camera a new single-battery operation of the camera with the new Ixpress CFH digital back, offering one on/off switch and one operating system, facilitating streamlined, integrated operation. With existing digital backs already in the market, the H2 delivers the exact functionality of the H1.\nThe H2 camera was discontinued in October 2007.\n\n=====H2D=====\nFirst Hasselblad camera to shoot to new Raw format called the 3FR.

Firewire 800 capable.\nNew metering patterns to match the larger sensors. A new lithium ion 1,850 mAh battery was introduced that would power both the H2D body and digital back.\n2nd generation integrated DSLR.\n\n=====H2F=====\nThe H2F can be used either as a film camera or as a digital camera when mated with a Hasselblad CF31, CF22, CF22 MS, CF39, or CF39 MS back. It is completely identical to the H2, but this camera was created to \"lock out\" other digital back providers from the H-series platform. The H2F is compatible with all of the H lenses, including the HCD 24mm, HCD 28mm, and the new HCD 35-90mm zoom lens.\n\n=====H3D=====\nThe new H3D offered some (software) functionality that provided better integration between camera, viewfinder and back than the earlier H1 or H2 could provide. These two early H-System cameras, after all, were not primarily designed as digital cameras, with the H2 carrying the 'legacy' of the H1. Hasselblad's official position on the move was:\n<blockquote>\n\"In truth, [the H1] was a great film camera to which a digital back could be fitted, and...Hasselblad started to look at ways that image quality and functionality could be enhanced even more through better integration...The H2 camera has not, in any way, been diminished by Hasselblad's separate development of functions specifically for the integrated H3D. However, lacking the necessary integration of the new camera engine and Hasselblad Flexcolor software, these functions cannot work on the H2.\"<ref name='Hasselblad News 2007'>{{cite news | title=The Evolution of the Hasselblad H System Digital Strategy | date=2004-08-17 | publisher=Hasselblad News | url=http://www.hasselblad.com/news/the-evolution-of-the-hasselblad-h-system-digital-strategy.aspx | access-date=2007-10-09 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904071732/http://www.hasselblad.com/news/the-evolution-of-the-hasselblad-h-system-digital-strategy.aspx | archive-date=2007-09-04 }}</ref></blockquote>\n3rd generation integrated DSLR.\n\n=====H3DII=====\nIn 2007, Hasselblad introduced the H3DII product line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hasselbladusa.com/news/hasselblad-launches-the-h3dii.aspx|title=Hasselblad Launches the H3DII, its Fourth Generation High-End DSLR|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821160722/http://www.hasselbladusa.com/news/hasselblad-launches-the-h3dii.aspx|archive-date=21 August 2008}}</ref> The H3DII systems have a higher level of integration between the camera and the [[image sensor]] than stand-alone [[digital camera back]]s, but a disadvantage is that film backs are not usable in the H3DII.\n\n\u2022 Larger and improved 3\" TFT display.\n\n\u2022 New heat sink replaces the fan from the original H3D, making the digital back quieter and also improving the image file.\n\n\u2022 Improved the quality of the CF card door.\n\n\u2022 Improved the Firewire 800 port.\n\n\u2022 Drive button is now the WB/ISO.

It was announced in June 2016. Along with the cameras, Hasselblad released a new \"XCD\" lens mount which is specifically designed for a smaller [[Flange focal distance|flange distance]] compared to the larger \"HCD\" lens mount. The company sells an additional adapter to mount HCD lenes onto XCD lens mounts while retaining autofocus capabilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpreview.com/news/1988725790/medium-format-mirrorless-hasselblad-unveils-x1d|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625191429/http://www.dpreview.com/news/1988725790/medium-format-mirrorless-hasselblad-unveils-x1d|url-status=dead|archive-date=2016-06-25|title=Medium-format mirrorless: Hasselblad unveils X1D: Digital Photography Review|date=2016-06-25|access-date=2019-10-21}}</ref> At the time of launch two lenses were available, a 45mm and a 90mm option.

The X1D is comparable in size to current [[full-frame digital SLR]]s, but is equipped with a 43.8 x 32.9&nbsp;mm CMOS sensor. The camera uses a new XCD mount, with two lenses initially available for sale. At the same time, an H Mount adapter was announced, allowing H System Lenses to be used with full autofocus.<ref name=\"DPReview X1D\"/> Currently, there are eight XCD Lenses available with the ninth XCD 35-75 Zoom Lens details revealed in June 2019 .<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.hasselblad.com/press/press-releases/hasselblad-expands-the-lens-range-for-the-x1d-50c |title=Hasselblad expands the XCD lens range to a total of nine lenses in 2018 |publisher=Hasselblad |date=2017-11-03 |access-date=2017-11-12}}</ref> Hasselblad announced the X1D II 50c in June 2019, an upgraded variant of the original camera with the exact same sensor<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dpreview.com/interviews/2769223879/interview-with-uwe-moebus-of-hasselblad|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701112816/https://www.dpreview.com/interviews/2769223879/interview-with-uwe-moebus-of-hasselblad|url-status=dead|archive-date=2019-07-01|title=Uwe Moebus of Hasselblad - \"We have learnt that we should launch products when they are fully developed\": Digital Photography Review|date=2019-07-01|access-date=2019-10-21}}</ref> but faster electronics and a lower price point.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!Sensor\n!ISO range\n!Capture speed\n!Shutter Speed\n!Flash Sync Speed\n!Display\n!Storage\n!Video recording\n!Host Connection Type\n|-\n| '''X1D-50c'''\n| CMOS, 51 megapixels (8272 x 6200 pixels, 5.3 x 5.3 \u03bcm), 43.8 x 32.9&nbsp;mm, 16 bit\n| 100-25600\n| 2.0 fps\n| 60 min to 1/2000 sec\n| Flash can be used at all shutter speeds\n| 3.0<nowiki>''</nowiki>\n| Dual SD/SDHC/SDXC\n| HD (1920 x 1080p)\n| USB 3.0 (5 Gbit/s) Type-C connector, Mini HDMI, Audio In/Out\n|-\n|'''X1D II 50C'''\n|CMOS, 51 megapixels (8272 \u00d7 6200 pixels, 5.3 \u00d7 5.3 \u03bcm), 43.8 \u00d7 32.9&nbsp;mm\n|100-25600\n|2.7 fps\n|60 min to 1/2000 sec\n|Flash can be used at all shutter speeds\n|3.6\"\n|Dual UHS-II SD\n|To be enabled at a later date.\n|USB 3.0 (5 Gbit/s) Type-C connector, Audio In/Out\n|}\n\n===Scanners===\nWhen Hasselblad merged with Imacon in 2004, it acquired Imacon's existing range of Flextight [[Image scanner|scanners]]. In 2006, Hasselblad launched two additional Flextight models, the X1 and the X5.\n* The X1 had the ability to scan positive/negative film at 6300&nbsp;[[dpi]] optical resolution, and a 60&nbsp;MB/minute scan speed.\n* The X5 added A4 reflective scanning, a batch / slide feeder, active cooling to keep noise down, 8000&nbsp;dpi optical resolution, and a 300&nbsp;MB/minute scan speed.<ref>{{cite web|first=Michael R.|last=Tomkins|url=http://www.imaging-resource.com/NEWS/1159441934.html|title=Hasselblad press release quoted in 'Hasselblad: Two new film scanners'|publisher=The Imaging Resource|date=28 September 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Phocus===\nHasselblad also produces its own advanced image processing software called ''Phocus''.

With Phocus Mobile 2, users can import, edit and rate RAW images and import and rate full quality JPEG images directly on their iPad Pro or iPad Air 2019 model. In addition, Phocus Mobile 2 supports full quality image export, tethered shooting and direct camera control.\n\n==Collaboration with Sony==\nSince 2012, Hasselblad has been marketing redesigned versions of Sony digital cameras.\n\nAt the [[photokina 2012|2012 photokina]] trade show in Germany, Hasselblad announced it would release a new [[mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera]] (MILC) using the [[Sony E-mount]]. The camera, called the [[Hasselblad Lunar|Lunar]], is based on the [[Sony NEX-7]], including its 24.3 MP [[APS-C]] sensor, processing engine and user interface. The Lunar, which is marketed as an \"ultimate luxury\" model, was released in summer 2013.<ref name=\"DPReview Lunar\"/>\n\nOn 23 July 2013 Hasselblad announced the [[Hasselblad Stellar|Stellar]], a \"luxury\" compact digital camera based on the [[Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100]].\n\nOn 3 February 2014, Hasselblad introduced a restyled [[Sony \u03b199]] as the Hasselblad HV. According to the company's press-release, their version of the \u03b199 is \"tough as nails\", featuring more robust construction than the original.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://press.hasselblad.com/press-releases/2014/2014-02-03_pr_hv.aspx|title=Hasselblad \u2013 Create To Inspire|author=|date=|publisher=press.hasselblad.com|access-date=2014-06-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424185652/http://press.hasselblad.com/press-releases/2014/2014-02-03_pr_hv.aspx|archive-date=2014-04-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 November 2014, Hasselblad announced the Stellar II based on the DSC-RX100M2. As of now,{{when|date=May 2017}} there is no Stellar III or IV based on the already released DSC-RX100M3 and M4.\n\nUnlike Leica in a similar partnership with Panasonic, Hasselblad does not make claims of reprogrammed image processing.

The company originally became known for its classic analog medium format cameras that used a waist level viewfinder. Perhaps the most famous use of the Hasselblad camera was during the [[Apollo program]] missions when the first humans [[Moon landing|landed on the Moon]]. Almost all of the still photographs taken during these missions used modified Hasselblad cameras. In 2016, Hasselblad introduced the world's first digital compact mirrorless medium format camera, the X1D-50c, changing the portability of medium format photography. Hasselblad only produces about 10,000 cameras a year out of a small three story building.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Savov|first1=Vlad|title=This is how the world's most covetable cameras get made|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16977522/hasselblad-camera-factory-tour|access-date=6 February 2018|work=[[The Verge]]|date=6 February 2018}}</ref>[[File:Hasselbladnew.jpg|thumb|Former Hasselblad headquarters built in 2003 (now occupied by [[Sveriges Television|Sveriges Television AB]])]]\n\n== Company history ==\n\nThe company was established in 1841 in Gothenburg, Sweden, by Fritz Wiktor Hasselblad, as a trading company, F. W. Hasselblad and Co. The founder's son, Arvid Viktor Hasselblad, was interested in photography and started the photographic division of the company. Hasselblad's corporate website quotes him as saying, \"I certainly don't think that we will earn much money on this, but at least it will allow us to take pictures for free.\"<ref name=\"Hasselblad history \u2013 Hasselblad\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hasselblad.com/inspiration/our-story/hasselblad-history|title=Hasselblad history \u2013 Hasselblad|website=www.hasselblad.com|access-date=2016-04-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1877, Arvid Hasselblad commissioned the construction of Hasselblad's long-time headquarters building, in use until 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.photo90.it/storia_della_hasselblad.htm|title=Storia della Hasselblad|author=|date=|website=www.photo90.it}}</ref> While on honeymoon, Arvid Hasselblad met [[George Eastman]], founder of [[Eastman Kodak]]. In 1888, Hasselblad became the sole Swedish distributor of Eastman's products. The business was so successful that in 1908, the photographic operations were spun off into their own corporation, Fotografiska AB. Operations included a nationwide network of shops and photo labs. Management of the company eventually passed to Karl Erik Hasselblad, Arvid's son (grandson of founder F. W.). Karl Erik wanted his son, [[Victor Hasselblad]], to have a wide understanding of the camera business, and sent him to [[Dresden]], Germany, then the world center of the optics industry, at age 18 (c. 1924).\n\nVictor spent the next several years studying and working in various photography related endeavors in Europe and the US, including [[Rochester, New York]], with George Eastman, before returning to work at the family business. Due to disputes within the family, particularly with his father, Victor left the business and in 1937 started his own photo store and lab in Gothenburg, Victor Foto.\n\n===World War II===\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the Swedish military captured a fully functioning German aerial surveillance camera from a downed German plane. This was probably a Handkammer HK 12.5&nbsp;cm/7x9, which bore the codename GXN and the military account number Fl.38510.\n\nThe Swedish government realised the strategic advantage of developing an aerial camera for their own use, and in the spring of 1940 approached Victor Hasselblad to help create one. In April 1940, Victor Hasselblad established a camera workshop in Gothenburg called Ross AB in a shed at an automobile shop, working in the evenings in cooperation with a mechanic from the shop and his brother, began designing the HK7 camera.\n\nBy late 1941, the operation had over 20 employees and the Swedish Air Force asked for another camera, one which would have a larger negative and could be permanently mounted to an aircraft. This model was the SKa4. Between 1941 and 1945, Hasselblad delivered 342 cameras to the Swedish military.<ref name=\"Hasselblad history \u2013 Hasselblad\"/>\n\nIn 1942, Karl Erik Hasselblad died and Victor took control of the family business. During the war, in addition to the military cameras, Hasselblad produced watch and clock parts, over 95,000 by the war's end.\n\n===Post-war===\nAfter the war, watch and clock production continued, and other machine work was also carried out, including producing a [[slide projector]] and supplying parts for [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] automobiles.\n\nVictor Hasselblad's real ambition was to make high-quality civilian cameras. In 1945\u20131946, the first design drawings and wooden models were made for a camera to be called the Rossex. An internal design competition was held for elements of the camera; one of the winners was [[Sixten Sason]], the designer of the original [[Ursaab|Saab bodywork]].\n\nIn 1948, the camera later known as the 1600 F was released. The new design was complex, and many small improvements were needed to create a reliable product; the watchmaking background of many of the designers produced a design which was sophisticated, but more delicate than what was required for a camera. Only around 50 units were produced in 1949, and perhaps 220 in 1950, of what collectors have now designated the Series One camera. The Series Two versions of the 1600 F, perhaps as many as 3300 made from 1950 to 1953, were more reliable but still subject to frequent repairs, with many units having been cannibalized or modified by the factory. The biggest problem was its shutter, a focal-plane shutter that was hard to keep accurate. Using 120 size film it was formatted to a square 6&nbsp;cm x 6&nbsp;cm or 2 & \u00bc by 2 & \u00bc inches which meant there was no more need to turn the camera on its side.\n\nIn 1954, they mated the groundbreaking new 38mm Biogon lens designed by Dr. Bertele of Zeiss to a shallow non-reflex body to produce the SWA (Supreme Wide Angle, later changed to Super Wide Angle). Though a specialty product not intended to sell in large numbers, the SWA was an impressive achievement, and derivatives were sold for decades. Hasselblad took their two products to the [[photokina 1954|1954 photokina]] trade show in Germany, and word began to spread.\n\nIn 1953, a much-improved camera, the 1000 F was released. It too had a focal-plane shutter which led to its final replacement by the 500 C but nonetheless provided a big leg up in the medium format. It had a very fine 200mm f4 Sonnar sport lens that made it a great wildlife camera. Lenses ranged from a 60mm Distagon, standard 80mm Planar, and on up to the 200&nbsp;mm.\n\nIn December 1954, the 1000 F camera received a rave review from the influential American photography magazine, ''[[Modern Photography]]''. They put over 500 rolls of film through their test unit, and intentionally dropped it twice, and it continued to function. But the 1000 F also had shutter problems and finally gave way to the lens-mounted, tried-and-true Compur shutter, retaining its focal-plane shutter/curtain only to mask the film until the Compur shutter closed, then opened to expose the film. This was a far more dependable system, even though it meant having a shutter in each lens.\n\n=== The Hasselblad camera comes into its own ===\nThe real turning point for the company occurred in 1957. The 1000 F was replaced by the 500 C. The landmark 500 C design formed the basis for Hasselblad's product line for the next sixty years, with variants being produced until 2013. It was not until 1960, though, that Hasselblad's cameras became profitable; prior to this point, the company was still being entirely supported by sales of imported photographic supplies, including their distribution of Kodak products.\n\nIn 1962, [[NASA]] began to use Hasselblad cameras on space flights, and to request design modifications. The first motor-driven camera, the 500 EL, appeared in 1965<ref>Wildi 2000</ref> as a result of NASA requests. While Hasselblad had enjoyed a slowly but steadily growing reputation among professional photographers through the 1950s, the publicity created by NASA's use of Hasselblad products dramatically increased name recognition for the brand.\n\nIn 1966, with the increasing success of the camera division, Hasselblad exited the photographic supply and retailing industry, selling Hasselblad Fotografiska AB to Kodak.\n\n=== 1970s onward ===\nIn 1976, Victor Hasselblad sold Hasselblad AB to a Swedish investment company, S\u00e4fve\u00e5n AB. When he died in 1978, he left much of his fortune to the Hasselblad Foundation.\n\nIn 1977, the 2000 series of [[focal plane shutter]] equipped models was introduced. The 2000-series cameras had been intended to provide full exposure automation. The 2000 FC however was rushed and introduced without the automated features, partly because of a rethink about the way the automation should be accomplished (electronic vs. electro-mechanical). It was the last new camera produced during Victor Hasselblad's lifetime.\n\nIn 1984, Victor Hasselblad AB went public, with 42.5% of the company being sold on the Swedish stock exchange. The next year, Swedish corporation Incentive AB bought 58.1% of Hasselblad, and in 1991, they acquired the remainder of the shares, taking VHAB back to being a private corporation.\n\nIn 1985 Hasselblad established the subsidiary, Hasselblad Electronic Imaging AB, to focus on digital imaging and transmission systems.<ref>Hasselblad 2007</ref>\n\nIn 1991, the 200 series of automated [[focal plane shutter]] equipped models was introduced. This was the last major technical development in the course of the classic (now known as \"V-System\", after Victor) Hasselblad camera.\n\nIn 1996, Hasselblad was sold, with the new owners being [[UBS AG|UBS]], [[Cinven]], and the Hasselblad management.\n\n=== Fuji, Shriro, Imacon, and the digital age ===\nIn 1998, Hasselblad began selling the XPan, a camera designed and made in Japan by [[Fujifilm]].\n\nIn 2002, they introduced the H-System, retroactively renaming their original camera line the V-System. The H-System marked an essential transition for the company. It dropped the traditional Hasselblad square negative format, instead using 6\u00d74.5&nbsp;cm film and a new series of lenses. The then owners had no confidence in Hasselblad's already advanced digital project returning a profit, and, seeing the relative success in the market of the modern (i.e. fully automated) 645 cameras made by manufacturers like Pentax and Mamiya, closed down Hasselblad's digital department and directed all effort towards making this 645 film camera. The H-System is largely designed and manufactured by Hasselblad, with Fuji's involvement being limited to finalizing Hasselblad's lens designs and producing the glass for the lenses and viewfinders. Fuji was allowed under the agreement to sell the H1 under their name in Japan only.\n\nIn January 2003, the [[Shriro Group]] acquired a majority shareholding in Hasselblad. The group had been the distributors for Hasselblad in Japan, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan ROC, Singapore, and Malaysia for over 45 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shriro.com/hasselblad.html |title=Hasselblad |access-date=2007-10-12 |publisher=Shriro Group |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031091846/http://www.shriro.com/hasselblad.html |archive-date=2007-10-31 }}</ref>\n\nThe following year, in August 2004, Shriro Sweden, the holding company of Victor Hasselblad AB, and Swedish subsidiary of Shriro Group, announced the acquisition of high-end scanner and digital cameraback manufacturer, Imacon. The intent of the move was to correct the mistake the previous owners made when they thought there was no money to be made selling digital products and put a stop to Hasselblad's own advanced digital project, and to renew Hasselblad's ambitions in the professional digital photographic sector.<ref name='DPR 2004'>{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Hasselblad and Imacon merge | date=2004-08-17 | publisher=Digital Photography Review | url =http://www.dpreview.com/news/0408/04081701hasselbladimacon.asp | work =Digital Photography Review | pages = | access-date = 2007-10-09 | language = }}</ref>\n\nThe move was perceived as part of an industry-wide move to respond to the trend away from film to digital. Christian Poulsen, chief executive of Hasselblad after the merger, said, \"They finally realized there was no future.

Modifications were made to permit ease of use in cramped conditions while wearing spacesuits, such as the replacement of the reflex mirror with an eye-level finder.\n\nModifications by NASA technicians were further refined and incorporated into new models by Hasselblad. For example, development of a 70&nbsp;mm magazine was accelerated to meet the space program.\n\nThe first modified (in fact simplified) Hasselblad 500 C cameras were used on the last two [[Project Mercury]] missions in 1962 and 1963. They continued to be used throughout the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] spaceflights in 1965 and 1966.\n\n=== Apollo program ===\n\nA general program of reliability and safety was implemented following the [[Apollo 1]] fire in 1967, addressing such issues as reliability and safe operation of electrical equipment in a high-oxygen environment.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Photography Equipment and Techniques: A Survey of NASA Developments|journal=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|date=2001-02-01|first=Albert J|last=Derr|volume=NASA SP-5099|issue=|pages=|id= |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/apollo.photechnqs.htm|format=PDF|access-date=2007-10-06 }}</ref>\n\nEL electric cameras were used for the first time on [[Apollo 8]].

An even more extensively modified Hasselblad EL Data Camera (HDC), equipped with a special Zeiss 5.6/60&nbsp;mm Biogon lens and film magazines for 150\u2013200 exposures, was used on the Moon surface on the Apollo 11 mission. This command module camera, carried on Apollo 11, was a simplified version of the commercial Hasselblad 500 EL motorized film advance camera.

Born from the idea of Victor Hasselblad to create the \"ideal camera\", it was a 6\u00d76&nbsp;cm format focal-plane shutter SLR camera that was six inches long.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|last1=Gustavson|first1=Todd|title=Camera A history of photography from Daguerreotype to Digital|date=2009|publisher=Sterling Signature|isbn=978-1-4027-5656-6}}</ref> First simply known as the \"Hasselblad Camera\" it was later named \"1600F\" after its highest shutter speed of 1/1600 sec and \"F\" for \"focal plane\".<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The camera was revolutionary for the time with its modular design that allowed exchanging lenses, viewfinders and film magazines. The shutter was made of thin stainless steel which was light and durable enough to withstand the high acceleration forces of this fast shutter.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nThe 1600F cameras did show a couple of problems (especially the first series) so a number of changes were introduced during the production period that lasted from 1949\u20131953. The 1600F was initially released with the [[Kodak]] [[Ektar]] 2.8/80&nbsp;mm and the Ektar 3.5/135&nbsp;mm lenses. Only prototypes were made of the Ektar 6.3/55&nbsp;mm and the 5.6/254&nbsp;mm lenses.\n\nThe successor of the 1600F was the 1000F (1953\u20131957). The 1000F was named after its reduced shortest shutter speed of 1/1000 s. The 1000F has a different shutter mechanism and proved to be more reliable and robust than its predecessor. During production of the 1600F, Carl Zeiss in [[Oberkochen]] had become a supplier of lenses for the 1600F/1000F cameras. Zeiss supplied the lenses [[Distagon]] 5.6/60&nbsp;mm, [[Tessar]] 2.8/80&nbsp;mm, [[Sonnar]] 3.5/135, Sonnar 4.0/250 and Sonnar 5.6/250&nbsp;mm. Towards the end of the 1000 F production period a [[Thomas Rudolphus Dallmeyer|Dallmeyer]] 5.6/508&nbsp;mm lens made by [[Cook and Perkins]], England, was also available, but did not fully cover the full film format.\n\nHasselblad 1000F and especially 1600F cameras are very rare on the secondhand market and usually not in working condition because of age, neglect, and a lack of spare parts and qualified repairmen. Many cameras suffer from corrosion of the chrome rims. A lot of lenses suffer from scratches, fungus, discoloration and separation. Cameras in good condition can therefore fetch fairly high prices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collectiblend.com/Cameras/Hasselblad/|title=Hasselblad Price Guide|publisher=CollectiBlend}}</ref>\n\nThe 500C was produced to replace the F-series cameras. It changed the troublesome focal plane shutter for a leaf shutter in each C lens. The camera has continued for over 40 years with only minor improvements. A variation of the 500C was used by [[NASA]] for all their [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions. Most lenses were made by [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] in [[Germany]] but the very early 1600F lenses were made by [[Kodak]].\n* 1600F (1948/1949\u20131953, 1/1600 s shutter speed)\n* 1000F (1953\u20131957, 1/1000 s shutter speed)\n\n====V System====\n[[File:Hasselblad 503CW V96C.jpg|thumb|right|Hasselblad 503 CW with [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] Distagon 3,5/30 and Ixpress V96C]]\n[[File:Hasselblad 500 CM.jpg|thumb|right|Hasselblad 500 C/M with [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] lens]]\n'''The designation 'V System' was not used until the launch of the H System.''' The name \"V System\" was not created until the development of the \"H System\"; with a new system premiering, Hasselblad needed a designation to differentiate the older product line.\nThe Hasselblad V-System evolved out of Victor Hasselblad's desire to develop a small camera with fast lenses and shutters, that was as easily hand-holdable as a [[Leica Camera|Leica]], but with a larger film format. The [[Rolleiflex]]'s 6\u00d76 format was deemed ideal: large enough to provide high image quality, but small enough to fit inside a compact camera. The Rolleiflex's leaf shutter lacked the fast shutter speeds focal plane shutters could provide, and neither Leica rangefinder nor Rolleiflex TLR provided the(TTL) through the (taking) lens viewing that the slow to use, big Graflex SLR provided.\nThese considerations led to the 1600 F and a flexible camera system that includes interchangeable bodies, lenses, viewfinders, winders, film magazines and holders, and other accessories. Problems with the focal plane shutters in the 1600 F and 1000 F cameras and especially the increasing importance of electronic flash led to the development of the manual leaf shutter-based medium-format 6\u00d76 (6\u00d76&nbsp;cm or 2\u00bc\u00d72\u00bc inches) 500 C SLR camera in 1957 which offered flash synchronization at all shutter speeds. The 500 C was joined by the motor-driven 500 EL SLR camera in 1964. Apart from the housing that incorporates the motor drive and the NiCd batteries, this camera is similar in appearance and operation to the Hasselblad 500 C and uses the same magazines, lenses and viewfinders. These two cameras, together with the Superwide Camera (SWC) which was introduced in 1954 as a wide angle camera using the Carl Zeiss Biogon 38&nbsp;mm f/4.5 lens and built-in levels for exacting architecture photography, formed the core of the V-system and shared most accessories (with a few exceptions).\n\nThroughout the life of the V Series, Hasselblad incrementally updated the cameras. The 500C gave way to the 500C/M, the 503CX and 503CXi, the 501C and 501CM, and finally the 503CW as the basic manual. The SWC was replaced by the SWC/M, the 903 SWC, and finally by the 905 SWC. The 500 EL's replacements included the 500EL/M, 500ELX,553 ELX, and the 555ELD. First introduced in the 500ELX, TTL/OTF (through the lens/off the film) flash metering was also a feature of the 503CX, which was replaced by the 503CXi and finally the 503CW.\nAlongside these 500-series cameras, a series of focal plane shutter cameras was introduced. They marked the return to Victor Hasselblad's original desire to have a small camera with fast shutter speeds (1/2000 s) and fast lenses. This 2000-series started with the 2000 FC, and progressed to the 2000 FC/M, 2000 FCW and 2003 FCW. Though much of the 20 years between the discontinuation of the 1000F and the introduction of the 2000 FC was spent designing an improved focal plane shutter, the 2000-series again used corrugated metal foil as material for the shutter curtains, though now titanium replaced the original stainless steel. As before, the metal shutter curtains proved to be quite easily damaged by clumsy fingers, which is why all 2000-series cameras except the 2000FC have a safety feature that retracts the shutter curtains as soon as the magazine is taken off. The 2000-series cameras were replaced by the 200-series cameras (with rubberized cloth shutter curtains), which included the 201 F, 202 FA, 203 FE, and 205 TCC/205 FCC. While the 201 F was a manual control camera, the other three 200-series models added a level of metering and exposure automation to the V series.\n\nThere were also two series of medium format view cameras developed related to the V series: the FlexBody and the ArcBody.\n\nThe last V System camera, the 503CW, was officially discontinued on April 29, 2013.<ref name='503cw-discontinued'>{{cite web |url=http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/news/2264875/hasselblad-puts-an-end-to-its-v-line-of-cameras |title=Hasselblad puts an end to its V line of cameras |access-date=2013-05-05 |publisher=British Journal of Photography |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503221205/http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/news/2264875/hasselblad-puts-an-end-to-its-v-line-of-cameras |archive-date=2013-05-03 }}</ref>\n\n''500 Series''\n* 500C (1957\u20131970, Leaf Shutter)\n* 500C/M (1970\u20131994, Leaf Shutter)\n* 500 Classic (1990\u20131992, Leaf Shutter)\n* 501C (1994\u20131997, Leaf Shutter)\n* 501CM (1997\u20132005, Leaf Shutter)\n* 503CX (1988\u20131994, Leaf Shutter, TTL OTF flash system)\n* 503CXi (1994\u20131996, Leaf Shutter, TTL OTF flash system)\n* 503CW (1996\u20132005, Leaf Shutter, TTL OTF flash system)\n* 503CXD (2006, Leaf Shutter, TTL OTF flash system)\n\n''2000 Series Cameras with Titanium Focal Plane Shutter''\n* 2000 FC (1977\u20131982, Titanium Focal Plane Shutter)\n* 2000 FC/M (1982\u20131984, Titanium Focal Plane Shutter)\n* 2000 FCW (1984\u20131988, Titanium Focal Plane Shutter)\n* 2003 FCW (1988\u20131991, Titanium Focal Plane Shutter)\n\n''200 Series Cameras with Rubberized Cloth Focal Plane Shutter''\n* 205 TCC (1991\u20131994, Rubberized Cloth Focal Plane Shutter)\n* 201 F (1994\u20131998, Rubberized Cloth Focal Plane Shutter)\n* 203 FE (1994\u20132004, Rubberized Cloth Focal Plane Shutter)\n* 205 FCC (1995\u20132004, Rubberized Cloth Focal Plane Shutter)\n* 202 FA (1998\u20132002, Rubberized Cloth Focal Plane Shutter)\n\n''Super Wide-angle (SW) cameras with fixed lenses''\n* SWA & SW (1954\u20131958, Leaf Shutter, fixed Carl Zeiss Biogon f/4.5 38&nbsp;mm wide angle lens)\n* SWC (1959\u20131979, Leaf Shutter)\n* SWC/M (1980\u20131988, Leaf Shutter)\n* 903 SWC (1988\u20132001, Leaf Shutter)\n* 905 SWC (2001\u20132006, Leaf Shutter)\n\n''View Cameras''\n* FlexBody (1995\u20132003, Tilt and shift possible, Normal Hasselblad mount )\n* ArcBody (1997\u20132001, Tilt and shift possible, Special mount with only 3 Rodenstock lenses with wider image circle)\n\n''EL series''\n* 500EL (1964\u20131970)\n* 500EL/M (1971\u20131984, introduced user-interchangeable screen),\n* 500ELX (1984\u20131988, introduced TTL-flash sensor and larger non-vignetting mirror),\n* 553ELX (1988\u20131999, introduced new internal light-absorbing coating and use of AA-batteries), and\n* 555ELD (1998\u20132006, introduced new mirror mechanics and electronic contacts for communication with digital backs)\n500EL and its successors have been and still are used mainly as workhorses in photo studios. This camera type became also very famous when a heavily modified version of it was used in the U.S. Apollo lunar exploration program. In 1968 it was used by astronaut [[William Anders]] to take the image known as ''[[Earthrise]]''. As an outgrowth of the experience with NASA cameras, a photogrammetric version of the Hasselblad 500 EL/M, the Hasselblad MK 70, was constructed with specially calibrated components.<ref>Nordin 1997.</ref>\n\n====XPan====\nThe dual-format XPan and XPan II were Hasselblad's first cameras to use 35mm film. Built with a rubber-covered titanium and aluminium body, they were designed as a coupled rangefinder camera with interchangeable, compact lenses.\n\nThe XPan cameras are [[badge engineering|re-branded]] versions of the [[Fujifilm|Fuji]] TX-1 and TX-2. The XPan II has every feature of the original, but grants the user the ability to record thirty-minute exposures compared to the old limit of three minutes. Electronic exposure information in the viewfinder is another additional feature of the XPan II.\n\nThe XPan reverted to the focal plane shutter, offering 8\u20131/1000&nbsp;s, and flash sync from B (max. 270&nbsp;s) \u2013 1/125&nbsp;s.\n\nThe intent in releasing the XPan was to provide medium format image quality on 35mm film. The XPan utilised the entire area of the 35mm film for either panorama or 35mm format, providing a [[panoramic photography|panorama]] effect without [[Masking (art)|masking]] the film or reducing image quality. This technique produced a panorama negative almost three times larger than traditional masking and over five times larger than that of [[Advanced Photo System|APS]] cameras.<ref name='XPan 1998'>{{cite web |url=http://www.hasselblad.com/media/3c8f1f64-b0af-4a98-b35e-0db6a220cfdb-XPan_English.pdf |title=For a World Less Square \u2013 XPan Product Brochure |access-date=2007-10-09 |format=PDF |publisher=Victor Hasselblad AB |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127091123/http://www.hasselblad.com/media/3c8f1f64-b0af-4a98-b35e-0db6a220cfdb-XPan_English.pdf |archive-date=2007-11-27 }}</ref>\n\nThe XPan is now discontinued.\n* XPan (1998, focal plane shutter, 35mm, Panoramic capability)\n* XPan II (2003, focal plane shutter, 35mm, Panoramic capability)\n\n====H System====\n\nHasselblad launched the H System at [[photokina 2002|photokina]] in September 2002.\n\n=====H1=====\nThe H1 departed from previous Hasselblad cameras in several respects. Hasselblad moved away from the traditional 6\u00d76 format to 6\u00d74.5&nbsp;cm, and included autofocus lenses.\n\nThe camera used Fujinon manufactured lenses and prisms, thus departing from Hasselblad's long association with Carl Zeiss when it comes to lens manufacturing.\nThe shutter in the lenses was still manufactured by Hasselblad as well as the body. Hasselblad initially invited both PhaseOne and Kodak to develop digital backs for the H-System.\n\nThe H1 had a number of other innovations, including:\n* replacement of the removable dark slide with a fold-out lever\n* inserts and backs that could accept both 120 and 220 film\n* automatic film advance\n* digital back integration\n* electronic leaf shutters with timing from 1/800 seconds down to 18 hours<ref name='Reichmann 2002'>{{cite web |url=http://photo.net/equipment/hasselblad/h1/ |title=Hasselblad H1 Product Review |access-date=2007-10-13 |last=Reichmann |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Reichmann |date=2002-11-01 |publisher=photo.net |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184955/http://photo.net/equipment/hasselblad/h1/ |archive-date=2007-10-12 }}</ref>\n\nAs with the V-series, most H1- and H2-series components were compatible with one another.\n\n=====H1D=====\nIdentical to the H1, but sold bundled with a Hasselblad-branded Imacon 22Mp iXpress back which coupled with a 40GB Image Bank allowed shooting of up to 850 images in one session.\nThe camera could only be used with the included digital back. This was Hasselblad's first integrated DSLR.\n\n=====H2=====\nHasselblad has built into the H2 cross-platform camera a new single-battery operation of the camera with the new Ixpress CFH digital back, offering one on/off switch and one operating system, facilitating streamlined, integrated operation. With existing digital backs already in the market, the H2 delivers the exact functionality of the H1.\nThe H2 camera was discontinued in October 2007.\n\n=====H2D=====\nFirst Hasselblad camera to shoot to new Raw format called the 3FR.

Firewire 800 capable.\nNew metering patterns to match the larger sensors. A new lithium ion 1,850 mAh battery was introduced that would power both the H2D body and digital back.\n2nd generation integrated DSLR.\n\n=====H2F=====\nThe H2F can be used either as a film camera or as a digital camera when mated with a Hasselblad CF31, CF22, CF22 MS, CF39, or CF39 MS back. It is completely identical to the H2, but this camera was created to \"lock out\" other digital back providers from the H-series platform. The H2F is compatible with all of the H lenses, including the HCD 24mm, HCD 28mm, and the new HCD 35-90mm zoom lens.\n\n=====H3D=====\nThe new H3D offered some (software) functionality that provided better integration between camera, viewfinder and back than the earlier H1 or H2 could provide. These two early H-System cameras, after all, were not primarily designed as digital cameras, with the H2 carrying the 'legacy' of the H1. Hasselblad's official position on the move was:\n<blockquote>\n\"In truth, [the H1] was a great film camera to which a digital back could be fitted, and...Hasselblad started to look at ways that image quality and functionality could be enhanced even more through better integration...The H2 camera has not, in any way, been diminished by Hasselblad's separate development of functions specifically for the integrated H3D. However, lacking the necessary integration of the new camera engine and Hasselblad Flexcolor software, these functions cannot work on the H2.\"<ref name='Hasselblad News 2007'>{{cite news | title=The Evolution of the Hasselblad H System Digital Strategy | date=2004-08-17 | publisher=Hasselblad News | url=http://www.hasselblad.com/news/the-evolution-of-the-hasselblad-h-system-digital-strategy.aspx | access-date=2007-10-09 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904071732/http://www.hasselblad.com/news/the-evolution-of-the-hasselblad-h-system-digital-strategy.aspx | archive-date=2007-09-04 }}</ref></blockquote>\n3rd generation integrated DSLR.\n\n=====H3DII=====\nIn 2007, Hasselblad introduced the H3DII product line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hasselbladusa.com/news/hasselblad-launches-the-h3dii.aspx|title=Hasselblad Launches the H3DII, its Fourth Generation High-End DSLR|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821160722/http://www.hasselbladusa.com/news/hasselblad-launches-the-h3dii.aspx|archive-date=21 August 2008}}</ref> The H3DII systems have a higher level of integration between the camera and the [[image sensor]] than stand-alone [[digital camera back]]s, but a disadvantage is that film backs are not usable in the H3DII.\n\n\u2022 Larger and improved 3\" TFT display.\n\n\u2022 New heat sink replaces the fan from the original H3D, making the digital back quieter and also improving the image file.\n\n\u2022 Improved the quality of the CF card door.\n\n\u2022 Improved the Firewire 800 port.\n\n\u2022 Drive button is now the WB/ISO.

It was announced in June 2016. Along with the cameras, Hasselblad released a new \"XCD\" lens mount which is specifically designed for a smaller [[Flange focal distance|flange distance]] compared to the larger \"HCD\" lens mount.

With Phocus Mobile 2, users can import, edit and rate RAW images and import and rate full quality JPEG images directly on their iPad Pro or iPad Air 2019 model. In addition, Phocus Mobile 2 supports full quality image export, tethered shooting and direct camera control.\n\n==Collaboration with Sony==\nSince 2012, Hasselblad has been marketing redesigned versions of Sony digital cameras.\n\nAt the [[photokina 2012|2012 photokina]] trade show in Germany, Hasselblad announced it would release a new [[mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera]] (MILC) using the [[Sony E-mount]]. The camera, called the [[Hasselblad Lunar|Lunar]], is based on the [[Sony NEX-7]], including its 24.3 MP [[APS-C]] sensor, processing engine and user interface. The Lunar, which is marketed as an \"ultimate luxury\" model, was released in summer 2013.<ref name=\"DPReview Lunar\"/>\n\nOn 23 July 2013 Hasselblad announced the [[Hasselblad Stellar|Stellar]], a \"luxury\" compact digital camera based on the [[Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100]].\n\nOn 3 February 2014, Hasselblad introduced a restyled [[Sony \u03b199]] as the Hasselblad HV.

Although there is wide agreement that the Olmec culture helped lay the foundations for the civilizations that followed, there is disagreement over the extent of the Olmec contributions, and even a proper definition of the Olmec \"culture\". See \"[[Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures]]\" for a deeper treatment of this question.</ref> Among other \"firsts\", the Olmec appeared to practice [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|ritual bloodletting]] and played the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]], hallmarks of nearly all subsequent Mesoamerican societies.

This area is characterized by swampy lowlands punctuated by low hills, ridges, and volcanoes. The [[Sierra de Los Tuxtlas|Tuxtlas Mountains]] rise sharply in the north, along the Gulf of Mexico's [[Bay of Campeche]]. Here, the Olmec constructed permanent city-temple complexes at [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitl\u00e1n]], [[La Venta]], [[Tres Zapotes]], and [[Laguna de los Cerros]]. In this region, the first Mesoamerican civilization emerged and reigned from {{circa}} 1400\u2013400&nbsp;BCE.<ref>Dates from Pool, p. 1. Diehl gives a slightly earlier date of 1500&nbsp;BCE (p. 9), but the same end-date. Any dates for the start of the Olmec civilization or culture are problematic as its rise was a gradual process. Most Olmec dates are based on radiocarbon dating (see e.g. Diehl, p. 10), which is only accurate within a given range (e.g. \u00b190 years in the case of early [[El Manati]] layers), and much is still to be learned concerning early Gulf lowland settlements.</ref>\n\n===Origins===\n{{Main|San Lorenzo Tenochtitl\u00e1n}}\nThe beginnings of Olmec civilization have traditionally been placed between 1400 and 1200&nbsp;BCE. Past finds of Olmec remains ritually deposited at El Manati shrine (near San Lorenzo) moved this back to \"at least\" 1600\u20131500&nbsp;BCE.<ref>Richard A Diehl, 2004, The Olmecs \u2013 America's First Civilization London: Thames & Hudson, pp. 25, 27.</ref> It seems that the Olmec had their roots in early farming cultures of [[Tabasco]], which began between 5100&nbsp;BCE and 4600&nbsp;BCE. These shared the same basic food crops and technologies of the later Olmec civilization.<ref>Diehl, 2004: pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\nWhat is today called Olmec first appeared fully within the city of San Lorenzo Tenochtitl\u00e1n, where distinctive Olmec features occurred around 1400&nbsp;BCE. The rise of civilization was assisted by the local ecology of well-watered [[alluvial]] soil, as well as by the transportation network provided by the [[Coatzacoalcos River]] basin. This environment may be compared to that of other ancient centers of civilization: the [[Nile]], [[Indus]], and [[Yellow River]] valleys, and [[Mesopotamia]]. This highly productive environment encouraged a densely concentrated population, which in turn triggered the rise of an elite class.<ref>{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Roger B. | author2 = Linda Black | author3 = Larry S.

The source of the most valued jade was the [[Motagua River]] valley in eastern [[Guatemala]],<ref>Pool, p. 151.</ref> and Olmec obsidian has been traced to sources in the Guatemala highlands, such as El Chayal and [[San Mart\u00edn Jilotepeque]], or in [[Puebla (state)|Puebla]],<ref>Diehl, p. 132, or Pool, p. 150.</ref> distances ranging from 200 to 400&nbsp;km (120\u2013250 miles) away, respectively.<ref name=\"Pool, p. 103\">Pool, p. 103.</ref>\n\nThe state of [[Guerrero]], and in particular its early [[Mezcala culture]], seem to have played an important role in the early history of Olmec culture. Olmec-style artifacts tend to appear earlier in some parts of Guerrero than in the Veracruz-Tabasco area. In particular, the relevant objects from the Amuco-Abelino site in Guerrero reveal dates as early as 1530 BCE.<ref>Susan Toby Evans, David L. Webster, eds, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vZ3DAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA315 ''Archaeology of Ancient Mexico and Central America: An Encyclopedia.''] Routledge, 2013 {{ISBN|1136801855}} p. 315</ref> The city of [[Teopantecuanitlan]] in Guerrero is also relevant in this regard.\n\n===La Venta===\n{{main|La Venta}}\n[[Image:La Venta Pir\u00e1mide cara sur.jpg|250px|thumb|Great pyramid in [[La Venta]], [[Tabasco]]]]\nThe first Olmec center, San Lorenzo, was all but abandoned around 900&nbsp;BCE at about the same time that La Venta rose to prominence.<ref>Diehl, p. 9.</ref> A wholesale destruction of many San Lorenzo monuments also occurred [[circa]] 950&nbsp;BCE, which may indicate an internal uprising or, less likely, an invasion.<ref>Coe (1967), p. 72. Alternatively, the mutilation of these monuments may be unrelated to the decline and abandonment of San Lorenzo. Some researchers believe that the mutilation had ritualistic aspects, particularly since most mutilated monuments were reburied in a row.</ref> The latest thinking, however, is that environmental changes may have been responsible for this shift in Olmec centers, with certain important rivers changing course.<ref>Pool, p. 135. Diehl, pp. 58\u201359, 82.</ref>\n\nIn any case, following the decline of San Lorenzo, La Venta became the most prominent Olmec center, lasting from 900&nbsp;BCE until its abandonment around 400&nbsp;BCE.<ref>Diehl, p. 9. Pool gives dates 1000&nbsp;BCE&nbsp;\u2013 400&nbsp;BCE for La Venta.</ref> La Venta sustained the Olmec cultural traditions with spectacular displays of power and wealth. The [[La Venta#Complex C (The Great Pyramid)|Great Pyramid]] was the largest Mesoamerican structure of its time. Even today, after 2500 years of erosion, it rises {{convert|34|m|abbr=on}} above the naturally flat landscape.<ref>Pool, p. 157.</ref> Buried deep within La Venta lay opulent, labor-intensive \"offerings\"&nbsp;\u2013 1000 tons of smooth [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] blocks, large mosaic pavements, and at least 48 separate [[votive deposits|deposits]] of polished jade [[celt (tool)|celts]], pottery, figurines, and [[hematite]] [[Mirrors in Mesoamerican culture|mirrors]].<ref>Pool, p. 161\u2013162.</ref>\n\n===Decline===\nScholars have yet to determine the cause of the eventual extinction of the Olmec culture. Between 400 and 350&nbsp;BCE, the population in the eastern half of the Olmec heartland dropped precipitously, and the area was sparsely inhabited until the 19th century.<ref>Diehl, p. 82. Nagy, p. 270, however, is more circumspect, stating that in the [[Grijalva river]] delta, on the eastern edge of the heartland, \"the local population had significantly declined in apparent population density&nbsp;... A low-density Late Preclassic and Early Classic occupation . . . may have existed; however, it remains invisible.\"</ref> According to archaeologists, this depopulation was probably the result of \"very serious environmental changes that rendered the region unsuited for large groups of farmers\", in particular changes to the riverine environment that the Olmec depended upon for agriculture, hunting and gathering, and transportation. These changes may have been triggered by [[tectonic]] upheavals or subsidence, or the [[Siltation|silting]] up of rivers due to agricultural practices.<ref>Quote and analysis from Diehl, p. 82, echoed in other works such as Pool.</ref>\n\nOne theory for the considerable population drop during the Terminal Formative period is suggested by Santley and colleagues (Santley et al. 1997), who propose the relocation of settlements due to volcanism, instead of extinction. Volcanic eruptions during the Early, Late and Terminal Formative periods would have blanketed the lands and forced the Olmec to move their settlements.<ref>Vanderwarker (2006) pp. 50\u201351</ref>\n\nWhatever the cause, within a few hundred years of the abandonment of the last Olmec cities, successor cultures became firmly established. The Tres Zapotes site, on the western edge of the Olmec heartland, continued to be occupied well past 400&nbsp;BCE, but without the hallmarks of the Olmec culture. This post-Olmec culture, often labeled [[Epi-Olmec culture|Epi-Olmec]], has features similar to those found at [[Izapa]], some 550&nbsp;km (330&nbsp;miles) to the southeast.<ref>Coe (2002), p. 88.</ref>\n\n==Art==\n[[File:Olmec fish vessel.jpg|upright|thumb|Fish Vessel, 12th\u20139th century&nbsp;BCE.<br>Height: 6.5 inches (16.5 cm).]]\n[[File:Olmec baby-face figurine, Snite.jpg|upright|thumb|Olmec white ware \"hollow baby\" figurine, \n1000 -300 BCE.]]\nThe Olmec culture was first defined as an art style, and this continues to be the hallmark of the culture.<ref name=\"Coe 2002, p. 62\">Coe (2002), p. 62.</ref> Wrought in a large number of media \u2013 jade, clay, basalt, and greenstone among others \u2013 much Olmec art, such as [[The Wrestler (sculpture)|''The Wrestler'']], is naturalistic.

Diehl, pp. 109\u2013115.</ref>\n\n*Colossal heads (which can be up to {{cvt|3|m|0}} tall);\n*Rectangular \"altars\" (more likely thrones) {{citation needed|date=December 2019}} such as Altar 5 shown below;\n*Free-standing in-the-round sculpture, such as the twins from [[El Azuzul]] or [[San Martin Pajapan Monument 1]]; and\n*[[Stela]]e, such as La Venta Monument 19 above. The stelae form was generally introduced later than the colossal heads, altars, or free-standing sculptures. Over time, the stelae changed from simple representation of figures, such as Monument 19 or [[:Image:Olmec woman.jpg|La Venta Stela 1]], toward representations of historical events, particularly acts legitimizing rulers. This trend would culminate in post-Olmec monuments such as [[La Mojarra Stela 1]], which combines images of rulers with [[Mesoamerican writing systems|script]] and [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|calendar dates]].<ref>Pool, pp. 106\u2013108, 176.</ref>\n\n===Colossal heads===\n{{Main|Olmec colossal heads}}\nThe most recognized aspect of the Olmec civilization are the enormous helmeted heads.<ref>Diehl, p. 111.</ref> As no known pre-Columbian text explains them, these impressive monuments have been the subject of much speculation. Once theorized to be [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballplayers]], it is now generally accepted that these heads are portraits of rulers, perhaps dressed as ballplayers.<ref>Pool, p. 118; Diehl, p. 112. Coe (2002), p. 69: \"They wear headgear rather like American football helmets which probably served as protection in both war and in the ceremonial game played\u2026throughout Mesoamerica.\"</ref> Infused with individuality, no two heads are alike and the helmet-like headdresses are adorned with distinctive elements, suggesting personal or group symbols. Some have also speculated that Mesoamerican people believed that the soul, along with all of one's experiences and emotions, was contained inside the head.<ref name=Miller/><ref>Grove, p. 55.</ref>\n\nSeventeen colossal heads have been unearthed to date.<ref>Pool, p. 107.</ref>\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

See Scarre. pp. 271\u2013274 for the \"55 tonnes\" weight.</ref>\n\n[[File:La_Venta_Mosaic_(Ruben_Charles).jpg|thumb|left|250px|One of the mosaics from the La Venta Olmec site.]]\nThe heads were carved from single blocks or boulders of volcanic [[basalt]], found in the [[Sierra de Los Tuxtlas|Tuxtlas Mountains]]. The Tres Zapotes heads, for example, were sculpted from basalt found at the summit of Cerro el Vig\u00eda, at the western end of the Tuxtlas. The San Lorenzo and La Venta heads, on the other hand, were probably carved from the basalt of Cerro Cintepec, on the southeastern side,<ref>See Williams and Heizer for more detail.</ref> perhaps at the nearby [[Llano del Jicaro]] workshop, and dragged or floated to their final destination dozens of miles away.<ref>Scarre. Pool, p. 129.</ref> It has been estimated that moving a colossal head required the efforts of 1,500 people for three to four months.<ref name=\"Pool, p. 103\" />\n\nSome of the heads, and many other monuments, have been variously mutilated, buried and disinterred, reset in new locations and/or reburied. Some monuments, and at least two heads, were recycled or recarved, but it is not known whether this was simply due to the scarcity of stone or whether these actions had ritual or other connotations. Scholars believe that some mutilation had significance beyond mere destruction, but some scholars still do not rule out internal conflicts or, less likely, invasion as a factor.<ref>Diehl, p. 119.</ref>\n\nThe flat-faced, thick-lipped heads have caused some debate due to their resemblance to some African facial characteristics. Based on this comparison, some writers have said that the Olmecs were Africans who had emigrated to the New World.<ref>Wiercinski, A. (1972). \"Inter-and Intrapopulational Racial Differentiation of Tlatilco, Cerro de Las Mesas, Teothuacan, Monte Alban and Yucatan Maya,\" ''XXXIX Congreso Intern. de Americanistas,'' Lima 1970, '''1''', 231\u2013252.</ref> But, the vast majority of archaeologists and other Mesoamerican scholars reject claims of pre-Columbian contacts with Africa.<ref>[[Karl Taube]], for one, says \"There simply is no material evidence of any Pre-Hispanic contact between the Old World and Mesoamerica before the arrival of the Spanish in the sixteenth century.\", p. 17.\n\n*Davis, N.

Others note that in addition to the broad noses and thick lips, the eyes of the heads often show the [[epicanthic fold]], and that all these characteristics can still be found in modern Mesoamerican Indians. For instance, in the 1940s, the artist/art historian [[Miguel Covarrubias]] published a series of photos of Olmec artworks and of the faces of modern [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Mexican Indians]] with very similar facial characteristics.<ref>''Mexico South'', Covarrubias, 1946</ref> The African origin hypothesis assumes that Olmec carving was intended to be a representation of the inhabitants, an assumption that is hard to justify given the full corpus of representation in Olmec carving.<ref>Ortiz de Montellano, et al. 1997, p. 217</ref> [[Ivan van Sertima]] claimed that the seven braids on the Tres Zapotes head was an Ethiopian hair style but he offered no evidence that this was an Ethiopian hair style at the appropriate time.

(2005) hint that Olmec iconography was first developed in the [[Tlatilco culture]].</ref>\n\nThe generally accepted, but by no means unanimous, interpretation is that the Olmec-style artifacts, in all sizes, became associated with elite status and were adopted by non-Olmec Formative Period chieftains in an effort to bolster their status.<ref>See for example Reilly; Stevens (2007); Rose (2007). For a full discussion, see [[Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures]].</ref>\n\n==Notable innovations==\nIn addition to their influence with contemporaneous [[List of pre-Columbian civilizations|Mesoamerican cultures]], as the first civilization in Mesoamerica, the Olmecs are credited, or speculatively credited, with many \"firsts\", including the [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|bloodletting]] and perhaps [[Mesoamerica#Human Sacrifice|human sacrifice]], writing and [[epigraphy]], and the invention of popcorn, [[0 (number)|zero]] and the [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerican calendar]], and the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]], as well as perhaps the [[compass]].<ref>See Carlson for details of the compass.</ref> Some researchers, including artist and [[art historian]] [[Miguel Covarrubias]], even postulate that the Olmecs formulated the forerunners of many of the later Mesoamerican [[deities]].<ref>Covarrubias, p. 27.</ref>\n\n===Bloodletting and sacrifice speculation===\n[[File:La Venta Altar 5 (Ruben Charles).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Altar 5 from La Venta.

No Olmec or Olmec-influenced sacrificial artifacts have yet been discovered; no Olmec or Olmec-influenced artwork unambiguously shows sacrificial victims (as do the ''danzante'' figures of [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]]) or scenes of human sacrifice (such as can be seen in [[:Image:El Tajin Ballcourt Mural (Tom Aleto).jpg|the famous ballcourt mural]] from [[El Tajin]]).<ref>Pool, p. 139.</ref>\n\nAt the [[El Manat\u00ed]] site, disarticulated skulls and femurs, as well as the complete skeletons of newborn or unborn children, have been discovered amidst the other offerings, leading to speculation concerning infant sacrifice. Scholars have not determined how the infants met their deaths.<ref>Ortiz et al., p. 249.</ref> Some authors have associated infant sacrifice with Olmec ritual art showing limp [[Olmec were-jaguar|were-jaguar]] babies, most famously in La Venta's [[La Venta#Altars 4 & 5|Altar 5]] (on the right) or [[Las Limas Monument 1|Las Limas figure]].<ref>Pool, p. 116.

The glyphs surrounding the date are one of the few surviving examples of [[Epi-Olmec script]].<ref>Diehl, p. 184.</ref>]]\n\nThe [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|Long Count calendar]] used by many subsequent Mesoamerican civilizations, as well as the concept of [[zero (number)|zero]], may have been devised by the Olmecs. Because the six artifacts with the earliest Long Count calendar dates were all discovered outside the immediate Maya homeland, it is likely that this calendar predated the Maya and was possibly the invention of the Olmecs. Indeed, three of these six artifacts were found within the Olmec heartland. But an argument against an Olmec origin is the fact that the Olmec civilization had ended by the 4th century&nbsp;BCE, several centuries before the earliest known Long Count date artifact.<ref>\"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar & invention of the zero concept\" section cited to Diehl, p. 186.</ref>\n\nThe Long Count calendar required the use of zero as a place-holder within its [[vigesimal]] (base-20) positional numeral system. A shell glyph \u2013[[File:MAYA-g-num-0-inc-v1.svg]] \u2013 was used as a zero symbol for these Long Count dates, the second oldest of which, on Stela C at [[Tres Zapotes]], has a date of 32&nbsp;BCE. This is one of the earliest uses of the zero concept in history.<ref>Haughton, p. 153. The earliest recovered Long Count dated is from Monument 1 in the [[Maya Civilization|Maya]] site [[El Ba\u00fal]], [[Guatemala]], bearing a date of 37&nbsp;BCE.</ref>\n\n===Mesoamerican ballgame===\nThe Olmec are strong candidates for originating the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] so prevalent among later cultures of the region and used for recreational and religious purposes.<ref>Miller and Taube (1993) p. 42. Pool, p. 295.</ref> A dozen rubber balls dating to 1600&nbsp;BCE or earlier have been found in [[El Manat\u00ed]], a [[bog]] {{convert|10|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} east of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan.<ref>Ortiz C.</ref> These balls predate the earliest ballcourt yet discovered at [[Paso de la Amada]], [[circa]] 1400&nbsp;BCE, although there is no certainty that they were used in the ballgame.<ref>See Filloy Nadal, p. 27, who says \"If they [the balls] were used in the ballgame, we would be looking at the earliest evidence of this practice\".</ref>\n\n==Ethnicity and language==\n[[File:Tumba Olmeca.jpg|thumb|left|Olmec tomb at La Venta Park, [[Villahermosa]], [[Tabasco]].]]\nWhile the actual ethno-linguistic affiliation of the Olmec remains unknown, various hypotheses have been put forward. For example, in 1968 [[Michael D. Coe]] speculated that the Olmec were Mayan predecessors.<ref>Coe (1968) p. 121.</ref>\n\nIn 1976, linguists [[Lyle Campbell]] and [[Terrence Kaufman]] published a paper in which they argued a core number of loanwords had apparently spread from a [[Mixe\u2013Zoque languages|Mixe\u2013Zoquean language]] into many other [[Mesoamerican languages]].<ref>Campbell & Kaufman (1976), pp. 80\u201389. For example, the words for \"incense\", \"cacao\", \"corn\", many names of various fruits, \"nagual/shaman\", \"tobacco\", \"adobe\", \"ladder\", \"rubber\", \"corn granary\", \"squash/gourd\", and \"paper\" in many Mesoamerican languages seem to have been borrowed from an ancient Mixe\u2013Zoquean language.</ref> Campbell and Kaufman proposed that the presence of these core loanwords indicated that the Olmec \u2013 generally regarded as the first \"highly civilized\" Mesoamerican society \u2013 spoke a language ancestral to Mixe\u2013Zoquean. The spread of this vocabulary particular to their culture accompanied the diffusion of other Olmec cultural and artistic traits that appears in the archaeological record of other Mesoamerican societies.\n\nMixe\u2013Zoque specialist [[S\u00f8ren Wichmann]] first critiqued this theory on the basis that most of the Mixe\u2013Zoquean loans seemed to originate only from the Zoquean branch of the family. This implied the loanword transmission occurred in the period ''after'' the two branches of the language family split, placing the time of the borrowings outside of the Olmec period.<ref>Wichmann (1995).</ref> However, new evidence has pushed back the proposed date for the split of Mixean and Zoquean languages to a period within the Olmec era.<ref name=\"Wichmann, Beliaev 2008\">Wichmann, Beliaev & Davletshin, (in press Sep 2008).</ref> Based on this dating, the architectural and archaeological patterns and the particulars of the vocabulary loaned to other Mesoamerican languages from Mixe\u2013Zoquean, Wichmann now suggests that the Olmecs of San Lorenzo spoke proto-Mixe and the Olmecs of La Venta spoke proto-Zoque.<ref name=\"Wichmann, Beliaev 2008\"/>\n\nAt least the fact that the Mixe\u2013Zoquean languages are still spoken in an area corresponding roughly to the [[Olmec heartland]], and are historically known to have been spoken there, leads most scholars to assume that the Olmec spoke one or more Mixe\u2013Zoquean languages.<ref>See Pool, p.&nbsp;6, or Diehl, p.&nbsp;85.</ref>\n\n==Religion and mythology==\n{{Main|Olmec religion}}\n[[File:Olmec King.jpg|thumb|upright|Olmec Chief or King. Relief from [[La Venta]] Archaeological Site in [[Tabasco]].]]\nOlmec religious activities were performed by a combination of rulers, full-time priests, and [[shaman]]s. The rulers seem to have been the most important religious figures, with their links to the Olmec deities or supernaturals providing legitimacy for their rule.<ref>Diehl, p. 106. See also J. E. Clark, p. 343, who says \"much of the art of La Venta appears to have been dedicated to rulers who dressed as gods, or to the gods themselves\".</ref> There is also considerable evidence for shamans in the Olmec archaeological record, particularly in the so-called \"[[Olmec figurine#Transformation figures|transformation figures]]\".<ref>Diehl, p. 106.</ref>\n\nAs Olmec mythology has left no documents comparable to the [[Popul Vuh]] from [[Maya mythology]], any exposition of Olmec mythology must be based on interpretations of surviving monumental and portable art (such as the ''Se\u00f1or de Las Limas'' statue at the Xalapa Museum), and comparisons with other Mesoamerican mythologies. Olmec art shows that such deities as the [[Feathered Serpent (deity)|Feathered Serpent]] and a rain supernatural were already in the Mesoamerican pantheon in Olmec times.<ref>Diehl, pp. 103\u2013104.</ref>\n\n==Social and political organization==\nLittle is directly known about the societal or political structure of Olmec society. Although it is assumed by most researchers that the colossal heads and several other sculptures represent rulers, nothing has been found like the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[stelae]] ([[:Image:Catherwood stela d.jpg|see drawing]]) which name specific rulers and provide the dates of their rule.<ref>See, for example, Cyphers (1996), p. 156.</ref>\n\nInstead, archaeologists relied on the data that they had, such as large- and small-scale site surveys. These provided evidence of considerable centralization within the Olmec region, first at San Lorenzo and then at La Venta \u2013 no other Olmec sites come close to these in terms of area or in the quantity and quality of architecture and sculpture.<ref>See Santley, et al., p.4, for a discussion of Mesoamerican centralization and decentralization. See Cyphers (1999) for a discussion of the meaning of monument placement.</ref>\n\nThis evidence of geographic and demographic centralization leads archaeologists to propose that Olmec society itself was hierarchical, concentrated first at San Lorenzo and then at La Venta, with an elite that was able to use their control over materials such as water and monumental stone to exert command and legitimize their regime.<ref>See Cyphers (1999) for a more detailed discussion.</ref>\n\nNonetheless, Olmec society is thought to lack many of the institutions of later civilizations, such as a standing army or priestly caste.<ref>Serra Puche et al., p. 36, who argue that \"While Olmec art sometimes represents leaders, priests, and possibly soldiers, it is difficult to imagine that such institutions as the army, priest caste, or administrative-political groups were already fully developed by Olmec times.\" They go on to downplay the possibility of a strong central government.</ref> And there is no evidence that San Lorenzo or La Venta controlled, even during their heyday, all of the Olmec heartland.<ref>Pool, p. 20.</ref> There is some doubt, for example, that La Venta controlled even Arroyo Sonso, only some {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} away.<ref>Pool, p. 164.</ref> Studies of the Tuxtla Mountain settlements, some {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} away, indicate that this area was composed of more or less egalitarian communities outside the control of lowland centers.<ref>Pool, p. 175.</ref>\n\n==Trade==\nThe wide diffusion of Olmec artifacts and \"Olmecoid\" iconography throughout much of Mesoamerica indicates the existence of extensive long-distance trade networks. Exotic, prestigious and high-value materials such as [[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] and marine shell were moved in significant quantities across large distances. Some of the reasons for trade revolve around the lack of obsidian in the heartland. The Olmec used obsidian in many tools because worked edges were very sharp and durable. Most of the obsidian found has been traced back to Guatemala showing the extensive trade.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2013.01.033|title=Early Olmec obsidian trade and economic organization at San Lorenzo|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=40|issue=6|pages=2784\u20132798|year=2013|last1=Hirth|first1=Kenneth|last2=Cyphers|first2=Ann|last3=Cobean|first3=Robert|last4=De Le\u00f3n|first4=Jason|last5=Glascock|first5=Michael D.}}</ref> While the Olmec were not the first in Mesoamerica to organize long-distance exchanges of goods, the Olmec period saw a significant expansion in interregional trade routes, more variety in material goods exchanged and a greater diversity in the sources from which the base materials were obtained.\n\n==Village life and diet==\nDespite their size and deliberate urban design, which was copied by other centers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chiapadecorzo.byu.edu/ |title=Chiapa de Corzo Archaeological Project |accessdate=2012-03-18 |publisher=[[Brigham Young University]]}}</ref> San Lorenzo and La Venta were largely ceremonial centers, and the majority of the Olmec lived in villages similar to present-day villages and hamlets in Tabasco and Veracruz.<ref>Except where otherwise (foot)noted, this '''Village life and diet''' section is referenced to Diehl (2004), Davies, and Pope et al.</ref>\n\nThese villages were located on higher ground and consisted of several scattered houses. A modest temple may have been associated with the larger villages. The individual dwellings would consist of a house, an associated lean-to, and one or more storage pits (similar in function to a [[root cellar]]). A nearby garden was used for medicinal and cooking herbs and for smaller crops, such as the domesticated [[sunflower]]. Fruit trees, such as [[avocado]] or [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]], were probably available nearby.\n\nAlthough the river banks were used to plant crops between flooding periods, the Olmecs probably also practiced [[swidden]] (or slash-and-burn) agriculture to clear the forests and shrubs, and to provide new fields once the old fields were exhausted.<ref>Pohl.</ref> Fields were located outside the village, and were used for maize, beans, [[Cucurbitaceae|squash]], [[manioc]], and sweet potato. Based on archaeological studies of two villages in the Tuxtlas Mountains, it is known that maize cultivation became increasingly important to the Olmec over time, although the diet remained fairly diverse.<ref>VanDerwarker, p. 195, and Lawler, ''Archaeology'' (2007), p. 23, quoting VanDerwarker.</ref>\n\nThe fruits and vegetables were supplemented with fish, turtle, snake, and mollusks from the nearby rivers, and crabs and shellfish in the coastal areas. Birds were available as food sources, as were game including [[peccary]], [[opossum]], [[raccoon]], rabbit, and in particular, [[deer]].<ref>VanDerwarker, pp. 141\u2013144.</ref> Despite the wide range of hunting and fishing available, [[midden]] surveys in San Lorenzo have found that the domesticated dog was the single most plentiful source of animal protein.<ref>Davies, p. 39.</ref>\n\n==History of archaeological research==\n[[File:Kunz Axe.jpg|upright|thumb|Kunz Axe; 1000-400 BCE; [[jadeite]]; height: 31 cm (12{{fraction|3|16}} in.), width 16 cm (6{{fraction|5|16}} in.), 11 cm (4{{fraction|5|16}} in.); [[American Museum of Natural History]] ([[Washington D.C.]], USA).

In 1869, the Mexican antiquarian traveller [[Jos\u00e9 Melgar y Serrano]] published a description of the first Olmec monument to have been found ''[[in situ]]''. This monument&nbsp;\u2013 the colossal head now labelled [[Tres Zapotes Monument A]]&nbsp;\u2013 had been discovered in the late 1850s by a farm worker clearing forested land on a ''[[hacienda]]'' in Veracruz. Hearing about the curious find while travelling through the region, Melgar y Serrano first visited the site in 1862 to see for himself and complete the partially exposed sculpture's excavation. His description of the object, published several years later after further visits to the site, represents the earliest documented report of an artifact of what is now known as the Olmec culture.<ref>See translated excerpt from Melgar y Serrano's original 1869 report, reprinted in Adams (1991), p. 56. See also Pool (2007), pp. 1, 35 and Stirling (1968), p. 8.</ref>\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, Olmec artifacts such as the Kunz Axe (right) came to light and were subsequently recognized as belonging to a unique artistic tradition.\n\n[[Frans Blom]] and [[Oliver La Farge]] made the first detailed descriptions of [[La Venta]] and [[San Martin Pajapan Monument 1]] during their 1925 expedition. However, at this time, most archaeologists assumed the Olmec were contemporaneous with the Maya&nbsp;\u2013 even Blom and La Farge were, in their own words, \"inclined to ascribe them to the Maya culture\".<ref>Quoted in Coe (1968), p. 40.</ref>\n\n[[Matthew Stirling]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] conducted the first detailed scientific excavations of Olmec sites in the 1930s and 1940s. Stirling, along with art historian [[Miguel Covarrubias]], became convinced that the Olmec predated most other known Mesoamerican civilizations.<ref>Coe (1968), pp. 42\u201350.</ref>\n\nIn counterpoint to Stirling, [[Miguel Covarrubias|Covarrubias]], and [[Alfonso Caso]], however, Mayanists [[J. Eric S. Thompson|J. Eric Thompson]] and [[Sylvanus Morley]] argued for Classic-era dates for the Olmec artifacts. The question of Olmec chronology came to a head at a 1942 [[Tuxtla Gutierrez]] conference, where Alfonso Caso declared that the Olmecs were the \"mother culture\" (\"''cultura madre''\") of Mesoamerica.<ref>\"Esta gran cultura, que encontramos en niveles antiguos, es sin duda madre de otras culturas, como la maya, la teotihuacana, la zapoteca, la de El Taj\u00edn, y otras\" (\"This great culture, which we encounter in ancient levels, is without a doubt mother of other cultures, like the Maya, the Teotihuacana, the Zapotec, that of El Tajin, and others\".) Caso (1942), p. 46.</ref>\n\nShortly after the conference, [[radiocarbon dating]] proved the antiquity of the Olmec civilization, although the \"mother culture\" question generated considerable debate even 60 years later.<ref>Coe (1968), p. 50.</ref>\n\n===Etymology===\nThe name \"Olmec\" means \"rubber people\" in [[Nahuatl]], the language of the [[Aztec]], and was the Aztec name for the people who lived in the Gulf Lowlands in the 15th and 16th centuries, some 2000 years after the Olmec culture died out. The term \"rubber people\" refers to the ancient practice, spanning from ancient Olmecs to Aztecs, of extracting [[latex]] from ''[[Castilla elastica]]'', a [[rubber tree]] in the area. The juice of a local vine, ''[[Ipomoea alba]],'' was then mixed with this latex to create rubber as early as 1600&nbsp;BCE.<ref name = \"MIT\">[http://web.mit.edu/org/m/materialculture/www/rubberprocessing.html Rubber Processing], MIT.</ref>\n\nEarly modern explorers and archaeologists, however, mistakenly applied the name \"Olmec\" to the rediscovered ruins and artifacts in the heartland decades before it was understood that these were not created by the people the Aztecs knew as the \"Olmec\", but rather a culture that was 2000 years older. Despite the mistaken identity, the name has stuck.<ref>Diehl, p. 14.</ref>\n\nIt is not known what name the ancient Olmec used for themselves; some later Mesoamerican accounts seem to refer to the ancient Olmec as \"[[Tamoanchan]]\".<ref>Coe (2002) refers to an old Nahuatl poem cited by [[Miguel Leon-Portilla]], which itself refers to a land called \"Tamoanchan\":<blockquote>in a certain era<br />which no one can reckon<br />which no one can remember<br />[where] there was a government for a long time\".</blockquote> Coe interprets Tamoanchan as a Mayan language word meaning 'Land of Rain or Mist' (p. 61).</ref> A contemporary term sometimes used for the Olmec culture is ''tenocelome'', meaning \"mouth of the [[jaguar]]\".<ref>The term \"tenocelome\" is used as early as 1967 by [[George Kubler]] in ''American Anthropologist'', v. 69, p. 404.</ref>\n\n==Alternative origin speculations==\n{{main|Olmec alternative origin speculations}}\nPartly because the Olmecs developed the first Mesoamerican civilization, and partly because little is known of them (compared with, for example, the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] or [[Aztec]]), a number of Olmec alternative origin speculations have been put forth. Although several of these speculations, particularly the theory that the Olmecs were of African origin popularized by [[Ivan van Sertima]]'s book ''They Came Before Columbus'', have become well known within popular culture. They are not considered credible by the vast majority of Mesoamerican researchers and scientists, who discard it as pop-culture pseudo-science.<ref>See Grove (1976) or Ortiz de Montellano (1997).</ref>\n\nAs of 2018, mitochondrial DNA study carried out on Olmec remains, one from San Lorenzo and the other from Loma del Zapote, resulted, in both cases, in the \u201cunequivocal presence of the distinctive mutations of the \u201cA\u201d maternal lineage.

Pre-Olmec cultures had flourished since about 2500&nbsp;BCE, but by 1600\u20131500&nbsp;BCE, early Olmec culture had emerged, centered on the [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitl\u00e1n]] site near the coast in southeast Veracruz.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Olmecs : America's First Civilization|authorlink=Richard Diehl|last=Diehl|first=Richard A.|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2004|location=London|isbn=0-500-28503-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/olmecsamericasfi0000dieh/page/9 9\u201325]|url=https://archive.org/details/olmecsamericasfi0000dieh/page/9}}</ref> They were the first Mesoamerican civilization, and laid many of the foundations for the civilizations that followed.<ref>See Pool (2007) p. 2. Although there is wide agreement that the Olmec culture helped lay the foundations for the civilizations that followed, there is disagreement over the extent of the Olmec contributions, and even a proper definition of the Olmec \"culture\". See \"[[Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures]]\" for a deeper treatment of this question.</ref> Among other \"firsts\", the Olmec appeared to practice [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|ritual bloodletting]] and played the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]], hallmarks of nearly all subsequent Mesoamerican societies. The aspect of the Olmecs most familiar now is their artwork, particularly the aptly named \"[[Olmec colossal heads|colossal heads]]\".<ref>See, as one example, Diehl, p. 11.</ref> The Olmec civilization was first defined through artifacts which collectors purchased on the [[pre-Columbian art]] market in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Olmec artworks are considered among ancient America's most striking.<ref>See Diehl, p. 108 for the \"ancient America\" superlatives.

This area is characterized by swampy lowlands punctuated by low hills, ridges, and volcanoes. The [[Sierra de Los Tuxtlas|Tuxtlas Mountains]] rise sharply in the north, along the Gulf of Mexico's [[Bay of Campeche]]. Here, the Olmec constructed permanent city-temple complexes at [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitl\u00e1n]], [[La Venta]], [[Tres Zapotes]], and [[Laguna de los Cerros]]. In this region, the first Mesoamerican civilization emerged and reigned from {{circa}} 1400\u2013400&nbsp;BCE.<ref>Dates from Pool, p. 1. Diehl gives a slightly earlier date of 1500&nbsp;BCE (p. 9), but the same end-date. Any dates for the start of the Olmec civilization or culture are problematic as its rise was a gradual process. Most Olmec dates are based on radiocarbon dating (see e.g. Diehl, p. 10), which is only accurate within a given range (e.g. \u00b190 years in the case of early [[El Manati]] layers), and much is still to be learned concerning early Gulf lowland settlements.</ref>\n\n===Origins===\n{{Main|San Lorenzo Tenochtitl\u00e1n}}\nThe beginnings of Olmec civilization have traditionally been placed between 1400 and 1200&nbsp;BCE. Past finds of Olmec remains ritually deposited at El Manati shrine (near San Lorenzo) moved this back to \"at least\" 1600\u20131500&nbsp;BCE.<ref>Richard A Diehl, 2004, The Olmecs \u2013 America's First Civilization London: Thames & Hudson, pp. 25, 27.</ref> It seems that the Olmec had their roots in early farming cultures of [[Tabasco]], which began between 5100&nbsp;BCE and 4600&nbsp;BCE. These shared the same basic food crops and technologies of the later Olmec civilization.<ref>Diehl, 2004: pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\nWhat is today called Olmec first appeared fully within the city of San Lorenzo Tenochtitl\u00e1n, where distinctive Olmec features occurred around 1400&nbsp;BCE. The rise of civilization was assisted by the local ecology of well-watered [[alluvial]] soil, as well as by the transportation network provided by the [[Coatzacoalcos River]] basin. This environment may be compared to that of other ancient centers of civilization: the [[Nile]], [[Indus]], and [[Yellow River]] valleys, and [[Mesopotamia]]. This highly productive environment encouraged a densely concentrated population, which in turn triggered the rise of an elite class.<ref>{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Roger B. | author2 = Linda Black | author3 = Larry S.

The source of the most valued jade was the [[Motagua River]] valley in eastern [[Guatemala]],<ref>Pool, p. 151.</ref> and Olmec obsidian has been traced to sources in the Guatemala highlands, such as El Chayal and [[San Mart\u00edn Jilotepeque]], or in [[Puebla (state)|Puebla]],<ref>Diehl, p. 132, or Pool, p. 150.</ref> distances ranging from 200 to 400&nbsp;km (120\u2013250 miles) away, respectively.<ref name=\"Pool, p. 103\">Pool, p. 103.</ref>\n\nThe state of [[Guerrero]], and in particular its early [[Mezcala culture]], seem to have played an important role in the early history of Olmec culture. Olmec-style artifacts tend to appear earlier in some parts of Guerrero than in the Veracruz-Tabasco area. In particular, the relevant objects from the Amuco-Abelino site in Guerrero reveal dates as early as 1530 BCE.<ref>Susan Toby Evans, David L. Webster, eds, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vZ3DAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA315 ''Archaeology of Ancient Mexico and Central America: An Encyclopedia.''] Routledge, 2013 {{ISBN|1136801855}} p. 315</ref> The city of [[Teopantecuanitlan]] in Guerrero is also relevant in this regard.\n\n===La Venta===\n{{main|La Venta}}\n[[Image:La Venta Pir\u00e1mide cara sur.jpg|250px|thumb|Great pyramid in [[La Venta]], [[Tabasco]]]]\nThe first Olmec center, San Lorenzo, was all but abandoned around 900&nbsp;BCE at about the same time that La Venta rose to prominence.<ref>Diehl, p. 9.</ref> A wholesale destruction of many San Lorenzo monuments also occurred [[circa]] 950&nbsp;BCE, which may indicate an internal uprising or, less likely, an invasion.<ref>Coe (1967), p. 72. Alternatively, the mutilation of these monuments may be unrelated to the decline and abandonment of San Lorenzo. Some researchers believe that the mutilation had ritualistic aspects, particularly since most mutilated monuments were reburied in a row.</ref> The latest thinking, however, is that environmental changes may have been responsible for this shift in Olmec centers, with certain important rivers changing course.<ref>Pool, p. 135. Diehl, pp. 58\u201359, 82.</ref>\n\nIn any case, following the decline of San Lorenzo, La Venta became the most prominent Olmec center, lasting from 900&nbsp;BCE until its abandonment around 400&nbsp;BCE.<ref>Diehl, p. 9. Pool gives dates 1000&nbsp;BCE&nbsp;\u2013 400&nbsp;BCE for La Venta.</ref> La Venta sustained the Olmec cultural traditions with spectacular displays of power and wealth. The [[La Venta#Complex C (The Great Pyramid)|Great Pyramid]] was the largest Mesoamerican structure of its time. Even today, after 2500 years of erosion, it rises {{convert|34|m|abbr=on}} above the naturally flat landscape.<ref>Pool, p. 157.</ref> Buried deep within La Venta lay opulent, labor-intensive \"offerings\"&nbsp;\u2013 1000 tons of smooth [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] blocks, large mosaic pavements, and at least 48 separate [[votive deposits|deposits]] of polished jade [[celt (tool)|celts]], pottery, figurines, and [[hematite]] [[Mirrors in Mesoamerican culture|mirrors]].<ref>Pool, p. 161\u2013162.</ref>\n\n===Decline===\nScholars have yet to determine the cause of the eventual extinction of the Olmec culture. Between 400 and 350&nbsp;BCE, the population in the eastern half of the Olmec heartland dropped precipitously, and the area was sparsely inhabited until the 19th century.<ref>Diehl, p. 82. Nagy, p. 270, however, is more circumspect, stating that in the [[Grijalva river]] delta, on the eastern edge of the heartland, \"the local population had significantly declined in apparent population density&nbsp;... A low-density Late Preclassic and Early Classic occupation . . . may have existed; however, it remains invisible.\"</ref> According to archaeologists, this depopulation was probably the result of \"very serious environmental changes that rendered the region unsuited for large groups of farmers\", in particular changes to the riverine environment that the Olmec depended upon for agriculture, hunting and gathering, and transportation. These changes may have been triggered by [[tectonic]] upheavals or subsidence, or the [[Siltation|silting]] up of rivers due to agricultural practices.<ref>Quote and analysis from Diehl, p. 82, echoed in other works such as Pool.</ref>\n\nOne theory for the considerable population drop during the Terminal Formative period is suggested by Santley and colleagues (Santley et al. 1997), who propose the relocation of settlements due to volcanism, instead of extinction. Volcanic eruptions during the Early, Late and Terminal Formative periods would have blanketed the lands and forced the Olmec to move their settlements.<ref>Vanderwarker (2006) pp. 50\u201351</ref>\n\nWhatever the cause, within a few hundred years of the abandonment of the last Olmec cities, successor cultures became firmly established. The Tres Zapotes site, on the western edge of the Olmec heartland, continued to be occupied well past 400&nbsp;BCE, but without the hallmarks of the Olmec culture. This post-Olmec culture, often labeled [[Epi-Olmec culture|Epi-Olmec]], has features similar to those found at [[Izapa]], some 550&nbsp;km (330&nbsp;miles) to the southeast.<ref>Coe (2002), p. 88.</ref>\n\n==Art==\n[[File:Olmec fish vessel.jpg|upright|thumb|Fish Vessel, 12th\u20139th century&nbsp;BCE.<br>Height: 6.5 inches (16.5 cm).]]\n[[File:Olmec baby-face figurine, Snite.jpg|upright|thumb|Olmec white ware \"hollow baby\" figurine, \n1000 -300 BCE.]]\nThe Olmec culture was first defined as an art style, and this continues to be the hallmark of the culture.<ref name=\"Coe 2002, p. 62\">Coe (2002), p. 62.</ref> Wrought in a large number of media \u2013 jade, clay, basalt, and greenstone among others \u2013 much Olmec art, such as [[The Wrestler (sculpture)|''The Wrestler'']], is naturalistic. Other art expresses fantastic [[anthropomorphic]] creatures, often highly stylized, using an iconography reflective of a religious meaning.<ref>Coe (2002), p. 88 and others.</ref> Common [[motif (art)|motifs]] include downturned mouths and a cleft head, both of which are seen in representations of [[Olmec were-jaguar|were-jaguars]].<ref name=\"Coe 2002, p. 62\"/>\n\nIn addition to making human and human-like subjects, Olmec artisans were adept at animal portrayals; for example, the fish vessel to the right or the bird vessel in the [[Olmec#Gallery|gallery below]].\n\nWhile [[Olmec figurine]]s are found abundantly in sites throughout the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Formative Period]], the stone monuments such as the colossal heads are the most recognizable feature of Olmec culture.<ref>Pool, p. 105.</ref> These monuments can be divided into four classes:<ref>Pool, p. 106. Diehl, pp. 109\u2013115.</ref>\n\n*Colossal heads (which can be up to {{cvt|3|m|0}} tall);\n*Rectangular \"altars\" (more likely thrones) {{citation needed|date=December 2019}} such as Altar 5 shown below;\n*Free-standing in-the-round sculpture, such as the twins from [[El Azuzul]] or [[San Martin Pajapan Monument 1]]; and\n*[[Stela]]e, such as La Venta Monument 19 above. The stelae form was generally introduced later than the colossal heads, altars, or free-standing sculptures. Over time, the stelae changed from simple representation of figures, such as Monument 19 or [[:Image:Olmec woman.jpg|La Venta Stela 1]], toward representations of historical events, particularly acts legitimizing rulers. This trend would culminate in post-Olmec monuments such as [[La Mojarra Stela 1]], which combines images of rulers with [[Mesoamerican writing systems|script]] and [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|calendar dates]].<ref>Pool, pp. 106\u2013108, 176.</ref>\n\n===Colossal heads===\n{{Main|Olmec colossal heads}}\nThe most recognized aspect of the Olmec civilization are the enormous helmeted heads.<ref>Diehl, p. 111.</ref> As no known pre-Columbian text explains them, these impressive monuments have been the subject of much speculation. Once theorized to be [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballplayers]], it is now generally accepted that these heads are portraits of rulers, perhaps dressed as ballplayers.<ref>Pool, p. 118; Diehl, p. 112. Coe (2002), p. 69: \"They wear headgear rather like American football helmets which probably served as protection in both war and in the ceremonial game played\u2026throughout Mesoamerica.\"</ref> Infused with individuality, no two heads are alike and the helmet-like headdresses are adorned with distinctive elements, suggesting personal or group symbols. Some have also speculated that Mesoamerican people believed that the soul, along with all of one's experiences and emotions, was contained inside the head.<ref name=Miller/><ref>Grove, p. 55.</ref>\n\nSeventeen colossal heads have been unearthed to date.<ref>Pool, p. 107.</ref>\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

Scholars calculate that the largest heads weigh between {{convert|25|and|55|t|ST|lk=on}}.<ref>In particular, Williams and Heizer (p. 29) calculated the weight of San Lorenzo Colossal Head 1 at 25.3 [[short ton]]s, or 23 [[tonne]]s. See Scarre. pp. 271\u2013274 for the \"55 tonnes\" weight.</ref>\n\n[[File:La_Venta_Mosaic_(Ruben_Charles).jpg|thumb|left|250px|One of the mosaics from the La Venta Olmec site.]]\nThe heads were carved from single blocks or boulders of volcanic [[basalt]], found in the [[Sierra de Los Tuxtlas|Tuxtlas Mountains]]. The Tres Zapotes heads, for example, were sculpted from basalt found at the summit of Cerro el Vig\u00eda, at the western end of the Tuxtlas. The San Lorenzo and La Venta heads, on the other hand, were probably carved from the basalt of Cerro Cintepec, on the southeastern side,<ref>See Williams and Heizer for more detail.</ref> perhaps at the nearby [[Llano del Jicaro]] workshop, and dragged or floated to their final destination dozens of miles away.<ref>Scarre. Pool, p. 129.</ref> It has been estimated that moving a colossal head required the efforts of 1,500 people for three to four months.<ref name=\"Pool, p. 103\" />\n\nSome of the heads, and many other monuments, have been variously mutilated, buried and disinterred, reset in new locations and/or reburied. Some monuments, and at least two heads, were recycled or recarved, but it is not known whether this was simply due to the scarcity of stone or whether these actions had ritual or other connotations. Scholars believe that some mutilation had significance beyond mere destruction, but some scholars still do not rule out internal conflicts or, less likely, invasion as a factor.<ref>Diehl, p. 119.</ref>\n\nThe flat-faced, thick-lipped heads have caused some debate due to their resemblance to some African facial characteristics. Based on this comparison, some writers have said that the Olmecs were Africans who had emigrated to the New World.<ref>Wiercinski, A. (1972). \"Inter-and Intrapopulational Racial Differentiation of Tlatilco, Cerro de Las Mesas, Teothuacan, Monte Alban and Yucatan Maya,\" ''XXXIX Congreso Intern. de Americanistas,'' Lima 1970, '''1''', 231\u2013252.</ref> But, the vast majority of archaeologists and other Mesoamerican scholars reject claims of pre-Columbian contacts with Africa.<ref>[[Karl Taube]], for one, says \"There simply is no material evidence of any Pre-Hispanic contact between the Old World and Mesoamerica before the arrival of the Spanish in the sixteenth century.\", p. 17.\n\n*Davis, N.

Science and Pseudoscience in Archaeology'' 3rd ed., Trade Mayfield {{ISBN|0-7674-0459-9}}\n</ref> Explanations for the facial features of the colossal heads include the possibility that the heads were carved in this manner due to the shallow space allowed on the basalt boulders. Others note that in addition to the broad noses and thick lips, the eyes of the heads often show the [[epicanthic fold]], and that all these characteristics can still be found in modern Mesoamerican Indians. For instance, in the 1940s, the artist/art historian [[Miguel Covarrubias]] published a series of photos of Olmec artworks and of the faces of modern [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Mexican Indians]] with very similar facial characteristics.<ref>''Mexico South'', Covarrubias, 1946</ref> The African origin hypothesis assumes that Olmec carving was intended to be a representation of the inhabitants, an assumption that is hard to justify given the full corpus of representation in Olmec carving.<ref>Ortiz de Montellano, et al. 1997, p. 217</ref> [[Ivan van Sertima]] claimed that the seven braids on the Tres Zapotes head was an Ethiopian hair style but he offered no evidence that this was an Ethiopian hair style at the appropriate time.

(2005) hint that Olmec iconography was first developed in the [[Tlatilco culture]].</ref>\n\nThe generally accepted, but by no means unanimous, interpretation is that the Olmec-style artifacts, in all sizes, became associated with elite status and were adopted by non-Olmec Formative Period chieftains in an effort to bolster their status.<ref>See for example Reilly; Stevens (2007); Rose (2007). For a full discussion, see [[Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures]].</ref>\n\n==Notable innovations==\nIn addition to their influence with contemporaneous [[List of pre-Columbian civilizations|Mesoamerican cultures]], as the first civilization in Mesoamerica, the Olmecs are credited, or speculatively credited, with many \"firsts\", including the [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|bloodletting]] and perhaps [[Mesoamerica#Human Sacrifice|human sacrifice]], writing and [[epigraphy]], and the invention of popcorn, [[0 (number)|zero]] and the [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerican calendar]], and the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]], as well as perhaps the [[compass]].<ref>See Carlson for details of the compass.</ref> Some researchers, including artist and [[art historian]] [[Miguel Covarrubias]], even postulate that the Olmecs formulated the forerunners of many of the later Mesoamerican [[deities]].<ref>Covarrubias, p. 27.</ref>\n\n===Bloodletting and sacrifice speculation===\n[[File:La Venta Altar 5 (Ruben Charles).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Altar 5 from La Venta.

For example, numerous natural and ceramic [[stingray]] spikes and [[Agave americana|maguey]] [[spine (botany)|thorn]]s have been found at Olmec sites,<ref>As one example, see Joyce ''et al.'', \"Olmec Bloodletting: An Iconographic Study\".</ref> and certain artifacts have been identified as bloodletters.<ref>See Taube (2004), p. 122.</ref>\n\nThe argument that the Olmec instituted human sacrifice is significantly more speculative. No Olmec or Olmec-influenced sacrificial artifacts have yet been discovered; no Olmec or Olmec-influenced artwork unambiguously shows sacrificial victims (as do the ''danzante'' figures of [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]]) or scenes of human sacrifice (such as can be seen in [[:Image:El Tajin Ballcourt Mural (Tom Aleto).jpg|the famous ballcourt mural]] from [[El Tajin]]).<ref>Pool, p. 139.</ref>\n\nAt the [[El Manat\u00ed]] site, disarticulated skulls and femurs, as well as the complete skeletons of newborn or unborn children, have been discovered amidst the other offerings, leading to speculation concerning infant sacrifice. Scholars have not determined how the infants met their deaths.<ref>Ortiz et al., p. 249.</ref> Some authors have associated infant sacrifice with Olmec ritual art showing limp [[Olmec were-jaguar|were-jaguar]] babies, most famously in La Venta's [[La Venta#Altars 4 & 5|Altar 5]] (on the right) or [[Las Limas Monument 1|Las Limas figure]].<ref>Pool, p. 116.

The glyphs surrounding the date are one of the few surviving examples of [[Epi-Olmec script]].<ref>Diehl, p. 184.</ref>]]\n\nThe [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|Long Count calendar]] used by many subsequent Mesoamerican civilizations, as well as the concept of [[zero (number)|zero]], may have been devised by the Olmecs. Because the six artifacts with the earliest Long Count calendar dates were all discovered outside the immediate Maya homeland, it is likely that this calendar predated the Maya and was possibly the invention of the Olmecs. Indeed, three of these six artifacts were found within the Olmec heartland. But an argument against an Olmec origin is the fact that the Olmec civilization had ended by the 4th century&nbsp;BCE, several centuries before the earliest known Long Count date artifact.<ref>\"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar & invention of the zero concept\" section cited to Diehl, p. 186.</ref>\n\nThe Long Count calendar required the use of zero as a place-holder within its [[vigesimal]] (base-20) positional numeral system. A shell glyph \u2013[[File:MAYA-g-num-0-inc-v1.svg]] \u2013 was used as a zero symbol for these Long Count dates, the second oldest of which, on Stela C at [[Tres Zapotes]], has a date of 32&nbsp;BCE. This is one of the earliest uses of the zero concept in history.<ref>Haughton, p. 153. The earliest recovered Long Count dated is from Monument 1 in the [[Maya Civilization|Maya]] site [[El Ba\u00fal]], [[Guatemala]], bearing a date of 37&nbsp;BCE.</ref>\n\n===Mesoamerican ballgame===\nThe Olmec are strong candidates for originating the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] so prevalent among later cultures of the region and used for recreational and religious purposes.<ref>Miller and Taube (1993) p. 42. Pool, p. 295.</ref> A dozen rubber balls dating to 1600&nbsp;BCE or earlier have been found in [[El Manat\u00ed]], a [[bog]] {{convert|10|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} east of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan.<ref>Ortiz C.</ref> These balls predate the earliest ballcourt yet discovered at [[Paso de la Amada]], [[circa]] 1400&nbsp;BCE, although there is no certainty that they were used in the ballgame.<ref>See Filloy Nadal, p. 27, who says \"If they [the balls] were used in the ballgame, we would be looking at the earliest evidence of this practice\".</ref>\n\n==Ethnicity and language==\n[[File:Tumba Olmeca.jpg|thumb|left|Olmec tomb at La Venta Park, [[Villahermosa]], [[Tabasco]].]]\nWhile the actual ethno-linguistic affiliation of the Olmec remains unknown, various hypotheses have been put forward. For example, in 1968 [[Michael D. Coe]] speculated that the Olmec were Mayan predecessors.<ref>Coe (1968) p. 121.</ref>\n\nIn 1976, linguists [[Lyle Campbell]] and [[Terrence Kaufman]] published a paper in which they argued a core number of loanwords had apparently spread from a [[Mixe\u2013Zoque languages|Mixe\u2013Zoquean language]] into many other [[Mesoamerican languages]].<ref>Campbell & Kaufman (1976), pp. 80\u201389. For example, the words for \"incense\", \"cacao\", \"corn\", many names of various fruits, \"nagual/shaman\", \"tobacco\", \"adobe\", \"ladder\", \"rubber\", \"corn granary\", \"squash/gourd\", and \"paper\" in many Mesoamerican languages seem to have been borrowed from an ancient Mixe\u2013Zoquean language.</ref> Campbell and Kaufman proposed that the presence of these core loanwords indicated that the Olmec \u2013 generally regarded as the first \"highly civilized\" Mesoamerican society \u2013 spoke a language ancestral to Mixe\u2013Zoquean. The spread of this vocabulary particular to their culture accompanied the diffusion of other Olmec cultural and artistic traits that appears in the archaeological record of other Mesoamerican societies.\n\nMixe\u2013Zoque specialist [[S\u00f8ren Wichmann]] first critiqued this theory on the basis that most of the Mixe\u2013Zoquean loans seemed to originate only from the Zoquean branch of the family. This implied the loanword transmission occurred in the period ''after'' the two branches of the language family split, placing the time of the borrowings outside of the Olmec period.<ref>Wichmann (1995).</ref> However, new evidence has pushed back the proposed date for the split of Mixean and Zoquean languages to a period within the Olmec era.<ref name=\"Wichmann, Beliaev 2008\">Wichmann, Beliaev & Davletshin, (in press Sep 2008).</ref> Based on this dating, the architectural and archaeological patterns and the particulars of the vocabulary loaned to other Mesoamerican languages from Mixe\u2013Zoquean, Wichmann now suggests that the Olmecs of San Lorenzo spoke proto-Mixe and the Olmecs of La Venta spoke proto-Zoque.<ref name=\"Wichmann, Beliaev 2008\"/>\n\nAt least the fact that the Mixe\u2013Zoquean languages are still spoken in an area corresponding roughly to the [[Olmec heartland]], and are historically known to have been spoken there, leads most scholars to assume that the Olmec spoke one or more Mixe\u2013Zoquean languages.<ref>See Pool, p.&nbsp;6, or Diehl, p.&nbsp;85.</ref>\n\n==Religion and mythology==\n{{Main|Olmec religion}}\n[[File:Olmec King.jpg|thumb|upright|Olmec Chief or King. Relief from [[La Venta]] Archaeological Site in [[Tabasco]].]]\nOlmec religious activities were performed by a combination of rulers, full-time priests, and [[shaman]]s. The rulers seem to have been the most important religious figures, with their links to the Olmec deities or supernaturals providing legitimacy for their rule.<ref>Diehl, p. 106. See also J. E. Clark, p. 343, who says \"much of the art of La Venta appears to have been dedicated to rulers who dressed as gods, or to the gods themselves\".</ref> There is also considerable evidence for shamans in the Olmec archaeological record, particularly in the so-called \"[[Olmec figurine#Transformation figures|transformation figures]]\".<ref>Diehl, p. 106.</ref>\n\nAs Olmec mythology has left no documents comparable to the [[Popul Vuh]] from [[Maya mythology]], any exposition of Olmec mythology must be based on interpretations of surviving monumental and portable art (such as the ''Se\u00f1or de Las Limas'' statue at the Xalapa Museum), and comparisons with other Mesoamerican mythologies. Olmec art shows that such deities as the [[Feathered Serpent (deity)|Feathered Serpent]] and a rain supernatural were already in the Mesoamerican pantheon in Olmec times.<ref>Diehl, pp. 103\u2013104.</ref>\n\n==Social and political organization==\nLittle is directly known about the societal or political structure of Olmec society. Although it is assumed by most researchers that the colossal heads and several other sculptures represent rulers, nothing has been found like the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[stelae]] ([[:Image:Catherwood stela d.jpg|see drawing]]) which name specific rulers and provide the dates of their rule.<ref>See, for example, Cyphers (1996), p. 156.</ref>\n\nInstead, archaeologists relied on the data that they had, such as large- and small-scale site surveys. These provided evidence of considerable centralization within the Olmec region, first at San Lorenzo and then at La Venta \u2013 no other Olmec sites come close to these in terms of area or in the quantity and quality of architecture and sculpture.<ref>See Santley, et al., p.4, for a discussion of Mesoamerican centralization and decentralization. See Cyphers (1999) for a discussion of the meaning of monument placement.</ref>\n\nThis evidence of geographic and demographic centralization leads archaeologists to propose that Olmec society itself was hierarchical, concentrated first at San Lorenzo and then at La Venta, with an elite that was able to use their control over materials such as water and monumental stone to exert command and legitimize their regime.<ref>See Cyphers (1999) for a more detailed discussion.</ref>\n\nNonetheless, Olmec society is thought to lack many of the institutions of later civilizations, such as a standing army or priestly caste.<ref>Serra Puche et al., p. 36, who argue that \"While Olmec art sometimes represents leaders, priests, and possibly soldiers, it is difficult to imagine that such institutions as the army, priest caste, or administrative-political groups were already fully developed by Olmec times.\" They go on to downplay the possibility of a strong central government.</ref> And there is no evidence that San Lorenzo or La Venta controlled, even during their heyday, all of the Olmec heartland.<ref>Pool, p. 20.</ref> There is some doubt, for example, that La Venta controlled even Arroyo Sonso, only some {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} away.<ref>Pool, p. 164.</ref> Studies of the Tuxtla Mountain settlements, some {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} away, indicate that this area was composed of more or less egalitarian communities outside the control of lowland centers.<ref>Pool, p. 175.</ref>\n\n==Trade==\nThe wide diffusion of Olmec artifacts and \"Olmecoid\" iconography throughout much of Mesoamerica indicates the existence of extensive long-distance trade networks. Exotic, prestigious and high-value materials such as [[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] and marine shell were moved in significant quantities across large distances. Some of the reasons for trade revolve around the lack of obsidian in the heartland. The Olmec used obsidian in many tools because worked edges were very sharp and durable. Most of the obsidian found has been traced back to Guatemala showing the extensive trade.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2013.01.033|title=Early Olmec obsidian trade and economic organization at San Lorenzo|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=40|issue=6|pages=2784\u20132798|year=2013|last1=Hirth|first1=Kenneth|last2=Cyphers|first2=Ann|last3=Cobean|first3=Robert|last4=De Le\u00f3n|first4=Jason|last5=Glascock|first5=Michael D.}}</ref> While the Olmec were not the first in Mesoamerica to organize long-distance exchanges of goods, the Olmec period saw a significant expansion in interregional trade routes, more variety in material goods exchanged and a greater diversity in the sources from which the base materials were obtained.\n\n==Village life and diet==\nDespite their size and deliberate urban design, which was copied by other centers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chiapadecorzo.byu.edu/ |title=Chiapa de Corzo Archaeological Project |accessdate=2012-03-18 |publisher=[[Brigham Young University]]}}</ref> San Lorenzo and La Venta were largely ceremonial centers, and the majority of the Olmec lived in villages similar to present-day villages and hamlets in Tabasco and Veracruz.<ref>Except where otherwise (foot)noted, this '''Village life and diet''' section is referenced to Diehl (2004), Davies, and Pope et al.</ref>\n\nThese villages were located on higher ground and consisted of several scattered houses. A modest temple may have been associated with the larger villages. The individual dwellings would consist of a house, an associated lean-to, and one or more storage pits (similar in function to a [[root cellar]]). A nearby garden was used for medicinal and cooking herbs and for smaller crops, such as the domesticated [[sunflower]]. Fruit trees, such as [[avocado]] or [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]], were probably available nearby.\n\nAlthough the river banks were used to plant crops between flooding periods, the Olmecs probably also practiced [[swidden]] (or slash-and-burn) agriculture to clear the forests and shrubs, and to provide new fields once the old fields were exhausted.<ref>Pohl.</ref> Fields were located outside the village, and were used for maize, beans, [[Cucurbitaceae|squash]], [[manioc]], and sweet potato. Based on archaeological studies of two villages in the Tuxtlas Mountains, it is known that maize cultivation became increasingly important to the Olmec over time, although the diet remained fairly diverse.<ref>VanDerwarker, p. 195, and Lawler, ''Archaeology'' (2007), p. 23, quoting VanDerwarker.</ref>\n\nThe fruits and vegetables were supplemented with fish, turtle, snake, and mollusks from the nearby rivers, and crabs and shellfish in the coastal areas. Birds were available as food sources, as were game including [[peccary]], [[opossum]], [[raccoon]], rabbit, and in particular, [[deer]].<ref>VanDerwarker, pp. 141\u2013144.</ref> Despite the wide range of hunting and fishing available, [[midden]] surveys in San Lorenzo have found that the domesticated dog was the single most plentiful source of animal protein.<ref>Davies, p. 39.</ref>\n\n==History of archaeological research==\n[[File:Kunz Axe.jpg|upright|thumb|Kunz Axe; 1000-400 BCE; [[jadeite]]; height: 31 cm (12{{fraction|3|16}} in.), width 16 cm (6{{fraction|5|16}} in.), 11 cm (4{{fraction|5|16}} in.); [[American Museum of Natural History]] ([[Washington D.C.]], USA).

In 1869, the Mexican antiquarian traveller [[Jos\u00e9 Melgar y Serrano]] published a description of the first Olmec monument to have been found ''[[in situ]]''. This monument&nbsp;\u2013 the colossal head now labelled [[Tres Zapotes Monument A]]&nbsp;\u2013 had been discovered in the late 1850s by a farm worker clearing forested land on a ''[[hacienda]]'' in Veracruz. Hearing about the curious find while travelling through the region, Melgar y Serrano first visited the site in 1862 to see for himself and complete the partially exposed sculpture's excavation. His description of the object, published several years later after further visits to the site, represents the earliest documented report of an artifact of what is now known as the Olmec culture.<ref>See translated excerpt from Melgar y Serrano's original 1869 report, reprinted in Adams (1991), p. 56. See also Pool (2007), pp. 1, 35 and Stirling (1968), p. 8.</ref>\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, Olmec artifacts such as the Kunz Axe (right) came to light and were subsequently recognized as belonging to a unique artistic tradition.\n\n[[Frans Blom]] and [[Oliver La Farge]] made the first detailed descriptions of [[La Venta]] and [[San Martin Pajapan Monument 1]] during their 1925 expedition. However, at this time, most archaeologists assumed the Olmec were contemporaneous with the Maya&nbsp;\u2013 even Blom and La Farge were, in their own words, \"inclined to ascribe them to the Maya culture\".<ref>Quoted in Coe (1968), p. 40.</ref>\n\n[[Matthew Stirling]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] conducted the first detailed scientific excavations of Olmec sites in the 1930s and 1940s. Stirling, along with art historian [[Miguel Covarrubias]], became convinced that the Olmec predated most other known Mesoamerican civilizations.<ref>Coe (1968), pp. 42\u201350.</ref>\n\nIn counterpoint to Stirling, [[Miguel Covarrubias|Covarrubias]], and [[Alfonso Caso]], however, Mayanists [[J. Eric S. Thompson|J. Eric Thompson]] and [[Sylvanus Morley]] argued for Classic-era dates for the Olmec artifacts. The question of Olmec chronology came to a head at a 1942 [[Tuxtla Gutierrez]] conference, where Alfonso Caso declared that the Olmecs were the \"mother culture\" (\"''cultura madre''\") of Mesoamerica.<ref>\"Esta gran cultura, que encontramos en niveles antiguos, es sin duda madre de otras culturas, como la maya, la teotihuacana, la zapoteca, la de El Taj\u00edn, y otras\" (\"This great culture, which we encounter in ancient levels, is without a doubt mother of other cultures, like the Maya, the Teotihuacana, the Zapotec, that of El Tajin, and others\".) Caso (1942), p. 46.</ref>\n\nShortly after the conference, [[radiocarbon dating]] proved the antiquity of the Olmec civilization, although the \"mother culture\" question generated considerable debate even 60 years later.<ref>Coe (1968), p. 50.</ref>\n\n===Etymology===\nThe name \"Olmec\" means \"rubber people\" in [[Nahuatl]], the language of the [[Aztec]], and was the Aztec name for the people who lived in the Gulf Lowlands in the 15th and 16th centuries, some 2000 years after the Olmec culture died out. The term \"rubber people\" refers to the ancient practice, spanning from ancient Olmecs to Aztecs, of extracting [[latex]] from ''[[Castilla elastica]]'', a [[rubber tree]] in the area. The juice of a local vine, ''[[Ipomoea alba]],'' was then mixed with this latex to create rubber as early as 1600&nbsp;BCE.<ref name = \"MIT\">[http://web.mit.edu/org/m/materialculture/www/rubberprocessing.html Rubber Processing], MIT.</ref>\n\nEarly modern explorers and archaeologists, however, mistakenly applied the name \"Olmec\" to the rediscovered ruins and artifacts in the heartland decades before it was understood that these were not created by the people the Aztecs knew as the \"Olmec\", but rather a culture that was 2000 years older. Despite the mistaken identity, the name has stuck.<ref>Diehl, p. 14.</ref>\n\nIt is not known what name the ancient Olmec used for themselves; some later Mesoamerican accounts seem to refer to the ancient Olmec as \"[[Tamoanchan]]\".<ref>Coe (2002) refers to an old Nahuatl poem cited by [[Miguel Leon-Portilla]], which itself refers to a land called \"Tamoanchan\":<blockquote>in a certain era<br />which no one can reckon<br />which no one can remember<br />[where] there was a government for a long time\".</blockquote> Coe interprets Tamoanchan as a Mayan language word meaning 'Land of Rain or Mist' (p. 61).</ref> A contemporary term sometimes used for the Olmec culture is ''tenocelome'', meaning \"mouth of the [[jaguar]]\".<ref>The term \"tenocelome\" is used as early as 1967 by [[George Kubler]] in ''American Anthropologist'', v. 69, p. 404.</ref>\n\n==Alternative origin speculations==\n{{main|Olmec alternative origin speculations}}\n{{see also|Pre-Columbian Africa-Americas contact theories}}\nPartly because the Olmecs developed the first Mesoamerican civilization, and partly because little is known of them (compared with, for example, the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] or [[Aztec]]), a number of Olmec alternative origin speculations have been put forth. Although several of these speculations, particularly the theory that the Olmecs were of African origin popularized by [[Ivan van Sertima]]'s book ''They Came Before Columbus'', have become well known within popular culture. They are not considered credible by the vast majority of Mesoamerican researchers and scientists, who discard it as pop-culture pseudo-science.<ref>See Grove (1976) or Ortiz de Montellano (1997).</ref>\n\nAs of 2018, mitochondrial DNA study carried out on Olmec remains, one from San Lorenzo and the other from Loma del Zapote, resulted, in both cases, in the \u201cunequivocal presence of the distinctive mutations of the \u201cA\u201d maternal lineage.
