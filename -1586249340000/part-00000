He played as a {{rlp|hb}} or [[Rugby league positions#Five-eighth|five-eighth]] and was a noted goal-kicker. In 2015, he became the first ever four-time [[Dally M Medal]]list for the NRL season's best player, and later that year became the first ever three-time winner of the [[Rugby League World Golden Boot Award|Golden Boot Award]] for the World's best player. During his career he had been frequently regarded as the greatest to have played the game.\n\nJohnathan Thurston started his career at the [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]] in 2002, where he won the [[2004 NRL premiership]], before moving to the [[North Queensland Cowboys]] in 2005, playing in that year's [[grand final]]. In that year, he made his debut for [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]], before making his Australian debut in 2006. He was the 2008 Wally Lewis medalist for State of Origin player of the series. Also in 2008, he was named as halfback of the [[Australian Aboriginal rugby league team|Australian Aboriginal team]] of the century. Thurston was the only player to play in all 24 games of Queensland's eight-year State of Origin winning streak from 2006, having played 36 consecutive Origin matches from his debut in [[2005 State of Origin series|2005]]. Thurston broke the record for most points in State of Origin history during the [[2015 State of Origin series|2015 State of Origin Series]]. Also in 2015, Thurston co-captained the [[North Queensland Cowboys]], along with teammate [[Matthew Scott (rugby league)|Matt Scott]],  to their inaugural [[2015 NRL Grand Final|NRL Premiership]].

He recovered from that injury in-time to play in the [[2017 ANZAC Test]] for [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]]. During the Test match, he picked-up a shoulder injury which kept him out of action for 8 weeks. He failed to recover in-time for [[2017 State of Origin series|State of Origin]] game 1; but he returned from injury in round 14, in the Cowboys 32-6 win over the Eels.\n\nAt first it was speculated that he wouldn't be ready by game 2 but was surprisingly named in the lineup for the second game after game 1 was won by New South Wales. Queensland won game 2 in a close one with Thurston injuring his shoulder but scoring the winning points by kicking a goal to convert a late try. Following Queensland's game 2 victory; it was revealed that Thurston picked-up a season-ending shoulder injury ruling him out for the remainder of the [[2017 NRL season]], including the round 14 game (which would have been his 300th NRL First Grade Games milestone), game 3 of the [[2017 State of Origin series|2017 State of Origin]] Series (which would have been his final Origin game), The Cowboys' [[2017 NRL Grand Final|grand final]] defeat by the Melbourne Storm and the [[2017 Rugby League World Cup|World Cup]].\n\nFollowing Queensland's 22-6 win over New South Wales in Game 3 of the [[2017 State of Origin series|2017 State of Origin Series]], [[Captain (sports)|captain]] [[Cameron Smith]] invited Thurston to lift the Origin Shield with him in Thurston's send-off from [[State of Origin series|State of Origin]] competition.\n\n===2018===\nThurston returned to the Cowboys at the beginning of the new season, finally playing his 300th match in Round 1 against the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]] after missing the back end of the 2017 season. Given their Grand Final appearance in 2017 and Thurston's retirement from representative football, the Cowboys were tipped to have another tilt at the finals and potentially another Grand Final, however they fell well short, finishing 13th overall & failing to qualify for the finals.\n\nThurston played his final game against the [[Gold Coast Titans]], producing a masterclass in a tightly-contested game that the Cowboys eventually won 30-26.\n\n==Achievements and accolades==\n\n===Individual===\n*Please note: Due to the vast amount of accolades won by Thurston, this is just a

He played as a {{rlp|hb}} or [[Rugby league positions#Five-eighth|five-eighth]] and was a noted goal-kicker. In 2015, he became the first ever four-time [[Dally M Medal]]list for the NRL season's best player, and later that year became the first ever three-time winner of the [[Rugby League World Golden Boot Award|Golden Boot Award]] for the World's best player. During his career he had been frequently regarded as the greatest to have played the game.\n\nJohnathan Thurston started his career at the [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]] in 2002, where he won the [[2004 NRL premiership]], before moving to the [[North Queensland Cowboys]] in 2005, playing in that year's [[grand final]]. In that year, he made his debut for [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]], before making his Australian debut in 2006. He was the 2008 Wally Lewis medalist for State of Origin player of the series. Also in 2008, he was named as halfback of the [[Australian Aboriginal rugby league team|Australian Aboriginal team]] of the century. Thurston was the only player to play in all 24 games of Queensland's eight-year State of Origin winning streak from 2006, having played 36 consecutive Origin matches from his debut in [[2005 State of Origin series|2005]]. Thurston broke the record for most points in State of Origin history during the [[2015 State of Origin series|2015 State of Origin Series]]. Also in 2015, Thurston co-captained the [[North Queensland Cowboys]], along with teammate [[Matthew Scott (rugby league)|Matt Scott]],  to their inaugural [[2015 NRL Grand Final|NRL Premiership]]. He was also the 2015 [[Clive Churchill Medal]]list for grand final man of the match.\n\nIn 2018, Thurston founded and launched the Johnathan Thurston Academy (JTAcademy) of which is he now the Managing Director. The JTAcademy provides a forum, which encourages Australian youth to access the educational and vocational resources needed to secure meaningful employment.\n\n==Early childhood==\nThurston was born in [[Brisbane, Queensland, Australia]], to a [[Gunggari people|Gunggari]] ([[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]]) mother and a New Zealand-born father.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/01/johnathan-thurston-opens-up-on-his-indigenous-identity-and-that-grand-final</ref>{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nHe began playing rugby league at a very young age for Souths Sunnybank RLFC in Brisbane's southside.

Only [[St George Illawarra Dragons]] coach [[Nathan Brown (rugby league born 1973)|Nathan Brown]] was willing to sign him because he was going to play for nothing. Ultimately, Ayoub negotiated with the [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]] to sign him as he had promised Thurston's mother he would keep an eye on him, and [[Belmore Sports Ground|Belmore]] (the Bulldogs' home ground) was closer to where he lived. The Bulldogs eventually signed Thurston in the [[2001 NRL season]] for 'nil playing fee'.

In round 6 of the [[2017 NRL season]], he suffered a calf injury during the Cowboys' 16-26 loss to the Tigers. He recovered from that injury in-time to play in the [[2017 ANZAC Test]] for [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]]. During the Test match, he picked-up a shoulder injury which kept him out of action for 8 weeks. He failed to recover in-time for [[2017 State of Origin series|State of Origin]] game 1; but he returned from injury in round 14, in the Cowboys 32-6 win over the Eels.\n\nAt first it was speculated that he wouldn't be ready by game 2 but was surprisingly named in the lineup for the second game after game 1 was won by New South Wales. Queensland won game 2 in a close one with Thurston injuring his shoulder but scoring the winning points by kicking a goal to convert a late try. Following Queensland's game 2 victory; it was revealed that Thurston picked-up a season-ending shoulder injury ruling him out for the remainder of the [[2017 NRL season]], including the round 14 game (which would have been his 300th NRL First Grade Games milestone), game 3 of the [[2017 State of Origin series|2017 State of Origin]] Series (which would have been his final Origin game), The Cowboys' [[2017 NRL Grand Final|grand final]] defeat by the Melbourne Storm and the [[2017 Rugby League World Cup|World Cup]].\n\nFollowing Queensland's 22-6 win over New South Wales in Game 3 of the [[2017 State of Origin series|2017 State of Origin Series]], [[Captain (sports)|captain]] [[Cameron Smith]] invited Thurston to lift the Origin Shield with him in Thurston's send-off from [[State of Origin series|State of Origin]] competition.\n\n===2018===\nThurston returned to the Cowboys at the beginning of the new season, finally playing his 300th match in Round 1 against the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]] after missing the back end of the 2017 season. Given their Grand Final appearance in 2017 and Thurston's retirement from representative football, the Cowboys were tipped to have another tilt at the finals and potentially another Grand Final, however they fell well short, finishing 13th overall & failing to qualify for the finals.\n\nThurston played his final game against the [[Gold Coast Titans]], producing a masterclass in a tightly-contested game that the Cowboys eventually won 30-26.\n\n==Achievements and accolades==\n\n===Individual===\n*Please note: Due to the vast amount of accolades won by Thurston, this is just a

The band consists of 3 members: [[Fyfe Dangerfield]], Aristazabal Hawkes and Greig Stewart. [[MC Lord Magr\u00e3o]], a former member, left the band in June 2013.\n\nThe band is based in London,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrasserecords.com/Guillemots_159/biography.html|title=Guillemots Biography|publisher=wrasserecords.com}}</ref> with its members coming from England, Scotland, Brazil and Canada. Their first album, ''[[Through the Windowpane]]'', was nominated for a [[Mercury Music Prize]] in 2006. The band experienced some chart success, with their single \"[[Get Over It (Guillemots song)|Get Over It]]\" reaching number 20 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], in March 2008. Their second album, ''[[Red (Guillemots album)|Red]]'', reached number 9 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] in the same month. After touring throughout 2008 and Dangerfield releasing a solo record, the band released their third record, ''[[Walk the River]],'' on 18 April 2011. The band's fourth album, ''[[Hello Land!]],'' was released 7 May 2012.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2004\u20132006)===\n[[Fyfe Dangerfield]] began writing songs in his native [[Birmingham]] and then in Bromsgrove. His early band, [[Senseless Prayer]], recorded a session for [[John Peel]]'s [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show in 1999. Dangerfield then began songwriting under the name \"Fyfe Dangerfield and the Accident\", and in 2004 he featured alongside [[Misty's Big Adventure]], Mike in Mono, Dreams of Tall Buildings, and X Is Greater Than Y on a promotional CD that was offered free with ''[[Birmingham Post|The Birmingham Post]]'', called ''Broader Than Broad Street''. He then joined old school friend, Paul \"Booby\" Tooby, on his \"Ragamuffin Blues but Holes in my Shoes\" tour.\n\nDangerfield had moved to [[Bromsgrove]], attending [[Bromsgrove School]] in 1988; he moved to London in 2002, where he recruited the current line-up (although Alex Ward was also at Bromsgrove School). He also became a maverick music teacher for [[Cranbrook College]].\n\n[[File:Guillemots1.jpg|thumb|left|Fyfe during a performance in 2005.]]The name of the band is the plural of the name of a group of [[seabirds]] (but most often meaning the [[common guillemot]], ''Uria aalge'') and should be pronounced 'gillimott' (and not with a French accent). The 4-piece have often been joined by two saxophone and woodwind players, Alex Ward and Chris Cundy, who are known as the \"Bridled Guillemots\" (a real-life variation of the band's namesake). Guillemots often use quirky musical instruments, such as the sound of a [[typewriter]] in the song \"Who Left The Lights Off, Baby?\", and MC Lord Magrao has used industrial power tools to create new sounds on their records.\n\nDangerfield, Ward and Cundy are also founding members of the jazz ensemble Gannets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Un |url=http://www.myspace.com/gannets |title=gaNNets &#124; Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's |publisher=Myspace.com |accessdate=13 October 2012}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2020}}</ref>\n\nBirds are the source of inspiration for the band not just in name. For example, their 2006 EP ''[[From the Cliffs]]'' continues the Guillemot theme, the bird's natural habitat being steep sea cliffs.  In their [[MySpace]] entry their influences are given as 'BIRDSONG first and foremost', although the only artist that all the band members have publicly stated as being an influence is [[Bj\u00f6rk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/news.aspx?id=619 |title=News \u2013 Myhab 2011 |publisher=Glastonbury Festivals |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> Their first album features recordings of [[red-throated diver]] (''Gavia stellata'') and [[European robin]] (''Erithacus rubecula''), as well as the line 'flitting like a [[Old World flycatcher|flycatcher]]', a reference to the mercurial movements of these birds, and the song \"Redwings\", after the thrush species of the same name. In June 2007, the band appeared on the [[BBC Four]] documentary, ''Why Birds Sing'', contributing their musical talents to a Birdsong-inspired collaboration called \"The Twitch\".\n\nThe band was initially signed to [[Fantastic Plastic Records|Fantastic Plastic]], who released their debut album in 2006, but after offers from several majors, they eventually moved to Polydor.\n\nThe band released their debut EP, ''I Saw Such Things in My Sleep'', in September 2005, all 1000 copies sold out on the day of release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theindiemusicdb.com/bio.php?artist=47 |title=The Indie Music Database : gUiLLeMoTs \u2013 Bio |publisher=Theindiemusicdb.com |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> The band ended a very successful 2005 opening for [[Rufus Wainwright]]'s sold-out UK tour and began 2006 by being awarded fifth place in the [[BBC]] [[Sound of 2006]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4514016.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; Sound of 2006: The Top 10 |publisher=BBC News |date=6 January 2006 |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> survey. The single \"We're Here\" was named \"Single of the Week\" on the Jungalist website on 27 March 2006, and on 19 June 2006 they played their first ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' performance to promote their third single \"[[Made-Up Lovesong 43|Made-Up Lovesong No.&nbsp;43]]\". It was a memorable show: guitarist MC Lord Magrao played his guitar to a set of mirrors, reflecting his performance to the crowd.\n\n===''Through The Windowpane'' (2006\u20132008)===\nGuillemots' debut album, ''[[Through the Windowpane]]'' was released on 10 July and reached number 17 in the album chart. The album's release date was timed so it would be eligible for the 2006 [[Mercury Music Prize]], and the album did make the shortlist but lost out to [[Arctic Monkeys]]' debut ''[[Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not]]''. It received a good deal of critical acclaim on its release, scoring an average of 81% on metacritic.com's overview of the critical response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/guillemots/throughthewindowpane?q=guillemots |title=Through The Windowpane Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More |publisher=Metacritic |date=10 July 2006 |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> During [[Paul McCartney]]'s \"Radio 1 Legends\" show, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the station, he played some of his favorite songs. One of those was the song \"[[Little Bear (song)|Little Bear]]\", which he called \"a very brave way to open an album\". He stated his admiration for the track's \"beautiful orchestration\".\n\nDuring the recording sessions for the album, the band recorded an EP entitled ''Of The Night'' made up of one song written by each band member. It was released via the internet on Valentine's Day 2006 and performed live in its entirety at the BBC Electric Proms 2006, with the BBC Concert Orchestra. Their performance of Bad Boyfriend was particularly memorable for the band donning animal masks, and Fyfe crying \"Take me to orchestral paradise!\" before the song's orchestral culmination. The EP was eventually released on CD and LP in November, to independent music shops only. \"[[Trains To Brazil]]\" was promoted in September 2006 and was given out as \"Single of the Week\" on [[iTunes]], as their fourth (second chart-eligible) single; a new version of \"[[Annie, Let's Not Wait]]\" was released as their next single, on 15 January 2007.\n\n===''Red'' and brief hiatus (2008\u20132010)===\nTheir second album, ''[[Red (Guillemots album)|Red]]'' was released on 24 March 2008.,<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0011648ZU]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> preceded by the single \"[[Get Over It (Guillemots song)|Get Over It]]\" on 17 March \"Get Over It\" became Guillemots' highest placed single, reaching number 20 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], while ''Red'' reached number 9 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. The album developed with a seemingly different style for each track and one reviewer compared it to \"being like a \u2018That's What I Call Music\u2019 collection except it is all by one band and the quality is better than the average pop collection.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.music-news.com/ShowReview.asp?nReviewID=3130&nType=1 |title=Guillemots \u2013 Red |publisher=Music-News.com |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> The band then toured extensively throughout 2008, concluding with a much-celebrated final UK tour entitled ''Fishbone for a Drink Tour''.\n\nIn an interview in late 2008, Fyfe told the reporter: \"It\u2019s good \u2013 it feels like the end of the first phase of the band.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Terry Grimley |url=http://www.birminghampost.net/life-leisure-birmingham-guide/birmingham-culture/music-in-birmingham/2008/10/27/fyfe-and-his-guillemots-starting-over-65233-22127214/ |title=Life & Leisure \u2013 Birmingham Culture \u2013 Music \u2013 Fyfe and his Guillemots starting over |work=Birmingham Post |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter this, the band went into a hiatus. Fyfe released his first solo album, ''[[Fly Yellow Moon]]'' in January 2010. He toured the record while together with the band and many feared that Fyfe's success as a solo artist could spell the end for Guillemots. Fyfe has since revealed that the band were still in contact and later writing together while he was promoting his solo album. On 18 June 2009, a post appeared on the Guillemots' official website stating that work had commenced on their third album. The band started rehearsing again in May 2010 following Fyfe's solo work and resumed recording on 7 June. The group finally finished the recording of a new album around the summer/autumn of 2010.\n\n===''Walk the River'' (2010\u20132011)===\nIn October Fyfe announced via Twitter that the album was finished, with mastering and final touches supposedly done in November. By December, a message appeared on the band's site informing of the imminent news with a countdown for 13 January, when it was revealed that a secret gig on an unknown location would occur on 27 January with clues for the venue before the date. Tickets sold out in 4 minutes.\n\nTheir third album ''[[Walk the River]]'' was released on 18 April 2011. The album was preceded by the single \"The Basket\", which was perceived as being more like the material on Red, though the rest of Walk the River can be better compared to Through the Windowpane. Upon the release of the album, fans were able to purchase a limited amount of the new album that was signed exclusively by the band. Fyfe and Greig performed a memorable rendition of another single from the album, \"I Don't Feel Amazing Now\", in a little woodland by a disused railway line in North London for WatchListenTell.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_G5p7PtoFs |title=WLT \u2013 Guillemots \u2013 I Don't Feel Amazing Now |via=YouTube |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the album's release, they did a series of secret gigs at Birmingham, London, Manchester, and Glasgow. The Guillemots then played sets at different festivals in the UK and Europe throughout the summer of 2011. In September the group commenced a tour of Europe, before playing four shows in Brazil and Argentina during October.<ref>[http://www.guillemots.com/news.php?id=guillemots-have-confirmed-four-shows-in-brazi ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref> They then returned to perform dates in the UK during October and November, with the show at the Stanley Theatre, Liverpool proving a real highlight. In Liverpool there was a performance of the new song \"Southern Winds\" and during the song \"[[Falling Out of Reach]]\", the band managed to keep on playing after a local man shouted out \"calm down\" after Fyfe had just sung \"calm down\", although the crowd was in hysterics.\n\n===''Hello Land!'' (2012\u2013present)===\nIn January 2012, Fyfe revealed the band had written a lot of new material and was currently recording a new album, while new songs were played at their UK shows.<ref>[http://www.liverpool-live.info/interviews/interview-guillemots-nov-2011 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215093856/http://www.liverpool-live.info/interviews/interview-guillemots-nov-2011 |date=15 December 2011 }}</ref> On 7 May, the band announced through their website that they would be releasing four new albums throughout 2012, under the project title ''The Emporium of Fine Things''. The first, ''[[Hello Land!]]'' coming out the same day on CD and download. The albums will be released in partnership with The state51 Conspiracy and will come out concerning the seasons. The band admitted that ''Hello Land!'', the spring-themed album, had come out a little late. The summer record was tentatively titled ''On Summer Island'', and was due in September 2012 but has yet to be released. In April 2013 Fyfe Dangerfield posted an apology stating that he had been back and forth between the UK and Norway where the album was being recorded but was very excited about the project and hoped it would be completed soon. It is still the band's intention that they release the series of four albums but they had not been able to achieve this in one year as they had originally intended.\n\n==Live performances==\nGuillemots have made numerous live performances since they first appeared in the music world in 2004.\nTheir first full-scale UK tour began in April 2006. After a brief period putting the finishing touches to their debut album, and performing a set for [[Gideon Coe]]'s [[BBC 6 Music]] show in June, they began the second leg of dates in October, which ran until early November.\n\nOne of their most notable live performances to date came in October 2006 at the first [[BBC Electric Proms]] when the band performed 7 tracks with a full orchestra, with songs transcribed and arranged for such a performance by Dangerfield himself. This included a rare performance of the song \"Bad Boyfriend\" where the entire band donned animal masks.\n\n[[File:Guillemots live2.jpg|thumb|Guillemots at Lovebox Weekender festival. London, July 2006.|alt=|300x300px]]\n\nSupport on Guillemots' tours is often varied, usually with two support acts for each show \u2013 one main support who stay with them for the majority of the tours' dates ([[Misty's Big Adventure]] in early 2006 and [[The Last Town Chorus]] for their autumn tour), as well as a first support act, specific to the location. Another common support/friend of the band is [[Joan as Police Woman]], who the band met while performing as support for [[Rufus Wainwright]]. In 2006 they did a ''Take-Away Show'' video session shot by [[Vincent Moon]].\n\nGuillemots have also performed live with political songwriter [[Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly]] and supported [[Snow Patrol]] at [[Wembley Arena]] in December 2006, in a performance culminating in a [[lightsaber]] duel between the band's tour manager, and MC's guitar tech, on stage as Dangerfield played percussion on a tray.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MY_y0t_ItA |title=Archived copy |accessdate=25 November 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615012345/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MY_y0t_ItA |archivedate=15 June 2016  }}</ref>\n\nThe band appeared at the [[V Festival]] both in 2007 and in 2008.

They also played a set on the O2 Wireless Main Stage in London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] on 4 July 2008, supporting acts such as [[The Wombats]], [[Dirty Pretty Things (band)|Dirty Pretty Things]], [[Beck]] and [[Morrissey]].\n\nThey performed the Uncut Arena at the 2008 [[Latitude Festival]] on Saturday 19 July; in addition to this, they also played a live set to a screening of [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[Eraserhead]]'' at the Music & Film Arena on the preceding Friday. The band performed as the first warm-up act, followed by [[Editors (band)|Editors]], for [[R.E.M.]] on 27 August 2008 at the [[Southampton]] [[Rose Bowl, Hampshire|Rose Bowl]].\n\nIn June 2008, Guillemots had their Kentish Town Forum gig filmed and later broadcast on [[Channel Bee|Channelbee]].\n\nIn July 2008 they played an improvised set to a screening of [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Eraserhead]]'' on the [[Latitude Festival]].\n\nIn September 2008, they played at the 2008 Orange RockCorps Gig in the [[Royal Albert Hall]], some of which was broadcast on [[T4 (Channel 4)|T4]].\n\nOn 5 September 2008, they played a gig supporting Travis at The Quarry in Shrewsbury, Shropshire.

The band consists of 3 members: [[Fyfe Dangerfield]], Aristazabal Hawkes and Greig Stewart. [[MC Lord Magr\u00e3o]] was formerly a member, but left the band in June 2013.\n\nThe band was formed and is based in London,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrasserecords.com/Guillemots_159/biography.html|title=Guillemots Biography|publisher=wrasserecords.com}}</ref> however, the members are from England, Scotland, Brazil and Canada. Their first album, ''[[Through the Windowpane]]'', was nominated for a [[Mercury Music Prize]] in 2006. The band experienced some chart success, with their single \"[[Get Over It (Guillemots song)|Get Over It]]\" reaching number 20 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], in March 2008. Their second album, ''[[Red (Guillemots album)|Red]]'', reached number 9 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] in the same month. After touring throughout 2008 and Dangerfield releasing a solo record, the band released their third record, ''[[Walk the River]],'' on 18 April 2011. The band's fourth album, ''[[Hello Land!]],'' was released 7 May 2012.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2004\u20132006)===\n[[Fyfe Dangerfield]] began writing songs in his native [[Birmingham]] and then in Bromsgrove. His early band, [[Senseless Prayer]], recorded a session for [[John Peel]]'s [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show in 1999. Dangerfield then began songwriting under the name \"Fyfe Dangerfield and the Accident\", and in 2004 he featured alongside [[Misty's Big Adventure]], Mike in Mono, Dreams of Tall Buildings, and X Is Greater Than Y on a promotional CD that was offered free with ''[[Birmingham Post|The Birmingham Post]]'', called ''Broader Than Broad Street''. He then joined old school friend, Paul \"Booby\" Tooby, on his \"Ragamuffin Blues but Holes in my Shoes\" tour.\n\nDangerfield had moved to [[Bromsgrove]], attending [[Bromsgrove School]] in 1988; he moved to London in 2002, where he recruited the current line-up (although Alex Ward was also at Bromsgrove School). He also became a maverick music teacher for [[Cranbrook College]].\n\n[[File:Guillemots1.jpg|thumb|left|Fyfe during a performance in 2005.]]The name of the band is the plural of the name of a group of [[seabirds]] (but most often meaning the [[common guillemot]], ''Uria aalge'') and should be pronounced 'gillimott' (and not with a French accent). The 4-piece have often been joined by two saxophone and woodwind players, Alex Ward and Chris Cundy, who are known as the \"Bridled Guillemots\" (a real-life variation of the band's namesake). Guillemots often use quirky musical instruments, such as the sound of a [[typewriter]] in the song \"Who Left The Lights Off, Baby?\", and MC Lord Magrao has used industrial power tools to create new sounds on their records.\n\nDangerfield, Ward and Cundy are also founding members of the jazz ensemble Gannets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Un |url=http://www.myspace.com/gannets |title=gaNNets &#124; Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's |publisher=Myspace.com |accessdate=13 October 2012}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2020}}</ref>\n\nBirds are the source of inspiration for the band not just in name. For example, their 2006 EP ''[[From the Cliffs]]'' continues the Guillemot theme, the bird's natural habitat being steep sea cliffs.  In their [[MySpace]] entry their influences are given as 'BIRDSONG first and foremost', although the only artist that all the band members have publicly stated as being an influence is [[Bj\u00f6rk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/news.aspx?id=619 |title=News \u2013 Myhab 2011 |publisher=Glastonbury Festivals |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> Their first album features recordings of [[red-throated diver]] (''Gavia stellata'') and [[European robin]] (''Erithacus rubecula''), as well as the line 'flitting like a [[Old World flycatcher|flycatcher]]', a reference to the mercurial movements of these birds, and the song \"Redwings\", after the thrush species of the same name. In June 2007, the band appeared on the [[BBC Four]] documentary, ''Why Birds Sing'', contributing their musical talents to a Birdsong-inspired collaboration called \"The Twitch\".\n\nThe band was initially signed to [[Fantastic Plastic Records|Fantastic Plastic]], who released their debut album in 2006, but after offers from several majors, they eventually moved to Polydor.\n\nThe band released their debut EP, ''I Saw Such Things in My Sleep'', in September 2005, all 1000 copies sold out on the day of release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theindiemusicdb.com/bio.php?artist=47 |title=The Indie Music Database : gUiLLeMoTs \u2013 Bio |publisher=Theindiemusicdb.com |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> The band ended a very successful 2005 opening for [[Rufus Wainwright]]'s sold-out UK tour and began 2006 by being awarded fifth place in the [[BBC]] [[Sound of 2006]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4514016.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; Sound of 2006: The Top 10 |publisher=BBC News |date=6 January 2006 |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> survey. The single \"We're Here\" was named \"Single of the Week\" on the Jungalist website on 27 March 2006, and on 19 June 2006 they played their first ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' performance to promote their third single \"[[Made-Up Lovesong 43|Made-Up Lovesong No.&nbsp;43]]\". It was a memorable show: guitarist MC Lord Magrao played his guitar to a set of mirrors, reflecting his performance to the crowd.\n\n===''Through The Windowpane'' (2006\u20132008)===\nGuillemots' debut album, ''[[Through the Windowpane]]'' was released on 10 July and reached number 17 in the album chart. The album's release date was timed so it would be eligible for the 2006 [[Mercury Music Prize]], and the album did make the shortlist but lost out to [[Arctic Monkeys]]' debut ''[[Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not]]''. It received a good deal of critical acclaim on its release, scoring an average of 81% on metacritic.com's overview of the critical response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/guillemots/throughthewindowpane?q=guillemots |title=Through The Windowpane Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More |publisher=Metacritic |date=10 July 2006 |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> During [[Paul McCartney]]'s \"Radio 1 Legends\" show, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the station, he played some of his favorite songs. One of those was the song \"[[Little Bear (song)|Little Bear]]\", which he called \"a very brave way to open an album\". He stated his admiration for the track's \"beautiful orchestration\".\n\nDuring the recording sessions for the album, the band recorded an EP entitled ''Of The Night'' made up of one song written by each band member. It was released via the internet on Valentine's Day 2006 and performed live in its entirety at the BBC Electric Proms 2006, with the BBC Concert Orchestra. Their performance of Bad Boyfriend was particularly memorable for the band donning animal masks, and Fyfe crying \"Take me to orchestral paradise!\" before the song's orchestral culmination. The EP was eventually released on CD and LP in November, to independent music shops only. \"[[Trains To Brazil]]\" was promoted in September 2006 and was given out as \"Single of the Week\" on [[iTunes]], as their fourth (second chart-eligible) single; a new version of \"[[Annie, Let's Not Wait]]\" was released as their next single, on 15 January 2007.\n\n===''Red'' and brief hiatus (2008\u20132010)===\nTheir second album, ''[[Red (Guillemots album)|Red]]'' was released on 24 March 2008.,<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0011648ZU]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> preceded by the single \"[[Get Over It (Guillemots song)|Get Over It]]\" on 17 March \"Get Over It\" became Guillemots' highest placed single, reaching number 20 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], while ''Red'' reached number 9 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. The album developed with a seemingly different style for each track and one reviewer compared it to \"being like a \u2018That's What I Call Music\u2019 collection except it is all by one band and the quality is better than the average pop collection.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.music-news.com/ShowReview.asp?nReviewID=3130&nType=1 |title=Guillemots \u2013 Red |publisher=Music-News.com |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> The band then toured extensively throughout 2008, concluding with a much-celebrated final UK tour entitled ''Fishbone for a Drink Tour''.\n\nIn an interview in late 2008, Fyfe told the reporter: \"It\u2019s good \u2013 it feels like the end of the first phase of the band.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Terry Grimley |url=http://www.birminghampost.net/life-leisure-birmingham-guide/birmingham-culture/music-in-birmingham/2008/10/27/fyfe-and-his-guillemots-starting-over-65233-22127214/ |title=Life & Leisure \u2013 Birmingham Culture \u2013 Music \u2013 Fyfe and his Guillemots starting over |work=Birmingham Post |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter this, the band went into a hiatus. Fyfe released his first solo album, ''[[Fly Yellow Moon]]'' in January 2010. He toured the record while together with the band and many feared that Fyfe's success as a solo artist could spell the end for Guillemots. Fyfe has since revealed that the band were still in contact and later writing together while he was promoting his solo album. On 18 June 2009, a post appeared on the Guillemots' official website stating that work had commenced on their third album. The band started rehearsing again in May 2010 following Fyfe's solo work and resumed recording on 7 June. The group finally finished the recording of a new album around the summer/autumn of 2010.\n\n===''Walk the River'' (2010\u20132011)===\nIn October Fyfe announced via Twitter that the album was finished, with mastering and final touches supposedly done in November. By December, a message appeared on the band's site informing of the imminent news with a countdown for 13 January, when it was revealed that a secret gig on an unknown location would occur on 27 January with clues for the venue before the date. Tickets sold out in 4 minutes.\n\nTheir third album ''[[Walk the River]]'' was released on 18 April 2011. The album was preceded by the single \"The Basket\", which was perceived as being more like the material on Red, though the rest of Walk the River can be better compared to Through the Windowpane. Upon the release of the album, fans were able to purchase a limited amount of the new album that was signed exclusively by the band. Fyfe and Greig performed a memorable rendition of another single from the album, \"I Don't Feel Amazing Now\", in a little woodland by a disused railway line in North London for WatchListenTell.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_G5p7PtoFs |title=WLT \u2013 Guillemots \u2013 I Don't Feel Amazing Now |via=YouTube |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the album's release, they did a series of secret gigs at Birmingham, London, Manchester, and Glasgow. The Guillemots then played sets at different festivals in the UK and Europe throughout the summer of 2011. In September the group commenced a tour of Europe, before playing four shows in Brazil and Argentina during October.<ref>[http://www.guillemots.com/news.php?id=guillemots-have-confirmed-four-shows-in-brazi ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref> They then returned to perform dates in the UK during October and November, with the show at the Stanley Theatre, Liverpool proving a real highlight. In Liverpool there was a performance of the new song \"Southern Winds\" and during the song \"[[Falling Out of Reach]]\", the band managed to keep on playing after a local man shouted out \"calm down\" after Fyfe had just sung \"calm down\", although the crowd was in hysterics.\n\n===''Hello Land!'' (2012\u2013present)===\nIn January 2012, Fyfe revealed the band had written a lot of new material and was currently recording a new album, while new songs were played at their UK shows.<ref>[http://www.liverpool-live.info/interviews/interview-guillemots-nov-2011 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215093856/http://www.liverpool-live.info/interviews/interview-guillemots-nov-2011 |date=15 December 2011 }}</ref> On 7 May, the band announced through their website that they would be releasing four new albums throughout 2012, under the project title ''The Emporium of Fine Things''. The first, ''[[Hello Land!]]'' coming out the same day on CD and download. The albums will be released in partnership with The state51 Conspiracy and will come out concerning the seasons. The band admitted that ''Hello Land!'', the spring-themed album, had come out a little late. The summer record was tentatively titled ''On Summer Island'', and was due in September 2012 but has yet to be released. In April 2013 Fyfe Dangerfield posted an apology stating that he had been back and forth between the UK and Norway where the album was being recorded but was very excited about the project and hoped it would be completed soon. It is still the band's intention that they release the series of four albums but they had not been able to achieve this in one year as they had originally intended.\n\n==Live performances==\nGuillemots have made numerous live performances since they first appeared in the music world in 2004.\nTheir first full-scale UK tour began in April 2006. After a brief period putting the finishing touches to their debut album, and performing a set for [[Gideon Coe]]'s [[BBC 6 Music]] show in June, they began the second leg of dates in October, which ran until early November.\n\nOne of their most notable live performances to date came in October 2006 at the first [[BBC Electric Proms]] when the band performed 7 tracks with a full orchestra, with songs transcribed and arranged for such a performance by Dangerfield himself. This included a rare performance of the song \"Bad Boyfriend\" where the entire band donned animal masks.\n\n[[File:Guillemots live2.jpg|thumb|Guillemots at Lovebox Weekender festival. London, July 2006.|alt=|300x300px]]\n\nSupport on Guillemots' tours is often varied, usually with two support acts for each show \u2013 one main support who stay with them for the majority of the tours' dates ([[Misty's Big Adventure]] in early 2006 and [[The Last Town Chorus]] for their autumn tour), as well as a first support act, specific to the location. Another common support/friend of the band is [[Joan as Police Woman]], who the band met while performing as support for [[Rufus Wainwright]]. In 2006 they did a ''Take-Away Show'' video session shot by [[Vincent Moon]].\n\nGuillemots have also performed live with political songwriter [[Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly]] and supported [[Snow Patrol]] at [[Wembley Arena]] in December 2006, in a performance culminating in a [[lightsaber]] duel between the band's tour manager, and MC's guitar tech, on stage as Dangerfield played percussion on a tray.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MY_y0t_ItA |title=Archived copy |accessdate=25 November 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615012345/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MY_y0t_ItA |archivedate=15 June 2016  }}</ref>\n\nThe band appeared at the [[V Festival]] both in 2007 and in 2008. They played Marlay Park on 25 August 2007 as one of the support acts to Damien Rice.\n\nGuillemots, along with [[Sons and Daughters (band)|Sons and Daughters]] supported [[KT Tunstall]] at the 2008 Eden Sessions, held at the [[Eden Project]]. The band played a free concert in [[Huddersfield]] on 29 June 2008, along with [[Elliot Minor]] and [[The Script]]. They also played a set on the O2 Wireless Main Stage in London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] on 4 July 2008, supporting acts such as [[The Wombats]], [[Dirty Pretty Things (band)|Dirty Pretty Things]], [[Beck]] and [[Morrissey]].\n\nThey performed the Uncut Arena at the 2008 [[Latitude Festival]] on Saturday 19 July; in addition to this, they also played a live set to a screening of [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[Eraserhead]]'' at the Music & Film Arena on the preceding Friday. The band performed as the first warm-up act, followed by [[Editors (band)|Editors]], for [[R.E.M.]] on 27 August 2008 at the [[Southampton]] [[Rose Bowl, Hampshire|Rose Bowl]].\n\nIn June 2008, Guillemots had their Kentish Town Forum gig filmed and later broadcast on [[Channel Bee|Channelbee]].\n\nIn July 2008 they played an improvised set to a screening of [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Eraserhead]]'' on the [[Latitude Festival]].\n\nIn September 2008, they played at the 2008 Orange RockCorps Gig in the [[Royal Albert Hall]], some of which was broadcast on [[T4 (Channel 4)|T4]].\n\nOn 5 September 2008, they played a gig supporting Travis at The Quarry in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. Miles Hammond, a local 12-year-old who had posted a YouTube video showing how to play the intro to 'Kriss Kross'<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icznuaEA8bo&list=LLS5gqphjcjJJOIU_dah2woA] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref>, was invited on stage to play the intro to the song at the gig.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnotXbPXDCU&list=LLS5gqphjcjJJOIU_dah2woA] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> He and his 13-year-old brother Lewis Hammond were also invited back on stage to play percussion, including scaffolding components, in 'S\u00e3o Paulo', the last song in their set that night.\n\nIn December 2008, they played an exclusive impromptu Super Busking gig in London's Covent Garden as part of Covent Garden's Christmas Delight celebrations. The performance took place in-sync with a visual light display by [[United Visual Artists]] in aid of homeless charity Crisis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coventgardenlondonuk.com |title=Covent Garden London Official Guide |publisher=Coventgardenlondonuk.com |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2009, they played themselves and performed one of their songs in the episode \"Last Night a DJ Saved My Life\" of the TV series ''[[FM (TV series)|FM]]''.\n\nOn 13 April 2012, it was announced the band would headline the Saturday of the 2012 2000Trees Festival in Gloucestershire.\n\n==Members==\n*[[Fyfe Dangerfield]] (also known as Fyfe Antony Dangerfield Hutchins) \u2013 singer, keyboard and guitar\n*[[MC Lord Magr\u00e3o]] \u2013 guitar, bass guitar, [[mandolin]], [[accordion]], [[xylophone]], [[theremin]], [[synth bass]], [[typewriter]], [[musical saw]], [[electric drill]], [[melodica]], [[Melodeon (organ)|melodeon]]\n*[[Aristazabal Hawkes]] \u2013 double bass and percussion\n*Greig Stewart (also known as Rican Caol) \u2013 drums and percussion\n\n===The \"Bridled\" Guillemots===\n*Alex J.

His grandson, [[Charles Auguste Maximilien Globensky]], was elected to the House of Commons in Ottawa in 1875.\n\nAmong the earliest Polish immigrants to Canada were members of the Watt and De Meuron military regiments from Saxony and Switzerland sent overseas to help the British Army in North America.

His great-grandson, [[Peter Gzowski]], became one of Canada's famous radio personalities.\n\nCharles Horecki immigrated in 1872. He was an engineer with the cross-Canada railway construction from [[Edmonton]] to the Pacific Ocean through the Peace River Valley. Today, a mountain and a body of water in [[British Columbia]] are named after him.\n\nPolish immigration stopped during World War I and between the wars, over 100,000 Polish immigrants arrived in Canada.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reczynska|first=Anna|title=For bread and a better future : emigration from Poland to Canada, 1918-1939|year=1996|publisher=Multicultural History Society of Ontario|location=Toronto|isbn=0-919045-70-7|page=8|url=http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/loc_hist/page.aspx?id=3761723}}</ref>\n\n==Group-settlers==\n{{see also|Kashubians#Diaspora}}\n\nThe first significant group of Polish group-settlers were ethnic [[Kashubians]] from northern Poland, who were escaping Prussian and German oppression resulting from the [[Partitions of Poland|occupation]] after the partitions. They arrived in [[Renfrew County]] of [[Ontario]] in 1858, where they founded the settlements of [[Wilno, Ontario|Wilno]], [[Barry's Bay, Ontario|Barry's Bay]], and [[Round Lake (Ontario)|Round Lake]]. By 1890 there were about 270 Kashubian families working in the [[Madawaska Valley]] of Renfrew County, mostly in the [[lumber industry]] of the [[Ottawa Valley]]\n\nThe consecutive waves of Polish immigrants in periods from 1890\u20131914, 1920\u20131939, and 1941 to this day, settled across Canada from [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]] to [[Vancouver]], and made numerous and significant contributions to the agricultural, manufacturing, engineering, teaching, publishing, religious, mining, cultural, professional, sports, military, research, business, governmental and political life in Canada.\n\n==Religious services==\nAll Polish Canadians including their descendants are encouraged by organizations such as the Congress, to preserve their background and retain some ties with Poland and its people. In the past, the most significant role in the preservation of various aspects of Polish traditions and customs among the Polish communities in Canada fell for the Polish urban parishes, which retain the use of Polish language during services.<ref>Henry Radecki, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PBlT4rvc3l0C&pg=PA102&dq=%22The+role+of+the+Polish+parishes%22#v=onepage&q=%22The%20role%20of%20the%20Polish%20parishes%22&f=false  ''Ethnic organizational dynamics: the Polish group in Canada.''

The parish remains the only Polish parish in Atlantic Canada, although there is a Polish mission (St. Faustina) in Halifax.\n\nThe first Polish-Canadian Roman Catholic bishop is Reverend Mathew Ustrzycki, consecrated in June 1985, auxiliary bishop of the Hamilton Diocese. There are Polish-Canadian priests in many congregations and orders, such as the Franciscans, Jesuits, Redemptorists, Saletinians, Resurrectionists, Oblates, Michaelites, and the Society of Christ.
