{"title_page": "\u00c9vian Conference", "text_new": "{{The Holocaust sidebar}}\n{{Antisemitism}}\nThe '''\u00c9vian Conference''' was convened 6\u201315 July 1938 at [[\u00c9vian-les-Bains]], [[France]], to address the problem of German and Austrian [[Jewish refugees]] wishing to flee persecution by [[Nazi Germany]]. It was the initiative of United States President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] who perhaps hoped to obtain commitments from some of the invited nations to accept more refugees, although he took pains to avoid stating that objective expressly. Historians have suggested that Roosevelt desired to deflect attention and criticism from American policy that severely limited the quota of Jewish refugees admitted to the United States.<ref name=\"Wells2009\">{{cite book|author=Allen Wells|title=Tropical Zion : General Trujillo, FDR, and the Jews of Sosua|year=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-4407-0|pages=6\u20138}}</ref>\n\nThe conference was attended by representatives from 32 countries, and 24 voluntary organizations also attended as observers, presenting plans either orally or in writing.<ref>\"[http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/timeline/index_34.asp The Holocaust: Timeline: July 6\u201315, 1938: \u00c9vian Conference].\" Yad Vashem.

They were classified as \"subjects\" and became stateless in their own country. By 1938, some 450,000 of about 900,000 German Jews were expelled or fled Germany, mostly to France and [[Mandate Palestine|British Mandate Palestine]], where the massive wave of migrants led to an [[1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab uprising]]. When Hitler [[Anschluss|annexed Austria]] in March 1938, and applied German racial laws, the 200,000 Jews of Austria became stateless.\n\nHitler's expansion was accompanied by a rise in vicious and violent anti-Semitic fascist movements across Europe and the Middle East. Significantly antisemitic governments came to power in [[Hungary in World War II|Hungary]] and [[Romania in World War II|Romania]], where Jews had always been [[History of the Jews in Romania|second class citizens]]. The result was millions of Jews attempting to flee Europe, while they were perceived as an undesirable and socially damaging population with popular academic theories arguing that Jews damaged the \"[[racial hygiene]]\" or \"[[eugenic]]s\" of nations where they were resident and engaged in [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitic conspiracy theories|conspirative behaviour]].  In 1936, [[Chaim Weizmann]] (who decided not to attend the conference)<ref name=\"CaesteckerMoore2010\">{{cite book|author1=Frank Caestecker|author2=Bob Moore|title=Refugees From Nazi Germany and the Liberal European States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1JdsX3CJOK4C&pg=PA132|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-799-0|page=132}}</ref> declared that \"the world seemed to be divided into two parts \u2013 those places where the Jews could not live and those where they could not enter.\"<ref>''Manchester Guardian'', May 23, 1936, cited in A.J.

Noting \"that the involuntary emigration of people in large numbers has become so great that it renders racial and religious problems more acute, increases international unrest, and may hinder seriously the processes of [[appeasement]] in international relations\", the \u00c9vian Conference established the [[Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees]] (ICR) with the purpose to \"approach the governments of the countries of refuge with a view to developing opportunities for permanent settlement.\" The ICR received little authority or support from its member nations and fell into inaction.\n\nThe United States sent no government official to the conference. Instead Roosevelt's friend, the American businessman [[Myron C. Taylor]], represented the U.S. with [[James Grover McDonald|James G. McDonald]] as his advisor. The U.S. agreed that the German and Austrian immigration quota of 30,000 a year would be made available to Jewish refugees. In the three years 1938 to 1940 the US actually exceeded this quota by 10,000. During the same period Britain accepted almost the same number of German Jews. Australia agreed to take 15,000 over three years, with South Africa taking only those with close relatives already resident; Canada refused to make any commitment and only accepted a few refugees over this period.<ref>Sykes, Christopher (1965) ''Cross Roads to Israel: Palestine from Balfour to Bevin.''

The only countries willing to accept a large number of Jews were the [[Dominican Republic]], which offered to accept up to 100,000 refugees on generous terms, and later Costa Rica.<ref name=Hate/><ref name =crassweller>{{Cite book| author=Crassweller RD|title=Trujillo.

Some advocated increasing immigration to Palestine; others were most concerned with readaptation and vocational guidance to foster assimilation in the countries of refuge; there were those who wanted settlement in unpopulated areas and still others who were primarily concerned with protecting minority rights in European countries. Worse, there was a major clash between pro- and anti-Zionists present at the conference.

Two months after \u00c9vian, in September 1938, Britain and France granted Hitler the [[Munich Agreement|right to occupy]] the [[Sudetenland]] of [[Czechoslovakia]], which made a further [[History of the Jews in Czechoslovakia|120,000 Jews]] stateless. In November 1938, on [[Kristallnacht]], a massive [[pogrom]] across the [[Third Reich]] was accompanied by the destruction of over 1,000 synagogues, massacres and the arbitrary arrest of tens of thousands of Jews. In March 1939, Hitler occupied the [[Resttschechei|remainder of Czechoslovakia]], which now took in a further 180,000 Jews, while in May 1939 the British issued the [[White Paper of 1939|White Paper]] which barred Jews from entering Palestine or buying land there. Following their [[occupation of Poland]] in late 1939 and [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of Soviet Union]] in 1941, the Germans embarked on a program of systematically killing all Jews in Europe. In this, the Nazis had local assistance in at least some cases. [[Jacques S\u00e9melin|J. S\u00e9melin]] argued that local help was virtually always required to identify and organize the removal of Jews.<ref>{{Citation | last = S\u00e9melin | first = Jacques | author-link = Jacques S\u00e9melin | year = 1993 | title = Unarmed against Hitler:  Civil resistance in Europe, 1939-1943 | publisher = Praeger | pages = 98\u2013104 | isbn = 0-275-93960-X}}</ref>\n\n==Reaction==\n[[File:Children rounded up for deportation.JPG|thumb|Jewish children rounded up for deportation to [[Chelmno extermination camp]]]]\nIn her autobiography ''My Life'' (1975), [[Golda Meir]] described her outrage being in \"the ludicrous capacity of the [Jewish] observer from [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], not even seated with the delegates, although the refugees under discussion were my own people....\" After the conference Meir told the press: \"There is only one thing I hope to see before I die and that is that my people should not need expressions of sympathy anymore.\"<ref>Provizier, Norman, and Claire Wright. \"[https://www.msudenver.edu/golda/goldameir/chronologyofgoldameir/ Golda Meir: An Outline of a Unique Life.

It was the initiative of United States President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D.

They were classified as \"subjects\" and became stateless in their own country. By 1938, some 450,000 of about 900,000 German Jews were expelled or fled Germany, mostly to France and [[Mandate Palestine|British Mandate Palestine]], where the massive wave of migrants led to an [[1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab uprising]]. When Hitler [[Anschluss|annexed Austria]] in March 1938, and applied German racial laws, the 200,000 Jews of Austria became stateless.\n\nHitler's expansion was accompanied by a rise in vicious and violent anti-Semitic fascist movements across Europe and the Middle East. Significantly antisemitic governments came to power in [[Hungary in World War II|Hungary]] and [[Romania in World War II|Romania]], where Jews had always been [[History of the Jews in Romania|second class citizens]]. The result was millions of Jews attempting to flee Europe, while they were perceived as an undesirable and socially damaging population with popular academic theories arguing that Jews damaged the \"[[racial hygiene]]\" or \"[[eugenic]]s\" of nations where they were resident and engaged in [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitic conspiracy theories|conspirative behaviour]].  In 1936, [[Chaim Weizmann]] (who decided not to attend the conference)<ref name=\"CaesteckerMoore2010\">{{cite book|author1=Frank Caestecker|author2=Bob Moore|title=Refugees From Nazi Germany and the Liberal European States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1JdsX3CJOK4C&pg=PA132|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-799-0|page=132}}</ref> declared that \"the world seemed to be divided into two parts \u2013 those places where the Jews could not live and those where they could not enter.\"<ref>''Manchester Guardian'', May 23, 1936, cited in A.J.

Noting \"that the involuntary emigration of people in large numbers has become so great that it renders racial and religious problems more acute, increases international unrest, and may hinder seriously the processes of [[appeasement]] in international relations\", the \u00c9vian Conference established the [[Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees]] (ICR) with the purpose to \"approach the governments of the countries of refuge with a view to developing opportunities for permanent settlement.\" The ICR received little authority or support from its member nations and fell into inaction.\n\nThe United States sent no government official to the conference. Instead Roosevelt's friend, the American businessman [[Myron C. Taylor]], represented the U.S. with [[James Grover McDonald|James G. McDonald]] as his advisor. The U.S. agreed that the German and Austrian immigration quota of 30,000 a year would be made available to Jewish refugees. In the three years 1938 to 1940 the US actually exceeded this quota by 10,000. During the same period Britain accepted almost the same number of German Jews. Australia agreed to take 15,000 over three years, with South Africa taking only those with close relatives already resident; Canada refused to make any commitment and only accepted a few refugees over this period.<ref>Sykes, Christopher (1965) ''Cross Roads to Israel: Palestine from Balfour to Bevin.''

Two months after \u00c9vian, in September 1938, Britain and France granted Hitler the [[Munich Agreement|right to occupy]] the [[Sudetenland]] of [[Czechoslovakia]], which made a further [[History of the Jews in Czechoslovakia|120,000 Jews]] stateless. In November 1938, on [[Kristallnacht]], a massive [[pogrom]] across the [[Third Reich]] was accompanied by the destruction of over 1,000 synagogues, massacres and the arbitrary arrest of tens of thousands of Jews. In March 1939, Hitler occupied the [[Resttschechei|remainder of Czechoslovakia]], which now took in a further 180,000 Jews, while in May 1939 the British issued the [[White Paper of 1939|White Paper]] which barred Jews from entering Palestine or buying land there. Following their [[occupation of Poland]] in late 1939 and [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of Soviet Union]] in 1941, the Germans embarked on a program of systematically killing all Jews in Europe. In this, the Nazis had local assistance in at least some cases. [[Jacques S\u00e9melin|J. S\u00e9melin]] argued that local help was virtually always required to identify and organize the removal of Jews.<ref>{{Citation | last = S\u00e9melin | first = Jacques | author-link = Jacques S\u00e9melin | year = 1993 | title = Unarmed against Hitler:  Civil resistance in Europe, 1939-1943 | publisher = Praeger | pages = 98\u2013104 | isbn = 0-275-93960-X}}</ref>\n\n==Reaction==\n[[File:Children rounded up for deportation.JPG|thumb|Jewish children rounded up for deportation to [[Chelmno extermination camp]]]]\nIn her autobiography ''My Life'' (1975), [[Golda Meir]] described her outrage being in \"the ludicrous capacity of the [Jewish] observer from [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], not even seated with the delegates, although the refugees under discussion were my own people....\" After the conference Meir told the press: \"There is only one thing I hope to see before I die and that is that my people should not need expressions of sympathy anymore.\"<ref>Provizier, Norman, and Claire Wright. \"[https://www.msudenver.edu/golda/goldameir/chronologyofgoldameir/ Golda Meir: An Outline of a Unique Life.

Worse, there was a major clash between pro- and anti-Zionists present at the conference.

For further explanation of how these were arrived at see the links above.\n\n===Production car definition===\nFor the purposes of this list a production car is defined as:\n\n# Being constructed principally for retail sale to consumers for their personal use, and to transport people on public roads (no commercial or industrial vehicles are eligible);\n# Fitted with the original manufacturer-supplied road tires;\n# Having had 25 or more instances made by the original vehicle manufacturer and offered for commercial sale to the public in new condition (cars modified by either professional tuners or individuals are not eligible);\n# Being [[Street-legal vehicle|street-legal]] in their intended markets and capable of passing any official tests or inspections required to be granted this status.\n\n===Further limitations===\nFor the purpose of manageability, this list is limited to production cars that are able to reach 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h time or 0\u201360&nbsp;mph (0\u201397&nbsp;km/h) in 3.0 seconds or less for the first list or cover a quarter-mile (402&nbsp;m) from a standing start in 11.0 seconds or less for the second list.\n\n== By 0\u201360 mph (0\u201397&nbsp;km/h) time (3.0 seconds or less) ==\n\nIf an independent time becomes available, that time will be listed over the manufacturer's time regardless if the latter is quicker.

{"title_page": "Arpilleras", "text_new": "[[File:Arpillera.jpg|thumb|A 3D arpillera]]\n\nAn '''arpillera''', which means burlap in Spanish, is a brightly colored patchwork picture made predominantly by groups of women (also known as '''arpilleristas'''). The construction of arpilleras became popular in Chile during the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u201390)|military dictatorship (1973\u201390)]] of [[Augusto Pinochet]]. Arpilleras were made in workshops organized by a committee of the [[Roman Catholicism in Chile|Chilean Catholic Church]] and then secretly distributed abroad through the church's human rights group, the [[Vicariate of Solidarity]].<ref name=\":10\" /> The production of arpilleras provided a vital source of income for the arpilleristas, many of whom had been left in a state of financial insecurity due to widespread unemployment and [[Forced disappearance|forced disappearances]] of their husbands and children, who became known as ''desaparecidos''. Arpilleras are typically constructed from simple materials such as burlap and scraps of cloth. Arpilleras usually depicted expressly political themes through the demonstration scenes of impoverished living conditions and government repression. These scenes served to denounce the [[Human rights violations in Pinochet's Chile|human rights violations]] of the Pinochet regime. In response, the Chilean government sought to punish those who created arpilleras and those who supported the creation of arpilleras. Arpilleras are currently recognized as an example of subversive women's art in an authoritarian political context. However, contemporary arpilleras reflect less political themes, such as idealized rural life.\n\n==Historical background==\n\n=== Pinochet regime ===\nIn [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|September 1973]], following months of political tensions and social unrest in Chile, the democratically elected socialist government of [[Salvador Allende]] was overthrown in a [[CIA interventions in Chile|US-backed]] [[coup d'etat]].

For example, colorful scraps of material were usually cut into triangular pieces and placed along the horizon of an arpillera to represent the wealth and beauty of Chile through various regions and seasons.<ref name=\":11\" /> However, somber messages of injustice in living conditions, lifestyle, or economic opportunities and messages depicting a change in a situation were portrayed through a separating figure, such as a building, street, river, or fence.<ref name=\":11\" /> \n\nTherefore, in addition to everyday scenes of Santiago's shantytowns and the [[Andes|Andean landscape]], the arpilleras often referenced human rights violations and state violence, poverty, and the lack of women's political rights.<ref name=\":5\" /> For example, some arpilleras portrayed bones, body bags, and individuals being interrogated by the military police.<ref name=\":102\" /> Also, some arpilleras would depict scenes of village children eating from large soup pots in communal kitchens or individuals attempting to obtain food by waiting in a line.<ref name=\":102\" /> Other arpilleras also showed women outside the prisons where their friends and family were imprisoned and depict these women chaining themselves to the prison fence.<ref name=\":102\" /> \n\nArpilleras also commonly bore the faces of the arpilleristas' disappeared family members. [[Marjorie Agos\u00edn]], a Chilean-American writer and arpilleras scholar, has compared the visual language with which the arpilleristas demanded justice for the ''desaparecidos'' with that of the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] in Argentina, who wore photographs of their disappeared children during [[Dirty War|the Dirty War]].<ref name=\":4\" /> Many arpilleras also included text stitched into the fabric, with short political messages that demanded to know the fate of the ''desaparecidos'' and decried the lack of women's political and economic rights.\n\nSociologist Jacqueline Adams has noted that in the early 1980s, the Catholic Church grew less vocally critical of the Pinochet regime and dismissed the Vicariate's more radical staff members, which she contends led to a shift in the content of the arpilleras. She argues that the arpilleristas grew less denunciatory in their work and shifted focus from political themes to tranquil images of everyday life, knowing that the Vicariate would reject any work deemed too subversive.<ref name=\":6\" /> Regardless, the images in these arpilleras, such as of individuals diverting power lines to obtain electricity and individuals obtaining water from a pump, still demonstrate the effects of political and economic oppression.<ref name=\":102\" />\n\n==Impact==\n\n=== Women ===\nWhile an estimated 80 percent of the arpilleristas came from poor or working-class households, the remaining 20 percent came from upper-middle-class households.<ref name=\":4\" /> The upper-middle-class women were primarily motivated by the disappearances of family members and the desire to show solidarity with the victims of political violence.<ref name=\":4\" /> While some of the participants arrived at the workshops with preexisting political inclinations, a number having been supporters of Salvador Allende, the majority had been  previously uninvolved in politics and subsequently developed leftist and pro-democracy leanings through the political atmosphere fostered by the workshops and conversation about the shared experience of having lost family members to the regime.<ref name=\":7\" /> As women continued to engage in conversations about the regime, they learned more about the systems of power that control Chile.<ref name=\":102\" />  As a result, women would learn more about their rights by going to lectures and would then protest through hunger strikes, marches, and other means.<ref name=\":102\" />\n\nRegarding domestic matters, the funds that women earned from selling arpilleras allowed women to increase their families' educational opportunities, health, and well-being.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, the work women performed in arpillera workshops contradicted the societal notion that women were only supposed to be involved in domestic affairs.<ref name=\":1\" /> As a result, women suffered verbal and physical abuse from their husbands.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, there were some cases were arpillera crafting was performed by women's children and husbands to allow women more leisure time.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Government response ===\nThe Pinochet government maintained widespread censorship policies over artistic expression.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A nation of enemies : Chile under Pinochet|last=1944-|first=Valenzuela,

forces confiscated numerous arpilleras,<ref name=\":4\" /> while members of the military denounced them as defamatory 'tapestries of infamy' <ref name=\":9\" /> after discovering a parcel of arpilleras en route to Europe at Santiago's airport.<ref name=\":6\" />  \n\nDue to the threat of censorship and government repression, most arpilleras were made anonymously, representing a collective voice of female suffering.<ref name=\":5\" /> Women sought to prevent themselves from being caught by the military police by crafting arpilleras under candlelight behind thickly draped windows.<ref name=\":102\" /> Also, in case the police ever searched their homes, women attempted to avoid arrest or punishment by hiding arpilleras in the lining of their bedspreads.<ref name=\":102\" /> Additionally, when women brought their arpilleras to the Vicariate, they sought to avoid being caught by hiding the arpilleras in their coats and skirts.<ref name=\":102\" />\n\nArpilleras faced censorship for the portrayal of subversive themes and were thus rarely sold locally or displayed in domestic galleries.<ref name=\":5\" /> They were eventually outlawed entirely, though the workshops continued through the end of Pinochet's rule.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nEventually, the government decided to manufacture its own arpilleras because the current arpillera workshops would not cease production and international demand was difficult to meet for current arpilleristas.<ref name=\":11\" /> Scenes of the [[Flag of Chile|Chilean flag]], historical sites, and nature were all crafted into government-sponsored arpilleras by individual artists.<ref name=\":11\" /> The government claimed these arpilleras were \"official\" and also used these arpilleras to create posters.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n=== Legacy ===\nSince the transition to democracy, arpilleras have been shown internationally in the [[United States]] and throughout [[Europe]].<ref name=\":5\" /> Capital cities around the world, such as [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C]]., and Chilean government-sponsored curio shops also currently possess arpilleras manufactured by Pinochet's regime.<ref name=\":11\" /> The arpillera movement has been lauded for its visual representation of life under the Pinochet regime and its subversive treatment of human rights and gender issues, having been displayed in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria and Albert Museum's]] 2014 ''Disobedient Objects'' exhibit.<ref name=\":2\" /> Also, about 500 arpilleras were repatriated to Chile to create an exhibit in The Museum of Memory and Human Rights.<ref name=\":102\" /> Chilean novelist [[Isabel Allende]] has remarked of the arpilleras, \"With leftovers of fabric and simple stitches, the women embroidered what could not be told in words, and thus the arpilleras became powerful forms of political resistance... the arpilleras flourished in the midst of a silent nation, and from the inner patios of churches and poor neighborhoods, stories made of cloth and yarn narrated what was forbidden.\"<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nWhile the formal workshops ceased in 1989 with the [[Chilean transition to democracy|reestablishment of Chilean democracy]], the tradition continued through the work of independent arpilleristas.<ref name=\":4\" />  Modern arpilleras mostly depict an idealized version of Chilean rural life.<ref name=\":102\" /> These modern arpilleras are also produced by machines and sold as wall hangings, cards, coin purses, table runners, bibs, and other types of souvenirs in street markets and tourist shops like the Chile Crafts Foundation (Fundaci\u00f3n Artesan\u00eda de Chile).<ref name=\":102\" />  The foundation established stores in downtown Santiago and the airport to expose tourists to Chilean culture and to provide arpilleristas with the opportunity to sell their work for income.<ref name=\":102\" /> Nonetheless, modern arpilleras have also received criticism because they are believed to depict a generic portrayal of Chile and disregard the political history of arpilleras.<ref name=\":102\" /> However, arpilleras in Chile in 2011 did express political themes that condemned the treatment of the indigenous [[Mapuche]] people by the [[Politics of Chile|Chilean government]].<ref name=\":8\" /> Arpilleras have also inspired stylistically and thematically similar works of art in other countries that have faced state violence, such as [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Zimbabwe]], and [[Northern Ireland]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite

colored patchwork picture made predominantly by groups of women (also known as '''arpilleristas'''). The construction of arpilleras became popular in Chile during the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u201390)|military dictatorship (1973\u201390)]] of [[Augusto Pinochet]].Arpilleras were made in workshops organized by a committee of the [[Roman Catholicism in Chile|Chilean Catholic Church]] and then secretly distributed abroad through the church's human rights group, the [[Vicariate of Solidarity]].<ref name=\":10\" /> The production of arpilleras provided a vital source of income for the arpilleristas, many of whom had been left in a state of financial insecurity due to widespread unemployment and [[Forced disappearance|forced disappearances]] of their husbands and children, who became known as ''desaparecidos''. Arpilleras are typically constructed from simple materials such as burlap and scraps of cloth. Arpilleras usually depicted expressly political themes through the demonstration scenes of impoverished living conditions and government repression. These scenes served to denounce the [[Human rights violations in Pinochet's Chile|human rights violations]] of the Pinochet regime. In response, the Chilean government sought to punish those who created arpilleras and those who supported the creation of arpilleras. Arpilleras are currently recognized as an example of subversive women's art in an authoritarian political context. However, contemporary arpilleras reflect less political themes, such as idealized rural life.\n\n==Historical background==\n\n=== Pinochet regime ===\nIn [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|September 1973]], following months of political tensions and social unrest in Chile, the democratically elected socialist government of [[Salvador Allende]] was overthrown in a [[CIA interventions in Chile|US-backed]] [[coup d'etat]].

One such group, which also helped develop the first arpillera workshops in Santiago, was the [[Committee of Cooperation for Peace in Chile]] ({{lang-es|Comit\u00e9 de Cooperaci\u00f3n para la Paz}}).<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Schell|first=Patience A.|date=2015-05-04|title=Art against Dictatorship: making and exporting arpilleras under PinochetJACQUELINE ADAMS|journal=Women's History Review|language=en|volume=24|issue=3|pages=468\u2013470|doi=10.1080/09612025.2014.967104|issn=0961-2025}}</ref> When the first arpillera workshops were developed in Santiago, the arpilleristas in these workshops gained inspiration from the work developed in the Isla Negra workshops.<ref name=\":10\" /> However, the Isla Negra womens' wool embroidery methods were viewed as too expensive and time-consuming, so the Santiago women developed their own methods.<ref name=\":10\" /> Regardless, in 1975, this church was forced to dissolve.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe [[Vicariate of Solidarity]] was set up under the auspices of the Chilean Catholic Church, and took up the struggle for human rights in Chile where the  Committee of Cooperation left off.

sizes, composition, proportion, colors, and themes were decided by the Committee and afterward by the Vicariate.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nArpilleras were intended to be formally simple and accessible to everyday women with no artistic training. Given the scant resources of the Vicariate of Solidarity and the individual workshop participants, arpilleras were made from the cheapest available materials.<ref name=\":6\" /> Materials used to make arpilleras included flour sacks or wheat sacks typically made of jute, flax, or hemp fibers, scraps of cloth, used thread, and discarded objects.<ref name=\":102\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":11\" /> Most arpilleras were constructed from thick [[Hessian fabric|hessian]] canvasses, with colorful pieces of fabric stitched and embroidered together in [[appliqu\u00e9]] style to form flat images of people, buildings, city streets, and landscapes.<ref name=\":102\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal|last=Nickell|first=Karen|date=2014|title=Arpillera Journeys|url=https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/11602032/Arpillera+Journeys.pdf|journal=Embroidery in the Expanded Field: Textile Narrative in Irish Art Post-1968|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> \n\nMany also included three-dimensional elements, such as small dolls stitched atop the fabric.<ref name=\":10\" /> These dolls are meant to represent the unique qualities of the individuals they are inspired by.<ref name=\":102\" /> Arpilleristas also included more three-dimensional elements by using pieces of tin to serve as pots and pans, matchsticks and broom handles, and parts of plastic pill casings as bowls.<ref name=\":102\" />  \n\nAlso, arpilleristas sometimes chose to elaborate on the meaning of their arpillera by placing a paper written description into a small pocket sewn onto the back of the arpillera.<ref name=\":10\" /> Generally, these descriptions expressed desires for solidarity and detailed the infringement of human rights in Chlie.<ref name=\":102\" /> The paper sometimes also included the arpillerista's name, but arpilleristas usually did not write their names to remain safe.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":102\" />\n\nThere are currently three different types of styles used to create an arpillera:<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n# The Flat of Planar Method: Embroidery stitches from the surrounding area of the arpillera are used to fasten fabric materials to the surface.\n# The Raised or Relief Method: Dolls and objects in the arpillera are slightly lifted from the surface through embroidery stitches.\n# The Glue Method: Contrasting wool that has been glued is used to border the fabric materials that have been glued to the surface.\n\nWhen an arpillera is finished, it is framed by a wool crocheted border and varies in size from 9\" x 12\" to 12\" x 18\" inches.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":102\" /> \n\n=== Thematic content ===\nAlthough arpilleras sometimes depicted scenes of joyful memories, they mostly demonstrated scenes of oppression.<ref name=\":13\" /> Because workshop attendants encouraged discussion about political repression and economic injustice, and at times explicitly stated their goal of generating sufficient international outrage to necessitate a return to democratic rule,<ref name=\":6\" /> the arpilleristas often depicted expressly political themes that may have been chosen by the group.<ref name=\":10\" /> Sometimes, murals were formed by sewing arpilleras together with common themes.<ref name=\":10\" /> Arpilleras were often characterized by the tension between the vibrant, colorful imagery created by the woven pieces of fabric and their serious imagery and somber political messages. For example, colorful scraps of material were usually cut into triangular pieces and placed along the horizon of an arpillera to represent the wealth and beauty of Chile through various regions and seasons.<ref name=\":11\" /> However, somber messages of injustice in living conditions, lifestyle, or economic opportunities and messages depicting a change in a situation were portrayed through a separating figure, such as a building, street, river, or fence.<ref name=\":11\" /> \n\nTherefore, in addition to everyday scenes of Santiago's shantytowns and the [[Andes|Andean landscape]], the arpilleras often referenced human rights violations and state violence, poverty, and the lack of women's political rights.<ref name=\":5\" /> For example, some arpilleras portrayed bones, body bags, and individuals being interrogated by the military police.<ref name=\":102\" /> Also, some arpilleras would depict scenes of village children eating from large soup pots in communal kitchens or individuals attempting to obtain food by waiting in a line.<ref name=\":102\" /> Other arpilleras also showed women outside the prisons where their friends and family were imprisoned and depict these women chaining themselves to the prison fence.<ref name=\":102\" /> \n\nArpilleras also commonly bore the faces of the arpilleristas' disappeared family members. [[Marjorie Agos\u00edn]], a Chilean-American writer and arpilleras scholar, has compared the visual language with which the arpilleristas demanded justice for the ''desaparecidos'' with that of the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] in Argentina, who wore photographs of their disappeared children during [[Dirty War|the Dirty War]].<ref name=\":4\" /> Many arpilleras also included text stitched into the fabric, with short political messages that demanded to know the fate of the ''desaparecidos'' and decried the lack of women's political and economic rights.\n\nSociologist Jacqueline Adams has noted that in the early 1980s, the Catholic Church grew less vocally critical of the Pinochet regime and dismissed the Vicariate's more radical staff members, which she contends led to a shift in the content of the arpilleras. She argues that the arpilleristas grew less denunciatory in their work and shifted focus from political themes to tranquil images of everyday life, knowing that the Vicariate would reject any work deemed too subversive.<ref name=\":6\" /> Regardless, the images in these arpilleras, such as of individuals diverting power lines to obtain electricity and individuals obtaining water from a pump, still demonstrate the effects of political and economic oppression.<ref name=\":102\" />\n\n==Impact==\n\n=== Women ===\nWhile an estimated 80 percent of the arpilleristas came from poor or working-class households, the remaining 20 percent came from upper-middle-class households.<ref name=\":4\" /> The upper-middle-class women were primarily motivated by the disappearances of family members and the desire to show solidarity with the victims of political violence.<ref name=\":4\" /> While some of the participants arrived at the workshops with preexisting political inclinations, a number having been supporters of Salvador Allende, the majority had been  previously uninvolved in politics and subsequently developed leftist and pro-democracy leanings through the political atmosphere fostered by the workshops and conversation about the shared experience of having lost family members to the regime.<ref name=\":7\" /> As women continued to engage in conversations about the regime, they learned more about the systems of power that control Chile.<ref name=\":102\" />  As a result, women would learn more about their rights by going to lectures and would then protest through hunger strikes, marches, and other means.<ref name=\":102\" />\n\nRegarding domestic matters, the funds that women earned from selling arpilleras allowed women to increase their families' educational opportunities, health, and well-being.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, the work women performed in arpillera workshops contradicted the societal notion that women were only supposed to be involved in domestic affairs.<ref name=\":1\" /> As a result, women suffered verbal and physical abuse from their husbands.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, there were some cases were arpillera crafting was performed by women's children and husbands to allow women more leisure time.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Government response ===\nThe Pinochet government maintained widespread censorship policies over artistic expression.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A nation of enemies : Chile under Pinochet|last=1944-|first=Valenzuela, Arturo|year=1991|isbn=978-0393030112|oclc=974129085|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/nationofenemiesc0000cons}}</ref> During the early days of the workshops, Chilean police forces confiscated numerous arpilleras,<ref name=\":4\" /> while members of the military denounced them as defamatory 'tapestries of infamy' <ref name=\":9\" /> after discovering a parcel of arpilleras en route to Europe at Santiago's airport.<ref name=\":6\" />  \n\nDue to the threat of censorship and government repression, most arpilleras were made anonymously, representing a collective voice of female suffering.<ref name=\":5\" /> Women sought to prevent themselves from being caught by the military police by crafting arpilleras under candlelight behind thickly draped windows.<ref name=\":102\" /> Also, in case the police ever searched their homes, women attempted to avoid arrest or punishment by hiding arpilleras in the lining of their bedspreads.<ref name=\":102\" /> Additionally, when women brought their arpilleras to the Vicariate, they sought to avoid being caught by hiding the arpilleras in their coats and skirts.<ref name=\":102\" />\n\nArpilleras faced censorship for the portrayal of subversive themes and were thus rarely sold locally or displayed in domestic galleries.<ref name=\":5\" /> They were eventually outlawed entirely, though the workshops continued through the end of Pinochet's rule.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nEventually, the government decided to manufacture its own arpilleras because the current arpillera workshops would not cease production and international demand was difficult to meet for current arpilleristas.<ref name=\":11\" /> Scenes of the [[Flag of Chile|Chilean flag]], historical sites, and nature were all crafted into government-sponsored arpilleras by individual artists.<ref name=\":11\" /> The government claimed these arpilleras were \"official\" and also used these arpilleras to create posters.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n=== Legacy ===\nSince the transition to democracy, arpilleras have been shown internationally in the [[United States]] and throughout [[Europe]].<ref name=\":5\" /> Capital cities around the world, such as [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C]]., and Chilean government-sponsored curio shops also currently possess arpilleras manufactured by Pinochet's regime.<ref name=\":11\" /> The arpillera movement has been lauded for its visual representation of life under the Pinochet regime and its subversive treatment of human rights and gender issues, having been displayed in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria and Albert Museum's]] 2014 ''Disobedient Objects'' exhibit.<ref name=\":2\" /> Also, about 500 arpilleras were repatriated to Chile to create an exhibit in The Museum of Memory and Human Rights.<ref name=\":102\" /> Chilean novelist [[Isabel Allende]] has remarked of the arpilleras, \"With leftovers of fabric and simple stitches, the women embroidered what could not be told in words, and thus the arpilleras became powerful forms of political resistance... the arpilleras flourished in the midst of a silent nation, and from the inner patios of churches and poor neighborhoods, stories made of cloth and yarn narrated what was forbidden.\"<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nWhile the formal workshops ceased in 1989 with the [[Chilean transition to democracy|reestablishment of Chilean democracy]], the tradition continued through the work of independent arpilleristas.<ref name=\":4\" />  Modern arpilleras mostly depict an idealized version of Chilean rural life.<ref name=\":102\" /> These modern arpilleras are also produced by machines and sold as wall hangings, cards, coin purses, table runners, bibs, and other types of souvenirs in street markets and tourist shops like the Chile Crafts Foundation (Fundaci\u00f3n Artesan\u00eda de Chile).<ref name=\":102\" />  The foundation established stores in downtown Santiago and the airport to expose tourists to Chilean culture and to provide arpilleristas with the opportunity to sell their work for income.<ref name=\":102\" /> Nonetheless, modern arpilleras have also received criticism because they are believed to depict a generic portrayal of Chile and disregard the political history of arpilleras.<ref name=\":102\" /> However, arpilleras in Chile in 2011 did express political themes that condemned the treatment of the indigenous [[Mapuche]] people by the [[Politics of Chile|Chilean government]].<ref name=\":8\" /> Arpilleras have also inspired stylistically and thematically similar works of art in other countries that have faced state violence, such as [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Zimbabwe]], and [[Northern Ireland]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite
