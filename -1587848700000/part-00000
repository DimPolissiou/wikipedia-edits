The 1983 debut ''Holy Diver'', by his band Dio, reduced lush moral landscapes to simple good-versus-evil conflicts, using the lyrical duality of 'Rainbow in the Dark' and 'Holy Diver' to raise questions about deceit and hypocrisy in romance and religion. In the sharp contrasts of Dio's imagery, there was always a built-in contradiction that fed adolescent revolt: a black side to every white light, and a hidden secret behind every loud proclamation of truth. In a similar way, Dio's music balanced torrents of rage with brief acoustic interludes.\"<ref name=\"Christe\"/>\n\nOn [[IGN]]'s list of \"Top 25 Metal Albums\", ''Holy Diver'' is at number 8, and this statement followed, \"In all his bands, in all his roles, in all his musical vagabond choices, Ronnie James Dio has been fortunate enough to be associated with some of heavy metal's best -- Sabbath, Rainbow, and his own band Dio. To best represent his tenure in the genre, one must look no farther than ''Holy Diver''. His first album with his new band was also his best. It is one of metal's best albums, and it spawned two of the greatest metal songs of the '80s: 'Holy Diver' and 'Rainbow in the Dark'. Featuring the underrated Vivian Campbell on guitar, this album showed that Dio could do it on his own.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Spence D. and Ed T. |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/01/20/top-25-metal-albums?page=5 |title=Top 25 Metal Albums -

''Holy Diver'' remains the undisputed highlight of Dio's career...and, indeed, one of the finest pure heavy metal albums of the 1980s.\"<ref name=Allmusic/> Canadian reviewer [[Martin Popoff]] describes the album as \"quintessential traditional metal\", with Ronnie James Dio \"almost single-handedly reinventing gothic hard rock for the '80s, incorporating strong melodic hooks and more than the genre's usual share of velvety, classical-based pyrotechnics.\"<ref name=\"martin\" /> ''[[Kerrang!]]'' gave the album a positive review in 1983 and ''Holy Diver'' ended up at no. 5 in the British magazine's End of Year list of best releases.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/kerrang.html | title = Kerrang!

The 1983 debut ''Holy Diver'', by his band Dio, reduced lush moral landscapes to simple good-versus-evil conflicts, using the lyrical duality of 'Rainbow in the Dark' and 'Holy Diver' to raise questions about deceit and hypocrisy in romance and religion. In the sharp contrasts of Dio's imagery, there was always a built-in contradiction that fed adolescent revolt: a black side to every white light, and a hidden secret behind every loud proclamation of truth. In a similar way, Dio's music balanced torrents of rage with brief acoustic interludes.\"<ref name=\"Christe\"/>\n\nOn [[IGN]]'s list of \"Top 25 Metal Albums\", ''Holy Diver'' is at number 8, and this statement followed, \"In all his bands, in all his roles, in all his musical vagabond choices, Ronnie James Dio has been fortunate enough to be associated with some of heavy metal's best -- Sabbath, Rainbow, and his own band Dio. To best represent his tenure in the genre, one must look no farther than ''Holy Diver''. His first album with his new band was also his best. It is one of metal's best albums, and it spawned two of the greatest metal songs of the '80s: 'Holy Diver' and 'Rainbow in the Dark'. Featuring the underrated Vivian Campbell on guitar, this album showed that Dio could do it on his own.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Spence D. and Ed T. |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/01/20/top-25-metal-albums?page=5 |title=Top 25 Metal Albums -

This signalled the dawn of the proto-historic period and this immigration continued into the ancient and Medieval periods. These were the group of Dravidian Nadiyals came during Kamarupa. At the end of the ancient period (c1205), the first Muslims (Wave 4), captive soldiers of the defeated Bakhtiar Khilji, settled in the Hajo area.\n\n===Medieval===\nThe next major immigrants were the [[Ahom people|Tai-Ahoms]] (Wave 5) when [[Sukaphaa]] lead his group into Assam via the [[Pangsau Pass]] in the [[Patkai]] from South China. The [[Tai-Ahoms]] were followed by other [[Tai peoples]] who were [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (Wave 6): [[Khamti people|Khamti]], [[Khamyang people|Khamyang]], Aiton, [[Tai Phake people|Tai Phake]] and [[Turung people]]s, who settled in Upper Assam and [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. This continued well into the colonial times.  At the end of the Medieval period, a small contingent of [[Sikhs]] gave rise to a minuscule but prominent group.<ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/assamese-sikhs-in-search-of-their-roots/433763/ Assamese Sikhs in search of their roots], ''Indian Express Newspaper, 13 March 2009.''</ref>\n\n===Colonial and post-independence===\nIn the beginning of the [[British Raj|colonial period]] in Assam after the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] and the [[Treaty of Yandaboo]] (1826), the political instability led to the immigration of [[Kachin people|Kachin]] and [[Kuki people]] (Wave 7) into the region across the Patkai and Arakan Yoma. They constitute the [[Singpho people|Singphos]] in Upper Assam, and the Kuki-Chin tribes in Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao. The beginning of tea plantations in Assam (1835) by the British led to the immigration of Mundari speaking people (Wave 8) ([[Munda people|Munda]], [[Santal]], [[Savara people|Savara]], [[Oraon]], [[Gondi people|Gond]] etc. tribes). The British administration in Assam also encouraged immigration of a large influx of service holders and professionals from [[Bengal]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Nepal]], etc. (Wave 9). To increase land productivity, the British encouraged [[Bengali Muslims|Muslim]] peasants from [[Mymensingh]] district of present-day [[Bangladesh]] (Wave 10) to settle in Assam that began in 1901. The last major group to immigrate are the [[Bengali Hindu]] refugees, especially from the [[Sylhet]] district of Bangladesh following the [[Partition of India]] (Wave 11).\n\nInputs from these and other smaller groups have gone towards the building of a unique multi-ethnic socio-cultural situation.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ A temporal model of Peopling of Assam based on ethnolinguistic groups (the numbers in brackets indicate \"waves\" as described in the text)\n|-\n!

A number of [[tribal]] grouping have landed in the soils of Assam in the course of diverse directions as the territory was linked to a number of states and many different countries. [[Austroasiatic languages|Austro-Asiatic]], [[Tibeto-Burman]]s, and [[Indo-Aryans]] had been the most important traditional groups that arrived at the site and lived in the very old Assam. They were well thought-out as the \u2018aborigines\u2019 of Assam and yet at the moment they are essential elements of the \"Assamese Diaspora\".\n\nThe greater [[Bodo-Kachari|Kachari]] group encompasses the 18 major tribes of Assam, both plain and hills, viz., [[Bodo people|Boro]], [[Dimasa people|Dimasa]], [[Chutia people|Chutia]], [[Sonowal Kacharis|Sonowal]], [[Tiwa (Lalung)|Tiwa]], [[Garo people|Garo]], [[Rabha]], [[Sarania Kachari]], [[Hajong people|Hajong]], [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]], [[Deori people|Deori]], [[Thengal Kachari]], Hojai, [[Koch people|Koch]], and others. The ancient land of '[[Kirati people|Kirat]]' is also referred to the land of the Kachari. [[Bodo-Kachari people|Kacharis]] were historically the dominant group of Assam, later the [[Ahom people|Tai Ahoms]] rise as dominant group, the ethnic group who along with the Upper Assam Bodo-Kachari groups like Chutias, Morans and Borahis were associated with the term \"Assamese\". Along with Tai Ahoms, they were other prominent groups that ruled [[Assam valley]] during the medieval period, those belonging to the Chutia, Koch, and Dimasa communities.

Actually, more than 70-75% or more of the now considered non-tribal population of Assam actually have Mongoloid roots and origin and thus were historically tribal. Some of the tribal groups were able to enter into the Hindu upper caste society while some of them remained in the tribal or lower caste society.

This signalled the dawn of the proto-historic period and this immigration continued into the ancient and Medieval periods. These were the group of Dravidian Nadiyals came during Kamarupa. At the end of the ancient period (c1205), the first Muslims (Wave 4), captive soldiers of the defeated Bakhtiar Khilji, settled in the Hajo area.\n\n===Medieval===\nThe next major immigrants were the [[Ahom people|Tai-Ahoms]] (Wave 5) when [[Sukaphaa]] lead his group into Assam via the [[Pangsau Pass]] in the [[Patkai]] from South China. The [[Tai-Ahoms]] were followed by other [[Tai peoples]] who were [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (Wave 6): [[Khamti people|Khamti]], [[Khamyang people|Khamyang]], Aiton, [[Tai Phake people|Tai Phake]] and [[Turung people]]s, who settled in Upper Assam and [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. This continued well into the colonial times.  At the end of the Medieval period, a small contingent of [[Sikhs]] gave rise to a minuscule but prominent group.<ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/assamese-sikhs-in-search-of-their-roots/433763/ Assamese Sikhs in search of their roots], ''Indian Express Newspaper, 13 March 2009.''</ref>\n\n===Colonial and post-independence===\nIn the beginning of the [[British Raj|colonial period]] in Assam after the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] and the [[Treaty of Yandaboo]] (1826), the political instability led to the immigration of [[Kachin people|Kachin]] and [[Kuki people]] (Wave 7) into the region across the Patkai and Arakan Yoma. They constitute the [[Singpho people|Singphos]] in Upper Assam, and the Kuki-Chin tribes in Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao. The beginning of tea plantations in Assam (1835) by the British led to the immigration of Mundari speaking people (Wave 8) ([[Munda people|Munda]], [[Santal]], [[Savara people|Savara]], [[Oraon]], [[Gondi people|Gond]] etc. tribes). The British administration in Assam also encouraged immigration of a large influx of service holders and professionals from [[Bengal]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Nepal]], etc. (Wave 9). To increase land productivity, the British encouraged [[Bengali Muslims|Muslim]] peasants from [[Mymensingh]] district of present-day [[Bangladesh]] (Wave 10) to settle in Assam that began in 1901. The last major group to immigrate are the [[Bengali Hindu]] refugees, especially from the [[Sylhet]] district of Bangladesh following the [[Partition of India]] (Wave 11).\n\nInputs from these and other smaller groups have gone towards the building of a unique multi-ethnic socio-cultural situation.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ A temporal model of Peopling of Assam based on ethnolinguistic groups (the numbers in brackets indicate \"waves\" as described in the text)\n|-\n!

A number of [[tribal]] grouping have landed in the soils of Assam in the course of diverse directions as the territory was linked to a number of states and many different countries. [[Austroasiatic languages|Austro-Asiatic]], [[Tibeto-Burman]]s, and [[Indo-Aryans]] had been the most important traditional groups that arrived at the site and lived in the very old Assam. They were well thought-out as the \u2018aborigines\u2019 of Assam and yet at the moment they are essential elements of the \"Assamese Diaspora\".\n\nThe greater [[Bodo-Kachari|Kachari]] group encompasses the 18 major tribes of Assam, both plain and hills, viz., [[Bodo people|Boro]], [[Dimasa people|Dimasa]], [[Chutia people|Chutia]], [[Sonowal Kacharis|Sonowal]], [[Tiwa (Lalung)|Tiwa]], [[Garo people|Garo]], [[Rabha]], [[Sarania Kachari]], [[Hajong people|Hajong]], [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]], [[Deori people|Deori]], [[Thengal Kachari]], Hojai, [[Koch people|Koch]], and others. The ancient land of '[[Kirati people|Kirat]]' is also referred to the land of the Kachari. [[Bodo-Kachari people|Kacharis]] were historically the dominant group of Assam, later the [[Ahom people|Tai Ahoms]] rise as dominant group, the ethnic group who along with the Upper Assam Bodo-Kachari groups like Chutias, Morans and Borahis were associated with the term \"Assamese\". Along with Tai Ahoms, they were other prominent groups that ruled [[Assam valley]] during the medieval period, those belonging to the Chutia, Koch, and Dimasa communities. The first group ruled from 1187 to 1673 in the eastern part of the state, the second group ruled Lower Assam from 1515 to 1949, while the third group ruled southern part of Assam from the 13th century to 1854. [[Bodo people|Bodo tribe]] also known as ''Boro'' are the dominant group in [[BTAD]]. They speak the [[Bodo language]] among themselves along with using [[Assamese language|Assamese]] to communicate with other [[Assamese people|indigenous Assamese communities]] as the [[lingua-franca]]. \n\nMost of the indigenous Assamese communities today have actually been historically tribal and even the now considered non-tribal population of Assam were actually tribes which have slowly been converted into castes through [[Sanskritisation]]. Actually, more than 70-75% or more of the now considered non-tribal population of Assam actually have Mongoloid roots and origin and thus were historically tribal. Some of the tribal groups were able to enter into the Hindu upper caste society while some of them remained in the tribal or lower caste society.
