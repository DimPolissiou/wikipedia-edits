Italian-built, ''Argus'' was formerly the [[container ship]] {{abbr|MV|Motor Vessel}} ''Contender Bezant''. The ship was requisitioned in 1982 for service in the [[Falklands War]] and purchased outright in 1984 for use as an Aviation Training Ship, replacing [[RFA Engadine (K08)|RFA ''Engadine'']]. In 1991, during the [[Gulf War]], she was fitted with an extensive and fully functional hospital to assume the additional role of Primary Casualty Receiving Ship. In 2009, the PCRS role became the ship's primary function.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Royal-Fleet-Auxiliary/Casualty-Ship-RFA-Argus |title=Casualty Ship (RFA Argus)|work=royalnavy.mod.uk |year=2013 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref> ''Argus'' is due to remain in service until 2024.<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/484506/2015-10463_FOI_Request.pdf</ref>\n\nAs the ship is armed and is not painted in the required white with red crosses, the [[Geneva Convention]] prevents her from being officially classified as a [[hospital ship]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/hospital-ships.htm |title=World Wide Hospital Ships |work=Global Security |accessdate=26 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/health/infocentre/journals/ADFHJ_sep00/ADFHealthSep00_1_3_119_123.pdf |title=ADF Health |work=Australian Department of Defence |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114192735/http://www.defence.gov.au/health/infocentre/journals/ADFHJ_sep00/ADFHealthSep00_1_3_119_123.pdf |archivedate=14 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Design and facilities==\nAfter a four-year conversion at [[Harland and Wolff]] in [[Belfast]], the ship entered RFA service in 1988.  Having been initially designed as a [[container ship]], she would have been too unstable when unloaded, making her motion at sea \"very stiff\" which resulted in a very short roll period which is not appropriate for operating helicopters. Therefore, her superstructure is deliberately heavily built (weighing some 800 tons), and she has 1,800 tons of [[concrete]] [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] carried in former hatch covers, which have been inverted to form tray-like structures.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rebuilding the Royal Navy : Warship Design Since 1945 |first1= D. K. |last1=Brown |first2=George |last2= Moore |publisher=Chatham Publishing |year=2003 |page=146 |lastauthoramp=yes}}</ref>\n\nBeing a former container ship, ''Argus'' does not have a traditional aircraft carrier layout \u2013 the ship's superstructure is located forward, with a long flight deck aft. The ship has a small secondary superstructure approximately two-thirds of the way down the flight deck, containing the ship's exhaust funnel. This is used by small helicopters to simulate landing on the flight deck of a destroyer or frigate.\n\nFor the 1991 [[Gulf War]] ''Argus'' was fitted with a fully functional hospital, which has since been modified and extensively augmented with specialist equipment, providing 70 beds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/our-organisation/the-fighting-arms/royal-fleet-auxiliary/casualty-ship/rfa-argus |title=Casualty Ship (RFA Argus) |work=Royal Navy |accessdate=26 September 2015}}</ref> The ship is equipped with an [[intensive-care unit]], and can provide [[X-ray#Medical uses|medical x-ray]] and [[X-ray computed tomography|CT-scan]] services. Casualties can be quickly transferred from the deck directly into the [[Triage|assessment]] area. In recent years the ship's role as a Primary Casualty Receiving Ship, rather than her aviation training duties, has been considered her primary role.\n\nIn 2007 the ship was refitted with upgraded hospital facilities (replacing the forward aircraft lift with a ramp for emergency exit for hospital trollies and patients as well as two 50-man passenger lifts that lead to a new structure erected on the flight deck), generators and aviation systems (the ship is due to receive an upgrade to its night-vision capabilities enabling the use of [[WAH-64 Apache]] helicopters) to give an operational life until 2020.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/6649989.stm |title=Refit of navy ship RFA Argus ends |work=[[BBC News]] |date=12 May 2007 |publisher= [[British Broadcasting Corporation |BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Service history==\n\n===1990s===\n''Argus'' entered service with the RFA in 1988, replacing {{Ship|RFA|Engadine}} in the aviation training role.

During this period, ''Argus'' operated in part as a [[Landing Platform, Helicopter|LPH]]. Her unsuitability for this role was a major factor in the commissioning of {{HMS|Ocean|L12|6}}.\n\n===2000s===\nDuring times of war RFA ''Argus'' acts as a floating hospital with two fully equipped wards and mortuary.  The hospital was utilised in this way off the coast of Freetown in 2000\u201301, in support of British operations against the rebel [[West Side Boys]].\n\nA programme to replace ''Argus'' called the Joint Casualty Treatment Ship (JCTS) was put on hold in December 2001 after passing initial approval.

a ship of the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] operated by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MoD]] under the [[Blue Ensign]]. Italian-built, ''Argus'' was formerly the [[container ship]] {{abbr|MV|Motor Vessel}} ''Contender Bezant''.

In 1991, during the [[Gulf War]], she was fitted with an extensive and fully functional hospital to assume the additional role of Primary Casualty Receiving Ship. In 2009, the PCRS role became the ship's primary function.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Royal-Fleet-Auxiliary/Casualty-Ship-RFA-Argus |title=Casualty Ship (RFA Argus)|work=royalnavy.mod.uk |year=2013 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref> ''Argus'' is due to remain in service until 2024.<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/484506/2015-10463_FOI_Request.pdf</ref>\n\nAs the ship is armed and is not painted in the required white with red crosses, the [[Geneva Convention]] prevents her from being officially classified as a [[hospital ship]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/hospital-ships.htm |title=World Wide Hospital Ships |work=Global Security |accessdate=26 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/health/infocentre/journals/ADFHJ_sep00/ADFHealthSep00_1_3_119_123.pdf |title=ADF Health |work=Australian Department of Defence |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114192735/http://www.defence.gov.au/health/infocentre/journals/ADFHJ_sep00/ADFHealthSep00_1_3_119_123.pdf |archivedate=14 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Design and facilities==\nAfter a four-year conversion at [[Harland and Wolff]] in [[Belfast]], the ship entered RFA service in 1988.  Having been initially designed as a [[container ship]], she would have been too unstable when unloaded, making her motion at sea \"very stiff\" which resulted in a very short roll period which is not appropriate for operating helicopters. Therefore, her superstructure is deliberately heavily built (weighing some 800 tons), and she has 1,800 tons of [[concrete]] [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] carried in former hatch covers, which have been inverted to form tray-like structures.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rebuilding the Royal Navy : Warship Design Since 1945 |first1= D.

The ship has a small secondary superstructure approximately two-thirds of the way down the flight deck, containing the ship's exhaust funnel. This is used by small helicopters to simulate landing on the flight deck of a destroyer or frigate.\n\nFor the 1991 [[Gulf War]] ''Argus'' was fitted with a fully functional hospital, which has since been modified and extensively augmented with specialist equipment, providing 70 beds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/our-organisation/the-fighting-arms/royal-fleet-auxiliary/casualty-ship/rfa-argus |title=Casualty Ship (RFA Argus) |work=Royal Navy |accessdate=26 September 2015}}</ref> The ship is equipped with an [[intensive-care unit]], and can provide [[X-ray#Medical uses|medical x-ray]] and [[X-ray computed tomography|CT-scan]] services. Casualties can be quickly transferred from the deck directly into the [[Triage|assessment]] area. In recent years the ship's role as a Primary Casualty Receiving Ship, rather than her aviation training duties, has been considered her primary role.\n\nIn 2007 the ship was refitted with upgraded hospital facilities (replacing the forward aircraft lift with a ramp for emergency exit for hospital trollies and patients as well as two 50-man passenger lifts that lead to a new structure erected on the flight deck), generators and aviation systems (the ship is due to receive an upgrade to its night-vision capabilities enabling the use of [[WAH-64 Apache]] helicopters) to give an operational life until 2020.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/6649989.stm |title=Refit of navy ship RFA Argus ends |work=[[BBC News]] |date=12 May 2007 |publisher= [[British Broadcasting Corporation |BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Service history==\n\n===1990s===\n''Argus'' entered service with the RFA in 1988, replacing {{Ship|RFA|Engadine}} in the aviation training role.

Peoples of the [[Marksville culture]], [[Troyville culture]], [[Coles Creek culture]] and [[Plaquemine culture]] built villages and earthwork [[mound]] complexes throughout the area. Notable examples include the [[Fitzhugh Mounds]] and the [[Raffman Site]].\n\nHistoric tribes which were encountered by European colonists include the [[Taensa]] and [[Natchez people]]s, who both spoke the [[Natchez language]].\n\n===European settlement to present===\n[[Image:James Madison.jpg|left|thumb|125px|[[James Madison]], namesake of Madison Parish, Louisiana]]\nThe parish is named for former [[U.S. President]] [[James Madison]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gannett|first=Henry|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ|year=1905|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ/page/n195 196]|access-date=2016-10-16}}</ref> As was typical of northern areas of Louisiana, and especially along the Mississippi River, it was developed for cotton agriculture on large plantations worked by large gangs of enslaved African Americans.\n\nIn Madison's honor, the parish courthouse is built in the colonial [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]] style of architecture. It is located in the center of the downtown area and faces east. Nearby is the Tallulah City Hall, which faces south.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], Madison Parish, then a rich [[cotton]] area, sent many of its young white men into battle early in the war. Major planters were exempted from service but they often paid for the  equipping of companies. In 1862, the parish government paid a bonus of $80 to anyone joining one of its [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] military companies.<ref>[[John D. Winters]], ''The Civil War in Louisiana'', [[Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1963, {{ISBN|0-8071-0834-0}}, p. 74</ref>\n\nWhen [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Thomas Overton Moore]] realized that [[Capture of New Orleans|New Orleans]] was going to fall to [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces, he issued orders for the destruction of stored cotton in the state to keep it from Federal hands. Otherwise, the Union would sell the cotton, for which there was still high demand, and claim the revenue. The planters and brokers supervised slaves who burned hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cotton in New Orleans and around the state.<ref>Winters, p. 103</ref> Governor Moore asked Brig. Gen. [[R. B. Todd]], who commanded the Eleventh Brigade in northeast Louisiana, to call his own militia into active service, and all men between eighteen and forty who were not subject to [[conscription]]. These men from Madison, Carroll, and [[Tensas Parish, Louisiana|Tensas]] parishes were to cooperate with Confederate authorities to help repel Federal attacks in the area.<ref>Winters, p. 165</ref>\n\nToward the end of the war, Madison Parish faced problems with [[jayhawker]]s, men sympathetic to the Union. According to historian Winters, they \"were holed up in the impenetrable cane and cypress swamps in the area. This band, made up of draft dodgers, deserters, and runaway [[Negro]]es, often left the swamps to rob, kill, or capture anyone who passed by on the road.\"<ref name=\"Winters, p. 394\">Winters, p. 394</ref> The Confederates dressed in Federal uniforms to trick the jayhawkers. Winters continues: \"The leader of the desperadoes, a huge black, welcomed the supposed Federal troops. Suddenly the [Confederate] disguised men fell upon the surprised gang and began to slaughter them. [In] a quick but bloody struggle [the Confederates] killed 130 of the group. The few who escaped never again returned to ravage the area.\"<ref name=\"Winters, p. 394\"/>\n\nFollowing the Reconstruction era and during the [[Jim Crow]] era, white Democrats across the state violently suppressed black voting, which was for Republican candidates, and civil rights. Twelve blacks were [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] in Madison Parish from 1877 to 1950, most near the turn of the 20th century when social and economic tensions were the highest.<ref>[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf ''Lynching in America, Third Edition: Supplement by County''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023063004/https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf |date=2017-10-23 }}, p. 6, Equal Justice Initiative, Mobile, AL, 2017</ref> In addition, in July 1899 five immigrant Sicilian grocers were lynched by whites in Tallulah, the parish seat, for failing to observe [[Jim Crow]] customs of serving whites before blacks and because they were competing with locals with their stores.<ref name=\"scambray\">[http://www.italoamericano.org/story/2012-12-13/corda-sapone Ken Scambray, \" 'Corda e Sapone' (Rope and Soap): how the Italians were lynched in the USA\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515183837/http://www.italoamericano.org/story/2012-12-13/corda-sapone |date=2018-05-15 }}, ''L'Italo-Americano'', 13 December 2012; accessed 14 May 2018</ref>\n\nThe Sevier family, members of the Democratic Party, dominated Madison Parish politics for more than a century, during a period when most blacks (who were voting Republican) were disenfranchised after passage of the 1898 constitution. It raised barriers to voter registration. These planters claimed descent from [[John Sevier]], a fighter in the [[American Revolution]], [[governor of Tennessee]], and namesake of [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]] and [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]] in eastern [[Tennessee]]. Among the political Seviers were Andrew Jackson Sevier, Jr., who served as [[sheriff]] of Madison Parish from 1904 until his death in 1941. He was briefly succeeded by his wife, Mary Louise Day Sevier. [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisiana State Senator]] [[Andrew L. Sevier]] served from 1932 until his death in 1962.

Since the civil rights era, most African Americans in the South have supported Democratic candidates, as the national party supported their drive to exercise constitutional rights as citizens, even though most Southern Democrats remained vehemently opposed to civil rights.

It has a majority African-American population. For years a ferry connected [[Delta, Louisiana]] (and traffic from the parish) to [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. A bridge now carries highway US 80 across the river.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory===\n{{Main|History of Louisiana#Prehistory}}\nMadison Parish was the home to many succeeding [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] groups in the thousands of years before European settlement. Peoples of the [[Marksville culture]], [[Troyville culture]], [[Coles Creek culture]] and [[Plaquemine culture]] built villages and earthwork [[mound]] complexes throughout the area. Notable examples include the [[Fitzhugh Mounds]] and the [[Raffman Site]].\n\nHistoric tribes which were encountered by European colonists include the [[Taensa]] and [[Natchez people]]s, who both spoke the [[Natchez language]].\n\n===European settlement to present===\n[[Image:James Madison.jpg|left|thumb|125px|[[James Madison]], namesake of Madison Parish, Louisiana]]\nThe parish is named for former [[U.S. President]] [[James Madison]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gannett|first=Henry|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ|year=1905|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ/page/n195 196]|access-date=2016-10-16}}</ref> As was typical of northern areas of Louisiana, and especially along the Mississippi River, it was developed for cotton agriculture on large plantations worked by large gangs of enslaved African Americans.\n\nIn Madison's honor, the parish courthouse is built in the colonial [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]] style of architecture. It is located in the center of the downtown area and faces east. Nearby is the Tallulah City Hall, which faces south.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], Madison Parish, then a rich [[cotton]] area, sent many of its young white men into battle early in the war. Major planters were exempted from service but they often paid for the  equipping of companies. In 1862, the parish government paid a bonus of $80 to anyone joining one of its [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] military companies.<ref>[[John D. Winters]], ''The Civil War in Louisiana'', [[Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1963, {{ISBN|0-8071-0834-0}}, p. 74</ref>\n\nWhen [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Thomas Overton Moore]] realized that [[Capture of New Orleans|New Orleans]] was going to fall to [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces, he issued orders for the destruction of stored cotton in the state to keep it from Federal hands. Otherwise, the Union would sell the cotton, for which there was still high demand, and claim the revenue. The planters and brokers supervised slaves who burned hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cotton in New Orleans and around the state.<ref>Winters, p. 103</ref> Governor Moore asked Brig. Gen. [[R. B. Todd]], who commanded the Eleventh Brigade in northeast Louisiana, to call his own militia into active service, and all men between eighteen and forty who were not subject to [[conscription]]. These men from Madison, Carroll, and [[Tensas Parish, Louisiana|Tensas]] parishes were to cooperate with Confederate authorities to help repel Federal attacks in the area.<ref>Winters, p. 165</ref>\n\nToward the end of the war, Madison Parish faced problems with [[jayhawker]]s, men sympathetic to the Union. According to historian Winters, they \"were holed up in the impenetrable cane and cypress swamps in the area. This band, made up of draft dodgers, deserters, and runaway [[Negro]]es, often left the swamps to rob, kill, or capture anyone who passed by on the road.\"<ref name=\"Winters, p. 394\">Winters, p. 394</ref> The Confederates dressed in Federal uniforms to trick the jayhawkers. Winters continues: \"The leader of the desperadoes, a huge black, welcomed the supposed Federal troops. Suddenly the [Confederate] disguised men fell upon the surprised gang and began to slaughter them. [In] a quick but bloody struggle [the Confederates] killed 130 of the group. The few who escaped never again returned to ravage the area.\"<ref name=\"Winters, p. 394\"/>\n\nFollowing the Reconstruction era and during the [[Jim Crow]] era, white Democrats across the state violently suppressed black voting, which was for Republican candidates, and civil rights. Twelve blacks were [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] in Madison Parish from 1877 to 1950, most near the turn of the 20th century when social and economic tensions were the highest.<ref>[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf ''Lynching in America, Third Edition: Supplement by County''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023063004/https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf |date=2017-10-23 }}, p. 6, Equal Justice Initiative, Mobile, AL, 2017</ref> In addition, in July 1899 five immigrant Sicilian grocers were lynched by whites in Tallulah, the parish seat, for failing to observe [[Jim Crow]] customs of serving whites before blacks and because they were competing with locals with their stores.<ref name=\"scambray\">[http://www.italoamericano.org/story/2012-12-13/corda-sapone Ken Scambray, \" 'Corda e Sapone' (Rope and Soap): how the Italians were lynched in the USA\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515183837/http://www.italoamericano.org/story/2012-12-13/corda-sapone |date=2018-05-15 }}, ''L'Italo-Americano'', 13 December 2012; accessed 14 May 2018</ref>\n\nThe Sevier family, members of the Democratic Party, dominated Madison Parish politics for more than a century, during a period when most blacks (who were voting Republican) were disenfranchised after passage of the 1898 constitution. It raised barriers to voter registration. These planters claimed descent from [[John Sevier]], a fighter in the [[American Revolution]], [[governor of Tennessee]], and namesake of [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]] and [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]] in eastern [[Tennessee]]. Among the political Seviers were Andrew Jackson Sevier, Jr., who served as [[sheriff]] of Madison Parish from 1904 until his death in 1941. He was briefly succeeded by his wife, Mary Louise Day Sevier. [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisiana State Senator]] [[Andrew L. Sevier]] served from 1932 until his death in 1962. [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Representative]] [[Henry Clay Sevier|Henry Clay \"Happy\" Sevier, Sr.]] served from 1936 to 1952. William Putnam \"Buck\" Sevier, Jr., was a banker and town alderman.

In 1969 [[Zelma Wyche]] was elected as Police Chief of Tallulah. In 1974 Adell Williams was elected as mayor, the first woman and first African American to fill this position.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the parish has a total area of {{convert|651|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|624|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|26|sqmi}} (4.1%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 1, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928155956/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|archivedate=September 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Major highways===\n*[[Image:I-20.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 20]]\n*[[Image:US 65.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 65]]\n*[[Image:US 80.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 80]]\n\n===Adjacent counties and parishes===\n*[[East Carroll Parish, Louisiana|East Carroll Parish]]  (north)\n*[[Warren County, Mississippi|Warren County]], [[Mississippi]]  (east)\n*[[Tensas Parish, Louisiana|Tensas Parish]]  (south)\n*[[Franklin Parish, Louisiana|Franklin Parish]]  (southwest)\n*[[Richland Parish, Louisiana|Richland Parish]]  (northwest)\n\n===National protected areas===\n* [[Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge]] (part)\n* [[Vicksburg National Military Park]] (part)\n\n==Demographics==\nBecause of limited job opportunities as agriculture has mechanized and the Chicago Lumber Mill closed, the parish population has declined overall by about one-third since its peak in 1980.

Since the civil rights era, most African Americans in the South have supported Democratic candidates, as the national party supported their drive to exercise constitutional rights as citizens, even though most Southern Democrats remained vehemently opposed to civil rights.
