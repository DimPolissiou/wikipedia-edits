He is most famous for several marine voyages of increasing difficulty.\n\n== Personal life ==\nDoncho Papazov was born in Sofia on February 21, 1939. He is a record-holding diver and has participated in numerous archeological dives. He was married to Olga Herdova, fom Czech Republic and has one son Alexandr Herda (*1969), later he was married to Julia Gurkovska and has a daughter, Yana. Doncho Papazov is the author of four books and many documentaries about his voyages. He spent over 20 years working as a journalist for the [[Bulgarian National Television]]. He was also a member of the Coordinating Council of the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]],<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/UDF_Coordinating_Council_1990 Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces.] ''Demokratsiya Newspaper'', 27 April 1990.</ref> a member of the 36th [[National Assembly of Bulgaria|Ordinary National Assembly]], and deputy chairman of the Union of Bulgarian Journalists (1993\u20131995).

On board Dju II (a conventional dinghy), he spent 15 days alone off the coast of [[Sozopol]] in the [[Bay of Burgas]] in the [[Black Sea]], eating nothing but plankton. Despite some weight loss, it was determined that plankton can potentially sustain humans in distress.\n\n==The Plankton II Expedition - Across the Black Sea==\n26 days: May 25 - June 6, 1972.\n\nPapazov undertook this expedition along with his wife, Julia Gurkovska (nicknamed Dju, giving her name to all the boats in the Dju series). In 26 days, they crossed the [[Black Sea]] from [[Varna]] to [[Sochi]], aboard a standard keel-less lifeboat, Dju III. This was a continuation of the first plankton experiment, with their on-board diet supplying only 50% of required daily nutrition. Relying on zoo-plankton for the rest was shown to significantly reduce the expected exhaustion in their organisms.

He is most famous for several marine voyages of increasing difficulty.\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nDoncho Papazov was born in Sofia on February 21, 1939. He is a record-holding diver and has participated in numerous archeological dives. He was married to Olga Herdova, fom Czech Republic and has one son Alexandr Herda (*1969), later he was married to Julia Gurkovska and has a daughter, Yana. Doncho Papazov is the author of four books and many documentaries about his voyages. He spent over 20 years working as a journalist for the [[Bulgarian National Television]]. He was also a member of the Coordinating Council of the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]],<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/UDF_Coordinating_Council_1990 Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces.] ''Demokratsiya Newspaper'', 27 April 1990.</ref> a member of the 36th [[National Assembly of Bulgaria|Ordinary National Assembly]], and deputy chairman of the Union of Bulgarian Journalists (1993\u20131995). He currently resides in Sofia.\n\n\n==The Plankton I Expedition - Sozopol==\n15 days: July 20 - August 3, 1970.\n\nIn this first expedition of the Plankton program,<ref>[http://www.geology.bas.bg/plancton/planct1_en.html Plankton I, Boat Dju II]</ref> Papazov set out to determine whether zoo-plankton can provide sufficient nutrition to survive on in extreme conditions. On board Dju II (a conventional dinghy), he spent 15 days alone off the coast of [[Sozopol]] in the [[Bay of Burgas]] in the [[Black Sea]], eating nothing but plankton. Despite some weight loss, it was determined that plankton can potentially sustain humans in distress.\n\n==The Plankton II Expedition - Across the Black Sea==\n26 days: May 25 - June 6, 1972.\n\nPapazov undertook this expedition along with his wife, Julia Gurkovska (nicknamed Dju, giving her name to all the boats in the Dju series). In 26 days, they crossed the [[Black Sea]] from [[Varna]] to [[Sochi]], aboard a standard keel-less lifeboat, Dju III. This was a continuation of the first plankton experiment, with their on-board diet supplying only 50% of required daily nutrition. Relying on zoo-plankton for the rest was shown to significantly reduce the expected exhaustion in their organisms. This was the first crossing of the Black Sea with a vessel of this caliber.<ref>[http://www.geology.bas.bg/plancton/planct2_en.html Plankton II, Boat Dju III]</ref>\n\n==The Plankton III Expedition - Across the Atlantic==\n63 days: May 8 - July 16, 1974.\n\nThis was the first truly daring expedition that Papazov and his wife undertook.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/csmonitor_historic/access/263539362.html?dids=263539362:263539362&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&date=Mar+21%2C+1974&author=&pub=Christian+Science+Monitor&desc=Researchers+to+sail+Atlantic+using+plankton+for+food&pqatl=google Researchers to sail Atlantic using plankton for food]</ref> On an 8-metre keel-less lifeboat (dubbed Dju IV), they set out to cross the Atlantic from [[Gibraltar]] to [[Cuba]].

At the height of its territorial jurisdiction, it covered large parts of what is now [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Bengal proper covered the ethno-linguistic region of [[Bengal]] (present-day [[Bangladesh]] and the [[West Bengal|Indian state of West Bengal]]). [[Calcutta]], the city which grew around Fort William, was the capital of the Bengal Presidency. For many years, the [[Governor of Bengal]] was concurrently the [[Viceroy of India]] and Calcutta was the de facto [[capital of India]] until the early 20th-century. \n\nThe Bengal Presidency emerged from trading posts established in [[Mughal Bengal]] during the reign of Emperor Jahangir in 1612. The Honourable East India Company (HEIC), a British monopoly with a Royal Charter, competed with other European companies to gain influence in Bengal. After the decisive overthrow of the Nawab of Bengal in 1757 and the [[Battle of Buxar]] in 1765, the HEIC expanded its control over much of the Indian subcontinent. This marked the beginning of [[Company rule in India]], when the HEIC emerged as the most powerful military force in the subcontinent. The British Parliament gradually withdrew the monopoly of the HEIC. By the 1850s, the HEIC struggled with finances.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">William Dalrymple (10 September 2019).

In the early 20th-century, Bengal emerged as a hotbed of the [[Indian independence movement]], as well as the epicenter of the [[Bengali Renaissance]].     \n\nBengal was the economic, cultural and educational hub of the [[British Raj]]. During the period of [[proto-industrialization]], Bengal significantly contributed directly to the [[Industrial revolution]] in Britain, although it was soon overtaken by the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] ruled by [[Tipu Sultan]] as [[South Asia]]'s dominant economic power.<ref name=\"Parthasarathi\">{{Citation |title=Why Europe Grew Rich and Asia Did Not: Global Economic Divergence, 1600\u20131850 |given=Prasannan |surname=Parthasarathi |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-139-49889-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_YEcvo-jqcC}}</ref> When Bengal was reorganized, [[Penang]], [[Singapore]] and [[Malacca]] were separated into the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1867.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/bd541c73-58ef-4bb1-9de7-173f00913286 |title=The Straits Settlements becomes a residency - Singapore History |publisher=Eresources.nlb.gov.sg |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> [[British Burma]] became a province of India and a later a [[Crown Colony]] in itself.

The governance of the company was placed in the hands of a governor and a 24-member Court of Directors. The corporation became known as the Honourable East India Company (HEIC). It rose to account for half of the world's trade. The company was given a monopoly for British trade in the Indian ocean.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>  \n \nIn 1608, [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Jahangir]] allowed the English East India Company to establish a small trading post on the west coast of India. It was followed in 1611 by a [[factory (trading post)|factory]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]] in South India, and in 1612 the company joined other already established European trading companies to trade in the wealthy [[Bengal Subah]] in the east.<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. II|1908|pp=452\u2013472}}</ref> However, the power of the Mughal Empire declined from 1707, as the Nawab of Bengal in [[Murshidabad]] became financially independent with the help of bankers such as the [[Jagat Seth]]. The Nawabs began entering into treaties with numerous European companies, including the [[French East India Company]], the [[Dutch East India Company]], and the [[Danish East India Company]]. The Mughal court in [[Delhi]] was weakened by [[Nader Shah]]'s invasion from Persia (1739) and [[Ahmed Shah Durrani]]'s invasion from Afghanistan (1761). The East India Company's victories at the [[Battle of Plassey]] (against the last independent Nawab of Bengal in 1757) and the [[Battle of Buxar]] (against the Nawabs of Bengal and [[Nawab of Oudh|Oudh]] in 1764) led to the abolition of local rule (Nizamat) in Bengal in 1793. The Company gradually began to formally expand its territories across India and [[Southeast Asia]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol.

Acting through [[Lord Cornwallis]], then Governor-General, he ascertained and defined the rights of the landholders over the soil. These landholders under the previous system had started, for the most part, as collectors of the revenues, and gradually acquired certain prescriptive rights as quasi-proprietors of the estates entrusted to them by the government. In 1793 Lord Cornwallis declared their rights perpetual, and gave over the land of Bengal to the previous quasi-proprietors or ''zamindars'', on condition of the payment of a fixed land tax. This piece of legislation is known as the [[Permanent Settlement]] of the Land Revenue. It was designed to \"introduce\" ideas of property rights to India, and stimulate a market in land. The former aim misunderstood the nature of landholding in India, and the latter was an abject failure.\n\nThe ''Cornwallis Code'', while defining the rights of the proprietors, failed to give adequate recognition to the rights of the under-tenants and the cultivators. This remained a serious problem for the duration of British Rule, as throughout the Bengal Presidency ''ryots'' (peasants) found themselves oppressed by rack-renting landlords, who knew that every rupee they could squeeze from their tenants over and above the fixed revenue demanded from the Government represented pure profit. Furthermore, the Permanent Settlement took no account of inflation, meaning that the value of the revenue to Government declined year by year, whilst the heavy burden on the peasantry grew no less. This was compounded in the early 19th century by compulsory schemes for the cultivation of [[opium]] and [[indigo]], the former by the state, and the latter by British planters. Peasants were forced to grow a certain area of these crops, which were then purchased at below market rates for export. This added greatly to rural poverty.\n\nSo unsuccessful was the Permanent Settlement that it was not introduced in the North-Western Provinces (taken from the Marathas during the campaigns of [[Lord Lake]] and [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]]) after 1831, in Punjab after its conquest in 1849, or in [[Oudh]] which was annexed in 1856. These regions were nominally part of the Bengal Presidency, but remained administratively distinct. The area of the Presidency under direct administration was sometimes referred to as Lower Bengal to distinguish it from the Presidency as a whole. Officially Punjab, Agra and Allahabad had Lieutenant-Governors subject to the authority of the Governor of Bengal in Calcutta, but in practice they were more or less independent. The only all-Presidency institutions which remained were the Bengal Army and the Civil Service. The Bengal Army was finally amalgamated into the new [[British-Indian Army]] in 1904\u20135, after a lengthy struggle over its reform between [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], the Commander-in-Chief, and [[Lord Curzon]], the Viceroy.\n\n===Straits Settlements===\nIn 1830, the British Straits Settlements on the coast of the [[Malacca Straits]] was made a residency of the Presidency of Bengal in Calcutta. The area included the erstwhile [[Prince of Wales Island (Malaysia)|Prince of Wales Island]] and [[Province Wellesley]], as well as the ports of [[Malacca]] and [[Singapore]]. Previously, the Straits Settlements (formed by the HEIC in 1826) was administered as a separate presidency with [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] as the capital. However, the presidency was found to be too costly to administer. Hence, the HEIC decided to reduce the status of the Straits Settlements from a presidency to a residency of the Presidency of Bengal, which was under the governor-general of India based in Calcutta.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> As a residency, all administrative decisions and legislations concerning the Straits Settlements were made in Calcutta, and the governor of the Straits Settlements became a mere resident without executive and legislative powers. Overall, this arrangement proved to be ineffective. Without proper representation in Calcutta and due to the distance between the Straits Settlements and Calcutta, the Indian government found it difficult to advance their interests in the Straits such as by cultivating better ties with the Malay states.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nNonetheless, the Straits Settlements remained in the Presidency of Bengal for more than three decades. During this period, the Straits Settlements underwent a number of administrative changes. In 1832, Singapore replaced George Town as the capital of the Straits Settlements. In 1851, direct control over the Straits Settlements was transferred to the Governor-General of India in Calcutta. Under the administration of the East India Company, the Settlements were used as [[penal settlements]] for Indian civilian and military prisoners,<ref>Anderson, C (2007) ''The Indian Uprising of 1857\u20138: prisons, prisoners, and rebellion'', Anthem Press.

The [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong]], [[Dhaka Division|Dhaka]] and [[Rajshahi Division|Rajshahi]] divisions, the [[Malda District]] and the States of [[Tripura (princely state)|Hill Tripura]], [[Sylhet]] and [[Comilla]] were transferred from Bengal to a new province, [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]]; the five Hindi-speaking states of [[Chota Nagpur States|Chota Nagpur]], namely [[Changbhakar State|Changbhakar]], [[Koriya State|Korea]], [[Surguja State|Surguja]], [[Udaipur State, Chhattisgarh|Udaipur]] and [[Jashpur State]], were transferred from Bengal to the Central Provinces; and [[Sambalpur State]] and the five Oriya states of [[Bamra State|Bamra]], [[Rairakhol State|Rairakhol]], [[Sonepur State|Sonepur]], [[Patna State|Patna]] and [[Kalahandi State|Kalahandi]] were transferred from the [[Central Provinces]] to Bengal.\n\nThe province of West Bengal then consisted of the thirty-three districts of [[Burdwan District|Burdwan]], [[Birbhum District|Birbhum]], [[Bankura]], [[Midnapur]], [[Hooghly District|Hughli]], [[Howrah]], [[Twenty-four Parganas]], [[Calcutta]], [[Nadia District|Nadia]], [[Murshidabad]], [[Jessore]], [[Khulna]], [[Patna]], [[Gaya, India|Gaya]], [[Shahabad District|Shahabad]], [[Saran district|Saran]], [[Champaran District|Champaran]], [[Muzaffarpur District|Muzaffarpur]], [[Darbhanga]], [[Monghyr]], [[Bhagalpur]], [[Purnea]], [[Santhal Parganas]], [[Cuttack]], [[Balasore]], [[Angul]] and [[Kandhmal]], [[Puri]], [[Sambalpur]], [[Singhbhum]], [[Hazaribagh]], [[Ranchi]], [[Palamau]], and [[Manbhum]]. The [[princely states]] of [[Sikkim]] and the [[tributary state]]s of [[Odisha]] and [[Chhota Nagpur States|Chhota Nagpur]] were not part of Bengal, but British relations with them were managed by its government.\n\nThe [[Indian Councils Act 1909]] expanded the legislative councils of Bengal and Eastern Bengal and Assam provinces to include up to 50 nominated and elected members, in addition to three ''ex officio'' members from the executive council.<ref>Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine (1907). \"Appendix II: Constitution of the Legislative Councils under the Regulations of November 1909\", in ''The Government of India''. Clarendon Press. pp. 431.</ref>\n\nBengal's legislative council included 22 nominated members, of which not more than 17 could be officials, and two nominated experts. Of the 26 elected members, one was elected by the [[Corporation of Calcutta]], six by municipalities, six by district boards, one by the [[University of Calcutta]], five by landholders, four by Muslims, two by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce, and one by the Calcutta Trades Association. Eastern Bengal and Assam's legislative council included 22 nominated members, of which not more than 17 be officials and one representing Indian commerce, and two nominated experts. Of the 18 elected members, three were elected by municipalities, five by district and local boards, two by landowners, four by Muslims, two by the tea interest, one by the jute interest, and one by the Commissioners of the [[Port of Chittagong]].<ref>Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine (1907). \"Appendix II: Constitution of the Legislative Councils under the Regulations of November 1909\", in ''The Government of India''. Clarendon Press. pp. 432\u20135.</ref>\n\nThe partition of Bengal proved highly controversial, as it resulted in a largely Hindu West Bengal and a largely Muslim East. Serious popular agitation followed the step, partly on the grounds that this was part of a cynical policy of divide and rule, and partly that the Bengali population, the centre of whose interests and prosperity was Calcutta, would now be divided under two governments, instead of being concentrated and numerically dominant under the one, while the bulk would be in the new division. In 1906\u20131909 the unrest developed to a considerable extent, requiring special attention from the Indian and Home governments, and this led to the decision being reversed in 1911.\n\n===Reorganisation of Bengal, 1912===\nAt the [[Delhi Durbar]] on 12 December 1911, King George V announced the transfer of the seat of the Government of India from Calcutta to Delhi, the reunification of the five predominantly Bengali-speaking divisions into a Presidency (or province) of Bengal under a Governor, the creation of a new province of [[Bihar and Orissa Province|Bihar and Orissa]] under a lieutenant-governor, and that [[Assam Province]] would be reconstituted under a chief commissioner. On 21 March 1912 [[Thomas Gibson-Carmichael, 1st Baron Carmichael|Thomas Gibson-Carmichael]] was appointed Governor of Bengal; prior to that date the Governor-General of India had also served as the governor of Bengal Presidency. On 22 March the provinces of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa and Assam were constituted.<ref>Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine (1922). ''The Government of India'', Third Edition, revised and updated.

It was the only province that would be allowed to remain independent should it  choose to do so. On May 23, the British Cabinet meeting also hoped that Bengal would remain united. British Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] informed the [[US Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] on 2 June 1947 that there was a\"distinct possibility Bengal might decide against partition and against joining either Hindustan or Pakistan\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Shoaib Daniyal |url=https://scroll.in/article/907754/why-did-british-prime-minister-attlee-think-bengal-was-going-to-be-an-independent-country-in-1947 |title=Why did British prime minister Attlee think Bengal was going to be an independent country in 1947? |publisher=Scroll.in |date=2019-01-06 |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> On 6 June 1947, the [[Sylhet referendum]] gave a mandate for [[Sylhet Division]] to be re-united into Bengal. However, Hindu nationalist leaders in West Bengal and conservative East Bengali Muslim leaders were against the prospect. \n\nOn 20 June 1947, the Bengal Legislative Assembly met to vote on partition plans. At the preliminary joint session, the assembly decided by 120 votes to 90 that it should remain united if it joined the new Constituent Assembly of Pakistan. Later, a separate meeting of legislators from West Bengal decided by 58 votes to 21 that the province should be partitioned and that West Bengal should join the existing Constituent Assembly of India. In another separate meeting of legislators from East Bengal, it was decided by 106 votes to 35 that the province should not be partitioned and 107 votes to 34 that East Bengal should join Pakistan in the event of partition.<ref>Mukherjee, Soumyendra Nath (1987).

The governor of Bengal was concurrently the governor-general of India for many years. The East India Company maintained control with its private armies and administrative machinery. Nevertheless, the East India Company was a quasi-official entity, having received a [[Royal Charter]] from [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in 1600. The [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] caused the British government to assume direct control of India's administration under the [[Government of India Act, 1858]]. The head of state became the [[British monarch]], who was also given the title of [[Emperor of India]]/[[Empress of India]]. The monarch was represented through a viceroy. The [[Viceroy of India]] was based in the Bengal Presidency until 1911. The [[Secretary of State for India]] was also an important official. The Bengal Civil Service managed the provincial government.

The Governor-General in Council in Fort William enacted legislation, such as the prohibition of Persian as an official language under Act no. XXIX of 1837 passed by the President of the Council of India in Council on 20 November 1837.\n\n===Judiciary===\n[[File:Calcutta High Court 1860.jpg|thumb|Calcutta High Court, 1860s]]\nThe [[Calcutta High Court]] was set up in 1862. The building was designed on the model of [[Ypres Cloth Hall]] in Belgium. The [[Dhaka High Court|Dacca High Court]] building was built during the early 20th century, with elements of a Roman [[pantheon]]. District courts were established in all district headquarters of the Bengal Presidency. At the district level, tax collectors and revenue officers acted with the power of [[magistrates]]. In 1814, the East India Company pressed the Bengal Government to consider the [[Madras Presidency]]'s model of uniting of judicial and executive powers at the district level. Ultimately Lord Hastings government empowered the Governor General-in-Council by Regulation IV of 1821 to authorize the Collectors and Revenue Officers to exercise powers of magistrates. In 1829, magisterial power was given to all Collectors and Revenue Officers. The controversy regarding the lack of [[separation of powers]] continued until 1921. During the period from 1853 to 1921, as many as four reports were prepared on the issue of separation of the judiciary from the executive. The first was in 1893, the second in 1900, the third in 1908 and the fourth in 1913. The Islington Commission was formed by the Secretary of State for India in 1912 to enquire into the problems of judicial administration in India. In its report submitted on August 14, 1915; the Commission opined that legislation would be necessary to effect separation of executive and judicial functions of the officers. Despite these reports, the structure as laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure continued until 1921. On April 5, 1921 the Bengal Legislative Council adopted the following resolution: \"This Council recommends to the Government that early steps be taken for the separation of the judiciary from the executive functions in the administration of this Presidency.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Separation_of_the_Judiciary |title=Separation of the Judiciary - Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n \n===Bengal Legislative Council (1862-1947)===\n{{Main article|Bengal Legislative Council}}\n{{See also|Legislative Council of Eastern Bengal and Assam}}\n[[File:The Town Hall, Calcutta in the 1860s.jpg|thumb|The Legislative Council met in Calcutta Town Hall]]\nThe British government began to appoint legislative councils under the [[Indian Councils Act 1861]]. The Bengal Legislative Council was established in 1862. It was one of the largest and most important legislative councils in British India. Over the years, the council's powers were gradually expanded from an advisory role to debating government policies and enacting legislation. Under the [[Government of India Act, 1935]], the council became the [[upper chamber]] of the Bengali legislature. \n\n===Dyarchy (1920\u201337)===\nBritish India's [[Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms]] of 1919, enacted in 1921, expanded the Bengal Legislative Council to 140 members to include more elected Indian members. The reforms also introduced the principle of [[dyarchy]], whereby certain responsibilities such as agriculture, health, education, and local government, were transferred to elected ministers. However, the important portfolios like finance, police and irrigation were reserved with members of the Governor's Executive Council. Some of the prominent ministers were [[Surendranath Banerjee]] (Local Self-government and Public Health 1921-1923), Sir Provash Chunder Mitter (Education 1921\u20131924, Local Self-government, Public Health, Agriculture and Public Works 1927\u20131928), Nawab Saiyid Nawab Ali Chaudhuri (Agriculture and Public Works) and [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]] (Education 1924). [[Bhupendra Nath Bose]] and [[Abdur Rahim (judge)|Sir Abdur Rahim]] were Executive Members in the Governor's Council.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Working Of Dyarchy In India 1919 1928|publisher=D.B.Taraporevala Sons And Company.|url=https://archive.org/details/workingofdyarchy029425mbp}}</ref>\n\n===Bengal Legislative Assembly (1935-1947)===      \n{{Main article|Bengal Legislative Assembly}}\n[[File:Bengal PMs.png|thumb|Statesmen who served as the [[Prime Minister of Bengal]]]]\nThe Government of India Act, 1935 established the Bengal Legislative Assembly as the lower chamber of the Bengali legislature. It was a 250-seat assembly where most members were elected by either the General Electorate or the Muslim Electorate (under the [[Communal Award]]). Other members were nominated. The separate electorate dividing Muslims from the general electorate was deeply controversial. The [[Prime Minister of Bengal]] was a member of the assembly.   \n\nIn the [[1937 Indian provincial elections|elections held in 1937]], the [[Indian National Congress]] won a maximum of 54 seats but declined to form the government. The [[Krishak Praja Party]] of [[A. K.

Local legislation was enacted by the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly. [[Case law]] was also an important source of law. Many laws enacted in British Bengal are still in use today, including the [[Indian Penal Code]]. In 1919, the [[Rowlatt Act]] gave extensive powers to the British government and police, and allowed indefinite arrest and detention of individuals, warrant-less searches and seizures, restrictions on public gatherings, and intensive censorship of media and publications. The public opposition to this act eventually led to mass campaigns of non-violent civil disobedience throughout the country demanding guaranteed civil freedoms, and limitations on government power.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Despite being a common law jurisdiction, British India did not enjoy the same level of protection for civil liberties as in the United Kingdom. It was only after independence in 1947 and the adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948, that human rights were clearly enshrined in law.     \n\n==Education==\n[[File:A statue at victoria memorial. kolkata.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of [[Lord William Bentinck]] in Calcutta Victoria Memorial.

There were only two full-fledged universities in Bengal during British rule, including the University of Calcutta and the University of Dacca. Both universities were represented in the Bengal Legislative Assembly under the Government of India Act, 1935. \n\nPrimary education was mandatory under the Compulsory Education Acts.<ref name=\"banglapedia1\">{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Education |title=Education - Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> Despite significant advances and the emergence of a large educated middle class, most of the population did not have access to a proper education. During 1946-47, there were 5,298 high schools with an enrolment of 21,99,000 pupils whereas the corresponding figures for 1916-17 were 1,507 and 57,200. The demand for secondary education increased with the growth of political consciousness amongst the masses. The result was the establishment of schools in villages and towns where backward communities could enroll. Female education too received a good deal of attention during the period. Consequently, between 1921-22 and 1946-47, the number of educational institutions for girls nearly doubled.<ref name=\"banglapedia1\"/> Some of the leading schools included the [[Oriental Seminary]] in Calcutta, the [[St. Gregory's High School]] in Dacca, the [[Rajshahi Collegiate School]] in Rajshahi and the [[Chittagong Collegiate School]] in Chittagong. European missionaries, Hindu philanthropists and Muslim aristocrats were influential promoters of education. Ethnic minorities maintained their own institutions, such as the Armenian [[Pogose School]]. \n\nEach district of Bengal had a [[List of Zilla Schools of Bangladesh|district school]], which were the leading secondary institutions. Due to Calcutta being the colonial capital, the city had a large concentration of educational institutions. It was followed by Dacca, which served as a provincial capital between 1905 and 1912. Libraries were established in each district of Bengal by the colonial government and the [[Zamindar]]s. In 1854, four major public libraries were opened, including the Bogra Woodburn Library, the Rangpur Public Library, the Jessore Institute Public Library and the Barisal Public Library. [[Northbrook Hall]] was established in 1882 in honor of Governor-General [[Lord Northbrook]]. Other libraries built include the Victoria Public Library, Natore (1901), the Sirajganj Public Library (1882), the [[Rajshahi Public Library]] (1884), the Comilla Birchandra Library (1885), the Shah Makhdum Institute Public Library, Rajshahi (1891), the Noakhali Town Hall Public Library (1896), the Prize Memorial Library, Sylhet (1897), the Chittagong Municipality Public Library (1904) and the Varendra Research Library (1910).

There was a growing cultural awakening in [[Bengali Muslim]] society, including the emergence of [[Mir Mosharraf Hossain]] as the first Muslim novelist of Bengal; [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] as a celebrated poet who merged Bengali and Hindustani influences; [[Begum Rokeya]] and [[Nawab Faizunnesa]] as feminist educators; [[Kaykobad]] as an epic poet; and members of the [[Freedom of Intellect Movement]]. \n\nBengal played a major role in the [[Indian independence movement]] and the [[Pakistan movement]]. The earliest organized anti-colonial groups appeared in Bengal. The region produced many of the subcontinent's political leaders during the early 20th century. Political parties and rebel groups were formed across the region. \n\n===Architecture===\nCivic architecture began following European styles after the advent of the East India Company's authority. The [[Indo-Saracenic]] style, merging [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Indo-Islamic architecture|Indo-Islamic]] architecture, was started by British architects in the late 19th-century. While cities such as Calcutta and Dacca featured more civic architecture, [[country houses]] were built in many towns and villages across Bengal. [[Art deco]] influences began in the 1930s. Wealthy Bengali families (especially [[zamindar]] estates) employed European firms to design houses and palaces. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Architecture in British Bengal\" style=\"font-size:88%; line-height:130%; border-bottom:1px #aaa solid;\" heights=\"180\">\nThe Hooghly Bridge (BOND 0034).jpeg|[[Howrah Bridge]] in 1945\nVictoria Memorial, Calcutta - LIFE.jpg|[[Victoria Memorial, Kolkata]]\nWriters Building.jpg|[[Writer's Building]]\nRuplal House old.jpg|[[Ruplal House]]\nCompleted Bridge.

Historians have argued that the British used a policy of [[divide and rule]] among Hindus and Muslims. This meant favoring Hindus over Muslims and vice versa in certain sectors. For example, after the [[Permanent Settlement]], Hindu merchants such as the [[Tagore family]] were awarded large land grants that previously belonged to the Mughal aristocracy. In Calcutta, where Hindus formed a majority, wealthy Muslims were often given favors over Hindus. One aspect that benefitted the Hindu community was increased literacy rates. Many Muslims, however, remained alienated from English education after the abolition of Persian. Bengali society continued to experience religious nationalism which led to the partition of Bengal in 1947.\n\nBritish Bengali cities included a cosmopolitan population, including Armenians and Jews. [[Anglo-Indians]] formed a prominent part of the urban population.

At the height of its territorial jurisdiction, it covered large parts of what is now [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Bengal proper covered the ethno-linguistic region of [[Bengal]] (present-day [[Bangladesh]] and the [[West Bengal|Indian state of West Bengal]]). [[Calcutta]], the city which grew around Fort William, was the capital of the Bengal Presidency. For many years, the [[Governor of Bengal]] was concurrently the [[Viceroy of India]] and Calcutta was the de facto [[capital of India]] until the early 20th-century. \n\nThe Bengal Presidency emerged from trading posts established in [[Mughal Bengal]] during the reign of Emperor Jahangir in 1612. The Honourable East India Company (HEIC), a British monopoly with a Royal Charter, competed with other European companies to gain influence in Bengal. After the decisive overthrow of the Nawab of Bengal in 1757 and the [[Battle of Buxar]] in 1765, the HEIC expanded its control over much of the Indian subcontinent. This marked the beginning of [[Company rule in India]], when the HEIC emerged as the most powerful military force in the subcontinent. The British Parliament gradually withdrew the monopoly of the HEIC. By the 1850s, the HEIC struggled with finances.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">William Dalrymple (10 September 2019).

In the early 20th-century, Bengal emerged as a hotbed of the [[Indian independence movement]], as well as the epicenter of the [[Bengali Renaissance]].     \n\nBengal was the economic, cultural and educational hub of the [[British Raj]]. During the period of [[proto-industrialization]], Bengal significantly contributed directly to the [[Industrial revolution]] in Britain, although it was soon overtaken by the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] ruled by [[Tipu Sultan]] as [[South Asia]]'s dominant economic power.<ref name=\"Parthasarathi\">{{Citation |title=Why Europe Grew Rich and Asia Did Not: Global Economic Divergence, 1600\u20131850 |given=Prasannan |surname=Parthasarathi |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-139-49889-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_YEcvo-jqcC}}</ref> When Bengal was reorganized, [[Penang]], [[Singapore]] and [[Malacca]] were separated into the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1867.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/bd541c73-58ef-4bb1-9de7-173f00913286 |title=The Straits Settlements becomes a residency - Singapore History |publisher=Eresources.nlb.gov.sg |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> [[British Burma]] became a province of India and a later a [[Crown Colony]] in itself.

The governance of the company was placed in the hands of a governor and a 24-member Court of Directors. The corporation became known as the Honourable East India Company (HEIC). It rose to account for half of the world's trade. The company was given a monopoly for British trade in the Indian ocean.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>  \n \nIn 1608, [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Jahangir]] allowed the English East India Company to establish a small trading post on the west coast of India. It was followed in 1611 by a [[factory (trading post)|factory]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]] in South India, and in 1612 the company joined other already established European trading companies to trade in the wealthy [[Bengal Subah]] in the east.<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. II|1908|pp=452\u2013472}}</ref> However, the power of the Mughal Empire declined from 1707, as the Nawab of Bengal in [[Murshidabad]] became financially independent with the help of bankers such as the [[Jagat Seth]]. The Nawabs began entering into treaties with numerous European companies, including the [[French East India Company]], the [[Dutch East India Company]], and the [[Danish East India Company]]. The Mughal court in [[Delhi]] was weakened by [[Nader Shah]]'s invasion from Persia (1739) and [[Ahmed Shah Durrani]]'s invasion from Afghanistan (1761). The East India Company's victories at the [[Battle of Plassey]] (against the last independent Nawab of Bengal in 1757) and the [[Battle of Buxar]] (against the Nawabs of Bengal and [[Nawab of Oudh|Oudh]] in 1764) led to the abolition of local rule (Nizamat) in Bengal in 1793. The Company gradually began to formally expand its territories across India and [[Southeast Asia]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol.

Acting through [[Lord Cornwallis]], then Governor-General, he ascertained and defined the rights of the landholders over the soil. These landholders under the previous system had started, for the most part, as collectors of the revenues, and gradually acquired certain prescriptive rights as quasi-proprietors of the estates entrusted to them by the government. In 1793 Lord Cornwallis declared their rights perpetual, and gave over the land of Bengal to the previous quasi-proprietors or ''zamindars'', on condition of the payment of a fixed land tax. This piece of legislation is known as the [[Permanent Settlement]] of the Land Revenue. It was designed to \"introduce\" ideas of property rights to India, and stimulate a market in land. The former aim misunderstood the nature of landholding in India, and the latter was an abject failure.\n\nThe ''Cornwallis Code'', while defining the rights of the proprietors, failed to give adequate recognition to the rights of the under-tenants and the cultivators. This remained a serious problem for the duration of British Rule, as throughout the Bengal Presidency ''ryots'' (peasants) found themselves oppressed by rack-renting landlords, who knew that every rupee they could squeeze from their tenants over and above the fixed revenue demanded from the Government represented pure profit. Furthermore, the Permanent Settlement took no account of inflation, meaning that the value of the revenue to Government declined year by year, whilst the heavy burden on the peasantry grew no less. This was compounded in the early 19th century by compulsory schemes for the cultivation of [[opium]] and [[indigo]], the former by the state, and the latter by British planters. Peasants were forced to grow a certain area of these crops, which were then purchased at below market rates for export. This added greatly to rural poverty.\n\nSo unsuccessful was the Permanent Settlement that it was not introduced in the North-Western Provinces (taken from the Marathas during the campaigns of [[Lord Lake]] and [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]]) after 1831, in Punjab after its conquest in 1849, or in [[Oudh]] which was annexed in 1856. These regions were nominally part of the Bengal Presidency, but remained administratively distinct. The area of the Presidency under direct administration was sometimes referred to as Lower Bengal to distinguish it from the Presidency as a whole. Officially Punjab, Agra and Allahabad had Lieutenant-Governors subject to the authority of the Governor of Bengal in Calcutta, but in practice they were more or less independent. The only all-Presidency institutions which remained were the Bengal Army and the Civil Service. The Bengal Army was finally amalgamated into the new [[British-Indian Army]] in 1904\u20135, after a lengthy struggle over its reform between [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], the Commander-in-Chief, and [[Lord Curzon]], the Viceroy.\n\n===Straits Settlements===\nIn 1830, the British Straits Settlements on the coast of the [[Malacca Straits]] was made a residency of the Presidency of Bengal in Calcutta. The area included the erstwhile [[Prince of Wales Island (Malaysia)|Prince of Wales Island]] and [[Province Wellesley]], as well as the ports of [[Malacca]] and [[Singapore]]. Previously, the Straits Settlements (formed by the HEIC in 1826) was administered as a separate presidency with [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] as the capital. However, the presidency was found to be too costly to administer. Hence, the HEIC decided to reduce the status of the Straits Settlements from a presidency to a residency of the Presidency of Bengal, which was under the governor-general of India based in Calcutta.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> As a residency, all administrative decisions and legislations concerning the Straits Settlements were made in Calcutta, and the governor of the Straits Settlements became a mere resident without executive and legislative powers. Overall, this arrangement proved to be ineffective. Without proper representation in Calcutta and due to the distance between the Straits Settlements and Calcutta, the Indian government found it difficult to advance their interests in the Straits such as by cultivating better ties with the Malay states.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nNonetheless, the Straits Settlements remained in the Presidency of Bengal for more than three decades. During this period, the Straits Settlements underwent a number of administrative changes. In 1832, Singapore replaced George Town as the capital of the Straits Settlements. In 1851, direct control over the Straits Settlements was transferred to the Governor-General of India in Calcutta. Under the administration of the East India Company, the Settlements were used as [[penal settlements]] for Indian civilian and military prisoners,<ref>Anderson, C (2007) ''The Indian Uprising of 1857\u20138: prisons, prisoners, and rebellion'', Anthem Press.

The [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong]], [[Dhaka Division|Dhaka]] and [[Rajshahi Division|Rajshahi]] divisions, the [[Malda District]] and the States of [[Tripura (princely state)|Hill Tripura]], [[Sylhet]] and [[Comilla]] were transferred from Bengal to a new province, [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]]; the five Hindi-speaking states of [[Chota Nagpur States|Chota Nagpur]], namely [[Changbhakar State|Changbhakar]], [[Koriya State|Korea]], [[Surguja State|Surguja]], [[Udaipur State, Chhattisgarh|Udaipur]] and [[Jashpur State]], were transferred from Bengal to the Central Provinces; and [[Sambalpur State]] and the five Oriya states of [[Bamra State|Bamra]], [[Rairakhol State|Rairakhol]], [[Sonepur State|Sonepur]], [[Patna State|Patna]] and [[Kalahandi State|Kalahandi]] were transferred from the [[Central Provinces]] to Bengal.\n\nThe province of West Bengal then consisted of the thirty-three districts of [[Burdwan District|Burdwan]], [[Birbhum District|Birbhum]], [[Bankura]], [[Midnapur]], [[Hooghly District|Hughli]], [[Howrah]], [[Twenty-four Parganas]], [[Calcutta]], [[Nadia District|Nadia]], [[Murshidabad]], [[Jessore]], [[Khulna]], [[Patna]], [[Gaya, India|Gaya]], [[Shahabad District|Shahabad]], [[Saran district|Saran]], [[Champaran District|Champaran]], [[Muzaffarpur District|Muzaffarpur]], [[Darbhanga]], [[Monghyr]], [[Bhagalpur]], [[Purnea]], [[Santhal Parganas]], [[Cuttack]], [[Balasore]], [[Angul]] and [[Kandhmal]], [[Puri]], [[Sambalpur]], [[Singhbhum]], [[Hazaribagh]], [[Ranchi]], [[Palamau]], and [[Manbhum]]. The [[princely states]] of [[Sikkim]] and the [[tributary state]]s of [[Odisha]] and [[Chhota Nagpur States|Chhota Nagpur]] were not part of Bengal, but British relations with them were managed by its government.\n\nThe [[Indian Councils Act 1909]] expanded the legislative councils of Bengal and Eastern Bengal and Assam provinces to include up to 50 nominated and elected members, in addition to three ''ex officio'' members from the executive council.<ref>Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine (1907). \"Appendix II: Constitution of the Legislative Councils under the Regulations of November 1909\", in ''The Government of India''. Clarendon Press. pp. 431.</ref>\n\nBengal's legislative council included 22 nominated members, of which not more than 17 could be officials, and two nominated experts. Of the 26 elected members, one was elected by the [[Corporation of Calcutta]], six by municipalities, six by district boards, one by the [[University of Calcutta]], five by landholders, four by Muslims, two by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce, and one by the Calcutta Trades Association. Eastern Bengal and Assam's legislative council included 22 nominated members, of which not more than 17 be officials and one representing Indian commerce, and two nominated experts. Of the 18 elected members, three were elected by municipalities, five by district and local boards, two by landowners, four by Muslims, two by the tea interest, one by the jute interest, and one by the Commissioners of the [[Port of Chittagong]].<ref>Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine (1907). \"Appendix II: Constitution of the Legislative Councils under the Regulations of November 1909\", in ''The Government of India''. Clarendon Press. pp. 432\u20135.</ref>\n\nThe partition of Bengal proved highly controversial, as it resulted in a largely Hindu West Bengal and a largely Muslim East. Serious popular agitation followed the step, partly on the grounds that this was part of a cynical policy of divide and rule, and partly that the Bengali population, the centre of whose interests and prosperity was Calcutta, would now be divided under two governments, instead of being concentrated and numerically dominant under the one, while the bulk would be in the new division. In 1906\u20131909 the unrest developed to a considerable extent, requiring special attention from the Indian and Home governments, and this led to the decision being reversed in 1911.\n\n===Reorganisation of Bengal, 1912===\nAt the [[Delhi Durbar]] on 12 December 1911, King George V announced the transfer of the seat of the Government of India from Calcutta to Delhi, the reunification of the five predominantly Bengali-speaking divisions into a Presidency (or province) of Bengal under a Governor, the creation of a new province of [[Bihar and Orissa Province|Bihar and Orissa]] under a lieutenant-governor, and that [[Assam Province]] would be reconstituted under a chief commissioner. On 21 March 1912 [[Thomas Gibson-Carmichael, 1st Baron Carmichael|Thomas Gibson-Carmichael]] was appointed Governor of Bengal; prior to that date the Governor-General of India had also served as the governor of Bengal Presidency. On 22 March the provinces of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa and Assam were constituted.<ref>Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine (1922). ''The Government of India'', Third Edition, revised and updated.

Bengal remained in its 1912 boundaries until Independence in 1947, when it was again partitioned between the dominions of India and Pakistan.\n\n===1947 Partition of Bengal===\nThe British government considered the possibility of an [[United Bengal|independent, undivided Bengal]]. The partition was opposed by the last Governor of Bengal Sir [[Frederick Burrows]].<ref>''The Transfer of Power in India'' By [[V.P. Menon]]</ref> On May 8, 1947, Viceroy [[Earl Mountbatten]] cabled the British government with a partition plan that made an exception for Bengal. It was the only province that would be allowed to remain independent should it  choose to do so. On May 23, the British Cabinet meeting also hoped that Bengal would remain united. British Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] informed the [[US Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] on 2 June 1947 that there was a\"distinct possibility Bengal might decide against partition and against joining either Hindustan or Pakistan\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Shoaib Daniyal |url=https://scroll.in/article/907754/why-did-british-prime-minister-attlee-think-bengal-was-going-to-be-an-independent-country-in-1947 |title=Why did British prime minister Attlee think Bengal was going to be an independent country in 1947? |publisher=Scroll.in |date=2019-01-06 |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> On 6 June 1947, the [[Sylhet referendum]] gave a mandate for [[Sylhet Division]] to be re-united into Bengal. However, Hindu nationalist leaders in West Bengal and conservative East Bengali Muslim leaders were against the prospect. \n\nOn 20 June 1947, the Bengal Legislative Assembly met to vote on partition plans. At the preliminary joint session, the assembly decided by 120 votes to 90 that it should remain united if it joined the new Constituent Assembly of Pakistan. Later, a separate meeting of legislators from West Bengal decided by 58 votes to 21 that the province should be partitioned and that West Bengal should join the existing Constituent Assembly of India. In another separate meeting of legislators from East Bengal, it was decided by 106 votes to 35 that the province should not be partitioned and 107 votes to 34 that East Bengal should join Pakistan in the event of partition.<ref>Mukherjee, Soumyendra Nath (1987).

The governor of Bengal was concurrently the governor-general of India for many years. The East India Company maintained control with its private armies and administrative machinery. Nevertheless, the East India Company was a quasi-official entity, having received a [[Royal Charter]] from [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in 1600. The [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] caused the British government to assume direct control of India's administration under the [[Government of India Act, 1858]]. The head of state became the [[British monarch]], who was also given the title of [[Emperor of India]]/[[Empress of India]]. The monarch was represented through a viceroy. The [[Viceroy of India]] was based in the Bengal Presidency until 1911. The [[Secretary of State for India]] was also an important official. The Bengal Civil Service managed the provincial government.

XXIX of 1837 passed by the President of the Council of India in Council on 20 November 1837.\n\n===Judiciary===\n[[File:Calcutta High Court 1860.jpg|thumb|Calcutta High Court, 1860s]]\nThe [[Calcutta High Court]] was set up in 1862. The building was designed on the model of [[Ypres Cloth Hall]] in Belgium. The [[Dhaka High Court|Dacca High Court]] building was built during the early 20th century, with elements of a Roman [[pantheon]]. District courts were established in all district headquarters of the Bengal Presidency. At the district level, tax collectors and revenue officers acted with the power of [[magistrates]]. In 1814, the East India Company pressed the Bengal Government to consider the [[Madras Presidency]]'s model of uniting of judicial and executive powers at the district level. Ultimately Lord Hastings government empowered the Governor General-in-Council by Regulation IV of 1821 to authorize the Collectors and Revenue Officers to exercise powers of magistrates. In 1829, magisterial power was given to all Collectors and Revenue Officers. The controversy regarding the lack of [[separation of powers]] continued until 1921. During the period from 1853 to 1921, as many as four reports were prepared on the issue of separation of the judiciary from the executive. The first was in 1893, the second in 1900, the third in 1908 and the fourth in 1913. The Islington Commission was formed by the Secretary of State for India in 1912 to enquire into the problems of judicial administration in India. In its report submitted on August 14, 1915; the Commission opined that legislation would be necessary to effect separation of executive and judicial functions of the officers. Despite these reports, the structure as laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure continued until 1921. On April 5, 1921 the Bengal Legislative Council adopted the following resolution: \"This Council recommends to the Government that early steps be taken for the separation of the judiciary from the executive functions in the administration of this Presidency.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Separation_of_the_Judiciary |title=Separation of the Judiciary - Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n \n===Bengal Legislative Council (1862-1947)===\n{{Main article|Bengal Legislative Council}}\n{{See also|Legislative Council of Eastern Bengal and Assam}}\n[[File:The Town Hall, Calcutta in the 1860s.jpg|thumb|The Legislative Council met in Calcutta Town Hall]]\nThe British government began to appoint legislative councils under the [[Indian Councils Act 1861]]. The Bengal Legislative Council was established in 1862. It was one of the largest and most important legislative councils in British India. Over the years, the council's powers were gradually expanded from an advisory role to debating government policies and enacting legislation. Under the [[Government of India Act, 1935]], the council became the [[upper chamber]] of the Bengali legislature. \n\n===Dyarchy (1920\u201337)===\nBritish India's [[Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms]] of 1919, enacted in 1921, expanded the Bengal Legislative Council to 140 members to include more elected Indian members. The reforms also introduced the principle of [[dyarchy]], whereby certain responsibilities such as agriculture, health, education, and local government, were transferred to elected ministers. However, the important portfolios like finance, police and irrigation were reserved with members of the Governor's Executive Council. Some of the prominent ministers were [[Surendranath Banerjee]] (Local Self-government and Public Health 1921-1923), Sir Provash Chunder Mitter (Education 1921\u20131924, Local Self-government, Public Health, Agriculture and Public Works 1927\u20131928), Nawab Saiyid Nawab Ali Chaudhuri (Agriculture and Public Works) and [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]] (Education 1924). [[Bhupendra Nath Bose]] and [[Abdur Rahim (judge)|Sir Abdur Rahim]] were Executive Members in the Governor's Council.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Working Of Dyarchy In India 1919 1928|publisher=D.B.Taraporevala Sons And Company.|url=https://archive.org/details/workingofdyarchy029425mbp}}</ref>\n\n===Bengal Legislative Assembly (1935-1947)===      \n{{Main article|Bengal Legislative Assembly}}\n[[File:Bengal PMs.png|thumb|Statesmen who served as the [[Prime Minister of Bengal]]]]\nThe Government of India Act, 1935 established the Bengal Legislative Assembly as the lower chamber of the Bengali legislature. It was a 250-seat assembly where most members were elected by either the General Electorate or the Muslim Electorate (under the [[Communal Award]]). Other members were nominated. The separate electorate dividing Muslims from the general electorate was deeply controversial. The [[Prime Minister of Bengal]] was a member of the assembly.   \n\nIn the [[1937 Indian provincial elections|elections held in 1937]], the [[Indian National Congress]] won a maximum of 54 seats but declined to form the government. The [[Krishak Praja Party]] of [[A. K.

Local legislation was enacted by the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly. [[Case law]] was also an important source of law. Many laws enacted in British Bengal are still in use today, including the [[Indian Penal Code]]. In 1919, the [[Rowlatt Act]] gave extensive powers to the British government and police, and allowed indefinite arrest and detention of individuals, warrant-less searches and seizures, restrictions on public gatherings, and intensive censorship of media and publications. The public opposition to this act eventually led to mass campaigns of non-violent civil disobedience throughout the country demanding guaranteed civil freedoms, and limitations on government power.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Despite being a common law jurisdiction, British India did not enjoy the same level of protection for civil liberties as in the United Kingdom. It was only after independence in 1947 and the adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948, that human rights were clearly enshrined in law.     \n\n==Education==\n[[File:A statue at victoria memorial. kolkata.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of [[Lord William Bentinck]] in Calcutta Victoria Memorial.

There were only two full-fledged universities in Bengal during British rule, including the University of Calcutta and the University of Dacca. Both universities were represented in the Bengal Legislative Assembly under the Government of India Act, 1935. \n\nPrimary education was mandatory under the Compulsory Education Acts.<ref name=\"banglapedia1\">{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Education |title=Education - Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> Despite significant advances and the emergence of a large educated middle class, most of the population did not have access to a proper education. During 1946-47, there were 5,298 high schools with an enrolment of 21,99,000 pupils whereas the corresponding figures for 1916-17 were 1,507 and 57,200. The demand for secondary education increased with the growth of political consciousness amongst the masses. The result was the establishment of schools in villages and towns where backward communities could enroll. Female education too received a good deal of attention during the period. Consequently, between 1921-22 and 1946-47, the number of educational institutions for girls nearly doubled.<ref name=\"banglapedia1\"/> Some of the leading schools included the [[Oriental Seminary]] in Calcutta, the [[St. Gregory's High School]] in Dacca, the [[Rajshahi Collegiate School]] in Rajshahi and the [[Chittagong Collegiate School]] in Chittagong. European missionaries, Hindu philanthropists and Muslim aristocrats were influential promoters of education. Ethnic minorities maintained their own institutions, such as the Armenian [[Pogose School]]. \n\nEach district of Bengal had a [[List of Zilla Schools of Bangladesh|district school]], which were the leading secondary institutions. Due to Calcutta being the colonial capital, the city had a large concentration of educational institutions. It was followed by Dacca, which served as a provincial capital between 1905 and 1912. Libraries were established in each district of Bengal by the colonial government and the [[Zamindar]]s. In 1854, four major public libraries were opened, including the Bogra Woodburn Library, the Rangpur Public Library, the Jessore Institute Public Library and the Barisal Public Library. [[Northbrook Hall]] was established in 1882 in honor of Governor-General [[Lord Northbrook]]. Other libraries built include the Victoria Public Library, Natore (1901), the Sirajganj Public Library (1882), the [[Rajshahi Public Library]] (1884), the Comilla Birchandra Library (1885), the Shah Makhdum Institute Public Library, Rajshahi (1891), the Noakhali Town Hall Public Library (1896), the Prize Memorial Library, Sylhet (1897), the Chittagong Municipality Public Library (1904) and the Varendra Research Library (1910).

There was a growing cultural awakening in [[Bengali Muslim]] society, including the emergence of [[Mir Mosharraf Hossain]] as the first Muslim novelist of Bengal; [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] as a celebrated poet who merged Bengali and Hindustani influences; [[Begum Rokeya]] and [[Nawab Faizunnesa]] as feminist educators; [[Kaykobad]] as an epic poet; and members of the [[Freedom of Intellect Movement]]. \n\nBengal played a major role in the [[Indian independence movement]] and the [[Pakistan movement]]. The earliest organized anti-colonial groups appeared in Bengal. The region produced many of the subcontinent's political leaders during the early 20th century. Political parties and rebel groups were formed across the region. \n\n===Architecture===\nCivic architecture began following European styles after the advent of the East India Company's authority. The [[Indo-Saracenic]] style, merging [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Indo-Islamic architecture|Indo-Islamic]] architecture, was started by British architects in the late 19th-century. While cities such as Calcutta and Dacca featured more civic architecture, [[country houses]] were built in many towns and villages across Bengal. [[Art deco]] influences began in the 1930s. Wealthy Bengali families (especially [[zamindar]] estates) employed European firms to design houses and palaces. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Architecture in British Bengal\" style=\"font-size:88%; line-height:130%; border-bottom:1px #aaa solid;\" heights=\"180\">\nThe Hooghly Bridge (BOND 0034).jpeg|[[Howrah Bridge]] in 1945\nVictoria Memorial, Calcutta - LIFE.jpg|[[Victoria Memorial, Kolkata]]\nWriters Building.jpg|[[Writer's Building]]\nRuplal House old.jpg|[[Ruplal House]]\nCompleted Bridge.

Historians have argued that the British used a policy of [[divide and rule]] among Hindus and Muslims. This meant favoring Hindus over Muslims and vice versa in certain sectors. For example, after the [[Permanent Settlement]], Hindu merchants such as the [[Tagore family]] were awarded large land grants that previously belonged to the Mughal aristocracy. In Calcutta, where Hindus formed a majority, wealthy Muslims were often given favors over Hindus. One aspect that benefitted the Hindu community was increased literacy rates. Many Muslims, however, remained alienated from English education after the abolition of Persian. Bengali society continued to experience religious nationalism which led to the partition of Bengal in 1947.\n\nBritish Bengali cities included a cosmopolitan population, including Armenians and Jews. [[Anglo-Indians]] formed a prominent part of the urban population.

They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader.

Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=54 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the vantage point of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''He said: \u201cI am leaving now\u201d'' versus ''He said (that) he was leaving immediately''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=55-64 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=12-13 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref>\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn spoken language, there are several ways to present a quotation. For example, the speaker may begin with a lead-in that relates a quotation to the topic currently being discussed, which may be followed by supplementary information on the person to be quoted, and finally the quotation itself.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McArthur |first1=Tom |last2=Lam-McArthur |first2=Jacqueline |last3=Fontaine |first3=Lisa |title=The Oxford Companion to the English Language$ The Oxford Companion to the English Language (2 ed.) |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191744389 |edition=2nd}}</ref> The quotation is introduced by a quotative marker.\n\n====Quotative markers====\n===== English =====\nIn English, the verb ''\"be like\"'' or ''\"said\"'' are being used as quotatives in American English. <ref> Frederica Barbieri.

The verb is usually a verb of communication or thought. In spoken Japanese, the use of pronouns and honorific form are commonly seen; yet, honorific form is not an evidence between direct and indirect speech. Thus, Japanese fails to distinguish between direct and indirect speech as shown in the above examples.\n<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\n====Nested quotations====\n====Crosslinguistic variations====\n\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame the quoter's own opinions.<ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69-98 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327?via%3Dihub | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are used to express reported speech, thoughts, or perceptions. <ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are markers equivalent to full verbs with meanings ''say, speak, mention, tell, etc.''\n<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5-25 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 !! \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000!!\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative evidentials=====\nQuotative evidentials provide knowledge of who or where information originated from in speech.

A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=54 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the vantage point of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''He said: \u201cI am leaving now\u201d'' versus ''He said (that) he was leaving immediately''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a well-formed declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=55-64 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other interlocutors. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=12-13 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref>\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn spoken language, there are several ways to present a quotation. For example, the speaker may begin with a lead-in that relates a quotation to the topic currently being discussed, which may be followed by supplementary information on the person to be quoted, and finally the quotation itself.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McArthur |first1=Tom |last2=Lam-McArthur |first2=Jacqueline |last3=Fontaine |first3=Lisa |title=The Oxford Companion to the English Language$ The Oxford Companion to the English Language (2 ed.) |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191744389 |edition=2nd}}</ref> The quotation is introduced by a quotative marker.\n\n====Quotative markers====\n===== English =====\nIn English, the verb ''\"be like\"'' or ''\"said\"'' are being used as quotatives in American English. <ref> Frederica Barbieri.

The verb is usually a verb of communication or thought. In spoken Japanese, the use of pronouns and honorific form are commonly seen; yet, honorific form is not an evidence between direct and indirect speech. Thus, Japanese fails to distinguish between direct and indirect speech as shown in the above examples.\n<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\n====Nested quotations====\n====Crosslinguistic variations====\n\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame the quoter's own opinions.<ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69-98 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327?via%3Dihub | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are used to express reported speech, thoughts, or perceptions. <ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are markers equivalent to full verbs with meanings ''say, speak, mention, tell, etc.''\n<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5-25 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 !! \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000!!\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative evidentials=====\nQuotative evidentials provide knowledge of who or where information originated from in speech.
