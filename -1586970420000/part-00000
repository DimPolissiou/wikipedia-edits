The video also thanks his fans for sticking with him through his YouTube career, referencing past notable videos.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/31/18275692/pewdiepie-tseries-feud-concession-diss-track |title=PewDiePie admits defeat to T-Series |last=Radulovic |first=Petrana |date=31 March 2019 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref><ref name=\"theverge\">{{cite web|last=Alexander |first=Julia|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/31/18289617/pewdiepie-tseries-congratulations-subscribe-youtube-diss-track-100-million|title=PewDiePie concedes to T-Series in battle for YouTube's biggest channel|work=[[The Verge]]|date=31 March 2019|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47042761 |title=PewDiePie concedes defeat to YouTube rival T-Series |date=1 April 2019 |work=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\nThe day after the song was uploaded to YouTube, PewDiePie regained his lead against T-Series.<ref name=Tobin2019>{{cite web|last=Tobin|first=Ben|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/04/02/pewdiepie-back-top-biggest-youtube-channel-over-t-series/3339914002/|title=PewDiePie back on top as largest YouTube channel over Indian music label T-Series|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2 April 2019|accessdate=3 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404024138/https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/04/02/pewdiepie-back-top-biggest-youtube-channel-over-t-series/3339914002/|archive-date=4 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Eight days after the release of \"Congratulations,\" both music videos were banned in India when the [[Delhi High Court]] granted an injunction in favor of T-Series.<ref name=Pardiwalla2019>{{cite web|last=Pardiwalla|first=Tanzim|url=https://in.mashable.com/culture/2952/did-the-high-court-just-pick-sides-in-the-t-series-vs-pewdiepie-war-banning-diss-tracks|title=Did The High Court Just Pick Sides In the T-Series vs PewDiePie War, Banning Diss Tracks?|work=[[Mashable|Mashable India]]|date=12 April 2019|accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=Hale2019>{{cite web|last=Hale|first=Jame|url=https://www.tubefilter.com/2019/04/15/t-series-court-order-sees-abusive-vulgar-racist-pewdiepie-diss-tracks-blocked-in-india/|title=T-Series Court Order Sees \"Abusive, Vulgar, Racist\" PewDiePie Diss Tracks Blocked In India|work=[[Tubefilter]]|date=15 April 2019|access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref> Although both parties came to a settlement later in the year, PewDiePie's videos remain blocked in India.<ref name=Ghosh2019b>{{cite web|last=Ghosh|first=Shona|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/pewdiepie-and-t-series-settle-youtube-legal-dispute-2019-8|title=PewDiePie and T-Series quietly settled a court battle over 'racist' diss tracks following their epic YouTube battle|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=13 August 2019|accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 October 2019, following PewDiePie's surpassing 100 million subscribers and a few months of Minecraft gameplay videos, PewDiePie released \"Mine All Day (Minecraft music video)\".

The video also thanks his fans for sticking with him through his YouTube career, referencing past notable videos.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/31/18275692/pewdiepie-tseries-feud-concession-diss-track |title=PewDiePie admits defeat to T-Series |last=Radulovic |first=Petrana |date=31 March 2019 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref><ref name=\"theverge\">{{cite web|last=Alexander |first=Julia|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/31/18289617/pewdiepie-tseries-congratulations-subscribe-youtube-diss-track-100-million|title=PewDiePie concedes to T-Series in battle for YouTube's biggest channel|work=[[The Verge]]|date=31 March 2019|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47042761 |title=PewDiePie concedes defeat to YouTube rival T-Series |date=1 April 2019 |work=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\nThe day after the song was uploaded to YouTube, PewDiePie regained his lead against T-Series.<ref name=Tobin2019>{{cite web|last=Tobin|first=Ben|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/04/02/pewdiepie-back-top-biggest-youtube-channel-over-t-series/3339914002/|title=PewDiePie back on top as largest YouTube channel over Indian music label T-Series|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2 April 2019|accessdate=3 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404024138/https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/04/02/pewdiepie-back-top-biggest-youtube-channel-over-t-series/3339914002/|archive-date=4 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Eight days after the release of \"Congratulations,\" both music videos were banned in India when the [[Delhi High Court]] granted an injunction in favor of T-Series.<ref name=Pardiwalla2019>{{cite web|last=Pardiwalla|first=Tanzim|url=https://in.mashable.com/culture/2952/did-the-high-court-just-pick-sides-in-the-t-series-vs-pewdiepie-war-banning-diss-tracks|title=Did The High Court Just Pick Sides In the T-Series vs PewDiePie War, Banning Diss Tracks?|work=[[Mashable|Mashable India]]|date=12 April 2019|accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=Hale2019>{{cite web|last=Hale|first=Jame|url=https://www.tubefilter.com/2019/04/15/t-series-court-order-sees-abusive-vulgar-racist-pewdiepie-diss-tracks-blocked-in-india/|title=T-Series Court Order Sees \"Abusive, Vulgar, Racist\" PewDiePie Diss Tracks Blocked In India|work=[[Tubefilter]]|date=15 April 2019|access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref> Although both parties came to a settlement later in the year, PewDiePie's videos remain blocked in India.<ref name=Ghosh2019b>{{cite web|last=Ghosh|first=Shona|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/pewdiepie-and-t-series-settle-youtube-legal-dispute-2019-8|title=PewDiePie and T-Series quietly settled a court battle over 'racist' diss tracks following their epic YouTube battle|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=13 August 2019|accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 October 2019, following PewDiePie's surpassing 100 million subscribers and a few months of Minecraft gameplay videos, PewDiePie released \"Mine All Day (Minecraft music video)\".

Emphasis during training was also given to improving Cadets\u2019 written and verbal communication skills with the purpose of improving their self confidence when addressing or briefing others. When it was necessary, individual/one on one Lecturing skills training was carried out that proved to be highly successful. Training activities in the field were conducted such as [[Map|map reading]], [[navigation]], [[first aid]], basic [[Radiotelephony procedure|RT]] procedures and [[survival skills]]. The [[Physical education|Physical Training]] included gymnasium work, [[obstacle course]]s and speed marches (often with loaded [[Backpack|Bergens]]) to improve Cadets\u2019 levels of physical fitness. \u2018Log runs\u2019 were conducted where teams of Cadets raced each other while each team carried a [[Utility pole|telegraph pole]] sized log - these were frequent events that all formed part of Rowallan's [[team building]] ethos. Did me no harm at all. Excellent lifetime experience.\n\nThe Division conducted many exercises in the field and used [[Dartmoor]], [[Bodmin Moor]], [[Snowdonia]] and the [[Brecon Beacons]] (including the [[Pen y Fan]] horseshoe). These exercises progressed thRough increasing levels of physical and mental duress while requiring Cadets to be individually selected at random intervals to plan, manage and organise a particular task that required innovation, imagination, demonstration of a command ability and good communication skills with the team. Cadets became very adept to \u2018expect the unexpected\u2019 that, with the background of their leadership training, assisted them in being able to think and act decisively when under duress.\u00a0 Where environmental conditions required it as a matter of safety, cadets were issued with the then in service [[Clansman (military radio)|Clansman]] combat net radio system. In early exercises Cadets slept in tents and ate standard 24-hour [[Field ration|ration packs]]. In later exercises cadets had to make [[Bivouac shelter|improvised shelters]] and were supplied with live rations in the form of hens and rabbits which had to be killed humanely under instruction and prepared by hand.

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the {{convert|6.1|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the {{convert|6.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a loop on both sides of the [[Willamette River]], crossing the river on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The route connects Portland's [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown]], [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]], [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], and [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the Portland's [[NS Line|first modern streetcar line]] on the west side. After several years of planning, the city council approved the Eastside Loop extension in 2008 and the line's groundbreaking was held the following year. The extension's first {{convert|3.3|mi|km}} opened between the Broadway Bridge and OMSI on September 22, 2012. It was inaugurated by the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line''') service, which ran an additional {{convert|1.1|mi|km}} alongside the NS Line on 10th and 11th avenues. The CL Line re-branded in 2015 during the opening of Tilikum Crossing, which completed the streetcar loop with a southerly river crossing extension from OMSI to the South Waterfront.\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

system. Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the {{convert|6.1|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the {{convert|6.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a loop on both sides of the [[Willamette River]], crossing the river on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The route connects Portland's [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown]], [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]], [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], and [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the Portland's [[NS Line|first modern streetcar line]] on the west side. After several years of planning, the city council approved the Eastside Loop extension in 2008 and the line's groundbreaking was held the following year. The extension's first {{convert|3.3|mi|km}} opened between the Broadway Bridge and OMSI on September 22, 2012. It was inaugurated by the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line''') service, which ran an additional {{convert|1.1|mi|km}} alongside the NS Line on 10th and 11th avenues. The CL Line re-branded in 2015 during the opening of Tilikum Crossing, which completed the streetcar loop with a southerly river crossing extension from OMSI to the South Waterfront.\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

Changes to the propulsion system necessitated changes to the streetcar design in order for the streetcar to accommodate a different form factor; this ultimately delayed the project and raised the cost of manufacturing.<ref name=\"oreg-2011jul19\">{{cite news |last=Schmidt |first=Brad |title=Portland's $148.3 million eastside streetcar project delayed five months, includes five streetcars instead of six |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=July 19, 2011 |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2011/07/portlands_1483_million_eastsid.html |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Opening and closing of the loop===\n\nThe {{convert|3.3|mi|km|adj=on}} eastside extension opened on September 22, 2012, after a five-month-long delay.<ref name=\"PS-History\">{{cite web|title=Streetcar History |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/33 |publisher=Portland Streetcar |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013400/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/33 |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Schmidt |first=Brad |date=July 19, 2011 |title=Portland's $148.3 million eastside streetcar project delayed five months, includes five streetcars instead of six |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2011/07/portlands_1483_million_eastsid.html |newspaper=The Oregonian |accessdate=September 17, 2015}}</ref> Due to overlapping sections, the new eastside service was branded the \"Central Loop Line\" (abbreviated as CL Line) and the original service on the west side was renamed the \"North South Line\" (NS Line).<ref name=\"ps-map-2012\">{{cite map |url=https://www.portlandstreetcar.org/pdf/map_printable5.pdf |title=Streetcar Route Map |publisher=Portland Streetcar, Inc. |date=September 2012 |access-date=October 1, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021024223/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/pdf/map_printable5.pdf |archive-date=October 21, 2012 |url-status=unfit}}</ref> The CL Line ran an additional {{convert|1.1|mi|km}} along the NS Line tracks on 10th and 11th avenues, between Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland and Northwest Northrup Street in the Pearl District, before it ran to the eastside for OMSI\u2014a total of {{convert|4.4|mi|km}}.<ref name=\"PS-History\"/> Service along the eastside segment initially operated with frequencies of 18 minutes instead of an originally planned 15 minutes due to funding cuts by TriMet and the City of Portland, as well as delays in streetcar delivery from United Streetcar.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rose |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Rose (journalist) |date=September 21, 2012 |title=Portland Streetcar's eastside loop gets off to hobbled start Saturday |url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/commuting/2012/09/portland_streetcars_eastside_l.html |newspaper=The Oregonian |accessdate=September 7, 2015}}</ref> The first car finally arrived in January 2013 and entered service on June 11, 2013.<ref name=\"oreg-2013jun12\">{{cite news|last=Schmidt|first=Brad|title=New streetcar rolls out in Portland<!--(print-edition headline)--> |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=June 12, 2013 |page=B1 |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2013/06/after_repeated_delays_portland.html |accessdate=August 6, 2013}}</ref> Fares were $1 upon opening due to TriMet's elimination of the [[Fareless Square|Free Rail Zone]].<ref>{{cite news |date=October 5, 2012 |title=Portland Streetcar Introduces 'Central Loop' Service |url=http://newsmanager.commpartners.com/aptapt/issues/2012-10-05/3.html |work=Passenger Transport |publisher=[[American Public Transportation Association]] |accessdate=September 8, 2015}}</ref> Approximately 3,200 riders per weekday used the line during the first two weeks of service.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2012/10/31/eastside-streetcar-carrying-the-wait.html |last=Giegerich |first=Andy |title=Eastside streetcar: Carrying the wait |newspaper=Portland Business Journal |date=October 31, 2012 |access-date=April 5, 2020 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n[[File:A Lloyd via Peral (21612375879).jpg|thumb|left|An A Loop streetcar on Tilikum Crossing in 2015]]\n\nThe second phase of the Eastside Loop project, referred to as \"Close the Loop\", extended the streetcar from OMSI to the NS Line tracks on Southwest Moody Avenue in the [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/321180 |title=Portland Streetcar System Concept Plan: A Framework for Future Corridor Planning and Alternatives Analysis |publisher=Portland Bureau of Transportation |date=September 9, 2009 |access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>{{rp|50}} This phase had awaited the construction of a new bridge for the Portland\u2013Milwaukie light rail project.
