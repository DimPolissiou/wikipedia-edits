Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''. Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t5v735k9h;view=1up;seq=30 From p. xxiv:] \"I shall therefore only add upon this subject, that if, by the term ''elements'', we mean to express those simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable we know nothing at all about them; but, if we apply the term ''elements'', or ''principles of bodies'', to express our idea of the last point which analysis is capable of reaching, we must admit, as elements, all substances into which we are capable, by any means, to reduce bodies by decomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation. However, Lavoisier's descriptions of his elements lack completeness, as he only classified them as metals and non-metals.\n\n[[File:Dalton's symbols of the elements. 1806 Wellcome M0004592.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.6|[[John Dalton|Dalton]] (1806): listing the known elements by atomic weight]]\n\nIn 1815, the British physician and chemist [[William Prout]] noticed that atomic weights seemed to be multiples of that of hydrogen.<ref>See:\n\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=November 1815|title=On the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744812;view=1up;seq=351|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=6|pages=321\u2013330}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=February 1816|title=Correction of a mistake in the essay on the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744820;view=1up;seq=135|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=7|pages=111\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nIn 1817, [[Johann Wolfgang D\u00f6bereiner]], a chemist, began to formulate one of the earliest attempts to classify the elements.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wurzer|first1=Ferdinand|title=Auszug eines Briefes vom Hofrath Wurzer, Prof. der Chemie zu Marburg|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=1817|volume=56|issue=7|pages=331\u2013334|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.096071138;view=1up;seq=351|trans-title=Excerpt of a letter from Court Advisor Wurzer, Professor of Chemistry at Marburg|language=German|doi=10.1002/andp.18170560709|bibcode=1817AnP....56..331.}} Here, D\u00f6bereiner found that strontium's properties were intermediate to those of calcium and barium.</ref> In 1829, he found that he could form some of the elements into groups of three, with the members of each group having related properties.

In 1864, a book of his was published; it contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, and classified elements into six families by their [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]\u2014for the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence. Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death. In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are properly ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group. The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table. By this time he had already seen the publication of Mendeleev's first periodic table, but his work appears to have been largely independent.<ref name=scerri06/>\n\nRussian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] arranged the elements by [[atomic mass]], corresponding to relative [[molar mass]].

Mendeleev also figured some spots in his ordering had no element to match, and he left gaps on account of future discoveries of these elements, using the elements before and after those missing ones to predict their properties.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table.

Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93).

Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation. However, Lavoisier's descriptions of his elements lack completeness, as he only classified them as metals and non-metals.\n\n[[File:Dalton's symbols of the elements. 1806 Wellcome M0004592.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.6|[[John Dalton|Dalton]] (1806): listing the known elements by atomic weight]]\n\nIn 1815, the British physician and chemist [[William Prout]] noticed that atomic weights seemed to be multiples of that of hydrogen.<ref>See:\n\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=November 1815|title=On the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744812;view=1up;seq=351|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=6|pages=321\u2013330}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=February 1816|title=Correction of a mistake in the essay on the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744820;view=1up;seq=135|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=7|pages=111\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nIn 1817, [[Johann Wolfgang D\u00f6bereiner]], a chemist, began to formulate one of the earliest attempts to classify the elements.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wurzer|first1=Ferdinand|title=Auszug eines Briefes vom Hofrath Wurzer, Prof. der Chemie zu Marburg|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=1817|volume=56|issue=7|pages=331\u2013334|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.096071138;view=1up;seq=351|trans-title=Excerpt of a letter from Court Advisor Wurzer, Professor of Chemistry at Marburg|language=German|doi=10.1002/andp.18170560709|bibcode=1817AnP....56..331.}} Here, D\u00f6bereiner found that strontium's properties were intermediate to those of calcium and barium.</ref> In 1829, he found that he could form some of the elements into groups of three, with the members of each group having related properties.

According to him, if the atomic weights were plotted as ordinates (i.e. vertically) and the atomic volumes as abscissae (i.e. horizontally)\u2014the curve obtained a series of maximums and minimums\u2014the most [[electropositive]] elements would appear at the peaks of the curve in the order of their atomic weights. In 1864, a book of his was published; it contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, and classified elements into six families by their [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]\u2014for the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence. Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death. In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are properly ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group. The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table. By this time he had already seen the publication of Mendeleev's first periodic table, but his work appears to have been largely independent.<ref name=scerri06/>\n\nRussian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] arranged the elements by [[atomic mass]], corresponding to relative [[molar mass]].

Mendeleev also figured some spots in his ordering had no element to match, and he left gaps on account of future discoveries of these elements, using the elements before and after those missing ones to predict their properties.

Any newly discovered elements will thus be placed in an eighth period.\n\nDespite the completion of the seventh period, experimental chemistry of some transactinides has been shown to be inconsistent with the periodic law. In the 1990s, Ken Czerwinski at [[University of California, Berkeley]] observed similarities between rutherfordium and plutonium and dubnium and protactinium, rather than a clear continuation of periodicity in groups&nbsp;4 and&nbsp;5. More recent experiments on [[copernicium]] and [[flerovium]] have yielded inconsistent results, some of which suggest that these elements behave more like the noble gas [[radon]] rather than mercury and lead, their respective [[congener (chemistry)|congener]]s. As such, the chemistry of many superheavy elements has yet to be well-characterized, and it remains unclear whether the periodic law can still be used to extrapolate the properties of undiscovered elements.<ref name=\"NYT-20190827\">{{cite news |last=Roberts |first=Siobhan |title=Is It Time to Upend the Periodic Table? - The iconic chart of elements has served chemistry well for 150 years.

His life before 1421 is unknown. In that year he was made an [[esquire]] (''\u00e9cuyer tranchant'') by [[Philip the Good]].

They conducted him to [[Mount Zion]], where he was placed in the care of the [[Conventual Franciscans]]. He wished to continue to visit the sites of the Holy Land, but on account of the political situation could not. He took an Arab ship from Jaffa to [[Beirut]] and there joined a mule team headed for [[Damascus]].

At Damascus he had negotiated with the leader of a caravan, Kodja Barqouq, making its way from [[Mecca]] to [[Bursa]]. On the condition that he wear the Turkish costume, so as not to endanger his fellow travellers, he was permitted to accompany the caravan. The riches from Mecca greatly impressed him.\n\nIn the caravan Bertrandon met and befriended a [[mameluke]], who taught him aspects of Turkish culture, cuisine and military custom. He also learned the rudiments of the [[Turkish language]]. The caravan stopped first in [[Antioch, Syria|Antioch]], crossed [[Lesser Armenia|Little Armenia]], and rounded the gulf of [[Alexandretta]]. The voyage across [[Asia Minor]] was relatively fast. At [[Iconium]] Bertrandon took leave of the caravan and joined an embassy headed to the [[Bey]]lik of [[Karamanids|Karaman]]. When he finally arrived in Bursa, he took up lodging with a local [[Florence|Florentine]] for ten days. At Bursa he joined a company of European merchants, a [[Spaniard]] and three Florentines, and followed them to [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]].\n\n[[File:Map of Constantinople (1422) by Florentine cartographer Cristoforo Buondelmonte.jpg|thumb|1422 map of Constantinople (Pera at top) by Florentine cartographer [[Cristoforo Buondelmonte]]]]\nIn [[Constantinople]] he took up with a [[Catalan people|Catalan]] merchant. The description of the city in his ''Voyage'' contains some interesting accounts of a [[joust]] and other ceremonies he attended, but very little on [[Byzantine architecture|the city's architecture]]. He records a low opinion of the [[John VIII Palaiologos|Emperor John VIII]], describing him as an impotent tributary of the Ottoman sultan.<ref name=atiya/>\n\n===Constantinople to Burgundy===\nBertrandon left Constantinople on 23 January 1433 in the company of [[Benedict Folco of Forl\u00ec]], the ambassador of [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], [[Duke of Milan]], heading to the court of the [[Ottoman dynasty|Ottoman sultan]] [[Murad II]] at [[Adrianople]], where they arrived late in February. Bertrandon records in his ''Voyage'' the sumptuous reception accorded the ambassador. On 12 March Bertrandon and Benedict left Adrianople. They visited [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Albania]], and [[Bosnia]]. He also visited [[Serbia]] and was well received by [[Despot (court title)|despot]] [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107|George Brankovic]]. Bertrandon records in his ''Voyage'' of this time that he found the Turks more friendly than Greeks.<ref name=atiya/> He and Benedict arrived in [[Belgrade]] on 12 April. It was there that Bertrandon began to think strategically about the conquest of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He describes Turkish armies, armour, administration, and military system. In his ''Voyage'' he presents a plan to unite [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of France|France]], and [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] against the Turks. He says the conquest would be easy, but it is the Greeks&mdash;not the Turks&mdash;who do not trust the Westerners; the possibility of an alliance with the Greeks is slim.<ref>Deno Geanakoplos (1975), [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/History/History-idx?type=article&did=HISTORY.CRUSTHREE.I0015&isize=M \"Byzantium and the Crusades, 1354&ndash;1453\"], ''The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries'', Harry W.

Albert presented him with the first opposition to his plans. From Vienna Bertrandon took six days to arrive at [[Linz]]. He took the route through [[Bavaria]] and [[Swabia]] to [[Basel]], where he attended a meeting of the [[Council of Basel]]. He reentered Burgundy at [[Montb\u00e9liard]]. At the abbey of [[Pothi\u00e8res]] in the [[C\u00f4te-d'Or|C\u00f4te d'Or]] early in July he reported to Philip the Good. He gave him a copy of the [[Koran]] and a life of [[Mohammed]] translated into [[Latin]] by the chaplain of the Venetian consul at Damascus. He also gave him his clothes and his horse, both acquired from the East.

Bertrandon records in his ''Voyage'' the sumptuous reception accorded the ambassador. On 12 March Bertrandon and Benedict left Adrianople. They visited [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Albania]], and [[Bosnia]]. He also visited [[Serbia]] and was well received by [[Despot (court title)|despot]] [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107|George Brankovic]]. Bertrandon records in his ''Voyage'' of this time that he found the Turks more friendly than Greeks.<ref name=atiya/> He and Benedict arrived in [[Belgrade]] on 12 April. It was there that Bertrandon began to think strategically about the conquest of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He describes Turkish armies, armour, administration, and military system. In his ''Voyage'' he presents a plan to unite [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of France|France]], and [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] against the Turks. He says the conquest would be easy, but it is the Greeks&mdash;not the Turks&mdash;who do not trust the Westerners; the possibility of an alliance with the Greeks is slim.<ref>Deno Geanakoplos (1975), [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/History/History-idx?type=article&did=HISTORY.CRUSTHREE.I0015&isize=M \"Byzantium and the Crusades, 1354&ndash;1453\"], ''The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries'', Harry W.

The Thirteen Colonies had very similar political, constitutional, and legal systems, and were dominated by Protestant English-speakers. The northern colonies were founded primarily for religious reasons, while the southern colonies were founded for financial profit and business expansion. All thirteen were part of [[British America|Britain's possessions]] in the New World, which also included colonies in Canada, Florida, and the Caribbean.\n\nThe colonial population grew from about 2,000 to 2.4 million between 1625 and 1775, sometimes displacing American Indians. This population included people subject to a system of [[Slavery in the colonial United States|slavery]] which was legal in all of the colonies prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref name=\"Rodriguez2007\">{{cite book|author=Junius P.

The [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363) against France and its Indian allies led to growing tensions between Britain and the Thirteen Colonies. During the 1750s, the colonies began collaborating with one another instead of dealing directly with Britain. These inter-colonial activities cultivated a sense of shared American identity and led to calls for protection of the colonists' \"[[Rights of Englishmen|Rights as Englishmen]]\", especially the principle of \"[[no taxation without representation]]\". Grievances with the British government led to the [[American Revolution]], in which the colonies worked together to form the [[Continental Congress]]. The colonists fought the American Revolutionary War (1775\u201383) with the aid of the [[Kingdom of France]] and, to a much smaller degree, the [[Dutch Republic]] and the [[Enlightenment in Spain|Kingdom of Spain]].<ref>Richard Middleton and Anne Lombard, ''Colonial America: A History to 1763'' (4th ed. 2011)</ref>\n\n== British colonies ==\nIn 1606, King [[James VI and I|James I of England]] granted charters to both the [[Plymouth Company]] and the [[London Company]] for the purpose of establishing permanent settlements in America. The London Company established the [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia]] in 1607, the first permanently settled English colony on the continent. The Plymouth Company founded the [[Popham Colony]] on the [[Kennebec River]], but it was short-lived. The [[Plymouth Council for New England]] sponsored several colonization projects, culminating with [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620 which was settled by English Puritan separatists, known today as the [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]].<ref>Richter, pp. 152\u201353</ref> The Dutch, Swedish, and French also established successful American colonies at roughly the same time as the English, but they eventually came under the English crown. The Thirteen Colonies were complete with the establishment of the [[Province of Georgia]] in 1732, although the term \"Thirteen Colonies\" became current only in the context of the [[American Revolution]].<ref>The number 13 is mentioned as early as 1720 by [[Abel Boyer]], ''The Political State of Great Britain'' vol. 19, [https://books.google.com/books?id=M31YAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA376 p. 376]: \"so in this Country we have Thirteen Colonies at least severally govern'd by their respective Commanders in Chief, according to their peculiar Laws and Constitutions.\" This includes Carolina as a single colony and does not include Georgia, but instead counts Nova Scotia and [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]] as British colonies.

It was a private venture, financed by a group of English [[Lords Proprietors]] who obtained a [[Royal Charter]] to the Carolinas in 1663, hoping that a new colony in the south would become profitable like Jamestown. Carolina was not settled until 1670, and even then the first attempt failed because there was no incentive for emigration to that area. Eventually, however, the Lords combined their remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area led by Sir [[John Colleton]]. The expedition located fertile and defensible ground at what became [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], originally Charles Town for [[Charles II of England]].<ref>Robert M. Weir, ''Colonial South Carolina: A History'' (1983).</ref>\n\n===New England===\nThe [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]] were a small group of Puritan separatists who felt that they needed to distance themselves physically from the Church of England, which they perceived as corrupted. They initially moved to the Netherlands, but eventually sailed to America in 1620 on the ''[[Mayflower]]''. Upon their arrival, they drew up the [[Mayflower Compact]], by which they bound themselves together as a united community, thus establishing the small [[Plymouth Colony]]. [[William Bradford (1590-1657)|William Bradford]] was their main leader. After its founding, other settlers traveled from England to join the colony.<ref>Nathaniel Philbrick, ''Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War Paperback'' (2007).</ref>\n\nMore Puritans immigrated in 1629 and established the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] with 400 settlers. They sought to reform the [[Church of England]] by creating a new, ideologically pure church in the New World. By 1640, [[Migration to New England (1620\u20131640)|20,000 had arrived]]; many died soon after arrival, but the others found a healthy climate and an ample food supply. The Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies together spawned other Puritan colonies in New England, including the [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]], [[Saybrook Colony|Saybrook]], and [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] colonies. During the 17th century, the New Haven and Saybrook colonies were absorbed by Connecticut.<ref>Francis J. Bremer, ''The Puritan Experiment: New England Society from Bradford to Edwards'' (1995).</ref>\n\n[[Roger Williams]] established [[Providence Plantations]] in 1636 on land provided by [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] sachem [[Canonicus]]. Williams was a Puritan who preached religious tolerance, [[separation of Church and State]], and a complete break with the Church of England. He was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony over theological disagreements; he founded the settlement based on an egalitarian constitution, providing for majority rule \"in civil things\" and \"liberty of conscience\" in religious matters.<ref name=\"taylor\"/><ref>Benjamin Woods Labaree, ''Colonial Massachusetts: a history'' (1979)</ref> In 1637, a second group including [[Anne Hutchinson]] established a second settlement on [[Aquidneck Island]], also known as Rhode Island.\n\nOther colonists settled to the north, mingling with adventurers and profit-oriented settlers to establish more religiously diverse colonies in [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] and [[Province of Maine|Maine]]. Massachusetts absorbed these small settlements when it made significant land claims in the 1640s and 1650s, but New Hampshire was eventually given a separate charter in 1679. Maine remained a part of Massachusetts until achieving statehood in 1820.\n\nIn 1685, King [[James II of England]] closed the legislatures and consolidated the New England colonies into the [[Dominion of New England]], putting the region under control of Governor [[Edmund Andros]]. In 1688, the colonies of New York, West Jersey, and East Jersey were added to the dominion. Andros was overthrown and the dominion was closed in 1689, after the [[Glorious Revolution]] deposed King James II; the former colonies were re-established.<ref name=\"HallLederKammen2012\">{{cite book|editor1=Michael G.

In 1626, [[Peter Minuit]] purchased the island of [[Manhattan]] from the [[Lenape]] Indians and established the outpost of [[New Amsterdam]].<ref>Richter, pp. 138\u201340</ref> Relatively few Dutch settled in New Netherland, but the colony came to dominate the regional fur trade.<ref>Richter, pp. 159\u2013\n60</ref> It also served as the base for extensive trade with the English colonies, and many products from New England and Virginia were carried to Europe on Dutch ships.<ref>Richter pp. 212\u201313</ref> The Dutch also engaged in the burgeoning [[Atlantic slave trade]], supplying enslaved Africans to the English colonies in North America and [[Barbados]].<ref>Richter pp. 214\u201315</ref> The West India Company desired to grow New Netherland as it became commercially successful, yet the colony failed to attract the same level of settlement as the English colonies did. Many of those who did immigrate to the colony were English, [[German people|German]], [[Walloons|Walloon]], or [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]].<ref>Richter pp. 215\u201317</ref>\n\nIn 1638, Sweden established the colony of [[New Sweden]] in the [[Delaware Valley]]. The operation was led by former members of the Dutch West India Company, including Peter Minuit.<ref>Richter, p. 150</ref> New Sweden established extensive trading contacts with English colonies to the south, and shipped much of the tobacco produced in Virginia.<ref>Richter p. 213</ref> The colony was conquered by the Dutch in 1655,<ref>Richter, p. 262</ref> while Sweden was engaged in the [[Second Northern War]].\n\nBeginning in the 1650s, the English and Dutch engaged in a [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|series of wars]], and the English sought to conquer New Netherland.<ref>Richter pp. 247\u201348</ref> [[Richard Nicolls]] captured the lightly defended New Amsterdam in 1664, and his subordinates quickly captured the remainder of New Netherland.<ref>Richter, pp. 248\u201349</ref> The 1667 [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] ended the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] and confirmed English control of the region.<ref>Richter, p. 249</ref> The Dutch briefly regained control of parts of New Netherland in the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]], but surrendered claim to the territory in the 1674 [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]], ending the Dutch colonial presence in North America.<ref>Richter p. 261</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], the British renamed the colony \"York City\" or \"New York\". Large numbers of Dutch remained in the colony, dominating the rural areas between New York City and Albany, while people from New England started moving in as well as immigrants from Germany. New York City attracted a large polyglot population, including a large black slave population.<ref>Michael G. Kammen, ''Colonial New York: A History'' (1974).</ref> In 1674, the proprietary colonies of [[East Jersey]] and [[West Jersey]] were created from lands formerly part of New York.<ref>John E. Pomfret, ''Colonial New Jersey: A History'' (1973).</ref>\n\nPennsylvania was founded in 1681 as a proprietary colony of Quaker [[William Penn]]. The main population elements included the Quaker population based in Philadelphia, a Scotch-Irish population on the Western frontier, and numerous German colonies in between.<ref>Joseph E. Illick, ''Colonial Pennsylvania: a history'' (1976).</ref>  Philadelphia became the largest city in the colonies with its central location, excellent port, and a population of about 30,000.<ref>{{Cite book|isbn = 0393016102|title = Philadelphia: A 300 Year History|last1 = Weigley|first1 = Russell Frank|year = 1982|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/philadelphia300y00weig}}</ref>\n\n==18th century==\nIn 1702, East and West Jersey were combined to form the [[Province of New Jersey]].\n\nThe northern and southern sections of the Carolina colony operated more or less independently until 1691, when [[Philip Ludwell]] was appointed governor of the entire province. From that time until 1708, the northern and southern settlements remained under one government. However, during this period, the two halves of the province began increasingly to be known as North Carolina and South Carolina, as the descendants of the colony's proprietors fought over the direction of the colony.<ref>Richter, pp. 319\u201322</ref> The colonists of Charles Town finally deposed their governor and elected their own government. This marked the start of separate governments in the [[Province of North-Carolina]] and the [[Province of South Carolina]]. In 1729, the king formally revoked Carolina's colonial charter and established both North Carolina and South Carolina as crown colonies.<ref>Richter, pp. 323\u201324</ref>\n\n[[File:North America 1748.PNG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The Thirteen Colonies and neighboring polities in 1748]]\nIn the 1730s, [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliamentarian]] [[James Oglethorpe]] proposed that the area south of the Carolinas be colonized with the \"worthy poor\" of England to provide an alternative to the overcrowded debtors' prisons. Oglethorpe and other English philanthropists secured a royal charter as the Trustees of the colony of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on June 9, 1732.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/statech.asp Colonial charters, grants and related documents]</ref> Oglethorpe and his compatriots hoped to establish a utopian colony that banned slavery and recruited only the most worthy settlers, but by 1750 the colony remained sparsely populated. The proprietors gave up their charter in 1752, at which point Georgia became a crown colony.<ref>Richter, pp. 358\u201359</ref>\n\nThe colonial population of Thirteen Colonies grew immensely in the 18th century. According to historian Alan Taylor, the population of the Thirteen Colonies stood at 1.5 million in 1750, which represented four-fifths of the population of [[British North America]].<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 20</ref> More than 90 percent of the colonists lived as farmers, though some seaports also flourished. In 1760, the cities of Philadelphia, New York, and [[Boston]] had a population in excess of 16,000, which was small by European standards.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 23</ref> By 1770, the economic output of the Thirteen Colonies made up forty percent of the [[gross domestic product]] of the British Empire.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 25</ref>\n\nAs the 18th century progressed, colonists began to settle far from the Atlantic coast. Pennsylvania, Virginia, Connecticut, and Maryland all laid claim to the land in the [[Ohio River]] valley. The colonies engaged in a scramble to purchase land from Indian tribes, as the British insisted that claims to land should rest on legitimate purchases.<ref>Richter, pp. 373\u201374</ref> Virginia was particularly intent on western expansion, and most of the elite Virginia families invested in the [[Ohio Company]] to promote the settlement of [[Ohio Country]].<ref>Richter, pp. 376\u201377</ref>\n\n===Global trade and immigration===\nThe British colonies in North America became part of the global British trading network, as the value tripled for exports from British North America to Britain between 1700 and 1754. The colonists were restricted in trading with other European powers, but they found profitable trade partners in the other British colonies, particularly in the Caribbean. The colonists traded foodstuffs, wood, tobacco, and various other resources for Asian tea, West Indian coffee, and West Indian sugar, among other items.<ref>Richter, pp. 329\u201330</ref> American Indians far from the Atlantic coast supplied the Atlantic market with beaver fur and deerskins.<ref>Richter, pp. 332\u201336</ref> British North America had an advantage in natural resources and established its own thriving shipbuilding industry, and many North American merchants engaged in the transatlantic trade.<ref>Richter, pp. 330\u201331</ref>\n\nImproved economic conditions and easing of religious persecution in Europe made it more difficult to recruit labor to the colonies, and many colonies became increasingly reliant on slave labor, particularly in the South. The population of slaves in British North America grew dramatically between 1680 and 1750, and the growth was driven by a mixture of forced immigration and the reproduction of slaves.<ref>Richter, pp. 346\u201347</ref> Slaves supported vast plantation economies in the South, while slaves in the North worked in a variety of occupations.<ref>Richter, pp. 351\u201352</ref> There were some slave revolts, such as the [[Stono Rebellion]] and the [[New York Conspiracy of 1741]], but these uprisings were suppressed.<ref>Richter, pp. 353\u201354</ref>\n\nA small proportion of the English population migrated to British North America after 1700, but the colonies attracted new immigrants from other European countries. These immigrants traveled to all of the colonies, but the Middle Colonies attracted the most and continued to be more ethnically diverse than the other colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 18\u201319</ref> Numerous settlers immigrated from [[Ireland]],<ref>Richter, p. 360</ref> both Catholic and Protestant\u2014particularly \"[[Old and New Light|New Light]]\" [[Ulster]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]].<ref>Richter, p. 361</ref> Protestant Germans also migrated in large numbers, particularly to Pennsylvania.<ref>Richter, p. 362</ref> In the 1740s, the Thirteen Colonies underwent the [[First Great Awakening]].<ref>Middlekauff, pp. 46\u201349</ref>\n\n===French and Indian War===\nIn 1738, an incident involving a Welsh mariner named [[Robert Jenkins (master mariner)|Robert Jenkins]] sparked the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] between Britain and Spain. Hundreds of North Americans volunteered for Admiral [[Edward Vernon]]'s [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias|assault]] on [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartegena de Indias]], a Spanish city in South America.<ref>Richter, p. 345</ref> The war against Spain merged into a broader conflict known as the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], but most colonists called it [[King George's War]].<ref>Richter, pp. 379\u201380</ref> In 1745, British and colonial forces [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|captured]] the town of [[Louisbourg]], and the war came to an end with the 1748 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]]. However, many colonists were angered when Britain returned Louisbourg to France in return for [[Chennai|Madras]] and other territories.<ref>Richter, pp. 380\u201381</ref> In the aftermath of the war, both the British and French sought to expand into the Ohio River valley.<ref>Richter, pp. 383\u201385</ref>\n\nThe [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363) was the American extension of the general European conflict known as the [[Seven Years' War]]. Previous colonial wars in North America had started in Europe and then spread to the colonies, but the French and Indian War is notable for having started in North America and spread to Europe. One of the primary causes of the war was increasing competition between Britain and France, especially in the Great Lakes and Ohio valley.<ref name=\"anderson\">Fred Anderson, ''The War That Made America: A Short History of the French and Indian War'' (2006)</ref>\n\nThe French and Indian War took on a new significance for the British North American colonists when [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] decided that major military resources needed to be devoted to North America in order to win the war against France. For the first time, the continent became one of the main theaters of what could be termed a \"[[world war]]\". During the war, it became increasingly apparent to American colonists that they were under the authority of the British Empire, as British military and civilian officials took on an increased presence in their lives.\n\nThe war also increased a sense of American unity in other ways. It caused men to travel across the continent who might otherwise have never left their own colony, fighting alongside men from decidedly different backgrounds who were nonetheless still American. Throughout the course of the war, British officers trained Americans for battle, most notably [[George Washington]], which benefited the American cause during the Revolution. Also, colonial legislatures and officials had to cooperate intensively in pursuit of the continent-wide military effort.<ref name=\"anderson\"/> The relations were not always positive between the British military establishment and the colonists, setting the stage for later distrust and dislike of British troops. At the 1754 [[Albany Congress]], Pennsylvania colonist [[Benjamin Franklin]] proposed the [[Albany Plan]] which would have created a unified government of the Thirteen Colonies for coordination of defense and other matters, but the plan was rejected by the leaders of most colonies.<ref>Richter, pp. 390\u201391</ref>\n\n[[File:NorthAmerica1762-83.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Territorial changes following the French and Indian War; land held by the British before 1763 is shown in red, land gained by Britain in 1763 is shown in pink]]\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], France formally ceded to Britain the eastern part of its vast North American empire, having secretly given to Spain the territory of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] west of the Mississippi River the previous year. Before the war, Britain held the thirteen American colonies, most of present-day [[Nova Scotia]], and most of the [[Hudson Bay]] watershed. Following the war, Britain gained all French territory east of the Mississippi River, including Quebec, the Great Lakes, and the Ohio River valley. Britain also gained [[Spanish Florida]], from which it formed the colonies of [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]]. In removing a major foreign threat to the thirteen colonies, the war also largely removed the colonists' need of colonial protection.\n\nThe British and colonists triumphed jointly over a common foe. The colonists' loyalty to the mother country was stronger than ever before. However, disunity was beginning to form. [[British Prime Minister]] William Pitt the Elder had decided to wage the war in the colonies with the use of troops from the colonies and tax funds from Britain itself. This was a successful wartime strategy but, after the war was over, each side believed that it had borne a greater burden than the other. The British elite, the most heavily taxed of any in Europe, pointed out angrily that the colonists paid little to the royal coffers. The colonists replied that their sons had fought and died in a war that served European interests more than their own. This dispute was a link in the chain of events that soon brought about the American Revolution.<ref name=\"anderson\"/>\n\n===Growing dissent===\nThe British were left with large debts following the French and Indian War, so British leaders decided to increase taxation and control of the Thirteen Colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 51\u201353</ref> They imposed several new taxes, beginning with the [[Sugar Act]] of 1764. Later acts included the [[Currency Act of 1764]], the [[Stamp Act of 1765]], and the [[Townshend Acts]] of 1767.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 94\u201396, 107</ref>\n\nThe British also sought to maintain peaceful relations with those Indian tribes that had allied with the French by keeping them separated from the American frontiersmen. To this end, the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] restricted settlement west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], as this was designated an [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]].<ref>Colin G. Calloway, ''The Scratch of a Pen: 1763 and the Transformation of North America'' (2006), pp. 92\u201398</ref> Some groups of settlers disregarded the proclamation, however, and continued to move west and establish farms.<ref>W. J. Rorabaugh, Donald T. Critchlow, Paula C. Baker (2004). \"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VL_6X5zWOokC&pg=PA92 America's promise: a concise history of the United States]''\". Rowman & Littlefield. p. 92. {{ISBN|0-7425-1189-8}}</ref> The proclamation was soon modified and was no longer a hindrance to settlement, but the fact angered the colonists that it had been promulgated without their prior consultation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Holton | first1 = Woody | year = 1994 | title = The Ohio Indians and the coming of the American revolution in Virginia | url = | journal = Journal of Southern History | volume = 60 | issue = 3| pages = 453\u201378 | doi = 10.2307/2210989 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Benjamin Franklin - Join or Die.jpg|thumb|alt=''[[Join, or Die]]'' by Benjamin Franklin was recycled to encourage the former colonies to unite against British rule|''[[Join, or Die]]'' by [[Benjamin Franklin]] was recycled to encourage the former colonies to unite against British rule.]]\nParliament had directly levied duties and excise taxes on the colonies, bypassing the colonial legislatures, and Americans began to insist on the principle of \"[[no taxation without representation]]\" with intense protests over the [[Stamp Act of 1765]].<ref>J. R. Pole, [https://www.questia.com/read/89805613 ''Political Representation in England and the Origins of the American Republic''] (London; Melbourne: Macmillan, 1966), 31 [[Questia Online Library]]</ref> They argued that the colonies had no representation in the British Parliament, so it was a violation of their rights as Englishmen for taxes to be imposed upon them. Parliament rejected the colonial protests and asserted its authority by passing new taxes.\n\nColonial discontentment grew with the passage of the 1773 [[Tea Act]], which reduced taxes on tea sold by the [[East India Company]] in an effort to undercut competition, and Prime Minister North's ministry hoped that this would establish a precedent of colonists accepting British taxation policies. Trouble escalated over the tea tax, as Americans in each colony boycotted the tea, and those in Boston dumped the tea in the harbor during the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773 when the [[Sons of Liberty]] dumped thousands of pounds of tea into the water. Tensions escalated in 1774 as Parliament passed the laws known as the [[Intolerable Acts]], which greatly restricted self-government in the colony of Massachusetts. These laws also allowed British military commanders to claim colonial homes for the quartering of soldiers, regardless whether the American civilians were willing or not to have soldiers in their homes. The laws further revoked colonial rights to hold trials in cases involving soldiers or crown officials, forcing such trials to be held in England rather than in America. Parliament also sent [[Thomas Gage]] to serve as Governor of Massachusetts and as the commander of British forces in North America.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 112\u201314</ref>\n\nBy 1774, colonists still hoped to remain part of the British Empire, but discontentment was widespread concerning British rule throughout the Thirteen Colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 137\u201321</ref> Colonists elected delegates to the [[First Continental Congress]] which convened in [[Philadelphia]] in September 1774. In the aftermath of the Intolerable Acts, the delegates asserted that the colonies owed allegiance only to the king; they would accept royal governors as agents of the king, but they were no longer willing to recognize Parliament's right to pass legislation affecting the colonies. Most delegates opposed an attack on the British position in Boston, and the Continental Congress instead agreed to the imposition of a boycott known as the [[Continental Association]]. The boycott proved effective and the value of British imports dropped dramatically.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 123\u201327</ref> The Thirteen Colonies became increasingly divided between [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] opposed to British rule and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] who supported it.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 137\u201338</ref>\n\n==American Revolution==\n{{main|American Revolution}}\n[[File:British colonies 1763-76 shepherd1923.PNG|thumb|upright=1.50|Map of the Thirteen Colonies (red) and nearby colonial areas (1763\u20131775) just before the Revolutionary War]]\n\nIn response, the colonies formed bodies of elected representatives known as [[Provincial Congress]]es, and Colonists began to boycott imported British merchandise.<ref>T.H. Breen, ''American Insurgents, American Patriots: The Revolution of the People'' (2010) pp. 81\u201382</ref> Later in 1774, 12 colonies sent representatives to the [[First Continental Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]]. During the [[Second Continental Congress]], the remaining colony of Georgia sent delegates, as well.\n\nMassachusetts Governor [[Thomas Gage]] feared a confrontation with the colonists; he requested reinforcements from Britain, but the British government was not willing to pay for the expense of stationing tens of thousands of soldiers in the Thirteen Colonies. Gage was instead ordered to seize Patriot arsenals. He dispatched a force to march on the arsenal at [[Concord, Massachusetts]], but the Patriots learned about it and blocked their advance. The Patriots repulsed the British force at the April 1775 [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], then lay [[Siege of Boston|siege to Boston]].<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 132\u201333</ref>\n\nBy spring 1775, all royal officials had been expelled, and the [[Continental Congress]] hosted a convention of delegates for the 13 colonies. It raised an army to fight the British and named George Washington its commander, made treaties, declared independence, and recommended that the colonies write constitutions and become states.<ref>[[Robert Middlekauff]], ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763\u20131789'' (Oxford History of the United States) (2007)</ref> The [[Second Continental Congress]] assembled in May 1775 and began to coordinate armed resistance against Britain. It established a government that recruited soldiers and printed its own money. General Washington took command of the Patriot soldiers in New England and forced the British to withdraw from Boston. In 1776, the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence from Britain. With the help of France and Spain, they defeated the British in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. In the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], Britain officially recognized the independence of the United States of America.\n\n==Thirteen British colonies population==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; float:right; clear:right; margin-left:8px; margin-right:0;\"\n|+ Population of the thirteen British colonies<ref>Note: the population figures are estimates by historians; they do not include the Indian tribes outside the jurisdiction of the colonies.

The great majority went to sugar colonies in the Caribbean and to Brazil, where life expectancy was short and the numbers had to be continually replenished. By the mid-18th century, life expectancy was much higher in the American colonies.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Finkelman|title=Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619\u20131895|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cCMbE4KKlX4C&pg=RA1-PA156|year=2006|publisher=Oxford UP|pages=2:156|isbn=9780195167771}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Slaves imported into Colonial America<ref>Source: Miller and Smith, eds.

From 1770 until 1860, the rate of natural growth of North American slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in Europe, and was nearly twice as rapid as that in England.\n\n==Religion==\nProtestantism was the predominant religious affiliation in the Thirteen Colonies, although there were also Catholics, Jews, and [[deists]], and a large fraction had no religious connection. The [[Church of England]] was officially established in most of the South. The [[Puritan movement]] became the [[Congregational church]], and it was the established religious affiliation in Massachusetts and Connecticut into the 18th century.<ref>Stephen Foster, ''The Long Argument: English Puritanism and the Shaping of New England Culture, 1570\u20131700;'' (1996).</ref> In practice, this meant that tax revenues were allocated to church expenses. The [[Anglican]] parishes in the South were under the control of local vestries and had public functions such as repair of the roads and relief of the poor.<ref>Patricia U. Bonomi, ''Under the cope of heaven: Religion, society, and politics in Colonial America'' (2003).</ref>\n\nThe colonies were religiously diverse, with different Protestant denominations brought by British, German, Dutch, and other immigrants. The [[Reformed tradition]] was the foundation for [[Presbyterian]], [[Congregationalist]], and [[Continental Reformed]] denominations. French [[Huguenots]] set up their own Reformed congregations. The [[Dutch Reformed Church]] was strong among [[Dutch Americans]] in New York and New Jersey, while [[Lutheranism]] was prevalent among [[German American|German immigrants]]. Germans also brought diverse forms of [[Anabaptism]], especially the [[Mennonite]] variety. [[Reformed Baptist]] preacher [[Roger Williams]] founded [[Providence Plantations]] which became the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]]. Jews were clustered in a few port cities. The Baltimore family founded [[Maryland]] and brought in fellow Catholics from England.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 44209361|title = Catholicism in Colonial Maryland|journal = Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia|volume = 51|issue = 1|pages = 65\u201383|last1 = Rita|first1 = M.|year = 1940}}</ref> Catholics were estimated at 1.6% of the population or 40,000 in 1775. Of the 200\u2013250,000 Irish who came to the Colonies between 1701 and 1775 less than 20,000 were Catholic, many of whom hid their faith or lapsed because of prejudice and discrimination. Between 1770\u20131775 3,900 Irish Catholics arrived out of almost 45,000 white immigrants (7,000 English, 15,000 Scots, 13,200 Scots-Irish, 5,200 Germans) <ref>Jon Butler, Becoming America, The Revolution before 1776, 2000, p. 35, {{ISBN|0-674-00091-9}}</ref>. Most Catholics were English Recusants, Germans, Irish and blacks who lived in Maryland where half the Catholic population lived, New York and Pennsylvania.

Stevens, ''The poor Indians: British missionaries, Native Americans, and colonial sensibility'' (2010).</ref>\n\n===Education===\nHigher education was available for young men in the north, and most students were aspiring Protestant ministers. The oldest colleges were [[Harvard College|New College (Harvard)]], [[Princeton College|College of New Jersey (Princeton)]], [[Yale College|Collegiate School (Yale)]], [[Columbia University|King's College (Columbia)]], and the [[Brown University|College of Rhode Island (Brown)]]. Other colleges were [[University of Pennsylvania|College of Philadelphia (University of Pennsylvania)]], [[Rutgers College|Queen's College (Rutgers)]] and [[Dartmouth College]] in New Hampshire. South of Philadelphia, there was only the [[College of William and Mary]] which trained the secular elite in Virginia, especially aspiring lawyers.\n\nThe southern colonies held the belief that the family had the responsibility of educating their children, mirroring the common belief in Europe. Wealthy families either used tutors and governesses from Britain or sent children to school in England. By the 1700s, university students based in the colonies began to act as tutors.<ref>Urban, Wayne J. and Jennings L. Wagoner, Jr. ''American Education: A History''.

Girls were educated at home or by small local private schools, and they had no access to college. Aspiring physicians and lawyers typically learned as apprentices to an established practitioner, although some young men went to medical schools in Scotland.<ref>Wayne J. Urban and Jennings L. Wagoner Jr., ''American Education: A History'' (5th ed. 2013) pp 11\u201354.</ref>\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies}}\n\nThe three forms of colonial government in 1776 were provincial ([[royal colony]]), [[Proprietary colony|proprietary]], and [[Charter colony|charter]]. These governments were all subordinate to the British monarch with no representation in the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]. The administration of all British colonies was overseen by the [[Board of Trade]] in London beginning late in the 17th century.\n\nThe provincial colony was governed by commissions created at pleasure of the king. A governor and his council were appointed by the crown. The governor was invested with general executive powers and authorized to call a locally elected assembly. The governor's council would sit as an upper house when the assembly was in session, in addition to its role in advising the governor. Assemblies were made up of representatives elected by the freeholders and planters (landowners) of the province. The governor had the power of absolute veto and could [[Legislative session|prorogue]] (i.e., delay) and dissolve the assembly. The assembly's role was to make all local laws and ordinances, ensuring that they were not inconsistent with the laws of Britain. In practice, this did not always occur, since many of the provincial assemblies sought to expand their powers and limit those of the governor and crown. Laws could be examined by the British Privy Council or Board of Trade, which also held veto power of legislation. New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia were crown colonies. Massachusetts became a crown colony at the end of the 17th century.\n\nProprietary colonies were governed much as royal colonies, except that lord proprietors appointed the governor rather than the king. They were set up after the [[English Restoration]] of 1660 and typically enjoyed greater civil and religious liberty. Pennsylvania (which included Delaware), New Jersey, and Maryland were proprietary colonies.<ref>John Andrew Doyle, ''English Colonies in America: Volume IV The Middle Colonies'' (1907) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4wYOAAAAIAAJ  online]</ref>\n\nCharter governments were political corporations created by [[letters patent]], giving the grantees control of the land and the powers of legislative government. The charters provided a fundamental constitution and divided powers among legislative, executive, and judicial functions, with those powers being vested in officials. Massachusetts, Providence Plantation, Rhode Island, Warwick, and Connecticut were charter colonies. The Massachusetts charter was revoked in 1684 and was replaced by a provincial charter that was issued in 1691.<ref>Louise Phelps Kellogg, ''The American colonial charter'' (1904) [https://archive.org/details/americancolonia00kellgoog  online]</ref> [[Providence Plantations]] merged with the settlements at [[Aquidneck Island|Rhode Island]] and [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]] to form the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], which also became a charter colony in 1636.\n\n===British role===\nAfter 1680, the imperial government in London took an increasing interest in the affairs of the colonies, which were growing rapidly in population and wealth. In 1680, only Virginia was a royal colony; by 1720, half were under the control of royal governors. These governors were appointees closely tied to the government in London.\n\nHistorians before the 1880s emphasized American nationalism. However, scholarship after that time was heavily influenced by the \"Imperial school\" led by [[Herbert L. Osgood]], [[George Louis Beer]], [[Charles McLean Andrews]], and [[Lawrence H. Gipson]]. This viewpoint dominated colonial historiography into the 1940s, and they emphasized and often praised the attention that London gave to all the colonies. In this view, there was never a threat (before the 1770s) that any colony would revolt or seek independence.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=27787750|url=http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/7801/9315|title=The Imperial School of American Colonial Historians|journal=Indiana Magazine of History|volume=45|issue=2|pages=123\u2013134|last1=Savelle|first1=Max|year=1949}}</ref>\n\n===Self-government===\nBritish settlers did not come to the American colonies with the intention of creating a democratic system; yet they quickly created a broad electorate without a land-owning aristocracy, along with a pattern of free elections which put a strong emphasis on voter participation. The colonies offered a much freer degree of [[suffrage]] than Britain or indeed any other country. Any property owner could vote for members of the lower house of the legislature, and they could even vote for the governor in Connecticut and Rhode Island.<ref name=\"Robert\">Robert J. Dinkin, ''Voting in Provincial America: A Study of Elections in the Thirteen Colonies, 1689\u20131776'' (1977)</ref> Voters were required to hold an \"interest\" in society; as the South Carolina legislature said in 1716, \"it is necessary and reasonable, that none but such persons will have an interest in the Province should be capable to elect members of the Commons House of Assembly\".<ref>Thomas Cooper and David James McCord, eds. ''The Statutes at Large of South Carolina: Acts, 1685\u20131716'' (1837) p. 688</ref> The main legal criterion for having an \"interest\" was ownership of real estate property, which was uncommon in Britain, where 19 out of 20 men were controlled politically by their landlords. (Women, children, indentured servants, and slaves were subsumed under the interest of the family head.) London insisted on this requirement for the colonies, telling governors to exclude from the ballot men who were not freeholders\u2014that is, those who did not own land. Nevertheless, land was so widely owned that 50% to 80% of the men were eligible to vote.<ref>Alexander Keyssar, ''The Right to Vote'' (2000) pp. 5\u20138</ref>\n\nThe colonial political culture emphasized deference, so that local notables were the men who ran and were chosen. But sometimes they competed with each other and had to appeal to the common man for votes. There were no political parties, and would-be legislators formed ad-hoc coalitions of their families, friends, and neighbors. Outside of Puritan New England, election day brought in all the men from the countryside to the county seat to make merry, politick, shake hands with the grandees, meet old friends, and hear the speeches\u2014all the while toasting, eating, treating, tippling, and gambling. They voted by shouting their choice to the clerk, as supporters cheered or booed. Candidate [[George Washington]] spent \u00a339 for treats for his supporters. The candidates knew that they had to \"swill the planters with bumbo\" (rum). Elections were carnivals where all men were equal for one day and traditional restraints were relaxed.<ref>Daniel Vickers, ''A Companion to Colonial America'' (2006) p. 300</ref>\n\nThe actual rate of voting ranged from 20% to 40% of all adult white males. The rates were higher in Pennsylvania and New York, where long-standing factions based on ethnic and religious groups mobilized supporters at a higher rate. New York and Rhode Island developed long-lasting two-faction systems that held together for years at the colony level, but they did not reach into local affairs. The factions were based on the personalities of a few leaders and an array of family connections, and they had little basis in policy or ideology. Elsewhere the political scene was in a constant whirl, based on personality rather than long-lived factions or serious disputes on issues.<ref name=\"Robert\" />\n\nThe colonies were independent of one other long before 1774; indeed, all the colonies began as separate and unique settlements or plantations. Further, efforts had failed to form a colonial union through the [[Albany Congress]] of 1754 led by [[Benjamin Franklin]]. The thirteen all had well-established systems of self-government and elections based on the [[Rights of Englishmen]] which they were determined to protect from imperial interference.<ref>Greene and Pole, eds. (2004), p. 665</ref>\n\n===Economic policy===\nThe British Empire at the time operated under the [[Mercantilism|mercantile system]], where all trade was concentrated inside the Empire, and trade with other empires was forbidden. The goal was to enrich Britain\u2014its merchants and its government. Whether the policy was good for the colonists was not an issue in London, but Americans became increasingly restive with mercantilist policies.<ref>Max Savelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA204 ''Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind'' (2005) pp. 204\u201311]</ref>\n\nMercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants\u2014and kept others out\u2014by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling\u2014which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch.<ref>George Otto Trevelyan, ''The American revolution: Volume 1'' [https://archive.org/details/americanrevolut14trevgoog/page/n13 <!-- pg=128 quote=smuggling american revolution. --> (1899) p. 128 online]</ref> The tactic used by mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb [[History of the Royal Navy#Expansion of the fighting force, 1642\u20131689|Royal Navy]], which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy captured [[New Amsterdam]] (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.<ref>William R. Nester, ''The Great Frontier War: Britain, France, and the Imperial Struggle for North America, 1607\u20131755'' (Praeger, 2000) p, 54.</ref>\n\nBritain implemented mercantilism by trying to block American trade with the French, Spanish, or Dutch empires using the [[Navigation Acts]], which Americans avoided as often as they could. The royal officials responded to smuggling with open-ended search warrants ([[Writ of assistance|Writs of Assistance]]). In 1761, Boston lawyer [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] argued that the writs violated the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutional rights]] of the colonists. He lost the case, but John Adams later wrote, \"Then and there the child Independence was born.\"<ref name=Stephens2006>Stephens, ''Unreasonable Searches and Seizures'' (2006) p. 306</ref>\n\nHowever, the colonists took pains to argue that they did not oppose British regulation of their external trade; they only opposed legislation which affected them internally.\n\n==Other British colonies==\n{{main|British America}}\n[[File:British Colonies in North America c1750 v2.png|thumb|right|British colonies in North America, {{Circa|1750}}{{ordered list|[[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]|Nova Scotia|Thirteen Colonies|Bermuda|[[Bahamas]]|[[British Honduras]]|[[Jamaica]]|[[British Leeward Islands]] and [[Barbados]]}}]]\n\nBesides these thirteen colonies, Britain had another dozen in the [[British America|New World]]. Those in the [[British West Indies]], [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]], the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Bermuda]], and [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]] remained loyal to the crown throughout the war (although Spain reacquired Florida before the war was over, and later  sold it to the United States). There was a certain degree of sympathy with the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] cause in several of the other colonies, but their geographical isolation and the dominance of British naval power precluded any effective participation.<ref>Jack P. Greene and J. R. Pole, eds. '\"A Companion to the American Revolution'' (2004) ch. 63</ref> The British crown had only recently acquired those lands, and many of the issues facing the Thirteen Colonies did not apply to them, especially in the case of Quebec and Florida.<ref>Lawrence Gipson, ''The British Empire Before the American Revolution'' (15 volumes, 1936\u20131970), highly detailed discussion of every British colony in the New World in the 1750s and 1760s</ref>\n\nNewfoundland was exempt from the Navigation Acts and shared none of the grievances of the continental colonies. It was tightly bound to Britain and controlled by the Royal Navy and had no assembly that could voice grievances.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nNova Scotia had a large [[Yankee]] element that had recently arrived from New England, and shared the sentiments of the Americans about demanding the rights of the British men. The royal government in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] reluctantly allowed the Yankees of Nova Scotia a kind of \"neutrality\". In any case, the island-like geography and the presence of the major British naval base at Halifax made the thought of armed resistance impossible.<ref>Meinig pp. 313\u201314; Greene and Pole (2004) ch. 61</ref>\n\nQuebec was inhabited by French Catholic settlers who came under British control in the previous decade. The [[Quebec Act of 1774]] gave them formal cultural autonomy within the empire, and many priests feared the intense Protestantism in New England. The American grievances over taxation had little relevance, and there was no assembly nor elections of any kind that could have mobilized any grievances. Even so, the Americans offered membership in the new nation and sent a military expedition that failed to [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|capture Canada]] in 1775. Most Canadians remained neutral but some joined the American cause.<ref>Meinig pp 314\u201315; Greene and Pole (2004) ch 61</ref>\n\nIn the West Indies the elected assemblies of Jamaica, [[Grenada]], and Barbados formally declared their sympathies for the American cause and called for mediation, but the others were quite loyal. Britain carefully avoided antagonizing the rich owners of sugar plantations (many of whom lived in London); in turn the planters' greater dependence on slavery made them recognize the need for British military protection from possible slave revolts. The possibilities for overt action were sharply limited by the overwhelming power of Royal Navy in the islands. During the war there was some opportunistic trading with American ships.<ref>Andrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy, ''An Empire Divided: The American Revolution and the British Caribbean'' (2000) ch 6</ref>\n\nIn Bermuda and the Bahamas local leaders were angry at the food shortages caused by British blockade of American ports. There was increasing sympathy for the American cause, including smuggling, and both colonies were considered \"passive allies\" of the United States throughout the war. When an American naval squadron arrived in the Bahamas to seize gunpowder, the colony gave no resistance at all.<ref>Meinig pp. 315\u201316; Greene and Pole (2004) ch. 63</ref>\n\nEast Florida and West Florida were territories transferred from Spain to Britain after the French and Indian War by treaty. The few British colonists there needed protection from attacks by Indians and Spanish privateers. After 1775, East Florida became a major base for the British war effort in the South, especially in the invasions of Georgia and South Carolina.<ref>Meinig p. 316</ref> However, Spain seized Pensacola in West Florida in 1781, then recovered both territories in the [[Peace of Paris (1783)#Treaty with Spain|Treaty of Paris]] that ended the war in 1783. Spain ultimately transferred the Florida provinces to the United States in 1819.<ref>P. J. Marshall, ed.

The Thirteen Colonies had very similar political, constitutional, and legal systems, and were dominated by Protestant English-speakers. The northern colonies were founded primarily for religious reasons, while the southern colonies were founded for financial profit and business expansion. All thirteen were part of [[British America|Britain's possessions]] in the New World, which also included colonies in Canada, Florida, and the Caribbean.\n\nThe colonial population grew from about 2,000 to 2.4 million between 1625 and 1775, sometimes displacing American Indians. This population included people subject to a system of [[Slavery in the colonial United States|slavery]] which was legal in all of the colonies prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref name=\"Rodriguez2007\">{{cite book|author=Junius P.

The [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363) against France and its Indian allies led to growing tensions between Britain and the Thirteen Colonies. During the 1750s, the colonies began collaborating with one another instead of dealing directly with Britain. These inter-colonial activities cultivated a sense of shared American identity and led to calls for protection of the colonists' \"[[Rights of Englishmen|Rights as Englishmen]]\", especially the principle of \"[[no taxation without representation]]\". Grievances with the British government led to the [[American Revolution]], in which the colonies worked together to form the [[Continental Congress]]. The colonists fought the American Revolutionary War (1775\u201383) with the aid of the [[Kingdom of France]] and, to a much smaller degree, the [[Dutch Republic]] and the [[Enlightenment in Spain|Kingdom of Spain]].<ref>Richard Middleton and Anne Lombard, ''Colonial America: A History to 1763'' (4th ed. 2011)</ref>\n\n== British colonies ==\nIn 1606, King [[James VI and I|James I of England]] granted charters to both the [[Plymouth Company]] and the [[London Company]] for the purpose of establishing permanent settlements in America. The London Company established the [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia]] in 1607, the first permanently settled English colony on the continent. The Plymouth Company founded the [[Popham Colony]] on the [[Kennebec River]], but it was short-lived. The [[Plymouth Council for New England]] sponsored several colonization projects, culminating with [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620 which was settled by English Puritan separatists, known today as the [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]].<ref>Richter, pp. 152\u201353</ref> The Dutch, Swedish, and French also established successful American colonies at roughly the same time as the English, but they eventually came under the English crown. The Thirteen Colonies were complete with the establishment of the [[Province of Georgia]] in 1732, although the term \"Thirteen Colonies\" became current only in the context of the [[American Revolution]].<ref>The number 13 is mentioned as early as 1720 by [[Abel Boyer]], ''The Political State of Great Britain'' vol. 19, [https://books.google.com/books?id=M31YAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA376 p. 376]: \"so in this Country we have Thirteen Colonies at least severally govern'd by their respective Commanders in Chief, according to their peculiar Laws and Constitutions.\" This includes Carolina as a single colony and does not include Georgia, but instead counts Nova Scotia and [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]] as British colonies.

It was a private venture, financed by a group of English [[Lords Proprietors]] who obtained a [[Royal Charter]] to the Carolinas in 1663, hoping that a new colony in the south would become profitable like Jamestown. Carolina was not settled until 1670, and even then the first attempt failed because there was no incentive for emigration to that area. Eventually, however, the Lords combined their remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area led by Sir [[John Colleton]]. The expedition located fertile and defensible ground at what became [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], originally Charles Town for [[Charles II of England]].<ref>Robert M. Weir, ''Colonial South Carolina: A History'' (1983).</ref>\n\n===New England===\nThe [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]] were a small group of Puritan separatists who felt that they needed to distance themselves physically from the Church of England, which they perceived as corrupted. They initially moved to the Netherlands, but eventually sailed to America in 1620 on the ''[[Mayflower]]''. Upon their arrival, they drew up the [[Mayflower Compact]], by which they bound themselves together as a united community, thus establishing the small [[Plymouth Colony]]. [[William Bradford (1590-1657)|William Bradford]] was their main leader. After its founding, other settlers traveled from England to join the colony.<ref>Nathaniel Philbrick, ''Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War Paperback'' (2007).</ref>\n\nMore Puritans immigrated in 1629 and established the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] with 400 settlers. They sought to reform the [[Church of England]] by creating a new, ideologically pure church in the New World. By 1640, [[Migration to New England (1620\u20131640)|20,000 had arrived]]; many died soon after arrival, but the others found a healthy climate and an ample food supply. The Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies together spawned other Puritan colonies in New England, including the [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]], [[Saybrook Colony|Saybrook]], and [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] colonies. During the 17th century, the New Haven and Saybrook colonies were absorbed by Connecticut.<ref>Francis J. Bremer, ''The Puritan Experiment: New England Society from Bradford to Edwards'' (1995).</ref>\n\n[[Roger Williams]] established [[Providence Plantations]] in 1636 on land provided by [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] sachem [[Canonicus]]. Williams was a Puritan who preached religious tolerance, [[separation of Church and State]], and a complete break with the Church of England. He was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony over theological disagreements; he founded the settlement based on an egalitarian constitution, providing for majority rule \"in civil things\" and \"liberty of conscience\" in religious matters.<ref name=\"taylor\"/><ref>Benjamin Woods Labaree, ''Colonial Massachusetts: a history'' (1979)</ref> In 1637, a second group including [[Anne Hutchinson]] established a second settlement on [[Aquidneck Island]], also known as Rhode Island.\n\nOther colonists settled to the north, mingling with adventurers and profit-oriented settlers to establish more religiously diverse colonies in [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] and [[Province of Maine|Maine]]. Massachusetts absorbed these small settlements when it made significant land claims in the 1640s and 1650s, but New Hampshire was eventually given a separate charter in 1679. Maine remained a part of Massachusetts until achieving statehood in 1820.\n\nIn 1685, King [[James II of England]] closed the legislatures and consolidated the New England colonies into the [[Dominion of New England]], putting the region under control of Governor [[Edmund Andros]]. In 1688, the colonies of New York, West Jersey, and East Jersey were added to the dominion.

(Present U.S. states in gray.) The English colonies of New York (NY), New Jersey (NJ), Pennsylvania (PA) and Delaware (DE) are referred to as the 'middle colonies'.]]\n\nBeginning in 1609, Dutch traders explored and established fur trading posts on the [[Hudson River]], [[Delaware River]], and [[Connecticut River]], seeking to protect their interests in the fur trade. The [[Dutch West India Company]] established permanent settlements on the Hudson River, creating the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]]. In 1626, [[Peter Minuit]] purchased the island of [[Manhattan]] from the [[Lenape]] Indians and established the outpost of [[New Amsterdam]].<ref>Richter, pp. 138\u201340</ref> Relatively few Dutch settled in New Netherland, but the colony came to dominate the regional fur trade.<ref>Richter, pp. 159\u2013\n60</ref> It also served as the base for extensive trade with the English colonies, and many products from New England and Virginia were carried to Europe on Dutch ships.<ref>Richter pp. 212\u201313</ref> The Dutch also engaged in the burgeoning [[Atlantic slave trade]], supplying enslaved Africans to the English colonies in North America and [[Barbados]].<ref>Richter pp. 214\u201315</ref> The West India Company desired to grow New Netherland as it became commercially successful, yet the colony failed to attract the same level of settlement as the English colonies did. Many of those who did immigrate to the colony were English, [[German people|German]], [[Walloons|Walloon]], or [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]].<ref>Richter pp. 215\u201317</ref>\n\nIn 1638, Sweden established the colony of [[New Sweden]] in the [[Delaware Valley]]. The operation was led by former members of the Dutch West India Company, including Peter Minuit.<ref>Richter, p. 150</ref> New Sweden established extensive trading contacts with English colonies to the south, and shipped much of the tobacco produced in Virginia.<ref>Richter p. 213</ref> The colony was conquered by the Dutch in 1655,<ref>Richter, p. 262</ref> while Sweden was engaged in the [[Second Northern War]].\n\nBeginning in the 1650s, the English and Dutch engaged in a [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|series of wars]], and the English sought to conquer New Netherland.<ref>Richter pp. 247\u201348</ref> [[Richard Nicolls]] captured the lightly defended New Amsterdam in 1664, and his subordinates quickly captured the remainder of New Netherland.<ref>Richter, pp. 248\u201349</ref> The 1667 [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] ended the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] and confirmed English control of the region.<ref>Richter, p. 249</ref> The Dutch briefly regained control of parts of New Netherland in the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]], but surrendered claim to the territory in the 1674 [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]], ending the Dutch colonial presence in North America.<ref>Richter p. 261</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], the British renamed the colony \"York City\" or \"New York\". Large numbers of Dutch remained in the colony, dominating the rural areas between New York City and Albany, while people from New England started moving in as well as immigrants from Germany. New York City attracted a large polyglot population, including a large black slave population.<ref>Michael G. Kammen, ''Colonial New York: A History'' (1974).</ref> In 1674, the proprietary colonies of [[East Jersey]] and [[West Jersey]] were created from lands formerly part of New York.<ref>John E.

The main population elements included the Quaker population based in Philadelphia, a Scotch-Irish population on the Western frontier, and numerous German colonies in between.<ref>Joseph E.

From that time until 1708, the northern and southern settlements remained under one government. However, during this period, the two halves of the province began increasingly to be known as North Carolina and South Carolina, as the descendants of the colony's proprietors fought over the direction of the colony.<ref>Richter, pp. 319\u201322</ref> The colonists of Charles Town finally deposed their governor and elected their own government. This marked the start of separate governments in the [[Province of North-Carolina]] and the [[Province of South Carolina]]. In 1729, the king formally revoked Carolina's colonial charter and established both North Carolina and South Carolina as crown colonies.<ref>Richter, pp. 323\u201324</ref>\n\n[[File:North America 1748.PNG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The Thirteen Colonies and neighboring polities in 1748]]\nIn the 1730s, [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliamentarian]] [[James Oglethorpe]] proposed that the area south of the Carolinas be colonized with the \"worthy poor\" of England to provide an alternative to the overcrowded debtors' prisons. Oglethorpe and other English philanthropists secured a royal charter as the Trustees of the colony of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on June 9, 1732.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/statech.asp Colonial charters, grants and related documents]</ref> Oglethorpe and his compatriots hoped to establish a utopian colony that banned slavery and recruited only the most worthy settlers, but by 1750 the colony remained sparsely populated. The proprietors gave up their charter in 1752, at which point Georgia became a crown colony.<ref>Richter, pp. 358\u201359</ref>\n\nThe colonial population of Thirteen Colonies grew immensely in the 18th century. According to historian Alan Taylor, the population of the Thirteen Colonies stood at 1.5 million in 1750, which represented four-fifths of the population of [[British North America]].<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 20</ref> More than 90 percent of the colonists lived as farmers, though some seaports also flourished. In 1760, the cities of Philadelphia, New York, and [[Boston]] had a population in excess of 16,000, which was small by European standards.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 23</ref> By 1770, the economic output of the Thirteen Colonies made up forty percent of the [[gross domestic product]] of the British Empire.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 25</ref>\n\nAs the 18th century progressed, colonists began to settle far from the Atlantic coast. Pennsylvania, Virginia, Connecticut, and Maryland all laid claim to the land in the [[Ohio River]] valley. The colonies engaged in a scramble to purchase land from Indian tribes, as the British insisted that claims to land should rest on legitimate purchases.<ref>Richter, pp. 373\u201374</ref> Virginia was particularly intent on western expansion, and most of the elite Virginia families invested in the [[Ohio Company]] to promote the settlement of [[Ohio Country]].<ref>Richter, pp. 376\u201377</ref>\n\n===Global trade and immigration===\nThe British colonies in North America became part of the global British trading network, as the value tripled for exports from British North America to Britain between 1700 and 1754. The colonists were restricted in trading with other European powers, but they found profitable trade partners in the other British colonies, particularly in the Caribbean. The colonists traded foodstuffs, wood, tobacco, and various other resources for Asian tea, West Indian coffee, and West Indian sugar, among other items.<ref>Richter, pp. 329\u201330</ref> American Indians far from the Atlantic coast supplied the Atlantic market with beaver fur and deerskins.<ref>Richter, pp. 332\u201336</ref> British North America had an advantage in natural resources and established its own thriving shipbuilding industry, and many North American merchants engaged in the transatlantic trade.<ref>Richter, pp. 330\u201331</ref>\n\nImproved economic conditions and easing of religious persecution in Europe made it more difficult to recruit labor to the colonies, and many colonies became increasingly reliant on slave labor, particularly in the South. The population of slaves in British North America grew dramatically between 1680 and 1750, and the growth was driven by a mixture of forced immigration and the reproduction of slaves.<ref>Richter, pp. 346\u201347</ref> Slaves supported vast plantation economies in the South, while slaves in the North worked in a variety of occupations.<ref>Richter, pp. 351\u201352</ref> There were some slave revolts, such as the [[Stono Rebellion]] and the [[New York Conspiracy of 1741]], but these uprisings were suppressed.<ref>Richter, pp. 353\u201354</ref>\n\nA small proportion of the English population migrated to British North America after 1700, but the colonies attracted new immigrants from other European countries. These immigrants traveled to all of the colonies, but the Middle Colonies attracted the most and continued to be more ethnically diverse than the other colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 18\u201319</ref> Numerous settlers immigrated from [[Ireland]],<ref>Richter, p. 360</ref> both Catholic and Protestant\u2014particularly \"[[Old and New Light|New Light]]\" [[Ulster]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]].<ref>Richter, p. 361</ref> Protestant Germans also migrated in large numbers, particularly to Pennsylvania.<ref>Richter, p. 362</ref> In the 1740s, the Thirteen Colonies underwent the [[First Great Awakening]].<ref>Middlekauff, pp. 46\u201349</ref>\n\n===French and Indian War===\nIn 1738, an incident involving a Welsh mariner named [[Robert Jenkins (master mariner)|Robert Jenkins]] sparked the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] between Britain and Spain. Hundreds of North Americans volunteered for Admiral [[Edward Vernon]]'s [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias|assault]] on [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartegena de Indias]], a Spanish city in South America.<ref>Richter, p. 345</ref> The war against Spain merged into a broader conflict known as the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], but most colonists called it [[King George's War]].<ref>Richter, pp. 379\u201380</ref> In 1745, British and colonial forces [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|captured]] the town of [[Louisbourg]], and the war came to an end with the 1748 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]]. However, many colonists were angered when Britain returned Louisbourg to France in return for [[Chennai|Madras]] and other territories.<ref>Richter, pp. 380\u201381</ref> In the aftermath of the war, both the British and French sought to expand into the Ohio River valley.<ref>Richter, pp. 383\u201385</ref>\n\nThe [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363) was the American extension of the general European conflict known as the [[Seven Years' War]]. Previous colonial wars in North America had started in Europe and then spread to the colonies, but the French and Indian War is notable for having started in North America and spread to Europe. One of the primary causes of the war was increasing competition between Britain and France, especially in the Great Lakes and Ohio valley.<ref name=\"anderson\">Fred Anderson, ''The War That Made America: A Short History of the French and Indian War'' (2006)</ref>\n\nThe French and Indian War took on a new significance for the British North American colonists when [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] decided that major military resources needed to be devoted to North America in order to win the war against France. For the first time, the continent became one of the main theaters of what could be termed a \"[[world war]]\". During the war, it became increasingly apparent to American colonists that they were under the authority of the British Empire, as British military and civilian officials took on an increased presence in their lives.\n\nThe war also increased a sense of American unity in other ways. It caused men to travel across the continent who might otherwise have never left their own colony, fighting alongside men from decidedly different backgrounds who were nonetheless still American. Throughout the course of the war, British officers trained Americans for battle, most notably [[George Washington]], which benefited the American cause during the Revolution. Also, colonial legislatures and officials had to cooperate intensively in pursuit of the continent-wide military effort.<ref name=\"anderson\"/> The relations were not always positive between the British military establishment and the colonists, setting the stage for later distrust and dislike of British troops. At the 1754 [[Albany Congress]], Pennsylvania colonist [[Benjamin Franklin]] proposed the [[Albany Plan]] which would have created a unified government of the Thirteen Colonies for coordination of defense and other matters, but the plan was rejected by the leaders of most colonies.<ref>Richter, pp. 390\u201391</ref>\n\n[[File:NorthAmerica1762-83.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Territorial changes following the French and Indian War; land held by the British before 1763 is shown in red, land gained by Britain in 1763 is shown in pink]]\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], France formally ceded to Britain the eastern part of its vast North American empire, having secretly given to Spain the territory of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] west of the Mississippi River the previous year. Before the war, Britain held the thirteen American colonies, most of present-day [[Nova Scotia]], and most of the [[Hudson Bay]] watershed. Following the war, Britain gained all French territory east of the Mississippi River, including Quebec, the Great Lakes, and the Ohio River valley. Britain also gained [[Spanish Florida]], from which it formed the colonies of [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]]. In removing a major foreign threat to the thirteen colonies, the war also largely removed the colonists' need of colonial protection.\n\nThe British and colonists triumphed jointly over a common foe. The colonists' loyalty to the mother country was stronger than ever before. However, disunity was beginning to form. [[British Prime Minister]] William Pitt the Elder had decided to wage the war in the colonies with the use of troops from the colonies and tax funds from Britain itself. This was a successful wartime strategy but, after the war was over, each side believed that it had borne a greater burden than the other. The British elite, the most heavily taxed of any in Europe, pointed out angrily that the colonists paid little to the royal coffers. The colonists replied that their sons had fought and died in a war that served European interests more than their own. This dispute was a link in the chain of events that soon brought about the American Revolution.<ref name=\"anderson\"/>\n\n===Growing dissent===\nThe British were left with large debts following the French and Indian War, so British leaders decided to increase taxation and control of the Thirteen Colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 51\u201353</ref> They imposed several new taxes, beginning with the [[Sugar Act]] of 1764. Later acts included the [[Currency Act of 1764]], the [[Stamp Act of 1765]], and the [[Townshend Acts]] of 1767.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 94\u201396, 107</ref>\n\nThe British also sought to maintain peaceful relations with those Indian tribes that had allied with the French by keeping them separated from the American frontiersmen. To this end, the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] restricted settlement west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], as this was designated an [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]].<ref>Colin G. Calloway, ''The Scratch of a Pen: 1763 and the Transformation of North America'' (2006), pp. 92\u201398</ref> Some groups of settlers disregarded the proclamation, however, and continued to move west and establish farms.<ref>W. J. Rorabaugh, Donald T. Critchlow, Paula C. Baker (2004). \"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VL_6X5zWOokC&pg=PA92 America's promise: a concise history of the United States]''\". Rowman & Littlefield. p. 92. {{ISBN|0-7425-1189-8}}</ref> The proclamation was soon modified and was no longer a hindrance to settlement, but the fact angered the colonists that it had been promulgated without their prior consultation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Holton | first1 = Woody | year = 1994 | title = The Ohio Indians and the coming of the American revolution in Virginia | url = | journal = Journal of Southern History | volume = 60 | issue = 3| pages = 453\u201378 | doi = 10.2307/2210989 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Benjamin Franklin - Join or Die.jpg|thumb|alt=''[[Join, or Die]]'' by Benjamin Franklin was recycled to encourage the former colonies to unite against British rule|''[[Join, or Die]]'' by [[Benjamin Franklin]] was recycled to encourage the former colonies to unite against British rule.]]\nParliament had directly levied duties and excise taxes on the colonies, bypassing the colonial legislatures, and Americans began to insist on the principle of \"[[no taxation without representation]]\" with intense protests over the [[Stamp Act of 1765]].<ref>J. R. Pole, [https://www.questia.com/read/89805613 ''Political Representation in England and the Origins of the American Republic''] (London; Melbourne: Macmillan, 1966), 31 [[Questia Online Library]]</ref> They argued that the colonies had no representation in the British Parliament, so it was a violation of their rights as Englishmen for taxes to be imposed upon them. Parliament rejected the colonial protests and asserted its authority by passing new taxes.\n\nColonial discontentment grew with the passage of the 1773 [[Tea Act]], which reduced taxes on tea sold by the [[East India Company]] in an effort to undercut competition, and Prime Minister North's ministry hoped that this would establish a precedent of colonists accepting British taxation policies. Trouble escalated over the tea tax, as Americans in each colony boycotted the tea, and those in Boston dumped the tea in the harbor during the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773 when the [[Sons of Liberty]] dumped thousands of pounds of tea into the water. Tensions escalated in 1774 as Parliament passed the laws known as the [[Intolerable Acts]], which greatly restricted self-government in the colony of Massachusetts. These laws also allowed British military commanders to claim colonial homes for the quartering of soldiers, regardless whether the American civilians were willing or not to have soldiers in their homes. The laws further revoked colonial rights to hold trials in cases involving soldiers or crown officials, forcing such trials to be held in England rather than in America. Parliament also sent [[Thomas Gage]] to serve as Governor of Massachusetts and as the commander of British forces in North America.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 112\u201314</ref>\n\nBy 1774, colonists still hoped to remain part of the British Empire, but discontentment was widespread concerning British rule throughout the Thirteen Colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 137\u201321</ref> Colonists elected delegates to the [[First Continental Congress]] which convened in [[Philadelphia]] in September 1774. In the aftermath of the Intolerable Acts, the delegates asserted that the colonies owed allegiance only to the king; they would accept royal governors as agents of the king, but they were no longer willing to recognize Parliament's right to pass legislation affecting the colonies. Most delegates opposed an attack on the British position in Boston, and the Continental Congress instead agreed to the imposition of a boycott known as the [[Continental Association]]. The boycott proved effective and the value of British imports dropped dramatically.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 123\u201327</ref> The Thirteen Colonies became increasingly divided between [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] opposed to British rule and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] who supported it.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 137\u201338</ref>\n\n==American Revolution==\n{{main|American Revolution}}\n[[File:British colonies 1763-76 shepherd1923.PNG|thumb|upright=1.50|Map of the Thirteen Colonies (red) and nearby colonial areas (1763\u20131775) just before the Revolutionary War]]\n\nIn response, the colonies formed bodies of elected representatives known as [[Provincial Congress]]es, and Colonists began to boycott imported British merchandise.<ref>T.H. Breen, ''American Insurgents, American Patriots: The Revolution of the People'' (2010) pp. 81\u201382</ref> Later in 1774, 12 colonies sent representatives to the [[First Continental Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]]. During the [[Second Continental Congress]], the remaining colony of Georgia sent delegates, as well.\n\nMassachusetts Governor [[Thomas Gage]] feared a confrontation with the colonists; he requested reinforcements from Britain, but the British government was not willing to pay for the expense of stationing tens of thousands of soldiers in the Thirteen Colonies. Gage was instead ordered to seize Patriot arsenals. He dispatched a force to march on the arsenal at [[Concord, Massachusetts]], but the Patriots learned about it and blocked their advance. The Patriots repulsed the British force at the April 1775 [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], then lay [[Siege of Boston|siege to Boston]].<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 132\u201333</ref>\n\nBy spring 1775, all royal officials had been expelled, and the [[Continental Congress]] hosted a convention of delegates for the 13 colonies. It raised an army to fight the British and named George Washington its commander, made treaties, declared independence, and recommended that the colonies write constitutions and become states.<ref>[[Robert Middlekauff]], ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763\u20131789'' (Oxford History of the United States) (2007)</ref> The [[Second Continental Congress]] assembled in May 1775 and began to coordinate armed resistance against Britain. It established a government that recruited soldiers and printed its own money. General Washington took command of the Patriot soldiers in New England and forced the British to withdraw from Boston. In 1776, the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence from Britain. With the help of France and Spain, they defeated the British in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. In the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], Britain officially recognized the independence of the United States of America.\n\n==Thirteen British colonies population==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; float:right; clear:right; margin-left:8px; margin-right:0;\"\n|+ Population of the thirteen British colonies<ref>Note: the population figures are estimates by historians; they do not include the Indian tribes outside the jurisdiction of the colonies.

From 1770 until 1860, the rate of natural growth of North American slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in Europe, and was nearly twice as rapid as that in England.\n\n==Religion==\nProtestantism was the predominant religious affiliation in the Thirteen Colonies, although there were also Catholics, Jews, and [[deists]], and a large fraction had no religious connection. The [[Church of England]] was officially established in most of the South. The [[Puritan movement]] became the [[Congregational church]], and it was the established religious affiliation in Massachusetts and Connecticut into the 18th century.<ref>Stephen Foster, ''The Long Argument: English Puritanism and the Shaping of New England Culture, 1570\u20131700;'' (1996).</ref> In practice, this meant that tax revenues were allocated to church expenses. The [[Anglican]] parishes in the South were under the control of local vestries and had public functions such as repair of the roads and relief of the poor.<ref>Patricia U. Bonomi, ''Under the cope of heaven: Religion, society, and politics in Colonial America'' (2003).</ref>\n\nThe colonies were religiously diverse, with different Protestant denominations brought by British, German, Dutch, and other immigrants. The [[Reformed tradition]] was the foundation for [[Presbyterian]], [[Congregationalist]], and [[Continental Reformed]] denominations. French [[Huguenots]] set up their own Reformed congregations. The [[Dutch Reformed Church]] was strong among [[Dutch Americans]] in New York and New Jersey, while [[Lutheranism]] was prevalent among [[German American|German immigrants]]. Germans also brought diverse forms of [[Anabaptism]], especially the [[Mennonite]] variety. [[Reformed Baptist]] preacher [[Roger Williams]] founded [[Providence Plantations]] which became the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]]. Jews were clustered in a few port cities. The Baltimore family founded [[Maryland]] and brought in fellow Catholics from England.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 44209361|title = Catholicism in Colonial Maryland|journal = Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia|volume = 51|issue = 1|pages = 65\u201383|last1 = Rita|first1 = M.|year = 1940}}</ref> Catholics were estimated at 1.6% of the population or 40,000 in 1775. Of the 200\u2013250,000 Irish who came to the Colonies between 1701 and 1775 less than 20,000 were Catholic, many of whom hid their faith or lapsed because of prejudice and discrimination. Between 1770\u20131775 3,900 Irish Catholics arrived out of almost 45,000 white immigrants (7,000 English, 15,000 Scots, 13,200 Scots-Irish, 5,200 Germans), Jon Butler, Becoming America, The Revolution before 1776, 2000, p. 35, {{ISBN|0-674-00091-9}}. Most Catholics were English Recusants, Germans, Irish and blacks who lived in Maryland where half the Catholic population lived, New York and Pennsylvania.

Stevens, ''The poor Indians: British missionaries, Native Americans, and colonial sensibility'' (2010).</ref>\n\n===Education===\nHigher education was available for young men in the north, and most students were aspiring Protestant ministers. The oldest colleges were [[Harvard College|New College (Harvard)]], [[Princeton College|College of New Jersey (Princeton)]], [[Yale College|Collegiate School (Yale)]], [[Columbia University|King's College (Columbia)]], and the [[Brown University|College of Rhode Island (Brown)]]. Other colleges were [[University of Pennsylvania|College of Philadelphia (University of Pennsylvania)]], [[Rutgers College|Queen's College (Rutgers)]] and [[Dartmouth College]] in New Hampshire. South of Philadelphia, there was only the [[College of William and Mary]] which trained the secular elite in Virginia, especially aspiring lawyers.\n\nThe southern colonies held the belief that the family had the responsibility of educating their children, mirroring the common belief in Europe. Wealthy families either used tutors and governesses from Britain or sent children to school in England. By the 1700s, university students based in the colonies began to act as tutors.<ref>Urban, Wayne J. and Jennings L. Wagoner, Jr. ''American Education: A History''.

Girls were educated at home or by small local private schools, and they had no access to college. Aspiring physicians and lawyers typically learned as apprentices to an established practitioner, although some young men went to medical schools in Scotland.<ref>Wayne J. Urban and Jennings L. Wagoner Jr., ''American Education: A History'' (5th ed. 2013) pp 11\u201354.</ref>\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies}}\n\nThe three forms of colonial government in 1776 were provincial ([[royal colony]]), [[Proprietary colony|proprietary]], and [[Charter colony|charter]]. These governments were all subordinate to the British monarch with no representation in the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]. The administration of all British colonies was overseen by the [[Board of Trade]] in London beginning late in the 17th century.\n\nThe provincial colony was governed by commissions created at pleasure of the king. A governor and his council were appointed by the crown. The governor was invested with general executive powers and authorized to call a locally elected assembly. The governor's council would sit as an upper house when the assembly was in session, in addition to its role in advising the governor. Assemblies were made up of representatives elected by the freeholders and planters (landowners) of the province. The governor had the power of absolute veto and could [[Legislative session|prorogue]] (i.e., delay) and dissolve the assembly. The assembly's role was to make all local laws and ordinances, ensuring that they were not inconsistent with the laws of Britain. In practice, this did not always occur, since many of the provincial assemblies sought to expand their powers and limit those of the governor and crown. Laws could be examined by the British Privy Council or Board of Trade, which also held veto power of legislation. New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia were crown colonies. Massachusetts became a crown colony at the end of the 17th century.\n\nProprietary colonies were governed much as royal colonies, except that lord proprietors appointed the governor rather than the king. They were set up after the [[English Restoration]] of 1660 and typically enjoyed greater civil and religious liberty. Pennsylvania (which included Delaware), New Jersey, and Maryland were proprietary colonies.<ref>John Andrew Doyle, ''English Colonies in America: Volume IV The Middle Colonies'' (1907) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4wYOAAAAIAAJ  online]</ref>\n\nCharter governments were political corporations created by [[letters patent]], giving the grantees control of the land and the powers of legislative government. The charters provided a fundamental constitution and divided powers among legislative, executive, and judicial functions, with those powers being vested in officials. Massachusetts, Providence Plantation, Rhode Island, Warwick, and Connecticut were charter colonies. The Massachusetts charter was revoked in 1684 and was replaced by a provincial charter that was issued in 1691.<ref>Louise Phelps Kellogg, ''The American colonial charter'' (1904) [https://archive.org/details/americancolonia00kellgoog  online]</ref> [[Providence Plantations]] merged with the settlements at [[Aquidneck Island|Rhode Island]] and [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]] to form the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], which also became a charter colony in 1636.\n\n===British role===\nAfter 1680, the imperial government in London took an increasing interest in the affairs of the colonies, which were growing rapidly in population and wealth. In 1680, only Virginia was a royal colony; by 1720, half were under the control of royal governors. These governors were appointees closely tied to the government in London.\n\nHistorians before the 1880s emphasized American nationalism. However, scholarship after that time was heavily influenced by the \"Imperial school\" led by [[Herbert L. Osgood]], [[George Louis Beer]], [[Charles McLean Andrews]], and [[Lawrence H. Gipson]]. This viewpoint dominated colonial historiography into the 1940s, and they emphasized and often praised the attention that London gave to all the colonies. In this view, there was never a threat (before the 1770s) that any colony would revolt or seek independence.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=27787750|url=http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/7801/9315|title=The Imperial School of American Colonial Historians|journal=Indiana Magazine of History|volume=45|issue=2|pages=123\u2013134|last1=Savelle|first1=Max|year=1949}}</ref>\n\n===Self-government===\nBritish settlers did not come to the American colonies with the intention of creating a democratic system; yet they quickly created a broad electorate without a land-owning aristocracy, along with a pattern of free elections which put a strong emphasis on voter participation. The colonies offered a much freer degree of [[suffrage]] than Britain or indeed any other country. Any property owner could vote for members of the lower house of the legislature, and they could even vote for the governor in Connecticut and Rhode Island.<ref name=\"Robert\">Robert J. Dinkin, ''Voting in Provincial America: A Study of Elections in the Thirteen Colonies, 1689\u20131776'' (1977)</ref> Voters were required to hold an \"interest\" in society; as the South Carolina legislature said in 1716, \"it is necessary and reasonable, that none but such persons will have an interest in the Province should be capable to elect members of the Commons House of Assembly\".<ref>Thomas Cooper and David James McCord, eds. ''The Statutes at Large of South Carolina: Acts, 1685\u20131716'' (1837) p. 688</ref> The main legal criterion for having an \"interest\" was ownership of real estate property, which was uncommon in Britain, where 19 out of 20 men were controlled politically by their landlords. (Women, children, indentured servants, and slaves were subsumed under the interest of the family head.) London insisted on this requirement for the colonies, telling governors to exclude from the ballot men who were not freeholders\u2014that is, those who did not own land. Nevertheless, land was so widely owned that 50% to 80% of the men were eligible to vote.<ref>Alexander Keyssar, ''The Right to Vote'' (2000) pp. 5\u20138</ref>\n\nThe colonial political culture emphasized deference, so that local notables were the men who ran and were chosen. But sometimes they competed with each other and had to appeal to the common man for votes. There were no political parties, and would-be legislators formed ad-hoc coalitions of their families, friends, and neighbors. Outside of Puritan New England, election day brought in all the men from the countryside to the county seat to make merry, politick, shake hands with the grandees, meet old friends, and hear the speeches\u2014all the while toasting, eating, treating, tippling, and gambling. They voted by shouting their choice to the clerk, as supporters cheered or booed. Candidate [[George Washington]] spent \u00a339 for treats for his supporters. The candidates knew that they had to \"swill the planters with bumbo\" (rum). Elections were carnivals where all men were equal for one day and traditional restraints were relaxed.<ref>Daniel Vickers, ''A Companion to Colonial America'' (2006) p. 300</ref>\n\nThe actual rate of voting ranged from 20% to 40% of all adult white males. The rates were higher in Pennsylvania and New York, where long-standing factions based on ethnic and religious groups mobilized supporters at a higher rate. New York and Rhode Island developed long-lasting two-faction systems that held together for years at the colony level, but they did not reach into local affairs. The factions were based on the personalities of a few leaders and an array of family connections, and they had little basis in policy or ideology. Elsewhere the political scene was in a constant whirl, based on personality rather than long-lived factions or serious disputes on issues.<ref name=\"Robert\" />\n\nThe colonies were independent of one other long before 1774; indeed, all the colonies began as separate and unique settlements or plantations. Further, efforts had failed to form a colonial union through the [[Albany Congress]] of 1754 led by [[Benjamin Franklin]]. The thirteen all had well-established systems of self-government and elections based on the [[Rights of Englishmen]] which they were determined to protect from imperial interference.<ref>Greene and Pole, eds. (2004), p. 665</ref>\n\n===Economic policy===\nThe British Empire at the time operated under the [[Mercantilism|mercantile system]], where all trade was concentrated inside the Empire, and trade with other empires was forbidden. The goal was to enrich Britain\u2014its merchants and its government. Whether the policy was good for the colonists was not an issue in London, but Americans became increasingly restive with mercantilist policies.<ref>Max Savelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA204 ''Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind'' (2005) pp. 204\u201311]</ref>\n\nMercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants\u2014and kept others out\u2014by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling\u2014which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch.<ref>George Otto Trevelyan, ''The American revolution: Volume 1'' [https://archive.org/details/americanrevolut14trevgoog/page/n13 <!-- pg=128 quote=smuggling american revolution. --> (1899) p. 128 online]</ref> The tactic used by mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb [[History of the Royal Navy#Expansion of the fighting force, 1642\u20131689|Royal Navy]], which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy captured [[New Amsterdam]] (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.<ref>William R. Nester, ''The Great Frontier War: Britain, France, and the Imperial Struggle for North America, 1607\u20131755'' (Praeger, 2000) p, 54.</ref>\n\nBritain implemented mercantilism by trying to block American trade with the French, Spanish, or Dutch empires using the [[Navigation Acts]], which Americans avoided as often as they could. The royal officials responded to smuggling with open-ended search warrants ([[Writ of assistance|Writs of Assistance]]). In 1761, Boston lawyer [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] argued that the writs violated the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutional rights]] of the colonists. He lost the case, but John Adams later wrote, \"Then and there the child Independence was born.\"<ref name=Stephens2006>Stephens, ''Unreasonable Searches and Seizures'' (2006) p. 306</ref>\n\nHowever, the colonists took pains to argue that they did not oppose British regulation of their external trade; they only opposed legislation which affected them internally.\n\n==Other British colonies==\n{{main|British America}}\n[[File:British Colonies in North America c1750 v2.png|thumb|right|British colonies in North America, {{Circa|1750}}{{ordered list|[[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]|Nova Scotia|Thirteen Colonies|Bermuda|[[Bahamas]]|[[British Honduras]]|[[Jamaica]]|[[British Leeward Islands]] and [[Barbados]]}}]]\n\nBesides these thirteen colonies, Britain had another dozen in the [[British America|New World]]. Those in the [[British West Indies]], [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]], the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Bermuda]], and [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]] remained loyal to the crown throughout the war (although Spain reacquired Florida before the war was over, and later  sold it to the United States). There was a certain degree of sympathy with the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] cause in several of the other colonies, but their geographical isolation and the dominance of British naval power precluded any effective participation.<ref>Jack P. Greene and J. R. Pole, eds.

It was tightly bound to Britain and controlled by the Royal Navy and had no assembly that could voice grievances.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nNova Scotia had a large [[Yankee]] element that had recently arrived from New England, and shared the sentiments of the Americans about demanding the rights of the British men. The royal government in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] reluctantly allowed the Yankees of Nova Scotia a kind of \"neutrality\". In any case, the island-like geography and the presence of the major British naval base at Halifax made the thought of armed resistance impossible.<ref>Meinig pp. 313\u201314; Greene and Pole (2004) ch. 61</ref>\n\nQuebec was inhabited by French Catholic settlers who came under British control in the previous decade. The [[Quebec Act of 1774]] gave them formal cultural autonomy within the empire, and many priests feared the intense Protestantism in New England. The American grievances over taxation had little relevance, and there was no assembly nor elections of any kind that could have mobilized any grievances. Even so, the Americans offered membership in the new nation and sent a military expedition that failed to [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|capture Canada]] in 1775. Most Canadians remained neutral but some joined the American cause.<ref>Meinig pp 314\u201315; Greene and Pole (2004) ch 61</ref>\n\nIn the West Indies the elected assemblies of Jamaica, [[Grenada]], and Barbados formally declared their sympathies for the American cause and called for mediation, but the others were quite loyal. Britain carefully avoided antagonizing the rich owners of sugar plantations (many of whom lived in London); in turn the planters' greater dependence on slavery made them recognize the need for British military protection from possible slave revolts. The possibilities for overt action were sharply limited by the overwhelming power of Royal Navy in the islands. During the war there was some opportunistic trading with American ships.<ref>Andrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy, ''An Empire Divided: The American Revolution and the British Caribbean'' (2000) ch 6</ref>\n\nIn Bermuda and the Bahamas local leaders were angry at the food shortages caused by British blockade of American ports. There was increasing sympathy for the American cause, including smuggling, and both colonies were considered \"passive allies\" of the United States throughout the war. When an American naval squadron arrived in the Bahamas to seize gunpowder, the colony gave no resistance at all.<ref>Meinig pp. 315\u201316; Greene and Pole (2004) ch. 63</ref>\n\nEast Florida and West Florida were territories transferred from Spain to Britain after the French and Indian War by treaty. The few British colonists there needed protection from attacks by Indians and Spanish privateers. After 1775, East Florida became a major base for the British war effort in the South, especially in the invasions of Georgia and South Carolina.<ref>Meinig p. 316</ref> However, Spain seized Pensacola in West Florida in 1781, then recovered both territories in the [[Peace of Paris (1783)#Treaty with Spain|Treaty of Paris]] that ended the war in 1783. Spain ultimately transferred the Florida provinces to the United States in 1819.<ref>P. J. Marshall, ed.

Some cultural activities and festivals are associated with ancient tribal gods and rites, but many of them are no longer performed since the spread of Christianity.\n\n== Festival ==\nThe new yam festival is a solemn occasion and starts with the planting season in March, when the chief priest and elders start the planting of yams. Before the first yam is planted, elders pay homage to their traditional ruler or chief, the Dede Igbo, who is the custodian of tradition and the ancestral father of the Omuma [[Igbo people]].\n\nTop members of the Igbo people, such as high chiefs, title holders, respected elders, and important personalities in the community, form an entourage to make the journey to the Dede. When this entourage arrives at the Ezeonomobi Igbo, the members are usually received by the leader according to cultural tradition, by presenting them locally brewed palm wine, kola nut, and white clay, which is first offered to the gods as supplication before the visitors.\n\nThe group conducts brief discussions and prayers. The conventional calendar puts the planting season in January, while the Igbo calendar, which is agrarian, is called the first Eke and starts in the month of February, known as Onwa Mmiri Nda Afo.\n\nIn Igbo areas, the yam is an important economic crop, highly favored and a regular staple in most homes. The yam is considered the chief crop and forerunner of other crops in the region. The planting season begins on the first week of February and the crop usually takes six months to mature, making the festival period between late July and early August when the valuable crop is harvested.\n\n== Education ==\n\n=== Secondary schools ===\n*Divine Favour Secondary School, Omuma\n*Omuma Technical College, Omuma\n*Omuma community school, Omuma\n*Uche Stenography Academy, Umuhu-Omuma\n*Holy Trinity Secondary School, Omuma\n\n=== Primary schools ===\n*Ozuh primary school, Ozuh-omuma\n*Abia Central School, Abia-Omuma\n*Community Primary School, Amaodum Etiti-Omuma\n*Umuhu Primary School, Umuhu-Omuma\n*Powerline Primary School, Abia-Omuma\n*Omuma Central School, Omuma\n\n== Economy ==\nOmuma sits in the rain forest and produces many agricultural products, such as yams, cassava, taro, ona, corn, rubber, and palm.
