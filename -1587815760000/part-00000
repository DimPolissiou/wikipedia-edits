Blacc co-wrote the song with Leon Michels, [[Nick Movshon]] and Jeff Dynamite.<ref name=\"dutchcharts\">{{cite web|url=http://dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Aloe+Blacc&titel=I+Need+A+Dollar&cat=s|title=I Need a Dollar|publisher=Dutch Charts|accessdate=27 January 2011|language=Dutch}}</ref>\n\nIt is the intro song for the [[HBO]] show ''[[How to Make It in America]]'', and was featured as the iTunes Single of the Week.<ref>Stanley, Alessandra.

February 12, 2010.</ref> It also featured in the game [[Fight Night Champion]]. Blacc has performed the song live on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]'', ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]'', ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'', and ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]''. In April 2011, it was featured in a commercial for [[Boost Mobile]] wireless services. This song also speeds up by 2bpm through it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Music video==\nTwo versions of the video have been released. The first, the \"[[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]\" version directed by [[Derek Pike]], shows Blacc walking alone along a highway in [[Nevada]], and then hitching a ride to Las Vegas, where he finds a dollar coin on the casino floor, uses it to play a slot machine, and wins.\n\nThe second (used for the international release), the \"[[New York City|New York]]\" version, features the screen being split in half. The right side shows Blacc singing inside an apartment while the left side shows a man walking through the streets of New York.

February 12, 2010.</ref> It also featured in the game [[Fight Night Champion]]. Blacc has performed the song live on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]'', ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]'', ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'', and ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]''. In April 2011, it was featured in a commercial for [[Boost Mobile]] wireless services. This song also speeds up by 2bpm through it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Music video==\nTwo versions of the video have been released. The first, the \"[[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]\" version directed by [[Derek Pike]], shows Blacc walking alone along a highway in [[Nevada]], and then hitching a ride to Las Vegas, where he finds a dollar coin on the casino floor, uses it to play a slot machine, and wins.\n\nThe second (used for the international release), the \"[[New York City|New York]]\" version, features the screen being split in half. The right side shows Blacc singing inside an apartment while the left side shows a man walking through the streets of New York. Once Aloe enters the left side after the line \"Maybe it's inside the bottle\" and performs at a bar, the song changes to \"So Hard\".\n\n==Formats and track listings==\n;UK digital single<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B004V8EA2G/|title=I Need A Dollar|work=amazon.co.uk}}</ref>\n#\"I Need a Dollar\" \u2013 4:05\n#\"I Need a Dollar\" (Radio Mix) \u2013 3:22\n#\"I Need a Dollar\" ([[DJ Zinc|Zinc]] Remix) \u2013 5:48\n#\"I Need a Dollar\" (Blue Fear Trance Remix) \u2013 10:49\n\n;German digital single<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00420S83A/|title=I Need A Dollar|work=amazon.de}}</ref>\n#\"I Need a Dollar\" \u2013 4:02\n#\"I Need a Dollar\" ([[Tensnake]] Remix) \u2013 6:45\n#\"I Need a Dollar\" (M.Arfmann & Chassy Wezar RMX) \u2013 3:27\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Music of Nier", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2017}}\n{{good article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Music of ''Nier''}}\n''[[Nier (video game)|Nier]]'' is an [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]] developed by [[Cavia (company)|Cavia]] and published by [[Square Enix]] in 2010. The '''music of ''Nier''''' was composed by [[Keiichi Okabe]] with members of his studio, Monaca, Kakeru Ishihama and Keigo Hoashi, and Takafumi Nishimura of Cavia. The soundtrack has inspired the release of four official albums by Square Enix\u2014an official soundtrack album and three albums of arrangements\u2014along with two mini-albums included as pre-order bonuses for the Japanese versions of the game and two licensed EPs of jazz arrangements.\n\nThe original soundtrack was highly praised; reviewers noted it as one of the best video game soundtracks of the year, praising the originality of the compositions and the beauty of Emi Evans' vocal work. The first arranged album, while also warmly received, was perceived by critics to be weaker than the original and not long enough to stand up to the expectations created by the success of the original. The first three albums sold well enough to be recorded on the Japanese [[Oricon]] music charts, reaching number 24 for the original soundtrack, 59 for the first arranged album, and position number 77 for the second.\n\nThe soundtrack for Nier's sequel, ''[[Nier: Automata]]'', was released worldwide on March 29, 2017. Returning collaborators include Keiichi Okabe and the Monaca team on composing duties and Emi Evans on vocals, along with several other singers and lyricists. ''Nier: Automata Original Soundtrack'' was highly reviewed by critics, and the album peaked at number 2 on the Oricon charts.\n\n==Development==\nThe soundtrack to ''Nier'' was composed by a collaboration of the studio Monaca, consisting of Keiichi Okabe, Kakeru Ishihama, and Keigo Hoashi, along with Takafumi Nishimura from Cavia, the game's developer. Okabe served as the lead composer and as the director for the project as a whole. Okabe was brought onto the project when the concept for the game was first being devised, and worked intermittently on the soundtrack for the next three years until its release. The music for the game was generally composed entirely separate from the development of the game. Often, elements of the game were modified to match the music, rather than the other way around. Some tracks were used in ways that the composers did not envision, such as \"Grandma\", which was expected to be used in the prologue of the game but was instead chosen as a boss battle theme. The music was designed for different motifs to appear in various arrangements throughout the soundtrack, and also to convey a sense of sadness even during the \"thrilling\" tracks. Okabe was allowed a great deal of freedom regarding what the music was to sound like; game director Taro Yoko's main request was that he use a lot of vocal works.<ref name=\"OKABEint\"/>\n\nThe vocals and lyrics were provided by vocalist Emi Evans (Emiko Rebecca Evans), a singer from England living in Tokyo. She is the singer for the band freesscape, and had previously worked on video game projects such as the ''[[Etrian Odyssey]]'' arrange albums.<ref name=\"OSVint\"/> The Monaca team had met her when considering her for a prior project, and Okabe wanted to work with her on ''Nier''.<ref name=\"OKABEint\"/> She was approached a few months after the initial meeting in Autumn 2008 to be the vocalist for the soundtrack. In addition to singing, Evans was asked to write her own lyrics in futuristic languages. The composers gave her preliminary version of songs and the style they wished the language to be in, such as Scottish Gaelic or French, and she invented the words. Evans wrote songs in versions of [[Scottish Gaelic]], Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English and Japanese, and wrote \"Song of the Ancients\" in an entirely fictional language. She wrote that song by listening to songs in as many languages as possible and jumbling them up together. For the other languages, she tried to imagine what they would sound like after 1000 years of drifting.<ref name=\"OSVint\"/>\n\nOkabe did not want to use traditional lyrics, as he felt they would clash with the design of the world in the game, and wanted to use a variety of languages to represent the open nature of the game's world. He also did not want easily recognizable lyrics to be sung in the background while the characters were speaking, and for any noticeable words to instead evoke emotions in the player.<ref name=\"OKABEint\"/> Evans only knew English, Japanese, and French when she began the project; she listened to the other languages on [[YouTube]] to learn the rhythms and sounds of the languages and then mixed and changed them.<ref name=\"GUint\"/> Okabe largely allowed Evans to decide how to integrate the lyrics with the early forms of the songs, and as he usually did not know where the songs would be used in the game gave her only light direction as to the emotional tone for the songs. The composers often would modify the songs in later revisions to follow how Evans had sung for that song.<ref name=\"OSVint\"/>\n\n==Releases==\n===NieR Gestalt & Replicant Original Soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name         = NieR Gestalt & Replicant Original Soundtrack\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Keiichi Okabe]]\n| cover        = Nier OST Cover.jpg\n| alt          =\n| released     = April 21, 2010\n| recorded     =\n| venue        =\n| studio       =\n| genre        = [[Video game music]]\n| length       = 2:30:09\n| label        = [[Square Enix]]\n| producer     =\n| prev_title   =\n| prev_year    =\n| next_title   =\n| next_year    =\n}}\nThe soundtrack to ''Nier'' is largely composed of melancholy acoustic pieces which heavily feature vocals by Emi Evans. Of the 43 tracks included in the released soundtrack album, only 9 do not have any vocal component to them; these are the four versions each of \"Dispossession\" and \"Yonah\", as well as \"Dance of the Evanescent\".<ref name=\"RPGFost\"/> With the exception of \"Ashes of Dreams\", the lyrics are not intended to mean anything; for that song, Evans was given a list of Japanese words to use, which she then translated for the English, French, and Scottish Gaelic versions of the song. The song and its variants were the last to be recorded, and Evans convinced the composers that one song in the soundtrack should have recognizable lyrics rather than futuristic English as they originally planned. Evans found \"Ashes\" to be the most difficult song to write on the soundtrack, as she had difficulty writing lyrics that met the composers' criteria of despair and lack of hope.<ref name=\"OSVint\"/>\n\n\"Hills of Radiant Wind\" is one of the few upbeat songs on the largely dark soundtrack; for that piece Evans sang in a version of Portuguese in a style meant to sound like a spirit floating on the wind. For \"Grandma\", she sang in a French style, trying to \"put in as much anguish and melancholy\" as possible; she created the song in a single recording, and it is \"one of the most memorable songs\" that she has sung. \"The Wretched Automatons\" is sung in a variant of English and was recorded prior to the addition of the mechanical sounds that run throughout the track, while \"Kain\u00e9\" is in a version of Gaelic.<ref name=\"OSVint\"/>\n\nSquare Enix released a soundtrack album of music from the game, titled ''NieR Gestalt & Replicant Original Soundtrack'', on April 21, 2010. The two-disc, 2:30:09-long album has the catalog numbers of SQEX-10189/90.<ref name=\"RPGFost\"/> As preorder bonuses for ''Nier Gestalt'' and ''Nier Replicant'', the two versions of the game released in Japan, two mini-albums, ''Nier Gestalt Mini Album'' and ''Nier Replicant Mini Album'', were included. Each one contains five tracks from the full soundtrack album; ''Gestalt'' corresponds with tracks 1 and 4 from disc 1, 8 and 13 from disc 2, and an electronic version of \"Kain\u00e9\" titled \"Kain\u00e9 / Rain of Light\", while ''Replicant'' encompasses track 3 from disc 2, tracks 2 and 7 from disc 1, track 1 from disc 2, and a medley of several tracks.<ref name=\"SEMOges\"/><ref name=\"SEMOrep\"/> ''Gestalt'' is 18:11 long, and ''Replicant'' 17:11.<ref name=\"SEMOges\"/><ref name=\"SEMOrep\"/> A book of sheet music of piano arrangements of tracks from the game by Okabe was published by KMP on April 22, 2011. The book, ''NieR Gestalt & Replicant Official Score Book'', contains 25 arrangements in 112 pages.<ref name=\"OSTpiano\"/> Guitar arrangements of \"Song of the Ancients / Devola\" and \"Yonah / Strings Ver.\" by Yuji Sekiguchi were included in the ''Square Enix Official Best Collection'' guitar solo sheet music book, published by KMP in May 2011.<ref name=\"KMPguitar\"/>\n\nThe soundtrack album reached number 24 on the Japanese [[Oricon]] music charts, and remained on the charts for 11 weeks.<ref name=\"ORIost\"/> It was well received by critics; Patrick Gann of RPGFan called the album \"an insanely good soundtrack\" and noted it as his candidate for video game soundtrack of the year, as well as \"one of the best game soundtracks ever\". He applauded that the music was both \"meticulously-crafted\" and \"accessible to the untrained ear\".<ref name=\"RPGFost\"/> Don Kotowski of Square Enix Music Online praised the \"captivating vocal work\" and \"exquisite\" composition.

The album, ''NieR Gestalt & Replicant 15 Nightmares & Arrange Tracks'', contains 11 tracks across a length of 54:43, and has a catalog number of SQEX-10212. The arrangements were done by composers Okabe, Ishihama, and Hoashi, as well as by \"oriori\", Ryuichi Takada, and [[Hidekazu Tanaka]]. The first five arrangements, in a techno style, were included in the ''Nier'' DLC, while the remaining tracks are piano, instrumental, chiptune, and a cappella versions of tracks from the game.<ref name=\"RPGFarrange\"/> In the liner notes for the album, Okabe said that the DLC tracks were meant to be \"more war-like\" versions of the originals, while the second half of the album was intended to \"maintain the image and worldview of the original music\".<ref name=\"SEMOliner\"/>\n\nThe arranged album reached number 59 on the Oricon music charts, a position it held for a week.<ref name=\"ORIarrange\"/> It was warmly received by reviewers, if less so than the first album; Patrick Gann critiqued the album as not being as good as the original, though he noted that \"you can still be awesome and rank second to that album\". He concluded that the arrangements were all of good quality, but that listeners would not be \"blown away by it\".<ref name=\"RPGFarrange\"/> Don Kotowski found it to be an \"accomplished arrange album\", but inferior to the original as he felt that it was shorter than it should have been and that the final two tracks were weaker than the rest of the arrangements.<ref name=\"SEMOarrange\"/> Jayson Napolitano also felt that the album should have been longer; he thought that most listeners would skip the DLC tracks in favor of the acoustic arrangements, and that six tracks was not enough to carry the album given the expectations created by the quality of the original soundtrack.<ref name=\"OSVarrange\"/>\n\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Track list\n| collapsed = yes\n| extra_column = Japanese title\n| title1 = Song of the Ancients - Lost Androids Mixuxux\n| extra1 = \u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30a8\u30ce\u30a6\u30bf - Lost Androids Mixuxux\n| length1 = 5:35\n| title2 = Blu-bird - Hansel und Gretel\n| extra2 = \u9752\u30a4\u9ce5 - Hansel und Gretel\n| length2 = 5:05\n| title3 = Shadowlord's Castle - Iron Fist mix feat.DJ-BKO\n| extra3 = \u9b54\u738b\u30ce\u57ce - Iron Fist mix feat.DJ-BKO\n| length3 = 5:05\n| title4 = Emil - Ultimate Weapon No.7\n| extra4 = \u30a8\u30df\u30fc\u30eb - Ultimate Weapon No.7\n| length4 = 5:34\n| title5 = Shadowlord - Crying Yonah Version\n| extra5 = \u9b54\u738b - Crying Yonah Version\n| length5 = 5:39\n| title6 = Emil / Piano Ver.\n| extra6 = \u30a8\u30df\u30fc\u30eb/\u30d4\u30a2\u30ceVer\n| length6 = 4:02\n| title7 = Kain\u00e9 / Duet Ver.\n| extra7 = \u30ab\u30a4\u30cd/\u91cd\u594fVer\n| length7 = 4:17\n| title8 = The Wretched Automatons / A Cappella\n| extra8 = \u611a\u30ab\u30b7\u30a4\u6a5f\u68b0/\u30a2\u30ab\u30da\u30e9Ver\n| length8 = 3:32\n| title9 = Song of the Ancients / Piano Ver.\n| extra9 = \u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30a8\u30ce\u30a6\u30bf/\u30d4\u30a2\u30ceVer\n| length9 = 5:00\n| title10 = Shadowlord / Music Box Ver.\n| extra10 = \u9b54\u738b/\u30aa\u30eb\u30b4\u30fc\u30ebVer\n| length10 = 2:15\n| title11 = The Legend of Nier: 8-bit Heroes\n| extra11 = \u30cb\u30fc\u30a2\u306e\u4f1d\u8aac\uff5e8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u52c7\u8005\u305f\u3061\uff5e\n| length11 = 8:39\n}}\n{{-}}\n\n===NieR tribute album -echo-===\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name         = NieR tribute album -echo-\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = Keiichi Okabe\n| cover        =\n| alt          =\n| released     = September 14, 2011\n| recorded     =\n| venue        =\n| studio       =\n| genre        = [[Video game music]]\n| length       = 1:00:46\n| label        = [[Square Enix]]\n| producer     =\n| prev_title   =\n| prev_year    =\n| next_title   =\n| next_year    =\n}}\n\nOn September 14, 2011 Square Enix published a third ''Nier'' album, titled ''NieR Tribute Album -echo-''.

Its music was again composed by Keiichi Okabe and the Monaca team, with Emi Evans, J'Nique Nicole, and Nami Nakagawa on vocals, Takanori Goto on guitar, and additional contributions by several artists. A soundtrack album for the game was released worldwide by Square Enix on March 29, 2017. The three-disc, 3:33:43-long album contains all of the music from the game, as well as, like the original game's album, variations on the main theme in multiple languages. Unlike the original ''Nier'', where all of the versions were written and sung by Emi Evans and had the same lyrical meanings, the versions in ''Automata'' were written and sung by multiple people: the English version by J'Nique Nicole, one in an invented French-derived language by Evans, and the Japanese written by Yoko Taro and sung by Marina Kawano.<ref name=\"RPGFauto\"/>\n\n''NieR: Automata Original Soundtrack'' peaked at number 2 on the Oricon charts,<ref name=\"ORIauto\"/> with over 28,000 copies sold in its first week in Japan.<ref name=\"BILLauto\"/> It was well received by critics; Patrick Gann of RPGFan said the album was as good or better than the original as well as \"perfectly, wonderfully great\".<ref name=\"RPGFauto\"/>\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = Disc 1\n| extra_column    = Japanese title\n\n| title1          = Significance -

(company)|Cavia]] and published by [[Square Enix]] in 2010. The '''music of ''Nier''''' was composed by [[Keiichi Okabe]] with members of his studio, Monaca, Kakeru Ishihama and Keigo Hoashi, and Takafumi Nishimura of Cavia. The soundtrack has inspired the release of four official albums by Square Enix\u2014an official soundtrack album and three albums of arrangements\u2014along with two mini-albums included as pre-order bonuses for the Japanese versions of the game and two licensed EPs of jazz arrangements.\n\nThe original soundtrack was highly praised; reviewers noted it as one of the best video game soundtracks of the year, praising the originality of the compositions and the beauty of Emi Evans' vocal work. The first arranged album, while also warmly received, was perceived by critics to be weaker than the original and not long enough to stand up to the expectations created by the success of the original. The first three albums sold well enough to be recorded on the Japanese [[Oricon]] music charts, reaching number 24 for the original soundtrack, 59 for the first arranged album, and position number 77 for the second.\n\nThe soundtrack for Nier's sequel, ''[[Nier: Automata]]'', was released worldwide on March 29, 2017. Returning collaborators include Keiichi Okabe and the Monaca team on composing duties and Emi Evans on vocals, along with several other singers and lyricists. ''Nier: Automata Original Soundtrack'' was highly reviewed by critics, and the album peaked at number 2 on the Oricon charts.\n\n==Development==\nThe soundtrack to ''Nier'' was composed by a collaboration of the studio Monaca, consisting of Keiichi Okabe, Kakeru Ishihama, and Keigo Hoashi, along with Takafumi Nishimura from Cavia, the game's developer. Okabe served as the lead composer and as the director for the project as a whole. Okabe was brought onto the project when the concept for the game was first being devised, and worked intermittently on the soundtrack for the next three years until its release. The music for the game was generally composed entirely separate from the development of the game. Often, elements of the game were modified to match the music, rather than the other way around. Some tracks were used in ways that the composers did not envision, such as \"Grandma\", which was expected to be used in the prologue of the game but was instead chosen as a boss battle theme. The music was designed for different motifs to appear in various arrangements throughout the soundtrack, and also to convey a sense of sadness even during the \"thrilling\" tracks. Okabe was allowed a great deal of freedom regarding what the music was to sound like; game director Taro Yoko's main request was that he use a lot of vocal works.<ref name=\"OKABEint\"/>\n\nThe vocals and lyrics were provided by vocalist Emi Evans (Emiko Rebecca Evans), a singer from England living in Tokyo. She is the singer for the band freesscape, and had previously worked on video game projects such as the ''[[Etrian Odyssey]]'' arrange albums.<ref name=\"OSVint\"/> The Monaca team had met her when considering her for a prior project, and Okabe wanted to work with her on ''Nier''.<ref name=\"OKABEint\"/> She was approached a few months after the initial meeting in Autumn 2008 to be the vocalist for the soundtrack. In addition to singing, Evans was asked to write her own lyrics in futuristic languages. The composers gave her preliminary version of songs and the style they wished the language to be in, such as Scottish Gaelic or French, and she invented the words. Evans wrote songs in versions of [[Scottish Gaelic]], Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English and Japanese, and wrote \"Song of the Ancients\" in an entirely fictional language. She wrote that song by listening to songs in as many languages as possible and jumbling them up together. For the other languages, she tried to imagine what they would sound like after 1000 years of drifting.<ref name=\"OSVint\"/>\n\nOkabe did not want to use traditional lyrics, as he felt they would clash with the design of the world in the game, and wanted to use a variety of languages to represent the open nature of the game's world. He also did not want easily recognizable lyrics to be sung in the background while the characters were speaking, and for any noticeable words to instead evoke emotions in the player.<ref name=\"OKABEint\"/> Evans only knew English, Japanese, and French when she began the project; she listened to the other languages on [[YouTube]] to learn the rhythms and sounds of the languages and then mixed and changed them.<ref name=\"GUint\"/> Okabe largely allowed Evans to decide how to integrate the lyrics with the early forms of the songs, and as he usually did not know where the songs would be used in the game gave her only light direction as to the emotional tone for the songs. The composers often would modify the songs in later revisions to follow how Evans had sung for that song.<ref name=\"OSVint\"/>\n\n==Releases==\n===NieR Gestalt & Replicant Original Soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name         = NieR Gestalt & Replicant Original Soundtrack\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Keiichi Okabe]]\n| cover        = Nier OST Cover.jpg\n| alt          =\n| released     = April 21, 2010\n| recorded     =\n| venue        =\n| studio       =\n| genre        = [[Video game music]]\n| length       = 2:30:09\n| label        = [[Square Enix]]\n| producer     =\n| prev_title   =\n| prev_year    =\n| next_title   =\n| next_year    =\n}}\nThe soundtrack to ''Nier'' is largely composed of melancholy acoustic pieces which heavily feature vocals by Emi Evans. Of the 43 tracks included in the released soundtrack album, only 9 do not have any vocal component to them; these are the four versions each of \"Dispossession\" and \"Yonah\", as well as \"Dance of the Evanescent\".<ref name=\"RPGFost\"/> With the exception of \"Ashes of Dreams\", the lyrics are not intended to mean anything; for that song, Evans was given a list of Japanese words to use, which she then translated for the English, French, and Scottish Gaelic versions of the song. The song and its variants were the last to be recorded, and Evans convinced the composers that one song in the soundtrack should have recognizable lyrics rather than futuristic English as they originally planned. Evans found \"Ashes\" to be the most difficult song to write on the soundtrack, as she had difficulty writing lyrics that met the composers' criteria of despair and lack of hope.<ref name=\"OSVint\"/>\n\n\"Hills of Radiant Wind\" is one of the few upbeat songs on the largely dark soundtrack; for that piece Evans sang in a version of Portuguese in a style meant to sound like a spirit floating on the wind. For \"Grandma\", she sang in a French style, trying to \"put in as much anguish and melancholy\" as possible; she created the song in a single recording, and it is \"one of the most memorable songs\" that she has sung. \"The Wretched Automatons\" is sung in a variant of English and was recorded prior to the addition of the mechanical sounds that run throughout the track, while \"Kain\u00e9\" is in a version of Gaelic.<ref name=\"OSVint\"/>\n\nSquare Enix released a soundtrack album of music from the game, titled ''NieR Gestalt & Replicant Original Soundtrack'', on April 21, 2010. The two-disc, 2:30:09-long album has the catalog numbers of SQEX-10189/90.<ref name=\"RPGFost\"/> As preorder bonuses for ''Nier Gestalt'' and ''Nier Replicant'', the two versions of the game released in Japan, two mini-albums, ''Nier Gestalt Mini Album'' and ''Nier Replicant Mini Album'', were included. Each one contains five tracks from the full soundtrack album; ''Gestalt'' corresponds with tracks 1 and 4 from disc 1, 8 and 13 from disc 2, and an electronic version of \"Kain\u00e9\" titled \"Kain\u00e9 / Rain of Light\", while ''Replicant'' encompasses track 3 from disc 2, tracks 2 and 7 from disc 1, track 1 from disc 2, and a medley of several tracks.<ref name=\"SEMOges\"/><ref name=\"SEMOrep\"/> ''Gestalt'' is 18:11 long, and ''Replicant'' 17:11.<ref name=\"SEMOges\"/><ref name=\"SEMOrep\"/> A book of sheet music of piano arrangements of tracks from the game by Okabe was published by KMP on April 22, 2011. The book, ''NieR Gestalt & Replicant Official Score Book'', contains 25 arrangements in 112 pages.<ref name=\"OSTpiano\"/> Guitar arrangements of \"Song of the Ancients / Devola\" and \"Yonah / Strings Ver.\" by Yuji Sekiguchi were included in the ''Square Enix Official Best Collection'' guitar solo sheet music book, published by KMP in May 2011.<ref name=\"KMPguitar\"/>\n\nThe soundtrack album reached number 24 on the Japanese [[Oricon]] music charts, and remained on the charts for 11 weeks.<ref name=\"ORIost\"/> It was well received by critics; Patrick Gann of RPGFan called the album \"an insanely good soundtrack\" and noted it as his candidate for video game soundtrack of the year, as well as \"one of the best game soundtracks ever\". He applauded that the music was both \"meticulously-crafted\" and \"accessible to the untrained ear\".<ref name=\"RPGFost\"/> Don Kotowski of Square Enix Music Online praised the \"captivating vocal work\" and \"exquisite\" composition. He also noted that each track retained a sense of individuality even when it reused themes from other tracks.<ref name=\"SEMOost\"/> He was less complimentary towards the mini albums, which he regarded as good introductions to the soundtrack as a whole but not worth purchasing on their own.<ref name=\"SEMOges\"/><ref name=\"SEMOrep\"/> Jayson Napolitano of Original Sound Version also praised the album, saying that it was \"hands down one of the best soundtracks Square Enix has published over the years\". Calling it \"captivating\" and \"otherworldly\", he applauded the album's originality and Evans' vocals.<ref name=\"OSVost\"/> Original Sound Version later named the soundtrack as the best video game soundtrack of 2010, and Square Enix Music Online awarded it the best Japanese video game soundtrack of the year.<ref name=\"OSVaward\"/><ref name=\"SEMOaward\"/>\n\n'''Track list'''\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Disc 1\n| collapsed = yes\n| extra_column = Japanese title\n| title1 = Snow in Summer\n| extra1 = \u590f\u30ce\u96ea\n| length1 = 4:59\n| title2 = Hills of Radiant Wind\n| extra2 = \u5149\u30ce\u98a8\u5439\u30af\u4e18\n| length2 = 2:53\n| title3 = The Incomplete Stone\n| extra3 = \u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u30ca\u77f3\n| length3 = 4:42\n| title4 = Blu-bird\n| extra4 = \u9752\u30a4\u9ce5\n| length4 = 2:40\n| title5 = Cold Steel Coffin\n| extra5 = \u5fc3\u9589\u30b6\u30bb\u30b7\u9244\u68fa\n| length5 = 3:26\n| title6 = Grandma\n| extra6 = \u30aa\u30d0\u30a2\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\n| length6 = 3:40\n| title7 = Song of the Ancients / Devola\n| extra7 = \u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30a8\u30ce\u30a6\u30bf\uff0f\u30c7\u30dc\u30eb\n| length7 = 3:05\n| title8 = The Wretched Automatons\n| extra8 = \u611a\u30ab\u30b7\u30a4\u6a5f\u68b0\n| length8 = 4:48\n| title9 = City of Commerce\n| extra9 = \u58f2\u8cb7\u30ce\u8857\n| length9 = 2:18\n| title10 = Song of the Ancients / Popola\n| extra10 = \u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30a8\u30ce\u30a6\u30bf\uff0f\u30dd\u30dd\u30eb\n| length10 = 3:04\n| title11 = The Prestigious Mask\n| extra11 = \u4eee\u9762\u30ce\u8a89\n| length11 = 2:26\n| title12 = Temple of Drifting Sands\n| extra12 = \u6d41\u7802\u30ce\u795e\u6bbf\n| length12 = 4:03\n| title13 = Gods Bound by Rules\n| extra13 = \u639f\u30cb\u56da\u30ef\u30ec\u30b7\u795e\n| length13 = 4:38\n| title14 = The Ultimate Weapon\n| extra14 = \u6700\u7d42\u5175\u5668\n| length14 = 4:55\n| title15 = Deep Crimson Foe\n| extra15 = \u6df1\u7d05\u30ce\u6575\n| length15 = 2:21\n| title16 = Dispossession / Piano Ver.\n| extra16 = \u55aa\u5931\uff0fVer.\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\n| length16 = 2:40\n| title17 = Dispossession / Strings Ver.\n| extra17 = \u55aa\u5931\uff0fVer.\u91cd\u594f\n| length17 = 2:14\n| title18 = Dispossession / Pluck Ver.\n| extra18 = \u55aa\u5931\uff0fVer.\u5f26\n| length18 = 2:57\n| title19 = Dispossession / Music Box Ver.\n| extra19 = \u55aa\u5931\uff0fVer.\u30aa\u30eb\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\n| length19 = 1:34\n| title20 = Yonah / Piano Ver.\n| extra20 = \u30e8\u30ca\uff0fVer.\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\n| length20 = 2:53\n| title21 = Yonah / Strings Ver.\n| extra21 = \u30e8\u30ca\uff0fVer.\u91cd\u594f\n| length21 = 3:06\n| title22 = Yonah / Pluck Ver. 1\n| extra22 = \u30e8\u30ca\uff0fVer.\u5f26\u305d\u306e1\n| length22 = 2:39\n| title23 = Yonah / Pluck Ver. 2\n| extra23 = \u30e8\u30ca\uff0fVer.\u5f26\u305d\u306e2\n| length23 = 1:57\n}}\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Disc 2\n| collapsed = yes\n| extra_column = Japanese title\n| title1 = The Dark Colossus Destroys All\n| extra1 = \u5168\u30c6\u30f2\u7834\u58ca\u30b9\u30eb\u9ed2\u30ad\u5de8\u4eba\n| length1 = 3:03\n| title2 = Song of the Ancients / Hollow Dreams\n| extra2 = \u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30a8\u30ce\u30a6\u30bf\uff0f\u865a\u30ed\u30ca\u5922\n| length2 = 2:41\n| title3 = Kain\u00e9 / Salvation\n| extra3 = \u30ab\u30a4\u30cd\uff0f\u6551\u6e08\n| length3 = 3:03\n| title4 = Kain\u00e9 / Escape\n| extra4 = \u30ab\u30a4\u30cd\uff0f\u9003\u907f\n| length4 = 3:07\n| title5 = His Dream\n| extra5 = \u5f7c\u30ce\u5922\n| length5 = 1:57\n| title6 = This Dream\n| extra6 = \u6b64\u30ce\u5922\n| length6 = 1:56\n| title7 = Repose\n| extra7 = \u4f11\u606f\n| length7 = 2:40\n| title8 = The Lost Forest\n| extra8 = \u5931\u30ef\u30ec\u30bf\u68ee\n| length8 = 2:58\n| title9 = Song of the Ancients / Fate\n| extra9 = \u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30a8\u30ce\u30a6\u30bf\uff0f\u904b\u547d\n| length9 = 5:17\n| title10 = Shadowlord's Castle / Memory\n| extra10 = \u9b54\u738b\u30ce\u57ce\uff0f\u8a18\u61b6\n| length10 = 2:50\n| title11 = Dance of the Evanescent\n| extra11 = \u511a\u30ad\u8005\u9054\u30ce\u821e\u8e0f\n| length11 = 0:54\n| title12 = Shadowlord's Castle / Roar\n| extra12 = \u9b54\u738b\u30ce\u57ce\uff0f\u5486\u543c\n| length12 = 4:14\n| title13 = Emil / Karma\n| extra13 = \u30a8\u30df\u30fc\u30eb\uff0f\u696d\u82e6\n| length13 = 3:22\n| title14 = Emil / Sacrifice\n| extra14 = \u30a8\u30df\u30fc\u30eb\uff0f\u72a0\u7272\n| length14 = 3:27\n| title15 = Shadowlord\n| extra15 = \u9b54\u738b\n| length15 = 5:25\n| title16 = Ashes of Dreams / New\n| extra16 = Ashes of Dreams\uff0fEnglish Version\n| length16 = 6:18\n| title17 = Ashes of Dreams / Nouveau\n| extra17 = Ashes of Dreams\uff0fNouveau-French Version\n| length17 = 5:47\n| title18 = Ashes of Dreams / Nuadhaich\n| extra18 = Ashes of Dreams\uff0fNuadhaich-Gaelic Version\n| length18 = 5:47\n| title19 = Ashes of Dreams / Aratanaru\n| extra19 = Ashes of Dreams\uff0fAratanaru-Japanese Version\n| length19 = 6:29\n| title20 = Shadowlord -

The first five arrangements, in a techno style, were included in the ''Nier'' DLC, while the remaining tracks are piano, instrumental, chiptune, and a cappella versions of tracks from the game.<ref name=\"RPGFarrange\"/> In the liner notes for the album, Okabe said that the DLC tracks were meant to be \"more war-like\" versions of the originals, while the second half of the album was intended to \"maintain the image and worldview of the original music\".<ref name=\"SEMOliner\"/>\n\nThe arranged album reached number 59 on the Oricon music charts, a position it held for a week.<ref name=\"ORIarrange\"/> It was warmly received by reviewers, if less so than the first album; Patrick Gann critiqued the album as not being as good as the original, though he noted that \"you can still be awesome and rank second to that album\". He concluded that the arrangements were all of good quality, but that listeners would not be \"blown away by it\".<ref name=\"RPGFarrange\"/> Don Kotowski found it to be an \"accomplished arrange album\", but inferior to the original as he felt that it was shorter than it should have been and that the final two tracks were weaker than the rest of the arrangements.<ref name=\"SEMOarrange\"/> Jayson Napolitano also felt that the album should have been longer; he thought that most listeners would skip the DLC tracks in favor of the acoustic arrangements, and that six tracks was not enough to carry the album given the expectations created by the quality of the original soundtrack.<ref name=\"OSVarrange\"/>\n\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Track list\n| collapsed = yes\n| extra_column = Japanese title\n| title1 = Song of the Ancients - Lost Androids Mixuxux\n| extra1 = \u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30a8\u30ce\u30a6\u30bf - Lost Androids Mixuxux\n| length1 = 5:35\n| title2 = Blu-bird - Hansel und Gretel\n| extra2 = \u9752\u30a4\u9ce5 - Hansel und Gretel\n| length2 = 5:05\n| title3 = Shadowlord's Castle - Iron Fist mix feat.DJ-BKO\n| extra3 = \u9b54\u738b\u30ce\u57ce - Iron Fist mix feat.DJ-BKO\n| length3 = 5:05\n| title4 = Emil - Ultimate Weapon No.7\n| extra4 = \u30a8\u30df\u30fc\u30eb - Ultimate Weapon No.7\n| length4 = 5:34\n| title5 = Shadowlord - Crying Yonah Version\n| extra5 = \u9b54\u738b - Crying Yonah Version\n| length5 = 5:39\n| title6 = Emil / Piano Ver.\n| extra6 = \u30a8\u30df\u30fc\u30eb/\u30d4\u30a2\u30ceVer\n| length6 = 4:02\n| title7 = Kain\u00e9 / Duet Ver.\n| extra7 = \u30ab\u30a4\u30cd/\u91cd\u594fVer\n| length7 = 4:17\n| title8 = The Wretched Automatons / A Cappella\n| extra8 = \u611a\u30ab\u30b7\u30a4\u6a5f\u68b0/\u30a2\u30ab\u30da\u30e9Ver\n| length8 = 3:32\n| title9 = Song of the Ancients / Piano Ver.\n| extra9 = \u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30a8\u30ce\u30a6\u30bf/\u30d4\u30a2\u30ceVer\n| length9 = 5:00\n| title10 = Shadowlord / Music Box Ver.\n| extra10 = \u9b54\u738b/\u30aa\u30eb\u30b4\u30fc\u30ebVer\n| length10 = 2:15\n| title11 = The Legend of Nier: 8-bit Heroes\n| extra11 = \u30cb\u30fc\u30a2\u306e\u4f1d\u8aac\uff5e8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u52c7\u8005\u305f\u3061\uff5e\n| length11 = 8:39\n}}\n{{-}}\n\n===NieR tribute album -echo-===\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name         = NieR tribute album -echo-\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = Keiichi Okabe\n| cover        =\n| alt          =\n| released     = September 14, 2011\n| recorded     =\n| venue        =\n| studio       =\n| genre        = [[Video game music]]\n| length       = 1:00:46\n| label        = [[Square Enix]]\n| producer     =\n| prev_title   =\n| prev_year    =\n| next_title   =\n| next_year    =\n}}\n\nOn September 14, 2011 Square Enix published a third ''Nier'' album, titled ''NieR Tribute Album -echo-''.

However, when Lestrade receives a text for help from Sherlock, he abandons the case and races to Baker Street, assuming the worst and calling for maximum backup \u2013 only to discover that Sherlock is simply struggling to write a best man speech for John's upcoming wedding to [[List of Sherlock characters#Mary Morstan|Mary Morstan]] ([[Amanda Abbington]]).\n\nOn the morning of the wedding, [[List of Sherlock characters#Mrs. Hudson|Mrs. Hudson]] ([[Una Stubbs]]) reminds Sherlock that marriage changes people. At the reception, John is delighted to see Major James Sholto ([[Alistair Petrie]]), his former [[Army]] CO. Sholto (the name is a reference to a character in ''[[The Sign of Four]]'') lives in seclusion, having received death threats and media scrutiny after losing a unit of new soldiers in [[Afghanistan]]. Sherlock calls [[List of Sherlock characters#Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft]] ([[Mark Gatiss]]), who repeats Mrs Hudson's suggestion that John and Mary's marriage will change his life.\n\nSherlock rises to give the best man speech, but he initially hesitates. After reading from the wedding telegrams, Sherlock expresses his deep respect for John and launches into a rambling narrative, describing John's role in an attempted murder case, \"the Bloody Guardsman\"; a [[Foot Guards#British Army|Guardsman]] named Bainbridge ([[Alfred Enoch]]) contacted Sherlock, fearing he was being stalked. By the time Sherlock and Watson got into the Guards' quarters, Bainbridge was presumed dead in a shower room from a stab wound, but no weapon and escape route were found. When questioned by Lestrade, Sherlock reluctantly admits the case wasn't solved, but cites it as an example of John's compassion; instead of trying to solve the murder as Sherlock did, John examined Bainbridge's body and discovered he still had a pulse, thus requesting an ambulance and saving his life.\n\nSherlock's narrative drifts to another case, \"the Mayfly Man\"; several days after going to a man's apartment for dinner, Tessa ([[Alice Lowe]]), a woman who worked as a private nurse, found the apartment was vacated, and the man died weeks ago. Sherlock and John, still [[Alcohol intoxication|inebriated]] from John's [[stag night]], attempted to search for clues, but were arrested for their drunken antics. The next morning, an amused Lestrade secured their release from jail. Sherlock chatted to other London women with a similar experience, but failed to find any significant connection between them. With John's help, he concluded the perpetrator was a man bored with marriage, who disguised himself as recently deceased single men and used their unoccupied homes to meet the women.\n\nWhile moving to the toast, Sherlock suddenly freezes, recalling Tessa knew John's middle name ([[Dr. Watson#Fictional character biography|Hamish]]). Aware that John hates and never uses it, he deduces Tessa saw it in a wedding invitation. Sherlock concludes all the women worked for Sholto in various capacities and were bound by confidentiality. The Mayfly Man courted them to find and attack Sholto, and the wedding is his chance. Sherlock slips a note to Sholto, who returns to his hotel room and gets his pistol to defend himself. Sherlock, John, and Mary race to the room to try and save him, but he refuses to open the door until the case is solved. Sherlock deduces the Bloody Guardsman case is linked to Sholto's, and pinpoints the military uniform both wore as the common link; since Bainbridge collapsed in the shower, he must have been stabbed with a [[stiletto]]-type blade beforehand, but with his military waist belt firmly holding the flesh together, the damage would not take effect until the belt loosened and the victim would not feel it until then. Upon hearing this explanation, Sholto contemplates suicide by loosening his belt and bleeding to death. Sherlock persuades him not to, primarily by insisting that it would be cruel to do at John's wedding. Sholto then opens the door and requests medical assistance.\n\nThat evening, Sherlock apprehends the wedding photographer ([[Jalaal Hartley]]) and identifies him to Lestrade as Jonathan Small, the Mayfly Man, deducing he was the only person who could have stabbed Sholto. He points out the photographer's brother was one of the men killed under Sholto's command, and concludes that he stabbed Bainbridge as practice for this murder. After Sherlock plays the violin for John and Mary's first dance, he quietly reveals to them that he has observed in Mary \"increased appetite, change in taste perception, and sickness in the morning, the signs of three\", revealing she is pregnant. Sherlock calms them by explaining that they will make great parents, since they've had plenty of practice with him. Despite the happy revelation, the episode ends on a bitter-sweet note, with Sherlock sombrely leaving the reception alone, upon realizing that his relationship with John will never be the same again.\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode was directed by [[Colm McCarthy (director)|Colm McCarthy]], who had previously worked with Moffat on the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode, \"[[The Bells of Saint John]]\".

However, when Lestrade receives a text for help from Sherlock, he abandons the case and races to Baker Street, assuming the worst and calling for maximum backup \u2013 only to discover that Sherlock is simply struggling to write a best man speech for John's upcoming wedding to [[List of Sherlock characters#Mary Morstan|Mary Morstan]] ([[Amanda Abbington]]).\n\nOn the morning of the wedding, [[List of Sherlock characters#Mrs. Hudson|Mrs. Hudson]] ([[Una Stubbs]]) reminds Sherlock that marriage changes people. At the reception, John is delighted to see Major James Sholto ([[Alistair Petrie]]), his former [[Army]] CO. Sholto (the name is a reference to a character in ''[[The Sign of Four]]'') lives in seclusion, having received death threats and media scrutiny after losing a unit of new soldiers in [[Afghanistan]]. Sherlock calls [[List of Sherlock characters#Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft]] ([[Mark Gatiss]]), who repeats Mrs Hudson's suggestion that John and Mary's marriage will change his life.\n\nSherlock rises to give the best man speech, but he initially hesitates. After reading from the wedding telegrams, Sherlock expresses his deep respect for John and launches into a rambling narrative, describing John's role in an attempted murder case, \"the Bloody Guardsman\"; a [[Foot Guards#British Army|Guardsman]] named Bainbridge ([[Alfred Enoch]]) contacted Sherlock, fearing he was being stalked. By the time Sherlock and Watson got into the Guards' quarters, Bainbridge was presumed dead in a shower room from a stab wound, but no weapon and escape route were found. When questioned by Lestrade, Sherlock reluctantly admits the case wasn't solved, but cites it as an example of John's compassion; instead of trying to solve the murder as Sherlock did, John examined Bainbridge's body and discovered he still had a pulse, thus requesting an ambulance and saving his life.\n\nSherlock's narrative drifts to another case, \"the Mayfly Man\"; several days after going to a man's apartment for dinner, Tessa ([[Alice Lowe]]), a woman who worked as a private nurse, found the apartment was vacated, and the man died weeks ago. Sherlock and John, still [[Alcohol intoxication|inebriated]] from John's [[stag night]], attempted to search for clues, but were arrested for their drunken antics. The next morning, an amused Lestrade secured their release from jail. Sherlock chatted to other London women with a similar experience, but failed to find any significant connection between them. With John's help, he concluded the perpetrator was a man bored with marriage, who disguised himself as recently deceased single men and used their unoccupied homes to meet the women.\n\nWhile moving to the toast, Sherlock suddenly freezes, recalling Tessa knew John's middle name ([[Dr. Watson#Fictional character biography|Hamish]]). Aware that John hates and never uses it, he deduces Tessa saw it in a wedding invitation. Sherlock concludes all the women worked for Sholto in various capacities and were bound by confidentiality. The Mayfly Man courted them to find and attack Sholto, and the wedding is his chance. Sherlock slips a note to Sholto, who returns to his hotel room and gets his pistol to defend himself. Sherlock, John, and Mary race to the room to try and save him, but he refuses to open the door until the case is solved. Sherlock deduces the Bloody Guardsman case is linked to Sholto's, and pinpoints the military uniform both wore as the common link; since Bainbridge collapsed in the shower, he must have been stabbed with a [[stiletto]]-type blade beforehand, but with his military waist belt firmly holding the flesh together, the damage would not take effect until the belt loosened and the victim would not feel it until then. Upon hearing this explanation, Sholto contemplates suicide by loosening his belt and bleeding to death. Sherlock persuades him not to, primarily by insisting that it would be cruel to do at John's wedding. Sholto then opens the door and requests medical assistance.\n\nThat evening, Sherlock apprehends the wedding photographer ([[Jalaal Hartley]]) and identifies him to Lestrade as Jonathan Small, the Mayfly Man, deducing he was the only person who could have stabbed Sholto. He points out the photographer's brother was one of the men killed under Sholto's command, and concludes that he stabbed Bainbridge as practice for this murder. After Sherlock plays the violin for John and Mary's first dance, he quietly reveals to them that he has observed in Mary \"increased appetite, change in taste perception, and sickness in the morning, the signs of three\", revealing she is pregnant. Sherlock calms them by explaining that they will make great parents, since they've had plenty of practice with him. Despite the happy revelation, the episode ends on a bitter-sweet note, with Sherlock sombrely leaving the reception alone, upon realizing that his relationship with John will never be the same again.\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode was directed by [[Colm McCarthy (director)|Colm McCarthy]], who had previously worked with Moffat on the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode, \"[[The Bells of Saint John]]\".

A flashback revealed the punishments were handed out after Tina and Tammy wore the same sparkly jelly bracelet to school and caused an argument, a fight, and the fire alarm to be pulled. While serving their sentence, Mr. Frond decided to hold a fashion contest (since fashion was responsible for the melee) \u00e0 la Project Runway called Scared Fabulous, with the winner getting the opportunity to leave detention early. He sets it up into three teams, Tammy and Jocelyn, Zeke and Jimmy Jr, and finally the Belcher children. After losing the first round to Tammy and Jocelyn, the kids compete to win the second round against the boys. However, since Coach Blevins, the judge, knows nothing about fashion, he suggests that the models, Zeke and Gene, wrestle to break the tie, which happens to be something Zeke excels at.

A flashback revealed the punishments were handed out after Tina and Tammy wore the same sparkly jelly bracelet to school and caused an argument, a fight, and the fire alarm to be pulled. While serving their sentence, Mr. Frond decided to hold a fashion contest (since fashion was responsible for the melee) \u00e0 la Project Runway called Scared Fabulous, with the winner getting the opportunity to leave detention early. He sets it up into three teams, Tammy and Jocelyn, Zeke and Jimmy Jr, and finally the Belcher children. After losing the first round to Tammy and Jocelyn, the kids compete to win the second round against the boys. However, since Coach Blevins, the judge, knows nothing about fashion, he suggests that the models, Zeke and Gene, wrestle to break the tie, which happens to be something Zeke excels at. During this, Principal Spoors calls Mr. Frond, who left him messages about his Scared Fabulous project.

Socrates tells Dan that he should eliminate attachments and live in the present, but warns him that it would be a painful journey. Dan becomes besotted with Socrates's other proteg\u00e9, a mysterious girl named Joy, who keeps turning up, unpredictably.\n\nA few weeks later, Dan suffers an accident, where his right leg is badly fractured. Socrates arrives and accelerates Dan's healing process. Socrates takes Dan to a caf\u00e9, owned by his former disciple, Joseph, who serves simple food. Socrates instructs Dan to take up celibacy, consume only light food and avoid intoxicating substances.\n\nDan is frustrated, and even fails once, but resumes.

Dan marries Linda, but the marriage fails. He travels around the world for six years, learning new physical teachings, but is unable to find peace. Dejected, Dan returns to Berkeley, to an old place which Socrates had told him about long ago.\n\nDan meets Socrates again, now over hundred years old. Socrates tells Dan that he is almost near to his goal. Mystified, Dan follows Socrates to an ancient Native American burial ground. A thunderstorms breaks out and the two go inside a cave.

After inadvertently revealing the conversation is going straight to tape, Bob steals the tape and Conway chases him through the party to retrieve it. Bob gets stuck in a bush but manages to throw the tape to Hugo; Conway is fined and begins selling beef.

Tina doesn\u2019t necessarily get her big revenge moment against Conway, though she does at least get to give him a little piece of her mind, which is probably more in keeping with this episode\u2019s sense of stakes anyway.
